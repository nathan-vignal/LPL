R:  Hi, this is Pamela [inaudible] and yes, one of the most serious problems in the public schools right now is the influx of foster children who are being taken care of by foster parents and they are being [several inaudible words] Department of Children and Family Services.  Typically, these students are disenfranchised.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They are usually going through emotional problems and unfortunately they are not -- they don't feel loved, they don't feel supported.  The young men are extremely angry, they have a lot of difficulty with concentration in a classroom setting.  Even when there is collaborative assignments, even when there are interesting things to do, these students typically struggle year after year.  Um, many times the foster parents are poorly education, are not, um, able to advocate well for the students or they're really just involved with these children in order to get the money associated with the child's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- care.
L:  My name is Sylvena[?] Berry[?], um, I believe that there are several things wrong with the public school system, um, including --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but not limited to the, um -- the science programmes being a one world view and not having a balance, um, [MN] providing both creation and, um, evolution programmes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- being offered.  Um, I don't know much about the, ah, foster care programme, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- except I've had friends that truly did real love and have a heart for foster children --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but that's the extent of my knowledge about them.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Yeah, this -- it's become a serious problem.  It's become almost a, um, cottage industry and most of the people that are involved in it full fledge, where they're taking care of something like one to eight kids, are basically using the children's funding as income and they are unable to really manage that many children with emotional problems.
L:  Right.
R:  [COUGH] And so what they're finding is, you know, they're in a -- they're in a situation -- I'm sure they mean well, but they're in way over their head, they're overwhelmed.  I mean, if -- if anyone has had two normal children, just trying to get the homework, the meals and all of the issues that surround family life, think about having six or seven emotionally disturbed or [NOISE] one or two physically retarded or [several inaudible words] all of that, seven kids.
L:  Right.
R:  And [LAUGH] you know, it's -- it's -- and -- and what -- what we're seeing in -- in a lot of the schools now, is, ah, like fifty percent of the population coming from these children who've been cast off.
L:  I wonder if that is geographic, um, in some cases.  I live in a fairly rural area --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and I do know that there is a larger -- considerably larger percentage of foster care in the -- in the public system --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- than when I went to school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um but I -- I would say that in my area that the -- the norm are actually families that are relatively stable just because --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- of the fact that this is more of a rural area.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  I understand what you mean.  Well, you know, I -- I don't [several inaudible words] --
L:  Um --
R:  -- you know, is --
L:  But I --
R:  -- I don't know, it's --
L:  Well, I think -- [several inaudible words] --
R:  [several inaudible words] theory.
L:  Right.
R:  Mhm.  It -- it's [several inaudible words].
L:  Well, the schools tend to be placed with more of a burden --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to take care of the psychological and disciplinary --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um and value, um, guidance that -- that used to occur in the family.
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  But the families have gotten so bogged down with --
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  -- having both parents working --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or not having both parents there at all --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that this is no longer happening at home and now we've push- -- pushed on teachers that have too much of a class load --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- to be --
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  -- able to ever be able to handle anything --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- anything like that responsibility, which isn't theirs in the first place.
R:  Mhm.  Well, it's definitely -- a -- as a teacher I can speak to it.  We are required to make accommodations and modifications for students with special needs, meaning of [several inaudible words] special needs and, um, [several inaudible words] --
L:  Right.
R:  [several inaudible words] if you've got a class room of twenty five disturbed kids and [several inaudible words] daunting.
L:  I'm -- I'm -- are you on a cellphone, I'm having a little bit of difficulty hearing you?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  I'm here.  [LAUGH] it's all --
L:  Are you on a cellphone?
R:  Yes.  Is it going in and out?
L:  Yeah, it's going in and out from, um --
R:  Is that better?
L:  That's better.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I heard you very well from the very beginning and just recently it got -- it got a little bit worse.  Um, now, I don't know what kind of, um, training that they give you in the schools, I personally home educate my children --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, because of the weaknesses of the public school system.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, when in my day there were twenty five students and as a home schooler I can't fathom being able to notice a -- the weaknesses and the strengths --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of each and every child --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you've got that many students, much less if you've got thirty five to forty students.
R:  [LAUGH] Mhm.
L:  And -- and with the fact that there are so many students slipping by and going illiterate --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I've got a friend who graduated high school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and can't read and it was just because he learned to play the game.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Um, and there's no way that a student would be [several inaudible words] that a teacher should be required to, ah -- to know how each child is progressing --
R:  I'm on the phone.  [NOISE]
L:  -- day to day.  So, I just -- I find it difficult to believe that -- that a -- that a teacher can know exactly how each child is without having them slip through the tracks -- the -- the cracks.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, it's hard to d- -- it's hard to get to each one of them and some of them are doing their very best to stay removed.  You know, they know how -- like you say, they know how to play the game.  They know how to, um, to get -- duck and dodge --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and a teacher -- and a teacher can be completely, um -- you know, not completely unaware but very much aware until perhaps the middle of the school year.  [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] And that's a -- that's a tough period to try to, you know, shore somebody up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- after twenty weeks of school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  But --
L:  Do they -- do they no longer require as much writing?
R:  You mean in the classroom?
L:  [several inaudible words].  Right.
R:  Well, they -- actually, requirements are very rigorous, there's a lot of work that needs to be done in the classroom but teachers are [NOISE] -- some of the teachers aren't as willing to change their methodology and their -- and their approach to [inaudible].  They, um, typically want -- because they've been left to their own devices for many, many years, say fifteen to twenty years, their idea of teaching and what -- what is really required these days it's really different and that's why they're changing the standards for teachers and making them go back to school and -- and begin to pick up on newer message of delivering knowledge and -- and working with kids.
L:  Well, I also -- but a lot of times they say --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- "If you put more money into the schools, that it'll solve everything".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And in the only case that I think that that's not necessarily the only case but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but pretty darn near.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The only place -- place where I think that really is effective --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- is by offering more money to teachers in order to get more qual-
