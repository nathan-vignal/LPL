L:  Kathy Brown[?].
R:  Phillip Marisinger[?]. [PAUSE] Hello, Kathy, are you there?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um, my name's Phillip, as I said, ah, I guess we're supposed to, ah, talk about movies.
L:  I guess, I'm not real sure what this is. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Have you ever done it before?
R:  No, never.  Ah, I signed up, ah, on Wednesday I believe and then I -- I wasn't around to accept any of the calls until now --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- ah, they just -- ah, they caught me.  Anyway, um, so what movies have you seen?
L:  Oh, well the last movie I seen was How To Lose A Guy In Ten Days.
R:  Oh, yeah, sure.  Um, no I haven't seen that.  How was it though?
L:  Oh, it was good.  Very good.
R:  Ah, what -- what was the general plot?
L:  Um, Kate Hudson had a bet with her friends that she could, ah, find a guy and lose him in ten days and Matthew McConaughey had a bet with two of the girls at the office that he could make a girl fall in love with him in ten days.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  And the girls at the office had overheard Kate Hudson so they knew her bet, so it was planned against each other.
R:  Oh, okay.  So, what ended up happening?
L:  Well, they ended up falling in love and a happening -- happy ending. [NOISE]
R:  Excellent, as most movies do. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Um.  Right.  No --
L:  And you?
R:  -- ah, I saw -- let's see the -- the most recent movie I saw was, um, The Quiet American.  Ah, it's a movie with Michael Cain, um, and it was about a Vietnam -- there [several inaudible words] the Vietnam war in Vietnam.  There was -- ah, Michael Cain was a British, ah, intelligence officer, a journalist and, ah, he fell in love with this Vietnamese girl, um, and then, ah, an American comes along and falls in lo- -- ah, in love with the same woman and, ah -- ah, they end up fighting for the girl and it turns out that the -- the younger American is really working for the -- a -- CIA and, ah, Michael Cain ends up, ah, killing the American lover so that he could stay with the girl.  And, ah, that -- that's about the movie.  It was very good. [SIGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, so I guess they also talked about -- um, we're supposed to talk about whether we enjoy going to the movies or renting them.
L:  I like going to the movies.
R:  Yeah, I think it's good to ah -- ah, to go outside.  Um, you know, get yourself out. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's -- ah, it's better than --
L:  And the popcorn, don't forget that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, the popcorn is definitely important. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And yeah -- no, I -- I agree, um --
L:  What kind of movies do you like?
R:  You know, I'm really not, ah, all that particular.  If I'm going out to the movies then, um, you know, ah, it's more a matter of, you know, having company than really what the movie -- the movie's actually about, but ah I'm more -- I don't like, ah, science fiction, that's not -- that's not something I really go for -- um, but other than that I'm pretty open.  Um, I like, ah -- I like a lot of drama, comedy's good, ah, that's what's generally my -- my type.  What about you? [NOISE]
L:  Ah, chick flicks --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  Comedy. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Okay.  Ah, what's your favorite movie? [NOISE]
L:  Ah, The Way We Were.
R:  Ah, I've never seen that.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Back in seventy eight maybe.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE] And yours?
R:  Um, ah, that's a difficult question.  Ah, probably have to say The Usual Suspects. [SIGH]
L:  Don't think I've seen that.
R:  No?  Oh, it's a great -- it's a -- it's a kind of a mystery kind of thriller, suspense, um, with ah -- yeah, with --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it's a whole bunch of actors but ah Kevin Spacey stars in that.  Um, yeah, I don't know.  Um, I think it really depends though on the -- on the mood that I'm in in terms of whether I want to go out to see a movie or, ah -- or to rent one, but you know, I don't even know whether it makes sense to -- to rent anymore because you know I have, ah --
L:  Pay per view?
R:  Well, I don't have, pay per view but I have, you know, HBO and all those other movie channels.  So, I mean, basically if you could t- -- the only problem with that is you have to time it right.
L:  True.
R:  You know, you ha- -- you can't [inaudible] or stop the movie or pause it or rewind it or anything like that.  But ah other than that -- I -- I mean, I just don- -- I just don't get to Blockbuster that much any more.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, we don't either.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [several inaudible words] getting out for the weekend or they'll, ah, pop something on the pay per view [several inaudible words] it.
R:  Right.  Right.  Yeah, I don't know -- I don't know how you're supposed to carry out a conversation for ten minutes about [LAUGH] --
L:  I know --
R:  -- about this.
L:  -- especially with somebody you don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I know.  It's definitely a experience I've never --
L:  [LAUGH] --
R:  -- had before.  It really puts you on the spot, you know?
L:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] I wasn't real sure what it was.
R:  Yeah, well why, ah -- I don't know, I guess we're getting off the topic, but oh well --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- wh- what made you, ah, sign up for this?
L:  Curiosity.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, same here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Same here.  I just had no idea what I was looking at.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I got an email from -- from a friend.  It's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- looked like something I'd never --
L:  I guess we'll find out.  Ten minutes is a long time, isn't it? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah!  You never really think -- I mean, you know, ten minutes --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because -- because the last ten minutes before the phone rang [LAUGH] went by real quick, but ah --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- but ah at this point, yeah, I don't know.
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, so ah anyway I detect a, ah, southern accent.  You're from the south?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  I'm in the -- I'm the north east.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, today was the first -- definitely the first sign of spring.  We had beautiful weather today.
L:  Oh, it was gorgeous here too.
R:  Yeah, I mean -- but before that it's just been s- such a bad winter.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Had terrible, terrible weather.
L:  Yup.  Hm. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, so we talked about the weather, the movies.  You have any great conversations that you talk about with strangers? [LAUGH]
L:  I'm not used to carrying on conversation with strangers. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, mom never -- told me never to do that.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, really. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And now somebody supposedly pays you to do it, yeah?
R:  Exactly --
L:  That's kind of ironic.
R:  This is the thing.
L:  Mm.  Oh, ah, I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I have no idea.
L:  They should have gave us something more than just movies, some other topic or something.
R:  [MN] Yeah, it's not -- it's not enough to go on.  Um, [SIGH] --
L:  Who's your favorite actress?
R:  Favorite actress. [LAUGH] Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- probably Nicole Kidman. [SIGH]
L:  Oh, good choice.
R:  Yeah.  What about you? [SIGH]
L:  Oh, probably Meg Ryan.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, you do go for those chick flicks huh? [LAUGH] She's been in a bunch.
L:  Yeah, I like Meg Ryan, Julia Roberts --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- um, Sandra Bullock.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know, I haven't seen -- what's the last movie that Julia Roberts was in?  I haven't seen her on film in awhile.
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- she did The Mexican --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- I wasn't real impressed with that.
R:  -- that was a -- that was a little bit back.  Yeah, with Brad Pitt, right?
L:  Yeah, there was something else she did after that, what was it?  Um, no I liked Erin Brockovich, have you seen that?
R:  Yeah, that was a good movie.
L:  She did a very good job in that.
R:  Yeah -- yeah -- no -- no, I liked that.  Um, she did do a good job.  Ah, I guess --
L:  I still like Pretty Woman, um, you know? [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, it's cool.  It's [several inaudible words] it's a classic, um --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah and I'm a Richard Gere fan, so that helps.
R:  Oh, yeah, I just -- I saw him in a movie, ah, on video, actually.  Um --
L:  Unfaithful?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, [SIGH] [several inaudible words] --
L:  That was an interesting movie.
R:  Yeah, that was really depressing --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I -- I needed a drink after that one. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, [MN] yeah.  No, that was -- I mean, I thought -- I thought the acting was very good, um but ah it was definitely not very uplifting [SIGH].  But yeah -- no Richard -- Richard Gere is a -- a good actor, I like him.  Um [SIGH].  Yeah [SIGH] [LAUGH].
L:  Mm.  How many more minutes do we have left? [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I wish there was like a timer that came in and --
L:  Really. [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's like, you have five minutes left.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, [several inaudible words] --
L:  I guess they come in and just cut us off when they tell us it's time to -- to stop or ...?
R:  I -- I -- I mean --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I have --really have no idea because I -- as I said, I just -- ah, this is the first time I have done this.  I don't know, have -- did you just sign up for it or ...?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Because I mean the thing is they -- I guess they tell you like to list times when you're going to be home and, you know, you kind of don't really know what your schedule's like this coming week.
L:  Yeah, because I figured they called last night and I wasn't home --
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  -- the first two times.
R:  Exactly.  It's like, well, you know, I can't just be waiting by the phone for --
L:  No.  No.  But --
R:  -- two hours. [LAUGH]
L:  -- it also came along --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so I wasn't sitting here. [LAUGH]
R:  Correct.  Right.  Exactly.  That's -- that's my thinking --
L:  [LAUGH] But they ca- -- they called again --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at like ten o'clock --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or a little before --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I got put on hold, endless hold.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  They kept playing music, saying we're looking for a partner.
R:  Oh, see that wouldn't work for me --
L:  And I finally just hung up --
R:  -- [several inaudible words] yeah, [several inaudible words].  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I said, "To heck with that".
R:  They're not going to put me on hold.  But um no, I -- I just -- I've been missing -- I get -- you know, on the answering machine I get it every -- every night and I'm just like, oh, you know ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What can you do.
L:  [LAUGH] If they're interested, they'll call back.
R:  That's right.  So -- so, anyway they tell you like on --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- their answering machine or whatever like what the day's conversation was.  And this is definitely the one that probably you can have the least to go on.  Like I think yesterday was affirmative action and like the -- the day before that was like public schools --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and it was like all these controversial things.  It's like movies -- like, yeah they're good, movies are good.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know, [several inaudible words]. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. Nothing like talking contro- controversial with a stranger.
R:  Yeah.  That's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's true.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know, you can't really, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you can't really do anything, because you're not going to see them, talk to him again so [LAUGH] you could get him real mad [LAUGH] --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- it doesn't matter. [LAUGH] Um, yeah, I don't know.
L:  Did you ever see, um, Life Of A House?
R:  No, never seen that.
L:  That's kind of interesting.
R:  All right.  I'm going to develop a list --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- of people's favorite movies [several inaudible words].
L:  Do you ever see Blessed?
R:  Yes, I saw Blessed.
L:  Wasn't that cool?
R:  That was a good movie, yeah.
L:  It -- it was really eye opening.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I --
L:  For it to be a true story's what really caught my attention.
R:  But you know like for -- in terms of like drug movies though, I definitely think Traffic was -- is amazing.
L:  I have not seen that.
R:  Oh, you have to see Traffic.  If you like [inaudible] than, yeah [several inaudible words] --
L:  Is it -- is it based on a true story too?
R:  Um, somewhat I mean i- it definitely has a lot of basis in reality, um, but there's a -- I mean, it's like a fictional story --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it's got a lot of like, you know, all the politics and kind of like the -- the way the drugs are
