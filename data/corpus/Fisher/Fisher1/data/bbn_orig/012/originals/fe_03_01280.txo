R:  Hi, I'm Sheryl.
L:  Hi, I'm Ann.
R:  Hi, Ann, how's it going?
L:  Good, thank you.  Good.
R:  So, how do -- how do we keep up with the topics of the day, is that the thing?
L:  Yes.
R:  The question?  I was just, like, jotting it down.  Well, I know I've been reading the crawler way too much and then I read the newspaper, too, you know.
L:  Yeah.  No, I -- I -- I watch right now with all that's happening.  I'm -- I'm probably watching TV more than I normally do for news.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, always read the paper.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We get a subscription every day to it, and, um, listen to the radio when I'm in the car. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, that too.
L:  All of the above.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I think everybody's kinda tuned in right now, but typically we would, uh, already be watching the news probably at least once in the evening and then we get the paper every day, mostly for the comics and the sports, but we do read the news sections also.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then my husband reads the business section.
L:  Yes, yes.  We -- we -- different parts of the family read different sections in this house, too, but, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, always -- all of us, I think, read the first section, like the -- the news.
R:  And then we just have, uh, one paper in Atlanta mainly, but we also have an alternative type paper called Creative Loafing, and their writers are not, you know, always slanted from the same direction as, uh, the big --
L:  Yes, yes. [LAUGH]
R:  -- citywide papers.
L:  Yeah, same here.
R:  So, we -- we look at that when we can get it, too.  It's like a weekly paper.  We live kinda out, so --
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  -- we can get it if we go into town or something.
L:  Yeah, we have, uh, w- -- the same thing.  It's delivered twice a week.  It's a -- just a local east ender sort of thing and -- and it's got your flyers in it and your local news and -- and, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and biased opinions. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah, uh, the --
L:  Yeah, like, there -- there's nobody -- not so much, uh -- it's -- it's actually more interesting to read and -- and, uh -- than a lot of them.
R:  Um --
L:  But -- but I'm in -- I'm in Vancouver, Canada, so ...
R:  Oh, wow.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, the -- that Creative Loafing, that alternative paper, that's actually like a big -- that's better than probably, uh, about eighty -- eighty pages at least, and they're kinda part of a chain of alternatives and they tend to be more liberal in their --
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  -- thinking and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- they appeal to alternative people.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know, they -- they write towards artists and then they write towards different races and different sexual preferences and stuff, so it sort of is --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- it's a little more broad.  They don't screen for profanity from their writers, for example.  And then they run kinda alternative cartoons and stuff, so it's like --
L:  True.  Yeah, yeah, we have -- we have, um, [NOISE] different -- different, uh -- like, there's another -- another one called The Georgia Straight which comes out once a week again.  And it's -- it definitely [SIGH] -- I mean, it's -- it's, uh, interesting to read just for -- for --
R:  And then that's the one you get to find out where to go hear bands and stuff, too.
L:  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And who -- and, uh, who's auditioning and who's whatever.  But, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's good.  Yeah, so --
R:  And then, uh, you know, like you said, radio and stuff, if you can get NTR and get some news without commercials, that's always nice.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  You know, from just to -- to inform you of the facts instead of having a -- much of a particular slant one way or the other on it that was real apparent about their own opinion.  They're just presenting the facts more.
L:  Yeah, yes.
R:  And then they leave you to figure out what you think later.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's -- no, [NOISE] we have that, and that's -- that's actually what I listen to.  It's just it's -- [NOISE] it's, uh, a news radio station, that's all it is, is news and -- and weather and traffic and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um -- and, I mean, you get -- [NOISE] you can only listen to it for about fifteen minutes and then you're -- [NOISE] then you're, um --
R:  Yeah, that's about as long as we can stay tuned in on anything right now, too.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  And you're -- you're repeating -- oh, I just spilt my coffee here, just hang on. [LAUGH] [NOISE] Didn't put the filter in right.
R:  Uh-oh.
L:  So -- so, how does this -- how does this -- [NOISE] this survey, does it -- like, is there somebody listening to us and recording us?  Are you -- are you in --
R:  Um, actually the -- the machine told me it was gonna start recording, you know.
L:  Oh, so you're sorta heading this up?
R:  No, no.
L:  Or -- or we're -- we're on equal --
R:  Uh, actually, you know, I looked into it online and I went and filled out, uh, their form and then they wanted your social right at the end, and I didn't wanna give it.  So, I just closed the window, but then they called me anyway.
L:  Yeah, me too.  Me too, because it said --
R:  Really?  'Cause I didn't wanna put my social out there.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, no, I wouldn't do it either.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and another -- I stopped --
R:  So, it -- it must not have been required.
L:  [NOISE] No, well, I stopped because it says, "What state were you br- --"
R:  Oh.
L:  -- raised in?" right?  Well, I wasn't raised in the States and there was no spot for Canada, so --"
R:  Oh, well, gee.
L:  So, I -- I didn't -- I couldn't put anything, and I just sorta closed it, thought, well, [NOISE] you know, like -- like there must be another way and I'll just -- just, um -- [NOISE] 'cause I read in -- on one of these Yahoo group things that, um -- that, uh, a woman from Quebec had got in, right, and -- [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, and then I'm -- I'm also, uh, getting some of my news and keeping up with stuff through there, too.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, I've got a Yahoo page set up with all the -- like, My Yahoo.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I've got the page set up and ticked the different AP and Reuters and whatever else was available --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the different kinds of news that I wanted to be, like, alerted for headlines on.
L:  Okay, yeah, yeah.
R:  So, I've -- that's another source that I use to keep up with stuff, is the internet.
L:  Yes, yes, me too.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah, um, I forgot, but, no, I probably, um -- like, I'll -- I'll tune -- MSN has got, uh, some great pictures of -- I shouldn't say great, but they are amazing pictures of what's happening.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I don't --
L:  But, uh --
R:  Uh, yeah, it's kind of -- in a way it's sorta awful to have so much access to it.  It's just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- too much information.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  It really is, is why I can do it, like, ten, fifteen minutes and then when they start repeating it's gotta go anyway or I'll get sucked into it.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, especially, like, today.  Like, maybe on Friday I was bit more absorbed into it because that's when they started the heavy duty stuff, right, and --
R:  Uh, yeah.
L:  And I was, uh, [MN] -- like, it was just sort of a -- you're in awe, [LAUGH] and I think that's what they call it.
R:  That's -- that was part of the name of their little program there.
L:  I know it, and -- yeah, and that's exactly what it -- like, it was, so if you just -- like, we'd never seen --
R:  I can't -- my awe is I can't believe there's anything still standing.
L:  I know.  I know I -- and, like, you're waiting this one apartment to fall there, you know, like all these lights are on it and stuff, and when are they gonna hit it because, you know, but --
R:  They're not supposed to be hitting it, though.
L:  No, and that -- I heard that after, but I -- I -- you sort of like -- like, what are they hitting?  But they're doing -- they're supposed to be doing what the -- I guess --
R:  They've got to pinpoint all these little --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they got that darned satellite stuff and they can by golly -- they can put it in your --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they could put it in your guest bathroom if they want to.
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  You know, because of all the satellites and all that magic.
L:  Yeah, yeah, it's amazing.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It seems kind of, uh, somebody's at a disadvantage. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's --
L:  But oh, well, that's, uh -- that's, uh, that's very, um --
R:  It's really like -- I think it's so important not to get inured to what you're seeing.  That's part of what bothers me about it is it seems so distant and small on the screen and it's, like, actually vast and very loud --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and dangerous and everything is falling down, people are dying.
L:  I know, I know.
R:  So, I really don't wanna take a risk of becoming inured to any of this.  I mean, I think it's -- it should hurt when you see it.
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah, it's, uh -- and it doesn't hurt near as much as -- to us as it does those poor people there.
R:  No.  Uh.
L:  But, uh, God, anyway it's, um [LIPSMACK] -- it's happening, so that's it. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, at least we live in, uh, places where we get news from a lot of different sources, though, and people don't try to keep us from finding stuff out, you know.
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  So, that's -- that's awfully important that we can have access and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we can say what we think, too, you know.
L:  Yep.  Yes.  Um, and -- and you don't, uh -- you don't realize how lucky you are until something like this happens, um --
R:  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just to be on this side of the ocean.
L:  Yeah, like, you just think that everybody can -- like, my kids, they -- they -- it's a real eye opener for them because, um --
R:  Do they worry that it's gonna come here?
L:  Well, I'm not sure [NOISE] -- I don't think so a- any more.  Like, I think they thought maybe something was gonna happen [NOISE] maybe last week.  Like, I've got -- my youngest is fourteen, right, so she's -- she's, uh, she reads the paper quite thoroughly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, both my kids do and -- and, uh, and I think they've probably [SIGH] settled -- they've settled a bit about it, but they just, um, [LIPSMACK] -- they just, um --
R:  But then you don't want 'em to get used to it.
L:  No, no.
R:  You know?
L:  But they -- I mean, it just -- it -- they don't -- they don't realize how -- I mean, I was born and raised here in Canada, too, but [SIGH] -- but, uh, you don't even think how lucky you are until something like this happens and -- and it's been a real eye opener for my kids.
R:  Really?
L:  Because we've sorta been through some of these before but [NOISE] a little bit, like [LIPSMACK] little bit. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Just a little bit, you know.
L:  Yes.  But, uh --
R:  Nothing like this.
L:  No, no.
R:  And, you know, though, it could get worse is all.
L:  Well, I think it will.  I think it will.
R:  You know?
L:  I think it will.
R:  And then how bad it is right now already.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They said they're having -- they haven't hit B- -- the, um, that [LIPSMACK] [LAUGH] -- the big city yet, um ...
R:  Oh, they're -- they're trying to get their ground forces to Baghdad.
L:  Baghdad, that's -- yeah, like, they're -- they're -- [NOISE]
R:  And I don't know if that's gonna be the end of it when they get control of that, if they're gonna be able to say, "Well, okay, it's over", you know.
L:  I don't think it's gonna be that easy to get control of it as they might think either, 'cause they've -- they've had a few problems today already --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- in another city.  But anyway, I guess what happens happens. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] yeah.  There's not a lot we can do except for worry and try to understand.
L:  Yes. [LIPSMACK] Is there -- is there other -- [MN] how do we get the next question, or is that all we're doing is this one question?
R:  Um, I would think that it was just --
