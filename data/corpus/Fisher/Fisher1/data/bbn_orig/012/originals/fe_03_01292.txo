L:  Hi, I'm Kimberley.
R:  Hi, I'm Megan.
L:  Hi, Megan.
R:  [LAUGH] Hi.
L:  Do we just start talking now?
R:  I think so.
L:  Okay.  This is my first call, so ...
R:  Me too.
L:  Wow, we're newbies then.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  H- how did you get hooked up -- oh, we're not supposed to talk about that.
R:  Oh --
L:  Uh, current events, how do you, uh, keep informed about current events?
R:  Um, I used to read the newspaper all the time, but I don't get it any more at college.  So, um, on the internet usually.  If there's a news story on MSN or something I -- that sounds interesting I'll click on it, but I don't keep in touch with the news as much as I should, so ...
L:  Not as much as you should?  That's kinda questionable.  I'm actually quite frustrated with the news right now.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I, uh, I was a [SIGH] -- uh, my husband calls me a public radio junkie. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And probably about six months or so, as the news turned more and more to war and it seemed like seven out of ten stories were about the impending crisis in Iraq --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I just got more and more, [SIGH] uh, disenchanted, I think.  It's like, um, it's a shame that there's nothing else going on in the world that's worthy of reporting --
R:  Yeah, yeah, I agree.
L:  -- so I kinda stopped listening to that.  And now TV news just drives me crazy because it's more like, uh, infotainment and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LAUGH] and, like, a reality show than, like, news programming, so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's a shame, like, even, you know, CNN or -- or some of the more respected news outlets are just really playing it up for all it's worth and I don't appreciate that.
R:  That's true.  I never -- I didn't think about that really.
L:  Yeah.  It's, um, it's interesting.  I mean, I guess I enjoy, like, some of the commentary about how the news has changed over the past --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, umpteen years.  They've talked quite a bit now about the difference between how this war is covered versus, [SIGH] you know, the first, uh, gulf interaction and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, Vietnam and whatever and even World War Two.  And that type of thing I enjoy, but it's, like, I don't need to know the play by play of where people are and how they plan to do things and -- isn't that kind of odd to talk about, "Well, you know, tomorrow they'll be making surgical strikes on blah blah blah" 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- doesn't that kinda defeat the purpose of war? [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  I -- I don't understand that either.  Like, that's all they've been saying really, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what they're gonna do next and [inaudible] --
L:  And I actually find it very hilarious that now, like, every TV news program has this, you know, giant floor map that they can walk around [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Anyway, my news program was just on tonight, or I should say my husband's, and they're doing this on our local TV channel.  And I'm like, "I wonder how much that cost 'em", you know.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Bet they just get that from the network news.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Anyway, so, um, hm, so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- reading the paper, well, that's ambitious.
R:  Yeah, I used to be really interested in international development and foreign affairs, and I was thinking about studying that at college, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I decided not to, [LAUGH] so I haven't been that involved with the news any more, international affairs and stuff, but --
L:  So, you obviously didn't read your local paper then or ...? [LAUGH]
R:  No, I use- -- I was in an international relations class and we always read, like, the major -- the New York and California papers and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] Washington Post and stuff, but not since then I haven't really ...
L:  So, it was mostly your interest was developed through the class then?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's cool. [LIPSMACK] So, [LAUGH] how many more minutes do we have?
R:  I don't know.  Um --
L:  This is so interesting.
R:  Let's see ...
L:  What about -- I mean, do you do, like, radio news or --
R:  Yeah, I like --
L:  -- the internet obviously is very interesting.
R:  I used to -- I usually listen to, um, the talk radio on the way home from work. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  And --
L:  Yeah.  That's better than hearing the same music over and over and over and over and over, but ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's just my opinion.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I actually, um -- the night that the attacks were launched, um, what was that?  Last Wednesday night?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I was taking a train home with my kids, taking a short vacation over their spring break and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they, of course, made the announcement on -- over the train's intercom that, you know, "We're bombing Baghdad", and the whole train, you know, went, "Oh, oh".
R:  Oh, no.
L:  But I just -- I used -- speaking of how to get your news, I, uh, I used my brand new internet cell phone and was able to read --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- the story, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Nice.
L:  You know, God bless technology.  Woo hoo.  I could read about --
R:  Yeah, I've never -- I don't have a cell phone so how does that work?  Like, you can just --
L:  How does that work?  Um, well, it's very, very limited internet stuff.  It's more like, you know, subscribing to a news group or something.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, but it's really great because, um, it's -- you basically just, you know, push a button and they connect you to kinda their limited internet service.
R:  Oh.
L:  But it's got Yellow Pages and it's got, you know, like movie listings, which is fabulous.  It's got current events --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and club events and then it's got a news service, so, I mean, you know, my -- the screen, of course, is, you know, all of an inch tall -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so you read, like, three lines and push a button and read three more lines.  It's not the quickest way to get your news, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I mean, being I guess in an isolated circumstance where there was no TV, no radio or anything else, kind of an interesting way --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- to access the news.
R:  Mhm.  I was in Mexico, actually, when we heard, like, the whole thing when they -- when he gave the forty eight hour --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- whatever it was, um -- yeah.  And so we were all freaking out like, "They're gonna close the borders and we won't get back" and -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Wouldn't be that bad, would it?  I mean, it's like, you know, on a perpetual spring break for a while.  I suppose it might get kinda old. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  That's funny.
R:  Long spring break.
L:  It was actually one of the better speeches I thought he'd given, but ...
R:  Mhm, yeah, I agree.
L:  Definitely.  He's such an interesting public speaker. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  He didn't fumble any words that time, at least.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, let's see, TV, radio news, phone ... what other ways?  Oh, talking to people.  Is there a lot of talk, um, on your campus about the war or protests, anything like that?
R:  Yeah, they had a whole bunch of protests, um, before every -- anything ever happened.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Like, there was -- there were, like, every day you would hear people yelling and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, I know --
L:  You mean like pro peace or ...?
R:  What?
L:  You mean like pro peace or how did it ...?
R:  Yes, yes.  I --
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, all of 'em were, "We don't support Bush.  We don't support the war at all" and --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- one of the girls I work with, her boyfriend, um, lives in San Francisco and he --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- is also a really active --
L:  Uh-oh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Uh -- [LAUGH]
L:  Has he spent any time in jail lately? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I think he got, like, hurt at one of 'em.  I -- something --
L:  Oh, no. [NOISE]
R:  He got bashed in the face or I don't remember, but he --
L:  I'm sure he wears it with a badge of honor.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He's probably proud of it, but keep up on that.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  She's really into -- she's not as much as him, but, um, [LIPSMACK] she tells me, like, all the stuff she's reading about, and so I keep up on it from her a lot 'cause she's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and she's a journalism major, actually, so she's --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- really into it lately.  But --
L:  I'm sure she's interested in watching how it's unfolding then, too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  Huh, let's see.  My friends, oh, we just -- we all kind of go, "Yep, it's happening, but we're still living our lives". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I guess I'm married, have kids, and I've got -- my kids are, um, [LIPSMACK] they're four and six, so, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I've kinda been considering how do you tell them about that?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Obviously, you know, they see the news occasionally 'cause it's breaking into every darned program they could ever imagine watching.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Which I find kind of ironic that, you know, newsbreaks in the kids' cartoons.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Let's see.  Who's watching TV at that time?  Children.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, be sure to, you know, tell them about all the people that'll be getting killed.  Anyway, so that's kind of an issue.
R:  Yeah, how --
L:  We talk about, um, you know, how do you talk to your children about that and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know.  Um --
R:  How did, um, it go when nine eleven happened?  Like, were they old enough to --
L:  Not really, no.
R:  Did it --
L:  Um, they were -- well, let's see.  That was two years ago.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, four and, you know, two and a half, so ...
R:  Okay.
L:  And I mean, that's interesting because, um, you know, I guess there've been a few things in the, you know, current life of humanity that, like, everybody remembers where they were, [NOISE] that type of thing, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like with the Kennedy assassination and then [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think that the, um, the original Columbia explosion was one of those.  I don't know if you were young enough or old enough to remember that.
R:  Nope, I -- [LAUGH]
L:  But that was probably -- that was probably the first thing that, you know, I identified with in that way.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, but then, of course, there's nine eleven and to think that, you know, my kids are going to learn about that as opposed to experiencing it's really interesting.
R:  Yeah.  That is.
L:  But that actually, um -- I mean, talk about news coverage.  My gosh, I was, um, I was actually hospitalized at the time and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I mean, that's all there was.  And talk about, you know, you're depressed because you're hospitalized [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then all you've got to deal with is that.  Um ...
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  That was something else.  We actually drove -- uh, were driving to Chicago that morning and heard about it just before we got in the car to leave.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  And we're like, "Should we do this or no?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was --
R:  Maybe not.
L:  It was a very weird -- weird, um ...
R:  Wow.
L:  An out of body type experience, but that was -- that was some tremendous news coverage.  I guess I was very thankful for that because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I guess it is different when, you know, it's happening all the way across the world versus when it's happening in your, you know -- not necessarily your backyard but ...
R:  Yeah, when it was --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- like, the first huge thing like that besides Pearl Harbor, basically, but that --
L:  I know.
R:  -- wasn't really terrorists, so ...
L:  Well, when you consider it, you know, even the size of Pearl Harbor compared to the -- the size of the Twin Towers, it's -- it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I don't know, I guess Pearl Harbor has this mythic quality because we didn't live through it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  To think that this was worse is just -- it's mind numbing.
