L:  Hi, my name is Karen[?].
R:  Hi, I'm Kathy[?].  That's kind of a heavy subject they've given us, isn't it?
L:  Yeah, I think so. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I have, um, two step kids in high school -- a -- twins and then I have a -- my -- my own son is two and a half.  So, he's going to be going to kindergarten and public school down the road here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and -- I'm -- I'm calling -- I'm in Arizona and charter schools are really popular here and I know that that's the big, um, talk, um, at some of the mom's groups that I go to in the morning with my little one, about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, going into, ah, public schools or -- or charter schools --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I guess I'll have to research that in the next couple of years, because, um, he's -- he's like three years away from kindergarten thankfully, but --
L:  Where is here?
R:  Phoenix.
L:  Ph- -- okay --
R:  Arizona.
L:  I was just wondering because I'm in, um -- I'm actually in college and I am an education major.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I'm in a lot of classes that talk about this --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, I'm in Massachusetts and charter schools are here -- like, are very big here also, as well.
R:  Yeah.  Are they?  Oh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we'd actually had some that -- ah, my graduate degree is in public health and I worked in -- in -- in the state public health sector before I had my little guy and -- and now I'm a stay at home mom, but um we had some that -- that -- I -- I was involved with them -- some of the committees and things that -- when the state was setting up some of the charter school boards and I know that some of the charter schools that failed early on, we just weren't able to keep up with some of the record keeping and some of the people that started the charter schools didn't really have really strong backgrounds in education and they were started fr- -- by really religious --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- groups or other -- like some vegetarian groups and stuff and the state was kind of lenient who they gave charges to and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in the past year they've kind of reigned that in and have a better sense of how to structure, um -- you know, who to give -- who to give ch- -- who to al- -- allow to start charter schools.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- because we had some major disasters early on.
L:  Now, do you think they give charter -- like they give the -- the grant to charter schools because the public school system is degrading or just because it's a new and innovative idea that's trying to catch on?
R:  I -- I think they're trying to give parents opportunity.  They're trying to see if it -- if it catches on.  It ends up costing the state about the same because it's -- they get the same amount of funds and so forth.  But --
L:  Right --
R:  -- I know that --
L:  -- because they are considered public schools --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Charter schools are considered public schools but they're more like magnet schools that have their own like philosophy and everything.
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  I know my concern -- I think when I was in school -- and I'm in my forties, so this is -- this is a long time ago, but we did more -- like real basics reading and writing and arithmetic and stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- and [several inaudible words] step kids and they're in -- as junior high schoolers now in high school, there's a lot of time spent where they're watching movies in class --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or they're doing, w- -- wearing pyjamas to school one day and it seems like there's a lot of more touchy feelies kind of --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- stuff and there isn't a lot of time spent on the basics.  And I think that's -- my concern is my -- my young one's going to start kindergarten first grade, so I wanted him in a situation where it's kind of at -- I don't want to say stringent, but I want the -- the real basics.  I want drills.  I want him to be really, you know, taught that as opposed to some of -- a lot of the -- the fun stuff [inaudible] --
L:  Right.  No, I completely agree with that, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We're doing a project in one of my classes that, um, we have to form our own charter schools and --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- I don't know if I necessarily believe in the -- the concept of charter schools.  Like I understand why they exist and the parental choice in schools is very, very, important but I feel like if we just concentrated on the public schools and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- even the charter schools themselves, they have philosophies that are more -- like you said, more like touchy feely --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, there's more focus on the child -- of wellbeing and emotion, rather than like --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- actual learning.
R:  Right.  Well, some -- some of that is --
L:  And I'm reading a book now that -- yeah --
R:  Yeah, some of that is good, but then it's like they go overboard, kind of.
L:  Right.  Exactly.  That -- like I'm reading like about the difference between a teacher centered classroom and a student centered classroom.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And just that nowadays the students centered is catching on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like it's just -- it's so prominent like in the US --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- and e- -- even though there's so much research, because there's plenty of research over the past century, that backs teacher centered classrooms --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as better learning environments.  And proves that, you know, like when -- you know, kids need to learn [several inaudible words] instead of like whole language --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, whole language approaches and things like that.
R:  Right.
L:  Like they have to learn that -- how to sound out words and like reading from the beginning like --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- from when they're very young is like the most important thing.  Like even though there's all that research, they don't -- you know, it's still like being based on how the child feels and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, their self -- self-esteem and I don- -- I -- I mean, in the public schools today I guess that is a big problem --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- but then I just -- I don't necessarily agree with alternatives either.
R: Yeah.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  My brother and sister in law live in Southern California in a San Diego area and they have a -- a -- what some -- a kid in six- -- ah, third grade and one in sixth grade and they complain about the amount of homework that they get.  That the kids come home from school and they -- if they're in a sport and they have to go and they practice but then they've got like an hour or an hour and a half worth of homework and they're saying that they think that's too much.  And I -- that -- I think when I was going to school, I don't recall having that much homework, um --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and -- you know, but it seems to me for a three year old to come home and have an hours worth of homework seems like an awful lot and the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the parents are saying that, you know, they have to sit down and a lot of it -- it's homework where they -- they want the -- the kids -- their instructions for the kid are, you know, "Sit with your parent and drill on this subject" or "You work with your parent and do this particular project" and that doesn't seem fair to the parent. [LAUGH]
L:  No. [LAUGH]  It's not.  It's not.
R:  And it also -- yeah, it also seems overwhelming to the child.  What are you learning and what are they teaching in schools now a- about how much homework you should give children in a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- public schools?
L:  Right.
R:  What are you learning about that?
L:  Because I, um -- I'm going back into the schools now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because -- because of, ah, student teaching and things like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I just -- I see that the kids today are getting so much more homework than I remember even getting and I have- -- you know, I just came out of school.
R:  Yeah.  And how did the kid- -- how do the schools justify that?  I mean, do they think that that's -- is it because they're not spending time in class, because they're spending time on these touch feely things or why aren't they doing the stuff in the school setting?
L:  I -- yeah, I don't know.  I don't think schools actually justify it, you know --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- what I -- like I don't think they need to give a reason like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- this is better learning, they're doing more work.  But also, kids have so many standardized tests now.
R:  Yeah, that's the -- yeah.
L:  That they -- and I mean that's the -- that's another problem with like too must testing --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- and like high stakes testing and things like that.
R:  Right.
L:  Like -- ah, they just implemented a Massachusetts -- um, a test where if the -- I don't know fourth graders, eighth graders and tenth graders have to take it and if the tenth graders don't pass it, you take out a high school diploma.
R:  Yeah.  They -- they have something like that in Arizona and they actually weren't able -- they pre tested kids and the tenth graders were failing it so they -- they changed the law so that it -- it was going to go into effect next year where you couldn't graduate from high school.  They've pushed it out two years because they need to refine the test because kids weren't passing it and people -- parents were freaking out, going, "What do you mean my kids in tenth grade and he's not going to pass high school?".
L:  Right.
R:  And so they're -- they're pushing it back because th- they have to adjust, ah, questions and the state spent millions of dollars in the past seven years like preparing for implementing this and then they found it was a disaster --
L: [LAUGH]
R:  -- and have to refine the test.  And they pushed the date back and there's a movement of legislature now to do away with that whole -- with -- with the whole standardized testing that would require you to pass it to pass high school.
L:  Right.
R:  So, that -- it's -- it's just like a waste of taxpayers money [LAUGH] almost.
L:  No, it really -- and then there's so much debate and controversy over it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I kind of like the way -- I'm originally --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- from New York.  I kind of like the way New York --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I don- -- I don't know if you're familiar --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- they have -- um, the way New York high school -- public high schools is set up is you ha- -- you can -- everyone can graduate, you know, as long as you complete your normal high school -- whatever your school requires like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, all those classes.  But then there's also something called regimes[?] that you take at the end of the year, it's instead of finals, they're almost exactly like finals, they are standardized tests --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in which everyone in New York states takes the t-- the test at the same time and it's all the same material --
R:  And what if kids don't pass that?
L:  -- but ah you can either graduate -- what?
R:  And what if kids don't do well on those?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, you don't ha- -- like how it was is you didn't have to pass the regimes --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- but either you passed -- um, you graduated from high school with a high school diploma or you graduated with a regimes diploma.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  So, it was kind of like with honors I guess you could say --
R:  Or without, yeah.
L:  -- but everyone could still get a diploma --
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  -- but one meant something different.
R:  Well, that makes --
L:  So, I kind of like that, rather than you can't get a diploma, you can't graduate.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  You want to be a teacher?
L:  Yeah.
R:  For what age group?
L:  Um, I'm actually still deciding between elementary or high -- high school.  If I did high school, I'd probably want to do biology.
R:  Oh, my gosh I wouldn't -- I was a biology major in college actually.
L:  Oh, really!
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's my major now.  That and I'm doing a dual major thing.
R:  I wouldn't want to teach high school, like I think that's too hard.  They're too much, um -- oh, it's just they're -- they're just -- argh, I'm -- I'm not sure I'd want to deal with high schoolers [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
L: [LAUGH] Yeah, so I'm still deciding [several inaudible words] of the two, but.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  It's a big difference, but -- so, just going back to the topic, do you think there's a problem with public schools today?
R:  Well, yeah.  I -- I think because -- a- -- and just looking at the standardized test, there's so many -- so many kids that [several inaudible words] they're not -- they don't -- in Arizona, the scores don't seem to be as high as they used to be and so I think that they do need to maybe start going back to basics or looking at it and have [inaudible] -- I mean, have less free time.  In fact when substitutes -- they were doing -- um, like my --for the -- my kids that are in -- sophomores in high school, whenever the pat- -- in science, their science class, my daughter, the past -- let me think, the past four times, the past two months that she's had a substitute in her science class.  The sub came in and they watched movies --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they
