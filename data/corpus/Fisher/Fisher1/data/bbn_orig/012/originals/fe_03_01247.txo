L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.  How are you?
R:  Good.  Have you ever done this before?
L:  No.  Have you?
R:  No, we're both new, great. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
R:  I was hop- -- I was hoping you had done it before, so I could get a little information.  Um --
L:  N- no actually, um, I've gotten a couple of calls this week but I thought I was going to do it a couple of months ago --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I didn't know what my PIN was, because I thought, "Oh, they didn't do it".
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  So, um, I finally looked up my PIN and thought, "Okay.  Well, I can accept it now", so.
R:  [inaudible] um, your voice sounds like you're from down south in the States somewhere.
L:  I'm in Texas.
R:  In Texas?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm from, ah, Canada.  I'm in BC.
L:  Oh, my goodness!
R:  Vancouver, BC.
L:  Okay.  All right.
R:  Um, the first -- I guess we should start because --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- we're only supposed to talk for ten minutes, right?  --
L:  Oh, I don't know how many minutes [LAUGH] it is either, because you know -- know more than I do.
R:  Oh, I sort of asked a few questions. [LAUGH]
L:  What is your name?
R:  Ah, Derrick[?].
L:  Derrick.  Okay, my name is Julie[?].
R:  Julie?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  O- okay.  Um, first of all, affirmative action, does that -- I have to sort of get a definition on that.  Does that mean, um, hiring women and men?
L:  Yeah, I -- yeah, it means -- ah, I think --
R:  Or is it -- is it like all races and everything [overspeaking]?
L:  Yes, I think equal opportunity for everyone.
R:  So, that's what it means.
L:  And it's a, ah [NOISE] -- they've got, you know, certain companies now -- and I don't know how they do it in Canada, but in the United States, ah, corporations have -- have, ah, policies and plans and have to report, um -- you know, keep -- there's certain -- certain guidelines -- they have to follow certain guidelines.
R:  So, they set out guidelines --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at the beginning and then they have to have so many women, so many men, so many black people, so many white people?
L:  Right.
R:  That sort of thing?
L:  Right.  Um, I know that I worked at a -- a tool company, um, and I was a human resources, um, specialist and that was one of the things that we w- -- we were told to put into, ah, to action.  However, I believe it -- I mean, it's kind of -- it's kind of slow to get started around United State- -- I mean, they're kind of making sure that, you know, it's moving across the United States and also think that you have to have a certain number of employees to --
R:  In order to do something like that.  Yeah, you would have to have like a good twenty employees to implement the plan like that, right?
L:  Exac- -- yeah, yeah.  Maybe -- it may be even more than that.  Um, and I -- as far as -- if I was ever thought if that was a [SIGH] -- a [MN] good thing, I would imagine -- here in Texas I haven't noticed a lot of -- well, I know some discrimination still exists, but I haven't noticed as much, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as maybe some other states have.
R:  Right.
L:  Um -- and I -- I have no idea how it is in Canada, but --
R:  Well, here in -- it -- it's not -- it's not really at all.  It's only, um, like jokingly like Chinese drivers, "Chinese are horrible drivers, blah, blah" or "Women are horrible drivers" or something like that, right?  But it's nev- -- it's not, um -- there's no hatred against any particular race, because there's so many races here.  But it's the same in the States.
L:  Sure.
R:  I guess it's just that we only have thirty one [LAUGH] million, compared to your [LAUGH] three hundred and [LAUGH] sixty five.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] That might have something to do with why we're a little -- where's it easier here.  We're not so crowded I guess or something. --
L:  So, it doesn't really affect your job market?
R:  Um, well -- well, it can like --
L:  It can?
R:  It -- it -- yeah, I guess so, but here it's more -- I guess it's back to the English tradition where a lot of the high up government jobs and our municipal jobs --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they just go down to family members, but that's the same everywhere.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, it's a sel- select group.  Like if you know somebody --
L:  If you know somebody, right.  Right.
R:  But um, as for my view on it, I really don't -- I just think the person that has the best qualifications should get the job.
L:  Well, that's kind of where I am, um --
R:  But I -- I think what they're -- they're saying there's a lot of like -- okay, put it for a man and woman for example, a lot of men will be sitting back and they don't -- they don't want a woman.  They don't want a woman in -- working around the office --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so they'll -- they'll just hire a man, like that's wrong.
L:  Yes.
R:  But I mean, how can you identify that?
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, because I -- I --
R:  Because it --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- it's just his -- 
L:  Because it's masked over nowadays.
R:  Yeah, exactly. 
L:  You know?  It -- there's some other reason that's thrown out there.
R:  But I think you're right.  In a -- in a large number -- if there's a large number of employees then it should be implemented.
L:  Yeah, I'm -- I -- I feel like it's [MN] -- it's probably a valuable thing and I could say in some parts of our -- our United States I do think that there's still some -- I'll just say Texas is such a big state --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, you know, California, um, the -- the East Coast, um, like I said, I think it's -- it's -- it's become more who -- who -- who has the best qualifications.
R:  Right.
L:  The states that I'm most worried about with -- again, are the -- are the Southern states like Georgia and Alabama and --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- those kind of states that were so slow to come around to, um, you know, accepting, um, black and, ah --
R:  It's still bad down there, even nowadays?
L:  Well, [SIGH] not as bad, but I think it still exists --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to some extent and some of the --
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  In some of the smaller communities.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Um, like I said, I've no- -- I've not really visited those areas or I would have first hand knowledge.  Um, I've just gone on vacation [LAUGH] [inaudible].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I just know from what I've read, you know, that every now and then I hear about a -- a little small town in -- um, here or there, um, that -- ah, it's still having problems with some of that stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, ah, I think that's probably -- and again, you do get the individuals sometimes and, um, certain corporations that that's just their -- you know, that's just their flaw.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, psychologically about feeling, you know, "Oh, this person, you know" -- I mean I think [LAUGH] you know, I hate to say male chauvinists but [MN] --
R:  They're there.
L:  -- I think -- I think they still exist somewhat.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.
L:  You know.
R:  Well, as for me, I'm -- I'm currently looking for a job and I've been out and I've seen all different races interview me and I've -- my last interview with two women.  So, I mean, when I look at the work place I see everybody.
L:  Yeah, see I'm looking for a [LAUGH] job too.  So, um -- and -- and there's -- you know same here.  I think to me [SIGH] I -- I think -- what I'm more concerned about than -- than percentages of, um, different races and men and women, um, are older people [LAUGH].  I think, to me, that's -- that's kind of a big problem in our United States right now is that, you know --
R:  There's too many old people working?
L:  -- is the older you get, the harder it is to find a job.
R:  Okay, I see what you mean.
L:  You know?
R:  That -- that's actually not so bad here --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- I think [several inaudible words] a little bit reversed here.  A lot of the young people aren't getting a job [LAUGH] because the older people are taking them --
L:  Aha!
R:  -- as they need them to survive, right?  They're not -- there's not enough for them to live on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so they have to work.
L:  Right.
R:  But --
L:  Well, I just know a lot o- -- with all these layoffs that we've had here --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I just -- I just know -- personally, I've known a -- a couple of women that are like approaching sixty and, you know, they got laid off and they had a true fear of getting a job, because they felt like somebody younger was coming in.
R:  Right.
L:  Plus the other thing that I've noticed too is, um, [SIGH] younger -- younger people are introduced to more computer software, computer, um, education in school, whereas a lot of older people are having to play catch up.
R:  And just about everything now is --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- so much -- it -- it's just so different --
L:  Yeah, I mean they're having --
R:  -- can't keep up.
L:  I mean, I've know that to be true and my situation is that, um, I -- oh, I know the computer, but I don't know fine points of Excel and -- and, um, a lot of other software programs and when you go looking for the -- the ads it says --
R:  You got to have --
L:  -- you have to ha- -- you have to be --
R:  -- Excel, Power Point, e- everything, right?
L:  Yeah, Power Point, the whole -- you know, all that and I'm like, well, I know how to maneuver around it, I know the basics but, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- can I start from scratch and do something without some guidance or help?  I don't know, I don't feel confident about that, so.  Um, you know, I think -- I think there's some other areas they need to address besides the [LAUGH] affirmative action but -- but see, I'm also the per- -- a person that -- I don't like a lot of government control either.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, that's just not -- and so, I mean, I'm thinking it's probably a good situation just to make things more -- just to make things more equitable, but then on the other side of it, um, I -- you know, I don't like a lot of government interference with some things.  So, um -- and I don't know if it really applies to this but -- but um -- though I just --
R:  Well, prob- probably not to this --
L:  Yeah.  No, I mean this is -- this kind of falls outside that -- you know, outside that concern.  It's just like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like the cell phone res- regulat- -- I don't know if you've got a problem up there, but they've got -- um, [MN] they're trying to make it a law in --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- a lot of states that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that you can't drive with a cell phone.
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  Well, what do you think about that?
L:  [inaudible]
