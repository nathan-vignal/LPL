R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, this Jarred[?] Bricky[?].
R:  Hi, Jarred.  My name's Becca[?] Johnston[?].
L:  Hi, Becca.  How you doing?
R:  Okay.  Um, you go to public school or are you?  You sound young.
L:  Um, I'm let's see, twenty two.  So, I actually go --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I go to university.
R:  Yeah, you're not going to public school anymore. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, I'm a little older than that so.  And I send my children to private school because I don't believe in the public school system, I do believe in the private school system.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So, um, but if the question was do, um -- we believe there's something wrong with the public school system.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so obviously -- I don't know that somethings wrong but I just think that, um, there's better out there.
L:  Right.
R:  So, what do you think?
L:  I think so too.  I -- I, ah -- I think there's a lot of lack of motivation, like in some of the teachers that -- especially secondary education.
R:  Right.
L:  And so when they have a lack of, you know, motivation to put effort into teaching the kids, obviously a lot of things slip and they don't teach as well and the kids don't learn as much and it just becomes something that's required that -- you know, to go on to college, first.
R:  Right and they just kind of push you through.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Trying to get you through, um, to say you graduated, basically.
L:  Right.  Uh-huh.
R:  And -- but then when you go on passed that, you have problems --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and there's more of a chance of being drop outs.  And there are those that go through the public school system and do wonderful --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, and -- and I think that the -- the teachers can kind of single some of them out and, ah, as in any school that the teachers can single the -- the -- the better ones out and -- and motivate better and their hands are tied with the ones that they're kind of afraid of.  Um, I know here in -- in, ah, public school here we have, um, a federal programme to help drop outs, ah, and put kids that are supposed to be -- ah, that are on the verge of dropping out and have bad grades and pregnant moms or whatever thing, you know, in the high school --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it's -- it's worked a lot to help motivate the kids to have, um, mentors that are closer their own age, um, working with them.  And, ah, it was a US Department of Education grant --
L:  Oh, was it?
R:  -- that, um, this -- the programme -- that the school got here through another pro- -- through another agency.  And it -- it was really working and now with the funding and a lot of kids are kind of going to be put out because of it -- because you know, they're looking for more grants now.  But um it was a good thing for those kids that were dropping out a- -- where they kind of get left -- left to flounder I think --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in the public schools.  And you can find those in the private schools too, but there's more motivation because the parents are paying for it.
L:  Right. It -- it costs a lot more.
R:  Yeah, and, um, you know, if the kids are screwing around the parents are going to know about it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- where in the private school they're kind of on their own and it's kind of -- you know, like they're bringing themselves up, especially when they get to that age.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I think that, um, the teachers are in it for the money, as much as there may not be that high a the salary, it's better than private schools tuition -- or a private school pay [NOISE] for teachers.
L:  Is it pretty low pay for private schools?
R:  Yeah, it is and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um -- and yet the schools cost a lot of money, you know [NOISE] for other programmes [NOISE].
L:  I see.
R:  So, um [NOISE] you know, when they can go on strike -- you know, there are some dedicated people anywhere you go --
L:  Right.
R:  -- private school, public school.  Um [NOISE] and there are some dedicated students -- you get some good and some fantastic kids through public school.  Um, it's just that I see so many slipping through the cracks and like you said, no motivation.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, there's no -- no big incentive.  You know, you go and you get through it, because you have to.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, ah -- anyway, that's my opinion.  So, now [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- what do you think?
L:  Well, when I went to high school, especially middle school in high school, um -- of course I've -- you know, I've -- I've always loved to learn so, I -- I love taking challenging courses and I took a lot of my education seriously, but I just notice that because of the lack of, I guess, um, some of -- some of the teachers, like you said, there are some that are highly dedicated, but because of some of the lack of motivation for some of the teachers, it just ended up being like a farm house.  You know, there'd be students that -- they -- you know, I had an -- an algebra class actually in high school and the teacher talked about baseball the whole time and so he'd give us our assignments and then talk with like those that were on the baseball team and football team about sports all the time, which wasn't necessarily bad, but it just wasn't very productive for our time and --
R:  Right.  Mhm.
L:  So, I -- I think -- I think with the public system, I mean there's flaws and I wish -- like I think if -- I don't how, since they're spending so much money on -- on, you know, anti terrorism and so forth right now --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but um if they could increase maybe the payroll of some of the teachers then it would be more appealing to people out in the -- you know, in the job market to become teachers, especially when they have a talent to teach really well.
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  And so, I think, ah, that's how you can improve public education a lot, is maybe by paying the teachers more, so it's more appealing and --
R:  But --
L:  -- and also making it more organized.
R:  -- but I think is they need to be worth their pay.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, so the criteria needs to be stricter maybe though.
L:  Yeah, I would agree.
R:   For the -- for them to become teachers and -- you know, because not just anybody can do it.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  Um and it has to be people that are very, um, oriented with kids.  It can't just be, you know, someone that's just smart.  You know what I mean? [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  Someone who's willing to -- who's good with the kids and to get right down there, you know, and sometimes the older teachers just don't have it, you know, th- the kids just don't respect them.
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, they have to keep that respect and -- and that's another thing I see in public school, is that it seems like there's so little respect for each other --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and for teachers and, um, you know, they're -- they're -- because they have to be there --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and the teachers know they have to be there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, it's kind of like -- like you said, where's the motivation, where's the -- you know, what's in it for the kids?  So -- and they don't realise going through, especially in high school at that age, that, um, life is -- is just beginning and they're responsible from this point out.
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, it's going to take them some time [several inaudible words] little longer to realise that, you know, you're twenty two you're getting to the age where, um, you're probably seeing it now.  You know, I wish I maybe didn't do that or I'm glad I learned from doing that [LAUGH] type of thing.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, so -- yeah and I wish -- I'd say the same, but I ca- -- you know, I'm -- I'm in my forties, so.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I look back and say -- you know, I went to private school and I tried to help kids -- I had a -- my best friend was in public school and I was a grade ahead of her, as far as our school work, but we were in the same grade --
L:  Really?
R:  -- we were both in fifth grade or whatever and I could help her with her homework because I had already done that.  And I'm in -- I was in private school, she was in public school, you know?
L:  So, you were a grade ahead of her?
R:  And so even though according to the public school standards -- to me, she was doing like fourth grade work and she was in the fifth grade.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I was -- you know, I could help her with her subjects, because I'd already had all that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so I -- you know, that's where I think that the private school you get a better education and -- and public school they -- they have to, you know, the kids have to be there but they also need to learn --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they have to make it fun for the kids --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know?  And yet, life isn't all fun, so they have to, um, learn -- you know, starting then.  So, I have children in, ah, at school age in private school and there's no way that I would put them in public school.  You know, as long as I can continue to afford it, because of the -- because of the, um, drugs and the -- the language and the disrespect --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- of the teachers and -- and, um, just -- just some friends that I had that went to public school.  You know, I -- I -- I -- and being religious people.  It's -- like I said though, you can't rule everybody out.
L:  Right.
R:  So.  Did, ah, you feel like you got a good education?
L:  I felt I did.  I had a -- I was -- you know, by most of my teachers, I was -- I was impressed because they weren't in it for the money obviously.  Um, well I'm in Utah and -- and, ah, especially in the county, the district that I attended public school, it was like the lowest paying in the entire country at the time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so -- or one of the lowest and so I really knew that they weren't in it for the money but again -- you know, I think you bought up some interesting points.  Like something that I thought could have -- that could have been done better was just I
