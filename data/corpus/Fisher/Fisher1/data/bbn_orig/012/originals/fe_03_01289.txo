L:  Hello.
R:  Hey, how's it going?
L:  Very good.  How are you doing?
R:  Good.  My name's Chris.
L:  My name's Heather.
R:  Cool.
L:  I have a really bad cold, so don't mind me. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no, no worries. [LAUGH] That's cool.  So, where -- so, where are you calling from?
L:  Um, Logan, Utah.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm -- I'm -- I actually go to the University of Pennsylvania, so I heard about it through here, so I'm from Philly.  But --
L:  Oh, well, er, I heard about it -- I do mystery shopping, and I got an email and I was like, "Hey, ten bucks a phone call, I can handle that". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  So, I guess the topic is how do we get our news?
R:  I guess so, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, all right.  Well, I do it from TV and just --
R:  Okay.
L:  I'm a stay at home mom, actually, and, um, and I just -- well, yeah, pretty much watch TV.  The war thing is really tough to watch because my dad was in the -- the Middle East when I -- back in j- -- when I was in junior high.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, so I'm glad, like, um, when I -- back then I'm glad they didn't have all that TV coverage because it would have been really hard.  I can't imagine what some of the families are going through.
R:  Right, exactly, yeah.  Like, I -- I guess I'd w- -- I watch TV, too, and also just as a college student a lot of kids are into the war and what's going on, so, like, just hear from friends and, you know, get their opinions on things, too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But ...
L:  How old are you?
R:  Um, nineteen.
L:  Oh, you're young.  I'm twenty four. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Just had to think about it. So, I'm not too -- that -- you know, that much older, but junior high was in the whole war thing, and my dad was over there, um, in the Gulf War and it was so tough, especially at junior high, and -- and I'm just so glad I didn't have to watch it on TV like families do right now.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, I can imagine a college student and that sort of thing, it'd be really interesting in that, you know, you can see a whole new perspective of it, but I don't think they've taken into account what it's doing to some of the families that have to watch it in -- day in and day out.
R:  Yeah, that's definitely true.  Yeah.  Do you know anyone who's right now in the --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- in the military, in the war at all or ...?
L:  I do.  My friend, um, her husband's over there.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And it's been really tough for her 'cause they've been trying to get pregnant and she just had a miscarriage and then her husband got called up.
R:  Gosh, yeah.  Wow.
L:  It is very, very hard and --
R:  Yes, it's a bad series of events, yeah.
L:  And then I also have a friend who's over there.  He's in special ops.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, it's -- you know, of course I don't know where he is or what he's doing for obvious reasons, but, um, yeah, I have a lot of good friends that are involved because I grew up in a military family.
R:  Right.  I got ya.  Do -- do people in Utah generally, like, would you say support the war or there are a lot of people who are against it or both or ...?
L:  Oh, there's a lot of support.
R:  That's good.
L:  It's -- it's almost close to eighty percent for supporting.
R:  Right.
L:  And I saw, um, one -- they did a -- a re- -- a -- a report on one guy who was a POW in the Gulf War -- or no, he was, um, uh, he was older than that.  Back -- I may wanna say Vietnam and -- and, uh, he was saying what they do to the POWs is they try to manipulate their mind as much as they can.
R:  Okay.
L:  And so they show reports of, like, protesters and, like, people who are so against the war and -- and just everything to -- to make them feel bad, like, 'cause they would see reports of protesters and then they're like, "We're over here.  We're a prisoner of war and nobody supports us".  You know, they -- they do that on purpose and, [SIGH] um --
R:  Wow.
L:  And so now I see these reports of the protesters and I'm like, "Do they know that -- what they could be doing to people who are prisoners right now?" and [NOISE] it's really ...
R:  Right, jeeze.
L:  It's really interesting to see.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, wow.
L:  So, of course, we get a lot of emails, too, about people who are for or against.  Are you for or against?
R:  Uh, I -- I believe -- I'd say I'm for because I mean, you know, regardless of the reasons why, you just have to support the troops who are there fighting for you, you know, 'cause I think the worst thing is you don't want --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- another Vietnam.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I mean, like, if I was over there, you know, I'd hate to come back and, you know, have my whole country not appreciate what I'm doing for them, you know, so ...
L:  Yeah, that's what the POWs were like, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  They were [NOISE] prisoners of wars and like, "Don't these people know what we're doing over here?"  And, you know, "They're not supporting me" and, um --
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, I totally agree.  It -- what -- you know, nobody wants war but if -- when it happens you just have to be supportive.  You gotta, you know -- you gotta know that -- have the troops know that, you know, people are behind them and that they're doing it -- they're there for a cause and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, ab- absolutely.
L:  [NOISE] Especially when, you know, for me personally, I know, you know, several people who are involved and, you know, growing up in a military background.
R:  Yeah, this is true.  It's interesting.
L:  So, it's really hard to see, like, a lot of the protests sometimes, though I very -- I totally understand and I appreciate their diligence and, like, what they believe.
R:  Right.
L:  It's, you know, just sometimes I'm like, "Just look at the whole big picture". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, and -- and there are points like, I mean, if -- if you think about it, how -- people are dying every day right now, you know, in Iraq ev- -- and everything, and without getting rid of Saddam Hussein, you know, who knows but that'll continue forever.  Maybe now, you know, we sacrifice some lives [MN], it's unfortunate, but maybe it's for the -- for the greater good, you know.
L:  Exactly.  Especially when you saw people so excited to see some of the troops in the towns that they're in.
R:  Yeah, exactly, exactly.  I mean, yeah, I mean, we -- I think we do have the support of the -- of the Iraqi public, so ...
L:  I remember watch- -- well, earlier today they were doing a report on, um, some of the Iraqi television and -- and how they manipulate the minds of the Iraqi people, saying, um, day in and day out, you know, lies, basically, and propaganda, um --
R:  Definitely.
L:  It's just so sad that they're not free and they don't have that opportunity to see, you know, the actual true sides of the story.
R:  That's true, yeah.
L:  Mm, so they -- I mean, propaganda but they were just -- oh, it was so disturbing, I had to turn it -- they -- they had, I guess, children who were dying or, like, just been, you know, shot and in pain [inaudible] saying that the Americans had caused this.
R:  Really?
L:  And it was so -- it was just -- I -- I had to change the channel.  I couldn't watch it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, they definitely have a lot of -- like, I mean, the names of the streets over there, there are street names like "Saddam is Great" and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "Saddam is Good".  It's almost silly, you know.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, yeah.
L:  That's ridiculous.  But if we can make it -- if -- if the US can make it a better place, that -- it'd be all worth it.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, hopefully n- -- you know, not at the expense of too many American lives.
L:  Oh --
R:  Which -- which already it's gonna happen.  I mean, it's inevitable, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, could -- you know, just there's so much confusion and so much going on that some lives --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- are gonna be lost, you know.
L:  Exactly, yeah.
R:  But, yeah.
L:  Oh, it's just a really weird time right now. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  And I -- and I guess I'm more with -- 'cause I have a two year old and a eight month old and -- and I have to turn the channel 'cause I don't want my two year old seeing those images all day either anyways.
R:  Yeah, that is true.  And it's -- it's tough to get away from it.  It's like every channel, you know, there's, like, an update.
L:  Oh, no kidding, and Saturday morning cartoons are preempted by news, and I was like, "No, I like the Saturday morning cartoons". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  So, uh, I mean, it -- I hope it all works out in the end, but I -- at the same time you just have this weird feeling that it's not gonna last -- it's -- it's gonna last longer than -- than what everybody thinks.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I don't see how quick it -- it could be.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, everyone was saying, you know, be bang, bang, bang, in and out, but I -- I really don't know.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I mean, it's tough to say.
L:  And you're at the age where if it comes down to it, you're -- you'll be -- you're one of the first age brackets to get drafted.
R:  Exactly, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.
L:  That's -- my brother, well, he's -- how old is he?  He's twenty two now? [LAUGH] He's at Iowa State.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, he's -- but, um, so he's in that also.  If it ev- ever, ever comes down to the draft, he's gonna be one of the first.
R:  Right.  Yeah, I wonder -- I -- I -- I don't know.  People always say, like, college kids --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- don't go, but I don't know.  I mean, it -- you know, in a -- in a -- in a fair, like, society --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't see ...
L:  Oh, hey, it's okay, sorry. [NOISE] [inaudible]
R:  But --
L:  Um, oh, I saw -- I had -- I got a great email [NOISE].  It was talking about, um, the war and it said, um, [NOISE] "For those who protest the war, remember, um, see Bush versus, um, Hussein.  Hu- -- Saddam Hussein's the bad guy".
R:  Yes.
L:  I was like, "Well, that's true".  Um, and, of course, you know, what we're -- what we're fighting for and what we're keeping is -- is for you to be able to protest.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, some -- most countries aren't even allowed to question their authority.  Unlike us here, we can question Bush and we can, you know, you know, second guess him.  You know, that's the whole purpose of freedom.
R:  Yeah, that is a good point, yeah.  That is true.  There's a lot, yeah, just everything is -- you know, turns into becoming geared toward the war.  Like, just -- just everything.  Like, even -- even comedy shows, you know, like --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know.
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, I just, um ... um, what was I gonna say?  I can't -- oh, this cold is driving me nuts. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can't think clearly. [NOISE] So, I just -- it -- it affects the economy because my husband's been trying to get an internship but he's in civil engineering --
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  And the fact that the war is even affecting people not hiring interns for the summer is very frustrating [NOISE].
R:  That is true.  What year is he, like?
L:  He's actually -- he'll have his, um, Bachelor's in May, but he got accepted into what's called a split program.  He'll --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- have his Master's next May, so he's working on --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- he's concurrently working on his Bachelor's and Master's.
R:  Got ya.  Yeah, definitely, I -- I agree with that.  I mean, with the economy, I as well, I'm looking for, you know, just -- just any type of internship.  Like, I -- I'm a finance major so, like, technically Wall Street or, you know, anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's just -- it's just too -- it's too tough.  You know, they're not hiring a lot, and I don't know.
L:  Well, especially today.  I mean, the market dropped so much --
R:  Yeah, exac- --
L:  -- after having an incredible week.
