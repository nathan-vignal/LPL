R:  Hi.  My name's Louise.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  What's your name?
L:  [inaudible], Mannie.
R:  Maddie?
L:  Mannie.
R:  How are you?
L:  Good.  How you doing?
R:  Good.
L:  I don't know if, uh, you've ever done this before?
R:  No, I've never done it.  This is my first call.
L:  Okay, nor have I.  Nor have I, so ...  Okay, what was the topic? [LAUGH]
R:  How do you get most of your current event news?
L:  Oh.  Oh.
R:  Do you get it from TV or talking to people or how do you get it?
L:  I guess I get a combination of both. [NOISE] Get it from the TV mostly.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I guess also the radio.
R:  What -- what TV station do you watch?
L:  Uh, uh, nothing particular.  My wife watches CNN so I guess I get part of it from there.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But actually I -- I don't -- I'm not much of a news listener.  I am more of a radio listener.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I guess because of the war I started listening to --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- TV news a little bit. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, what --
L:  What about you?
R:  When did -- when did you listen to the radio?  Just driving around?
L:  Oh, when -- yeah, when I commute to work.
R:  To work.
L:  Yeah.  What about --
R:  Um, I h- [SIGH] -- I have periods where I try to avoid current events that -- that -- because I think the current events are mostly negative and painful so --
L:  Yeah, actually --
R:  I will go through [LAUGH] a lot of -- a lot of times where I avoid the front section of the newspaper and I never listen to the news on TV.  But, of course, since we've entered --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the war, I feel differently about it and I'm more compelled to find out about it.  But as I'm reading it I kinda wanna stop reading it.  I don't wanna know.  But I have been watching TV a little more and -- and, um, reading a little bit more.  But not a lot 'cause I just find it too overwhelming and stressful to know a lot.
L:  Especially the local news, which is just, um, only murderers and crime or whatever.
R:  Right, and --
L:  Actually, that's the reason why I think I stopped, um, now that you brought it up.  I think that's the reason why I stopped listening to the news.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, it was, uh -- yeah -- I mean, I used to listen to it before and then it was just too depressing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Actually, I used to get emotional. [LAUGH]
R:  No, you're right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, yeah, and that's right, that is all they talk about, whose house burned down and the people that are homeless --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- as you said, murders and ...
L:  Yeah, and even -- what little new -- international news you got was bad news only.  You never got good news.
R:  Right.
L:  So, it's like only bad things was happening in the US and the world.
R:  Right.  And it seems -- I feel like I'm confronted with that enough on a daily basis without adding more.  But I do have to admit that sometimes I feel like I don't know what's going on because I, um, keep myself from getting involved with it.  So, sometimes I feel [PAUSE] -- I don't feel that knowledgeable.
L:  Informed, yeah.  You aren't informed enough, I guess.
R:  Yes, exactly.
L:  No, actually, the -- actually the only news I listen to is the financial news.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, if it's really bad or if it's really good, I guess I'll hear about it in that news.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, it's not, uh, you know, murder or anything like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So ...
R:  You mean you'll hear about the current events because the financial news is --
L:  Affected one way or the other. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And actually my wife is the opposite of me.  She really loves to read the newspaper every morning.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  She reads -- does she read the whole thing?
L:  Yeah, she reads it, uh, cover to cover and --
R:  Really?
L:  She gets, uh, like, depressed if there's no newspaper. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, she's -- she's like addict- addict- --
L:  She -- she -- not depressed but --
R:  She's addicted to it.
L:  News, yeah, she -- she feels like she's out of the loop, kind of.
R:  Ha.
L:  So, and the funniest part is she comes back home and she tells me something and I know what's happening and she always gets mad at me because, "How do you know?" because she knows I never listen to the news. [LAUGH] So ...
R:  [LAUGH] You know, which -- you know, it's an amazing point is I -- I think you can spend so much time reading and somehow just by living here you get the highlights or the key points somehow if you -- you just happen to -- to be touched by the news somehow.  I don't know how, but --
L:  And I guess if there's anything really important people at work will talk about it.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, if it's really major.  I mean, if it's not major, you know, you're not gonna hear about it.  You're not missing anything.
R:  So, I guess I never thought about that, but you really do hear about current events even if you don't yourself --
L:  Actively seek it.
R:  Yeah.  You still get it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or people will bring it up or if we go out with friends they'll bring it up and -- yeah, so ...
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um ...
R:  And do you listen -- do you listen -- besides financial news, do you listen to anything else?
L:  No.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Nothing else.
R:  Are you involved in finances?  Is that your business?
L:  Uh, no.  I guess I got into the stock market a couple of years ago. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That whole boom, and that's when I got really interested in it. I guess I haven't lost that habit.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  Well, I don't know if it's good. [LAUGH] I'm not in the market any more but I guess [inaudible].
R:  Well, it's so funny because just before the phone rang my husband and I were talking because we just -- we fired a financial adviser that we were using --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, we fire- fired him a few months ago, and we were just discussing whether or not, um, you know, what to do 'cause we were -- at the time we were feeling like no one really knows what's gonna happen, so we don't wanna pay somebody.
L:  What -- when you mean financial adviser you mean it's like a -- uh, your broker kind of thing or ...?
R:  Well, he -- he was not a broker meaning he did not get paid to buy and sell for us, but he did help us make investments and, um, would get paid based on how much money he made for us.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, of course, we lost money, like most people did.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And so, [LAUGH] my husband was just -- h- his feeling was, w- well, why should we -- he -- you know, why should we pay someone? [LAUGH]
L:  But you're not paying him, right?
R:  We don't think any -- anybody knows -- what?
L:  But you're not really paying him if you're not making money.
R:  Well, we -- yeah, you pay him a percent of what your portfolio is.
L:  Oh, your assets, yeah.
R:  Even if he loses money for you, you still pay him.
L:  Okay, so -- yeah, so it's asset -- based on the assets, yeah.
R:  Yeah, so [SIGH] --
L:  Assets are the money.
R:  But we're not paying someone who -- I mean, we could lose money on our own.
L:  Yeah, you don't need to pay someone to lose it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  And so, you know, we're -- we're -- we're still paying him a smaller dollar amount but at the same percentage of a smaller portfolio.  So, when you think about how much we -- we -- we looked at the figure that we paid him over, I think we were using him for five years, the figure that we paid him over five years was a lot of money.
L:  It was more than what you made in the five years, I'm sure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and net. [LAUGH] I'm sure in the middle he made money.
R:  At this point, yeah.  Now, you know, who knows, 'cause you never know.  I mean, maybe if we stayed with him --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It -- things would come back.  Y- you know, you don't know.
L:  Yeah, I just don't believe that anyone knows more than I do.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, not that I know a lot, but it's just I think they're guessing as much as I'm guessing.
R:  Yeah, that's ex- -- yeah.
L:  Since they are guessing, I can guess it for cheaper.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  Right.  And at least you're totally responsible for yourself.
L:  Right.
R:  You have no one to blame or no one to --
L:  Well, it's better to have someone else to blame. [LAUGH]
R:  It's better when you have someone else?
L:  Yeah, yeah, it's always better to blame someone than to blame yourself, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You've gotta live with -- with yourself.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But ...
R:  I guess that's true.  So, what got you interested in doing this study?
L:  Um, I don't know.  My friend called me up and said they have this thing.  "Okay, sounds good" so I signed up.
R:  And do you live in the Tampa area?
L:  No, actually, I live in, uh, New York, Connecticut.
R:  Oh.  Oh, I didn't know they were doing it all over, 'cause I saw the ad, um --
L:  Oh, there was an ad?
R:  I saw an ad in the newspaper in Tampa.  I was down there visiting some friends and, uh, you know, I told a couple of people about it and then I thought, "Oh, maybe I'll do it" so --
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] So, where do you live?
R:  I live in Cleveland, Ohio.
L:  Oh, okay, okay, all right.
R:  Yeah.  And, um, is -- is -- um, and how -- how long have you lived on the East Coast?
L:  Uh, since I came to the States.  When did I come here?  About twenty -- nearly twenty years ago.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What's your native country?
L:  India.
R:  Mm.  Do you miss it?
L:  Uh, just my friends.
R:  Oh.
L:  I mean, it -- it's, uh, it's kind of, uh -- you know, you can never make friends, uh, you know, I mean -- I mean, it's the same with any country, right?  It has nothing to do with India friends or anything like --
R:  It's your childhood --
L:  It's just to do with the friends you make when you're young.
R:  Childhood friends, I agree.
L:  Because that's the only time you really have time to spend with them, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  To really think about even now you make friends, it's not going to be the same caliber as the one you made in college or in high school.
R:  But I -- I think it's also -- there's something about the friends who know you and know your family and know, you know, were at your house growing up and stuff, and they just know, I think, like, the dynamics of your life and what you went through, too.  I don't know, it's something about knowing --
L:  The whole set up.
R:  The whole thing about you, everything you were and you can talk about your family or they understand --
L:  Right.
R:  If you have siblings, how -- whether they were crazy or what they were. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Whether they drove you crazy or whether you drove them crazy.
L:  That's true, yeah, that's a good point, yeah.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  So ...  And ...
R:  So, this is your very first call on this?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Actually, a couple of times, I don't know, I've been on this for, like, maybe a month or more.  I keep getting these calls every day and I, like, uh, I -- every time I just cancel it or whatever.  So, I said, "Okay, finally I have to do it".
R:  Oh, you're kidding.  'Cause I just signed up, like, three hours ago.
L:  Oh, are you serious? [LAUGH]
R:  And I just -- and I was actually -- we went out to dinner and we got back and there were already two messages on the machine when I got back, and then the phone rang again.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I must be in the cycle where it's calling me but it's called me every hour, I think.
L:  Oh, because I -- I -- I -- maybe it's been more than a m- -- yeah, maybe two months, right?  Every day I cancel it.  Twice I said, "Okay, I'm willing to talk".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And --
