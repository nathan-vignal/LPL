L:  Hello.  I'm Mark Brown.
R:  Hi.  My name is uh Verna [inaudible].
L:  Uh --
R:  I did one of these surveys uh ... uh back in January uh tw- -- January twenty second was the last one I done.
L:  I've never done if before.  I'm not quite sure how to carry on a conversation.
R:  Well, what you -- just supposed to uh uh, talk and say uh, just what you think about the subject, you know.  Uh uh ... the last subject I had was about allergies, about, you know, about allergies, you know.  How -- how often do you get 'em and stuff and so it's just, what do you think about the subject, you know?  He asked, um, would -- if you could get a million dollars from a person, a unknown source but you can never talk to your best friend ever again, would you accept the million dollars?  So, you're supposed to give your response to that, uh, how you feel about that subject.
L:  Well, Verna, if I had to do that, I'm probably very mercenary.  I'd think pretty hard about it.  Um ... a million dollars could change your lifetime and you'd probably have a lot of new friends.
R:  Yeah.
L:  On the other hand, I'd be uh, walking away from somebody I knew for over twenty five years.  [inaudible] not quite like being married to somebody but it's pretty darn close.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  Well, myself and the situation that I'm in, you know, uh, I [MN] I -- I could use the million dollars.  I have friends but I really don't have close friends.  The closest friend to me is my husband and I'm married to him [LAUGH] and so uh, myself, uh, I could accept the million dollars 'cause I really can't say I have a friend that is really like my favorite friend, you know, best friend.
L:  Well now, if your best -- if you've been married to a person who's your husband and that's like your best friend, then really, if the question was like that, what if it was rephr- -- you know, it meant that --
R:  If it was rephrased that it -- I'd have to give rid of my husband, then no, I wouldn't take it [LAUGH].
L:  So, your husband's worth a million bucks to you?  You gotta let him know that!
R:  Yeah.  I've been married to him fifteen years and he's the only person that I have been with and I will accept -- unless I can have John Travolta, my favorite actor, which I know I can't have, [MN] ...
L:  Well, how do you know?  If you had a million bucks, you might be able to pal around with him!
R:  Uh-huh [LAUGH].  I don't know.  Yeah, probably but John Travolta uh has a lot more so ... um so ... uh, I could -- yeah, I could probably -- then I could probably hire him and go out on a -- a date with him.  Like, once I told my husband uh, he knows I like John Travolta and he uh, took me to a -- to see his movie on my birthday.  In fact, it -- it came out on my birthday and -- and he said, "Well, there's John Travolta" [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, without -- without the aeroplane though!
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.  That was the one that wasn't one of my favorite movies.  That was the one where he was involved in drugs and he was a drug uh, can't even think of the title but when he was in drugs and -- and stuff and selling them and stuff.  He wasn't --
L:  I guess I missed that.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I di- -- I didn't know which one he was in but ...
R:  Yeah.  I've seen every one of his movies, every uh uh single one.  I haven't missed one.  No, uh ... but if it well, came down -- if I had to get rid of my husband, no, I wouldn't take it but if it uh, came down to anybody else uh, a friend, yeah, I can't say I have a closest friend, you know?
L:  Well, I've known -- I've been married for ... since nineteen seventy four and I've known my friend since nineteen seventy five.  Of -- of the two of them, um, I've spent more time with my wife 'cause I go to the same house but uh, as far as hanging out and palling out, I spend more time with my friend.
R:  Yeah and so that -- yeah, that'd be hard.  Right, [MN] --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- so, take uh the money over -- over the friend that you've known a long time.
L:  Um ... it -- I wonder if you took the million dollars, would they let you set your friend up, you know, like in another city or something where he'd do fine anyway.  I know mine uh has considered moving out of the area and the only reason he stayed here is 'cause I'm here.
R:  Oh, so that is a close friend, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  It's ... you know, he's a computer hacker nerd kind of fellow ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  ... and um ... he's -- he's stuck around ... you know, he's been thinking of going to another state 'cause there might be more work there ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  ... and part of the reason he stayed is 'cause I'm living here and there's -- he doesn't have any friends or family here other than me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, boy, that'd be a slap in the face.
R:  Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.  He'd day, "Oh, you took a million dollars over me" but you know, he'd probably uh, [MN] --
L:  Well, you wouldn't even get to explain.  Whatever the rules were, you -- you -- no more contact.
R:  Oh, that's right [LAUGH].  Yeah, that's almost [MN] yeah, it was -- th- -- yeah, that would be right, you know?  Yeah, yeah, that'd be hard, yeah.
L:  Um ... the same thing with your husband.  If he came home one day and you just weren't there.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That'd be --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- that'd be -- that'd be -- yeah, terrible [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  I'd -- that probab- -- of course uh ... if you had a million dollars you could console yourself for a very long time down in The Bahamas and think about it.
R:  Uh-huh, yeah [LAUGH] uh-huh, yeah.
L:  Um ...
R:  That's like Joe Millionaire.  He got a million do- -- him and that girl got a million dollars but it doesn't look like they're -- they're friends but they're not gonna continue the relationship but they each got five hundred thousand dollars so they got -- still got a deal out of it [LAUGH].  Did you wa- --
L:  I don't know.  I -- I don't watch much TV.  I um ...
R:  I like to watch -- I like the [MN] shows like Joe Millionaire and Bachelor and court shows.  I like to watch shows like that [LAUGH].
L:  I ... well, I used to watch a lot of TV and what happened was I figured out, all I was doing was watching TV.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um ... so I quit watching TV and since then, I spend more time surfing on the internet than I was watching TV.
R:  Well, I still surf on the internet and do that but since I only work in temporary office work, been slow working, I -- I have time to look on the computer and do surveys and stuff and stuff.
L:  Well, that brings you to this one.
R:  Uh-huh.  Do you li- -- uh, do you like doing surveys?
L:  Well, I don't do very many.  I've -- so far, one of 'em, I got five hundred smackers on because uh, I -- I didn't even do it for the survey ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  ... I had a product that really, really pissed me off a lot.
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  So, what I did is um ... I went onto their site and they had a customer feedback thing.
R:  Yeah?
L:  And it turned out it was actually a survey they were taking.  I filled it out until I got to the very end where they were asking your name and this and that ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  ... and I just put in my email address and stopped and then uh about three months later I got a -- a contact from a place.  I thought, what is this, another one of them scams ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  ... and then uh, yeah it said I won five hundred bucks and I went on the internet and looked it up and found out they were actually a fulfillment service.  So, I -- I sent back the email and uh about a month later, I got a check for five hundred smackers.
R:  Jeez.
L:  So, I wasn't even try- -- yeah, I wasn't even trying.
R:  Uh-huh.  Wow.
L:  Uh ...
R:  I ... I sign up for surveys and -- and [several inaudible words].  I signed up at a advisory panel to do their surveys.  I get their surveys once in a while and I won their uh [inaudible] and I got seventy five dollars and I -- and I said, "Is this for doing the survey?" [MN]
L:  So, you'll go for seventy five bucks if you don't have to dump your husband but if it was a million bucks ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  ... you wouldn't?
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, he -- he's in -- he's in the next room watching TV and so I'm usually talking to him anyway [LAUGH].  He -- he likes to watch uh sci fi shows and I don't like to watch sci fi shows.  He -- he likes to watch Star Trek and shows like that.
L:  Huh.
R:  Uh and I don't like uh shows like that so he's usually in there watching TV and I'm usually in the next room looking at my computer and -- and the shows I wanna watch, I'll tape them and then watch them later on.  Uh ... he likes some of the same shows I do and he -- he doesn't like some of the shows I do.
L:  Well, now --
R:  Would you give up a million dollars -- would you take a million dollars to never talk to me again?  Ever again?
L:  Wh- wh- wh- wh- -- bad question.  You don't ask your husband that.  He might say, "Yes"!
R:  Oh!  [LAUGH] what?  He -- he -- he said, "No" [LAUGH].  He said, "No".
L:  Well, he'll get a big smooch tonight then!
R:  [LAUGH] We've been married uh fifteen years [LAUGH].  He --
L:  Well, I --
R:  He -- he knows how to stay on the good side.  He'll -- he'll say, "No" [LAUGH].
L:  Well, he'll get a smooch tonight anyway.
R: [LAUGH]  He'll -- he'll -- he wants to stay on the good side.  He'll sa- -- he'll -- he'll say, "No" [LAUGH].
L:  Works for me.  Um ... now, how long do these discussions go?
R:  Well, the guy comes on and he say- -- he -- the guy comes on and he'll say, "Your time's up" and I think the last one was fifteen minutes, ten or fifteen minutes.
L:  Okay.
R:  And he'll come on and he'll come on and he'll say, "Your time's up, uh, thanks for your time and please say goodbye".  Uh, the last one I did was January twenty second and -- and -- but -- and I sent them an email asking them when this is supposed to be over and they said they were still doing um ... still doing the questions so I don't know.
L:  Okay.
R:  How long they're gonna be, you know, [several inaudible words] --
L:  Do you know what they're doing with this stuff?
R:  [MN]
L:  I mean, I do know.  I'm just curious if you do?
R:  Is it a college or college kids are doing it?
L:  Yeah.  What they're doing is, they're studying the human language and what they do is, somebody listens to this afterwards and then goes along and marks the language with uh, you know, they -- they listen and then they use a computer program to mark the parts of speech, like, aye, ah, and ... to the -- to the actual sounds you and I are making ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  ... and what they do is, they have lots of people saying the same kinds of things and they can teach a computer to understand how people talk.
R:  Oh.
L:  Uh ... many, many years ago, I used to write software for the uh ... the -- the visually impaired and what I ...
