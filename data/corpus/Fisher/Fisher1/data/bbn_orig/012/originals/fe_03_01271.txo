R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  This is Rose.  How --
R:  I'm Amy.
L:  Hi, Amy.  How are you?
R:  I'm good.
L:  Okay.  So, our topic today is how do we get our current events?
R:  I'm watching CNN now. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's what I've had on all day long.
R:  All day, all week. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] From the minute I get up it's on.
R:  Yeah, me too.  That's the first thing I do, is turn it on and probably that's the last thing I see before I go to bed.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  And if I turn it off for a couple of hours to go somewhere I come right home and turn it back on again.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I usually don't listen to it in the car, though.
R:  No, I don't either. [LAUGH]
L:  No.  That's music or CDs or something. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the newspaper, I generally don't buy that.  Do you?
R:  No, I don't.  I subscribe online, actually.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's what I do on AOL, [MN] I get all the current events from the night before.
R:  You a computer junkie, too?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah, me too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Big time.
R:  Yep.  And I'm also in the National Guard, so that's why I've been --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I've been glued to the TV lately.
L:  Oh.  My, uh, ex husband is in the National Guard.  He was in the Navy years and years ago.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, he had stayed in the National Guard and he was called to active duty in Germany and he was brought back around Christmastime.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, he just missed the whole thing.
R:  Yeah, I guess.  Well, I'm hoping to not go anywhere. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think every time the phone rings I keep thinking, "Please don't let this be the call".
L:  Oh, I can imagine.
R:  And so far so good. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [MN] So, are you in Pennsylvania?  I don't know if we're allowed to ask that.
R:  No, I'm not.  I'm in Ohio.
L:  Yeah, I'm in Pennsylvania.
R:  I found this online [LAUGH] and I thought --
L:  Yeah, online.
R:  -- "Heck, I'm home, I can talk". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's what I said.  Ten minutes, this is easy.
R:  Make money to talk on the phone.
L:  We got eight --
R:  What's that?
L:  We got eight more minutes yet. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  So, are you for it, I don't know, with being in the --
R:  Yeah, yeah, I am.
L:  -- National Guard, you -- you volunteer and ...
R:  Yes.
L:  Mhm.  Me too.
R:  We went -- there's been a lot of protests going on.  There was a big one yesterday right in front of one of our food towns.
L:  Oh.
R:  It just makes me angry.
L:  I know 'cause you -- you know what I think?  I think the people are still thinking of Vietnam.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think when they think of war they think of that long drawn out war.
R:  Yeah, that's probably true.  They just had a guy -- I don't know if you watch CNN right now, but they just had a guy on CNN probably not even three minutes ago, an Iraqi guy that said, uh, that he expects this to go on for years if we don't give up.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I'm thinking --
L:  No, I don't --
R:  "I don't think -- you don't have enough country to last for years". [LAUGH]
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  As bad as that sounds.  I mean, look what we did in one night.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Don't -- don't -- please don't make us stay for years. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  That would be bad for you.
L:  Bad for them, absolutely.  And I have a son who's gonna be turning eighteen, so -- and he's been thinking about going active duty, and he kinda follows what's going on.  He relies on me or other people, school, whatever, to tell him, you know, what's going on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it hasn't really swayed his decision y- any to go active duty.
R:  Yeah.  I think -- I -- I joined the guard right in ninety two, so it was right after Desert Storm, and I was hoping that I wouldn't see anything. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, of course, I was only planning on staying in for six years, and now I'm going on eleven.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, I guess I should have figured that eventually my luck would run out.  I wouldn't join now if I wasn't already in, that's for sure.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I don't have any desire to get out right now either.  It's just kind of scary wondering -- I have a son also, a husband and a son now.  My son's nineteen months old, and I keep thinking what a bummer that would be if I had --
L:  Does that matter?
R:  Uh, no, not really. [LAUGH]
L:  No?
R:  No.
L:  They would still take you?
R:  You get a couple of months right after they're born.  I think they give you -- I don't know, last I heard was four months, and, uh -- 'cause a friend of mine has a -- a friend of mine has a daughter who's in who, uh, just had a baby, and she's active duty.  And the day after the baby turned four months, they -- she got deployed.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, that would be pretty horrible.
L:  Yeah.  That's for sure.  So, does the, uh, army, like, send you any information?
R:  No.
L:  Like what's going on?  No?
R:  No, not really.
L:  No briefings or anything like that?
R:  No.  We just --
L:  'Cause I take these classes, these aromatherapy classes, and, um, the woman who owns Minerva, she, um, she's a nurse.  Um, I guess she's -- well, I don't know what you would call that, [MN] part time, whatever.  She's enlisted but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- doesn't go active duty unless she's called.
R:  Right.
L:  And she was called back in October to go in Paraguay. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  On the field there.  And -- and she said when she got called that she got all this briefing and stuff [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah, probably if we got --
L:  -- to go in.  Yeah.
R:  -- if we got closer we would get briefings and stuff, but as for -- I mean, we've had people from our base that have gone, but not -- not my specialty exactly hasn't been called yet, so ...
L:  And what's your specialty in there?
R:  I'm services, which is a whole combination of everything from the cooks to running the morgue. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  And everything in between.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But no combat and I don't fly a jet or anything like that, so ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I have never jumped out of a plane --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that everybody always asks me that, too.
L:  Well, that's good. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  We'll know that we can do that. [LAUGH]
R:  So, I've been lucky so far.  And hoping to stay lucky. [LAUGH] I'm figuring eventually my luck will run out. [LAUGH] I don't think I can avoid going forever.
L:  Well, I think if it lasts a long time then you might -- I know my ex husband he has ninety days that they could call him active again.
R:  Yeah.
L:  To go.
R:  Yeah.  Well, when we joined there -- it was pretty much a given that you could -- you know, you might get called.  You would do one weekend a month and two weeks out of your summer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then there's always the possibility of having to go longer.  And right after, uh, nine eleven they told us that if we got called up anywhere it would be for ninety days, which to me at that time just sounded crazy.  I'm thinking, "Being away from home for ninety days?  Oh, my gosh".
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, now it's gone from that to six months to a year if we go anywhere.
L:  Uh-huh, that's how long he was gone.
R:  So, [LAUGH] I'm thinking, uh, ninety days sounded really good. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'll take those ninety days now. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Well, that's originally what Hugh had gone for, ninety days, to Germany, and then they told him, "Uh-uh, you're staying longer".
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  So, he was there nine months.
R:  Nine months?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  In Germany.
R:  Holy smoke.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have a friend whose husband has been over to Saudi Arabia twice in the last year.
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm thinking I don't really wanna do that desert thing. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  I keep telling them, "I'm allergic to sand". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Can send me to Germany or something, but I -- I don't really wanna go to the desert.
L:  [LAUGH] Or you could be called to Paraguay.  I mean, like whoever heard of Paraguay?
R:  I don't think -- I don't even know where Paraguay is.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  That -- that was just a short mission.  She went, did her -- I think she was gone two weeks, that was it.
R:  Oh, that'd be all right.
L:  Then brought back.
R:  I would go to Paraguay for two weeks.  What the hey --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- just to say you've been there.
L:  And being a nurse, she could be called, so I'm sure she's really glued to the TV all the time, too. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they probably would want nurses --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- more than they would want cooks right now. [LAUGH]
L:  Especially the way it's going now, them capturing us and everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, that's horrible.
R:  And it's horrible that some of the stuff the media are showing.
L:  Well, thank God they're not showing that picture where those US soldiers were shot execution style.
R:  Yeah, I heard about that.
L:  Awful.
R:  Did they show it once?
L:  No.  They said they weren't gonna air it in the United States, but that Al Jeera was showing it there.
R:  Oh.
L:  In Iraq.  They're getting their jollies out of that, I'm sure, but --
R:  Yeah, I heard about that yesterday and I thought, "Oh, man, did I miss something?" [LAUGH]
L:  No.  I wouldn't even wanna see that.
R:  No, I probably wouldn't either, but it's kinda like one of -- you know, a car accident.  You don't really wanna see it, but you can't help but look.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.
R:  And then for that mother that found out her son was a POW watching Filipino TV.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That would be terrible.  You don't wanna find out about that stuff on television.
L:  Yeah, not that way.  Now, you would think they would have called her first.
R:  Right.
L:  Or tried to notify her before it went [LAUGH] on TV.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, "Oh, my God, there's my son".
R:  That's what she was saying, too.  She just was watching it and --
L:  You know, I guess that was her on AOL that her -- had her hand cupped over her mouth?
R:  I don't -- I'm not sure.
L:  Saying, "That's my son".  I bet -- I didn't read that one.  There's so much to read.
R:  I'm usually doing eBay stuff. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm an eBay junkie, too.  So, how many minutes are we at now?
L:  Uh, I think we have forty two seconds to go.
R:  Oh, hey, not bad. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Much more easy to talk to someone you don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's funny.
L:  And trying to keep on this topic, I mean, you could find all -- you know, talk to somebody you don't know.
R:  Sure.
L:  I know 'cause I did, not telemarketing, but I -- I -- years ago I worked from my home when my kids were little doing -- calling, um, businesses and updating their databases for the company.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that was so cool 'cause I talked to Indians and [LAUGH] --
R:  All right.
L:  And I was just going on, getting all kinds of information, you know.
R:  Oh, that would be fun.
L:  It's really cool to talk to people you don't know.  That's what, you know, sparked my interest for this.  I thought, "This is cool".
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Sure, why not? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Oh.
L:  That's it, ten minutes.
