R:  Hi.
L:  Hey there.
R:  I'm Brenda.
L:  I'm Kathy[?], nice to meet you.
R:  Oh, that's funny. [LAUGH] My -- both my room mates are Kathy.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Neat.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, so, w- -- so, what about the, ah -- the topic?
R:  Affirmative action?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, I don't think I ever have -- understand it very well.
L:  Really?
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I like it from a part.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I think it needs to be equal no matter what you're talking about.
L:  Yeah, I think so too.  I -- I guess, um -- I guess I'm a little -- I don't know, I -- sometimes I think it's a good thing and -- and sometimes I -- I just think it's not such a great idea --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and so.
R:  Depends on how people use it.
L:  That's true.  That's true.
R:  If they use it to their advantage then it's not very good.
L:  Yeah.  Where -- um, what part of the country are you from?
R:  Um, Tampa, Florida.
L:  Yeah, I was going to say, that probably has a -- um, a -- you know, probably depends a little bit on -- on what you think about it, so.
R:  Do -- ah, where are you from?
L:  From Alabama.
R:  Oh.
L:  And so, yeah.  Yeah, I think -- 
R:  [inaudible].
L:  I think it can be a -- a beneficial thing, but I think it -- a lot of times in the corporate world it can be used the wrong way.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I would imagine that being in a big city would make a difference.
L:  Yeah, I think so too.
R:  Um --
L:  Are -- are you a business person?
R:  No, actually I'm not employed right now, I've --
L:  Really?
R:  -- medically not able to.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Um, but when I did work -- where I d- -- where I was working, it was, um -- you know, they always have to advertise equal opportunity, all that kind of stuff and --
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
R:  -- it seemed like it was like that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- pretty well.
L:  [NOISE] I'm sorry, what'd you say?
R:  It seemed like it was pretty good there where I was working.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, so --
L:  When you worked in the medical profession?
R:  Actually, I worked in a, um, community college center.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I'm ju- -- medically, I'm just not able to work.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  How long did you work there for?
R:  Oh, gosh, um, fifteen years.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Neat.
R:  Yup.  Um, so I've never really had to deal with affirmative action on a personal basis.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know --
L:  I know, I've -- I haven't either, I've -- I've been, um, ah, worked just a -- a little bit out a college and now I'm -- I'm staying home with my baby, so, um, it doesn't really, um, I don't really see -- see that much of it either where I -- from my stand point, so.
R:  I heard your, um, baby in the background, I think.
L:  Yeah.  She's hungry. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Whoops.
L:  I was feeding her a little bit, so.  Yeah.  But -- yeah, I don't know, um, I guess -- I don't know, like I said, I -- I kind of agree with some of the -- some of things on it, but you know, for the most part I think -- I think it can definitely be a bad thing and -- and it stops a lot of people from getting to the point where they need to be the people that have worked hard.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so ...
R:  I'm sure on the other hand it's helped a lot of people too though.
L:  That's true too.  Yeah, I -- I definitely agree with that and I --
R:  Um --
L:  -- especially people that can't, um -- can't get in, you know, some place otherwise --
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, it helps.
R:  Yeah, like maybe people that have a foot in the door or something like that?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.
R:  [MN] If they're qualified for a position I think it's, you know, the best thing that can happen.
L:  Yeah, I agree.  I agree.
R:  It's -- it's -- I don't know, I -- I think there's good and bad for everything.
L:  Yeah -- yep, same here.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is actually a pretty hard topic. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] I don't know that much about it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I knew -- I know a little as well, I guess.  I mean, I guess just in the -- in -- in general in the business world it's, um, I guess just a -- just a whole promoting somebody based on color, race, without qualifications isn- isn't a good thing, but I don't know. [LAUGH] This is -- it's kind of a tough topic to -- yeah, to talk about, so.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Maybe that's why they chose it.
L:  Maybe so. [LAUGH] So, how many years did you -- you said you worked fifteen years at the community college?
R:  Um, yeah something like that, ah --
L:  Neat.
R:  -- I started in eighty seven and I had to quit in two thousand --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- two.  Last year.
L:  So, you're -- you're pretty -- you just got out of it --
R:  I'm pretty old.
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I wasn't going in that direction.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's okay, [LAUGH] I like to have fun.
L:  That's neat.  What did -- what did you do at the community college?
R:  I taught mathematics.
L:  Oh, okay.  Wow, so you're a numbers person then?
R:  Sometimes. [LAUGH]
L:  Sometimes. [LAUGH]
R:  If I don't have to add or subtract, multiply or divide in front of the classroom --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I'm fine.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Once I get in front of the classroom I can't do that.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I have many students that can testify to that.
L:  [LAUGH] So, you're actually a professor in the -- in the college?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, neat.
R:  Yeah.  That was only for like eight years.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, because before that I had to get my degree.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I tutored maths, um --
L:  And you probably would have tutored somebody like me, because I'm not good in math. [LAUGH]
R:  That's the fun of it.
L:  [inaudible] I bet. [LAUGH]
R:  I enjoy that part.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's definitely my weakest subject, so. [LAUGH]
R:  It used to be mine.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Neat.  You just kept -- kept working at it?
R:  Well, for awhile I just abandoned every -- every hope of ever getting a degree --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then I guess through the course of finding out that if you don't have a degree you can't do anything, I finally said, "Okay, I'm going to go back and do it".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And when I put the energy into it and went and sought help from people who could help me and stuff like that instead of like giving up, then I was, um, able to make it through it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But um, I'm not a math whiz or anything like that.  Don't think that.
L:  Really?
R:  Because I studied for eight or -- eight or nine hours every day --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- to get the stuff.
L:  That's pretty intense, I don't know if I could commit myself to -- to math [LAUGH] like that, that's great.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible] neat.
R:  Um --
L:  So, you have two room mates named Kathy?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Neat.  Tha-  that's cool.
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, so do you have any other, um, ideas on affirmative action?
R:  Um, I was trying to think of it, um -- what -- I wonder if in affirmative action would be more important in a bigger corporation.  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, thinking of a smaller run business may not, um, need -- need it as much possibly unless, um, I don't know -- like, I think a family run business is -- like everybody in the family does it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or almost everybody in the family does it, but larger corporation- -- larger corporations that have, um, businesses in different cities and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all that kind of stuff, I'm just thinking that they may need it.  It really -- may be really important for businesses like that.
L:  They probably -- yeah, because they would probably overlook, um, some of the -- um, some of the good qualities in people.  I guess I could see where a small business they would -- they see it first hand probably, so, you know?
R:  Yeah, that's what -- kind of what I was thinking, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know, um, because there's like -- if you think about it, in smaller business -- um, the community college setting is smaller --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it's -- it's still the one I was in [MN] -- it's smaller than a university, I mean.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It was still big, because it was in two different cities --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I know that the president was based in one city and um -- president's college and there was a satellite campus in another city --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he really wasn't over at the other campus.  So, he wouldn't know the people over there but yet he was also in charge of hiring.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Um, he always had a say in who got hired.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I was thinking affirmative action wasn't there.  He may think, "Well, I don't need her or him" or -- or something like that.
L:  That's true, yeah.
R:  That make sense?
L:  Yeah, that definitely makes sense.
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah.  I -- I guess it all just goes back to -- yeah, if they're -- you know, if they're not really involved in the -- with the hiring process -- I mean, if they're involved in the hiring process but not as involved with the day to day --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, tasks and so forth.  Yeah, I guess that -- that is pretty important.
R:  I think you said that better than I could.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I don't know about that.
R:  [LAUGH] [COUGH]
L:  I don't know.
R:  [COUGH] Excuse me.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that makes sense.  Yeah, definitely.
R:  And I think about, um, like those big companies like Horizon or oil companies or gas companies or --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like they have places all over -- don't they have it all over the world or something like that?
L:  Mhm.  I think so.
R:  Can you imagine if they just based people on who they like?
L:  That's true, if they just hired, um, white males [MN] that look --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that look nice. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's true.
R:  Or -- yeah, or depending on who -- who was doing the hiring, what they'd prefer.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true, actually.  Definitely.
R:  Because I mean -- what in the fifties or sixties it was usually a white male?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But the other thing I think of is, as long as they don't take it to the other extreme, like hire only minority people and ignore
