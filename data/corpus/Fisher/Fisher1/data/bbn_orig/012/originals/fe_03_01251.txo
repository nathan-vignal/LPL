L:  Hi, I'm Michelle.
R:  Hi, I'm Lisa.
L:  How are you doing?
R:  Good.  Um, gosh what was it?  Oh, movies.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I think I'd rather stay home.
L:  That's what I'd rather do.  Definitely. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Um, what was the last movie you saw?
L:  Um, in a theatre or at home?
R:  I guess either one. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, at home probably, ah, Willie Wonka And The Chocolate Factory. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I love that one.
L:  Yeah, it's one of my favorites.
R:  It's kind of scary though, for kids.
L:  Huh?
R:  It's kind of scary for kids though.
L:  Yeah, it can be if they're too young.
R:  Yeah, because my kids, you know, at first we're like, "Oh!" my youngest. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  But he was younger then.  I think our last one was, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Master Of Disguise.
L:  I haven't seen that one.
R:  Well, it's not really that great of a movie --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it's just -- it's -- but kids love it.
L:  Yeah, I think my step son liked that one.
R:  Because my kids are thirteen and ten.
L:  Like my step son's eleven, so I guess that's [several inaudible words] an age range there.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, the boys they loved it, you know?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Because you know, it had guy stuff in it and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you turn into a turtle and stuff.
L:  Ah, that -- that had that -- that had that, ah, Saturday Night Live guy in it, didn't it?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It wasn't -- but it's not worth, you know, going and seeing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I borrowed it from a friend. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah.
R:  I --
L:  So, what was the last one you saw in a theatre?
R:  Oh, gosh.  You know, I don't remember.
L:  Yeah, I think it's been awhile for me too.  I think -- I think Blade Two, was probably the last one I saw in a theatre.
R:  Yeah.  I don't think I went.  I don't -- gosh, my kids went -- have seen some with their dad, like Star Wars, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- those they have to go to and also buy the video tape.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What was the other question?  I forgot.
L:  Um, so did I. [LAUGH]
R:  [inaudible]
L:  I know they were -- they -- they were asking about movies, whether you'd rent a -- rather rent them or go to the theatre --
R:  And then there was --
L:  -- and what was the last you saw and --
R:  And then there was something else.
L:  Yeah --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and I can't remember what it was either.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um ...
R:  Oh, well. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um --
L:  I don't know.  Did it have anything to do with like the price of it?  No.
R:  No.
L:  Um, I have no idea.
R:  I don't think I've seen a movie since we were dating -- in a theatre. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, wait -- wait I've had -- wait, when my kids were younger, Lion King.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, those are good to g- -- the animated ones are good to see in a theatre.
R:  Yeah, they were -- they were two and four.
L:  Ah.
R:  So, um, it was that long ago and I think if it had of lasted a few minutes longer, my kids would have been running up and down the aisle.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, that movie was kind of bad too, because it had my oldest one talking about death.
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  So --
L:  -- that would bring that up.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We go to the drive in sometimes.  We like doing that.
R:  Oh, wow.  You have a drive in?  That's cool.
L:  Yeah, well it's about like forty minutes away from our house, but ...
R:  Oh, that's neat.  I remember doing that as a kid with my parents. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, what did we go and see?  I think we saw -- gosh, Star Wars, the first -- you know, the first time it came out.
L:  Oh, the very first one?
R:  Yeah, way back when.
L:  Yep. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um, yeah that would be neat -- that would be neat, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it -- it is, because especially, you know, if the kids get tired, you know, they just fall asleep in the back of the van and ...
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, that would be cool to do, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's -- it's like the movies though now, it's like PG thirteen some of the stuff's really, really bad.  PG some of the stuff's really bad.
L:  Right.
R:  But I -- you know, it's like, you know, it's -- some of the stuff -- my kids are older now, so it's not as bad as what, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but still it kind of shocked me, some of the stuff, you know? [SIGH]
L:  I know.  Yeah, we -- yeah, because we went to the -- last time we went to the drive in, one of the -- the movies was, ah, um, Scary Movie Two --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and we didn't know it was going to be anything like it was --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and we had, ah, my step son who's eleven and we had our nephew who's thirteen with us and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it just had a lot of racy, ah, segments to it and --
R:  Yeah.  Well --
L:  -- it was kind of out there.
R:  Even PG movies do now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I know like in nineteen eighty four they didn't have like PG thirteen --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but um, it's like -- I sometimes go on sites like Screen It --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and read up on the movie, but they're getting older now so, you know, I try and talk to them about what they see. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  We don't use those words at home. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, definitely not.
R:  But um, I don't know, some of the -- I mean, some of the movies like Clue -- the movie Clue --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it had a lot of cleavage in it. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  You know, but it was a still a good movie, you know?
L:  Yeah and you d- -- you really don't know too, how much the kids notice either, because sometimes things that all -- you know, see on the screen and I'll be ga- -- be gasping at --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, "Ooh, oh my God I can't believe they're seeing that" and they don't even notice, you know?
R:  Well, yeah like with Lion King when it had the word that it spelt out sex or something that time?
L:  Oh, I didn't hear about that.
R:  Oh, yeah the smoke, it sm- -- there was one part in Lion King where the smoke, if you look at it real closely it spells out sex --
L:  Really?
R:  -- drifting off.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  And no one noticed -- so- someone noticed it, but you don't notice it through just watching and not looking for it --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- but if you're watching and looking for it, you notice it, it's like an S and then a E and then a X. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my gosh, I'm going to have to go and watch that again now. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, at some part in it, so you know, you have to go back and watch it and then you start picking up on more things, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But that's kind of Disney's trick, you know, some of the stuff they've --
L:  Yeah, I never heard of that one.
R:  -- done.
L:  I've heard of things like that, but I never heard of that one.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Like the Little Mermaid.
L:  What's in the Little Mermaid.
R:  They redesigned the case on the Little Mermaid. [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, because those -- sandcastle or something, my friend had it, it looked like a -- a man's private --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- part.  Yeah.
L:  Wow. [LAUGH]
R:  So, they redesigned the case.  My friend has one of the old cases and I went, "Oh, my goodness".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  But it's not obvious because it's kind of hidden.  [several inaudible words] tell me what else Disney's pulled. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I guess not.  Gosh, I hadn't heard either one of those.
R:  Yeah.  Well, we rent them sometimes like at Blockbuster [several inaudible words] rent em for free --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or we borrow movies.  Now we're getting into the DVD movies.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, where you get all the extras on it?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Those are fun.
L:  Some of the -- some of the extras are pretty nice but then sometimes -- I don't know, the extras -- the deleted scenes --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- you got to be careful with some of those sometimes.
R:  Oh, okay.  I haven't gotten into that yet, but dad's been looking at it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But um --
L:  Some of those have like extra scenes on there that really aren't quite appropriate. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That should have not made it to the extra. [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, we we- -- see we bought the DVD Blues Brothers --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it was like a special one and it was very, very, um, expensive plus it was -- you know, it had a lot of stuff in it, but it was like, "Wow" --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- and then on the outside case it said Not Rated and --
L:  I've seen that -- yeah, some of the DVDs they sell are the unrated versions.
R:  Yeah, it says Not Rated and then when I open it up inside it says PG thirteen, I'm like, "Huh".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "Great". [LAUGH]
L:  Wow, that's weird.
R:  But I think I like DVD, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  They -- oh, my kids saw Spy Kids Two, that was good, that had some cool stuff on it kind of.
L:  I haven't seen that one either.
R:  I didn't think my kids would want to see it since they were older --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but um, they enjoyed it.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  So, you know?
L:  Yeah, we're getting to that age where they're kind of in between whether they want to see their kid movies and the more adult kind of movies.
R:  Yeah, but it had so much action -- it's I think why they liked it, you know?
L:  Yeah, that -- that's what my step son's into, he looks all the -- like the ninja fighting kind of movies and --
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah my kids are into Power Rangers big time.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, we ha- -- we have Pokemon movies too.
L:  Oh, okay.  [inaudible] --
R:  But --
L:  -- he liked those, ah, about a year ago, now I think he thinks he's beyond those or something, I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, my kids, you know, there are some movies they're beyond but mom's not.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Like Willie Wonka And The Chocolate Factory.
L:  Yeah, I'm -- I've got a two year old and a five month old and I'm just waiting until they're ready to see that one.  It's like one of my all time favorites.
R:  Yeah, or -- and Chitty Chatty Bang Bang enter my mind too.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I didn't see that movie until I was working in day care --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I saw part of it showing it to the kids and then I took it home. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But the movies, like, you know, they have so much action now, like, um, the one movie that I watched when I was a kid Escape To Witch Mountain --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that I was kind of explaining to my kids, this was like my Harry Potter back then --
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  -- and so I got it for the kids and we watched it.
L:  Did they like it?
R:  It was so boring. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, I kept saying, "Oh, it's going to get better.  It's going to get better" and it's like --
L:  It never did. [LAUGH]
R:  -- there's no action in it like what they watch now, you know?
L:  Yeah, there's so many special effects and -- and different thing- -- film angles and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all that in the movies now.
R:  Yeah, I was like, "Oh, my goodness my kids will never watch another movie I bring home like this". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  Because it was neat to me back then, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But um [SIGH] now it's the movies like Harry Potter and all its special effects --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  We haven't seen Harry Potter Two.
L:  I -- I saw it but I didn't really get to pay too much attention, because my youngest one was kind of fussing around at the time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, but I read -- I read all the books.  I -- books are better than the movies, in my opinion. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  If there -- if there's a book to a movie --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I mean not all of them do have books, but like, ah -- like all the Stephen King movies --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the books are always better.
R:  Yeah, because you can imagine like more stuff in it.
L:  Right.
R:  Like we saw -- we've been reading the book Left Behind and the -- that -- we didn't like the tape as much or the movie as much --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- as the books, because you can imagine what these people look like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then when you actually see the movie and they're not looking like, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like what you imagine, it's like, "Oh, how disappointing". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and I mean sometimes they'll change things too, because they can't -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're not able to be filmed that way or it would take up too much time of the movie or things like that and they change it and then it makes you f- -- kind of feel cheated
