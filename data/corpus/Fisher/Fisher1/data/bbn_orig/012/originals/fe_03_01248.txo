R:  Oh, hi I'm Louis.
L:  Hi, I'm Ken.  What was your name, Millar?
R:  Louis.  L.O.U.I.S.
L:  Oh, Louis.
R:  Louis.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You're --
L:  Where are you from?
R:  -- Ken.  Ah, LA.
L:  Oh, so I'm not --
R:  California.
L:  Well, I'm not that far, Ventura.
R:  Oh, okay.  Oh.
L:  County, Camario.  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  All right. [MN] Have you done one of these [LAUGH] before?
R:  Oh, no.  I -- I -- this -- this is the first one.  I lost my PIN --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and, ah, I just barely found it.
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] okay.
R:  So, ah, I don't know, have you?
L:  No, this is my first one too.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Just -- ah, it wasn't convenient for me before, every time they called.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  So, I guess we're supposed to talk about c- affirmative action --
R:  O- --
L:  -- in hiring, mm.
R:  Affirmative action in hiring --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- hiring.
L:  Right.
R:  Okay.  Well, go ahead. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I, um --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I guess I feel that, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that affirmative action in hiring is not necessary.  I -- I'm a believer that the best qualified candidate should be the one that gets hired.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I think there should be procedures in place to ensure that someone is not, of course, discriminated against because of their race or, um, their, ah, oh gender or religion.  But I don't think somebody should have an advantage because of th- that very thing.
R:  [MN] Right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay.  Well, I feel the same way too.
L:  Oh, well that makes it easy. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, the only thing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think -- it's, ah, affirmative action --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- ah, I don't know when it was established, but the law was what, in the sixties or something, when, ah, you know, when it was necessary --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to get more, ah, variety of, ah -- or people that were at a disadvantage, like, ah, I don't know, I guess the blacks, Hispanics --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- whoever.  Um, and, ah, into the colleges and stuff, I g- -- and job place.  So, I guess it was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- important back then, but now it's kind of, ah, run its -- run its, ah -- its term.
L:  Yeah, as I understand it the law has changed.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, I know -- I'm retired now --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but where I used to work which was for a city
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, they didn't have quotas.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Ah, they had to do reporting and what not, but there wasn't like a quota system where they were expected to hire so many --
R:  [MN] Mhm.
L:  -- um, it was kind of -- again, ah, there was affirmative action but not saying that you need to hire someone because of their race or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, other factors, it was, um, if -- if it -- I guess what happens is that they report on the number -- ah, the numbers in the work place and if you're falling down in a particular category then you have to take steps to do better recruiting.  Not -- not so much the hiring side, but you have to find out, "Well, why aren't we hiring more blacks or more Hispanic or more women?" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then they say, "Well, maybe it's because we're not advertising in the right place or, um, you know, doing the -- the upward mobility hiring -- ah, promoting our people from within the way we should" things like that.  So, um --
R:  [MN] That was the -- that's what you know of it left --
L:  That's the current -- that's the current situation, yeah --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- when I left there and that's -- that's the way it is now, yeah, which to me it makes sense but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, you can look at your -- your -- your mix and sometimes it's that the explanation is simply that, you know, depending on the community that you, ah, that -- that the -- the work place is located in there just aren't the -- tho- -- the people that are not -- not going to apply no matter what you do because they're not going to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to drive in from far distances to get there.  So, that's something else they have to look at, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  Well, it's very --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- the whole thing is really complicated.  I think it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- well, there can be two issues [inaudible] with the, ah -- the work place is one --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- and then there -- and then just like the schools, like into the ivy league colleges and stuff --
L:  Well, yeah -- yeah, that --
R:  -- is another thing.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, the schools -- that's a real big issue of course here in California, as you probably know of -- ah, what the situ- -- where they did have affirmative action but then they -- they basically stopped --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, ah, they don't -- they don't give any particular advantage to anyone based again on their, ah -- on their race.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  It's just -- I have a son that's just accepted at UCLA so I know --
R:  Oh, really?  Oh.
L:  -- pretty much about that, yeah.
R:  Oh.  W- --
L:  Are you far out of school yourself or -- sounds like you're kind of young?
R:  Um, yeah.  Well, I've just got out of college and, um -- but I'm thirty three, but I have --
L:  Oh.  Mhm.
R:  -- multiple degrees.  But --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Where'd -- where'd you go to school?
R:  Um, all over the place.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm an artist I went to, ah [LAUGH] -- I went to, ah, Fullerton, I went to County, I went to, ah, LA Trade Tech, I went to, ah, design school and -- so, all of the, um -- I went to some private colleges and then I went --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- some -- some community colleges, um, and I never had to go to university or anything because ah, I didn't want to, ah -- to go --
L:  Interesting, y- --
R:  -- like that, yeah.
L:  My son actually is a pretty good artist but he does- -- ah, doesn't want to pursue it.  Ah, I try to get him to go to that school in Valencia -- the California Art Institute I think it's called.  Have you heard of that?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah, they had a summer program, but he just got to a certain level or a certain, ah -- well, he just decided that he didn't want to pursue it anymore after taking it in high school and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- kind of got tired of it.  It's too bad.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's a --
L:  But as -- as I -- it is a tough -- tough field to make any money in, I'm sure.
R:  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's tough, but I mean -- I mean, if you really want to do it, there's ways to make money --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a lot of people get sc- -- get scared because of, um, you know, the old, ah, adage that, you know, it's going -- you're going to be poor and living on the street --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but you'd be am- amazed how much, ah -- just like graphic designers --
L:  Yeah, I was just going to say on the computer end of it and graphics and things, yeah.
R:  Yeah, everything's computers now.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  So, even though you do, um, an art, you have to go back to school --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then learn how to do it to -- with the computers.  But ah --
L:  Right.  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, it's a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- good question, because like I'm -- um, affirmative action has to do with, um -- with, um -- I don't know, maybe you can explain it to me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like as far as like the work place --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- say if you had -- if I was going to get a job as an artist to this one place and then they turn me down [MN] and then I said, "Well, they did it because of my -- because I'm Hispanic or something" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then I can have -- I can use the, ah, federal law to sue em.
L:  Well, yeah.  Yeah, but I mean you have to -- the -- you have to have some proof, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's pretty hard to prove, but yeah if -- if there was something that happened during the interview process --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where somebody made a derogatory comment obviously or something else happened that -- you know, where you could prove that you didn't get hired because of your race.  But you know, normally that's -- it's tough to do that.
R:  Oh, [inaudible].
L:  If you're a woman, it's a little bit easier, because you know, depending on the questions they ask you -- if they start asking you personal questions like, um, are you pregnant or do you expect to be pregnant, you know, those kind of things, ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that -- that could get them in a lot of trouble, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I don- --
R:  Well, I don't know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I was thinking about that, because what I go an- -- because ah, my whole family's all into the -- to the -- into the clothing business --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in LA --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, [MN] you know we're all artists and I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- was training to, ah, make clothes and then design and all that so I can be, ah --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- you know, at that level instead of, you know, constructing them all the time.  But I went to like a lot of job interviews with big companies and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- most of the people there are, um, you know, women --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then, um, I'd say ninety percent of the people that work for the apparel companies in -- are women and there's only like ten percent are -- are men.  You know, the men are mostly, um, in the corporate side --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, the attorneys and stuff like that and the executives.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but in the design field, there's only a few guys and most of the, you know, are -- are homosexual, right?
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  So, a lot of the time when I got to the job interview --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they can tell --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm not.
L:  Okay.
R:  But -- and I'm feeling a lot of prejudice against them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, a lot of those -- those, ah -- and that's what I've started to think about now, is affirmative action --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and all that kind of stuff.  They did apply, um -- you know, would it apply -- apply in my case.  Or would it apply if -- if -- only an extreme, like --
L:  Yeah.  Again, you'd have to prove -- and that's why usually nowadays if -- when you go in for your interviews, they have more than one person interviewing you --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- at least they do in government.  They always have a panel of two or three and ev- -- we even recorded the interview.  Now --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- private sector, they probably don't do that as much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But again, you -- you would have to bring charges and you'd have to prove that, you know, you didn't get the job -- you were the most qualified and you didn't get it because they picked someone else based on their gender or race or something of that nature.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's pretty hard to prove, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Well, I was just wondering if -- if, ah --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  That's my understanding anyhow, yeah.
R:  Yeah, because it's g- -- could be kind of like tricky there, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know, I -- that's just a bit like built in prejudice --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that I know that they already have.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They just think that for some reason that the, ah -- the gay guys are more creative.
L:  Oh, gee. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I just --
L:  Watching too much Will and Grace or something, huh?
R:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but it's a stereotype, because --
L:  Stereotyping.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah and then it -- it -- I didn't think nothing of it while --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I was -- because you know, my family's into it, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when you start going for job interviews and then you're up to -- ah, against these guys and then you're just a straight guy and then you walk in there with -- you know, dressed normally and like, you know, you're not dressed, you know, like really flamboyant or anything, but you're a very creative artist and you're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- good at what you do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they tend to -- they tend to like look at you like, you know, that you're -- you're not even -- you know, I'll -- I might as well
