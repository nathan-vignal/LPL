L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, how much does it -- er, how much does it cost?
L:  Usually a computer game will cost about fifty or sixty dollars, but you can get them a lot cheaper than that by buying them on eBay.  Do you ever buy anything on eBay?  [LAUGH] No? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, oh, um, oh, I see.  So ...
L:  No. [LAUGH]

R:  Ah, yes.
L:  Mm.  I don't know.  Probably not if you use good light, you know.  Um, I don't think they would, you know.  At least, my eyes are okay so far. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, actually I know, um, many of my classmates --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- play, uh, computer games --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the games is about the martial arts or something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, um, li- like b- building a country, uh, building a country from -- from the primi- primitive society to a modern society.
L:  Oh, that sounds like Civilization, yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah, yes.
L:  Yeah, it sounds --
R:  And, uh, [MN] and they spend a lot of time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, in playing the game.
L:  Yeah.  But you don't like them. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Uh, I don't like them because it sometimes, um -- actually I -- I was born in China and, um --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- some, um -- at that time they -- they don't have their, uh, own personal computer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They just -- uh, they play -- play the game in the -- how to say?  In the -- in school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, in the computer cluster of the university.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And sometimes they, um, play overnight.
L:  All night long, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, yeah.  And the -- yes.
L:  Uh-huh.  My daughter's, um, studying Chinese, and she's thinking about going to China.  That's interesting.

L:  Yeah, she's gonna go --
R:  So, for how old is he -- uh, is she?
L:  She's, um, twenty now, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Uh, pardon?
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  She -- she's twenty?
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, she's -- she wants to go to China.  She's going to France next year, but [MN] um, then she wants to study abroad and go to China, too.  It's kinda scary, you know, [LAUGH] going to ...
R:  Oh, oh, oh.  So, um, so you must, uh, uh, be over forty years old?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  But barely, forty one, yeah.
R:  Forty one?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, but -- but I -- I think y- your English is very good.
L:  Well, thank you. [LAUGH]
R:  But is English your, uh, second language?
L:  Mhm.
R:  But --
L:  You mean, is it my second language?  No, no.
R:  No?  It's your native language?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, of course. [LAUGH]
L:  Of course, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But, um, from the, um, from this, uh, speaking program --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I can -- I think it is -- I should speak to a person whose -- whose native language is n- -- is not English.
L:  Mhm. I -- you know, I don't know how they decide, you know, who -- who to join or anything, but your English is very good also.
R:  No, no. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't speak English very much. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Really? [LAUGH]
R:  So, yeah.  So, um ...
L:  But it's -- it sounds pr- -- it's pretty good, yeah.  Um, uh, Crystal would have enjoyed talking to you.  She could've tried -- tried out some Chinese, yeah.
R:  Oh, yes.  So -- so -- so -- so where are you from?
L:  [LAUGH] It's a difficult language to learn.  It's very difficult, Chinese is, yeah.  Yeah, but, uh --
R:  Um.
L:  At least for English people anyway, you know, it's difficult to learn.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Well, I don't know if we're supposed to, um, keep talking till they interrupt or are we -- are we free to, um, end our conversation at any time, do you know?
R:  Uh, I don't know because, uh, this is the first time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that I speak to --
L:  Me too, yeah.
R:  Yeah, yes.  Because I signed -- signed up very long ago.
L:  Me too, yeah.
R:  Oh, yes, but usually on weekends I -- I don't be at home.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I -- I'm not at home.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, because, um, uh, I -- and I -- the -- the -- the time I signed [inaudible] on weekends to, uh, ten pm to twelve pm.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, at that time I usually am -- am at my university.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, this -- this is the first time that I speak to another person.  Yeah.
L:  Okay, well, you know, I think -- I think that we can probably ...
R:  Probably.
L:  I think we can probably let each other go because I don't think that there -- it's all -- it's all, like, computerized, and I don't think they're going to tell us the time's up or anything.  I -- I -- I think, I'm not sure.  But, uh, what do you think? [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE] Uh, I don't know because, um, I -- I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, I think, uh, we should have be -- supposed to speak for, uh, an hour.
L:  Are we?
R:  Oh, yes, uh ...
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But I don't know.  All right, well, perhaps we can quit the conversation, and the [inaudible] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they can make another arrangement. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't -- I -- I -- I'm not sure.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because I will try. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay, an hour, huh?
R:  Yes.
L:  Mhm.  Okay.
R:  I -- I'm not sure.  B- but it's -- it's my, uh, memory, uh, from my mem- memory I guess.
L:  Yeah.  It's been a long time since I signed up, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and I -- I really had thought I wasn't gonna get any calls 'cause it had been --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- so long since I signed up.  But then they started this weekend, so ...
R:  I -- I signed up this program about last year.
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  So -- so about, I guess, more than three months.
L:  Hm.
