R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm Debbie[?].
L:  Hi, Debbie, I'm Bree[?].
R:  Bree. I -- I'm for Georgia.
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, well, um, I'm fr- -- calling from, ah, Canada.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  So, I don't really know what's wrong with the American school system. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] well, does Canada have, um, public school system?
L:  Oh, yes.  Yeah, we do.  Um, but, um, I don't know, I mean, how are -- how are --
R:  All right.
L:  -- you guys?
R:  Well, um, I --
L:  What is the biggest problem you think the States have?
R:  I mean, do you -- um, the [several inaudible words] mostly the kids go to public school there?
L:  Yes, most of them do --
R:  Okay.
L: -- and -- but right now --
R:  And it's pretty good?
L:  Well, we're always complaining about, um, there's too many kids in the classrooms now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the teachers are never very happy.
R:  Ach.
L:  Nah.
R:  Well, I would say here in the US probably the -- the biggest problem that we have is that the teachers no longer have control over the classrooms.
L:  Oh, they don't?
R:  No, because they, um -- they, you know -- they -- it's -- you're not allowed to punish the kids --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um [NOISE] you know, there's so many differences of opinion, um, I guess based on religion an -- and [NOISE] I don't know, and maybe the baby boomer generation. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um --
L:  I never thought of it that way.
R:  -- but you know, we've had several -- I mean, quite a few school shootings --
L:  Ooh --
R:  and --
L:  Oh yeah, that's right.
R:  Mm.  Yeah, like Co- Columbine.
L:  Yeah.
R:  An -- so how would -- how -- do the chil- -- do the teachers have control up there in Canada?
L:  Well, I think the -- I think generally they do, um, but I think that's probably because, um, I don't know, things don't seem to be as violent.  I think the kids up here feel more pressure to get into, um, a really good university and I think that might have -- make them [LAUGH] --
R:  Make a difference.  Yeah.
L:  Make them a lot more nervous, but I don't so much about, ah, being violent, but, um --
R:  Yeah.  Well, see the kids here, I don't know, this generation of children, I don't see where -- I think it's have fun first and worry, you know, about your grades [LAUGH] later.
L:  Oh, I never thought of it that way.
R:  And the only other thing is, um [NOISE] now that -- well, the Federal government has cut funding to that states --
L:  Mhm.
R:  --um, because of the increasing Federal Reserve, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, the deficit.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] and, um, the states are now -- they have it on their own, which of course the richer states can, you know, have more to spend on the kids, the, um, poorer states have less.  For an example --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- we used to live -- well, our home is in South Carolina in Charleston --
L:  Ah!
R:  -- and South Carolina is a -- considered a poor state --
L:  Mhm.
R:  The poorest, um, Southern state.
L:  Right.
R:  I think you're probably like [SIGH] -- on the education realm they must be maybe two or three from the bottom.
L:  Mhm.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and the -- and there's kids just, um [NOISE] -- I don't know, I think that w- we feel there's still concern down in the South more about, um, the black white issue --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the black kids and the white kids still, for some reason [SIGH], you know, don't -- aren't best of friends or, you know --
L:  Right.
R: -- they don't see each other as, you know, [inaudible] or friends -- you know, good friends.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, I think that has a lot problems where --
L:  Ah.  Well, I -- I -- I think up here one of the problems that might also just be because, um, do you know, there's so much, um -- I mean, I don't know how it was when you were going to school, but when I seem to -- when I was young, last century --
R:  When did you graduate?
L:  [SIGH] A long time ago, but um --
R:  What year?
L:  Oh, from high school?  Um, hm eighty --
R:  I was --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  Oh, well I'm even worse than that, I was in seventy four -- seventy two I graduated from high school.
L:  Oh, b- -- I mean, when you went to high school did -- didn- high school, for you, start at like, I don't know eight thirty or nine in the morning --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it end at three?
R:  Yes.
L:  And you went between -- you know, you -- you usually went I think nine months or whatever --
R:  Exac- --
L:  But now all my teachers -- all my friends who are teachers also, are complaining because some of the schools now start at eight and they go until two and some of them -- schools start at, you know, nine and go until four and some of them are on these wacky systems where there's seventeen weeks on and three weeks off and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they just --
R:  Oh, where they go -- they go to work all or they have to work all year, the teachers?
L:  Oh -- and yeah, and there's some of them -- yeah, some of the teachers -- some of the school boards have gone to all year school boards now.  I don't know, if you're a student and you're moving from one school board to another school board, that can't be [LAUGH] very easy.  I can't figure out how all these kids are learning the same amount of stuff in the same amount of time, if they've got all these different school schedules.
R:  They -- yeah, you're right they -- I don't think they could.
L:  No.
R:  You're right.  And then like if they start at eight and don't, um -- and finish at the same time --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as the one that starts seven or seven thirty, they're getting less edu- -- they have to be getting less education, any way you look at it. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, I -- and I think actually one of my -- one my, ah, teacher friends was telling me that the actual problem is not so much with the school boards, it's with the bus companies -- the bus scheduling companies --
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  -- because of the busses.
R:  Yeah, we're having bus problems too.
L:  Yeah, so I think, um, I think that might have something about it -- oh and also I -- I just think a lot of kids, you know, they just -- they're, you know -- they're either -- they're more concerned with other things, like, I don't know, being slim and shopping or they've got -- a lot of the kids in her class have second jobs or -- or first jobs and they're working more than fifteen hours a week --
R:  In high school?
L:  -- which means they come -- in high school, which means they're coming to class and they're tired or they come in the class and they haven't been able to do their homework, because they've got these other jobs.  But I don't know it -- it's --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- very interesting.
R:  Well, they -- ah, the other part of this question is what you can do to solve our problem?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, here in the US, you know, the only thing I can say is -- is to give -- give the teachers the, um -- give 'em back [SIGH] the power --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because -- you know, I don't see them having power.
L:  No.
R:  You know, give the school back the power, um, you know, and let --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- adult -- and the parents back -- to back the teachers, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because I think there's more teacher versus parent than there is -- you know, if you could get the parent and teacher and parent school to unite.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Well, I wish up -- I think up here, I wish my -- my teach- -- my friends were saying that -- she wishes that there were more options, because now every --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- every parent in every school is telling the kids, "You have to go to university.  You have to go to university.  You have to get really good marks, because you have to go to university" and what we're having now is the problem where the universities -- th- -- there just aren't a -- enough places at university.  So, I know --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- when I went to university, I got in with some pretty ach marks, but, um, now to get into a university, I mean, you have to get at least -- at least eighty five percent as a high school, which, you know, is not too ha- -- you know, it -- it's not too hard, but at the same time, I mean, like every single person coming into university has to have at least an eighty five, that is a little bit --
R:  Wow.
L:  f- -- yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Wow.  Um --
L:  So, I feel sorry for these kids, they're under such pressure.
R:  And how much is a univer- -- how much does it cost for a four year education in Canada?
L:  Oh, well when I was going to university in the late eighties I was -- my university tuition per year was about seven hundred US.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  And that -- that's a real -- that's a real, um, four year university, huh?
L:  Yeah.  Oh, actually it was three years, because I --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I went to university in Quebec.  But now I think the average tuition fee for a Canadian university for a -- a whole year is probably around twenty eight -- ah, twenty eight hundred US.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, is it around two thousand?
R:  See, it's -- it's [several inaudible words] oh, between six and eight thousand now.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And even the schools ha- -- um, even the [several inaudible words] schools have, um, started to think if the kids will keep just a, um, passing average --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in a C -- in the Cs [LAUGH] that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the parents, if they put up six thousand dollars --
L:  Oh. [MN]
R:  -- toward when their kids are g- -- graduate- -- you know, like when they hit college --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the state will pay the rest.
L:  Oh.
R:  And they are saying, by the times these kids get in school it's going to be about sixteen or seventeen thousand dollars.
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  And you know, that's awful.
L:  That's -- yeah, that is terrible.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was always amazed when -- when my -- when my, ah -- we're hearing about people who are going to school in the States.  I mean, it was just so expensive.  I mean, I can't imagine -- I can't imagine coming up with that kind of money and I can't -- I certainly ca- --
R:  I wonder what it -- wonder what it is in the Can- -- Canadian school, you know, like public school system --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- up to grade twelve -- twelve, what it is that y'all are doing that we need to do. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I don't know if we're do- -- what we're doing is -- well, I -- you know, it really depends if you look at --
R:  Well, for the kids to have a, you know, right around a B average to go to school
