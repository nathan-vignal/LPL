R:  Hi.  My name's Cindy.
L:  Hi.  My name's Hayley.  [LAUGH] I guess we need to talk about current events.
R:  I guess so.
L:  How we find out about 'em.
R:  Well, I find out about 'em on the internet as well as on TV.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I try to keep up with 'em pretty well.
L:  Yeah.  I do a lot of the same, uh, you know, a lot of times when they come up on the -- the sign in screen on the internet I, you know, get a lot from there, and then watching the news also.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't really, um, have time to read the paper much, so mostly it's --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- through those two sources.
R:  I don't either.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I very rare -- I get the Sunday paper, but I don't -- I don't often even have time to take a look at it when I do get it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, um, I found that, uh, a lot of times, you know, it seems like the internet a lot of times you get news actually faster.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
R:  And it is convenient because you can just pull it up quickly and read through it as opposed to waiting.  One of the channels I watch is CNN and, you know, [NOISE] it repeats every thirty minutes so you do get, you know, the whole feel, kinda, in thirty minutes.  So, that kinda makes it a little easier to get, you know, as much information as possible.
R:  Yeah, this is true.  Um, I watch especially as of late CNN and MSNBC and, uh, I don't -- I kinda go back and forth between 'em, but, uh, they never w- --
L:  There's sure a lot of stuff --
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  I'm sorry, go ahead. [LAUGH]
R:  A- and a lot of times e- especially as of late I -- it's -- it gets a little bit too repetitive.  That's the only bad thing about it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So then I just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I just say, "Okay, it's enough for now" and we'll go turn it off [MN] and come back --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, you know, listen to it later.  But --
L:  Yeah, see what else is -- is -- they've updated on. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  There is sure a lot of stuff going on right now with the war.
R:  That there is.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  And [SIGH] --
L:  Sure a lot of information out there.
R:  And it's just -- I don't know, it -- there is.  Sometimes it's almost an overload.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I've --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- found that I've just -- you know, it's, like, enough, no more for a while.  Just turn everything off.  I don't even want it on for noise.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just turn it off and let it go for a while.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's, like, I'll catch up later.
L:  [LAUGH] Definitely.  Yeah, but, um --
R:  But ...
L:  -- it's kinda interesting how they're doing the coverage with the war and the journalists being right in there on the front line.  I think it's kinda interesting getting to see an insider view, I guess.
R:  Yeah.  It -- that is kinda interesting.  It's -- it's not k- -- I -- I don't know if I'd wanna do it I'd -- if I were them or not. [LAUGH]
L:  That'd be a little scary, yeah, I think, and -- and sometimes it is a little bit too graphic --
R:  Be a lot scary to me.
L:  -- [LAUGH] what we're getting to see.
R:  Um, yeah.  Yeah, because they -- obviously they take out, you know, a bunch of it, I'm sure.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But it was -- it was rather interesting, I didn't realize that some of the bombs that they're using can -- I -- I knew they could be precise but I didn't realize they could be that precise.  It was, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the ones they're -- they use what is it?  La- -- they're using laser and, um, they've got it in the cars.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The GPS, I couldn't think of it.
L:  Yeah, the GPS, yeah.  It's amazing how accurate they can be, but ...
R:  Get within feet, I guess.
L:  Mhm.  And all those -- [SIGH] I just -- it amazes me that the journalists can be where they're at and just through satellite and -- and the technology that's out there, how that's able to be broadcasted back to us.  It -- I think it's kind of amazing just the technology of the whole [SIGH] news, [LAUGH] I guess.
R:  Yes, it is.  Um, I k- -- now I've gotten kinda interested -- it -- that and it also makes you realize that, you know, the time differences.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, it is interesting that you're seeing it nighttime there and --
R:  I -- it -- it's in the middle of the afternoon, it's in the middle of the night there.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.
R:  Um, I mean, n- -- you know that they're different times, it's just you -- I guess you just forget about it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or don't -- don't pay any attention.
L:  Yeah.  You do kinda -- I -- I'm actually originally from New Zealand, so I kinda --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- can relate a little bit to that because, um, when I -- all my relatives live back there except for my immediate family, so when we, you know, call and stuff, you've gotta really think about what time of the day it is for them [NOISE] so you're not waking them up in the middle of the night.  So, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- can kind of relate to that a little bit.
R:  Well, I've got some friends I [SIGH] -- I -- I play some games online every once in a while and, uh, they play for -- they can -- you know, they're for people from all over the world, and I -- they're going, "Well, good morning" --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it's like, "Ah, no, ah, this is kinda late at night" and then we have , you know, "Well, where are you?" --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then we get going back and forth, "Oh, okay, so you're not -- you're not here". [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it is --
L:  I know, it's very interesting.
R:  -- it is kinda interesting.
L:  It is.  It's -- it's neat to kinda think of what somebody else is doing at that time of the day because, you know, they could be sleeping or, you know, it's just totally different circumstance for them. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  And, um, one of my friends is from Brazil.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And so not only is there -- the time difference isn't so much, but the, um, the seasons.
L:  Mhm.
R:  All of that, you know.
L:  Exactly.  For us growing up in New Zealand, it was summer at Christmastime [NOISE] and, uh, coming here -- mhm -- uh, you know, it's a whole different thing to have a white Christmas.  So, that was kinda interesting.  It -- it's kinda neat.
R:  And boy did we.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  I imagine it is, and sounds like you've got some young ones, so --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- they got to -- they got to enjoy some --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some of the white Christmas, too, I imagine.
L:  Yes, they both have.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Their first Christmas had a white Christmas.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  They're keeping me busy. [LAUGH] Press the button.  There you go.
R:  I understand that very well.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Very well.  Mine's --
L:  Do you have children?
R:  I've got one.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  He's -- he's pretty -- pretty much grown up now.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, he's -- well, he thinks he's forever grown up, but, you know.
L:  H- how old is he?
R:  Sixteen.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, yeah, they -- at that age they -- they're grown up.  They don't wanna be bothered with us [LAUGH] but ...
L:  [LAUGH] Starting to get pretty independent, I'm sure.
R:  Yeah.  And, in fact, the other day he had -- I forgot what he was -- what he was -- he was looking up something on the compu- -- you know, on the computer, and he sent me a link to a couple of si- -- of websites --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, that had, like, cu- -- I guess, like, current events, something like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on 'em that I hadn't even -- you know, I usually deal with going to, you know, MSNBC or -- or something like that, but he -- he showed me another one which offered a totally different point of view.  And I thought, "Well, that's kind of" --
L:  Hm.
R:  I thought -- at first I thought, "Well, that's kinda weird" but --
L:  Well --
R:  -- then I got -- I stopped and thought about it and then it's, like, wait a minute, this is -- you know, actually it's kinda neat that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that they're doing that.  Some p- -- you know, [SIGH] I've seen a bunch of websites, though, that have got cad- -- you know, all condemning the war.  I'm not real impressed with it per se but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they -- I guess they need -- they need to stop him.  And --
L:  Yeah.  I mean, something needs to be done and [MN] -- well, now these people protesting --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I -- it's really not helping anything, you know, because it's not gonna stop the war.
R:  No.
L:  It's already in place and something has to be done.  It's not like we can just quit.  You know, then we -- there'll be a lot more terrorist stuff, so they need to may- maybe just focus on the fact that our troops need support, you know, because it has happened and we kinda have to get behind them.
R:  It's not gonna -- I -- it's not gonna go away.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  I mean, it's not gonna go away till he goes away.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And unfortunately [SIGH] it kinda -- you know, he's been so un- -- he -- he's been so uncooperative and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- deceitful or it seem like -- seems like it to me, and [SIGH] it's not gonna stop, you know, until they -- until they find him.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And either --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- either they'll kill him or, [MN] you know, they'll -- hope maybe they'll put him in prison, not that it'll do any good.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  D- -- so, have they found out any more?  I haven't really seen anything lately on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the fact of whether they kinda have any idea of his location or anything.  Obviously -- did --
R:  Well, I don't know.
L:  Do they feel like they -- no?
R:  I haven't -- I haven't heard anything as of, you know, whether they found, you know, found him or --
L:  Because originally they had thought maybe, you know, they did get his -- the target of where he was, which was [NOISE] really unbelievable because I thought there's no way that he's gonna -- he's gonna hide.  I mean, he's been hiding all this time.  There's no way that -- it would just be so unbelievable that they could find him that easily and be able to take him out as quickly as, you know, it was originally kinda talked about.
R:  Well, I guess maybe they've got spies, too, just like us.
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, we've got spies in every -- I mean, in different places.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I guess they can, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  That'd be great, though, if they could just --
