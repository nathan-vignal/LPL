L:  Hello, my name is Shannon Doa[?].
R:  Hi, I'm Paula Price[?]. [PAUSE] Hello?
L:  Hello?  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  That's okay.  So, I guess we're supposed to talk about affirmative action.
L:  Affirmative action in the hiring in the workplace.  Wow.
R:  Really.
L:  Deep conversation topic.  What are your thoughts on this whole thing?
R:  Well, [SIGH] as a woman, um, I think it's -- it's important, maybe not so much now as it was several years ago, because so much of it has been done at this point.  Um, I know back when I was younger, it was very important to me because I was trying to get into a job that had predominantly been all men --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I was flat out told, you know, "We really don't want to give you the job but they're telling me that we have to".  Ah, because they didn't think I could do it, because it was a physical job.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, I was trying to -- I was a -- working for the phone company and I was applying to be, um, a telephone installer and --
L:  Well, how physical is that?
R:  Well, you got to climb poles and ...
L:  Connect a couple of wires, make a couple of cuts.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I --
L:  Doesn't sound too strenuous. [LAUGH]
R:  This was -- um, I was going to be working with pay phones --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and the pay phone itself is like -- weighed fifty pounds and it was in the Washington DC area and a lot of them were going on to construction sites.  So, yeah, I mean -- and you're talking, oh goodness, twenty years -- twenty five years ago too.
L:  Mm.
R:  But ah, you know, I -- the position had to be filled by a white woman, bottom line.  They wouldn't take anybody else.  They wouldn't fill it with a guy, they wouldn't fill it with a black woman.  And, um, the guy came right out -- they -- the supervisor came right out and told me, "I really don't want to do this, because I don't think you could handle it.  But --"
R:  Huh.
L:  -- I'll give you a shot".  You know.  So, at the time it was good for me, um, and I think that's how a lot women finally got into these jobs that have predominantly been al- all men.  They were forced to do it, you know, the powers that be.  The people that did the hiring were forced to, they didn't have a choice.  And I don't think women would be where they are today if -- if that wasn't the case.  And I think that --"
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that the same holds true for the black population, you know, they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they went through the same thing.

L:  Oh, I think it extends definitely beyond just black people, white people, men and women.  I mean, it'd -- it definitely has to include everybody in the broad scope of humans, you know, I mean even children.  Because ah, there's definitely ageism out there as well.  I mean, elderly people sometimes have a hard time finding a job because of the fact that they're -- they have to switch gears in their -- in their, ah, careers.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  I mean, to be a fifty seven year old man well into a -- an established career and then all of a sudden to have it pulled out from under him, you know, his odds of getting a job are just as slim as somebody who's twenty three years old and just out of college, you know?
R:  Right.  No, I agree.
L:  Except [several inaudible words] probably going to get beaten out for that job for that twenty three year old.
R:  Right.  You know, there comes a point where they have to look at not just their age, but what experience they bring with them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  And unfortunately the older population, you know, they don't have -- or don't have the possibility of the l- -- the longevity on the job like a --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- younger person would.
L:  Exactly.
R:  But um, you know, they bring so much more experience with them than the younger person could possibly bring, that hopefully the -- the experience would outweigh, "Yes, you know, we might only have him, you know, with us for five years or ten years --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- until they retire" but -- so --"
L:  Hello?
R:  Ha- have you experienced any of it yourself, as far as anything that you've been after personally?
L:  Mm.  I can't really say that I could tell if I had.  I mean, honestly I'm a young kid that, ah -- I'm -- I'm twenty five and I change jobs fairly regularly, ah -- actually, this past year I, ah, had the same job for a full year, which is probably the longest in my life so far, and just shifting around and applying for different jobs.  I've never really had a hard time getting a job --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- just because I -- I always know what I'm doing when I get inv- involved in he whole, um, process of getting a job.  I mean, I've definitely put in my time into interviews and application processes and -- that I know how to take care of things now.  Just, ah, being able to make my experiences broad enough that I can apply to a bunch of different places and not having to pigeon hole myself in any one particular area.
R:  Yeah.  Have you -- have you ever thought that you didn't get a particular job because they gave it to somebody else, because they felt they had to?
L:  The thought never crossed my mind.
R:  No?
L:  Nope.  My jobs have usually fallen into skills.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've got kids as young as you are. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But that's okay.  But I just -- you know, I think -- I think affirmative action is important because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it just, um for so long things -- jobs were so stereotyped and -- and people that really could do a good job and -- and were willing to work at it, weren't given the chance.  The -- you know, it -- it had to come about.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just to equal things out, I guess.  [LAUGH] But --
L:  Yeah.  Mm.
R:  Any other thoughts you have on it? [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, honestly --
R:  I was just -- like, I don't know about you, but it's kind of hard talking [inaudible] -- you know, they just throw a topic at you and then expect you to talk to somebody that you don't even know, but.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, yeah I -- I'd have to say that I'm -- I'm disappointed that, um, we've come to this point in the country's history and, ah, evolution of culture and everything, that it still requires a statute and a law to ensure that people get hired based on their skills and experience --
R:  Right.
L:  -- rather than whether they're male or female, you know?  It's pretty disheartening [inaudible] society as a whole to know that people will still do that just because there are assholes like that. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, and --
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  -- and there tend- -- now, because somebody like you had said earlier, you know, like a -- a fifty five year old man losing his job for whatever reason, downsizing, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- businesses closing or whatever --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, you know, that they have to go out there into the work force and compete against the twenty five year olds, like yourself.  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it -- it just seems so unfair that when --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and -- and I'm fifty five myself, you know, we should be looking at --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- okay another ten or fifteen years and -- and we could retire and you're having to start all over again and having a hard time because you have to fight the system, so to speak.  But ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, does this -- do we automatically get cut off after ten minutes, is that the way this works or do you know?
L:  I have no idea how this whole study works, um --
R:  I don't --
L:  Honestly, I think we just keep talking until they tell us to stop or there's this break in the conversation.  I don't know, the- they're recording us right now, I know that.
R:  Is this your first call?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, mine too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I don't really know.  I mean, we've been talking for nine minutes now, so I don't know what we're [LAUGH] sup-  -- whatever we're supposed to do.  But --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- I guess we'll just keep talking.  But ah, I don't know what to talk about now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, I -- I -- affirmative action because I -- like I said, it greatly affected me and a result of -- of me going into that area with the phone company, that has been where I worked my entire working life --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I've drifted away from it periodically, but have always come back to the phone company --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and that's where I am now, [LAUGH] after all these years.  I started out with them when I was eighteen years old and, like I said, I left periodically, had four children and went back and --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- I'm still there now.  I can- -- I moved down here to Florida and the affirmative action thing kind of took over for me again because I -- I had been away from the typical male type jobs and they offered one to me down here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I went back into installation and started climbing telephone poles and digging ditches and doing the whole thing all over again. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.  You climb the poles?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Still?
R:  Oh, no, not now.  No, I -- I haven't done that in -- in twenty some odd years.  But when we first moved down here to Florida, I did, yeah.
L:  Wow, that's impressive.
R:  So, I -- I've done it in the Washington DC area, I've done it down here in Florida --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I've done it
