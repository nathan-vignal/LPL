L:  Hello.
R:  He- -- hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name's Ray.
L:  My name's Crys- -- I'm sorry, what?
R:  My name's Ray.
L:  Ray?  Hi, I'm Crystal.
R:  Hi, Crystal.  How are you? [LAUGH]
L:  Good.  How are you doing?
R:  Good.  This is my first time doing this.
L:  Oh, me too.  I've never gotten through with anybody yet.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Did you try yesterday?
L:  Um, I -- I didn't know what to say for the interview yesterday, so I just didn't do it.
R:  Oh, right.  Um ...
L:  So ...
R:  So, um, so I guess the question is how we get most of our current events?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I'm definitely, uh, glued to my TV.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I --
R:  S- --
L:  -- I watch the TV, but I don't listen to the radio very much, so ...
R:  Yeah, I'm not on the radio at all.  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  The, uh, pretty much -- and -- and some newspaper stuff, but, um, [NOISE] I'm pretty, uh -- I -- I flip channels.  I get a lot of -- especially with all the war coverage, um, doing, uh, mostly CNN, CNBC, but also, uh, CSPAN.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, because they've been a little more objective and, uh, they show BBC news and they also do, uh, really great interviews with people who've written a lot of, uh, books about, uh, the, uh, the Middle East and stuff.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  So, trying to be --
L:  Yeah, we've been -- we've been watching a lot of the news, too, about all the war and we got a favorites list that we put all -- just all the news channels on one list.
R:  Right.
L:  So, we can just sit there and scan each one and ...
R:  Are you on satellite?
L:  Yeah, we are.  We got a dish, so ...
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, so we got a lot of channels.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Um, I'm in Fallbrook[?], California.
R:  Fallbrook?
L:  Yeah.  Where are you?
R:  Oh, um, in Alameda. [NOISE] Like, uh --
L:  Oh, in California?
R:  Yeah, right outside the Bay area.
L:  Oh.
R:  So -- or right in the middle of the Bay area, depending on [LAUGH] ...
L:  Oh, I'm down -- I'm down by, uh, by San Diego.
R:  Oh, okay, cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you're right in the middle of all the, uh, the stuff with, uh, the military and -- and everything there?
L:  Yeah.  Well, Fallbrook is right next to Camp Pendleton[?].
R:  Oh.  Okay, interesting.
L:  So, if you've been keeping up you've about the -- those marines that are from Camp Pendleton?
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  We're right -- right next to the Camp Pendleton.
R:  Oh, right
L:  So ...
R:  So, do you know people that are shipping out and stuff?
L:  Um, I knew one guy personally and he got sent to, um, Kuwait.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I haven't heard from him.  He was just kind of an acquaintance from -- from work.  [SIGH] And, uh, and then -- but we stayed in touch a little bit until he went overseas, and then I haven't heard from him or anything like that.
R:  Right.
L:  But ...
R:  Haven't seen him pop up on a POW list [LAUGH] or anything?
L:  No, no.
R:  Fortunately. [LAUGH]
L:  He -- he's a, um -- [COUGH] he's a sergeant --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and a mechanic, so I'm sure he's pretty busy over there.
R:  Yeah.  The, um -- yeah, it's kind of -- it's kind of freaky, all the stuff, um, but [LAUGH] I feel like -- I feel like we're -- we're probably deviating from what they wanna know, um --
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I was like, uh, so what exactly do you want us to say?
R:  Yeah, I was like, yeah, what do you -- well, how long is it?  Do you know how long this goes on for?
L:  Um, ten minutes.
R:  Ten minutes, okay.  Um --
L:  So, I think we've got, like, seven more minutes to go. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, great.  Okay, fine, that's good.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, the, uh -- as a matter of fact, I just turned on, um -- there's a big thing on -- there's -- I guess there's a lot of criticism [NOISE] -- so, I don't know, I can just flip it on now.  Um, there was a thing on our local news about a bunch of criticism against the media [NOISE] about, uh, [NOISE] the -- the things that they're showing on TV and it -- it's funny because I -- I was just saying that, you know, I feel like the -- the news that we get is so sanitized.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  It's like --
L:  But then look at what the -- they were showing over there about our POWs and all that.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, showing the --
R:  I -- I don't necessarily wanna see, you know, dead bodies or anything, but --
L:  Yeah, or the people that they're torturing or keeping prisoner or, you know, like --
R:  Yeah, there's -- there's a point -- there's a point where it just becomes gratuitous.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, but there's also -- but there's also this fine line between, like, them not being up front with their reporting and --
L:  Yeah, like sugar coating it and everything.
R:  Yeah, and it's just completely like -- I mean, like, if you -- if you get a chance, if you get CSPAN, um, they run BBC news at night, and it's just so much more, like, not a frontal but honest.
L:  Yeah?
R:  It's really just more -- I mean, they -- when they come out and they say, like, you know, we kinda get this big kinda general, you know, "Well, there's been some people killed" you know, like this, and they're like, "Thirty seven people were killed today", you know.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Wh- -- like, flat out.  They're not showing images, you know, but they're reporting it as a factual information.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  Um, so -- so those kind of things.  Um, so it's -- it's a little more -- yeah, like you said, it's like sugar coated for us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  It's like, come on, just tell us for real what's going on.  I mean, you know --
R:  Yeah, I -- yeah, I just -- you know, I don't need to see the --
L:  I mean, we know it's a war.  We can -- we can take it.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's -- and that's that whole thing about how it's just, you know -- I think they -- they do that, too, because, you know, oh, they're afraid that the public opinion's gonna swing the other way and, uh, you know, they're -- they're gonna be up against an even, you know, bigger, you know, media crisis.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, so, um -- but it's interesting.  I just -- I guess I should -- I should be getting into -- more into the newspaper and seeing what they have.
L:  Yeah, I haven't been reading the newspaper at all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My dad has.  He's been -- he's been saving 'em, all the headlines and, you know, all the front pages from all the newspapers.
R:  Right.  'Cause it does -- they do get more in depth.  They, uh, you know -- and in more, um -- it's hard to say objective 'cause everything's owned by all the same media complex it seems.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, especially for us.  I don't know about you guys down there, but it's like all of our -- like, all of -- there's only four -- there's four major radio things here.  Um, so all four -- all four media outlets or all of our media outlets are only owned by four different corporations, the newspapers, the radio and the TV stations.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And in addition to that, they also own, like, all, like, the concert venues [LAUGH] and, uh, the ticketing agencies and the -- you know, all that stuff.  So, it's, like, whatever you listen to on the radio, those are the artists that are gonna be in town, you know, and you have to buy through their agencies and those kind of things.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, it's kinda like this big monopoly, so ...
L:  Yeah.  I was just gonna say that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  So, I think, yeah, I need to start reading the newspaper more and figuring out more about ...  The radio I'm just -- I'm totally fed up with. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I don't listen to the radio any more, so ...
R:  Yeah.  You know, I -- they're like -- even my music stuff, I get everything off the net, yeah.  So ... but, uh --
L:  Yeah, I get everything off our dish.
R:  Right.
L:  They got these great channels that have whatever genre of music you want and they'll --
R:  Right, like D.M.X. satellite -- satellite radio?
L:  Yeah, so you get --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- no commercials.  They tell you who's playing and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so it's pretty cool.  So, it's like I just -- that's how --
R:  I have satellite radio for -- sorry?
L:  Huh?  I'm sorry?
R:  Go ahead.
L:  Oh, well, so that's how I get, you know, like, my new music instead of, you know, usually you listen to the radio and you hear the new stuff that's out, but it's, like, I don't know what's coming out 'cause I don't listen to the radio, and so that's how I have --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to get new music, is through that way.
R:  Right.
L:  And the internet, too.  I kinda like, you know, check out, like CD now and Amazon and stuff and ... that you can listen to stuff on there, so ...
R:  Right, exactly.  You, um -- have you tried, uh, internet or a, uh, satellite radio for your car stuff?
L:  No, I haven't.
R:  That's pretty cool.
L:  What is that?
R:  Um, it's just a -- it's just a little unit that you stick in your car.  You take it with -- actually with you everywhere.  Um, and it's like ten dollars a month.
L:  Huh.
R:  And it just beams satellite radio into the little unit.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Puts it directly into your car.  And it does all those same things where it brings up the -- you know, the titles and tells you what the artists are and all that stuff.
L:  Oh, that's neat.
R:  So, it's like that thing for your -- for your satellite dish but, like, in a little compact unit for your car.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  You know, so ...
L:  Oh, I'll have to look into that.
R:  [LAUGH] [inaudible]
L:  Learn something new here.
R:  [LAUGH] So ... the, um -- what, uh -- so, what -- what news station are you watching the most of?
L:  Um, well, aside from just, like, our local channels, you know, of course, like at five and eleven and stuff we'd be watching our local station, but, uh, I think mostly we've been watching, like, CSPAN, CNN for the most part, but maybe MSNBC.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, you --
R:  It's kinda funny, like, you know, it's -- like to hear, 'cause I've been -- I flip, you know, and get that button going pretty fast. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well I do, too.
R:  You know.
L:  We just took all the news stations and put 'em on a favorites list.
R:  Right.
L:  So, we can just go to that list and then you just sit there and just surf through --
R:  Hit that same favorites, right.
L:  -- all the news, you know, and -- and since most of 'em will sit there for, like, you know, three hours and just loop everything and you hear the same thing over and over and over, so it's like, oh, well, you can just surf to the next station and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- see if anyone's got anything new.
R:  Start getting the talking head and ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, switch over to something else.  That's what I've been doing.  But it's interesting to hear, like, the different perspectives between, you know, the different organizations.
L:  Yeah, 'cause each -- each station will sometimes give you a little different variation on a story or something.
R:  Right.  Or just even just the slant, you know.
L:  Yeah, or different footage and --
