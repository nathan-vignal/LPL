L:  Hi.  My name's Aaron.
R:  Hi, Aaron.  I'm Michelle.
L:  Hi Michelle.  How're ya doing?
R:  Just fine.  You wanna go first?
L:  [COUGH] Uh sure.  Um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I guess -- uh wow, I just went to a talk on this uh but that was for um ... for coll- -- at the college level but I guess if we're talking about K twelve, the biggest problem for me is the uh discrepancy in funding between suburban schools and city schools.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's probably because it's based on property tax and, you know, there's just not enough funding um [COUGH] for proper resources in -- in city schools so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  To me, that's the biggest issue.
R:  Yeah.  Well, basically I um ... wo- worked in the school system for ten years.
L:  Okay.
R:  So um basically, I feel that the problem with um public schools is that the administration, they set our children up for failure.  They set the students up for failure, especially with the SOLs because you know, they want to start 'em off at a higher level, you know, with math and um especially with math, concentration on math because basically, you know, we don't teach um the higher level math courses until you get, like, in middle school -- well, basically in high school or whatever.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's like, you know, they want our students, by the time they get to college, their first year in college, to know, you know, like, trig and everything like that and it's like, we don't because our kids don't get the concept.  They don't allow the teachers, you know, to basically teach the concept of the beginning basics of higher level math, dealing with algebra where we can teach it in kindergarten but they don't allow us to do it.  They just, you know, allow us to teach basic math, you know, like addition, subtraction, multiplication and fractions.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which is the basics for higher level math.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But however, our kids are losing that concept once they get in middle and high school because it's not replicated any more.
L:  Right.
R:  So, that's why I just feel that our failure as teachers and as administrators are, is that we basically don't teach our kids the concepts, especially dealing with math, that's just, you know, the biggest failure, math and reading, basically.
L:  Right.
R:  In the school system, so ...
L:  Um ...
R:  And ba- -- you know, uh-huh?
L:  Yeah.  Well -- well, what about the uh [COUGH] like the standardization of testing, especially that's going on more and more in -- in uh public schools?
R:  Oh, yeah because um basically, it's like, you know, before when we were in school, you know, school went a little bit smoother because our teachers, you know, we were allowed to stay to the basics.  Now, it's like we're teaching to the test, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Especially dealing with the SOLs, we're teaching to the test of, you know, how students are supposed to learn history and how they're supposed to, you know, [LAUGH] learn math and science and social studies and it's like, you know, we're not able to be creative, you know what I'm saying?
L:  Right, right.
R:  Because, you know, they sit up there and they tell us, they train teachers and say, "Oh, you know, well, you know, every student learns differently".  Well, we already know that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in order for us to teach that way, where you might be a auditory learner and the other student, you know, might be a visual learner where they're not allowing us -- the SOLs aren't -- not allowing us to teach it to them that way.  They just -- it's on paper, this is what's on the test, this is what you need to learn.  By the time you train them to take the test, they may pass and they may not and then when they go to the next grade, guess what?  They've forgotten everything, you know, that that test material was on the year before and then that means the following year, you gotta pick up --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the last year's part and then you gotta tackle [inaudible] the new year's part, so [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  ... it's like, make -- you know, it's a backward thing that, you know, the administration is putting on the teachers and everything.
L:  Yeah.  Now, instead of trying to reduce class size and having more individual tests [several inaudible words] --
R:  Exactly, exactly.  They're pushing more students into the class sizes, they're enhancing them and then you have one teacher that has, like, thirty five to forty students in the class, you know, and you know, you try -- you like, you know, you pass by the ones that are, you know, getting it, you know, that are being able to, you know, work with one another.
L:  Right.
R:  But the lower level, you know, especially my um -- my students that are like -- well, are called the mid level to lower level learning is a more challenge because it's like, when they go home, you know, whatever I've taught in school, if they didn't get it that day and they go home to do homework, guess what?  Mum and dad doesn't know how to do it either.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and then they comes to us, the teachers and, like, "Hey" you know, "Why isn't my child learning this?" and it's like, there is not enough time in a day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know so it's becoming very difficult [LAUGH].
L:  I know and I actually -- I was -- I was always good at standardized testing but I actually think it's -- you know, it hurt my learning because I would just, you know, do well on technical tests and memorize things real well but like, I didn't necessarily learn it and it didn't really, you know, enable, like, the type of -- I was -- I would -- I would always -- I would always do well, like, math and science based tests.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And like, language, like, technical stuff but, you know, now that I'm in college, I finally get the chance to, like, study some other things.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I [MN] basically to stay whatever I was good in, I mean that [LAUGH] -- that's kinda ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  ... you know, but -- but then I realised that the -- you know, there's a lot more out there and I think it kind of closes off -- it stunts people's, like, you know, opportunity to really find what they're good at but ... so ...
R:  Right.  And I think it turned -- like, I was turned off by math because throughout my whole -- I had -- I've never realised until I got in college that I had a anx- anxiety toward math.
L:  Right.
R:  And that's because when I got to third grade and [LAUGH] I was supposed to learn fractions, I didn't learn it 'cause I di- -- I just couldn't comprehend it.  I -- I didn't get the concept of it so I went through -- I actually skated by through math all, you know, I made Cs and Ds ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... and then when I got to college, guess what?  They made us take an e- -- a entrance exam and [LAUGH] I flunked it, you know, on that part.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I passed the language and the reading part but on the math, they were like, guess what?  You gotta go to remedial [LAUGH].
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, it took me longer, you know, to get outta college, you know, where it should have been four years, I actually didn't graduate 'til five because I had to start in a lower level, you know, math.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Then, when I got to the higher level math, I still had to get, you know, a tutor, you know, to help me through the geometry or the trig part or whatever because it's just that difficult to me and I think, you know, um ... when -- you know -- you know, teachers or administration, they don't look at, you know, the difficulty that students have in school, you know, especially where their abilities are, you know, where ... hello?
L:  Yeah, I'm listening [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, okay.  I don't know if it clicked out or not [LAUGH].
L:  No, I'm listening.
R:  Oh, okay ... but um ... you know, basically, it's like, you know, you have to start with those children, you know, where they get, you know, where your ability or strong point could have been, you know, like ...
L:  Right.
R:  ... reading or math or whatever, somebody else's, you know, their downfall could be in a totally different subject.
L:  Right.
R:  And if you don't, you know, give that child the opportunity, you know, to um, you know, enhance their abilities where they're lacking it, you know, it's gonna -- they're gonna fall short.
L:  Right.
R:  And like I said in the beginning, you're setting them up for failure because, like, in the statistics, um, it says, like, ninety five percent of college freshmen end up +flunking out of school or going on academic probation, you know ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... their first semester of college.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah.  It -- it also results in the cutting of funding for, you know, other things like music and art and stuff like that.
R:  Oh yes, yes because it you don't enhance those skills, you know, like, those artistic abilities, you know ...
L:  Right.
R:  ... for drawing or dance or music, when you cut those out, like, you know, you're not giving that child -- you know, all you're doing is giving them academic -- academics.  You're forcing academics on 'em.  They're not allowed to express their creativity, where people aren't realising your creativity flows over into the academic world too.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, that helps you -- music helps you with math because of the scales and things and then dance, you know, that helps you with other, you know, reading or other abilities that, you know, you could produce through that, so ...
L:  Yeah and then [MN] --
R:  Yeah, that's true [LAUGH].
L:  I know and then, I just think, like, in general, it's, you know, it's -- if ... even if you do well, it just -- it just makes people not -- not as thoughtful and that.  I don't think it really works for democracy, you know ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  ... to let everyone just sort of, like, you know, sort of like be like [inaudible] just learn to the test and not -- and not really, you know, think for yourself and all that stuff.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  And uh -- and not many people, even if you're good at it like I was, it doesn't really create an interest in -- in school and learning.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I mean, I ... you know, I still like to learn on my own and stuff but it, you know, it's like ... you -- the -- the point of going to school is not to just pass a test so ...
R:  Right, exactly and now they're realising, you know, with technology, the kids that grew up between the eighties, you know, and then -- well, actually, the nineties really, you know, they're like, into computers and software.  I mean, look at all these different companies and stuff, coming up that's being run by younger, you know, um ... students or younger people because they're so interested in technology.
L:  Right.
R:  And now they're saying, "Oh, well, we need to incorporate technology through business and through school, you know, because it works hand and hand".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so it's like, -- and then the other thing too, that I look at because I work for the military, you know, when you go overseas and you look at the scores for the students in Japan or Germany or different things like that, you know, America's always looking at, "Oh, well, Germany and uh you know, Japan is doing this, well, we gotta get on board and do this".  Well, guess what?  They started their kids when they were, like, two and three years old.
L:  Right.
R:  Teaching the math skills and the reading skills and the lang- ...
