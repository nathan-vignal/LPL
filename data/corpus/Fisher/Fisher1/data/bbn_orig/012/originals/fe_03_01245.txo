L:  Michelle Jordan[?].
R:  Hi, my name's Lucia Shima[?] and I guess we're supposed to talk about if affirmative action's a good idea or not.
L:  I guess so. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Um, well, I don't think it's a good idea.  I think people should get in on the, um, merits of -- of what -- how good a job they do.  Ah, especially if it's something that's real technical that would involve, um, safety and stuff like that.  If somebody's not paying attention or not doing a good job and they just got the job because they were, you know, female or whatever, that's not fair.
L:  That's true.
R:  [MN] And I think it probably was useful a long time ago when people couldn't think of certain groups as having certain kinds of jobs, but I think now if you can prove that you can do it, you should be able to have a shot at it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And --
L:  I think it's a little different if it's in a college.
R:  Say that again.
L:  I think it's a little different if it's admissions to a college.
R:  Oh, you think that -- that, ah, minorities -- I mean, that there should be, ah --
L:  Affirmative action when it comes to admissions to a college, because ah, minority groups in general are, um, lower income and go to a poorer quality school.  And I'm not saying the m- -- you know, the majority of, like, you know -- so, they would need that little foot up to get into a better college or --
R:  I think -- well, I think if they have -- if they have, ah, good grades that they should have more help with getting in for financial and stuff, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, but I don't think that they should have -- you know, for every ten, um -- I don't know, for every ten of one kind of group there -- they have to admit three of the other kind of group and the three could just be anybody.  But I do think that guys from lower income, um, situations should have more help getting into college to pay for it.
L:  True.
R:  Yeah and -- and have more work study or whatever.  But I worked my way through college myself, so. [LAUGH] You know, I can -- I know it can be done. [LAUGH]
L:  Right and no, it definitely can --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- be done.  And I would agree with that, just not necessarily the minority but the lower income I -- I guess --
R:  Yeah.
L: -- is what I would mean.
R:  Yeah because you're -- you're right, minorities do tend to fall into the lower income areas.  But if you made it more help for people that have a low income but have really good grades --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they should have a leg up.  I don't care if they're purple, green or --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- hermaphrodite.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.
R:  [SIGH] Ah, [LAUGH] do we have to talk about this the entire ten minutes?
L:  I'm not sure, ah -- this is the first call I've -- I've done.
R:  Me too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Di- --
L:  This is interesting.
R:  -- did you hear about it on -- or how did you hear about this?
L:  Um, I believe that -- I was on volition --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it -- it's, um, a mystery --
R:  I --
L:  -- shopping website.
R:  I know what it is, yeah.  Because I --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I got it from Lyla's[?] -- ah, what is it?  [inaudible] --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  There's a Yahoo group, it's Lyla's --
L:  Lyla Frances[?]?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so they were all -- the people were meeting each other, you know, like, "Oh, I -- I've seen you on the website" [MN].
L:  Well, interesting.  Tell me your name again?
R:  Lucia Shima.
L:  Okay, mine's Michelle.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Do you do mystery shopping also?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  So, I guess everybody's doing that and, ah, lending their voice and their accents to this survey.
L:  It's neat, I've never done anything like that before.
R:  Me neither. [LAUGH]
L:  And interestingly enough, I'm a -- I'm a college student now and this topic of affirmative action came up in class --
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  -- and, um, ah, one of the girls that sat beside me who is just -- I mean, there was like five of who were one hundreds-- we made one hundreds in the class and -- and the girl that happened to sit beside me was also a minority and she was totally against affirmative action, which surprised me and she said basically what you said that, um, you should be hired based on your qualities and that affirmative action can keep a minority population down, in a sense.
R:  Well, it's sort of an insult too.  It's like, you only got in because you're Hispanic --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or something like that --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- and not because you're the best person and people want to feel like they're good and they're valued and, um, they're being recognized for being a cut above the other people.  And so, I really believe in people earning their way through things by -- by their qua- qualities and -- and their gifts and not just because of what they look like or, you know, where they got born.
L:  Right.
R:  So, yeah, she's right.  Um, I -- I've heard that, um, some black people feel like that's a put down too, that somehow it just keeps them down, like, "Oh, you poor black man.  We have to even help you in college, because you're so, you know --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [inaudible]".  Yeah, but I [inaudible] -- you can turn it on its head and make it, you know, we have to do all these things for you and aren't we nice and it makes us feel good because we're the big white man or, you know, [inaudible] --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm not a big white man, but you know what I mean. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  No, and I think that's true.
R:  And I think being in c- college, this mystery shopping would probably be an excellent way to make some extra bucks here and there.
L:  It is.
R:  I did all kinds of stuff when I was in college, too and in fact I did, ah, surveys and stuff.  I'd follow up for health -- people who fill out -- filled out a health questionnaire and I went door to door and stuff.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  It was -- it was sort of like this, I guess. [MN] And, ah, it was all the people that hadn't answered the questionnaire and so -- and I had go to some pretty rough neighborhoods, it's kind of like being a census taker.
L:  Really.
R:  And then -- yeah, I did the census too --
L:  Oh, really! [LAUGH]
R:  -- ah, last year.  Since last -- yeah.  I do all kinds of stuff, just because it's neat and interesting and fun and ...
L:  Oh, I love it.  I like to do different things, to get stuck in the same old thing -- that's the only bad thing about graduating, is that I'll actually have to get a nine to five job. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] That'll be the worst thing.
R:  If -- if you really care about what you're doing, it's really cool.
L:  It will be, yeah.  I -- hopefully -- hopefully I'll -- I'll -- yeah, I'll work my way up to doing what I want to be able to do, you know?
R:  Yeah, you always start on the bottom.  I went -- I went to college twice, because the first time I graduated was something that didn't really turn out to be a good useful thing to learn --
L:  What?
R:  -- ah to -- social welfare. [LAUGH]
L:  That is what I'm sitting now --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- in sociology. [LAUGH]
R:  Well -- well, my minor was in sociology and my major was in social welfare and, um, Ron- -- I was in California and Ronald Regan was governor then, so he was cutting back all the programmes and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- if you only have a bachelors, you pretty much were just pushing paper --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and -- and I had this fantasy, "I'm going to go out and help poor underprivileged people and I'm, you know, like Joan of Ark or something" --
L:  Yeah! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, then I had to do -- I had to do case work and stuff, you know, as a work -- work study hours, I think --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and most of the people were trying to play the system and get --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- free money and not do anything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I -- I started really -- I thought, "I don't want to help these people, I don't like them" which was --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I thought, "I don't like the way my a- -- my attitude about these people.  How can I help somebody -- you know, I'm being superior to them, that's not nice, it's not right". [MN] And so I worked for about four years and then I went back to college and, um, got a Bachelor of Fine Arts and Interior Architectural Design.
L:  Really?
R:  And it's what I should have done all along, because I -- even when I was a kid I was always drawing floor plans for houses and -- and making furniture and stuff for dolls.  I never played with the dolls, I made up furniture for the dolls --
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  -- and their little clothes and stuff and curtains and --
L:  So, do you do that still now?
R:  Yeah, I've been doing it for like twenty two years --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and, um, I've got -- I've -- I've always worked on the side out of my house on top of having a regular job.  So, when I got remarried and I moved out to Iowa, um, nobody around here really hires designers, you know, they're -- they're more down home people than -- they don't have a lot of big airs --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they like to be very thrifty on their money.  So, I don't have a lot of work on that, so I do a lot of other stuff including mystery shopping --
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  -- and I had a -- I had a baby at the age of forty seven, so.
L:  Really!
R:  Yeah, so I wanted to stay home with him and, um -- anyway, it worked out real well.
L:  Well, we have quite a bit in common then, don't we?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I don't know where you are, but ...
L:  Well, I'm -- I want to be Joan of Arc, you know, I want --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to save the world. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  I guess I'm still young enough [several inaudible words] and I haven't actually done it yet, so I- -- I'm not jaded.
R:  Oh, just -- just don't get personally involved.  I think that's probably what I did.
L:  Well, that's going to be -- I think that'll be the hardest thing for me, because um I wear my heart on my sleeve and so th- -- woes of the every day world really get to me.
R:  Oh, are you a Pisces?
L:  Um, no --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I was born in November, so I'm --
R:  Scorpio?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Well, that's -- yeah, that's similar.
L:  So, I know that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, seeing -- seeing people hurting always hurts me.  So, that's going to be the hardest thing.  I -- I actually want to go into social work and [several inaudible words] children --
R:  I -- I would work with kids --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but then, um -- in fact, w- -- well, my -- we're involved with social workers now on the other end of it, because my son has had some behaviour problems so we have family therapy at the house and stuff.  And they're supposed to do, I -- I'm guessing like thirty cases -- they're supposed to do that many cases and they're doing sixty and seventy cases and they're really, really burned out --
L:  There is no way.
R:  -- and I've got -- we've got some good people working for us that I -- I've met all kinds of people.  Are you there?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.  I thought I heard a click, like the -- there's supposed to be a beep or something when it's -- ten minutes is up.
L:  Okay.
R:  [SIGH] Okay, affirmative action.  Affirmative action. [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH] We kind of got off subject.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We're still talking, so maybe they can use what we're talking about, so.
R:  Yeah, social welfare? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  And -- well, I've heard stories from the social workers that come to visit us about
