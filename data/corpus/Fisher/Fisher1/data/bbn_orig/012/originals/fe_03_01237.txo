L:  Hi, my name is Kathy[?].
R:  Hi, I'm Lindsey[?] and I -- no, I don't believe in affirmative action and hiring practices in general.
L:  Me too.  I feel [inaudible] -- this isn't really a topic that I have a lot of information on, but um I'd be more than willing to learn more about the topic if somebody could, ah, explain more into detail what it involves.
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- I agree with you a little -- ah, a little bit there, um, about not -- not having information about the things that go on.  It's not really as much a hot topic in the news --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as it's been, you know, in the past.  And, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a lot of places where I've been, I've been in the minority, even if I didn't believe in such things and it was mostly [several inaudible words] when I was in college that they were introducing affirmative action, um, within college -- you know, within college recruiting and, you know, letting people in -- you know, [several inaudible words] and things like that and it was -- really, it -- it -- my feel- -- my -- I honestly have a hard time saying that I don't believe in it, because the politically correct thing to say is that, you know, we owe these people something.  But at the same time, being female I'd rather know that I got a position based on merit than based on --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- gender or anything else.  And so, you know, I think the problem is is that you really, kind of, take it too far whenever you say that you -- you have to hire people based on something and it really kind of reduces the level of expertise overall.
L:  Definitely, I think that there's so much that people can get into, but because certain people get hired, you know, for things and well, like you were saying with the, um, ah, with the colleges and their -- the acceptances and stuff like that, I think a lot of people who deserve to get into special places, um, just -- they're not getting the opportunities because other people are getting the job and, um -- and if it's to my understanding correctly, you know, it's not just, you know, a gender issue, it's also a racial, ah, sometimes maybe age --
R:  Yeah.  In fact -- yeah.
L:  Is that correct?
R:  And, you know, that's really disturbing too.  I mean, if -- I think that if someone can do the job, then they should just look at in a blind way and I'm always, um, partial to not revealing anything.  Basically, having -- [SIGH] having applications that -- basically, this is candidate A, candidate B and taking everything that's not specifically related, you know -- basically, [several inaudible words] cultural things or -- that, you know, basically I wouldn't put on my resume that I was in a sorority because that would define me as female.  I wouldn't put on my resume that I, um, you know, wa- -- went to certain churches because it could affect religious things or I have ha- -- were --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- a member of any cultural organizations, um, if -- I think maybe it would be better just to start out doing things where maybe they did blind interviews or, um, online interviews where, you know, you basically were able to show what you were and what you could do without actually letting other things get in the way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That make sense?
L:  No, that totally makes sense.  You know, there's some places like I know Home Depo- -- well, see where I work now, they didn't -- they didn't do it this way, but I'm applying at different places and Home Depot instead of, ah, doing, um -- oh, I'm sorry, not Home Depot, Wallgreens instead of doing, you know, a person to person interview, they ask you for -- um, number one, why you think that you'd be good for the job, why you think you have merit and two, they put you in scenarios on a computer that you would have to solve.  So, I like Wallgreens principles and the fact that, you know, the only contact that you have initially, before you get hired --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is, ah, with the person who set you up on the computer.  After that, it's all with the computer a- and as we know, computer has no preference --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it just knows what merit is.
R:  And actually it's kind of the same thing, we do a lot of work with monster dot com which is, you know, the employment website and, um, they happen to say --
L:  Did you say mon- monster dot com?
R:  Monster dot com.  Mhm.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, um, we do -- like we'll have screening questions that we can fill out where, you know, you basically can ask ahead of time so that whenever the resumes go through it's like yes or no questions, but you can kind of get a feel for, you know, what the person is -- is like and everything and so the resumes that you end up getting, you know, are ones that the computer has gone through and -- and selected [several inaudible words] that.  So, you don't really even have a chance to --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, pick people that -- I mean, you -- well, you can weed through people after that obviously, but it kind of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- pre weeds for you based on --
L:  Now --
R:  Yeah?
L:  Go ahead.
R:  Oh, no.  So- -- I'm sorry, I was finished. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no.  Oh, okay.  Um, I just -- I just wanted to know if you knew any companies in general that I -- that did that [several inaudible words] -- like they hired based upon, um, ah, forgotten sorry.  Just lost my train of thought.
R:  That's okay.
L:  Um, preference.  Wh- -- the -- what the whole purpose of this -- this phone survey and I just totally forgot what the name of it was.
R:  Um --
L:  Um, the h- -- affirmative, did you say?  Affirmative?
R:  Yeah, affirmative action, I guess.
L:  Affirmative.  Okay, affirmative action, I'm sorry I totally [LAUGH] [several inaudible words].
R:  That's okay. [LAUGH]
L:  But if [LAUGH] -- you know it's one of those days.
R:  I totally understand.
L:  It's one of those days, but um -- okay, do you know of any companies that do that specifically?
R:  Um, no I really -- the only thing I know -- I think a lot of companies do it, um, and whenever I've gone on looking at job searches and stuff, they use it more like as a screening technique --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, but I don't know that -- anybody that will hire totally based on a survey and I mean I'm not advocating that at all, but you know, I think it would be --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- interesting -- I think it would be interesting to see how people, you know -- and it would depend on the job and everything, because obviously you don't want to hire people without any face to face contact, but if they did more screening online or, you know, in some facets where you didn't necessarily get to meet, you know, the person ahead of time.  Because I know, like speaking to people online a lot of the times, I will be -- not nec- -- I mean, people will present themselves in a -- in a different way, I think in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you'll -- I mean, it's just -- it's a much more -- a lot of times it can be like a more friendly atmosphere because you're not, um, dealing with so many prejudices and you don't really know that much about this person and then sometimes I find out peop- -- like some of my -- some of the people that I work with, like I never meet in person and then whenever I -- you know, you get this idea of what somebody looks like or sounds like and you just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  And then you're kind of blown away by the difference and so it just kind of shows how you kind of, um, take things and assess certain traits for people based on just the kind of -- the things that they say or, you know --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- just whatever.
L:  It can be go- -- it can be good, because you know then at least when you meet somebody then you can use y- -- like for -- I should say, more for employers, ah, when you meet somebody when you're hiring them, you know, you get a feeling of who these people are.  Some people go with their gut feeling, but all the time, I don't know, I don't think that's -- but I have a question real quick if I can?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, if my phone cuts off in the middle of this -- ah, of this call, what would happen?
R:  Um, I don't know.  I know --
L:  Because my --
R:  -- like I missed a call and they just said that -- I called the number back and it was the -- um, I actually spoke to a person and they said that the phone would just keep dialing and then like about thirty minutes later I -- I got this call and I was able to take it.  So, I guess maybe the phone would call you back or I -- I don't know, that would be something -- but if you'd -- hang -- if you dial back the number that, um -- that called you, you can speak to a live person and ask them. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  That's all I know.
L:  This is my first time doing this --
R:  Oh, me too.
L:  -- and I didn't know.  Y- -- oh, it is?
R:  Yeah.  True.
L:  Have you -- how did you get to know about it?
R:  Um, I found out about it from like a group of people that, you know, like do surveys and stuff like that and they just told --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- me about it.  You know?
L:  Yeah, this is fun.  So, um, ah, you said you worked for monster dot com?
R:  Well, I work with monster a lot.
L:  Oh, with monster.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay. Ho- -- now, what did, ah, um -- what main things do you do, like with monster?
R:  Um.
L:  Like as far as -- 
R:  Well, I work with companies to like try to get them good people.  So, I do --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I do a lot of recruitment.  So, a lot of the times, you know, we'll suggest monster as something that they can use in -- in that manner and, um, a lot of the companies will be trying really hard to do diversity hiring and things like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, so we'll -- we'll try to do different diversity initiatives and things like that in order to garner the best candidates for them --
L:  Wow, that's --
R:  -- um, so, you know, we're [several inaudible words] and a lot of -- a lot of publications will cut out special diversity things and -- or will advertise in publications that target, um, certain ethnicities or, um, just different demographics and, um
