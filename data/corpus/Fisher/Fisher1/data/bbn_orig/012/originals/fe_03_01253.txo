L:  Well, it kind of depends on me, whether or not I feel like going out or whether or not I like to, um -- ah, want to stay at home and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if I'm -- if I want to go out, then I'm more than happy to go -- go to the movies, as long as there's something interesting playing and there hasn't been a whole lot of movies lately that have been interesting. [LAUGH]
R:  No.  No, there's not been.  I saw a good one though on a video, that movie The Panic Room with Jody Foster in it --
L:  Yeah, I've wa- --

R:  I -- well, I did too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Did you?
R:  But it was -- oh, it was so good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It just kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time watching it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then I -- I also bought that movie Mister Deeds, um, with, um, what is his name?
L:  Ah, Adam Sandler.
R:  Yes, I watch anything with him in it.
L:  Yeah, he's pretty funny, my husband --
R:  Yeah.

R:  Yeah, he -- he is a funny -- he's a funny character.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, I don't really know exactly -- I mean, what do we do here?  All I did was sign up for this and then I get a phone call and I'm not really for sure how we go about getting paid for it and everything.
L:  I'm not sure either, this is my first one too.
R:  This is my first one too.  It just called me, I was asleep and my phone -- my cell phone rang and I answered it and it's the recording.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's basically all I got. [LAUGH]  Um --
R:  [MN]
L:  I'm not sure how you go about doing any of it, I just know that, you know, you sign up for it, and you have a discussion -- discussion about, ah, you know, movies --
R:  The topic.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I guess we need to talk about movies then. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  That's basically all I know too.  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I did get a ri- --
R:  Well, I don't --
L:  I did get a message on my -- my answering machine --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- telling me kind of a little -- ah, giving me my, ah, PIN number --
R:  Right.
L:  -- did you get the same thing?  Did it say anything on that?
R:  [NOISE] Well, I got my -- my PIN number over the computer --
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] -- it sent me a -- it sent me an email from a -- from -- on my computer about my PIN number, but I had to run and find it when I got this call.
L:  [LAUGH] I had to do the same thing.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, where are you at?
L:  I'm in, ah -- ah, Dallas, Texas.
R:  In Dallas, Texas?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm in -- I'm in Dakota, Alabama.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, we're probably about ten hours away from each other.
L:  Yeah, I have family that lives in, ah, Alabama.
R:  Do you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What part?
L:  Oh, well Birmingham, Dalton, all kinds of places. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you got em everywhere.  Dalton's south Alabama and Birmingham's right -- almost in the middle.  I lived in Dallas, um -- gosh, many, many years ago in Richardson, Texas, right on the outskirts.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  Many years ago.
L:  [NOISE].  Can you hold on one second?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What's up? [NOISE] Oh, the pictures? [NOISE]  Okay.  Just my dad ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, um, I --
R:  How long are we supposed to talk?
L:  Ah, I think for ten minutes.
R:  Okay.
L:  Supposed to talk for ten minutes about, you know, what the --
R:  Movies.
L:  -- topic is and -- or if you enjoy doing it and, ah -- I guess -- what movies have you seen lately?
R:  What's the movies I've seen lately.  Now, I don't go to the movie theatre much because I've got several movie channels on the cable --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so I'll pretty much watch my movies here.  Um, I saw one recently with George Clooney in it, ah, that Ocean's Eleven.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  That was pretty good, but they --
L:  Yeah, they -- and my -- my mom said that was pretty good.  I -- I haven't seen it, ah, but she said it's pretty good.  I -- I -- um, I'm, ah, hooked up to this -- ah, I pay twenty dollars a month to get movies sent to me --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- ca- -- it's called Netflix and what I do is I -- it's a rental and you don't have to pay the late charges.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- and then you keep the movie as long as you want to, because my big thing was I was always going and renting movies but I was not able to return em on time --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- and then I'd wind up with forty or fifty dollars [LAUGH] worth of late fees, you know?
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  So, whenever I -- whenever I ju- -- ah, heard about this, I thought, "Well, this is perfect" you know?  Because I spend that in a month just renting one movie, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  On late fees?
L:  Yeah and they -- what they do is they send three movies to you, um -- ah, when you first start up they send three movies and you pick the movies that you want to rent and they send three of the -- ah, the f- -- ah, the f- first three and they send those to you and when you're finished with one you return it and they pay for the postage and everything, the return and shipping too [SIGH] and, um -- and then they send the next one on your list and you just continue to return em, you know, and you get three a week usually, because it takes, you know, about two or three days to return em but if you watch -- um, like one day watch this [inaudible] and return it the next day, watch this one and return it and by the time the first one got there you're already receiving an -- receiving another one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So that -- that's what I enjoy doing, you know, because --
R:  That's -- that's pretty interesting.
L:  Ah, I -- I don't have a whole lot of time on my hands, you know, I own -- I own my own business so I don't have a lot -- a whole lot of time on my hands [LAUGH] to go to the movies.
R:  Oh, I understand.  Well, what do you do?  What is your business? [COUGH]
L:   Ah, my mom and I, ah -- ah, we -- we do crafts and jewellery and collectibles and -- and I'm on the internet so ...
R:  Oh, selling at the m- -- like Ebay or something?
L:  Well, no w- we've just now started up an Ebay account so that we could do Ebay but we're -- no, we normally don't do a whole lot of Ebay stuff.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, we're just getting started.  We just, ah, started, you know, I think it was in November of last year.  Yeah, about November of last year we got started.  So, you know, it's sort of our -- you know, we just, um -- um, in other words we're just getting started we're just, you know, trying to get a leg in -- [LAUGH] a leg in the door and everything.  So, we don't -- we don't have a whole lot of people going to the websites [SIGH] yet --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but we're hoping that changes.
R:  Well, you must be a member of, ah, Money And Shopping Network?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, you do mystery shopping too?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I do too and it does pretty well.  Right now I'm unemployed, I don't get to go to the movies very much right now. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  The movies -- the movies cost too much.  It's -- it's cheaper for my family to just rent a video --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and bring it home --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or you watch one over one of the movie channels, than it is to go to the movies --
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  -- because you know, there's a -- th- -- once you get in the door --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- then of course everybody wants Coke and popcorn and by the time you sit down you've spent fifty dollars just to get into the movies.
L:  Well, that's why you eat before you go.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You eat before you go and you go to the dollar theatres and you wait until the movie that you want to see is at the dollar thea- and we have right and -- ah, close to us, it takes us about -- maybe ten minutes to get there --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- so we just -- yeah, we eat before we go and so that we know we're not going to be hungry or thirsty or anything like that and then we go and see whatever movie we want to see at the dollar thea- theatre and it costs a dollar at -- you know, at their off peak times and there are peak times that cost a dollar fifty and then, you know, we're happy because we got to go out and do -- ah, and -- and see a movie on a big screen --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, and then -- and then whenever, you know, we're down on luck, we don't have the -- even a dollar fifty to spend on the movies that's when we just at home and --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- use our Netflix, so.
R:  Well, that is true though especially about [SIGH] seeing it on the big screen, it does make a different to --
L:  Yeah, it makes a big difference.
R:  Yeah, it does make it a lot better but -- now we don't have a dollar theatre or rather we did but I don't know why but it -- it closed down, went out of business.
L:  Hm.
R:  Ah, I don't know why, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --  it -- it was always full but -- and -- and we did go to it several times but we haven't -- I haven't been to the theatre to watch a movie in probably a year, maybe even longer than that.  Well, I know it's -- well, I know it's been a couple of years.
L:  Well, it hasn't been that long for me. [LAUGH]
R:  You what?
L:  It hasn't been that long for me.
R:  It's been awhile for me, because I took my -- the last time I went to a movie I took my youngest son, which he's almost four now, and he was still in one of those car seat carriers.
L:  Oh, so [LAUGH] --
R:  And I took him in there with me and he watched the movie.  I mean, he ju- -- he wasn't even speaking at the time --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and he watched the movie -- it was a little -- it was [several inaudible words] and we went and watched that movie and that -- you know, that was -- it was really nice --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I do enjoy the big screen, now that does make a difference but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but nowadays you can buy TVs that are so big that you feel like you are at the theatre --
L:  Yeah.
R:  We don't have one but [NOISE] they are nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I got my other phone ringing.
L:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] my dad at the door wanting to talk to me. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But yeah we have a big screen, we have a fifty five inch but it's still not -- it's still not the same as a big -- you know, the movie theatre big screens, because then you got --
R:  How will we know -- I'm sorry, go ahead.
L:  Go ahead.
R:  I was just wondering how are we to know when ten minutes is up.  Are you timing
