L:  Hello.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH] Yeah, hi.  Hi, this is --
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name's Laura.
L:  H- -- my name is Jen.
R:  Hi, Jen.
L:  Hi.  Um --
R:  Um --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  Oh, well, this is my first call, so if you've done this before ...?
L:  No, I haven't.  This is my --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- first call also. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Well, as far as computer games, um, I do play computer games.  Uh, CD ROM, sometimes I play on the internet.
L:  Okay.
R:  Uh --
L:  My daughter has a Playstation, so I've played her Playstation before. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, no, I've done -- I've played that as well.  Um, but I like to play, uh, on the -- on the internet.  You can go on to, like, games dot com and you can play with other people and play, um, Upwards j- -- or Scrabble.
L:  Okay.  I've never done that on the computer, but [LAUGH] ...
R:  Yeah.  I've played that.  And then I've also -- we also have CD ROM games on the computer that, you know, can play, like, Wheel of Fortune or games like that.
L:  Right.
R:  The kids and I will ge- gor- gather round the computer and p- -- and play that.
L:  Okay.  I've played Monopoly on a -- on a CD ROM on the computer.
R:  Okay.  I've played that b- -- I've played that as well before.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's been a while since I've played on the internet, and my son gets on the internet and plays, um, computer games with his buddies all the time.  I -- I don't even know how that works properly but [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- he gets on and they, like, all sign on together and -- and -- and are able to play a game online.  And I haven't figured that one out yet, but ...
L:  Well, that's good, though.  Good way to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- play a game and play with your friend without him being there.
R:  Exactly.  So, it's --
L:  Very good.
R:  Um, can't think of any other CD ROMs --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that I've played.  Kind of done both.  I don't do it a whole lot.  I'm on -- usually on the internet more doing email and stuff like that, but then -- so the percentage of time that I play is minimal.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.  I play with my daughter's Playstation.  She has, uh, [SIGH] like, Land Before Time game, stuff like that, and I pretty much show her how to play and then she tries to beat me and [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- she's only five, but --
R:  I was gonna say --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  I was just gonna ask you how -- now, my -- I've got a thirteen year old, and so that's why he's always -- he's always on -- saying, "Can I get online?  Can I get online?"  Unfortunately we only have one phone line --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that -- that doesn't -- doesn't work real well when we need to use the phone and -- and -- and if you need him to get off it's like -- he's like, "Mom, I'm in the middle of a game" [LAUGH] and I'm like, "But I'm expecting a call".  So, I think having a CD ROM --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then playing on -- online, they get a lot of -- my kids have a lot of CD games, CD ROM games, and that -- I prefer that because it doesn't tie up the phone line.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  They -- they have the internet through cable now, which can help with playing games online and not tie up your phone.
R:  Yeah, that's -- well, I -- I'm -- we've got MSN and I'm -- I'm trying to get MSN broadband, but it's not in our area yet because it's -- it -- it says that I don't have to get an extra phone line.  You can have -- you can talk on the phone and be online at the same time.  It does some sort of split of your phone line, so that's what -- the kids can't wait till we get -- to get that in this, uh, in this area.
L:  And then they can play more games. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  And tie them up more. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I forgot to time our call.  Have you timed anything?  We're supposed to talk for how long?
L:  Oh, uh -- um, I --
R:  Where you from?
L:  I'm from West Virginia, Martinsburg, West Virginia.
R:  Oh, okay.  We're -- I'm in Indianapolis.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And [NOISE] found out that -- about this company through a friend who's done these calls before, so --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Did your friend say they were awkward in any way or [LAUGH] do they get easier? [LAUGH]
R:  Probably.  I don't [LAUGH] -- um, I've -- she's only done a few.  She hasn't really talked about it.  I'm thinking, "Hey, man, I talk on the phone, so sure.  P- pay -- you know, pay me to talk on the phone, that's not a problem". [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Um, just getting with the different groups.  I mean, you've got sm- -- younger children than I do, so part -- you're gonna have more of -- of a different perspective as far as what type of games she plays than my teenage boys do.
L:  Well, I'll tell you real quick the games that she has.  She has, um, the Land Before Time game, of course.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, Tom and Jerry.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  So, that's pretty neat.  I mean, I'm not really wanting her to play that because they -- all they do is hit each other with stuff --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- which you really don't want your kid to do, but -- and she has, um, Tarzan, which I don't know why we got that, but she likes it.  Um, but the CD ROM games she has are p- -- much better than her Playstation games.  They actually teach her, which --
R:  Oh, that's neat.
L:  -- I like much better.
R:  Yeah, so they're more educational than ...
L:  Yeah, instead of playing something that's I guess my grandmother would say warping your mind, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- she doesn't play it -- she doesn't play it too much, but I much prefer to have her playing educational games, but they don't have a lot of those for Playstation.
R:  Yeah, that's how -- that's how -- no, they don't.  That's how I was when they were younger.  We started out with, uh, [SIGH] oh, with the Nintendo and Mario Brothers, but then there was a game that they used to play and it was educational and -- and so that -- it was, um -- [LIPSMACK] can't think of the name of it right now.  Um, it was -- it was a Mar- [COUGH] -- it was a geography game, but using Mario, and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- so it taught him, you know, a- about just geography in general but made it fun, and so my son at the time was, like, four, I think, when I got him the -- the, uh, Nintendo, and he -- he really liked that game.  In fact, he's seventeen now and last year he -- he was looking for it for the new -- for the newer version computer systems that we have and was able to find it.  So, he just said, "That game was just so much fun".  So, I -- I was like that, too, when they were little.  And the older they got, the less they were interested in educational games and more --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- about just having fun and [LAUGH] playing with their friends.  And --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'll never forget the first time my little one was exposed to some kind of kickboxing or kick fighting or something.  I mean, he was only, like, three, and he was playing with a bunch of -- of, uh, neighbors and they were -- it was this game that I would never have allowed him to play, okay, not at that age.
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
R:  And I walk in and he was getting into it, you know.  I'm thinking, "Oh, my gosh, what are you doing letting him play this game?  He's too young".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause he was really getting into it.  And I said, you know, "We don't need anything to make more violence here". [MN] But he thought it --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  So -- but it's -- we've always been, [MN] um, more protective about what we let them play than --
L:  Yeah.  I'd like to actually get one that has geography on it.  That'd be pretty good for them to learn if it was some sort of making it fun.  That's ...
R:  Oh, yeah, it wa- -- it was, uh --
L:  I've never seen anything like that.
R:  [SIGH] I'm trying to think.  I don't know how -- if I can ask my son real quick, can't remember the name of it.  'Cause it -- I think it was definitely Mario based and it was -- but I don't know -- Brian.  Where -- where -- [NOISE] what was the name of that geography game that you liked from, uh, Nintendo?  Super Nintendo?  Mario?  [NOISE] Yeah.  Was that S -- was that S.N.E.S.? [NOISE] They don't have P.S. two or P.S.? [NOISE] Okay, it was called Mario's Missing.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'll have to see if they have that.
R:  That's the title of it.
L:  I'll have to see if they have that for Playstation.
R:  It's in -- yeah, it's an old -- it's an old, old game but it was -- you were doing, like, hunting for Mario. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  And it taught him -- it gives you clues, you know, about different countries and -- and then you'd have to guess at where he was at, kind of thing, so it was -- it was pretty -- pretty neat.
L:  Yeah, it sounds very interesting and -- might have to look into something like that.
R:  [SIGH] So, okay.
L:  I don't know --
R:  What?
L:  I don't know exactly how this is gonna end, if they're gonna prompt or ...?
R:  I don't -- I don't either. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess -- [LAUGH] I guess I should have asked my friend.  And they didn't say anything -- well, I was online 'cause I -- they've been trying to call me for two weekends and I couldn't -- I think last weekend it was the topic or w- -- I didn't know anything about, so I declined.  And then this weekend they've been trying to call me and, um, I didn't have my PIN number with me 'cause I wasn't at home --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- when they called, [LAUGH] so I had to keep calling.
L:  The same exact thing happened to me yesterday.
R:  Really? [LAUGH] Oh, they ca- --
L:  They called me and I didn't have my PIN number with me.
R:  Yeah, so I had -- I was out shopping and -- and had to just hang up and call back -- c- come home, get on the computer, [LAUGH] look at my email, where's my PIN number?  And I was trying all these PIN numbers that I thought -- like, I couldn't remember if we chose it or if they gave it to us, so I was trying all the four digit PIN numbers that I use [LAUGH] and they just kept saying, "That is incorrect.  Please try again".  So, [LAUGH] but anyway.
L:  That's interesting.  The same thing happened to me yesterday, and I had to go home and pull my email up and get it.
R:  [LAUGH] That's funny.
L:  Now I have it saved on my cell phone so I can look it up as soon as they call.
R:  Oh, that's a good idea.  Oh, that's a good idea.  Uh, [inaudible] other games.  Rollercoaster Tycoon, um --
L:  No.
R:  Now -- oh, there is one.  It's a really good educational -- I mean, at -- when she gets older, [NOISE] but this -- there's, um, I think Rollercoaster Tycoon --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they gotta enter -- you build, uh, theme parks on the computer.
L:  Oh, okay.  I think I've seen that.
R:  And --
L:  I've never actually played it, but I've seen it.
R:  Yeah.  And what -- what he actually -- what -- when I started watching him, what he was actually doing, I mean, it was teaching them all about basically management.  I mean, you had to manage your resources, you had -- you know, if -- if there were not enough people, if there wasn't enough food, um, finances, they have a budget.  I mean, it was just -- I was really amazed that something could be that fun and educational without them realizing it.
L:  Yeah, that's good when that happens.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We got a lot of CD ROMs that are Reader Rabbit that my daughter loves to play, and they're very educational.
R:  Oh, yeah, I've seen those advertised.  They weren't out when -- when my kids were little, so those look really cool.  But I don't [SIGH] -- I don't have a need for those anymore unfortunately.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I think we've been talking ten minutes.  I'm not sure if they come back or not.  I don't know.
L:  I think it's been at least ten minutes.  I don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what's gonna happen either.
R:  Well, I guess --
L:  But we'll know after today.
R:  We'll do what?  We'll know after we hang off. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
