L:  Regina Edmondson[?].
R:  Hello, my name is Elliott Walls[?].
L:  Oh, hi.
R:  Hello.  Um, so what do you think about this policy? [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I think it's a pretty good one.  I've -- I'm a big thing on ah, [LAUGH] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- hiring within the community and doing different things like that.
R:  Okay.  Okay.  Um, well, initially -- um, I used to think that affirmative action was a great thing, um, just a couple of years back.  But recently I've been convinced that, um, it would be better in fact if businesses could hire just whoever they think is best for the job and not necessarily based -- and, like, um, stipulate like a quota or something, based on race or, um, any other, sort of, like other discriminating factors.
L:  Yeah, I've noticed that quite a bit of that's going on in different places since I've been involved with the chamber of Commerce.
R:  [NOISE] Okay --
L:  There's certain places that, you know, go right on with whatever they think's going to fit --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- into their company, instead of the right person.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've definitely noticed that.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Some -- some places are doing pretty good, hiring the person who's actually qualified for the job.
R:  Mm.  Yeah, I personally think that that's the best option.  Even though, like, I'm a [inaudible] -- I'm an Asian American and, um -- um, I don't know if -- well, actually in today's society, I don't even know if that puts me at a disadvantage or actually at an advantage, but I don't think, um, affirmative action is something that really is necessary in most, um -- like at least most -- more like cosmopolitan [several inaudible words] in the States.  Like if you're looking for a job in New York city, um, generally I don't think race or anything makes a difference anymore.  But I don't know.
L:  Well, I know in some places here [inaudible] -- well, some places that I've noticed around where I live --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- they're hiring, it seems like based on, ah, different religions and things like that.  But --
R:  Oh, really.  Okay.
L:  Yeah and it- it's a strange, strange thing, ah, you know, we used to have -- I used to work at a human resources place --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and a -- like a temporary place --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- and, ah, they used to have different policies for different companies and I never could understand why they did have --
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  -- and I always thought, "Well, you know, it's --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- it's a neat thing.  Everybody knows what they want, you know, for their company".
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, so I -- I was really a firm believer in it.
R:  Okay.
L:  And then I got to thinking, "Ah, you know, maybe not".  I don't know, because I've been out of it for a long time, so.
R:  All right.  [NOISE] Oh.  Well, it sounds like you have a lot more experience in this kind of respect than I do, because I'm still in school so I'm -- I'm not really quite yet exposed to the whole climate -- the business climate yet.  Ah ...
L:  So, ah, what are you training for?  You training for human resources?
R:  Um, no actually I'm just, um, I -- I -- I'm -- I'm -- actually, I'm studying Japanese right now. [NOISE]
L:  Oh.
R:  But um -- yeah [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess maybe I got the phone call because I am an Asian American.  I don't know.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Maybe.  I guess.  [NOISE] Ah.
L:  Well, you know that -- well, it -- it could be, I guess, because if you're going to be getting involved in any kind of business, one time or another, you're going to have to either interview somebody or you're --
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  -- going to have to visit with somebody on a job.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  You know?  And you're going to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have to make a decision on whether they can actually do the job or not.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Sure.
L:  And a lot of companies still have that policy of affirmative action --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- quite a few of the more corporate companies.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  So, that's there -- [LAUGH] that is kind of strange, isn't it? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] Sure.
L:  But we've -- we've already -- always did the -- ah, you know, "Each company has their own profile --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that you have to go by".  Some, ah -- specialty companies you have to put in your height, your weight, your age, you know --"
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- what -- what color the skin is, what type of religion, you know, even what kind of shoes you wear --
R:  Interesting.
L:  -- which, to me, is a little bit too technical. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  So, does that -- does that information usually end up getting used in, ah -- in the selection of your -- of the candidates or anything or just ...?
L:  Well, I think if -- let's say if you're going to do an acting job, yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah, true.  Definitely.
L:  You know, but if you're -- if you're going to be, ah, sitting behind a desk talking on a telephone, I can't see what your height, your weight or what the color of your skin is --
R:  [NOISE] No.
L: -- you know, it's going to matter.
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.
L:  You know?  So -- but I guess, ah, some companies just feel that, you know, they've got a -- a scheme that you need to fit into.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I --
L:  That's my --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  So, that's my kind of opinion on -- on some companies, not all of them.
R:  Mm.
L:  I think they do it like there's, ah, merchandising jobs or mystery shopping jobs --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that -- where you need to fit a certain critique to go into mystery shopper --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- something like that.
R:  True.
L:  So, have you ever been interviewed to the point where somebody's asked you questions like that?
R:  Um, not really, no.  I've only been like a waiter before and then there was just a very like druid sort of job, summer job and it really wasn't that big of deal.  Um --
L:  And -- and you didn't have to fill out that kind of information on your application?
R:  No, not at all.
L:  Oh, well that's good.
R:  Well, I don't know -- that -- that was in -- this was in Taipei, in Taiwan.  So, I guess the entire climate -- well, there's not as much racial diversity in Taiwan or religious diversity or anything else.  There is -- there is in the States --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I guess it's not that much of an issue.  Um --
L:  Well, I know here in a lot of places there's, you know, different -- like I say, again, different companies have these different criterias they go by and, you know, there's still companies that are -- that are, to me, a little more prejudiced than, you know, they should be for the -- for the day and the time --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so they do -- they will put on the application different things that I learned in school was, you know, you cannot ask. --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's illegal to ask.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But they still -- you know, you can't ask if someone's married.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You can't ask that.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Ah, yeah, that's illegal.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, you just cannot do it.  You cannot, ah -- you're not supposed to be able to ask religion --
R:  Uh-huh.
L: -- you know, or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- political, ah, beliefs.
R:  Mm.
L:  That's, you know, just taboo --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you can't do it.
R:  Okay.
L:  But a lot --
R:  [several inaudible words].  Um, sorry I was just wondering, um, if you might have noticed any patterns, like -- is -- there are these kind of -- if like in a certain industry, like, companies tend to be more prying about personal details, or if like -- or if it's just kind of random with different companies?
L:  Well, in -- in -- doing the temporary work that I did it was kind of random.  It'd be kind of hit and miss.
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:   You know, they'd, ah --
R:  So, there'd be companies in all different industries that did this --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's not like ...?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, we'd have, ah, it -- it -- like I say, it seemed like more of the -- the big corporate companies, you know?
R:  Oh.
L:  I -- I kind of thought it -- you know, in my way of thinking, of course I might think different than other people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I always thought that they had the same that they went by, they wanted certain people in there and certain people not --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it's -- you know, the feeling that I got.
R:  Mm.
L:  We had some people from India that interviewed for us one time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they were perf- -- they had the perfect skills for a job, but didn't get it --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- because they had another interview with the actual company that was hiring us --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and they did not let them have the job and that kind of made me wonder, you know, "Why, they had the skills".
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  They had the experience, they had the -- the -- you know, the -- the professional look, attitude --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, everything but they didn't get it.  And it always -- to this day, it made me wonder.  You know, if --
R:  That's really interesting.
L:  Yeah, I -- it -- it -- you know -- and we've had, ah -- you know, just -- just different people from different areas or walks of life, that didn't get the job that were actually perfect for it.  You know?
R:  Wow.
L:  And --
R:  Can I -- can I ask just, um, where it was that you had your job?  Like, wh- where these companies were based sort of thing?
L:  Well, ah --
R:  I don't -- ah, you know.
L:  -- the company -- the company that I worked for was called Benchmark[?] --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- at Diversified[?] Group.
R:  All right.
L:  And they had contracts with the companies from all over, like St Louis and Springfield and stuff like that.  And we were not --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- privy to their actual name.
R:  Okay.
L:  We could only do the interviewing.
R:  Okay.
L:  And so ...
R:  Okay.  Sure. [NOISE] [inaudible].
L:  So, that kind of -- you know [LAUGH] that's one of the reasons why I'm not with them anymore. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Because I don't go for that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you're qualified to do the job --
R:  Good for you.  Good for you.
L:  You know?  Yeah, exac- -- you know, I'm the type of person if you're qualified to do the job, go do it.  You know?
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  If you're not, you know, go to school, learn how to do it, then come back. [LAUGH]
R:  Come back.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I used to think that -- that should be the way it is and -- and if companies hired based on that kind of an attitude then there would be no n- need for affirmative action.  So, I guess, you know, all companies don't necessarily do that.  But yeah [several inaudible words].
L:  Well, it -- you know, like I say, in some cases I -- I kind of do in ways agree with affirmative action --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- depending on the job scope itself.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, if there -- if there are certain --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- certain requirements -- certain physical requirements, you know, like say in acting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like -- like I said before, yeah, that's fine, you know, if it requires, you know, the ten foot tall person or whatever --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- the case is, you know [LAUGH] go for it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But in -- in regular corporative, ah, fields and stuff, I can't see it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because nine times out of ten you're not meeting, ah, people to get other people's opinion, because you know how people across the United States and other countries have different opinions on what you should look like.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  Or -- or be like.  You know?  So, to me --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- unless they're hiring and paying your -- your paycheck or actually living with you, there's not a lot of opinion other people should have. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Of course I -- you know, like I say, I've got a difference of opinion.  So, I haven't been in hu- -- ah, human resources in about three years --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so a lot of -- a lot of laws and things might have changed.
R:  Might have changed.  Yeah.  [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.  So, you know, in my opinion, you know, like I said, if you're qualified do it, if you're not get the qualifications.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ah, I don't know if, ah -- I don't know if affirmative action's something that they're going to change in the near future.  Like I said, some places did have it and some places should not.  [several inaudible words] should not, but you know.
R:  Yeah.  Because where I -- see I was going to say something before, I forgot.  So.
L:  Well, I'm a blabber mouth.  Blah, blah, blah. [LAUGH]
R:  No, no, no.  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's good.  No.  Yeah.  Um --
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, that's right!  Because um, I remember when I was applying for colleges and they had people put, ah, photographs in their, um, applications, like head shots of kids and I thought -- I -- I totally thought it was completely unnecessary and I didn't really see why they would have people do it.  Because -- I don't know, I just
