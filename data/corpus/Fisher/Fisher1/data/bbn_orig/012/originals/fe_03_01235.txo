L:  Gloria.
R:  Hi, I'm Susan. [NOISE]
L:  Susan?
R:  Yes.
L:  Hi, this is Gloria.  How are you?
R:  I'm okay, how are you doing?
L:  Good.
R:  This is my first time, so you [LAUGH] -- so, you have to excuse me.  I was waiting for something else to happen there.
L:  Oh, that's [several inaudible words] I was kind of like, "Hm".
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I -- I never heard a tone. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I was expecting a call on my home phone and it came on my cell phone, so.
R:  Uh-oh.  Okay. [LAUGH]  Well, what do you think about affirmative action?
L:  Well, I don't have -- I'm not real opinionated on it, to be quite honest with you.  Um, ah, what's your opinion?
R:  Well, I -- I -- I'm not really, um, opinionated on it I guess.  I worked for the government for eight years, so I saw a lot of affirmative action in the workplace and what I did see of it in the government realm, was not good.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, [NOISE] just because there were people being promoted who did not, um, deserve to be --
L:  Technically, [several inaudible words].  Yeah.
R:  But because -- right.  But because they were in the affirmative action programme, you know, they were promoted.  I mean, I -- I was a very low grade and I was writing the letters for a guy who was three grades above me who was my supervisor, that could not spell. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So -- yeah.  So, you know, um, that's -- I've not had a good experience with it.  I think in the beginning the programme was probably a good idea --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I think the powers that be that got involved with it, um, and used it to, ah, their advantage and the people they knew, I think they've -- they've corrupted it to the point that it's no good anymore.
L:  Oh, I'd have to agree with you on that.  I -- I don't -- I don't agree with the fact that, um, people are getting hired --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- based on -- not experience or how well they can do the job.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  See, I -- I don't agree with that.  I can't say that I've -- I'm not in a work position where that's really -- comes in -- affects me directly --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- but I -- I don't -- I think people should be hired based on their knowledge and how well they can do the job.
R:  Right.  I agree.
L:  Not -- not any type of what's your sex or your ethnic background is or anything like that.
R:  Right.  And it -- and it shouldn't -- you know and there again, my father also worked with a Brazilian -- um, for the government and it was one of those things that, ah, he got passed over many times for a promotion because he was a white male.
L:  Right.
R:  And h- he was more qualified for things, but they had to have a quota and so therefore, I -- I've not seen it since I've gotten into private industry -- I've not seen it be as manipulated as it is in the government industry.  So, um, I -- maybe -- maybe it's doing better, um, private industry wise than it is, you know, in the government.
L:  Correct.
R:  So, I -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah, I -- as I say, I -- as I say, I think it's more directly effected in the government jobs or it seems to be anyway.
R:  Right.  Oh, well I was just thinking today -- where I worked, um, today, we have fifty five people in the office that I'm in right now and of course the majority are a -- are women because, ah, of the type of positions that are available there, but we have -- um, out of those fifty five people we have one black --
L:  Right.
R:  -- female.  And that's it as far as a minority.  Now, we did have, I think, some Indians -- ah, a couple of Indians, ah, you know, in ethnicity, but um, we probably are -- are very below in the ethnicity portion where we are not with the gender, so --
L:  Correct.
R:  -- you know, I guess we can get by with it that way, um, although I don't think the people that are in management there are biased in any way one way or the other, it's just one of those things where if you do the job good, you're going to have it.  So --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, do you work?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  Uh-huh.  What --
L:  I work for a coll- -- I work basically -- actually, um, there's only other -- one other woman --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- in the department that I work in.  So, I'm --
R:  Right.
L:  -- primarily working with males, I don't know that it's necessarily, um, by choice, it's just -- it's -- I work for a sales -- for a bunch of salesmen --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and of course that -- that, um, group seems to be more -- men are more -- actually wanting to take that type of job.
R:  Right.  I agree with that. [LAUGH] Had one of those, don't want another one. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah and the two women that did have the position that all the men have, actually didn't work out just because it does seem more of a -- a male, um, type of job --
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  -- so.
R:  Well and I -- you know, I -- I would really like to see affirmative action go in a direction that it needs to go, which is wh- what it was instituted to do, which was to help minorities, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to -- you know to be able to -- but -- but the one thing is, they're not -- it's not helping minorities in the way that it was formulated to, which was to be able to get them into the workplace and have them paid equally.  Um, you know, we're --
L:  As I say, now it's -- yeah.  Now it seems like --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- that -- um, that people are getting the opinion that sometimes minorities are getting the jobs primarily because they had to be -- that position had to be filled by --
R:  That's right.
L: -- someone -- by a minority.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I -- I definitely agree with that, because I've -- you know, I've seen it happen.
L:  Right.
R:  Like I said, I think that's more in the government and I -- I don't know as far as like the military, um, I'm not sure about that.  Um, I've only seen it on the civilian side so I don't know, you know, what the -- what the -- the military portion of that would be.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and I -- I -- I don't know -- I don't know a way to, um, correct how it is now.  I mean, do you have any ideas on that?
L:  Oh, gosh, no.  Because like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [several inaudible words] probably started with good intentions but had -- there's a lot of things that sort of the good intentions and then they either back fire or -- back fire or they snowball into something else and ...
R:  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  And I -- I think it's going to take a -- um, a -- a certain -- I don't know if it's going to be a generation that's going t- to be able to change it or if they're actually going to do away -- have to do away with it i- in order to correct it to what it needs to be.  Um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- at this point I -- I kind of feel like it needs to be taken away.  Um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it -- because of the fact that it is so misused and there's a lot of people who are, um -- you know, they're penalized [NOISE] because of it being in place.
L:  Right.
R:  And I think it would be a lot better if they would just totally delete it from the system and [inaudible] --
L:  And try to rewrite something with --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- something with a different type of guidelines.
R:  Right.
L:  I agree.
R:  Right.  Right.  You know, and -- and I don't -- I don't know if anything like that -- I have not read anything on it recently, I guess because with everything else that's going on right now.  Um, it's kind of been in the -- on the back burner, whereas used to -- it used to be a really big deal.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, so, I don't know if anybody really has any ideas of that -- you know, with congress doing their new budgets and things like that, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've not read anything.  I'm -- I'm not really up on that sort of stuff.  So, I, um -- I've not seen anything in the news or anything recently that -- that actually speaks to affirmative action.
L:  Oh, yeah, I was going to say there's bigger -- there's bigger things going on right now.  So, I don't know if anybody's taking a proactive --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- look into doing something differently or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- yeah, I'm not -- I haven't -- the only thing that's been on the news lately has been about the war, so.
R:  Yeah, that's right, [LAUGH] that's the only thing that's on there. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] Really don't have a choice, do you?
R:  That's right.  Well, you know, and you think about Iraq and the people over there, they don't have a afir- -- well, I guess they do have affirmative action it's just the fact that their affirmative action is, he's in charge and he's going to tell who -- who can do what. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  But ah, you know, so I guess we -- we really can't complain too much, even though, ah, we feel like it's a programme that has not done what it was supposed to.  We still have the choice of being able to go out and do other things, so.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Unlike -- unlike, you know, the people there, so.
L:  As I say, at least we have -- um, we're lucky to, ah -- to talk about affirmative action and the benefits and -- and the bad sides of it, because not too many countries have a choice of ...
R:  Right.  Well -- and, you know, you think about it and I don't know -- I'm not familiar -- are you familiar with the fact that -- if it is actually in any other country besides the United States?
L:  No, I'm not.
R:  I don't think it is.
L:  But I can't imag- -- as I say, I can't imagine that it would be.
R:  Right.  I think, you know, they're -- they pretty much have their hierarchies and it's like, ah, we used to be a long time ago and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we are really the only ones who have actually tried to, ah, make a b- -- a better world of it, so --
L:  Yeah, make it -- make a [inaudible] of it.
R:  Yeah, we're definitely better off in that sense.  Um and as women, you know, we -- I guess we should be happy that it's there because I'm sure at some point --
L:  We're getting jobs that --
R:  -- I got a job because of it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because they're saying that women are getting jobs because of it, but at the same time, um, I just -- I just feel like the person with the -- more experience or more knowledge or, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- should get -- should get that position.
R:  Well, and I -- and this is just my opinion and I'm not sure if it's -- if it's correct or not, but I think that there's more emphasis now placed on the ethnicity then there is the gender.
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, you know, and I think that that's where it started going wrong.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, moreso the -- just because um we just -- we have people who, um, are in positions that -- when they do get in it because of affirmative action they turn around and they hire other people because they have that ability, through the same programme that put them there.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um -- and I -- and I think, ah, you know, probably every state has that problem --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and -- and even in the state government, much less just
