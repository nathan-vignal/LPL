R:  I have like maybe --
L:  Well --

R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH]
L:  I -- I -- I'm a computer science major --

R:  So, you know more about the technology and stuff, yeah? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, sometimes we get one movie that we like and we watch it over and over again.  Every time it comes on, you know?
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's -- that's exactly m- [LAUGH] -- ah, my [several inaudible words].  I -- oh, the movie -- ah, I don't watch a whole lot of movie, I just watch, ah, [inaudible] or groups of movie and not watch it over and over again. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, ah -- oh, no I -- I like, ah, sci fi movies very much but my -- my -- the best movie I have watched was Braveheart [LAUGH] by Mel Gibson. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  You liked that one? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I really liked that one.  That's -- that's the only -- only one I -- I bought --I bought a -- a DVD and, ah, want to keep it as my collections. [SIGH]

R:  -- one time we rented it for a five day rental and he watched it about -- at least like two or three times every day that we had it. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow. [LAUGH]
R:  So, then we went out and bought it and he kept watching it over and over but eventually we lost it, which I was kind of glad. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Because you get to know every single scene, you know?  It gets kind of [LAUGH] monotonous after a while. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Ah, you ever watched --

R:  Yeah, we always -- we always wait for our favorite scenes to come on, like the one where he says something about, "I think you should go back to Greenbo Alabama". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We always wait for that part, you know, certain parts. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Mm.  It's one of those things.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I remember -- I don't know, when I was younger we used to always watch like the Star Wars movies over and over again and different stuff [NOISE] but I haven't even seen the new Star Wars movies at all. [NOISE]

R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- George Lucas has directed, ah, two -- two new series and, ah, the last one might come out next year.

R:  Yeah?
L:  The -- the [inaudible] -- the -- the [inaudible] War.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  And, ah, I -- I think it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [several inaudible words] rent both one in Blockbuster. [LAUGH]
R:  Huh?
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  I can rent them?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I could rent --
L:  They come out as -- as DVDs in Blockbuster.
R:  Yeah, you know, I'm on spring break this week, maybe I should rent a couple of movies one of these days. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Something different.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.  There's someone else here with me and she rented My Big Fat Greek Wedding.  [NOISE] Everyone says that's good.  I want to see that too.

L:  Oh, right.  It's-- it's  a movie that my friends are talking about but I haven't got a chance to watch it yet.

R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it just come out as -- as DVD.  So, I can rent a- -- in Blockbuster.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] Hey, maybe I should rent that one and try out my new DVD player [LAUGH] that I haven't used yet. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I -- I don't have a DVD player but -- but ah since my notebook, ah, has a DVD rom, [SIGH] so --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- maybe I just watch it, ah, from, ah, my notebook. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, when I got my computer I could have gotten a DVD in it, but I thought if I want to watch a movie I'd probably want to watch it on the TV, not on the computer, so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know --
L:  The nice --
R:  But then I went and got a DVD player.
L:  The -- the nice thing about, ah, watching movies from, ah, a DVD rom --  [several inaudible words] computer studio, um, is that there are quite a few DVDs that have, ah, some computer [several inaudible words] feature that you can only watch the -- in [several inaudible words] from a computer DVD.
R:  Oh, I didn't know that.
L:  Ah, last week I -- I watched DVD called Shrek, maybe you have watched that before, [LAUGH] it's a computer generated a- animation --
R:  Yeah, I -- well, I've seen parts of it, yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's very hilarious. [LAUGH]
R:  They put it on at my daughter's daycare [LAUGH] sometimes.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] I think that's a great movie.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Rea- really made people laugh. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, that DVD has some -- some mini games, ah, that if you have -- you can only play from a computer DVD rom.
R:  Oh.
L:  -- [several inaudible words].
R:  So, it has to have a DVD then, huh?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] You can't see them from a --
