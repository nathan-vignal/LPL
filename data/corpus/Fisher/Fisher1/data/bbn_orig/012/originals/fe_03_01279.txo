L:  Hi, this is Jim.
R:  Hi, I'm Karen.
L:  Karen?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Hi.  How do you keep up with current events?
R:  Well, I -- lately, for the past week, I've been watching television, but usually it's the internet.
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, the internet at home or at work?
R:  Uh-huh, both.
L:  Oh, both, uh-huh.  Do you have a -- a favorite website that you get most of your news?
R:  I watch, um -- well, I usually go on CNN.
L:  Uh-huh, but --
R:  And that's what I watch at home, too, on the television.
L:  I see.  Um, I never fo- -- go to either of those places.  I -- I don't get cable, so, uh, [SIGH] but, um, yeah, when I am home, um, mostly the TV but also, um, I listen to the news radio pretty much all day long at work.  [LIPSMACK] And then, um, for stock market news, I'm -- I'm on the internet, um, uh, throughout the day.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I teach school so it's difficult for me to keep a radio on.
L:  Oh, impossible.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  What -- what grade do you teach?
R:  Kindergarten.
L:  Sorry?
R:  Kindergarten.
L:  Uh-huh.  Wow.  And you can use the internet there?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Huh.  Uh-huh.  So, I -- I imagine as far as current events go, mostly war news or ...?
R:  Right now, yeah.
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I feel like I'm behind on my war news.  I don't keep up with all the details, um, just the kind of general picture.
R:  Yeah, I feel like I'm being flooded, though.  My husband has it on constant.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So, when he's -- when he's home, that's when I, you know, get all the details.  Nor- normally, uh, I probably wouldn't sit and watch it 'cause it is very depressing. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, with -- you know, he has it on so I've been keeping up with it.
L:  Yeah.  How 'bout the newspaper?
R:  I really don't read the newspaper because I do so much reading and, you know, at school, that when I'm home that's the last thing I wanna do.
L:  I see.
R:  I -- I do enjoy the internet, though.  Uh, to me, I find it very relaxing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I do a lot of reading on the internet, but as far as paper books, I -- I'm not -- no, so --
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  Not even -- it's hard for me to even sit long enough to read a magazine.
L:  Uh-huh.  But you can read on the internet, though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh. [COUGH] Um, when I -- when I do grab the paper at work, um, I, well, look at the front page, but then mostly the letter to -- letters to the editor.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I find those, um, you know, more revealing about what people are thinking.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  And then I go to, um, um, Boondocks, the cartoon.
R:  I'm not familiar with it.
L:  Oh, you'll have to check it out.  Um, that's more of a political commentary on what's going on.
R:  Mm.
L:  Specifically African American issues many times.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's on the cutting edge, it really is.
R:  I'll have to look at it.
L:  Yeah, definitely.  Um, [COUGH] and I -- I w- went to a talk of the, uh, creator of that cartoon.
R:  Mhm.
L:  A young fella, I think he's twenty seven years old, and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just very, you know, got very lucky to get this opportunity.  Overnight he was in two hundred and fifty newspapers.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So ...
R:  I think my dogs wanna talk.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, what other current events, um, do you follow?
R:  [NOISE] What other ones?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I read up on education issues. [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, a lot -- local -- a lot of the local and, um --
L:  Yeah.  What -- what city are you from?
R:  Winter Park[?], Florida.
L:  In Florida?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Chic- --
R:  It's right outside of Orlando.
L:  Uh-huh.  I'm in Chicago.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.  Right.  Uh, do you follow, um, stock market news at all?
R:  No.
L:  Not at all?
R:  No.  My husband does.
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, he's the more analytical side.
L:  I see.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um --
R:  I'm more at the five year old level. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um, let's see.  Do you have --
R:  I can tell you all the new cartoons and all the -- the five year old toys and ... [LAUGH]
L:  Well, those -- those would be considered current events, kind of.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Um, what other TV programs then, besides CNN?  Do you watch, like, Nightline at night or ...?
R:  I do.  A- and then I watch -- I -- I'm really not big into but I do watch, um, some of the talk shows.
L:  Oh, like which ones?
R:  Uh, Oprah's one of my favorites. [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.  Do you have to tape that?
R:  No, I -- I don't.  We have a DVD player.  We don't have VCR.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, but I mean, you -- you record it and then watch it at night?
R:  No, it's on at night.  It's on in the afternoon.
L:  Oh.  Oh, really?  Oh, okay, I didn't know that.  Oh, I was thinking just in the morning.
R:  No, I didn't even know she came on in the morning.
L:  Oh, yeah, here in Chicago it's, uh, nine o'clock, uh, in the morning.
R:  Oh, it's four o'clock in the afternoon here.
L:  Uh-huh, I see. [SIGH] Hm.  No --
R:  Have you ever done one of these studies before?
L:  Um, not like this, no.
R:  I have -- I haven't e- ever.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  This is my first one.
L:  And how did you find out about it?
R:  On the internet. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, a friend of mine is in the linguistics field, and so she referred me.
R:  Well, it's funny they called me now.  I just had, um, um, surgery on my vocal cords, so my voice is really probably not the way it normally is right now.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's a little higher.  I just had it done last Friday.
L:  Interesting.  Uh-huh.  Well, I suppose that's current events, too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH] Um, do you ever watch this program, um, w- -- Bill Moyers[?] Now?
R:  No.
L:  The -- the name of the pr- -- it's on, um, public television and it -- you've -- you've gotta watch it.  I think it's the best TV show on all of TV.  So, if you have access to, like, a public broadcasting channel --
R:  Uh-huh, yes, we do.
L:  Um, yeah, it's u- -- well, round here it's either on Friday nights or Sunday morning, but as far as talk shows go, he interviews many people.  He does very little talking.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but he, um, he interviews people in a way that you -- you won't hear on regular TV at all, and you feel like, um, you're getting a more, you know, honest discussion.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I watched, um -- I've been watching for the past few nights Larry King.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I don't get cable so I don't see him at all.  Yeah.  Uh, so are you in -- in favor of the war or against the war?
R:  Um, I'm kinda mixed emotions.  Um, well, my ex husband was in the military, so I really, you know, do have a -- a strong sense of protecting our country, you know, I -- but then on the other hand, a- as a mother, you know, I'm sitting back watching eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty one year olds, and it's disturbing, you know.  It really is.  It's -- it's disturbing.
L:  Yeah, I -- I think that's kind of the test then.  I mean, if we really believed that it was a one hundred percent just cause and worthwhile, you know, um, I don't think there would be that much ambiguity.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I'm very much against it.  That, um --
R:  So, is -- yeah, my brother is, too.  My brother lives in LA, so he's [SIGH] -- and he's in the film business.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He's a writer, so, you know, I mean, when I talk to him I feel like everything, you know, he has to say is a thousand percent true, [LAUGH] you know, but then I sit back and I go, you know, well, I don't know.  I -- I do have some mixed feelings about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I really do.  I have very mixed feelings.  So, I really, you know -- it's hard for me to say whether really I'm for or against.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm patriotic, but that -- on the other hand, I -- there just -- I don't know.  It's depressing to watch.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I think, you know, if there's that much question, um, about whether we should be fighting, then I think there's your answer.  Otherwise -- you know, I -- I don't think you -- you want much question whether --
R:  Right.
L:  You know, if you're gonna go to war and kill.  Um, it's mostly the civilians.  I'm, you know, I -- I -- just the thought of, you know, somebody like me in Iraq, um, getting killed for no good reason.
R:  Right and [NOISE] been watching, you know, the --
