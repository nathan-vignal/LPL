L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, I'm Candace.
R:  I'm Blain[?].
L:  Hi.  So, um, I'm not -- [LAUGH] -- do you like movies?
R:  You know, I like em but around here where I'm at -- I'm in a small town --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so the theater's so small there's no room to move.  There's -- the picture's terrible, the sound is terrible, I'd rather watch it at home where I have a nice surround sound entertainment centre.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But --
L:  Where are you fr- --
R:  What's that?
L:  [inaudible].  Um, [SIGH] yeah I usually like -- I guess I'd like to watch movies at home better though. [NOISE]
R:  Why's that?
L:  I guess it kind of depends, I mean -- I don't know, sometimes you just don't want to be around the crowds. [NOISE]
R:  That's true.
L:  But our movie theater's, [SIGH] um, probably about half an hour away, so that's not too bad.  So, what was the last movie you saw?
R:  The last movie I saw ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, actually the last one I saw in a theatre was, um, Old School.  But I just watched Dream Catcher at home last night.
L:  Dream Catcher, which one's that?
R:  Oh, it's the latest and greatest.  It just hit theatres yesterday so I know some --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people in the industry that give me the stuff ahead of time.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, well that's cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  A lot better quality and nice to see the movie before you go to a theatre and waste the time on it.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I would like to do that.  Yeah, I think the last one I watched was, um, How To Lose A Guy In Ten Days.
R:  How was that?
L:  Oh, I loved it.  I'm a sucker for, like, romance movies though. [LAUGH]
R:  Hey, whatever works.
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I watch most anything but lately there just hasn't been any good movies, I don't think.  I mean really good movies that you have to see.
L:  Yeah.  I know I can usually wait -- I just usually wait until they come out on a -- um, at the movie store --
R:  I can believe that.
L:  -- at the video store.
R:  I'm the same way a lot of times with them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and if it's -- if it's worth it, I'll go and see it but that's kind of because this town has like nothing else to do.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, either you get in -- you get in trouble with the police or you end up, you know, at a theatre watching the movies for the fifteenth time or something like that.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, um, well I have two kids so I never get out to a movie.  So, when [LAUGH] -- when I do it's kind of a special occasion, get away from em.
R:  That must make it hard.  How old are they?  Sounds like one's pretty young.
L:  Yes, one's sitting on me, she's fourteen months and then I have a three year old son.
R:  Ooh, a three year old.  Ouch, that's a handful.
L:  Yeah, he's -- he's pretty mellow for the m- most part but -- oh, he's usually pretty good, he goes to the movies with me quite a bit.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, he sits through em pretty good.
R:  You're going to take him to the Piglet movie?
L:  Um, I'm thinking about.  He really likes to go -- he likes the popcorn the most part.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So [LAUGH] -- so, he -- yeah he -- he's pretty good to take to the movies.  So -- but um -- jeez --
R:  That's cool.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] I don't think there's any other movies that I want to see right now.
R:  There's not a whole lot of them.  Not lately there hasn't been and I mean there's a bunch of movies coming out but I don't think there's anything really worth watching.  At least no must sees again but I don't know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- maybe we'll be surprised.
L:  Yeah, there's, ah, one -- the anger management one that my husband wants to see.
R:  [LAUGH] That's not a bad movie.
L:  But I don't think that -- hey?
R:  That's not a bad one, it's not great but not bad.
L:  Yeah, hey well all of Adam Sandler's movies haven't been that good lately.
R:  Yeah, that's very true.
L:  He's like -- he's -- I don't know, they're not [LAUGH] as violent I guess [LAUGH] as the first ones.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] So ... [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you run out of ideas eventually.  I mean, he pretty much only plays one character, so.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, how many different ways can you manipulate that, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Have you seen his one it's Overboard?
R:  Overboard ...  I don't think so.
L:  I wouldn't recommend it.  I thought it was the stupidest movie I have ever seen.
R:  Ah, wouldn't surprise me.
L:  It didn't make much sense.
R:  I can't even think of the movies --  I can't even think of any his movies.  All I can think of is like Happy Gilmour and I think that was it.  That's all I can remember right now.  I don't know.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  Um [LAUGH] I know there was another one.
R:  What was his last one?  He did, um, Mister Deeds and then that Eight Crazy Nights, I think were his last ones.
L:  I haven't seen the Eight Crazy Nights.
R:  Ah, neither have I but I've heard it's not that great.
L:  Oh.  Yeah, my husband didn't like the, um, Mister Deeds, just because it wasn't really him.
R:  Yeah --
L:  But --
R:  -- it -- it's definitely not his character.
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- yeah I can't think of -- I know that he -- he had another one though that I thought, besides the, um, Happy Gil- -- Happy Gilmore, was that it?
R:  Happy Gilmour and --
L:  [several inaudible words] said.
R:  -- what was the other one?  There was another one like, it was like, um -- oh, I can't even think of it.
L:  Yeah, um --
R:  There was the golf one and there was one where he was the burnt out -- [inaudible] -- oh, I can't think of it.  Yeah, there was another one just like that.  I cannot think of it.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah, I kn- -- I know I've seen em all.  [MN] Oh, jeeze -- so, if you get to see movies before hand --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  -- is there any good ones coming out?
R:  Um, Dream Catcher's not bad.  It's -- it's kind of a -- it's a Stephen King --
L:  Yeah, I can't watch scary [LAUGH] --
R:  -- movie, so -- yeah, exactly.  It -- it's something where it's not really bad.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The book is by far much worse than the movie.
L:  Oh, man --
R:  Um, but with that said, it's not really bad.  What else is there ...?
L:  Oh, is that the -- no, that's The Tooth Fairy, I think.
R:  Yeah, that's pretty much it, there's really not much else --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- coming out.
L:  [NOISE] [inaudible] --
R:  I don't know they're -- they're coming out with them constantly but I can't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- even think of half of them.  Most of them --
L:  Yeah, I can't either.  [NOISE] Um, oh jeeze --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  I don't know they've got a couple of comedies coming out, one's called Boat Trip --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- with Cuba Gooding Junior and, ah, Horatio Sanz.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Not a bad comedy.  Not spectacular, but not bad.
L:  You've seen it?  Have you seen that --
R:  That was actually.  Yeah, I saw that one.  That wasn't -- like I say, it wasn't spectacular but it was ...  I'd say worth the time of going to see.
L:  Yeah?  I thought about it.  Um, another one I really wanted to see was the ah How To Lose A Guy In Ten Days and there was another one ...  But I can never -- I don't know, I never remember em. [NOISE] So, I usually end up waiting till they come out. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just easier to sit at home and watch em.
R:  It is a lot of times.
L:  The only thing that sucks is I love movie theatre popcorn.
R:  [LAUGH] Most people do.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I wish I could just go [LAUGH] and buy the popcorn and leave. [LAUGH]
R:  You know the theatre here, actually they say that people do that all the time.
L:  Do they?
R:  They get a lot a people that just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- walk in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- buy the popcorn and leave.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, man. [NOISE] Have to try that --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- sometime, I guess. [NOISE]
R:  It's a small town.  I mean, people will have no --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- problem doing that and the money all pretty much goes to the same place anyway.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  [several inaudible words] whether you watch it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at home or you rent it from somewhere.
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
R:  I don't know, it's kind of nice to live in a small town, on the other hand there's some inconveniences, like we don't always get the [several inaudible words] movies and ...
L:  Yeah.  How small is your town?
R:  Oh, about six thousand people.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Um, right in the middle of nowhere in Montana.
L:  Ooh. [SIGH]
R:  Which pretty much applies to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- every town on Montana, but ...
L:  I bet it's pretty though. [NOISE]
R:  It is, it's -- it's worth it, that's why I've stayed around here.
L:  Yeah.  Wasn't there like -- is -- is -- are you around like, ah, a bigger town that has like movie theatres or big ones or good ones?
R:  Nearest town from here is twenty three miles away, um and it's actually over some rather treacherous roads.
L:  Oh.
R:  And that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that has a bunch of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- theatres in it, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- getting -- getting there's a headache a lot of times.
L:  Yeah.  They have, um -- see our next town over they have two movie theatres [several inaudible words] but um, that town is like really gross --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Really -- like really it's really gross, there's hippies everywhere.  And then, um, the next one over --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's probably about half an hour away, it has two movie theatres that are pretty good, so ...  They're just building us a theatre though, in our town.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's taken them like a year and they don't even have it half way done but [SIGH] hopefully --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- pretty soon we can watch movies [LAUGH] in a movie theatre.
R:  The one we have isn't spectacular but not bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's um -- ah, it's just small -- two theatres, both very small, can hold I think, ah, fifty people in one and like seventy in the other.
L:  [LAUGH] Hope they don't get --
R:  Wh- when movies --
L:  -- any popular movies.
R:  Well, it's just that when movies like Titanic came, which stayed for like -- Titanic was here for four months --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- and it showed like more than any other movie and every night for the first two months they were filling up the seats and they had people standing in the back.
L:  So, how many times did --
R:  And at the theatre here -- th- they violated all these fire codes and got in big trouble for it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah, that was a -- all right movie.  So, what's your -- do you have a favorite movie? [NOISE] 
R:  Favorite movie?  [SIGH] Not really, I -- I do like a good horror or scary movie, I mean something that really just gets you kind of freaked out.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  And I'd have to say House On A Haunted Hill is about the only movie that's ever truly done that to me
