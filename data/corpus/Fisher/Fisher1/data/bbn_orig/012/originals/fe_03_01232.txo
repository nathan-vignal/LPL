L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  This is Joanne[?].
R:  This is Nadia[?].
L:  How are you?
R:  Oh, good.  How are you?
L:  Just fine, thank you.
R:  Oh, affirmative action.  Hm.
L:  Well, I'm not totally a hundred percent sure I understand how affirmative action works.  But I do know what the concept is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, do you know much about it?
R:  I think I know, like, the concept.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I -- I think it's probably maybe two -- maybe two different ways to look at it, perhaps?
L:  Perhaps.
R:  I know it may be -- like probably the bad one, I've put that quotes, is like a quota kind of thing.
L:  Mhm --
R:  But --
L:  -- quotas, I think, can be bad.
R:  Yeah, h- -- but I think if a -- if there's a programme in place maybe that just gives opportunities to, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- disadvantaged groups.  And I guess it would just -- to me, it would kind of depend on how the program is, um --
L:  Well, I think we agree.  Um, I -- I have, um -- I have seen it work quite well sometimes and I have seen, ah, people who felt that they were being left out unfairly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it's [MN] -- it is -- it is probably a programme that needs a little more study --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so it would work more smoothly.
R:  Yeah.  Do you think that the -- the [several inaudible words] needs to be, sort of, even in a way, in a sense?
L:  Of planned -- I'm sorry, I didn't understand. [LAUGH]
R:  Like leveling a playing field f- for all people, do you think?
L:  Well, ah, to level -- level the field?
R:  Yeah, because I think that's what the -- the point --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] is.
L:  That was the point.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Um, it's been in -- in effect for quite a long time, hasn't it?
R:  Yeah, I would think so.  And I think -- I -- I think it's kind of hard to say, like is there -- is like a particular, um, corporation necessarily have an affirmative action programme, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because I don't think they really did.  You know?
L:  Some don't I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I guess we're supposed to decide if it would be a good thing, um, in -- in the business community and it could be.
R:  Mm.
L:  It could be.
R:  And how would you think a programme like that could work?
L:  Oh, dear.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I -- I think I would want to get some experts in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, to advise --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and, ah, show the business how it can be done fairly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I'm sure there are such experts in -- in this world. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Maybe even if the University of Pennsylvania. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Ah.
L:  But um -- um, I -- my mind doesn't think along those lines.  I -- I'm in show business. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So -- so, um, in show business they -- they have for years and years and years tried t- -- ah, to have more and more and more affirmative action.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And, um, I know when I first started many, many years ago, um, I was at a television network --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- and the head of the network told all of the executives to start casting minority actors in rol- the roles of heros, of doctors, of lawyers, of this and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and we did try, um, it was a long time before there were a lot of stars, but there are a lot of stars now.
R:  Mhm.  Well, I think the -- I think the -- yeah, I mean, I think it's a good idea --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because -- and I guess I want to say that it's not a good idea to get somebody in there just because of --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, their --
L:  Well, if they can't do the job --
R:  Exactly.
L:  I mean, I think -- I think it's -- it would soon become apparent if they couldn't do the job.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  But um it's -- it's -- um, I think it's done more good than bad.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think -- I guess people who, you know, some opportunities that they wouldn't have, I don't know, had normally.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I wonder if, um -- I don't know if, like -- oh, we're just talking about the business world, trying to get off the subject.  But I was talking about school.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  It's not -- I've heard, like, in the news lately where they're like cutting out those programmes or something and some schools ...
L:  Yes, I think they already have in some, in colleges.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, ah, I don't think they should cut it out.  They should -- they should adapt it to work better if they have a problem.
R:  Yeah, I think so too. [LAUGH]
L:  Well --
R:  What kind of -- um, what kind of entertainment are you -- ah, work are doing now?
L:  Well -- well, I'm semi retired but I'm teaching television production and writing.
R:  Ooh.
L:  Yeah, in a college.
R:  Okay.  Yeah.
L:  And, um, it's a very interesting school, it has an international mission.  We have teachers and students from all over the world.
R:  Really.  What school is that?
L:  Yeah.  It's in -- it's in Missouri.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you wouldn't expect to find it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but it -- there it is.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Anyway, um, I -- I don't know if they have affirmative action or not, but I -- I do know they have many minority students.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'll have to find out more about this, now I'm getting more interested. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Have you done, um, one of these talks before?
L:  No, this is the first one.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Me too.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I'm glad we're both newcomers. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Because I wonder how it's going to work, because we're supposed to like talk for like ten minutes or something.
L:  Yeah, they'll -- they'll -- um, a voice will come on and tell us, okay it's time to stop.
R:  Oh.
L:  I -- I -- that's what I understand anyway.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because -- so, I mean, we -- we're not timing it ourselves.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, ten minutes we -- seems quite long sometimes. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  But um do you -- what do you think -- how could they handle it if they had someone in the affirmative action programme who was doing bad work?
R:  Mm.
L:  They must have the company rules.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, I think it's just kind of -- why -- probably it's such a hot topic or sticky --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is because it's not -- it's just kind of -- um, because it -- it touches on larger issues of our society, you know?
L:  Yes, it does.
R:  Um, and so I think that, you know, while we kind of talk about issues of race and, um, maybe racism and stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know -- you know, in this country we don't really, um, talk about it maybe that it -- that it's real, you know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  That these things still --
L:  Um, it used to be discussed much more openly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, our society of course is constantly changing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and I -- we're far ahead of wh- -- of where we were, um, when I was born.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, that -- that is the positive side.
R:  Yeah.  Indeed.  Yeah, you know actually I think that our -- I have a, um, law degree --
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so I think -- I don't know if the school that I went to had a affirmative action program or not, but um --
L:  You didn't need one.
R:  [LAUGH] Ah, yeah it was hard to, say so I don't know if I was a product of affirmative action, um, [several inaudible words] personally.  You know?
L:  Right.  Well, if -- if you were, I think you would know it, wouldn't you?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean --
R:  I don't know.  You know, actually I think that, um [MN] -- you know, I think that what they do maybe in schools is instead of -- maybe they use different factor --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- instead of perhaps just, you know, a grade or on a test or something.
L:  Right.
R:  So, maybe they look at like um -- you know, like different life experience --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or different activities maybe that you engaged in in school --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, and that sort of thing.  So, I think that, um, [MN] -- so, I think that if, you know -- because people come from different experiences --
L:  True.
R:  -- um, you know, maybe standardized testing wouldn't, um -- would kind of be s- -- um -- I guess what I'm trying to say is I think they had -- I had read something about -- like a study about the SATs --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and how, like, minorities maybe score lower and then they kind of listed the kind of questions that they asked as far as like -- you know, in that part where you have to like, um, somethings to something and
