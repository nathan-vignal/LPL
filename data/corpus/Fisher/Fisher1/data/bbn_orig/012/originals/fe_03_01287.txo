R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, there.  I'm Jennifer.
L:  I'm Rachel.
R:  Rachel?  Hi, Rachel.  Nice to meet you.  Where are you from?
L:  North Carolina.  Where are you from?
R:  From Dallas, Texas.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, we're supposed to talk about how we get our current events?
R:  I guess we are.  I'm basically television.
L:  Mine's television and I get some of it off the computer and --
R:  Right.
L:  I read a lot. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm pretty much -- my -- I think it's just the afternoon news.  We, uh -- m- my husband and I watch that most of the time.  Sometimes I'll see a bit on the computer, but that's usually not what I'm looking for when I'm on the computer, but ... [LAUGH] Have you ever done one of these studies before?
L:  No, I haven't.
R:  No, me neither.
L:  I, uh -- I get most -- most of my news in the morning and, you know, I'll log on to the computer and I read a little more about the current events.
R:  Mm, okay.
L:  Are we supposed to discuss the actual current events or ...?
R:  I -- I assume we pretty much can [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, I imagine the main current event of the week is probably the war.
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  [LAUGH] Uh, has -- has that been pretty much plastered on your television?
L:  Uh, pretty much so.  I -- I was -- I was at work today so I didn't see much of it, but, uh, what's going on with that anyway?
R:  Oh, actually, tonight I've kinda taken a break from it.  Most of the nights I've been watching a lot of it.  It's on right now in my house, but I'm not sure what is even going on tonight.  I know we're sixty miles from Baghdad.
L:  Oh, gee.
R:  Fifty or sixty.
L:  Sixty miles, are we that close?
R:  Fifty or sixty, yeah.  We're -- we'll be in there at any time.
L:  My goodness.
R:  Yeah, so they're ready to go in and get him and Sad- Saddam supposedly has come out with some tape today that, um, there was, like, sixty two edits that they could find to -- somehow they -- they could tell that he had edited it sixty two times, and it's like a twenty minute tape.
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, [MN] saying that they've got our soldiers and all that kind of stuff.
L:  I wonder if it was really him?
R:  They said that it was, but the thing about it is is they're thinking that, um, it's prerecorded, that he did this at another time.
L:  Before.  So, he's --
R:  Before the bombs started, yeah.
L:  I think they think he might have been hurt, too.  I mean --
R:  Yeah, they think that -- they think that, but they don't know at this point in time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He -- he probably is, but from what I was, um -- I heard, um, another guy that used to be an adviser for him and now I guess he doesn't like him and he's here in the US --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he, um, was the adviser for him in the last war, and he said that he moves ar- -- what he did --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- last time was that he moved around, um, stayed only an hour house to house.  So, he constantly stayed on the move, he didn't stay anywhere longer than an hour. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, going from --
L:  Well, there was some person on TV -- I didn't watch it but my husband did -- that he has nineteen people who've had plastic surgery made to look him.
R:  To look like him, really?  Yeah, I knew he had some bodyg- -- some doubles that look like him.  That one the other day, I don't know if it was really him or not, but it sure didn't look like him. [LAUGH] The one that they brought out in glasses.
L:  No, I don't think they think -- I don't think it was him.
R:  I know.  I don't think it was, but I don't think they did a very good job of disguising it either. [LAUGH]
L:  No. [LAUGH] Well, they said that -- also on that program they said that, um, [LIPSMACK] before he -- he has -- when he's in his palace, he has people that cook for him --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the head son of the cook has to taste the food before he'll eat it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There are so many precautions.
R:  Right, 'cause everybody hates him.
L:  I know.
R:  I c- -- I couldn't imagine who wouldn't, to be honest with you.
L:  Even his own people. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, he kills them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, his son, uh, um, the Uday, that -- that's the one that they think is dead.  They really think that he -- he's dead.
L:  Oh, the son.  How many sons does --
R:  The oldest.  He's got two of 'em.
L:  Two of 'em.
R:  He's got -- yeah, the -- he's got the, um, kind of, um, chunky looking one and a skinny one --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And that Uday and [inaudible].
L:  He's the one that always stands up behind him, isn't he?
R:  The Uday's the -- yeah, he's like, got that shaved looking head and stuff.  He's --
L:  Yeah, he looks just like his dad. [LAUGH]
R:  He -- he is the worst one of all.  He's -- I mean, b- -- all of 'em are bad.  I mean, come on, but, um, he was in charge of their Olympic team and, um, their soccer team.  If they did not perform well, once they were done they had to go -- he would take 'em and go beat 'em.
L:  Oh, good grief.
R:  I mean, I -- I don't think I would even wanna sign up for soccer. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't either.
R:  I would pass on that one.
L:  They probably didn't have a choice.
R:  I -- I imagine they didn't.  And then they, you know, you can't always have a perfect game, but I bet you better whenever Uday's in charge. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  But, yeah, he's a tyrant.  I -- so, you're -- you're for the war, things going on over there?
L:  The what?
R:  You're basically for the war, taking out Saddam?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Are you?
R:  Yeah, definitely.  I wanna get it done with.  I've been --
L:  Yeah, they -- 
R:  I've been saying for weeks --
L:  They should've done it twenty years ago.
R:  Yeah.  I've been saying, you know, for weeks and months since they started this, I wish they'd hurry up and go and do it.  Because I think it was more stressful waiting and just waiting for Saddam to come over here and -- and, you know, have somebody do something to us.
L:  That's right.
R:  Just sitting there waiting and waiting and giving him more time.  But the weapons that they're using, my husband was telling me that they are so old.  He said they were back like World War Two weapons, the weapons and the helicopters and all that.  Their equipment they have is not up to date at all. [inaudible]
L:  So, have you heard any more about the prisoners of war?  Are they torturing 'em or do they really know?
R:  I -- so far, um, I don't know.  I can't keep count of that right now because they're saying, y- you know, Iraqi television is hollering that they have this many and we're saying that's not true and then we -- y- -- I know that they have some of ours, but, um, yeah, they're supposedly, um, coming back on t- -- on television and saying that we are the ones that are violating the Geneva Convention.  Somehow, I don't know how they're getting it that we are violating it, but they said that they're not, that we're the ones that's violating it.  When we take care of their prisoners and feed 'em and everything, and they kill ours.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And there's good old France.  They say they -- I think they say they supply them with about forty percent of their weapons.  And then --
R:  Russia right now is -- yeah, Russia's big into, um -- it's gonna be in big trouble, too, because they are supplying a lot of communication things that are blocking, like, our satellite, um, GPS signals and things like that.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Russia is?
R:  Russia.  So, Russia --
L:  That's not good. [LAUGH]
R:  Russia, France, they're all -- yeah, they've all been selling to him.
L:  Well, what's the matter with them people? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Who knows?  They thought they wouldn't -- couldn't happen to them, I guess.
L:  I guess so.
R:  I don't know.  But, um, I think that that's the reason that, um, France is blocking it so hard, saying that they're gonna veto no matter what.  There has -- there has -- I knew -- I was saying then when they said that, you know, somebody that says, "No matter what the outcome, we're -- we're gonna do this and we're vetoing", and that's what they were saying before we were going, that no matter what they were gonna veto the decision, the vote, and the only -- the only thing that you can come to the conclusion about is that they have something to hide.
L:  That's right, yeah.
R:  If we go over there, then we're gonna find something out about them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the government supposedly said that they kinda knew what was going on, um, with Russia for the last year, and now they're coming -- and they've been trying to kinda talk to 'em about it, but now they're coming out public and letting everybody know about it.
L:  So, what else do you think's going on in current events?
R:  [SIGH] Elizabeth Smart.  That was, uh --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know, I don't hear anything else besides the news any more with the war, so I -- to be honest --
L:  Do you think she was --
R:  -- I was trying to think while [inaudible] saying that topic, I was like, "What else besides the war?" [LAUGH]
L:  Do you think she was brainwashed?
R:  Uh, I -- probably after a point, after beating her -- I -- I don't know, beating, but there had to have been some kind of -- I don't think she went willingly.
L:  No, I don't either, but --
R:  In the beginning and -- you know, I think that probably she resisted in the beginning, but, yeah, maybe, I don't know --
L:  Like --
R:  -- it's, uh, some kind of stress, so much stress or something, clouds her.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's kinda like the Hearst woman.  Eventually she was won over.
R:  Exactly, yeah.  They kinda just, I don't know, get -- all that duress probably just puts such a strain on 'em that they maybe block out the reality and just go with whatever's there.
L:  Yeah.  Yes.
R:  I don't know.  Uh, you don't -- I haven't heard much on really -- what's really happened with that.  I imagine they're trying to protect the little girl as much as they can.
L:  I imagine so.  I -- I wonder [NOISE] was she raped or ...?
R:  Well, I think that -- well, obviously she had to be because did you hear he was calling her -- saying that she was his wife?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, I heard that.
R:  That she was -- he was saying that he loves Elizabeth and she's still his wife.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Now, you know, if he's calling her wife, then he has done something to her.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But the parents are obviously wanting to keep it quiet and protect her because the last I heard they were coming out and saying that, um, they did not want to press charges, um, for sexual assault against him.
L:  Why not?
R:  So --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, probably maybe because, uh, the outcome of them doing that might have been harsher on her, 'cause she would have had to recount the events, maybe, in court.  Who knows?  Maybe they've got so much more on him that they won't even have to press charges for that when -- if --
L:  Well, kidnapping would be enough right there to put him away for life, I would think.
R:  [LAUGH] Uh, you would think so, but I'll tell you, sometimes I don't know these days.  Um, do you have children?
L:  No, I don't.  Uh-uh.
R:  You don't?
L:  No.
R:  I have a four and a five year old, so --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  I stay on constant alert.  It's -- it's tough.
L:  Are they -- are they aware of what's going on?  I mean --
R:  Oh, yeah, they are.  Um, my four year old's not.  She's -- she's kinda just blah blah blah, whatever.  She's in her own little world as long as you give her candy and food and a place to sleep and toys. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  She could care less about anything else.  But my five year old, he's starting to, um, be aware and you don't notice how much that they, um, see what's going on, but -- 'cause they don't -- they don't s- say anything to you when they first see it --
L:  You have to be careful --
R:  But it'll be lat- --
L:  -- not to let 'em worry --
