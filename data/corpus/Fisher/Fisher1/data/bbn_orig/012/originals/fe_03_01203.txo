L:  Hi, hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Uh, my name's Jeff Shaw[?]
R:  I'm Andrew Lamdenebro[?]
L:  Okay.  What do you think?
R:  Well, um ... I have to say, it doesn't sound like all that much of an attractive author or offer.
L:  You mean, you would take uh you won't the million dollar offer?
R:  I wouldn't, no.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I would.
R:  You would? [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  Well, I guess it depends on who your best friend is.
L:  Yeah but um even if you cannot speak to each other, you can still communicate.
R:  Well, that is open to question.  I mean, it's possible that you know, you could just never talk to them and you -- if you were to send them a letter or if you were to tell a friend and they were to tell them, then it might work out but on the other hand, it might be against the agreement.
L:  Right.
R:  You're right.  If -- if -- if it was um strictly about being --
L:  Not -- not communicating.
R:  Not -- yeah, if it was strictly [MN] about not communicating, then I would -- I couldn't possibly take it.  If it was, you just couldn't talk to them, that would be --
L:  Well, making new friends is easy, I think.
R:  Well, yeah, it is.
L:  But keeping the old ones is not ...
R:  Not certain?
L:  I uh ... I don't know.  I -- I -- I -- I would do it.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, um ... I mean, it -- it certainly seems like a ... a potentially reasonable choice --
L:  [MN]
R:  ... and if you didn't have, for example, any good friends, you -- you know, there is one person -- you -- you knew one person then it would be a very o- obvious choice to make, um ...
L:  Well, how about this?  If -- if the offer is uh like uh ten million dollars ... then what's your action to that?
R:  Well ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Having a million dollars certainly would be nice.
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Um there is, I guess, there -- there is, from your question, [MN] do you think that you could earn enough money um in ordinary ... in ordinary methods ...
L:  Right.
R:  ... to um ... to, you know, be satisfied or would that million dollars really make a difference.  I mean, certainly, if you were ... had, you know, no job and no chance of getting a job, it would be a lot different than if you were a very rich lawyer or something.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.
R:  Um ... I guess certainly there have to be some people for who a million dollars is, if not meaningless, at least very insignificant.
L:  Well, think of -- well, think it -- think it -- of it uh this way.  If you win a lottery ticket today, you might get twenty million dollars today ...
R:  Mm.
L:  ... and uh what would you do next?  [inaudible] you'll probably resign from your -- your job and uh get somewhere else to get uh ... get -- get on your life and uh never retur- -- be turned back.
R:  Mhm.  Oh, well, that's certainly what you would want to do, I suppose, if you didn't like your job.  Um ... I -- there was a -- are you familiar with the comic strip Dilbert?
L:  Uh, which one?
R:  Dilbert?
L:  Oh, yeah, I -- I know that.
R:  They had -- they had one, I remember, I'm sorry, I don't know when, maybe it was in one of their books, um where he won the l- -- where Dilbert won the lottery and he went back to work anyway ...
L:  Mm.
R:  ... and he [MN] and [MN] and Dogbert asked him, "Why are you doing that" and he said, "Because work is the second b- best place to gloat after home".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And it -- actually, it would be kinda nice to have a million dollars and still go into your work and say, "Well, I'm gonna be here but I don't actually intend to do anything.  I'm just gonna sit here and laugh at you all"!
L:  Right, right, yeah.  Right, right.  You don't -- you -- you don't fear to be uh ... to be fired or anything.
R:  [LAUGH] Does it mean anything to be fired, all of a sudden?
L:  Right.
R:  [MN] On the other hand, uh, if you -- if you consider this like winning the lottery, I've been told and I can't actually confirm this, but you know, I haven't done the research myself or seen it, you know, in -- in print, but I've been told that most lottery winners actually go bankrupt because they spend it all and ...
L:  Right because it's easy money and uh they don't ... they don't see it as uh as the money they earned.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  But uh ... well [LAUGH] if I got the chance to win the lottery or get uh free one million dollars I would really think hard to uh not accepting it.
R:  Mhm.  Well, it certainly is hard to look at a million dollars um to just look at it and say, "I don't want it".  [MN] That's -- that's very difficult.
L:  Right.
R:  Um ... on the other hand, you -- how much is it worth to yourself to be able to say that you did that?  I mean, if you were --
L:  Well, how much is your friendship worth?
R:  Well, that's -- that's a rather difficult thing to figure out, isn't it?
L:  Right.
R:  Um ...
L:  It's a uh ... it's a great opportunity.
R:  Mhm.  Well, it -- it certainly -- I mean, it -- it certainly could be the -- the case that your friendship is worth only nine hundred thousand dollars.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And so you are better off taking the deal.
L:  Right.
R:  Um ... but p- -- supposing your friends -- your -- your other friends or your new friends, found out that you had totally cut adrift your very best friend in exchange for money?  I mean, would they start wondering, "Am I worth a nickel?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "Ten dollars, what -- what is my value?"
L:  Well, what if ... what if they never know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Hide the truth from them.
R:  It -- it -- it might make it harder to find -- to -- to get a new friend, if you trade your old one.
L:  Right.  That's true.
R:  But ... um ... I mean, I guess -- what -- go -- go ahead, I ...
L:  Do you have a very best ... well ... no, no, you go ahead.
R:  Okay.  I didn't think I w- -- what I was -- I'm gonna say is -- is useful but ... [MN] I guess you could -- you could look at what you would do with a million dollars ...
L:  Mhm ... what do you want to do if you win a million dollars?
R:  What?
L:  What -- what you want to do if you win a million dollars?
R:  Yeah.  I mean, if -- if I happen to have a million dollars ...
L:  Right.
R:  ... um ... I'm honestly not sure what I'd do.  I mean, it's just been --
L:  [MN] Buy a big house?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, that would -- that would be certainly a nice option um ... it would sure make college a lot cheaper.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, you could -- I could -- I'd probably end up, you know, giving some back to my parents and giving some to my sister so that she can go to college and ...
L:  Right.
R:  ... things like that but I mean ... [MN] when I -- when I look at it, so many of the things that I buy are ... um, they j- -- they waste away.  I mean, you buy a -- a computer and it -- five years later, it's worth nothing and two years after you buy it, it's worth a do- -- a hundred dollars as compared to whatever you paid to begin with.
L:  Right.
R:  It -- it's not like the -- what -- what I'd like to buy is not exactly things that are um good -- good expenses.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I should -- I should -- I should try to avoid them.  How 'bout you?  What would you be spending it on?
L:  Well, I -- I would like to use the money uh for starting up a new company or something.
R:  A new company?
L:  Doing -- doing some business.
R:  What -- what would um ... what kind of company could this be?
L:  Well, uh ... probably like a trading company or small manufacture uh specialty.
R:  Some- something like --
L:  Like manufacturing company.
R:  Like, something like a day[?] trading or ...?
L:  No.  Not exactly but uh more like uh uh trading goods company.
R:  Oh.  So ...
L:  Bring goods from uh one -- one place to another.
R:  Um --
L:  From one country to another.
R:  In, like, im- import export or ...?
L:  Yeah, more like that.
R:  Okay, yeah, okay.  That's ... well, that certainly makes sense.
L:  Or ... right and uh then make more money [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.  Well, yeah.  More money [LAUGH] is always a [LAUGH] a good thing!
L:  [LAUGH] Right and --
R:  Uh ...
L:  -- uh if I [MN] get really rich and uh I can probably make the same offer to somebody else.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Right?  Give them some -- one million dollars and uh make them happy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, it -- it's um certainly the case that if you have a million dollars it's a lot easier to get your second million.
L:  Right.
R:  But um ... I guess ...  how m- -- how m- -- how much money um ... w- what -- is there a different no- -- is there a different amount of money other than a million dollars that you could make this decision at?
L:  Uh ... well [LAUGH] this is uh ... well, I don't know.  It's hard.  But uh ... if -- if it's more than uh what you can earn in a very -- in a -- a reasonable time, then I would go -- I -- I would go for it.
R:  Mhm.  I mean, um ... I -- I guess, it seems to me that if they offered you say five hundred million dollars, that's pro- probably more than --
L:  Well [LAUGH] I --
R:  -- than you -- I mean, the thing is, that that's more than you could spend -- well, not entirely but it -- it -- it's pretty close ...
L:  Right.
R:  ... and so, you know, for -- at that point, you know, the idea of, you know, starting the company, well, why bother?  You have ... you know, you have enough money to do whatever -- whatever you want as it is.  Um ... but on the other hand, if they were to offer you say five thousand dollars ...
L:  Right.
R:  ... then it's, you know, you could probably ... you could certainly, even at -- even working at McDonalds in -- over a summer, you could probably make that much.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, so it's ... the -- there ... I -- I wonder if one million dollars is kind of a magic number ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  ... or if it -- if it's really something that could be all over the place.
L:  Well, one ... one million dollars doesn't get you a -- a -- a good life after your -- after your retirement.
R:  Well --
L:  It's just getting -- getting you started.
R:  Mhm.  A million dollars would certainly -- certainly help with your retirement, be it tomorrow or thirty years ...
