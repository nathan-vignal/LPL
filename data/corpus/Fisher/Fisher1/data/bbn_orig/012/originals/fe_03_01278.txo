R:  My name's Beth.
L:  I'm Amy.  How are you?
R:  Good.  How 'bout you?
L:  Fine, thanks.  [SIGH]
R:  I'm first time [NOISE] person doing this, so I have n- --
L:  I am, too, [LAUGH] so --
R:  -- no idea what's going on.
L:  Oh, that's okay.  I think we're just supposed to, um -- I -- I was just reading the, um, email that they sent --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- and I think we're just supposed to kinda talk about -- I -- see, I thought it was gonna be somebody from the study.  I didn't realize --
R:  Well --
L:  -- it was just another random person.
R:  Th- that's what I thought, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I tried -- they called me earlier in the week and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I -- I didn't get anybody to talk to, so I'm like, "Well, I guess I'm gonna hang up now", so --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I guess --
R:  I figured it was gonna be some prerecorded person saying, "Okay, now, press one for this answer" --
L:  Right, right. [LAUGH]
R:  Or, "Press two".
L:  That's kinda what I thought, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it says just to try to talk about the topic.
R:  The topic, huh?
L:  Yeah, and they said they wanted to know how we got our [NOISE] current information.
R:  Huh.
L:  I guess the television [LAUGH] mostly.
R:  Yeah, I'd say pretty much television, but I don't remember that being really a choice.
L:  It's -- I mean, it's, uh, it's on all the time, so --
R:  Yeah -- well, yeah.
L:  Um, so, you know, the --
R:  Oh, you can't turn if off ever.
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, 'specially this whole war thing going on.
L:  I know, you know, you --
R:  It's kinda hard not to.
L:  You might actually miss something, [LAUGH] so --
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  You never know.
R:  No kidding.
L:  They'll go for a while without [NOISE] really having anything, and then all of a sudden they'll, um, they'll have a bunch of stuff to report and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Then you hear the same information different ways.
R:  Right, yeah, you sure do.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] So, I've heard several different stories on several of the things for the, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they talked about, um, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they'll tell you one thing and then a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- little bit later they'll tell ya, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they'll report it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- another way when they find out actually what happened.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Seems like they're kinda -- they -- everybody wants to be the first one to do it, [LAUGH] to report everything.
R:  Well, that's true, yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Definitely true.  So, does it say how long you're supposed to talk till?
L:  It says ten minutes.
R:  Ten minutes?
L:  Ten minutes.
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Huh.
L:  Uh, they should've gave us a little more of a topic. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, no kidding, huh.
L:  Because that's, um --
R:  So, where are you from?
L:  I'm from East Tennessee.
R:  East Tennessee?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Holy cow.  We're in Minnesota.
L:  Uh, Minnesota, oh, wow, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's real warm here.  They say where it's gonna get cold again, though.
R:  Yeah.  It was -- went pretty warm today, but it's really windy.
L:  Okay.  I knew it -- it snowed a lot but that was in Col- Colorado, I guess.
R:  I heard that.
L:  So, yeah, they were showing it on TV.  It looked like --
R:  Yeah, they had lots of snow.
L:  They had a big -- they had a big dog and it was running through it [NOISE] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and it was having a hard time [LAUGH] keeping up and everything.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But we've had really nice weather.
R:  Yeah.  We had -- last week it was, um, oh, I think it got up to sixty degrees yesterday [NOISE] and I think fifty degrees on Friday.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, it was pretty nice.
L:  Yeah, it's seventy two here right now.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, I don't think it's that warm here.
L:  Y- -- uh, but --
R:  I think it's fifty something, I think. [NOISE]
L:  We're hav- -- we're g- -- well, we're probably gonna get that, um, cold wave that you -- or not cold wave but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- cooler wave that y'all are getting right now.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  They said by Wednesday it's gonna cool down on us.
R:  Yeah, it's supposed to w- rain here on Wednesday.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And so we'll probably get that about Friday or Saturday. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But we usually have pretty nice weather.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The grass already needs to be mowed.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, we just got -- starting to see our grass.
L:  No, it already needs to be mowed.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, uh, I live in Latro[?], it's -- I don't know, um, it's outside of Knoxville.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  And most people know Knoxville, but it's -- it's just basically East Tennessee. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, but, uh, it's a nice area.  I enjoy it.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  I have --
R:  Yeah, I was in, um, [LIPSMACK] South Carolina, Myrtle Beach --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- last week.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, I was there from Tuesday to Thursday.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I bet that was nice.
R:  It was nice, but you know, once we got there it's like [MN] --
L:  What?
R:  I got two l- -- two little kids, and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- being away from them it's like, "Now what do you do?" you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You're so used to taking care of them all week --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- you know, and it's like -- so --
L:  How old are your kids?
R:  Uh, three and two.
L:  I have a four year old and a twenty one month old.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I don't miss those ages yet. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Little one, yeah.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  My second one just turned two on the sixteenth.
L:  She's gonna turn two in June, so --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm -- I'm kind of glad to be out of the real baby stage, you know.
R:  Yeah, yes.
L:  We're starting to, you know, finally get to do stuff and all.
R:  Right, that's right, yeah.
L:  Because we went to the store earlier and they were scratching each other and --
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  -- [LAUGH] pulling hair and everything else.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, we're in a whole new phase.
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, ten minutes.  I suppose they're gonna tell us how long to talk, I suppose.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Huh.
L:  I don't know.  I think they're doing something about, uh, you know how these voice activated computer systems and stuff?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're gonna use the recorded calls --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and use 'em to do something with that.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  I know, so the -- I guess that's why they want people from all over the country so that --
R:  Right, I suppose.
L:  -- you know, they can kinda get all accents and everything.
R:  Huh.
L:  'Cause I know we have two very different accents.
R:  Yes, uh-huh.
L:  So, that'll be -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess that'll be good for 'em.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Maybe -- maybe that's why you didn't get anybody, uh, before --
R:  Yeah, I didn't -- I waited for about five minutes and they -- they never -- nobody had come on, so I'm like, well --
L:  Oh.  They, uh, they've called me several times, but see, I just signed up for it last night.
R:  Well, see, [LIPSMACK] they got -- they called me the same day I signed up, too.
L:  Yeah, I didn't realize they were gonna -- I mean, I had stuff to do today 'cause I'd [inaudible] always here, but I went out today.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I got home and there was six messages on my --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It looks like they called about every thirty minutes.
R:  Yeah, they usually do.
L:  I thought at four thirty they're gonna call, so I'm gonna sit here until they call.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And sure enough ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know how long we've been talking now.  I didn't really look at the time.
R:  Oh, about six minutes.
L:  It says -- I think it just ca- cuts you off --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when it's finished. [LAUGH] I don't --
R:  I don't even know.
L:  I wonder if you'll get, uh, counted for that call that nobody ever --
R:  [NOISE] I have no idea.
L:  All right.
R:  It sure would be nice.
L:  Yeah.  They should.  I mean, since you were there and they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they never find -- you know, it should at least tell you, "Well, we didn't find anybody else.  We'll call you later".
R:  Yeah.
L:  Instead of just leaving you sitting there.
R:  Yeah, 'cause they s- seem to call me a lot 'cause usually I'll try to be home.
L:  Right.
R:  Well, I'm home pretty much all the time, too, but sometimes I can't be on the phone that long.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  You know, it's like --
L:  You can't always do that.
R:  -- well, you know, my kids are eating --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- maybe 'cause I eat with them, or I'm --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- doing laundry or something so --
L:  You can't just always drop the -- what you're doing and talk.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How l- -- now, you said this is -- they've called you before or --
R:  They've called me before, but --
L:  But nobody was -- was there, okay.
R:  -- I never actually got to talk to anybody.  And then --
L:  And was that -- was that, like, two days ago?
R:  -- I actually tried to talk to somebody and I could -- they never got anybody on.
L:  Oh.  Was that, like, two days ago?
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Or -- it -- it sounded like in my email --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they'll call you about every forty eight hours, so ...
R:  'Cause that first time they called me, um, she's like, "Well, here's your PIN number and you might be getting a call tonight or today" and I'm like, "Oh, well ..."
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah, they left that message on my machine around noon.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That, you know, when -- but she didn't say that I might be getting a call today or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I still had stuff to do.  I couldn't hang around here, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's interesting at least.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where did you hear about it at?
R:  Um, I belong to a money home and shopping network.--
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- kind of thing that does, like, those secret shopper things.
L:  Uh-huh, that's where I heard it, yeah.
R:  And that's where I got it from.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Do you do a lot of the secret shopper?
R:  You know, I've only done two.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I -- I just started in January and I only did one in January.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I did six in February, but I've done, like --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- twenty this month.
R:  Holy cow.
L:  I've done a bunch, so you just gotta sign up with a lot of companies.  But I found that board to be the best.
R:  Really?
L:  Did you get the IBM thing?
R:  Okay.
L:  The, uh -- where you -- uh, they want people to drop off mail at certain points?
R:  Oh.
L:  It, um, it's on that, uh, volition[?].
R:  Huh.
L:  Vol- volition.  It's, uh, postal droppers for IBM.
R:  Huh.  I never heard of that one.
L:  So, uh, I called her today and she said that she had gotten so many calls from that.
R:  Oh, did she?
L:  So, watch for it.  It'll say, um, postal dropper.
R:  Okay.
L:  Or it'll say IBM in the subject line.
R:  Okay.
L:  When it says that, click on it and it'll give you a phone number to call.
R:  Okay.
L:  But, uh, but she was real --
R:  But see, the bad thing is is my area's really limited.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're mo- mostly in the cities.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I can't go.  I mean, I can if I'm there already, but --
L:  Yeah, yeah, if you're already --
R:  There's not much in Saint Cald[?] that I can do, so ...
L:  Yeah.  There -- my area, um, where I live is very rural, but I -- I drive to Knoxville at least twice a week.
R:  Do ya?
L:  So, I try to do those.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I did some in Severeville[?] where the -- all the entertainment stuff is.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I did a lot of those in February.
R:  Did ya?
L:  But I'm not gonna go up there w- when the, uh, tourist season starts.
R:  Oh, I'm sure not.
L:  So, I didn't sign up for any in April.  I did some early this month but --
R:  Did ya?
L:  It kinda starts next month, so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, so I don't know how I'll do after that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's been interesting.
R:  Yeah, good.
L:  Sounds like it takes a while to really get into it, you know, people calling you for work and all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] But it's worth it.  You can take the kids with you.
R:  Yeah.  See, and some of them don't want kids either --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so [inaudible] that one.
L:  Yeah, if they don't -- if they don't -- if they don't let you take kids I don't take 'em.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've always got my kids with me, so ... [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sometimes it's a little challenging, but ... [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I agree to that.  Well, I suppose we should talk more about the debt thing -- uh, the --
L:  Yeah, I [LAUGH] -- I don't know, I mean --
R:  -- subject instead of talking about our personal lives, I suppose.  They're not going to probably call us back. [LAUGH]
L:  I'd say -- I'd -- well, I'd say a lot of 'em get like that 'cause I read on that that, uh, that they didn't really know what to talk about on the subject.
R:  Well --
L:  I mean, they said to talk about how you get your information.
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  I get it off a TV, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, they should have --
L:  Sometimes the computer.
R:  -- it more multiple choice stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, okay, do you --
L:  And so, you know, talk about this for two minutes, talk about that for two minutes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Something like that.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  So, I really -- I mean, that -- that was kind of a short topic, though.
R:  Well, yeah. [NOISE]
L:  I mean, I --
R:  I don't even remember what the topic before was, like, I was trying to do. [NOISE]
L:  I've heard they've done 'em on reality television.
R:  Oh, yeah? [NOISE]
L:  And they did it on, um, I think they've done the current events one several times, because I heard a couple of people talk about that, that they didn't know what to talk about, so ...
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  I mean, they could start arguments like that, too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You might get somebody that has really strong feelings one way or the other.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, they might wanna rethink that one. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, no kidding. [NOISE] No kidding.
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE]
R:  Huh.
L:  Seems like it should be close to the time.
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  Not that I don't enjoy talking to you. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no.  No, no.
L:  Because I don't know what to talk about. [LAUGH]
R:  Hey, it's a free call, can't be beat really. [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Get paid to talk to you, that's pretty nice.
L:  Yeah, you know, it's pretty easy work. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, no kidding.
