MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH GOING TO SEE MOVIES THOUGH IS THE PRICE IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY AND IF I WERE TO DO IT EVERY WEEK IT WOULD BE KIND OF EXPENSIVE I THINK  (fe_03_00880-A-0049)
[MN] SO THAT'S WHY I ENJOY GOING TO THE DOLLAR THEATER AND JUST WAITING A FEW MONTHS UNTIL IT  (fe_03_00880-A-0050)
COMES TO THE THEATER FOR A DOLLAR  (fe_03_00880-A-0051)
