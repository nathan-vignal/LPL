WE YOU KNOW LIVE OUR LIFE WORKING THE NINE TO FIVE GRIND OF OPENING A RESTAURANT TOGETHER  (fe_03_00800-A-0018)
JUST THE TWO OF US WHEN WE'RE OLDER AND THAT WOULD BE FUN BECAUSE WE BOTH LIKE TO COOK  (fe_03_00800-A-0019)
AND YOU KNOW EVERY TIME WE TALK ABOUT IT WE HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS OF WHAT KIND OF FOOD WE'D SERVE OR  (fe_03_00800-A-0020)
IT WOULD BE YOU KNOW ONE SPECIFIC KIND OF FOOD OR A VEGETARIAN RESTAURANT OR NO IT WOULD BE ANY KIND OF FOOD FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD BECAUSE WE ALSO LIKE TO TRAVEL  (fe_03_00800-A-0021)
UM THAT SORT OF THING  (fe_03_00800-A-0022)

UM TO OPEN A RESTAURANT'S REALLY RISKY  (fe_03_00800-A-0024)

A WHILE WHILE YOU BUILT IT UP WHICH I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S SO DAUNTING ABOUT STARTING YOUR OWN BUSINESSES  (fe_03_00800-A-0046)
YOU KNOW YOU SPEND YOUR LIFE ON IT FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN IF IT FAILS  (fe_03_00800-A-0047)
IT'S A BIG BLOW I THINK I THINK THAT'S WHY MORE PEOPLE DON'T DO IT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN  (fe_03_00800-A-0048)

IF ONE OF US IS DOING SOMETHING THE OTHER DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE IN AND WAS TAKING SO MUCH TIME AND ENERGY  (fe_03_00800-A-0064)
SO IT WOULDN'T HARDLY BE WORTH IT YEAH IT JUST TAKES SO MUCH  (fe_03_00800-A-0065)
