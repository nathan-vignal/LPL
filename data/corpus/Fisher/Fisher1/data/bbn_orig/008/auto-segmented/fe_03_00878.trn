REBECCA  (fe_03_00878-A-0001)

I DON'T HAVE A JOB OR ANYTHING AND I AM A STUDENT  (fe_03_00878-A-0004)
SO I DEFINITELY DO PREFER WATCHING MOVIES AT MY HOUSE  (fe_03_00878-A-0005)
AND UM  (fe_03_00878-A-0007)
ACTUALLY I FIND IT CHEAPER JUST TO BUY MOVIES  (fe_03_00878-A-0008)
UM ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE ARE LOTS OF DIS- DISCOUNT SITES ON THE WEB AND STUFF AND YOU CAN PROBABLY BUY A MOVIE FOR THE SAME PRICE THAT YOU CAN GO TO THE MOVIES FOR  (fe_03_00878-A-0009)
SO THAT'S WHAT I PREFER TO DO [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00878-A-0010)
