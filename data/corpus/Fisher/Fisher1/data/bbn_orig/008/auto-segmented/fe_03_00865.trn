BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS  (fe_03_00865-A-0008)
OKAY  (fe_03_00865-A-0009)
SO BY CHARTER SCHOOLS DO YOU MEAN UM  (fe_03_00865-A-0010)
SCHOOLS THAT  (fe_03_00865-A-0011)
THE PARENTS GET MONEY FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND ARE ABLE TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN SCHOOLS OR  (fe_03_00865-A-0012)
OKAY  (fe_03_00865-A-0014)
BIGGER PRIVATE SCHOOL THEN  (fe_03_00865-A-0015)

SO AH WHAT STAGE ARE YOU IN WHAT  (fe_03_00865-A-0019)
WAS THERE SOMETHING THAT WAS OFFERED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL OR BY STATE  (fe_03_00865-A-0020)
[LAUGHTER] OKAY  (fe_03_00865-A-0021)
BECAUSE I I'M IN CALIFORNIA AND I'VE I'VE ONLY HEARD ABOUT UM I WE THOUGHT IT WAS AT THE STATE LEVE- LEVEL BUT I'M NOT SURE EITHER 'CAUSE IT'S BEEN A COUPLE OF YEARS WHERE UM  (fe_03_00865-A-0022)
THE GOVERNMENT WAS  (fe_03_00865-A-0023)
THINKING ABOUT THE OPTION OF  (fe_03_00865-A-0024)
GIVING MONEY TO THE PARENTS TO PAY FOR PRIVATE SCHOOLS IF THAT WAS THEIR CHOICE  (fe_03_00865-A-0025)
BUT MAYBE THIS IS A DIFFERENT ISSUE SO IF YOU WANTED YOUR CHILD NOT TO GO TO UM THE PUBLIC SCHOOL BUT A PRIVATE SCHOOL THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WOULD GO IN TO THAT PARTICULAR CHILD AT THE PUBLIC SCHOOL WOULD BE HANDED OVER TO THE PARENTS  (fe_03_00865-A-0026)
AND THEY COULD USE THAT TOWARDS A PRIVATE SCHOOL  (fe_03_00865-A-0027)
OF THEIR WISHES  (fe_03_00865-A-0028)
OKAY OKAY  (fe_03_00865-A-0029)
I'M NOT SURE WHAT I THINK ABOUT THAT  (fe_03_00865-A-0030)
RIGHT YEAH I DON'T KNOW EITHER I THINK UM  (fe_03_00865-A-0031)
I GUESS KIND OF RELATED TO THE SAME  (fe_03_00865-A-0032)
TYPE OF ISSUE UM IS THAT YOU SEE  (fe_03_00865-A-0033)
A BIG DIFFERENCE AMONG DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES SO  (fe_03_00865-A-0034)
I'VE WORKED IN SOME WEALTHY AREAS IN SAN DIEGO WHERE  (fe_03_00865-A-0035)
YOU KNOW THESE ALL THE PARENTS ARE DOCTORS AND LAWYERS AND THE SCHOOLS THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES ARE  (fe_03_00865-A-0036)
VERY NICE  (fe_03_00865-A-0037)
THERE'S AH SEVERAL COMPUTERS IN EACH CLASSROOM AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT AND THEN I'VE ALSO WORKED IN UM  (fe_03_00865-A-0038)
MORE OF AN INNER  (fe_03_00865-A-0039)
CITY TYPE OF SCHOOL WITH WITH MINORITIES IN IN  (fe_03_00865-A-0040)
CITY AND THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE  (fe_03_00865-A-0041)
COLORED PAPER ALL THE TIME OR AH  (fe_03_00865-A-0042)
YOU KNOW THEY NEED TO BUY NEW PENS AND MARKERS WHERE THESE LIKE UPPER CLASS UM PUBLIC SCHOOLS THEY WERE TO- TOSSING AWAY THEIR OLD AH  (fe_03_00865-A-0043)
OLD AH PENS AND BUYING NEW PENS EVERY SEMESTER AND ONE THING I ENDED UP DOING WAS COLLECTING IT AND TAKING IT DOWN TO MEXICO TO AT LEAST GIVE TO SOMEBODY  (fe_03_00865-A-0044)
BUT YEAH I'VE I'VE DEFINITELY SEEN THAT THEY'VE EVEN  (fe_03_00865-A-0045)
TAKEN COMPUTERS AND JUST WANT TO THROW THE COMPUTERS IN THE TRASHCAN AND WE'VE TAKEN THEM AND PUT THEM IN UM  (fe_03_00865-A-0046)
DIFFERENT SCHOOLS THAT WOULD ACTUALLY SET THEM UP AND USE THEM  (fe_03_00865-A-0047)
BUT UM  (fe_03_00865-A-0048)
THERE'S DEFINITELY AN ISSUE OF WHERE THE THE MONEY GOES  (fe_03_00865-A-0050)
YEAH I'VE I'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT OPTION TOO  (fe_03_00865-A-0053)
BUT THEN I GUESS YOU COULD ARGUE IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE PARENTS WHO ARE PAYING UM  (fe_03_00865-A-0054)
HIGH TAXES  (fe_03_00865-A-0055)
YOU DO EXPECT A LITTLE BIT MORE  (fe_03_00865-A-0056)
EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT REALLY FAIR TO THE CHILD GIVEN THE EQUAL  (fe_03_00865-A-0057)
OPPORTUNITY  (fe_03_00865-A-0058)

TEACHERS  (fe_03_00865-A-0064)
SINCE I HAVE WORKED IN SOME PUBLIC SCHOOLS I'VE  (fe_03_00865-A-0065)
NOTICED THAT TEACHERS ARE A LOT LESS STRICT  (fe_03_00865-A-0066)
THAN WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL OR AT LEAST THAT'S MY PERCEPTION NOW WHERE  (fe_03_00865-A-0067)
KIDS TALK BACK OR THEY USE LANGUAGE IN SCHOOL THAT WOULD WOULDN'T BE TOLERATED AT ALL  (fe_03_00865-A-0068)
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY DOES EVEN  (fe_03_00865-A-0071)
LIKE  (fe_03_00865-A-0072)
IF ALL THE KIDS TALK LIKE THEY DO THEN  (fe_03_00865-A-0073)
IT'S ALMOST NORMAL RATHER THAN  (fe_03_00865-A-0074)
A LOT OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS THAT  (fe_03_00865-A-0076)
SO OTHER THAN THAT  (fe_03_00865-A-0078)
WHERE THEY HAVE CERTAIN UM  (fe_03_00865-A-0079)
LIKE  (fe_03_00865-A-0080)
AT EACH LEVEL LIKE EACH GRADE I  (fe_03_00865-A-0081)
SO ARE ARE THEY DOING THAT NOW  (fe_03_00865-A-0086)
YEAH THEY ARE OKAY  (fe_03_00865-A-0087)

[MN] YEAH UH PUBLIC SCHOOLS UM I'VE STUDIED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT EDUCATION AND UM [MN] I I THINK CERTAINLY THEY HAVE FLAWS  (fe_03_00865-B-0005)
UM [MN] THE JUST WITH THE GENERAL DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES UM [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_00865-B-0006)
BE- BECAUSE MOST SCHOOLS ARE FUNDED BY PROPERTY TAX [MN] IF A REGION IS POOR THEY CAN FUND THE SCHOOL LESS UM [MN] AND THAT RESULTS IN GREAT [MN] INEQUALITY UM [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_00865-B-0007)
YEAH [MN]  (fe_03_00865-B-0008)
UM I THINK THAT'S UH  (fe_03_00865-B-0009)

[LIPSMACK] UM IN MY IN MY CLASS ANYWAY IF A CH- CHARTER SCHOOLS AND  (fe_03_00865-B-0011)
THE THE PRIVATE SCHOOL PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED [MN] AND UM  (fe_03_00865-B-0012)
BY POLITICIANS AND BY MY SCHOOL BEING VERY LIBERAL UM WERE SORT OF AGAINST THEM BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT PERPETUATED  (fe_03_00865-B-0013)
THE INEQUALITIES OF VARIOUS REGIONS  (fe_03_00865-B-0014)
[MN] WELL RIGHT  (fe_03_00865-B-0016)
[MN] YEAH IT'S UM IT'S UM IT'S A SCHOOL NOT RUN BY THE TOWN OR THE STATE BUT AN INDEPENDENT ORGANIZATION COMING IN UM  (fe_03_00865-B-0017)
UM  (fe_03_00865-B-0019)
[MN] AND I GUESS THE PLAN THAT AH THE GOVERNMENT WAS TALKING ABOUT A WHILE AGO WAS TO GIVE  (fe_03_00865-B-0020)
A A A TAX CREDIT OF SOME SORT TO UM  (fe_03_00865-B-0021)
PARENTS WHO WHO CHOSE TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO CHARTER SCHOOLS  (fe_03_00865-B-0022)
UM THE PROBLEM WITH IT WAS THAT UM THE TAX CREDIT WOULDN'T BE EQUAL FOR PEOPLE OF ALL  (fe_03_00865-B-0023)
CLASSES OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT CLASSES PAY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF TAX  (fe_03_00865-B-0024)
AND THEY WOULDN'T REALLY HELP THE POORER CLASSES TO GET THEIR CHILDREN OUT OF POOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND INTO THE BETTER  (fe_03_00865-B-0025)
PRESUMABLY BETTER CHARTER SCHOOLS  (fe_03_00865-B-0026)
[MN] I THINK IT WAS A A FEDERAL THING AH [MN] I MUST ADMIT THAT WAS BEFORE I WAS VERY POLITICALLY AWARE [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00865-B-0027)

THAT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT I REMEMBER SO IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE STATE LEVEL I'M SORRY [LAUGHTER] [MN]  (fe_03_00865-B-0031)
I DON'T KNOW [MN] I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT THE PRIVATE SCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE ARE BETTER THAN THE UM THE  (fe_03_00865-B-0032)
PUBLIC SCHOOL PROGRAMS  (fe_03_00865-B-0033)
[MN] UM SO I DON'T KNOW IF ALLOWING PEOPLE TO GO TO PRIVATE SCHOOL IS A BETTER SOLUTION ANYWAY  (fe_03_00865-B-0034)
AH THAT'S A GREAT IDEA [MN] [MN]  (fe_03_00865-B-0037)
YEAH  (fe_03_00865-B-0038)
[MN] AND AND ONE THING PEOPLE HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT I AS I REMEMBER IS THEY'RE TRYING TO  (fe_03_00865-B-0039)
JUST TAKE THE TAX FOR LIKE THE STATE SAY AND THEN DIVIDE IT EQUALLY AMONG ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS  (fe_03_00865-B-0040)
BUT  (fe_03_00865-B-0041)
THAT UM [MN] THAT JUST DOESN'T GO WELL WITH MOST PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY THEY MOVE INTO A COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEY HAD A GOOD SCHOOL SYSTEM OR SOMETHING [MN]  (fe_03_00865-B-0042)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00865-B-0044)

YEAH I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT [MN] CAME ABOUT BUT THAT THAT IS CERTAINLY MY PERCEPTION TOO IS THAT AS TIME GOES ON TEACHERS [MN]  (fe_03_00865-B-0049)
SORT OF CARE LESS AND LESS  (fe_03_00865-B-0050)
UM  (fe_03_00865-B-0051)
IN WHEN THEY'RE IN BAD SITUATIONS I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE FRUSTRATED BECAUSE WHAT THEY'VE TRIED EARLY ON HASN'T MET WITH SUCCESS OR IF IT'S  (fe_03_00865-B-0052)
JUST THAT THEY'RE GETTING OLDER  (fe_03_00865-B-0053)
[LIPSMACK] NO CERTAINLY NOT [MN]  (fe_03_00865-B-0054)
[MN] STANDARDIZING THE CURRICULUM ON A FEDERAL LEVEL I J- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WOULD WORK [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00865-B-0055)
I HEAR THAT THEY DO THAT IN JAPAN  (fe_03_00865-B-0056)

UM A COUPLE OF VOLUMES UM IN THEIR EDUCATION DEPARTMENT OR WHATEVER THAT SAYS BY THE END OF THIRD GRADE CHILDREN WILL BE ABLE TO DO THESE THINGS AND THEN THEY HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR EACH YEAR  (fe_03_00865-B-0061)
UM  (fe_03_00865-B-0062)
AND I KNOW THAT [MN] THE UNITED STATES AT LEAST IS MOVING TOWARD THAT WITH SOME OF THE STANDARDIZED TESTING UM MOVEMENTS  (fe_03_00865-B-0063)
I KNOW I KNOW IN MASSACHUSETTS THERE'S UM  (fe_03_00865-B-0064)
THERE'S A TEST YOU HAVE TO PASS AS A SOPHOMORE IN HIGH SCHOOL IN ORDER TO GET A DIPLOMA [LIPSMACK] UM  (fe_03_00865-B-0065)
YEAH THAT THAT'S WHERE I'M FROM MASSACHUSETTS UM  (fe_03_00865-B-0066)
[LIPSMACK] AND IT WAS IT WAS REALLY A PROBLEM WHEN IT FIRST GOT [MN] IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE LIKE WELL HOW IS THIS FAIR WHY DOES IT HAPPEN AT YOUR SOPHOMORE YEAR  (fe_03_00865-B-0067)
