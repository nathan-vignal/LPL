L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, this is MJ.  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm Davora[?].
L:  Hi.  That's a pretty name.
R:  Thanks.
L:  Ah, where shall we start?  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] It's -- it's a weird topic. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, it is very weird.  [LAUGH]  I was just trying to scan my brain trying to think of what I could think of.  [MN]  Oh, gosh! 
R:  Mm.
L:  Um.  I can think of a few things.  Ah, let me just pick one.  [LAUGH]  Ah, time travel and if we could go back --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- the one thing that we could change.  [MN]  Well, um, I think I know what I would change if I could go back in time travel.  Ah --
R:  [MN] I'm trying to think if there's anything really big I would change.  I'm only twenty years old so ... [MN] 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I'd like to think that so many of my life mistakes are ahead of me, not behind me.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I'm thirty two so I can --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- there's many there.  Would you like me to start though?  
R:  Okay.
L:  Would that be easier?
R:  Yes.
L:  Ah, I would go to college.
R:  [LIPSMACK] That's, ah --
L:  Um, I'd definitely go to college.  I, ah, put off going and now that I'm thirty two it's not quite as easy getting on the track going back to it.  [LAUGH]  That's the one thing that I would change.  [MN]  Um, you know, instead of being older.  Course, I wouldn't mind going now that I'm older.  In fact, I'm thinking about it.
R:  [MN] You definitely should.  I mean, I'm currently there.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Tha- that's cool.  I -- I envy -- or, not really envy, but I admire, I guess, is what I mean to say.
R:  I'm sitting in, ah, my dorm room actually.  [MN] 
L:  Oh, cool,
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's cool.
R:  [MN] Um, I guess there is a few things.  I don't think I would have given up my part in our sixth year production when I was, like, [MN]  eleven ...
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Because I didn't want to miss my gymnastics practices.  But it was stupid of me.  I lasted only one month and I -- I don't think it was a smart decision.  And I think I would have declared one of my majors earlier, instead of being stupid about it, because now I've just declared it, like, a month ago and now it's, like, getting [MN] -- now I have to, like, take six classes or, like, take classes over the summer and stuff.  [MN] So, you know, so, I was just, like, being thick-headed.  I was, like, "The major doesn't really suit my needs" even though I knew I was always going to be -- I should have always been an English major from the second I got here.  And now it's like [MN] ...  So, I ended up doing another major which I really liked, but, you know, it's just like, [MN] damn it, I really should be an English major too.  And I am now --
L:  That's good.
R:  I just declared it but, like, later so I have to, like -- I'm not really doing the concentration I totally want to do in my English, in the, like, the major.  So, it's, like, you know, I made a few mistakes there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, they're not, like, I guess, fatal in the end but, like [MN], you know, I should really, like -- I -- I'm doing, like, a twentieth century concentration with twentieth century literature, which is really interesting but I'm more of, like, a creative writer.  [MN] 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  But it was like --
L:  What's that --
R:  It was like -- it was like, too late to do that one because I, like, didn't have any classes really to count into that.  You know, like -- like, you know, you can play around with, like, your double accounting classes so I could graduate on time, [LAUGH] you know -- but still --and still have the other major.  [MN]  You know, my mom's not, like, gonna pay for fifth year of college.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, did you say you was a creative writer?
R:  I like to write.  So I'm doing that.
L:  You know what?  I do too.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, that's -- what -- what do you write?  Like, what type --
L:  Um, poetry.
R:  [MN] Ah, I like to do -- I'm more a prose type of person.
L:  A what?
R:  I like to write prose.
L:  What is that?
R:  Like, you know, wr- -- like stories, like, more like prose and, um --
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, you know, I've -- I've noticed that some of the stuff that I write, and I've got a feeling we're going to get off the topic now [LAUGH] ...
R:  [MN] That's okay.
L:  It is hard to stay on that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- certain topic though, you know?  It really is.
R:  Yeah, I don't think it really matters.
L:  Um, I think, um, some of the stuff that I write ends up turning into, like, a small story and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so, I guess -- I didn't know that's what they were called.  So, you see --
R:  [MN] Well, pr-
L:  I'm --
R:  Oh, I mean, there's just like genres, like, in the -- within the concentration, you know, like the creative writing concentration in our English major [MN], there's like the [MN] creative prose, creative poetry, you know, creative poetics.  Like, those are, like, types of those proses, like, you know, like a story telling type of writing.  Poetry is --
L:  Okay, yeah.  Well, that sounds so fascinating.  I think that's great that you're doing that.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  Um, I've always been -- I've always leaned more towards, ah, more of an artistic, ah, oh, ability.  I'm not real goo- -- I'm not real technical as a person.
R:  [MN] [LAUGH]  Neither am I. 
L:  I'm more, um, it- -- very, um -- ah, ah, sometimes I don't feel like I fit in.  You know, it's more of a, um, oh, I really never have fit in really.  [LAUGH]  I just don't understand some, you know, it's not as simple for me.  Like I said, I mentioned that I wish I would have went to college...
R:  Mhm.
L:  And now I've -- instead I stayed home.  I -- I've got a family.  I raised -- well, I'm still raising my children and, um, so, now I'm thinking, okay, they're older and I'd like to do something else.  [MN] And, so, you know, and everyone else -- I'm like, okay, I guess, you know, it's not as simple to just go out and get a job.  I want to do something I enjoy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, it's not real easy to try to find, um -- you know, I've got stuff I've written and I keep going over it and going over it and I'm -- I'm -- I'm my worst critic of my work.
R:  Well, everyone is their own worst critic.
L:  And, you know, th- -- and sometimes I'm like, you know, maybe I should change it, maybe I shouldn't.  And, um, I -- I must have this fear because I really ought to just try to submit something, you know?
R:  [MN] Well, it's -- I mean, it's very hard to, um, I mean, what -- I mean, like, you c- -- most people, [LIPSMACK] in terms of submitting things, I mean, just from things I've learned, 'cause I also took like screen writing classes like that, that you can't just submit things to, like, companies 'cause they can't take unsolicited manuscripts.  They're not allowed to by law.  Like, there are companies which just won't do it.  See, like, the best way to do those type of things is just submit them to contests [MN] which --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- which do take unsolicited manuscripts.  So, if you do well in those, if you get, like, in the, like top something, then you have, like, a better edge over somebody else, you know.  Because that's really discussing, like, a screen play, but, like, it works for all types of literary submissions.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause at, like, publishing places or anything they won't take anything that's unsolicited.
L:  I know.  It's like you have to be, like, already known, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and I've -- and I've been doing a lot of research on the computer of different companies, um, 'cause the stuff I write is more towards -- leans towards children.  [MN] And, um, so I've been researching, like, I don't want to, you know -- and if they were happening to be accepting unsolicited -- there is, like, a couple --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of 'em.  I know that they're looking for certain things and I don't want to send something that I have in to a publisher that is totally not looking for what I've got.  You know, I -- I -- [MN] plus I guess I kind of -- I don't know -- I ought to just do it though.  I really should.  You know, if I do find one [MN], you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or, like, a contest.  But I'm kind of leery about 'em.  
R:  Well, I mean, a lot of contests are quite reputable and people do actually do well from them.  And as I said [MN] it's really a lot, like, the -- like the resort for all people who don't have agents or something like that because [MN] -- because the publishing companies or any of these companies really won't take anything that's unsolicited.  [MN] But, you know, once you've, like, gone through a contest and, like, you have that organization type of thing, [MN] they, like, you know, sometimes can, like, y- -- help you out with that type of stuff.
L:  Yeah, really?  Well, tha- -- well, that's some great advice.  I'm gl- --I'm so glad we're talking.  [LAUGH] And it's so neat too to find that, you know, that we've got that in common, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's really neat.  Um --
R:  [MN]
L:  I've always also enjoyed -- I -- when I talked about going back to college I thought even, um, I've always enjoyed literature, um, as far as, ah, the reading part and, like, um, plays and stories and I thought, boy, it would be neat to become a teacher and teach that stuff, you know.  [MN] Um, so, I've got a lot of areas I'm trying to consider.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know one thing for sure, whatever I do I want to enjoy it, you know?
R:  Well, that's key.  I mean, that's another reason, um, [MN] I declared a second major is -- I mean, I believe, like, now, I'm, like, going crazy.  I'm mean, like [inaudible] of the week.  You know, it's like I'm down to it.  I just like really have to read all the time, just like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know. [MN]
L:  My big thing is quotes.  I love quotes.  I'm always -- I -- I've started this thing now where I find these really great quotes and I email everyone on my address book and I hope to inspire them.  Um, I ought to start up my own little thing where [LAUGH] -- um, I like to make 'em -- I like to make people think, you know?  And, ah, then hopefully they make -- and, you know, what's really neat about quotes is that everybody takes them a little bit different and I find that really fascinating 'cause I'll have -- I'll get a couple responses and, um, it's really neat and they're always --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- good responses.
R:  I mean, quotes and stuff like that are, I think, very good but they're just -- they're -- they're just, like, a fragment, you know.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I mean, they -- they do capture something but they, ah -- isolate a lot of things out and --
L:  Yeah, they do.  I guess that's why I guess --
R:  And, you know what?  And like, now everyone writes in a very quotable type of way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, there are some people who are just [MN] everything they say or everything they write is a quotation but [MN] everyone writes in a very quotable type of way.  But sometimes there's writers who actually have a lot more to say.  [MN] Um, than [MN] I don't know, like, sometimes -- sometimes if you can reduce all that -- every -- something that everyone says, or all the wisdom to you, like, all the lines, I don't think there's so much contained in that line, you know, 'cause I fi- -- I just finished reading, I think, one of the best books I've ever read and I think one of the things he tries to do is just try to just, like, [MN] you know, abolish this whole idea of just, like, reducing things, like, to these trite, you know, platitudes.  [MN] 'Cause he was writing about war and, like, he starts off with a typical platitude about war, "War is hell" and then he just expands it.  And he goes into every single contradiction about war.  So, you're expecting your typical platitude, like a typical clich --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Your typical quote.  And then it's just done away with because it isn't that quote, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Oh, that sounds neat.  I -- I bet that would be a good book.
R:  It is if you want -- if you're interested, it's called The Things They Carried and it's by Tim O'Brien.  It's really amazing.  Um, it's --
