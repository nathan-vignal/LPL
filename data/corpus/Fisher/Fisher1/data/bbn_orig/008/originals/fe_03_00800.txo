R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name is Anne Marie.
R:  Hi, I'm Lisa.
L:  Hi Lisa.  So, ever thought about opening a business?
R:  I've never thought about actually doing it, but um ...
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  I think it's something that I -- I've talked about with my friends, hypothetically.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ah, just sort of a way to make money, but nothing I've ever seriously considered, um, one of the things we've talked about is opening a club --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, 'cause I'm a student, so, and, ah, I live in a college town, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's something that we do a lot and spend a lot of our own money on, [LAUGH] so ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We could see the ways that, ah, you could make a lot of money from it, I guess.
L:  Yeah, like, and do you see, like, if there is a certain kind of club you would go to it but there isn't one, so you'd like to open one like that?
R:  Um, I'm not sure.  I mean, th- there are several, ah, around where we live that are really good and, um, people go to a lot but there's always, I guess, when you live in a college town there's always, like, the places that everyone goes to and then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the places that people don't, so you know, you could think of ways to take over those ones and make 'em better, you know, better music and, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, just better atmosphere and um, you know, keeping it, a lot of times keeping it over twenty one is a good way to keep it a little more, I guess, it keeps it, like, a little classier, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a little more upscale if it's over twenty one.  Um, also keeping it affordable for, um, students, I guess --
L:  Yeah, students.
R:  -- is another thing.  How about yourself?
L:  Um, well, me and my husband have thought about opening lots of businesses, um, like, ev- every time we think, "We need this".
R: [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Hey!  We could open a business and make money. [LAUGH] But, um, we've never done it.  Um, we've had this dream of after we, you know, live our life working the nine to five grind --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- of opening a restaurant together --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just the two of us when we're older, and that would be fun because we both like to cook --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, every time we talk about it we have different ideas of what kind of food we'd serve, or --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it would be, you know, one specific kind of food or a vegetarian restaurant or no.  It would be any kind of food from all over the world --
R:  Mhm.
L:  --because we also like to travel.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, that sort of thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, restaurants are scary.  The, um, to open a restaurant's really risky.
R:  Mhm.  I think opening any kind of business that would -- that's either like, a restaurant or a bar or a club or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- any kind of like, food or entertainment [COUGH] kind of depends on what the people like wherever you happen to open it, what -- what else is around that, you know --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- is competition and, um, a lot of it is the image that you put into it, too, I think, like --
L:  I think so.  Like, yeah, and like you were talking about your club, you'd have to find a -- an atmosphere thing to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- make your niche so that people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- want to come to your place specifically because they like the atmosphere, or think it's cool.
R:  Right.  A lot of people don't want to -- I mean, actually, some people prefer to go to a place that's not as nice and, you know, a little bit more laid back where you don't have to dress a certain way, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- every once in a while, ah, even people who don't like to do that all the time would like to -- you know, on special occasions and stuff, go to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- somewhere where it's nice and people are dressed nicely and there's a nice place to sit down as well as somewhere where you can dance and, you know, you feel, also you feel safe there.
L:  Yeah.  That's a big one.
R:  Yeah, I mean, with a lot of ah, bars and clubs and stuff that I've been to, certain ones that aren't really as nice, there, you know, there can be fights and people are just being stupid and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it -- it makes you not have fun.  So, you'd want to, kind of -- you'd have to keep a certain image for um, for it to go right, basically.
L:  Yeah.  So ...
R:  [COUGH]
L:  PR would be very important to opening that sort of business.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  For a restaurant too, just word of mouth and that sort of thing as well.
R:  What?
L:  And word of mouth.
R:  Mm.
L:  Be big.
R:  That's true.  I think another thing, though, is that, I mean, at least at the beginning you'd have to spend all your time there.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Getting it started.  I mean -- I mean eventually you'd -- you'd work up to where you can have a staff that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you can trust to, you know, be honest and do things the way that you want them done and not, ah, mess things up or try to, you know, steal your money or [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  Anything like that, but um, at first, I mean, I'm sure, like, at least the first couple of years it would have to -- you'd have to be constantly on top of it and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there every day and every night making sure that people were happy and kind of, also seeing if, you know, any changes need to be made to, you know, the kind of food you're serving or the kind of music you're playing or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the, you know, the decoration or anything like that, so ...
L:  Yeah, I think you're right, at the beginning of any business like that y- it would have to be your life for a while, while you built it up.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Which, I think that's what's so daunting about starting your own businesses, you know, you spend your life on it for a certain period of time and then if it fails it's a big blow.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think -- I think that's why more people don't do it, you know what I mean.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  I actually know, um, a family who opened, ah, their own deli and I think it was for, like, the first, maybe two or three years that they weren't really doing very good business --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, and, ah, it was just, you know, it was kind of slow because there were a lot of other ah, places it -- it was in a business district and there were, you know, tons of other places where people could go and it was a tiny little place, but eventually --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, ended up doing so well that, ah, they opened up a liquor store next door and another deli --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- in the next town over.  So, but that was after, like, it was the first two or three years that they weren't doing well then they started doing well and I think it was about four years after that --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- they were eventually able to expand it, so I mean, it does -- it takes a lot of time and patience and, I know there were several times where they had considered, you know, giving up and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- going and doing something else, but ...
L:  Yeah, I think you'd have to have a vision, you know, of something you're waiting -- you're waiting it out because you have this vision of how it can be. [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.
L:  If you just wait long enough and work hard enough, so you can't be half hearted about it.  I totally agree.
R:  Exactly.  And I think that also if it -- if it involves someone who has a family and often times, I think the whole family gets involved in it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it becomes something that's a commitment for everyone.  Like, this -- this family that I was talking about that, ah, owns a -- the deli and the liquor store and everything now, um, when they first started even, you know, their kids were coming and working there after school and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, um, they had nieces and nephews who came and helped out, um, after hours and stuff, you know, so it's -- I mean it takes a lot of commitment and also a lot of support from family and friends to really ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Get something like that --
L:  Definitely
R:  -- going and keep it going really.
L:  Yeah, and like in my situation, where if my husband would want to start something or if I would want to start something we'd totally need each other's commitment --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because otherwise it'd be such a strain.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, if -- if one of us is doing something the other didn't really believe in and was taking so much time and energy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so it wouldn't hardly be worth it.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah, it just takes so much work in the beginning, that's what's scary to me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So much work for a possibility. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's true.  It's -- I mean, it's a big risk.  It's, um, especially if you're in a place where there's so many other things --
L:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, th- th- wherever you live offers so many other opportunities, you know, so many other restaurants and so many other bars and things --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's -- something like that is just -- it's a huge risk and, you know, it- it's constantly how do you make yourself better than the next person and how do you keep it better than the next person who's going to open another place.
L:  Right.  And on the other hand if you -- you may open something totally new, but if it's in a small community where there aren't enough people to support it --
