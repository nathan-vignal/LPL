L:  Dianna
R:  Hi, this is Chrissie.  What state do you live in?
L:  West Virginia.
R:  Oh, me too. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  Um --
L:  I live in Charleston.
R:  I'm in, ah, Elkins.
L:  Mm.
R:  Little town.  Anyway.  Okay, back in time, I was on hold, thinking time travel, hm, um --
L:  I don't know what I would do.
R:  I think I would change, um, I'd have my kids closer together.  Because I have one that's fourteen and one that's seven.  And there's quite a gap. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, mine are seven, three and two.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] That's not a real big gap.
L:  No.  Mine are kind of close.
R:  I don't know.  It would be interesting to be able to do that, though.
L:  Yeah.  It would be cool.  I don't know what I would do.  I don't know.
R:  Well, there's bound to be something.
L:  I would probably -- which I'm sure she knew, but I would make sure that, like, when my mom died that she absolutely, positively knew that I love her.
R:  Oh.
L:  That would be -- I mean, I know she knew, but like --
R:  Were you a teenager?
L:  No, it was last year.  But she was, like, you know, she couldn't understand anything then.
R:  Yeah.  That would be hard.
L:  And I would make sure before, I guess, that -- that she knew for sure, you know.
R:  Do you think[?] you spent enough time --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with her?
L:  No [LAUGH] 
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH] No, not at all.  No.
R:  I think that's a big thing.  I think if you could go back.  That's the thing, I think if I could back I would spend more time -- see, my son's fourteen, I think I would spend more time, like, with him at -- while he was littler.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I feel like I did while we were going through it, but now that he's a teenager, it's wow. [LAUGH]
L:  Teenager, yeah.
R:  They grow up so fast that --
L:  I know.
R:  -- may be more vacations.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That would be a plus, but that would be hard to have your mom pass away and --
L:  Yeah, it's not easy.  Not at all.
R:  Would you change getting married or anything like that?
L:  I don't know.  
R:  [LAUGH] We can talk about anything because, like, nobody we know's going to know. [LAUGH]
L:  She didn't um, she didn't want me to get married, but I don't know.
R:  I think I would have changed -- I could -- would change maybe -- we eloped.
L:  That's what we did.
R:  I think maybe I would go back and have the wedding and the pictures.
L:  Yeah, that would be nice.
R:  Yeah.  That's probably -- I think I'd change a lot of things [LAUGH] 
L:  I probably would too.  You get to thirty and start thinking, wow, I did that wrong and this wrong, if I could go back, I'd really change it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is this the first survey you did?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I haven't -- I couldn't get my doggone pin number.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  They were calling me and I ran and I didn't know what it was, and I finally called 'em and said, "I need my pin number".
R:  Yeah, I was on hold for a while and I was sitting here thinking -- 'cause it just said that we would be discussing time travel and I thought, I'd like to go ahead in time and see what my kids --
L:  What's going to happen.
R:  -- would be living.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What kind of -- how -- what the world would be like when they're, you know, older and have children, not necessarily to -- to see what was going on in their life, but just to see like, what the world was like.
L:  I can't imagine.
R:  Because it seems like everything's such a mess --
L:  I know.  It seems like each year it gets worse and worse.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah it does.  I think I'd go back and get a better education, too.
L:  I think I would do that.  I wished I would have went to college.
R:  Me too.  What --
L:  I should have.
R:  Yeah.  Me too, but then I opted -- are you a stay at home mom?
L:  No, I work, but ...
R:  I opted, you know, I wanted to stay home with the kids but, and I'm glad I did but, you know, you see kids that their parents work and they're doing great and I'm -- here I've got one that I'm involved with everything he does and he's failing eighth grade. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, it just depends on the kid, I guess.
L:  I guess.  He asked me -- my son asked me the other day, "If you could go back in time would have of had me?"
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] And I said, "Well, yes.  Your problems are not, you know, you don't just change".  But I really think I would have had my kids closer together.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But that would probably be [SIGH] probably be if I could just go back and change one thing.  [SIGH] That would probably be it.  'Cause having, you know, another one closer.  That'd be hard if they could tell you you could only go back and change one thing.
L:  I know, because you'd have to really think about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It would be difficult.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I still think it would be -- I think I would have spent more time with my mother, appreciated her --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which I did appreciate her, you know what I mean, a lot more than a lot of people I talk to that's my age, the way they talk about their mothers.  I never [LAUGH] talked my mom like that.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  Yeah my mom's, like, my best friend in the world.
L:  And that's the way my mom was and you know, I don't know.  I just feel like I wished I could have, you know, knew for sure. [several inaudible words]
R:  Did she have a brain injury or something?
L:  She had, um -- she had had breast cancer.
R:  Oh.
L:  And she -- and it spread all over her body.
R:  Oh.
L:  And then she had, like, ten tumors in her brain.
R:  Oh.
L:  It hit her really fast, I mean, she got it and then she just all of a sudden, she was really sick, and it was hard on her.
R:  Th- how old are you?
L:  I'm twenty eight.
R:  I'm thirty five.  I'll be thirty six.
L:  She was fifty.
R:  Oh, that's so young.
L:  She just turned fifty and she, um, she's very close to my oldest daughter.  They used to watch her, my parents, when she was little, so, my two youngest they were two.
R:  And your daughter's seven.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, my daughter's seven and I can't imagine --
L:  It was very hard; they were extremely close.
R:  It probably still is.
L:  Yeah, she misses her.  She's very close to her.  And my dad just got remarried and that's been hard on us too.
R:  You know, I bet when -- if she grows up she will probably say if she could go back she wouldn't want her grandma to pass away.
L:  Probably so.
R:  You know.  I mean, really ...
L:  She was very close to her.  Very close.  And that's the thing with me, I think, you know, if I could change things I'd rather my mom be [LAUGH] here to take care of my kids than me. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I feel like, she could be so much a better mom.  I always thought I could be like her, um.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I have -- I have moments like that too. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, 'cause -- 'cause she was so patient and never hollered or never yelled at us and just always looked at the best in everything --
R:  Did she raise you herself, or d- was your dad around?
L:  No, my dad was there.  He's just an asshole.
R:  Mine too, but he wasn't really around.
L:  He did- I mean, he lived with us, but he didn't work or anything.  My mom [inaudible] takes, you know, me and my brother, she took care of us, she bought us everything.  She worked really hard and, you know --
R:  Isn't it neat --
L:  'Course, he did -- he did take care of her in the end when she couldn't do anything, but, you know --
R:  How's he dealt with it since then?
L:  He -- he -- he just got remarried.
R:  Already?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  H- h- how's that affected you?
L:  Not very well.
R:  That'd be hard.  I mean it's hard, you know, to accept, like, step people anyway, but --
L:  Right, that's kind of the way I feel.
R:  It kind of would be, like, you know, have a little bit more res- I would be, like, have a little more respect for my mother.
L:  I feel like, you know, he didn't [inaudible] thing --
R:  You know though, there's some people that can't live -- they need somebody.
L:  Yeah, that's what everybody says. I said, well, you know, I don't know, it still hurts.
R:  Yeah, it would.
L:  It's still going to hurt me and maybe eventually I'll get used to it.
R:  I'd be mad.
L:  He didn't even tell me he was --
R:  Yeah, I'd be really mad, I think.
L:  Oh, I was mad.  He didn't even tell me he was getting married.
R:  Oh.
L:  It was um -- I had went to sell my taxes[?] and his sister does my taxes[?] because she works at H&R Block and I said, "Have you talked to my dad lately?"  And she said, "Oh no, it's been about a week, but I know he got married yesterday".
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] And I was like, oh, my God! [LAUGH] 
R:  I wonder how people felt when m- me and my husband came back like, -- and like, we- we're married! [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  I think -- I think it was, like, a major let down to our parents because they wanted, you know, a wedding.
L:  Right.  
R:  But ...
L:  I did the same thing.  Course my -- my parents and his parents knew we were getting married before we went, but they didn't like it.
R:  Isn't it weird how you can like, talk to somebody like this that you like --
L:  Don't even know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm one of those people, whenever I like, call, there's something like, oh yeah, I can do that because I can like, talk to anybody [LAUGH] any where.
L:  Well, sometimes it's easier to talk to people you don't know because you don't know 'em and you're like, well, they can't judge me 'cause they don't know me.
R:  Yeah, yeah. It, you know.
L:  You know.
R:  I mean nobody's going to know this, that's why, it's like, you know, I'm -- I was trying to think do I have any deep, dark -- I mean, I never had an abortion that I could say, well --
