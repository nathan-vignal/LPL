L:  Hi.  
R:  How ya doing?  I'm Todd.
L:  I'm Bonnie.
R:  Hi Bonnie.  What do you think about --
L:  How're you?
R:  Great.
L:  Um, I don't know.  What do you think of it?
R:  [MN] Well, I, ah -- they just say you can go back and change one thing in time or can you travel in time any way or ...?
L:  I don't know.  See, I'd like to go back and see things.  I don't know if I want to personally revisit my past, you know.  Um, is there one thing that you would change about yourself?
R:  I don't think there is anything I would change in my life, you know.  I've had my bad times and I've had my good times but it makes me who I am.
L:  That's what I always figured, you know.  Now, if it was an opportunity to go back, you know, way back in time or something or forward, that might be something else.  
R:  Yeah, or if you could go back and change something maybe, like nine eleven, or --
L:  Right.
R:  Or -- or get Hitler before he did all his bad stuff or -- but --
L:  Yeah, and see how much that would change everything from then on down?
R:  Yeah, i- i- [MN] it's kind of mind bo- -- I mean, i- i- it could never be done but [MN] ...
L:  Right.  Um, do you --
R:  I personally wouldn't change nothing in my life.
L:  I don't think I would either.  I -- I mean, even when you say, "Well, I wished I wouldn't have done that" or something like that, if you really think about it you wouldn't be where you are now.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Right --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if you wouldn't have made the decisions, whether they were [LAUGH] right or wrong.
R:  [LAUGH]  So, how long do we have to talk about this?
L:  Ten minutes.
R:  Okay.  Keep it -- [LAUGH]  I mean --
L:  Well, I gue-
R:  I'm sorry.
L:  I don't know -- oh, go ahead.
R:  Mm.  [SIGH] No, I was listening to you.  
L:  Oh, um, do you like, like, time travel, like, thinking about it, like with movies and books and stuff or ...?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Are you --
R:  Back to the Future was, kind of, I mean, a fun movie, escapist --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and stuff like that.  I -- I mean, phew, but I -- I don't know, it -- it just -- it's definitely impossible [MN].  It would be impossible but ...
L:  Yeah, right, because you then you run into that -- all that paradox stuff that they're always talking about, you know?
R:  Mm.
L:  If you go back and change something then it changes everything or would it or could it or [LIPSMACK] I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]  It's kind of fun talking about but then when you start thinking about it, jeeze, [LIPSMACK] I don't know. [MN]
L:  Yeah, it would be interesting, like, to go back and see, like, the pyramids being built or something like that but --
R:  Oh, yeah, that -- that's true.  You could go back and see how the universe was put together and everything.  You could --
L:  Right.
R:  You --
L:  If you could just be a spectator, I guess.
R:  Right, you could see everything and know everything that's -- that's real.  There would be no specula- -- I mean, who shot Kennedy, wha- -- what happened and ... you know?
L:  Yeah, that's true, yeah.  Um, yeah, buy IBM stock way back when.
R:  Oh, yeah!  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Or whatever.
R:  I'm trying to figure out now what kind of stocks to buy so maybe I should have -- sh- -- should wish I could do that.
L:  Oh, yeah.  [MN] I don't know.
R:  Yeah, that'd be great.
L:  Well, at least time travel's better than talking about Wall Street, for me, or something 'cause --
R:  Ah [LAUGH] that's one of my passions, I'm sorry.
L:  [MN] Oh.
R: I'm not doing well but ...
L:  Oh, so you would have been better at that, huh?  Talking about that?
R:  Oh, I'd love to talk about that.
L:  Yeah, see, I don't --
R:  Well, they didn't offer me that.  They just called me and said this.
L:  I guess every day it's a different topic 'cause --
R:  Oh, oh, oh.
L:  -- um, the lady that told me about this, she had Wall Street and she basically had nothing to say for ten minutes, which [SIGH] probably would be about what I'm like.
R:  Oh, well, I could have talked enough for both of us, believe me [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, really?  Yeah.
R:  Not good talk, though, lately.  I mean, the last three years have been terrible but [LIPSMACK] but time travel would have been great for that.  Or even just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, th- -- that's about the only way, because they're talking about going back, not forward, right?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's what it seems to be, just in your own life, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that kind of wraps that up pretty quick.
R:  Yeah, but that could make us -- that could -- could have made everyb- -- anybody that could do it a very rich person but ...
L:  Really, yeah, in any number of ways, really, yeah.
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] for sure.
L:  You could tell when the stock market was coming, you know, to an abrupt, you know, sell or whatever and [LIPSMACK] make -- you know, save your money that way too.
R:  [MN] You could sell short and make money that way and do all kinds of things.  There's ways to play the market both ways.
L:  [MN] Okay, so if we could change that, I might change that [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  But, of course, then we'd be, you know, on different paths anyway, so ...
R:  Well, I think it would be boring to be able to go back and change something.  Then you wouldn't -- you'd -- you'd know exactly the outcome and [SIGH] to me, life, the fun of it is, you know, not knowing what's gonna happen.  Now, it's not all grand but ... [MN]
L:  [MN] Right, and meeting the people that you meet and, you know, even the bad stuff, y- -- you learn stuff from that, sometimes --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- bigger, [MN] you know, things than you do from the good stuff.  Makes you think and make decisions [NOISE] that you wouldn't have had to contemplate making, so ...
R:  Oh, I agree with that.  I think I've learned a lot more from the things that went wrong than th- -- that have gone good.
L:  Yeah, now, that's kind of a sad statement but it's true, isn't it?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, sad but ... [LAUGH]
L:  Probably 'cause those are the things that, um, you know, bring us to the realization of [MN] what life is all about and what we could lose and what, you know, can change in a minute and stuff, so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess the happy times are easier just to coast through.
R:  Yeah, from the books I've read, that's -- the happy times you wanna -- wanna party and just have a good time and the -- the -- the bad times you kind of sit and ponder about and think, "Oh, what went wrong" and you learn more from it but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'd still pick the good over the bad [LAUGH] but ...
L:  Well, yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  That would be interesting though.  Um, [MN] no, I -- even now, just, you know, trying to think one thing and I still can't think of anything that I would change.
R:  [MN] I can't think of anything.  I have five beautiful healthy children, I'm [MN] happily married, and [MN] I can't see it any other way.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  We work our butts off and struggle to get by but -- but we do a lot of laughing and having fun.  We have bad times but I can't think of one thing I'd change. [MN]
L:  Yeah and you've got your whole family and, who knows what that would change about that, so, yeah, that's true.
R:  Yeah, maybe get a -- more education, be smarter when I was in college or something like that but ...
L:  Oh, yeah, I coulda definitely done that.  A little less partying and a little more studying.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  But then, you know, I might not have been working where I was working when I met my wife.  I ma- -- might have been working somewhere else and ...
L:  Right.  So, everything changes.
R:  Yeah, I [MN] -- it would totally change your life if you could travel back and change one thing, I believe.  [MN] And I'm not sure I'd want to change anything like that.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I don't think so either.  Um, the only time I've ever thought about travelling in time would be like big things, you know, to go back like you said and change something that, you know, created history or something or see something happening.  But that doesn't necessarily -- I'd -- mean you'd even wanna change that to a certain extent because who knows how that would affect everything?
R:  Yeah, right.  Huh.  Jeeze.  [MN] Yeah, so, seems like we agree.  Are we supposed to fight on this or are we supposed --
L:  I have no idea.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um.
R:  Is this the first one you've ever done?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh.
L:  I just signed up this morning.
R:  Well, s- -- so did I.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so I have no idea.
R:  Actually, I didn't sign up till this afternoon so ...
L:  Yeah --
R:  After I got-
L:  That's odd, isn't it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Came right through.
R:  Well, they asked me what time it would be best to call.  I said eight to ten.  At eight o'clock, like, [LAUGH] I got the phone call right away.  So it was great.
L:  Oh, yeah, I signed up from five to eight.  So you must be --
R:  Whoa, you got it right at the end.
L:  Yeah.  Um, well, no, 'cause I'm mountain standard time, so ...
R:  Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow.
L:  Yeah, it's like --
R:  Well, I'm eastern, so ...
L:  Yeah, so, we're [NOISE] a couple of hours off then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  See, so you already know some future events that I don't know!  [LAUGH]
R:  Hey, yeah!
L:  [LAUGH]  So apparently --
R:  Well, nothing bad happened.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, that's good.  [LAUGH]  Oh, I don't know ...
R:  We haven't talked for ten minutes yet?  [LAUGH] Do they tell us?
L:  I imagine.  I guess the computer breaks in from what, um, the girl told me.
R:  Oh.
L:  I guess it abruptly ends it.  I don't know.  
R:  Oh.
L:  So ... [LIPSMACK]
R:  Well, I wish I could set back time [MN] so we could do this all over again.  It's been a pleasure talking to you for sure --
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  -- just in case they cut us off quick.
L:  Okay, yeah, it's interesting anyway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'm glad you've had a good life that you don't wanna change.  That's nice.  
R:  Well, I'd be -- I'd be afraid [MN] you know --
L:  Yeah, I would too.
R:  I've had hard times and we've had hard times and, you know, it's been a struggle to raise five kids and all that but [SIGH] [COUGH] but all in all [MN] I have nothing really to regret.
L:  Well, that's nice to hear anyway.
R:  Even if I could change anything I -- I don't think I would [MN].  If that's what they want me to talk about, but if I could change something in history I might be willing to do that. 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I might do that too, you know.
R:  Even though you said then you don't know what else would have happened then, so ...
L:  Yeah, you know, I mean, for every --
R:  If you wou- --
L:  For every cause there's an effect, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know ...
R:  So, if you would have prevented nine eleven, maybe
