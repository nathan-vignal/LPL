L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  This is Julie.
R:  Hi.  This is Heather.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  How're you doing?
L:  Good.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  So, what a- --what's the thing at public schools and --
R:  And what's wrong with it and what can be done?  [MN] 
L:  Hmm.
R:  [LAUGH]  I think that could take more than ten minutes.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Well --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I don't know what I think.  
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Ah, I think a lot of it's, um, that parents expect the teachers --
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  -- to raise their kids.  I don't know.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah, they --
R:  It seems to be a big problem.
L:  Yeah, they expect the teachers to do too much.
R:  Right.  I mean they don't teach their kids basic manners, you know, not to beat up the other kids, you know, that sort of thing.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah, and it's not like it was before.  [NOISE]  I mean, half the kids in schools today don't listen.  [NOISE] 
R:  Right, right.  [SIGH]
L:  As far as the schooling goes, I really don't think [NOISE] there's anything wrong with the schooling --
R:  No, no.
L:  -- i- in the US.  I mean, they still go and I think they learn quite a lot actually.  
R:  Right, I -- they're definitely understaffed though --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with as big as class sizes are getting now.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
R:  Phew!
L:  Yeah, they've been growing.
R:  Yep.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]
L:  Do you have kids?
R:  No, no, actually, I'm about two years away from becoming a teacher.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's kind of interesting for you then.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  [MN]  Do you have kids?
L:  Yeah, I got one.  He's little.  Nine mo- -- eight months.
R:  Ah.  So you got a while before school then.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, no, I think -- I think they learn a lot in school.  I have a couple of brothers that are young and they're about to go to school too.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  My other -- my other brother's fifteen.  He comes home surprising me with some of the things he knows.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  [LAUGH]  Oh.  My -- all my brothers are past schooling, about in their mid thirties now.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  [MN] 
L:  I look at his homework and try to help him and he knows half -- more than I do.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And on computers they learn a lot on computers too.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I know people in school probably know more than I do about them.
R:  [MN]  [MN] 
L:  So --
R:  Hm.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Where are you from?
R:  Oh, I'm in Texas.
L:  Mm.
R:  Where're y- --
L:  I'm in Pennsylvania
R:  Ah.  So, you're pretty close to the study then, huh?
L:  Yeah, yeah, actually.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]
L:  I'm not sure if schooling down there is different?
R:  Um, teachers definitely aren't treated as well down here.  
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I think that's why we have a lot of problem with, um, too many kids in classes 'cause teachers are paid I think less than minimum wage around here.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  It's -- it's pretty bad.  So, you -- y- --you can easily have, like, thirty kids in a class.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, which, I -- I mean, it wasn't that big when I went to school which wasn't that long ago --
L:  No.
R:  -- but --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- they, ah, they don't get the benefits they should and I think that -- well, I went to a fairly good school district and then I moved down -- I lived near an army base and I can tell that the, ah, the quality of education's much lower.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  [MN] 
L:  I think the schooling up here is pretty good.  I think most of the teachers, I mean, get paid pretty well.  [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  With the three months off and ...
R:  True, true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And as far as the learning goes, I think it's pretty good around here. [MN] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] [MN] 
L:  [MN]  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Hm.  Now what?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  [MN] 
L:  [NOISE]  I don't think that classroom sizes are as big up here though.
R:  No.
L:  Huh-uh.  Like, maybe twenty -- twenty.
R:  That's not too bad.
L:  Huh-uh.
R:  That's a lot -- a lot to manage especially in, like, elementary school --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- classes.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah.  I think that'd be hard.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Kids can get pretty wild.
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [MN] 
R:  Hm.  [LIPSMACK]  So what can be done to improve them?  I guess that's part of the, ah, the topic.
L:  Hm.
R:  Hm.
L:  Maybe, like, you said, lower the class size.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  [MN] 
R:  We have a severe lack of teachers down here.
L:  Really?
R:  Especially for English as a second language.  That's -- that's a big thing here.
L:  Really?  [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]  We have --
L:  Oh.
R:  We have quite a few Mexicans here [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  But, um, yeah, I guess -- I -- I think they need to improve the benefits down here for teachers.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  Maybe even one on one training with the kids --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- that are behind.  [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It seems like many people aren't really motivated to be teachers down here --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- between the low pay -- I think they get paid about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- maybe thirty thousand --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a year, maybe.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  I've seen as little as, like, twenty seven starting, depending on what area you're at, but, ah ...
L:  Wow, that's not a lot at all.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]   Yeah, it's -- it's not much.  You definitely don't go into that for the pay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Wow.  I don't -- I don't know what they get paid up here but I think it's more than that anyways.
R:  Yeah, I think -- I think it's a little bit more.  The cost of living's a little lower down here but, ah, yeah.  Between the benefits and -- and the pay, yeah, it -- it's not [MN], I don't know, not too impressive.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I was actually thinking of moving to Pennsylvania to, um -- oh, what was that college up there?  Mm.  I think it's in Harrisburg, I can't remember.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  There was a teacher college up there --
L:  I'm not sure.  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I was going to go to.  Harrisburg?
L:  I don't know.
R:  Yeah, I think that was it.  [MN] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I can't stand the cold though.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  You think if there was, like, better pay there would be more teachers?
R:  I think so.
L:  And then they'd be better?
R:  I think so.  Um, yeah, we just have a-- we have a huge shortage down here.  And that was one of the -- the big, um -- for the governor's race, that was a big topic, was how well they were going to fund education and teachers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH]  I don't think either one -- either candidate was going to do too well for that but ...[LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, jeeze.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Well.
R:  [MN]  [LAUGH] 
L:  I really don't think it's like that up here.  [NOISE]  I think for the most part that it's pretty good.  I think that maybe they could have more one on one training --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for the kids that are lagging behind.  [NOISE] 
R:  Right.
L:  But other than that I think everything up here is pretty good.
R:  Hm.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  I think some people say, "Have them go to school on week -- weekends or even [NOISE] more through the summer, but I think it's good that they have their summer off.  That's --"
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- something that they look forward to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all year long.  It would really be a [inaudible].
R:  [LAUGH]  [MN] Summer always seems really long to me.  [MN]  Like, it seemed like, okay, well, we've had, you know, a month off.  Okay, now it's time -- it's time to go back.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  And, um, I don't -- I don't know about complete year round schools and ...
L:  [NOISE]  No.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Maybe even longer vacations then --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- shorten it up at the end.  I don't know.  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  I mean, it works better for college 'cause we -- we got actually six weeks off for winter break.  
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  It makes it a lot easier to plan --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for, you know, vacations and that sort of thing.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
R:  But, ah --
L:  [NOISE]  Here.
R:  [LAUGH]  [MN] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Hm.
L:  I don't know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's kind of different because, like you said, the schooling down there's different from up here.
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause I think they get good education around here for most of the schools around here.  You've always got the schools that aren't as good and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I think for the most part they're pretty well taught.
R:  Yeah, I think they're  -- they're pretty -- pretty good down here.  I mean, I was -- I wasn't disappointed.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um [MN]  Hm.  [LIPSMACK]  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  C'mon.  Come over here.  I'm just glad I'm not [inaudible] [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE]  It feels good anyway.  [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Hm.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  It's kind of hard to fill up ten minutes.
L:  I know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Don't really want to talk much about school now that I'm out.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh.  
L:  Michael, stop it, honey.  [NOISE]
R:  I'm actually looking forward to getting out so I can actually get summers off again.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, really.  That'd be nice.
R:  Yeah, I'm definitely looking forward to that.  [MN]  [LIPSMACK]
L:  What are the hours down there that they go to school?  Are they the same?
R:  Um, let's see.  About some time around eight till about -- I don't remember elementary school and middle school.  I think it was about two or three.  And then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- high school got out -- gets out around four.
L:  That's the same.  Well, actually, I think most places around here the high school gets out earlier.
R:  Hm.
L:  They go earlier and get out earlier.
R:  Hm.
