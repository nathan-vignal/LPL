L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hello? 
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  This is -- 
L:  I'm Carol.
R:  Carol?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm Joyce.  How're you doing?
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  [LAUGH]  So, reality TV, huh?
L:  Interesting.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  Do you watch any?
L:  [MN]  Um, very little.  [MN] 
R:  I have to admit, I am a Survivor fan.
L:  [MN]  Oh.  [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's one I've never watched.  [MN] 
R:  Ah, I -- I -- I started watching it, like, the second -- I think the second show.  I didn't watch the first one --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that they did and then I started watching on the second show.
L:  [MN] 
R:  So, ah, what -- what ones have you watched before?
L:  [MN]  Well, my daughter got me interested in Am- -- The Amazing Race.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  She really enjoyed that and she [MN] went and tried to sign up for it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  [MN] 
R:  Oh, that's interesting.
L:  They haven't heard anything yet but, um, that one at -- at least it has -- it interests you because you can get to see different things, not very much, but [MN] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and --
R:  Oh, I've watched that one a couple of times.
L:  I think its less cut throaty [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because they're too interested in trying to get where they have to go instead of, you know --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- doing things to -- to undermine other people.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly, and all that, ah [MN] -- in Survivor, you know, they do so much of the, you know, um, talking about each other --
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- behind each other's back, you know. [MN] 
L:  Yeah, a lot of back stabbing.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah, yeah, you know, what's this person doing and I'll vote for this person, are you going to vote for that person, and they're going yeah, yeah, yeah.  Thinking no, no, no. [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  The show that really confused me was one that was on this week.  I -- I was switching channels and I saw that, um, America Picks Who You're Gonna Marry show.  
R:  [MN] Oh, I've not seen that.
L:  [LAUGH]  [MN] 
R:  I haven't even heard of that.
L:  Um, it was really strange because it had a girl and her mother and father and her best friend were there [LIPSMACK] and they were questioning five guys to decide who she was gonna marry.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Almost kind of like a Love Connection kinda thing going on there, huh?  [MN] 
L:  Yeah, but, I mean, what were these parents thinking?
R:  I don't really know.  
L:  [MN] 
R:  They used to do it all the time.  [LAUGH]  Right?
L:  Well, yeah, that was arranged marriage but not somebody that you picked off a TV show.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No, no, no.  Well, you know, on the bright side there, um, if her marriage doesn't work out she can always have somebody to blame besides herself.  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's true, that's true.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  Isn't that pitiful? [MN]  
L:  Mhm.
R:  No, I ha- I hadn't seen that one at all.  I hadn't even heard of that one.  [MN] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  I know that, um, I saw the teensy weensiest bit of, um, Joe Millionaire.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  I s- -- I saw, like, one of, I think, one episode of that and that was very, um --
L:  Strange.
R:  That was just strange be- -- I guess, maybe just because I hadn't watched it.  I didn't know what was going on, you know.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  I watched the last episode only because people were talking about it so much I wanted to see [MN] how it was going to end because they did that big commercial with the -- the big twist.
R:  Oh, I -- I have no idea.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  [MN]  They said --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- that there was gonna be a big twist at the end and it's going to turn out different than you expected.  [MN] 
R:  And did it?
L:  No.  [MN] 
R:  Oh, so what was that all about then?  [LAUGH] 
L:  It was wh- -- after he told the girl that, um, he told the girl that he didn't really have money and she said, "Well that's good 'cause I didn't want you to have money anyhow".
R:  Oh, did it -- oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ooh.
L:  [LAUGH]  That was --
R:  Isn't that --
L:  -- sweet.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- isn't that convenient for them?
L:  Yeah, but they didn't --
R:  [MN] 
L:  I mean, if you read in the newspaper, they're not together anyhow.  
R:  Oh, well, I know that, ah, somebo- -- I had somewhere that somebody said something about, ooh, they couldn't wait for, you know, the next [LIPSMACK] -- the next one to come out and I went, hello folks, I don't think we could pull off the whole thing, you know, without, you kn- --
L:  I know, people -- 
R:  -- because --
L:  -- know now that it's a lie though there's one now on that started last night I was reading in the newspaper called The Family [MN] where a family is there and they're all gonna be cut throaty and try to win the million dollars.
R:  I had heard --
L:  -- Against their own --
R:  -- something about this.  There is, like, supposed to be, like, some [LIPSMACK], like, all different kinds of families, even some that are kinda like hicks --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- and some that are like, you know, California families and everything was --
L:  Well, this was a New Jersey family, so they were very -- very sounding like the, ah [MN] -- the, Mafia family.  
R:  Oh, gosh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  No, no, no.
L:  [MN]  But, um, I, you know, going back to the old days, ah, the first reality show I used to watch with my children, The Real World.
R:  Oh, I don't know --
L:  They used to love that on MTV.
R:  Oh, n- -- well, see, I didn't -- I've never really watched MTV.  I mean, not even as a teenager I never really watched M -- [MN] my mother wouldn't let me, so ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah, well, my daughters, when they were teenagers, they watched that, The Real -- The Real World and that was the original --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- the original reality show.
R:  [MN] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I guess it must have done well because look what it has spawned.  [MN] 
R:  [MN]  Well, [MN] they -- they are all over the place, aren't they?
L:  [LAUGH]  I mean, I -- it's very cheap for the TV networks.
R:  [MN]  Well, yeah.  [MN] 
L:  Because it's cost them nothing.
R:  Yeah, I'll do your show for free.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Especially when you look -- look at Friends and how much, you know, they pay their people to do a show.  
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  You know, here, they're getting a whole season's worth out of these people for, you know, very little.
L:  Ahah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Th- there was an article in the paper yesterday and it really was kind of upsetting that they, um, put NYPD Blue on the shelf for the rest of the season --
R:  Oh, you're kidding.
L:  -- because they have this new reality show, The Family, on in its time slot.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Now, I mean that upsets me because I liked NYPD Blue.
R:  [MN]  Well, what about those people who -- who -- that's their job, the NYPD Blue, you know, actors?
L:  Well, I think they've taped the shows.  They just aren't showing them.
R:  [MN] 
L:  I'm sure --
R:  Oh, yeah, but I mean --
L:  -- they'll show them eventually.
R:  Oh, they -- [MN], are they gonna go ahead and let them, you know, tape next season, even though, you know, [LAUGH] --
L:  I'm sure they will.
R:  -- this season hasn't run yet, you know?  [MN]  You know, as long as it doesn't interfere with my job I wouldn't care if they put my show on the shelf but, by golly, if it's caused interruption with my [LAUGH] -- my pay, I'm gonna get ticked, you know.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  [MN] 
L:  It's just, ah, I mean, enough's enough.  [LAUGH]  How many more reality shows can they come up with?
R:  It will eventually die down.  People will get bored.
L:  I hope so.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- I r- -- I believe so.  I really believe so.  [MN]  So ...
L:  'Cause there are a lot of nights when I just don't watch television.  [MN] 
R:  Well, you know, I -- I like to watch, you know, um, you know, the history channels and things like that --
L:  Yeah, that's -- we do that too.
R:  -- and, you know, something different.  [MN]  I'm a game show junkie too.  I like the game show channel.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.  Me too.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I like TV Land and, ah, when TV shows were good.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I watched The Brady Bunch last night, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I felt safe that was something that my four year old could watch with me.  I didn't feel like, you know, was something going to pop up on TV that would be questionable. [MN] 
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Although she does watch Survivor with me.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  She's not asked any questions about that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Doesn't get all scared when they do weird things like eat bugs or things?  [MN] 
R:  No, she goes, "Ooh, gross".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  No, the only --
R:  She's not --
L:  Like I said, my daughter, well, she's twenty seven, [LAUGH] she's not a baby, she loves The Amazing Race.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I hope that, um, her trying out for it goes well for her.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  I don't know if her --
R:  That would be --
L:  A- are you there?
R:  Go ahead.
L:  I was going to say, I d- don't know if her boss will let her take, ah, six weeks off from work or whatever.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- I wonder what these people do.  I mean, do they, you know, is it something that they go to their boss and say, you know, hey, will you let me do this.  And if they say no, do they say, okay, well, I'm gonna do it anyway and, [MN] you know, screw their job, or ...?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I don't know.  Any of the girls that I read about that were in Millionaire or the other one, um, um, The Bachelor [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- they all had, like, jobs that didn't really matter, like substitute teachers and [MN] you know, like jo- --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Maybe they do it when they have no jobs.
R:  I guess.
L:  I --
R:  So, ah --
L:  -- don't even know how they find out how to -- how to sign up for these things.
R:  What area of the country are you in?
L:  I'm in New Jersey.
R:  Oh, you're in -- I was wondering about that 'cause of the way you said that about that one, ah, one show that family being from New Jersey.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Yeah, it's gonna show people the worst of New Jersey, that show.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, well, you know, hey, that's the way it is.  I mean, I- -- I'm in Kentucky and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- [LAUGH] there's lots out there to make us all look like a bunch of idiots --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- and, granted, there's a lot of us that are idiots.
L:  Yeah, my daughter's roommate's from Tennessee, so she sees that too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, we're not all idiots but, you know, those ones out there that, you know, you just want to smack 'em because they're making the name bad for the rest of us.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they make everybody think there's only hayseeds.
R:  Mm.  How did you find out about this study?
L:  On the Internet.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah, I did too.  Cool.
L:  Uh-huh.  [MN]  On a website that, um, [NOISE] that posts things like this.
R:  Cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I'm just curious, you know, ah, I've been reading where people are saying they only got their first phone call but I've not seen where anybody has gotten their second one, so, [LIPSMACK] I'm pretty curious to see.
L:  Well, this is my first.
R:  I- -- mine is my first too.
L:  Oh, okay.  [MN] 
R:  I -- I think our time is probably getting really close to being up.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  I've been watching the clock on my computer, so ... [LIPSMACK]  Well it sure has been a lot of fun and --
L:  Yeah, well, I see that --
R:  -- may- -- may- --
L:  -- I'm -- I'm glad I'm not the only one that really is confused about these shows.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  Well, yeah, exactly, yeah.  No, I -- I have a feeling a lot of people are [MN]-- I imagine --
L:  And who is watching them?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Exactly.  [MN]  Somebody has to be still.  [MN] 
L:  Somebody that has bad, um, whatever it's called, ah, the -- the, ah, thing on their TV, the, um, [LIPSMACK] the families --
R:  The Niel- --
L:  -- that --
R:  The Nielsen rating thing?
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's gotta --
R:  I wonder ho- --
L:  -- be one of them.
R:  I wonder how you get to be one of those families.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- actually, I talked to somebody that they had just got called --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- out of the clear blue sky and they got a lot of money for doing it.
R:  Wow.
L:  But I've never been called.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  No, no, me neither.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I think years ago we did one of the diaries for them but that was all.  We never got the box put on our TV.
R:  Wow.
L:  I would do it.
R:  I -- I don't know anybody who's ever done anything like that, so, it's very, um, strange to me.  I know they're done but, you know --
