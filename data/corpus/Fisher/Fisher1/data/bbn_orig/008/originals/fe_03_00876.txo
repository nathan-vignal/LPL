L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name is Cat.
R:  I'm Lisa.
L:  Nice to meet you.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Nice to meet you too. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Okay.  Ah, I just finished watching, what was it, Happy Gilmore.  
R:  Ah [MN] --
L:  [MN]  Go ahead.
R:  I watched last night Two Can Play at that Game.
L:  What is that about?
R:  [LAUGH]  It's about this woman [MN] that has these rules about what happens when your boyfriend cheats on you and she goes through --
L:  Okay.  [MN] 
R:  -- like a ten day process of what has to be done --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it -- it is hilarious.
L:  Oh, my. 
R:  Ahah.
L:  Did you see it at a theater or did you see it at home?
R:  At home.  I don't go to the theater.
L:  Why not?
R:  Because I smoke and so I'd rather stay at home and watch the movies plus I can pause it if I have to go the bathroom or, you know, something like that then, yeah, I --
L:  Ah, I'm the -- I agree, I'm the same way.  I like to go to a theater, like, once in a blue moon.  Kind of -- it's almost like a special occasion, like going out on a date or something. 
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't really -- I prefer to get a DVD or a -- or a rental or like a [MN] -- just a tape or something and just sit at home.  I can eat what I want to eat --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and -- and watch it.  What kind of movies do you like?
R:  Um, drama, suspense, um -- comedy's okay but I like it, like, every once in a while.  I think some of it's kind of stupid.
L:  I have to be in a certain mood.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.  How many movies do you usually rent at one time or do you rent 'em?
R:  Well, I belong to Netflix on the Internet --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, they send me, like, three movies at once and then on- -- once I finish one I send it back and they send me another one.  So, there is no telling how many I get in a month.
L:  How many wa-  -- how many movies do you watch during a month?
R:  God.  How many movies do I watch during a month?  Probably twenty.  [MN] 
L:  Is that right? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I usually get about three per week --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- something like that, three or four a week, so that's probably about the same.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just got watch-  -- finished watching -- have you seen the Nine One One movie?
R:  Huh-uh.
L:  Yeah, they just -- I don't know if they just got that out.  It's on DVD and I think they have it on videotape too.  It's very good.   It's about --
R:  Is it?
L:  -- you know -- yeah, the World Trade Center International Documentary they did on it --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and they, ah, they started out by actually trying to, um, follow a guy who, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] was -- was going through the process of becoming a firefighter --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and he was stationed -- he ended up being stationed just down the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- street from the World Trade Center and it happened about the -- I don't know, probably about a month and a half into his double documentary.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it kind of got sidetracked into that 'cause they were in the building -- there's actual footing in the building while it was going on.  So --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- it was -- it was intense --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- very intense, but --
R:  I'll have to check that out.
L:  You will, right, I'm telling you.  It -- it -- y- -- you'll cry, you won't laugh much but you'll cry.  It's -- it's pretty wild.  That's probably the best one I've watched lately.
R:  Wow.  [NOISE] 
L:  Um, let's see.  Primal Fear, I saw that a while back. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Trying to remember -- I -- I see so many of them I don't...What have you watched lately, besides what you said last night?
R:  Um -- Fear of dot com.  That was stupid.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, and I've been -- I've been watching, um, that series from HBO, Oz.
L:  Yeah, that's -- I -- I saw that on HBO.  I didn't know they brought it out in a movie.
R:  Ah, actually it's the whole series on DVDs and I'm on the second season, like, the first episode.  So --
L:  Did you --
R:  -- I've been watching those a lot.
L:  Do -- do you like those?  I mean, what do they have, like, two or three on 'em -- on each movie?
R:  Yeah, there's three on each DVD.
L:  Didn't they do that with Sex and the City too? 
R:  I think so.
L:  I think they did.  I think I saw that.
R:  Like with that one I watch one episode one night and then, you know, the next night watch another episode.
L:  Mhm.  We rent from Blockbuster, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I tried to watch The Thornbirds.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is that what it's called?  Have you seen that?
R:  Ah, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  Okay, I only got through, like, two thirds of the first tape but they d -- -- and it wasn't because I wasn't interested.  It was because I fell asleep finally just 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was late at night but, um, there was, ah -- the second video they didn't even have.  So [LAUGH] I'm kind of like [LAUGH] I don't even know if I want to really pursue this too far.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Was it any good?
R:  It's good.  But it's long.  [LAUGH]  I mean --
L:  Was it -- what is it -- like three or four movies?
R:  I think it's four movies.
L:  That's a long, long thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm, mm, mm.  What's you favorite movie?
R:  Um, The Crow.
L:  What is it?
R:  The Crow.  From, like, nineteen eighty.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, that's far.
R:  [LAUGH]  That's like --
L:  I'd follow you there.
R:  That's, like, my favorite movie.
L:  What -- what's it about.  I've never heard of it.
R:  Um, well, it's got, um, Bruce Lee's son in it -- Brandon Lee.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  He died making the movie [LIPSMACK] but it's about this gang --
L:  I remember that.
R:  -- this gang kills his wife and [MN] they kill him too and he comes back -- he comes back from the dead to avenge her death and he goes after these gang members one by one.
L:  Really?
R:  Ah, it's really good.
L:  Is that --
R:  It's like the ultimate love story, I think.
L:  So, it's like an action kind of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you get into the soupy ones?  Like, ah, Ghost and, ah, what was that one that was out lately, the Ya Ya Sister thing --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Ya Ya --
R:  Yeah, I don't like those.
L:  Ya Ya Sisters.
R:  Not all of them.
L:  I have to --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- be in a mood to watch those [LAUGH] kind of [LAUGH] --
R:  Exactly.  And I like drama movies.  I can watch those all the time.  
L:  [MN]  I'm trying to think what else I've watched lately.  I've watched a bunch of 'em.  Primal Fear was pretty good.
R:  Yeah, I think I've seen that.  [MN] 
L:  Ah, Richard Gere.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the kid that was, ah -- he killed the priest and supposedly had, um, like, multiple personality disorder or something of that nature.
R:  Yeah, I think I've seen that.  Sleepers is really good too and that's an older movie.
L:  I haven't -- you know what, I heard that was real good but I never saw it.
R:  And it's exactly like the book.  I read the book and then seen the movie.  And it's exactly the same.
L:  It's hard --
R:  They don't --
L:  -- to find that.
R:  They don't leave nothing out, you know, I mean, it's -- it's really good.  Matter of fact, I have it [MN] on DVD and VHS.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Is that right?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  What is Sleepers about 'cause I know -- I know that I -- I've -- I've seen, like -- I -- I've heard of it but I just -- I don't -- for the life of me, I can't recall what it's even about.
R:  [several inaudible words] They hold this shopping cart that belongs to this g- -- well, n- -- it's a hotdog cart, [several inaudible words] above the subway, just [inaudible] gives the guy who owns it but he can't hold it 'cause it's too heavy and it goes down the sub -- the subway stairs and kills a guy.
L:  Oh, man.
R:  They get sent to juvenile detention.  [MN]  They get raped in juvenile detention.  They get beat, I mean [NOISE] -- 
L:  Mm, mm, mm.  
R:  -- by the guards.
L:  Mhm.
R:  When they finally get out they're so screwed up in the head that a couple of 'em -- one actually is straightened out but [MN] the other two are kind of criminals, you know, small time stuff --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and they -- they -- they're all together at this restaurant.  They find one of the guards that did this to them and they're shooting.
L:  I -- in the --
R:  And they go back to jail.
L:  Oh, man.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's really good though.
L:  Do you think -- do you think that movies, like, really have that much influence on the way the kids act these days?
R:  I don't.
L:  Like, like, they say video games, kind of the same thing but movies as well.
R:  I don't think so.
L:  I don't know that they are any less violent than they were when I was growing up.  I think that it's just one of those things where i- i- it's in the contaxt -- context that it's taken these days.
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I mean I -- it's, like, ah, [MN] we -- we -- I mean, we grew up with a -- with a lot of movies that were very, very -- I don't know, they were explicit.  I mean, we grew up -- well, I grew up with The -- The Godfather.
R:  Right.  Me too.  
L:  [MN] 
R:  And, like, you know, Carrie.
L:  Yes.  That's on tonight as a matter of fact.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know it is.  That's -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  that's why that clicked in my head --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- because I've been seeing it advertised. [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  Ah, did you see The Sh- -- the remake of The Shining?
R:  No, I did not.  I cannot watch the original Shining.
L:  Why?  It's awesome.
R:  I don't know.
L:  [MN] 
R:  [MN]  Yeah.  Every time [MN] I watched it --
L:  Well --
R:  I bought it though.
L:  -- it is very good [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I bought it so I could look at it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, they did a remake of it.  We rented that one and I -- you know, they did it at [inaudible] -- you -- you try not to, like, when they do a remake you really try not to, um, compare it to the original --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but it -- it was very hard not too.  But they added a lotta --
