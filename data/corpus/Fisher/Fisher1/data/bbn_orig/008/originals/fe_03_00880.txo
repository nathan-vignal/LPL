L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name is Sunny.
R:  Hi, Sunny, it's Joe.
L:  Joe, nice to talk with you this evening --
R:  Same here.
L:  -- about movies.
R:  [LAUGH]  Okay.  Ah, what was the last movie I saw?  [MN]  I saw, um, just the other night, I saw a movie called Amen.
L:  Oh, I don't even think I've heard of it.
R:  Yeah, it's about the Holocaust.
L:  Oh, yeah, did you like it?  [NOISE] 
R:  I did.
L:  Really?  Is it a very documentary like movie or --
R:  It -- it was a documentary.
L:  -- did they try to recreate it?  Oh, okay.  I see.  I don't know, what was the last -- was this -- was this in the theater or --
R:  It was in a theater.
L:  -- or did you see it at home?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, okay.  Where are you from?
R:  New York.
L:  Okay.  Is that where you are right now?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.
R:  And you?
L:  Ah, well, I'm originally from Canada but I live in Utah right now.  I'm going to school here.
R:  Really?  I was just in Canada.
L:  Oh, really?  Which part?
R:  Ah, we were in Vancouver.
L:  Okay.  I live in Ontario.
R:  [NOISE]  That's nice.
L:  Yeah.  It is. [MN] 
R:  I would rather see a movie in -- in a theater --
L:  [MN]  Yeah, I would too.
R:  -- if the theater's quiet --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of course.
L:  [MN]  Right.  Yeah, and I would rather see it there too because it's a big screen --
R:  [MN] Right 'cause --
L:  -- good sound system --
R:  then experience -- you experience it with all the other people in the theater.
L:  That's right.  Mhm.  [MN]  Yeah.  The last movie I saw I think was Lord of the Rings.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow.
L:  Oh, not Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers or the -- yeah, Two Towers, mhm.  [MN] 
R:  Which is the newest one.
L:  Yeah, that is the newest one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Mhm.  Ah, yeah, I'm not really a moviegoer or movie --
R:  Oh, I go every week.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  To -- 
R:  A mo- --
L:  Do you have -- go ahead.
R:  -- a movie class, yeah, I go to a movie class.
L:  Oh, really?  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And what do you do?  [MN] 
R:  We watch movies before they come out.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, it's a lot of fun.
L:  That's neat.  Wha -- what is it for?  Is this [MN] --
R:  It's -- it's a group of teachers.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And, um, I'm not a teacher but [MN] --
L:  You're part of the group.
R:  I pay -- I pay a fee for the semester and I go, ah, I see about twenty, twenty five, thirty films a year that way.
L:  Huh.  And do you get to see them at a discounted price?
R:  Ah, it's not -- yeah, it's less than what you would pay in a regular theater but not much less.
L:  Oh, really, ho- --
R:  But the idea is everybody that -- that's watching the movie wants to be there.
L:  Right.
R:  So, you don't get the people talking on their cell phones --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or, ah, rowdy kids.
L:  Yeah, but I've never been to the theater where someone talked on their cell phone during a movie.
R:  Oh, you'd be surprised.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah and, ah --
L:  That's ridiculous.
R:  I'm sorry?  It is, it certainly is.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  But th- then again, you know, they're -- maybe they're much more courteous in Utah.
L:  [LAUGH] They might be.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know.  Yeah.  I -- my biggest problem with going to see movies though is the price.  It seems like a lot of money and if I were to do it every week it would be kind of expensive I think [MN] so that's why I enjoy going to the dollar theater and just waiting a few months until it comes to the theater --
R:  Now they have a thing --
L:  -- for a dollar.
R:  -- now they have a thing if you like to watch movies you can d- -- ah, rent them on line.  Like a Netflix.  I don't know if you ever heard of that?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  Yeah, it's a, um, a website where you sign up and make a list and for twenty dollars a month you can see as many movies as -- you can -- as -- th- they send you three at a time and then you send one back, they send you another one.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, you make your list on line and they --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- they send it to you right from the top of your list.  So, if you always have one in the mail you're getting movies every couple of days.  DVDs.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, DVDS, and they're prepaid mailers and you drop it in the mailbox and they mail -- mail you another one.
L:  And -- and what is the website?
R:  Netflix dot com.
L:  Netflix -- hm.
R:  And you know who else does it now?  Ah, Wal-Mart.  At --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- Wal-Mart -- Wal-Mart dot com.  [MN]  And they're a couple of dollars cheaper.
L:  Ahah.  Gee whiz.  Well, that's good to know.
R:  Yeah, I -- I'm just a fountain of information tonight.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah, it's good to talk to you.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, same here.
L:  Yeah, I -- I know that I've heard of Cleanflicks where they take R rated movies and edit them --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- which --
R:  That I haven't heard of.
L:  Yes.
R:  Half the fun of watching an R movie is so they don't clean 'em up.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I think it's kind of silly too, if you want to know the truth.
R:  I don't understand that.  I must -- again --
L:  Because --
R:  -- you live in Utah.  I mean [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, exactly.  I think if there's only --
R:  Are you a Mormon?
L:  Yes, I am.
R:  Oh, there you go.
L:  Mhm.  [MN]  Yeah, the thing with the Cleanflicks, they can't take out, like, I don't think they actually take out -- maybe they can take out scenes --
R:  Oh, but they -- they just clean them up --
L:  -- but they --
R:  -- they clean up the --
L:  Yeah, they take out some --
R:  -- dialogue?
L:  Yeah, but the thing with the dialogue, all they can do is really make it quiet so you can still see what they're saying --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and know exactly what they're doing.
R:  Yeah, right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, I just think it's silly that people just want to be a part of it and yet they don't want to watch an R movie so they think they're renting a Cleanflick that they're somehow saving themselves.  
R:  That's interesting.
L:  But anyway ...
R:  That's interesting.
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  How long are we supposed to talk?
L:  I think we're supposed to talk until that recording comes back on and says, "This is the end of your call" and --
R:  Oh, I -- I haven't -- this is the first, ah, one that I've actually gotten to.  I d- --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- keep losing my PIN.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Well, [MN].
L:  Yeah, this -- go ahead.
R:  Go ahead.  I'm -- I'm sorry.
L:  Oh, I was gonna say, this is my first phone call too [MN] but my friend is also doing this and he had -- he has received a call and in -- in order to receive your ten dollars you have to wait until they finish the phone call.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I'm enjoying it so it -- it can't be bad.
L:  That's right.  Absolutely not.  Yeah, so, how --
R:  Is it the content or the linguistics?
L:  [MN]  I think it's the linguistics [MN] and --
R:  Could you hold on a second?  
L:  Yes.
R:  Yes, yes.  I'm on the phone, tell her.  Amanda.  [NOISE]  Yes, I'm on the phone.  [NOISE]  Yeah, I think I did, I don't know if I did.  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, sorry.
L:  That's fine.  No problem.  So, how did you hear about this program?
R:  I -- I think it was on -- I was on line s- surfing around --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and, um, you know, it came up.  [MN]  It wasn't a pop up, it was, ah, through one of these, ah, ah, sites --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, [MN]  like a -- that tells you about deals [MN] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and discounts and stuff.
L:  Ahah.
R:  And, um, you wanna make ten dollars, I said, sure, why not.
L:  Yeah, absolutely, I think it's a great idea.
R:  Has somebody else gotten paid?  Has your friend gotten paid yet?
L:  No, not that I know of because it was just earlier this week in fact, so ...
R:  Ahah.  Well, we'll see what happens.
L:  Yeah, we will see, mhm.
R:  You know, being -- being from the big city I'm a little skeptical.
L:  [LAUGH] Of course.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah, so, is -- are you a teacher then?
R:  No, I'm not.  No --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I'm -- I -- I'm a salesman.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And you --
L:  Gotcha. 
R:  -- what do you do?  Housewife?
L:  [MN]  Pardon me?
R:  What do you do?
L:  [MN]  Oh, I'm still in school, in university.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just, ah, finishing up this year in fact, this April.
R:  Where do you go?
L:  [MN]  Ah, Brigham Young University.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You gonna go back to Ottawa after you finish?
L:  [MN]  No, no, I'm actually going to go to Japan for a year --
R:  Oh, that's interesting.
L:  -- and -- and teach English over there for -- for a year.
R:  Is that part of your program you're in?
L:  [MN]  No.
R:  Or is it --
L:  No, not at all.  I'm graduating in English and I have a minor in TESOL and, so, just from classes I've taken for my minor it just sounds like an interesting thing to do and I live --
R:  You've already signed up?
L:  Yes, I have.  Mhm.  [MN]  There's a few different companies but we haven't heard back from any of them with for sure go aheads, so ...
R:  Mhm.  Are you going with -- with people from -- friends?
L:  Well, actually, I'm -- I'm also getting married in May and we're going to go together.
R:  Ooh.  Very nice.
L:  Yes.  It will be very , very nice.
R:  Very nice.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then back to Ottawa or back to Utah?
L:  [MN]  Um, probably -- probably neither of those.  We'll probably, ah, go to graduate school somewhere --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then from there we're really not sure.
R:  Very interesting.  What drove you to -- to, um, Brigham Young?
L:  [MN] Um, well, basically, [LIPSMACK] I come from a very small town in -- in Ontario --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and there aren't very many other LDS people there and so I thought it would be kind of fun to --
R:  LDS meaning?
L:  Oh, that's, ah, another way to describe a Mormon.
R:  Oh, Latter Day Saints.
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, sorry.
L:  Oh, no, you're fine.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, and as a matter of fact I don't know -- are you familiar --
R:  No, I'm Jewish.
L:  Oh.  Oh --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, well, great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um.
R:  [MN]  But that's -- that's, ah -- no, we had -- we had just been in September to Hawaii --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and there's a -- a very large presence --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- on, ah, on, ah, Oahu.
L:  Yeah, at the Polynesian Cultural Center?
R:  Right, and the whole -- the whole -- the school there?
L:  Yeah, yeah, UA Hawaii
R:  It was --
