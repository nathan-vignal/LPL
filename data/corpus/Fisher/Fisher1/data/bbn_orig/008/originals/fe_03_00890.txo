R:  Hi, this is Dawn.
L:  I'm sorry.  It's who?
R:  Hi.  Dawn.
L:  Hi, Dawn.  This is Susan.  How're you?
R:  Good.  How're you, Susan? [MN] 
L:  Doing pretty good.  Where are you from?
R:  Um, from Connecticut.  
L:  [MN] 
R:  How about you?
L:  I can tell right away it wasn't from here.  I'm from, ah, New Orleans.
R:  Oh, I could tell that too.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, down near New Orleans. [LAUGH] 
R:  H- have you ever done these calls before?
L:  No, this is the first one.  Have you?
R:  No, it's -- it's my first too.
L:  Okay.  Well, good, do you watch reality TV?
R:  Yes, I'm a sucker for reality TV.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, good, one of us will know something about it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  You haven't watched any of 'em?
L:  Well, I've watched a little bit but I don't watch a lot of TV anyway --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- so, so, I really don't know all that much about very many.  I remember the first Survivor.
R:  Yes, that's the one my sister in law used to watch --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and she'd tell me all about it every week.
L:  Right, I missed the beginning of it too and it was my sister in law that told me too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, that's so funny.
L:  Ahah.  
R:  And --
L:  [MN]  Oh, yeah, she was a sucker for it.  She was just talking about it all of the time so --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I caught some of the end.
R:  Well, what happened was then the -- the following year [LIPSMACK] she got me into starting to watch the first one.
L:  Ahah.
R:  So, I -- I definitely -- I followed it every week --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and we had something to talk about and it was --
L:  Right.
R:  -- funny.
L:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yeah.
L:  They are funny.  I mean, it's something that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you kn- -- like the question --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- says, "Why do you think they're so popular?"  I -- I don't know.  Wh- why are they?  [MN] 
R:  Well I -- I guess because it's non scripted TV that we're watching and--
L:  I think it's -- I think it's because the scripted TV's gotten so stupid.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Maybe that's it.
L:  You know, I was watching the, ah, one of the sitcoms the other night [LIPSMACK] and people don't act like that.
R:  No.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, you're right.
L:  They were ju- -- it was -- it was My Big Fat Greek Wife.  But, I mean, it was -- everything was a little one liner and people -- that the little laugh track would go and I didn't think it was funny and people don't really act that way so [MN] [LIPSMACK] I guess people have gone to reality TV because that's really how people act.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I would have liked to try to watch that but I was probably watching some other reality TV.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, what are they now?  Which ones are on?
R:  [COUGH]  Well, there's still Survivor which --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- I started watching.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then I'm sure you've heard about Joe Millionaire.
L:  Right, I watched the -- a few of those.  What happened when they found out he wasn't a millionaire?
R:  Well, that's [NOISE] -- that's where it was funny.  [NOISE]  That's why we watched it all season.
L:  Right, well, I -- I watched enough to f- -- to know that I wanted to watch that one and I missed it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, they were all pretty surprised to hear that.  But, in the end --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- he ended up getting a half a million dollars anyway, which was a surprise to him.
L:  Oh, he didn't know he was gonna get that?
R:  No, and the girl he picked.  But, from what I hear now from the news they're not together anyway.
L:  [MN] 
R:  So, it wasn't to get married --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or to get engaged --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or any of that, so it was --
L:  I saw her on something else and she looked pretty neat.  I mean, she looked like she was pretty down to earth.
R:  Yeah, I think that's why he liked her.
L:  Ahah.
R:  You know, he picked her because --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- if he [NOISE] -- if he was a millionaire she wouldn't be going after him for his money.
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  And -- and he was pretty down to earth obviously because [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- he had to be.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, a construction worker, I would guess so.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  But what happened was though, they both live on different coasts and they're not going to get together --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but it was fun to watch.
L:  Right.
R:  But there are some out there now that are absolutely ridiculous.  
L:  Right.
R:  Like Married By America.  I tried --
L:  Now, I saw the first maybe five minutes of that and I went, "Yow, right", and -- and switched off.  I mean that was silly.
R:  Now there's something with the same format, American --
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Those people really are going to be married or [MN] ...?
R:  I suppose, or they're gonna supposedly live together --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and see if they wanna get married --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I don't think I'm giving that one another chance.
L:  Right.
R:  Um --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- there's something with the same format like the American Idol.  That I enjoy because it's people --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- singing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and the judges tell them what they think --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they eliminate them.
L:  Right, there's some talent to that.  [MN]  My husband's a recording engineer and [MN] in the very beginning of those when they had all the people that were so terrible coming on singing --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and they didn't know they were so terrible.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, they really thought they were good, [MN] he could really relate to that because he had people come in his studio to record [MN] that were horrible --
R:  Oh, so --
L:  -- and, I mean, they would listen to themselves and still think they were good.
R:  Oh, my, so, I thought this was maybe an act.
L:  No, he says --
R:  But they are that bad?
L:  -- there are people like that.  And I say, well, you know, those people have obviously never heard themselves, like, on tape and Steve says, "No".  He has heard people, he's recorded them and played it back to them and they still think it's good.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So [LAUGH] he goes --
R:  Well, it's pretty --
L:  -- "Their ear's just wrong".
R:  -- it's pretty interesting to watch that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I guess -- I guess they're trying to follow the same format with three judges --
L:  Right.
R:  -- with that Married By America and it just -- to me it was terrible.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I found no reason to want to watch it again --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I am watching [MN] all the others.
L:  I was thinking, yeah, I was thinking that that might -- if they had taken the format like the old Dating Game ... those were a kick, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  And they -- I saw a, um, a special about that the other day and all the celebrities that had started out there before anyone knew who they were [MN] and that was pretty funny, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when you saw ...
R:  -- and the Newlywed Game, that used to be funny.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Of course, if those were on now, they wouldn't go over.  We're --
R:  Well, that's --
L:  -- way too sophisticated for that. [MN] 
R:  I read an article about reality TV just today and it's funny that I should get this subject to talk to you about.
L:  [LAUGH] Really.
R:  But they said they were going to try to bring back the Dating Game and the Newly G- -- the Newlywed Game.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  But they were gonna -- they were gonna have to update them but --
L:  Oh, sure they are.
R:  -- they were gonna try to keep the same -- same format in a way. 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  [MN]  Well, they've stolen that format for so many other game shows.  It's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I was -- I saw one that, [LIPSMACK] let's see, Street Smarts, I think.  [MN]  That's a lot like some of the ones that I -- you know, they have three people on the, ah, street and they ask them a question and you have to choose which one you think is gonna be right.
R:  Oh, that sounds --
L:  It's a --
R:  -- interesting.
L:  Yeah, it's -- that one's not -- I actually kinda get a kick out of that one because it's -- it's almost like reality TV in that they just find people in the street [MN] and talk to 'em.  
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  And, so, there's nothing scripted about their answers.  The only problem with it is that some of these people are really pretty stupid.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I -- I feel sorry for 'em when they put that on national TV.  I mean, they're asking 'em something like, [MN] you know, I don't know wh- -- just some question about, you know, where is North Dakota or whatever and these people don't know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, so you feel sorry for them.
L:  You do, but they're -- they kind of jive their answers sometimes and, like, they know they don't know and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's okay.  [MN] 
R:  And I guess there's -- there's certain -- I don't know if you would call 'em reality TV exactly but things like Candid Camera.
L:  Right.
R:  I like those.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, where they -- or videotapes like Real TV --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- or --
L:  Right.
R:  Funniest Videos.  Those are kind of funny.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  And again, it's unscripted --
L:  Ahah.
R:  You know, I don't care for the whole s- --
L:  Some of those The Funniest Videos are the funniest -- the pets' one.  I can turn those on, like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in the middle of the night I wake up and I can't go back to sleep.  No sound or anything and just watch it, and that's funny because it's real people.
R:  Right.
L:  Whereas if I turned on a TV show you'd have to listen to the sound because you have no idea what's really going on.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, you have to follow it.
L:  You have to follow a-- a story line.
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  And maybe that's the other thing about the reality TV.  There's -- I mean, there's not really a story line.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  That's it, maybe.
L:  Although, I am really curious, since you've watched all the Survivors, what's the deal with the tribes?  Why do they feel like they have to get in tribes?
R:  I -- that I don't know but this -- this year they did men versus women.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  And they decided that might work.  I -- I --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- missed maybe one or two of these.
L:  Ahah.
R:  Um.
L:  Well, I saw the wo- -- the first woman that -- that was voted off or whatever [COUGH] on Letterman [MN] and she said that was a really stupid idea.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Maybe -- maybe it was.
L:  Because men are just naturally stronger than women so where they were that was a real advantage, plus the women apparently got really bitchy toward each other [LAUGH], so ...
R:  Yeah, but the women were winning.
L:  Were they?
R:  That's the whole thing.
L:  Ah, okay.
R:  Unexpectedly they were winning.  So --
L:  [MN]  Well, this woman sounded like she had some sour grapes going too, being the first one asked to leave, you know.
R:  I think that's a lot of what America -- when people want to watch these shows do, they wanna see conflict --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, there was -- there was another one, High School Reunion.  I vowed this year I'm gonna try them all, so --
L:  I didn't see High -- I did not hear about High School Reunion.
R:  [COUGH]  Well, that one, again, they took, like, several, I don't know how many, ten people who graduated ten years ago, threw 'em in a house together, so naturally --
L:  Oh, Lord.
R:  -- some of the old --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] you know, rivalry comes out --
L:  Sure.
R:  So, I guess people wanna just watch this.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah, I had kinda forgotten about the ones they threw in houses together and made 'em stay.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I never watched the others like Big Brother or any of those.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's -- there's only so much time.  There seem to be so many of 'em these days.
L:  There are.  You know, now that you're saying it and there's the one where they doing that road race thing.
R:  That was interesting.  Amazing Race.
L:  Ahah.
R:  Is that what you're talking about?
L:  Ahah.
R:  Now, that was nice because they had to go around the world, catch planes, cla- -- 
L:  Right.
R:  --catch trains --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and get to a destination --
L:  Right.
R:  -- before --
L:  They had something to do.  There was a reason for them to be together to do something [NOISE] and ...
R:  Right.  That was kind of like a game just spread out --
L:  Yeah, that was the one that I saw and one time, I think they were in Rome or something and I was going, "Ooh, I wanna get picked for this one".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it looked like --
L:  I wanna go around the world.
R:  At least they get to see a lot of different things --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know.  So, it -- it -- but, it seems to me there is just ...
L:  Well, I heard about one that, um, th- --I don't know that it's even gonna air.  I can't remember what network it was supposed to be.  Sci Fi I think, or something like that anyway that was gonna do a reality show that it was supposed to scare you to death.
R:  Oh, boy.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And that was the name of it or something.  Well, they took a person out in -- on a car ride in the desert [LIPSMACK] and they faked like they had car trouble and they got out and were attacked by aliens.
R:  Oh --
L:  [MN] 
R:  I think I saw some -- some little clip of that.
L:  Yeah, well, she sued 'em because she had, like, a seizure or something.
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, no.
L:  Oh, no, it wasn't a seizure.  That's the -- the people in the airplane.  She had, anyway, she had some kind of a problem, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] but she was running, or he, I don't even know if it was a he or a she, [MN] was running away, thinking that these really were aliens.
R:  Oh, now, come on.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And they, I mean, you know, you kinda gotta stop, but the person who was doing --
