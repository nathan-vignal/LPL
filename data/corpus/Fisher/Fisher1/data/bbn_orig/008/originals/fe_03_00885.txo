R:  Hi, I'm Pat.
L:  Hi, I'm Debbie.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Nice to meet you, Debbie.
L:  It's nice to meet you.
R:  Thank you.  I guess we're t- to discuss reality shows.
L:  Ye- -- they said we could discuss reality shows or anything we wanted to.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, okay.
L:  So ...
R:  Well, reality shows is fine with me if that's --
L:  That's fine.  Whatever.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- fine with you.  Okay.  Go ahead.
L:  Um.
R:  You wanna start?
L:  Sure.  I watch Survivor occasionally, um, and I do watch the Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire show.  [MN]  I guess the reason why is because [LIPSMACK] you never know what the outcome is going to be.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Okay.  [MN]  I, um, never watch Survivor.  Ah, with some of the other ones like The Bachelor Bachelorette, I only tuned in to the last show just because I wanted to be able to converse with everyone [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- the next day at work because everyone else watched them.  Um, I don't enjoy shows like that.  My sister loves it.  As a matter of fact, my daughter goes over every Thursday night --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and they both watch that Survivor.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But I just, I don't know, too busy doing other stuff that ...
L:  Well, I should be busy doing other stuff but I think once you kind of get hooked on it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then you have to watch it week to week --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to know what's going on.  And one reason why I like to watch Survivor is to see the country.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, the settings where they're putting them and, you know --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- the environment and everything.  That's, you know, one of the reasons that I guess -- the other shows I don't have to sit there and really concentrate --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on them either.
R:  Mhm.  [MN] 
L:  You know, you can just kinda --
R:  Just hear the lull of the noise behind you and --
L:  Yeah.  You know --
R:  -- work on other things.
L:  Yeah, I can be doing other things and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whatever.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Have you -- have you watched the new one, ah, Family, or is that even on yet?  Where a family lives together and they're all vying for a million dollars?
L:  Oh, that was on last night.
R:  Was it?  Did you see it?
L:  [MN]  Um, I was -- like I said, I was doing other things.  I was [MN] doing some paper work and, kind of, you know, half tuned in and half not.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  It looks kinda stupid.
R:  Mhm.  [MN] 
L:  I mean, I just [LAUGH] ...
R:  Yeah, that's what the commercials kind of look like too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and there was another one that was supposed to start, um, where America picks who --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- gets married.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is it --
L:  Yeah, and I'm not impressed with that either because I don't like the whole philosophy of that one.
R:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK]  Well, that was like with Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire.
L:  Oh, true.
R:  You know, that was k- -- but that I think was one of the first reality shows that were on.
L:  Yeah, and look what happened in the end.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Everything bombed.
R:  Right.
L:  And most of them have 'cause I was reading in one of the magazines that most of them have bombed out.
R:  Right.  Um, what's that one -- that Aaron, the banker bachelor Who Wants to Marry a -- or The Bachelor, him and her aren't even together.
L:  No, no, they're not.
R:  And, ah, neither is that, um, Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire.
L:  No, but I didn't think they would.  They didn't look like they were gonna get together anyway 'cause they were both -- she was too standoffish to me.
R:  Yeah, well, what -- what did he even pick her for?  I mean, that didn't even make sense.  Why would he ...?
L:  'Cause I think she was more [MN] down to earth than the other girls were.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I think --
R:  Well, I guess he had a different criteria he was looking for.
L:  [MN]  I think he was looking for somebody with his status.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Not somebody that wanted him for his money.
R:  Oh, okay.  That was her?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, she still came out half a million --
L:  Yeah, really.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'd have done it for that.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, really.  I mean you know, you go away, someone's waiting on you hand and foot [MN] and after six weeks or whatever it is you get half a million dollars.
L:  I can handle that.
R:  Right.  That's what -- [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean --
R:  I think that's why they have -- they don't, um -- they don't need to go looking for contestants because most people, you know, for that kind of money or even the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the thought of that ...
L:  Yeah, but that was a surprise ending and nobody knew that.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, well that's true.  That's [several inaudible words] something.
L:  Can I ask you a question that's a personal --
R:  Mhm.
L:  What state are you in?
R:  Pennsylvania.
L:  I knew it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Why?
L:  Because of your accent.
R:  Oh, my accent.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ahah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I can always pick out a person from Pennsylvania.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I'm in Florida.
R:  Oh --
L:  I was born --
R:  -- really?
L:  Yeah.  I was born in Pennsylvania.
R:  What part?
L:  Newcastle.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I work with several people from Newcastle.
L:  Oh, really?  Then you must be around that area?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  They -- they drive into Pittsburgh to --
L:  Oh, you're in Pittsburgh?
R:  Well, they're nurses --
L:  Oh.  Oh. 
R:  -- so they drive into Allegheny General.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, what part of Florida?
L:  Orlando.
R:  Oh.  [MN]  Is there any other?
L:  No.  [MN]  I wish there were.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Trust me.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Do you work at Disney, or ...?
L:  No, uh-uh.  
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
L:  Um, no --
R:  [MN].
L:  -- do not have a thing to do with Disney, no.
R:  That makes you happy or ...?
L:  [SIGH]  I wish Disney wasn't here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, there's too much congestion --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with roads --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the traffic --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- the whole bit.
R:  I know.  We go down to Disney practically every year, once a year.
L:  Do you?
R:  Mhm.  My husband just loves the whole --
L:  The whole thing, huh?
R:  -- the whole thing.  Well, he -- I think it, to him, that's like a country club setting.  [MN]  You know, we stay at the ni- -- we're fortunate enough to stay at the nicer hotels or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the -- you know, we stay at the, um, well last time we were down we stayed at the Wilderness Lodge and --
L:  Mm.
R:  We've been at the Cantabrian[?] and the -- and the Polynesian and all the rest of them.  So, to him, this is like a -- a country club --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- getaway.
L:  Well, I guess it would be if -- if we didn't live here it would be fun to come and visit.
R:  Right, right.
L:  But I don't know how when you've -- I don't know whether you drive or fly but -- do you fly in?
R:  [MN] We flew in this last time.  Normally we take the Autotrain from Virginia.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  That's wonderful.
L:  Is it?
R:  We make it part of our trip --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, the countryside's absolutely beautiful --
L:  Yeah.
R:  We don't have to worry about driving.  We don't have to worry about what the weather is.
L:  Right.
R:  We just drive to Virginia, jump on the train and [MN] -- and we always get a sleeper car too.  I can't [MN], um -- th- there's just no room when you're in just the, um --
L:  No, no.  [MN]  What -- what I was going to say is, we live right by the airport.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, all the tourists have to come by our -- almost by our house, if that makes sense.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, like three blocks away --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- and, you know, they're all, you know, one hand on the map and one hand on the steering wheel --
R:  Right.
L:  -- one eye on the map and one eye on the steering wheel, you know, on the road.  And it's like, oh Lord.
R:  Well, what took you to Florida?
L:  My parents moved here forty -- forty eight years ago.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So --
R:  I was gonna say 'cause that's -- unless it's a job, most people --
L:  No.
R:  -- who live in Pittsburgh never leave Pittsburgh.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, my parents were, like I said, born, and I was born in Newcastle and they moved here in fifty eight -- fifty ei- -- yeah.
R:  Well, they're more in the minority.  I mean, if you ask anyone --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or even ask your parents, they'll probably tell you that once [MN] -- people in Pittsburgh just don't leave.
L:  Really?
R:  I mean, they just -- oh yes, they just -- [MN] now, the younger ones --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- are starting to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but my generation, we've just, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you're here and you live here and --
L:  You stay there.
R:  -- you just stay there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, that's kind of weird, that's why I asked.  I mean, I thought maybe your husband's job or --
L:  No.
R:  -- something else --
L:  Mhm.  No.
R:  -- took you down there because, ah --
L:  [LIPSMACK]  You know, I had a cousin up in -- well, she lived outside of Newcastle, that worked in a hospital and I can't for the life of me remember which one it was.
R:  Well, they have some hospitals up there [MN], um, but, um, I think we -- Allegheny General is probably a little bit higher paid.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes.
L:  [MN]  Well, she was in a --
R:  [MN]  Only 'cause it's in inner city.
L:  Oh, argh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, we get a lot of stuff but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what are you going to do?
L:  Yeah, I'm sure you do.
R:  You know, it's, ah -- but, yes, they, um -- they do travel.  It's a good, probably, hour for most people.
L:  Really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Wow.
R:  I c- -- you know, if I have to drive more than fifteen minutes for work then forget it.  I don't work there.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Me too.  No.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't like to drive all that much, so I [MN] -- you know, for me it is only about fifteen twenty minutes into Allegheny so it's not bad at all for me.
L:  Oh, that's -- no, mhm.  
R:  I can't even imagine these people that drive that far.  I --
L:  No I can't either.  Well --
R:  It seems too hard.  Well, I guess you almost -- though, I guess down there you almost have to jump -- but you have all those interstates to jump on.
L:  Yeah, well, that's what I was going to say.  My husband works twenty six miles away --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a- -- and he has to drive on the interstate every day.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And it's like, you know, forty five minutes.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I mean, it's ridiculous --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, oh, well --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- you know, you go where your job is too.
R:  Right, right, absolutely.
L:  So, you know, if your j- -- your job moves and, you know, you have to move also.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm. 
L:  So ...
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, it was nice talking with you and we kind of veered off --
L:  Well, I think they -- they tell us when our ten minutes are up.
R:  Oh, do they?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  See, I've never -- okay, 'cause I was kinda like this was -- [MN] this is my second call but --
L:  Is it really?
R:  Yes.
L:  They must be having trouble getting people.
R:  Why?
L:  I don't know.  Because they called -- [MN] I had my daughter's baby yesterday and they kept calling and calling and I knew I couldn't take ten minutes out of my sched- -- you know.
R:  Ahah.
L:  And they kept calling and calling and calling and calling and calling.  [LIPSMACK]  They must have called five times yesterday.
R:  Well, you know what?  They have been calling me for two weeks.  They have called me five ten times a day --
L:  Yeah.
R:  As a matter of fact, my husband said, "What the heck?"  And -- and meanwhile I forgot all about it.  I must have [MN] signed up a while ago and just --
L:  See, I didn't sign up until like a week ago and they called me yesterday --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- to verify and then they called me again today.  I mean, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then those calls started yesterday so that's why I was wondering if they're having -- and I'm hoping, I hate to be rude, but hoping this is legitimate.
R:  Well, I think it is.  I'll tell you why.  I went on their website.
L:  Did you?
R:  Yes, and it is through the, like, it has, ah, University of Pittsburgh and it ha- --
L:  Okay.
R:  I think it's a G.O.V. or something --
