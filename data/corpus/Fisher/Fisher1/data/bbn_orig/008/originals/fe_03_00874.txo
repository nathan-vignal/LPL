R:  [MN]  Hi, I'm Joshua.
L:  Hi, I'm Brita.
R:  [MN] I'm sorry, what was your name?
L:  Um, Brita.
R:  +Brita?  Nice to mee- --
L:  It's like Rita with a B.
R:  Oh, [MN] okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, ah --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- are you in favor of affirmative action?  [MN] 
L:  [MN]  You know, um, [MN] it's really not a yes or no for me.  It's kind of -- I guess to some extent yeah --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- but a lot of times, ah, it gets mistaken as a quota system.
R:  Yeah, exactly, so -- that's basic -- [MN] oh, well, is it -- so there's quota systems but then there's also things where, for instance, um, sometimes, you know, there's -- there's one thing -- there's lots of [MN] -- well, there's lots of kinds of affirmative action, right.  There's when people, um, [LIPSMACK] just try to do more recruiting.
L:  Ahah.
R:  You know, you try to -- you just -- you just work extra hard to find qualified candidates and th- --
L:  Ahah.
R:  [MN] And then there's times which sounds fine and then there's things like [MN] -- especially I'm a -- I'm a computer programmer and I've seen lots of, um, [LIPSMACK] internship programs and things for, like, [MN] they have affirmative action for students --
L:  Ahah.
R:  To try [NOISE] -- to try to get people later which -- which seems OK.
L:  And I think that's great, yeah. 
R:  But then --
L:  I think that's [inaudible].
R:  -- but then I've also seen things, like, in fire departments or wherever, where [MN] like, they'll have a test and you have to score, you know, twenty points less, ah --
L:  Less?
R:  -- like, like, y- -- you know, there so- -- for, like, some public things they'll have a test that you take [MN] and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and if you're of a certain race or whatever then you can score -- you can get a lower score and still get in.
L:  Oh.  
R:  And that -- that doesn't seem right.
L:  Yeah, that I don't think is -- I don't agree on that.  But if I were in a situation where I lost a job to somebody who was exact same score as me, the exact same, um, qualifications as [NOISE] me, um, yeah, then I would be fine with it.
R:  If -- you mean if loss was just as a tiebreaker and nothing else?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]  Yeah, sometimes -- s- -- I've -- I've seen cases where people claim it's a tiebreaker but then it's not really.
L:  Yeah, I guess that's a good point, tiebreaker.
R:  Ah, you kn- -- if --
L:  Yeah, but it -- it doesn't really work out like that, right?  Most of the time.
R:  [MN] Oh, no, I think it -- I think it was the University of Michigan.  That's not really in hiring but still, um, claim that they had -- they have a -- a score based system and they were adding like ten or twenty points and they claimed it was a tiebreaker except it was ten or twenty points.  I mean it was --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- on a -- um, I d- -- I can't remember what the number was. 
L:  [NOISE]  
R:  [LIPSMACK] Like, sometimes people say it's a tiebreaker but it isn't really.
L:  Okay. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think at the same time I just -- I mean, I'm white -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I just get sick of going to universities here -- going here and there and just seeing mostly white people and I know it's not -- I know it's a lot of times maybe other people aren't being able to go to these universities, for example, because, ah, maybe because they just don't have opportunities like a lot of white Americans do.
R:  [MN]  Um, yeah, well, well, I -- I'm -- at -- at -- the university level I'm -- I'm in favor of, ah, [MN] well, I mean, we -- I'd consider affirmative action but -- but there are issues with race.  For instance, I had a coworker who --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- who married a Mexic- [MN] -- who married a woman whose mother was Mexican --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and so he -- and he's very well off and very -- and -- and reasonably well educated and stuff but his children will count as Hispanic --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- um, even though, you kn- -- they will be one quarter Hispanic and he's actually [MN], yeah, ah [MN] --
L:  Yeah, okay, well --
R:  -- they're not in the least disadvantaged.
L:  -- in that -- in that, yeah, in that situation, no.  But I guess they can't really take and look at case by case situation, right?
R:  Well, sure they can.
L:  You think they can?  'Cause if they could that would be better.
R:  Well, I -- I mean there are other -- there are other things like parental education.  Right?  So people whose parents -- okay, you can ask people whether their parents went to college and what their parents' income was [MN] --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and those kind of things are probably better indicators of -- of whether you come from a disadvantaged background [MN] than -- than what your race is.
L:  Yeah, that's true, so maybe they could do something [MN] instead of maybe making it affirmative action, um, as far as race, maybe socioeconomic status, I don't know.  I don't know if that would work but maybe that'd be more close to what we're trying to get.
R:  Certainly it seems more fair.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Ah, um, that's a little hard to do at the -- at the business [inaudible] -- like in college it sort of makes some sense but then, like, once you [MN], you know, if you [MN]  -- [MN] by the time you're out into the business world asking -- asking [MN] ques- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- somebody about their parents' socioeconomic level starting to seem a little odd.
L:  That's true, that's true.  But, um, huh, it's kind of a tricky situation.  [MN]  Um, hm.
R:  [MN] It's a little weird for me.  We, ah, where I work -- sorry, a- -- as I say, I'm a computer programmer and it's a little odd there's -- there's very few anything but white and Asian males.
L:  Do you think there's very few that are non white?
R:  There, well, there's Asian male -- there's Asian man and white man and maybe the occasional Indian man but, you kn- -- black men no, Hispanic men no, women no.  [MN]  Ah --
L:  Really?
R:  Ah, not in the --
L:  How many --
R:  -- computer --
L:  How many -- how many employees?
R:  [MN]  Oh, I mean, it -- you know, it's not that there's zero in the company but just, ah, you know, on my, um -- in my, see, in my division I know there are no black people --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ah --
L:  And how large is that?
R:  That's about four hundred people.
L:  Four hundred people?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And there's no blacks at all? 
R:  None.  [MN] 
L:  Wh- -- where -- what part of the country is this?
R:  Ah, it's -- it's in, ah, it's in Seattle.  It's [MN]  -- it's not --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- a particularly -- it's not a particularly diverse area to start with but, ah, you'd think -- you'd think there'd be some.  I mean, we -- we recruit from a-- all over the country, so --
L:  [MN] 
R:  Ah --
L:  Yeah, the funny thing is I'm -- I'm actually from Seattle too. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um [LAUGH], interesting [MN], but, um, [MN] and the strange thing is I had a really good friend who did work at an Internet company --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and they made a conscious effort I guess.  I don't know --
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  if they -- I --
R:  -- if somebody -- if somebody works hard at it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they -- they work very hard to try to -- to recruit.  Ah, it's just very hard, ah ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're -- they're, um, ah, they -- among other things they have some -- some -- some -- some inter- -- I think they try to get interns and things [MN] too who are, you know, from -- from different backgrounds, but, ah, [MN] but for whatever reason there aren't -- there aren't a lot [MN].
L:  For whatever reason, what was that?  [NOISE] 
R:  For  -- for whatever reason there -- there just aren't a lot of -- of --
L:  [NOISE]  I'm sorry.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  [inaudible]  Um, go ahead.
R:  [MN]  They're for -- you know, I know -- I know they work hard to recruit people but they -- they don't seem to, ah, be able to -- to find people who they actually hire or th- -- th- -- they don't -- n- -- not even -- usually, I -- I don't even think -- I mean, I don't know who applies but I know I haven't even seen very many m- minority for the interview.
L:  Maybe there's fewer that meet the requirements, right?
R:  Yeah, well, yeah, I mean, well, it -- as I said, compu- -- you know, it's computer programming so [MN], I know that women tend to be less interested in [MN], um, and that's -- I don't know wheth-  -- I don't know what, you know, if there's so- -- some reason [MN] that few of our people end up as computer programmers or what --
L:  Well --
R:  -- what's going on there.
L:  Yeah, what is going on there?  Um, how -- how -- how did you get hired?  I mean, I don't know if this has anything to do with it but --
R:  Ah --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I --
L:  -- but do they make you perform a -- I mean, is there a test to see if you can do ...?
R:  It's -- yeah, there's a -- th- -- there -- there's a lot of tough interviewing.
L:  Huh?
R:  The -- the interviews are tough.
L:  Mm. 
R:  Um, you know.
L:  Mm.
R:  But -- but I don't think -- I don't even think that's the issue 'cause I haven't even seen black people applying.  I think it has more to do with -- I haven't s-   I haven't seen black computer programmers at other companies or any- you kn- -- it's fairly rare.  It's -- yeah, it's certainly -- they're not evenly represented.
L:  It might be rare but, yeah, I don't know.  My boyfriend's one.  [LAUGH] 
R:  He's a black computer programmer?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  This is why I'm c- -- like weird in -- in -- in Seattle.  But, anyway, that's just maybe [MN] not very --
R:  Well, like, ob- -- obviously your boyfriend doesn't work in my division. [MN] 
L:  [LAUGH]  No --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- probably not.  Do you mind if I ask, ah, what company?
R:  Ah, [MN] I'd rather not say, not because I don't want you to know but because, ah --
L:  Oh, because the, ah --
R:  Yeah, because [MN], who kn- -- God only --
L:  m
R:  -- knows who's going to read this.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah.  Mm. 
R:  Ah.
L:  Interesting.  It's obviously pretty big though, right? [MN] 
R:    Yeah.  It's a big org -- it's a big company.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um.
L:  Huh.  Interesting.  So, ah --
R:  So, ah, have -- have you ever talked to your boyfriend about affirmative action or about whether he's -- he's found it hard -- he found it hard to get hired or ...?
L:  Um, I -- I've talked to him about it a little bit and he is more under the impression that he doesn't, um [MN] -- he doesn't want to be hired just because, you know, he's black --
R:  Yeah.
L:  --or just because he's this.  So, he kind of feels, you know, he doesn't want to be handed any freebies so he tries, you know, very hard to, um, basically, yeah, I -- I'm not saying that he's not in favor of it but I'm sure that if there's a situation where he was, um, basically th- -- they had two choices for a certain position and one was white or Asian and -- or not Asian, excuse me, white and one -- and he was running, oh, kind of, up against them, I'm sure that he would feel that [MN] maybe he should be given the job.
R:  Ah, does he come from a disadvantaged background or [MN] or a -- a -- an average background or ...?
L:  Well, yeah, because he's pretty angry about the whole feeling that maybe [MN] he deserves something.
R:  Well, so -- so -- so from that, you know, I've known black people from, you know, tough backgrounds.  I've known black people who are the children of lawyers.  Ah --
L:  What was that?  Say it again.  You know --
R:  I've known black people who came from some pretty tough backgrounds but I've also known some black people who -- whose parents were lawyers and things like that, right?
L:  E- -- exactly, yeah, that's true.
R:  The ones whose parents were lawyers I don't think, ah, have -- have experienced that much, ah, hardship.  Ah --
L:  True.
R:  Ah, so what -- what about your boyfriend?
L:  Mm.  Definitely didn't come from a privileged background, definitely not.  But I'm not saying that they were, you know, dead poor [MN] --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- but, um, I think, yeah, but I think he feels like he has worked hard on his own to get to where he is --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and so I'm not [MN] -- see, [MN] we haven't really -- I haven't really ever really asked him the question, "Are you in favor of affirmative action?" but, um, I -- we've definitely go- -- we've talked about, you know, that, um [MN] --
