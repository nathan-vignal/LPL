R:  [NOISE]  Norma Kay.
L:  [MN]  Hi, I'm Kelly.
R:  Well, glad to meet you over the phone.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Nice to meet you.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I had to change ears.  I don't hear too good out of my right ear.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Not a problem.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.
L:  Do you watch any of the reality TV shows?
R:  Ah, yes, I do, The Survivor and, um, ah, mm. [NOISE] Oh, I can't think of the other one.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Ah --
L:  Like the Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire or --
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire.
L:  Yeah, I did -- I watched that one.  I never really watched the Survivor one.  I -- I turned it on a time or two but [MN] I just couldn't get in to it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I can't really get into it.  I -- I'm not a regular on that, don't get me wrong.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, ah, when it first come on I have watched it and, ah, [COUGH] and I watch a lot of the talk show programs, you know. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, I call that reality.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But whether they call it that or not I don't know.
L:  Ah, that I don't know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, did you, um, let's see, I guess it was the first one, Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire [MN] when they had that guy, um, and he married that lady named Darva, [MN] I think it was --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- and -- and they got divorced, what, a couple of months later.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Did you watch the latest, ah, Millionaire?  
L:  [MN]  Um.
R:  He was a -- a construction worker.  
L:  [MN]  I -- 
R:  I was supposing it --
L:  [MN]  I saw -- I saw and I'm, like, "Gosh, he's good looking, it's okay, he doesn't have to have money".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  [MN] 
R:  But he picked -- he picked the one girl, ah, oh, what was her name, ah [NOISE] mm, mm, mm, I can't think of her name.
L:  I don't remember.
R:  And, ah, but in the end, ah, whenever he chose her --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then they, ah, ah, give him a check for a million dollars.
L:  Oh, did they?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I -- now, I -- I didn't watch the last one so I -- I didn't know that that's what happened.
R:  Yeah, they were both just astonished but I don't know whether they will ever get married or not, you know, ah, but, ah, that was -- they brought out this huge check --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- for a million dollars.
L:  Well, that wouldn't be the -- th- -- that's a nice wedding gift.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes, it is.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  More than I got.
R:  [LAUGH]  I ain't got a million cents, much less --
L:  Yeah, no kidding.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] -- less being a millionaire.
L:  [MN] 
R:  But, ah, that's, um -- I enjoyed that program very much to see -- we was wondering who he would pick --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and all this kind of stuff, you know.  But, um ...
L:  Well, I just wonder, [MN] I guess, um, I'd want to know somebody a little bit longer, [MN] you know, before you up and marry him.  I mean, [MN] I guess you don't have to but [MN] just trying to, you know, decide if that's the right person or not over a short amount of time while being televised, I don't know about that.
R:  Yeah, ah, and too, you don't know whether y- -- that  -- to me that's, ah, [LIPSMACK] ah, advertising that you can't find a --a --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- man yourself --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that you've gotta, you know, h- -- have TV to -- to, ah, get your husband, you know.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That kind of stuff, you know.
L:  Might as well wear a sign, "I'm desperate".  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm telling you.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I just wonder.  I mean, what are some of their motives, um, [MN] you kn- -- money perhaps?  Ah, fame [MN], you know, "Oh, yes, I was so and so" and ... I don't know.
R:  Well, I think they do it for prestige.  [NOISE]  You know, to, ah, see if it really -- really is, ah, what they say it is, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, this kind of stuff.  But I wouldn't put myself in that -- in that category 'cause I'm too old to think about, ah, [MN] getting married.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, what about Survivor though?
R:  Oh, now, that's -- that's the pits as far as I'm concerned.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Where they had to eat them worms and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and, ah, you know, ah, climbing on high heights and this kind of stuff is sensible.  
L:  [MN] 
R:   Well, it's not really sensible but they are fixed where they won't fall off.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  But, ah, eating them worms and -- and, ah, poking their head in there for, ah, you know, all those kind of m- -- ah, snakes, c- -- scorpions and [MN] all this kind of stuff, uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  [MN]  No, but, you know, it's a -- a great weight loss program.  [LAUGH]  It's like, snakes tonight.  N- --no thanks.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm telling ya.  I'm telling ya.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah, I -- I would not do well with that, you know.  My idea of camping is the Holiday Inn, you know, air conditioning and TV.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  [MN]  Ah, [COUGH], excuse me.  [MN]  This afternoon on Montel Williams, I don't know whether you ever watch that program or not?
L:  Occasionally.
R:  Ah, that -- they pulled some of those tricks like they do on the Survivor shows.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH]  Ahah.  But, ah, anyway, that, ah -- that +Survival is -- is something else when it comes to, ah, to, you know, reality --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what people would do, you know.
L:  Oh, it's -- it's amazing what people will do for money.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Excuse me.  Yeah.  [NOISE]  And, um, but, um, when they commenced to talking about that and water -- I can't swim so I'd have to back out when it come to, you know, going in the water.
L:  See, now, you'd get voted off real quickly.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [COUGH]  Wouldn't last five minutes when it comes --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- to that kind of stuff, you know, eating them bugs and --
L:  Yeah, I -- no, I -- I wouldn't either.
R:  [MN] 
L:  I just wouldn't be a very good team player.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  [MN]  Excuse me.  Not at all for me and, ah, but, ah, some people, and it looks like it's the same people on there every week.
L:  [MN]  Yeah, it -- it is.  Um, and somehow they decide [MN] who they're going to vote off this week until they get down to the, you know, last couple people and then [MN], I believe, the people that they voted off get to vote for who they think the winner should be, who gets the money.
R:  Ahah.
L:  [MN]  So, but, I, you know, spending, ah, whatever it is a month or two months some place, you know, just wouldn't be for me but, yeah, it -- it's sort of interesting to watch but, ah, I definitely couldn't see myself --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- in that situation.
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE]  That's me too.  [NOISE]  It's, ah, just not my cup of tea.
L:  No, so, I guess I'll just leave it for them.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm telling ya, I'm telling ya.  It's, ah, they can have it.
L:  [MN]  Now, have you ever watched, um, Fear Factor?
R:  Yeah, ahah.
L:  Ah, now, I liked that one a lot better.  Um, you know, of course it seems like lately that [MN] the second section always has to do with eating something totally gross.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, you know, where you only do like [MN] one, maybe, possibly two dangerous, well, more dangerous stunts.  I mean, I -- I could handle that because, you know, it's pretty quick.  It's, you know, one a day and --
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE] 
L:  That wouldn't be too bad.
R:  [COUGH]  No, it wouldn't.
L:  Plus the guy is kinda cute, so ... [LAUGH]  You know, just an added benefit.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah, so, ah, ah, but, ah [MN] [NOISE] I like that, ah, I've gotten where I, ah, like that, ah, [LIPSMACK], oh, ah, I watched it last night.  [MN] [NOISE]  They were trying to win money.  Oh, can't even think of the name of p- -- the program.
L:  I don't know.
R:  They have about six players and then they, ah, go for forty five seconds or --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- something like that.
L:  Oh, yeah, um, it used to have that red haired lady on it.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  [MN]  I can't think of what it is but, ah, you know, it's -- it's not the same without her, I don't think.
R:  No, it's not.
L:  I mean, I thought she was a little cruel sometimes [MN] but, ah, the -- the show's not the same.  I don't like it any more since she's not on it.
R:  Ahah.
L:  You know, it's -- the lady that's making the comments now, it just doesn't suit her personality, [MN] you know, it's just sort of fakey.
R:  Well, it's a man.  The one I watch is a man.
L:  Oh, really, 'cause last time I saw it, it was a lady.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I haven't watched it lately.
R:  It's a man but he -- he makes, ah, smart aleck comments on it.  [LAUGH]  Whatever they -- they, ah, any -- if the person's got an unusual name he'll, ah, rhyme -- make up a rhyme that goes with their name, you know.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And that kind of thing, you know.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Hm.
R:  So it's, ah --
L:  Oh, I'll have to check it out 'cause last time I saw it, it was a
