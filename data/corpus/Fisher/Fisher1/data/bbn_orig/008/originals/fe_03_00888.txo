R:  Hello.
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  My name is Paula.
L:  Hi, Paula.  This is Phyllis.  How are you?
R:  Doing well.  How are you, Phyllis?
L:  I'm fine.
R:  Good.
L:  [MN] 
R:  Do you watch reality shows?
L:  I -- I have some.  I do a lotta, ah, a little bit of traveling so I don't get to watch 'em all the time.  Um.
R:  [NOISE]  I watch a couple, ah, or I just kind of keep in touch with [MN] one or two and -- or watch the end.
L:  [MN] 
R:  I don't, ah, keep up --
L:  I --
R:  -- with them every week.
L:  I got to see a little bit of, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, what is it?  Zora and, ah --
R:  Oh, ah, Joe Millionaire?
L:  Yes, I go to watch that at my son's when I was there visiting in Illinois.  [MN] But my, um, have you ever watched, like, ah, Real TV, like on MTV?
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  The Real World?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't watch it much but my son got to -- he, ah, filled out an application and then got an interview [MN] and he wasn't chosen but, ah, um, he was pretty excited about being on there, like, in --
R:  Sure.
L:  So, what do you watch?
R:  Um, I don't know if -- if American Idol counts but I watch that a little bit.  [MN] Um, just I like listening to the people sing and [MN] I watched a little bit of Joe Millionaire 'cause I was kind of intrigued by it and I think a lot of people were intrigued by that one would be why they watched that one.
L:  [MN] 
R:  Just as to -- who was going to fall for whom and -- and then would they stay after they found out that, um, [LIPSMACK] he wasn't really a millionaire.  Um, and then, um, [LIPSMACK] I watched just a little bit of The Bachelorette --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like I said, at the end.  I didn't watch every week but at the end when she was deciding between two [MN] um --
L:  I live in a rural area [MN] and I don't have your ABC, CBS or NBC.
R:  Okay.
L:  [MN] Ah, and, so, like I said, when I was in Illinois visiting my son I got that -- they were so excited because that was coming on that night [MN] and, um, he was [COUGH] like, what is the gentleman's name again?
R:  The -- the Joe Millionaire?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.  Well, he -- that was the night --
R:  I don't remember what his name is.
L:  Yeah.  It was -- it was the -- they had -- I think they had two shows left and -- and my son and daughter in law said that they were gonna, [MN] um, [MN], just have one show and so they were disappointed 'cause they had to wait another week.  [MN] 
R:  I remember that.
L:  But that was kind of my introduction to it.  So, I told 'em to make sure that they let me know what happened afterwards.
R:  Yeah.  [MN]  Well there -- I think at the end of it there were two -- there were two ladies left and [MN] one lady seemed, um, like she really cared about the money, whereas the other one didn't.  
L:  Right.
R:  She seemed, um, [MN] very down to earth and --
L:  I think her name was Sarah.
R:  The other one?
L:  She was the blonde headed lady and then the dark headed lady that he ended up cho- choosing --
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, it was Zora.
R:  Yes, that's right.  [MN]  Yeah, so I just watched it there at the end and I -- and --and again I didn't watch the whole thing but [MN] it seemed to me that -- that, ah, the other lady -- if -- her name was Sarah, it seemed like she [MN] probably would have cared a little bit more about the money.
L:  [MN]  Yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  But, I don't know even if I had CBS, CBC and NBC and -- and -- I don't know if I would watch them all the time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I'm -- I like, ah, my news shows.  I like Discovery and [MN] -- and what do you generally watch?
R:  Um, [MN] well, I have small children in the house and so we --we don't n- -- like, like you say, I try not to leave that on, um, but when -- when the kids are up and awake we watch the Discovery Channel as a family at night and we watch cooking shows like Emeril --
L:  [MN] I did but I [LAUGH] -- I'm try- -- I'm trying to lose some weight [LAUGH] and I always get -- I get hungry when I start watching them so ...
R:  I know.  He always has stuff that kinda makes you hungry.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, we watch stuff like that but, um, [LIPSMACK] but I think, you know, there's -- there's so many, um, I don't know if it's, um, generation X or -- or what that's watching these shows, you know.  [MN]  But, there's something about the networks that gets [MN] these people addicted --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to the shows and they tune in every week, you know, and [MN] I don't think Survivor is really as popular as it was maybe the first time.
L:  [MN]  Yeah, I -- I did watch a little bit of that, you know, because I travel here and there and then I, ah, when I'm out I -- I visit, you know --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- relatives in different states so sometimes they watch them.  No, I [MN] -- I didn't care for Survivor a -- a whole lot.  You must be, you said, but you said, ah, generation X, so you're -- I'm trying to guess your age then.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  And you have small children?
R:  I do.
L:  How small are we talking about?
R:  [MN]  Um, I have three that are under four.
L:  Oh, okay.  [MN]  So, are you in your thirties -- thirties?
R:  I am, yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.
L:  Well, I'm -- I'm in my fifties so [LAUGH]  --
R:  Are you?
L:  Yes.  [MN]  
R:  I don't -- I just don't -- I don't really care for those shows but I know a lot of, you know, some of my friends that are twenty five and -- and such and they just tune in every week.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah.  I --
R:  It's kind like the, um, you know the show Friends?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like that same crowd.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm, that same group.  They're -- they're hooked in to -- they're hooked in to those shows and they watch every one of 'em.
L:  Um.
R:  But, like, American Idol, I'll turn that on because that's just singing.
L:  Yeah, well, it's talent and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I don't mind having that on in front of the children whereas the other ones [MN] I'm not quite so sure about, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- about what they're gonna say or what they're gonna do, especially, like --
L: Yeah, 'cause it's reality.  [MN]  
R:  I know.  [MN] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  And, like, Survivor, you know, they're eating bugs and --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- stuff like that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's something you definitely don't want to teach your children.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's right.  [MN]   I don't want 'em to get any ideas, so ...
L:  [MN]  Yeah.
R:  [MN]  But, so, you said you watched Discovery Channel?
L:  Yeah, I like Discovery and I -- I love -- I've got -- I used to couldn't understand why my parents watched news shows all the time.  You know, every evening they had to watch their news or in the morning, you know, [MN] and it was, like, when I was growing up it's like, oh, gosh, they've got that [NOISE] crap on again, you know --
R:  I know.
L:  -- news.  But, now, I'm kinda hooked.  I guess it's because of the war and what's going on and [LIPSMACK] -- and everything.  I just [MN] -- t- t- to me reality is -- is kinda like soap operas.  Although it's real --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it just, ah, [MN] I don't know, I -- I kinda don't want to waste my time watching --
R:  I know.
L:  -- some of 'em, you know.
R:  Though with the Discovery Channel, you know, even my kids like watching it, you know, they'll have the history of a jet fighter or the history of the space shuttle program or something and they [MN] -- they just love sitting there watching that stuff and [MN] ...
L:  Yeah.  So, what, ah, geographic area do you live in?
R:  Texas.
L:  Texas?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I -- I do some traveling to Texas.
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  On jobs, yeah.  [MN]  Usually Dallas and Austin and I have my cousin that's in Houston but [MN] I live in Kentucky.
R:  Oh, you do?
L:  Yeah.  So, um ...
R:  How's -- how's your weather right now?
L:  [MN]  It's raining.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Is it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's been raining here for, like, two weeks.
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  So ...
L:  Oh.
R:  [MN] 
L:  So, you -- does your husband like, ah, the reality TV shows?
R:  No, no.  He's very much a [MN] -- he's very much a reader, you know, be it a newspaper or a magazine.  [MN]  He kinda loves information so he -- he would definitely consider them soap operaish as well and, um, so, he -- he likes to watch the -- the news channels, you know, CNN and [MN] ah, NS -- NBC but he also likes sports.
L:  That's what I -- what I like to watch.  Now, my husband, [MN] and he is not home that much, but, ah, I know, like I said, when we were -- when we had get -- got our channels to watch a few of 'em he [MN] -- he's the type that would like 'em.  He's the type that likes Jerry Springer so [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and I just -- [MN] it's not only that it's disgusting and stuff and I just -- I -- it's just that I d- -- I don't want to sit around watching a bunch of people that's probably been hired, that's got a lotta problems --
R:  I know.
L:  You know, and --
R:  Yeah.  Well, and it is -- it's kind of like, um, [MN] it's kind of tranquilizing, you know, I mean, and to me it seems i- in some of them, it seems very, um, [MN] manipulated, like, they really manipulate -- like the [MN] Joe Millionaire, um, um, when he was supposed to pick one and then they didn't and then they moved it another week --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It seemed -- they -- they clearly said that there was only gonna be one more and then they got everybody trapped into watching it again, you know, and the whole ratings thing, I d- -- like, it's old with me.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  I just don't like to play along I guess.
L:  Well, is, ah, is there any others out there that we haven't mentioned?  That I haven't ...?
R:  Ah, [MN] I think that --
L:  There's the Survivors and now --
R:  The Survivors.  You know, there's a -- [MN] there's also a celebrity one now.  It's like a celebrity Survivor.  Um ...
L:  Is there -- did you -- did you see the one that, and I don't know if this is real TV, [MN] the one where they have, ah, reality TV where they, um, [MN] oh, like, it's movie stars?  They're setting up dates for movie stars, like, [MN] have you seen that one?  
R:  I haven't seen that.  Now, I have seen and that did make me think of the Osborne's.  That's kind of a reality.
L:  Oh, you know what, yeah, that's definitely not for little children.
R:  No.
L:  But, I -- now I --I got to see them on Larry King.  You know, 'cause I watch Larry King a lot --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and, ah, they're kind of funny, you know, but they're [LAUGH] -- they're different.  [MN]  
R:  Yes, they are.
L:  They're different but a lot of peo-  the people -- 'cause my son said, "Oh, you've never seen the Osborne's, mom".  He said, you know, he said, "They're hilarious".  [MN] 
R:  Yeah, they are a unique family.  And then I guess Anna Nicole, her show would count as --
L:  Oh, I've watched -- I watched that several times just because I could not believe [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  It is pretty unbelievable. [MN] 
L:  That they even pay somebody.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  I know.  I can't believe that it's still on the air.
L:  [MN]  Well, I -- it is and I think, um, [LIPSMACK] I think -- I don't know if they're going to have it on -- I think this is another season for her, isn't it?
R:  Oh, I hope not.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] 
R:  She's just hideous.  I've never heard anyone say -- I mean, I'm sure that people, like you say, just watch it because they're, like, I ca- -- I c- -- they can't believe it.
L:  Well, probably, yeah, 'cause when they watch, like -- Jerry Springer is not -- that's just a talk show.  But, I mean, it's just -- my husband says, "I just can't believe people are like --"
