L:  [MN]  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH] Ah, my name is Ellen.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] 
L:  Excuse me?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Can you hear me?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh [MN] hi.  [MN] 
R:  Hi.
L:  Um, this is actually my first call, so [LIPSMACK] I don't know --
R:  Okay, it's mine too.
L:  Oh, okay.  [MN] [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, [MN] do you watch any reality television?
R:  Do I watch any?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which shows do you watch?
R:  Ah, Bachelor, Bachelorette, [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, wow.  I watched, um, [LIPSMACK] did you watch Joe Millionaire at all?
R:  Yeah, I watched that one.
L:  Yeah.  I watched parts of that but I -- I don't know.  I didn't get that hooked.  I think I only really get interested in it when it's, like, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, [LAUGH] --
R:  Funny.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm not really sure.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Like, I just didn't really like him.  I didn't think he was attractive and --
R:  Oh, I didn't either.
L:  I thought he was kinda dopey.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I just -- I don't know, I didn't like it and, I don't know.
R:  It was interesting, you know [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause they all thought he had money.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I know.  But they gave him money at the end so that was --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- good.  
R:  That was good.
L:  But, like, have you watched, I think I, fifty percent[?] I saw, like, Married By America for a little bit.  [MN] 
R:  Oh, no, I didn't watch it.
L:  Yeah, I haven't looked at that but I g- -- like, I just wonder, like, what kind of people, like, decide they'll, like, you know, let America vote and, like, have them get married, you know.  Like, I don't know.  [MN] 
R:  I wouldn't do that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's fun to watch.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I watch -- I guess I watch, like, Real -- Real World sometimes and, ah, like --
R:  I do sometimes.
L:  Yeah.  I just kind of, like, when my friends watch it, like, I watch it and, like, I'm easily, like, I easily get interested in it and stuff but I'm not, like, I don't ever, like, think, like, "Oh, I have to watch it".
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, yeah.  Um, what else are we supposed to talk about?  Why we think, ah, they're popular?
R:  Um, I don't know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  It's just interesting to watch.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I think it's kind of, like, it's being able to, like, see a window in, like, other people's lives but then at the same time it's kind of, like, such a fake, like --
R:  There's nothing in your life.
L:  Right, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they don't have to do anything.
R:  Mm.
L:  It's like having a window to, like, life where, like, there are no responsibilities and it's just like a big game kinda thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they usually, like, I think especially with things like Survivor they're going to exotic places and they have to do, like, weird things or, like, um, I guess with, like, Joe Millionaire, like, they're in a castle and it's, like, all these women going after one guy.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like, it just seems like it'll be, like, so, like, trashy and tawdry that it would be -- it have to be good.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  They, ah -- 
R:  They all wanted the money, that's the reason they went.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I know.  [MN]  But, um, [MN] actually, I think I heard the last of them -- thought that they told them, like, on Joe Millionaire that, like, it was only -- like, I thought they only knew that they were going to be on TV. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, they didn't, like, know that he was a millionaire but I'm not sure.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, I'm not really sure.  I --
R:  I think they told them in the first episode though.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hm.
R:  That he inherited fifty million.
L:  And then all the people got all excited.  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah --
L:  Hey!
R:  -- they were all, " [MN] Oh, yeah".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [MN]   Um ...
L:  "I'm gonna love this".  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I can't think of any other reality television shows.
R:  Um, The Bachelorette, did you watch that?
L:  I didn't watch that.  The girl was really pretty though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  With those thing[?].  How did that end up?
R:  Um, she --
L:  Did it end yet?
R:  Huh?
L:  Did it end yet?
R:  Yeah, it ended.
L:  Oh.
R:  Ended [inaudible] she ended up with Ryan.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, they seemed really happy.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  So ...
L:  [MN] Oh, and they -- they didn't have a Bachelor this year, right?  Like, Bachelorette was in place of it, or ...?
R:  Um, Bachelorette just ended --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- this year, like, two weeks ago, I think.
L:  Okay.  And they didn't have --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- another Bachelor?  Like, not Bachelorette, but Bachelor?
R:  N- -- uh-huh.  Not since last year.
L:  Oh, okay, yeah.  [MN]  Um, hm, [MN] I don't really know ...
R:  What about that I'm a Celebrity Get Me Outta Here?  [LAUGH] 
L:  What?
R:  That I'm a Celebrity Get Me Outta Here.  Do you watch that?
L:  Uh-huh, I've never heard of that.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, what is that about?
R:  It's, like, pen[?] celebrities and they have to do, like, it's like Survivor kinda.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Or it reminds me of Survivor.
L:  But with celebrities?
R:  Yeah, pen celebrities.
L:  Weird.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Are they like good celebrities or are they, like ...? [MN] 
L:  Um, most of them I don't know.  The one I know is Tyson Beckford.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, wow, he's in it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ooh!  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know the others.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ahah, I wonder who they are.  [MN]  Um, [LIPSMACK] out of curiosity, how long are these conversations?  Do you know?
R:  Um, they say ten minutes.  This is the first one I've ever done.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I don't really know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, they called, like, last week and I just didn't know what to, um, [MN], like, I -- they never connected to someone else.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I guess they never reached someone else.  I was like, "I'm hanging up".  [MN]  Yeah ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, trying to think of, ah, I don't know, I think I -- I just like watching, like, real people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because it's not completely, like, +skittered, I guess, and it's, like, ah, kind of impromptu and they always find, like, the perfect people to be on the shows.
R:  Oh, I know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  The same ones like Real World.  Like, they always have, like, given, like, they always have the token, like, gay character --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the, like, really conservative one --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- the one that's a rebel.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  But, like, it always makes for a really good, like, interesting show.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you get wrapped up in it, but ... [MN] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Plus they, I feel like they -- they're pretty regular with it, especially with, like, other shows always have, like repeats and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but you usually don't get repeats of, like, aside from [inaudible].
R:  Oh, Joe Millionaire you get repeats on Thursdays.
L:  Oh, did they?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I didn't even know that.
R:  That was cool because if you missed it --
L:  Are they still running that now?  'Cause I remember it -- wasn't last week they did something, like, with him and Zora's first reunion since --
R:  Yeah, that was the finale.
L:  Oh, okay.  How did that turn out?  Did they, like, date each other or ...?
R:  Um, I guess they're gonna try to date each other outside of camera world.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, wow.  [MN]  Are th- -- are they even from the same place? 
R:  Huh?
L:  Are they even from the same, like, place?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No, they're in two different places each with half a million.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, they split the money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I figured they'd do something like that.  Interesting.  I wonder if they would even, like, I feel like they're no- -- [MN] I feel like for TV they're, like, pretending, like, they're, like, staying together.  I feel like realistically --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it might not gonna happen.  But that's okay.
R:  Yeah, they said, um, half a million for Zora and half a million for him.
L:  Oh.  Well --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- that's cool.  Um, oh, my head hurts.  Um, [LAUGH], okay.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Now, what else do we talk about?  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  I'm not really sure.  More about [MN] ...
R:  Reality.
L:  Yeah.  I'm trying to think of any other shows.  There were a lot -- I guess they all started, like, two or three years ago.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Is that when Survivor started?
R:  [MN]  Yeah.
L:  There're a lot of 'em.  Like the Celebrity Mole type things.  I guess those are kind of re- -- well ...
R:  I don't watch that one though.
L:  Those are like g- -- I don't know if those are actually reality.  I feel like they are, kind of.  I'm not --
R:  What about, um, [MN] Are You Hot?  That's not a reality show, huh?
L:  Which one?
R:  Are You Hot.
L:  I've never heard of that.  Wh- -- ah, what station is that on?  
R:  Ah, channel thirteen, I believe.
L:  Oh.
R:  On NBC I think.
L:  Oh, I've never heard of that.  [MN]  Um --
R:  I think it's on Thursdays.  It's the search for America's hottest people.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, oh, I have heard of that.  [MN]  I didn't notice what it was called.  Um --
R:  Yeah, it's called Are You Hot.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Um, [LIPSMACK] isn't there some show -- my -- I have two friends from home that are, like, obsessed with this show and I can't remember what it's called [MN], like, where they go, like, is it called, like, Around the World or something and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's kind of like Survivor but it's, like, people -- you have to go around the world to, like, different sites and then you have to -- you only have a certain amount of money and you have to get to a si- -- spot and, like, perform a certain task or something.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Mm, I --
L:  But they travel all over the place --
R:  I think I know --
L:  -- to different cities.
R:  -- what you're talking about. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know what it's called though.
L:  Like, they're obsessed with it.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can't remember what it's called --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- but it sounded like an interesting show, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  Yeah.
R:  I have never seen it though.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Um --
R:  I more like the, ah, dating kinda shows.
L:  Oh, I know.  [LAUGH]  I -- yeah -- I get really hooked into them and I -- I really don't know why 'cause I think before they come on and they, like, show the previews --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm always, like, "Oh, that's so trashy, like, that's so [inaudible]".
R:  Yeah, and then you start watching them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you -- you --
L:  You flick through.
R:  -- can't get enough of it.
L:  I know, 'cause like, okay, Monday nights I watch Everwood --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, like, [MN] my boyfriend agreed to watch it with me and I was, like, okay, cool, but like, and he was completely anti generally and [MN] -- but then, yet, like, when it was, like, the season finale or the one before the season finale --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when they, like, showed who was picked, he was, like, you know, I think we have to watch that just because, like, I feel like we're missing something if we don't watch it --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- because everybody's watching it and then you won't know.  [MN]  So, we watched that but, like, he's, like, so, anti all the, like, reality shows and [MN] --
R:  Oh, I love them.
L:  I guess guys in general don't get as wrapped up necessarily [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in things like that.
R:  My fiance doesn't.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, so, I'm like, "Oh, okay".
R:  He kind of thought Joe Millionaire was interesting though --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause all the girls thought he had money -- he had money, but he didn't.
L:  I know.  I think throwing in that little, like, I don't know, kind of like playing a trick back on the, like, money grubbers or something --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  -- like that, I think that made it even more interesting.
R:  Yeah.  I wanted to see how they'd react at the end.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, especially, like, I saw the first episode and I immediately hated Heidi --
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  -- and, like, couldn't wait for her to get off --
R:  [MN] 
L:  --  the show and I was, like --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- that was what I was just waiting for.  Like, I just wanted her to be gone.
R:  I know but I was waiting for -- everyone hated her.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, but 'cause she was horrible.  Like [MN] -- like that first episode I -- given they probably, like, used clips that kind of, like, shaped, like, the public's view of them and stuff --
R:  Oh, yeah, they do that.
L:  but, like, [LIPSMACK] she, like -- grabbing the dress and everything and doing all -- like, making all these comments about how, like, [MN] you have to, like, be aggressive if you're gonna get the guy and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know, she was just -- she made it like +a intense competition right from the start.  [MN] 
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  So, yeah, she needed to go down.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Did you hear that where she had a boyfriend deal?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I didn't see it but I heard about that and I was -- 
R:  Yeah, and on the finale --
L:  -- like, why would you go on?
R:  -- the finale, I guess they're still together and he knows about it and he doesn't even care.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Are you serious?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And then -- oh, who was the person at the end?  [MN]
