L:  Hi, this is Marty.  Who is this?
R:  Hi, Marty.  My name is Janet.
L:  Jeanette?
R:  Janet.
L:  Janet.  What a pretty name.
R:  Your name is --
L:  Do you watch reality TV?
R:  Unfortunately I do and --
L:  Yeah, which -- w- why unfortunately?
R:  [LAUGH] My husband hates them.
L:  [MN] Oh.
R:  I have to record them on tivo [MN] and then I -- I watch 'em in the morning after he goes to work the next day.
L:  Which ones are your favorites?
R:  Well, I've been watching The Survivor and watched The Bachelorette.
L:  Oh, The Bachelorette is -- is -- I missed some of it but I would have been interested in that.  Who did she choose finally?
R:  [MN] Um, she went with Ryan.
L:  Ryan?
R:  Yes, I would have gone for the hunk, b- [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, no, she was looking for somebody to settle down with.  [MN] The hunk is not good to settle down with.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah, well, sh- --
L:  I don't watch many myself but The Bachelorette g- -- things like Fear Factor and stuff like that, I just get grossed out by them.
R:  Yeah, I don't really watch those.
L:  [MN]  But, ah ...
R:  I was watching, like, the dating ones and Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire.  I was kind of curious on [MN] how these women could be so stupid not to know that this guy was a fake.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, The Bachelor I didn't like at all but The Bachelorette was really interesting, seeing these guys, you know --
R:  Yeah, I was --
L:  -- the role reversal.  I didn't think they would be as -- as sincere as they seemed.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [MN] 
R:  That was one thing with -- with Ryan and she had a good point when she ended it.  She said she wanted the one that was truly in love with her and --
L:  How'd you get into --
R:  -- he totally was.
L:  this -- how'd you get into this study?  [LIPSMACK]  Are you a m- -- shopper?
R:  Yeah, I do mystery shopping.
L:  Me too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and merchandising.  [MN]  We're not supposed to talk about that though, I guess, but ...
R:  I guess not, no.
L:  -- but a lot of people, ah, I mean, this is a great way to get a job, I mean, a great way to earn some money.  I'd like to do it, like, [MN] for months.
R:  Yeah, I -- I like doing the shopping because I can do it with my family and it --
L:  Yeah, the same thing.
R:  -- gives us some extra money and ...
L:  My daughter goes with me and, ah, well, she goes with me for a lot of them but some of them she doesn't go to.  Um ...
R:  I just started a couple of weeks ago.  [MN] 
L:  Oh, I've been doing it for about a year and really, I'm going more to- -- towards merchandising now 'cause it's stable.
R:  Yeah.  I can under- --
L:  I don't have to [inaudible] for jobs.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I don't get invalid jobs.  Like, yesterday a job left me only with enough --
R:  Hey, we're -- we're gonna get in trouble if we go off --
L:  Oh, oh, we- --
R:  -- topic for too long.
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  Let's have eight minutes --
L:  let's talk about reality TV.
R:  -- of on topic.
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  Right.
L:  It's my fault.  [MN]  So --
R:  Do you watch 'em live on television or ...?
L:  Which?
R:  Do you watch them live while they're on or do you have to --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- record them like I do?
L:  I do- -- I don't record anything any more.  
R:  So --
L:  I'm too lazy to set up the VCR.  [MN] 
R:  I've been watching this last Survivor program because I have three daughters --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and the gir- -- you know, the girls are just kicking butt.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah --
R:  I've been enjoying that.  It's like, look at the girls go.
L:  It scares me the -- the tricks they have to do.  I mean, or the stunts they have to do.  That one where they had to crawl between two buildings on a rope.  I couldn't even watch it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the bug eating.  I don't know.  It's just [MN] -- there's just something about it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN]  How do we talk about reality TV for two, for -- for ten minutes though?
R:  I'm not really sure.
L:  That's why I said, maybe we can go -- switch back to who we are and what we do.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I'm not --
L:  And how does it affect your life?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um.
R:  [MN] 
L:  I haven't --
R:  I kinda like it 'cause it's given me social things to talk about with other people.
L:  Ahah.
R:  Um, it's like, you know, the whole neighborhood is into it and we're talking about the different relationships and --
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  -- what we think should happen.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, see, not anybody -- I live in an apartment building but I don't know that many people yet.  We just moved here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the one downstairs doesn't watch any -- any of it.  The one [MN] lady I know downstairs that we haven't talked about it.  [MN]  But, um, so The Bachelorette chose Ryan.  That's really nice to know.  [MN]  What do they consider reality TV be- -- besides the fear shows and the dating shows?
R:  [MN] Ah, well, any that are not scripted.  I can't --
L:  [MN]  Do you think they not scripted?
R:  -- think of any others.  I think that, personally, personally, I think that, yes, she had someone helping her write lines because it was just -- it seemed rehearsed.
L:  Ahah.  I mean when you get back to the real reality TV it's like MTV stuff. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I don't think those were scripted.
R:  No, the live television like that.  Those were always a lot of fun.
L:  Yeah.  Ah, I --
R:  I used to love the old talk shows
L:  -- did watch a couple of them but now I -- I get onto 'em and I say, "Oh, no, no more of these".  I just [MN] -- the -- the -- the novelty has worn off for me.
R:  Ahah.
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK]  What part of the country are --
R:  Well --
L:  -- you from?
R:  I live in California.
L:  I live in Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  It's cold there still.
L:  Ah, it is.  It's -- it's warmed up to forty degrees today.
R:  Oh.  It's about --
L:  But yes- --
R:  -- seventy five here.  [LAUGH]  [MN] 
L:  -- two days ago it was, like, ten.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, ten degrees.  It was freezing, it was so cold.  [LIPSMACK] So, it was nice to come in and watch a show where it, ah, ah, [MN] this one where they --
R:  Where everyone's at the beach.
L:  -- had the celebrities in the middle of the warm -- warm desert.  [MN]  What's that one called?
R:  Oh, I've heard about that one.  I didn't see that.  What did you think?
L:  Ah, oh, all I thought about it was, like, who cares?  But th- th- -- I wanted to see what sort of environment they were put into.
R:  It was nice to see the island, huh?
L:  It was, like, not a -- it's not a tough environment at all.
R:  Ahah.
L:  [MN]  But it's nice and warm down there.
R:  Even though it's warm here an island does sound good.
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yeah, I've been working on putting in my vegetable garden.  [MN] 
L:  Oh, already?  In A- -- in March?
R:  Mhm.
L:  The beginning of March.  That's not possible.
R:  I live in a farming community --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- in the, you know, the big valleys in the middle of California.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's where I live.  So, yeah, the farms are already -- all the trees are all bloomed out and --
L:  Oh, my goodness.  I can't even w- -- imagine.  We're gonna wait another month and a half for that.
R:  Yeah, the bees are waking up.  I'm waiting for the humming birds to arrive 'cause they leave for the winter. [MN]  They sh- --
L:  Where do they go?
R:  They go to South America.
L:  Mhm.
R:  All the -- what we get are the ducks.  All the ducks come to California [LAUGH] and all the geese.
L:  Ah.
R:  [MN]  They'll leave and then the hummingbirds and the swallows come back.
L:  I wonder if they beep and tell us when our time is up.
R:  Yeah, the phone will actually disconnect.
L:  Will disconnect?
R:  From what I understand.  This is the first call I've done.
L:  Me too.
R:  Um, I -- I saw -- I was on, you know, the -- the news list.
L:  Ahah.
R:  I saw it listed on there and, like, "Oh what is this?"  It sounds kinda interesting.
L:  Well, in case it disconnects before I have the time to say, I wanna say it's a pleasure talking to you and it's nice meeting people from all over the country this way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] Ah, I'm sorry if I can't find ten minutes of conversation on reality TV.
R:  Well, I'm trying.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm really trying too but there's no more.  I think we -- we've we tapped the subject.
R:  Yeah, unfortunately there's not -- other than Survivor, there aren't really any good ones on right now.  
L:  No.
R:  So it's kind a hard to --
L:  They'll come up with some new ones.
R:  -- anticipate what's going on.  The Survivor I have found kind of humiliating in that all these women are there and none of them seem to know what they're doing, like --
L:  Well ...
R:  I keep thinking, "I can do better than that.  I can build a better shelter than that".  [LAUGH] 
L:  You think you could?
R:  Yeah, actually I do.  [MN] 
L:  That's great.  Then you're very self sufficient.
R:  So, yeah, I took my -- my three kids out when one was a baby last year and we went camping for three weeks.
L:  When one was a baby?
R:  Yeah, she was --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- she was four months old.
L:  You let her crawl around in the dirt and eat bugs and everything?
R:  Well, she was only four months old so she wasn't crawling yet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yes, I have taken my others and a little dirt isn't going to hurt anybody.
L:  No.  No, it isn't.
R:  Now, I did take my dog for protection.  My husband was -- he started a new job and couldn't get a vacation.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I --
L:  What kind of dogs do you have?
R:  He is a radio frequency engineer.
L:  Ahah.
R:  The kind of stuff that they're studying, he invents all that kind of stuff.  [inaudible] funny.
L:  Oh, I said, "What kind of dogs do you have".  I think you heard --
R:  Oh, dog?  I have a --
L:   "What kind of jobs do --"
R:  Oh, I have a Dutch Shepherd.
L:  What's a Dutch shepherd?
R:  Are you familiar with those?  They have 'em in Pennsylvania.  [MN]  They're commonly used as police dogs.
L:  Oh, well, then, your husband --
R:  They're --
L:  -- they're pretty good for protection, huh?  Are yours trained?
R:  Yes, she's extr- -- sh- -- they're extremely intelligent.
L:  Ahah.
R:  They have to be very well trained.
L:  I'm gonna look it up on the Internet now that [MN]  -- now that, ah --
R:  Yeah, Dutch shepherd.
L: -- [MN] you've told me about it.
R:  They're beautiful.  They're brindled and they're just really smart and totally devoted.
L:  See, that's one I never heard of before.
R:  Well, there are not very many in the United States.  There are about three hundred and almost all of them belong to either the air force or the police department.
L:  Oh, wow, how --
R:  Her, she came -- her -- her mother is an avalanche rescue dog --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- from Las Vegas.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And her father is a drug dog in Iowa.
L:  Well, so, you have really good protection when you went camping.
R:  Yes, she can do -- she's funny 'cause she was trained to lick -- i- i- it's all a trick, you know, when they -- they do the growling and vicious part.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You can train them to do it on command.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And th- -- when they're actually, and they're really happy to do it, "Oh, this is so fun, I get to growl at this person".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  And scaring the --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- other person to heck and that.
R:  Yeah, it -- it makes a great watchdog, j- --even though she's extremely friendly and would never hurt anyone, [MN] she thinks it's really fun to obey me and to growl when she's told to.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm, that's really neat.
R:  So, it kept us very safe.  I -- I didn't feel at all intimidated.
L:  Yeah, I wasn't sure whether I was going to get a phone call from this project at all.
R:  Oh, I just heard from them yesterday.  So, they -- they called --
L:  Oh, I -- I got --
R:  Did someone call you at home and talk to you?
L:  They talked to my daughter.  I wasn't home.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They gave me the PIN number.  I couldn't remember it.  I had to go back to my email box and look it up.  [MN] 
R:  Well, I did that too.  I selected, okay, it takes thirty seconds to get that person so I gotta go look for this number [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  I didn't expect it so soon.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] 
R:  I just was unprepared.  
L:  [MN]  Ah.
R:  My phone's been ringing off the hook all day.  I'm surprised that they got through.
L:  Well, it's right at five o'clock.  [inaudible]  I said five to eight was the best time and it is the best time.  [MN]  So, um, actually, I could take it from five till midnight, anytime would be a good time for me.  [MN]  But, um, ah ...
R:  It's -- it's interesting that they matched us up, being from other ends of the country.
L:  I don't know if it matches up, if there is some kind of process 'cause they didn't do anything other than take my telephone number.
R:  Oh, you didn't fill out a form on line?  I thought I did.
L:  A very small form, but I don't remember if it said where I --
