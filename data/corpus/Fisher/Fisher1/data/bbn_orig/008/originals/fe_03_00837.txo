L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  
R:  [MN] 
L:  I'm Lesley.
R:  Um, my name is Sven.  I'm a student at the University of Pennsylvania. 
L:  Oh, hi, yeah.  I'm, ah, Lesley.  I'm at Wayne State University.
R:  Okay.
L:  That's in Michigan.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  All right. [MN]
L:  So, um, okay, so, time travel.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Time travel.  Yeah.  Do you think it's -- it's -- it will be possible at some time in the future?
L:  Well, um, hm, I'd like to think it would be actually.
R:  Um.
L:  But, um, if we were to go back, I think they wanted us to talk about if we were going to go back in our -- in our own lives and change something.  That's a little tougher.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I honestly don't think it'll ever be possible but, um -- because I think if it was possible then we would have met someone who came back from the future.
L:  Oh, that's an interesting thought.
R:  And I never met anyone.  [LAUGH] 
L:  True.
R:  [LAUGH]  So --
L:  [LAUGH]  Or, of course, maybe the world gets destroyed in another twenty years and there's no one left.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, yeah, um, that's -- that's a scary thought but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's entirely possible.  Um, what would I change?  I don't really know.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah, that's, um, that's a tough one.
R:  Um, [MN] I think maybe some little things but, ah, I don't know.  I don't think I personally would change any major -- any major things.  I'm pretty --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- pretty happy with the major -- the major things that have happened in my life so far.  Of course, there are a few little things here and there but --
L:  I -- I agree with that because, um, you know, if we were to change something we wouldn't really be ourselves if we changed those experiences, right?
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  But, small things, I'm racking my brain, trying to think of --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- what small things I might --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, [NOISE] um, are we supposed to talk more about, ah, what, you know, the things we would change or --
L:  That was what the -- the topic said, which wasn't what I was expecting, yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, it's not a very interesting topic if you ask me.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  No, the -- the whole subject of time travel in general is much more -- much more fun [MN] --
R:  Yeah, it's more interesting.
L:  -- because I'd like to think -- I agree with you that it probably won't happen.  Um, I think there are probably just too many physical problems --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but [MN] I've -- I've often thought, you know, it would be very interesting to, um, to be able to not only go back in time but maybe to bring people forward and just -- [NOISE]  -- experience -- oh, dear, I hope my phone doesn't die --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- um, experience [LAUGH] --
R:  The future?
L:  [MN]  Or even our time through their eyes, you know.
R:  Oh, bring people to our time --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- from the past?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've thought about that.  I mean, I've thought about, you know, bringing things from our times back to, like, a hundred or five hundred years ago and what -- how people would react, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to see, like, a nightclub, a discotheque or something.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
R:  Like pounding baselines and --
L:  Wha -- what would Shakespeare think --
R:  flashing lights.
L:  -- if he saw one of his plays performed or on TV or something, yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, yeah, that's -- that's -- that's interesting, yeah.  Um, I think actually [NOISE] travel into the future may become possible.  I mean, theoretically it's possible.  I -- you know, I've read a little bit about the relativity --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- relativity theory and, ah, so, it says if you -- if you move very fast --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- compared to another person or another place then time will pass by faster for you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, by that way you could kind of travel into the future but then you would never be able to come back.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  You know, you -- you could -- you could get on a spaceship and you can fly around in -- in outer space for, like, a year or, say, you and the spaceship [NOISE] feel like a year has passed for you but then when you come back to earth, ah, five hundred years have passed on earth --
L:  Right, but you can't go backwards in time?
R:  But you can never go back and that's --
L:  That makes sense.
R:  -- that's, yeah -- that's what happens for you and so, ah --
L:  But I just worry that, um, you know, the physics of a human might preclude that kind of thing.  Like, maybe a particle could do it, ah --
R:  [MN]  Yeah, I guess.  That's probably true 'cause you would have to move at speeds that approach the speed of light --
L:  Right.
R:  -- somewhat and I think that's beyond --
L:  Have you -- have you ever thought when you were flying on a -- on a plane, just the fact that you are going so much faster than everybody else that maybe there are a few seconds that you're [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, [MN] maybe, I mean, I know that scientists have conducted such -- such experiments.  They put, like, highly accurate, ah, clocks on -- on an airplane, like atomic clocks or whatever and then -- and then let the airplanes fly around the world and then when they stop that they actually could see that the clock on the plane was, like, a second or so or -- or a split of a second ahead of, ah, the same clock that was back [MN] -- back on the bases --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all the time, so ...
L:  That's an interesting thought, you know, if you fly all the time maybe you'll end up living five minutes longer --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] than everybody else.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I don't know if it -- if it makes that much of a difference, if you can actually --
L:  No.
R:  -- accumulate five minutes.
L:  Probably not.  [LAUGH] 
R:  A little bit, so ...
L:  Mm, maybe if you flew in a space shuttle all the time or something.
R:  Yeah. [MN]  I don't know, maybe not a good idea, the space shuttle.
L:  No, yeah.  Not now.  Mm.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Well, actually, I guess if I had a chance I would still go on a space shuttle.
L:  Oh, I definitely would.  No doubt.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  But I don't know if I'd go on the Russian one.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  Um, I don't know, I think they -- the -- the track record in terms of safety are pretty much comparable, I think.
L:  Well, my dad was telling me that somebody when they first started the space program said that we could expect a major disaster every fifty missions and the Challenger was right around fifty and this is, I think, one hundred and thirteen --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so, I guess statistically we should have been expecting it.
R:  That's scary.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah, so, yeah, um [LIPSMACK].  Yeah, the Russians have had their share of accidents too and the -- the Americans.  I don't know.  I mean [MN], are we allowed to drift off topic?
L:  Well, that's what I'm wondering.  I don't know what they're studying here so I don't know if we're supposed to just [LAUGH] -- um, maybe we should stick to time travel.  Um, mm ...
R:  Time travel, oh, time travel.  I mean, I've discussed it so many times with friends.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But then when it comes naturally it's so much easier to talk [LAUGH] about it.
L:  [LAUGH]  Hm.
R:  Um, [MN] um, sometimes I have -- I have thought, you know, how -- how you could have changed the course of history if you -- if you had been -- if you were able to bring back, you know, certain things like, say, certain military equipment or something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- into the past.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It could alter the outcome, the result of wars or something.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or you could just warn people and tell them what would happen so it doesn't happen [MN].
L:  Sure, yeah.
R:  But I think you could totally mess up things that way.
L:  Exactly, I mean, what would happen if one of us went back and -- and, like, killed a Hitler or something of that nature.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Then there's no telling what the world would be like.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  I don't kn- -- well, okay, if -- if time travel were possible, wouldn't you have to sit down pretty long and hard and think about whether you'd actually want to do anything?  I mean --
R:  I know, I know.
L:  Even the small things.
R:  There's been, like, so many movies about that topic and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sometimes in the movies you see, like, people disappearing from the pictures or something.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know if that would actually happen but, ah, it's -- it's --
L:  So, maybe that's why you can't travel into the past.  
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  You can only go into the future.
R:  -- I guess, yeah, so it's definitely -- if you could it definitely would mean a big responsibility.  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, y- you better think about -- think about it long and hard.  So, [MN] um, yeah, I think you could do some major damage.  [MN]  Of course, you could also go back and, like, you know, put all your money in the stock market.
L:  That's true.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Right before the internet boom and then take it out on a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- peak or get all the lottery numbers right.
L:  Oh, yeah, tons of stuff you could do just --
R:  All these things.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, [MN] yeah, I guess it's [LIPSMACK] um --
L:  You -- have you lost anyone close to you that -- I'm -- I'm thinking, like, some people might say, "If I could go back, um, I would tell my mother I loved her" but it doesn't sound like either of us have had that sort of experience.
R:  [MN] Not really.  I mean, my grandparents have passed away but, ah, I
