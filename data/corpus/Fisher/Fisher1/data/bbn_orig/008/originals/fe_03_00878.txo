R:  Si.
L:  Rebecca.
R:  Yeah, I guess I enjoy going to movies for the most part.  Um, I've gotten a lot more select about it 'cause the ticket prices keep going up but I would say I do enjoy [MN] going to the movies.
L:  Um, I do, but the ticket price is a problem.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't have a job or anything and I am a student.
R:  Right.  [MN] 
L:  So I definitely do prefer watching movies at my house.
R:  Yeah, I definitely --
L:  I'd say.
R:  -- would have that preference though, watching at home.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, actually I find it cheaper just to buy movies.
R:  Certainly, yeah.
L:  Um, especially since there are lots of dis- discount sites on the web and stuff --
R:  Mhm.  
L:  -- and you can probably buy a movie for the same price that you can go to the movies for.  
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, that's what I prefer to do.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  And, what was the other question?  [MN] 
R:  I think that was --
L:  Well, how often do you go to the movies?
R:  Ah, probably, I guess on the average once a month but I mean there are months when I don't go.  [MN] 
L:  Same here.  I've probably gone about two times in the last six months.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, definitely not often.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, right.  [MN] 
L:  I used to go a lot more --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- especially a few summers ago I'd go to a movie probably each day.  My friend worked in a movie theater --
R:  Oh, right, [several inaudible words].
L:  It was free, [MN].
R:  Yeah, movies are better in the summer anyway, so ...
L:  That's true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, yeah, that's what I did every day.  [MN]  
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  And, um, I don't really rent many movies. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't see any point since --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I can buy them.
R:  Right.
L:  And, what was the other question?
R:  Um, I gue- -- I guess what was the last movie you went to and did you enjoy it?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, [MN] the last one I went to was My Big Fat Greek Wedding.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  That was an excellent movie.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Very funny, and it was, basically, the theater was full [MN] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and there were people of all age ranges and genders and [MN] everyone enjoyed it.  
R:  Right.
L:  Which one did you go to?  
R:  Ah, it was a movie called May.  Um, it was sort of like a black comedy.
L:  Oh, those are always --
R:  m
L:  -- good.  
R:  Yeah, it was pretty fun and it was a pretty big crowd.  It was part of a horror film festival so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it was a little bit different than your usual movie crowd but, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, it was fun.
L:  Well, that's cool.
R:  [MN] 
L:  What was that one about?
R:  Ah, it's just about this, um -- this woman when she was a little kid her mother told her if you can't, um, make -- if you can't find new friends make one and so she killed a bunch of people and made the parts together.
L:  [MN] 
R:  [LAUGH]  That was [inaudible] [MN].
L:  Very interesting. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's called --
R:  It -- it was a little better than my description but that's the basic root of the plot.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  That was called May or --
R:  Yeah.  M.A.Y.  That was her name.  [MN] 
L:  Ah.  I think I will actually check that out.
R:  [MN] 
L:  I love black comedies --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- definitely and that's actually basically what I watch. 
R:  Right.
L:  That's basically what I buy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I've gotten a lot lately, probably in the last month, since I do choose to buy movies.  So I try to buy about one a week.  [MN] 
R:  Oh, oh, that's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- pretty frequent, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I know.  I've got an addiction to DVDs.  
R:  Oh, yeah, you can do that Netflix thing now where you -- they just deliver it to you --
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  -- and you send it back, you know.
L:  That's true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I don't like that that much 'cause I can't keep it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's true.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And there's the responsibility there. [MN] 
R:  Yeah, yeah.  
L:  [MN]  Um.  What was the movie you saw before [MN] that last one [MN]?
R:  Wow, I can't even remember, um, um, I guess I went to see Lord of the Rings.  I'm not a huge fan of that but it was all right, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I didn't see that one.  
R:  [MN] 
L:  I fell asleep during the first one. 
R:  Yeah, I did too.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I figured I probably shouldn't especially since I heard it was longer than the first one.
R:  Yeah, it did seem a little longer but I think there was a little more action though, so ...
L:  Mm, I might eventually see it --
R:  yeah.
L:  -- but [MN] definitely wasn't running to the theater for that.  
R:  Yeah, yeah, it wasn't [inaudible] [LAUGH].
L:  [MN]  And, probably the last one I saw at the theater [MN] before My Big Fat Greek Wedding [LIPSMACK] was Bowling for Columbine.  
R:  Oh, yeah, I meant to go see that but it only played for a few weeks here, but you know, never got around to it [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.  Well, we have lots of independent movie theaters here.  
R:  Yeah, where do you live?
L:  I live in Cleveland, Ohio.  
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, we have a few but they kind of come and go quickly [MN].
L:  Oh.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  Well, that one actually did play for many, many weeks here so --
R:  Oh, well.
L:  -- when it's on video I definitely suggest it.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I've read some good reviews of it, yeah.
L:  Yeah, definitely good.  Makes you think a lot --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and makes you cry.
R:  Oh, well.
L:  It doesn't matter who you are, you will cry.  [MN]  
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  So, expect that.
R:  Okay.
L:  [MN]  And, um, trying to think of what other movies I've seen in the theater.  [MN]  I don't know if I can even think of any.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  No idea.  Um.  There's a movie actually I do want to rent though 'cause it's way too expensive to buy right now, um, Who is Cletis Tout.  Have you heard of that one?
R:  Yeah, I've heard of that, what is that?  I've heard of that though.
L:  Um, it's got Christian Slater in it --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and I think that he runs away from jail [MN] and takes on a new identity [MN] and I'm not quite sure what else.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But it seems interesting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  From what I've heard.  [MN]  And now dreams are actually starting to enter in -- like, movies are starting to enter into my dreams and [MN] I think I had a dream about it last night.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And other dreams about movies and I was in a lot of movies and it was very strange.  So, it's funny that I got this topic.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] So, now I have to see it since I dreamed about it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, since you dreamed about it you have to see it.
L:  Yes, I think it's a definite sign.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  But I haven't -- I've only seen it [LIPSMACK] at one rental place.  I haven't seen it anywhere to buy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know if its independent or what it is.
R:  I think it is.  I could be wrong but it -- it seemed like it was.
L:  Yeah, probably.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I like independent films more --
R:  Yeah, I do too.
L:  -- rather than the Hollywood films.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And what other movies do you like?
R:  Um, yeah, mostly independent movies and, um, um, [LIPSMACK] I can't really narrow down one genre but just independent, using that umbrella term for [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what I enjoy more.
L:  [MN]  In movies, ah, especially, with dark comedies, they --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- don't get a lot of rave reviews and you don't really hear about them.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  But they're really good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause there's another movie, Love and a forty five, have you heard of that one?
R:  Yes, yeah.  
L:  Yeah, see, I've heard about it but I haven't been able to find it anywhere.
R:  Right.
L:  And it sounds really good but [LAUGH] impossible to find.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That was only made in ninety five.
R:  Right.
L:  So [LAUGH] ...
R:  I saw Bartlebee a few months back [MN].  Actually it -- it was this summer but that had Crispin Glover --
L:  Hm.
R:  who -- he -- from --
L:  I haven't heard of that one.
R:  -- from Back to the Future.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, okay.
R:  He -- I guess -- he made a bunch of money off doing that and since then he's just done these totally weird -- just no budget movies.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  Those are the best.
R:  I know.  Well, it's the best.  That's why I liked it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  B movies rule.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  That's actually -- when I do rent movies that's what I rent.  I don't buy the B movies but -- especially the ones from the eighties, I rent those.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  [MN] Those are great.  The horror section especially, you can find the best B movies.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [MN]  And there are some new B movies that are terrible too --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- but that's what makes them great.
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, I rent those too.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  When I find them I do, all the time --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- especially during the summer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's when we do it.  [MN]  And I think I was more into horror movies when I was younger --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I think I actually like most genres now [MN].  Not war though, not into that.
R:  Yeah, I -- I haven't seen a lot of good war movies.  [LAUGH] 
L:  No.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Not that I can think of, yeah.
L:  No, but, um, [MN] I used to hate action movies but I'm starting to dig them a bit.
R:  Oh, yeah, I've never been a big action fan either, yeah.
L:  Yeah, but they're -- no, I don't like shoot 'em up films.
R:  Right.
L:  That I don't like but if there's something else going on or a romance I like it.
R:  Mhm.  Right.
L:  [MN]  If there's some chick flick element it's okay.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] And luckily my boyfriend doesn't really mind -- he doesn't really like the action so it's good.  I don't have to see many.
R:  Right, yeah, that's good.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, um, where are the movies that you want to see now that are out in theater?
R:  Um, I guess, e- -- eventually I'll go see The Hours and, um, there's not a lot of good new movies out right now.  They're, um,
