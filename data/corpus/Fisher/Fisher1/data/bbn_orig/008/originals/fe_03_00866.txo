L:  Ah, hello, my name's Nadine.
R:  Hi, my name is Sheryl.
L:  How are you?
R:  Just fine.  How are you?
L:  [MN]  Oh, I'm pretty good.  Are you nervous about this?
R:  Ah, a little bit, yeah. 
L:  Oh --
R:  This is the first time I've done it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Me too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  I guess we're supposed to discuss this topic.  Did you get what it is?
R:  The school system?
L:  Yeah, there's something seriously wrong in the US public school system.
R:  Well, do you think there is?  [MN] 
L:  Oh, I think there is definitely in my area.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Ah, West Virginia.
R:  West Virginia.  I'm in North Carolina.  So, we're not that far apart.
L:  [LAUGH]  No, we're not.  [MN] 
R:  Well, what do you think is wrong with our school system?
L:  Um, [MN] I guess I don't believe that there is enough, ah, information for the students to choose from.  I think, I -- I'm a Christian, so, I'm, you know, definitely against a lot of the things that they are taking out of school saying that it would be with church and state, you know.
R:  Yeah, I agree with that.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, they say that there are a lot of people that are Christians and this is, you know, supposed to be a Christian nation [MN] but they aren't showing that by giving the option for the students to choose.  They're saying, "No, you can't have any at all".
R:  Right.
L:  And, I think, I'm -- I'm sorry but I believe that's one of the problems we have with morals and standards in our school.  I believe that it's not an option.  It is, um, pushed on the students.
R:  Yeah, and also taken away.
L:  Yes.
R:  I agree with that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I also believe we have financial problems with our school systems.  [MN]  Um, my daughter is in the eleventh grade and --
L:  Oh, my son is too.
R:  Oh, really?  [MN] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] -- and she came home this year and said that she had to take a test and the test cost twenty dollars.  
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  And I said, "Well, what is the test for?"  And she said, "Well, it's a test that everyone has to take".  Well, they ended up giving their money back to the -- to all the students that had to take this test --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but the reason for it costing to start with was because the school system didn't have the [MN] money or the f- -- well the funds to print this test out on paper.
L:  [MN] 
R:  So it was for the ink for their printers.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, give me a break.
R:  And I was really upset.  [MN] 
L:  [LAUGH]  To say the least!
R:  [MN]  So I had to call the school and voice my opinion.  Of course, I'm sure it didn't do any good -- mine didn't but they did get their money back.  All the students did.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I just felt that was really wrong.
L:  Well, I -- I, um, I work at a private school.  I work at a Christian school.
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I do.  [MN]  But, um -- and I'm partly involved with the public system.  I work as a volunteer in the library at the school here.  We only ha- [MN] -- we have very small areas so, living, you know, here we have maybe, oh, six thousand people, maybe -- maybe eight thousand people, I guess, in my area [MN] and, ah, of course all the students in this county go to one school.  So, [MN] I don't attend the PTA.  I can't say I get involved with that because I'm involved with the Christian school but we have tried -- our community has tried to upgrade the system, you know, here and it's just [LIPSMACK] -- I'm not -- I'm not from here originally.  I'm from Washington DC so, ah, coming here and seeing the educational system I'm just appalled.
R:  Yeah.  How was it in Washington?  Did you go to school there?
L:  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  I -- I graduated, ah, from high school right outside of DC and, um, [LIPSMACK] it's one of the higher educational systems there.  I mean, in Fairfax County and in, um, Prince George's County at the time when I graduated there were very high, I mean, I -- I -- I had a very good education.  And then to come here, you know, I -- I didn't come here till I was, what, thirty six years old, [MN] so when I, you know, had a child, I didn't have my child until I came here.  I had him late in life [MN] and, ah, to have him in the public school system it was just -- I'm like [MN] "You're kidding".  I mean, some of the -- the tests and the -- the things they do in the biology department.  The teacher said, "Well, you can pass biology [MN] if you will do a project collecting so many bugs or so many butterflies or so many leaves and you have to do a notebook on it.  If you can do that and pass and turn it in then you can pass biology".
R:  [MN] 
L:  [MN]  I'm like, "What?"  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "Who is this teacher"  [LAUGH]  So, it's -- I mean, it is just -- a lot of the p- parents complain but there are too many of them that do not have the education, [MN] you know, to back why they're complaining.  They don't know where to go to.  They don't have anyone to, um, [LIPSMACK] represent them.  So, it's -- it's frightening.
R:  Yeah, I'm from a big city too and I went to school in a big city so [LIPSMACK] to come in to here where we're living at now -- we're living right outside of Rosemont and it's a really small town.  I don't know if -- have you heard of Asheville, North Carolina?
L:  [MN]  Yes, I have.  I'm trying to think how I know that.  I went to school in Bristol.
R:  Well, we're about fifty miles from Asheville --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- in a little town called Bavard.
L:  [MN]  How close are you to Hickory?
R:  We're right next door.  [LAUGH] 
L:  My brother and sister live in Hickory.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, [LAUGH] well, they'd know exactly where we were at.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  They'll say, "Yeah, I've heard of that little hick town".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I live in a very little hick town.  I live in a place called Phillipi.
R:  I've never heard of that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's -- it's in -- it's, ah, about an hour or so south of Morgantown, West Virginia.  So, it's where the West Virginia University is, if you've ever heard of that.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  WVU?
R:  Yeah, I've heard of that.
L:  If you're into sports most people know of their football team.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I'm not into sports.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I am.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Are you?
R:  Yeah, mostly into the school sport.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, I'm real involved in -- I like to go watch all their sports and my son has graduated high school and he's in the Navy.
L:  Oh.
R:  Right now he's, um, overseas.
L:  Ooh.
R:  Yeah, he graduated from Rosemont High School here and he played several different of their sports here and [MN] we got into it.  My daughter's into it and [MN] those are the only two I have and she'll be graduating next year, so ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I know.  Our babies!  
R:  [MN]  Yeah, I know.
L:  I know how that is.  And your -- where is your son overseas?
R:  He's in the Persian Gulf right now.  
L:  Oh.  
R:  He's on the USS Abraham Lincoln.
L:  Oh, jeeze.
R:  And they were supposed to return on the thirty first of January but they're delayed, of course.
L:  Yes.
R:  So ...
L:  And, how does mom feel about that?
R:  Mom's very upset about that.
L:  Yes.
R:  Very upset.
L:  I would be terrified.
R:  He's, um, he's a nuclear engineer, so, and he's --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- emailed me all the time and -- and tells me, "Mom, I'm safer than you are.  You just don't understand".  [MN] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  Because my emails back to him are, "Son, if you see this helicopter come flying to your -- to your ship don't shoot it down--" [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- because it's your momma".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Right.
R:  "Coming to get you".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  "I'm going to be a cook on the ship just so I can be near you".  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I know, I ask him all the time, "Do you want me to come get you, son?" [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And he'll, "Ha ha", you know, "Yeah, mom, right".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, jeeze.  I just -- I hate the thought of mine -- what, two more years and he'll have to sign up.  [MN] 
R:  They -- they let all the guys on the ship call last weekend [LIPSMACK] and the reason for the phone call was to let all their parents and wives and everything -- let them know that, um, they were getting all their papers together and they were sending them home for, like, next of kin and, you know, all their insurance and all that.  And I'm kind of like, "Eric, I really don't want to hear that".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.
R:  He says, "Well, mom, we don't know when we're going to be coming home and things don't look very good".  [MN] 
L:  [MN]  I know.  I think it's scary for all of us right now.  Are you, um -- are you old enough for the Vietnam war?
R:  No.
L:  Okay.  I am.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  [MN] 
L:  I'm an older mom.  [MN] 
R:  [MN] 
L:  All my brothers but one were in the Vietnam war and my husband was too.  So, I went through all that hoopla and it just -- I hate it.
R:  I do too.
L:  Just, ah, never thought I'd have a child that would be involved in the war.
R:  I never thought I did ei- -- I would either.
L:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK]  Well, I will add you to my prayer list.  [MN] 
R:  Well, thank you very much.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  If that's okay, if you don't mind.
R:  I would love for you to.  [MN] 
L:  What is your son's name?
R:  Eric.
L:  Eric.  Okay.  I have him on the Abraham Lincoln.  I will put him on the prayer list even for church.  We have a couple guys here at our church that are, you know, over there too.  [MN]  But, I will put him on there.  My son is AJ.  
R:  [MN] 
L:  [MN]  How long are we supposed to talk on these things, do you know?
R:  Um, the lady that called me today said that, ah, the voice would come back on and -- the animated voice --
