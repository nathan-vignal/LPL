L:  Hi, my name is Christie.
R:  Hi, I'm Nicole.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?  [MN] 
L:  Good.
R:  Ah --
L:  Good.  The topic is public schools?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  
R:  I --
L:  I work in a public school.
R:  [LAUGH]  I've actually never done one of these before, so ...
L:  Neither have I.  This is my first night.
R:  Yeah, me too.  So, [LAUGH] um, I do-  -- do you know what exactly we're supposed to talk about?  Like --
L:  I think we're [SIGH] we're just supposed to be able to talk and they're going to be looking at maybe the quality of our voices and the effect and -- 'cause they keep in mind where you're calling from.  Like, I'm calling from a cell phone.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, um.
R:  Oh, um, [MN] what was the question?  Do we think there's a problem with the public school system?
L:  Um, yeah, I mean, it's -- it's -- I mean, I -- if we can keep on talking for, like, ten straight minutes I think that'd be fine.  It's -- I don't think they're really looking at content.  I think they're just looking for quality.
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, um, so, um.
R:  Well, I don't -- I thought it was purely based on the topic.  I -- they've been calling me for a while but [MN] if I don't like the topic I don't push the --
L:  You don't go for it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, what interests -- what interests you -- you in the topic for this evening?
R:  I -- well, I just, um -- I just graduated from college and I went through a public school system for most of high school but I was in a magnet school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, my education was a little bit different from most of the rest of the public school system, you know, of schools but [MN] I just -- based on comparis- --comparing our school to the rest of the schools in the city is that the other schools leave much to be desired.
L:  Now, was there a particular focus of the magnet school you went to?
R:  It was overall academics.
L:  Okay.
R:  We have just three -- I think three or four in Nashville that were -- there's one that's, um, for science and technology, one that's for all of academics, one that's for the arts and one's for business. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just went to the overall --
L:  -- academic one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.  [MN]  The school system in, ah -- I'm from Los Angeles -- it's -- it's kind of piecemeal here -- here, you know, it's -- it's either you have a really great school district or you don't and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you live in greater Los Angeles, you know, within the actual city, um, they have magnet schools and they have different focuses [MN], you know, it's whether or not you actually want to go into media and journalism and communications as opposed to science and technology, um, and, I mean, they just -- they have an incredible variety of schools available, um, alternative schools as well, for students who just don't fit the profile of a regular high school student.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Um, and they actually have, I think, it's two campuses devoted to students who, um, it's -- they're for lesbian, you know, bisexual, transgendered, um, you know, they -- they -- they're very tiny programs but it's -- it's available for students who are having issues within, you know, their own system.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And would feel more comfortable in a curriculum that's more geared towards their interests and their concerns.  
R:  [MN]  I guess that's a big difference and Nashville's growing but it's not nearly the size of Los Angeles.  Like, we don't have anywhere --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- close to that variety of -- in programs.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's kind of limited on even being able --
L:  [NOISE] 
R: -- to go to the magnet schools and, you know, the specialized schools.  It is --
L:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I don't know.  It's -- I went to public school, um, and they had, you know, like a gate program, you know.  It's like for -- for students who just, um, you know, just through elementary school and through junior high had, like, an extra curriculum that they would go to or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- be bussed in for, like, you know, a particular morning when w- -- one day a week or something like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that would encourage them.  And those are the students that tended to actually go into advanced placement courses in high school.
R:  Yeah.  We had -- ours was called Encore but it sounds pretty much the same.
L:  Yeah, it's -- everyone calls it a little something different.
R:  Yeah.  But the only thing with those, here they don't -- they're limited I guess because of the locations.  They usually do them outside of the school that you actually go to.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, they have, like, specifications --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for getting in [inaudible].  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I was on the waiting list for Encore for a while before I actually ever went --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, in the meantime, you know, like, I had teachers trying to skip me and so, of course, my mom wanted me to stay with my same --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- age group so when you don't have outside stimulation, you know, you get -- sometimes kids get bored in the classroom.
L:  Yeah, they do. 
R:  So.
L:  They do.
R:  I don't know.  Do you have any of your own kids?
L:  I don't.  I don't.  I finished graduate school last year and, um, you know, haven't had the pleasure of having kids yet. 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So ...
R:  I haven't had to go through it yet but --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I just had one, so ...
L:  How old is the baby?
R:  Ah, she's a week old.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Wow.  Wow.  Was delivery everything you had hoped it would be?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, I did mine natural --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so that was an experience --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but I was only in labor for f- -- about five hours.
L:  Oh, congratulations.
R:  So, yeah, I -- I made it okay but I can't imagine going through that for much longer.
L:  Well, it's -- it's -- I've heard horror stories from the past, you know.  "Six days!"  And --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, you're just, like, going, "No, no, no, no, no, no". 
R:  Yeah.
L:  "I'm never having children", you know.
R:  I had a friend that went through -- I th- -- she did have natural and she -- I think she did -- she went through eighteen hours of labor maybe --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and I was just, I think I might have had a -- I am [LIPSMACK] afraid of -- I just am terrified of needles --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I was not even contemplating an epidural but [MN] I don't know, at that point I might have had to get one.  [MN] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  But, no, hers went really well.  She was small.  She was only five pounds and not quite fourteen ounces so she wasn't real big.  I didn't have to get an episiotomy or anything so --
L:  That's great.
R:  -- mine went pretty well.
L:  Oh, that's good.  You guys were -- I mean, just, you're home now and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- having fun.
R:  We had to stay in hospital for two days I think.  I think when everything is okay and you don't have a C section they keep you for two days as part of [MN] normal hospital policy.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, yeah, we were there for two days but we're back home.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.  Now, th- -- there's a lot of options available now.  Did you just have a birthing room?  Did you stay in there or did you --
R:  They had us in a birthing room and then once I was done and probably about an hour or two later they moved us into just, like, a regular -- well, it was still, I guess -- [MN] it was just on the other side of the hall --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- or the other side of the little office area.  The birthing s- -- suites they call them are huge --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I guess they were just -- they save those for delivery --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then once you get done with delivery they move you to a room that's probably about half to a third of the size.  It's still a decent size but -- 
L:  Mm. [MN] 
R:  -- just I guess they don't y- -- figure you need as much room.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh. 
L:  Oh, it's changed so much more last ten years since -- I used to nanny before I went into college and, you know, it was very sterile and, you know, you actually went into a surgery room and the like and now it's, "Oh, yeah, we've been in the same room" and, you know, we have these big wide chairs so the dads can come and sleep in and --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it's just like going, "he's doing a sleep over?"  Your baby stays in the room with you and [MN] --
R:  Yeah, the -- only --
L:  So.
R:  -- the first night she couldn't stay in the room unless somebody was going to be awake at all times.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, somebody had to be awake.  But after that it didn't matter.  You could call in and get her whenever you wanted and --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- so forth.  I was impressed with the security at the hospital.  They had, um, tags around their -- or some kind of security [MN] little device around their ankles that were wrapped around and then they had arm bands and, ah, or wristbands and ankle bands and they had one on you and the father too and then whenever you dropped them off in the nursery and came to pick them back up they checked your -- your little band to make 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- sure the number matched or whenever you were away from them and came back together --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- they checked the little bands and the little security tag, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- if you -- if it moved, kind of, like, away from the ankle at all I guess it alerts somebody at the front office.
L:  Wow.
R:  And you can't walk around with them in your arms.  You have to put them in those little cart things that they have them in sleeping so [MN] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're pretty [LIPSMACK] -- pretty strict on it.  I guess they've had problems in the past.
L:  [NOISE]  Well, you hear of horror stories of name badges being swapped and things like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and picking up the wrong baby and [MN] so ... [MN] 'cause they all kind of look the same.  They all do and they all don't at the same time and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  So.
R:  Well, I was, like, I am biracial --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he's quite dark but she came out looking a lot like me so she didn't look real similar to most of the babies in there.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So [LAUGH] --
L:  She had a very distinctive look?  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  That one's mine.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.  [MN]  I used to --
L:  That's nice.
R:  -- always be able to kind of look through and tell which one.  She's -- she's really light but, um, she still has -- just has her own look [LIPSMACK], so ...
L:  That's nice.  Mm, that's nice.  So ...
R:  Oh, where did you go to graduate school or what did you do?
L:  UCLA.  I --
