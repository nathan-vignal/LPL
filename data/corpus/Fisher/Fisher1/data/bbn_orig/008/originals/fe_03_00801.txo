R:  Hello
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  My name is David.
L:  Hi David, my name's Debra.  Glad to meet you.
R:  And I'm from Idaho.
L:  Oh, okay, I'm in Colorado.
R:  Okay.  Um --
L:  Although I'm from Pennsylvania, where I guess this study is being done.
R:  And I just moved down here from Pennsylvania.
L:  You did too?  What part?
R:  My wife is from Pennsylvania from Philadelphia --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and we moved from the Pocono's.
L:  Okay, I was on the other side.  I lived, ah, near Pittsburgh.
R:  Yeah, I know guy that lived there in Harrisburg area.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, well, you want to go first?
R:  Um, how about you go first, then I will?
L:  [LAUGH] I'm not sure what -- if I was going to start a business what exactly I would do.  Um, I think it might be something like having to do with, ah, sewing and production of clothing, um, probably specifically kind of modest women's ware and children's ware.
R:  Uh.  Okay.  And -- I -- when you say "modest" you mean more like in the long skirt type thing, or ...?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  Okay.  Um, well I've given this a lot of thought myself, actually because --
L:  You have?  Okay.
R:  --I -- I just got out of military, so --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- and it was kind of an idea to start my own business, but I think I would probably go into the real estate business --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, due to the fact that there is a lot of people that are -- are in need of homes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think that I would use the cash that I had available to purchase homes for people that, you know, cannot purchase homes, like, you know, they have bad credit or, you know, for some unforeseen thing, they can't purchase homes, I'll provide them a home, you know, and like, on a lease option type purchase type thing, and you know, that --
L:  Right.  That gives them a chance to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- get on their feet.
R:  Yep, and I mean, I've gone so far as, you know, to think in my head, you know, an architectural structure of my subdivision type thing, you know.
L:  Oh yeah?  What kind of homes?  My dad was in construction --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- my whole growing up years, so ...
R:  I was thinking more of a type of a, probably a three bedroom type bi-level home.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, not duplex.  I don't want a duplex type, but, you know, single homes --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and um, not too many people living in the sub division, you know, kind of structured down, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, and then, you know, like, maybe a ah, like a church and a small shopping grocery store or something, right in the subdivision so the people didn't have to, you know, go outside the subdivision to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- do all that big stuff.
L:  You'd like to make it more of a community rather than just a --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- a h- housing development.
R:  Yep, and to make sure that there's a service center on --in the subdivision too, that, you know, has like, all the health and welfare benefit people and you know, some- someone that knows all that stuff to help them out, you know, when they need their help.
L:  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  Well, you've thought about this a lot it sounds like. [LAUGH]
R:  Well I have, you know, and, you know, it's about going to the SPA and looking for, you know, funding, I think, so ...
L:  Yeah, now for me, this, you know, the subject was [inaudible].  It's not something I've given much thought to.  I had a little business of my own, but it was just -- it was just me, basically [LAUGH] doing some legal research, and I had to set it up as a little business, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because I was, um, contract employed, basically.
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so, and that was sort of fun --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- but my -- my only big customer, um, went automated, well, they didn't so much, they al- already were but the court where I was doing work went automated, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it didn't really need a body there any more.  They could get most of everything over the internet, so ...
R:  Yep.
L:  I was out. [LAUGH]
R:  The wonderful age of technology, I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A lot of people lose their jobs that way.
L:  It didn't break my heart or anything. [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.  I have that thought[?].  But, um, I guess the second part was, do you think you will be successful, I think? [PAUSE] Hello?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah, I'm -- I'm asking --
L:  I was waiting for you.
R:  -- if you -- I'm asking do you think that you would be successful in that business?
L:  Oh, that I would be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, [LAUGH] I don't know.  I'm, um, oh, I don't know.  I c- I've never thought of setting up a business from the whole money side of it.  I think of it more in terms of what I'd like to end up with, to produce.
R:  Right.
L:  The service and, um, so, I guess I'd have to measure success in actually making some money. [LAUGH] I'm not sure.  I -- I don't know.  I'd have to just give it a try.  I'd probably have to start real small --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and um, because my sewing is -- is slow, I'd probably have to get help, because, um, I'm just way too particular and I think --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] I told my husband once, you know, if I ever sewed to make money, I'd make about a nickel an hour just 'cause I'm so darned slow.
R:  Right.
L:  So -- so it might not be the most practical thing for me, but if I -- if it was a little bigger than just me and there were other people sewing and they could keep me from getting hung up on all the tiny details, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- then maybe it would work.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I'd -- if I was going to do something like that, probably it would be an internet business, something very small, you know.
R:  Yeah.  You know, that's the way to go right now, I mean, there's, um, the internet side is, because, I mean, people are just making boo[?] goo[?] bucks on the internet, you know.
L:  Yeah, and, you know, and -- and you can do a whole business or whatever, and not even have to get dressed up, you know.
R:  Oh yeah.  I mean --
L:  You can just be sitting there in your sweats, or whatever [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, somebody says, "I would like this skirt made", you know, and okay, well, you know, it's done in a week, you know, something like that, you know,
L:  Yeah, exactly.  And -- and you mail it and you don't have to have a shop and --
R:  You really don't even have to mail it, you know, just kind of like, UPS, or, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- American, they just kind of say, okay, you know --
L:  Yeah, they'll come to the house.
R:  -- we'll box it and everything for you, you know.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  So ...
L:  And -- so then -- then what you could do is, in that kind of business, is you'd focus on your end product and focus on dealing with the customer --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and not focus so much on all the hiring, firing, you know, all the stuff you need with a real store.
R:  Yeah.  And I look at myself, you know, and I -- I think that I'd probably fail miserably.
L:  [LAUGH] Do you?
R:  Not because -- it's not because I don't think that I would make money or anything, it's just because I care too much about people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and some times you can't do that and with the type of business that I want to do -- th- the type of thing that I'd want to get into, you know, is always caring about people.
L:  Right.
R:  And I'd probably let them get away with a lot more than what I should.
L:  Yeah, I can see what you mean.
R:  To where I was losing money.
L:  Yeah, the way you would be setting that up would be to help them, basically, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, that's a -- that's a very nice thing to do, but yeah, but there's not usually much money in it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and, that's exactly my point --
L:  It's kind of the problem with the sewing business, too, I'd want to provide these at good prices for people, and 'cause I have friends who home school and whatever and this is how they like to dress and none of them have any money --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, as far as a business making money, ah, maybe you and I aren't cut out for it. [LAUGH] I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I'm -- I mean, my wife tells me that all the time, you're too nice and I'm, like, well, you know, but ah, I guess if I give, God will give back to me, that's how I believe, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  --but yep, I don't know.  I'd pr- but I'd probably fail miserably --
L:  Well --
R:  -- because of the fact that I would just --
L:  Well, you might not though, because you've been actually thinking about this.
R:  I have been thinking about it and I'd try, you know, I got it all planned out, you know, but it's all about funding and, you know, finding places to take care of people.
L:  It is, but your wife would be a nice balance to you, because i- if you're going too far on the not -- you know, not let -- making people pay their payments or do whatever they're supposed to do, she might be in the background saying, "Now, David, you have to [LAUGH] send them a bill".
R:  Yeah, she would probably, once I got it all set up, tell me that I have to find someone else to run it.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  So.  Yeah, that'd probably --
L:  That would be her advice, then?
R:  Oh yeah, that'd be her advice on it.
L:  I think it sounds like you and I, neither of us are business people, per se. [COUGH]  We have ideas for things we'd like to do, but I don't think either of us has what you could call a real business plan or [LAUGH] anything.
R:  No, I'd probably have to sit down and think about it even -- even -- an- even more, but --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- no business plan though.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Nope, just kind of, it's kind of like, fly by the hip type thing.
L:  Yeah, yeah, so, well --
R:  Well ...
L:  -- what else shall we say about that? [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.
L:  Is this your first, ah, of the ...?
R:  This is my first.  Is it your first?
L:  Yes, it is.  I ju- I'd never heard of it till today.
R:  Oh, my wife signed me up --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a couple of days ago, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I was, like, well, I guess I will do it, you know.
L:  Yeah, oh, there's nothing to lose and it -- it's kind of fun to talk to people about --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- something that someone assigns you to talk about.
R:  Right.  Well.
L:  So.  H- How do we know when we're done?  I think they tell us, or something.
R:  Um, I believe so.
L:  Okay.
R:  But, I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But --
L:  So what kind of --
R:  -- so we don't think that we'd be very good business people.
L:  Um, probably not. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And your product --
L:  I think our hearts are both in the right place, but I don't think our um, business savvy is maybe in place. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  You probably, like, find some people to do that stuff for you though and just, like, supervise on those types of things, you know, and expect your product to be top notch.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that'd probably make your business probably more successful, if you weren't directly involved yourself.
L:  Yes, or not so -- yes -- i- if you weren't at least alone --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and you had someone else to say, you got to be a little more practical here [LAUGH]
R:  But I mean, your business idea is a great idea because, I mean, there's people selling, you know, baked beans on the internet right now --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, so, it's very feasible.
L:  Well, and I know a lot -- a lot of Christian women who are kind of tired of the clothes that are available --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, um, it -- it's not easy to find clothing that most of us would consider modest.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, the lengths come and go in style, so th- you know, a long jumper, for instance, might be in style for a while but then the style will change so that it has slits way up the leg and [LAUGH] you know --
R:  Right, oh yeah.
L:  -- it's -- and then suddenly you can't buy what you need, so I think that's why a little business like that can be useful because it -- it's kind of got its own little niche market.
R:  Either that or you're probably the right market for it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You've got to promote it a little bit.
L:  Yeah, and you know, probably if I were ever going to actually do it I'd probably promote it through home schooling friends and through some, um, Christian magazine.
