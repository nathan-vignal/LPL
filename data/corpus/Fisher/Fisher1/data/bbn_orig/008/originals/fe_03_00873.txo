L:  [LIPSMACK] Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Oh, go ahead.
R:  Hello, go -- no, go ahead, go ahead.
L:  Ah, my name's Rochelle.
R:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] Ah, I'm Chris.
L:  Hi.
R:  [COUGH] [SIGH]
L:  Do you have any strong feelings about affirmative action?
R:  Not -- not particularly.  I was kind of hoping they'd pick the video game topic today.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah I [LAUGH] -- it would have been nicer, a lighter topic.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, I don't really have a whole lot of knowledge on this particular issue to be honest with you.
L:  Really?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] ah, not sure exactly.  I know it has something to do with -- with quotas and what not --
L:  Right.
R:  -- based on, um, [LIPSMACK], ah, either -- either racial or gender or -- or any sort of protected class --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but other than that I'm not really sure how it works.  [COUGH] 
L:  Mm.  Well, I mean, as a woman, I guess -- I guess if you were to think about it, I don't think I should really be given preference over a male if he's equally suited for the position.  I mean, I'm positive I've probably been discriminated against in the workforce.  I mean, sometimes maybe because someone was a male and they thought perhaps, ah, he would have been better suited and -- but then people discriminate because of your looks or your weight --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or your, ah, maybe you have children and they don't want children and I think there are so many different forms of discrimination that, you know, wh- -- where would it end?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Do you know what I'm saying?  Like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- where would you -- would you have quotas for everything?  I mean [LAUGH] --
R:  Right, right.
L:  I think --
R:  Do you ever feel like, ah --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- do you ever feel like you've been discriminated against because you were in a certain cat- -- category or not or -- or perhaps you were better qualified but there should have been something in place?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, no, because I feel that had people been forced to hire me I think that politics would have gotten me in the end.  I mean, I think if you're not really welcome some place --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in -- in a particular environment that you probably wouldn't be happy there or that there'd probably be continual road blocks in your way or --
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know?
R:  There'd be a lot of hostility for sure.
L:  I wouldn't feel comfortable if I wasn't really welcomed.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  I think that there's so many -- I mean, there are corporate -- you know, every -- everyone feels different in different work places.  I mean, I'm sure, you know, I don't know what your experience is but there are some companies that, you know, where you mesh better with certain people and I think there are others where you just don't and --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- it kind of works out that way.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  I don't guess I've ever been in a situation where I've been -- [LIPSMACK] there was one job where --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- maybe I felt a little bit out of place --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but there wouldn't -- wasn't anybody -- any sort of particular class.  Everybody was white, everybody was male --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Ah, this was when I was working on shore so there were --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there was exactly one female --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, on one of the rigs that I was on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Other than that -- but --
L:  So was it a male industry?  Is that why they were all males?  It was a male domin- --
R:  Pretty much.  It -- it's very difficult for them to integrate.  Um --
L:  Why is that?
R:  Ah, prob- -- mainly because the rigs are so small because [COUGH] when you're dealing with something like -- like the military for instance --
L:  Oh, right, right.
R:  -- um, you've got large numbers of people and it's very easy, relatively easy, to -- to take one -- yeah, well, this particular barracks and make it male and this particular barracks --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and make it female.
L:  Right.
R:  But if you're on an oil rig --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you're talking twenty to sixty people at the most --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and the one -- the one area they've been able to integrate is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is in the company that I worked for was, ah, they had a safety rep position.  That individual had their own room --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with their own bathroom, whatever, shower, or whatever you want to call it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it was very easy for them.  But -- but to have them -- the rest of the living quarters converted it's just not cost effective.  It's not practical --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- on -- on such a small installation.
L:  Mm.  [MN] 
R:  Other than that --
L:  Well, I could see that.  You know it's funny, 'cause I worked for a military, um [LIPSMACK] -- well they built military -- they built ships for the military --
R:  Oh, okay, sweet[?].
L:  -- and, um, it was mostly males.  I mean, they were mostly males there.  But, um, I mean, I don't know what their policy was on hiring.  I -- I th- -- I just felt that it was basically male because those were the, um, there was one woman there who was working in the same department as me and I think there was only about three women on the whole floor and, um, I don't know whether there was lack of interest on the part of other women, why there weren't more women, but I didn't feel discriminated against at all.
R:  [MN]  Were you all in an office environment or were you all out --
L:  Yeah, it was an office environment.  I felt very comfortable.  I didn't feel uncomfortable.  So, I don't -- I mean, I -- I think also there are certain fields that females tend to gravitate to more than males and --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- vice versa and I -- I -- I just, um, [MN], I don't know.  I think -- I -- I don't -- I don't feel that -- I think that people really want something they usually can -- they can get it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in this day and age.  I don't think that it -- that there are that many barriers any more.  I mean ...
R:  So, that s- -- pretty much seems to be, ah, kind of the way things are across the board.  I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when I was off shore I didn't -- I didn't see any hostility --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- towards the idea of having women on the rigs.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, as long as they could do the job was -- was the predominant attitude.  [MN] Um, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I can't really think of any other job.  Of course, I've -- I've done a variety of different environments and I can't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really think of anything.
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  -- than --
L:  You know, I see -- you know, the -- the -- just the recent space launch, you know, as tragic as it was, it was a mix of different types of people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I don't think that there, you know, are the barriers that there used to be.  I think that, you know, people are finding a way to get what they want without having to meet quotas.  I mean, [LIPSMACK] I don't really -- yeah ...
R:  Do you think there's anything -- any type of work environment where a certain category of individuals shouldn't be in that environment?
L:  What do you mean by that?
R:  Um, [COUGH] like, for instance, ah, I don't know.  I guess -- I guess I can't really think of anything either, um --
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, like, say if somebody felt that women shouldn't be off shore, that -- that kind of thing, um --
L:  Well ...
R:  -- or -- or for instance women -- women going into combat and you -- you have --
L:  I know.
R:  -- [several inaudible words]
L:  Well, I -- I don't know because I -- they always say, well, you know, in Israel women serve in the army --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] and [MN] I don't know really what capacity it's based -- serve fully or not --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, I don't know.  I mean, I -- I really haven't thought about that.
R:  Honestly that's the only thing I can --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- think of that -- that anybody bothers to say, look --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- this group isn't welcome.  [LIPSMACK]  From what I understand --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- women -- women still aren't officially allowed but every now and again somebody sort of shows up in a situation.  You know, a woman goes into the army --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she ends up in a situation, you know -- of course, when you go into the army you're trained as a soldier.  I don't think they train women not to fight --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [COUGH] and I think situations arrive where, ah, a female ends up in a combat situation and -- and she's a soldier, she has to do what she has --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to do.  
L:  Right.  
R:  So, I don't know.
L:  But is it -- but today with the, ah, you know, all the technology --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I d- -- well, I think women will be able to serve in a much more expanded category --
R:  Right.
L:  -- of combat.  I don't know about, you know, physically when they get to the land and it's more --
R:  There's -- there's much more --
L:  -- front line.
R:  -- somebody to sit at a consul and push a button.  Is that the --
L:  Yeah, I mean, right.  I mean, if you're using technology and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- behind the scenes or up to a certain point where you're not really, you know, face to face where you're almost like down at the, um, already after you're -- you've, you know, like, say, we went to Iraq and we were suddenly, you know, when you're doing it from above, from the air and sea, it's not the same as when you're in -- on land and you have foot soldiers and I think, you know, when you get into the foot soldier category I think it might be a little different.
R:  Right.  Do you think that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the military ought to give the more desk orientated jobs to, like, say, if they want to prohibit --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah -- say, if they want to prevent women from actually going in -- in as ground troops, they don't want women on the ground with a rifle --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the same as men.  Should they give more of the desk jobs, the -- the consul, sort of button pushing jobs to women, do you think?
L:  Well, that might be discrimination though.
R:  Ah, I think that kind of comes back --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to the area towards controversial.
L:  Right.
R:  You've got just as many women want to join the army as men, for instance, maybe there's not as many -- many opportunities.
L:  Mm.
R:  I don't think so.  I'm sort of playing devil's advocate --
L:  I know.
R:  -- here now.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I don't -- I don't know --
R:  Trying to keep this going.
L:  -- I mean, I've never really thought about that.  I don't, ah, I don't really know.  I, like, you know --
