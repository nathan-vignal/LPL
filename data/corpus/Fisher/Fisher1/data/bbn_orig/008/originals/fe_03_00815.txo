L:  Denise.
R:  Hi, this is Helen.
L:  Hello.
R:  How are you?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  I'm fine
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay, we're supposed to talk about if we can go back in time and change things, eh?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Let's see, [PAUSE] I think I would have majored something different in school.
L:  That's what I said before, when they called, that I would have tried to do better in school, get better grades.
R:  Oh, what I meant was, ah, my major in college --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I majored in business.
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I'm not liking it too much [LAUGH] that's all.
L:  Oh really. [LAUGH] Let's see, if I had went to college I would have went for business.
R:  Would you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, at the time that was -- that was the counselor's advice --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that was where it was at.  That was where the money is, and I guess, to a certain extent, um, now also, but I -- I find my natural liking is -- is more towards art, you know, something more artistic.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, maybe fashion design or -- or something with sketching.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Things like that.  How about you?
L:  I pr- if I would have went to college I probably would have went to run a business.  That is probably what I definitely would have done.
R:  Mm.
L:  But if I could go back I probably would have done that.
R:  And change something.
L:  Because I would like to own my own business.
R:  What -- what do you think you would have done?
L:  Probably a restaurant or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Do you like to cook or you just like to eat, or both?
L:  Both. [LAUGH] I'm a good cook and a good eater. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I don't know anybody who went to culinary school, did you?
L:  Ah, the one guy that my husband works with just went to culinary school.
R:  Mm. Was it in town[?]?
L:  I though that was, sort of funny because I never heard of a guy going before, but, he's doing pretty good at it.
R:  How many years do you have to go?
L:  I think he said two years, maybe.  He had to go to that -- the school in New York for two years and then I don't know what he had to do after that.
R:  The institute?  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think they do is -- they sort of, like, intern at um, restaurants, sort of like assistants or whatever.
L:  Oh that'd be -- that'd be fun.
R:  Yeah, because, you know, my friends were telling me about this French restaurant, somewhere in Queens -- ah, where do you live?
L:  Pennsylvania.
R:  Okay, I live in New York and --
L:  Oh, we're not that far away from each other.
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's freezing out today. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh yeah, I just told my kids, "Go up in the loft and play". 
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  Because I didn't even want them outside, it's too cold.
R:  It's so windy my ears were like, burning.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I didn't wear a hat.  But um, oh, there's this restaurant, he said, that's in Queens, where on certain nights, they have dinners that are -- are --s- they're supposedly a hundred dollar dinners but they're prepared by students.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it's sort of like a quarter of the price, and he said it's seriously like, gourmet, it's delicious.
L:  Mm.  
R:  Though I think they probably do a --
L:  It's probably from that school that he went -- that my friend's going to that --
R:  Yeah, apprenticeship.
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and things like that, and that's great.
L:  Ha.
R:  I don't know, I -- I just think I would have majored in something different.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, like, done a totally different field because this is too boring.  Or not boring, I guess I'm just tired of it.
L:  You need a change.
R:  Yes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Can you think of anything else?
L:  No, I can't.
R:  I know.  That's a very hard question.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I'm glad that we're both having a hard time because it's sort of like, we have no regrets. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  All right.  Do, I guess, that's --
R:  Are we supposed to talk -- no I think we're supposed to talk until the robot comes on.
L:  Oh.
R:  Is this your first time speaking?
L:  This is my third time.
R:  Oh, this is my first.
L:  The lady before this just said we had to wait for a robot, but a robot never came on.
R:  Oh, because it hasn't been, ah, ten minutes yet.  I've been timing us.  It's only been --
L:  Oh, let's just keep talking and see what happens.
R:  Yeah, it's only been, like, six minutes.
L:  Do you have any kids?
R:  Um, yes, I have one daughter.  She's five.
L:  I have a little boy, seven and a half and a little girl, eighteen months.
R:  Oh, how sweet, so I know you're busy.
L:  Yep, the little girl was a surprise because my son was -- my husband was in a bad car accident and they said he wouldn't be able to have kids.
R:  Oh, my God, that's really a surprise.
L:  Yeah, isn't it?  Surprise, surprise, here she came.
R:  Oh, I'm sure she's adorable.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Keeps you busy, huh?
L:  Oh, she keeps my son in line.
R:  [LAUGH] I'm, um, let me see.  They told us to stick to the topic, so, what else? [PAUSE]
L:  I don't think there's anything else that I would have changed.  I've got a good husband, two good kids.
R:  That's great.  My husband's great too.  Hm.  If I could have, maybe I would have bought a home in a different area.
L:  You don't like New York or your do?
R:  Oh, I do like New York, but the area --
L:  In a different area.
R:  -- in New York that I -- I preferred I couldn't afford, you know, but that -- that's, I don't know if that would count, because it's like, financial.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um [PAUSE] Do you like Pennsylvania?
L:  I like Virginia Beach, myself.
R:  Yeah?  How -- have you --
L:  I keep telling my husband, why don't -- why don't we just move down there and find a job down there but, hell, his family's up here.
R:  Yeah.  All my family's in New York.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I have some aunts and uncles in California but that really doesn't count.
L:  My sister lives in California.  She's married to a guy in the Navy.
R:  Oh, where does she live?
L:  Chula Vista, it's ten minutes away from the boarder.
R:  Of Mexico?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, my sister was there for ten years in, ah, Walnut Creek, which is outside of San Francisco.
L:  See, my sister's right outside of San Diego.
R:  Yes, that's a nice area.
L:  I loved it when I went down there.
R:  Beautiful.  Perfect weather.
L:  Uh-huh.  I think it rained two days when we were there.  She said it hardly ever rains.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I said, wow, I wish -- I'd even move out there, but then with the earthquakes, I don't know.
R:  Oh, she was there for that earthquake where all the highways fell.
L:  Mhm. I -- I --
R:  She was --
L:  -- I went out there right after that when they were reconstructing the highway.
R:  She was there for something else, too, and ah, something else that happened there.  I don't remember.
L:  I know they had, like, a lot of mudslides and stuff.
R:  Yeah, the forest fires et cetera.  So, this is your third time doing this?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yep.
R:  Do you find it easy?
L:  Yeah.  And you know, it al- the phone always rings as soon as my kids go up in the loft so they don't even bother me.
R:  Perfect.  You know, I just signed up today and I'm -- I'm surprised that I get, ah --
L:  Wow, that was quick.
R:  Just today.  I got my pin today, interestingly, they called me, like, two minutes before two --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because that's the time I said I would be available, but I wasn't at my desk.  I'm at work right now.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Because they left a -- a voice mail and they called me back and I said, oh my God, I guess they keep calling until they, ah, get ya.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I put down from two to five and --
R:  That's what I did.
L:  -- usually they -- they call at two, three and four.
R:  Oh.
L:  Because they called me like, well, five after two and then they called now and they'll probably call again.
R:  Mhm.  Mm.  Okay, Denise, anything else?
L:  Nope.
R:  I think -- I think I got married at the right age.  I was much older, I --
L:  I waited till I was thirty to get married.
R:  Oh.  I waited till I was twenty -- almost twenty seven.  But I have been working.
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- since I graduated, I have my own apartment, so I think I -- I -- I didn't jump from the nest to being married --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, which I thought was important, help me to grow up, help me to become a little bit more responsible.  Um, what else can I say?  Love my parents.  I don't know.  Well, according to my clock it's been like, nine minutes.
L:  Well, we'll wait another couple of seconds and see what happens.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, after ten minutes we'll just hang up.
R:  Okay.  Um, did you ever hear the robot come on?
L:  No.
R:  Really.  Ah, did you ever time it, or the other person timed it?
L:  Um, nobody timed it the first time that I was on it, the lady said as soon as you're done talking to just hang up.
R:  Really?  I didn't get a recording, I just got, ah, the email.
L:  That's all I got, too.
R:  Yeah, and it said the robot'll come on.  Let's me see, I can bring it up right now. 
L:  That's what the lady tried doing before. [PAUSE] Well, actually, this is nice because you get to meet different people from different areas.
R:  Oh, yeah, I love it.  You're a stay at home mom, I guess?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You love it?
L:  I worked with my son -- my husband used to stay home and watch him while I worked, because I was a manager at McDonalds --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And it just didn't work.
R:  No?  Did he have a job, or was he a house husband?
L:  He worked from like, nine until five and then he'd come home and I'd go from five until three in the morning.
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  So, it -- it just didn't work out, and then when my husband got hurt I had to put him in daycare and I had to go back to work.  So it wasn't fun.  But now everything's starting to come away.  We're getting ready to buy a house, hopefully.
R:  Oh, wonderful.
