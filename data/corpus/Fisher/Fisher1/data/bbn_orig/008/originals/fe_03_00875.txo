R:  Hey, this is Andy.
L:  Hi, this is Denise.
R:  Hello.  How are you?
L:  Fine, thank you.
R:  Good.  [MN]  Ah, affirmative action?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  [MN] Um, well, I'm a white male --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- ah, so I don't know that-- I mean, th- --just so you know that.
L:  Okay, thank you.
R:  Um, my feeling is, um, that America, although it is a great country, has lots of problems with -- with, ah, race, um, [LIPSMACK] and that, ah, historically, ah, minorities and African Americans have, um, [MN] been kept out of the economic pie by people like me, the sort of entitled white male --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and I think affirmative action is a reasonable way of trying to remedy a, um -- [LIPSMACK] a social and historical, ah, inequality in our society.
L:  Okay, well, that's -- that's pretty accurate.  So, I mean, do you agree, you know, that you should have it or d- -- do you disagree that?
R:  Oh, I'm all for it, yeah.
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  Yeah.  No, I -- I sort of feel like if you're -- if you -- if you're -- if you're white, most white people have never been discriminated against --
L:  Mm.
R:  --and have never -- don't know what it feels like to be --
L:  True, very true.
R:  -- denied opportunities.  So, um, I totally understand how, um, you know, if you think, like, back in nineteen twenty six if a white guy and an African American were applying for a job the boss would have been white and he would have given it to the white guy.
L:  All right, ah, just so you know, I'm an African American female.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, basically in nineteen twenty six you could have raped me and I couldn't do a thing about it.
R:  Sure, sure.  Um, and I think -- I think -- that there's been this twist where the other -- the other kind of difficult part is [MN] America believes in -- in sort of, um, in individuality and that you should -- people should be free to -- to try to get what they want in the world [MN] so in some ways they see affirmative action as giving someone a favor, giving someone a little [MN] extra than somebody else.
L:  No.
R:  But I think that's totally the wrong way to look at it because in -- if -- if this were a hundred yard dash white people would be twenty yards away from the start line -- from the finish line at the beginning and everybody else would be way far behind.
L:  True.
R:  So, affirmative action is just an attempt to even the playing field, [MN] ah, for -- for people.  So, I don't -- I -- I mean, I understand --
L:  So, how do you feel about this whole thing -- this whole controversy going on about Bush trying to get rid of affirmative action?
R:  [MN]  Ah, I dislike Bush very much.
L:  So, am I going to see you February -- I mean, um, April first, in Washington DC?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Am I going to see you on April first in Washington DC protesting --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- for affirmative action?
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Ahah.
R:  I don't think I'll be there but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but, ah, m- -- but my sympathies will be allied with -- with the movement.  Um --
L:  Oh, well, thank you so much.
R:  Sure.
L:  I mean, you being a white man --
R:  Yes, well, I'm also --
L:  -- and everything, so, thanks.
R:  Yes, well, I'm also against -- I'm also against the war in Iraq but, um, I think it's going to happen whether or not I protest it so ...  But that's -- that's a whole different thing is I -- I -- I -- sometimes, you know, I'm -- I'm sor- -- I'm forty and I've -- I'm not young any more and back in my -- my early days I would've see political action as a viable solution but [MN] not any more.  It's like --
L:  [MN] Well, I'm going to be there on April first because --
R:  Well, I think that's good.
L:  I mean, I'm a graduate student and I plan on being a graduate student for, ah, you know, m- many more years since I plan on getting my Ph D.
R:  Sure.
L:  And as an African American and as a woman I have two strikes against me.  
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, it's not just African Americans, you know, who should be worried anyway and -- you know, it should be women as well.
R:  Oh, no, I agree, I agree --
L:  You know, because --
R:  -- 'cause there's a whole glass ceiling.
L:  So, I mean, just me being, you know, double -- I have two strikes against me plus I have a disability so I'm -- I'm a disabled black woman.  I mean, it's going to be really difficult for me --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- in life and I want to make sure that, you know, I -- everything is taken care of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and right now that's threatened, you know, and -- and [LIPSMACK] I'm scared for myself, I'm scared for my friends who are also in professional schools.  How is that going to affect graduate students?  You know, are we going to have that chance, you know, to get an education?  
R:  Right, I agree.
L:  To get into the schools, to get the money, you know, to pay for the schools? 
R:  Sure.
L:  Am I going to have a job after I'm done with my school?  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] I mean, those are things that we have to think about.
R:  Right.  And I think -- I think the ADA too, um, is -- is sort of -- I think -- I think our society is big enough and strong enough to take -- for everyone to take care of everyone and it's not just -- the American dream is not just getting your slice of the pie [MN] but having sort of an equitable society in which [MN] -- in which everyone can be free, everyone can have equal opportunity.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  Ah, Chicago.
L:  Okay, 'cause you're not from the south.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  No, actually --
L:  You're not from the south.
R:  I was born in Baltimore, um, which is -- which, I -- I always think of Baltimore as being more a southern city than an eastern city.  I think a lot of people think that Maryland's on the east coast [MN] which it is --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but really it's more like Charleston and [MN] -- and cities in the south.  It's very -- people there are very s- -- they talk slowly and they just have a very laid back opinion.  But, um, yeah, I -- so I sort of feel like with the ADA, having cut downs on streets, making accommodations for people, having -- making sure that restaurants have bathrooms big enough for people to get into with a wheel chair, I don't see how that, like -- I -- I see that as a positive thing that doesn't mean you lose your slice of the pie by helping somebody else.  [MN] And I think it's the same thing with affirmative action is that [MN] there -- there are -- there has been a history of the people in power keeping opportunities from minorities and all this is is simply an attempt to, um, to try to at least for a while level it off and maybe, [MN] you know, maybe forty years from now we'll say, "Okay, things are more level, things are more even", but it just -- it just strikes me as funny that you have all these -- these -- these rich white people who say, "Oh, you know, this is terrible, this is against America".  And it's like, y- -- what you've been doing is against America -- th- -- the ideal of America -- for three hundred years.  So I always -- I always find the sort of -- the argument about affirmative action, um --
L:  Did you have, like, black friends or --
R:  I do --
L:  -- only white friends?  
R:  I do have black friends.
L:  You haven't -- so, you -- but you -- so you have white and non white friends?
R:  Yes, yes.  I also --
L:  For a long time or ...?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I think, I mean, I grew up in the -- in the suburbs of Chicago, I mean, and we moved from Baltimore when I was, like, seven and they were mostly white but, um, I think, uh, you know, [MN] I just think, uh, I -- I know, I mean I --
L:  Well, did you have friends in high school? 
R:  Oh yeah, yeah.
L:  Black friends, I mean?
R:  Yeah, I actually -- I had a, um, a friend that I went to, um, homecoming dance with and she was African American.
L:  Ooh.
R:  And she actually ended up working for Jerry Springer of all things.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But she's like a -- she's like a talk show, um, producer now.  [MN] But, um, I sort of --
L:  That must've been a big thing for you though back in the day.
R:  Yeah, well, I think it was [MN] -- she was, yeah, it was -- it was [MN] -- the, ah -- we grew up in a very sort of liberal area so it wasn't so much like, you know, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, The Westside Story or something like that but --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- um, but I think too that in -- just in my family of origin that my parents were -- were kind of, ah, not very good parents and I sort of know, you know, what it's like to -- to, um, sort of be in a situation that's uncomfortable and that [MN] -- that could be made different just by changing some things around so I've always -- I mean, I've always had the sense that, like --
L:  So, you are compassionate?
R:  Yes, yes.  Um, and I don- -- and I -- I think affirmative action is a -- a sort of realistic and -- and, um, you know, governmental, albeit social, way of trying to address some of those issues, so, um ...  [LIPSMACK] I also teach ESL.
L:  Oh, that's my major.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I'm -- I'm guessing a lot of us are going to be in that.  So, you know, I work with -- with lots of, you know, now it's -- it's -- it's not even true to say that they're minorities any more because, ah, the face of, ah, the United States is changing so much that [MN] -- that [MN] soon it'll be there's -- it's going to be like -- there's going to be a third Hispanic, you know, twenty five per cent Asian, twenty five per cent, um, African American and -- and twenty per cent white and there won't be any -- there won't be any majority.  It'll all be, you know, like quarters or something.  [MN]  So, um --
L:  Well, I -- I mean, so, like, so that -- so you're -- you're comfortable with that, I mean, obviously because, um, of your profession.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  So, you kind of grew up with that and so, you know, and you feel a -- a particular compassion for --
R:  I -- I think so.
L:  -- non white people.
R:  Sure, sure.  And it's, you know, I think that is one of the [MN] -- America has some problems, America has some bad things about it [MN] but it does have some basic core beliefs and -- and I think one of those -- one of those beliefs are that people are, you know, hopefully that you can deal with people as if they're equal to you, that [MN] -- that you can --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- that you're free to get -- to try to get what you want and other people are free to try to get what they want and -- you know, in -- within reason [MN] and, um, you know --
L:  You know, I must say, I am very -- I'm -- I'm surprised.  And maybe that's a little disturbing but I'm -- I'm -- I'm surprised to -- to be listening to a white man -- white man have such compassion for, you know, minorities.
R:  Um --
L:  [LIPSMACK] I mean, 'cause you're being realistic, you know, also.
R:  Right.
L:  But, I mean, I'm -- I'm surprised, I'm very surprised.  
R:  Well, I think, it -- it kind of depends too what [MN] -- so what's your experience with -- where did you grow up?
L:  I mean, I grew up in -- in white suburbia.  I was born in Brooklyn [MN] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and my mother decided to move out to Long Island to make sure that we, you know, received a good education.
R:  Right.
L:  In particular because my parents aren't from this country.  Okay? 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, my parents are immigrants.
R:  Sure, where're they from?
L:  Um, South America.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, they moved to Brooklyn, decided it wasn't good enough.  They moved out and I -- I grew up around white people.
R:  Right.
L:  I had a great education which was m- -- you know, what my mother wanted but, [MN] you know, I grew up w- -- with white people --
R:  Did you feel --
L:  -- and --
R:  Did you feel -- did you feel like you were discriminated against? 
L:  I mean, I felt like I was the mascot of my grade --
R:  Right.
L:  -- 'cause I was
