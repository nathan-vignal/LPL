R:  [MN]  Hello, my name's David. [MN]
L:  Hello. David.  Hi.  My name is Shannon.
R:  Hi Shannon.  [MN] 
L:  Um, I'm a first time caller I guess, so ...
R:  Me too.
L:  Oh, okay.  Good.  Um, well, I guess, we're talking about public schools.  I'm -- I'm driving home right now so, um, hopefully I won't get cut off.
R:  Okay.  I hope so.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah.  Um, do you have an opinion?
R:  [MN]  Yeah, uh, public schools, um, I've studied a little bit about education and, um, [MN]  I -- I think certainly they have flaws.  Um [MN], the -- just with the general distribution of resources, um.  [LIPSMACK]  Be-  -- because most schools are funded by property tax [MN] if a region is poor they can fund the school less, um, [MN] and that results in great [MN] inequality, um [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Between the different districts?
R:  Yeah.  [MN] 
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, I think that's, uh, a -- a big problem, ah, that we have to deal with and [LIPSMACK] um, in my -- in my class anyway if a ch- -- charter schools and the -- the private school [inaudible] programs that have been discussed [MN] and, um -- by politicians and by my school being very liberal, um, were sort of against them because they thought it perpetuated the inequalities of various regions.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  So, by charter schools do you mean, um, schools that the parents get money from the government and are able to choose their own schools or --
R:  [MN] Well, right.
L:  Is that a charter school?
R:  [MN]  Yeah, it's, um, it's, um, it's a school not run by the town or the state but an independent organization coming in --
L:  Okay.
R:  Um --
L:  Bigger private school then?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, [MN] and I guess the plan that, ah, the government was talking about a while ago was to give a -- a -- a tax credit of some sort to, um, parents who -- who chose to send their children to charter schools.  Um, the problem with it was that, um, the tax credit wouldn't be equal for people of all classes obviously because people of different classes pay different amounts of tax and they --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- wouldn't really help the poorer classes to get their children out of poor public schools and into the better --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- presumably better charter schools.  [MN] 
L:  So, ah, what stage are you in?  What -- was there something that was offered at the federal level or by state?
R:  I think it was a -- a federal thing.  Ah, [MN] I must admit that was before I was very politically aware [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay, because I -- I'm in California and I've -- I've only heard about, um -- I -- we thought it was at the state leve- level but I'm not sure either 'cause it's been a couple of years --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- where, um, the government was thinking about the option of giving money to the parents to pay for private schools if that was their choice.
R:  Right.
L:  But maybe this is a different issue.  So, if you wanted your child not to go to, um, the public school but a private school the same amount of money that would go in to that particular child at the public school would be handed over to the parents and they could use that towards a private school --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- of their wishes.
R:  That sounds like what I remember so it must have been the state level.  I'm sorry.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  Okay.  I'm not sure what I think about that.
R:  [MN]  I don't know.  [MN]  I don't know if it's been demonstrated that the private school programs are -- are better than the, um -- the public school programs.  [MN]  Um, so, I don't know if allowing people to go to private school is a better solution anyway.  [MN] 
L:  Right.  Yeah, I don't know either.  I think, um -- I guess, kind of related to the same type of issue, um, is that you see a big difference among different communities so ...I've worked in some wealthy areas in San Diego where, you know, these -- all the parents are doctors and lawyers and the schools -- the public schools in their communities are very nice.  There's, ah, several computers in each classroom and they have a lot of support and then I've also worked in, um--
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- more of an inner city type of school with -- with minorities in -- in [inaudible] city and they don't even have colored paper all the time or, ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, they need to buy new pens and markers where these, like, upper class, um, public schools -- they were to- -- tossing away their old, ah, old, ah, pens and buying new pens every semester and one thing I ended up doing was collecting it and taking it down to Mexico to at least give to somebody but --
R:  Ah, that's a great idea.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah, I've -- I've definitely seen that.  They've even taken computers and just want to throw the computers in the trashcan and we've taken them and put them in, um, different schools that would actually set them up and use them.  But, um, I -- there's definitely an issue of where the -- the money goes --
R:  [MN]  Yeah.
L:  And implements.
R:  [MN]  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and one thing people have thought about -- I -- as I remember is they're trying to just take the tax for, like, the state, say, and then divide it equally among all school districts but that, um, [MN] , that just doesn't go well with most people --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- because they -- they move into a community because they had a good school system or something.  [MN] 
L:  Right.
R:  Um, [MN].
L:  Yeah, I've -- I've heard about that option too.  But then, I guess, you could argue if you are one of the parents who are paying, um, high taxes you do expect a little bit more.
R:  Right.  [MN] 
L:  Even though it's not really fair to the child given the equal opportunity.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Right.  Ah, like -- like -- like you said, some schools have all the technology and -- and very current programs and some schools don't have enough m- -- microscopes for their chemistry classes and stuff like that.  Um [MN], I -- I just don't know -- I don't know how to resolve that though.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know either.  So, yeah, I guess those are some of the fundamental, um, problems.  Other than that I think there's, ah, maybe a social issue with some of the kids now where, um, teachers -- since I have worked in some public schools I've noticed that teachers are a lot less strict than when I was in school or at least that's my perception now where kids talk back or they use language in school that would -- wouldn't be tolerated at all --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when I was in elementary school.
R:  Yeah.  I don't -- I don't -- I don't know how that [MN] came about but that -- that is certainly my perception too is that as time goes on teachers [MN] sort of care less and less, um, in -- when they're in bad situations.  I don't know if it's because they're frustrated because what they've tried early on hasn't met with success or if it's just that --
L:  Or --
R:  -- they're getting older.
L:  -- that's what everybody does even.  Like, if all the kids talk like they do then it's almost normal rather than, [MN] yeah, I d- -- I don't know.  A lot of economic and social problems that they're not [inaudible].  There's no simple answer.
R:  [LIPSMACK] No, certainly not.  [MN] 
L:  So, other than that ...
R:  [MN] Standardizing the curriculum on a federal level I j-  -- I don't know if that would work.  [LAUGH]  I hear that they do that in Japan, um ...
L:  Where they have certain, um, like, at each level, like, each grade?  I mean, are --
R:  As I -- oh, go ahead.
L:  No, go ahead.
R:  Um, as I understand it, in Japan they have, um, a couple of volumes, um, in their education department or whatever that says by the end of third grade children will be able to do these things and then they have something like that for each year.  Um, and I know that [MN] the United States at least is moving toward that with some of the standardized testing, um, movements.  I know -- I know in Massachusetts there's, um, there's a test you have to pass as a sophomore in high school in order to get a diploma, [LIPSMACK], um --
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, that -- that's where I'm from, Massachusetts, um.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  And it was -- it was really a problem when it first got [MN] implemented because people were like, well, how is this fair, why does it happen at your sophomore year?  You know, all those sorts of constraints -- uh, complaints, sorry.  [LAUGH]  Ah ...
L:  They -- so, are -- are they doing that now?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, they are.  Okay.  So, it has been in place.
R:  Yeah, and I know teachers are really complaining about -- it takes like two weeks to do all the testing so they lose all that time.  It's -- it's -- it's a weird paradox of --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- you have to prepare your students to do this but you have less time to do it now and ...
L:  Right.  I've heard about the same thing, um, being proposed in California but I'm not sure that anything's gone through.
