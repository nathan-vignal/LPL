L:  [LIPSMACK] [inaudible].
R:  Hi, this is Karen.
L:  Hi, I'm Sarah.  I'm from Ohio.  [MN] 
R:  Oh, I am too.  How're you?
L:  Oh, good, good.  [MN]  So, do you watch reality shows?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Not really, actually, I find them sort of stupid. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  How about you?
L:  I watch, like, I like the Survivor one and I like -- I used to like Amazing Race but the new ones are scary.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I -- I got --my family, surprisingly, I've got two teenage daughters and my husband, have gotten into, um, Joe Millionaire --
L:  Ahah.  [MN] 
R:  So, I was sort of forced to watch the last couple of episodes of that and, [MN] um, I mean, a little bit of American Idol but other than that I usually walk out of the room [MN] when they're watching --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that.
L:  [LAUGH]  Like, I saw a little bit of Joe Millionaire but, like, that new ones that are on now, like, the Are You Hot and, [MN] um, what's the one where pe- -- ah, M- Married by America?
R:  Oh, yeah, that --
L:  That's so s- -- like, unbelievable.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I- -- it's so unreal I can't believe that they're even promoting it as reality TV and --
L:  I know.
R:  -- it -- it --
L:  I know.
R:  -- but apparently they're drawing in a lot of people so I'm not sure what the, ah, big draw is for people.
L:  I know.  Like, I ca- -- like, I -- that's -- I -- I draw the line there.  Like, even, I don't know, I used to -- when it first came out I watched Fear Factor a little bit [MN] but now some of the things they do, I'll just be flipping through and I'll see it and it's, like, it's wrong I think to do that to human beings even.
R:  [MN]  Well, I think it sort of goes back to that show Jackass, you know, where --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- people think that, you know, oh, this is cool and I'm going to try it and end up getting hurt or [MN] --
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  Right, it's not even healthy.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No, no, and it just, you know, I -- I really would like to see the demographics of who are watching it.  I am afraid it's going to be a lot of teenagers and, [MN] you know, people --
L:  Ex- --
R:  -- in their early teens and just really give them a warped sense of what the real world is all about.
L:  People who can't handle it basically and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's, for the future generations, it's going to be more and more unhealthy then because, I mean, now that they've gone this far, like, where are they going to go with it?
R:  [MN] 
L:  It's --
R:  Well, it just gives them a totally warped sense of reality.  I mean, here they're glorifying people who can't, you know, make -- get into relationships on their own [MN] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or -- or can't, you know, be successful in -- in a normal, you know, way and so all of a sudden we're making them into TV stars and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, heroes and, oh, I just think -- yeah, I find it very disturbing.
L:  Like that's an okay way to get a --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- relationship started or something.
R:  Oh yeah, and they're going to marry somebody sight unseen, um, just --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- because, you know, America thinks they should.
L:  Right.  [MN]  I mean, I know that there are e- -- there's like the Russian brides that people phone up for and stuff, but this is even worse.  Like, they bring people onto it to vote on it and all that.  [MN]  I don't know.  It is a bit -- bit odd.  [MN] 
R:  Well, at least with the Russian brides or the Filipino brides you can understand that these people are trying to get --
L:  Right.
R:  -- out of, you know, horrible economic situation to say the least [MN] and, you know, so, you can maybe understand why they're doing it but, you know, supposedly these people are -- you know, have careers and, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- are -- are somewhat normal and yet --
L:  Supposedly.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know they can't -- [MN] can't make it work.  So, I -- I'm -- I'm really disturbed by the whole thing.
L:  Right.  They're supposed to be these great catches, yet they're on T- -- like, they try to build them up and, oh, they're this and this but they can't find a date.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, that's great.  [MN]
R:  Well --
L:  And it's also, I mean the, like you say, like the Russian or the Filipino, they're doing it for a reason --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but these people are -- it's purely for ratings.  Like, they're -- they're doing it for money and for the -- the TV ratings.
R:  [MN]  Well, and just, you know, and the additional media hype.  I mean, all the stuff that came out of, ah, Joe Millionaire.  It was on the news it seemed like every day --
L:  Right.
R:  [MN]  Oh, look what we found out about Sarah and look what we found out about Ethan or whatever his name is --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it's like, oh, please, you know, [MN]  but this is just ridiculous, so [LIPSMACK] ...
L:  And now, I guess, now they have all the celebrity ones, like the I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, and then the Celebrity Mole and all those.  [MN]  I don't know.  [LAUGH]  If anything does annoy me more than the regular ones 'cause the regular ones -- the ones where it's a contest where they can win it -- it's kinda neat to see just a regular person maybe win like Survivor or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But when it's celebrities, like, they're already a celebrity.  They don't need that, like, they don't need the money.  They don't need [MN] --
R:  Yeah, no, I will admit, I do watch, ah, [LIPSMACK] -- MTV has a couple of series, Real World and Road Rules.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Now, those I actually, I -- I -- you know, those I think are good.  I mean, they're t- --geared at a certain age --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yeah, and I think, you know, those almost deal with more reality [MN] I think than some of these, you know, adult based shows supposedly do.
L:  Well, that's w- -- it's c- -- you're right.  It's like they're -- they're put into a situation that's not real [MN] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but they really deal with reality, like they deal with issues and working whereas on these other shows the people are so fake.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, when they're -- it's a competition or something -- they're all putting on such a front th- -- there's no real- -- it's -- it's just interesting to see how, like, horrible people will get and how back stabbing, but [MN] the -- yeah, I agree, Real World, that used to be interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause it's actually, you know, there's some interplay and it's neat to see how people --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- interact and stuff -- 
R:  -- which was what it was all about I guess.
R:  [MN] Right, exactly and they -- they would show you the stuff that these other shows seemed to cut out about, you know, how people really had to deal with each other's feelings and, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what it was like to all of a sudden have to live with, you know, [MN] nine other people that you didn't know or -- or, you know.  And y- -- but yet they were working as a team --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, towards a common goal which, you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I mean, the- -- most of these new shows the -- the goal is, you know, to beat out your competition to end up with, you know, this great prize that ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think it's all disturbing.  [MN] 
L:  And I guess there's not -- I don't know, I guess there's still several good, like, regular TV shows on too, like, 'cause I know a lot of, like, people, like, that do real TV -- [LAUGH] real TV! [LAUGH] --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- they're getting frustrated because it's -- it's like nowadays --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- if it's not reality [MN] they can't compete basically.
R:  [MN] 
L:  But there's still a few good dramas out there and there are good other shows I think.
R:  [MN]  Well, I agree and I guess I've always just viewed, um, TV as entertainment that, you know, I wanna get away from the real world.  I wanna go --
L:  Right.
R:  -- sit in Sitcom Land or Drama Land for half an hour or an hour, and forget about, you know, my reality.
L:  [MN]  I agree.  [LAUGH] 
R:  So ...
L:  It looks like all the people who -- they make fun of American cinema because it's, like, happy endings and I'm, like, like, why do I wanna go watch a movie I -- sometimes it's nice to go see a serious movie and learn something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but most times when I go to the movie theater I wanna get away from it all and I d- -- I do -- I want my happy ending.  Like, you know, that's -- it doesn't have to be real- -- like real to be [MN] what it is supposed to be, I guess.  [MN] 
R:  Well, that's it.  I mean, as a rule, documentaries don't do very good because people don't wanna see what's really -- what the real world's like.  They, you know, they want an escape and yet --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, they have these twisted TV shows -- and I just, you know, I -- I think back to different things I've seen and now, you know, these people are -- are capitalizing on it and they've become, you know, some talk show host or, you know --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- they're doing commentary for future auditions and it's like, oh please, these people have no life.
L:  Right.  [MN]  Th- that's really true.  It's --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- not going anywhere good and what they've done is not anything worthwhile and [MN] not much to recommend about it.  [MN] 
R:  Exactly.  To get off the topic for a bit, 'cause I understand they cut us off promptly when our ten minutes is up --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- how did you find out about this study?
L:  [COUGH]  Um, through a mystery shopping web site.
R:  [MN]  Me too.
L:  Oh.  [MN] 
R:  That's what I wanted.  [MN]  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, you do mystery shopping also?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [MN] 
L:  I -- I think quite a few of us ended up on there --
R:  [MN] 
L:  'cause we hear about it.  I got it from [MN] Lila's Lounge.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Okay.
R:  That's where I got it from.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Well, I'm -- I'm, like I say, I'm in the Dayton, Ohio area.
R:  Okay, well, I'm in the Akron Cleveland area.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, we're still not competitors --
L:  No, right.
R:  -- going back to another thread.  So ... [LAUGH] 
L:  I always feel that's a shop[?] for you guys.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's always, like, mm do I really [MN] -- who do I know there that I can go visit [LAUGH], get some shops in [MN] but, no.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I'm actually pretty new to mystery shopping.  I just started, like, about a month and a half ago.
R:  Oh, yeah, you are a really newbie.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  My sister's been doing it for a couple of years and she's always, like, you should do this and you should do that and so, finally, [MN] my dad wanted to do some of the buffet shops.  [LAUGH].  So to get him started I signed up so I could help him with it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then I started doing it.  So, now I'm doing it quite a bit.
R:  Oh, well, that's good.
L:  How long have you been doing it?
R:  Um, I've been doing it for probably about five years now.
L:  Wow.
R:  But I always -- always just did it, you know, just a little bit here and there, just fun things, but I was laid off in November so I -- I'm doing it, trying to do it [MN] as a full time job but I just, ah, haven't quite got into that level yet, so ...
L:  Are y- -- is it -- is it -- are you getting pretty good at scheduling enough during the week or what's the --
R:  Y- yeah, I mean, you know, I'm -- I'm -- when I can find the shops.  The problem is, you know, a lot of the companies with the rotations that I can pick a whole bunch from one month but then I have to sit back for a couple of months before I can do a bunch for 'em again. [MN] 
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, um, I'm kind of still applying to new companies and trying to get in on new projects and such.
L:  That's true bec- -- once you get enough rotations then you'll be okay but that's the thing I've noticed is that [MN] you do have, like, some of them you have to wait for 'em before you could do it again or there's some I know that I've done that I can only do it once, like -- like for c- -- cell phones and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, [MN] yeah.
R:  Yeah, well, good luck.  It -- it's a fun thing if you can, you know, get into it and get it going.
L:  Yeah, my mom likes it 'cause I take her out to eat a lot now.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  She thinks that's great.  [LAUGH]  I really, what I'm trying to do maybe is get like a merchandising job that I can do regular --
R:  [MN]  Mhm.
L:  -- and then so -- like, I have enough every week and then I can just fill in with the mystery shopping. 
R:  Right, yeah, I mean, that's what I've been trying to do too and it's just, you know, unfortunately there have been some many merchandisers, at least in my area, [MN] that it's really hard --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to crack into that, so --
L:  Right.  Yeah, I don't see a whole lot of opportunities for it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Usually, for me, it's either like Cincinnati that I have to go to or [MN] -- I mean, I don't even see many for Columbus actually.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, it's hard to find them.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  And I don't -- I guess from looking for shops, like the one that frustrates me the most is Sassy shops --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because couple of companies, like, I sign up all the time [MN] and, like, the -- the sign up will, like, go dead.  Like, it'll be like [COUGH], like I'll sign up for, like, five days before and then it'll -- it'll -- no one will get it [MN] and it'll still be on there and they never assign it.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah, but a lot of those I think have to do with demographics so, like --
L:  That's what I figured.
R:  -- they're looking for a very specific thing.
L:  That's what I figured.  But it's still, like, ah!  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's the only bad thing, I guess.  You sign up for 'em and you kind of want to keep your schedule open if you've said that and, I guess, I can always go back and take it off of Sassy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which is nice too.  I do like the set up there.
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  But ...
R:  Oh, this has been interesting.  Is this your first call with Fisher?
L:  Yeah, this is my first one.
R:  Yeah, they had called yesterday and I was on the computer and they left a voice mail message and I called.  [MN]  I was trying to make a point of getting off right at two today and I got off at two o three and, of course, they had left a message at two o two that they had tried to call --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and I thought, "Oh, no".
L:  [COUGH]  That happened --
