L:  Pretty good.  How're you?
R:  Good.
L:  Hey, so, um --
R:  [MN] So, um, so the topic is about what --
L:  Time travel.
R:  Yeah, w- if time can travel.  Is that right?
L:  Yeah, it's more about, you know, if you can go back in time and if you can change some -- something --
R:  Yeah, I think --
L:  -- in your life.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] There would be so many things I wish I could change.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So.
L:  What -- what -- what would be?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, ah, [SIGH] the first and most -- well, ah, one thing I would change is, um, [LIPSMACK] I would, ah, change my attitude towards, um, things, ah, things happening to me or [MN] um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to be more positive to life.
L:  So, y- you are saying that you would be more positive to life if we can change that?
R:  I wish I could be more positive and, ah [SIGH] yeah, ah, more -- I mean, happier --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to what I -- whatever I get.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mhm.  How about you?
L:  Um, I guess if I can change something I'd like to -- mm, maybe I'd like to be a little bit more negative in my life. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh really, you're a very positive person?
L:  I'm kind of a very positive person.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But I -- I don't think I ever -- I want to change that, ah, but, you know, sometime it's just too much.  Ah, I -- I am [MN] very positive in my life.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, you know, let me consider.  If I have to change something in my life I think, ah, that would be, maybe my education, you know.
R:  Okay.
L:  At one point of time I decided that, ah, I'm going -- I am currently go- -- you know, I am a computer engineer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm in information technology field and one of my passions is to be a human psychologist study.
R:  Oh, really, no kidding?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm a software engineer.  So, we are almost in the same --
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] -- area.
L:  Oh, you are in computers?
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah, if -- if I can change one thing I probably would change my education too 'cause I --
L:  Oh, okay, okay.
R:  'Cause I wo-
L:  And what would that be?
R:  'Cause I would -- 'cause I always wanted to be a scientist.
L:  Mm?
R:  Yeah.  My -- my parents are professors at a university and, ah, they study energy.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They study the, ah [LIPSMACK] ah, how to burn coal, ah, cleanly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, that kind of thing.  And I, myself was very interested in physics [SIGH] but--
L:  Oh, you were?  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, I guess due to the, ah, job market I chose computer [LAUGH] science.
L:  Oh, I think I did choose it because of the job market.  I had, I mean -- I had these two options, either, you know, go ahead and read --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, go ahead with the human psychology study for which I have -- I mean, you know, because I did grow up in India.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, you know.
R:  Okay.
L:  They had this kind of a [inaudible] that I had to be a doctor first and then I can go ahead and do the Majors in psychology.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, you know, I didn't want to go through all that MBBS[?] and, ah, doctor thing. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  I wasn't interested in being a physician first and then going for the Major studies.
R:  Oh, that would be interesting.
L:  So, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, so that was, ah, something that, you know ...  So, you -- you -- you are interested in physics, huh?
R:  [MN] Yes, very much.
L:  Okay, okay.
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  Yeah, i- that used to be one of my passions too.  I -- I -- I loved physics.  Actually I loved any -- any part of the science, that was that.
R:  Mhm, yeah, yeah.
L:  So, I -- I'm -- I'm participating in this kind of service for the first time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, how does it go?  I mean, is it, ah, that, um, someone is gonna, ah -- I mean, how does it go?  It's just a [several inaudible words].  It's gonna be a [several inaudible words] or ...?
R:  Mhm.
L:  H- have you already, ah --  have you participated in this kind of a thing before?
R:  No, I just registered this afternoon.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh [LAUGH] okay.  Also that's what I did. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] My first time ever, first. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Actually I did register for the first time today noon only. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Okay, anything else you want to change?
L:  Um, no I think that would be the only thing if I wouldn't --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- be computer engineer I would be --
R:  Okay.  I have so many things to change.  I probably [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] in my life I [SIGH] -- I would change [LIPSMACK] my love life.  I probably would go to my [LIPSMACK] first boyfriend. [LAUGH]  I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  --that -- that guy was good. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that guy was good, huh?
R:  But I dumped him, so I was stupid.
L:  And so what happened there? [LAUGH]
R:  I was stupid.  I was too young.
L:  Oh.
R:  Ah, so ... [LIPSMACK]  So maybe --
L:  I don't think that I want to change that.  I was -- I am in love with the person whom I first time fell in love with.
R:  Oh, you are so lucky.
L:  And we are getting married.  I know.  We are getting married --

L:  Right.
R:  If time can go back, I mean.
L:  Yeah, I guess.  I mean, I -- if I can -- you know, I always had this, ah -- one of my friend and me we used to always discuss this.  If we had a time machine --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we'll always be in our college time zone. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Those are the fun days, you know?
R:  Mhm.

R:  Oh.
L:  I met my first boyfriend.
R:  Mm.
L:  I fell in love, I decided that I am going to be a computer engineer.  I am a successful computer engineer now.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And, you know, I decided that, um -- that was the year when I decided that I am going to come to United States.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, before that I was in India, so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  Yeah, too many things happened in that year.  What would be that age for you?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.  I would, oh [LIPSMACK] -- I wish I were, um, like twenty two or twenty three, something like that.  [SIGH] That I -- ah, I graduated and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I had a job.  I'd -- I'm not worrying about money and, ah [LAUGH]

R:  Ah, computer science.
L:  I mean, um, any particular area that you are, ah -- I mean --

R:  I see.
L:  I was --
R:  So, where do you wish you -- [LAUGH]
R:  -- in California all this time.  So ...
R:  So, [MN] maybe you wish you went back to California?
L:  Oh, yeah, but, you know.  [MN] I mean, I left California --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, because, you know, the job market situation.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  I don't want to go back there.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, is it bad?  Is it that -- that bad?
L:  In California it's really bad.
R:  Oh, it's really bad.  Oh.
