L:  Hi, I'm Liz.
R:  Hi, I'm Susan.
L:  Hi, how are ya?
R:  Fine.  Ah, well [MN] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I went to the movies, no, um, I very seldom go.  The last time I went was, like, a year ago when I took my kids to see, ah, Harry Potter.
L:  You too, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  The last one -- I -- I just took my daughter and we've seen, what is that, ah, [LIPSMACK] oh, it's a -- it's a cartoon on Nickelodeon, The Thornberrys.
R:  Oh.
L:  I sat through that.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Other than that, yeah, we also went to see the Harry Potter and that was pretty good.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I liked it.  I did like that one.
L:  I -- it was.
R:  [MN] 
L:  I don't normally go to the movie theater.  I tell you, I'm bored out of my mind --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- sitting there.  I don't know about you.  Do you get -- is it a --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- reason that you don't go?
R:  I d- -- I just don't -- I don't know.  I just don't like to go.  I don't know why.  The only reason I went is that I took the -- my grandkids.
L:  Exact -- see, no, that's exactly why I had gone.  My daughter wanted to go so badly.  [MN]  Other than that, I haven't been to the theater before Harry Potter, I'm going to say, jeeze, two -- two years --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- two, three years and before that six.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I don't even --
L:  I hate them.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I don't even remember the last time I went.
L:  I like that I'm able to watch it at home and stop it and get up and go --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and come back --
R:  yeah.
L:  -- [LAUGH] you know?
R:  Yeah, we've even got a VCR and stuff but we don't -- and we belong to a -- like a Blockbuster but we'd never even go rent movies.  We --
L:  Same here.  Exact same thing here.  I don't, I don't bother --
R:  Ahah.
L:  I really don't and my fiance just went out and he bought a DVD player --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and I looked at him and I said, "Wh- what am I doing with this?"  [LAUGH]  "What do I want with this?"  
R:  Yeah.
L:  He's given this to me as a gift but I think it's for you and not me. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I don't even have the time set on the VCR. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  The thing is still blinking.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, we never even -- we never use our VC- -- and we've got -- we're hooked up to, ah, we've got cable and we've got, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- HBO and all those things.  We don't never watch none of that.  I- --
L:  I tell you, I don't either.  I -- I -- I rarely, rarely, rarely want to sit down and watch [MN] movies --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- especially if they're all violent.
R:  We, yeah, we mainly watch, ah, you know, true stuff on the TV, [MN] um --
L:  You mean on like --
R:  Oh, Medical Detectives and stuff like that.
L:  Oh, yeah, I've watched that and, ah, Discovery Channel.
R:  Yes.
L:  And there was a good one last night.  I sat my son down.  I have a fourteen year old boy --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and I sat him down because he wanted to know about the war --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and Saddam Hussein and on channel two they had a documentary on the Gulf War --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, so, I sat him down and let him watch some of it until they basically showed some really --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- horrific pictures and I said, "Ah, that's time for bed".  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  "You're not going to watch this any more".  But, yeah, that's exactly what we try to watch in here.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I --'cause I really wanna sit down and watch that stuff.
R:  Yeah, I watch the remodeling shows, decorator shows and stuff like that.
L:  You mean, on HDTV --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Is it HDTV?
R:  Yes.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They have that dream home giveaway.  I get on the computer every day --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and register to win that dream home.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Same thing here.  [LAUGH]  I -- I tell you, the same thing.  I switch between those channels.  I have CNN on right now --
R:  Ahah.
L: -- and just listening to it because I don't -- I haven't watched it.
R:  Ah, we're watching A and E, Arts and Entertainment, so ...
L:  Oh, anything good on tonight [LAUGH] because --
R:  It's medical.  It's something to do med -- Medical Detectives or something, yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] See, those are the good things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I try to tell mine.  You don't want to sit down and watch the boob tube and not learn anything from it.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, but [MN] you know kids.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They don't want to be bothered.  Anything that's going to, you know, entertain them for a while --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's what they're into and I just pull the plug.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  It doesn't really matter.  [MN]  And here we are getting paid for this and neither one of us like the movies.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know. [LAUGH] 
L:  This works out very well.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where are you call- -- where are they calling you from?  I'm from --
R:  I'm from Peoria, Illinois.
L:  Oh, from Illinois?
R:  Ahah.
L:  I originate from New York.  I'm now living in -- in Boston.
R:  Yeah, you have the accent. [LAUGH]  
L:  Oh, you can hear.
R:  I can tell.
L:  You know, when I spoke to them, when I had talked to someone from Pennsylvania, she was like, "I can't -- can't even make out that you have an accent".  I'm like, "I'm hiding it".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Because my kids make fun of me when they hear me talking.
R:  Ahah.
L:  I'm like, "I'm hiding it".  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  She goes, "No, don't do that" [LAUGH].  But I can hear your accent.  It sounds so s- -- it sounds [MN] sweet, like gentle, on the ear --
R:  Uh, uh-uh.
L:  -- as opposed to the people that come from New York.  Our accent is so hard on the ears --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know what I mean?  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Also up here, did you get clobbered with any snow?
R:  [MN]  Um, we had a little bit, not -- not very much at all.  It's -- we don't have nothing now.  It's all gone.
L:  Oh, aren't you lucky?  We're going to get another six to eight inches out here.  We just got finished with thirteen.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's a big one, [MN] so I --
R:  Yeah, we've had a real mild winter so far.
L:  Aren't you lucky?  No, we've -- we've got it rough here, [MN]  --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and I -- I can't get anybody up from New York.  No one wants to come up.  They're like, "You can keep your Canada weather".  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "We're not coming up".
R:  Ahah.
L:  So, you're not going to plan on seeing any movies?
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  No, I don't plan on going to see any.
L:  [LAUGH]  Your husband doesn't go either with you?  He doesn't like to go to the theater?
R:  No, uh-uh.
L:  Nah.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  No. 
L:  See, that -- that works out well, because my fiance loves to go to the theater --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- to the movie theater, and I hate it so my son goes.
R:  But you go anyway?
L:  No.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, you don't.  [LAUGH] 
L:  No.  I send my son.  I go, "Go ahead, there -- there you go boys.  Go out and have a bonding session".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "I'm not [LAUGH] -- I'm not going, thank you".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  No, I get out of it somehow, because I'll fall asleep.  
R:  Ahah.
L:  I will absolutely fall asleep in the movie theater.  
R:  Ahah.
L:  If -- if it wasn't that my daughter was munching in my ear popcorn I would have fell asleep during The Thornberrys.
R:  Well, you know what I did when I went to -- when I took, oh, I took four of the grandkids to go --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- to the theater, ah, Harry Potter. 
L:  [MN] 
R:  I thought, "I'm not going to pay those outrageous prices for popcorn and stuff".  [MN]  I took a big bag with me and I put --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- sodas, popcorn, candy and all the stuff that you would get --
L:  Oh, that's excellent.
R:  -- and I took it in with me.
L:  Oh, that's excellent.  Why no- -- they're expensive. 
R:  I know.
L:  They're out of their -- their minds in there.
R:  I thought -- I was kind of afraid I might get caught doing it but I didn't and I don't know if they would have said anything or not but [MN] --
L:  That's excellent.
R:  That's what we did.
L:  You saved yourself a lot of money.  If you have four kids with you [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, man, I -- I had only my one and I just got her, like, a medium soda and a medium popcorn and it came out to six fifty.
R:  Yeah, it's ridiculous.
L:  Just for her.  Like --
R:  It's ridiculous what they charge.
L:  -- what is this?  For popcorn.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Can you imagine for that?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  That was the right thing that you did.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Absolutely.  Four kids in a movie theater on your own, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  God bless you!  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  You have more courage than I would --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- 'cause I -- I don't think I would do that, although in a movie theater I guess they could sit quietly --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and watch, especially the Harry Potter, they tend to sit and watch that.
R:  Yeah.  I r-  -- I really liked that.  In fact, I wanted to see the second one and I haven't seen that one yet.
L:  Oh, which -- oh, you're talking about the first one that they have?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You didn't just go see the new one?
R:  No, I haven't seen the new one.
L:  Oh, I'm up on you then.  I did.  
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  It was goo- --
R:  No, I've seen the first one.  That's what I'm talking about.  I went about --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- a year ago, it's been s- --
L:  Then you really don't go.
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  I had gone to this Harry Potter 'cause, again, this time it was the fiance, "Let's take the kids and take them".
R:  Ahah.
L:  All right, I'll go.  But actually it was good. 
R:  Ahah.
L:  There may be some parts in there if you have young ones --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- that will get scared 'cause mine is only seven years old and she got scared with the spiders.  There's a -- a scene that shows these huge spiders so she was a little scared of that.
R:  Oh.
L:  But other than that the movie is really good.
R:  Ahah.
L:  It's all the -- the work that they put into it, all that graphic art --
R:  Ahah, year.
L:  -- and -- unbelievable.  You'll enjoy it.  If you do go, go see that.
R:  Yeah, I'll have to go see that.
L:  I'm surprised your k- -- the grandkids didn't come after you to go and see it.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  No, they didn't this time.  
L:  Maybe you can hold off if you get it on VHS.  "Here you go guys".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  "Sit down".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  That's always a plus.
R:  Ahah.  So --
L:  Well, is this your first time that you're doing these, ah, these 
R:  Yeah, I've never done it before.
L:  Either have it.  I can't even remember where I found it.  I think I found it on one of these websites.
R:  I did on the --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- um, My Coupons dot com.
L:  [MN]  Oh, maybe it was Big Big Savings that I went to. 
R:  Oh.
L:  Have you ever been there?
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  Oh, wait a minute, we're going to talk about a good thing now.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Big Big Savings dot com.  [LIPSMACK] When you get there to the main page --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- hit forums.  When it comes forums it'll open up another page.  
R:  Ahah.
L:  Go to the second one that says, ah, freebies.
R:  Ahah.
L:  [MN]  Let me tell you the stuff that I've gotten for free.  [MN]  I've gotten Chef knives for free --
R:  Really?
L:  Oh, my God, yeah.  I've gotten beautiful sweaters that were put out by, um, oh, it's a com -- what is it, ah, [LIPSMACK], one of the computers.  I don't want to say Microsoft but it's another one --
R:  Um.
L:  -- ah, beautiful sweatshirts --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- t shirts, hats, all kinds of samples --
R:  I'm getting a pen, ink pen, so I can write this down.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I swear to God, you go here, you won't be --
R:  What -- what's the name of it?
L:  Big Big Savings --
R:  Dot com.
L:  Dot com.  It is unreal.
R:  Huh.
L:  It rea- -- you -- you -- you won't be disappointed.  Like I said when you go there --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- it'll come up to the page, hit the word forum.
R:  Okay.
L:  Once that forum is hit it'll bring you to another one and i- -- it'll have, like, on the left hand side all these other places you could go to.
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  Just go to the second line that says freebies --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and you look through the list.  [MN]  I've gotten fifty dollars for just t- test driving cars.
R:  Oh, I get that too.  Ah, in fact, I just got a fifty dollar gift check, um, for a test drive [MN] --
L:  Nice.
R:  -- for a test drive in a car.  But I got that stuff on, ah, My Coupons dot com.
L:  Yes.
R:  People list it -- you know, test drives and all that stuff.
L:  Oh, you won't be -- you really won't be disappointed with this one.  It's -- it really is a goodie.
R:  I'll have to go to it.  I've never heard of it.
L:  I've put so many people into that and they're like, "Thank you" [LAUGH] -- gotten so many --
R:  My sisters and, ah, I do, ah, different reward programs and stuff.  [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, that's always nice.
R:  And earn -- you know, to earn gift certificates for different places.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mail source[?] is a good one.
