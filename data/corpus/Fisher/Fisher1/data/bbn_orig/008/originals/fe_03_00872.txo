R:  Hi.
L:  Hi there.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Hi, this is Louise.
L:  Hi, my name's Lee.
R:  Hey, Lee.
L:  And what's your name?
R:  Louise.
L:  Oh, hi, Louise.  It's nice to meet you. [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, so, the topic is affirmative action and I have to tell you that I've been out of the work force for about seven years.
R:  Really?
L:  I'm a homemaker now.  So, um, [MN] I'm not really familiar with how the -- the practice, um, hiring practices are affected by affirmative action now.
R:  [MN]  Well, I -- I'm just at the beginning of my working years I suppose.  I am a college student right now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I work part time in a computer lab on campus for students with disabilities.
L:  Wow.
R:  Um, yeah.  I'm an international student.  I'm from Australia --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I'm living here, um -- I live in Provo, Utah, going to Brigham Young University where I've been for two years now.
L:  Wow.
R:  How -- how did you come to choose Brigham Young, all the way from Australia?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I -- I'm studying linguistics, um, with a Japanese minor and BYU is one of the -- the most prestigious universities for language study in the United States.  Um, they have the capacity to teach sixty five languages.
L:  Wow.
R:  Um, and the next one down from it only teaches something like forty so it's quite -- quite a big center for language studies.
L:  [MN]  You know, I've been trying to study Japanese on my own for, oh, years and years.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Really?  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] But, you know, it's a difficult language to take up without a tutor I must say.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it's kind of tricky.  I've been studying it for, oh, probably four years now and I'm not fluent or anything.  I c- [MN] --
L:  Have you been to Japan?
R:  Um, I've spent, ah, twenty four hours there actually on my way from Australia over to here --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- and so I had the day to look around and I stayed in a hotel for the night and it was a lot of fun.  [LAUGH]  I didn't want to leave.
L:  I -- my -- my husband and I took a vacation there a couple of years ago.  We spent two weeks --
R:  Really?
L:  -- living in a little business hotel in Iria[?], ah, [MN] where we were the [MN] only English speakers probably for, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, five square miles.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow.
L:  We had a great time and -- and the Japanese were so friendly and, oh, it was -- it was just such a wonderful experience.  I know if you get a chance to -- to spend more time there you're just going to love it, especially being able to actually speak --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- the language, you know --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- other than just, you know, a few phrases here and there [LAUGH] like us.
R:  Yeah.  I've got some work to do yet.  I'm still in the basics.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, um, [MN] are you familiar with the affirmative action program since I guess that's what we're supposed to speak about but, um ...
R:  I know.  I'm -- I'm really not too familiar with it.  Um, [LIPSMACK] what do you know about it?  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  Well, [MN], I don't think that I've ever really been affected by it even though as a woman in the workforce -- I --I was an accountant for the General Electric Corporation whenever -- we lived in Chicago, Illinois -- by the way, right now I live in northern Georgia in a little dinky farm town.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I see.  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, um, what, even though as a woman I am considered a minority, as far as I know the Affirmative Action Statutes really touch upon race instead of gender status --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- so, being a white female I really [LAUGH] never knew that much about it.  I -- I never really thought about it in relation to myself.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So.
R:  Well, my -- my experience is maybe a little different.  While I was in high school I didn't work.  I just went to school.
L:  Mm.
R:  But now that I'm here in America and I'm an international student, there's quite a lot of restrictions.  I'm only -- um, well, I'm on an F two visa which is a student visa --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and with that I am allowed to work on campus.  Um --
L:  That's all?
R:  -- during the time -- yeah, I'm only allowed --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to work on campus and I have to keep my hours below twenty hours per week and that's -- I have to also be taking full time study.
L:  That sounds difficult from a financial point of view.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Well, somewhat.  You can just hope for a scholarship I suppose.
L:  Yeah, I -- I know that there is, um -- well, maybe -- maybe not in -- well, I don't know.  If you're actually working in a computer lab you might have felt some of the backlash against H one B visa holders.  My husband is a software engineer for Sun Microsystems and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- there are a lot of, um, um, especially Indian people working in the United States, um, on visas and -- and there's a lot of, um, American disgruntlement about some of these foreign workers, um, you know, it's the old, "Well, they're all taking jobs that Americans could do" but I'm -- I'm not sure if I believe that.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, you know, there is -- there is some backlash and [MN] -- and I think that that is also [MN] part of the problem and part of the controversy about the affirmative action program is that it said that people with less experience or talent are given jobs over those who might be more experienced or more talented simply because of their, ah, minority status --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- whatever that status may be.
R:  Yeah.  There's also I suppose the consideration there, I -- I don't know what you've heard about, um, people with disabilities, finding them jobs and things.  I mean, there was once upon a time where people with disabilities were, um, basically placed in jobs, like making broom handles and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- thinks like that, just the sweat shop type thing and today they're, um, getting people with disabilities a little further out there into the work force trying to get them better trained --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and giving them jobs that are more meaningful and --
L:  [MN]  Well, my aunt Louise had epilepsy and even though that's, you know, a very easily controlled condition in her case, um, she was, even though she was a college graduate, was never able to find any kind of meaningful work because she did tell them, you know, "I am epileptic" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then it would be like, "Oh, bye".  [LAUGH]  You know, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I- -- it was absolutely incredible because she is an extremely talented person --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, she graduated from art school.  I mean, you know, it's not like she was, ah, poorly educated or anything, um, but she finally just gave up and, you know, retired from the workforce completely.  
R:  It seems as though that is the case that, um, there are just so many +stigmatisms about disabilities or just any kind of minority.  They carry +stigmatisms, um, when it comes to employment and no matter how well they're trained they're -- it really does depend on the employer on what their feeling is towards that particular minority.
L:  [MN]  You know, I -- I'll agree with that and -- and -- but the thing that bothers me about some of these federal [MN] statutes is that I don't really know if you can legislate people's minds to believe otherwise than they already do.
R:  You really can't.
L:  Ah, you know, it's [SIGH] -- I -- I -- I don't know.  It's like the legislation of morality.  Does that really work, you know, and do we really want it to work [LAUGH] because --
R:  Yes, exactly.
L:  -- whose morality?  But, I mean, in the c- -- I think in the case of, like disabilities or, you know, and so on, it's so clear cut to me that it's wrong to discriminate against someone simply on a medical basis that has, you know, nothing to do with anyone outside of their own circle of loved ones.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I -- I really don't know if these statutes do much in their favor.  I -- I don't know.  You would have a lot more experience with that than I do.  I don't know how long affirmative action has been around.  I guess since the seventies?
R:  Mm.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That would be my guess.  [LAUGH]  At least.
L:  [LAUGH]  I mean, have you -- have you had people tell you about it's easier now than it used to be or ...?
R:  Um, it seems like they have a lot of government programs in now and particularly government organizations.  They want to take in people with disabilities which, in a way -- well, it's wonderful for people to have experience and things like that and to be given the opportunity to have jobs, particularly if they haven't before --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I think there is kind of the danger of [MN] thinking that they're kind of taking people on board as a little project if they're not well trained or -- or things like that.  I think the main issue is making sure that people are trained and they're not, sort of, just being taken under the wing and --
L:  Yeah, that seems kind of patronizing --
R:  Ahah.
R:  -- almost, you know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.  Exactly.  That is the word that I would be using I think.
L:  That would be a difficult decision to make, you know, if I was in that position, saying, "Well, you know, thanks for the job but exactly why did you hire me?"  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And -- and that -- that -- that's kind of a blow to the old self esteem to think, "Oh, you just took me on because I'm a number.  You needed to fill a slot", you know.
R:  Yeah, things really do start at a -- I think before the employment people just, ah, you know, it's a grass roots thing that people need to be trained and need to be given the opportunity from the word go and I think especially, ah, they need to be taught, um, their capability and their capacity to do meaningful things in life.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Do you work with the blind or just anybody that falls into your program or ...?
R:  Um, with -- well I -- let me think.  I do myself.  I'm a member of an organization called the National Federation of the Blind and so I have heard a lot of stories about things like that but my actual job right now, um
