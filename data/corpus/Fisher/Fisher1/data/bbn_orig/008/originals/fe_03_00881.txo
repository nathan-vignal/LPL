R:  Scott.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  
R:  How are you?
L:  How're you doing?
R:  I -- I'm pretty good.
L:  [LAUGH] That's good. [MN]   Okay, so, movies, right? [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um, [LIPSMACK] when was the last time you saw a movie?
R:  Um, just now.
L:  Really?  What'd you see?
R:  [MN] I just saw The Mummy.
L:  Oh, really? [MN] 
R:  Yeah.  It was --
L:  Was it good?  [MN] 
R:  -- on Superstation.  Yeah, it was pretty good.
L:  Yeah --
R:  Yeah, ex- --
L:  I just saw The Goonies.
R:  The Goonies?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah?
L:  It was pretty good.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Wh- where'd you see that at?
L:  [COUGH]  Um, at home.  [MN] 
R:  At home?
L:  Yeah, you know.
R:  On TV or on video?
L:  It was on video --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- and, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, I don't know, I like to go to the movies and everything but I think they're getting kind of expensive.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I kind of prefer to stay at home now, I guess.
R:  Yeah.  I don't like -- 'cause you can't smoke in the movie theater.
L:  Yeah, you're right, you can't.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That is kind of annoying I got to say.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, um, other than that [COUGH] I'm sorry, I'm a little bit sick.
R:  That's okay.
L:  Um, yeah, what else?  When's the last time you saw a movie in a movie theater?
R:  In a movie theater?
L:  Ahah.
R:  Ah, that's, ah, when Lord of the Rings came out, the second one.
L:  Was it good?
R:  Yeah --
L:  Really?
R:  It was great.
L:  [MN]  Sweet.  [MN] 
R:  It was long, but ...
L:  That's what I heard, mhm.  [MN] It was really long.  
R:  It was long.
L:  Was it the second one or the first one?
R:  The second one.
L:  Nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] 
R:  And they had these tree people in it.
L:  [COUGH] What?
R:  They had these tree people in it.
L:  Tree people?
R:  Yeah, they were my favorite characters.  [MN]  There were these trees that were alive. [MN] 
L:  [MN]  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm, that sounds interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is there like a little midget who's like a half -- half rabbit, half, um, [MN] like, person --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- but Elijah Wood, right?  You know what I'm talking about?
R:  Half -- half rabbit, half person?
L:  I thought he was a rabbit but I've never seen it so I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't think so.
L:  Really?
R:  Unless you're thinking Glum.  Are you thinking Glum?
L:  I don't know, maybe.  He's got, like, weird feet or something?  He's got --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- like, weird ears.
R:  Hm, you might be thinking of Glum but --
L:  I don't -- it's Elijah Wood.
R:  -- I don't think he's half rabbit.
L:  He's like a famous movie star.
R:  Ah, I don't know.
L:  You don't know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay.  [COUGH]  [MN]  Um, yeah, good stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I think I'm gonna actually go see that new movie, um, [MN] what is it, um, How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I wouldn't mind paying money for that, yeah, it looks pretty good.
R:  [LAUGH] [MN] 
L:  So, um --
R:  What is it -- a comedy?
L:  Yeah.  You haven't seen previews for it?
R:  No.
L:  It's like, um --
R:  I don't watch much TV.
L:  You don't?
R:  No.
L:  What do you do instead of watching TV?  [MN] 
R:  I go to coffee shops.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That's my life.
L:  Do you, like, play guitar or something?
R:  No.
L:  Music?
R:  No.
L:  You just go and hang out?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  Well, that's good I guess.  You don't waste your time in front of the TV, you know.  [MN] [COUGH] I've been doing that lately 'cause I'm sick so I'm, like, oh, let's just try out a bunch of movies and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- relax, you know what I mean?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE] 
L:  But, so.  Anyway, what else are we supposed to talk about?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, movies.
L:  [NOISE]  Um, okay.  So --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- what else don't you like about going to movie theaters? [MN] 
R:  [NOISE] Um, well, I don't like the prices.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  The biggest thing I don't like though is that I can't smoke in 'em.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, that makes me very angry.
L:  Yeah, I -- I agree. [NOISE]  I think something needs to be done about that. 
R:  [MN] 
L:  [MN] [LIPSMACK] Are you living in New Hampshire?
R:  No, I live in, um, Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, you do?  Okay, I'm actually originally from New York --
R:  Ahah.  
L:  So I was going to say, like, the prices really suck, 'cause they're like nine dollars each time you go --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- but they're probably the same in Pennsylvania, right?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Pretty much.
R:  I'm -- I'm not sure if it's nine dollars but it's like eight something.
L:  Yeah, it's just really expensive.  And then they expect you to, like, buy the food there and it's, like, ridiculous --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know. 
R:  [MN] 
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  So, where -- where do you live now?
L:  [MN]  I actually go to --
R:  New Hampshire?
L:  -- school in New Hampshire.  Mhm.
R:  How'd you end up on this study?
L:  Um, actually it was an email sent out to me --
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  -- from my adviser.  Like, I [MN] am a linguistics major and, sort of, like, oh, okay.
R:  Okay.
L:  Do you want to do it and, like, okay, I'll make ten dollars.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  No worries.  How'd you find out about it?
R:  Um, my -- my girlfriend.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, she works at the place.
L:  Does she?
R:  Yeah, so she sent me the thing.
L:  Oh, okay.  I wasn't really sure if it was, like, valid but I figured if it was through the school it would be, you know? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, I don't know, I guess.  Is this your first time doing it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I missed all the other calls.
L:  You did? [MN] 
R:  Yeah.  [MN] 
L:  I think they tried calling me earlier but my roommate picked up and she was, like, [MN] yeah, no one's answering, so she hung up.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  But I didn't care.  I was asleep and in bed, you know.  
R:  Ahah.
L:  [COUGH]  Um, well staying on topic wise, [LIPSMACK] I don't really know what else more there is to talk about that.  I mean, movie wise, [MN] I don't know.  I guess I like watching movies at home 'cause you can [MN] [LIPSMACK] um, I don't know, pause it whenever you want [LAUGH] and leave [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and get out and do something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I don't know.  This is a little weird.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Plus the refreshments are cheaper at home.
L:  That's true.  You're right.  [MN] 
R:  You can make all the popcorn and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- nachos that you want.
L:  I agree with you there.  [MN] 
R:  And drink all the soda that you want.
L:  Mhm.  And you can smoke, you know.  
R:  Yeah --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- the smoking, that's the big thing for me.
L:  [COUGH]  That's always good.  [MN]  So, you're a hard core smoker, huh?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, me too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  Ah, movies, yeah, movies.  Okay.
R:  Movies.
L:  Movies.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, mm.  [LIPSMACK]  What's the worst movie you've ever seen?
R:  [MN]  The worst movie I've ever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- seen?  Oh, man.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  Um.
L:  Or best one -- which one?  Worst or best -- you can pick?  [MN] 
R:  Oh, I don't know.  Best, um -- let's see, some of my favorites are, [MN] um, let's see, some of my favorite movies.  Let me think.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, Natural Born Killers, [MN] um.
L:  See, that seems a little bit gruesome to me, [LIPSMACK] right?
R:  Ahah.
L:  Yeah.  A little bit gruesome.  [LAUGH]  You like that sort of thing?
R:  Yeah.  Blue Velvet.
L:  [MN]  Blue Velvet.  I've never seen that one actually.
R:  Oh, you never saw that?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  It's by David Lynch.
L:  [LIPSMACK] David Lynch.  You know what movie I actually just saw that's really, really weird but it's good?  It's, um [MN] -- oh God, and I just read the [inaudible] but it's something about dreams and, like, I'm not really usually into all that stuff but it's about -- oh, what is it called?  It's an animation.  [MN]  It's really, really interesting where, um, [MN] the guy from Dazed and Confused, the little kid, have you seen that movie?
R:  Yeah, a long time ago.
L:  He -- h- he's like an animation character in it and so is, like, Ethan Hawke and, um, all these, like, five different artists [MN] they do their artwork for each scene and, um, kind of compiled it all together [MN] and it turned out to be this really trippy movie where it's [COUGH] about this guy talking about, like, his dreams and stuff and how he thinks he's all stuck in a dream and stuff.  It's cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If I could remember the name of it I'd suggest you'd see it but --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- can't remember.
R:  Yeah, so that's no help.
L:  Yeah, I know, right?  [COUGH]  So, you like Natural Born Killers and the David Lynch one, you said?
R:  Yeah, Blue Velvet --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, ah, Lost Highway, and --
L:  I've never, like, heard of these.  Are they, like, are they famous movies?  I mean [MN] --
R:  Yeah, I think so.
L:  Really?  [MN]  Weird.  Never heard of 'em.
R:  Ah, Quentin Tarantino  -- Quentin Tarantino movies.
L:  [MN]  Okay, now, I've heard the guy.  He -- did he do Pulp Fiction?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, yeah.
R:  Reservoir Dogs and [MN], um --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  Dust Till Dawn.
L:  Yeah.  I'm more of a chick flick girl, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Hence the reason why I'm going to see that new one.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, the one -- I don't think you'd like it. [MN]  [COUGH] 
R:  I kind of like chick flicks too.
L:  Do you really? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like what?
R:  Like, um, hm [MN].  I remember I saw Piano.  Did you ever see The Piano?
L:  [MN]  No, that's a weird movie.  It's weird.
R:  That's a chick flick.
L:  Piano?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Is it really?  I just thought it was bizarre.  I'm like, uh, [LIPSMACK] I don't know about that one.  Did you like it though?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You did?  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  Oh, that's cool, you know.  [MN]  [COUGH]  I don't -- I really don't think that's very chick flicky though.  [MN] 
R:  No?
L:  Ah, no.  [LAUGH]  Not compared to, like, [LIPSMACK] Moulin Rouge or something, you know.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's really girly.  But, [LIPSMACK] whatever, [MN] to each his own, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, let me think, what else is there?  [MN]  [MN]  I don't know.  How long -- how long is this supposed to be for?
R:  Ten minutes.
L:  Ten minutes. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do they cut in -- do they cut in and, like, say, "Okay, you're done", do you think?
R:  Yeah, I think they do.
L:  Oh, they do, okay.  [MN] 
R:  This is the first call I've been on though, so ...
L:  Right, oh, right, yeah.  I didn't know if your girlfriend might have told you more about it.
R:  Yeah, she just told me, yeah they do.
L:  [MN]  How they just, like, call you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. [COUGH]  Okay.  Ah, what
