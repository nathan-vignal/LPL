L:  [MN]  Hello?
R:  Hi.  Hello.
L:  [MN] Hi.
R:  Hi.  This is Ashish[?].
L:  Ashish? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hi.  I'm Christina.
R:  Hi, Christina.  
L:  Nice --
R:  How're you doing?
L:  Good.  How're you?
R:  Ah, I'm good too.
L:  Good, good.  [MN]  So, we get to talk about time travel?  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, time travel, yeah, I --I guess so.  [MN] 
L:  Sounds interesting.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [MN] 
R:  All right.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, yeah.
L:  Ah, so, if there is something that you would change in your past what -- what do you think it would be?
R:  Ah, what it would be?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, well, ah, I don't seem to think of any situation.  [MN] 
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  [MN] 
L:  Mm, I'll see if I think --
R:  Though --
L:  -- I can think of anything.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah, though I would like, you know, want to go back to certain period of my life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like -- like when I was a kid.  [MN] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, yeah, I mean, you know, perhaps, like, those carefree days.  [MN] 
L:  [LAUGH]  That would be nice, huh?
R:  Yeah, how about you?
L:  With less res- -- less responsibility you mean?
R:  Ah, yeah, less responsibility, all fun.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, um, yeah, you know, getting pampered.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah, yeah. 
R:  [MN] 
L:  I don't know.  I think, ah -- I think I might [LIPSMACK] -- I don't know, if I were to go back I'd -- I'd want to, like, maybe [MN] not do something that I did w- -- that was stupid or -- or say something else [MN] --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- at a certain time, you know?
R:  Oh.
L:  Do you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  I mean, [LAUGH] 'cause you can always think back later and go, "Why did I say that" or, "Why did I do that".
R:  Oh, [MN] is there anything specific in your mind?
L:  I can't think of anything but I do lots of stupid things so it's n- [LAUGH] -- I could probably think of any millions of situations but -- I don't know, [MN] nothing, no, unfortunately [MN] nothing specific is really coming to mind. [MN] 
R:  Yeah, it's -- yeah.  But, you know, I mean, there are a lot of better things you can do with time machines rather than just go and change your past.  [MN] 
L:  Oh, right.  Yeah, I mean, I -- I would think it would be more interesting to go back and, like, maybe, I don't know, figure out the mysteries of something or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know --
R:  Yeah, even go into the --
L:  rather than [NOISE] --
R:  -- even go into the future.
L:  I don't know if I'd want to do that [MN] personally.  I don't know.  I mean, on one hand I would but on the other hand [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I kind of like having it a mystery.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's true too.
L:  What would you wanna go see in the future?
R:  Oh, like, say, I mean, you know, my girlfriend.  [MN] 
L:  [MN]  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]  Who she'll be?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Or my wife.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, that's always --
R:  Something like that.
L:  -- that's always a good thing.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.  Oh, I mean --
L:  I know.
R:  Yeah.  Um, oh well, I mean, and maybe, you know, a couple of hundred years when people are going to Mars or somewhere --
L:  Oh, yeah, that'd be pretty cool.
R:  If I could get to go and travel to them.  [MN] 
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  See -- [MN] [LAUGH]  That would be interesting.  I guess it would be really, really cool to see what kind of things --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people do with science in the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- future and --
R:  Yeah --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- but -- but you are right, like, you know, it's better to keep the future a mystery. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  I mean, I [MN] -- there are times when I'm just like [MN] -- well, just like a little kid, you know, you kind of get impatient, you know, like, "I wanna know now, I wanna know what's going to come" --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- but I think, like, sometimes I talk to my parents, and like, you know, "You just need to be patient [LAUGH] with things like that".  I think I agree with them.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think it's best to be patient.  I mean [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Mm.  Right, ah.  Yeah, that's so true.
L:  I don't know.
R:  I mean, I -- I used to, like, look at all those, you know, horoscope columns sometimes?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like when -- when I was younger.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I think, yeah, like -- like, if -- if they tell you, like, this thing is going to happen --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it sort of happens.  I don't know why.  I mean it's because maybe it's your power of your mind --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- sort of.  You know, if you -- if it says, you know, its going to a bad day, you believe, I mean, it's like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you end up, you know, feeling bad about it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's not a very good thing.  I mean, it's much more fun to be --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- yeah, on the --
L:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, I think it's better to kind of, I mean, if, for example, you're going to have some really big sadness in your future [MN], wouldn't you rather [MN] live not knowing that it's coming 'cause, you know, you'd be living every day like, "Oh no, I'm gonna die in a freak accident" or something like that and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you'd be scared.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  I mean -- [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's -- I agree with you.  I think that's a good point.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's true.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And what else? [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Time travel.  Come on.  Didn't they [several inaudible words] we talk for?
L:  They didn't -- yes [MN].  Well, okay we talked about it now, and now what [LAUGH] -- what is there [inaudible].  I don't know.  Am I allowed to ask where you're calling from?
R:  Yeah, sure.  I'm -- I'm in Cambridge.
L:  In Cambridge?
R:  Yeah.  Cambridge --
L:  Cambridge --
R:  Cambridge, Massachusetts.
L:  Oh really?  Wow!  That's pretty far.
R:  Yeah, how about you?
L:  I'm in Utah.
R:  Wow!  That's --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- really far.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  Isn't that really cool?  [MN] 
R:  Yeah, yeah, it is.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  [MN] 
L:  So, how did you find out about this, ah, program, this little study?
R:  Ah, I mean, the -- so, I'm -- I'm at school here.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like, in Cambridge and so, like, so they sent down like, ah, emai- -- email who want to, like, try to start, why not?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, how about you?
L:  That same thing.  Yeah, I'm out -- I'm at school out here too and I got an email.  I'm studying linguistics and so I thought -- are you studying linguistics or ...?
R:  No, no, I'm not.  I'm -- I'm -- I'm here at the media lab.
L:  Oh, the media lab?
R:  Yeah, yeah, it's a department of media arts and sciences, like, it's an interdisciplinary program.
L:  Oh, that's cool.  So, are you going to, like, go into film and stuff like that or ...?
R:  Ah, I mean, I am -- I am sort of more into, ah -- ah -- ah, it -- like, artificial intelligence and things like that.
L:  Oh, wow!  That's cool.
R:  [MN] 
L:  So, you could actually maybe be one of those people who, I don't know, makes a creature that can go into the future?  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, maybe not, but [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So --
L:  That's so coo- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sounds interesting.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  That sounds interesting.
R:  Yeah.  Right.  So, are you in grad school too?
L:  Ah, I'm not yet actually.  I'm almost done with my undergrad and -- [MN] 
R:  Oh, wow.  Wow.
L:  I'll be -- yeah.  So, [LAUGH] -- I -- I should be -- I feel like I should be finishing my grad -- my graduate program now but, [MN], anyway [MN] -- ah!
R:  Mm.  That's [inaudible] school.  I mean, my -- like, I really miss my undergraduate period.  Like, I --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- enjoyed that most.
L:  [MN]  Uh-huh.
R:  It's like, yeah, I mean --
L:  [MN]  
R:  -- that would be one thing I would definitely like to go back to again.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  To graduate again?
R:  To undergraduate, like, when I was, like, in my four year college.  Now I'm a graduate student here.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, where did you -- where di- -- what did you study with your undergrad?
R:  Ah, I did -- I did my undergraduate in India.
L:  Oh, in India?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I -- I'm guessing that's where you're from?
R:  Oh --
L:  Your name and -- your name and the accent made me think that that's probably where you're from.  Is that right?
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Right.
L:  That's cool.
R:  Yeah, so.  How about you?  Where are you, like, are you from Utah or somewhere else?
L:  I am from Wisconsin actually.
R:  Oh, wow.  I heard it's really beautiful out there.
L:  It is really pretty.  It's really green.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I'm sure it's actually really green where you are too, like, really pretty.
R:  Oh, I'm like -- I'm -- I'm in -- right in, like, in middle of, like, town.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, it's a city, [MN] like, very near to Boston.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so, we don't really see a lot of trees.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh [LAUGH]. 
R:  [MN] 
L:  I'm sure you could probably drive not too far and see some.  Right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's cool.
R:  Yeah, that's the thing, yeah, yeah.  
L:  That's good.
R:  I mean, yeah, once in a while I go out but it's like, but like, in -- it's in middle of, like, concrete jungle such[?].  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]  Mm.  Interesting. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  That's cool.
R:  Oh, you haven't been to, like, ah, Massachusetts or Boston?
L:  No, I've -- I've been wanting to go for so long.  I have friends that have been out there, friends that have lived out in Boston area --
R:  Oh, oh.
L:  -- and they just say how much they love it and I would -- I would love to go.
R:  Yeah, oh.
L:  See, I hear it's pretty cool out there but --
R:  Yeah, right now it's -- I mean, I don't know as compared to Utah how -- how is the, like, the weather there, like in past few days it's been really cold out here.
L:  Well, it's actually -- it's started to get -- started getting colder here.  It -- we've been having kinda really warm weather lately but --
R:  Oh, is it?  Wow.
L:  Yeah, it's really, really odd.  It's usually pretty cold in the winter but [MN] right now it's been pretty warm but this last few days it's been getting colder, so [LIPSMACK] -- 
R:  Mm, okay.
L:  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's winter.  I don't know.  And we're -- I mean, right -- I'm right in the middle of the mountains --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and so -- of the Rocky Mountains -- and so, the -- it gets -- we're supposed to get a lot of snow --
R:  Lot of --
L:  -- but we haven't been getting a lot this year.  So, hopefully we'll get more 'cause in the summer time we have droughts, like --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- because we don't have enough water, so [MN] --
R:  Oh, I see.  Yeah.
L:  Who knows?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess we'll see.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, like, did -- how's your school going?  Is this your final term?
L:  Say that again.  I'm sorry, what?
R:  Is this your final term in school?
L:  Yes, my final term.  Hallelujah!
R:  Wow, that's good, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, what are you planning to do after that?
L:  Well, I will probably be working for a little while to save money and then I'll go to grad school.  [MN] 
R:  Oh, that's good.  That's great.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  So, I don't know where I will go to grad school or exactly what I'll study either but [MN] I do know that I wanna do that.  So, I'm -- I'm gonna wait just a little while and save up money.  Do you know what -- how lo- -- how much longer do you have with your graduate?
R:  Oh, I'm -- I'm here for a while actually.  I just, I mean, I've started my grad school a couple of years back.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I'm, like -- I -- I'm in the PhD program --
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh.
R:  -- so it'll be a while before --
L:  So, it'll be a while.  Oh.
R:  Yeah, yeah, so I'm --
L:  Wow, that's -- that's really cool.  I really respect that 'cause it's a
