R:  Hi.  My name is Stephen Matthews.
L:  Oh, yes.  Ah, my name is Brandi Gentilly[?].  Um, I'm calling on [MN] -- from Memphis, Tennessee and I was calling to ask you about, um, [MN] popular, ah, reality TV shows.
R:  Okay.  It's not a --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- real, ah, familiar topic with me.  I'm not into 'em.  I'm pretty much, ah, not against them, but I just don't see the purpose.  I think they're pretty ridiculous usually on their premises.
L:  Yes, sir.  Um, [MN] well, like, what do you think about Survivor shows or, ah --
R:  I think the Survivors might be the -- one of the few legitimate, if -- if at all, if any of 'em are legitimate.  I think, ah, [MN] when, you know, ah, ah, my wife and I were just talking the other day about the, um, the Joe Millionaire --
L:  Oh, yes, sir.
R:  -- and all of these things, that they're -- it's totally ludicrous. 
L:  [MN] 
R:  There's new ones starting up, um, comparing --
L:  Married --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Married by America.  Yes, that's it.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  Yes, sir.
R:  I mean, I started to watch that.  I went, you know, I've never watched an entire hour of any of these reality TV sh- shows though I've started to -- okay, you know, I've started at the very beginning of that one coming on --
L:  Yes, sir.
R:  -- and I've said, let me, um, you know, see what I -- what I can do watching this from the top and I watched for about, oh, maybe eight or ten minutes and they had this girl come on and she started talking and I just started laughing and just [MN] changed the channel and said, "This is so ridiculous".
L:  It is, the things people put on TV these days.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I mean, what is -- what is it showing our young people?
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- truly a cri- -- not a crime, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it -- it's truly -- they're [MN] -- i- it's like they're really hard up for television [LAUGH] or something.
L:  Yes, sir, I mean --
R:  But --
L:  Survivor, it -- it has a, um, kind of a good topic show and, you know, kinda how the old people were, how they had to make it in the [MN], you know --
R:  What was that?
L:  -- without food and water and --
R:  What is that you're talking about?
L:  [MN]  Survivor.
R:  Yeah, right.  Right.
L:  You know, I mean, that -- that is okay but I mean ...
R:  Yeah, but, well, there is something they're trying to do there.  I mean, there is truly a contest but, I mean, with this, um, ah, you know, Joe Millionaire thing --
L:  That was just one big lie --
R:  It was a scam.
L:  -- you know.  I mean.
R:  It was just out and out a scam, um, [MN] these -- the -- I saw one one time where they had to climb in a box with scorpions.  I think it was --
L:  Oh, that is, what is that?  Um ...
R:  Fear Factor, or ...
L:  Fear Factor, yes, sir.
R:  You know, I mean, goodness gracious.  It's -- I mean, that's --
L:  I mean, just think, well, eleven year, twelve year old kids, [MN] "Ooh, I'm gonna try this at home".  [MN] 
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.
L:  Yes, sir.
R:  I mean, it's almost as bad as, um, what's the one that they did the movie of where the guys would try the -- yeah, I think it was an MTV show and they just made a movie of it.
L:  Real World?  Was that it?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, um, ah --
R:  Oh, where they beat up -- y- you know, the guy beats on his -- beats -- beats people up and, oh, I can't think of the name of it.
L:  I know what you're t- -- is it little, like, fake people or something?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Oh, I know what you're talking about.
R:  Right, right.  I mean, it's almost like --
L:  Celebrity Death Match?
R:  That might be --
L:  Is that it?
R:  -- what I was thinking of, yeah.  But --
L:  Little play dough people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Kind of.
R:  But, good Lord, it's, ah, reality TV has taken on such a -- a -- a genre that we've --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- got, you know, every station has two or three or four --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- going on and, man, I wish we could find something better to watch.  I mean I, yeah, of course, you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- can.  [MN] Ah, ah, like I said, I haven't watched 'em --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but it's amazing also the number --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of people that are watching these things.  They're the hottest things on television.
L:  I know.  [NOISE]  Joe Millionaire was rated the highest [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in America.  That's the time --
R:  Right, and that one --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- was so stupid and then they come up now they're saying that they've got a -- they've figured out a way to have a new twist on it [MN] --
L:  Yes, sir.
R:  -- next year.  What are they gonna do?  [LAUGH]  You know.
L:  Ah, that's exactly right.  
R:  So, yeah, I'm, ah -- it -- I laughed when the guy just --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the computer just said, "Our topic today [MN]  --"
L:  Michael!
R:  -- is reality TV".  I just started laughing.  I said, "Well, they could hardly have picked a [MN] -- a worse topic for me".  I am so un- ah, familiar, uneducated on these --
L:  Mike!
R:  -- reality TVs.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- um, so, are you doing the same thing I am?  Are you a -- a participant, I mean, a -- in the education part of this?
L:  Um.
R:  You're just taking this test and getting paid for it too?
L:  Yes, sir.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh --
L:  Talking to people about different things and ...
R:  Okay.  Well, ah, let's hear some of your accent.  I think that's what they're looking for.  Is that right?
L:  I guess.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, no, I really don't, ah, [MN] I don't care too much for television.
R:  Right.
L:  I have two children and [MN] I like to focus them more on church activities and, um, [LIPSMACK] different [MN], you know, just teaching 'em, you know, what's good [MN] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in this world and what's -- what's bad.
R:  Right.  Right.  Well, television can be a wonderful tool.  I mean, I -- I do watch a lot.  My -- my wife laughs 'cause I watch a lot of the history channel, ah, and A and E, ah, Discovery Channel and stuff like that and she laughs.  She says as soon as she walks in the room [MN] if it's black and white pictures of Nazis she knows that I'm watching the history channel.
L:  Oh, yes, sir.  [MN] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  They watch a lot of [MN] PBS [MN] and, ah, [MN] [LIPSMACK] they like the -- the Livetime Channel.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Some of their stuff, Touched by an Angel [MN] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they like that show.  Miracles --
R:  Right.
L:  They like that too, but just [MN] [MN] I really don't care for 'em to watch [MN] --
R:  Well --
L:  -- shows that tell lies.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah, well the thing about watch- -- I mean for kids watching television it's, for the most part, it's so un- ah, productive in -- in them with their own imaginations and stuff.  It's all laid out there in front of 'em.  I know as I'm substantially older than you are but I'm, you know, in my late forties, but as a kid [MN] so much of our playtime was we'd have, ah, ah, you know, a few inanimate objects like plastic cars and we'd --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- have this life that went on.
L:  Yes, sir.
R:  That, you know, we'd make it up, you know, totally imaginary, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, and, you know, we did the sink[?] and we made the premises.  We made the characters.  We made the what was going on in the thing and, you know, ah, it was totally imaginary, [MN] and I also laugh because [MN] when you watch TV like, um, oh, the older shows like Leave it to Beaver and Andy Griffith and all these --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- you see these kids that are wonderful actors, well that's how kids played.  You -- you were an actor as a kid.  You know, you'd say let's play sleeping beauty or whatever --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you just totally made it up.  So, kids were great actors.  Then when they got to be -- you know, so many of the -- the kids that are actors can't, ah, become adult actors because, well as kids they weren't doing anything but, you know, pretending.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] 
R:  So, it was, you know, much easier for these kids to be actors than [MN] as grownups.
L:  Exactly.  They can't go out here and act like, hey, I'm Joe, [MN] you know.
R:  Yeah.  Unfortunately it's going to be Joe Millionaire, you know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes, sir.  I mean I can't think like I have a million dollars.
R:  No, I can't imagine that.
L:  [LAUGH]  Or, you know --
R:  I can't imagine that.  My credit card doesn't let me imagine that.
L:  I can't go out in my backyard and act like I'm going to kill an alligator [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or --
R:  Right, right.
L:  [LAUGH]  You know.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Six year old kids acting like, [MN] "I'm getting married".
R:  Right, right.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I -- I -- I guess they're going to run their course but it -- you know, I sure didn't think they were going to last as long as they did, the -- the reality based shows but they're --
L:  I can't either.
R:  But, ah, they don't seem to be slowing down in popularity in the least.
L:  No, sir.
R:  So, we'll, ah --
L:  I would have thought they were kinda, you know, kinda had their popularity and then just kind of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, went off TV.
R:  Yeah.  Maybe the second Survivor --
L:  Like a stage, I guess.  [MN] 
R:  -- would have been, you know, over but, ah --
L:  But they just keep on.  It's like they got a lot of money just to give a million dollars out here and a million dollars out there and ...
R:  Well, truthfully, it's pretty cheap --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- television because, ah, you look at, um, oh, I don't know, just the show, Frazier, he gets, you know, ah, I don't know the exact numbers, but he gets over a million dollars per episode.
L:  Like Friends.
R:  Yeah, those guys, you kn- -- each one of those guys are getting more than a million dollars per episode not counting [MN] the filming costs and the writers and all of that, so, these Survivor things are pretty cheap forms of, you know, of television.  So, it's not that, it's, you know, it's that it works.
L:  Yes, sir.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  So --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- it --
L:  I know sometimes I wish I had a lot of money like some of these reality TV people do but then in other words I just think of how miserable I would be.  [MN] 
R:  [MN]  I'd like to give it a try out -- I don't know how miserable I would be.
L:  Well, I mean, not necessarily be --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- miserable but just have so much money I wouldn't know what to do with it.
R:  Well, I think --
L:  You know.
R:  I think, you know, like they say that the money can corrupt the people but I think very often it's --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- you're a pretty corrupt person already.  I mean, i- if you're a good person I think you can -- you can --
L:  You could find something -- 
R:  -- you can think[?] a few million dollars and --
L:  Yes.
