R:  Hello
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name's Claudia.
L:  My name is Jeneva.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm okay.  [LAUGH] Um, where are you?
R:  I'm in Chicago, Illinois.
L:  Okay, I'm in Pittsburgh.
R:  Okay.
L:  Pennsylvania, yeah.
R:  Well, the topic is, if we wanted to change something that we've done, travel in time, what would we change?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's kind of a hard question, right? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, um, I don't know, I don't like t- I don't like to think that I would like to change something because I know I can't, so ...
R:  That's true.
L:  Um.
R:  Let's see.  I'm trying to think.  I feel like I need a moment to think of a big one, you know.
L:  Yeah, me too.  Yeah, um.
R:  I guess, I don't know, I -- I can -- I can think of one, like, I don't really [LAUGH] regret much but, one thing I would do, I broke my arm once when I was, I don't know, um, I think I was in fifth or sixth grade --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I broke my arm by getting on a horse and the horse threw me off --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a- and so I guess I would go back and change something like that because I still have a little bit of problems in my arm.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Like, it's not flexible, so I'm still kind of paying for it.
L:  Wow, yeah.
R:  So that's something I would change.  Can you think of anything?
L:  Um, nothing, no single incident like that comes to mind just now.  Um, maybe, ah, I -- if I could regret -- maybe, ah, you know the normal regrets.  I wish I worked harder, I wish I was more active, in general, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  When I was -- when I was in college, and --
R:  Uh-huh.
R:  I wish I was -- um, I regret more things I didn't do than the things I did, you know.
R:  Yeah.  That's a good way to be.
L:  I mean, I think there were so many opportunities, that I didn't do enough, so ...
R:  Right.
L:  But there -- there's no one incident that I can think of.
R:  Yeah, yeah, it's kind of hard. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm trying to think, like, with relationships, things I would have done differently in relationships.
L:  Um, yeah.
R:  I guess, like, I -- I argued a lot with my last boyfriend, I guess I would have changed that, either not have argued at all or would have broken up with him earlier so that arguing wouldn't have occurred at all.
L:  Yeah.  Y- you -- you think it was a waste of ev- I mean, everybody's --
R:  Right, kind of.  Yeah, because I'm not, you know, I don't really, ah, that's not really me, I'm not into arguing and I was surprised to see myself getting into that kind of um, pattern, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's something that I kind of regret, like, being in a personal situation like that.
L:  I don't know.  I don't have any kind of thing either, maybe I fight a lot with my sister but we will still be -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Do you still fight with her, or just when you're a bit off?
L:  Yeah, still --
R:  Oh really?  Okay.
L:  Still, [several inaudible words]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  And, wh- what's the question?  What we would change about ourselves, or ...?
R:  Yeah, wh- if we could go back in time, what would we have changed about our own lives?  Like, something we could have done differently to change our lives.
L:  No.  Ah, yeah, I don't know, just, um, just work harder I think. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I can't really say that about myself.
L:  Oh wow, that's nice.
R:  I'm in -- I'm in grad school right now so I'm still working hard.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I'm in grad school too actually.
R:  Oh, really, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well now's the time to work hard then.
L:  Yeah, that -- that's true, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  What -- what -- what -- what school are you at?
L:  Um, I'm at PET[?]
R:  At PET? Okay.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  How about you?
R:  I'm at the University of Illinois.
L:  Illinois in Chicago, yeah.
R:  Yeah, in Chicago.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are you a psych major or ...? 
L:  No, um, I'm -- I've not got nothing to do with them, I'm doing international relations.
R:  Okay.  All right.
L:  Are you doing psychology?
R:  Yeah, I'm in psych.
L:  Okay.
R:  This is psycho, this linguistics.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  This study, is it psycho linguistics?
L:  Um, I don't know.
R:  I don't even know either.  It might be psych, but I'm not sure.
L:  Yeah.  Is it -- [several inaudible words] actually, I've no idea --
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  Okay [LAUGH] that's -- it's a -- I don't know, um, what else we're supposed to be talking about.
R:  Ah, we should probably try to keep talking about it because that's what they want us to do.
L:  [several inaudible words] yeah.
R:  I've been thinking more of regrets now.  I -- I guess I would have slept with fewer guys.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] See, I can't say anything like that, because ah, the kind of community that I come from.  I come from India --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- and um --
R:  -- yeah, that's dif-.
L:  Yeah, it's different, so ...
R:  -- yeah, yeah.
L:  Ah, if I would say in th -- I don't kn- I don't know if this is something I regret, but I might regret after some time, which is that I'm twenty six now and I'm getting to be old by Indian standards for marriage, but I don't think I am --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I have -- I don't know if -- if one year I'll regret that ah, I stubbornly, you know, um, refused getting into th- that type of thing that -- that typically people do get into in my setup, you know, like the, um, arranged marriage.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I refu- I didn't do that for a long time --
R:  Uh- huh.
L:  -- so I don't know -- I don't know if I will regret it one day, but I don't just now. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Right.  Well, it's something you don't regret now though.
L:  Yeah, I don't.  Not now, but, yeah, I don't know if I'll start thinking I'm getting older --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and if I change my mind and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then it may be too late to.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, so ...
R:  [SIGH] Hm.
L:  Yeah, I guess I have feelings that I might regret -- that's what it is ...
R:  Right, right.
L:  Um ...
R:  Is it still an option for you to take that route right now, or not?
L:  Oh, yes, well I'm kind of getting in -- in I'm half in and half out.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, but bearing in mind I'm a little late, so ...
R:  How old are you?
L:  Because -- I'm twenty six, and a lot of my friends are -- ah, some of my friends are married and have kids --
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, but some are not.  Increasingly there are a lot of people, I think, are postponing it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But ...
R:  Mhm.  
L:  I don't know.
R:  Well, yeah, you're still young, I think.  [LAUGH] Personally.
L:  What did you say?
R:  I think you're still young, you have time.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah, that's nice, time too, yeah.  [LAUGH] Yeah, I like to think so.
R:  [COUGH] Um, yeah, some day I'll probably regret not having a closer relationship with my father, although I currently don't regret that.
L:  Oh, who cares[?]
R:  And probably when he dies I'll feel bad about it, but, that's like something, like you just said, where I could see myself regretting something in the future.
L:  Yeah.  But now -- now you don't feel bad.
R:  Right.  It just makes me nervous to know, like, that, he -- you know, he'll die some day and then I'll probably regret it, but ...
L:  Oh.  Is he unwell or something?
R:  No, he's just old.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  But I feel like, it's partially, I mean, I'm not totally to blame for that situation either, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's partially him, too, so.  Well, it's good we don't have any regrets but I mean, this is sort of a bad topic of conversation for us.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I mean, if have a big regret and problems like everything [inaudible] and something like it is[?] yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, the only thing you can do, is if you do it different is you r- realize it at that time and then you decide to learn from that and so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- hopefully you don't keep it in your head that I should have done that, I shouldn't have --
R:  Yeah, right.  People who have regrets basically are living in the past.
L:  Yeah, I think so, yeah, that's true.
R:  I don't know if I could.
L:  Yeah, and, yeah, you have to deal with it, whatever it is and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- more --
R:  And I mean, if you- if your past was different your life trajectory could be totally different from what it is now.
L:  Yeah, and who knows which one is better, which one is --
R:  I know, it's hard to think, like, would I really be a better -- in a better situation if I would have made different choices.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Could have even been worse.
L:  Yeah, it's impossible to say that, yeah.
R:  And even, I mean, even bad choices that you've made can make you a better person in the end, or a stronger person.
L:  Oh, absolutely.  How, actually talking about regret, I can see something in the recent past that I-- I should be regretting, which is that I took a major on my comprehensive exam without studying for it and of course, I'm paying for it because I failed.
R:  Oh.
L:  And it was I -- I -- I got into that because I was having a difficult time with one particular professor and I was telling myself that I can fight it but I didn't and it was -- it was a messy psychological situation and I ended up not studying at all.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, yeah, that would be one regret --
R: Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I should have -- I should even not have taken the exam or I should have studied for it, yeah.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I'm sure if I thought harder I could think of little things.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I think that's what's for me also, things are coming up now. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I guess, I was broken into a few months ago and I regret now not getting renter's insurance.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  In hindsight. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that -- that kind of thing usually happens only when something bad happens to us, or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I don't think you would have thought -- would you have thought about that before?
R:  Yeah, not really.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I had heard people mention that word before, renter's insurance, but I never really --
L:  Yeah.  I have no idea what it is actually.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I actually, even, I have heard of it but I haven't -- I don't have it either, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I guess it's a good thing to have.  I'm looking into it now but it's sort of expensive anyway.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I probably won't get it anyway. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it protects against [inaudible] and any kind of natural disaster damage.
L:  Oh.
R:  That's what it does.
