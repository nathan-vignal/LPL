I'M DOING GREAT THANKS HOW ARE YOU  (fe_03_02012-B-0004)
AWESOME  (fe_03_02012-B-0005)
THE TOPIC IS CORPORATE SCANDAL AND HOW WHAT AMERICAN GOVERNMENT CAN DO TO CURB CORPORATE SCANDAL  (fe_03_02012-B-0006)
YOU WANT MY YOU WANT MY THOUGHTS ON IT OR JUST YOU WANT ME TO SPIT SOME RHYMES ON IT  (fe_03_02012-B-0007)
YOU'RE ON A CELLPHONE RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_02012-B-0008)
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY JUST CORPORATE ABOUT CORPORATE SCANDAL AND SUCH  (fe_03_02012-B-0009)
YEAH ME NEITHER  (fe_03_02012-B-0010)
WELL THIS IS WHAT I THINK ABOUT CORPORATE SCANDALS  (fe_03_02012-B-0011)
I I'M KIND OF TORN BETWEEN THE ISSUE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE ON ONE HAND I THINK THAT BUSINESS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO TO I DON'T KNOW RUN THIS COUNTRY I THINK ADAM SMITH'S  (fe_03_02012-B-0012)
WEALTH OF NATIONS AND ADAM SMITH'S FREE MARKET OR LAISSEZ FAIRE ECONOMY IS WHAT REALLY DRIVES THIS COUNTRY  (fe_03_02012-B-0013)
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I THINK WE'VE COME TO A POINT WHERE BIG BUSINESS HAS COME TO DOMINATE NOT ONLY THE ECONOMIC FACET OF THIS COUNTRY BUT ALSO THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FACET OF THIS COUNTRY AND I DON'T THINK  (fe_03_02012-B-0014)
YOU DON'T AGREE WITH ME  (fe_03_02012-B-0015)
OH YOU WOULD HAVE TO AGREE WITH ME WELL THAT'S GOOD I'M GLAD WE'RE IN AGREEMENT WHAT'S YOUR NAME  (fe_03_02012-B-0016)
TONI MAY  (fe_03_02012-B-0017)
WELL I'M GLAD WE'RE IN AGREEMENT ON THIS SHOULD I CONTINUE  (fe_03_02012-B-0018)
OKAY WELL LIKE I WAS SAYING  (fe_03_02012-B-0019)
LIKE AS I THINK THAT IT IS NEC- IS NECESSARY FOR BUSINESSES TO  (fe_03_02012-B-0020)
I DON'T KNOW TO DETERMINE  (fe_03_02012-B-0021)
THE ECONOMIC PROGRESS OF THIS COUNTRY I ALSO THINK THAT THEY'VE  (fe_03_02012-B-0022)
COME TO A POINT WHERE IT'S THEY'RE DETERMINING TOO MUCH OF THE PROGRESS OF THIS COUNTRY AND I THINK MORE POWER NEEDS TO BE RESTORED TO THE COUNTRY AND LIKE WE'VE SEEN IN ENRON AND OTHER MAJOR CORPORATE SCANDALS THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO STEP IN AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE COMMON MAN  (fe_03_02012-B-0023)
AND THEY'RE NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE STOCK HOLDER  (fe_03_02012-B-0024)
OKAY  (fe_03_02012-B-0025)
ALL LIKE AND I THINK THE GOVERNMENT HAS A ROLE IN STEPPING IN AND SAYING THAT NO YOU CAN'T PULL THE WOOL OVER THE EYES 'CAUSE I MEAN  (fe_03_02012-B-0026)
I THINK THE AVERAGE AMERICAN IS FAIRLY EDUCATED AND KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON BUT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND THE INNER WORKINGS AND THE INTERNAL WORKINGS OF THE CORPORATE WORLD  (fe_03_02012-B-0027)
AND I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF WHICH IS I THINK WHAT HAPPENED WITH ENRON  (fe_03_02012-B-0028)
THESE PEOPLE BUY STOCK AND THEN THE THE C._E._O.S AND THE OTHER BIG WIGS OF THIS COMPANY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM AND THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR  (fe_03_02012-B-0029)
NO I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR I THINK THE GOVERNMENT HAS A JOB AND HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO STEP IN AND MAKE SURE THIS KIND OF THING DOESN'T GO ON  (fe_03_02012-B-0030)
MM THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND A PRESSING ISSUE IN TODAY'S CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY WHAT I SUGGEST IS THAT COM- COMPANIES BE LEFT ALONE BECAUSE WE DO STILL INDEED EXIST IN A LAISSEZ FAIRE ECONOMY  (fe_03_02012-B-0031)
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT IF THERE SEEMS TO BE IRREGULARITIES IN THE ECONOMY AND IF CERTAIN COMPANIES SEEM TO BE MAKING UNREAL PROFITS OR IF PEOPLE SEEM TO BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF I THINK THEN  (fe_03_02012-B-0032)
CERTAIN MONITORS IN THE GOVERNMENT NEED TO STEP IN AND SEE THAT I THINK THAT THE ECONOMY SHOULD BE MONITORED IN SUCH A WAY THAT  (fe_03_02012-B-0033)
THE BUSINESSES SHOULD BE LEFT ALONE BUT IF CERTAIN EXTREMITIES ARE CAUSED OR PEOPLE  (fe_03_02012-B-0034)
SEE THAT BUSINESSES ARE TAKING TOO FAR ADVANTAGE OF THE PEOPLE THEN I THINK THE GOVERNMENT HAS A JOB TO STEP IN AND AND PREVENT THIS KIND OF THING FROM HAPPENING  (fe_03_02012-B-0035)
RIGHT  (fe_03_02012-B-0036)
MHM  (fe_03_02012-B-0037)
WELL YOU KNOW I YOU MAKE A VERY GOOD POINT AND I THINK THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR RIGHT NOW FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO DRAW A LINE WHERE THEY CAN INTERCEDE AND WHERE THEY CAN'T BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE A SOCIETY WHERE  (fe_03_02012-B-0038)
THE GOVERNMENT IS STILL VERY SCARED AND WELL AND WELL THEY SHOULD BE TO STEP IN AND PREVENT A A COMPANY FROM DOING SUCH AND SUCH ACTIVITY UM  (fe_03_02012-B-0039)
MM GOOD QUESTION  (fe_03_02012-B-0040)
I THINK UNLESS THERE'S EXISTING DOUBT THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS ABUSING OR THAT A CERTAIN COMPANY IS ABUSING PRIVILEGES OF PULLING THE WOOL OVER THE EYES OF THEIR INVESTORS AND CERTAIN STOCK HOLDERS THEY SHOULD BE LEFT ALONE UM  (fe_03_02012-B-0041)
I'M NOT VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE INNER WORKINGS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND I'M NOT VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE LEGISLATURE OF GOVERNMENT SO I CAN'T GIVE YOU SPECIFIC  (fe_03_02012-B-0042)
AH LEGISLATURE ON HOW THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD PREVENT THIS SORT OF THING FROM HAPPENING I MEAN I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE A CERTAIN LINE WHICH WITH  (fe_03_02012-B-0043)
MM THERE SHOULD BE A CERTAIN LINE  (fe_03_02012-B-0044)
WHERE WHICH THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD STEP IN BUT FOR THE MOST PART COMPANIES AND THE ECONOMY SHOULD BE LEFT ALONE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_02012-B-0045)
YEAH I THINK IT'S A CAPITALIST ECONOMY AND THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD LEAVE IT  (fe_03_02012-B-0046)
YEAH  (fe_03_02012-B-0047)
[LAUGHTER] YEAH IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT DEBATE I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU  (fe_03_02012-B-0048)
MM  (fe_03_02012-B-0049)
WHEN LIKE YOU'RE YOU'RE ASKING ME  (fe_03_02012-B-0050)
YOU'RE ASKING ME FOR A DEFINITE POINT IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE AUTHORIZATION TO STEP IN AND PREVENT CERTAIN COMPANIES FROM ABUSING THEIR RIGHTS  (fe_03_02012-B-0051)
YEAH  (fe_03_02012-B-0053)
YEAH  (fe_03_02012-B-0054)
