THAT WE'VE SAID OR SAY IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE TYPING IT OUT IT'S LIKE OH I COULD USE A BETTER WORD OR I COULD SAY IT THIS WAY INSTEAD  (fe_03_02091-B-0041)
I THINK THAT HELPS PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY COMMUNICATE BETTER  (fe_03_02091-B-0042)
WITH EACH OTHER AND THEN ALSO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS WHEN YOU FIRST MEET SOMEBODY FACE TO FACE OR EVEN ON THE PHONE AND HOW DIFFICULT THAT CAN BE TO ESTABLISH A RAPPORT  (fe_03_02091-B-0043)
WHEREAS THIS LIKE IT'S KIND OF A RAPPORT BUILT IN  (fe_03_02091-B-0044)
