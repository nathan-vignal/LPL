ANOTHER THIRTY TO SIXTY DAYS BEFORE THEY WOULD MAIL THEM OUT BECAUSE  (fe_03_02008-A-0093)
THEY WERE IN FINANCIAL TROUBLE THEY WERE TRYING TO OPEN TOO MANY RESTAURANTS TOO FAST AND THEN THE CORPORATE PEOPLE WERE JUST WAY SPENDING WAY TOO MUCH MONEY  (fe_03_02008-A-0094)
AND UM  (fe_03_02008-A-0095)

OH RIGHT I KNOW I I ACTUALLY HAD A FRIEND THAT LIVED UP THERE SO I'M FAMILIAR WITH THAT AREA  (fe_03_02008-B-0007)
THEY LIVE IN CAMILLUS WHICH IS RIGHT AROUND THERE TOO  (fe_03_02008-B-0009)
IT IT'S A TOWN CALLED CAMILLUS RIGHT UP THERE IT  (fe_03_02008-B-0010)
IS VERY NICE UP THERE  (fe_03_02008-B-0011)
BASICALLY THEY WANT TO KNOW UM I THINK IT'S MORE OR LESS A BUSINESS ETHICS KIND OF QUESTION  (fe_03_02008-B-0012)
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO GET US THE WHOLE ENRON THING AND HOW THAT AFFECTED PEOPLE  (fe_03_02008-B-0013)
I PERSONALLY DON'T INVEST IN THE STOCK MARKET BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS FELT LIKE IT WAS SORT OF A FORM OF LEGAL GAMBLING SO FOR ME IT REALLY DIDN'T AFFECT ME VERY MUCH BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SMARTER THAN THAT UH YOU KNOW I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED LIKE IN GOVERNMENT TYPE OF BONDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE SECURE  (fe_03_02008-B-0014)
BUT MY PENSION PLAN THOUGH IS BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE AN  (fe_03_02008-B-0015)
OPTION BECAUSE I'M A TEACHER HERE I DON'T HAVE AN OPTION IT IS ACTUALLY CORPORATE BONDS LIKE CORPORATE KIND OF STOCK THING  (fe_03_02008-B-0016)
MHM  (fe_03_02008-B-0017)
SO I GUESS IT DIDN'T REALLY AFFECT YOU  (fe_03_02008-B-0018)
BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK FOR CURBING I MEAN I DON'T KNOW THERE THERE'S ALMOST NO WAY OF CURBING IT BECAUSE IT'S REALLY IN TERMS OF CORPORATIONS IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL BY INDIVIDUAL THING I MEAN YOU COULD HAVE RULES SET UP IN YOUR COMPANY THAT YOU DON'T DO CERTAIN THINGS  (fe_03_02008-B-0019)
BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T FOLLOW THOSE RULES  (fe_03_02008-B-0020)
IT DOESN'T QUITE MATTER WHAT THE COMPANY YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN LIKE  (fe_03_02008-B-0021)
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE LIKE A FRIEND OF MINE WORKS FOR A BARRISTER AND THEY HAVE A RULE RIGHT NOW THAT YOU ACTUALLY CANNOT TRAVEL TO HONG KONG BUT PEOPLE HAVE CLIENTS OVER THERE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FOLLOW THAT RULE BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE A LOT OF MONEY YOU  (fe_03_02008-B-0022)
KNOW SO IT IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFICULT THING I MEAN  (fe_03_02008-B-0023)
WELL YEAH I MEAN THAT'S IT'S PRETTY CLEAR IT WAS THE BIG GUYS AND THEY JUST MESSED UP THE LITTLE GUYS  (fe_03_02008-B-0025)
YOU KNOW NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF LIKE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING LIKE JUST DRAINING THE COMPANY YOU KNOW TAKING AWAY FROM THEIR SALARIES BUT I MEAN IN THE END THEY TOOK AWAY THEIR PENSIONS I MEAN PEOPLE WHO INVESTED THEIR ENTIRE  (fe_03_02008-B-0026)
LIFE SAVINGS IT WAS JUST GONE  (fe_03_02008-B-0027)
WELL THAT'S THE THING I ALWAYS THINK LIKE THE GOVERNMENT SOMEHOW COULD SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THIS WHOLE THING BECAUSE  (fe_03_02008-B-0028)
IT'S SORT OF LIKE AN F._D._I._C. SORT OF THING WHERE IF YOU DO INVEST IN A CERTAIN COMPANY AND YOU DO WORK FOR THEM I FEEL LIKE THERE SHOULD BE SOME KIND OF  (fe_03_02008-B-0029)
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S GOING LIKE UH SOME KIND OF AN INSURANCE  (fe_03_02008-B-0030)
I MEAN IT'S HARD TO DO BECAUSE EVERY COMPANY IS DIFFERENT BUT IT  (fe_03_02008-B-0031)
JUST SEEMS REALLY UNFAIR  (fe_03_02008-B-0032)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_02008-B-0033)
YEAH I MEAN I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW IT BUT SEE I DON'T UN- I I MEAN IT'S A TOUGH TOPIC BECAUSE HOW DO YOU MAKE A CORPORATION MORE ACCOUNTABLE  (fe_03_02008-B-0034)
YOU CAN ONLY MAKE INDIVIDUALS MORE ACCOUNTABLE AND THAT WOULD BE VARIABLE DEPEND- YOU KNOW ON EACH COMPANY THEY WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT SET OF RULES  (fe_03_02008-B-0035)
WELL YEAH THAT'S THE THING I MEAN BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU KNOW THAT SOMEONE IS MILKING THE COMPANY DRY OR THEY DON'T HAVE THE CORRECT CORPORATE KIND OF ETHICS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SAY ANYTHING IF YOU WORK UNDER THEM BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT THE CONSEQUENCE IS  (fe_03_02008-B-0036)
YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PICK YOU OVER THEM  (fe_03_02008-B-0037)
YOU KNOW LIKE A LITTLE PERSON OVER A BIG GUY IS JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN  (fe_03_02008-B-0038)
EXACTLY I MEAN THAT'S THE WHOLE THING  (fe_03_02008-B-0039)
YEAH BUT A LOT OF BIG GUYS THOUGH WERE REALLY LOSING THEIR JOBS TOO BECAUSE THEY REALLY ARE DOWNSIZING AND I GUESS THEY REALIZE LIKE THEY HAVE TO TRIM THE FAT UP AT THE TOP TOO  (fe_03_02008-B-0040)
WELL YEAH I MEAN YOU KNOW THEY SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON  (fe_03_02008-B-0041)
YOU KNOW AND I DON'T THINK THAT THEY SET A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ALSO PART OF IT LIKE AS A COUNTRY WE DON'T HAVE THE GREATEST OF ROLE MODELS  (fe_03_02008-B-0043)
YOU KNOW I MEAN IN OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE THE GOVERNMENT IS A LITTLE BIT BETTER AT HOW THEY SPEND THEIR MONEY I MEAN THEY SPEND IT ON HEALTH CARE OR THEY SPEND IT ON THINGS THAT ARE JUST THAT MAKE MORE SENSE THAN WHAT WE DO HERE  (fe_03_02008-B-0044)
I LOVE AMERICA DON'T GET ME WRONG BUT I'M JUST SAYING THAT THERE ARE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT WORK BETTER  (fe_03_02008-B-0045)
YEAH WELL THAT'S YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK THAT WE DON'T REALLY DO THAT HERE AND I THINK THAT IF YOU HAVE A GOVERNMENT LIKE WHO'S THE BIG PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSEDLY YOU KNOW THE ONES THAT  (fe_03_02008-B-0047)
BECAUSE I MEAN WHERE ARE CORPORATIONS GOING TO LOOK TO THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK TO JUST LIKE YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE A LOWER LEVEL EMPLOYEE YOU'RE GOING LOOK UP TO THE BOSS TO LEARN HOW THE COMPANY WORKS I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF COMPANIES LOOK AT THE GOVERNMENT  (fe_03_02008-B-0048)
AND YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY WORK AND THEY DON'T THEY'RE NOT EFFECTIVE YOU  (fe_03_02008-B-0049)
KNOW SO IT MAKES COMPANIES NOT EFFECTIVE  (fe_03_02008-B-0050)
YEAH D- I WOULD TOO I ACTUALLY THOUGH I WORK FOR THE BOARD OF ED IN NEW YORK CITY WHICH IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST MONEY WASTERS IN MY OPINION  (fe_03_02008-B-0051)
YOU KNOW THEY WASTE A LOT OF MONEY ON OFFICE SPACE BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T DO ANYTHING BUT TELL YOU THAT THEY DIDN'T HELP YOU  (fe_03_02008-B-0052)
I AM  (fe_03_02008-B-0053)
YOU KNOW SO THERE'S ALL THIS CRAZY RED TAPE TO GET THROUGH  (fe_03_02008-B-0054)
YOU KNOW LIKE IN ORDER TO CHANGE MY HEALTH INSURANCE I YOU KNOW YOU GET TO CHANGE IT IN OCTOBER IT TOOK THEM FROM OCTOBER TO JANUARY TO PROCESS THE PAPERWORK  (fe_03_02008-B-0055)
BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST NOT EFFICIENT  (fe_03_02008-B-0056)
AND I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF COMPANIES AREN'T EFFICIENT AND THAT'S PART OF THE LIKE I FEEL LIKE ENRON TO SOME DEGREE WASN'T EFFICIENT  (fe_03_02008-B-0057)
YEAH I MEAN IT'S PRETTY CLEAR BUT IT'S SIMILAR LIKE MY STEPFATHER WORKS FOR A FUNERAL HOME COMPANY A VERY LARGE ONE AND THEY DID A VERY SIMILAR THING THEY WERE ACTUALLY UM  (fe_03_02008-B-0058)
THERE WAS A FEDERAL CASE PENDING AGAINST THEM BASICALLY CHARGING THEM WITH BEING A MONOPOLY AND ALL THE BIG GUYS SOLD ALL THEIR STOCK  (fe_03_02008-B-0059)
BEF- RIGHT BEFORE THE VERDICT CAME IN BUT THEY DIDN'T TELL THE EMPLOYEES TO DO IT SO PEOPLE LIKE MY STEPFATHER WHO HAD ALL OF FOR SOME REASON HE INVESTED ALL OF HIS MONEY IN THAT ENDED UP WITH NOTHING I MEAN THE SHARES WENT FROM LIKE FORTY DOLLARS A SHARE TO LIKE SIXTY CENTS  (fe_03_02008-B-0060)
YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE ALL YOUR BUT I THINK THAT'S ALSO PART OF LIKE WHAT I'M SAYING WITH ENRON THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE I ALMOST FEEL LIKE THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN EVEN BEFORE THEN THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR MONEY IN DIFFERENT PLACES  (fe_03_02008-B-0062)
PUTTING ALL YEAR EGGS IN ONE BASKET YOU'RE JUST GOING TO  (fe_03_02008-B-0063)
HAVE A BASKET FULL OF BROKEN EGGS  (fe_03_02008-B-0064)
YEAH NO THEY'RE BIG  (fe_03_02008-B-0065)
