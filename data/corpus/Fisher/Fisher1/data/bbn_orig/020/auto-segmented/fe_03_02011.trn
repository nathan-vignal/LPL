GETTING BACK TO WHERE I KIND OF THINK THAT  (fe_03_02011-A-0025)
A VERY RECENT EXAMPLE OF JUST WHERE THESE GUYS ARE LIKE OUT OF TOUCH IS LIKE WHAT HAPPENED WITH AMERICAN AIRLINES  (fe_03_02011-A-0026)
THIS THEY NEGOTIATED WITH THE UNIONS  (fe_03_02011-A-0028)
THE THREE DIFFERENT UNIONS TO ALL TO TAKE PAY CUTS  (fe_03_02011-A-0029)

BUT AMERICAN AIRLINES IS SO BIG THEY HAVE TO LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHY LIKE I KNOW AIRLINES THERE THE EMPLOYEES TAKE A ACTIVE ROLE IN THE COMPANY  (fe_03_02011-B-0026)
