THE MEDICAL FIELD  (fe_03_02006-B-0006)
WELL THE  (fe_03_02006-B-0008)
LAWS OF DISCLOSURE  (fe_03_02006-B-0010)
HAVE BEEN CHANGED IN THE LAST YEAR SO  (fe_03_02006-B-0011)
SINCE BUSH BECAME PRESIDENT  (fe_03_02006-B-0012)
WHEN THE SCANDALS BROKE WITH ENRON AND C._B._C. C._W._C.  (fe_03_02006-B-0013)
OR C._W. C._D._W. WHATEVER IT WAS  (fe_03_02006-B-0014)
C._B._W.  (fe_03_02006-B-0015)
CBW THE BELL TEL THE TELEPHONE COMPANY  (fe_03_02006-B-0016)

UM  (fe_03_02006-B-0021)
I WAS READING IN UH  (fe_03_02006-B-0022)
THE FINANCIAL TIMES THE OTHER DAY  (fe_03_02006-B-0023)
IS THINKING OF TAKING THE ENGLISH LAWS  (fe_03_02006-B-0025)
ON  (fe_03_02006-B-0026)
ACCOUNTING PROCEDURE  (fe_03_02006-B-0027)
I USED TO BE AN ACCOUNTANT  (fe_03_02006-B-0029)
AND UH  (fe_03_02006-B-0030)
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE  (fe_03_02006-B-0031)
THING TO DO THE LAWS BUT WHERE THE THE REAL TROUBLE COMES IN IS THESE ACCOUNTING FIRMS THAT DO CONSULTING BUSINESS ON THE SIDE WITH THEIR AUDITING PROCEDURES  (fe_03_02006-B-0032)
AND THAT CAN THAT CANNOT AFFECT THE AUDITING WHEN THEY ARE CONSULTING  (fe_03_02006-B-0033)
A COMPANY AS TO WHAT TO DO AND THEN THEY COME OVER WITH AN AUDIT THAT SHOWS THEIR CONSULTING IDEAS WERE WRONG SO THEN SO SO  (fe_03_02006-B-0034)
IT JUST MAKES SENSE THAT THEY MAY JIGGLE THE BOOKS A LITTLE BIT TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THEY WERE RIGHT  (fe_03_02006-B-0035)
RIGHT ONLY WHEN THEY'RE CAUGHT THEY'VE TRIED TO SEPARATE THE TWO BETWEEN ACCOUNTING FIRMS AND CONSULTING FIRMS SO THAT THEY'RE NOT THE SAME BUSINESS  (fe_03_02006-B-0036)
LIKE ARTHUR ANDERSEN AND COMPANIES LIKE THAT THAT HAVE  (fe_03_02006-B-0037)
THEY  (fe_03_02006-B-0039)
NO THEY THEY WON'T DO IT  (fe_03_02006-B-0040)
THEY GOT A POWERFUL MAN IN THE I  (fe_03_02006-B-0041)
DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S AT BUT IT'S IN THE SOMEWHERE IN THE ACCOUNTING REVIEW  (fe_03_02006-B-0042)
BOARD THAT UH WON'T ALLOW IT  (fe_03_02006-B-0043)
SO THERE'S BEEN NO CHANGE IN THE LAW REALLY ACCOUNTING FIRMS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT ON THEIR OWN  (fe_03_02006-B-0044)
THE GOVERNMENT'S WEAK  (fe_03_02006-B-0045)
IF YOU TELL A COMPANY WELL IF YOU INVEST A  (fe_03_02006-B-0046)
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THIS YOU COME UP WITH A BETTER PROFIT OR IF IF YOU CHANGE OVER TO MACHINERY INSTEAD OF HAND THAT IT  (fe_03_02006-B-0047)
IT WILL TURN OVER A BETTER PROFIT AND IF IT DOESN'T THEN YOU LOOK BAD THEY MAKE MORE MONEY ON THEIR CONSULTING FEES THAN THEY MAKE ON ACCOUNTING  (fe_03_02006-B-0048)
NO STOCKHOLDERS  (fe_03_02006-B-0049)
AND THE STOCK WIRE GOES DOWN AND LIKE ENRON THESE DIFFERENT COMPANIES THAT HAVE  (fe_03_02006-B-0050)
I DON'T THINK THEY DO ANYTHING TO THEM COMPARED TO A REGULAR THIEF  (fe_03_02006-B-0051)
IF YOU ROBBED A BANK AND WHAT THEY ROBBED THEM OF  (fe_03_02006-B-0052)
WHY  (fe_03_02006-B-0053)

OH THEY HAD A CLUE ALL RIGHT THAT'S WHY THEY'RE INVEST- THAT'S WHY THEY'RE  (fe_03_02006-B-0067)
