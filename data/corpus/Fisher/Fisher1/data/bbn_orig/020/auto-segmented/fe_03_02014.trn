IN  (fe_03_02014-A-0041)
IN FOR IT REALLY REALIZING HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE AFFECTED NOT JUST THEM  (fe_03_02014-A-0042)

YEAH I REMEMBER SEEING SOME BUY ON ONE OF THE NEWS SHOWS TWENTY TWENTY OR SOMETHING AND HE HAD RETIRED THINKING HE HAD  (fe_03_02014-A-0048)
OH I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT SURE WHETHER IT WAS A MILLION DOLLARS BUT ANYWAY A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY HE HAD BOUGHT THIS HUGE HORSE FARM AND ALL THESE HORSES AND I THINK HIS PAYMENTS WERE LIKE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH AND THEN  (fe_03_02014-A-0049)
BY THE TIME ENRON  (fe_03_02014-A-0050)
WELL ALL THAT CAME OUT I THINK HIS STOCK WAS WORTH MAYBE A THOUSAND DOLLARS AND HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO SELL EVERYTHING 'CAUSE HE COULDN'T EVEN MAKE THE MONTHLY PAYMENTS  (fe_03_02014-A-0051)
AND HE'D WORKED FOR THEM FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS  (fe_03_02014-A-0052)
I GUESS THE THING THAT AGGRAVATES ME SO ABOUT ENRON IS THAT UM EVEN AFTER ALL THAT THEN HEAR THE GUY THAT THEY WERE TAKING TO COURT'S FLYING IN IN A COMPANY JET  (fe_03_02014-A-0053)
SO HERE THE POOR LOWLY EMPLOYEES HAVE NOTHING BUT THE ONES STILL HIGHER UP THAT MADE ALL THE MONEY IN THE FIRST PLACE STILL HAVE SOME OF THE  (fe_03_02014-A-0054)
PERKS OF THE BUSINESS SO  (fe_03_02014-A-0055)
BUT I'D SAY THAT'S BUT THAT'S ENCOURAGE THAT YOUR MOM SAID THAT HER COMPANY'S TALKED TO EVERYBODY SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU KNOW SOME OF THE COMPANIES MAY DO  (fe_03_02014-A-0056)

THE GOVERNMENT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE PEOPLE TRUST THOSE COMPANIES AGAIN THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO THAT  (fe_03_02014-A-0074)
YEP I AGREE BUT AH  (fe_03_02014-A-0076)
IT DOES LOOK LIKE PEOPLE ARE GETTING BACK IN THE STOCK MARKET A LITTLE BIT THAT SEEMS TO GO UP SO HOPEFULLY MAYBE JUST UM  (fe_03_02014-A-0077)
WITH COMPANIES  (fe_03_02014-A-0078)

SOMETHING SAYING THAT IF YOU HAD CAUGHT WERE CAUGHT  (fe_03_02014-A-0081)
OVERESTIMATING YOUR VALUE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THERE WAS A HUGE PENALTY SO AND THEY GAVE THE COMPANIES YOU KNOW LIKE SIXTY DAYS IF YOU WANTED TO  (fe_03_02014-A-0082)
MAYBE CHANGE YOUR INFORMATION  (fe_03_02014-A-0083)

WHAT IS THAT SAYING THE BIGGER THEY ARE THE HARDER THE FALL BUT  (fe_03_02014-A-0091)
OH I DO I DO SYMPATHIZE WITH THOSE EMPLOYEES THAT  (fe_03_02014-A-0092)
WHO HAD NO CHOICE AND OF COURSE ONE THING THE GOVERNMENT HAS DONE NOW THEY'VE UM I THINK THAT LAW HAS BEEN PASSED THAT NOW YOU CAN ONLY HAVE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF YOUR MONEY IN THE STOCK IN THE COMPANY THAT YOU WORK FOR  (fe_03_02014-A-0093)
SO THAT'S ONE THING THEY CHANGED UM  (fe_03_02014-A-0094)
BECAUSE LIKE WITH ENRON EVERYBODY HAD THEIR MONEY IN ENRON  (fe_03_02014-A-0095)

GENERALLY MOST PEOPLE ARE PRETTY TRUSTWORTHY SO THEY'LL  (fe_03_02014-A-0101)
MAY STAY OUT FOR A LITTLE WHILE BUT THEN THEY'LL THINK THINGS ARE OKAY AND THEY'LL GET BACK IN AND GO FOR IT AGAIN AND AH  (fe_03_02014-A-0102)
