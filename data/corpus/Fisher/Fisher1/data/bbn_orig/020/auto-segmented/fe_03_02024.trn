TECHNICALLY THE GOVERNMENT CAN REALLY ONLY INSPECT REALLY REALLY CAREFULLY PUBLIC COMPANIES IF THEY ARE ON THE STOCK MARKET YOU HAVE TO FILE YOUR TAX RETURNS S._E._C. STATEMENTS ALL THAT STUFF IS ONLY FOR PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES  (fe_03_02024-B-0058)

WELL IN OTHER WORDS THEY ARE NOT A PUBLIC COMPANY THEY DON'T HAVE STOCK TRADED ON THE STOCK MARKET OKAY SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT BE ABLE TO REGULATE THEM BECAUSE AS IT IS RIGHT NOW THEY REALLY CAN ONLY REGULATE THE PUBLIC COMPANIES  (fe_03_02024-B-0063)
I AGREE WITH THAT AND SO WE'RE GETTING RECORDED ON THIS YEAH YOU KNOW NOW THAT NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT I DON'T THINK THAT GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS SHOULD GO JUST FOR PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES  (fe_03_02024-B-0064)
I THINK  (fe_03_02024-B-0065)
IF SOMEBODY STARTS A BUSINESS LIKE FORD FORD OR PEPSI OR COC- WHOEVER AT THERE WAS A POINT WHERE THESE COMPANIES WERE REALLY BIG AND THEY WERE NOT PUBLIC I MEAN THEY GO PUBLIC TO MAKE MORE MONEY  (fe_03_02024-B-0066)

FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OR THEY EXCEED FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES OR WHAT THE CRITERIA IS MAYBE A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES THE [MN] THEY SHOULD THEN BE ABLE TO BE REGULATED UM  (fe_03_02024-B-0068)
IN TERMS OF OF THEIR TAXES JUST THE WAY A PUBLIC COMPANY IS AND I THINK THAT THAT COULD DEFINITELY CURB THE PROBLEMS WE'VE HAD 'CAUSE IT'S NOT JUST ENRON  (fe_03_02024-B-0069)
I MEAN IT'S NOT LOOK AT THE SCANDALS WELL [MN] YOU MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT IT BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T KEEPING UP WITH IT BUT QUEST COMMUNICATIONS  (fe_03_02024-B-0070)
