BUT THERE ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRACTICES  (fe_03_02007-B-0020)
EVERY C._P._A. WHEN YOU SIT IN ACCOUNTING CLASS THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE PREACHED THIS IS WHAT THEY PREACH TO YOU  (fe_03_02007-B-0021)
THERE'S A WAY TO KEEP THE BOOKS PERIOD  (fe_03_02007-B-0022)
THERE'S ONE WAY THAT IS ACCEPTABLE EVERYTHING ELSE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FINE SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET TO CORPORATE AMERICA THERE'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT SET OF BOOKS A  (fe_03_02007-B-0023)
WHOLE DIFFERENT SET OF RULES  (fe_03_02007-B-0024)
RIGHT  (fe_03_02007-B-0025)
YEAH IT SOUNDED LIKE THEY WERE COUNTING  (fe_03_02007-B-0026)
THE EXPENSES  (fe_03_02007-B-0027)

THAT'S ABSOLUTELY AGAINST ACCOUNTING PRACTICES  (fe_03_02007-B-0031)
WELL A LITTLE  (fe_03_02007-B-0032)
A LITTLE AND WHAT THEY WERE SAYING JUST DID NOT  (fe_03_02007-B-0033)
MAKE SENSE TO ME WHY THEY WOULD EVEN DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN BURY IT FOR A WHILE  (fe_03_02007-B-0034)

I CAN UNDERSTAND WANTING TO MAKE YOUR STOCK HOLDERS HAPPY  (fe_03_02007-B-0043)
BUT INFLATING THE NUMBERS FOR ANY REASON  (fe_03_02007-B-0044)
IS IS JUST SIMPLY N- NOT ETHICAL  (fe_03_02007-B-0045)
YES YES  (fe_03_02007-B-0047)
I CAN UNDERSTAND TAX BREAKS TH- THEY NEED THEM  (fe_03_02007-B-0048)
I CAN UNDERSTAND FINDING LOOPHOLES BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO STAY ON THE SIDE OF  (fe_03_02007-B-0049)
ETHICS Y- YOU HAVE TO DO IT THE RIGHT WAY YOU CAN'T JUST  (fe_03_02007-B-0050)
WELL WE WANT TO SHOW THIS SO WE'VE GOTTA YOU KNOW THEY THEY'RE STARTING WITH THE NUMBER THEY WANT TO SHOW AND THEY'RE GETTING CREATIVE ON HOW TO GET TO THAT NUMBER  (fe_03_02007-B-0051)
AND IT'S WRONG  (fe_03_02007-B-0052)
AND THE WAY IT HAS HURT PEOPLE  (fe_03_02007-B-0053)
I MEAN YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT INVOLVED WHO LOST THEIR JOBS WHO AND WE ALREADY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH JOBS IN AMERICA  (fe_03_02007-B-0054)
SO WHY DO WE NEED CORPORATE AMERICA MAKING IT WORSE  (fe_03_02007-B-0055)
AND NOW WHAT THE PRESIDENT CAN DO TO STOP THAT I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_02007-B-0056)
RIGHT  (fe_03_02007-B-0057)

WHEN THAT'S THAT'S WELL AND GOOD I MI- UNDERSTAND THE LETTER WRITING CAMPAIGNS AND THE PHONE CAMPAIGNS TO YOUR CONGRESSMAN AND YOUR SENATOR AND ALL THAT BUT WHEN THEY'RE STANDING ON THE FLOOR ARE THEY REALLY VOTING OUR CONSCIENCE  (fe_03_02007-B-0059)
THEY'LL SAY I'M GOING TO VOTE THE CONSENSUS OF MY PEOPLE BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS  (fe_03_02007-B-0060)
YES YOU DO  (fe_03_02007-B-0061)
AND THE AVERAGE AMERICAN IS NOT GOING TO DO THAT  (fe_03_02007-B-0062)

AND IT IT'S NOT JUST CORPORATE AMERICA IT'S EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIFESTYLE  (fe_03_02007-B-0071)
NOBODY WANTS TO STOP AND LOOK AT THE PROBLEM ANY MORE  (fe_03_02007-B-0072)
I I GUESS THEY KIND OF FIGURE IF WE KEEP RUNNING WE CAN OUTRUN IT  (fe_03_02007-B-0073)

YOU KNOW AND  (fe_03_02007-B-0075)
THE ONLY EXPERIENCE I'VE HAD WITH  (fe_03_02007-B-0076)
