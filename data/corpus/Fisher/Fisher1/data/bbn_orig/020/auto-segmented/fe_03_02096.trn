BEST FRIEND'S HOUSE RIGHT NOW AND UM I'VE KNOWN HER SINCE GOSH SINCE WE WERE LIKE FIVE YEARS OLD  (fe_03_02096-A-0008)
THE THING IS WE ARE SO DIFFERENT TO A POINT WHERE UM  (fe_03_02096-A-0009)
WE SHOULDN'T EVEN BE FRIENDS  (fe_03_02096-A-0010)
YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF  (fe_03_02096-A-0012)
I YOU KNOW I HAVE A LOT OF ACQUAINTANCES BUT I DON'T CONSIDER MANY PEOPLE MY FRIEND EXACTLY UM BECAUSE I THINK WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS IT'S SPREADING YOURSELF TOO THIN BASICALLY BECAUSE A FRIENDSHIP IS A REALLY IMPORTANT THING  (fe_03_02096-A-0013)
TO ME IT IS SO UM I THINK I KEEP THIS FRIEND MY BEST FRIEND MAINLY BECAUSE I LOVE HER SHE'S MORE LIKE FAMILY THAN ANYTHING ELSE BUT WITH NEWER PEOPLE THAT I HAVE IT'S IT'S MORE I OUGHT TO CALL THEM ACQUAINTANCES RATHER THAN FRIENDS FROM THE START  (fe_03_02096-A-0014)
SO YOU KNOW I HAVE A SMALL INTIMATE GROUP OF FRIENDS THAT ARE REALLY FRIENDS AND EVERYONE ELSE THEY'RE JUST ACQUAINTANCES  (fe_03_02096-A-0015)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02096-A-0016)
YES IF I WOULD HAVE MET HER UM LET'S SAY IF I MET HER A WEEK AGO WE WOULDN'T BE FRIENDS AT ALL  (fe_03_02096-A-0017)
WE ARE  (fe_03_02096-A-0018)
MHM THEY'RE HARD TO BREAK ALSO SO  (fe_03_02096-A-0019)
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS ONE POINT THAT I WAS GOING TO MAKE 'CAUSE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I'M NOT VERY OLD NOW [LAUGHTER] BUT WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL OR JUNIOR HIGH YOU KNOW EVERYBODY'S YOUR FRIEND YOU MET SOME SOMEBODY ONCE YOU'RE LIKE OH I KNOW THIS MY FRIEND OVER HERE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_02096-A-0020)
AND THEY MIGHT NOT EVEN REMEMBER YOU BUT WHEN YOU'RE YOUNGER YOU THINK THAT EVERYBODY'S YOUR FRIEND  (fe_03_02096-A-0021)
MHM  (fe_03_02096-A-0022)

AND THE FRIEND THAT I'M SHE'S SEVEN YEARS OLD I HAVE I KNOW THIS SOUNDS REALLY STRANGE 'CAUSE EVERYBODY SAYS THIS ABOUT THEIR KIDS EITHER YOUR KID'S A PERFECT ANGEL OR THEY'RE A DEVIL MINE IS AN ANGEL ALL THE WAY THROUGH [LAUGHTER] BUT ONE OF THINGS THAT MY FRIEND AND I THE ONE THAT I'M GOING TO RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_02096-A-0030)
IS SHE HAS TWO LITTLE KIDS AND ONE WAY BORN FOURTEEN DAYS BEFORE MY DAUGHTER  (fe_03_02096-A-0031)
AND THE OTHER ONE IS THREE SO THAT'S REALLY ANOTHER REASON WHY I GO OVER THERE SO MY DAUGHTER HAS SOMEONE TO GROW UP WITH  (fe_03_02096-A-0032)

IT'S FR- YOU KNOW WHAT LITTLE KIDS ARE GREAT BECAUSE HOW WE TREAT THEM TO TIE IT BACK IN TO LIKE THE WHOLE GROUP OF FRIENDSHIP IS HOW THEY'RE GOING TO TREAT THEIR FRIENDS WHEN THEY'RE OLDER  (fe_03_02096-A-0038)
