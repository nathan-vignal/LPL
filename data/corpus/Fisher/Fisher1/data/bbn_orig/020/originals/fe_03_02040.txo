L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Ah, my name's Judy.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  My name is Colleen, and I live in Minnesota.
L:  In Minnesota?
R:  Yep.
L:  I'm in Pittsburgh -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- Pennsylvania.
R:  You are.  Okay.  Well, sounds like we have a little easier subject.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Our activities -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- outdoor and in. [MN] 
L:  Ahah.
R:  Um, what do you like to do outside, I will ask first of all.
L:  Well, I'm participating in one of those things right now.  It's camping.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  We camp quite a bit.
R:  Do you?
L:  I spend part of the time outside and part of the time inside, because we have a big motorhome.
R:  Oh, how wonderful.
L:  So we combine the two.
R:  Okay, that sou- --
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  Well, I'll tell you, I'm a senior citizen so don't do a lot outside.  I -- I do a lot of walking, for one thing, [MN] and in the spring and in the summer now I -- I love to garden.  I have a lot of flowers that I take care of, so -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that keeps me outside.  Winter -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- time, I don't do too much.  [LAUGH] If there isn't a lot of snow on the driveway, I will shovel that, but --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that's about --
L:  Good for you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't shovel the snow at all.  My husband --
R:  Oh, --  
L:  -- loves to snow blow.
R:  Okay.
L:  But -- but not to shovel.  [LAUGH]
R:  All right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, we use the snow blower if there's, you know, a little --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- more snow, but up to about three inches I don't mind.  My husband has a heart condition, so I kinda do that. [MN] 
L:  Good for you.
R:  But [NOISE] no skiing or ice skating or anything like that here, so ...
L:  No, I don't -- we don't do that either, no winter outdoor activities.   
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, how 'bout inside?  What do you -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- like to do inside?
R:  Ah, inside, well, I like to be on my computer [MN] and I do a lot of knitting.  I make some, ah, like, lap robes for nursing homes.
L:  Oh.
R:  Like to do that, and I do a little crocheting, nothing much fancy, though. [NOISE]
L:  That's nice.
R:  Yeah, so that -- that keeps me pretty busy.
L:  I like to sew and --  
R:  Good.  
L:  -- I have a friend who does quilting, and she is te- -- teaching me to make a circle quilt.
R:  Oh, -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- okay.
L:  By that I mean, ah, it's m- -- comprised of circles instead of squares --
R:  I see. 
L:  -- and it's a special way that you put them together so that the quilting is done, you work on one circle at a time, and then by sewing them together they form squares --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  -- and -- look, I know, it sounds --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- really complicated, but I've seen her do it a number of times --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and I'm going to do it.  I'm shopping for my fabric now.
R:  Well, good for you.  It's -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's always amazing to me when I look at quilts how do you pick the fabrics --
L:  That to me --
R:  -- that go together?
L:  -- is the hardest part.
R:  I would think so -- 
L:  It --
R:  -- too.
L:  -- really is, yeah, and I just kinda look at them and I need friends to help me.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I'm not good at picking them out.  I did one other quilt and I did it in a class, and it was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a sampler and the --
R:  [MN] Okay.
L:  -- teacher did help with picking the fabric.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, 'cause you have to kinda -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- have something that goes together, don't you?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, they're so beautiful.  I have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, gone to the state fair here, and some of these quilts are just -- they are beautiful. [MN]
L:  I never in my wildest dreams thought I would be -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- doing a quilt. [LAUGH]  
R:  Well, good for you.  Good for you.  [MN] 
L:  But it's fun.
R:  Sure.
L:  And we like to -- my husband and I both enjoy computing as well.
R:  Do you?  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's good.  You play games, or what do you do?
L:  Um, well, in our motorhome we have -- one, two, three -- I can't remember if we have three or four computers in here.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  He -- he uses one for GPS --
R:  All right.
L:  Go- -- going down the road if -- 
R:  Oh, -- 
L:  -- he programs in our trip --
R:  [MN] Oh -- 
L:  It -- 
R:  -- okay.
L:  -- it will speak to him and it'll tell him where to turn next --  
R:  Sh- -- sure.  Oh, great.
L:  -- and how far away we are.  In fact, we are leaving from -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- where we are at now tomorrow morning for Myrtle Beach --  
R:  Oh, wonderful.  I have --  
L:  -- and --
R:  -- a son that's been there golfing, so ...
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Good for him.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  My husband does -- does a little golfing usually.  He has some neighbourhood men that they go once a week, but I've never --
L:  How nice.
R:  -- I have never gotten into that --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- so ...
L:  I -- I don't do golfing either, but, ah, --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- he has his laptop for the GPS, he has another laptop for his regular stuff, I have --
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  -- my laptop and I have a little pocket computer that I carry --
R:  Oh, -- 
L:  -- so -- 
R:  -- okay.  
L:  -- we are wired for sound.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes, you are.  Well, that's great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I just started that about two years ago, so ...  
L:  Good for you.
R:  But, ah, --
L:  Are you on the Internet?
R:  Yes, yes.  I find it very interesting and, ah, [MN] it's just, um, very nice to keep in contact with people.
L:  It really is. 
R:  [MN] Mhm.  You -- you know, it's much easier than sitting down and writing a letter [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Oh, --
R:  -- I find.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so much easier.
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And you can keep up on things much -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- better.  So have you had, ah, more phone calls on this little hobby here?
L:  No, I've not.  This is my first.
R:  This is your first --  
L:  Yes. 
R:  -- okay.  Last week I had, ah, one other one.  Talked to a young man from Dallas about, ah, athletes on strike, so that was not -- not as easy. [LAUGH]
L:  Athletes on?
R:  When they go on strike, what we --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- think about it.  So --
L:  Oh, oh.
R:  I know, that's, ah, --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Thinking about --
L:  Interesting.
R:  Yeah, I know.  But [inaudible] --
L:  That brings to mind another thing we enjoy.  We don't participate in, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we do as spectators.  We like to go to the races -- the NASCAR --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- races.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have a neighbour that's very interested in that too.
L:  Really?
R:  Mhm.  [MN] Oh, yes.
L:  Yeah.  In fact --
R:  He wouldn't miss. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I can understand that.  We don't get to too many of them, but when we go we take our motorhome -- 
R:  Okay.  Well, that's --
L:  -- and --  
R:  -- that's great.
L:  Oh, it's a lot of fun.
R:  Oh, I bet it is too.
L:  And I don't li- -- I don't like a seat in the stands.  I like to be on the roof of our motorhome.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, you have a bird's eye view then, huh?
L:  Yeah, yeah --  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- yeah.  It's definitely fun.
R:  Sure.  Oh, I know if he isn't going to be home he tapes, you know, a lot of the races.  He just --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- doesn't like to miss them, and I -- I'm sure it's because you get to know the people that race.
L:  Yes.
R:  [MN] So -- 
L:  That's exactly it.
R:  Right.
L:  But, ah, as a child I used to like to ice skate outside a lot.
R:  Okay, we did -- 
L:  But -- 
R:  -- too. 
L:  Did you?
R:  We did too.  Yes, we did.  In fact, we used to ice skate on a -- a lake in my hometown.  I'm from, ah, Sleepy Eye, Minnesota originally.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  So used to do that too, and our -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- kids enjoyed it when they were young.
L:  [MN] I never skated on a lake.  [MN] That always concerned me -- 
R:  Did it?  [LAUGH]
L:  -- whether it was really [several inaudible words] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- yeah, you had to be sure that it w- -- that it was froze --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- [several inaudible words], but being it -- it was such a tiny town they didn't have rinks then, of course --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so that's -- 
L:  Oh. 
R:  -- why we had to do that, but we enjoyed -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- it.
L:  Oh, I'm sure you did.  The grade school that I grew up had a building that was taken down and the foundation was still there --  
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and the priest who headed the school had the fire department flood that foundation --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and freeze it and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- he had the eight grades of kids out there skating for lunch hours and after school and [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, wasn't that great?
L:  -- so -- that was.  That was a lot of fun.
R:  Yeah.  We had a neighbour that did, ah, a rink in his backyard, and when we were younger we would go out and play broom ball there.
L:  [MN] Play what?
R:  I don't know -- broom ball.  I don't know if you are familiar with --
L:  No.
R:  -- that.
L:  No.  What's that? 
R:  Well, it's kind of like h- hockey but you don't have skates on.  You just have your -- like, your -- 
L:  Wow. 
R:  -- overshoes on.
L:  Oh, my! 
R:  Yeah.  It was -- it was fun, and of course his two boys did a lot of skating and ended up playing hockey in high school and college, so ...  
L:  Good for them.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  They were -- started out with a chair, I can remember, about three years old, pushing it along on the ice. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.  
R:  So they learned -- learned to skate very young.
L:  Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.  That can help in -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- a lot of different --
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- ways.
R:  Sure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, and they were home, you know, -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so ...  That was neat.  
L:  [MN] 
R:  We do watch, ah, baseball.  [MN] 
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  Mm huh -- in the summer time, and, ah, we have the Twins -- Twins game here, and also our grandchildren play baseball, so we --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- go to watch them.
L:  Well, do you ever watch the Twins play against the Pittsburgh Pirates? 
R:  Oh, you bet.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you?
R:  Yes -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- we do.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We sure do.  Our team has not done very well this spring.  I [NOISE] think they finally won yesterday.  Lo- -- they've been losing, like six games in a row.
L:  Oh, gosh.  I haven't kept up with it -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- very well.  Ah, I think I may follow football just a little more than baseball.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, it's a little --
L:  But --
R:  -- faster.  I get --  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- distracted because -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- baseball is very slow.
L:  They built a new stadium in Pittsburgh --
R:  Oh, -- 
L:  -- ah, for -- 
R:  -- okay.
L:  -- for baseball and for football, and they are beautiful stadiums.
R:  Oh, I bet, yeah, -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they are -- they are crying for that here too.
L:  Are they really?
R:  Ye -- oh, yes.  [LAUGH] We are crying out -- 
L:  Well, you know, -- 
R:  -- cry --
