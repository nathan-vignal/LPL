R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  How you doing?
L:  This is Reg.
R:  I'm Maria.
L:  Maria?
R:  Aha.  What's your name?
L:  How are you, Maria?
R:  I'm doing okay.  I could hardly understand what the topic was.  [MN] 
L:  It's about corporate scandal and how it's affected the economy and the stock market and what the government could do to correct it. 
R:  Mm.
L:  Do you know anything about it?
R:  I don't know a lot about it, but, uh, I mean -- 
L:  What do you think of big business and hiding figures and numbers and telling people one thing when it's something else and then -- 
R:  Well --
L:  -- uh, the -- they find out about it and their stock falls and you lose money in the stock market -- 
R:  Right.  Well, I -- 
L:  -- and it becomes a domino effect.
R:  I -- I definitely, definitely think they should, uh, do a lot more background checking before they hire the, uh, higher ups, if you know what I mean.  Uh, they -- they do so much background checking and -- and make it so hard for the lower level people to get a job, but they do so much for the higher levels and, I don't know, [MN] it seems to me like money breeds money, if you know what I mean.
L:  That's right.  It does.
R:  You have to have, uh, just the right, um, know the right people to get into the right places to get the right jobs and do whatever you want. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  That's right.  It certainly has affected the economy, these scandals.
R:  Oh, most definitely.  I was reading the other day about, um, how a lot of the higher ups, um, the -- the major, um, [MN] higher level executives that have gotten fired getting an average of something like sixteen million dollars each in severance packages, even when they're fired.
L:  That's right.
R:  I know when they fire somebody like, you know, any normal person, you get nothing.  Your final pay cheque, that's it.
L:  That's right.
R:  So, I don't know.  I think they -- they should cut that out definitely.  That -- that raises whatever prices we have to pay, lowers the stocks.  It hurts the little people -- 
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- a lot more than it does the big people.
L:  Well, they already have money they can live on for the rest of our lives.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [inaudible] everybody else suffers.
R:  And ninety five per cent of them have a job within days.
L:  I don't know about that, but they get jobs again and they live on their pension, their dividends and stock and everything they got.
R:  Mhm.
L:  This Enron thing, um, was a big scandal and it hurt -- it affected a lot of things.
R:  Oh, yes, definitely.
L:  It brought the stock market down and shook Wall Street and affected the economy.
R:  Mhm.  I know, um, I was reading about that guy that was in charge of -- 
L:  Lang.
R:  -- Kmart, wasn't it?
L:  What?
R:  The guy that was in charge of Kmart.
L:  Oh, I didn't read that.
R:  I read about him.  He had been fired from, like, two or three other places.  He basically ran them into the ground and -- and -- and bankrupted them.
L:  Geez.
R:  They fired him and somebody else hired him.  He bankrupted them.
L:  Huh.
R:  Yet you know you had -- [MN] you know he had to have, you know, been -- 
L:  He was incompetent. 
R:  -- putting his fingers in the pie -- 
L:  I don't know.  Probably did.
R:  -- and he got all kinds of really, you know, sweet pensions, even though he was fired.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, uh, I don't know, it's crazy. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] If you can't count on the higher ups, what are you going to do and the little guy can't do that much -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but if the higher ups are in scandal, the little guys -- the little guys really pay if they do anything wrong -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and the higher ups seem to get off the hook.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I got fired one time.  I -- I think I was seventeen and I was working at this convenience store and, uh, they had things like, um, some cookies and stuff for sale, the kind that are shaped with, uh, icing on them and in plastic and they would, like, go through the bin and any of them that are broken throw away.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, instead of throwing them away I was like -- uh, I told the person I was working with, I was like, "I'm going to go ahead and take these home to, um, my sister and brother", they're -- they were like, you know, ten and twelve -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and I figured, you know, that was better than tossing them into the dumpster.
L:  Right.
R:  I went to work the next day, I was locked out.  They fired me.
L:  Oh, is that right?
R:  Yeah.  I was stealing because I took home something that was going into the trash -- 
L:  Huh.
R:  -- and I was like, "This is unbelievable".
L:  Right.
R:  So, it -- it -- it just, I don't know, I think they really need to rethink the way that they do things, that they let the upper echelons get away with so much stuff -- 
L:  Right. [COUGH]
R:  -- and -- and, you know, the peons get nothing, they -- they -- they get treated like -- like peons, you know, like we're -- we're no -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- [MN] you know, we have no worth -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it seems to me that -- 
L:  What field are you in now? 
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  What field are you in now? 
R:  Right now I don't work, but -- 
L:  Oh, don't you?
R:  -- uh, before I quit working I was working in computers.  I did some tech support, I built computers.
L:  Oh, is that right?
R:  Yeah, and I did tech, uh, tech support for Vario, um, their web -- their business web site.
L:  Oh.
R:  And such, so I worked a little bit with HTML, um, did a lot of hardware work -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and did, uh -- I started my computer, um, support field by working for AOL.  I knew nothing about computers -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- until I started working for them. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  They gave me just enough training to be able to, um, move on to something better.
L:  Yeah, [MN] once you get your foot in the door, move to other things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That -- that's the middle management's job, to get people in -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- in the business and prosper right from the time it was going good be- before all these corporate scandals and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- all these things are going wrong.
R:  I don't know.  I think -- 
L:  Now we're down.
R:  I think fancy resumes mean nothing.  I -- I think --
L:  Right.  It's who you know.
R:  -- that, you know, whatever's written down on the paper, it -- it -- it means nothing whatsoever.
L:  I think it's who you know.
R:  If -- if you take into consideration person -- I don't know, just give the person a chance, no matter what the resume is.
L:  Right.
R:  As long as they don't have, you know, some -- a lot of bad records, if they're not criminals or whatever or have a habit of quitting or whatever, give them a test.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, give them a trial, give them a chance.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  That's right.
R:  These upper end people that have all these impressive resumes, "Oh, I was the boss of Walmart, I was the boss of Kmart, I was the boss of", you know, whatever mart.  It means nothing if you've run the business into the ground.
L:  If you've failed on it.
R:  Right.
L:  A lot of them have a long history of failing -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and they continue to hire them and -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- pay them millions of dollars a year.
R:  Oh, definitely and what makes me laugh -- 
L:  Stock options, everything.
R:  What makes me laugh is that things like the ones that, uh, do the worst are the ones that get hired the fastest and it -- it, you know, it -- it kills the business and then, you know, as a result the stock market's dropped to nothing and those of us putting our money into it will lose that money. 
L:  Do you realize that the Nasdaq was over five thousand, uh, as little as four years ago, or three or four years ago -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and now it's down to a thousand four hundred?
