R:  Hello? 
L:  Hi, this is -- 
R:  Hi, --
L:  -- Simone.
R:  -- I'm Ruth.
L:  Hi, Ruth.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] My name is Simone.
R:  Well, let's see, outdoor activities, um, definitely warm weather activities, definitely outdoor activities versus indoor activities.
L:  Really?  What kind of, um, [LIPSMACK] outdoor -- warm outdoor -- [MN] I assume that you mean sort of spring and summer time, [MN] activity, um, and what kind of activities do you like to do? 
R:  Ride horses.
L:  Wow.
R:  We -- we go to the zoo, we [LAUGH] take walks, take bike rides.  There's not much that we don't do.
L:  Okay.  Do you have your own horses? 
R:  Um, my in laws have horses, and they're actually planning to breed their female horses this summer so that we can have a couple of baby horses.
L:  Wow.  Well, [LIPSMACK] I, um, like both indoor and outdoor activities.  Um, in terms of outdoor, I also like warm weather.  I grew up in California.  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  Lived there for thirty years, so [LIPSMACK] we definitely prefer warm activities, although now I live on the east coast.  So, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we're having to get accustomed to cold winters.  But --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I've noticed that, um, [LIPSMACK] since I -- I've lived on the east coast for three years that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I definitely spend a lot of time indoors during the winter.  [LIPSMACK] Um, I do -- I -- we -- we do walk outside a little bit, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the snow when it's nice and fresh, with really warm clothes on.  But --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's not -- it doesn't seem to be quite as pleasant.  I -- I notice that I spend a lot more time cooking inside during the -- the winter, which is one of the outdoor activities that I like to do, a lot of --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- cooking or arts and craft.
R:  Oh, fun.
L:  [NOISE] Do you have indoor activities that you like to do? 
R:  Well, we -- indoors we like to -- we like to do a lot of -- watch a lot of movies, read, lots of arts and crafts with the kids.  [NOISE]
L:  Okay, yeah, that's --
R:  That's --
L:  -- what we do too.  Um, actually in the -- in the -- all winter our kids would go -- we were very clo- -- one [MN] -- just across the street basically from our public library.  So, they'd love to take a lot of videos out, but not as a major, um, [LIPSMACK] indoor activity, either that or reading.  Um, we actually don't have T.V. so, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, and we only let them do videos on the weekend.
R:  Oh, fun.
L:  But there is a lot of reading also as an indoor activity, um, --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and just in my profession I have to read a lot, so -- and I -- which is something that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I enjoy, which isn't really pleasure reading, but I do enjoy it, um, --
R:  Well, that's --
L:  -- regardless, you know, it's for work.
R:  Do you do any, like, gardening or anything like that? 
L:  I don't at all.
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Um, I -- actually my indoor plants don't even do well.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I'm not very good at that.  But, let's see, what I -- I'm trying to think -- I -- the -- the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] probably the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- biggest outdoor activity though --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] I grew up at the ocean, so I really like to go to the beach a lot, although I haven't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- been since I've lived on the east coast.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But, that's probably [NOISE] my favorite kind of outdoor activity, other than just walking.  I really like to walk.  I don't really bike ride, um, not much, although, um, in terms --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of sort of, um, a sports activity but not an outdoor [NOISE] activity that I like to do indoors is I grew up dancing.
R:  Oh, fun.
L:  So, I like to [NOISE], um, dance, more classical than just ballet.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I -- I like to do that and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and yoga as indoor activities.
R:  Oh, nice.  My daughter --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- is in dance class.  She absolutely loves it.
L:  Oh, really.  Um, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- does she do ballet or jazz or tap or modern or --
R:  She's --
L:  -- everything.
R:  -- still pre- -- they're -- she's pretty young.  They're -- they're -- they just do like a broad range of, like, dance fundamentals.
L:  Ahah. 
R:  But, she, um, -- she said she want [MN] -- we watched one of the ballet classes and -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- she said she definitely wants to take ballet.  So, -- 
L:  Oh.  [NOISE]
R:  She has to wait --
L:  But --
R:  -- a couple of years for that, though.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, I actually started when I was four [NOISE] and, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] I did it my whole life --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- something that I really, really love, and even while I was at university I danced and --
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  -- was very lucky to have a -- a really excellent teacher who had danced at the Joffrey Ballet.  So, --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- that's just -- it's something very relaxing to me, but it's not something I can do with my family.  So, I don't know, that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- counts as an indoor activity, but [LAUGH] --
R:  That's a good [inaudible].
L:  -- I guess it -- it does as an individual activity not a -- a family activity.
R:  [NOISE] That's --
L:  I'm trying to think of other -- I know I spend a lot of time outdoors.  I'm trying to think what I do.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't garden.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I do like to walk, as I said, go to the beach and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know, just sit outside, [LAUGH] I suppose.  Nothing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I guess it's not very active, but it's -- or read outside.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's something that I do like to do a lot in the -- the summer and spring, is just sit out on our patio and -- and read.
R:  [NOISE] Nice.  My kids, they're -- they're new into, like, flying [NOISE] kites and sidewalk -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- trucks.  All that --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- all that good stuff.  So, we are [LAUGH] -- I would love to just sit under a tree and read a book, but -- 
L:  Yeah, I actually -- my -- our kids really like to roller skate and roller blade.  So, --
R:  Oh, fun.  [NOISE]
L:  -- not, ah, -- I personally [LAUGH] have no desire, but, um, -- so I keep sitting --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- outside with them while they do that and -- and reading, make sure that nobody gets too injured.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's -- when I was in high school I used to -- we lived in the country, and I was just -- like, the -- I think the block that we lived on, it probably would be about a mile long and I would just roller blade up and down and back and forth --
L:  Wow.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and all afternoon.
L:  That's something that I've just never, ever tried.  I, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LAUGH] I actually did use to roller skate though, but it was indoor --
R:  Hold on.
L:  -- roller skating when I was at school.  I remember there was a period when I was growing up where every birthday party -- I didn't -- it wasn't like a regular activity of mine, but it was something that I did [NOISE] a few times [NOISE] every year and I really loved going to the roller rink.  But when roller blades came out it was just something that I never really got into.  I -- and I -- I did -- there was a time when all my friends kind of got into it, and that -- at that period I did use to bike ride a lot at the beach.  So, like, my friends would roller blade up the beach and I would, um, bike ride.  But just [NOISE] I -- I don't know why we haven't really [NOISE] gotten into bike riding since we've lived on the east coast.  But maybe it's something that we will get into.  I -- I -- I guess growing up in California you feel like you can bike ride all year --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- round, and here I kind of feel like, "Oh, we have to [NOISE] put everything away".
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  Um, all of our [NOISE] outdoor act- -- um, activities have to kind of be put into the basement --
R:  [NOISE] Yep.
L:  -- during the winters, so I kind of haven't gotten as excited about, um, the seasonal thing, having to rearrange your wardrobe [LAUGH] twice a year and rearrange all your activities twice a year.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, I kind of [inaudible] activities, um, [NOISE] that don't -- don't really require equipment, I guess.  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] I live in Indiana; I have my entire life, so it's always --
L:  Oh, really.
R:  -- it's always been pack everything up in March or April, depending on the -- [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay.  I -- actually one of the -- my three east coast years was Indiana.  I considered it east coast since we were on Michigan time where I was.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, um, -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but the other two years have been farther east.  So, [MN] -- and there I had a -- I was only there by myself.  Um, my family didn't come because it was just a one year position that I had.  So, um, I really didn't get involved in any outdoor activity.  There was so much snow there that -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- year that I was there that I really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- didn't [inaudible].  Actually one of the outdoor activities that I -- I thought about that we do like to do, tennis.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Ah, but not [LAUGH] with any -- any kind of skill.  Just sort of --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Just for fun.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  That's fun.  I like, um, [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- volleyball.  Horrible at it.
L:  Wow.
R:  My sister was like this great --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- volleyball player, but that's always fun.
L:  Do you do indoor or outdoor? 
R:  Ah, sand volleyball.
L:  What's that? 
R:  Sand.
L:  Oh, [MN] yeah, like a -- kind of like -- suppose it's not b- -- unless maybe it's like a lake that you do it?  [NOISE] 
R:  Pa- -- I can -- I can hardly hear you.
L:  [NOISE] Can you hear me now? 
R:  That's better.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Is it mostly at the lakes that you do sand [MN] -- what do you mean by --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sand volleyball, because I'm assuming that you don't have beaches? 
R:  We, um, [NOISE] -- we live in an apartment and they have -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- like two or three sand volleyball courts.
L:  Wow.
R:  They, um, --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- during the -- the summer they have a couple -- a couple of v- volleyball leagues.  That's always fun.
L:  Okay.  So, it's not --
R:  It's --
L:  -- a beach.  Do you guys do, um, lake activities ever or --
R:  Um, we live probably about an hour away from Lake Michigan.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, we get up there a couple of times during the summer, but just with dance class and all the other different --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- classes and activities it's just so hard to [NOISE] make that drive.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Mm.
R:  I'm turning --
L:  So, what kinds of arts and crafts do you guys like to do? 
R:  Oh --
