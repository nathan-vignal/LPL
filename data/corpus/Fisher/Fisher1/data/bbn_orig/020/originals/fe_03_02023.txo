L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  My name's Raphia[?].  How are you?
R:  Good.  I'm Denise.
L:  And where are -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you from?
R:  Um, New Jersey.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm from Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Not too far away.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, [MN] I hope you caught all those questions they wanted us to talk about.
R:  I have no clue.  It was like, ah, -- when I first heard her I wasn't even sure what she said.  [inaudible] --
L:  I think it --
R:  -- [inaudible] hopefully the second half of the [LAUGH] -- the caller [LAUGH] gets the --  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] -- gets the point.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, [LAUGH] -- 
L:  I know it was about corporate conduct in the US and how it's affected, I guess, us. 
R:  Us, our economy -- 
L:  Corporate -- 
R:  -- the stock market.
L:  -- scandals. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, hopefully we are covering everything.
R:  Okay. 
L:  Um, well, my opinion, it just screwed everything up.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it has.
L:  Starting with Enron.
R:  Right. 
L:  And that was kind of like it's -- it was always a bunch of little things, but that was kind of like the beginning of the end, and now everything [NOISE] seems to be tumbling drastically, which is horrible.
R:  I kn- -- well, I think the war had a lot to do with it too, but that's off topic, I guess.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  
R:  [MN] 
L:  I mean, like, that just made things worse and, you know, --  
R:  It lowered gas prices, though. 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] 
L:  That's true.  But, I mean, it -- [MN] it's -- it's just been horrible, I mean, as someone who kind of had money in the stock market kind of when everybody started digging around.
R:  Yeah.  We didn't have money in the stock market, but my husband has a 401K.
L:  Oh, my gosh. 
R:  And we've just been watching it go down and down and down, and he's like, "I've got to get out of this.  I've got to find some place.  See, this is ridiculous".  Whatever he's putting in --
L:  Is just being [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.  He put in, like, three eighteen, and he lost two ninety seven or something.
L:  Oh! 
R:  So, it's like he didn't really put anything in.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  You know, he made a lot the years before that and everything, but --
L:  And things just -- w- -- I don't -- it's -- it's -- [MN] I don't even know.  It's just horrible, and, like, so many people have lost jobs because people are cutting back, they make up the losses from their accounting lies and it's just crazy.  I know, gosh, at least, like, ten to fifteen people who've lost their jobs --
R:  Really?
L:  -- because of cutbacks because, you know, the accountants had to redo everything and realised that -- or didn't real- -- well, they had known that they weren't making as much money as they were -- thought they were.
R:  Are you having allergy problems too? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I just got to blow my nose before I got on the -- I can hear you're congested.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No, it's cold.
R:  Oh.  [MN]
L:  [MN] But yeah. 
R:  [MN] Yeah, I haven't -- I haven't found anybody that lost their jobs, but, I mean, now, like, even these pilots and stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just to keep their jobs they're agreeing to keep, ah, taking cuts and stuff in their salary and their benefits.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
R:  Just so they can keep their jobs, and, you know, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I mean, how long did they fight to get those benefits and everything.
L:  And the industry -- airline industry is already just so horrible.  
R:  [MN] 
L:  I mean, just because of nine eleven, so ...
R:  That's another topic.  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, [several inaudible words] and, yeah, I was just -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- reading, um, just probably a few hours ago about how the, um, -- the -- I guess the president or the CEO of American Airlines resigned over the l- -- that little sneaky thing he did this week.  Did you hear about that?  
R:  Yeah, yeah, I heard something like that on the news.  I was kind of listening to the news.
L:  Yeah, he snuck in a clause in the contract that him and all of his cronies would get bonuses if they pulled the company out of bankruptcy.  So it's like they are asking these people to take all these huge cuts --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- but if they don't go into bankruptcy they all get, you know, like thousands of dollars --
R:  These guys get money instead, yeah.
L:  Yeah, and they tried to sneak it in.  So, --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I mean, just because of that, you know, they might end up going bankrupt anyway, just because someone was trying to lie.
R:  [MN] Well, o- okay, I d- did see tonight on the news, and this is right in Chinatown in --
L:  Oh, really.
R:  -- Philadelphia, they pulled three million dollars out of a bank.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  It was like the Depression all --
L:  That's right.  That's -- 
R:  -- over again.  These people were standing in this long line to get their money out because there was a scandal and somebody, you know, embezzled so much money -- I forget how much they said -- out of this bank, you know. 
L:  I actually was driving by there and I was wondering why there w- were police barricades and lines.
R:  Yeah, th- th- this bank was g- -- like -- you know, like Depression all over again, run on -- run on the banks and, um, -- my mom was even saying [MN] to me, like, "Don't, you know, go into savings and loan".  I have a savings and -- and loan, not a regular bank.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You know, not like commerce or, you know, beneficial or something.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
R:  It's just a little bank, and she's like, "You know, they're -- it's -- it's still FDI insured, you know.  [MN] 
L:  Right.
R:  So ...  You know, I don't have a hundred thousand dollars in the bank --  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so I'm not worried about it.
L:  Oh, my God, I wish I had to run --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to the bank to take out, you know, a couple hundred thousand so I could just be [inaudible] a little bit.  But, I mean, that -- it -- it's just horrible.  It's just messing up so many people's lives, you know, if --
R:  And you can't trust anybody.
L:  At all.
R:  You know, it's like you don't know who's -- who's going to -- [MN] they did that and they -- all the prices on the stock market went up and all these people made all this money, but it wasn't real money.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah. 
R:  Because the stocks weren't really worth that much. 
L:  And, I mean, this the people that lost all their pension money who had -- like, a lot of people had their pension invested in Enron and a c- -- and Arthur Andersen. 
R:  Oh, I can't imagine.
L:  And so there are all these, like, kind of like, you know, blue collar, regular people who thought, "Oh, my gosh, we are making so much money because all our stock was in the right places," and now they are retiring and they are like, "We don't have any money".
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE] 
L:  I'm like, "Just sue.  Sue," but then it's whole -nother [NOISE] [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- problem on top of it, but it's -- it's just making -- I mean, so many things have happened already [MN] and just to have this on top of it is just bad news for everybody.
R:  I know.
L:  Um, --
R:  Yeah.  You can't trust anybody any more.
L:  It's true and [MN] I --  
R:  You know, Martha Stewart.  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You can't trust -- 
L:  Oh, my --
R:  -- Martha Stewart any more.
L:  -- gosh -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- yeah!  That was crazy, and actually, like, she's been laying low for a while now too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I haven't, like, heard anything from -- I don't even know if her show's on any more.
R:  I don't know.  I never watched it anyway, but --
L:  Yeah, and it -- 
R:  -- I'm not that crafty type.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  It's one of those things where you watch it just to see but you are not going to do it.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  Like, how can she know all these things?  [MN]
L:  Huh?
R:  How can she know how to do all these different things, you know? 
L:  You know -- o- off topic real quick -- one of my, um, really good friends, her sister in law is actually the woman that does all the stuff.  She works for Martha Stewart. 
R:  Ahah.
L:  And she comes up with all the stuff.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, once again, she's promoting all these ideas that are hers but they are really --
R:  Yeah, if you can't trust Martha Stewart, who can you trust [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know?   
L:  I know.  
R:  [MN] 
L:  Supposed to be all American woman, and, you know, all the insider trading, and I remember in the eighties there was a lot going on and people were going down because of the junk bonds and --  
R:  [MN]
L:  -- everything like that and [MN], you know, you would think that people would be smart and not try to screw up the system any more.
R:  Yeah.  I don't understand how they can make the value of something what it's not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, they can make the stocks be worth fifty dollars a share when they are actually only worth twenty, and, you know, -- so all of that money that was in the stock market wasn't even really there.
L:  There, yeah.  [NOISE] 
R:  It's [MN] -- it's amazing.
L:  And it -- and it -- I guess, like, it's -- it's one thing if you're a millionaire and you lose, like, a hundred thousand dollars, but if you are, like, a thousandaire [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- like most normal people --
R:  And -- and you lose, yeah.
L:  You know, for -- for -- for just a regular person like, you know, me to lose six thousand dollars is, like, okay, that equals rent and car and --
R:  Right, car payment, yeah.
L:  -- you know.  That's like no vacation for a few years, you know, a lot of missing out on everything.
R:  Yeah, it -- it's not fair to -- to us what the -- the big businessmen are doing and stuff, because -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we can't get in on it.  You know, I mean, -- 
L:  At all.
R:  -- like, we can't -- we can't afford to -- to buy the stocks that they're buying and play the games that they are playing and --
L:  But it all trickles down to everyone else.
R:  It's dangerous, you know.
L:  Which is bad.  I mean, like, um, now that K-Mart is, you know, -- been going back and forth in bankruptcy.
R:  Right.  
L:  -- for so long, it's -- like, they're shutting --
R:  And AOL.
L:  Yeah, yeah; and th- -- they're shutting -- AOL, I think they deserve to go down [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that service, but, um, you know, it's -- it's -- you see, like, the people who work in the stores when all these things have to shut down and, you know, -- like, for some people, like, a K-Mart is the only store to work at in a town.
R:  Right. 
L:  And then they are out of a job because somebody made a wrong decision higher up.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  And it's just sad.  It's just really sad.  I w- -- wish things would just get back normal.  It's one of those things where it's like, "I wish it was four years ago and I could do everything all over again".  
R:  Yeah.  I mean, we've had -- we've had a -- a great run, I mean, -- I don't know how old you are.  I'm forty two.
L:  I'm thirty.
R:  And [MN] my whole life -- or your whole life too -- I mean, you never wanted for everything.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Everything has always been there, everything you ever needed.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, -- and this st- -- stuff starts to happen and you go back to the Depression days.  My mum's eighty two -- eighty -- no, eighty three.
L:  Wow.
R:  And she grew up in the Depression, and she holds onto her money really tight.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And she knows what it's like 'cause she's been there.  Well, we don't know that.
L:  At all.
R:  So we have a tendency to just, you know, be fr- freer with our money and spend it and not worry about saving it, but you never know what's going to happen when these businesses play their games, you know. 
L:  Yeah, and -- and -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- I've -- over the past maybe six months I've drastically changed my spending habits.  Like, I don't go shopping for clothes any more.  I'm just like, "Okay, I have clothes.  I don't need anything else.  I h- -- I have shoes.  I don't need anything else".  Like, I -- I basically go out and I buy groceries and gas, because I'm like any other money has to be put away just in case --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- something even worse happens.
R:  Right.  You don't know when you're going to lose your job.
L:  Yeah, yeah, and --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- Um, --
R:  -- or your husband, for that ma- --  you know what I mean. [MN] My husband's b- been with his company for fourteen years now --  
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- you know.  No, I'm sorry, I'm -- I'm lying.  We're -- we're married fifteen years.  He's been with the company seventeen -- 
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  -- you know, and -- and they just fired his boss and --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- actually they -- they promoted him.  But his boss is like, you know, fifty five years old and --
L:  Congratulations for your husband.
R:  Thanks.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, but -- but this guy got fired, like, a couple weeks before Thanksgiving.
L:  Oh, my gosh! 
R:  You know, and he's fifty five years old, and when is -- where is he going to find another job?  They gave him a lot of severance pay and stuff like that, but where's he going to find another job and how's he going to get his kids', you know, college tuition paid and -- and your whole life changes --  
L:  That's horrible.
R:  -- you know, when something like that happens, and -- and -- like, these big [inaudible] -- big businesses, like these people at Enron, I'm sure they are -- the same thing's happened to them, you know.  Their -- their pensions are gone.  They all invested in the company.
L:  Yeah.
