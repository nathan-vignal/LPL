L:  Hi, I'm Pamela.
R:  Hi, I'm Barbara.
L:  Hi, Barbara.
R:  [LAUGH] How are you?
L:  [LAUGH] Interesting.
R:  Yes, is this your first call?
L:  Huh?
R:  Is this the first time you've done this?
L:  No.
R:  No? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  This is the first one I've done so it'll be a new --
L:  Oh, is it?
R:  Yes, so it'll be a new experience. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] I don't do too many on the cell phone.
R:  Okay.
L:  You're only supposed to be able to do a maximum of three but I've had eight now.
R:  Wow!  That's great.
L:  [MN] So --
R:  Yeah, I'm on a -- just a regular phone so --
L:  Okay, well, the topic is friendship.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay, well this is interesting because I just talked to a very old friend of mine on the phone this morning.
L:  Mm.
R:  We've been friends for -- let me think -- about twenty one years.
L:  Wow.
R:  Long time and --
L:  What do you consider a friend?
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, what do you consider a close friend?
R:  Um, probably someone that you feel real comfortable with, um, someone you can confide in, um, hm, someone that you feel a connection with, um -- through the years, this particular friend I'm thinking of, um, through the years we've found that we have more and more in common than we ever realized because of life experiences --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and backgrounds and things like that. [LAUGH] Um, I guess I'd also say that, um, a friend would be someone that would be loyal and that you know --
L:  Do you keep in touch all the time?
R:  That I could touch all the time?
L:  No, you keep in touch all the time?
R:  Keep in touch?  Um, not always.  Um, we always feel a connection.  I mean there are times when -- in fact, she doesn't live that close to me, she's about, uh, an hour and a half away now and, um, it's someone that I'm so comfortable with that we just, kind of, pick up where we left off, we don't feel like we've lost -- you know, it's not like someone -- oh, gosh -- like --
L:  It's almost like you just talked to 'em just yesterday.
R:  Right, right, um, but we always feel real close, um -- I don't -- it's hard to -- it's hard to [LAUGH] describe.
L:  No, you're doing great.
R:  Yeah, this one, this particular friend I met under kind of unusual circumstances.  We were both at a garage sale and we happened to have kids that were the same age, real young, and we just started talking and from then on we were friends. [LAUGH] Just -- I mean, it's -- it's not the way you really expect to make a friend but we felt a connection right away.  It was just something that drew us to each other, um -- [PAUSE]
L:  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L: That's kind of what I have.  I've got two -- two people like that.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  I didn't get 'em until later in life.
R:  Well, this one I didn't either really.  I was -- let's see, how old was I?  Twenty six.
L:  Yeah, I was in my thirties.
R:  Oh no, excuse me, I was thirty three. [LAUGH] Thirty three was this one and, uh, we've just always -- I -- it's just -- we can not talk to each other for months and we just pick up the phone and it's like we've never been apart, so -- and we used to live real close together.  We were within a block of each other but now we're [LAUGH] -- I don't know, I'm trying to think how many miles it is.  Eighty miles, I guess, so --
L:  That's a ways.
R:  Yeah, that's a ways but we keep in contact so --
L:  So, friendship's, uh -- it's -- so, do you have different categories of friendship?
R:  Uh, yes.
L:  I do. [LAUGH]
R:  Definitely, definitely.  Um, my family says that I can -- I can get someone's life story out of them within about [LAUGH] five minutes usually, just by walking up to them.  I just -- I really tune into people.
L:  So do I.
R:  But that doesn't mean that, um, they're necessarily friends, I'm just interested in people, so -- [LAUGH]
L:  So, casual?
R:  Pardon?
L:  Casual?
R:  Right, right, and it's not that I'm not interested, only I just don't have as close a relationship with them as you would a real good friend. Uh, let's see -- [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I'm the same way, um, exactly actually.
R:  Mm.
L:  I actually have these little categories --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that, uh, you have where you have the hi and goodbye friend.
R:  Right.
L:  It's not really a friend, it's more of an acquaintance.
R:  Right.
L:  And then I've got the -- the, um [NOISE] here's your pen.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then, uh, I've got the, uh -- oh, you get together once in a blue moon kind of friend.
R:  Right.
L:  It's not really someone that, uh, you can trust a hundred percent with everything.  Then I've got your closer friends that when you're in a pinch or you need some help then, uh, they're there.
R:  Right.
L:  And then you have your really best friends that, uh, no matter what you do, say or whatever, they're always still going to be your friends.
R:  That's right, yeah.
L:  I've got these like categories, it's terrible but I do.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I don't think it's so bad.  I mean, each -- each one meets a different need.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, because I have  -- I have other friends that I see but we don't have the emotional connection that a couple of my friends and I do, um -- [LAUGH] I think sometimes it's because, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some people have a hard time being a real friend, um, hm -- how do I say --
L:  Love?
R:  Well, I've got one that I'm thinking of [LAUGH] in particular that's been a friend for a long time and we kind of grew through our kids, again, and, um, we've kind of grown apart and I still care about her but in -- in the past several years she -- I think she's had so many problems that she's kind of, um -- she can't seem to relate to other friends anymore.
L:  Mm.
R:  And she's kind of -- I think, because of the emotional problems, she has found her own little world and it doesn't include her friends.  It includes people that she's working with, however it's not a true friendship.  She's kind of absorbing --
L:  So, she feels safer than getting close?
R:  Right, right.  She's grown away from -- from her other friends and she's absorbed herself so much in her work that she doesn't seem to have time, um, for friends anymore.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, some people just kind of -- they have their levels, their walls.
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know.
R:  Right.
L:  They don't want to -- they can't handle any more and so they just kind of --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- keep those walls up and just want to float through life --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- without having any hassles.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sound about right?
R:  And no connections.  [LAUGH] Right, right.
L:  Yeah.  Well, you don't grow with those 'cause a friendship is like a marriage.
R:  The friendship kind of dies, um -- we call each other once in a while to -- to, um, try to stay in -- or I call her to -- to let her know about other friends and things that are happening in their lives and things but there really isn't any, uh, real connection.
L:  [MN]
R:  So -- [LAUGH]
L:  So, there isn't a depth to it then?
R:  Not like there used to be.  Right.  And then I have friends that I just like to run -- that I run into and you visit and you kind of catch up on things but you never really get together much.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you still care about them but it's -- it's like your -- your -- your lives are paralleling or, you know, you never -- [LAUGH] just because you're all busy and, you know -- but you still care about them on a different level.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you want what's best for 'em.
R:  That's right. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I can understand that.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But, uh, yeah, we do have different levels of friendship.
R:  Definitely.
L:  It -- it's kind of sad but, uh, we all have our baggage, I guess you'd say and --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- because of that then, uh, then, um, you just, uh -- you have to get through the walls sometimes.
