R:  Hi.  My name is Joyce.
L:  Hi.  This is Leona. [SIGH]
R:  Uh, you know, I've got -- I've got to admit I did -- I was [MN] just putting on a headphone here and I -- I -- and missed the first -- the last part of, uh, where they were talking about what the questions were and I -- and when [inaudible] I'd been waiting for about a half hour.  How about you?
L:  You know, it just, um, it just took about a minute.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, and to tell you the -- 
R:  Oh, did you call in or did you -- 
L:  They called me.
R:  They called you.  Okay.
L:  Aha.
R:  I -- I -- I called -- now [several inaudible words] question -- can you -- can you tell me a bit [several inaudible words] questions?  I -- 
L:  Well, I think it [several inaudible words] -- to tell you the truth they went so fast that I don't know if I caught all of it.  I just know that the topic was about corporate scandal, current corporate scandal.
R:  Oh, current corporate scandal.  Okay.  Okay.  I -- I read that when I was reading about the ones.  Okay, current corporate scandal.  Interesting.
L:  So, you know, I really -- and -- and, like I said, she read through this stuff so fast that I didn't get a chance to, you know, hone in on what the topics were -- 
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- under that, under the topic and -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is this your first -- is this your first call or have you -- 
L:  Yes, it is.  This is my first one.
R:  Yeah.  Uh --
L:  Really the only thing that I can think of -- um, I -- I -- I live in the Dallas Fort Worth area and I right now we're going through the whole thing with, um, American Airlines -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- facing bankruptcy and so really, uh, you know, their CEO resigned recently, Donald +Carty -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and he resigned because, you know, he didn't, um, reveal, uh -- and that's all their, you know, salary cutbacks as employees.  He didn't reveal that, you know, like, the top executives were getting all these benefits.
R:  Right.
L:  So, you know, that's -- I -- that's really the only thing that I can think of right now that's going on.  
R:  Well, yeah.  Well, I think tha- -- I think that's a pretty important one.  I, uh, I -- I think, um, yeah, [SIGH] I felt like if I had been an employee who had been asked to take a salary cut in that situation I would really, you know, [LAUGH] I'd be very angry.
L:  Yeah, and the- these employees were taking as much as a fifty -- fifteen per cent reduction in their salary -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which, for someone who is lower to middle class, that's going to pack a larger punch than, you know, if you were an executive and you -- you didn't get, you know, as large of a bonus at the end of the year -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, because it -- it's a bonus after all, it's not your salary.
R:  Right, exactly.   
L:  And so ... 
R:  Well, you know and -- and the thing was, uh, the thing is I think what -- what's interesting to me about that is that when you compare it to the rest of the world -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there just isn't that kind of discrepancy.  Yeah, it -- it's fine, you know, somebody who is an executive who puts in long hours, who we hope is -- is, uh, you know, doing well for the company -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is worth more money, but are they really worth three hundred times or whatever, you know, the m- amazing amount of, uh, times compared to, you know, if you look, you know, [several inaudible words] just recently read where, like, in -- you know, in Japan, you know, the difference between what the lowest and the highest price paid employee is making -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is not nearly that kind of difference.
L:  Yeah.  It -- it's really -- I mean, I understand why all of those employees demanded that he resign -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and he did, he just did that yesterday, but in terms of how do you restrict that when you're a private company? 
R:  Yeah.  That's right.  Yeah.  That's --
L:  You know?  I mean, and, you know, the government can't really restrict that -- 
R:  No.  No.
L:  -- unless you're an employee owned kind of company and I know there's a few out there like that, where, you know, you could probably -- like, the CEO couldn't make like, you know, his salary couldn't exceed ten times the salary of, you know, their lowest paid individual or something.
R:  Right.
L:  That there's really no, when you are talking about private enterprise, there's really no way to restrict that.
R:  Right.  Well, I -- I think that is -- is, you know, ultimately the question as far as -- as private enterprise is, you know, what -- what -- what does a corporation ethically owe to, uh, its employees, to, you know, to society.  I mean, you know, where, uh, you know, where -- you know, where -- where do we draw you the line, you know -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, in a free enterprise system -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- between, you know, it -- it's -- and I'm thinking, you know, I think -- I think there's very few people who would kind of say anything goes, right? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean that's sort of the far out end.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then, you know, and then to -- to a completely controlled corporation, so -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, you know, where -- where -- how do you get it [MN] in between and, um, you know, a -- a moderate viewpoint that -- that where people will really feel good about that.
L:  It -- well, [MN] at least one thing that America does have going for it, or -- or at least the employees, is the unions, you know -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- that flight attendants as well as other, like, maintenance workers, they are unionized -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- so at least, you know, they do have that when they come to the bargaining table, I mean they do have that power of a union -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they can negotiate and [MN] so, I mean, at least that's there, but -- 
R:  Right, and that -- that -- that does provide a balance, you know, it's, um -- I know, are you -- are y- -- I'm -- I'm not in a union, my husband is in a union -- my husband is a teacher and he's in a union.
L:  Oh, really?  No, I'm not -- I'm not in an occupation where I could be in a union.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but, uh, I -- [MN] I don't know how other corporations work, though.  I mean, you know, I'm kind of, because I live here and I'm familiar with, like, you know, the big employers in town, but I don't know if, like, you know, like, IBM or, um, you know, Compaq or [MN] other companies are -- are they unionized.  I don't know.
R:  Right.
L:  Because -- because that I think may be a good way to, like, you know, al- always protect the interests of the le- [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the lemon on the totem pole. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I think, you know, I -- I think, you know, that -- that can in- -- that's interesting because my -- I know, my sister, who is a professional, who -- but who is unionized, she's a reporter and she will always c- comment to me, you know, when she's talking about, like, the kind of benefits that she has -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and she'll say, you know, "Well", you know, uh, "That's because I've got the union", you know, and -- and there -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and there in -- there in fact is some kinds of protection there -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [several inaudible words] and I -- I, you know, uh -- 
L:  Yeah, well, and I think the unions here put a lot of pressure on the CEO to resign.
R:  Right.
L:  So there I think they're really effective -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- in trying to get a, you know, trying to oust the existing leadership and I don't know who is, you know, going to take over for them, but at least they worry it will take that much pressure, you know, to make him resign.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, so, anyway, I don't know.
R:  Yes.
L:  That -- that's really the only, um, company that comes to mind right now.
R:  Right.  Well, yeah, the whole Enron thing to me is -- is so sort of, [SIGH] you know, I mean, it -- it's almost be- -- you know, you hear Enron and it's become, oh, kind of a -- a -- a symbol of what the problem is with corporate -- corporate America, but I'm not sure how -- how well I understand it and I think you're right, I think the American airlines one is -- is just so -- so out there and so obvious, you know.  We know that this is wrong and I mean, I know -- I know that -- that the Enron thing was, you know, part of it was with, uh, stock options and, you know, it was people knowing that they, you know, that they were selling the stock because they knew it was going down and yet the -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the -- the other people having -- having their money in their pension plans and I guess that's the other thing about the corporate scandals that I think about and I'm -- I'm fifty five, I'm -- you know, so I -- I start thinking about retirement -- 
L:  Oh, certainly.
R:  And people who -- people who've lost their entire, you know, all -- they, you know, they thought that the corporation was going to be -- protect them -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that their pension plan was safe and what happened to the pension plans of so many employees.  The --
L:  I know. [inaudible] [MN] That's enough, like, hard core reality.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean I just -- I don't -- I -- I don't know what I would have done or what I would do in that situation.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I mean how do you start all over? 
R:  Right.
L:  You can't get your fifty five years back or whatever, you know.
R:  Right.  Peop- people that -- that thought that, you know, they had, um, for, you know, for so long, uh, given so much to a company, you know, and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think that -- and even, you know, even, [MN] you know, my -- my father's generation, you know -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my father, you know, who -- where -- where there was that -- that idea that -- that the company, you know, re- -- you know, you gave to the company and the company gave back to you and -- and there -- there was just a -- a feeling that -- 
L:  Yeah, and there's very few companies now that you see that -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- really.  I mean, I -- I used to work for a little while for, um, Radio Shack, uh -- 
R:  Uh.
L:  -- too, which is also based in Fort Worth --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as a technical writer and now I have to say that that company is just very -- very, um, old sc- -- old school.
