R:  Julie.
L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  It's Julie.
L:  Hi.  It's Jay Lynn.
R:  How are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  Pretty good.
L:  Very interesting, isn't this? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's -- this is my second one so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, this is -- this is my second one too, yeah.  The first one I was like, "Okay, how do I do this?" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But this doesn't seem like too hard of a topic.
R:  No, no, no, no.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I live in Missouri.
L:  Missouri?  I'm in Florida.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, that's got -- probably [LAUGH] going to, uh, easier for me to say I like warm weather activities. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I was --
L:  We can always --
R:  I -- I don't know.  I enjoy -- I like just the type of weather that Missouri has.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  It's not always real hot but it's not really cold [LAUGH] either.
L:  Well, you get -- you get snow there too though right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  I prefer to stay, um, seventy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like it was today, it was great. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, today we had a lot of rain so it was indoor activity day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, most of my activities are with my kids though.  They're, um ...
R:  I know how that is. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have two of 'em.
L:  Yeah, I have three boys so basically, uh, it's a lot of, uh, baseball.
R:  Oh, you're busy. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's ba- it's baseball season all seaso- all year here so ...
R:  Right.
L:  A lot of baseball so ... and only out- I don't know, I ba- I like more indoor activities, mys-
R:  Right.
L:  For myself, you know, like crafts --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and things like that.
R:  Right.
L:  But, uh, outdoor activities ... I mean, I started roller blading so that was interesting.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, bu-
R:  I've never done that. [LAUGH]
L:  No, I -- I [LAUGH] -- I actually bought a pair and tried with a friend of mine and, I mean, I'm slow. I'm not like these kids that whiz around on them, but, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it was interesting.  Did I enjoy it?  No.  It's a little too hot.  You get too sweaty.  Um ... except for swimming, I felt the only outdoor activity I enjoy.  Um ...
R:  I do -- I do a lot of ... we do a lot of camping and --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- gardening and ...
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  -- hiking with our kids and ...
L:  Hiking? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I don't know.  We do cave touring every once in a ... [SIGH] every other year or so.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  I like that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's nice.  Yeah, most of my -- um, well, I used to live in Pennsylvania and -- and then, you know, there were a couple of camping things, but not -- not too much into that.  Mostly it's -- it's sports related activities which is --
R:  Right.
L:  -- which is cool ... but ...
R:  Uh, my kids don't do much sports but --
L:  No?
R:  They're more the [SIGH] ... go to the theme parks and the swimming and the ... stuff like that.  Just out ... out in the p- parks and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we go to our local -- local lake.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We have a lake.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Within about ... ten miles of us.
L:  Oh, that's not bad.  Well, my area in Florida has a lot of parks.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So, yeah, so we are -- you know, if we're not at the baseball field, we're at the -- we're at the parks playing or, um --
R:  I've never been to Florida.
L:  Uh, it's -- it's hot.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's ho- I've here for almost three years and, I mean ... the difference, you know, Penns- being in Pennsylvania and outdoor activities ...
R:  Right.
L:  -- like you could tolerate it.  Here, like, forget about the summertime.  Like -- like up there, I'm sure in the summertime you go camping and things like that and it's nice.
R:  Right.
L:  And here if you go, it is just too hot, and the humidity it -- like, last week we actually had a nice week.  There wasn't any humidity but that I don't like, humidity.
R:  Very seldom do we ever get where it's just so terrible that you can't stand it.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I mean, a little bit but --
L:  Well, maybe the Missour-
R:  Like a couple a weeks. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that -- that wouldn't be too bad.  Like, Miss- you know, I was mostly from Pennsylvania, New Jersey and there's a lot of humidity there.  So, maybe Missouri's the place to be ...
R:  Well --
L:  -- for outdoors.
R:  -- I've never lived anywhere else. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I can't say -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] I --
R:  I've never talked to any of the others. [LAUGH]
L:  Really?  I lived New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Florida and the difference between what you do, like, in -- inside -- I'm inside a lot.  [LAUGH] Other -- you know, other than --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, I've learned, uh, to do crafts and -- and, uh, now my friend's got me into scrapbooking so ... you know, for myself, I think I'm --
R:  Right.
L:  -- more the indoorsy type, you know, than -- than being outside.  I do that kind of for my kids, like, [LAUGH] kinda grin and bear it.
R:  [LAUGH] Go when you can. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I know. [LAUGH]
L:  Or, sometimes I just tell my husband, "Go ahead.  Take them.  I'm not into the doors today".
R:  I have one of each.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And my girl's the oldest so ... and she's not really into that.  She'd rather do the inside, making little things and ...
L:  Right.  Right, so you have to --
R:  My son plays out -- would rather play outside all day.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's -- I don't know what it's like to have a girl but I have friends that have girls and, you know, I tend to wonder what it would be like because mine are always -- my boys are always on the go, outside, in --
R:  Completely different. [LAUGH]
L:  -- dirt and ... [LAUGH]
R:  It's completely different. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I was mostly indoor kind of person until, obviously they started playing ball and -- and that's gotten me and -- and I go -- you know, like my little one's in t-ball so, you know, I go to the practices and my husband coaches it so I'll get out there on the field with them and things like that.
R:  Right.
L:  But that's about ... you know, as much outdoor kinda weather that I like ... but ...
R:  So, really you haven't -- have you been around, like, lots of snow and stuff before?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have you lived --
L:  Yeah, yeah, I liv- I mean, when I --
R:  And you didn't ...
L:  I was raised in -- well, you know what?  I like to see the snow, and I used to ski.  When I was younger I loved outside stuff, skiing and all that.  And --
R:  As long as you don't have to shovel it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but now I ha- I mean, when I lived in Pennsylvania, like, up 'til three years ago, I just hate -- 'cause now I have to drive in it and the ice and the snow and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, forget -- so, as far as that goes, Florida is definitely [LAUGH] the place to be.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Because the day it snows here, I go to another country.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I mean, like during the winter, I do a lot -- lots ... crafts when I can't get in my -- my --
L:  Right.
R:  -- garden and stuff but ...
L:  Of course.
R:  -- during the summer I'm ...
L:  [MN] Outside all the time?
R:  Spend a lot of time out.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, the weather should be nice up there now.  This is ... probably like the --
R:  Um ...
L:  -- best time of year.
R:  Actually it's been kinda unusual because we've -- went through a little bit of real nice weather and then it, like, took a cold spell.
L:  Right.
R:  And now we're gradually going back to where we should be.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well, that's good so --
R:  Slowly.  [LAUGH]
L:  They could go back outside again.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, we had a lot of rain there for several days --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's just ...
L:  Well, w- we have our rainy season coming up so that's like your -- you know, you're in the middle of doing something outside and it -- you have this big downpour for about an hour.
R:  Yep, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And then it ruins the whole thing you were doing outside.
R:  That's right. [LAUGH]
L:  And you can go back out again and start over.
R:  We had a -- we had a wedding out to go to that was outside today.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And it rained yesterday.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  [LAUGH] And I was like, "Man, this isn't going to be a good wedding". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, now, today it was like ... sixty eight, sixty nine, so ...
L:  Well, that's not bad.
R:  It was great weather.  [LAUGH] To go to the park.
L:  We actually had -- yeah, like last week we had no humidity and even though it was in the eighties, you would never even think it because it was a cool breeze and it was like perfect weather last week and --
R:  Oh, that would be nice.
L:  -- and then I didn't mind, you know, okay let's go to the park.  Let's, uh -- then I don't mind the outside stuff but, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you ... it gets --
R:  The humidity. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no.  It -- yeah, it's -- it's -- you feel like --
R:  You just can't do much in, uh, in that.  I know my soon to be husband works outside and ... I'm dreading those real hot days. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, when he comes home. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He's building hotels so ...
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's an interesting ... thing.
R:  Yeah.  W- actually we're getting married next weekend.
L:  Oh, neat.
R:  Outdoors. [LAUGH]
L:  Outdoors?  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So ... 
L:  Hopefully the rain is gone ...
R:  Ooh!
L:  -- and you'll have a nice weekend.
R:  We just got the weather for ... we're actually going down to Arkansas border --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- get married.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we just got the weather report and it's supposed to be cloudy but nice.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, as long as it's nice.
R:  [LAUGH] I agree, as long as it's nice. 
L:  Oh, that's great.  So ...
R:  So --
L:  -- you've got a lot going on. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, we do.
L:  That's good.
R:  We just -- I don't know.  Right -- we're in the middle of building a -- a big fishpond with ...
L:  Oh.
R:  -- flowers and ... all that in the yard.
L:  Oh, that's gonna be great.
R:  I mean, I put a lot of time into that kinda stuff and ...
L:  Well, that'll be great.  And the kids too.
R:  I just re-
L:  Or -- or I should say your son ...
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- will like the fishpond. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, yes, he -- he'll probably spend more time [inaudible] in it --
L:  Right, right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- than he will doing -- [LAUGH] I just recently stopped working and -- and actually being able to stay home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And ... I've done more craft this last year --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- than I have ever done. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  Well, now you'll have the best of both worlds.  You'll have the in- the crafts that you do ...
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- on the not so good days, and the gardening and the ...
R:  I mean, everything for our wedding we made by hand.
L:  That's great.  I did that for my -- like, I got married ten yea-
R:  I get into the craft and then it's like, "Well, why can't you do this?" and then ... [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause I know as soon as -- my brother's getting married in August and my sister called me -- they're getting married in New York and she said, "You remember when you did stuff for my shower?  Can you do stuff for Tracey's shower?" 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm like ... Uh-huh.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And she goes, "Well, I thought you wanted to".  I'm like ... not really.  Well, then we'll think of something else.  I'm like, "I'll do it", you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- 'cause they always see like I do fabric -- fabric photo albums also and I always do them for fun and as a gift and -- and then you get my dad who has friends that have had k- that have kids that ju-
