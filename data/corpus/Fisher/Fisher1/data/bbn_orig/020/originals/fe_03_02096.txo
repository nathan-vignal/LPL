L:  Hi.
R:  Hello. [SIGH] I --
L:  How are [LAUGH] you?
R:  [LAUGH] Good.  How are [LAUGH] you?
L:  [LAUGH] Fine thanks.
R:  Good.  I am Susan and I'm from Indiana.
L:  [LAUGH] Nice to meet you.  My name is Mariko and I'm from California.
R:  Hi.  Wow, I'm getting to talk to people from all over.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  This is so fun. [LAUGH]
L:  It is, actually.  I talked --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to a woman yesterday from Washington so I was, like, "Yeah  --"
R:  Wow.
L:  "-- that's pretty neat".
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  It was neat.
R:  Yeah, I talked to someone from Texas and from Georgia, I think, so, yeah -- [LAUGH]
L:  It's neat actually talking to different people because you get different personalities --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and you get different accents --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and it's -- it's nice.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's really nice.
R:  I know.  I've had fun doing it, too, so -- well, tell me about you and friends. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, this is actually a really good time to talk about it.  I'm on my way to my best friend's house right now.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And, um, I've known her since -- gosh, since we were, like, five years old.
R:  Yes.
L:  The thing is we are so different to a point where --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, we shouldn't even be friends.
R:  Yes. [NOISE]
L:  Um, you know, I don't have a lot of -- I -- you know, I have a lot of acquaintances but I don't consider many people my friend, exactly.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  Um, because I think when you say that you have a lot of friends it's spreading yourself too thin, basically.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Because a friendship is a really important thing.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  To me it is.  So, um, I think I keep this friend -- my best friend mainly because
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I love her, she's more like family than anything else.
R:  Yes.
L:  But with newer people that I have it's -- it's more I ought to call them acquaintances rather than friends from the start.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  So, you know, I have a small intimate group of friends that are really friends and everyone else, they're just acquaintances.
R:  Yeah, yeah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I would feel similarly, and I bet you're real close with her even though you're so different.  Do you think it's because probably you became friends when you were so little?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If I would have met her, um, let's say if I met her a week ago --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- we wouldn't be friends at all.
R:  Yeah, because you're totally different types of people.
L:  We are.
R:  That's ne- -- yeah, childhood experiences I think are real bonding kind of issues so --
L:  Mhm, they're hard to break, also, so --
R:  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's true. [LAUGH]
L:  But you know what I was -- one point that I was going to make 'cause when I was younger -- I'm not very old now [LAUGH] but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- when I was in high school or junior high, you know, everybody's your friend.  You met some --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- somebody once, you're like, "Oh, I know this -- my friend over here", you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they might not even remember you but when you're younger you think that everybody's your friend.
R:  Right.  Well, you know what I think, too, it's because you're at school all the time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, you're forced to be with everybody [LAUGH] so --
L:  Oh, that's -- that's a good point, I never really thought of it that way.
R:  Yeah.  Well, see my point in the spectrum now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is I'm a mom with three kids and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm home all the time so --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- it's sort of like I don't get a whole lot of chance [NOISE] to get out and -- well, the friends I already have I'm really grateful for because -- [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause I'm kinda grounded now [LAUGH].
L:  But you know what, it's -- it's also, um, a lot of your friends, do they have kids also or no?
R:  Yea- --  A lot of them do, although a lot of the people that I know, because of their kids, we're more acquaintances.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because I've found that with having little kids, at least, you can't really visit with a person that much [LAUGH]. 
L:  [LAUGH] No, no.
R:  You know, there's the ki- -- in fact, even now, once we started talking, two of my kids came in from outside, the two year old and three year old, and I just walked upstairs and closed the door. [LAUGH]
L:  That's important.  Right -- right now, my daughter's in the car --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and I told her, I'm like, "I'm going to be on the phone really fast, is that okay with you?"
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  And she said, "Okay".  And the friend that I'm --
R:  How old is she?
L:  She's seven years old.
R:  Oh, that's neat.
L:  I have -- I know this sounds really strange 'cause everybody says this about their kids.  Either your kid's a perfect angel --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- or they're a devil.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Mine is an angel, all the way through [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, oh.
L:  But one of things that my friend and I -- the one that I'm going to right now [inaudible] is, she has two little kids --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and one way born fourteen days before my daughter.
R:  Oh, neat.
L:  And the other one is three so that's really another reason why I go over there, so my daughter has someone to grow up with.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  Um, but with my friend, her, is just really hard because she always wants to go out --
R:  Oh, yes, oh.
L:  -- and I'm -- I'm more grounded.  I love staying home with my daughter.
R:  Yes.
L:  I love it, you know, I love doing things with my kids.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, in fact, what I'm doing right now is going over to pick up her daughter -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, to take them out, you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I -- [LAUGH] A lot of my friends, like, the friends that I do have, they all have kids but they are more similar to what I like to do and take -- doing things with the kids and themselves.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So --
R:  That's true, that's true.  And that's wonderful that she would be so accommodating.  Wh- -- [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you know, I have a lot of -- I, you know, love care of, you know -- as long as -- I think kids are more important than actual friendships [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, if I see kids that are not being treated very well --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I would -- I have no problem giving up my free time --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- to take them to do something fun.
R:  Right.  And that -- well, then, how wonderful for them. We need --
L:  It is.
R:  -- people like that, you know [LAUGH].
L:  It's fr- -- you know what, little kids are great because how we treat them -- to tie it back in to like the whole group of friendship -- is how they're going to treat their friends when they're older.
R:  Yeah, well, that's true.
L:  So --
R:  That's very true, and you want to treat your children well, yeah, because you want them to see that and hopefully they will -- they will treat you that way too. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  I see -- oh, my goodness, I just had my daughter's seventh birthday party last, like, I believe two weeks ago, and you would not believe how many kids I saw badmouthing their parents.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  Like, a couple of the parents got lost and one of the moms told me that their daughter was saying, "Mom, you're stupid, you can't find the house" and --
R:  Oh, gee, and this is seven years old, I mean -- [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Yes, and I was so shocked.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  I was thinking if my daughter ever said anything like that to me --
R:  Yeah . [LAUGH]
L:  -- I would be -- I would be -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That would not be good.
L:  No, it wasn't, so --
R:  Well, and you need to get on it now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, because otherwise you're going to have a teenager that -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, do you -- what's the age of your oldest child?
R:  Um, well, actually she is five and she'll be six in about a week, so --
L:  Oh, congratulations!
R:  -- actually our kids aren't that much different [LAUGH].
L:  It's -- I'm sorry, but it's fun.  If I could --
R:  Oh, it's neat.
L:  -- I would have more kids now but I have to wait till I finish school.
R:  Yeah, well, see, you're smart.  I was older -- I was thirty two when I had my first so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I'm like an older mom but I didn't get married till I was thirty one, so --
L:  [NOISE] See, I wish --
R:  But that's neat to get your schooling out of the way 'cause isn't it hard with ki- -- lot of study and all that, gosh?
L:  You know what?  The study isn't so mu- -- so bad because I can do it in the night time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I -- I'm trying to tie everything back [LAUGH] to -- to this whole topic of friendship --
R:  Yes, you're good. [LAUGH]
L:  -- because I'm not sure what the --
R:  I always go off on a tangent. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm not sure what they're listening for but, um, at school it's like I noti- -- a lot of the people that I meet --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, they -- they're just so different than myself and the ones that don't have kids, so I really don't -- I can't call them friends --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- because we don't relate on any level.
R:  Right, right.
L:  So --
R:  I can see how that would be really hard.
L:  Yes.
R:  But that's really interesting, yeah.  Yeah, I'd probably say my best friend is a lady who I, um, taught with because I was a teacher before I had kids --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and we -- it's kinda funny too because we don't have that much in common.  She's the age of my mom and the year I quit teaching to have my daughter was the year she retired from teaching.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, um, even now we get together once a month and we'll go out to lunch and we call a lot and back when we were teaching, like, we went to London one year over Christmas break and, I don't know, we just had -- you know, it's not somebody who's my age range  -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so I wouldn't think they'd be a friend but she's ended up to be the best friend so -- yeah, like you said, there's really no predicting in friendships.
