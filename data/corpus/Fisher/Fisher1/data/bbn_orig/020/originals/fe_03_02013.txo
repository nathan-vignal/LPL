L:  Hello, my name's Lou. 
R:  Hi Lou, I'm Michael.
L:  How are you, Michael?
R:  Fine, thank you.  Fort Lauderdale, Florida here.
L:  Fort Lauderdale.  I'm in Pittsburgh, wish I were in Lauderdale.  I've been down there, ah, frequently for diving in the area.  We're not supposed to talk diving, we're supposed to talk about corporate scandals, is that it?
R:  That's what it sounded like.  It was a little fast for me to comprehend.
L:  Yeah, they, [LAUGH] they went rather quickly on me too.  All right.  I think what I caught was what can the government do about illegal business activities.  That sound like --
R:  That works.
L:  That works, all right.  Um, wanna go first?
R:  Not really.  There's not much they can do. [LAUGH]
L:  I guess there's not much.  First you gotta catch them, and if you catch them, then you've got to, ah, prosecute them, if you're able to prosecute them.  You know, that takes care of that guy, but I don't know what it's going to do for the next one.
R:  Well, you take something like Enron, nobody's in jail for it yet.  It's been what, a year and a half?
L:  Yep.
R:  No settlements, no prosecutions.
L:  Ah, I guess when you get something on that level or of that magnitude, um, you know -- I mean you catch somebody shoplifting in a five and dime, you can move on them rather quickly, 'cause it's, ah, comprehensible dimensions.  But when someone does billions and they, ah, rob everybody on paper from top to bottom I guess it's not real easy to go after them.  My, ah, my assessment.
R:  [LAUGH] Seems reasonable.  Um, yeah, I see Enron and then I see what's happening with American Airlines where the execs are taking perks while the, ah, employees are taking pay cuts --
L:  Taking the pay cuts.  It was [MN] years ago I once read something about the Japanese, how they kept things like that under control, and they did everything in matters of proportions, like if you were -- if you had the lowest job you were like, one, okay.  And then like the guy above you got, like, to get twice what you got paid, and went up and it was like it maxed out so that the head of the company, the CEO could only make fifty times as much as the lowest paid person.  And so that it was like all laid out down the line.  You know, you couldn't have, like you had at American Airlines, some executive who they hired and ran the place into bankruptcy making millions while, you know, the guys lower down don't make anything.  So everybody knew if you were going to be the CEO of the company, the most you could make is fifty times as much as the janitor.  It seemed to me to be an eminently fair way of going about it.
R:  Well, I'd certainly like to see that, ah, practiced here, but unfortunately it's never gonna happen with all the, ah, billions of dollars made that eventually evaporated in the markets and all the golden parachutes.
L:  That's my question.  Where did all that money go?  I mean -- 
R:  That's a -- I don't know.
L:  Like, like where did it all go?  I mean --
R:  I think of it as evaporating.
L:  And, and, and that's -- I mean, that's basically the, the -- what it seems to of happened.  You know, like I've got, you know, a portfolio, and three years ago when they would send me things every month it says you're worth this much, and now, you know, I'm worth like a third that much.  But I mean, I never had any money in my pocket, and --
R:  Well, you chose not to have money in your pocket.
L:  Yeah.  I didn't, I didn't cash in.  It was -- this was supposed to be a thing that was supposed to grow towards retirement.  So it's like, well you're worth this, you're worth this, and now I'm not worth that.  But where did all the money go in the meantime?
R:  I don't think, ah, anybody made money on it.  Maybe the arbitrators.
L:  Well, did anybody actually get any money, or take any money, or, or like, buy things with any of that money, or was it all just on paper?  Was it just like figures that were not --
R:  Well, people that were doing well certainly took advantage of the, of the, of the income.  Some people, you know, took income instead of growth.  And, ah, um, I, I have first hand knowledge of a couple that retired.  He was in his fifties, she was fifty -- maybe forty eight at the time.  They sold their very expensive home in Annapolis.  He quit his medical practice, she sold her, her small business, and they went to live on their sail boat.  And they cruised the Bahamas and the Carribean in the winter, and went up to Maine and worked their way south over the summer.  And they did that for three or four years.  Enron came along and their net worth and income evaporated so much that they've both gone back to Annapolis, Maryland, and reentered the workforce.  
L:  Well, they at least got their three, four years out of it.
R:  Yep.
L:  Well, I, I did something kind of similar just this past six months.  I watched my retirement folio evaporating, [MN] it went down so far that finally in December I said, the hell with it, I went out and bought a brand new Harley, hundredth anniversary edition.  I said --
R:  That's the big soft tail chain drive?
L:  That's the big -- yeah, it's the ele- I got the Electra Glide.  It's the big anniversary Electra Glide.  The, the, the touring bike.  And I said, well what the hell, I might as well ride my [LAUGH] ah, retirement.
R:  Well, you may as well go to Sturgess in August.
L:  Go out to Sturgess and at least I've got the, you know, at least I've got something in hand.  I've got an actual physical motorcycle.
R:  You need a motorhome to go with that, and then head out to Sturgess for six weeks.
L:  For six weeks?  It would be -- actually, between the two -- I would rather head down your way.  I would rather take the bike, head down your way, and do the diving down there.  Rather than up to Sturgess.  Go down, ah, well Bike Week in Daytona's too early in March, the water's too cold to dive down there.  March.  But I'd rather head down your way on that bike and then, ah, start in Lauderdale and work my way through the keys, and dive off of all the reefs and the wrecks down there.  That -- now that at least I'd have something to show for what was on that paper for my retirement before they finally put me away.
R:  [LAUGH] Well there's a lot of people that are in worse shape than that.
L:  Yep.
R:  So, you know, look at people with credit card debt now.  And, ah, and, and getting hit by Enron.
L:  Yeah.  That's all the way up and down the line, I guess it's got everybody hit.
R:  But I like the Japanese system.
L:  I thought that was eminently fair.  I mean, you know, as you move your way up the line you knew exactly what you had, you were exactly in proportion to everybody else down the line.
R:  Well maybe congress should get involved somehow.
L:  Well, I -- they, they don't seem to have much of an incentive.  It does not seem like our congress has been hit as badly [LAUGH] by the economic situations as we have.
R:  Because they're supported by corporate America.
L:  Supported by corporate America.
R:  So therefore the little guy can never do anything, and the shoplifter's gonna continue to go to jail, or the cashier who, who takes two dollars for lunch is gonna continue to go to jail while the CEO, who has a golden parachute, is gonna make millions of dollars no matter what happens to the company.  Without any responsibility.
L:  Yeah, that, that is a mind blower that the guys that the hire run the place into bankruptcy and they still get paid.  I mean, ah, you know, a salesman who works on commission, a guy who sells cars, you don't sell the car, you don't get a pay check.  You know, if, if the company that hires you, ah, you don't sell for them or produce for them, you get nothing, they get nothing.  It's amazing that someone they hire to run a company ruins the company, and yet he still makes a profit out of it all.
R:  And he comes in with the knowledge that he's a corporate raider.
L:  Yep.  Knows that going in.  Worse other than that, I mean, one of these days I'd like to get in a -- in a discussion with one of those guys who, you know, made their millions out of that and, and see their perspective, how they defend that.
R:  Oh, call Bill Gates.
L:  Well --
R:  Or Ted Turner.
L:  Yeah, Ted Turner.  Yeah, no, those two guys, that's not an Enron thing.  Those guys did provide stuff, okay.  I mean, Gates provided, ah, I mean, I, I understand the monopoly and the whole routine --
R:  How 'bout Donald Trump?
L:  Well, all right, you got -- okay, Trump is -- Trump is a -- yeah, Trump, I would say, is a -- did not provide anything for anybody.  He just skimmed.  He just, he just took the money and ran.  I'll, I'll go with Trump.  Gates, Gates provided something.  I mean, I can't, I can't dump on gates because, you know, I sit and use my computer, and as frustrating as it is, he, he made it possible for me to do that.
R:  And get paid ten bucks for this phone call. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah [LAUGH]
