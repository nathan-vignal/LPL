R:  Hello, this is Kevin Shawnbach.  I'd like to talk a little bit about corporate scandal real quick.  Cor- --
L:  All right, cool.  This is Toni May King.  Hello?
R:  Hello, how are you doing?
L:  I'm good, how are you?
R:  I'm doing great thanks, how are you?
L:  Okay, I'm great.
R:  Awesome.
L:  Okay, so what -- I'm sorry, I didn't really get the topic of the day. [LAUGH]
R:  The topic is corporate scandal and how -- what American government can do to curb corporate scandal.
L:  Okay, all right.  Go ahead.  So --
R:  You want my -- you want my thoughts on it or just you want me to spit some rhymes on it?
L:  [LAUGH] Ah, I'm on a cellphone.
R:  You're on a cellphone right now?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So what do you want -- what exactly do you want me to say?  Just corporate, about corporate scandal and such?
L:  Yeah, like um, 'cause I'm not too, you know, familiar with the whole, you know, corporate world and --
R:  Yeah, me neither.
L:  -- you know, all that stuff.  So I don't -- I'm not, you know.  I don't know too much about it, I just know that, you know, big problem, but, um -- so, what do you think?
R:  Well, this is what I think about corporate scandals.
L:  Okay.
R:  I -- I'm kind of torn between the issue right now, because --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- on one hand I think that business should be allowed to, to, I don't know, run this country.  I think Adam Smith's wealth of nations, and Adam Smith's free market or laissez faire economy is what really --
L:  Right.
R:  -- drives this country.  
L:  Okay.
R:  But on the other hand I think we've come to a point where big business has come to dominate not only the economic facet of this country but also the political and social facet of this country, and I don't think --
L:  I would -- I'd have to agree with you, yes.
R:  You don't agree with me?
L:  I would have to agree with you.
R:  Oh, you would have to agree with me, well that's good --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I'm glad we're in agreement.  What's your name?
L:  Toni May.
R:  Toni May?
L:  Yes.
R:  Well, I'm glad we're in agreement on this.  Should I continue?
L:  Continue, please.
R:  Okay.  Well, like I was saying --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like, as I think that it is nec- is necessary for businesses to, I don't know, to determine the economic progress of this country, I also think that they've come to a point where it's -- they're determining too much of the progress of this country --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I think more power needs to be restored to the country.  And like we've seen in Enron and other major corporate scandals --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the government needs to step in and make sure that they're not taking advantage of the common man, and they're not taking advantage of the stock holder.
L:  Right.
R:  Okay.  All -- like, and I think the government has a role in stepping in and saying that no, you can't pull the wool over the eyes, 'cause I mean, I think the average American is fairly educated and knows what's going on --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but they don't necessarily understand the inner workings and the internal workings of the corporate world --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I don't think they should be taken advantage of, which is I think what happened with Enron.
L:  Okay.
R:  These people buy stock, and then the -- the CEOs and the other big wigs of this company take advantage of them.
L:  Right.
R:  And they don't really know what's going on.  And I don't think that's fair.
L:  No.
R:  No, I don't think that's fair.  I think the government has a job and has a responsibility to step in and make sure this kind of thing doesn't go on. 
L:  Right.  I definitely agree with you, but the thing is, how does, how would you suggest the government do that.  Like, set up guidelines, set up, um, you know, like, what?  There should be government officials coming in to these com- um, companies once in a while to check up on them, or, or you know, like how exactly?
R:  Mm, that's a very good question.  And a pressing issue in today's contemporary society.  What I suggest is that com- companies be left alone, because we do still indeed exist in a laissez faire economy --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but I also think that if there seems to be irregularities in the economy, and if certain companies seem to be making unreal profits or if people seem to be taken advantage of, I think then certain monitors in the government need to step in and see that.  I think that the economy should be monitored in such a way that the businesses should be left alone, but if certain extremities are caused, or people see that businesses are taking too far advantage of the people, then I think the government has a job to step in and, and prevent this kind of thing from happening.
L:  Well -- yes.  I, I agree.  But the, the thing about this whole situation is that, you know, in the ideal world that's what, you know, we would love to happen --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but you know, really, is it even close to being realistic, you know.  Like, how -- like the common man really, like you said, know nothing about what's going on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, in the inner workings of, you know, corporate America.  And, um, you know, I don't think corporate America's really ready to let, you know, us know.  And I don't see how the government can really step in and make a difference.
R:  Well, you know, I -- you make a very good point.  And I think that it's very difficult for -- right now for the government to draw a line where they can intercede and where they can't.  Because we still have a society where the government is still very scared -- and well -- and well they should be -- to step in and prevent a, a company from doing such and such activity.  Um, mm.  Good question.  I think unless there's existing doubt that the government is abusing -- or that a certain company is abusing privileges of pulling the wool over the eyes of their investors and certain stock holders, they should --
L:  Right.
R:  -- be left alone.  Um, I'm not very familiar with the inner workings of the government, and I'm not very familiar with the legislature of government, so I can't give you specific, ah, legislature on how the government should prevent this sort of thing from happening.  I mean --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I can't tell you that.  But I do think that there should be a certain line which with -- mm.  There should be a certain line where which the government should step in, but for the most part companies and the economy should be left alone, you know.
L:  Right.  Like 'cause that's how it's been working and it's been working fine.
R:  Yeah, I think it's a capitalist economy and that's where we should leave it.
L:  Right.  Oh, look, look, look, look. [LAUGH] Yes.  Okay. [NOISE] I've -- yeah, I don't, I don't know, you know. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, it's, it's a hard -- it's a, you know, it's a difficult [NOISE] situation.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  It is a very difficult debate.  I would agree with you.
L:  Yeah.  And I really [NOISE] I really don't know, like you said, I, I mean it's easy to say the government should step in, but you know, how.  And when.  You know, I guess it's really when, you know.  When does it become too much.  And --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, you know what I'm saying, like when have they --
R:  When, like you're, you're asking me, you're asking me for a definite point in which the government should have authorization to step in and prevent certain companies from abusing their rights?
L:  Right.
R:  Mm.
L:  Exactly.  You know, like, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the whole thing is, because of, you know, how the whole, um, how America works and how, you know, capitalist nations works, a lot of times, you know, these big businesses have certain, you know, ins into the government, you know what I'm saying, and so it's all, you know, a big mess --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- whereby you'll never really know because, you know, there might be some kind of, you know, underhanded thing going on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so.  So, I don't know.
R:  You don't know.  I don't know either, girl.
L:  [LAUGH] I really don't know. 
R:  Here, girl, let's not talking about businesses, just tell me a little bit about yourself.
L:  Okay, great.  So I am a -- I go to the University of Virginia -- I mean, of -- sorry, of Pennsylvania.  Wow.  Yeah.  I go to the University of Pennsylvania and right now --
R:  Oh, you go to the University of Pennsylvania?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are you from -- are you from Pennsylvania at all?
L:  No.
R:  [NOISE] You don't? 
L:  No.
R:  Oh, I'm from Pennsylvania, so I thought maybe we'd know each other, but maybe --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- not 'cause you're not from Pennsylvania.
L:  No, I'm not.  I, I just go here.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I, I actually grew up in West Africa, but I'm from New York.
R:  Huh, you grew up in West Africa?  That is really awesome.  Where in West Africa?
L:  Um, Cote d'Ivoire.
R:  Cote d'Iviore, wow, the Ivory Coast.
L:  Yes, exactly.
R:  Yeah, see I'm down with West Africa, I know that sort of stuff.
L:  Oh really?  Have you been there?  No.
R:  Not even once, but I know Cote d'Ivoire is the Ivory Coast.
L:  Oh, okay.  That's, you know, not -- no -- not a lot of people know that.
R:  I mean, that's kind of impressive, right?
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  You gonna give me my props for that? [LAUGH]
L:  Good job, good job.
R:  Hold up, wait, hold up --
L:  So how about you?
R:  -- wait, where in New York are you from, 'cause I was born in New York?
L:  Oh really?  I was born in White Plains.
R:  Where's that?
L:  White Plains, um, Ox- like, um -- where White Plains is, like upstate, about like thirty minutes from the city.
R:  Oh, this girl in this room says she was born near there too.  I was actually born in Long Island.
L:  Oh, no.  I was born -- 
R:  So I mean, we're not really close.
L:  No.  Um, White Plains, that's like, um, Westchester County, I think it is.  I think that's what it's called.  Like the county.  But I don't know.  Anyways, how about you?  Where are you?
R:  I was actually -- I was born in, ah, Nassau County in Massapequa on Long Island --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but I mean, you probably don't know that, 'cause you're in White Plains.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  Give me -- here girl, tell me a funny story about yourself, 'cause I'm not really feeling this whole government corporate thing.
L:  Yeah, this is definitely the worst question I've gotten.  How many of these things have you done? [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, well I have not done many of these, but I mean, this is kind of a dull question, wouldn't you agree?
L:  I would have to agree.  I mean, I -- I couldn't understand --
R:  I mean, other questions I could feel, other pressing questions --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I could feel, but this is kind of like, ah, corporate --
L:  Yeah, this is kinda like, ah --
R:  -- America, not feeling it.
L:  -- it's bad, okay.  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's bad, let's do something about it, that's about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sorry, I'm
