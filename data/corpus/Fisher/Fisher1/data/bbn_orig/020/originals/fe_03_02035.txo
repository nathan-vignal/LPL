L:  Hello.  My name's, ah, Alvida[?].  [PAUSE]
R:  Hi, my name is Susan.  [PAUSE]
L:  Well, ah, um, our topic is, ah, cold or hot weather.
R:  Right.
L:  I myself -- I like cold weather.  [PAUSE]
R:  [MN] Well, I, um, -- [MN] I like cold weather, but I live in a warm -- warm weather climate.  So, um, I guess I have to like the warm weather.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I live in Philadelphia, and we're supposed to have four seasons, but generally we're having one --  
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  -- because it's just cold, and if it's not cold we get a couple of days of warm weather and then it turns cold again.
R:  Mm.
L:  And it's been cold now, oh, my goodness -- we didn't really have a spring because the weather is so s- -- the weather is so up and down.
R:  Ahah.
L:  We're u- -- [MN] I myself -- I still have flannel sheets and a flannel, ah, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, pyjamas.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  Because that's how, ah, ah, the weather is just [MN] -- at Easter it was a little better, but generally our weather has been terrible here.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I live in Tampa, Florida --  
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I -- I pre- -- I -- I actually live down here for the winters because it's nice and warm yet it's not real cold.  [LIPSMACK] Um, I'm originally from Ohio --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, I could po- -- probably live in cold climate again, um, except I don't like the snow.  The cold weather I don't mind.  It's the snow I don't -- I don't do real well with.
L:  Well, see, --
R:  So ...
L:  -- I'm just the opposite.  I don't do well with hot whether.
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  Because hot weather and me just don't make it.
R:  Oh.
L:  I am miserable because I always feel you can always take off or put -- you can put on, but you can't take off.  You take off so much and you can't take off any more.
R:  Right, that's true.  That's true.  Well, ah, the, ah, weather down here for the last month or so has been, um, [MN] e- -- I mean, I've got my AC on already.
L:  Mm.
R:  It's up to about eighty five --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- degrees today and the humidity gets pretty bad.  [LIPSMACK] I don't, um, -- I don't do real well in the -- the real humid part of the summer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, as long as I have the AC in the house, the AC in the car and the AC where I work, I do pretty good in the hot weather.  But, um, [LIPSMACK] I actually do live down here for the winters because of, ah, the nice climate.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- we don't -- we don't get real, real cold weather, yet it gets cool enough where I can get into winter clothes.  But, um, yeah, I agree, the hot weather is, ah, -- you can only take off so +many clothes.
L:  Well, with me, now today -- yesterday I had on lightweight jeans, a lightweight top.  All right, it turned real chilly last night.  So I'm b- -- I was back into flannels.  Then I got up this morning.  Okay, I got on the lightweight pant, I got on a heav- -- I got on a sweat shirt.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  And I'm trying -- you try to adjust -- here you're trying to adjust your clothes all the time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause right now we ha- -- I have the -- everything just all mixed up because the weather's all mixed up. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, we're not doing that anymore down here.  [MN] That -- that usually happens with us in the winter time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, because you never know from one day to the next exactly how cold it's going to get [MN] because it could be cold one day and, um, [MN] be a little warmer the next day, um, [LIPSMACK] but, ah, -- anyway, as long as I've got the AC. [MN] 
L:  Well, see, with me I have the air conditioner and I have fans.  I have around --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- five or six fans.
R:  Ahah.
L:  So I will put -- I'll start off with fans, and then if we go into a heatwave which we get here, and we can have some real brutal heatwaves up here -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- then I'll just turn off the fans and I'll put on the air and I'll keep on the air conditioner like that.
R:  Oh, Pittsbur- -- or, um, -- y- you said you were from Pennsylvania? 
L:  No, I'm in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, well, I know when I lived in Ohio, um, I, ah, -- the summer months up there were like the summer is or like the Florida weather is here, um, because it -- it gets humid up there too, doesn't it? 
L:  Oh, please! 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's so humid.  It can get so humid because we can go into a heatwave.  I know one year we hit one hundred on Mother's Day and we kept straight through with ninety, a hundred, eight- -- and we didn't go under the nineties until September.
R:  See, that's something --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in Florida that we don't see too much of, is the hundred degrees.  You know, I think I have seen it as high as maybe ninety five.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But that is, um, -- that's so very seldom -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that, ah, -- you know, usually -- well, maybe the hottest or the real warm, um, temperatures will be up to -- up to ninety, eighty nine, ninety degrees --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, -- but a hundred degrees and high humidity, oh, my gosh.
L:  Oh, yeah, we -- we'll get that hundred +degrees and they say with the -- you know, the humidity, it's like a hundred and something here --  
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- you know, and [MN] it -- it will get so hot here that when you walk outside it seems like there's a haze --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- laying over the city. [MN] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I understand that.  I get that a lot down here in the s- -- in the summer time too.  But, um, I don't know.  I -- personally I don't know if I would -- I would trade it.  Like I said, if I could come back up north -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and live in a climate that was, um, -- actually, I think the climate that would be best for me is what they get in Hawaii.
L:  You know, that's what I was telling --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my neighbour no longer than yesterday.
R:  Ahah.
L:  I say if I was rich I would move to Hawaii.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because it's like seventy five there.  [LAUGH] 
R:  All year round.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  They don't get real cold out, and, you know, you never hear of -- [MN] like here in Florida we have our, um, hurricane season.
L:  Yeah, well, you know, I know a lot about Florida because I get on the Internet --  
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and there's this group of senior citizens.  We meet every morning and talk with each other.
R:  Ahah.
L:  And a lot of them -- ah, a lot of my roomies are in Jacksonville, Florida --  
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, and they'll -- they'll be telling me they're going to the pool, I'd be telling them I'm sitting up here in my flannel robe and flannel hat.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] Oh, gosh.  Have you ever visited Florida? 
L:  No.  I g- -- you know what -- why I never wanted to visit Florida: because I know a lot of people who were born and raised in Florida --  
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and they used to t- -- they used to talk about the flying roaches.  [LAUGH]
R:  The palmetto bugs.
L:  [LAUGH] We call them flying roaches.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, you know, they, um, -- they are the most prominent down here in the col- -- in the, um, hottest of the summer.
L:  Oh, boy.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and they live in the palm trees.
L:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, yeah, I -- I have, ah, -- I'm exposed to a lot of those.  But, you know, in the home itself, as long as you've got the windows closed and you've got the AC on, they really don't -- the palmettos don't bother you that much.
L:  Well, see, we --
R:  You get kind of used to them, I think, you know.
L:  Well, I'd never seen them until I moved up here, because we're -- I lived in -- I live in south Philadelphia.
R:  Ahah.
L:  And down south -- down south Philadelphia I had never seen a flying roach until I moved up further than south Philadelphia and I walked in the kitchen and I +saw -- [LAUGH]
R:  Really?  Up there?
L:  [COUGH] And I -- oh, yeah.  But we haven't had 'em recently, but one time -- they were very big -- they here wer- w- -- in fact this is the first place I met 'em, when I moved here.  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  And they fly here too.
R:  I thought they were most prominent in the tropical, um, -- tropical, ah, um, climates.
L:  [NOISE] Well, we get 'em up here.
R:  I'll be darned.
L:  Mm.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, see, I don't remember seeing those in Ohio at all.  Yeah, I was exposed to them when I got down here.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Mm, and I've been here about thirty years. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Mm.
L:  Oh, thirty years? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, see, I was, ah, born and raised right here in, um, [LIPSMACK] Philadelphia -- 
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- Pennsylvania.
R:  Ahah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, there's a guy that, um, I work with that has, ah, -- his mom lives in -- I think it's Philadelphia.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  [MN] And, ah, he was born and raised up there.  Actually, I was born and raised in, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Ohio and when I graduated from high school --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- back in nineteen seventy something, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I moved down --
