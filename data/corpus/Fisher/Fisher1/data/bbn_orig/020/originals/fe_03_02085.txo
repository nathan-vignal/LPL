L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm --
L:  My name's Dee.
R:  I'm Tom.
L:  Hi, Tom.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] This is really weird 'cause I'm watching TV.  I totally forgot, oh, I had my phone on.  I was like, oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, the topic is what outdoor activities?
R:  Yeah, I think that's what it says.
L:  I -- I'm hoping I don't lose you 'cause I was like, you know, running my battery down.
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Um [LAUGH], I don't like outdoor activities personally.  How 'bout you?
R:  Yeah, so do I. [LAUGH]
L:  Really?  I totally much prefer, like, air conditioning inside, you know.  Pretty much anything you can do inside, I'm there. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I have -- I have a lot of allergies so I'm -- I'm not gonna go outside and just be miserable.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I -- I used to have problems with that too --
L:  So --
R:  -- then I started taking ... medication [LAUGH] for it and I ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, it made it --
L:  Yeah, well.
R:  -- better so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Well, does that mean you still go outside and -- I mean -- I mean, it's not like I'm staying in my house all day but --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I know.
L:  You know, but I'm not crazy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about sports so I don't -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I'm not gonna go to [inaudible].  Are you a big sports guy?
R:  Mm, not really.  I like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to go -- I like to like go outside and go hiking and that, you know, out in the, like, in the woods and that sort of thing when I can.
L:  Yeah, that's nice.
R:  So --
L:  Well, it's pretty, it's nature, it's, you know ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Woodland creatures. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I like woodland creatures. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Sounds cool but --
L:  I mean, I like animals and stuff but I'm not crazy about bugs so, you know --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I may tend to be outside ... [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  So ... [LAUGH] I tend to stay ... I don't know, that's -- it's almost like city versus country.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  That kinda depends ... uh ...
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, what you're gonna be doing too.
L:  Of cour-
R:  So ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  And how hot it is. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Where I live it's very ho- -- it gets very hot outside.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... I personally ... well, most people stay indoors --
R:  [inaudible] Yeah.
L:  Or they drive out to like the beach areas and the mountains where it's cooler.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Other than that, you know ...
R:  As I know I -- I gotta have an air conditioner no ma- -- no matter what.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Really.  Are you like -- like me?  It's like go from the air condition -- no, go to the air conditioned car, go to the air conditioned work?
R:  Yeah, usually so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Well [LAUGH] I could totally understand that.
R:  And so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Although they say air conditioning is, you know, worse air than [LAUGH] -- you're breathing worse air than outside or something, you know, when it's a smoggy day?
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Like, oh well.
L:  -- nothing like smog.  Do you get a lot of smog where you are?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  I'm like -- I'm out in the Midwest so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  That -- that must be nice.
R:  So we don't have too much smo- -- we don't have too much smog here. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, we get -- we get a ton of smog in California.
R:  Oh, yeah? 
L:  Yeah.  Well, you know, our -- on and off.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then we pay so much for gas because it's supposed to stop -- you know, help some of the emissions.  Ha, ha, ha.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, if you -- they charge you more for gas you won't drive as much.  That there's ... [LAUGH]
L:  Well, [LAUGH] that's a fairly ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Is that -- is that what it's supposed to be or ...? [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, well, I don't know.  I mean, they -- they put all this stuff, you know, these additives in the gas and stuff --
R:  Oh, yeah, that's right, yeah.
L:  -- to keep it -- it's supposed to be keeping it cleaner --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- uh, so we pay it from -- for gas ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and ... [LIPSMACK] I don't know -- you know, I don't know if it actually works. [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, I don't know either 'cause --
L:  It could be a big lie, so ...
R:  The gas isn't too bad out here so --
L:  Yep, really?  What are you paying there?
R:  I -- I think today it went down to a dollar thirty nine.
L:  Whoa, gosh, I remember when I used to pay a dollar thirty nine.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  A long time ago [inaudible]?
L:  I just -- I just paid one ninety seven I think.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, and it was down because ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and this is with the cheap gas. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  This is not premium gas.  This would be the cheapest gas around.
R:  [LAUGH] Man.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  It's never gotten up that high here.
L:  It's never gotten up that high here either.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.
L:  So, I mean, it was -- it was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the highest I think I've paid was like two twenty ... two twenty something.  Like, two twenty three or something.
R:  Wow.
L:  And that was maybe three weeks ago or so.
R:  Gee.
L:  You know when everybody was saying all the gas was way high because of the war and everything so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  Well, here it was actually going down.
L:  Oh, man. [LAUGH]
R:  It was like when the war started the gas was, like, around -- like, well, I think it was like, when -- when -- you know, when they first bombed Baghdad?
L:  Yeah.
R:  The gas went up to a dollar sixty nine.
L:  Ooh.
R:  It went up like ten cents in like a couple of hours.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then, uh, and then from there on, it's been like fully going down. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, hey --
R:  I cannot figure out. [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know -- it's act- -- yeah, really.
R:  I couldn't figure out what they were talking about when they were saying gas prices were going up so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it kind of spiked like out here too, or you know, when we first started bombing things it went up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it has been going down 'cause like I said, I just paid like one ninety -- I don't know, ninety seven or ninety six, something like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, but still, you know what?  It's never going to [inaudible].
R:  Oh, man.
L:  I wonder what that -- oh, that must be the recording thing.  That must be, um ... you know, it's never going to go back down to what it was before --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because now they go, "Oh, look, they're willing to pay it so --"
R:  They're all willing to pay that much, yeah, so why ... [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, so we'll just leave it at this price now. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  So ...
R:  And make as much money as we can. [LAUGH] 
L:  I know, really.  Clearly, if you -- you know, that would be a pretty good outdoor activity if you owned a gas station. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, actually. [LAUGH]
L:  How hard is it to sit in a little --
R:  Sit in a little booth and, uh, take money? [LAUGH]
L:  I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, actually now there's -- okay, 'cause you're in the little booth, does that actually count as a indoor activity? [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  A lot of 'em -- a lot of 'em are pretty much still off now, you know.  
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  They got a lot of [inaudible] quiets around there and ...
L:  Really?
R:  I been to some, you know, where they have the -- the draw ...
L:  Oh, yeah, where you --
R:  -- with the handle on it.  They --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- push the drawer out, you put the money in and they bring --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it back in and ... [LAUGH]
L:  That's it.  That's like no contact at all ever.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Like, the bank.  Some of those banks are like that now.
R:  Yeah.  Well, we got a --
L:  But, uh, I don't know.
R:  We got one gas station out here where, uh, they don't -- they don't even have people attending it, you know.
L:  Not at all?  Nobody?
R:  No.
L:  Not even like in case you have a problem?
R:  No, not that I've seen.
L:  Wow.
R:  They got a bunch of cameras around, you know --
L:  Oh, man.
R:  It's kinda like, ha- -- has a dollar changer machine, takes up to twenties in it and ...
L:  And that's it?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Totally automated?
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  That would worry me though.
R:  -- and they still charge just as much for gas.
L:  Oh.
R:  Even though they're not even paying somebody to be a cashier there [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Yeah, to watch out if you have a problem or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You would think that, you know -- I would worry -- so, it's like if you go there and the change machine doesn't work, you have to get that much gas, period. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  All I have is a ten.  Oh, my God! [LAUGH]
R:  I think they got like a ph- -- a phone number you can call and you know ... [LAUGH]
L:  Like anybody's gonna stay there and wait for someone to like get up and get dressed and come on down. [LAUGH]
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I don't think so. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, at least with some people at our gas station, not that they come --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- outta their little booths, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're like, " Oh, yeah, that --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- one's broken.  Could you put this sign on it?" 
R:  Yeah, well, actually I think the one I -- that didn't have the people at it went outta business.
L:  Oh, well, there you go.
R:  Like, maybe a month ago, so I mean, it's 'cause there's no people there. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I mean, well, if it was cheaper and there was no people, I would probably go there ...
R:  Yeah, well, that's the thing.
L:  -- but if it's the same price ... [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's the thing.  That was the thing towards the ... that's what I noticed about the last month they were there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was the same price as the gas station across the street so ... you know.
L:  Yeah, well, if you're, you know, might go --
R:  -- [LAUGH] I'd rather go there. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  If you -- you know, if you have a problem or something, I'd wanna go there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, other than hiking, is there any other outside stuff?  We're supposed to be talking about outside stuff, I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Any other outside stuff you like to do?
R:  I go fishing sometimes.
L:  Oh, fishing?  Gosh, I haven't been fishing in ages.
R:  Well, I don't have too many chances to do that though.  I'm usually busy working and stuff so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know what you mean.
R:  And something you gotta have -- you know, you gotta have a few hours to set aside to do.
L:  Really?  To just sit around?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And wait?  [LAUGH]
R:  And wait and ... and if you -- if you -- if you --
L:  Do you do like lake fishing?  Is it like you go --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to a lake in a boat or do you do like shore, you know, sit on the shore and fish?
R:  Oh, usually just sitting on the shore 'cause I don't have a boat so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Mm. [LAUGH] Yeah, me too.  Hard to fish in a boat if you don't have a boat. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well --
R:  You know, sometimes I'll rent a boat though and -- and go out.
L:  But you must do fishing like in a river.  I just think fishing in a lake too.  I mean, you'd have to cast out pretty far, right?
R:  Oh, yeah, you can ... it depends on what you're fishing for so ...
L:  I have a -- a -- oh, boy.
R:  A lot of fishing out near the shore anyway so ...
L:  Oh yeah?  Oh.
R:  Unless you want like to ... you know you're just going --
L:  Do they fish? [LAUGH]
R:  If you're just going for a really big fish then you have to go where the water's --
L:  Deep?
R:  -- deep but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But if you're just there to catch like -- like sometimes I'll take my daughter out, you know, and we just -- it doesn't matter how big it is as long as I can get --
L:  Right.
R:  -- her to catch something, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I know 'cause they're excited no matter what size, right?
R:  Yeah, yeah, exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  If it's a fish is --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But she -- well, once she catches a fish, do you guys actually take it home and like, you know, fry him up in a pan?
R:  No.
L:  You just let him go?
R:  Just let him go, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, that's nice.
R:  It's too much of a hassle to ... to fillet and stuff, you know?
L:  Oh, I know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I just -- just go for like a Denny's or something. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  It's already done there. [LAUGH]
R:  I go to a fish shop --
L:  And then the whole house smells ... I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You gotta -- yeah, that's way too much trouble. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I know. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that sounds really -- well, I'm -- I mean, [inaudible] you guys do any hunting out there too?  Or no?
R:  Well, I don't but, you know, I see a lot of people that do, you know?  Like --
L:  I have a friend that was down --
