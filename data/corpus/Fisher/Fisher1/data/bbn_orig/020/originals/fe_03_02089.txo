R:  A friend of mine had it and she told me about it and said -- ah, put me in as a reference for her.
L:  Okay, what co- -- is it from a college?
R:  Excuse me?
L:  I- is it from a college that you're working from?
R:  No, we work together.  We work for a security firm.
L:  No, no, I'm saying, like, the program.  Is it for a college?
R: Ah, yes, for Pennsylvania. 
L:  Oh, Univ- Penns- -- okay, likewise out here, okay.  So, we're supposed to talk about our friends, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, how -- what've ya got, like, a large group of friends or a small group, do you?
R:  Oh, excuse me now?
L:  Do you have like a large group of friends?
R:  Uh, nah, not really.  I've got like, uh ... it's a small group but they're -- they're kinda like church friends.
L:  Oh, okay.  That's nice.
R:  Yes, and, uh ... I really wanna meet friends.  He's -- he's a little bit older than me.  He's like about -- in -- about fifty something.  I'm forty seven.
L:  Okay.  I'm thirty eight.
R:  You're thirty eight?  Yeah.  He's -- he's, uh, really close.  I mean, I haven't been close to him the last couple of months because I've been working so much ...
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and, uh, we're getting back together now and getting back into church with him, and, uh, we used to play basketball together all the time.
L:  That's nice, yeah.  I have a small group of friends myself from college.
R:  [NOISE] Yes, ah, do you go to college?
L:  Yeah.  Once, at Temple.  Temple University.
R:  Uh, I went to Memphis State for one year.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yep and, uh --
L:  That's coo- --
R:  And then after that I got in the service.
L:  Uh, nice.
R:  And really the -- the good friends I grew up with, I had one really close friend, his name was Danny Curtis, and we were like brothers and, uh, I ha- -- I got in the service and lost contact with him ... and he's a kind of friend and I wish I could find again but I've had trouble finding him.
L:  Right, right.  He's the one that you grew up with?
R:  Yeah, we -- like, I say, we were like brothers.  
L:  Right.
R:  We hung out together, did everything together.
L:  Right.  I have tw- -- I have sort of like two groups of friends.  A bunch of guys I grew up with, went to parochial school with, and then, uh, the guys I hang out with at college.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Guys -- yeah, the guys that, like, I grew up with, they're -- they're more or less like a ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, like laborers, you know, like painters and stuff like that?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we get together and have a few beers and watch the sports games.
R:  Yeah, that's something --
L:  The other guys I don't see too often but I keep touch with 'em over the phone.  We get together and just like -- more family oriented stuff.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, I'm kinda like growing out of friends.  I've got -- like I said, I'm kind -- my job takes a lot of my time away so I don't have that much time to spend with anybody.
L:  What do you do?
R:  I'm a security guard.  I work a patrol, uh ...
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- in the, uh, city of Columbus, and I have about thir- -- twenty five buildings I have to go out and patrol.
L:  Right, right.  So, you're working at night a lot?
R:  Yeah, it keeps me going.  I work from four o'clock in the afternoon to like two o'clock in the morning.
L:  Pretty much when all your buddies are home.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  And in the daytime I'm sleeping. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, you can't beat that.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, I use- -- uh, one of my best friends lives in a place called -- a small town called Dallas, Pennsylvania.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, it's up by, like, the mountains and it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- pretty nice, yeah. [MN] It's up --
R:  Yeah, I went down to Pennsylvania one time.  It's called Airy[?], Pennsylvania, and like I said, I had a few friends there but, uh, not too many.
L:  Airy?
R:  Yep.
L:  Yeah, that's like up in the northwestern part?
R:  [MN] I was right in the middle of Airy.  It was like over close to the, uh ... close to the, uh -- the border.
L:  Okay.  Right.  So, you have a lot of like -- okay, so we're supposed to talk about fr- -- in your group of friends, do you have a lot of female friends?
R:  Nah, not really.  Not right now.  I'm kinda ... missing out on that. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  I have one -- I have one female friend to tell you the truth.  It's kinda tough -- it's kinda tough to have a g- -- just a female friend that you do not get involved with sexually, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have one female friend.  She works for the, uh ... children's hospital which is a matter of fact located right by the College of Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah, and I -- I ran into her.  She was from high school so we -- we sort of keep in touch.  She lives in Jersey and -- and she's a really nice girl.  Her name is Karen.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  She's -- yeah, she's got a daughter named Danika[?].  She's going through a divorce.  I -- that's one of the only, uh, pretty much female friend I have.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I got, like I say, I got maybe ... I got one female friend but she lives down in Florida and I haven't really talked to her in a while ... and she's got a --
L:  That's not --
R:  Excuse me?
L:  No, but you -- you got some friends from church.  That's pretty nice to hang out with.
R:  Yeah ... so ...
L:  You go often?
R:  Do I go what?
L:  Do you go to church often?
R:  Well, right now, like I said, since I've worked for this job, I haven't been doing much of anything.  It just takes all my time away.
L:  Sure, sure.  It's a price.  So, you have to go to work tonight?
R:  Yep.  I'm on -- going -- well, tonight's my early night.  I have to go in at seven o'clock so I work from seven to two tonight.
L:  Okay.
R:  And then, uh [SIGH] ...
L:  You -- you build -- you build a core of friends through the, uh, service?
R:  Yeah.  [several inaudible words] you talk about your friends and stuff kinda makes me think about the, uh, the times when I did have a set of friends where I spent a lot of time with.
L:  Right.
R:  And those are times I miss because right now I'm so lonely all I do is I work, I come home, I play video games, I watch TV.
L:  Right.
R:  And that ain't much of a life.
L:  Well, it's tough when you're working at night.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like tonight me and my buddies are probably gonna get together and watch the hockey games.  Hockey playoff.
R:  Oh, yeah, we got a team down here: Columbus Blue Jackets but they're, uh, pretty bad.
L:  Well, they're -- they're a first time team, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You gotta keep a league.  Well, Sophie[?] Flyers are playing pretty good so we got together the other night and, uh, we were really pissed off.  They got a two goal lead and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kinda tough when that happens.
R:  Right.
L:  My buddy up in Dallas, he's trying to get his son into hockey and, uh, that's pretty cool 'cause every time I go up there we watch a game and my buddy up in Dallas is like, "I don't -- I don't understand  how you guys down in Philadelphia love this game".  I said, "Dude, it's a great sport".
R:  Now, see, I, uh, I'm into hockey, the college hockey, 'cause our -- well, our state hockey team is really good.
L:  Okay.  You have a good time -- what -- what Iowa State?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you or your friends ever go to any of their games?
R:  I haven't yet.  I wanna go to a couple of 'em.
L:  Okay.  There was some pretty -- yeah, they was pretty good.  College games are great.
R:  Yeah.  I just thought of something too.  I do.  I have a few friends that go to Iowa State, I forgot about them.
L:  Right, right.  You --
R:  They -- yeah.
L:  Go ahead.  Go ahead, dude.
R:  Yeah?
L:  No, I was gonna say you have a couple of friends from Iowa State, huh?
R:  Yeah, they, um ... they always want me to go do things with them.  I keep, uh ... putting it off which is kinda stupid.  They invite me to their frat parties and ...
L:  Uh, you meet people there, man!
R:  Yeah, I need to. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, there are some wild parties there.  You'll meet all kinds of people there.
R:  Yeah, now after talking to you it makes me think, you know, I might give them a call today. [LAUGH]
L:  Now that -- how 'bout, you know, Memphis State?  Do you ever -- do you ever keep in touch with anyb- -- any friends down there?
R:  You know, no, 'cause I -- like I said, I'm forty seven.  I went to Memphis State when I was like nineteen, twenty.
L:  Sure, sure, sure, so they probably branched out, man?
R:  Yeah.  I been to so many different cities since that so I mean, jeez, I probably wouldn't find anybody from down there.
L:  Well, I tell you the truth, well -- you know, like, I -- I -- I'm finding comfort in having just one or couple -- couple a close friends, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Instead of having a whole group of people that you gotta hang out with and associate, 'cause some of the people I know around here, man ... I wouldn't even really wanna hang out with 'em too much.
R:  Well, that's what -- I got a few of my friends like that too.  One -- I went out with a couple of 'em one time and they're rowdy.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, we're driving down the road and they're cussing people out, walking down the road and I'm looking at 'em like, "Man, what are you messing with that guy for?  All he's doing is walking down the road".
L:  Yeah, you don't need that hassle.  Who puts you in situations where everyone gets in fucking trouble?
R:  Right, and then we're driving down and the car goes up too close, you know, and he don't like it, he'll start honking at 'em and cussing 'em out and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm like, since then, I never went out with them guys again.  I'm like, uh -- they said, "Well, why don't you go out and do something with us?"  I'm like, "Remember last time?" 
L:  Is that right?
R:  I said -- [inaudible] in that garbage, you know?  You don't ... you don't mess with people like that.
L:  No, no.  So, what -- what are your -- age your friends -- your age?  Your age range of buddies that you hang out with?
R:  Well, like I said, the ones that are college, they're only like nineteen or twenty.
L:  Okay.
R:  Which kinda surprised me 'cause me being forty seven ...
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, they're, ah, they're great too.
L:  Okay.
R:  There's three of 'em.  Well, I think one's -- one's twenty, one's nineteen, I think the other one's eighteen.
L:  Well, they must find something in you that -- that they might wanna hang out with, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's pretty cool, and you have a -- your older buddy from church, right?
R:  [MN] Well, the one guy, the older guy, he's older than me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I -- like I said, I -- we used to like bowling together all the time.  Recently I only talk to him on the phone.  He keeps trying to get me back to church.
L:  Right.
R:  And I keep, you know, making excuses.
L:  Right.  Any friends from work?  Like --
R:  No, uh --
L:  -- security guards at work you hang out with?
R:  I don't have any from work.  I don't really hang out with any of them 'cause they, uh ... I'm a perfectionist, you know.  I figure that I do my job so good and I wanna be the best --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- and the guys that are working with me don't meet to my -- well, I'm a supervisor.
L:  Okay.
R:  And they don't meet to my employer and I don't think they're doing a good job so --
L:  Nah, they take up space, huh?
R:  Yeah, and that gives them and me a little bit of distance [inaudible].
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  And, uh, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  They're better off that way, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Don't lower your standards, man.
R:  What now?
L:  I said don't lower your standards.
R:  Oh, I'm not.  I'm not gonna do that.
L:  You know?  That's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like -- that's like some of the people I hang out with, you know?  I was like -- the majority of the guys I grew up with, like, I get along really well.
R:  Right. [SIGH]
L:  But they never -- like, they hardly gra- -- some -- some didn't even graduate from high school.  It's kinda tough to talk with a good -- good conv- -- good level with them, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause it's all much -- pretty much they come home, they -- they get their pay checks and they're at the bar.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's pretty much one way conversations, man.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, my buddy from college I don't get a -- a chance to see too much but we have more -- more, uh, roundabout way of talking and a more universal conversation.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which is pretty good, man.  I thrive on that kinda stuff 'cause that -- that -- without that kinda shit, I don't wanna become stagnant, you know?
R:  Yep.
L:  So --
R:  Well, I would've died if I saw my friends from high school.  I mean, if I -- if I had the money I'd sort a detective out just to find 'em just so I could see what they're doing.
L:  Right, right, right.  There's organizations that do that kinda stuff I see.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  I've done a people search for them on the computer at times and, uh, nothing --
