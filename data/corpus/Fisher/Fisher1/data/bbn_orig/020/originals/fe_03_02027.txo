L:  Hi, my name is Jamie.
R:  Hello?  Hi, I'm Suzanne.
L:  Hi.  I should have said no --
R:  What a -- 
L:  -- 'cause I don't know nothing about it.  [LAUGH]
R:  What a topic, why couldn't we get something like the war in Iraq? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, or family?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, where are you from?
L:  Um, I'm from Illinois.
R:  Are you?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay, I'm in Minnesota.
L:  Okay.
R:  I kinda wondered what kind of time zone I was gonna get people from doing the late shift here. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Most, most I think, um, most of the time I'm getting them from the west coast.
R:  Are you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  At the late one?
L:  Um, yeah.
R:  Well that makes sense, 'cause they're, what, two hours earlier, or three?
L:  Yeah, two.  So --
R:  Okay.
L:  So yeah, I got nothing else to do at eleven anyway.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um--
L:  Well let's see.  I --
R:  I have one opinion.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm sorry, I did want mean to cut you out.
L:  No I wasn't, I wasn't even saying anything.
R:  Um, actually, it's kinda funny.  Um, are, are you by any chance one of the mystery shoppers?
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  Are you?  Are you on the lists at all?  Do you subscribe to Lila's Lounge?
L:  Um, I have visited there, but I don't subscribe, I don't get her, I don't get a newsletter.
R:  Okay.  Um, well, I just posted, um, something yesterday in fact, my son is doing a class project, he's in school for computer networking.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And one of his finals, he has to make a business application, and he's making me a, an access shopper database.  And so I, you know, posted it out there and asked for some feedback on it.  And, I've gotten a real good response back, he, you know, he wanted some input for his project and stuff.  And um, I got real good feedback from it, and I was talking to him about it, he's thinking about turning it into a shareware product, you know, a real reasonably priced shareware.  And this kind of ties in to the, the topic of the day because I, you know, I'm all of a sudden thinking okay, well if you're gonna put a product out there, you know you've got shareware, and you have to worry about the people who are gonna, you know, just take it and use it and not be honest about it, and I'm just going on and on and on.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I had to stop myself and say, "Wait a minute.  No, this is different group of people we're dealing with here.  We don't need to do this stuff".
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, they're, they're, they're honest business people, and, I caught myself thinking, and I, this is where it ties back into just corporate scandal and stuff, I caught myself thinking immediately that everybody is gonna just try to get something for nothing and screw the little guy, and, you know. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I guess, you know, even the huge companies are doing it, and it just startled me that I stopped myself in my tracks so quick thinking, 'cause normally I don't think that way.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  You know?  And, y- you know I guess that's a product of my environment.
L:  Well, it's, I think it's a part of everyone's environment.  It's a day to day, it's everyone.  I mean, you have to, well I would, I would say that for the majort- for the major part, that, um, people are good.  [LAUGH]
R:  I agree.  I agree.  
L:  But it, you know, the, the, the saying, you know, it takes one apple to spoil the whole bunch, is very true.
R:  Yeah.  And I guess, when you think about it, it's the small companies and the small businesses that are trying to be out there and be honest and make a living and, but the new is cluttered with all these --
L:  No, no, that isn't true. [LAUGH]
R:  You don't think so?
L:  No, the small business owner has to steal from himself just to make ends meet.
R:  [MN] Well that's true.  But, you know, given they have the opportunity to make an honest living- [MN] what I'm saying, what I meant to say is that --
L:  [LAUGH] They do have the opportunity, they just want to make more money, so they have to steal from themselves. [MN]
R:  That's true, but, I guess, the point I was trying to make is that, you know, you turn on T.V. and you hear about all the big major corporate scandals.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  That, you know, if it's starting at the top of the tree --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, getting to your point, then yeah, how can the bottom guy survive without doing it?
L:  It, you're exactly, it's uh, it's just uh- there's no way that you can't, you can't get around it because the, the larger corporate scandals, and ah, you know the money laundering and all of this, is, is um, causing everybody else's pocketbooks to get tight, because they're taking more than, you know what I mean, the money's not getting back into circulation, the, you know, the wealth isn't being shared at all.
R:  Exactly, but yet it's being passed on to the consumers and the, the buyers and the, the share holders --
L:  Right, right.
R:  And you know, it, it's getting passed on to everybody, even in government.  I mean it just makes me sick --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that you know, governments, you expect them to, I don't care what country it is, or if they're, you know, democratic or what they are, you expect them to operate.  If a government can't operate at a particular standard, who the hell can?  Who the hell cares?  You know? 
L:  Right, right.  I know. 
R:  I mean, we gotta get it from somewhere, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's too bad.  I grew up in a self-employed family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And my father taught me from a very young age, you know, honest, hard working, um, you know, be good to your customers and they come back.  Well, he's sixty six and he wants to retire, and he's so God damn broke he can't get out of business.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's because he has spent his life being honest, and yet he's got buddies that are just crooks, and they're making money head over heels.
L:  Right, right.  I know.
R:  And he gets very disgusted, he's thinking man, I could be on a cruise boat.  But then he goes, no, I don't wanna be that kinda businessman.
L:  Right.
R:  And, he's broke, you know.  He's actually living poverty level, and he can't even retire, because he, he can't make his house payment.
L:  Right.  
R:  It's --
L:  Well, I, I do believe that what goes around comes around and --
R:  So do I.
L:  You know and eventually, [SIGH] you know.
R:  You're just not gonna get rich doing it, but I think you're a heck of a lot happier --
L:  Right.  Well, but --
R:  -- personally.
L:  -- but on the same token, yeah, it's a, it's a trade off.  I mean, [MN] I would, I would see most of the people that are doing, are, you know are stealing from themselves or from their business that they work for, or whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, have, for the most part, a, a conscience, and that, they have to live with that on a day to day basis.  And the people that don't have a conscience, eventually comes back like it has.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know what I mean?  They're getting in trouble, they're, they're having to, you know, they're being prosecuted, and ah --
R:  Right.
L:  You know what I mean, in one way or another, I mean you know, it's happened, it's happened with, you know, the major corporations, they're getting, you know prosecuted, but they, even the small businesses owners, they're getting audited more, they're having to --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- you know, come up with stuff for the I.R.S. and, you know it's --
R:  It's, it's not above anybody.  
L:  No, it's not. 
R:  As far as getting caught and prosecuted.
L:  Right, right, and --
R:  But I would rather be poor and honest, I really would.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Than, like you said, the conscience, you know, and to live with that.  So what's a couple extra bucks gonna buy me when I have to know that I'm doing this?
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  To what, you know to buy an extra boat?  You know --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- and I have to live with this?
L:  Right, right.  When it's not a matter of trying to, ba- to basically meet the needs of your family, and when it, you know what I mean.
R:  Right.  
L:  To go over and beyond, to live the high life.  [LAUGH] But --
R:  Exactly.
L:  [MN] It's definitely not worth it.
R:  I, I think our, ah, business is unique.  Do you do this full-time, or is this just a side thing?
L:  It's just a side thing, I'm a stay at home mom, so ...
R:  Are you?  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I actually went from the corporate world, to um, stay at home mom now, and this is what I'm doing, so I've seen of seen both sides.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I'll, I'll take this one any day. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know, it's --
L:  We're, well, we're self-employed, we run, um, three restaurant slash bars, and ah, it, [MN] in, and so we know a lot of the local, you know, people in our area, and --
R:  Okay.
L:  I, we're from a small town, so we, like my, my uncle is the mayor, I have --
R:  Oh, whoa.
L:  -- you know relatives that are cops.  And you just, you know what I mean, you just [MN] see it.   There's favoritism, there's corruption and all, effects of government and, it's, it's everywhere.  It's absolutely everywhere.  And it's not even- in some situations it's not even looked upon, it's, you know what I mean?  It's, sometimes it's a matter of who you know, that's the whole, you know what I mean, that's how you get where you're at.
R:  That's the point, yeah. [MN] Unfortunately, it's become too mainstream in our society, like listen it's not even looked upon, it's just what you do.  And --
L:  Right, it's almost, it's getting to the point where it's almost, I mean in comparison to like a, you know, a family dynasty.  If you're not related, then you're not in. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  And it's begin, it's becoming accepted, and it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I think that's sad.
L:  It's becoming the standard.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it is really unfortunate.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because there's a lot of people that maybe could make some positive changes that will never have the opportunity to do so.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  And have a lot to offer people.
L:  Right, right.  And people that shouldn't be getting in there are.  Are.  I mean I don't know if you are aware of this, but ah, and I don't even know what your it was, but in some federal court, it was ruled legal that when registering to vote, you could use a park bench as your address.  I mean if you're homeless, you can, if you don't live in a house, you can say --
R:  Really?
L:  Right.  It is legal to register the vote that way.
R:  Really?
L:  Mhm.  And I don't know if that came about, you know, exactly what brought that about, but it was, it had, my first, my first thought when I heard about that was that um, they maybe did that when, you know when like the mafia was bringing, you know drunks in to vote and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- re-vote and stuff to get the people they wanted elected.
L:  But um, a federal court ruled on that.
R:  Well, I guess the way I think about it initially when you said that is, in America, it is our constitutional right to be able to vote.  So, are they gonna tell us if we don't have a home, we can't vote?
L:  Right.  Right, right.
R:  You know, so it's somebody's, you know, lame brain, lame brain, let's just reach for the stars on this one and make it so ridiculous, just to prove that we're being constitutional.
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Right.  But I mean, I was just kind of like hm, you know what I mean?
R:  That is odd.
L:  I think you need to list, um, like a, [MN] somewhere that you can be, I mean really, I mean are you, I, I guess if you're really able to be contacted at that park bench on a regular basis, then I suppose it is your house.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But you know, it would seem you know a little more, ah, appropriate maybe to list a, a homeless shelter, or a --
R:  Exa-
