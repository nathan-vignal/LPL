L:  Hello? 
R:  Hi. 
L:  Hi.
R:  How you doing? 
L:  I'm fine.
R:  Good.
L:  Ah, wow.  Ah, outdoor [NOISE].  Was it outdoor?  Was it outdoor? 
R:  Yeah, I guess it was outdoor, indoor.  You sort of -- I think we're supposed to introduce ourselves before.  I'm Curtis Schneider. 
L:  All right.  I'm Abraham.
R:  Abraham, nice to meet you.
L:  Yeah.  How you're doing? 
R:  That's good.  Um, so you like -- you say you like outdoor better than indoor?
L:  Oh, well -- no, I was just trying to think the outdoor, indoor, cold and hot [NOISE] and favorite, right? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, mm, I like outdoor activities, it's just that when you got a lot going on it's kind of hard to get out there [NOISE] and, you know, and do what you like to do.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, it takes --
L:  And it ends up being more convenient to stay inside, so ... [NOISE] 
R:  Just being inside and stuff, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But I would say I like outdoor best, but [NOISE] --
R:  But it's just a -- a matter of, like, getting out and doing it actually.
L:  Yeah, hav- -- finding the time to get out there and doing.
R:  Yeah.  That makes sense.  That's cool.
L:  Yeah.  And then, of course, when it's cold I'm sure everybody prefers to be inside.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And when it's hot everybody wants to get out, so ...
R:  Whi- which do you like better, the -- the cold or the hot?
L:  Um, I'd go with hot probably.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I still have a thing for -- I still do cold, too, because I used to play football.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  At school, so I -- I like, you know, -- I -- I -- I'm used to playing in the cold, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, but I definit- -- I probably prefer hot to running on the track and, you know, --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- getting out there playing basketball, that kind of thing.
R:  Yeah, doing all that kind of stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's cool.  Yeah, I played football too in Texas and -- and -- it -- it didn't get too cold when we were out there playing it but -- but it was good.  Um, I hated it when it was -- playing football when it's hot, though.
L:  Oh.
R:  Just 'cause it's -- I mean, like the dog days of August and what not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You're just, like, two dazed and stuff.
L:  Oh, God, yeah.  I forgot about that.
R:  Yeah.  But, I -- I mean, it's one of the things you don't ever -- you always remember the games, the -- the -- the nights that -- the games and stuff, but yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I'd probably have to say that I like, ah, outside sport -- ah, outside, you know, activities too, but, um, it's like you said that you have to make a lot more effort to -- to go outside and to --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- actually start the activity and get it going and then, you know, winding up and stuff.  So ...
L:  Exactly.  It's easier to, ah, warm up when it's hot too. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, it -- it's not as critical to -- to, you know, stretch your muscles and everything and that. 
R:  Yeah, that you won't -- you don't have as much chance of -- of tearing a muscle or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or something like that, that's true.
L:  So, that's a good thing, especially because a lot of people don't even think to stretch before they do activities and everything, so when it's warm outside it's like a real chance for them to hurt themselves.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  So, I guess that's bad too.
R:  Yeah, that is, that's -- that's wicked.  Now, did you grow up, um, where it was warm or -- or --
L:  I -- I grew up at, um, mid Atlantic.  I'm from the Maryland DC area.
R:  Okay.
L:  So ... 
R:  So you had pretty -- pretty cold winters then and stuff, so? 
L:  Yeah.  Like, cold winters, hot summers, nothing really, um, not in tropical or anything like February [NOISE] or nothing like that. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, ah, --
R:  That's good.  Now, when you do do act- -- inside activity what kind of inside things do you like to do? 
L:  Inside?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] [NOISE]  Um, getting in, like, a little fitness centre or whatever.
R:  Ahah.
L:  [NOISE] That type of thing.  Um, other than that I don't really do too many -- too many of the indoor things.  I don't -- I can't every really think.  I mean, do they just mean indoor athletic activities [NOISE] or [inaudible]?
R:  It's sort of -- I don't -- I don't know.  I think just kind of any -- any type that you like.  Usually when I think of an activity indoors it's usually like lifting weights or -- or, ah, or like playing racket ball or something, but I don't play racket ball too much, I just -- I lift weights quite a bit but, yeah, that's about the only inside activity.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, that I really do.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, unless you're talking about picking up your Play Station control, I don't really do too much else [NOISE] activity.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, I guess -- yeah, I don't -- I guess, yeah, I guess you could call video games an -- an indoor activity, 'cause, ah, but, yeah, or like computer games or surfing on the net or something.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, well, in that case I -- I -- I do that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  But, ah, --
R:  What kind of -- what kind of video games do you like?  Do you like that -- like X Box, Play Station Two or ...? 
L:  Yeah.  Well, I've -- my brother has a X Box and I haven't played it too many times, I only play it when I go over there.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But, um, I have a Play Station and I play that whenever I can.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When I can find time. [NOISE]  It -- it's -- it gets weird because there will be weeks -- there'll be a week where I -- I can play every day and then there'll be a week where I forget I have one because I have no such work to do, you know.
R:  So much, yeah.
L:  So ... 
R:  It's just kind of a matter of how much time you can allot to it and stuff.
L:  Exactly.
R:  That's cool.
L:  But I'm about to graduate, so I'm going to have as much time to do whatever I wanted to this summer. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Where are you graduating from?
L:  Temple University.
R:  Temple University.  Where -- where is that?
L:  Philadelphia.
R:  Philadelphia, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's cool.  Yeah, I'm, ah, -- I got one more year before I graduate.
L:  Undergrad? 
R:  Yeah, undergraduate.  
L:  Oh, right.
R:  And then I'm planning on going outside the country for, um, a year or so to study a foreign language.
L:  Mhm.  Where at?
R:  Um, I'll be graduating from Brigham University but I'm going to go to Paraguay --
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  And continue studying in -- in Wannanie[?], um, -- 
L:  Nice.
R:  Which is an indigenous language to South America that I learned.
L:  Oh, really?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you've been learning that?
R:  Yeah, I've been learning it -- I've lived in Paraguay for two years, um, --
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, about five years or so ago. 
L:  Okay.
R:  And, ah, picked it up there but I just want to kind of perfect it.  
L:  Nice.
R:  Take it up to, like, the masters level and stuff.
L:  That's goo- -- that's cool, that's [inaudible]. 
R:  And so, I mean, that's one of the main -- like another activity that I do indoors is -- is reading.  I like to read a lot.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Um, and it's -- usually I have a lot of reading to do for classes but I don't like doing that kind of reading.  I like doing --
L:  Exactly.
R:  I like doing the stuff that I want to do and it's just like I never get the real stuff done.
L:  Exactly.  I know exactly what you mean. [NOISE]
R:  But -- or it's either that or, like you were saying, you know, you want to go out and -- and throw a football around or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Play catch and -- or, ah, you know, go hit a few baseballs.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Do something like that.  That's --
L:  That reminds me, now you make me feel like going to one of those, ah, mini golf batting cages type place. 
R:  Oh, yeah, those batting cages.  Those are nice.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I haven't -- I haven't been to that for a long time just because it's -- it's like you say, when you go outside it's a big hassle 'cause you've got to -- plus you've got to pay for that and it's just, you know, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It could be not as easy as -- as going, just like running a few, ah, laps around a track or -- or a couple of miles or something.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  That doesn't cost anything.
L:  Man, you've got me motivated.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I haven't been out to the gym or anything like that forever. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah?   
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Yeah, it's been a while since I went -- I -- I actually just got back a couple of hours ago, I was doing some bench press and stuff.  Um, I was --
L:  I -- I wish I had somebody to motivate me and go with me and -- that's -- that's my problem.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You need someone to -- to push me.
R:  You know, it's one thing that I've -- that I've noticed though, is if you have someone to go with you and go outside and do an activity it's a -- it's a lot easier to do it.  Um, just because, you know, yeah, -- I mean, you know how it is? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  If you go out by yourself you are just, you know, like, alone, nobody likes to be alone.
L:  You're not going to push yourself either.
R:  Yeah, you can't push yourself and [NOISE] you have ask someone else to come spot you or pull the weight off your chest, or ... 
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  And that's just not -- that's not cool.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  But, ah, but, yeah, and then plus you -- when you have a friend you just BS about stuff while you're --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- while you're lifting and stuff, that's pretty cool.
L:  Yeah, like, "I don't need to do that last set".
R:  What's that? 
L:  I said, like, you'd be like, "I don't need to do that last set".
R:  Yeah, like, "That last set, oh, it's overrated", you know what I'm saying? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, I need to -- yeah, I need somebody to push me in there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  In fact, I've been thinking about coming -- I need to get somebody to get me in there right now.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um, yeah, definitely.  Wait, so you're in Utah now? 
R:  Yeah, I'm in Utah.
L:  Wow.
R:  It's -- it's -- it's, ah, it's pretty -- I mean, they get pretty cold winters, it's pretty up high, it's about six thousand feet up.  Um, --
L:  Oh.  Oh, I didn't know it was that high.
R:  Yeah, it's, ah, -- well, it's up in the Rocky Mountains.  The town that I'm in in Provo is -- yeah, it's about six thousand feet or so.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, yeah, about sixty seven hundred I think, if I don't -- if I remember it right.
L:  Why did you decide to go there?
R:  What's that? 
L:  Why did you decide to go there? 
R:  Um, just 'cause, um, church affiliation.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And, yeah, and I -- I -- my -- I had a sister up here and a brother that's going up here, too.
L:  Okay.
R:  And some cousins but, yeah, and --
L:  I -- I mean, I kind of figured but I wasn't sure.  Like, you know, [NOISE] maybe some people go there for --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- for --
R:  Yeah, there is a few people here that aren't but it's -- it's kind of the exception really than the rule.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I thought about other schools but I'm, um, studying linguistics and they've got one of the biggest undergraduate linguistics programs.
L:  Mm.
R:  And so it's good for -- for what I'm studying.  Like, if I were studying something else like, ah, um, medicine or, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, something that's not their strong point then I'd go, maybe University of Texas or something.
L:  Okay.
R:  Because they've got a good medicine program or just -- or pretty much anywhere that's got a good one.
L:  Yeah.  Mm.
R:  But, ah, yeah, I'm going to go somewhere else and do my masters just 'cause, ah, masters program here is not as strong as their undergraduate program is.  [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  So ... 
L:  I -- I think that's the case with most schools.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Well, at least from what I've noticed.  I don't know, there's so many schools out there.  [inaudible]
R:  Yeah, there's a lot.  Um, why did you choose Temple then? 
L:  Um, I -- I -- I think one of the --
