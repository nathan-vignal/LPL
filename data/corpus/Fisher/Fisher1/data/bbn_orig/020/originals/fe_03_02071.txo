L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My name's --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- Jennifer.
L:  Mm, Petra.
R:  Hi.
L:  Okay, how are you?
R:  Fine.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is actually a good topic 'cause I just finished running in the [inaudible].
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um ... so, then you like warmer?
L:  Definitely warm weather outdoors.  Uh [LAUGH] ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  With I -- I ski though so that's a lot of fun but I don't think it compares to, like, the outdoor warm weather sports ... at all.
R:  Right.
L:  Oh, even -- not even limited to sports, but outdoor activities.
R:  Right.
L:  Jet skiing, parasailing, all that other stuff.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How 'bout yourself?
R:  Um, well, I'm from Florida --
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  -- I, um, I like ... warm weather a lot, even though there's something very nice about how [LIPSMACK] like when it first starts to get cold --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and snow and stuff?
L:  Right.
R:  I really like, like, those --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like that first month.
L: Yeah. 
R:  And, um ... 'cause I live up in, uh, Pennsylvania now so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- it's definitely ... a lot, um, gets a lot colder than Florida.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, do you do any type of, uh, winter outdoor activities?
R:  Um, not really.
L:  Okay.
R: My friends made me ice skate this year.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] But that was about it ... as far as cold weather.  Warm weather, um ... [LIPSMACK] I play tennis.
L:  Okay.
R:  And basketball.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And, uh ...
L:  Do you like basketball better indoors or outdoors on the court?
R:  Oh, outdoors.
L:  Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.
R:  Definitely. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, okay, so ... I mean, I feel like almost ... ooh, I shouldn't say almost everyone, but I think a large chunk of people would say outdoor activities --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in warm weather activities. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Except for like I guess the hardcore skiers or snowboarders or that type.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But do you do any type a indoor activities on the regular?
R:  Um, I don't [LIPSMACK] ... I don't think so.
L:  No?  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm mm.
L:  'Cause, um, well, with track we do indoor and outdoor track.
R:  Right.
L:  And it's a clear preference for outdoor track.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Clear preference.  Almost like most of the team so ... just, I don't know ... indoors you kinda like same stale air [LAUGH] ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, outdoors it's open ... air circulates, brighter.  It's like real light as opposed to fake light [LAUGH] so ...
R:  Yeah.  Like, even with swimming, like, when there's an indoor pool ...
L:  Right, right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, definitely.  Hands down, I know outdoor is for me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Definitely.  Um, I think maybe if I was more -- if I wasn't, uh, so scared of the cold ... I'm originally from Montreal which sounds ridiculous because it's cold. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But if I wasn't so scared of the cold, I'd go skiing much more often.  But, um ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's a lot of fun, but I don't know if the weather part of it ... [LAUGH]. I'd much rather just enjoy the sun, the heat and whatever activity I'm doing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I'm actually going to Montreal this summer.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  For the first time.
L:  It's nice. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah?
L:  It's clean.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's the thing I get from most people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's clean so -- and there's a lot of stuff to do.
R:  Right.
L:  A lot of stuff to do.
R:  Cool.
L:  How long're you gonna go for?
R:  Um, I think like total a eight days --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- or nine days, yeah.
L:  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah, it's definitely -- and it's a co- it's real compact so like a lot of the stuff you're gonna wanna do is in the vicinity probably of where you will stay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If you're staying in a hotel, like, downtown --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you'll get, like, access to everything you wanna do.  You don't need a car.  You'll be fine.
R:  Good.
L:  So, that's what -- I mean, if you have a car, that's a perk but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not like a mandatory type of thing.  Like, I heard LA, like, you need a car, and Montreal's just not like that so ...
R:  Yeah, in Atlanta you need a car.
L:  Oh, heard that too.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And our, uh, public transport systems are great so ...
R:  Cool.
L:  Yeah.  Is this your first, uh, study like this?
R:  Um, no, they had a question -- well, this is the first time I'm doing this --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- because my friend gave me the number because she's majoring in socio linguistics --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- so she just likes to talk about it all the time.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] And, um ... but this is my second call.
L:  Okay, okay.  This is my third.
R:  Yeah, on this thing.
L:  Okay.  So ...
R:  Last time they were talking about, um, sports.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, uh, how we feel about the striking.
L:  Right, right, right.  I got Middle East -- situation in the Middle East and I got foreign politics: were there any threats to the US and ...
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah!  I don't know [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Got some heavy ones! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah [LAUGH], I got like sports and ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You got like current affairs, that sucks. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  [LAUGH] Yeah.  [LAUGH] But, um, I'm trying to think if I do any -- I used ice skate.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, but that was like back in elementary school so [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that was kinda a while ago.  I mean, that was fun too but ... I don't know.  The cold thing and, no.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  Cold and indoor together to me is like [LAUGH] ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't see that as being too mm ...  Did you ever ice skate?
R:  See, when my friends took me this winter, there's this, um, place called Pens Landing.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, um, there's like a ice rink around there in the winter.
L:  Okay.
R:  And it's right off of the water so it was, I don't know ... just seemed -- I don't -- I didn't like it. [LAUGH]
L:  You didn't like it too much?  Is that -- was that your first time skating?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  It's weird.  I feel like, when you're really good --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's fun.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ... unless you're like a really little kid then you'll be -- you'll have fun no matter what.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um ... it hurts your ankles if you don't, um ... have proper, like, form and whatnot --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so after a few hours or after like an hour and a bit, if you're like, um ... not the best of -- best skater, it will -- you'll feel it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  And I don't -- I don't feel that it's right to wear like huge razors ...
L:  Oh! [LAUGH]
R:  -- on your feet either. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right, right, right.  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know, that combination, me and huge razors would not have worked out.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] If I had done this like ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- too many times. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  I feel like everything like that's, uh, the winter version I can find like something summery that matches up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, like, ice skating or roller skating?  I prefer roller skating. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ... see now, if we come down to ... skiing, it's like I guess you can put water skiing.  Uh, they're two totally different things though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I don't know if you'd really wanna match that up, but like yeah, basketball indoors --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- versu- versus basketball outdoors, definitely outdoors.  I can't imagine playing soccer indoors.
R:  No.
L:  So, I don't know.  I feel like ... the outdoor type summer thing works really well.  It's a nice combo.
R:  Yeah.  I bet most people say that.
L:  Yeah, I -- I would suspect ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's the case actually.  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Any other activities you're fond of or like to do?
R:  Um, not really.  I grew up playing tennis 'cause my grandpa owned a tennis court.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, tennis like camp for school --
L:  Are you any good? [LAUGH]
R:  Um , I'm pretty good.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um ... but -- and that's about it.  I mean, I play basketball, like, if people are getting together --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and playing basketball.  Not --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you know ...
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- not professionally or anything.  Um ...
L:  Do you swim for fun at all?
R:  Well, um ... it was hard not to swim in Florida.
L:  True. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  But, um, there's not really a lot of clean pools around here --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- unless you, like, live in a fancy sky rise or something.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And, uh --
L:  Don't wanna jump in a dirty one.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I, um ... don't really swim up here.
L:  Okay.
R:  When I go down to see my parents and stuff, you know, they live on a lake so --
L:  Oh, that's beautiful.
R:  -- I go out there.  Yeah.
L:  Excellent, excellent.  Mm, interesting.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Um ...
L:  Mm mm mm ...
R:  But, yeah, this -- that's about it.  I used to, um ... like, um, skate and skateboard and stuff --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- when I was small. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  But now I'm old and my bones are weak and ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] No more skateboarding.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, okay, okay.  Um --
R:  Um ...
L:  -- my brother actually just, uh, he's always skied but now he's a snowboarder a little bit more --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, yeah, he really enjoys that.  I would ha- I wonder what he'd say on that.  I know, I think he'd think outdoor and ... warm weather sports would definitely be [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- better of the two, uh ... better to have that matrix type of, uh, options I think he would so --
R:  My brother too.  He just turned seventeen and he --
L:  Okay.
R: -- and he's, uh, he's really into skateboarding -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and like extreme biking --
L:  Oh, interesting.  Okay.
R:  -- and stuff so, um ... [LIPSMACK] Yeah, he'd probably say --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- outdoor, warm too, especially since he's still back in Florida.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Uh --
L:  Yeah, definitely.  I love Florida.  I went to South Beach, um, a few times --
R:  Uh-huh
L:  -- and, uh, like it a lot actually.  I haven't gone to, like, other areas that are not, um, probably ... a much different environment than south beach so --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, I have yet to see the -- have the full experience --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of south Florida.
R:  I grew up about twenty minutes away from Tampa, so right over --
L:  Okay, okay.  Tampa, is that in the middle?
R:  No, Tampa's right on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, okay.
R:  Like on that side --
L:  Orlando's really up north?
R:  Orlando's kinda in the middle in up north, yeah, like more central I guess ...
L:  Oh, okay, okay. 
R:  -- than Tampa.
L:  Okay, all right.  I see.  Mm, Tampa.  I have a few friends from there actually.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, so you're definitely gonna say warm weather? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Definitely gonna say warm weather type outdoor sports.  And surprisingly, being from Montreal, the huge like hockey type thing, I never really -- well --
