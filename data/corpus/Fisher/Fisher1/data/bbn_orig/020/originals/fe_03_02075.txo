You know, you don't have to be miserable with the bugs and the ... you know.  I don't imagine you all have the kind of bug problems we have down here though, do you?
R:  Uh, not yet, but, you know, when we get hotter it will, but ...

[LAUGH]

R:  Yeah.  I've -- I've -- born and raised here and I've had it with the -- the six months of ...
L:  It's --
R:  -- like you said, all is you need is like this past one.  Like I said, it was the worst in a long t- --
L:  Yeah, didn't y'all -- didn't y'all just have a bad snow storm about two weeks ago or so?
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

L:  Oh, I can't imagine.  Yeah, y'all have to have oil pumped through your house, right?
R:  Yeah, [inaudible].
L:  It didn't just come out of the ground or --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- from the street.
R:  And you know, you gotta -- you're at the mercy of a guy with a plow and ...
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know, and whenever he can get here and then the --
L:  And whatever he wants to charge.
R:  Whatever he -- well, it's -- sometimes it's worth it --
L:  Yeah.

L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, they do their parking lots and their church -- the big ones and their malls first, the big bucks --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and then they come and get you in the afternoon and ... [SIGH] ah, just, uh -- I -- I -- I don't know what it would be like, ah, a year or you know, you gotta have a closet full or the change of clothes, seasonal clothes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and there's nothing to do in the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- winter.  What do you do in the winter?  I mean, you know you -- y- -- there's nothing -- I'm not a skier.  I don't know -- like --
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  So, I just [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah, yeah, I'm much -- kinda guy and that's -- I guess that's why I enjoy it down here so much 'cause, you know, we get to camp nearly year round.  I mean, yeah, it gets, you know, pretty dang cold in the winter, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  We see freezing days and stuff but, you know, noth- what y'all have up in -- yeah, um ... [MN].  This t- -- this time of year is my favorite time of year because I like it, you know, between sixty and eighty and San Diego, if you do -- I mean, if you move to California, San Diego area's a beautiful area and that's about the weather mo- you know, I would say eighty percent of the year is like between sixty and eighty.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, if you get up in the morning you need a jacket and by, you know, midday you're, you know, hot and ready to, you know, hit the beach.  [LAUGH] You know, but ...
R:  Yeah, I just -- too many and it seemed like we had so many either Friday snowstorms or Monday so you're -- you got those three days locked in the house and you can't move and, uh, and y- y- you know, you're ready to go crazy, you know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  There's three days of everybody on top of each other --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's too cold and th- the dog still needs to go out and wants to play and wants his walk, and you still gotta get to the grocery store occasionally or whatever and you gotta go out in the sleet and, uh!  I've just had it.  But that's part of life.  What are you gonna do?
L:  [inaudible].  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] You know, but I like to do the camping and be able to do that kinda stuff.
L:  Well, you ain't too far from Maine, are you?
R:  Uh, four or five hours.
L:  Oh, rea- well, see, we -- last -- last time the scouts and us went camping, we drove, uh, five hours to -- down south to Austin, Texas, but you know, shoot.  I can do it, you can do it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But Maine -- Maine.  If I moved anywhere up north, it'd be Maine or Washington State.  I mean, it just -- you know.  Main door of either state to me just from pictures and the words that I've read and stuff, it's just gorgeous area, you know, and -- and the bugs are not as bad, you know, 'cause down here, man, shoot, they walk up, tell you to push you down and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and then start sucking on you.  They'll sneak up [LAUGH] to you.
R:  You got the, uh -- you take the kids fishing tomorrow and everything?
L:  Uh, we went today.  We had a guy come out and, uh, they all earn- earned their, uh, fishing patch.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, fishing belt loop and then, uh, tomorrow -- tomorrow we're packing up and going home, you know.  It's just, uh, Friday night, Saturday night and then Sunday morning kinda thing.  But yeah, we'll probably get some more fishing in the morning.  It -- it --
R:  Is it -- do -- do they still sit around a campfire at night and that kinda --
L:  Yeah.  That -- that's what we're doing right now [LAUGH].  I just got through telling two ghost stories.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, the- some of the other parents were putting on skits and stuff and, yeah, we're having a great time.  I mean ... you know, as long as the kids behavior's well, I have fun and ... I think they have a little bit more fun, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  And it -- it's great.  I mean, right now I'm in, you know, just tee shirt, middle of the night and it's just absolut- as comfortable as you could possibly be.
R:  I hate you. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, now wh- wh- what will you do next weekend?
L:  Uh, nothing next weekend.  Next campout is middle of August and ...
R:  And, so, I mean, you would just, you know, work around the house or whatever?
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I gotta big yard and a garden, flowerbeds and stuff so, yeah.  We've already got flowers coming up everywhere.
R:  And that's -- that's what I like, a nine month project.  You've k- how many --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You mow the lawn nine tim- nine months out of the year?
L:  [inaudible]
R:  I think you're breaking up.
L:  Yeah, well, I -- I mow -- I got winter grass that comes up so ...
R:  Winter grass?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What's that?
L:  Like winter rye, so it stays green all year.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, it doesn't grow, you know, real fast and if we do get a hard, hard freeze like three or four days in a row, you know, it'll kill it and then, you know, it's lost from there but, yeah, I can have green yard all year dang near.
R:  And you'd have to mow most of the year?
L:  N- -- um ... about ten months, ten months.
R:  We-
L:  There -- there's, you know, Jan- uh, December, January, you know, it kinda quits growing.  It just -- it stays green but it quits growing so --
R:  But you could -- you could wash your car nine, ten months of the year?
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  It's not that bad?
L:  We do this one ... yeah.  Well ... uh, we had this -- this summer it was really mi- I mean, this winter it was -- [PAUSE] [NOISE] except for those two [inaudible] -- abusing me ... six times, you know, overnight freeze.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, it w- it wasn't bad this year at all.  Last year was pretty bad.  We had a coupla -- a coupla -- four, five, you know, days of freezing but no I don't ... I mean, [COUGH] we had a coupla days this winter where it was sixty degrees or more, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I -- I -- I --
L:  And that's January, you know?  I mean, I think in January we reached like almost eighty degrees a coupla times.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  In January?
L:  In Januar- in January, yeah.
R:  Ah, I could kill you.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  I could kill you.
L:  Th- that -- that's when we started planting our grass and stuff and our tulip bulbs and stuff like that.  Then they start coming up.  Then we have this, uh, uh ... winter freeze just before y'all got, you know, y'alls last mad one --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, it -- it's killed all my bulbs but, you know, all the other grasses and shrubs and stuff like that, because I don't like flowers much.  My wife's more the flower person.  So, but yeah, summer's -- summer's my time a year.  I mean, I -- I -- I can't get too hot but I can get too cold.
R:  Yeah, that -- exactly.
L:  Like last -- last night we weren't prepared last night.  We paid the price.  I mean, we froze to death last night.  It got to about fifty five and we're sleeping in tents so ... [LIPSMACK] that's pretty cold [LAUGH] outside.
R:  Fifty five -- I would die for fifty five.  
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I'd give -- I'd give a finger for it.
L:  Really?
R:  A limb.  Yeah, that's nice.  And what's the high -- what's your highs in the summer?
L:  Uh, so far ... well, I think we hit, uh, ninety already.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think we've hit ninety.
R:  Already?
L:  Yeah, already, yeah.
R:  And I think seventy tomorrow's gonna --
