L:  Hello?
R:  Uh, yes, hello. 
L:  Hi, my name is Ruth.
R:  Hi, Ruth.  Uh, I'm Deeanne.
L:  Hi.
R:  And I'm in Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, I'm in New York.
R:  New York?  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, um [LIPSMACK] ...
L:  Uh --
R:  -- outdoor activities.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] What do you enjoy the most?
L:  Uh, outdoor if --
R:  Or [inaudible] --
L:  -- it's definitely summertime as opposed to -- uh, I like the warmer weather more than, uh, the cold weather.
R:  I do as well.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And we've had a tough time of it this winter, haven't we? [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, yes, definitely.  It's been a very hard winter.  My husband's -- he and the children enjoy skiing but I prefer to stay home when they go.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that -- that's got its benefits.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, it -- you're right, it -- it sure does.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But for the most part I tend to be outdoors.  Um, spring and summertime is what I enjoy.
L:  Right.  We like hiking.
R:  Okay.  Do you, um, hike in the area or do you guys drive to hike or ...?
L:  Um [SIGH] right now we've been mostly staying in the area 'cause the kids are -- are still pretty young.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, the extra drive is ... too much. [LAUGH]
R:  That's -- that's wonderful.  Do you, um -- I mean, have you done it since they were little?
L:  Yeah, it's really neat because, um, this is the first summer that, uh ... we have, uh, our youngest will be three next month.
R:  Okay.
L:  And he's already doing hikes.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, which is really neat.
R:  Did you do the big backpacks before that?
L:  We did.  We did.
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  And -- and this was already the second time.  We went last weekend and, uh, and it was the second time already that he did a -- I mean, when I say a full hike, a full hike for us, you know, we're out for an hour walking, you know, and, you know, bumpy, you know ... terrain --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and, you know, on a real hiking trail --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and he does it.  It's amazing.
R:  Oh, that's wonderful.
L:  It's really very cool.  And our other two, you know, are following the markers, you know and -- and, uh --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and it's -- it's really very neat.
R:  Okay, that's great.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  We, um, we have four and my youngest is actually just turned four.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, um, we do -- our children are very close in age so we do actually a lot of bike riding.
L:  We haven't gotten into that yet.  I want them to, um, but, um, uh, they're -- they're actually turning -- uh, Gabby, I'm on the phone.  I'm on the phone.  Um, they're turning seven and nine and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- we haven't gotten into that yet.
R:  Oh, we have -- we have close ages of our children.  I -- mine are, uh, four, five, seven and eight.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But we've always had this big cart that you attach to the back of the bikes.
L:  My sister gave me hers and I'm hoping this summer -- I'm hoping this summer to, uh, do it.  The funny thing is is she gave it to me and she lives across country and -- and she gave it to me all folded up and I can't figure out how to ... open it up.  [LAUGH]
R:  Ooh, yeah.  You probably have to put all the wheels on and everything.
L:  Yeah and --
R:  Yeah, that'll take you some time to figure it out.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, 'cause I'm usually pretty good at those things and I -- and I didn't have a clue.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  It might take you a little time.
L:  Yeah, to figure out.
R:  We -- we started doing that just when the kids were little and we'd go on vacation.  We'd have to get two carts because --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- none of them could really bike safely by themselves.
L:  Right.
R:  And then we got to where we were down to one cart and one in a baby seat.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  And one on her own bike.  And now we're down to two on their own bikes and two in a cart.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, slowly we're working out of all this but, um, we -- we love to do that.  We actually had the cart flip over on us one time.
L:  Ooh.
R:  The children were fine but my husband took a corner pretty quickly ...
L:  Right.
R:  -- just having a good time with them and sure enough, they just toppled right over. 
L:  Were they wearing helmets or not really?
R:  Uh, actually they weren't.  I hate to say that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  [inaudible].
R:  They weren't, but they were -- they -- thank -- thank goodness they were fine.
L:  Right.
R:  So, yeah, we did not put the helmets on the ones in the carts, but we're learned.  The older kids have always done the helmets but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  They, um -- yeah, we -- we -- we need to be always better about putting on the ones in the cart as well.
L:  Our two older ones just gotten into roller blading.
R:  Oh, yes.  Have you ever done it?
L:  I haven't really done that much.  Um --
R:  I have never done it.  My husband loves it.
L:  Oh, really?  My husband wants --
R:  Yes, he --
L:  -- is thinking about getting into it, and in fact I've got, um, nephews that are much, much older --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, uh, and we just asked my sister if they've got any old ones hanging around.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we figure me and my husband'll try.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  My son started, um, roller blade hockey.
L:  That's what my son would want to do.  How old is --
R:  Yes, to introduce him to -- to, uh, ice hockey.  They said, you know, "Get him going on the roller blades and see whether -- if he likes it and then move along to the skates".
L:  Yeah, no, it's -- it's very -- it's really -- I'm just not sure my ankles could take it for too long.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's funny.  I do -- I notice, well, when I watch the boys out there skating, you see the girls out there too, their ankles really do turn.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah, I can -- and I'm always worried about his ankle and I'm always saying, "Okay, we gotta strap these tighter to give you more support around your ankle".
L:  Right, right.
R:  So ...
L:  No, I definitely -- I definitely, uh ... my -- my ankles creak as it is.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Yeah, I -- I'd stick to the walking. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know.  We'll be walkers.  We'll be walkers.
R:  Get into the biking.
L:  Yeah, and the biking is fine too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but, uh ... uh, may- maybe the roller blading'll be more of what they do in -- like, with -- with you and the skiing. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly, yeah.  You sit back and watch that one. [LAUGH] But I'm so glad spring is here.  We, um ...
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- have a national park near us and we can go biking in there and just wa- I mean, I just enjoy walking in general too so ...
L:  Right.
R:  -- we do that and go on little picnics and [LIPSMACK] kinda do that at the national park so --
L:  Yeah, yeah, we like parks.  Our last vacation we took, my husband and I, before we had kids, we -- we went out west and -- and we did, like, Grand Canyon and, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, what was the other one?  Zion and, uh, we did a third one too --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I can't even remember, and we just hiked them all.   It was so nice.
R:  Okay.  You do love the outdoors then. 
L:  Yeah, but then we ended up at -- at Camelback Inn in Arizona with -- with massages and ... [LAUGH]
R:  Did you really?
L:  Yeah, it was a really nice vacation. [LAUGH]
R:  Ooh, that's wonderful.  What a treat.
L:  That was very cool and that was the last vacation [LAUGH] before kids.
R:  I was just gonna say, that was before the kids! [LAUGH]
L:  That's it.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  It's -- it's not like that anymore.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  But, um --
R:  What other outdoor things do I enjoy?
L:  I know.  Uh, no we -- we -- we really do do a lot outside.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um ... our backyard relative to some other backyards around here is a little bit bigger and it's nice 'cause we -- we've become the backyard that all the kids come and hang which --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- is really nice.
R:  Yes, okay.
L:  I like [inaudible] too.
R:  You like that?
L:  Yeah, I do.
R:  Okay, good.
L:  I like that a lot.  It's very nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My husband, last summer, every time he would come home he wouldn't know who would be in our backyard.
R:  Right, right.  What kids? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well, that's good they're in your backyard.
L:  You know, it is.  It really is.  It's actually -- it's funny 'cause a lot of them are my youngest's age.
R:  Oh, the littler ones?
L:  Um, yeah, which is interesting and -- and -- but it's okay 'cause that way my eldest -- my older two, you know, you know, still hanging whatever and it's -- it's kinda nice 'cause this way they can be with me in their own environment and the other ones, you know, are coming hanging out.  The mothers talk.  It's nice.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  It works out very well.
R:  Do they do any, like, outdoor things?  Like soccer or ...?
L:  Yeah, actually, uh, they're doing baseball now.
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  Sunday mornings they play baseball.
R:  I've got one in -- one in t ball so ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and soccer.
L:  Yeah, no, they definitely -- they both like ... [LIPSMACK] baseball which is nice.
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh, which is really nice.  In fact I was thinking this summer there's -- actually there's a park near us that, um [LIPSMACK] ha- through Queen's Col- through one of the local colleges --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- has, um, a nature camp.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  That sounds cool.
R:  Really?
L:  So, yeah, I'm gonna see --
R:  Just for the -- for the -- for your older kids?
L:  Yeah, for my older kids.  They do like the -- in these two week spurts and you can, you know, do 'em throughout the summer.
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh, I might see if I can talk them into it.
R:  Mm, we love to do just nature walks.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the kids, uh, get their sketchbooks out.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  And we'll go on a nature walk and we'll just kinda see what we come about and, you know, they'll watch a tree start to bloom and then take another walk in a couple a days and they'll notice that, oh, it's getting, you know, some more buds or it's turning colors a little bit or --
L:  Oh, that's neat.
R:  They'll sketch it kind of and watch it develop.
L:  That's very cute.
R:  So, you guys, you might enjoy even doing that on some of your hiking.
L:  That is cute.
R:  Well, you know, I -- like --
L:  Es- especially my daughter.
R:  Well, I guess you're not gonna wanna pack, uh, colored pencils and sketchbooks. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, my daughter might actually get a kick out of that.  She's a little bit of a drawer.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, my son, not so much. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, yeah.  Maybe a little bit more girly. 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But yeah.
L:  He, uh, he's definitely more the sports and that kinda thing.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, he'll do any sport.
R:  Okay.
L:  It was raining here today.  [inaudible] and he was out on the roller blades and they were playing hockey on the sidewalk. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  The two of them.
R:  Yeah, it was a really rainy day but they -- they did not cancel our outdoor soccer.
L:  Ooh.
R:  They didn't cancel our t ball.
L:  Ooh.
R:  We had just been so rainy for outdoor things that I guess they were just -- everything's been cancelled so I guess they felt like we're just gonna get this one in. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow, that's interesting.
R:  So ...
L:  That must've been fun for you! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] The kids were excited so that -- that made it -- that made it okay.
L:  Right.  Just okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, just -- yeah, just okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you -- do you do any gardening or anything outside?
L:  No, I don't really --
R:  Okay.
L:  I actually tried to plant some flowers this year and I -- I don't even think that worked. [LAUGH]
R:  Ooh! [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I --
R:  I've been trying something new planting wise every year.
L:  Oh.
R:  So that each year I'm learning a little bit more about -- about something.
L:  That's cool.
R:  So, I'm -- but I'm -- I'm -- I'm getting a -- a small array of things that I can grow.
L:  That's neat.
R:  So, yeah.  I mean, we started just with some flowers and we did bulbs one year and, uh, we did mint.  We grew mint last year and did a lot of mint tea and ...
L:  Right.
R:  You can't kill mint! [LAUGH]
L:  Funny, I bought seeds.  I bought parsley seeds and I bought, uh ...
R:  Oh, good.
L:  -- dill and I haven't done it yet.  I'm thinking of doing 'em in pots and having 'em indoors even.
R:  Yeah, start 'em inside.
L:  Yeah, and see if that gets me anywhere.
R:  Okay.
L:  But I haven't -- haven't had a chance to do it with the holidays and everything.  It's been a little ... little --
