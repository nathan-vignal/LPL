L:  Hello.  My name is Valerie.
R:  Hello.  My name is Jan.
L:  Hi, Jan.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  This topic is not too exciting. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I don't even really understand what it is we're talking about. [LAUGH]
L:  It's supposed to be something about the -- I guess like the Enron scandal and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] It didn't affect me at all because I don't have any stock.
R:  It didn't affect me at all and I just read about it in the paper and watched it on TV and shook my head.
L:  Yeah.  I, uh, well -- 
R:  I mean I just knew -- you know, I -- I mean I don't suspect that the people working in those companies are very, [SIGH] um, above board.  I think that there's a lot of -- they give a lot of tips or, what do they call it, the underground trading. 
L:  Insider trading.
R:  Yeah.  I mean --
L:  I don't think that anybody, you know, gets to that point by being honest. [MN]
R:  I don't, yeah.
L:  You know, I don't think anybody would get that job by playing by the rules.
R:  I -- yeah.  I d- -- I mean I don't trust them and I think now -- I mean it's nothing different going on, it's just with all the technology they can catch it quicker.
L:  Aha.
R:  They can -- they can monitor their -- their computer activity and stuff, they know what they're doing.
L:  Well, what I don't -- the one thing that I do know about that I don't like is that a lot of people's, um, retirement plans were tied up in investments made into those companies.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then, when they went bankrupt, the people have no retirement, a lot of them had to go back to work, but the crooks got to keep a lot of their money.
R:  But you know the stock market to me, it's nothing more than a gambling boat without the music and the lights.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the people don't seem -- they -- they feel like it's, uh, something of character and above board where really it is a crap ship just as much -- I mean it is [MN] -- it -- there -- there is no such thing as a sure -- a sure thing stock.
L:  No, well, I think they just wear a suit and tie and it's just -- 
R:  Yeah, you got it.
L:  -- like any other kind of scam that's going.
R:  You got it and it's greed.  These people that boo hoo because they lost all their money, what was the motivator?  It was greed.
L:  Right.
R:  It was greed.  I can't feel sorry for somebody who, you know, they -- they'll have these profiles of these fifty year old women who, you know, maybe they've, like, save- -- they've managed to save like a hundred thousand dollars to their retirement plan and then they put it all on some, you know, sure thing, quote unquote. 
L:  Right, but what I was talking about, like I work for the, you know, the federal government -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and a lot of people, like I work a voluntary service, so we have like a lot of retired people that re- -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, that volunteer.  Well, they work for companies, they're getting money taken out for a retirement plan.  They don't know how it's being invested, you know -- 
R:  Oh, don't they get a -- I mean they don't get a choice of how.
L:  No, you know.  A lot of people it's just in- -- you know, they don't know.  All they know is they are getting X amount of dollars taken out for retirement, for a pension plan.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then this one man, uh, he's like seventy five years old, so he was going to start increasing his hours and doing more volunteer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, here the -- the -- he had retired, the thing went bust, the man had to go back to work.
R:  Yeah.  I mean -- 
L:  And he didn't invest it.  It was, you know, the company or his union invested their f- -- their funds that way.
R:  Yeah.  I mean it -- it's like -- there's -- there's so many -- so much crookedness and I mean [SIGH] it's just -- [MN] well, it -- it's a -- it's a joke, because if they -- if they had of put them all in the prisons, they wouldn't be able to -- they would have to clear out the prisons -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to f- -- to -- they'd have to let the ones that are in there out -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- to put them in.
L:  And what disgusts me is it's like their crime is different than, you know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the av- -- you know, street crime.
R:  Oh, huh.
L:  You know, they get to go to, uh -- 
R:  Club Z.
L:  Yeah, Club Z in Allentown, Pennsylvania or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then, like that guy -- what was his name?  I forget.  Michael something.  He was involved in --
R:  Yeah, the stock, yeah.
L:  -- insider trading years ago.
R:  Yep.
L:  And now he had -- he had prostate cancer or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now he's out writing books and cook books -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and he's a wonderful person.
R:  It is like, I mean, the -- the white collar criminal is -- is not any -- I mean it's like it doesn't matter if they're embezzling money from the company or whatever, [MN] there is no shame attached to it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  A kid who robs the local candy store has more stigma than some guy with a suit and tie.
L:  Exactly, and the kid might have been robbing because he's starving.
R:  Yeah, but it's like -- I mean, they're going to be tougher on -- on him -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they got -- you know, it's -- it's just [MN] -- 
L:  It's a double standard.
R:  Well, you know, here where we -- I live in Cincinnati, we're close to Kentucky where they had this -- this guy, this Erpenbeck builder scandal.  I don't know if you ever -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if it -- if it hit the national papers.  It was a guy who was a builder and he didn't pay the people he was, you know, getting his wo- -- his -- the construction stuff done with, but what he would do is, like, once a year he would take them all on a cruise -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which [MN] -- which virtually cost him nothing, because when you think about it -- 
L:  He wrote it off.
R:  -- well, he -- yep, and he's not paying them anyway.  I mean, he's not paying his suppliers but he's saying -- 
L:  Get out.
R:  Well, you know, he's say- -- he's putting them off but he's saying he's going to invite them on this free cruise.
L:  And they would go on the cruise rather than get paid.
R:  Well, yeah.  Well, they are going on the cruise and they are thinking, "Okay", you know, "We just have to wait for the money". 

L:  Mhm. 
R:  So, you know, you can buy a cruise ticket for two hundred and fifty bucks.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's the money they're going to spend once they get on there, but, you know, he was just doing this and people didn't want to speak up to get their money because then they won't be invited on the trip.
L:  Oh.
R:  But then somebody spoke up and even they -- well, he owed, like -- he owed them like fifty thousand dollars so they filed suit.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Then the house of cards started falling down -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- because, once one does it, then the other.  He ran from Cincinnati to Florida.  Now, his wife's selling real estate.  He came back here, pled indig- +indigence like he had no money -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to try to get a court appointed lawyer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now it's continued until some time this summer.  It's like this is never gonna -- yeah, that Marvin Warner, same thing.  He went to Florida.  They all go to Florida for some reason.  They, um, you know they leave, um, leave Cincinnati and hit Florida after.
L:  Mm.
R:  They -- [several inaudible words] taxes or something.
L:  Well, my husband, I -- I'm divorced from him -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but he was working here -- I live in Philly -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he was working for this place, for Nelson's Bakery.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, they had like all the contracts with the school and everything, right.  They were like the top commercial bakery in the city.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So one day they went to work -- well, what happened, this one guy, his wife had a baby and they found out their health insurance wasn't being paid.
R:  Ugh.
L:  Then they went to go to work one day and the place was padlocked.  That was it.
R:  I -- I had that happen at a -- a place I worked for.
L:  Did you?
R:  Yeah.  But the thing was, before that we saw -- um, it was -- we were doing interviews out in the field and this kid that I was working with, I mean he was kind of, like, [MN] he would get alarmed at stuff and one day we went back to get some more clip boards and he said, "Oh, look, look.  They look like they're the Feds" and I'm like, "Come on, Chris", you know. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  So he's, "No, look at them, look at their suits, look at the -- look at their car" and I'm like, no, he -- he's just pulling -- he is either pulling my leg or he's, you know.  He goes, "I want to hear what they're saying" so he's trying to hang around.  Well, basically they were from the Federal Government and they were telling these folks who -- they had withheld our money -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- hadn't paid our taxes and, see, when you send in to find out if your social security and stuff has been withheld and paid -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you get this thing from last year, you don't get the one from this year.
L:  Right, the current year.
R:  Yeah, so here, you know, we didn't know of what was going on and by the time it happened -- by the time everything hit the fan, uh, it was like people that had pay cheques, the -- the bank account, there -- there was not enough money in the bank account --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- to cash them, they had conned a couple of us into -- they said, "If you -- will you hold your cheque until next week".
L:  Aha.
R:  And, yeah.  Now, if I ever worked for a place, God help 'em if they ever ask me to hold -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- a cheque one minute. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, what I was going to say happened with this bakery, like, my husband lost his job -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- and then they said, "Well, you know, you can get a job as a driver salesman.  Well, to be a driver salesman you had to put two thousand dollars up to be bonded.
R:  Uh-oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, he said, "No, I don't want that".
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, didn't the place -- didn't the guy open up under another name.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, they did all the time.
L:  And then my husband -- they wanted -- we had to pay back all the unemployment he got because -- 
R:  Ugh.
L:  -- they said that he had been offered a job -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as a driver salesman and he turned it down.
R:  Oh.  Well, this place, um, the only way that we would get our money or get anything was to file for the unemployment.  Well, when we went for the unemployment, the -- they asked us the reason we were applying, you know, the reason for applying.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I said, "Well, there's just something strange about me but I won't work for a place that can't pay me".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And the girl is sitting there looking at me and she goes, "Well, you can't refuse to work".  I said, "Well, is there any box there that you can check off, you can refuse to work if they're not paying you?"  I mean that is -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because, see, they were saying that they would -- they would pay us, but they just couldn't pay us then.
L:  Right.
R:  They wanted us to come to their house to pick up the -- the projects there. 
L:  Gee.
R:  And so -- so there we are up at the unemployment place and I'm going crazy, I'm -- I'm yelling, [LIPSMACK] "Well now, look --"
