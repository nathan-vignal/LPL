L:  Hello, my name is Sheila.
R:  Hi, my name is Alex.
L:  Alex?
R:  Yes.
L:  I'm in Chicago.  Where are you?
R:  Uh, excuse me?
L:  I'm in Chicago.  Where are you?
R:  Uh, I'm in Providence.  That is in Rhode Island.
L:  You're in Taiwan?
R:  No, no, in Providence.  This is in Rhode Island.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Same here.
R:  Yeah, so we have to discuss whether we like cold or, uh, hot weather.
L:  Water?
R:  Weather, weather.
L:  It's weather?  I thought they said cold weath- uh, water or warm water.  But I -- I prefer warm weather as opposed to cold weather.
R:  Yeah, me too, but it depends.  I don't prefer when it's -- I don't like it when it's so -- when it's so hot that you're constantly swelling and things like this.
L:  Well, I never complain no matter how hot it gets because I can always cool off, but I don't like the cold because I cannot always warm up.
R:  Yeah, so, uh, I have been in Chicago and I know that it's very cold in the winter there.
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  So, and how -- how is during the summer?
L:  The summer's hot.  It's -- it can get very hot here in the summer.  [SIGH]
R:  So, do you prefer to stay out when it's hot or to be ins-
L:  Yes, I do.  I -- I love the warm weather.  I love it.  I -- I don't like cold weather, I prefer warm weather and I do a lot of fishing and, uh, I picnic a lot and, um, I ... play softball and I just like outdoor sports.
R:  Oh, that's good.  And, um, I prefer hot w- uh, warm weather too.  I -- my favorite sport is skiing which has to be associated with cold weather.  So ... this is a little contradiction. [LAUGH]
L:  You said you -- you -- what sport do you like?
R:  Skiing.
L:  Oh, skiing.  Okay.  I've never skiied and I don't like, um, cold weather so I wouldn't be out in the cold, not to -- not as a sport.  But I know that -- I guess that can be exhilarating, huh?
R:  Uh, exc- uh, can you repeat this one because, uh --
L:  I said, I guess that can be exhilarating ... skiing in the cold.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, but if you like the sport that you are playing it could be a real fun and because while you are moving, you get hotter and hotter so --
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  Yes, you -- you stop noticing that it's so cold outside and you get warm inside.
L:  Oh, that makes sense.
R:  Yeah, so it's really nice.  And, uh, I -- and for the summer I prefer to be in the ocean and be in the -- to be swimming and things like this.
L:  Right.  [NOISE] To try to keep cool if at all possible?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I like fishing and I also like boating, sailing and swimming.
R:  Well, I like swimming too and also I prefer to play some like [inaudible] ball or things like this in the warm weather on outside.
L:  Okay.  And I play a little bit of tennis.
R:  Yeah, but I'm not very good at it.  Wh- where do you usually go for picnics in the warm weather?  Is it nearby Chicago area?
L:  Yeah, I, uh, go down to the beach to the lakefront or in -- in, um, the parks or [inaudible] preserves.
R:  Oh, and do you like climbing mountains when it's hot during the summer?
L:  I've never climbed a mountain.  Well, the only mountain I've ever climbed was, um, I went to Phoenix, Arizona, for Thanksgiving last year and I climb mountains in Arizona but that was the first time I ever done that.
R:  And did you like it?
L:  Yeah, I did.  I mean, I wasn't -- I didn't buy any special shoes or any gear or anything.  We just ... pulled over by the side of the road, next to a mountain and -- and went up to the top of it, a girlfriend and I ... went up to the top of it and sat up there for a couple of hours looking around, just sitting relaxing, and then came back down the mountain.
R:  Yeah, but it is a good experience because you feel you have risked so much energy and you're in the pure air.
L:  Right.
R:  That's how it is by nature.  Yeah, bec- originally I am from Bulgaria.  
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  Yeah, I'm -- have for many mountains there and during the summer I love being in the mountain and climbing, sitting among the trees ... when it's hot.
L:  How warm does it get in Bulgaria in the summer?
R:  Uh, well, it's bec- we have a different measurement system which is in Celsius, so I'm not quite used to the Fahrenheit, but it's about eighty or nine- no, I think, ninety degrees is okay.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, it's not so hot.
L:  How cold does it get?
R:  It's ... it depends.  Last, uh, winter it was ... I don't know really with that Fahrenheit, but it's -- it was below the freezing point.
L:  Okay.
R:  [inaudible] of twenty degrees.
L:  Okay.
R:  So ...
L:  How old are you?
R:  I'm twenty six.  How about you?
L:  I'm fifty one.
R:  Yes, so ... why shall we discuss about ... cold or ... weather?
L:  Whatever you choose.  I -- I was born in the winter so I -- I don't like the cold at all.  I prefer warm weather, hot weather all the time.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I was born in the winter too.  But I also prefer hot weather.  So ... and, uh, h- how -- yeah, I asked that question.  And do you like being outside when it's something like to stifling  [inaudible] when it's very much, uh ... [inaudible]?
L:  When it's very much what?
R:  When it's -- the humidity is too great to be --
L:  Oh, um, well, I don't complain.  I like it.  I -- I love the warm weather and I love heat so I -- it does not get too hot for me.
R:  Mhm, and -- well, the only thing that I dislike about the hot weather is that if you're outside or inside you're constantly swelling and, well, if you're working, you can't take showers every fifteen or twenty minutes --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, it's a little bit +displeasant for the people around you.
L:  And -- and that's true.
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- but the nice thing is that when it's hot outside you -- you, uh, don't feel the need to eat so much so it's a great possibility to lose some weight.
L:  Yes, definitely.  Definitely.  And I do get bigger in the winter because I'm not as active in the winter as I am in the summer.
R:  Yeah and in the winter you think I am -- I am at -- I might get sick so it's better that I eat more to keep me healthy.  Things like this.  And have you ever been to Alaska?
L:  No, I haven't.
R:  Well, I would like to see how it is over there but I suppose it will be too cold.
L:  Actually they say that it's not.  That the summers are like seventy, eighty degrees in the summer.
R:  Ooh.  So, it's not so bad then?
L:  Not in the summer.
R:  Yeah.  Then what about Canada where it's constantly cold?
L:  I -- I would not like to go there.
R:  Yeah.  And --
L:  I'd like to take an Alaskan cruise though.
R:  A- an Alaskan cruise?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh.
L:  I'd like to do that.  
R:  Yeah, and have you ever been a country that it's hotter, like some place when it's, uh, summer all the time?
L:  Uh, I've been to Belize ...
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I've also been to, um, St. Martin in Jamaica and the islands around there.
R:  And --
L:  Cancun[?]. 
R:  So, you liked it there?
L:  Yes.  Yes, 'cause it was hot.  It was warm.  I liked that.
R:  And, uh, have you ever considered options for moving and -- to live in place like this?
L:  I've considered moving to Belize.
R:  Mhm
L:  Um, I -- at least that was a thought about seven or eight years ago, I thought about moving to Belize, but I didn't.
R:  Right, yeah, because -- and how do you feel while during the winter in Chicago?
L:  It's po- uh, I don't like it.  I try to hibernate as much as possible ... during the winter.
R:  Yeah.  I was for Thanks- -- this last Thanksgiving in Chicago and it was snowing and it was so cold outside that ... just so unpleasant.
L:  Well, I wasn't here for Thanksgiving.  I was in Arizona where it -- and it was warm.  It was in fact, in Arizona in Thanksgiving, one Thanksgiving it was the warmest spot in the United States so I --
