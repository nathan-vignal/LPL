R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Karen.
L:  Hi, th- Sharon?
R:  Karen.
L:  Karen. This is Jim.
R:  Hi, I'm in Florida so, uh, I think I --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- like warm activities.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I'm in Arkansas so I like the warm stuff too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We just moved down here from Colorado 'cause ...
R:  You didn't like the cold.
L:  After -- uh, yeah. After thirty years of it. It's too big and too cold.
R:  And you didn't, uh, participate in the skiing and all that?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  Oh, yeah, I love to ski but that isn't that kinda pricey.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, yeah, skiing's fun. 
R:  Hm.
L:  But it's not worth staying there for. [LAUGH]
R:  No. [LAUGH] Right, and the shoveling the snow and all that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  No, I, um, I don't do that many activities down here but, um -- except for what I te- I teach physical education so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we -- we, um --
L:  So, you get plenty of activity in the day.
R:  I teach tennis and volleyball and, you know, whatever, uh, is going on and, um, so I participate in -- in some tennis and volleyball [LAUGH] basically --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and walking and bike -- riding my bike and all that.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I like to walk and hike and ... go fishing.  They get a lot of big lakes right around here but --
R:  Are you near the mountains?
L:  Yeah.  We're in the Ozark Mountains.
R:  Oh, so that's beautiful up there to go hiking.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, from the Colorado Mountains.
R:  Any mountain biking? 
L:  Uh, no, I don't do any mountain biking.  I got hit on my bicycle when I was little and [SIGH] that was enough for the bicycles. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I like to garden too [SIGH] and they got a real long growing season here.
R:  Yeah?
L:  As a matter of fact I just got done putting in my ... some new flowerbeds around the front of the house.
R:  Yeah, I used to have a garden, a pretty big garden, 'cause I've got two acres and, uh, um, I just -- I got out of it.  It was just a lot of work --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh, so -- so I put in [LAUGH] two big pots.  I put in some tomatoes and cucumbers and peppers and that's about as far as I'm gonna get this year.
L:  Yeah.  That's why I put in all raised beds ... in boxes and I don't have to worry about the weeds or none of that.  I can walk down between the rows without getting in the dirt and ... [SIGH]
R:  So, let's see, outdoor activities. 
L:  Outdo- mowing the yard.
R:  We both like the warm.
L:  I did -- I did the mowing the yard today too so --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- that was my --
R:  We love to mow the yard.
L:  -- out in my [LAUGH].  That was my outdoor activities for the day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Flowerbeds and ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Flowerbeds and mowing.
R:  Well, I was down in St. Petersburg today helping my, uh, husband's brother paint his house.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I was outdoor painting -- 
L:  That's always fun.
R:  -- painting a house.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, that -- it was nice though.  Breezy and it wasn't really all that hot.  It was a little humid but --
L:  Yeah, that's how it is.
R:  -- because we had rain last night.
L:  Yeah.  That's how it was here.  We'd had rain the last couple of days and then ... yesterday it was just cloudy all day and then today it was partly so -- and then we got real hot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Nice day for working outside.
R:  Yep.  But I haven't ridden my bike in a while but, uh, hopefully this summer I'll be able to get back on it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ride around a little more.
L:  Yep. 
R:  Let's see.  My husband --
L:  Now w-
R:  -- rides motorcycles.  [LAUGH] So, that's his outdoor activity.
L:  That's always fun.  Uh-huh.  Every time I think about getting one, though, I see a big smash up in the paper and think, "Nah!" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't think so, no. 
R:  Well, we thought about getting a trike but they're a little pricey for us right now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But they -- that would be nice to have.
L:  Yeah, those are pretty nice.  I bet you can ride quite a while on one of those.
R:  Mm.  Let's see.  We've got the oceans close by, although I don't swim very much.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But, uh ... I like to walk along the beach [COUGH] when we get near an ocean.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We're not really near -- I mean, we're fifteen miles from it but, uh ... uh, you know, it's -- we don't do down very often.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  But we do it as a sort of a vacation thing.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh-huh.
R:  We get out on a lake and -- and do a little fishing and, uh ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we have a lake pretty close.
L:  Oh, that's nice.  Yep.  Like to do the fishing and walking on the beach, that's nice.  Like to go out at night and listen to it. [SIGH]
R:  Do you have any lakes nearby?
L:  Yeah, we got a bunch of 'em.  Really big ones.  [LIPSMACK] They've got most of 'em.  You've got like seven hundred miles of shoreline or more so they're pretty big. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Have you been out on it yet?
L:  Oh, been up to 'em.  I don't have a boat yet so ...
R:  Oh.  That's the first thing to do when you come down so --
L:  Uh-huh, yep.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Try to get a boat for sure.
R:  Yep, gotta get a boat.  Or canoe.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I like canoeing.  I think we'll probably get a canoe.
R:  One of those paddle boats or something. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  Or start with a canoe anyway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That'll get me around enough.
R:  I used to have a place on the water and, uh, I couldn't -- couldn't handle keeping two places when my other husband died and -- and, uh ... he, uh -- the person that wanted the -- the cabin, uh, wanted our canoe.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, in order to sell the place, I had --
L:  Yep. [LAUGH]
R:  -- to get rid of the canoe so I haven't been able to get out in --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- out in the canoe.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, one lake up here, Bullsholls[?], I mean, not that many people really use it 'cause Branson's right across the border from us.  So, everybody goes up to that table rock lake.  But they just kinda make a big arch all the way around here so ...
R:  Oh, they don't just go over there to gamble, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no, you can't gamble in Branson.
R:  Oh.  Branson's the music place?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  I think there's a --
R:  I thought they had some, uh, casinos up there?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I think there's some in Tennessee.
R:  Hm.
L:  Or Oklahoma 'cause people do go somewhere.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm not sure exactly where but I think it's across the state line.
R:  Mm.
L: Maybe somewhere else in Missouri they got 'em.  But they don't have it in Branson.
R:  Well, let's see [LIPSMACK] I don't golf, although that's like the biggest thing around here.
L:  Uh-huh.  We just got done working out of the golf course, putting in some new [inaudible] but, yeah, I don't golf either.  [SIGH] I'd rather go to the driving range and just whack a bucket of balls and let somebody else chase 'em. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I've done it a couple of times but I just, uh, you know, it's just not in my ... in my budget for just going out and golfing so --
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It cost you ten thousand dollars to get any good at it.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean ... a pricey sport.
R:  Well, just for fun, but, uh ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we have golf courses like every mile. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Every -- every three to five miles is a golf course around here.
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, we don't have that many but ... they got quite a few.  Everywhere you go it seems like golf courses.
R:  They're the only place that'll ... keep land open so it's nice to have them --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so we can get the water.
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  You know, when it does rain in order to get water into the aqua firths[?] [LAUGH], if everyone wants to build up down here so much, you know ... we are going to be -- if we have another drought, we'll be in major problem.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, we need to have ...
L:  That's what's happening in Colorado right now.  I mean, they haven't been getting any rain hardly for the last three or four years.
R:  Got a lot of snow this year though, so that should help.
L:  Yeah, that should help a little bit.
R:  Yeah.  I never got into the winter sports ... uh, shoveling snow --
L:  No, too cold.
R:  -- was about as close to having maybe sledding a little bit when I was a kid.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We -- my parents forced me to have ice skating lessons so I did a little ice skating [LAUGH] but --
L:  Yeah.  I still like to ice skate.  That's a lot of fun.
R:  Yeah, I never -- but it gets pretty cold in Arkansas.  So, you have snow a little bit.
L:  Oh, yeah, it snows occasionally. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  They close the town down 'cause they really don't have much snow equipment.
R:  They close the town down? [LAUGH]
L:  A couple sanding trucks.  Oh, yeah.  They close all the schools and half the businesses and ...
R:  Gee.
L:  So, yeah, like three or four inches.  It doesn't even have to stick to the streets sometimes.
R:  Oh.  You still have to have boots and stuff and warmer clothes.  I got rid of all my warm clo- uh, all my cold -- cold stuff.  You know, heavy stuff.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I kept one jacket.  That was it.  [LAUGH]
R:  One jacket.  That's it.  That's all I've got is one heavy jacket [LAUGH] just in case.
L:  Yeah.  I brought a down jacket --
R:  [inaudible] like a windbreaker or something.
L:  Yep.
R:  Mm.  There's a lot of hunting around here.
L:  Yeah.  There's a lot of hunting around here too.
R:  My husband used to hunt but he doesn't really --
L:  There's a lot of poaching around here.  [LAUGH]
R:  A lot of poaching? 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  You get people shooting all the time around here.
R:  Yeah.  I was up in Tennessee one time driving around a mountain and, uh, a bear jumped over the hood.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  I mean, it w- it was a -- a midi- medium sized black bear.  It wasn't like a giant big one --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or a little one.  It was medium size -- and he just --
L:  That's a bear.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I mean, the mountain was straight up and he just sort of jumped right over the car [LAUGH] and I'm like, "Oh, my goodness"!  [LAUGH] Didn't even touch the car, you know?
L:  Uh-huh. That's pretty neat.  [SIGH]
R:  We have a lot of deer and turkey down here.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I don't know -- rattlesnakes.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's what it is here.
R:  They have a rattlesnake roundup every year in San Antonio.
L:  Oh, do they?
R:  San Antonio, Florida.  That's pretty close to us.
L:  Huh.
R:  So ... that's like a big deal.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, well, if snakes'll leave me alone, I'll leave them alone.
