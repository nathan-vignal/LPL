R:  Hi --
L:  [MN]  
R:  -- I'm Maggie.
L:  Hi, Maggie.
R:  Yes.
L:  Hi, my name's Sue.  How you doin'?
R:  I'm okay.  [LAUGH] It's like -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  This topic's [LAUGH] --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  
L:  Do you like outdoor activities. [MN] 
R:  Do you like outdoor activities, Sue?  [MN]
L:  Um, -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- in -- when it's warm I do.  I live in the north east, so it's cold in the winter, and I don't like outdoor activities in the cold.
R:  What do you in the warm? [MN] 
L:  Huh?
R:  What do you do when it's warm outside?
L:  [NOISE] Ah, we live ne- -- kinda close by to the beach, so I like to go to the beach a lot in the -- in the summer time.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Are you not on the Jersey Shore, are you?  [MN] 
L:  Where are you?
R:  Are you on the Jersey Shore, by any chance.
L:  No, I'm up in Rhode Island. 
R:  Ah, Rhode Island.  I've been to the Rhode Island shore.  I used to go to school up there. [MN]  
L:  Pardon me?
R:  I used to go to school up there.  I s- -- I've been to the Rhode Island beaches. 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  It was the Seek- -- [several inaudible words] Seekonk go -- if you cross the Massachusetts border, isn't there a beach up there?
L:  Yep, yeah, Seekonk is very -- next [MN] -- right, like, as close as you can get to Rhode Island.
R:  All the clam shacks.  That's what I like to do. 
L:  Yeah, yep, -- 
R:  Eat fri- -- 
L:  -- yep.
R:  -- eat fried clams in the warm weather. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, the seafood up here is good, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Where do you live at?
R:  I live in Philly now, but I used to live up, um, -- I used to go to school up in [inaudible], so ...
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [MN] 
L:  So what you do you -- what do you do down in Philadelphia for out- -- [MN] -- outdoor activities?
R:  Outdoor activities?  Um, I play s- --
L:  It's not +really one of my strong points. [LAUGH] 
R:  I like to go sledding, actually.
L:  Really? 
R:  When it -- yeah, that's the one thing -- I like the winter, actually, a lot.  Um, I like when it snows a lot.  We had a lot of snow this year, so ...  I like to go --
L:  You don't --
R:  -- sledding.  But I like the winter just 'cause of what I do indoors, um, -- 
L:  But you don't ski or anything like that?
R:  I used to ski, but then I hurt my back.
L:  Yes. 
R:  And I -- I don't -- I don't know.  I don't like skiing.  Skiing's too much trouble.  It's like you --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- gotta to carry the stuff out. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know; plus it's freezing out.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [MN] [NOISE] Yeah, I just generally like, ah, the mind set that the winter gets you into, you know, where you s- -- I like to read a lot too. [MN] I like just to be huddled up in my house drinking tea and hanging out, reading and watching movies and then --
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  -- going out for a walk in the snow. [MN]
L:  Yeah, that's what I like to do in the winter too, just -- I kind of hibernate in the winter.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I like the spring and the fall, actually, better, even more so than the summer.
R:  Yeah.  I don't actually like the summer very much at all, [MN] especially down here.  It's so hot and disgusting I don't feel like doing anything.  It's, like, too hard to do anything in your apartment and then outside. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah, the fall --
L:  It doesn't -- it doesn't really get that hot up here.  Last year we had a real hot summer.  We had a real humid summer.
R:  Mm.
L:  But [MN] usually it's really not real hot up here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- I -- I like the summer, but I j- -- well, I can't say I like this spring because all we've had is rain this spring.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't want to do anything in the rain. [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.
L:  I'm -- I'm not one of those ones that take a walk in the rain. [MN] 
R:  Yeah.  It's -- well, it's good for sleeping and that's about it.
L:  Yeah, yeah, if you want to sleep, yep.
R:  [LAUGH] [MN] Mm, it's so funny that this topic came up, because last time I had to talk about politics and, like, this is much more mundane.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yesterday I had to talk about, ah, -- 
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- corporate -- corporate America.
R:  Oh.  This is much more innocuous.  I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we won't get into a fight over, ah, [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  [MN] 
R:  -- warm weather.  [MN] But, um, -- 
L:  I guess they want to know what we like to do indoors too, ah?
R:  Yeah.  What --
L:  Indoors --  
R:  -- do you like to do indoors?
L:  Ah, I -- I just like to ei- either watch movies -- you know, rent movies and watch movies or -- ah, there's quite a few TV shows that I like.
R:  What do you like?  [MN]
L:  I -- I like the basic ones.  You know, I have all these cable channels and I hardly ever watch any of them.  I like, like, Law and Order, and I like those crime scene investigation --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [inaudible] things and forensic things and --
R:  Do you like, ah, twenty four?
L:  Yeah, I like that -- 
R:  That's -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like my favorite one.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I like -- I like Jag.  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't -- I haven't seen that one.
L:  I -- I'm a little diverse.  I'm not a comedy person.  I don't really like the comedy shows.
R:  Mm.
L:  I -- I [MN] -- I don't watch any of them.  I like more reality type stuff.  I like to watch court TV, um, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Stuff like that.
R:  Yeah, I'm a -- I usually work at night because I wait tables and, um, --
L:  Yep.
R:  So, I -- [MN] it's only on a few nights that I get to watch tee four and, um, [MN] what else do I -- oh, you know what I've become addicted to just 'cause it's on and I have to get to -- when I start getting ready for work so I just put it on, like?  Dr. Phil.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, I watch him too all the time. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] It's my guilty pleasure. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  He -- yeah, I definitely like to watch him too.  
R:  [MN] 
L:  I think he's, ah, [NOISE] -- he's pretty funny.
R:  Yeah, he is pretty funny.  I love it he has his whole family there all the time.  He's got his wife in the audience.  Last -- yesterday he had his son on. [MN]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  His wife's in the audience almost every day.
R:  Yeah, it's like, "Doesn't she have anything to do besides watch you work?"  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  [MN] I don't know.  It -- I mean, I don't know.  [MN] Well, they -- they -- they moved out there to California so that he could do that show, so ...
R:  Yeah, well, I'm sure if he does that show for a year then -- [MN] then I bet, like, three or four generations of Dr Phil will never have to work again, so -- [MN] 
L:  Right, right.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's worth the sacrifice, and, besides, they live in Texas, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Mm?
R:  And they are from Texas, so it's no big -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- loss [inaudible].  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's definitely different in California than Texas.
R:  Yeah.
L:  California -- I'd probably go to his show every day too.  I mean ... [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  I lived out there for a little while --  
R:  Oh, where'd you live --
L:  -- like eight months. [MN]  
R:  Southern or northern?
L:  Southern.
R:  Yeah.
L:  In North Hollywood.  My sister lives out there now in Burbank.
R:  Does she like it?
L:  Oh, yeah.  She's been out there for, like, [MN] almost thirty years.
R:  What does she do?  Is she in the film industry?  [MN]
L:  Pardon me?
R:  Is she in the film industry, or -- or is she -- she involved in the entertainment things or just --
L:  Oh, no, no, no, no.  She's -- not at all.  She's done a lot of different things.  Right now she's managing a candy -- she's like a supervisor for candy -- a candy store chain out there or something.
R:  Mm, that's cool.  [MN] Yeah, I've friends out there.  They're -- they're all like --
L:  My son lives in Colorado.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, he must be -- 
L:  It's nice. 
R:  -- an outdoorsy guy? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yep.  He likes to do everything.  He likes to mountain bike, he likes to snowboard, he -- he likes all those outdoor activities, and he -- he's been out there for 'bout five years now and we've been out -- we've been out a few times to visit him.  It's really nice out there.
R:  Mm.
L:  And that's where you can do a lot of outdoor activities.  He's done kayaking.  You know, --
R:  That's something --  
L:  -- everything you can think of you can do out there.
R:  That's something I've been wanting to try.  Actually, we have a [MN] lot of a -- well, we're on the -- we have two big rivers here, and there's a lot of streams that feed into them, and people go kayaking --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- and you're supposed to be able to see, like, um, -- you know, it's not very intense in the water.  It's not like kayaking in the ocean or anything, but it's -- um, you see a lot of wildlife apparently -- [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [NOISE] up close.  That's something I've wanted to try.
L:  Yeah.  Well, he was really into it for a while until he had a bad ordeal with it where he cracked his head against a rock.
R:  Ugh.
L:  Luckily, you know, his helmet saved him, but still [inaudible] out of it, you know.
R:  Wow.
L:  So he hasn't been doing it for a while.
R:  Yeah, that would scare me.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH] So ...  You don't do yoga, do you? [LAUGH] 
L:  No, but I've been thinking about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My son does it.  He's trying to get me to do it.
R:  It's really good.
L:  Yeah. How [inaudible] -- 
R:  Especially if you have any pains in your body.
L:  Have you been doing it a long time?
R:  Ah, I don't do it very often.  I've been doing for, like, two years.  There's just kind of a few stretches that I like to do, like, every other day in the morning and at night.  [MN]  
L:  Yeah, he's really into that.
R:  You --
L:  He -- he likes that.  I just haven't made the commitment yet to do it.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] I had a really good teacher for a while but then, like, stopped going to the health club just 'cause I didn't have time, so ...  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But what I can remember I do at home.  [MN] You don't go to gym, do you?
L:  Um, I haven't been.  I was going till I hurt my back and then I stopped going 'cause -- 'cause of that, and -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- now that I'm better I'm afraid to go back.  I'm afraid it might --
R:  Mm.  What did you do to your back? [MN] 
L:  I had a herniated disk that -- it was just [inaudible] it was sitting on one of the nerves.
R:  Oh, I had that happen too, when I was eighteen.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How'd you do it, do you know?
L:  H- -- no.  I just woke up like that one day.
R:  Mm.  Do you --
L:  Just woke up --
R:  -- do a lot of sitting -- like, do you have a sitting job?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  But [NOISE] -- yeah, but [MN] -- it just happened one day.  I just -- 
R:  Mm. 
L:  -- woke up like that and --  
R:  'Cause I find that --
L:  -- then --
R:  -- whenever I have to sit a lot that's when it gets bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  It kinda went away on its own.
R:  Mhm.
L:  After months it finally went away on its own, so now I'm afraid if I go to the gym I might jar it a little bit and put it back where it was [LAUGH], you know.
R:  Yeah.  They say actually if you walk -- if you -- 
L:  Ye- -- 
R:  -- go walking it's good for that or if you -- 
L:  Ye- -- 
R:  -- ride one of those stationary bikes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Mm.  I find that as long as I -- as long as I'm moving but if -- as long as I don't, like, lift or, um, go running or something that puts a lot of pressure on it, like, um, -- and the more movement I have, the better the back is. [MN] 
L:  Yeah, I just feel like, you know, if it --
R:  Yeah, when you get --
L:  -- got it -- got itself away from the nerve, I'd hate to move --
R:  Yeah, when you [inaudible] --
L:  -- it over -- back over there. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  I know when you -- when you have an injury like that you get protective of it.  [MN] Um, [MN] did you have, like, nerve pains in your legs?  [MN] 
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah, the m- -- the worst part about it was, like, I --
