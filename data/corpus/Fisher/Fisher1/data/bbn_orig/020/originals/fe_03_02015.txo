R:  [PAUSE] Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Yes, hi, this is Monica.
L:  Hi, this is Anne.
R:  Hi.  How are you doing? [LAUGH]
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, I don't -- I couldn't really hear the subject.  What was it about?  I couldn't really hear it on my phone.
L:  Um, they said they want to know, um -- originally they said something about corporate America and their conduct, and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- with the scandals that are going on right now in corporate America, what can the government do --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- to help in these kind of situations.
R:  Okay.
L:  That's kinda the gist of it.
R:  Oh, okay.  Um, let me see.  Well like the Enron stuff that went on?
L:  Right, and they want to know if it's affected us personally.
R:  Well personally I don't think it has, but yet, you know, kinda gets -- it kinda scares the people that are working for these companies, you know, corporations and stuff into getting -- like, not investing with them, like their stocks, buying stocks with them and everything.  
L:  Right.
R:  I think it does affect them during the -- you know, I'd be scared if I was working with a big corporation and -- you know how they do that 401K --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- you know, you buy the stock and -- I would be scared of putting my money to them, you know.
L:  Right, 'cause you don't know --
R:  I don't know.  You don't know 'cause you can lose it all.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Like these people, it's like, God.
L:  I mean, even, you know, [COUGH] I don't work in corporate America right now, but even job wise and stuff, you just don't know what the people over you are doing.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, and what your name can be involved in, or a part of.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  But I have to say, they say, what can the government do, and I think oh my gosh, you know, our last president, you know, he lied, he did all these things, shredded documents, [LAUGH] I mean, he did everything these Enron people were doing, and we didn't even do a thing to him.  He wasn't even impeached, you know --
R:  That's true, yeah.
L:  -- it's like, so what is the government going to do to stop another Enron crisis, you know, or scandal, or you know, catastrophe is what it is.  A lot of people have lost money, jobs, everything in that.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, I don't think our government, right now, I mean, it could improve, um, I have hope [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I don't think our government really has -- you know, they have to keep themselves in order -- 
R:  Yeah, they do.  Yeah.
L:  -- before they can --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- before they can move into corporate America.
R:  -- go into -- yeah.  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  You know, I mean, in all reality, our government is our role model.  
R:  That's true.  That's true.  They need to get their stuff together before they can go and run somebody else's --
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  -- business, I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Fix their business and then try to fix somebody else's, you know.
L:  Right.  So it's very hard to say -- I don't think the government could do anything.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, once things are brought into the light we need a judicial system who will truly be fair and honest and really bring these people, you know, some conviction upon them and, you know, have them serve some kind of sentence, but at that point --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.  You know, at that point, what happens?  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  That's true, that's true. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, most of it's gone, the damage is done.
R:  And the people just have to get start over, you know.
L:  Right.  And if anybody does get brought to justice they're going to go to a federal penitentiary and play golf and pool [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- at the taxpayer's expense.
R:  That's true.  I think they should --
L:  Have you ever seen a federal penitentiary?
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I've visited a couple [LAUGH] and it's like, oh, come on.
R:  Yeah.  I think they should put them with the regular people. [LAUGH] The regular --
L:  It's like --
R:  -- criminals because, I mean, it's, it's a crime.  Like there's for other people lose their live -- you know, their livelihood, I guess, right?  It's like taking away their life from them, kind of, sort of, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  So.  That's true.  They should -- I -- they should put them with the regular people.
L:  Right.
R:  So.
L:  That's for sure.  You know, that might do a little bit more, you know --
R:  Scare them. [LAUGH]
L:  You see, we don't have, you know, it's corporate peoples, from what I see, reading papers and just, you know, history, corporate people seem to really get off with their crimes.
R:  Mm.  Yes, they do.
L:  You know.  So it doesn't stop the next guy to say, you know, well I can embezzle, I can go spend five years in a nice little resort [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and come back and my money will be --
R:  And start all over again.
L:  -- and my money will be laundered somewhere, and I could start all over again.  Right.  They --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they often get -- they're the ones that get the pardon.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they get to start all over again, you know.
R:  Yeah.  That, that's true.  That's true.  I mean --
L:  So I don't know -- 
R:  I know -- 
L:  -- I don't know, what do you think, do you think our government could do something? [LAUGH]
R:  I don't think so.  They need to get their stuff, you know, fixed before they can go into somebody else's business.  You know, fix their stuff --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then, you know, work on somebody else's.  I think it would be very very hard to do that.
L:  Right.
R:  Very very hard. 
L:  [COUGH] You know, and I mean, it's -- it is a scary thing to invest and so forth when, you know, there's so much corruption right now.
R:  Yeah.  You don't know --
L:  And then just, you know, you wonder where your investments are actually going [LAUGH] too, you know. 
R:  [LAUGH] I know, I know.  That's true.
L:  You know, so --
R:  That's true, 'cause you don't know if you're going to get them at the end, you know, when you do retire, or you're going to move on to another job or something, you don't know what's gonna happen.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's good on paper, but then when you finally go and try to take it out or whatever, it may not be there.
L:  Right.  This is true, you know.  Um, I don't know.  I guess in my mind I've always, you know, I'm not opposed to, you know, and we did have a 401K for a while, but um, [COUGH] I really trust more in, in property --
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  -- investing in property.  
R:  Yeah.  That's true.  That's true.
L:  And I know we can't all do that, but I, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Especially with all these shake ups, and just the uncertainty.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  Um --
R:  But the thing is, they -- these companies make it look good, you know, like okay, invest in the 401K, you know, we're going to match, you know, eighty per cent of what, you know, you put in, and stuff like that.  So it's tempting to these people, right.  So, I don't know.
L:  Right.
R:  Very tempting.
L:  It, it's, it's, ah --
R:  They kind of lure you into it, you know.
L:  Right.  And you know, I mean, just because, you know, you see Enron and you see Whitewater, you see, you know, all these different things, you know, that we've had, um, there's been a lot of companies that have just, you know, folded left and right, and a lot of them because they haven't been, you know, managing their funds properly, or other people's funds properly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, you know, but then there are still, you know, there are still a lot of good, good companies out there, you know.  But you know, people like Arthur Anderson ruin it for everyone --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and then it's not everyone within that company either --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- who should have the bad name, you know. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  Just certain ones.
L:  -- you know, it's, um -- I guess I think just having more, um, more, more of their records made public.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not be so secretive.
L:  Right.  And even like, you know, the people in the upper levels, you know, even, you know, their personal lives are gonna have to be -- more things revealed about them as well.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You can tell a lot about a person --
R:  Like an open book, right, like an open book.
L:  Right.  You know, you could tell a lot about a person through their, their private life.  You know.  As far as if you can trust them, you know.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  'Cause you're talking about trusting them with your, [LAUGH] with your --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- your retirement, your children's college funds, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah --
R:  'Cause, I mean, a lot of these men, I mean, well they were mostly men, right, in the Enron thing --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and they had houses, God, and cars and trips and this, and I was like, golly.  And a lot of -- a lot of the other people didn't know about it.  And I was like, damn.
L:  You know, I live in, ah, Chicago.  I don't know where you live.
R:  In Texas.
L:  In Texas.
R:  [LAUGH] Mhm.
L:  Where at in Texas?
R:  In, ah, south Texas.  San Antonio.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I used to live in Tyler, Texas. 
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
L:  Um, anyway, um, we had a, a small suburban area near Chicago --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the mayor [LAUGH] was -- just got, you know, arrested for embezzlement, she had all these people behind her, and it's just, ah, you know, a lot of people went down with her and she will go away for about five or six years, and the sad thing is her daughter.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, you know, she's a single mom.
R:  Oh.
L:  So I mean, that's a sad -- that's a sad thing.  But this woman, I mean, she just ripped the town off royal.  I mean, took everything from them.
R:  God.
L:  And the majority of it she blew in the casinos, gambling.
R:  Oh my God.
L:  You know, and so [LAUGH] you know, it's been in the news and the paper and everything, and it's like, you know, now her gambling should of been made public a long time ago.  
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  You know.  It just --
R:  God.
L:  -- even the amounts that she was losing at the casinos --
R:  God. 
L:  -- we're talking millions of dollars.
R:  Golly.
L:  You know it's like, this should of been made public a long time ago.  Do you really want somebody handling your, your county money --
R:  Your money, or [LAUGH] --
L:  -- your, you know, your city money and your [LAUGH] --
R:  God.
L:  -- I mean, it was their health insurance, it's their health care and everything.  I mean, she just took --
R:  Everything.
L:  -- you know, she channeled the money here, there and everywhere --
R:  Golly.
L:  -- got herself a golf course, and some other things. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh my God.
L:  A horse farm, and -- um, you know, and she wasn't alone in it.  I really doubt she was even the mastermind, um, behind it all.  But --
R:  Uh-huh.  It had to be somebody else. [LAUGH] Golly.
L:  You know, but if, if just her gambling, you know, the casinos report that -- they report this.  I mean, the media was able --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to come up with all the records on how much she had lost there and stuff.  It's like, why wasn't this made public?  Why wasn't this woman asked to step down.  If you have that big of a gambling addiction --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there is no way on earth you should be handling the cheque book for a city.
R:  That's true.  Yes.  
L:  You know.
R:  Golly.
L:  So --
R:  How long did she get away with doing this?
L:  You know, I mean, it caught up with her.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But the town's really not going to get their money back.
R:  God.
L:  The casinos are holding most of it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know. [LAUGH]
R:  Golly.
L:  You know.  So it's like -- it's a sad thing.  But you think that here, you know, this was the mayor.  And it took them so long, she, she -- you know, embezzled just, you know, a ton of money before anybody caught her.  
R:  Golly.
L:  And so I
