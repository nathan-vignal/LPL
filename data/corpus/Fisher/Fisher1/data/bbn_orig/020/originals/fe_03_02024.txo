R:  Hi, this is Nancy.
L:  Hi, Nancy.  This is James.  
R:  Hi, James.  How you doing?
L:  I'm doing okay.  Feeling very dumb 'cause --
R:  Feeling very dumb because of the subject?  I've got to tell you the -- [MN] I [MN] -- I understood part of it but some of it wasn't totally clear.  Did you?
L:  [MN] Ah, --
R:  What can the government do to curb corporate --  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, I -- I got the gist of it.
L:  [NOISE] I think it's, um, just about maybe stuff like Enron or something.
R:  Enron and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Andersen and [MN] Philip -- well, not really Philip Morris, um, I guess wouldn't apply in this situation.  [MN] Did -- did you hear clearly what the --
L:  No.  [LAUGH]
R:  It was a little muddled.
L:  I --
R:  It wa- was really a little muddled and it was about three questions.  So, what can the government do to curb it?  I definitely heard that part.  So I -- I have an opinion on that.  Do you have an opinion on what the government can do?
L:  Have no idea.  This is --
R:  I --
L:  -- one of those times when I think, "Wow, I should actually watch CNN sometimes just [several inaudible words] just slipping --" 
R:  Oh.
L:  "-- through [inaudible]". 
R:  Well, I think that -- I think that white collar crime should be treated as, um, [MN] -- as -- as what we've seen recently this year -- I think it always should have: take them out in handcuffs, arrest them, throw them in jail.  I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that what the government can do is impose stricter regulations on these firms in terms of how they account for their business, how they spend their money.  I think that a lot of my opinions would -- would probably lean to the socialist side because people would say, "Too much control, too much control," but I -- I think that the -- the difference between what CEOs earn and the -- I'm not going to say the -- the minimum paying pers- -- minimum paid person [NOISE] in a company, but let's say a mid level person [MN], say someone who's been there seven, eight -- eight years, mid or entry level management or a -- a good, solid administrative support person who's making a nice income.  I don't think there should be a difference of -- of, ah, fifteen hundred times.  You know, somebody's earning forty thousand dollars and somebody's earning forty million dollars.  There's -- there's something wrong with that.  There's only so much money, and unless -- unless a person is directly responsible -- the only people that really deserve to a- -- to make a big cut of the profits in my opinion are the sales people because they are the ones that aren't supposed to be incurring anything.  But, you know, that's getting off the subject.  What the government can do, I think the government would just have to impose stricter regulations on companies, 'cause that's really what the Fisher Project wants us to talk about, is what can they do and how have things affected our opinions, um.  [MN] What -- well, how has that -- how's everything affected your opinion?
L:  Um, it [MN] -- its -- I've laughed at a few jokes about Enron, even though I have no idea what happened there.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, you don't?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Okay.
L:  [MN] My, ah, -- my news, I basically watch the Daily Show [MN].  I'm --
R:  Do you read the paper?
L:  -- up on topics [several inaudible words].
R:  Okay, well, Enron, they -- they didn't account correctly.
L:  Oh.
R:  And they -- they lost the pension -- everybody lost -- everybody except I guess the CEO.  Are you, um, [MN] -- are you familiar -- do you -- do you keep up on news?  Well, you watch the daily news, so you hear about business.
L:  Oh, the Daily Show is actually a comedy show which spoofs the news.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Oh, so you -- you don't know anything about the current news; is that what you are saying?
L:  Well, I know about, like, stuff they interrupt the usual stuff with, you know, -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- like war and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah.  Okay.
L:  And, you know, for a while I was actually watching the [MN] news thinking, "So, are we winning this war?  Should I be wearing a gas mask?"  But, you know, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- other than that, I -- I just haven't really been paying much attention to the news.
R:  Okay.  Well, part of the question was: what should the government do [MN] to, um, -- to curb this problem?  Wh- -- do you think the government should do anything?
L:  Um, yeah, if it's a problem they should probably do something about it.
R:  Okay.  What -- what do you think the government -- how involved should the government be in these things? 
L:  Um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- I don't -- I don't know how involved -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- exactly 'cause, you know, if you earn billions, you know, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you don't want the government just coming -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in saying, "Well, you worked hard for this --" 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- money.  Now we are going to take it away".  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  You know, if you get to a certain place where you can, you know, be a ma- -- be a monopoly or get lots of money or whatever --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- you know, you earned it.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  You worked pretty hard to get there.  So ...
R:  Do you mean if you're -- if you're your own person or a small business?  [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, yeah.  If you make a -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- small business into a big business [inaudible].
R:  Okay.  But let's say -- what do you -- what do you think -- okay, well, let's take big companies.  Let's take companies like, I don't know, IBM or AT&T or, [NOISE] you know, whoever, who -- a- any of these big companies.  Do you think the government should have a right to regulate?  [NOISE] 
L:  Ah, I can't say anything bad about AT&T on --  
R:  [NOISE] Well, I'm just saying as an example -- big companies. 
L:  -- the phone right now because I'm paranoid.  Ah, ah, [MN] yeah --
R:  Pepsi --  
L:  -- sure [inaudible] -- 
R:  Coca-Cola. 
L:  What?
R:  Pepsi, Coca-Cola.
L:  Okay, well, Pepsi and Coca-Cola --
R:  You know, any -- any kind of a big company.  I just -- I'm just trying to talk about, you know, big companies where it'd be more likely to [NOISE] -- to get these kinds of problems.  [NOISE] 
L:  I -- I -- I think that the government should be able to, you know, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- maybe keep track of how much money they are making.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Hold on a second. 
R:  Okay. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, we are not supposed to.  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Um, --
R:  Hi.  Okay -- 
L:  Sorry. 
R:  -- so you feel like they should be able to keep tabs on it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] You know the other thing too -- maybe this is something -- um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- because she was saying -- th- -- or she -- the -- the robot was saying --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  It's kind of funny.  The robot was saying, um, talk about what you think the government should be able to do, and another point is technically the government can really only inspect really, really carefully public companies.  If they are on the stock market, you have to file your tax returns, SEC statements.  All that stuff is only for publicly traded companies.  So, if a company isn't publicly traded -- and I don't mean the little, small, you know, sole proprietor, you know, mom and pop business.  I'm -- I'm talking about large companies that are not public.  Um, I can't think of an example of one, but you know what I mean, before they turn public.  What do you -- what d- -- 
L:  Like ones that make stuff for other businesses?
R:  What?
L:  They don't, you know, sell publicly; they sell to people who are --
R:  Well, in other words, they are not a public company.  They don't have stock traded on the stock market.
L:  Uh. 
R:  Okay.  Should the government be able to regulate them; because as it is right now they really can only regulate the public companies. 
L:  I'm going to say yes.
R:  I agree --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- with that.  
L:  Okay. 
R:  And so -- we're getting recorded on this.  Yeah, you know, now that -- now that I think about it, I don't think that government regulations should go just for publicly traded companies.
L:  Mm.
R:  I think if somebody starts a business, like Ford -- Ford or Pepsi or Coc- -- whoever -- at -- there was a point where these companies were really big and they were not public.  I mean, they go public to make more money, but they get to a point where [NOISE] they're just so big and then the big -- you know, all the news is, "Well, now we're gonna go public".  But if they never get to that point they should still at certain [MN] -- I -- I don't know whether it would be at a certain price, like they generate revenue in excess of fifty million dollars a year or they exceed five hundred employees or what the criteria is -- maybe a hundred employees, the [MN] -- they should then be able to be regulated, um, in terms of -- of their taxes, just the way a public company is, and I think that that could definitely curb the problems we've had, 'cause it's not just Enron.  I mean, it's not.  Look at the scandals.  Well, [MN] you may not know about it, because you said -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you weren't keeping up with it, but Quest Communications --
L:  Mm.
R:  Quest Communications has been in the telecom picture.  They're d- -- they -- they're another Enron story.  
L:  And -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I heard something about Disney, Mike Wiesner[?] making [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, and WorldCom -- MCI WorldCom.  They're -- they're almost done.  MCI was one company and WorldCom was another, LDDS, and, you know, they merged and now -- now they're -- they're practically extinct.  They're on -- they're on the verge of being extinct.  [NOISE]  American Airlines, United Airlines: they're in Chapter Eleven right now.  They're -- 
L:  What do you work as?
R:  Oh, I'm self employed, but I used to work as a researcher.  What do you do?  [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, I'm an actor, so that explains the whole mimbo[?] thing.
R:  Explains the what?
L:  Whole mimbo.  I'm not -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- very intellectual.  I left -- 
R:  Oh. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  How did you get involved with Fisher, then?
L:  Fisherman?  Oh, I got into that when I was on the Internet and there -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- was some advertisement for it and I was like, " [inaudible] spam --" 
R:  Okay.
L:  [MN] 
R:  Okay. 
L:  "-- how interesting".
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah, so ...
R:  Well, [MN] if you're an actor, then you work for big studios or you -- you might or you might want to work for big studios, and they would -- I -- I don't even know if [NOISE] Universal or MGM are -- are public or private, I don't even know, but that -- those would be really good examples.  Should -- should they be regulated financially, their accounting practices?  Should they be under inspection by the government to follow the laws of business accounting?  So I -- yeah, I definitely think that that would help curb these kinds of future problems, where these public companies, um, cheat on -- cheat on the books and they -- the people that pay are the people, like Enron, who've been there twenty, thirty years and their -- their working days are done and -- and they have no retirement, and they're thinking all those years, "Well, I'm putting in my time, and when I'm ready to, you know, --"
