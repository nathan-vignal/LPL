L:  Hello, I'm Kevin Bach. 
R:  Hi, I'm Roy.
L:  Hi, Roy.
R:  How's it going?
L:  All right. [LAUGH] Have you done this before with these?
R:  Ah, yeah, I've done it once before.
L:  Okay, this is the first time.  I guess we're just supposed to discuss in general the, the topic at hand, eh?
R:  Right, and the topic was, ah, illegal business practices in the US.  I'm thinking that -- that they want to know about, you know, like the Enron and corporate scandals and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah, yeah definitely.  Ah... I was also thinking too, is like even, you know, just how, you know, responsible, um, ah, people who run these companies, ah, need to be, and not only just to the shareholders, but really to, you know, employees as well.
R:  Yeah, it's, ah, basically it's ethics.
L:  I agree.
R:  Well yeah, I mean really like those guys who are doing all the bad stuff are ruining it for all the people that are staying good.  Now that they're going to have more rules and regulations they have to com- comply with.  And it's really hurting the market for like all the college graduates.  Right now I'm a college senior, and I'm graduating in May, hoping that I get a job soon.  So I have friends who are sitting around and -- sitting around because they don't have any jobs.
L:  Well, I've been unemployed for two -- two years.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, what -- ah, what, ah, area are you in?
L:  Well, I was a, I was a Unix system administrator --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm gonna graduate with a MIF degree in about a month -- less than a month.
L:  Right.  But you, you probably know programing and stuff, right?
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  There's still room for that.  The administration job on Unix is kind of -- it's gotten so much more automated, you know what I mean, that only the top -- yeah, only the best, the real gurus, you know, kept their jobs during the dotcom bust.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then there was also the Y2K thing.  I mean, basically if you could spell the word Unix you could get a job, you know, in nineteen ninety nine.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And companies had outrageous budgets. [LAUGH] But, ah --
R:  Yeah.  Lots of companies were willing to spend a lot of money.
L:  Yeah.  Um, so anyway, with, um, this thing here, I mean, like even most recently where -- ah, getting back to where I kind of think that a very recent example of just where these guys are like out of touch is like what happened with American Airlines.  Ah, this -- they negotiated with the unions, the three different unions to all to take pay cuts so they don't have to go into bankruptcy.  When they achieve that, they turn around and give million dollar bonuses to all the executives.
R:  Yeah.  See, that's the problem.  That money should trickle back down to the employees.
L:  Right.
R:  It's all like how other airlines do it.  But American Airlines is so big they have to -- like, I don't know why.  Like I know [inaudible] airlines, there the employees take a active role in the company.  Basically I think every single one of them has stock in the company.  So if they're not happy with their jobs then they're not happy with their stock.  So that promotes the --
L:  Right.  Well I think also a part of it too is, you know, we're -- so many people who, um, you know, that the -- what I think might be a good -- sh- short of having the government really starting to get involved here, if, ah, managers of mutual funds would start taking responsibility for the shares that they control, you know, 'cause they don't have to just proxy it over to these people and let them run the company any way they want.
R:  That's true.
L:  You know, and, and they should start doing things like that too, because I think part of the reason a lot of this stuff happens is just that, ah, the board of directors of most of these corporations are really not independent boards, you know, they're just -- you know, they're easy buddies or political payback people, you know, like -- like retired senators and stuff.
R:  Yeah, somehow they're related -- they have a connection to each other.
L:  Right.  And so they just give these executives any time they want, you know, and the -- you know, like, ah, I just saw on CNN about this thing, ah, with, with, ah, ah, American Airlines and they were just talking about the executives in general, you know.  The past two years the average person's wage in this country has gone up like three per cent.  But among executives in corporations it's gone up fourteen per cent.
R:  Yeah.  That's all about the rich getting richer basically.  The -- I was recently watching the news and -- have you ever heard of Health South?
L:  Of what?
R:  Health South.  It's a, ah, rehab and hospital company.
L:  Ah --
R:  They do, ah, three qu- I believe three quarters of the rehab in the US.  Like their owner created a separate account and funneled twelve million dollars out into his own private account.
L:  So he stole?
R:  Yeah, basically he stole that money, and then he spent company money on private jets and things like that.
L:  Yeah.  Well, you know, one thing I do -- what I wish that the government would change, is I wish is when they'd catch these guys who do these white collar crimes, they stick them in jail with -- where, you know --
R:  They should have harsher punishment.
L:  Well, they should also go to real jails, too.  You know. [LAUGH] They should go to real jails.
R:  Yeah.  What kind of jails do these guys go to?
L:  Well, a lot of these in the federa- the white collar guys on these federal things, they go into those real light duty, ah, type prisons.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I mean, they, they should go to, like, a real jail.  I always thought they did go to a real jail.
L:  And then, you know, and you're right, and they ought to start putting some real serious, um, kinds of penalties on these guys too.  They really don't do that.
R:  Yeah, because one bad person can ruin a whole company.  That's what's really sad.  And everyone else could be a good employee too.  The way the economy is right now, I mean, if you -- depending on which field you're in, if you lose your job, it'll take a while to get back on your feet.
L:  Oh, right, right.
R:  I --
L:  You know, just the, the, um, ah... I, I think that's part of what I was trying to say there too, was -- and I agree with what you're saying, is that, you know, you get a guy who, [NOISE] you know, ah, you know, robbed a store or something like that, and he's getting so many years and it's a larceny kind of thing.  But when -- you know, you get a guy who, you know, these people who's like screwed up like in Enron, the impact, the social impact is far greater, you know, than any one thief.
R:  Yeah, because it impacts not only the employees but the community too.  Because Enron, or -- that was such a big company.  Like they -- like I figured out -- which company was it?  There's this one oil company somewhere in the Midwest --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they somehow were corrupted and they had to go out of business.  And this town basically -- this company fed the town.  And after that the town went bankrupt.  It was actually pretty sad.  This happened when -- I think in the early nineties --
L:  Oh, right, 'cause I mean, they're paying taxes and --
R:  -- and all their workers and employees --
L:  -- on their property --
R:  -- work -- live in this -- in the surrounding areas, so this company's just putting so much money into businesses and the community and everything.  Once that, ah, oil company was gone, there's nothing there for all the people.  I mean, they still had little restaurants and shops and everything, but nothing really big. 
L:  Hm.
R:  But yeah, it's really crazy what's going on, and like all of a sudden all these scandals are occurring.  And many of the companies, from what I saw on, ah, MSNBC or CNN or something, many of these companies are trying to cover up their actions now.  And turning over a new leaf so noone can find out.  It's really alarming how many companies are just stealing money from the company.
L:  Yeah, I know.  And it's -- I think stealing is the right word too.  They -- they always use fancy words though when it comes to all these corporate crimes, you know.  
R:  Or, ah, borrowing without repaying.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think, ah -- I -- somebody said something like that on, ah, MSNBC or CNN, one of the two.  One of the execs were borrowing, they loaned -- the company loaned they money to them, but they didn't have to pay it back.
L:  Right.  They do that kind of thing all the time, those companies --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- a lot of those executives, that's what they do, they get that, you know, they get interest free loans that they never even have to repay.
R:  Yeah, it's all about how you word it.  You could borrow the money, but you know, they're not actually borrowing it, they know they're not going to pay it back.  I mean -- yeah, it's, it's just crazy what's going on. Oh, well -- I'm just wondering, where are you located at?
L:  Ah, ah, Ferndale, Michigan.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It's north of Detroit.
R:  I'm from Dallas, Texas.
