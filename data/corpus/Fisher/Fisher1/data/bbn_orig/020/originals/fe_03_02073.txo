R:  Hi, my name is Francesca.
L:  Hi, I'm Candy.
R:  How're you doing, Candy?
L:  Pretty good.  This is my first call.  I have no idea how this works.
R:  You -- you know what?  It's my first call too and --
L:  Ah!
R:  [LAUGH] -- so we'll just ... we'll just wing it, but, um, I know that the, uh, we'll just talk about the, uh, particular topic, um ... about outdoor activities.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, uh, whether you like cold or warm weather.  That would be our first question.
L:  Oh, heavens.  I guess I like -- well, yeah, this is a perfect day here in Oklahoma.  It's like seventy two degrees and gorgeous.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Um ... I hate intense heat.  I've lived here all my life and I gripe my head off every year about the summers.  They're just ghastly.  But I like being outside when the weather's nice.
R:  I -- uh, okay, and how hot does it get in Oklahoma?
L:  Oh ... thirty plus days in a row of a hundred and four or a hundred and five.
R:  Oh, wow!. 
L:  Eighty percent humidity.
R:  Wow.
L:  It's awful.
R:  I'm --
L:  It usually is between ninety five and a hundred and five most of the summer from late June.
R:  Wow!
L:  Yeah.  Where are you?
R:  I'm in Philadelphia.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, uh ... right now today it was raining and -- but it wasn't rainy and windy so it was okay.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And tomorrow it's gonna -- I think it's gonna be like seventy two or seventy degrees, something like that.  But --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- our weather has been changing.  Now, I -- I like warm weather.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That way, you know, I can go outdoors, I can do things.  Um, cold weather I usually wanna stay in the house.
L:  Yeah, I enjoy working in my yard when the weather's moderate --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I just can't take the heat.
R:  Right.  I don't like it too hot either, but it's nice when you -- say, when you can't go outside and garden and, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- do all kinds of things.
L:  And I don't mind the cold weather so much.  Of course, in Oklahoma we always have ... uh, quite a bit of wind generally but, um, you know, you can always add another layer or two to stay warm.  But there's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just the finite amount you can take off [LAUGH] to cool down.
R:  Right, right.
L:  [SIGH] So, uh, you know, I love ... I -- we go, uh -- our -- the little town we live in is a suburb of, uh, Tulsa.
R:  Okay.
L:  And ... you know, they have a really neat Christmas ... thing, you know, like the week after Thanksgiving or --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- whatever, and I love to go down there.  They have carolers and, you know, we'll sit out on the patio of one of the restaurants and watch people go by and ... um, you know, that's pleasant, but you know, I'm not -- I'm not a runner or anything like that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so ... uh, but I -- I enjoy being outside.  You know, I love going to -- to, um, you know, antique fairs and we have a medieval fair in Muskogee. 
R:  Okay.
L:  And, you know, when the weather's nice, I really -- I just love being outside, but --
R:  Oh, that's go- Now, what do you usually do when you're outside.  Do you just garden or do you do other things?
L:  Oh, pretty much.  Just work around in the yard or --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know, like go to a -- go to a festival or something and walk around, look at stuff.
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh, occasionally we'll go down ... we'll go to the lake.  We don't live far from several lakes and have friends there --
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  -- and go up there and go out on a boat down there and ... 
R:  Oh, okay.  Now, what I usually like to do -- well, I'm a -- a summer baby.  My birthday's in July so --
L:  Well, I'm June.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH] So, I usually, um ... I -- I like to take the kids to the beach or go swimming or something like that, but I don't really like to swim.  I don't like to get in the water.
L:  Oh, well, see, if I'm going out I wanna be in the water, you know?  I'd much rather be in the water than baking on the beach.
R:  [LAUGH] I'd rather watch the kids or, um, the kids like to, uh, go, um ... [LIPSMACK] to, uh art- not art museums ... [LIPSMACK] amusement parks.
L:  Ah.
R:  So, I'll take them to amusement parks.  It's warm, they'll go there or, um, now I like the beach.  Now, I would get in the beach more than I would get into a swimming pool.
L:  Oh, my gosh.  See, I -- I prefer a swimming pool.  I like to see what's in there with me.
R:  Right [LAUGH] that's true.  That's true.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, I've been to Jamaica and you can see your feet at the bottom --
L:  Right.
R:  So, I'm kinda used to that but when we go out to, um, beaches around in the Philadelphia area we go to New Jersey.
L:  Ah.
R:  And you have no idea what you're stepping on --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what you're stepping in, so that's kinda scary.
L:  We went to Hawaii several years ago and I was just happy as I could be on my air mattress with my seat on the bank and my coke and my book and ... you know, and this little Hawaiian girl came out, about eight years old, and she said, "I -- I would have thought you'd be in the -- in the ocean".  I said, "Honey, we went to sea lodge park last night and I saw what's in there with me.  I -- this is just fine!" and I thought --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I thought she was going to rupture herself laughing.  She -- she thought I was pretty nuts.
R:  Right, right.
L:  But, uh ... yeah, I l- yeah, I like being out when the weather's nice.  There's just no doubt about it but ... [LIPSMACK] you know, other than that, I -- we re- I read a lot.  We -- well, I work a lot.
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  So, I'm on the computer a lot and ... have several email lists that I deal with and ... uh, keep up on.
R:  Okay, so, um, inside you -- do you go to malls?
L:  Uh, if I have to.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I'm a merchandiser by trade --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and so I spend my life in stores.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And I come home and my daughter says, "Hey, mom, let's go to the mall?".  I'm going, "Well, let's not!"
R:  Right, right.
L:  [LAUGH] As a matter of fact I just got home a little while ago.  I drove almost three hundred miles today servicing stores so --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Uh ... but mind you, I -- I go to malls now and then but I -- I get kinda --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- tired and, you know, unless I've got a lot of money to spend, I -- I'm not a big window shopper or just browser.
R:  Right.
L:  If I go shopping, I wanna -- I wanna buy.
R:  You wanna buy something, right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you pretty much know what you want to buy be- before you ... leave?
L:  Yeah, I much prefer stores where, you know, I can drive up, park right outside the door, run in, get what I need and be gone.
R:  And leave, right.  Right.  Now, my daughter, she's eleven ... she loves to be inside the mall.
L:  Oh, yeah, mine's seventeen.
R:  Okay.
L:  The mall rocks.
R:  Right, and, um [LIPSMACK] with me, uh, I'm the same way.  I just wan- I know what I want and I just want to go in there and get it and then leave, but, uh, to satisfy her I have to go into the different stores and look at the different clothes and spend my money.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  But ... uh, usually, what I like to do, especially if it's raining, I, um ... I'm a teacher so I'll just finish up paperwork or ... think about different plans for the children or, um, I love to read, like you said --
L:  What grade do you teach?
R:  Kindergarten.
L:  Oh, what fun.
R:  Yeah, so I try to think of all kinds of things to do and, um, just to keep them active and ... [LIPSMACK] constantly learning, you know?  It -- I want it to be where they are learning but they don't realize they're learning.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they're having so much fun and it's like, wow, guess what?  You just learned something!
L:  I know.
R:  Yeah, so kindergarten is great.
L:  When my daughter was in kindergarten, she came home one day.  She had the most ... marvelous teacher.  I have yet to see another one, but Miss Maria was just so cool.
R:  Okay.
L:  And Valerie came home one day and told me that, uh ... they had an elf.  It was getting close to Christmas and they had an elf in their room and when they took their naps, this was an honorary elf.  He would come out and just destroy things, you know, tear up the library corner and ... so I had found some, uh, red felt that I had ...
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and I just hand stitched little pants and a little jacket and little shoes and a little hat.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I passed them off to Miss Maria the next day when I took 'em to her, uh, took her to school, and when they'd go down for a nap, she'd ... stick one -- hide one in plain sight like the pants, you know, dangling from the blinds or --
R:  Ah!
L:  -- something and Valerie came home and she said, "Mom!  You're never gonna guess" so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Jonathan was his name.  " Jonathan left his pants!" and, I mean, ever day, you know, I'd be taking her another piece of clothing.  It was just --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so cool.
R:  Oh, I'm sure they loved that.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yes, kindergarten is great.
L:  They did, but ... [LIPSMACK] So, you know, it's fu- God knows my favorite activity is not house cleaning.  If you could see this house, you would know that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I will do ... just about anything to avoid that, but, um ...
R:  Well, that's funny.  I am the total opposite.  If I can stay in and just -- I sit home and think about I left dishes in the -- in the, uh, sink.  I -- and I will come home at lunchtime because I don't live that far from my school, and I will come home and vacuum or wash dishes.  I'm crazy.
L:  Oh, I guess.
R:  My friends are like, "What -- why would you go home to vacuum?" but I just --
L:  Well, you don't have to look at it when you come in.
R:  That's what I say.  I -- and ... dealing with thirty five year olds, I would rather come home to a clean home I could just sit down and watch TV.  That's like my favorite pastime [inaudible].
L:  Oh, yeah, I'm an addict.
R:  Just sit and watch --
