R:  Wow. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Ah, I don't do the whitewater kayak.  I just do the regular kayaking on the lake, and it's so gorgeous out there.
R:  Wait.  What is kayaking exactly? 
L:  Kayaking is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, like getting in a little boat that has, like, a hull on there and you just get in there and then you just, um, -- you just, ah, [MN] get -- ah, it's a one paddle and you just paddle, go back and forth, and it's just [MN] -- it's wonderful.  It's good exercise --

R:  -- not -- not in line, the other kind --
L:  Oh, o- --
R:  -- regular roller skate.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, I think I could do that, but I don't think I could do the, um, one [NOISE] -- the roller blades.  Those are too hard.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Actually, I did try it one time and I fell on my butt.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So I just couldn't do it.  [LAUGH] What else do you like?
R:  So where are you from? 
L:  I'm from Austin, Texas.  
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  The home of, ah, where, um, Sandra Bullock and, um, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Matthew McConaughey live.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  Where do you live? 
R:  Philadelphia.
L:  Philadelphia? 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.  Hey, that's where m- -- ah, Cosby lives, right? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I love that guy.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  Why, you're lucky.  Have you ever seen him? 
R:  Yeah, he -- as a matter of fact I go to University of Penn so, he, um, -- I think he'll be at the Penn relays today. 
L:  Really?  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, he goes --
L:  God, that must --
R:  -- to the Penn relays every year.
L:  Really? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I would love to see him.  [PAUSE] 
R:  So --
L:  I would love to m- meet him.  I -- in fact I had --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- some poems I was -- I wro- wrote --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for him, but they wouldn't accept it.
R:  Really? 
L:  Yeah.  It made me really mad.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Three times I wanted to write him because, um, I wanted to [MN] say, ah, -- I'd, ah, send him, like, forty dollars to [NOISE] -- to, ah, let him know I supported him when his son died, you know?
R:  Ahah, yeah.
L:  That tragic accident.  And, um, it, ah, [MN] ah, -- they wrote me back and thanked me and everything, but then my preacher got a hold of it and -- and, ah, told me that, ah, I was really bad for doing that and, ah, then I felt really guilty, so I wanted to write him and tell him that and they wouldn't even let me speak to him.  And he was here in Austin not too long ago and I wanted to talk to him and they wouldn't even let me talk to him.
R:  Damn.
L:  Yeah, it really pissed me off.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, ah, what other kind of, ah, stuff do you do?  [NOISE] 
R:  Um, what do I do?  I dance.
L:  Oh, what kind? 
R:  Hip hop.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, hip hop?  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I never h- -- oh, I don't know how to do any kind of dancing, but, um, -- [PAUSE] [SIGH]
R:  You haven't heard of hip hop? 
L:  No.
R:  Oh, wow.  Wait, where -- how old are you? 
L:  How many -- I'm forty six.
R:  What, ah, college did you go to?
L:  I didn't go to college.  I'm too dumb.
R:  Why you say that?
L:  Oh, 'cause I -- I'm dyslexic.  I'm the classic case for Bill Cosby.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 'cause I -- he -- he, ah, -- he had -- his, ah, son had dyslexia too.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And that's another reason I wanted to write him and talk to him, but -- and they wouldn't even let me near him.  It makes me mad.  Do you ever see him in person?  I mean, have you ever got up real close to him?
R:  Ah, [NOISE] -- I -- yeah, I think I've seen him a couple of times.  I've --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- been pretty close.
L:  Damn that's so cool.  [COUGH] What a --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's really neat.  My gosh.  Ah, [MN] let's see.  What else?  I like swimming.  I like to swim. 
R:  I cannot swim at all.  [LAUGH]
L:  Are you kidding me?  In Philadelphia --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and you can't swim? 
R:  I know.  Like, everybody goes swimming and I can't.  I -- I don't know --

R:  -- I can't learn.  I don't -- it doesn't work. 
L:  Oh, you can learn.  You can --
R:  No, like --
L:  -- float.
R:  -- I've been to the Y.  The Y have tried to teach me, like, three times --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I haven't -- I can't learn.
L:  Really? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  I was in a class of, like, three year olds and I still couldn't learn.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my God.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my God.  That's so funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.  And what's your name?

L:  Jennifer.  Oh, I'm Peggy [MN] -- well, Margaret.
R:  Peggy, okay.
L:  Or Margaret, whatever.
R:  Do you have any children?

R:  Oh, okay.

R:  I said, "Oh, that's nice".
L:  Yeah, well, it's nice, but I'm tired.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.

R:  Do you miss having a life, like, your own life?
L:  Yeah, I do.  I miss having a life, and I'm tired and, um, ah, I really -- I do [MN] miss having a life.  But, [MN] you know, it's my chosen, so I have to do it until she dies and then I'll have a life.  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Damn, that must be hard.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's hard.
R:  How old is she? 
L:  Eighty four.
R:  Wow.  That's my great grand mom's age.
L:  Really? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How old are you? 
R:  Eighteen.
L:  Eighteen?  Is that all?  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  God, you've got a long life ahead of you.  [NOISE]
R:  Do you -- I'm eighteen and my mom's thirty nine and my grandmom --
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  -- sixty and then my great grand mom's like -- no, my great, great grand mom's like maybe --
L:  What --
R:  -- yes, I think she's eighty now, yes. 
L:  Really? 
R:  Yep.
L:  Well, um, how did you get involved in this, ah, -- this, ah, oh, -- 
R:  Phone thing?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Um, --
L:  [NOISE] And how long have you done it? 
R:  This is my first time.
L:  Oh, really?  This is my first time too.  I think this is cool.  [NOISE] You get to --
R:  Me too.
L:  -- meet people.
R:  So, wait, like, how did you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- hear about it? 
L:  Well, I was on the computer and I was just surfing the computer [NOISE] and I wanted a job, wanted money, to get money.
R:  Ahah.
L:  [LAUGH] So that's -- that's how I did it.  How did you?  [NOISE] 
R:  Same, but I was, um, -- they were -- they sent out an email.  Like, a girl had --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- did this and she --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- was like, "Yeah, it's really good.  You make ten dollars a phone call, blah, blah, blah".  So I was, like, "Oh".  So I tried it, I signed up for it, and this is my first time doing it.  [MN]
L:  It's awesome, I think.
R:  I know.  I would never talk to anyone in Texas.  This is cool.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [MN] I'm in -- I -- I like it.  You know, Texas is beautiful.  The lakes are beautiful, you know.  Ah, [NOISE] --
R:  Is it really -- wait, what's the weather today? 
L:  Um, it's sunny and hot and, um, --
R:  Is it really hot? 
L:  -- [several inaudible words], yeah.
R:  It's, like, rainy [LAUGH] today here.
L:  Uh-oh.  Really, in Philadelphia?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's awesome.
R:  We're having weird weather.  It's supposed to be, like, nice today and it's, like, rainy --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- kinda chilly.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. 
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] There's --
L:  Um, --
R:  -- a lot of people here that are from Texas.
L:  -- I think, um, -- I think it's the way it was the other day, it was cold and rainy, and then -- then the next day it was hot as hell.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Um, --
R:  So, [SIGH] do you go on dates and stuff?
L:  [NOISE] Don't have time.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yep, don't have time to do anything.  I'm trying to find a third job in case we -- in case my mom dies or we had to put her up next month and I have to find a [NOISE] third job and I don't have the education like everybody else does, ah, because, like I said, I grew up, um, dyslexic and so they treated me like a mental retard.
R:  Wait, --
L:  And they --
R:  -- what is dyslexia?  Like, what is that?
L:  Um, it's a thing they -- it's when you read things or somebody says something to you and you take it backwards.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You know, and, um, it makes life hell, a living hell, because you don't understand things and you catch on things very, very slowly.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It doesn't mean that you're a mental retard.  It just means that you misunderstand things.  [COUGH]
R:  I think -- but don't everyone do that, like, all the time?  Like, you know how you hear stuff and, like, you hear it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like, even -- no, like me, like, when people say stuff, I'll hear -- I'll say, like, it backwards kind of, like, mix it up.
L:  Yep.
R:  But everyone does that, so, like, -- 
L:  Yeah, I know, but [MN] -- 
R:  You just have it worse --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- like, [MN] --
L:  I -- I --
R:  -- all the time.
L:  -- I had it so weird that [NOISE] people thought I was, ah, you know, mental.
