L:  Hi.  My name is John.
R:  Hi, John.  My name is Bree. 
L:  Bree?
R:  Yeah.
L:  How you doing, Bree? 
R:  Good.  Where -- where are you from, John?
L:  I'm from, uh, Pittman, New Jersey.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Chicago.
L:  Chicago.
R:  Yes.
L:  I talked to somebody in Arizona a little while ago.
R:  Really? 
L:  Yeah.  This is pretty interesting.
R:  Yeah.  This is only the second one I've done, but this topic is really deep.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I don't even know where to start with it because luckily it hasn't affected me too much.  Any of these -- 
L:  Well, it --
R:  -- corporate scandals has not affected me directly.
L:  I don't think it's affected me directly, either, but I think it affects every one of us if we have a 401K or a stock option in our company.
R:  Yeah.  See, I don't have either one of those because I'm self-employed, but -- 
L:  I have both.
R:  Okay, so it does affect you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  And as far as I'm concerned what the government can do with the Enron people and everything else like that, you just lock them up and throw away the key.  I mean, how do you take money out of people's retirement and -- and just [MN] just shrug it off like it's a -- like it's a mosquito?
R:  Yeah, see, I don't know how much the government can change people's moral, um, morality, do you know what I mean?  People's ethics --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's the word I'm looking for, because unfortunately greed is such a, you know, driving force in the world that -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't know what, if anything, the government can do to, you know, to try to, um, curtail this.
L:  Well, I -- I think our government is involved a little bit.  If you look at our big leaders, they have questions among themselves and if you look at Bush and Chaney -- 
R:  You mean questionable dealings themselves or -- 
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, because big business has got to be big for a reason, I mean -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, I mean, I'm sure there is some legitimate businesses out there that grew on their own and just on their own, but unfortunately I think a lot of them traded favors and, um, did a lot of different things to, um, get where they are today.
L:  But I -- I -- I think when they trade favors it only affects the little guys like us.
R:  Right, exactly.  I mean -- and even though this, like Enron or any of those big places has not affected me directly, it's affected the way that I look at -- I mean I'm self-employed.  One of the reasons I'm self-employed is because I don't trust any big businesses.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't -- I don't trust working for a company for thirty years and putting all my heart and sole into it to either lose my job or lose my retirement, you know, so I guess it has affected me and, um, you know, one thing I'll say which sounds a little bit cruel, but something like this happening has at least kind of proven my point. 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah. 
R:  You know.  I mean, like, someone like my dad, who's a lot older, he doesn't understand, like, why I don't have like a typical nine to five job, why I don't go to work -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know, and I've tried to explain to him and when scandals like this come out, then I think maybe people in his age bracket think, "Wow, things aren't the same as when we were working".
L:  Oh, absolutely, and I just talked to the lady before you and that's exactly almost the same thing that's come up.  Way back when, you didn't hear about stuff like this.
R:  Right.
L:  It's only -- it was kept hush hush or it wasn't released to the public or maybe the media wasn't as -- as story hounded as they are today and, you know, I -- I guess it's just the modern world that we live in today, I don't know, and I mean I'm just -- I'm just unsure -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- of -- if this stuff has been happening since Roosevelt and everybody else as president, you know, how -- how did they -- how did they deal with it? 
R:  I don't know, and, like you said, was it happening and it just wasn't spoken about -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or was it not happening? 
L:  Yeah, that's true, too.
R:  You know, because maybe it was just a different time where, you know, people wouldn't, you know, or people would be in the minority to -- to be that way to their -- what that's that movie with Jimmy Stewart, the Christmas movie?
L:  Uh -- 
R:  It's a Wonderful Life.
L:  Yes.
R:  I mean, in some of that there was embezzlement and all, you know, but, um, I don't know, I like to think it's the, um, unusual rather than the norm and I don't know, that's why I'm saying I don't even know if government could do anything or if they even should do anything, because, I mean, [MN] a lot of things don't prevent crime, so I don't know how anything would be -- 
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- prevented unless they just audited every single step of the way and tha- -- 
L:  Right.  Right.  Exactly.
R:  -- and that's just like a whole another layer on top of government things now and, you know -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  I mean -- I mean, the generalized topic that we're talking about is really not so generalized because it -- it involves damn near everything if you really think about it.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I mean, you -- you just -- you don't know when to open your mouth, when to get involved, when to shut up, when to not get involved, you know, i- -- it's -- and -- and I'm sure they go through the same things that we do, but I think that being[?] in their background where most of them -- most of them -- I'm not going to say all of them, but I -- I would say a good percentage of them are attorneys.
R:  Right.  In that -- 
L:  All the elected officials were attorneys at one time.
R:  Right, and if they are not attorneys, then they have very close relationships with attorneys.
L:  Right.  
R:  You know, where someone like I don't, you know, I've never used an attorney in my life, I've never had a reason to, you know, so I don't, you know, I don't have any relationship.  I know, I just think the government, I don't know, we can only get involved in so much.  I mean, you just have to depend on people as people to -- 
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- you know.  [MN] You just did this survey?  Did you just talk to someone else about this or -- 
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then what did they do, call you back or -- 
L:  No, no, no.  You can -- you can call another number.  You can call a number and then ge- -- and get put in a pool and talk to somebody else about the same thing.
R:  Really?  You can call -- 
L:  Yeah, you can do that up to three times.
R:  Three times a day or -- 
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I assume.  That's what it says in my email.  It doesn't say per day but it says up to three calls.
R:  Yeah, and see, I don't know, because I just actually missed one of their calls on my phone.  You know, by the time I picked it up it had already gone into my voice mail --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- so I just called, I said, "Well, let me call" and I don't, you know, I didn't quite understand the way the whole thing -- I mean, I do understand, but I didn't know if -- I thought it was just three, you know, because does anyone know, like, this is getting off the topic, but like how we get paid?  I mean, do they do it on, I mean -- 
L:  Well, you -- you submitted all that information and I'm sure that they'll -- they'll do whatever they got to do, but you can participate in up to three calls, [several inaudible words] lottery and all that stuff, but you, you know, you're supposed to talk about the tub- -- the subject for at least eight minutes of the conversation and so on and so forth.  I mean, this is all new to me, I heard it on the radio, but the interesting part is you never know what the topic is going to be.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, like I said, this is only the second one I've done and the one I did the other day was family, so that was a much more general -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- general topic that I was, you know -- 
L:  And they called you one time for that, right?
R:  Yeah.  Actually, I called in on that one, too, because I just wanted to see how it would work -- 
L:  Aha.
R:  -- and, um, [LIPSMACK] I talked to a -- a young college student and she was very interesting and -- 
L:  Yeah, and you know it -- it -- it -- I -- I guess it's -- I don't know, I guess the purpose is -- I don't know if they monitor or whatever it is, but, you know, who knows, maybe the government has their hands in this, too.
R:  No, I had actually thought of that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's why I thought of that because I said, "Wow", you know, everything looks cool but I don't remember seeing -- 
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- any placing what day we would get a cheque, like what day of what month or anything like that -- 
L:  Right.  Right, and you don't [inaudible] that.
R:  -- and then I'm thinking what if this is all part of a government thing to see how we would react -- 
L:  That's true.
R:  -- to the government should they be controlled.  What if this -- what if we're all, uh, test subjects to see if they need more government regulation.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I mean, we -- we don't know and I guess that's what, you know, that's probably what this survey is about -- 
R:  Hm.
L:  -- to see.
R:  I'm wondering if they just throw out topics to see how two people -- I don't know, I know I'm getting off the topic, but it's -- it's, you know, I mean it -- 
L:  To see how they converse?
R:  Well, exactly.
L:  Yes, that could -- that could very well be true, too.
R:  You know, because -- 
L:  I mean -- I mean it -- it's -- it's very -- it's puzzling, but then again it's sort of like attractive because you don't know who you're talking to, number one, and you don't know what they're going to say, number two.
R:  Oh, yeah, I know.  It -- it's fascinating to -- like, I -- I mean, this particular topic, I mean, you know, I've seen this on CNN and the corporate +scandals s- -- and all that.  Because it hasn't affected me directly, I haven't really -- I've never even given a thought to what the government should do -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- only because it doesn't have any bearing personally on me.
L:  Yes.  Exactly.
R:  You know, if I was somebody obviously involved in Enron or involved -- 
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- in one of these companies, I would be, you know, totally thinking of what the government should do, but -- 
L:  I mean, [MN] in a situation like me I just got my annual performance raise and I got a decent annual por- performance raise and I was willing to -- I was ready to dump a certain percentage in -- of that into my 401K, but then it sort of makes you think if you're dumping it in there, what's -- what's really protecting it?
R:  I know.  That's -- I mean I wonder that, too, even about social security.  That's why I don't know if the government, how they -- you know, it seems like they're having trouble running social security -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- so to start, you know, monitoring pr- --
