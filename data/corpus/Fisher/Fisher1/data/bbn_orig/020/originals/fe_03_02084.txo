R:  My name is Cindy.
L:  Hi, I'm Pasha.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Uh, well ... um [LIPSMACK] I guess, I live up in, uh, British Columbia, Canada --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And, uh, it's close to Vancouver in a city close to Vancouver and it rains a lot here. 
L:  Oh.
R:  And so I think I -- I prefer warm weather --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- because I find it -- going out in the rain ... so depressing all the time because it rains for --
L:  Right.
R:  -- days and weeks on end.  [LAUGH] Can't wait to have the warm weather so you can do something outside.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I live [NOISE] back in Oklahoma --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and we have ... uh [LAUGH] -- we have every season you could possibly have and we could have all four seasons in one month sometimes. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] Wow.
L:   Because our -- our weather changes like crazy, but, um, in the wintertime it can get really, really, really cold.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And in the summertime it can get really, really, really hot [NOISE] so we get the extremes.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um ... I ... I really don't have a preference on warm or cold outdoor act- -- as far as outdoor activities --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because, um, I like a little bit of both.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] Um, I prefer ... the cooler weather but I don't like it real cold and I don't like it really hot --
R:  Right.
L:  I like the cool --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- like the perfect weather. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yes, of course, yeah.  Well, I like --
L:  But I --
R:  No, go ahead.
L:  What were you gonna say?
R:  I was just gonna say that, uh, we really don't get really cold weather here --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, it can get warm in the summer.  It can get --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- sometimes we have really hot summers but it -- it really isn't ... extreme. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, some people like my mom would say, well, the humidity gets to her, whatever, 'cause it gets muggy, but, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's not -- it doesn't get real hot.  I've --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- lived in a place that's been really hot and, you know, some of the places are really cold --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but here it's kinda in between.  It's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just that I have to put up with the rain.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It rains a lot and ... and so on.  And so I guess my -- my favorite ... I -- I love indoor activities too so, you know, when it -- because it's raining so much, I'd rather be inside and when it's sunny out, I like going out and, uh, fixing up the garden or I like going for --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- walks.  I guess that would be my favorite activity would be walking.  I like going out and walking the dog or walking with my kids.  So, that's -- that's one of my favorites.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And you?
L:  Well, I -- I like indoor activities too --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I love playing games, like, board games.
R:  Right.
L:  I l- -- I -- I think that's so fun.  We have, um, family night ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, like, at least once a month, we have family game night with my brother and sister-in-law who live in the same town.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, and as far as, um ... outdoor activities ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, man [SIGH] I don't know.  I like going to the park and walking around.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] I used to like riding my bike but it's not working right now.  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  [LAUGH] Well, I have a bike too but I haven't taken it out yet [LAUGH] so [LAUGH] this -- this year anyways.  But we have a park real close by and it's, uh, it's just got a small lake and, uh, it's really nice and so we -- I love going there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because it's got a playground for the kids so we can go out there.  It's got a large grassy area.  It's got an, uh, outdoor pool in summertime so we --
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  -- like going to the pool in summer and it's a really great park.  You can have a picnic there and --
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  -- it's got -- yeah, if you go all the way round it's about a forty five minute walk all the way around so it's really nice.  There's a lot of people that go out and use the park because of that.
L:  That's nice.
R:  It's a nice park so -- but then, you know, I think a lot of the preferences is -- has to do with, uh, the weather.  
L:  Right.
R:  Like you say, you know, when it's really cold or here when it's rainy, that's when you -- you do indoor ... indoor things, you know, like, with my girls, um, I love playing cards.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so ... um, we might have a -- another couple over and -- and play.  My husband and I and this other couple might play [SIGH] some -- some games, you know, and, uh, or with the girls.  They're playing games.  Like, today we were, uh, putting a puzzle together, one of those 3D puzzles.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I like those.
R:  And so -- yeah.  And so that kinda thing, it's, uh, I think it depends on the weather [LAUGH] what we do.
L:  Yeah.  I, um, I -- I guess this would be considered an activity but I like -- I like going to sporting events --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- [inaudible].
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  Um, we're -- the town I live in is -- their home -- is -- has a college in it and we're fans of the college team and we go to football games, basket -- basketball games, um, baseball games, I mean, we're always going to some sporting event.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And that's fun, I like doing that.
R:  [NOISE] Well, the- that's nice.  That's, uh, that's fun, you know?  I haven't, uh ... [SIGH] I moved around a lot so I guess we've never really gotten into any particular sport.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so we really don't go a lot.  My husband isn't much into sports either so ... um ... we like going to the movies.  We like going to -- if there's a movie we like, we'll go ... uh, to a movie [SIGH].  Um, we're not -- that's about ... if we're not going out, we're going out for a meal.
L:  Right.
R:  And so I guess, in that respect, if -- if we go out at all, it would be for camping or ... or, um, that would be in the summertime of course.
L:  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  We like camping also a lot.
R:  No. [LAUGH] No --
L:  We like to camp.
R:  Well, it's a lot of, uh ... it -- it depends what kind of camping you don't do but anyways ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's not the same as staying at home and it is a big hassle but ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true, but, uh ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it is, once you get, uh, all set up and you get there, you wonder if it's worth it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Um, you said movies.  My husband, um ... is the manager of a -- a movie rental place --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and so -- so we do and- -- one of our big indoor activities is watching movies at home.
R:  Yep, yep.
L:  And I like doing that; it's nice.
R:  We do that a lot too.
L:  Yeah, sit and relax and watch movies.
R:  Yeah, you go and you pick up even some th- -- some that you watched before and enjoyed, you know, and ... and, uh, it turns out that you can relax and generally we get maybe one for the kids or one for us, or if it's the weekend, get a couple of each and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that ... that's enjoyable too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so I guess that -- that's probably one of the ... entertainment fields, you know, that people do a lot -- lot of now.
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  So ... you know, unless we go out to go to a movie, generally it would be only if there's a particular one we want to watch and it might be once a year or a couple of times a year if -- if there's particularly type we like, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  So, that -- but we'll watch movies at home.  We watch them a lot.  You kind of wait -- wait around for -- for them to come out in video or DVD to pick it up, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  We always wait for stuff to come out, unless it's Star Wars.  We have to go and watch all the Star Wars movies on --
R:  That's true, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- because of my husband.  I mean, I like seeing 'em too but he says we have to go. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  Well, it's, uh -- yep.  [SIGH] What about, uh, in wintertime?  Are you like a -- [SIGH] like skiing or that kinda thing, since you have a lot of snow there?
L:  Actually --
R:  You like that kind of outdoor --
L:  -- actually, I've never skied in my life--
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, I like sledding.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Snow sledding; that's fun.
R:  And you --
L:  And, um ... 
R:  Skating?
L:  What?  Do what?
R:  Do you like skating?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Ice skating?
L:  I do like -- I do like ice skating.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  I don't go very often but I like it.
R:  No.
L:  Um ...
R:  Well, I've always been -- uh, we've always lived in an area, although we did live -- when I was younger we lived -- when I was kid, lived in Edmonton and it was really cold there.  And but I only ever skated a couple of times and now that my kids and I've lived ... in the warm climate in Europe for years and so I really didn't get a chance to do skating but now we're getting into it, but my girls really like it.  So, I've taken them quite a few times to -- to learn to skate and they love going.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm too scared [LAUGH] I'm going to fall down.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's not too bad.
R:  But I like taking them out.  Pardon?
L:  It -- it's not too bad ...
R:  No.
L:  -- if you fall. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It's more the fear of what's go- -- could happen, you know than ...?
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  Maybe -- maybe eventually I will ... give it a try.  I think I -- what I did is that the first time I took them out I put them on.  I thought I'd be brave, you know, and ... and I just -- I skated round the edge a little bit and then that was it.  "My feet are killing me.  Let's take 'em off". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And so ... but I like, I guess ...
