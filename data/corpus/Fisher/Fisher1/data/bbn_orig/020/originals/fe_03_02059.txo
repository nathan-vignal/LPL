R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, my name's Amy.
L:  Yes, hi, Amy.  My name is Cynthia.
R:  Well, pleased to meet you.
L:  You too.  So, what type of activities do you like?
R:  I like warm weather, for sure.
L:  Mm.
R:  My hands freeze so fast in cold weather.
L:  Uh, mine too.  [MN] I prefer all type of warm weather, um, sports or any activity outside where it's warm ... as opposed to anything that's cold.  But I do like horseback riding and you don't do that too much when it's really hot though.  [MN] And that's one I like when it's about fall.
R:  Hm. Mhm.
L:  Which is not really too cold time of year.  Um ... you like swimming? [MN]
R:  Yeah, I do.  Don't get to do it much, but yeah I do.
L:  Well, see, down here we can do it any time.  I live in, um, Atlantic City, New Jersey. [MN]
R:  I see.
L:  So, we're right here on the beach, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you can go, like, every day if you want to, you know?  If you can find the time.
R:  Yeah.  I'm in the middle of Michigan.  We get a lot more cold than we do warm.  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- oh, I can imagine.
R:  It's just now starting to get warm.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, it's not really warmed up to down here that much, um, [LIPSMACK] the days are usually kinda mild but the nights are really kind of cold.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it's -- it's not that great yet.  Next month should be a lot better though. [MN] So, what type of activities do you do when it's warm?
R:  Oh, more, um ... picnic, walking, that sorta stuff.  Nothing -- I'm not a very active person generally.
L:  Okay.  So, you don't like volleyball.  Like, we have lakes down here, uh, you can go to the lake and play volleyball or canoeing or something like that.  That's a lot of fun.
R:  Yeah, I like volleyball.  I don't get much of a chance to do it.  I did it in high school but ... I don't get the chance much to do it anymore.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We don't have any organized leagues.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, no, theirs is not organized.  It's -- it's just, like, whoever's there, you know?
R:  Mm. Mhm.
L:  You feel like jumping around, if -- if you're not too embarrassed when the kids beat you and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] you know?  It's something to do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Chase the children around.  Like, I was at the park, um ... at the zoo actually, Kate May[?] zoo ... [LIPSMACK] two days ago.
R:  Mhm.
L:  About a day ago.  We, um, took the kids up there to go to the zoo, so that -- that's like a lot of walking and chasing, you know?
R:  [LAUGH] Uh-huh.
L:  If you have small kids.  But that's nice 'cause they have a playground up there where they can play, so you're doing just as much silly stuff sometimes as the children are, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But that's good.  I like to be out in the fresh where you have fresh grass.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, since I live in the city, basically, you know, it's nice just to be out in the open field.  And I see a whole lot of cement and ... other harsh, you know, elements.
R:  Right.
L:  And the flowers.  And plus you're breathing better.  I do anyway.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So ... I don't know.
R:  We're on the outside of a -- a small little town and where we live, we've got a field in our backyard so [LAUGH] --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- if I -- when I step outside, I'm in fresh air, green grass.  It's nice.
L:  Oh, now, see, here I have an apartment so it's like the only fresh air you really get is if you open up the window.
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  When you go out, you go -- walk right into the parking lot so, it's not like you're going to have a little barbeque or anything in your backyard.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] Still, any time that I have the chance to get away, you know, I get away from here and just be out in the open air.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Other than that, let me see, what other sports do I like?  I think I like the month.  As far as the month, I think August, maybe because I was born then ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  July and August are my favorite two months.  Even though it might be, like, eighty degrees outside, it doesn't really bother me too much.
R:  Mm.
L:  But when it's cool, my nose starts to get cold, my hands are cold.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm -- in the wintertime, it's like I hibernate.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Unless I have to go out of the house, I won't go.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Unless it's in a car, I don't wanna walk anywhere.  It -- it's just too cold for me.  Maybe I don't have enough blood or something, you know?  So, what el- what are your favorite months?
R:  I like fall time.  I like it when it starts to cool down and the breezes are blowing and the colors changing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Colors are beautiful here.  I love --
L:  Uh.
R:  That's one thing I like doing it driving around with my husband seeing the colors.
L:  Mhm.  A lot of trees down there?
R:  Yeah, yeah, quite a bit.
L:  Okay, hm.  So, do you jog?
R:  No, no.
L:  No?
R:  Walk mostly.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I don't either.  I mean ... I'm happy for those who do [LAUGH] but ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I'm not into it to --
R:  It takes more det- determination than I've got.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I -- I'd make it probably halfway down the block and I'd be done, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm totally through here.  And walking, I think I walk more when there's something that I want to buy --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and we walk more in the mall than anywhere else, I think.
R:  Mm, mhm.
L:  So ... I don't know.  There's not too many other sports that I really ... like or -- basketball, I might watch that but I wouldn't play it at this point in life, you know?
R:  My husband and I'll shoot hoops every once and a while.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, we're just out of college and ... no kids yet so we're pretty free as far as time.
L:  Oh, yeah, and you're still young.  I'm, like, forty so ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know [LAUGH] I'm not jumping around too much playing basketball.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  We- we'll play with the tiniest one [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it may spruce your ego because you win, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But that's about it.  Um, I love to watch it and go see it, but that's about it, and softball ... [MN] I -- I never got into softball too much.  I mean, it looks like fun but me and the bat just didn't get along.  The bat -- uh, I could never hit anything so --
R:  But -- me neither.  I don't have the hand eye coordination for it.
L:  No.  I mean, the ball is coming in -- in and I don't know.  I just don't seem to see it like other people do.
R:  [LAUGH] I'd rather dodge it than anything.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  I really would, [LIPSMACK] but those are -- there's not too many sports now ...
R:  No.
L:  -- I mean, where people live at now, it's not ... they're not readily accessible, like, in people's areas now.  You have to always travel to go somewhere.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do they have a lot of recreation places down there?
R:  No, we've got a few tiny little parks with a bench but nothing ...
L:  Nothing really big?
R:  No, no.
L:  Yeah, now I'm like -- down here they're constantly on the casino thing which they consider that recreation, you know?
R:  Hm.
L:  I don't, but they -- they do, 'cause we have a -- oh, a tremendous amount of people that come down here ... and that's the only recreation down here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That and the boardwalk which, um, that's good for the kids, the rides.  But other than that, there's not too many sports.
R:  Yeah.
L:  At this point.  So, what do you think you'll be doing in your future as far as sports when you get about thirty?
R:  I don't know.  Probably not much.  With -- with my husband and I's lifestyle, my husband's an evangelist and we, um -- he goes round and preaches at different churches and we sing together and I play piano for him --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and because of our lifestyle we're just ... we'll never know wh- where we'll be next.  We're not fixed i- in any place so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Trying to --
L:  So, you constantly travel?
R:  Pretty much.  Pretty much --
L:  Really?
R:  -- every weekend we're somewhere and then we- we'll have quite a few weeks in the year where we're at one place for a week.
L:  Mhm.  That must be pretty exciting?
R:  It is.  It's a neat life.
L:  Yeah.  We do that in the summer.  Um, I think the last August I was down in Merlin[?].  Bishop Mairs[?] had his -- I think he's from Tennessee, isn't he?  Or near there?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, we went to his conference down there for a week.  That was really nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that was great, and met a lot of different people there.  And that's like recreation for me, you know?  Once a year we go to a conference and stay a week.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's basically recreation nowadays. 
R:  Yeah.  That's one thing I'm concerned about for our kids.  When -- when we, um, since we're in it fulltime, how am I gonna have activities for the kids --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with as much as we're traveling.  It would be nice to have some sort of -- to -- you know, every time we go to have some sort of open gym, that sort of thing but --
L:  Right, where they can run and play and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- everything.  I know that's kinda hard because my son, he doesn't ... there's not really too many things down here for him to do --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and since we -- uh, since I keep him in church, we're a church family, um, he doesn't get involved in other things like other kids do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it's really not -- mostly what he does is in the house, or mostly schedule a trip to go to the zoo or something like that, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they really don't get that much recreation in school.  Not nowadays.  I mean, gym is like twenty minutes a week or something.
R:   Mm. Mhm.
L:  So, I don't know.  Maybe ev- everybody needs more exercise, I guess.  The most exercise he gets is like his Playstation, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And a computer.
R:  Thumb exercise. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you know?  [LAUGH] "I got it, mom, see?" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Flex those muscles. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  But so I -- I don't know.  I guess we could do more b- oh, I do go fishing.
R:  Mm?  Mhm.
L:  Maybe -- I go fishing -- I take my son fishing maybe twice in the summer because we live on the water, so there's like a bay here.
R:  Yeah, that'd be nice.
L:  Yeah, I gotta sit out there and I swing my feet while he tries to catch the fish so --
R:  [LAUGH] Uh-huh.
L:  You know, that's pretty much ...  We sometimes catch something and sometimes we don't.
R:  Yeah.  We -- we live in a ... sort of quieter neighborhood in the -- in the street, not many cars, so every evening we try to get out, my husband and I, and take a walk ...l
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the evenings, but that's -- that's about it.
L:  Oh, I would love to live like that.
R:  It is really nice.
L:  Actually, I'm -- I'm looking for a house now.  I'm getting ready to get married in June so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we're looking for a house, like, out of the city, you know?  Like, central Jersey actually.  I'm in south Jersey now, so I'm looking at central Jersey.  Some place where there's grass and he can have a dog and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- go out and play.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, where he can just chase the dog --
