R:  Hello? 
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's --
L:  Hi.
R:  -- Mary.
L:  Ah, my name's Nick.
R:  Hi, and I'm from Pennsylvania. 
L:  I'm from, ah, um, Ohio, Cleveland, so, -- 
R:  Oh, okay, not too --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- far away at all.  I'm from Pittsburgh.
L:  Excuse me? 
R:  I'm from Pittsburgh, so, -- 
L:  Oh, yes, you're not far.
R:  No, not at all.
L:  Neighboring cities.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Ah, so, what's the weather like th- -- [MN] like there now? 
R:  Right now it's probably about sixty, but it's [MN]--
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- pretty overcast.
L:  Yeah, it's [MN] been -- it's been a little chilly recently --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- here.  So, I mean, obviously the -- the weather's just been back and forth, so, -- 
R:  Oh, yeah, everyone's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- been sick.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  So, what do you -- which do you prefer, hot or cold? 
R:  I think --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- probably as I get older probably more warm activities.  When we were --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- little and growing up we went skiing constantly --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and sledding and that.  But now I'm starting -- and then [MN] when I got married too, my husband didn't ski, so we've kind of [LAUGH] gotten --
L:  Right.
R:  -- away from all the cold stuff and starting to -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- like warm stuff better.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  How about you? 
L:  Um, you know, I -- I -- it's -- it's -- I always ki- -- I get tired of the weather eventually, whether it's hot or cold.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Once it's sum- -- once it's been summer for a while, I can't wait for winter, I can't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- wait for the snow.  And then after it's been winter for a while, I can't wait for the spring and the summer.  So, um, I'm not sure -- like, obviously right now I'm looking forward for summer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, ah, -- 
R:  Yeah, it's nice.  That's nice about this area, is that you get to see a nice change in seasons.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, I've a lot of friends that live in Florida and that and, yeah, it's --
L:  [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  -- it's too hot.
L:  -- seasons it's always hot.
R:  I don't like the extremes, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.  Yeah, ex- extremes are bad.  I mean, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you -- you don't want it to be too cold or too hot all the time.
R:  No.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK] But, yeah, I mean, obviously the activities are -- are dependent on the weather as well.
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  I mean, yeah, so, you don't know, ah, -- I mean, it depends on what you like to do outside.  I mean, [NOISE] some things require cold weather and some require --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- warm, so, -- 
R:  Right, yeah. 
L:  Right.
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  What? 
R:  Oh, no.  Well, my warm activities [inaudible], um, I like to bike a lot.  We've been --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they just put in bike trails not, you know, -- not too far from us.  So, we've been, you know, -- looking forward to doing that, and that's nice -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the fall.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, we just bought a house.  So, we have a ton of yard work.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  And [inaudible] different house projects to come.  So, I'm looking forward to doing that too.
L:  Right.  Yeah, ah, recently I've been walking a lot [inaudible].  It -- it doesn't really matter on the w- -- matter on the weather, ah, whether it's hot or cold, I walk quite a bit.  So, -- 
R:  Yeah, we just got a puppy, so we've been walking like crazy.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and -- yeah, that's -- that's always good.  I re- -- I read a quotation the other day that said, ah, "There's no such thing as bad weather, only inappropriate clothing". 
R:  That's right.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, you know, -- and I guess, you know, it depends on what you're wearing.  I mean, people could say it's cold but, I mean, you can always dress warmer or dress lighter.
R:  Oh, yeah, you alway got to dress in layers.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, we've been -- because, like I said, we just got a dog so and -- when we moved into this house it's nice because it has sidewalks and that, so we've been walking like crazy trying to wear him out.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  
R:  And outside playing ball and that so, -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  But, um, -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] [inaudible] As far as vacations and that go, I prefer to go to the beach probably than -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- than, you know, --
L:  -- I think most people do --
R:  Yeah.  But, ah, --
L:  -- [MN] prefer to go to warmer climates. 
R:  Yeah, I think so.  [inaudible] Well, my --
L:  People don't generally --
R:  -- my --
L:  Yeah, go ahead.
R:  -- my brother, he's totally opposite.  He just spent -- he just went to, um, [LIPSMACK] [MN] Montana for a couple of weeks and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they got, you know, a f- -- a foot -- a couple feet of snow overnight, and he --
L:  Right.
R:  -- loved it.  He's a big snowboarder.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, he was in heaven.  But, [LAUGH] like, ah, I don't think that's for me.
L:  Yeah, I was just going to say, you know, generally people don't vacation in the Arctic or anything.
R:  No.  [LAUGH]
L:  They just --
R:  No [MN].
L:  They generally want to go to warmer climates.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.  Yep.
R:  And we, um, -- we just recently started going to, like, -- we've been to Bermuda and stuff like where the beaches are nice and the water's nice and calm.
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  Like, around -- you know, we've been -- growing up we spent a lot of time in the outer banks and stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  But I don't like rough water.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] My dad, brother, they were -- you know, they loved it, but my mom and I just, like, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- walk along the ocean.
L:  There's nothing quite like, you know, warm water and w- --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- and warm weather.
R:  [SIGH] No.
L:  You know, [MN] it just -- it just feels great, and the warm oceans --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- pa- particularly.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  That's great.  Um, yeah, I've travelled a lot myself, so, --
R:  Have you?
L:  -- and, um, yeah.  Obviously warmer climates.  But, you know, in -- in the extremes there's always the extremes so, -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah, so, --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, we just --
L:  Do--
R:  -- um, just started snorkeling and stuff, so, -- 
L:  That's great, yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's r- -- it's awesome.
L:  See a lot of fish and all that.
R:  Oh, yeah.  [MN] We -- we're with -- we went to Bermuda.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that was the first time I had snorkeled.  That was a few years ago.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's funny because we took this group run, you know, snorkel trip and, you know, you go out in a boat and y- -- everybody jumps in.  But there's like fifty people, you know, and none of them have ever done it and you're getting smacked in the head -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- with flippers and all this stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so we're like, "I can't believe we, you know, pay all this money to go on this trip" and -- [LAUGH] and you just, you know, spent the whole time defending yourself against other people.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, so, um, -- then we find this place that's called Snorkel Park and it looks, you know, -- it's all run down, it looks totally tacky and -- [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the beach looked really bad.  But it's, you know, like, "Here's your five dollars for your snorkel and fin and everything" and so you have to, like, wade in through all these really bad rocks, but then you swim through this little -- little channel.
L:  Ahah.
R:  And it was absolutely amazing.  We spent hours out there.  [MN] Like fish were just huge and it was -- it was the best trip ever.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah, and [SIGH] we thought, oh, -- 
L:  Yeah, I've been snor- -- I've been snorkeling a few times.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, it's -- it's great because it's not as, like, involved as scuba diving would be.
R:  No.
L:  But it's just kind of -- and it doesn't require much effort, you know.
R:  No.
L:  So, it- -- it's -- it's -- and just -- just the amount of things you see just -- I mean, you just look all around you and you see all s- -- all s- -- all sorts of things.
R:  Oh, yeah, it's really cool.
L:  Yeah, it's great.
R:  Yeah, my husband, he wants to get into scuba, but that's -- that's a little too much for me.  [LAUGH] I like to be --
L:  Excuse me? 
R:  My husband, he wants to do scuba diving.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But that's -- I don't know.  That's -- 
L:  It -- it takes a lot of training.  Like you need to get a --
R:  It really does.
L:  -- certified -- 
R:  And I'm not, like, the best swimmer.  I prefer just to, you know, -- [LAUGH]
L:  Stay on the surface.
R:  Yeah, and I like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I like when you can, like, walk into the ocean and snorkel -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- instead of just jumping, you know, off the end of a boat in the middle of nowhere.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  I like -- [LAUGH] I like to just take it easy.
L:  Mhm.  Last time I went scuba diving -- oh, scuba diving -- went snorkeling --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I actually saw a sh- -- um, a shark.  I mean, it was --
R:  Really? 
L:  -- like a harmless --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kind of shark, but it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- was just scary nonetheless, you know.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You- -- your fear- -- your fears get the best of you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you just kind of go back to the boat.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, we've -- we've snorkeled in Bermuda and, um, went to Grand Cayman.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, I just got married, like, two years ago and we went to Hawaii and, so, that wasn't -- that wasn't as easy as Grand Cayman and that just because the water's really rough -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in Hawaii.  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, it's cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But this year no big planned [LAUGH] vacations unfortunately.  [SIGH] We, um, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Since we just bought the house and that we're just going to stick close to home.
L:  That's good.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I'm, ah, going to Ecuador this summer -- 
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  -- as part -- as part -- part of a retreat.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  So, for -- for ten days.  We're --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- I mean, it's -- it's not exactly vacationing but, you know, --
R:  No, but --
L:  -- it'll -- it'll be interesting, though.  I mean, we're going to live in a village for ten days essentially -- 
R:  Is this with --
L:  Um, --
R:  -- a church or --
L:  Um, it's for a s- -- a school group.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But, it's a group called, ah, [several inaudible words] christo, which means face of -- face of Christ -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- which -- I'm not a religious person myself -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I think it'll be interesting to --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, live among the poor, just, ah, g- give me a new outlook on things pretty much.
R:  Oh, yeah, that'll be amazing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  So, yeah, and that's my big thing for the summer -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- pretty much.
R:  Is this -- is this first trip out of the country or -- 
L:  Excuse me? 
R:  Is this the first -- your first trip out of the country? 
L:  Oh, no, I've --
R:  No.
L:  -- I've been out of the country, ah, a lot of times.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I lived in Africa for three years, actually.
R:  Really?  Oh, wow. 
L:  Yeah.  Ah, [LIPSMACK] my parents took a, um, position with, ah, [several inaudible words].
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  And, so, we lived there for three years.
R:  Oh, that's aw- --
L:  It was when I was younger though, so, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I was like eight years old to --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- eleven years old.  But I still remember it well.
R:  Oh, yeah.  That's something you never forget.
L:  Yeah.  And since then I've travelled quite a bit.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, our biggest trip was to Australia.  We went there --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- for a few weeks.  I actually had a pen pal I started writing to when I was in second grade.
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  And, um, yeah.  And so we had never talked or anything and then a few years ago we'd saved up enough frequent flier miles and everything.  We decided, "Let's just go ahead and do it".  And so I called her up -- 
L:  Wow, that's -- 
R:  -- and I said, "We're coming".  [LAUGH]
L:  You -- you met up with your pen pal? 
R:  Yeah, that was the first time I met her.
L:  Wow, that's great.
R:  Yeah, that was like --
L:  Since second grade? 
R:  Yeah, since second --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- grade we wrote and then -- and we never talked or never sent email or anything.  We always just like writing letters and -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- then, you know, we got to meet.  And so then --
L:  That's great.
R:  Yeah.  So, that was -- that --
L:  Yeah, I'd love to go to Australia.
R:  Oh, it's beautiful.
L:  It's just -- it's so exotic.  Like, I --
R:  It really is.
L:  -- I just think of all the --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I just think of Australia as, like, yeah, exotic.
R:  Yeah, [MN] I'd --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- love to go back because we stayed in more like on the east coast and, well, we -- she lived in Sydney, so we spent a week there with her and, um, it's amazing city, but it's -- it's still a city.  Like, I wanted to go see more, you know, of the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- outback kind of stuff and that.
L:  Right.
R:  And then we spent like a week round the Great Barrier Reef and that.
L:  That's great.
R:  That was --
L:  Did you go snorkeling there? 
R:  Yeah, we did there too.
L:  That's great.
R:  We took --
L:  Oh, yeah, I'd love to see the Great Barrier Reef.
R:  Oh, that was amazing.  The -- the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- coolest part, though, was when we were leaving and, um, you flew over, like, the barrier reef.  The water --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- is just crystal clear and [MN] you could just see, ah, -- oh, it was amazing.
L:  Yeah, that's what I hear.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that'd be great.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, hopefully -- and then she came back -- ah, we got married two thousand and one, and she came back here to be in my wedding.
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  So, now she said --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it's my turn --
