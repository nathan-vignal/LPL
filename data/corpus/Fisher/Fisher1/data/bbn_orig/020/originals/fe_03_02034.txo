L:  Hi.  Ah, my name is Geoff and --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- ah, [LAUGH] how you doing?
R:  I'm good too.  My name's Lisa.
L:  How you doing, Lisa?
R:  I'm doing okay.  
L:  Um, is this your first time doing this?
R:  Yes.  I've never done this before.
L:  Me neither.  Okay, well, um, I don't know, I guess I like warm weather activities.
R:  So do I.
L:  Why?
R:  I, um, -- I do not like the cold at all. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  As I've gotten older I've, ah, liked the warm weather a lot better and I've just gotten on a motorcycle.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, you'd better be careful driving those things around.
R:  Well, right now I'm on the back, but I'm really, really, really interested in learning how to ride myself.
L:  What kind of bike do you want to get?
R:  I want a Harley.
L:  Really.
R:  There's no other [LAUGH] bike out there.
L:  I've a couple of questions about those.  Why do they always have to be so loud?
R:  Ah, they change the pipes on them.
L:  Right.  So why do they -- 
R:  Th- -- 
L:  -- do that?  I hate that.
R:  They like it.  I -- 
L:  But -- 
R:  -- guess they like it.
L:  But -- I mean, don't they understand that it wakes me up and, you know, -- 
R:  I think it -- 
L:  -- bothers people? [LAUGH]  
R:  I think it's a male thing. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  So i- --
R:  The bigger and louder the toy it is. 
L:  Right.  I don't know.  Some kind of psychological thing going on there, I think.  [COUGH] So, are you going to get your own bike?
R:  I would like to, but i- it's not going to be a Harley at first.  I can't afford that right now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, they go for about fifteen grand [NOISE] -- 
L:  Well, I -- 
R:  So I think I --
L:  Ahah.
R:  I think I may just get, like, a Yamaha just to start out on.
L:  Do [MN] -- I -- I don't mean this to be sexist, but I know that, um, you know, big bikes are really, really heavy, right, so do you think --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that Harley even makes something, you know -- I mean, what's their smallest thing?  A five hundred? 
R:  Ah, their smallest is a Buell[?], and it's, ah, probably less than a five hundred. 
L:  Oh, okay.  So you could handle that easily? 
R:  Maybe.  Now, this is the other thing I want to go to Harley and find out.  I'm only five foot.
L:  Oh.
R:  So that's my problem.
L:  Yeah.  Might not be able to reach those clutches down there.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH], I might --
L:  You have to put those blocks on your shoes.
R:  -- not even be able to reach the ground. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [COUGH] Um, -- 
R:  Wh- where you from?
L:  I'm from Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, wow!  I grew up in South Jersey.
L:  Oh, where are you now?
R:  I'm in Lancaster.
L:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE] Um, yeah, unfortunately I'm not living in Philadelphia now.  I live in West Chester, but -- 
R:  Okay. 
L:  -- I'm finishing my masters in TESL.
R:  In what? 
L:  TESL, teaching English as a second language.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [COUGH] Um, so, wait, I'm going to go back to the bike thing.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, so y- -- have you ever ridden one -- I mean by yourself? 
R:  No, not by myself.  I have no idea what to do.  That's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- why I want to take the class. 
L:  Yeah.  I did learn how to ride them a long time ago.  I was going --
R:  Did you?
L:  -- to get one, but I chickened out, you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, my parents threatened to disown me when I was -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I was, like, right out of high school and I really wanted to get one --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so ...  One of my pop's friends died on one, so he was really against me getting one.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So ...  I was going to -- 
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- get a Suzuki, I think.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like a five hundred or something, I forget. 
R:  Mhm.  
L:  [NOISE] Mm. 
R:  Yeah, I have -- I mean, I don't even know how to -- to go about going. 
L:  What do you mean?
R:  I mean, I drive -- I drive a stick shift car and I figured it's got to be something close to that.
L:  Yeah, a little bit.  I mean, it's -- it's completely different, obviously.  I mean, the idea's the same, but how you -- how you manipulate it, it's completely different, obviously.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know.  You know, it's hands and feet instead of -- I mean, it's hands and feet anyway, right.
R:  Right.
L:  It's -- I think the -- the motor skills are smaller. 
R:  Okay.
L:  You know what I'm saying?
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, anyway.  I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  But, yeah, I get on the back and I'm just happy.
L:  Yeah.  Um, but don't you ever feel, you know, a little bit afraid.
R:  No.  Never.
L:  Okay.  That's good.  So --
R:  I mean, we really --
L:  -- are you like a --
R:  -- don't take it out on the highway.  We always go back roads.  Lancaster is, you know, all farm country.
L:  Sure.
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  But you have to avoid all that, you know, horse dung and stuff?
R:  Yeah, road apples.  [LAUGH]
L:  Road apples. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I have a bicycle, actually.  Like, --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm a big -- I -- I hate driving, so I don't have a car.  So I just ride my bicycle everywhere.  So I can understand, you know, your love for bikes and stuff.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I've -- I had a bike just about all my life, and I gave it up for the car.  
L:  Mm. 
R:  Now I've gotten lazy as I've gotten older and get in the car and go.
L:  Yeah.  I don't want that to happen.  I'm like a city boy, so -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  A --
R:  And I'm the opposite.  I'm a -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- country girl.
L:  Yeah, I can't stand it out -- like, I'm actually kind of in the country now -- not in the country, it's like a small town, but you have to -- you have to drive everywhere, but if --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you don't have a car it's really annoying.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I have to either ride my bike or take the bus.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I just feel isolated out here, you know.
R:  Do you go into Philly at all? 
L:  Yeah, I always do.  There's a bus that takes me in there, so, I mean, a hang out there all the time.
R:  Mhm, and gr- --
L:  I have -- oh, I am sorry. 
R:  Growing up in, ah, Jersey I really never got a chance to go to Philly even though I was so close.  My parents were pretty strict --  
L:  Ah, amazing.
R:  -- and last year I finally got to go to South Street.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, you know, I used to live two blocks from there, you know, so -- actually, I hated South Street, you know.
R:  Did you really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Usually when you're close you don't like it.
L:  Well, it's -- it's -- I don't know, I think my style wasn't really South Street, you know what I mean. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  It was -- like I kind a -- I'm into a kind of different aesthetic, you know what I mean?
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ...  South Street was too loud for me.  I like the kind of different groups --
R:  Well, you should be out here in Lancaster.  It's very quiet -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and slow.
L:  I like -- I like loud but a different kind of loud, you know what -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean?  Like, ah, -- I don't know, it's kind of hard to explain.  Um, --
R:  Like music?
L:  Yeah, you know, like South Street is kind of -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  It's just kind of ostentatious, you know.   
R:  Mhm.
L:  People want to be looked at, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But that's not my style, you know.  I don't -- I really don't like that, so ...
R:  Wh- what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kind of music are you into?
L:  I like indie rock and jazz.
R:  Okay.
L:  Do you know what -- do you know what indie rock is?
R:  Indie, ind- -- industrial?
L:  No.  
R:  What's that? 
L:  Independent.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's kind of like bands that you've probably never heard of probably.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I like more the alternative.  
L:  Yeah, but it -- it's kind of like deep alternative.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's like, um, for example, bands like Superchunk.  Have you ever heard of Superchunk? [LAUGH]
R:  No.
L:  Yeah, or Portastatic[?]? 
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  Or Built to Spill, Yo La Tengo, you know, things -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- like that that nobody knows unless you are in a certain kind of group --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know what I mean.  A little -- whatever you call it.  So, yeah, Modest Mouse, things like that. [LAUGH] 
R:  Hell, you must have all that down in Philly.
L:  Yeah, yeah, sure.  Um, so what other little outdoor activities do you like? 
R:  Um, I like the beach.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I could live on the beach.
L:  Why did you move from South Jersey?  I mean, you were --
R:  I don't know.   
L:  -- close to the beach.
R:  I got married, and I --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- moved further out this way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, I've been -- usually in the summer months I, ah, go to the Bahamas or Jamaica or something --  
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I [inaudible] --
R:  -- and I just want to be there.
L:  Yeah.  I just got back from the Dominican Republic, actually.
R:  How was that?
L:  It was okay.  I mean, I've been to better countries, but it was pretty fun.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, they had some pretty good beaches.
R:  What else do you do out- outside?
L:  Um, I used to be quite an ath- -- well, sort of an athlete, you know.  I played a lot of basketball --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- played a lot of baseball, a lot of football.  So I like to do those things.  But these days I -- I tore my ACL playing football --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- this fall in, like, the first game, our first -- the -- 
R:  Oh! 
L:  -- first [inaudible] got hurt.  So I haven't really done much since then, you know.  It's kind of depressing.  And now I'm getting so old that it's not healing. 
R:  [LAUGH] I'm older than you! 
L:  Yeah, but, ah, I just -- I just -- I could feel that I was slowing down, you know. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, I hadn't played in a while because I was overseas for a while, and then I came back and tried to play the same way and I just wasn't as good anymore, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I lost [inaudible].  It was really depressing.
R:  Oh, my -- my son has tried every sport, and he's just -- he just can't find his niche.  I don't --  
L:  How old is he?
R:  -- think sport's for him.  He's twelve.
L:  Ahah.
R:  He's tried soccer and wrestling and football and --
L:  And he wasn't --
R:  -- he quit all of them.  In football he didn't want to hit anybody.  I'm like, "Well, that's part of it".  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He didn't want -- 
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- to do the practice. He just wanted to play the game.
L:  Yeah.  Well, you know, that's [NOISE] -- that's -- that's what I wanted to do, too.  What about soccer?
R:  Um, he did [NOISE] try soccer, and after he made his first goal he said, "This is it.  I'm done with that". 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well --
L:  Well, maybe he's more left brained, you know, like maybe artistic.
R:  Maybe.  He said he wanted to try softball now, and I said, "Well, Vince, you should've tried that, you know, when you were younger, not get into --"   
L:  No, I don't think so.  
R:  "-- it right now". 
L:  It's not too late.
R:  You don't -- 
L:  I don't think -- 
R:  -- think so?
L:  -- it's too late.  No.
R:  Oh, maybe I -- 
L:  And -- 
R:  -- should let him.  
L:  Push him to baseball, though, instead of softball. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, don't push him.  I don't mean that.  But, I mean, you know, baseball is, I don't know, better than softball.  It's a lot better than softball.
R:  Now, do they actually have that at his age?
L:  Baseball?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- of course.  I played baseball.
R:  Because usually when -- when you see it it's always softball.
L:  Really?
R:  I -- I don't know.  That's what I'm asking.
L:  No, no, there should be little leagues right in --  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- your area.  You know, --  
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and then, you know, he'll get good and he can play in high school maybe, for his high school team.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] It'll be great.
R:  Well, he's going to be going into seventh grade, so I'll give him a couple of years.
L:  Yeah, um, yeah, that'd be good, I hope, for him.  But, you know, whatever.  Ah, -- 
R:  But, I mean, he's -- he's -- I feel he can do other things that he does better.  Like he'll sit down and he'll play a game of chess or --  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he'll beat you.  [MN] So ... 
L:  Yeah, that's what I mean: maybe he's more intellectual or artistic --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [inaudible].  So that -- that's good too, you know.  It's probably better.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I wish I was more like that, you know.
R:  At least he won't get hurt. [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah, right, and then you can probably use that in the future better than baseball, you know what I mean.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  You know, [MN] it was great when I was a kid playing baseball at the time, but, you know, [NOISE] maybe I could have --  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, maybe it would've been better if I had studied more or something.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Ahah.  When do you graduate? 
L:  Um, in two weeks.
R:  Wow, really?  This year?
L:  Yeah, so --  
R:  Great.
L:  -- um, I'm pretty happy about that.  I just -- I just -- we just had our final tests and I passed, luckily.
R:  Great.
L:  So now I'm going probably move to New York -- New York City in the fall.
R:  Ahah.
L:  And, ah, teach up there in the public s- school system.
R:  Yeah, they need some good teachers out there.
L:  Yeah.  And I --
