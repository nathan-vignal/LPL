R:  Hi, how're you?
L:  Good.  How're you?
R:  Good.
L:  That's good. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, we're supposed to talk about what kind of things we like to do ... is that right?
R:  Yeah, I guess ... outdoor activities, I think.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, ver- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  Which was kinda cool because I just had some outdoor activities today.
L:  Oh, that's good.  What did you do today?
R:  I took my -- I have a one year old daughter and I took her out to a park and she went on the swing for the first time. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's good -- uh, what part of the country do you live in?
R:  I live, uh, near Tacoma, Washington.
L:  Oh, really?  Oh.
R:  We've been in the news lately.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  We -- we just moved from Bellingham, Washington.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, we just moved down to Oregon, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!
L:  So, yeah.  So, yeah, it was -- been raining all day here so we didn't really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get to do any outdoor activities.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But --
R:  So, do you go skiing or anything or ...?
L:  Yeah, I ski.  Um, I -- I love playing in the snow.  I love doing snow stuff, but not for long periods of time.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It -- it gets too cold sometimes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to enjoy yourself so ...
R:  Yeah, I'm from the east coast so we used to be able to go skiing and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I do cross country skiing.
L:  Oh, cool.  Well, that's good.
R:  Yeah.  I'm looking -- I'm moving back there in a couple a months.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  So, it'll be kinda fun to be able to go back and do some of that stuff 'cause I haven't for a while. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Do you -- do you like any, like, hot weather things?  Or is it just like ...
R:  Um ...
L:  -- do you like snowy stuff better?
R:  I think I probably prefer warm weather.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, me too.  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  I just try to stay inside in the winter. [LAUGH]
L:  Yep, yeah [LAUGH].  It's too mushy.  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Yeah, we have a -- we have a boat so we like to go boating in the summer.
L:  Oh, that's good.  That would be nice.
R:  And I guess we can do that in winter around here too but it's just not as fun. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  [LAUGH] Rain --
R:  More to rain and -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, wearing your rain -- rain jackets and boating. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Uh, well, that would be fun, boating.  Do you do, like --
R:  What --
L:  -- gardening --
R:  -- is there to do around Portland?
L:  Um, I don't know.  We just moved here like two months ago. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  But there's -- there's -- actually there's a lot of, um, like, gardens and stuff like that.  There's like these Japanese gardens and Chinese gardens that -- beautiful right now, so that's kinda nice.  We've seen those so ... it's at least something to do outdoors. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, not really --
R:  There's a lot out there.  I don't get out as much as I used to. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know, me too, yeah.  I have a four year old and a six year old so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- my activities are pretty much limited [LAUGH] to -- yeah.
R:  There's a lot of stuff you can do with kids though.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  It makes it more fun sometimes. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  There's -- uh, down here there's a lot of museums and stuff like that too.  Like, for kids -- kids museums and hands on things, so that's kinda cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Doing the hands on stuff with them.  They really like that a lot so ...
R:  Do they get into any kind of sports or stuff like that that they do outside?
L:  Yeah.  Um, my -- my six year old is, um, in t-ball and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I think that's -- that's the only real sport that we've had them in.  H- he does soccer for fun, like with his friends and stuff like that but ... that's -- that's about it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Not really very much that they do outdoors anymore so it's been too --
R:  Well, we live in an apartment so we spend a lot of time inside because ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there isn't a playground here and not really any grass or anything.  It's mostly just, you know, the parking lot and the street and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- our apartment so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's how our place is right now too.  This place we just moved in to.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  So, sometimes I like to take them to the park or something just to see some grass on the weekend.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  And the least time she's in daycare and they have a nice yard and everything.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's good.  Uh ... uh.  How -- how old is she?  Is this your -- one year?
R:  [NOISE] Yes.  She's just turned one on Thursday.
L:  Oh, that's good.  How fun.  [LAUGH] Does she -- she like the swing, then?
R:  Oh, she loved the swing.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  Yeah, she was [LAUGH] laughing ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the whole time she was swinging.
L:  [LAUGH] That's good.  That's cool.  Ooh, well, heck.  Ooh.
R:  Then we went for a walk around so we -- I can -- I don't know if you've heard of Pearce College?
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  In [inaudible].
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Yeah.  So, they have a nice, um ... nice little park type place with a little lake and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- lots of trails and stuff around it.
L:  Oh, that's cool then.
R:  So, yeah, a lot of people go out there with their dogs and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  We just spent it -- my step -- my stepdaughter ... over there today and ... we just walked around the lake.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's kinda nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Has it been sunny a lot there?  Or was today --
R:  Um, okay.  It wasn't really that sunny but ... 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- kinda foggy, you know, but it wasn't raining so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Getting off the rain. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but -- yeah, exactly. [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  So, was it actually raining down there all day?
L:  It's actually -- yeah, we've been here for two months and the first twenty two days we were here it rained straight. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no. [LAUGH]
L:  It was like in the news and everything.  [LAUGH] But I think we've had, um, it totaled up to be seven days total --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that it hasn't rained. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, it's been pretty cruddy.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But that's okay [LAUGH].  It's very beautiful here though. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's very green.
R:  In time, like, you just don't [NOISE] like, don't even notice the rain sometimes 'cause it's always raining.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, and we're from Bellingham too.  It's not like it's all that different really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  In -- but th- actually the one thing here, it hails, like, all the time.  It hailed twice today.  It -- it's --
R:  Really?
L:  I've never seen it hail so many times.  [LAUGH] It's really weird.  It's -- it's hailed quite a few times in the two months since we've been here.
R:  Well, one thing I thought was kind of unusual, I seem to -- I can't remember if it was yesterday or the day before ... there was a big thunder outside.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  This one -- you know, just one.
L:  Oh, no. [LAUGH]
R:  But they told me there were thunderstorms around here so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I almost didn't recognize the sound.  I was like, "What the heck was that?" [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, something blowing up or something? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Oh, that's weird.
R:  But hav- I don't know.  I guess, the way the mountains are there's just ...
L:  Yeah, it doesn't get over there.
R:  You know.
L:  Oh, that -- that would be kinda freaky [LAUGH] at first.  Not knowing what it is. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I remember an outdoor activity I used to like when I was little.  We always had thunderstorms in the summertime.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  My sister and I, whenever, you know, it was a hot, hot summer day ... and then, you know, you'd hear the thunder or whatever and you're like --
L:  Mm. [LAUGH]
R:  -- yay!  So, we used to run outside when it was pouring with rain, we'd run outside and splash puddles and stuff and all -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow, that would be cool. [LAUGH]
R:  Run around. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  It felt so good when -- when the rain came when it was so hot like that, you know?
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And I heard it's really -- I -- I've never been on the east coast but I heard it's really humid over there too, so the rain probably feels good sometimes.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I can get to be very humid. [NOISE] Uh-oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Are you still there?  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Good.  Was that my phone clipped to my pocket.  She was pressing my buttons. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] Are there any indoor activities that you like to do at all?
R:  Um ...
L:  Mostly -- mostly outdoor stuff?
R:  Well, you know, cleaning ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah [LAUGH] all the fun stuff. [LAUGH]
R:  [inaudible] [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Very fun. [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Although, actually, we did have fun playing with the ball today inside.
L:  Oh, yeah?  That's good then.
R:  Yeah.  She's figured out how to throw a ball back to me after I threw it to her.
L:  Oh, good.
R:  We were very happy about that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  A lot of fun. [LAUGH]
L:  That's cool.  [LAUGH] It's so fun when they're at that age and just learning how to do things and watching you and learning from you.  It's so cool.  It's fun.
R:  And then we have this little car that she got for her birthday that I just strap her into and drive it around the apartment. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, cool.  Does she like that a lot?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, we can do that right now.  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, honey, get in your pink car.  We're going for a ride.
L:  [LAUGH] That's cool.
R:  That's how we can get our exercise inside.
L:  Yeah, yeah [inaudible] [LAUGH] --
R:  Ooh ... [LAUGH]
L:  Pushing the baby, uh ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's good.  Any way you can fit exercise in is wonderful. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have [inaudible] --
R:  You know, dancing to the radio, stuff like that.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Lifting them up.  Just lifting them up is exercise.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Hm.
R:  So, what kind of indoor activities do you like? [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I ... I don't know.  [LAUGH] I like ... um [LIPSMACK] ... playing on my computer.  That's about it. That's all I do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Pretty much all I do is computer stuff so yeah.
R:  Yeah, I tend to do a lot of that myself.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Yeah.
