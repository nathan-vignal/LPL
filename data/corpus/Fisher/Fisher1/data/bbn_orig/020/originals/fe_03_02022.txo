L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hi, my name is Kathy. [NOISE] 
L:  Hi, I'm Christie.
R:  Hi.  How are you? 
L:  I'm doing fine.  Where are you located? 
R:  I'm in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  How about --
L:  Oh, really.
R:  How about you? 
L:  I'm in Knoxville, Tennessee, but I grew up up that way, not too -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- far from you, so --
R:  No kidding.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, whereabouts? 
L:  I was up -- well, Scranton, Wilkes-Barre.
R:  Oh, sure, ahah.
L:  Kind of north of you just a little bit, but --  
R:  [NOISE] Ah -- ahah.
L:  -- close enough we used to go to Philly a lot.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  How about that?  That's funny.  I tried -- 
L:  It's a small world, [inaudible] -- [LAUGH] 
R:  It is, and it's funny, ah, the -- the other night I was talking -- this is, like, the third, um, call that I've done on -- on this project, and, ah, --
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  -- the woman moved out to California in, um, October and she was from, um, just outside of Philadelphia.  I mean maybe -- 
L:  Oh, how funny.
R:  -- within twenty -- twenty -- twenty miles outside.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, no, it's probably somebody you saw at the grocery store.  [LAUGH] 
R:  You never know.  I know.  Isn't that something?  It's -- 
L:  Oh. 
R:  -- fascinating.
L:  But is -- the topic they gave us, I don't know that much about it.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I was thinking that too, something about the corporate -- ah, [MN] something about corporate scandals, how has that affected you, I guess how -- I guess it's like a trickle down type of thing, maybe how is -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- the economy.  I don't know.
L:  I don't know.  I mean, as far as it goes with me --  
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- I don't see any difference in my area.
R:  Right.
L:  As far as other than people just don't trust the companies like they did.
R:  Oh, absolutely not.
L:  You know, that way.  But, as far as overall, we are not -- well, I'm not even anywhere near close to where that Enron thing is.
R:  Yeah, yeah. 
L:  Or any of those.  I mean, they were all the big ones that really goofed up, and so far the ones around here haven't been caught yet.
R:  [MN] That's the thing -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah.  See, there's the -- the trust factor.  It's [LAUGH] -- it's really hard to say, um, you know, what --
L:  It is funny.
R:  I know -- what companies are -- are doing.  You know, like the insci- -- [MN] like the inside scoop on things.  [LAUGH] [MN] 
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's -- I mean, the companies that I even associate with, I would never hear about it till --  
R:  Ah, yeah.
L:  -- it was done, because I work part time for the school system around here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So we are not affected by that.
R:  [MN] Right.
L:  And so we don't hear about it till it hits the national news.  Then we go, "Oh, no".
R:  Probably -- I don't think the average person probably is directly affected.  Maybe -- I don't know, maybe some people are indirectly, ah, affected.  Maybe they realise or maybe they don't.  It could be small things.
L:  Yeah.  Well, another -- I mean, it -- the -- even the small person in those bigger companies basically just lost their job.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah --  
L:  Except for where they had invested everything they had in the company.
R:  Oh, I know.  That's -- that's just -- just awful.
L:  That was sad, but --  
R:  Oh, horrible.  Yeah, those people definitely should be prosecuted and made to be --  
L:  Oh, I think so.
R:  -- paid back.  Yeah, they should be put away for a long time, absolutely.  I mean, that -- that's -- that's horrendo- -- that -- that's such greed, you know, [MN] and there's such greed that takes over.  You know, like, it's never --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- enough for those people.  I mean, they have more money than [LAUGH] -- than they absolutely n- need, you know -- much more.
L:  Well, that's what [MN] -- when --  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there was a movie about Enron, and that's the only one I can think of right now that's been recent that was a big, major corporate, "Oh, my goodness, they did what?"  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  But the movie portrayed 'em as the company just -- they wanted to party all the time.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  They were just in the -- they wanted money, they were never happy with enough money.  They had -- 
R:  [MN] There you go.
L:  -- to have -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- more money, and money's the root of all evil.  I don't care, greed and money I think go hand in hand.
R:  Yes, I really do.
L:  All the way around.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think -- this is just, ah, -- you know, just my opinion, I guess.  I think certain people have -- [MN] I could be wrong -- certain people have, ah, personalities that may be are -- they are predisposed to behave that way.
L:  Yeah.  I think -- well, God has a sense of humour.  [LAUGH] I just -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- haven't figured it out yet.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] I mean, after all, just look around this world.  There's enough things to just laugh at that --  
R:  I know.
L:  Animals or nature or something.  
R:  Yeah, I know. 
L:  So he's got a sense of humor somewhere.  [NOISE] 
R:  I know, you really have to, or else you'll, you know, [LAUGH] -- you know.   
L:  But, I mean, the government should've never let it go that long [NOISE] till they could ruin so many people.
R:  Oh, I know, gosh.
L:  Because they had to have had [NOISE] an inkling between tax returns and just insider anything.  Somebody somewhere had to know.
R:  [MN] That's the thing.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Y- you wonder who knew and, you know, why were they hiding it or -- you know, there's so many --
L:  Yeah, were -- 
R:  -- so much thing- -- 
L:  Were they being paid off somewhere. 
R:  [MN] Yeah.  There's so -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- many things that the -- the public will just never know probably, you know, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with a lot of those things.
L:  Well, they do that and then -- well, down where we're at, Bell South --
R:  What's the name? 
L:  -- which is the telephone company.  Bell South.
R:  Oh, Bell South.  Yeah, right, ahah.
L:  Yeah.  And they were a -- well, MaBelle was a huge thing that the government stepped in and said, "No".  But the thing is it's still the same company.
R:  I know.
L:  They just +divided it up -- 
R:  Yes. 
L:  -- and gave that four presidents with one owner --  
R:  And you wonder -- 
L:  -- type of thing. 
R:  -- what the purposes of that -- I -- I d- -- [LAUGH] I don't know, I just don't get --  
L:  I never understood it.  It's kind of like -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- well, even Microsoft.
R:  I know.
L:  He's done a lot of illegal things, apparently, but I don't see any -- I know he don't -- they -- the company donated computers to our school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Other than that, I mean, -- but that was -- he was sentenced, what, five, six years ago, and things are just now trickling down to where -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- I see it.
R:  Yeah, see, that's what I'm saying, it's the small -- maybe on a smaller scale for the average person and these things probably do take a while.
L:  Yeah, 'cause [NOISE] -- I mean, we would've bought a computer anyway.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he had the -- I mean, I -- in a lot of ways I think they were wrong in keeping him from charging what he wanted to for his stuff.
R:  I know.  I think, like, they call that --
L:  But at the same time he had that monopoly on it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it just -- I don't know.  I [MN] do not understand this stu- -- [LAUGH]  
R:  I know.  I think you really have to read up on it.  I -- I, like, maybe read a little bit on it, like a little, not that I'm -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, the expert of that subjec- --
L:  I get most of mine from the movie of the week or [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Do you -- I -- do you -- 
L:  [inaudible] Dateline, that twenty, thirty minute part of the show.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Do you have talk radio where you were in Tennessee? 
L:  Yeah, but I don't listen to it very much.
R:  Oh, 'cause I'm like a -- 
L:  There's -- 
R:  I l- love talk radio.  I listen hours.
L:  Oh, do you? 
R:  Yeah, I -- I really do.
L:  Now, my husband does.
R:  Really -- yeah.
L:  But I'm not just not into it 'cause -- well, they don't usually talk about stuff I care anything about.  Down here it's hunting, fishing. 
R:  Oh, yeah, that's true in that area.
L:  The guys talk about the cars.  They talk about -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- baseball cards.  There -- I don't know, there's got to be one.  I know the college campus down here has, like, a talk station.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  But they talk about the local groups and what's going -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- on around campus and --  
R:  Yeah.  See, you have to fi- --  
L:  [several inaudible words] -- I don't know, I'm sure Rush Limbaugh and all them are out there somewhere locally --  
R:  Oh, do you -- 
L:  -- but -- 
R:  Do you get Rush Limbaugh where you are?  'Cause we get it.  We get it from noon to three.
L:  We should.  Seems like he's on some time during the day, 'cause too many people around here know who he is to --  
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's, ah, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  He's really big, yeah. 
L:  [NOISE] Well, plus he's been big for a long time, but --  
R:  Yes, he has, yeah.
L:  -- he's -- I mean, I like to lis- -- I -- I guess I have listened to him in the past 'cause I remember he's got a sense of humor --  
R:  Yes, he does.
L:  -- that I understand.  You know, he's not one of these guys that +talk over your head and leaves you in the dark.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  And he brings something that, to me, would seem very complicated and makes it understandable even that my kids would understand.
R:  [MN] That's true, yeah, he really -- 
L:  He -- 
R:  -- does.
L:  -- seems to be able to do that, and he likes to take things -- like our -- what our topic's supposed to be tonight [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and break 'em up and say, "Now, this is what they are doing, and do you think they should do this?" and then he lets people respond with --
R:  Yeah, you can --  
L:  -- yes, no or maybe.
R:  -- really learn an awful lot.  Yeah, it -- it's fascinating.  You really can, [MN] and, ah, -- 
L:  I hadn't thought about him, but, yeah, I've listened to him in the past.  It's been a while, though.  I hadn't even thought about that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Probably in the last two y- -- I don't get to listen to the radio much.  I have three kids --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that are all in elementary school and radio once -- 
R:  Oh, yeah. 
L:  -- they're home is out.
R:  Oh, yeah, -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I see what you mean, yeah.
L:  They've got three TVs going and the video games and the -- oh, drives me batty.
R:  That must be a lot -- see, I don't -- I don't have any kids, so it's -- that's, like I said, different -- different lifestyle.  [LAUGH] [MN] 
L:  Well, they can change your whole world upside down.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I guess there's a lot -- 
L:  But I wouldn't trade 'em.
R:  Yeah.  There's -- I'm sure there's a lot of advantages to -- to the kids, though, you know.  This -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I love my kids, even -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- though they drive me nuts.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] But, um, as far as [NOISE] corporate stuff --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- I don't know.  I just -- I've even thought about skipping this one 'cause I thought, "What do I know?" and I thought, "Well, maybe I'll get somebody who knows as much as [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, no, just maybe -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- generally, but I, you know, --  
L:  I mean, I didn't want 'em giving me somebody that was -- and [inaudible] said, "Ahah, ahah".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  I know what you mean, yeah.
L:  You don't want to look like a total idiot, but at the same time I'm sorry.
R:  Yeah, it -- 
L:  Oh, man. 
R:  It's kind of like a -- I guess a topic that maybe people just know on the -- the fringes about it.  But, unless you are really in the -- in the world of business, I guess, or it really affects you, you really wouldn't be an expert on the subject.  The average person --  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Yeah, r- -- seriously.  That's the way I look it.
L:  Well, it's not something that [MN] -- it affects me somehow --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- some way down the line, but -- 
R:  Right.  
L:  -- like, right around here we had, ah, Jake Butcher -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- owned a banking system and he got a lot of the people around here when we had the, um, eighty -- no, ninety two world fair. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think it was nine- -- no, it may've been eighty two world fair, was here in Knoxville, and he got everybody to invest in his bank and all, and he wasn't doing what he was supposed to.
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  And he got caught.  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Well, when the government stepped -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in and closed him down -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- people around here -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- lost everything.
R:  Oh!  W- wasn't it FDIC insured? 
L:  No.
R:  Oh!  Oh, jeeze.  God, that's one rule of thumb: never put your money in something that's not FD- -- 
L:  Well, see, that's what -- 
R:  Oh, God, never.  
L:  This was a local guy that most of these people --  
R:  Oh, jeeze.
L:  -- had been around --
