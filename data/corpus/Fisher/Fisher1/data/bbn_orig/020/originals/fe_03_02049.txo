L:  [NOISE] Hi, my name is Tristina.
R:  Hi, my name is Sharon Noak[?].  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Can you hear me? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Can you hear me? 
R:  Yeah.  I -- 
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  -- guess we're supposed to talk about outdoor activities.
L:  Okay.  
R:  Okay. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  I guess you just heard that little recording also? 
L:  Yeah, I heard it too.
R:  Okay.  Okay.  Um, I couldn't exactly hear what they wanted us to say.  Just our favorite activities or what we think about outdoor things.
L:  [NOISE] It sounded like do we like cold weather or hot weather better or outdoor activities or indoor activities better.
R:  Okay.  
L:  Christian.  
R:  Okay.
L:  Stop, Christian.  
R:  I don't know -- 
L:  [NOISE] I can personally say that I like it cold and inside.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  I li- [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] I'm in Florida.  It's hot, and I hate the heat and being [NOISE] outside.  It's so hot I hate being outside. [NOISE] 
R:  Okay.  Oh, you're in Florida now?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Okay.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I'm in Pennsylvania, and we have had lingering winter for the longest -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- time.  So right now I have to say that I would prefer it to be hot so I could be outside.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah.
R:  So, yeah, --
L:  A lot of people I talk to at work -- they live up north [NOISE] and they said it's been so cold they like it.
R:  Yes.  I don't know -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- when it's cold I feel like I just sort of shut down, like things are -- it's so much harder for me to do things.  I feel more comfortable when it's hot, but -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  [NOISE] See, I feel more comfortable when it's cold.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, I don't know.  I grew up in Virginia, where it's completely hot -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and humid most of the time or the winters are really mild.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So I feel like that's just what I've been used to for a long time, so ...
L:  Right.  
R:  Um, it's just easier to deal with -- 
L:  Yeah, see I grew up in Florida.  It's always hot.  
R:  Okay.  
L:  So ... [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  It's always hot.  Even the winter, the coldest -- 
R:  Okay. 
L:  -- we get is like forty. 
R:  Oh, my gosh, yeah, okay.  Yeah, we had this awful month this winter where it was like a good day if it got up to thirty.  It was ridiculously cold. [MN]  
L:  Oh, yes, [NOISE] I didn't go and do anything when the weather was like that.
R:  Yeah.  No, you can't [LAUGH] -- you really can't do anything.  You're just like, "Oh, I want to drink hot chocolate and forget about the world".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So ...  So do you do anything outside?  Are you pretty much, like, indoor --  
L:  No, indoor person.
R:  Okay.  Okay.  What part of Florida do you live in?
L:  Orlando. [NOISE]
R:  Okay.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So that's a pretty -- pretty area.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I've been to Pennsylvania before, to Easton. 
R:  Okay.  To Easton, you said?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.  To the college --
L:  [NOISE] Actually, when we were up there we did, like, basketball and stuff, so -- 
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  -- [NOISE] it was fun, but I just can't do it here.  It's too hot.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  What i- -- what -- is your job an indoor job too?
L:  Yeah.  I work for AOL.  
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Do they have, like, a big plant in Orlando?
L:  [NOISE] Um, they have a customer service centre in Orlando and one in Jacksonville, Florida, and then they've got them all over.
R:  Okay.  
L:  Baby, sit down in the cart.  
R:  Okay.
L:  Sorry, I'm at Walmart right now.  I wasn't -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- expecting the call right now.
R:  Yeah, I'm really sorry.  I've -- I've turned down a couple of these calls just because it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- been, like, a really awkward time, so ...  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I guess we just have to get through the ten minutes -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and then it's over. 
L:  Yeah.  This is my first one, so I don't even know what I'm supposed [NOISE] to be, like, saying.  [NOISE]  
R:  Yeah, I know.  
L:  I'm going to pay for this stuff. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [NOISE] What, do they just, like, record us talk for ten minutes and then that's it?
R:  Yeah, I guess so.  I don't know.  This is my first one too, so I'm really not sure exactly how it works.  
L:  Christy[?], my sister, did one and I swore she said they, [NOISE] like, asked you questions and you had to just answer, like, a robotic voice asking -- 
R:  I -- 
L:  -- questions [NOISE] all the time.
R:  I thought that too.  I had no idea there would be another person on the line.  I thought it was just like, okay, you call, I answer some questions and then that's it, because I --  
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Because I thought it was set up to be like a study of how you interact with other -- with a -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- robot or somebody not human or something like that.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know.  It's kind of odd.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] Oh, no.  So outdoor activities I don't like.  I like inside.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, basketball inside I like. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Are you a big sports watcher?
L:  [NOISE] No, not at all.
R:  Okay.  Okay.  Huh.  Yeah, it's weird 'cause I always think of Orlando has being a pretty, like, built up -- I mean, there's the basketball team, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- right, and then there's -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- Disney World too.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So I think of it being like a pretty sporty place, but, -- 
L:  Oh, it is. 
R:  -- you know, --
L:  Just -- first, it's just too hot.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Huh, that's interesting.  So is there -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- are there just a lot of people who work for Disney in Orlando?  Like, is that --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Tons.  
R:  Okay.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Okay.  Because that's the only way I ever hear about Orlando, is just people going -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- there for Disneyworld, so --  
L:  Right.  Yeah, both -- 
R:  [inaudible] big impression.   
L:  -- my parents work there.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Okay.  Hm.  Do you guys go there every summer or whenever? 
L:  We go there all the time. [NOISE] 
R:  Okay.  Yeah.  Huh. 
L:  Um, --
R:  Did --
L:  Oh, no, it's okay.  Here, give him the money.  Give him the money.  Thank you, baby.
R:  Are you with your kids?
L:  Ah, no, my nephew. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, okay.  How old is he?  
L:  Just -- he's two.  Give me the change.  Give me the change.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  [MN] 
L:  Thank you.  You hold the receipt.  The guy's, like, "Take this receipt now".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] All right, thank you.  [NOISE] Tell him "bye".  [NOISE] Tell him "bye".  [NOISE] [several inaudible words] my nephew.  
R:  Okay.  
L:  [NOISE] He'll be [inaudible] stuff. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Are you with him a lot, you said? 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, when I'm not with him -- with him [NOISE] --
R:  Okay.  Is that your sister's kid or your brother's or something?
L:  [NOISE] My sister's.
R:  Okay.  Mm.  How many -- 
L:  [NOISE] Do you have any kids? 
R:  I don't have any kids now, no, uh-uh.  I'm only -- 
L:  [NOISE] Neither do I.
R:  Yeah.  I'm only twenty three, so I figure I have some time before I start having children.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Do you have a lot of brothers and sisters?
L:  [NOISE] No, just two sisters.
R:  Oh, okay.  Are they both older or younger?
L:  Younger.
R:  Okay.  That's cool.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, exciting.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know.  Just like okay.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So what sort of stuff do you do when you are not hanging out with your nephew?  Are you with him a lot of the time?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I just like -- well, yeah, a lot of the time in the day --
R:  Okay.  
L:  -- and then I work at night.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
L:  [COUGH] [inaudible]. 
R:  So what --  
L:  And then the weekends [NOISE] just whatever.  
R:  Okay. 
L:  [NOISE] [several inaudible words] our weekends.
R:  Okay.  Do you -- 
L:  You want to see that movie?  [NOISE] All right, I'll take you to see, okay?  
R:  [LAUGH] So do you babysit while your sister's working or? 
L:  No, [NOISE] I used to before I started working.
R:  Okay.  Okay.  Huh.  All right.  Do they have any other kids, or is that your only --
L:  No, that's the only one. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, okay.  So he's the baby of the family?
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh. 
R:  Oh, that's real --
L:  Ma, you need help putting him in the car?  All right, I'll meet you at home, okay?  [NOISE] Tell me what you want to have for tea.  I'm about to die.  [NOISE] Tell me.  [NOISE] 
R:  [MN]
L:  All right.  [inaudible] you can [inaudible].  I'll follow you.  All right, I'm sorry. 
R:  Oh, it's okay.
L:  We all have, like, two separate cars and --  
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the baby's riding with her because the car seat's in her car.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So I had to make sure she didn't need help.  I could tell she wanted help, but it's too hot.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  How hot is it today?
L:  [NOISE] Um, [inaudible] eighty seven.
R:  Oh, okay.  Is it really humid there too?
L:  Yes. [NOISE] 
R:  Okay.
L:  I'm, like, dying of sweat.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, no. [MN] Go home and turn the air conditioner on.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I'll make sure that the AC on high.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's really weird, I feel like I'm all up on your business and sort of like hanging out at Walmart and whatever, you know what I mean? 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's like okay, so ...
L:  Oh, no, I had to go to Walmart [several inaudible words] in my things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So I guess we just -- 
L:  Okay. 
R:  -- have to wait for there to be a little beep or something?
L:  Yeah, they said ten minutes.
R:  Okay.
L:  I had to, um, put in my ear phone thing so I don't have to hold the phone.
R:  Oh, okay.  [inaudible] 
L:  But, yeah, I just went to Walmart to get deodorant, because I didn't feel like going to Walmart and my mum and sister did --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I [inaudible] out everyone on the road in Orlando because they were going thirty and the speed limit's fifty five.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] Oh, my gosh.  Is it like that all the time?  Are there pretty bad drivers there?
L:  [inaudible] me, I try to get away from everyone.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I just, like, -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- drive as fast as I can to get away from all the slow people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because it's so aggravating.  They -- there's so many old people here.
R:  Really?
L:  You know they say Florida is where people come to die. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  I never think of that visiting Orlando, though, because Orlando is always, like, you know, fun and games, and I think of, --  
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  -- ah, you know. 
L:  No, it's a lot of young people in Orlando and there's, like, tons of stuff to do.  There's, like, Orlando Magic [inaudible] Stadium thing here [inaudible].
R:  Okay.  Does Orland- -- 
L:  And there's -- 
R:  Does Orlando have that one street with, like, all the clubs and all that?  Is that -- I might be thinking of, ah, --  
L:  Tampa, Ebor City.
R:  Tampa, yeah.  I might be thinking of Tampa. 
L:  Ahah, that's Ebor City.  
R:  Okay. 
L:  I mean, Orlando has it too, but -- 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  -- it's not like Tampa's.  Like, Orlando's is, um, ah, Church Street Station. 
R:  Okay.
L:  And there's, like, clubs and bars and stores --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, um, -- but then i- in Tampa it's Ebor City, and that's, like, where it's blocked off where you can't drive on it.
R:  Ahah, oh, okay.
L:  You have to, like, pay to park somewhere and then you walk to it, and then it's a whole, like, city block but it's, like, blocked off where you can't drive and, like, --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- ah, Church Street, you can't drive in part of it but most of it you can drive through.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, like, when you cross the street, man, you gotta watch out because people'll be drunk and driving all crazy.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I don't know if that's a good system or not to have the cars further away.  I don't know.
