L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, my name is Marina.
R:  Hi, Marina.  My name is Cathy.  How're you?
L:  Good.  How're you?
R:  Oh, fine.  I'm doing great this evening.
L:  [LAUGH] Good.
R:  So, which is it?  Which do you prefer?  Cold --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- activities or hot?
L:  Um ... in depends.  It's really hard for me to pick one because I'm generally a very active person and I like sports and being active.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, um, I can't even really tell.  I mean, um, in cold weather you have snowboarding and skiing and skating which are really fun and then in hot weather it's swimming and, um, volleyball, basketball, tennis.  All -- all this stuff [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, what about you?
R:  I am in indoor person.
L:  Indoor?
R:  Indoor.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Indoor person.  I am not very active so there --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- aren't a lot of sports that I participate in.  If, um, my grandchildren come over I may go out and engage in some sports with them, but that's about it.
L:  Uh-huh.  Okay.
R:  I'm pretty sedentary. 
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  You know?
L:  Well -- well, do you think so?  I- if you were to choose?
R:  If I were to participate, it would be summer, you know, hot ... hot weather and outdoor activities.  Probably, uh ... volleyball, softball, that sort of thing.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I can see myself participating in those.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um ... jump rope.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Things like that.  Things that the kids -- you know, my grandkids would like to participate in.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but there are also a lot of indoor activities like playing chess ... um, some table games, you know?  Um, do you ever --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- do?
R:  Yeah, I just taught my granddaughter a few minutes ago to play Othello -- how to play Othello.
L:  O- what?
R:  I just taught my granddaughter a few minutes ago how to play Othello.
L:  What is that?
R:  Othello is a game where you have, uh, the ch- the piece -- the game pieces are round.
L:  Mhm.
R:  On one side they're white.  On the other side they're black.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And you ... you try to control the board by laying out your pieces in such a way that ... you have, let's say, a white piece on the left side and a white one on the right side, and all the black ones that she has put ... perhaps in the middle ... you get to turn them all the black pieces -- you get to turn them, all the black pieces -- you get to turn them over to your side, so you control those pieces now.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's, uh ...
L:  Hm, that's interesting.
R:  It's a -- it's an interesting game.
L:  Ah --
R:  It's an interesting game, and, uh --
L:  It's kinda like checkers.
R:  It's sort of like checkers.  It's sort of like backgammon, I think.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it may even have a little bingo in it because you can move diagonally.
L:  Uh-huh, okay.
R:  So, it's a fun game.
L:  Oh, that sounds fun.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Was your granddaughter excited to play?
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  Oh, good.
R:  She enjoyed that.  She ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- she got to use strategy against grandma.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Who won?
R:  Uh, grandma did.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  At some point I'll let her win, but not right away.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And, uh, how old is she?
R:  Uh, she's seventeen.
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, she's old enough to win, of course, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But not against grandma and not just yet. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Not right away.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, yeah, I do, uh, enjoy some of the ... other indoor activities as well.  Um ... [LIPSMACK] besides the board games ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and strategy games.  There are a lot of computer games that I enjoy too.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Well, that's -- that's my primary indoor activity.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.  Which ones do you like?
R:  Is working on my computer.  Hm?
L:  Which -- which computer games do you like?
R:  Um ... well, let's see.  There are some by ... uh, there are some under zone dot com.  There are some under pop ... and what else was there?  I can't think of the names.  There's one that's called bejeweled that I really love --
L:  Oh, ok-
R:  -- and it -- it requires a minimal amount of strategy but it's just a lot of fun.
L:  Oh, okay.  Oh, so they're mostly strategy games?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Oh.
R:  I like games that make you think.
L:  Okay.
R:  I -- I really like to see more text base games.  There was one that was on the computer some years ago but I think is gone now and it was ... basically text based.  It was a -- it told a story ... and you had to understand what clues they were giving and -- and do -- make the appropriate moves and that sort of thing.
L:  I --
R:  I like those games.
L:  Huh, yeah.
R:  Uh, I think one of the early ones was Hugo.  You might have heard of that?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's a -- that's a great computer game.  I love that.  It was kinda primary but ... 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it was a lot of fun.
L:  Good.
R:  So, tell me about -- tell me about snowboarding and all that sort of thing.  I have no experience in snowboarding and skiing and that sort of thing.
L:  Well, I don't have that much experience of it either but I actually grew up in Russia in a pretty cold place.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  With a long winter so, um, we went cr- um, cross country skiing a lot and we went skating.  There was no snowboard in there --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- at that point.  It's ... just a recent trend that is appearing there now.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I actually tried snowboarding when I moved here, um, about three years ago.
R:  Okay.
L:  [inaudible] and it seemed like a lot of fun, you know, it gives you this rush when you, um, [LIPSMACK] go down very quickly on -- down the hill.
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh, really, really fun and I'm still not very good at it 'cause I can't afford to go snowboarding all the time.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah, I -- I can imagine there are some expenses on --
L:  Yeah, it's expensive and I'm a student, but, um, I live in Flagstaff and we have a resort right here.  It's not very big but it's really nice so --
R:  Huh.
L:  I [LIPSMACK] sometimes I go. [LAUGH]
R:  Sounds like fun.
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  It sounds like fun.
L:  It's fun.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's -- that's the important thing.  If you really enjoy it, you know ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you do that.  I'm just not very adventurous in that respect.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I -- I've -- I'm way into safety.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's one thing that, you know, like sometimes I don't go because I realize I don't have insurance right now and if I ... was to get hurt then I would be in trouble.  [LAUGH]
R:  That -- that could be expensive.
L:  And you can get hurt really ... really easily.  A lot of my friends, this -- this past winter.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  So, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Huh.  That -- that is one of the dangers, but, uh, like I said -- now, I do -- I do enjoy swimming.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's just that I'm not too fond of the lake and I'm only, what?  A mile or two from the lake.
L:  Oh, really?  Where are you from?
R:  I'm in northwest Indiana.
L:  Okay.
R:  And Lake Michigan, I'm right at the tip of Lake Michigan.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And --
L:  Is that like a beach where people --
R:  Yes.  A beautiful beach.
L:  Okay, wow.
R:  The dunes are there.  It's very lovely.
L:  Mm.
R:  But I just don't spend any time there.
L:  Mm.
R:  People who ... most of the people who live around here don't really spend as much time here at -- at the beach as people who come from, say, Chicago or outlying areas.
L:  Mm.  [LIPSMACK] Okay.
R:  You know, it's just that --
L:  It's not as exotic for you?  [LAUGH]
R:  Is it what now?
L:  It's not exotic for you 'cause it's always there?
R:  It's not exotic because I grew up around it.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  Um, a lot of the people I know will go into Chicago which is a major, you know, area because that's more exciting ...
L:  Mm.  Mhm.
R:  -- and then we find s- we were trying to find a particular museum at one point and we asked some Chicagoans and they said, "Oh, we don't know where that is" and they live there.
L:  [LAUGH] Really?
R:  So, the people who live in a particular place are not the ones who visit the ... the attractions in that particular place.
L:  Mhm.  [LAUGH] Um, I was also gonna ask you do you like to play cards, like poker?
R:  You know what?  I've never learned to play cards.  I was never really interested in it because when --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I was in school -- when I was in college ... I would watch the young people play tournaments and they seemed to get very angry.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So, that sort of put me away from it.  I didn't wanna participate in something where it was a game but people were getting really angry about it, especially cards.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  It was very simple, so I just --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- decided I didn't wanna play cards.  Now, there are some simple games that I can play like plonk and old maid, things like that --
L:  Mm.
R:  But poker and those things where ... especially if money is involved, I don't play it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I don't want to have someone get angry with me because I put the wrong card down.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that sort of thing but, uh --
L:  Yeah, that makes sense.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I -- [NOISE] to me it was just supposed to be a game so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] just leave it as a game ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [NOISE] and don't get excited about money and -- and personalities and all that sort of thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess you could almost say I'm a little bit of a loner as far as entertainment.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I love to read.  That's -- that's another one of my favorite indoor activities and outdoor.  I'll sit in the park and read.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, our library just gave away tons of books and I got as many as I could.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, novels that turn into movies, that sort of thing.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And that way I can read the original, uh ... the original work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, reading --
L:  Do you have a favorite book?
R:  No.  Not really.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, if I were being ... if --
