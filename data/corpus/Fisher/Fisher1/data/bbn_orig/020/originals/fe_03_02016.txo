L:  Hello?
R:  Yes, hello --
L:  Hi, ah --
R:  -- my name's -- go ahead.
L:  I'm sorry, I'm Nayeda.
R:  I'm Karen, I'm from New York -- in New York.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Philly.
R:  Oh.  In Philly?
L:  Yes.
R:  Everybody I speak to is in Philly.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Now, they were saying about the scandal, something, I really didn't get the whole question that good.
R:  Yeah, it was so long.  It was something about how do you feel the corporate scandals have affected you, and um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah --
L:  Yeah, like the economy or something, isn't that right?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I mean, well what I did get out of it, um, oh and something, legalizing something.  I don't know.  Oh God, I missed the question. [LAUGH]
R:  It was so long.  The question was like very long.  It was very long.
L:  Yeah, it really was.
R:  Perhaps we can just talk about the economy.  I mean, how do we feel the corporate corruption has affected us and the economy or something.
L:  Right.
R:  That'll work. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that'll work. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, well the only thing that I can say -- well, even regarding that and like the question what I thought about when I heard it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- was that, um, like say for instance with my job -- well, my old job where I used to work.  Um, even like the scandals, like my old job was on television for like --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- scandals and stuff like that -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and um, because they were, like, misusing and misappropriating funds, and just everything.  And even they were like I think buying like their own stock, and I mean, it was just crazy.
R:  Mm.
L:  So they were on television, the higher ups in our organization were like on TV, in New York, getting arrested.
R:  Oh my --
L:  So.  And they, they were taking like, taking them from their homes and stuff.  But they had a three million dollar golf course that they were building --
R:  Oh my.
L:  -- mind you, they stopped giving us, um --
R:  Raises, right.
L:  Right.  And cost of living increases.
R:  Uh-huh.  Mhm.
L:  But they had like a three million dollar golf course that they were building, um, it was a father and his sons and stuff like that.  And they were --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- building like this golf course, and they had all this money and -- you know, it's just like they were misappropriating funds.  It was a family owned business, and --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- then they stepped down, but the, the way that they left the company, I mean, it was just like --
R:  Oh, right.  It can never survive.
L:  Right.  So the company went in chapter eleven.
R:  Of course.
L:  You know, and then they had to step down, but it's just like at that point you screwed up the lives of so many people.  I mean, it's just like, as far as like money is concerned, you can only get a certain amount of raise and then after that --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you couldn't get a raise.  You know.  
R:  That's trifling.
L:  Yeah, it, it was really trifling.  And I just --
R:  But you know, you -- I come to expect, actually, big business.  It's a small -- when the small ones, when small family owned ones are, are corrupt, that, that kinda hurts a lot.  But I kinda expect like big business to be --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- corrupt in some kind of way.
L:  And they were like taking -- I mean, and it had gotten to be so bad, like say for instance they were like [LAUGH] keeping the money in the family, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like the wife, like say for instance, like when they hired -- like when they ordered the, um, furniture for the offices, like 'cause they had offices all over, I mean, just everywhere.
R:  Mm.
L:  So when they had the building -- I mean, when they had the, the offices and they wanted to furnish the new offices --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- his wife had the furniture business and would furnish the offices.
R:  Oh my goodness, that's so -- yeah, right.
L:  I mean, so --
R:  How convenient.  How convenient.
L:  -- you -- right -- yeah, how convenient if that.  But where did she get the business from?  Of of the money that you made from the other business.
R:  Other business, right.
L:  So it's just like, you're just taking money and reusing it.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  And it just -- it's just circulating within the family.
R:  That's right.  That's how the rich stay right.
L:  How about that.
R:  Right.
L:  So -- and then it was just like, and they was just -- I just felt like poor com- you know, I just, I didn't want to work there anymore.  Well, I had the -- I found a new job recently, so I'll be starting my new job on next week.
R:  Oh, congratulations.
L:  And today was my last day there.  But it's just like, even with that, then they came and told us, okay, well you can't -- you can only have a three per cent raise.  Then they said, okay, well that's -- go ahead.  You know what, just [inaudible].  I'm sorry, I'm driving.  I get road rage.
R:  Oh my God --
L:  I'm sorry. [LAUGH]
R:  That's okay.
L:  But then they told us that, um, you can only have a three per cent raise.  And like, we used to have a scoring system from like one to five.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Then all of a sudden they said, okay, well you can't have a five any longer.  If you were rated a five --
R:  You didn't get your full three -- full three per cent.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  If you didn't have a five, then they didn't give you the full three per cent, right?
L:  Right.  But listen, this is the whole thing.  Now -- well, we used to go from like one to like maybe five per cent I think it was.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So like I guess whatever you were rated was the percentage that you received.
R:  Right.
L:  Then they said, okay, well you can't have above three per cent.  Okay, fine, three per cent is the highest.  
R:  Oh.
L:  Now they're saying if you're a -- if you were rated a five, which is like the top of the line --
R:  Perfect, right, uh-huh.
L:  -- right, if you were rated a five in your overall rating and your scoring, then now you can only be a three no matter what.  So what is that saying to people who were once fives, they become threes now and it makes it look -- seem -- or it makes it look as if they're doing less work, like you're slacking.
R:  It's less work, right.  Right.
L:  So it's easier for them to get rid of you because they can go back and say, okay, well it looks like you've been slacking in your workload --
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  -- not that the people have been slacking, but because they told us in our office you can only get a three.
R:  Get a three.  Uh-huh.
L:  So what about people who were threes and they were average, so now they're ones --
R:  People with the ones, right, they're gone.
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  It's unbelievable.
L:  -- it's like -- it's a way to eliminate people, and I really really think that it's unfair and something should be done about it.  And I think there are systems in place to protect -- to really protect the people.  You know --
R:  Yeah.  This is the point.  There should be some systems in place where you have some kinda, some kinda say as, as, as -- but then that would be a union, I guess, and I don't like them too much either.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think I would rather have a union.  I'm totally --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, working for, um, the organization that I worked for and what happened to us, I think I would really rather have a union.  That way you have a mouth piece or somebody that's fighting for you.  You know, and with something like this, and actually I thought about it at one time, um, organizing a union in my job [LAUGH].  I think, oh God, they're gonna fire me for sure.  Like --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you can't get -- you can't get fired for starting a union.  You can't.
R:  No, you can't.  But they can sure make your life freaking miserable.
L:  Yeah, they -- now that they can do.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Fire you they can't, but they can make you so miserable that you just want to leave.
R:  Leave, right.
L:  So I mean, it's just like even the strength, the changes and the restructuring of our company is -- the company is still in chapter eleven.  They haven't gotten out yet.
R:  Absolutely.  Oh my goodness.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.  And it was in chapter eleven since last year.
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  So that was a smart move for you -- for you to get out.  So they really affected you, you -- it -- I hope you got a job that was better.
L:  Ah, yeah.  I did --
R:  'Cause this economy is, is --
L:  -- get a job that was better --
R:  -- very hard to find.  I don't know about in Philly, but I know up here, it's very rough.
L:  Yeah.  How 'bout that.  I did --
R:  Trying to find a job.
L:  -- I did find a job.  Of course it was in Jersey, so now I have to drive to Jersey.
R:  Oh, God.
L:  But at least I did find a job.  But I had to get out of it.  I mean, it was just --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- it's pathetic.  I mean, in the way that they do people, and I really do -- there should be some kind of system or something in place where people that are being affected by the changes and just the shady stuff that's done in these organizations can speak up.  And I mean, it's okay good, he got the people, and -- like, I mean, like, um, like the people with Enron, and you know, my company.  Okay, these people were arrested and they were seen on national television --
R:  Right.
L:  But yet and still what about the people.
R:  All those people that had -- that's right, those people had lost all their pension money --
L:  That's right.
R:  All of the things.  What happens to them.
L:  Nothing -- I mean, and then you're without a pension.  You're without any money, you know, you, you had a life -- your life savings --
R:  That's damn right --
L:  -- saved up, and you're without that, and then, I mean, it's just like, what can they say?  Oh, sorry.
R:  Oh, we're sorry.  That's right, we're sorry.  You can visit them in prison and torture them if that makes you feel better.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean --
L:  But what good is that, when you, you had a million dollars or so saved up for your retirement, and now you gotta work 'til like you're ninety five.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's not right.  It's like, what is in place to protect the people.  Why do you -- I mean, why do they do this?  You know, and it really -- that really bothers me.  Because I feel like, okay, good, you get the shady people.  But on the flipside, it's just like the -- the people that were working for these organizations, it's like backlash.  They get everything -- I mean, they just get all the backlash from it.  They're out of job --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- they don't -- you know, their pension money is gone, the company's in chapter eleven, they can't get raises, they can't get -- you know, the -- um, the amount of money that they, they really deserve, increases and stuff like that.
R:  Exactly.  That's what's disgusting.  You can't get any kind of raise, and, and they blaming everything on the economy, but then you're like, well, but didn't you just get a new car and isn't that -- didn't you just buy a new house?  And didn't you just hire all of these -- your friends at high salaries but yet you're telling us that we can't get a raise --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- 'cause that's what most companies is like.  Oh, we, we're holding, holding our raises, holding, um, cost of living adjustment this, you know, this year.  And I'm like, you can't hold it.  MTA didn't hold it.  My grocery store's not holding it.  My rent isn't holding it.
L:  That's right.
R:  [LAUGH] I need my money.
L:  That's right.
R:  What are you talking -- what are you talking about.
L:  Right.  And that's how my company started off, just
