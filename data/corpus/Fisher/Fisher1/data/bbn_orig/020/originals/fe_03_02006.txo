R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  My name is John.
R:  My name is Dick, John.
L:  How you doing, Dick?
R:  [inaudible] John.  Um, I'm retired.  What do you do?
L:  What's that?
R:  I'm retired.
L:  Uh, I work in the, uh, medical field.
R:  The medical field.
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh.
L:  So I think the, uh, the corporate scandals with Enron and -- and so on and so forth really do affect me in a certain way with 401K retirement and stock options and buying in [inaudible] -- into my company and all that.
R:  Well, the -- the [inaudible] laws of disclosure have been changed in the last year, so since Bush became president, when the scandals broke with Enron and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  CBC, CWC or CW -- CDW, whatever it was -- CBW.
L:  Mhm.
R:  CBW.  The Bell tel -- the telephone company.
L:  Right.  There was a cable company involved and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and there's -- there's numerous, actually.  They are just the ones we have heard about.  What about the ones we haven't heard about? 
R:  Right.
L:  I mean I just don't know.  You are retired and basically -- 
R:  I was reading the -- 
L:  It probably affects you, too.
R:  Yes, it does.  Um, I was reading in, uh, the Financial Times the other day that Bush is thinking of taking the English laws on accounting procedure and, um, I used to be an accountant -- 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and, uh, it's pretty simple thing to do, [several inaudible words] the laws, but where the -- the real trouble comes in is these accounting firms that do consulting business on the side with their auditing procedures.
L:  Right.
R:  And that can -- that cannot affect the auditing when they are consulting a company as to what to do and then they come over with an audit that shows their consulting ideas were wrong, so then, so -- so -- 
L:  And -- and who -- who takes the blame for that? 
R:  -- it just makes sense that they may jiggle the books a little bit -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- to make it look like they were right. 
L:  And who takes the blame for that?  Only if and when they get caught, I would assume, correct?
R:  Right, only when they're caught.  They've tried to separate the two between accounting firms and consulting firms, so that they're not the same business, like Arthur Andersen -- 
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- and companies like that that have. 
L:  Have they done that or no? 
R:  What?
L:  Have they done that?  Have they separated them or no?
R:  They -- no, they -- they won't do it.
L:  Well, then that -- 
R:  They got a powerful man in the -- I don't know where it's at but it's in the -- somewhere in the accounting review board that, uh, won't allow it.
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
R:  So there's been no change in the law really.
L:  What -- what -- what's that sort of -- what --  
R:  Accounting firms are supposed to do that on their own.
L:  What does that sort of tell us, though?  [LAUGH]
R:  The government's weak.
L:  Oh, I'm telling you, some -- some may right here somewhere.
R:  If you tell a company, well, if you invest a certain amount of money in this, you come up with a better profit, or if -- if you change over to machinery instead of -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- hand, that it -- it will turn over a better profit, and if it doesn't, then you look bad.  They make more money on their consulting fees than they make on accounting.
L:  And -- and then their consulting fees are taken out, but then if -- if the company doesn't turn a bigger profit, nobody pays for that loss except for the company.
R:  No stockholders.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  And the stock wire goes down and like Enron, these different companies that have -- 
L:  And -- and what -- and what do we do with these -- with these officials that get caught with their hand in [MN] per se the cookie jar?  Do we -- do we throw them in jail?
R:  I don't think they do anything to them compared to a regular thief.  If you robbed a bank and what they robbed them of -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- why, they'd be in jail for life.
L:  I mean, look -- 
R:  Solitary confinement.
L:  Right.  Look -- look at case in point with Martha Stewart.
R:  Yeah, Martha Stewart.
L:  I mean I -- I haven't heard she's gone to jail.
R:  She hasn't gone to jail or anything.
L:  I mean I -- I haven't heard -- I haven't heard her even get a slap on the wrist.  I know her stuff is still in Kmart -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and people still buy it, so obviously, you know, it's -- it's just, I don't know, I don't know if this has to be regulated in some way or stiffer penalties or stiffer fines or something, but -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- does it really work or doesn't it?
R:  Right.
L:  That -- that's my question.
R:  Right.
L:  And it basically affects me to the point where if -- if I get a, uh, annual performance review and I get a raise, do I want to dump some of that money into my 401K or do I want to buy more stock in the company, but then how I do know that's safe?
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it -- it's just -- and -- and you're in this type -- this line of business sort of in accounting.
R:  Well, like in Enron, all those executives sold out -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- before the thing really went under and made their -- made money on it.
L:  Yeah, and don't you think they had a clue?
R:  What?
L:  They had to have a clue.
R:  Oh, they had a clue all right.  That's why they're invest- -- that's why they're -- [inaudible] I don't think any of them -- have any of them gone to jail?
L:  Uh, yeah, I -- I thought -- I thought -- I thought they were, but I -- 
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- don't -- um, you don't -- you don't really hear about it any more.
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  You don't really hear about what the -- what the final decisions were.
R:  I don't know, it -- it has shaken the confidence of the stock market and -- 
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  -- the economy is down.
L:  And the war has done that and everything else, but -- 
R:  And, uh, I -- I -- that's part of the reason.
L:  I -- I just don't -- I just don't understand this, as citizens and -- and, so to speak, the low people on the totem pole, what the hell we could do about it.
R:  Right.
L:  And I'm not sure if we can do anything about it.  I guess it's sort of like in God we trust so we've got to cross our fingers.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] and -- and [LAUGH] when you cross your fingers too many times pretty soon you get a blister.
R:  That's right.
L:  So I -- I -- I don't know how this works or what it's about, but I find these topics, you know, interesting to get other people's opinions from across United States.  Where you from, Dick? 
R:  Cincinnati.
L:  Cincinnati, Ohio?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm from, uh, a little town called Pittman, New Jersey.
R:  I just had a kidney transplant.
L:  Oh, you did?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, how did that work out?  I guess okay, I'm talking to you.
R:  Yeah, I lived through it. It --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I went through dialysis for a year or so, a year and a half about.  That almost killed me.
L:  Well, it sounds like you're in pretty good health.
R:  I'm in good health now.  My wife came to my rescue.  She donated a kidney to me.
L:  There you go. [COUGH]
R:  Saved my life.
L:  Yep, and -- and sometimes, you know, [MN] that's what you got to do, you got to reach out to people and that and maybe that's -- that's a concern with the government, maybe they sort of should start reaching out for us instead of taking from us.  I mean, [MN] and [MN] if anybody doesn't gather it, whether one's a paid up.
R:  Right.
L:  You know what I'm saying?  We're the -- we're the one's that put them in office, we're the ones that keep them in office, we're the ones that voted them out of office -- 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- but basically it's just us little guys that [LAUGH] basically put everything in motion.
R:  That's right.  Small businesses is, what, seventy five, sixty five per cent of the economy?
L:  Right. 
R:  Or more, is it?
L:  [COUGH] And with small business today, I mean, most of your small businesses are sort of like family run businesses.  Do they really have the option for 401K and -- and stock options and everything else like that.
R:  No, they don't.
L:  You don't -- you don't, you know, probably not.
R:  And they don't -- also don't have medical benefits.
L:  Right, unless they pay for it themselves.
R:  [inaudible] themselves now and then. 
L:  This is [MN] -- how many -- how many -- how many of these have you done?
R:  Two.
L:  Two.
R:  This is my second one.
L:  This is your second one and -- and both of them on government so far? 
R:  No, one was on family.
L:  Oh, that was one from last night, I think.
R:  From when?
L:  From last night.
R:  Yesterday, yeah.
L:  Yesterday, yeah. [COUGH] I don't know what the, you know, subjects or topics will be and I don't know how they pick you out randomly.
R:  It's sort of interesting.  You meet people.
L:  Yeah, it is.  You know, you -- it's just -- 
R:  [inaudible] how many have you done? 
L:  What's that?
R:  How many have you done?
L:  This is my third one.
R:  Your third one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I had one just a few moments ago, they put me on and nobody answered and I sat here for ten minutes, I thought they were going to put me on.  They never put me on and they asked for com- -- press one for comments, I pressed one and nothing happened.  I said, "I didn't get anybody", so I called them back.
L:  Well, no, you -- you -- when -- no, when you press one you just -- you just state your comment, you just talk into it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  In other words, they're just recording it.  You -- nobody's going to be on the other end.  It's just for -- 
R:  That was after the ten minutes were up and nobody talked to me.
L:  Well, they're not supposed to, I don't think.
R:  Ever had that happen? 
L:  No.  Yeah, I d- -- I just did that on my last call, I gave comment about, you know, the topic and how it was intriguing where you can talk to people all over the United States and get their viewpoints and, you know, what they think about certain things and I thought it was very interesting and that's all I said and I just -- I guess it goes on a machine, I don't know what it does.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  If I hadn't called back I never would have talked to you.
L:  [LAUGH]
