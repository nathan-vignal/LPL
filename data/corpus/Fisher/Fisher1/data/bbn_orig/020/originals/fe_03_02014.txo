L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  [NOISE] Hi, my name's Pam.
R:  Hey Pam, how's it going?
L:  Fine.  And what's your name?
R:  I -- ah, I'm Jacob.
L:  Hi, Jacob.  So we're --
R:  So --
L:  -- gonna discuss government and the -- how they should deal with the -- shall we say crooks in the business world? [LAUGH]
R:  Crooks in the business world.  Okay, Pam.  Let's talk about it.  Um [LAUGH] all righty.  So, I mean, yeah, crooks in the business world, I mean, if guys make that much money there's no reason for them to be crooks, you know.  So, I don't think they should, like, do that stuff.  I think the government should crack down on them and like take all -- take all the money they steal and give it to their employees or something like that.  What do -- what do you think?
L:  Well, the employees would probably be real thrilled. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I know.  I think, I think rob the rich, feed the poor, you know, like Robin Hood back in the day. 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I'd definitely say they need to do something, because, you know, like you say you look at Enron and how that left definitely the employees thinking they had hundreds of thousands of dollars to retire and ended up with, a lot of them, nothing.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So, um, I'm not sure what the government -- how they can do it except probably check things out a little better, but, you know, um, I'm sure with everybody, anybody that's had money in the stock market, um, like for instance when MCI filed bankruptcy, I mean, the stock market went terribly down --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and lots of people lost money like that.  So, I don't know -- I don't know how much the big corporations, how much the government really even does or if they monitor them at all or what.  But I'd say they're gonna --
R:  Yeah, I don't know.
L:  No idea what they do there, you know, they always post the reports and everything, but I don't know if the government really has anybody that checks into that, or --
R:  They probably, they probably have a few people, but I don't think they do too much.  They just like go visit in the corporations give them a tour or something like that.  I don't think the government really has like spies in corporations or anything like that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Really monitor them.  You know.
L:  No, you're right, I don't think they've had spies in there.  They might think they ought to now after everything that happened, but ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.
R:  But, um, I don't know, my parents work for Exxon Mobil, and like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my mom was telling me, like the Exxon, like, really was like works on moral business, and like after that whole Enron thing --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they had a bunch of meetings, like telling everybody, like, just be good, and like don't mess up like Enron did.  So.  
L:  Well --
R:  Um, I think, like, it's really different corporations like act differently.  And it's kinda sad that that happens to so many people.  So.
L:  I agree.  And, ah, of course what you're mom's saying, if the, if up at the head the company's telling everybody to do that and try to do the right thing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're definitely got to start up there to get some good leadership for sure.
R:  Right.
L:  Because, ah, it did leave a lot of those people, and especially I guess Enron probably is the company we know the most about that people got, ah, got into it.  But, um, yeah, it's got to be people's -- the way they look at things, how they want to do business, whether like you said earlier they're just out to line their pockets with money, or whether they're in, in for it really realizing how many people are going to be affected, not just them.
R:  Yes.  
L:  And, um -- but I'll say that it's definitely affected a lot of people and unfortunately, um, most of them in the negative.  And ah --
R:  Yeah, I'm from Houston actually where Enron was based.  So like I -- like one of my friend's dad's worked for Enron and he lost a lot of money and stuff, so.
L:  Yeah, I remember seeing some buy on one of the news shows, Twenty Twenty or something, and he had retired thinking he had -- oh, I don't know, I'm not sure whether it was a million dollars.  But anyway, a tremendous amount of money, he had bought this huge horse farm and all these horses, and I think his payments were like ten thousand dollars a month, and then by the time Enron -- well, all that came out, I think his stock was worth maybe a thousand dollars and he was going to have to sell everything 'cause he couldn't even make the monthly payments --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and he'd worked for them for a number of years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I guess the thing that aggravates me so about Enron is that, um, even after all that, then hear the guy that they were taking to court's flying in in a company jet.  So here --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the poor lowly employees have nothing, but the ones still higher up that made all the money in the first place still have some of the perks of the business, so.
R:  Yeah.  That's pretty bad.
L:  But I'd say that's -- but that's encourage that your mom said that her company's talked to everybody.  So it sounds like, you know, some of the companies may do -- start on their own.
R:  Yeah, I -- I don't think the government has the power to really regulate these companies.  I think the companies have to, like, take it upon themselves and just learn from other companies' mistakes, you know.  
L:  Yeah.  I mean, at some point you do have to take some blame and some thought and take responsibility for it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's for sure.  And, ah -- 'cause I agree, I don't think the government -- government's probably got enough people to do it, enough money to do it, time and effort and all that other stuff, so I'd say a lot of the businesses, and maybe -- I don't know, have some kind of overseer type person that every now and then can just go in, or, you know, kind of like the IRS does the rest of us.  If our books or our taxes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- don't look right, they just audit you. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  And do a check like --
R:  Yeah.  I mean, that makes sense.
L:  Yeah, do something like that.  Um, it has definitely affected the stock market and everything else, any financial billings, and even if you were, you know, like for instance, um, when I mentioned MCI, when -- I mean, when they filed bankruptcy, all of the companies that had anything to do with telecommunication, whether they were innocent or not, it didn't matter, their stock went down and affected --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- everybody like that too.  So it's --
R:  Yeah, 'cause people lose trust in those companies.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So.
L:  Yeah, and I, and I think the government's not going to make people trust those companies again, they're going to have to do that all by themselves.
R:  Yeah, it just takes time, a lot of it.
L:  Yep, I agree.  But, ah, it does look like people are getting back in the stock market a little bit, that seems to go up, so hopefully maybe just, um, with companies taking a stand, and I do know -- I can't remember now what it was the government did, but it seems like several months ago, um, I heard them say they had passed something saying that if you had caught -- were caught overestimating your value or something like that there was a huge penalty, so --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and they gave the companies, you know, like sixty days, if you wanted to maybe change your information --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but after that anybody that did it or was found falsifying were gonna get a big penalty or something --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, ah, of course I didn't hear of any companies that came out and said their figures were incorrect, but, ah, they kinda had a little grace period there, and, ah, I'm sure that they realised the government is watching them maybe a little bit, whereas before, I think -- I mean, really who would ever thought that?  I don't -- my brain doesn't work that way.  I wouldn't of thought about trying to falsify the price of something, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as with Enron they said it went up so much that people should of realised it was just one of those too good to be trues, but it kept going, and for months, and years.  So it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you would think if it was false it would of fallen after a little while, but boy when it did fall it -- what is that saying?  The bigger they are the harder the fall.  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I do.  I do sympathize with those employees that -- who had no choice.  And of course one thing the government has done now, they've, um -- I think that law has been passed that now you can only have a certain percentage of your money in the stock in the company that you work for.
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  So that's one thing they changed, um, because like with Enron, everybody had their money in Enron.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, so that's changed.  So that should help some, I would think.  Um.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, you know, it's some little things they're doing, but I -- I personally don't know anything that I'd recommend that they'd do to, to make that change.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I think things will get better with time.  I mean, I, I have confidence in that, I mean, this I don't think will happen a lot.  I think people will learn and improve.  I mean, still people are gonna make mistakes, it's inevitable, but I think everything's gonna be okay.
L:  I agree.  I think people will -- generally most people are pretty trustworthy, so they'll -- may stay out for a little while, but then they'll think things are okay and they'll get back in and go for it again. 
R:  Mhm.  Yep.
L:  And, ah, then if the -- if some, if some of the new regulations the government's passed will probably work well, and for those that don't, um, but hopefully there won't ever be another scandal like Enron, or even MCI for that matter.  Of course, MCI's still doing business --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so at least they weren't like Enron that they totally went out of business and had to, to sell everything.  So they're still operating and they still have some employees working, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- theirs wasn't as
