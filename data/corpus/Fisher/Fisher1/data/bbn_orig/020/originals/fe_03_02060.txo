L:  Hi.
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, I'm Barbara Maddocks[?] from New York.
L:  I'm Heather -- uh, I'm Heather Williams.
R:  Oh, hi, Heather.  How are you?
L:  Yeah, okay.
R:  Good.  Um, the topic is, ah, sports.  Um, indoor or outdoor, cold weather or hot weather?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What do you like?
L:  Um, I -- I don't like cold weather.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Where --
L:  I li-
R:  -- where do you live?
L:  I live in Pennsylvania.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, so we get -- um, we get a good bit of snow, but I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I play outdoors with  my son but I don't particularly [SIGH] care.  I don't like being cold. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't ski.  I don't do any of those things.  I --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- do snowman with my little boy.  [LAUGH]
R:  Where in Pennsylvania are you?
L:  Uh, we're in southeast Pennsylvania.
R:  'Cause I used to live in, um, Vincehill[?].  Do you know where that is?  Is that --
L:  Yeah, I'm about thirty minutes to an hour from there.  I'm not exactly sure.  We're southeast of the ci- of Philadelphia.
R:  Right, right, mm.  Okay.  Um, so you don't like cold and you don't like skiing so ...
L:  Not -- not really.
R:  -- what sport -- what sport do you like?
L:  Um ... I -- I don't really -- I used to play field hockey when I was younger.  I don't particularly go for any sports per se.
R:  Mm.
L:  I ju- I like to be outdoors.  I garden.  I have a vegetable garden every -- well, this is the first year I've had one.  We just bought our home.
R:  Oh, congratulations.
L:  Oh, thank you.  So, we -- oh --
R:  How do you like being a homeowner?
L:  Oh I -- I love it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I love it.  We have a huge yard, so it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's all fenced in so we're outside as -- every nice day that we have and ... taken my two year old, "Let's get out of the house and go play".
R:  Ooh.
L:  "Enjoy the sunshine".
R:  Oh, that's nice, yeah.
L:  Take walks with him every day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Put him in the ba- I have a five month old as well.  Sort of, like, the only sport I do is, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- put the kids in the --
R:  Watching them, playing with them, uh ...
L:  Playing with them, put them in the stroller and take walks around the neighborhood --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because we have a nice neighborhood where we can walk up to the store and things like that.
R:  Mm.  How long have you been there?
L:  [LIPSMACK] We've lived here since September.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, like -- good.  Um, let me see what I like.  I like, um -- actually I like most sports, um, all kinds of recreation.  I -- I do ski, um, not as much as I like to.  I used to go more regularly, but I try to get -- I try to go at least once a season but, um, I have to admit I haven't been lately.  Um, I also like golf -- I love golf.  Um, so that's a warm weather sport.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and I also go to the gym.  I prefer to be outside, but, um, you know, in a pinch, I'll, uh -- inside is better than nothing at all.
L:  Yes.  See, I don't -- I don't like gyms, but I feel like I'm really scared and [inaudible] watching me I'll just --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- put my yoga videos and stuff on in the house if I can't get outside and -- and chase my kids around and play with them.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Or do things with them ...
R:  Mhm, mm.
L:  -- but, um, yeah, my husband enjoys golfing, but I --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I don't normally go.  The closest skiing mountain to here is about two hours away so --
R:  Mm.  Mm.
L:  And it's a little on the expensive side.  Since we're new homeowners, my husband likes to go but ... you know, a hundred dollars for the -- get the lift and --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- the food and everything once you get there.
R:  Right, yeah, it is expensive.
L:  It's like, you know what?  [LAUGH]
R:  It is expensive, right.
L:  We could do something else with that money.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, golf is expensive too in a way.  I mean -- you know, by the time you buy all the different clubs and stuff like that. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Does he belong to a club?
L:  No, he doesn't belong to a -- any club.  There's a couple of, uh, ones around.  It's like thirty dollars and you don't have to really belong to a club around here.
R:  Uh, public courses?
L:  Yeah, I guess that's what they are.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  I don't know.  He'll go ... with -- with my cousin and a couple of his buddies once in a while.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He really enjoys that.
R:  But you don't go?
L:  No [SIGH].   Somebody's gotta take care of the kids. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I haven't tried it yet.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I might like it but I haven't really -- you know, I've done the miniature golf but I've -- never do- tried ...
R:  Regular golf?
L:  -- regular golf.
R:  Right.  You should try it.  You might li- see, it's nice because -- I think because it doesn't involve, um, I -- I -- I hate to use this word, but brutality.  I mean, you know, it's not --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as physical and violent.  You're not up against an opponent --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- where you're -- you know, you're knocking them out or they're knocking you out or you're colliding or whatever.
L:  Yeah, like --
R:  So, um --
L:  -- football or soccer or ...?
R:  Yeah, exactly, exactly.  So, um, I mean, it's sort of a more genteel sport and I think I -- that appeals to me.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, more -- more of you against yourself --
R:  Yes, exactly.
L:  -- as opposed to you against all these other people?
R:  Yes, exactly.  Um --
L:  I -- I plan on running my son -- enrolling my son in sports --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when he gets a little outdoor, like, you know, kiddy t-ball and soccer and those kinds of things when he gets a little bit older.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And let him cho- try it, see if he likes it and if he doesn't like it, well, finish the season and if you don't like it you don't have to do it again.
R:  Right, right.  And is your five year old a boy -- ah, five month old a boy or a girl.
L:  Uh, she's a little girl.
R:  Ooh.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, one of each.
R:  Oh, that's nice.  That's [inaudible].
L:  Although really I want to enroll my son in -- in dance this -- this fall.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  He seems to really like it any time we see anything on ... on TV or music comes on, he's immediately ... we could be outside and he'll just start spinning and spinning and spinning and --
R:  Ooh, how interesting, huh?  Any musical inclinations in your family?  Do you think that's where he got it from?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I was in chorus --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but that's -- uh, I mean, there's no instruments.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  He -- he's very artistic too.
R:  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Hm, that's pretty interesting.  Well, it'll be interesting --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to see what happens with the two of them, you know?  She'll probably turn into the soccer player --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and he'll be the -- he'll turn to the ballet, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I forget what the men's ballet is called, but, uh --
L:  Yeah, or the brooding artist.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Heaven forbid.  Brooding artists don't make any money.  That's --
L:  Oh, dear.  No, not 'til they're dead anyway. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, does your husband do any other sports besides golf?
L:  Um, no, no.  We just generally keep -- keep outdoors a lot.  He does a lot of carpentry work for the house and --
R:  Mhm
L:  -- buil- he's building -- currently he's building, uh, planter boxes and -- and seats to go around the outside edge of our deck.
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  So, we just -- we just like to keep outside and keep -- you know, do whatever we need to do and just be outside as much as possible.
R:  Right, right.  Was it already fenced in when you bought it, or you fenced it?
L:  It was already fenced in when we bought this house --
R:  Mhm, oh, right.
L:  -- so that was very luck.
R:  Ooh, okay.  That must have been one of the attractions for it, right?
L:  Oh [LIPSMACK], oh yeah.  Oh, yeah.  
R:  Mm.
L:  For me I bought the yard and took the house with it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's like this yard is the one I want.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, that was very well put.  Very well put.  Does your husband -- do you -- have you set up any kind of rec- recreational, um, stuff in your yards?  You know, any kind of sports things like nets or -- for tennis or volleyball or anything like that?
L:  Um, actually, we're buying -- I -- I do a lot of +couponing and rebate things --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and if you buy all the Scots[?] ... the whole season forth of your Scots brand products from your brass --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you can send away and get a free volleyball kit.
R:  Oh!
L:  So, we're getting that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  What's in the kit?
L:  The net, the ball and you can either do -- it -- it's badmin- it's got the badminton set, the two -- the two badminton racks and the -- the birdie, and a volleyball and the net.
R:  Oh.
L:  The volleyball or -- or badmin[?] and then you could also get a croquet set.
R:  Oh, okay.  All right, so you --
L:  I can just see my little boy in a croq- wooden mallet --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [several inaudible words].  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Just [inaudible] joy.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  So, you're gonna send for the, uh, volleyball?
L:  Yeah, we're gonna send for that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we have a swing set set up.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And all kinds of, you know [COUGH] play toys and stuff for him out in the yard: slide and sandbox and cars.  He runs around and five or six different balls that we chase and throw and I'm looking for a t-ball set for him at yard sales --
R:  Mhm
L:  -- that he can play with.  And we just bought a kite so we can go run and pl- fly the kite.
R:  Oh, how nice.  He must be happy, huh?
L:  Yeah, he is.  He's a very happy little guy.  Very busy.  He's very sad today because it's raining.
R:  Oh, yes.  It was raining here also, right, right.  So, he's stuck indoors, huh?
L:  Yeah, he's getting a little antsy.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Which means you're getting antsy.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, big time.
R:  I think tomorrow -- tomorrow's supposed to be nice so ...
L:  I'm hop- I'm hoping, so there's a lot of flea markets and yard sales tomorrow and we'll go to those and I'll look the picnic table and the t-ball set and the other outdoor toys for him.
R:  Mm, mm.  Well, that sounds good.  [LAUGH] My -- were you in an apartment before you bought the house?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, we were. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  We -- when we found out we were having baby number two, said, "Hmm, [LIPSMACK] better do something about this".  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, right.  It's time to move.  Exactly.
L:  Time to buy a home.
R:  Yes.  Uh, now do you find it, um, taxing to keep up with the yard?  You know, a lot of, um, things like doing -- having to do with the grass and cutting it and all that kinda stu-
L:  Not so far.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  But we bought it so late in the season --
R:  Mhm.
L:  We bought it -- we bought the home in September so we only had to take care of the lawn from September to like November was the last time I think we mowed it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, you know, most of the weeds were done at that point so we're just finding ... how -- how often we're gonna have to move it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we've been going around weeding the dandelions out ...
R:  Mm.
L:  I haven't got any of the stuff because I'm -- I -- I don't like to be spraying the toxic stuff if I'm -- I -- I'm breastfeeding our daughter.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't want to have the chemicals on my skin.
R:  Right, right.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  So, you're just pulling them out by hand?
L:  So, I've been doing it the old -- well, I'm doing it the old fashioned way with the -- the long handled weed thing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you put down in the ground and pull the weed up --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that way.
R:  Right.
L:  And ... I --
