R:  Hello. 
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] How are you?
L:  I'm fine, thank you.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.
L:  Uh, I'm Helen and, uh, I think I heard the topic.  I'm not sure, it kind of got muffled.
R:  Yeah, it was a long one tonight. [SIGH]
L:  I -- yeah, I thought so.
R:  Right. 
L:  Something to do with, what, the government and business scandal? 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Ah.
R:  What they can do to, uh, prevent that kind of thing and how it affects us.
L:  Oh, boy. [LAUGH]
R:  My name's Crystal.  
L:  Hi, Crys- --
R:  I'm here, I'm in T- -- I'm in Houston, Texas.  I don't know where you're at.
L:  Oh, I'm in Maine.
R:  Maine, okay.  Well -- 
L:  Yep, I'm in, uh -- 
R:  Quite a distance.
L:  -- actually a very small town on the coast of Maine.
R:  Wow! 
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE]
R:  Okay.  Um, as far as how they can prevent it, um, gosh, you know, I don't know.  I don't want more government in anybody's business.  As it is, is -- I think there's a lot of government intervention.
L:  I agree.  I agree, um -- 
R:  I don't know how they can do it without being in the business more and that's scary, I think. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, you're -- you're right.  That's true.  I -- I don't -- actually I don't work outside the home, so I -- 
R:  Ne- neither do I.  Not -- not right now.  I have a --
L:  -- [LAUGH] which makes it a little bit difficult because I really don't have anything to do with business per se but, uh, I don't know.  I don't know.  It -- it's just really something to think about because I guess I don't really think about it where I'm not involved that much.  Um, I don't play the stock market so I, you know, that, anything to do with that scandal has nothing to do -- you know, and I guess that's not a good way to be, but when you live in Maine, that's -- you're kind of, sort of removed from all of the just, you know, stuff that goes on in Washington and -- and even -- even with the war, you know, just --  
R:  Right.
L:  You're involved but it's not the same as if you're living in the middle of it.
R:  Right.  Um, I'm here in Houston and I guess you know with the big Enron scandal, not too long ago, I guess -- 
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  That -- that -- that actually did affect me a little personally because at the time I was working temp jobs, you know, just clerical and administrative here and there -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and as soon as that happened and everybody was laid off, those jobs went quick and -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know -- 
L:  That definitely would affect --
R:  I mean, highly skilled people were going for, you know, clerical jobs just to have something to -- to work at.
L:  Mm.  Mhm.  Yeah.  I actually -- -- I heard -- you know, I love the news and I don't -- I like all the news programs, so I kind of -- that's how I keep up on everything that's going on, is, you know, the Datelines and the Twenty Twenty and the Sixty Minutes and, uh, you know, programs like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So actually I have to be honest and I know a little about it, but I don't know a lot about what went down at that particular, you know, that particular one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...  
R:  What do you think, um, the government can do to prevent that kind of thing?
L:  [SIGH] I don't know.  I really don't know.  You know, it -- it amazes me how much goes on and it takes so long for them to get caught.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, that -- that obviously they are not being policed very closely -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- but then, I don't know, and then, you know, then -- then you say, you know, the government's too involved, so ...   
R:  Right.  In my opinion, I think that the government should -- should not get that involved and people should have their own police within the company.  You know, they had some whistle blowers on -- at Enron, but, I mean, more people should have access to, you know, what happens at board meetings and behind the scenes stuff from the higher up people.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  And you have -- you have to wonder how much, uh -- I don't know what they call it now, but, uh, payola, or, you know, how much is being paid for people to keep quiet.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, uh -- I don't know, because, uh, obviously there has to be, there has to be.  I mean more than one person knows what's going on, so there has to be a lot of secrecy, I guess.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure there's a lot of people not talking because they were -- were paid.
L:  I would -- I would.  Aha.  Right.  Right, or looking the other way.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  I don't know.  I'm -- I -- when I was working I was a bookkeeper.
R:  Oh. 
L:  And, uh, but, you know, uh, to be honest I couldn't tell you how to, you know, how to, uh, embezzle if my life depended on it -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Sounds good. 
L:  Obviously -- obviously there are other people out there that know how.
R:  Right.
L:  But that's just not something I've ever, you know, because I had it happen, you know, in a company I worked.  I -- I took six weeks off and the person that they hired to do my job did that and it's, like, I went back to work six weeks later because they called me back in and I'm thinking, "How come I worked here for all these years and never" -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Number one, it never crossed my mind -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  -- and, number two, I wouldn't know how to do it, anyway, [LAUGH] so --
R:  Yeah, and it's scary that somebody who -- brand new to that -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Can just come in and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  "Oh, I'm going to do this".
L:  Mhm, yeah, within a very short period of time, so, you know, we're talking on a low scale here, so -- but you can just imagine when you're talking a lot more money, a lot more, you know, higher up positions and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, so, yeah. 
R:  So when you got to work, were they -- did they put any, um, limits on w- -- I mean did they change your job to make to where, you know, it was harder to do that or did they just say, "Well, you've been doing it for so long that just keep doing what you do, we trust you"? 
L:  They just kept -- they kept it the same way.  They fired him and, uh, they didn't press charges.  It wasn't a great deal of money but the fact was he did embezzle it, so they fired him and hired me back and, you know, that was -- and actually I -- I -- I didn't want to be hired back because I w- wanted to stay home with my kids, I have four kids.  At that time I had three -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I, you know, it was just too much working and trying to -- I live -- I was a single mother so it was like, "Oh, no, I can't", it was too much.  Babysitters were hard to find.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you know, at that time, but I did, I went back and stayed until the place actually got closed down a couple of years later, so ... [LIPSMACK] but that's my only real dealings that I've ever had with anything, you know, anything like that, so...  I don't, as I say, I don't play the big -- I don't play the stock market, so anything like that does not affect me personally, but I certainly -- I've heard, you know, I've heard about it.  I'm trying to think another one besides, um, [LIPSMACK] that one you just mentioned was Enron?  Enron? 
R:  Enron, yeah.  Um, I can't think of anything right -- 
L:  No, I can't either.  I can't right, not off the top of my head right now, um, but there's, like -- well, we even have it in the army, I mean in the services, you know, all the -- the stuff that goes on and the -- the equipment that's being bought for, like, toilet seats for hundreds and hundreds of dollars and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, so -- and someone, you know, someone up there pays for it, so I mean I realize it's us, the taxpayers, but it's, uh, you know, someone OKs the cheques, pays the bills -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, so ... 
R:  They should scrutinize that a little bit more -- 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- better -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- than what -- I saw a quote the other day that said, um, someone was asking -- they were checking in on stuff, "Why did you charge the", I think it was the army or the navy, "a thousand dollars for a pair of pliers?" and the person who sold them was, like, "Well, these are very versatile, they could clip the item on and take it off" and it's like --  
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  It was just they were regular pliers.
L:  Right.
R:  They sold for a thousand dollars.
L:  Right.  I mean that's -- I guess that's been going on for a long time, at least I remember when it was first being talked about -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, uh, you know, someone's getting the money, obviously, right?
R:  Right.
L:  So, um, I -- I don't know.  [MN] When that is happening in the government, then, you know, you have to wonder how, you know, how are they expecting companies then to, you know, keep their -- 
R:  Exactly.  The government should be the one that -- 
L:  Like you say, if we can't keep the government of all places on the up and up, how do we expect to keep, you know, companies.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and I mean just another, uh, another, uh, um, yeah, example is -- is the, you know, how -- how salaries, what salaries are given to people, you know, I mean the high up people?  I mean, why -- why are people that don't do half the work, the laborers get paid zilch -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and the guys who sit behind the desk and push a pencil get the mil- -- you know, millions or whatever, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it is pretty --
R:  And -- and business can be really slow and people getting laid off, uh, you know, the lower down people.  Yet they are still making their -- 
L:  Yep.
R:  -- multi thousand dollar bonuses and -- 
L:  Yep.  Very, very true.  Heaven forbid they shouldn't do -- get their money, right?
R:  Right.
L:  Right, so, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  Uh, there's something not right [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, there's -- just with -- just with that and the fact of the, uh, you know, the -- the salaries that are paid our sports figures, our entertainment figures or, you know [MN] -- 
R:  Right, and the -- the important stuff, you know, like teachers, they're [inaudible] -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- lower paid people.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  My -- my ex mother- -- 
R:  Child care workers.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  My ex -- my ex mother in law was a -- a teacher and my father in law was a principal and, you know, if it wasn't for people like --
