R:  Hi, my name is Carla.
L:  Um, my name is Liz.
R:  Hi, Liz.  [NOISE] Um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I actually -- I like outdoor activities better, um, especially when it's warm because, um, I'm a person -- I like -- I like the weather and I like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I like being outside.  I'm very active.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, so I -- I'm very much into, um, [NOISE] walking and biking and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- pretty much moving around, so, um, especially it being warm right now, um, I like to be outside --
L:  Makes sense.
R:  -- rather than being inside.
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm kind --
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  I'm kind of ambig- -- it's -- it's kind [inaudible] of two minds.  Um, I'm really am [NOISE] essentially a very lazy person, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Mm. 
L:  -- so for me to go out and do [NOISE] the running or the walking or anything is -- is not so much -- I do enjoy doing things like cross country skiing in the cold weather, but I --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- enjoy getting out and gardening and pottering around my lawn in the warm weather.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I just feel more outdoorsy I think in the warm weather too.
R:  Yeah, I think that -- that makes a huge difference because you really -- you really don't want to be running around outside too much when it's cold.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [NOISE] But, I mean, [MN] with my -- with my job, I mean, I'm -- I'm very, very active.  You know, I'm on my feet running around. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So I think that has a lot to do with wanting to get outside too, because you are inside all day, you know.
L:  Right. 
R:  So, I mean, I -- I think that has a lot to do with it too.  Um, how 'bout you?  Um, does your work involve you running around doing a lot of, um, you know, activity like -- 
L:  Actually --
R:  -- walking and running? 
L:  -- my job is extraordinarily sedentary.  I work, um, at a call centre and I work third shift.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  So all I do --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- is sit and -- and take calls and do customer service all night long.  So, um, I think that for me too is that I -- I spend [MN] much of the day sleeping, and so I'm only really awake from about four o'clock on, and I think that really has a -- you know, a difference as far as what you do as -- you know, I -- I really should get out and -- and do more active, ah, -- you know, just to -- to actually do something, but I don't know. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Um, but, like, on your days off do you -- do you find that you are running around trying to catch up with, ah, a lot of stuff that you are not able to do during the week, like you feel like you had to do laundry and -- and grocery shopping and all that you have to do all in one shop pretty much?  [NOISE]  
L:  I do, yes.  I have, ah, basically half a Friday and all of Saturday that I do everything, so my -- my Fridays are usually -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the, ah, -- the shopping and laundry days and -- and Saturday I spend trying to keep up with either the snow shoveling out -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, or -- or my gardening or whatever, and it's kind of nice.  The kids enjoy being around the dirt.  So we are actually losing a lot of lawn and gaining a lot of garden lately. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's good.
L:  They just dig --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for me. [LAUGH] 
R:  Your -- your kids are really, ah, a big push to get you out.
L:  They are, they are.  I think, honestly, had I, you know, my own way -- I'm, like I said, pretty sedentary -- I'd probably sit around and -- and read all day, but the kids enjoy being out, so we -- we try and do as much as we can outside.
R:  That's -- that's one indoor activity that I enjoy very much too, is reading.  I feel like every day I have to -- I have to read something like the paper or a magazine or -- or something that, you know, [MN] 'cause you gotta keep your -- your mind going too.  I mean, I really agree with you on that.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  I --
R:  What -- what -- 
L:  -- feel -- 
R:  -- kind of books --
L:  I'm sorry. 
R:  What kind of books are you, ah, -- are you interested in in terms of, um, reading as an indoor activity?  Do you have favorites? 
L:  Um, I do, and my husband just laughs at me.  I really enjoy kind of the sci fi, ah, fluff.  You know, things like Piers Anthony and Stephen Bruce.   
R:  Wow.
L:  Um, so I -- that's what I enjoy and [MN] my other deep, dark confession is that I -- I love to read cookbooks. [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow.  [NOISE] That's very [NOISE] surprising, because I find that when I go to the book store [NOISE] I always -- I always tend to -- I'm looking for something to read I always tend towards either, like, sci fi fantasy [NOISE], like you are talking about, [NOISE] or I tend towards, um, arts, crafts and hobbies.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Like, um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- things on antique dolls or coins or -- or -- or things that -- [MN] or on [inaudible] nature.
L:  Mhm.  Now do you --
R:  So --
L:  -- do you participate in collecting antiques?
R:  Um, actually my, um, -- my, [NOISE] um, -- my hobby right now for [MN] -- in terms of an indoor activity would be, um, I collect Hummel figurines.
L:  Mm.
R:  Have you ever heard of Hummel figurines?
L:  I have, yes.  We lived in, ah, -- in Germany for quite a while and they were every damn place you turned. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, that's -- that's kind of like my thing now, but you have to save up for them because they are so expensive.  So it takes -- it takes a while to really get the money together and then see one you really like.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But where I'm at, um, [NOISE] there's a store where you can -- you can put money down on [inaudible], so that -- that kind of works out good.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  So that's kind of like my -- that's my hobby right now -- my -- my big hobby.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I'm going to see how it does from there.
L:  That's interesting.  What I do, um, -- what I did for quite a while before I, um, took this most recent job is I, um, bought and resold antique glass.  So that actually is my passion --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- and, ah -- so, [MN] [NOISE] [inaudible] looking around my office now and I actually, um, -- I collected for a long time the carnival glass, and that was all of my activities.  I went, ah, to auctions and -- and flea markets and -- and wandered around, but now what I'm doing is the smaller tumblers, and I just have tons and tons of these.  I'm looking around and just kind of glowing with pride.  I love my -- my -- my collection of tumblers.
R:  Sounds interesting because [NOISE] -- I mean, [NOISE] I think it's really beautiful, and you don't see it very often, all because it's so rare is that, ah, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is the depression glass.
L:  Yes, yes. [NOISE] 
R:  And, um, I don't know -- I know there is a particular gla- -- brand that's, like, really -- I can't think of it off the top of my head, but [NOISE], um, it's really -- there's a certain type of depression glass that's really, ah [NOISE], really popular.
L:  Well, the colored glass right now is incredibly popular and there -- and there's, you know, so many different kinds.  They have the clear and they have the pressed and -- and then you have the etched and it's -- it's actually a very -- that's [several inaudible words] so what I did for so long and I just have -- I have stacks [NOISE] and stacks of [NOISE] books about all the different kinds.  I just enjoyed it so much.
R:  Wow. 
L:  It's, ah, very indepth [LAUGH], which goes along with my reading thing.  I -- I'd snuggle up in bed with a good glass book. [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow, that's -- that's really fascinating.  There's a little -- there's a little [NOISE] shop not too far from, um, where I used to live [NOISE] that, um, -- that -- that's all they do, is they -- they -- they blow and make their own glass. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, how fun.
R:  And -- and I have been there a couple of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- times and it's just like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, they have a little area in the -- in the back where they do it, and they can't take you back there, but, I mean, they have pictures and you can -- you can, um, like, put in orders, you know, if there's something specific that you --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- want that you don't see.  It's just -- it's just really, really neat.  They take you through the process of -- of glassblowing and -- 
L:  I -- 
R:  -- it's just -- 
L:  I think that's just --
R:  -- it's just really beautiful.
L:  -- amazing that they can manipulate the -- the glass like that.
R:  I know.  It's -- it's just incredible that it turns out the way that it does.  [PAUSE] [MN] So --
L:  I --
R:  I -- I mean, [NOISE] it -- it seems like -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- when you think about it, though -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, really, even with, you know, your indoor activities --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, it's -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- really pretty multifaceted, really.
L:  I think they really are.  I just -- I'd love to have, you know, more time to -- to pursue what I, you know, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- ah, truly enjoy, which is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- definitely not answering calls at this call centre [LAUGH] that I work at.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But there's, I mean -- yeah, I think that just as -- as far as myself I try and -- try and balance them out.  You know, when [NOISE] doing the glass I spent a lot of time researching [inaudible], but then, ah, we were near quite a few huge flea markets, and I would -- and the kids and I would go and -- and take a picnic basket and -- and walk around these stalls [NOISE] and -- and, ah, you know, then go to the -- you know, go to the -- the side park and have a picnic, and there was, ah, -- you know, there's a park for them to play on, and we would do that also.  So I think that you can actually do -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- both if you have to tie this into indoor and outdoor activities.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, with having kids, I mean, you really have to -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [MN] to keep a balance because what -- what they want to go and do and what you want to do could be two entirely different things.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  You know.  So, I mean, I -- I g- -- I give you a lot of credit there.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't have any kids right now, so -- so, um, I don't know, I pretty much -- if I'm not too tired I try to -- I try to get out as much as I can.
L:  And that's difficult too sometimes.  Like, you know, I -- I know that for health reasons --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- you should be out in the sun and it -- and it helps you sleep better, it makes you a healthier person, but, ah, you know, it's -- it's hard to balance just the whole, um, -- you know, just what you want to do and what you should be doing too.
R:  Yeah.  Well, there's [several inaudible words] --
