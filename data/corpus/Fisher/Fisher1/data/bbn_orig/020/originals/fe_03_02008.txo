L:  My name is Marie. 
R:  My name is Chrissy.  How are you? 
L:  I'm fine.  I live here in Kansas city, Missouri.  Where are you c- -- uh, calling from? 
R:  I'm from New York city.
L:  New York city? 
R:  Yes.
L:  I have a daughter in Syracuse --  
R:  Oh.
L:  -- New York, yeah.  Actually -- 
R:  Close, but not that close to here. [LAUGH]
L:  Huh? 
R:  I said close, but not that close to here. Yeah.
L:  Uh, she's actually in Fayetteville, uh, just outside of Syracuse. 
R:  Oh, right.  I know -- I -- I actually had a friend that lived up there so I'm familiar with that area.
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  Yeah.  They live in Camillus, which is right around there, too.
L:  Who is?
R:  It -- it's a town called Camillus right up there.
L:  I know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I, uh, was up there for a couple of months, you know, and stayed and so I got -- I'm pretty well familiar with the little, uh, villages around up there.  It's really pretty up there.
R:  It is very nice up there.
L:  Well, this subject, I'm not sure.  She wants to know wha- -- [SIGH] if, uh -- 
R:  Basically they want to know, um, I think it's more or less a business ethics kind of question.
L:  Right.  Is it -- it's scandal and -- 
R:  You know, I think that they're trying to get us the whole Enron thing and how that affected people.  I personally don't invest in the stock market because I've always felt like it was sort of a form of legal gambling, so -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for me it really didn't affect me very much because I've always been -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- smarter than that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, you know, I've always believed, like, in government type of bonds and things like that which are a little bit more secure.
L:  Secure, yes.  That --
R:  But my pension plan, though, is because I don't have an option, because I'm a teacher here -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- I don't have an option.  It is actually corporate bonds, like corporate kind of stock thing.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I had, um, mine was when I worked for a restaurant company for thirty three years and of course I had everything in 401K.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then when I, um, rolled the 401K out, why I did go to an investment person and -- I've got my grandson tonight and he's pounding the piano here [NOISE] -- um, [NOISE] I put it into an -- an investment so I haven't really lost anything.
R:  So I guess it didn't really affect you, but what do you think for curbing, I mean I don't know -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  There -- there's almost no way of curbing it because it's really, in terms of corporations, it's an individual by individual thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, you could have rules set up in your company that you don't do certain things, but if you have someone who doesn't follow those rules -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it doesn't quite matter what the company -- you know what I mean, like -- like, for example, like, a friend of mine works for a barrister and they have a rule right now that you actually cannot travel to Hong Kong -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but people have clients over there, they're not going to follow that rule because they're going to lose a lot of money -- 
L:  Yes.  
R:  -- you know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  So it -- it's a little bit of a difficult thing.  I mean, you know -- 
L:  I just think that because I -- coming from a corporation company and I've seen this happen where the corporate, head corporate people, uh, spend a lot of money on going on trips and things for themselves and they don't pay the employees, the little people enough and the -- they actually, some of them can actually drain the company and I kind of think that that's what Enron did.  They -- 
R:  Well, yeah, I mean that's -- it's pretty clear it was the big guys and they just messed up the little guys.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You know, not only in terms of like what you're saying, like just draining the company, you know, taking away from their salaries, but I mean in the end they took away their pensions.  I mean -- 
L:  Sure.
R:  -- people who invested their entire life savings, it was just gone.
L:  Sure.  Sure, and some of them had worked for quite some time and they were thinking that they were going to just finish their years out there until they retired and -- 
R:  Well, that's the thing.  I always think like the government somehow could -- should be involved in this whole thing because it's sort of like an FDIC sort of thing where, if you do invest in a certain company and you do work for them, I feel like there should be some kind of -- I don't know if there's going -- like, uh, some kind of an insurance.  I mean, it's hard to do because every company is different, but -- 
L:  Yeah.  But the --
R:  It just seems really unfair. 
L:  Yeah, it is, but the government just can't be involved in everything -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and I just think that, you know, um, some of these companies, like I say, the, uh, president, vice-president, C- COEs or CEOs and, you know, they are driving the big, fancy cars and, uh, going on the trips and shipping their golf clubs and -- and then you've got -- they're downsizing and letting people go and these people, you know, that are losing their jobs and they are expecting the other people to pick up the slack and to do the extra work and they don't want to pay them any more for it.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I just don't know how it -- but, see, I don't un- -- I -- I mean it's a tough topic because how do you make a corporation more accountable.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You can only make individuals more accountable.
L:  That's true.
R:  And that would be variable depend- -- you know, on each company.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They would have a different set of rules.
L:  Yeah.  But, you know, I -- I think if employees stand up and say anything, they'd probably just lose their jobs.
R:  Well, yeah, that's the thing, I mean, because even if you know that someone is milking the company dry or they don't have the correct corporate kind of ethics, you're not going to say anything if you work under them because you know what the consequence is -- 
L:  Sure.  Sure. 
R:  -- you know, because they're not going to pick you over them.
L:  That's right.
R:  You know, like a little person over a big guy is just not going to happen.
L:  No.  No.  They would let you go because they figured they can just get somebody else in off the street to replace you.
R:  Exactly.  I mean, that's the whole thing.
L:  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  But the gov- -- 
R:  Yeah, but a lot of big guys, though, were really losing their jobs, too, because they really are downsizing and -- 
L:  Aha.
R:  -- I guess they realize, like, they have to trim --  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the fat up at the top, too.
L:  Yeah.  But, you know, [MN] in some instances I think the government is just as bad.
R:  Well, yeah, I mean, you know, they spent a lot of money on [inaudible] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and things of that nature -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know, and I don't think that they set a very good example and I think that that's also part of it, like, as a country we don't have the greatest of role models, you know.  I mean, in other countries, like, the government is a little bit better at how they spend their money -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, they spend it on health care or they spend it on things -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that are just, that make more sense than what we do here.
L:  Yeah.  I, uh --
R:  I love America, don't get me wrong, but I'm just saying that there are -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- other countries that work better.
L:  I understand.  Uh, I went to, uh, Rome in January and while I was over there their taxes and their pay cheques I guess are just -- I mean they -- it's huge taxes that they take out.
R:  Yeah, it's like fifty per cent, that's right, yeah. 
L:  But they have -- they have free health care and they take care of their senior people, you know and --  
R:  Yeah, well, that's -- you know what, I think that we don't really do that here and I think that if you have a government like who's the big people who are supposedly, you know, the ones that -- because I mean where are corporations going to look to?  They're going to look to -- just like, you know, if you're a lower level employee, you're going look up to the boss to learn how the company works.  I feel like a lot of companies look at the government and, you know, they want to know how they work and they don't -- they're not effective.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, so it makes companies not effective.
L:  Yeah.  I would rather work for, uh, a small company, you know, just, uh, a family owned company than I would a corporation.
R:  Yeah, d- -- I would, too.  I actually, though, I work for the Board of Ed in New York city, which is one of the biggest money wasters, in my opinion.  You know -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they waste a lot of money on office space but for people who don't do anything but tell you -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that they didn't help you.
L:  Yeah.  Now, did you say you were a school teacher? 
R:  I am.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You know, so there's all this crazy red tape to get through.  You know, like in order to change my health insurance, I -- you know, you get to change it in October.
L:  Aha.
R:  It took them from October to January to process the paperwork -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because they're just not efficient and I feel like a lot of companies aren't efficient and that's part of the -- like, I feel like Enron to some degree wasn't efficient.
L:  No.  No.  Well, it wasn't efficient, it wasn't true to its employees and they were just, uh, interested in lining their own pockets.
R:  Yeah, I mean -- 
L:  That was it.
R:  -- it's pretty clear, but it's similar, like, my stepfather works for a funeral home company, a very large one -- 
L:  Aha.
R:  -- and they did a very similar thing.  They were actually, um, there was a Federal case pending against them, basically charging them with being a monopoly -- 
L:  Aha.
R:  -- and all the big guys sold all their stock bef- -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- right before the verdict came in -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- but they didn't tell the employees to do it, so people like my stepfather, who had all of -- for some reason he invested all of his money in that, ended up with nothing.  
L:  Nothing.
R:  I mean, the shares went from, like, forty dollars a share to like sixty cents.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  It was considerable.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, if you have all your -- but I think that's also part of, like, what I'm saying with Enron, that people should have -- I almost feel like they should have known even before then that you have to have your money in different places.  Putting all year eggs in one basket -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you're just going to -- 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- have a basket full of broken eggs.
L:  Well, that's just like with the restaurant company that I -- it -- it was Houlihan's restaurant group and I don't know if you've heard of Houlihan's.
R:  Yeah.  No, they're big.
L:  Yeah and, um, they got to the point, though, where they were holding the vendor's cheques.  They would go ahead and cut the cheques to send out, but they would hold them for another thirty to sixty days before they would mail them out because they were in financial trouble, they were trying to open too many restaurants too fast and then the corporate people were just way spending way too much money and, um, they final- --
