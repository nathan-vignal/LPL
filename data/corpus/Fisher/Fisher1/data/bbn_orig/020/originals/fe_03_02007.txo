R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  This is Kerry Welsh.
R:  Hi.  This is Cathy Porter.  How are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  Oh, I'm great.
L:  You know, I didn't hear the whole question because I had a screaming child I just passed off to dad, so -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  How has -- what -- what can the President do to help curb crime in America, I believe, and how has corporate America affected you -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and how has it affected, uh, the economy.
L:  Okay.
R:  Interesting topic.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My husband would be better at this because he pays attention to the stock market all the time.
R:  Oh, great.  Well, what's been your impression of, uh -- 
L:  I'm [inaudible] Hold on.  I'm doing this -- this study thing.  I need to talk.  Okay.  [several inaudible words] Sit down, please.  [NOISE] Okay.  Sorry.
R:  That's okay.
L:  Um, well, the first thing that comes to mind to me is the, uh, scandals with Enron -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and some of the big companies, um, fixing their books -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I know that we had some -- actually my husband had bought some stock in a company, a local, um, tech company called Peregrine -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or Peregrine and, um, it was like a really fast rising company and it -- I just saw an article in the paper the other day where they -- well, they did go bankrupt.
R:  Oh.
L:  And then [SIGH] the, uh, CEO did admit to fraud and that he had basically cooked the books and, you know, claimed that they had bigger profits than they really did, so -- 
R:  Well, see, that's what I don't understand about the whole thing.  I haven't followed it that closely, but there are generally accepted accounting practices. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Every CPA, when you sit in accounting class this is what you are preached, this is what they preach to you.  There's a way to keep the books, period.  There's one way that is acceptable, everything else is not acceptable.  Fine.  So what happens when you get to corporate America?  There's a whole different set of books?
L:  Right.
R:  A whole different set of rules?
L:  I know what they were doing is that they were counting, um, they had like orders, purchase orders that they had, um, [LIPSMACK] they had loans for and they had sold these loans -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then they were counting these as incoming orders, something to that effect.  I can't remember exactly how they did it but they really kind of twisted things [MN]. 
R:  Yeah, it sounded like they were counting the expenses early.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So that, [MN] well, that's absolutely against accounting practices. 
L:  Are you very familiar with accounting practices? 
R:  Well, a little.
L:  Oh.
R:  A little, and what they were saying just did not make sense to me, why they would even do that because it's not something -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You can bury it for a while -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- but at some point you have to do an audit, especially when you're a major corporation -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it's going show, but, see, then they got some of the big guns accounting firms to go along with this.
L:  Oh, yeah.  What was the name of the, um, Anderson? 
R:  Anderson.  Wasn't -- 
L:  They went along with, um, Enron? 
R:  Yeah.  So, like I said, there's a whole different set of rules when you reach corporate America.
L:  Right.
R:  I can understand wanting to make your stock holders happy, but inflating the numbers for any reason is -- is just simply n- not ethical.
L:  Right, and y- you know, I know that, er, you probably heard this, too.  The other big topic of, uh, interest with corporate, um, bookkeeping type, uh, subject is the offshore -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- um, headquarters.
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  You know, where they are doing that to get, um, the tax breaks? 
R:  I can understand tax breaks.  Th- they need them.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I can understand finding loopholes.
L:  Right.
R:  But you still have to stay on the side of ethics, y- you have to do it the right way.  You can't just, "Well, we want to show this so we've gotta" -- you know, they -- they're starting with the number they want to show and they're getting creative on how to get to that number -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it's wrong, and the way it has hurt people, I mean you have people who are not involved who lost their jobs, who -- and we already have a problem with jobs in America.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So why do we need corporate America making it worse and now what the President can do to stop that, I don't know.
L:  I know [LAUGH].  It's -- it's like way over my head but, um, you know, I guess we, as the average citizen or, uh, people who actually pay attention to current events I guess could, um, you know, write to their congressman or their representatives or whatever -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, is from their state that is their voice in government and basically let them know what our thoughts are and, you know, what can you do about this?
R:  But how -- when -- that's -- that's well and good, I mi- -- understand the letter writing campaigns and the phone campaigns to your congressman and your senator and all that, but when they're standing on the floor, are they really voting our conscience?  They'll say, "I'm going to vote the consensus of my people", but we don't know what that is.
L:  I know.  You really -- I mean, you'd really have to put a lot of time and energy -- 
R:  Yes, you do.
L:  -- into following like [inaudible] [SIGH]
R:  And the average American is not going to do that.
L:  Well, because you can't, you don't have time and -- and I think that the politicians know that -- 
R:  Sure they do.
L:  -- and they basically go where the money is.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I mean, the lobbyists who, you know, the big companies who fund their campaigns -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and give them all the perks and all that -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and how they, you know, they -- I mean, I don't think that there is any solution to make it, um, you know, up, you know, open up.  I mean, I think that that's impossible.
R:  I think it pretty much is.  It -- a friend of mine just a few minutes ago and I were talking on the phone and we said, you know, society has just -- the time is just speeding up, everything is so fast now, and I think everybody is actually afraid to put on the breaks and it -- it's not just corporate America, it's every aspect of our lifestyle.
L:  Oh, right.
R:  Nobody wants to stop and look at the problem any more.
L:  Yeah, I agree.
R:  I -- I guess they kind of figure if we keep running we can outrun it, but it's -- it's only getting worse.
L:  Yeah, that's interesting.
R:  You know, and the only experience I've had with all the results of Enron is sort of the trickle down companies, those -- the feeder companies, because I was working during that time [MN] at the state employment office -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I saw -- oh, my.  Well, it started back with, uh, nine eleven.  A lot of companies fell apart.  We know that -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then the trickle down effect is the smaller companies can't afford to operate any more.
L:  Well, [MN] I know exactly what you're saying because I experienced that first hand.  My husband works for a family business that -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, they put on corporate events, like when, like, Microsoft was in town, you know, they're at a hotel and they have the ballroom, you know, reserved and my husband's company, he's the manager there and his sister and, um, her husband own it, but he, uh, manages the technicians' audio visual text and he set up the computer equipment -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the projectors and what have you.
R:  Right.
L:  And, you know, these were big money events.  Companies have tonnes of money to throw -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- into these types of events.
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, we saw a huge, huge drop in what people were willing to spend -- 
R:  Absolutely. 
L:  -- after nine eleven. 
R:  Absolutely.
L:  So, I mean -- I mean, companies that you wouldn't -- you wouldn't even know about or even know exist are affected by this, you know, such as my husband's company.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  I saw guys fifty years old, which is young -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in today's society, fifty years old, who were -- they used to be called the whiz kids because they were the computer geniuses of the early seventies and eighties.  These guys are being left, uh, being dropped from their companies.
L:  Yeah, that's amazing. 
R:  They're being terminated because they're too old -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because they have a new crop of -- of boy wonders coming in and they're like, "What do I do now?  This is all I've done all my life". 
L:  Gosh.
R:  And I -- there was one guy who stood there in front of me -- 
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- and he was so upset he was trembling -- 
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- and I went to my supervisors because I was kind of afraid of what he might do, he seemed so fragile.
L:  Yeah, you never know.
R:  And I said, um, help me find something for him and the only thing that they could recommend to me right then was seven dollars an hour -- 
L:  Oh my God.
R:  -- at U- -- at UPS hoisting boxes.  
L:  Oh my God.
R:  I said, "This man has worked with his brain all his life and that's a slap in the face.  You -- you can't take someone from the kind of work he's been doing --" 
L:  No.
R:  -- and tell him to put these boxes on the truck. 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  His lifestyle is not set on seven dollars an hour.  That's ridiculous".
L:  Right.
R:  But that's all that was there.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, the -- one of the big bosses came out and talked to him and I don't know what happened after that, but all of this, you know, the -- the Enron, the nine eleven, the whole thing, the state of our economy right now, it's so fragile.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, we may be a superpower to the rest of the world, but internally we're hurting here.
L:  Oh, I know, and, you know, I'm thinking about all the money that was invested in this war and, you know, doesn't the money run out some time?  [MN] How do we -- do we have -- 
R:  Exactly.  How do you -- 
L:  -- an endless supply of money?
R:  How do you -- how do you say there's a deficit and suddenly you have two billion dollars for a war and I don't know the exact number, I'm just throwing a number out there.
L:  Probably more.
R:  How do you -- how do you do that?
L:  I don't know.  I just wonder, you know, what hap-
