R:  Hello, I'm Hope.
L:  Hello, this is Bob.
R:  Hi, Bob.  How are you?
L:  Okay, Hope.
R:  Well, do you have lots of close friends or just a few friends?
L:  Well, there's my wife, me ... and, uh ... a friend -- an old friend of ours that we see once in a while.  We're both retired.
R:  Well, I know how hard -- yeah, I know how that is.
L:  Yeah, you got a lot of friends?
R:  Not really.  I just have a few girlfriends, that's about it.  I'm thirty six years old and my best friend is nineteen.  She's really young for me to have for a best friend, but we get along really well.
L:  Ah!
R:  Yeah, we both have children so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that kinda is a plus so we started working together and ... just hit it off and been friends ever since.
L:  I'll be darned.
R:  Is that you and your friend up from -- be all retired and just go out and do stuff together?
L:  We're pretty -- we do things together pretty much.  She's got some friends that she knows.  She helps them feed while -- to find their birth ...
R:  Oh.
L:  -- children, and their birth ... their birth children.
R:  Oh, that is wonderful.
L:  And they've been friends ever since.
R:  Well, that's really -- that'd be a great job to have.
L:  Well, she, uh, just does it as a hobby.
R:  Ooh.
L:  She's in charge of a ...
R:  Yeah.  How many children --
L:  She's pretty good at it.
R:  -- do you have?
L:  What?
R:  Just one?  Do you have a boy or a girl?
L:  We don't have any children.
R:  Ooh.  I have two.  I have a little boy and a little girl and my best friend has a little girl that is in love with my little boy.
L:  Oh, is that right? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, she loves him [inaudible].
L:  Have you ever seen that movie, um ... um ... what was it?  With Drew Barrymore?  Riding In Cars With Boys?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have you seen that?
R:  Yeah, it's really cute.
L:  Yeah, I was just thinking of that when you said your ... son -- how old is he?
R:  He's five and Taylor, she's only two years old.  She just thinks the world of him.
L:  I was just thinking of that movie.
R:  And my kids are small.  I have young children.  I have a nine year old and a five year old.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And my -- and my husband used to be my best friend, uh ... [LAUGH] but we got married.
L:  Is that right?
R:  Yes.  I've known him since I was thirteen years old.
L:  Gee whiz.
R:  And he was eighteen.
L:  Well, you started young then to ...
R:  Well, um, he ma- -- we really didn't get married then.  We got married when I was thirty five.  He was in the Air Force ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and he went and done his little thing overseas and had two children there.  He has two Japanese children that still live in Japan.  And when he came back and he was -- we were still good friends, we thought there was twenty some odd years and we just ... felt like it was time for us to quit being friends.
L:  Is that right?  Well, that's some story.
R:  Do you and your friends like to go out and do camping stuff, or what do y'all like to do?
L:  Well, we like ... to go to the casino.
R:  Ooh!
L:  And we like to go to restaurants.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we like to go outta here and go to a hotel ... a couple of times a month and just spend some time.
R:  Yeah, it's nice to.  We got [inaudible].
L:  We have friends at a certain hotel we go to.
R:  Oh, that's wonderful.
L:  We have ... well, there's a couple of hotels we go to where they know us and we're friendly with them. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, we're close to the Harrahs[?] here.
L:  Oh, you're in Los Angeles?
R:  Uh, we're in North Carolina.
L:  Oh, North Carolina?
R:  Uh-huh and the one at Cherokee.
L:  Oh, Harrahs at Turkey?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ooh.  You go?
R:  Oh, once and a while.  His mom and dad like to go a lot.
L:  Yeah, her mom and dad like to go too but ... her father's just crippling up now with ...
R:  Oh.
L:  -- pulmonary disease and ...
R:  Oh, that's really bad.
L:  He can't do much of it anymore.  He just --
R:  Well, I'm sure you y'all try to get and see him as much as you can.  It's hard to when they're so ill.
L:  Not really.  He's in a terrible temper too.
R:  Ooh, goodness.
L:  He doesn't get enough oxygen to his brain ... and he flies off the handle at the slightest thing.
R:  That sounds like my dad. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, is that right?
R:  He has a, um, brain syndrome.  He has some kind of organic brain syndrome that he just has dementia all the time and ... we don't get to see him that much either 'cause it's just -- he doesn't remember who we are, you know?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's really hard to go and see him when they're like that. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I have quite a few email friends that I've kept over the past couple of years that I email but ... I stay -- I'm kinda like you.  I stay with my -- my one or two little friends and that's about all I do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's -- I don't know how these people keep up with all these friends that have lots and lots of friends.  I wouldn't be able to do it.  [LAUGH]
L:  I just wonder how mu- -- how friendly they are with them.  Now, her parents live about two blocks from us ... and they claim they have all these friends ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at church and ... just mainly at church and what they've, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] over the years.  Yet they're completely dependent on my -- my wife and I ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- take 'em to hospitals and doctors and everything else.
R:  That's a big job to have to do.
L:  And they're -- they're sickly too.  And now -- and they claim all the time, "Well, you don't have to do this because we have our friends do it".
R:  Mhm.
L:  I ju- -- we've said, "Well ..." every time we say, "Well, have your friends take you".
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they -- she ends up taking them anyway.
R:  Well, that's good.  At least they have friends that can do it.
L:  That way it lets her do it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How friendly is that?
R:  And nobody has the time or can make time to do it so y'all end up doing it anyway.
L:  Well, they're all retired too.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, his parents just retired and they are -- his mom has lots of friends.  They just went on a ... big cruise and stuff and went out to the Caribbean and all and they -- she went with girlfriends and I just don't have that many friends that I could just say, "Well, hey, let's all get together and go do something" you know?  I just don't ... 
L:  I saw a movie, um, yesterday ... about ... Mexican -- about five Mexican women ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  They were all single women who were friends over many years and I consider that friends.  They get together all the time --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- share all their thoughts, all their loves, all their everything.  [LIPSMACK] They would share everything with the five of them, or share among themselves, and they would all do anything for any of 'em.
R:  Yep, that -- that's the way friends are supposed to be.
L:  That's friendship.
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  But, uh, you don't find that very often.
R:  No, you don't.  You don't just find somebody that you can click with and -- and be around a lot.  Me and -- me and my girlfriend, April, we talk every day, at least a few times a day.  My husband always says that we spend more time with each other than he spends with -- uh, the husbands spend with us.  But they're always working so what else do we have to do? [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  We're al- -- we're always doing something together.
L:  Right.
R:  But it's -- it's good to have a friend or two around when you need somebody.
L:  Is your husband in the service too?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  His nineteen year old girl?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, he's in the service too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  But is it -- I just don't make friends that -- that good.  I'm just not one of those kinda people that are very outgoing and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have a few friends at work ... [MN] people I keep up with here now and again, but ... and he has a lot of friends, of course, being in the military.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, so he has way more than I do.  We keep up with one couple that moved over here from Japan and he has a Japanese wife and they live up in Pennsylvania and we go up once a year to see them or they come down here once a year to see us and it's good to get together.  They have children.  We go camping and have a good time.  We really do.
L:  Yeah.  I'll be darned.
R:  Because he loves to camp.  He loves to camp and I'm not much of a camper but he likes to go so I go along.
L:  Oh, I can't stand camping.
R:  Well, I --
L:  Living on the cold ground -- the hard ground.
R:  That's what I told him.  I said, "God gave us the brains enough to stay in the house and build houses to stay in.  Why in the world do we need to go stay outside?"
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It won't do.  I don't like to go out either but the kids enjoy it and he enjoys it so I go to make everybody else happy.
L:  Right.
R:  Kinda like most women do.  Something to pacify the husbands.
L:  That's right.
R:  But it's -- it's nice to --
