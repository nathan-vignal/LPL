R:  Hi, hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, thi- -- my name is Barb[?], I live in Columbus, Ohio, and this is the first time I've done this.  Have you done this before?
L:  No, this is my first time.
R:  Oh [LAUGH] okay, well this should be interesting.  What's your name?
L:  My name is Pearl.  I live in Hawaii.
R:  Oh, hi, Pearl.  Oh boy, it must be nice.  Um, I guess we're supposed to talk about friends [LAUGH].  Is that the -- the subject?  Um, do you want to start or -- what -- [LAUGH]
L:  Um, yeah, I guess.  Well, I wasn't too clear on --
R:  Okay [SIGH].
L:  -- the exact topic.
R:  Well --
L:  Something about best friends or something?
R:  Well, they said it was friends and I guess the thing was, are you -- are you the person -- type of person that has a lot of friends or do you just have a couple of really close friends that you spend a lot of time with so --  I don't really know.  I guess I -- I could start, I guess.  Like I said, this is my first time too so I don't know if we're doing this right or not but I guess I'm really just the type of person that has -- I've got like one or two really close friends that I talk to every day, that I do things with every day, and I'm not a real social person.  I don't like big parties and big groups and stuff like that.  Is that kinda like where you're at or --
L:  Um, sort of.  I have, um, a couple of good friends.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I wouldn't call them particularly close.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, since -- I used to work, I got laid off in, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- nineteen ninety four --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and since then, um, I've been, sort of, um, avoiding people --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and, um, even my friends, I don't talk to them every day --
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  -- or see them every day.  I don't go out that much, um --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I have a computer and, um, I rely on email a lot.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.  Well, you know, it -- it's funny you should say that, too, because I -- I've -- you know, I do work, I'm a single mother with -- uh, my son is in college but he lives in -- he goes to college in Florida.  Um, my ex husband -- I've been divorced for more years than I care to remember and did have a boyfriend but he died in January of a heart attack so a lot of my -- I go to this internet forum and there are a lot of women there and I guess I really kinda consider them friends.  I don't ever se- -- I've never seen 'em, I've never really met them but it's the kind of place where if you -- something's happened and you need to talk about it you can go there and, you know, whine and carry on about things, and I guess they're probably closer friends to me than, you know, people that I see every day.  Honestly, I guess to be honest is that, um -- it seems like most every clo- -- I haven't really had a really, really close friend that I absolutely trust since I've been in high school, and I've been out of high school, you know, for twenty five years.  It just seems like now, when you -- you think somebody is a friend but then you find out, through one thing or another, that they're really not so that's kinda where I'm at right now.  It's a, you know, a keep your distance type of thing.  I don't know, it's weird but it's hard to -- friend is not a really good topic [LAUGH] anyway.
L:  Yeah, I know what you mean.
R:  So -- [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, um, I used to belong to, um, I guess you call it a -- a newsgroup --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or a news lift group, um.  This was right -- it must have been --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- someti- -- in the late eighties.  I'm not sure if I had my old computer or an old desktop computer that a friend gave me and, um, I was trying to find work, um, through the internet.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Trying to find a, um, um, telecommute job --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I joined this group, um, of other women who were trying to start businesses or trying to look for work at home or trying just use the internet to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- find some way to look -- to -- to make money and, um, I would get their digest every day and read through all the -- the messages and stuff and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that was really fun and that was sort of like my main network, you know, just to --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to keep from going crazy.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, um, I sort of did consider those people my friends although we never actually talked to each other, we just sent emails --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- back and forth but then after a while it got a little crazy, got really intense, um, they started the Flame Wars and, you know --
R:  Oh, see that's -- that's really --
L:  Yeah, arguments and cliques and stuff and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I got away from that --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and got into another group, um, and they were using, um, email.  I -- do you know about the Yahoo!, um -- Yahoo! groups?
R:  Yeah, I've seen those.
L:  Before Yahoo! took it over I guess it was just, um -- I forget who was running it but, uh, it's like a -- a group and you can communicate, um, through individual email --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or through, um, the webpage where all the -- the messages are posted on the webpage.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, there is various different groups that -- mostly what we were concerned with -- this is men and women -- what -- mostly what we were concerned with is making money and making money fast.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So, a lot of it was like Ponzi sch- -- schemes.
R:  Hm.
L:  And, um, then people started dis- -- discovering this thing called E. Gold and people -- some people were like doing Ponzis and other were trying to do, um, things like, um, Amways sort of stuff --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, M. -- L.M., and then they just started doing gambling and -- 
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  -- through E. Gold you could, like, set up a game where you just put money in and hopefully you would get, like, twice the money you put in back in a day or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- maybe an hour or whatever and that was fun for a while and then, through this network of people that were doing this E. Gold thing, um, uh, a group got together and formed a company and said they had found the way, a legitimate way to make a lot of money --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in a short period of time so a lot of us started joining that and for a month we -- we were making money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And a lot of sceptical people said, "Oh, it's just a Ponzi" and a lot of other people said, "We're really making money and we really" -- we felt like we knew the people that were running --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the -- the -- the, um, the company but after a while they stopped making money --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and it turned out to be just a big scam.
R:  A scam?  Yeah --
L:  But during that time we were, um, communicating through chatrooms --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- actually talking to each other, although we couldn't see each -- each other.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Plus email and that was really fun.
R:  Mm, look don't you -- I mean, I kinda think like now and in the situation I'm in I guess really the internet friends, if you want to call them friends, and, you know, like these forums and stuff that I go to, um, they post pictures of themselves and their kids and things and I consider 'em friends but it's kinda like it's safe because -- I guess the reason that I don't really have any really close friends is I'm kind of selfish of my time and to be a friend you really have to, like, be there when they need you and that's not always something that I want to do.  I mean, I've been alone for a long time and I've kind of lost the ability to be considerate of other people's wants, needs and desires, you know.  I mean, I've -- I've got my own problems and, you know, even though I am lucky enough to have a job, you know, things are hard for me and I do -- I spend a lot of time on the computer, I do a lot of, um, like these internet surveys for money and reward programs and things like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that I have found out, you know, and it just -- it seems like by the time I get home from work and, you know, go through emails and do all the stuff I wanna do, it's just like time to get up, you know, and start another day and I just don't really seem to have time for social events and it's hard, too, when you're struggling and you don't really have the money that other people have.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, you know, everybody's like, "Well, let's do this and let's do that" and you get tired of making excuses for not doing it when really the real reason is you really can't afford to do it and I don't know, I just -- I just feel safer with the internet stuff but I -- I'm always suspicious, too, of those things I see on the internet that, you know, I think, "Oh, that can't be true" or, "It can't really work like that or everybody would be doing it if there was really that much money to be made" but, I don't know.  How did you find out about this?
L:  Um, through my little network of, um, the E. Gold people and, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people trying to make money through this and that, um -- there's this lady that, um, has been running, um, um, a newsgroup for a long time.  She has -- she has a really large list --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she sent out -- she sent out an email telling us about the --
R:  This --
L:  -- this new program where we can make thirty dollars.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, well I --
L:  How did you hear about it?
R:  Well, I go to -- I don't really know, I guess I can tell you, they don't have any restrictions on this.  I go to a forum called the Big Big Savings Forum and if you want to check it out it's just W.W.W. big big forums dot com and they have a --
