L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, this is Reg.
L:  Hello, this is Angel.
R:  Angel?  [PAUSE] 
L:  Yes.
R:  Angel? 
L:  Yes.
R:  Yes.  Ah, what do you think of, ah, what the government can do about corporate scandal? 
L:  Mm, that's a tough one.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I really don't know if there is too much that they can do to curb it or --
R:  Well, one example that showed their ineffectiveness is [PAUSE] [several inaudible words] big accounting firms that audit these big companies.
L:  Yes.
R:  Well, they have, ah, an audit p- part of their company and they have a corporate consultant part of their company, and they're in the same company and they advise companies on how to run their company, and then they audit their books at the end of the year -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in the same company.  And there's a lot of people and it's proven out that, ah, -- they have -- when they advise the company they want their audit to show success for their advice, and they got -- and there's people that are trying to break that up and say, "If you're going to be in the corporate consulting, you shouldn't be in the auditing at the same time.  They should be two separate entities".  But the government in effect can't br- --  pass any laws or do anything to break them up.  So, what you have is [PAUSE] companies running the audit and are jiggling the books to make things look good because of the advice they receive from audit firms.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They can't --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- do anything about it.  The government won't do anything about it.
L:  Ah.  [PAUSE] I guess it's something I've never really thought about, not much on corporate business.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, no.  I know there's ways that they can do it and check stuff out.  But, -- [PAUSE]
R:  They catch the little guy with his hand in the till, but they don't catch the big guys too often, and when they do --
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  -- they let them off the hook.
L:  Yeah.  Like Martha S- -- is that kind of what Martha Stewart -- 
R:  Yeah, Martha --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Stewart's an example.
L:  Yeah.
R:  She's still free.  She's not in jail or anything.
L:  No, and [MN] that's just it.  They won't do nothing to her -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- or anybody.  You know, anyone that they catch, they give them a little fine that is, you know, -- it's not even comparable with the money and stuff -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's been taken and -- 
R:  Right.  [PAUSE]
L:  Don't -- [PAUSE] and they need some kind of better system of checks and balances, I reckon.
R:  Right.  [PAUSE] What field are you in, Angel?
L:  Um, [MN] I -- I don't work at all.  [LAUGH] I --
R:  Oh, don't you? 
L:  -- I went to college to study, um, ah, -- well, I graduated college [MN] cosmetology school, but I ended up getting married and having kids and [MN] my little boy's five years old, so I said when he started kindergarten, which will be next year, I was going to go back to work, but -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I just [MN] -- you can't trust people.
R:  My wife is a cosmetologist.
L:  Is she? 
R:  But, ah, she gave it up years ago.  She's into other things now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's a hard job.
L:  [MN]
R:  It's hard on your hands.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I have arthritis t- -- um, arthritic arthritis, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] I'd like to study a little bit more about business, but [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I live in West Virginia and there's just not a whole lot of stuff around where I live.
R:  Yeah.  [PAUSE]
L:  But, [MN] corporate stuff really ain't my --
R:  Bag, huh.
L:  -- I -- I guess you'd say cup of tea.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Right.
L:  Um, -- [PAUSE]
R:  Well, you do know the economy's down.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And a lot of it's due to corporate scandals.
L:  Yeah.  I know a lot of people are afraid to invest their money and stuff because of like what happened with Enron and all that stuff.
R:  DW- -- CDW.
L:  Excuse me? 
R:  C -- I think it's called CDW was into accounting fraud, too.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  A -- a telephone company.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I remember reading something on here, something about that stuff.  I don't know.
R:  And people lost their confidence in the stock market.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they've lost their confidence in a lot of things.
L:  I know my husband has lost a lot on his 401K just -- just in the past year, really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We've, um, changed everything around so we ain't losing so much.  It's -- it's not gaining anything, but at least it's not losing either.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess the safest way to go is the big companies.
L:  Yeah.
R:  IBM.  [PAUSE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [several inaudible words] Some of the big companies are way down.  Ford's way down.  General Motors is way down.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Walmart isn't, but they're down.
L:  No, [MN] and Walmart's one of the companies I kind of wonder about, um, the fraud and stuff.  I know where -- where we live there was just recently a big ice storm, I mean huge ice storm, and the stores and stuff was closed for like a week.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, Walmart was open selling, um, lanterns and all this stuff.  They got truckloads in, but yet they still said they lost lots of money on the storm, but people was out buying lanterns and candles and batteries and stuff like craz- --
R:  From Walmart? 
L:  Yeah, from Walmart.  I mean, they got in truckloads and stuff, and it all went.  People was like -- they was hoarding it because we didn't know when we was going to get our electric back on.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, it was a big mess. 
R:  Where are you at?
L:  It was a big mess, and we had went -- we had to buy a generator and everything, but yet when we watched the news Walmart said they lost all this money because of this storm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And me and my husband both was like, "There ain't no way".
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not Walmart.
R:  Where -- [several inaudible words] Minnesota? 
L:  No, we live [MN] West Virginia.
R:  Oh, West Virginia.
L:  Yes.  There was -- I mean a bad ice storm come through here in --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- February.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  We didn't have electric, telephone -- 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- nothing.
R:  Gee.
L:  And, um, I don't know, to me it just seemed weird that they said they lost all that money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I don't know if there's someone who can -- who checks in on that stuff and [MN] say, "There ain't no way".
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or if there's way they do their book -- you know, you don't want point fingers at people and everything, but -- 
R:  Maybe they gained money there and lost it somewhere else.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] You know --
R:  But they say they lost money, and everybody says, "Well, they didn't make any money on it then".
L:  Well, I know there was -- where we live there's like four Walmarts within [MN] half hour of us you go each direction.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the Walmart one way --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they had to throw all their, um, frozen stuff and their refrigerated stuff out.  They had to throw all that out because they didn't have electric, and then the other Walmarts, they got their electric back like in a day, so their stuff was all right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I mean, they may have lost the money, if they had that happen at very many stores.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But most of the towns had their electric back on within a day or two.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we live out in the country and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and everything s- -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  [MN] I guess maybe, you know, not thinking of that, they may have had some stores, but [inaudible] --
R:  It's hard to believe that Walmart would be in this scandal.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  That's sort of like the all American store.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just --
R:  American flag and all the rest.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yet they might be.
L:  Yeah.  I guess anybody -- you know, it's just --
R:  It depends on --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- how they -- they did the accounting on it, I guess.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you can always get one sour apple that's embezzling money, you know, anywhere.
R:  Right.
L:  The -- even the smallest of little stores and stuff.
R:  Right.  [PAUSE] Yeah, these big companies, you don't know what to make of what they say.
L:  Yeah.  Well, too, and if the government like we said, you know, would start giving them a little bit stiffer penalty, I mean, if you fine them twenty five thousand dollars and they've frauded you, you know, out of millions, that twenty five thousand ain't nothing.
R:  Mhm.  [PAUSE]
L:  I don't know.  I guess if I lived in a bigger city, it -- the stuff probably would affect a little bit more, but -- 
R:  [several inaudible words] Affect small towns just as much as it does big cities.
L:  Yeah.  [PAUSE] I don't know.  Where we live out there's been a lot of -- you know, since the Enron stuff and all these companies, [MN] there's been a lot of stores going out of business around where I live.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  About the only thing left is Walmart and Krogers.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [PAUSE]
