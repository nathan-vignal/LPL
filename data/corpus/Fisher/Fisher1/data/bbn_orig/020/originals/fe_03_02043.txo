R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  [LAUGH] Um, my name's Alexis.
L:  I'm Diana.
R:  And I'm in Pennsylvania. 
L:  I'm in Ohio.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, you're close by then.
L:  Y- yes, I am.
R:  Yeah.  What part of Ohio? 
L:  Um, in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in Canton.
R:  Okay, okay.  I'm in Pit- -- ah, outside of Pittsburgh, so we're not -- 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Sort of neighbors.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  Um, the topic, inside or outside activities.
L:  Right.
R:  I think it depends on the time of the year --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I used to enjoy outdoor activities in the winter a lot.  I mean, I skied and -- and I was a ski instructor for a while and [MN] really enjoyed that.  But now that I'm getting older, winter, indoor activities; summer --
L:  Right.
R:  -- outdoor activities.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  See, I've never skied before.  I don't -- I've never really gotten into [MN] -- in, ah, the winter sports, I've never gotten into those, skiing or any of that stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Mine -- I'm a summer person.  Like, I play softball and tennis, um, like the ones you play out in the yard, like volleyball and badminton.
R:  Right. 
L:  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I play all those.  But, no, I don't -- I don't play no winter ones.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I used to.  Like I said, [MN] I used to be a big winters fan and -- and, I mean, we've gone to Utah to ski and, ah, New York and, ah, Colorado and Montana.
L:  Wow.
R:  But, ah, the p- -- once you get older I think [inaudible] it's a little too cold to be doing this.  I'm lucky --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I go out and shovel the snow in the winter.
L:  Right.
R:  So, but in the -- and then I do a lot of indoor activities.  Um, [MN] -- in the summer I'm a big gardener.  We -- we have a big garden and I own a horse, so I do some horseback riding -- 
L:  Gees. 
R:  -- in the summer.  Um, she lives at our house, so that's kind of nice.
L:  Wow.
R:  Um, otherwise I couldn't keep her because, one, it's too expensive and, two, you'd never see her.
L:  Right.
R:  So, that's kind of nice.  But I like to be outside during the summer and do things like that.  And, ah, -- but in the winter I do more like crafts and sewing and -- 
L:  Right.  See, that's what I do and that.  I'm a -- I r- -- I do reading, I do like woodwork.
R:  Oh -- 
L:  Just stuff like --
R:  --okay.
L:  -- that.  So, that's what I do in the -- in the winter.  [LAUGH]
R:  Ahah.  What type of woodwork?
L:  Oh, I just -- it just -- it varies.  I just do, you know, -- like, I do plaques with my name and stuff on them.  I do, like, little boxes, um, --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- sort of like jewellery and stuff like that.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
L:  I do a bunch of different stuff.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I just took a pottery class, um, like, with a potter's wheel and everything.  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Right.
R:  [LAUGH] And I did that just for the fun of it, and it -- and it really was a lot of fun.  I had always wanted to do that and, um, a local garden centre or art centre offered a six week course for sixty five dollars, and I said, "Oh, I'll try this".  So now I have six c- -- um, I call them ashtrays, all the same size.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, gees.
R:  [LAUGH] Because they taught you all the different ways to do it.
L:  Right.
R:  But everything we made on the wheel came out looking exactly alike.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, gees.
R:  So, but -- 
L:  You're not going to continue with it or -- 
R:  Um, I'd like to.  It's inconvenient.  The location isn't really close to home.  It's, like, oh, I'd say an hour away.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, by the -- and you're -- they're only open -- it's run by volunteers, so they're only open ten to one, you know, during the week and so it's not -- and I wasn't working, so it was like, "Oh, this is okay.  I can --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- do this once a week."
L:  [LAUGH] Keep yourself busy.
R:  Yeah.  So if I had a kiln at home and a p- -- and a potter's wheel, I probably would continue to -- just to play around with it.  I'd like to make some garden signs and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, put things -- signs up in the yard with things that I've bought so I know what they are.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  I never got into stuff like that.  I'm into, like, the candles.  I want to get into, um, candle making, and that's one thing I want to get started by this winter so I have something to do for the winter.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because I don't work and I've always wanted to get into learning how to make candles.
R:  Yeah, I have a friend who just started that.  Um, she -- I don't know, she ordered stuff off the Internet and she's making all kinds of candles and -- actually, there's some big farmers market or flea market something in Ohio and she -- she's from Ohio, and so she was going to take them back there, I think Millersburg, Ohio.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm not -- that's not too far away.
R:  Yeah, and -- and go and do -- you know, and sell them at this craft fair there.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but I haven't talked to her for a while, so I don't know how it's worked out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, but, ah, yeah, because we -- we like to go up to that area.  We go to Berlin a lot.
L:  Oh, yeah, that's not too far from here.
R:  No, no.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I like to go to Berlin and -- and look at all the -- the quilt stores and --
L:  Right.  See, I used to do that, like, once a month, but I don't have a car now so it's kind of hard to.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I used to --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I used to drive down to Amish country and spend, you know, like a week in there and stuff.
R:  Yeah, that's what we -- we like to do that a couple times during the summer and go, because there's that big craft place there that's [inaudible] and, ah, you know, there's all the cheese places -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and -- and the bread, the flour places and the buying the bulk food.  So we w- -- we'll take a weekend.  Probably we'll go up there, like, the first --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- week in June.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, -- and buy some flour and my husband loves the Swiss cheese.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And -- [LAUGH] he -- he buys like fifty pounds of Swiss cheese.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like -- it's a good thing it keeps.  [LAUGH]
L:  He's got enough then.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, we like to do that, like, you know, couple times in the summer and -- so it's nice to do summer -- you know, outdoor activities in the summer.  I'm finding I enjoy that a lot more than --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, like, when we used to do.  I mean, we even snow shoot for a while.  Like, we [MN] [inaudible] -- and we did cross country skiing, not well --
L:  My God.
R:  -- [LAUGH] but -- but we still have all the cross country equipment and we bought [MN] -- and [MN] I think I skied from the time I was little and then, um, -- in fact, that's where I met my husband, was skiing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And so we -- we liked that, um, years ago, but my son's --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- now into snow boarding, but we're not.
L:  See, and I'm young and I've never even tried no winter sports like that.
R:  No.
L:  No.
R:  No.
L:  Never -- never have been interested in it.
R:  Oh.
L:  I'm -- I -- I've tr- -- I've done, like, ice skating and stuff like that, but I've never wanted to get up on a big hill and slide down it on, you know, -- [LAUGH]
R:  I loved it.
L:  -- on skis.  I just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I absolutely loved it.  But [MN] I had a really bad accident when we went to Utah, those are actual real mountains, and I hurt my knee and my husband had arthroscopic surgery and we thought, "All right".  So, now the kids go, but when we -- we just listen to what [MN] -- what they do.  And my son is into snow boarding and that -- that sport scares me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because you're strapped, ah, both feet to one board.
L:  Right.
R:  Like, all right, he could really do some serious damage with it, but -- 
L:  Well, see, that's just the same as, um, the surfboard -- I mean not the surfboard.  What is that called when -- when you're doing that in the water on the board?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's true, like the -- like the water skiing, but -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [MN] yeah, there's a -- yeah, that's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so you could do something -- you know, really get hurt there.  But I can't swim.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well, that'd be no good then. 
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, that's not something I ever learned to do.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I'm like, okay, so I have to stay out of the water in the summer unless it's knee deep.  But we like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to go to the ocean.
L:  Yeah, see, [MN] that's what -- I mean, I -- I really -- well, I go fishing and stuff and swimming but, you know, I don't do none of that water skiing or -- 
R:  No.
L:  -- anything like that either. 
R:  No.  No --
L:  There's [MN] too much of a risk.
R:  Yeah.  No, I've never done anything like that.  But we like to go -- like [MN] we like to go to the ocean and -- and my big thing is just to lay on the beach and read.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  [MN] While everybody else goes out in the water.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  And I love to go and spend, like, a week in the outer banks.  Have you ever been there?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, it's -- it's really -- it's nice.  There's not, like, -- there -- you can go a half mile without seeing anybody.
L:  Gees.
R:  I know.  It's really -- the first year we went down there my kids were little and I called and I said to the woman what -- we rented a house and I said, "Well, what is there to do in the area" and she said, "Oh, well, you can rent movies".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I thought, "Okay, I can --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- rent movies at home".  And, so, ah, -- [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And -- and I joked because they said every house came with a fish cleaning table, and I thought, "Oh, joy, this -- this is going to be a fun vacation".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But it was nice because there wasn't much traffic, um, there's an island there that has horses, just [MN] -- all the wild horses off of one of the Spanish galleons is there.
L:  Right.
R:  So, you know, you -- we went down and -- and toured that and my dad lived in Florida, so that was, like, halfway between Pennsylvania and Florida.  So he could drive up --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and meet us and spend the week with us there.
L:  [MN] See, I've never -- I've never been to a beach or anything.  I don't really vacation much.  I [MN] -- I've been to Vegas and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and -- and Canada a couple times and Niagara Falls and stuff, but that's -- that's about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, no, I've never been to -- to Niagara Fall- -- or to Las Vegas.  That's something we've always wanted to do and just haven't gotten around to it yet, so -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I love Niagara Falls, but I haven't been up there in a couple years either.
L:  Oh, yes.  [MN] It's been a while for me too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  We u- -- we like to do mostly car trips on the weekends now, because -- well, I'm not working right now.  I was, but I quit last year.  So, um, it's nice that I can be home, get my stuff done and then have the weekends for the two of us to do things.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, so I'm not rushed trying to hold down a full time job.  Well, I'm working part time and I'm doing crazy things like these [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- these calls.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My daughter signed me up for these, and then she called me today and she's like, "Oh, the topic of the day is activities, indoor and outdoor activities" and I said, "Well, I'll -- I'll give that a -- a shot and see".
L:  Oh, that was kind of perfect for you then.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true, and then like -- and I'd just gotten home from the garden centre, so we --
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- we went out and bought a couple more plants for our one spot in our yard and I dug that up.
L:  Oh, so you get to start on doing the gardening.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I don't -- I never gotten into that.  I -- I don't have like --
