L:  Hello, I'm Margaret.
R:  Hi, Margaret, my name is Carla.
L:  Well, um, what about friends?  Tell me, do you have a lot of friends or do you have a few close friends?
R:  Um, I do have more, um -- I have a few close friends, I have a lot of acquaintances.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I'm generally pretty friendly and I, you know, I get along with a lot of people but in terms of having friends I only really have a real, close few, um, that I would consider friends.
L:  That -- that's true of me, too.  I was -- as you were talking I was kind of wondering if that's typical of most women whereas men, like my husband, he seems to have a good many buddies at work but they don't do things too much after work.  So, I don't know, I have -- I have a few close friends and then I have some excellent women peers that I don't really do things with.
R:  I -- I'd say that's pretty much true, too.  Um, I don't know, I think -- I think it really comes down to, um, encountering somebody that, um -- I don't know, there's got to be something initially there, I think, that -- that really connects people, um --
L:  Yes, I agree.
R: -- in terms of any type of relationship.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  Um, but there's usually that one or two people that you encounter in your life that are just -- I don't know, you seem to get along really quick, you know, in a non-romantic way, you know, but there's a real connection there, um --
L:  I -- I've kind of found the same thing to be true.  I have usually one or two that I'm really, kind of, in tune with who are -- who -- not necessarily in the same ways either but that I have a specific relationship with relative to whatever it is that we share.  And then -- I'm a teacher and a lot of the, um, people that I work with are -- are my friends in terms of talking through different issues with the classroom or so forth, the curriculum, but sometimes we talk about our family situations but sometimes we don't.
R:  Sure.  Um, where I work, um, -- what I do is I work in retail and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a lot of my co workers that I encounter, um  -- you can't really on the job get into too terribly much about yourself but somebody might bring up an issue that, you know, is still similar to what you're going through and, you know, you get a conversation started off that but, um, in terms of work, I'd only have like one real close -- close friend, um, that I've developed a good friendship with and I think that's because we have so much in common in terms of our family or life experience and --
L:  Yeah, I have some people that I work with who have a child or children the same age as my child and then I have others who are taking care of elderly parents and, you know, I have an elderly mother so sometimes we discuss those things and -- but I guess as I've gotten older and since I have a family also here that I live with, I don't tend to do things much with my friends.  I talk to them and especially, uh, -- well, in meetings, before and after meetings or --
R:  True.
L:  Some of them -- we really email quite a bit.  We don't use the phone too much but we do a lot of emailing.  Do you use that?
R:  Um, I used to do it a lot more often, um, but with -- with working so much --
L:  Ah, yes.
R:  -- and having such a busy schedule and plus I live, um -- I'm quite far away from a lot of the -- the people that I used to know quite well and far away from my family --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- so, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't --
L:  I don't --
R:  I don't have access much to a computer anymore 'cause of being so busy.
L:  Ah, oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, my situation's entirely different that way in that I'm an adjunct teacher so I teach a few hours but most of the time I'm at home with my computer, grading papers, making lesson plans, typing into it, and so it's very easy to -- and I live in a rather high tech area in my city so I have high speed DSL kind of st- -- it's cable but it's very speedy so I ki- -- my friends and I just kind of communicate back and forth several times a day about little thises and thats.  It's a whole different way of being in touch, I guess.
R:  Yes, I really -- I really enjoy that, though, you know, keeping in touch with people, um, over email.  I -- I -- I still find that -- I'm a little bit technology nervous, I guess, still --
L:  Sure, sure, yeah.
R:  -- because I don't use it so much but --
L:  Sure, that makes a lo- --
R:  -- it really does help.
L:  Makes a lot of difference.  I used to be a computer programmer so it's okay for me and my husband's an engineer and so we've always had good computers so that, you know, it's not -- it's not frightening because I don't have to maintain it, I don't have to install it, I don't have to repair it, I just have to use it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, it's a lot easier.  It's just -- it's available to me, I guess is what it -- how to express it.  But I've noticed an interesting phenomenon in terms of my daughter who is in ninth grade now.  She and her buddies will, um, talk to each other all day but then they'll race home and they'll get on and do this thing called the instant messenger where they're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- several of them are in a dialogue all the time.  All they're doing is going back over what happened at [LAUGH] school but they like to chat at home as well.  Sort of a running dialogue.  She gets almost no phone calls, as is true for the rest of us, but we're always, uh, you know, talking, talking, talking by typing so ... [MN]
R:  Well, I think the interesting thing about -- in terms of email and instant messenger is also that it gives you, um, time to -- to mull over, you know, what you really want to say and how you want to express it --
L:  Well, that's a -- yeah.
R:  -- as opposed to on the phone.
L:  That's an ex- -- yeah, you're right, that's -- yeah, you get to edit yourself, you get to have your emotions react and then formulate a response.  Ah, I like -- yeah -- I don't know what the sociologists are going to determine in terms of what -- that electronics is doing to our friendships --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but it's not diminishing I mea- -- but it is definitely different.
R:  Yes, I think it just -- it just adds an extra -- an extra dimension, I think, like -- just like what I said before, you know, it gives you a chance to really -- you know, how many times do we want to take back something --
L:  [LAUGH] Ah, yeah, yeah.
R:  -- that we've said or say it in a different way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, when you're typing it out, it's like, "Oh, I could use a better word" or, "I could say it this way instead".  I think that helps people to actually communicate better --
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  -- with each other.  And then also, you know how hard it is when you first meet somebody face to face or even on the phone and how difficult that can be to establish a rapport, whereas this, like, it's kind of a rapport built in --
L:  Th- --
R:  You know, it's just --
L:  That's an interesting observation, also.  I do have some people who just put me on these, uh, lists that -- you know, they send -- when they get some funny little piece of humor or something, they send it to a whole list of people and sometimes that is just a little bit annoying but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I just read 'em and delete 'em or don't read 'em and delete 'em and just let it go because they're at least still, sort of, staying in touch and sometimes they send me something that's personal instead.
R:  Sure.
L:  So, I don't feel too avalanched by it but I do feel really cut off from people on the days that something's wrong with my cable service.  I feel --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  It's a whole new thing, it's almost -- it's pretty much like being without a phone because I know that the people don't know that I'm not there.
R:  Sure.
L:  So, they're sending me stuff and I'm not getting any -- I'm not able to answer them and they think I'm not responding or some such thing and it even would be so far as that I might not know about an upcoming meeting, if it goes on for two or three days --
R:  Ha.
L:  -- because I use my home email address as my, you know, primary point of contact because I'm only at the college where I teach for like three days a week so --
R:  Ah.
L:  Uh, anyway that's -- that's just another reason why it's such a link and we, uh --
R:  Because -- because it is such a part of your -- your life, especially socially, you know, it just feels like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, 'cause that's such a huge -- a huge connection for you, yeah.
L:  It really is.  I -- I don't know, um, it -- it works for me because I do get to at least to see these people three days a week, or many of them, and so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's not like surrogate friend but it is sort of like an -- I guess, an extension but I would never have time to just sit down and talk to anybo- -- you know, this -- this many people by phone because with email you don't have to go into everything like, "How's your mother?" or, "How's the we-?" -- you know, all the stuff.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You can just say exactly what's on your mind at that point and --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- [LAUGH] sign off, so --
R:  And also, too, you know it's --
