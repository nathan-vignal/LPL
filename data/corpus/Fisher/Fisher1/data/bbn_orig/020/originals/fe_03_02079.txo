R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Kelly.
R:  I'm Maria.  How're you doing?
L:  I'm fine.  You're who?
R:  Maria.
L:  Maria?  Where are you calling from?
R:  Florida.
L:  Florida?  I'm in Arkansas.
R:  Oh, wow.  Cool.
L:  So, you're from Florida, you have lots of outdoor activities probably.
R:  [LAUGH] Definitely.  Well ... uh, when in the summertime when it gets really hot and I'd rather stay inside in the air conditioner of course --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- but, uh ... or at the beach or pool.  That's -- that's pretty cool, you know.  But, uh, when the time is more like, uh, spring to a lot of the, uh, northern states so --
L:  Right.  That's where you get all the snowbirds coming down there for the ... winter.
R:  [LAUGH] Definitely.
L:  We're not too bad.  I'm in the upper corner of Arkansas and it -- it's pretty nice.  We had a lot worse winter this time.  We didn't do much outside but --
R:  Yeah, I have a lot of friends --
L:  -- it's a beautiful day.  We've been outside all day.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I went to a wedding today, so ...
L:  Oh, really.
R:  -- we were kinda stuck inside but it rained a bit so ...
L:  Oh.  
R:  [inaudible]
L:  You just must have got the rain that we had the other day.  It just moved on through.
R:  It wasn't as bad today as it was yesterday.
L:  You sound like they woke you up when they called you.
R:  Oh, no, no, no.  [LAUGH] I'm on, um [LIPSMACK] some medication for an illness so I sound a little --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- groggy, I'm sorry.
L:  That's -- that's okay.  So, what kind of outdoor activity do you -- do you like to ...?
R:  Well, I love going to the beach and to the pool.  Um, baseball.  I've always loved baseb- baseball.
L:  They have baseball in Florida?
R:  Well, no that's -- when I was younger in South Carolina.  You know, I have anything like that ... for adults here unfortunately.
L:  Um ...
R:  My dad used to coach a baseball team so, uh ... we would all as kids get together and play in the front yard.  We lived in -- in, uh, the country and my front yard was about the size of a baseball field so ... we'd all go out and play there.  Uh, you can imagine mowing the lawn, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  [LAUGH] Um, but where I live, um [LIPSMACK] I live in an apartment.  We have a lake with a fountain in the middle and I like to take walks outside by the lake and -- and picnic and things like that.
L:  Yeah, we've been planting trees and flowers outside and -- and we have a really nice park at -- in town that we were -- we're heading up there today.  We went up last weekend, it was ... uh, the ducks were out there and the kids were out playing with the ducks and feeding them bread and ...
R:  Oh, yeah, we have ducks too, but I don't have kids.  I have cats.
L:  That's me.  I don't have any kids.  We go out there and watch the other kids. 
R:  Mm.
L:  I have -- I have three cats too.
R:  I have two.
L:  In fact, when I came in here into the bedroom to get away from the TV so I could talk to you --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- all the cats came with me. 
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And they're like, "Who're you talking to?  Who're you talking to?" and then my husband came in here and he started making faces at me so ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I sent him back into the living room.
R:  But, uh ... and so I like to do that.  It -- the -- the ponds or the lake is right outside my back patio.
L:  Oh, that must be nice then.
R:  And, uh, sometimes the ducks will come up to the patio and the cats will go nuts.  They'll --
L:  Oh, imagine!
R:  -- watch 'em but --
L:  They wanna go out and play with 'em or have them for supper?
R:  [LAUGH] Um, but we like to go out and feed the ducks and everything and we have a zoo nearby so we like to go to the zoo on occasion.
L:  Yeah, that's nice -- things to do out- outside.
R:  Mm.
L:  We like to barbecue a lot and have the, you know, family over.  It's always nice to barbecue and -- and sit around outside and right now we haven't got the mosquitoes too bad.  You know, it's the state bird of Arkansas, you -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Sounds like South Carolina too.  That's where I'm from.  That was -- that's where I was raised.
L:  Yeah.  We have a -- [LAUGH] we had a saying around here, you know, storks don't deliver our babies, the mosquitoes do. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They're bigger than the storks are so ... [LAUGH]
R:  But, uh, we have a zoo and we like going up to the zoo on occasion ... just wandering around watching the animals.  Um --
L:  Yeah, the zoo in Memphis is about to get a set of pandas in from ...
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- overseas, uh, China or Japan or something so I'm planning on going down there when they get them set up.  Y'all come after the newness wears off because they've been hitting it so hard on the news, they have a feeling you probably won't even get to get in to see 'em when they first get here. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  That -- that'd be something I want to look forward to doing next -- you know, later in the summer.
R:  Yeah, my husband's not much of an outdoor person.  He's ... really big into computers --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so I have to drag him out sometimes and ... I like to go at nighttime when it's not crowded --
L:  To the zoo?
R:  -- out to the beach.
L:  Oh, out to the beach?  I bet that is nice.
R:  Yeah, and just, you know, take walks along the beach and --
L:  Are you on the inside of Florida or on the outer coast?
R:  Um, I'm in northeast Florida.
L:  Oh, over by Jacksonville?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I was Jacksonville once for a derby.  Beaches are beautiful.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Uh --
R:  And, uh, some places you can go and -- and pick up gorgeous shells ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- little -- and sometimes little tiny itty bitty shells --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that are so cute.  I have a little jar ... that's full of tiny shells that I picked up.
L:  Hang on.   Jim?  One of my cats is trying to haul my carton.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Have him come and get him out.  But, um ... [inaudible] Kelly?  Um, [MN] we're wanting to come to Orlando maybe later on.  Um, I've been there once before but it was in November and it was really nice except for a hurricane came back but ... I, uh, I'd like to go back there this summer but I have a feeling the crowds will be ... um --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- outlandish to try to even -- we walked on Space Mountain when I went there before --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with no waiting.  But, you know, the hurricane did come back, so I mean, we had to deal with ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the wind and the rain but ... yeah, it just, you know, it was, uh -- it was nice 'cause we walked on Space Mountain and, uh, Splash Mountain, you didn't have to worry about getting wet [LAUGH] 'cause you were already soaking wet when you came down it.
R:  [LAUGH] We went to, uh, Orlando for our honeymoon and, uh, we spent a week there going to the different parks and everything, and they closed Disney because of a hurricane ...
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- during our honeymoon.  It was so funny.  Everything was closed so we were stuck in our room, and we were starving --
L:  Well, it was your honeymoon; you didn't need to go out anyway.
R:  [LAUGH] Well ... true but, uh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- we were starving though and nothing was open.  We were driving all over trying to find something open to get something to eat and ended up finding a seven eleven, so we -- we were like eating chips and dip and -- and you know, the seven eleven nachos --
L:  You have to do what you have to do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We went to a little place over here, it's like a -- a -- it's hardy.  It's just a -- a small community and it's kinda quiet and they have, you know, like a ... a -- not jazz festivals, what is it?  Like [inaudible] music ...
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and we went over there and we both work nights so we didn't get up 'til like one.  Well, we went and ... had lunch and then we went to -- shopping and different things and -- and about eight o'clock, you know, we decided we wanted something to eat, well, [LAUGH] over there, they roll the sidewalks up at eight o'clock. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Nothing open.  We finally ended up at a gas station and got a pizza.  One of those gas station pizzas.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But when you get hungry, you eat what you have to, you know.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  What you can find.
R:  [LAUGH] Definitely.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But it was so funny.  Well, I mean, if nothing else it -- it made it memorable, you know.  It -- it was --
L:  Right.
R:  -- inconvenient at the time ... because, um, we'd been inside the park, maybe two, three hours and had seen hardly anything and as you know, [inaudible] you know, everybody leave and -- and ... everybody just is you know so confused and ... looking at each other like, "I don't know what's going on" ... 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, um ... at the motel --
L:  My husband's making faces at me again. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] The motel, um ... had left notes on everybody's doors about the hurricane and how people were evacuating and everything and that, uh --
L:  [LAUGH] They were evacuating?
R:  Oh yeah, they -- they evacuated and everything.  That's why everything was closed.  It was -- it was so funny.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh ...
L:  No.  I'm trying to get him to go get me some Sprite.  He's thinking I need a mixed drink.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He's so funny.  We're newlyweds.  We've got married in ... April -- we got married in August he only bought the house.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we, uh ... um, had our formal wedding on Valentine's Day.
