L:  Hi, this is Bonnie.
R:  Hi, this is Shirley.
L:  Hi, Shirley.
R:  How're ya doin'?
L:  Good --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and how are you?
R:  I'm pretty good.  This is the first time I've done this, um --
L:  Well, it's my first time, too.
R:  Oh, no. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, it's the blind leading the blind.
R:  Yeah, that's what it sounds like.  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh well, I guess we ought to get started.
L:  [MN]
R:  We only have ten minutes, um, you want to go first?
L:  [SIGH] Well, um, I guess the topic is, uh, friends --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and asking do I have a lot of friends and acquaintances or just a few [SIGH]. I would say, uh, I'm pretty sociable so I get out and I -- I know quite a few people and so I'd say I'd run into the grocery store and I end up talking to a stranger and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- exchanging phone numbers, and --
R:  Okay, so I understand why you have so many friends.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it's just that's the way I was raised.  I'm from Minnesota, uh, originally and -- and that's just the atmosphere in the upper Midwest and I guess I just haven't let go of that atmosphere.  So, where are you from?
R:  Well, I'm originally from Virginia, Newport News, Virginia, but right now I'm in South Carolina --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- and, uh, I, um -- I have a few close friends that I call all the time, uh, particularly one -- one good friend that I call just about every day and talk to her about, uh, what's going on and keep her updated and, uh, she lets me know all her trials and tribulations so we make it through the week that way.
L:  [MN] Well, that's great.  How long have you known each other?
R:  Oh goodness, it's been about three or four years.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Wow.  I used to have a friend like that that, uh, we always talked and if we didn't talk for a while it's just like we had telepathy and knew we were thinking of each other and -- and then my phone would ring or her phone would ring and she'd go, "I knew it was you".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But unfortunately I lost her in a car accident.
R:  Oh no, that's terrible.
L:  But I'm real close with my sisters as well so we -- we see each other or talk to each other almost every day.  My neighbors -- we live in a very, uh, very close knit neighborhood that, uh -- they're always over here or we're at their houses.  In fact we just, uh, had a thirty ninth birthday party for a neighbor last night, barbecued at our house, and the kids and everyone were here so it's fun.
R:  So, you have a lot of relatives that live close to you?
L:  I only have my sisters and their families.
R:  Sisters and their families.
L:  But all my husband's --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- relatives are back in the Midwest but we get to see them.  In fact, um, my sister in law and my niece came and visited last week for a break to get out of the cold --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and we spent, uh, quite a bit of time with them and we're going next week to, uh, go visit my husband's sister and husband because they're going to Las Vegas for the week so we're going to drive over and spend a couple of days with them.
R:  That sounds nice.
L:  Yeah, it -- it really is --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- nice to keep in touch with everyone.
R:  I try and keep in touch with my family but I'm in South Carolina and they're in Virginia so I -- you know, I call 'em about once a week but, um, you know, it's good to keep in touch.
L:  Mhm.  Do you come from a big family or ...?
R:  Well, there's -- there's five in my family.  I've got, uh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- three sisters, four sisters and a brother.
L:  That's a good size. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Ah.
L:  And do you have any kids?
R:  Uh, I have four children.  They're up in age now.  Um, I've got one getting -- my youngest is getting ready to graduate from coll-  -- uh, from high school.
L:  Oh, so do I.  I have, uh, one that, uh, graduates May twenty ninth.
R:  Oh, how about that.
L:  My youngest.  Mhm.  And then I -- my oldest, uh, is getting married in September.
R:  Oh, lucky you.  None of mine are married.
L:  Ah well, this is our first.  In fact, uh --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- uh, they moved away and -- moved to California couple of years ago and that was so tough even though it wasn't that far away.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It felt really tough having her that far away and thank goodness she got homesick and -- and, uh, asked us to help move 'em back so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they -- they only live --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- a few miles away from us so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we get to see them quite often, too.
R:  I know you're happy about that.
L:  I am, I really am. [LAUGH]
R:  [COUGH] [LAUGH] Ah.
L:  And -- but, uh, it -- it's great having that connection with people.  It's just -- it helps you get through the day, and I also belong to a women's empowerment group that is actually by phone and it's women all over the country and it's a conference call and we talk twice a week for just an hour each time.
R:  And how many women are involved in the conference call?
L:  Uh, usually there is about eight but we invite people all the time, you know.  It -- the -- we look for women that really want to be inspired and upliftment and -- and, you know, really empower each other.  And it really is a great group and you just get off the phone --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- feeling really wonderful and you really connect with these women.  We talk about, uh, inspirational things, things that, you know, can really make you feel better and --
R:  Well, that's -- I've never heard anything like that.
L:  Well, it's a -- a -- it's a group that's been going on for, I guess, eighteen years all over the country and it's just, um, a friend of mine belonged to it and she goes, "Oh, you should get on the call and try it" and so I -- I've been doing it for almost a year and a lot of the women right he- -- are right here in Phoenix but, uh, a lot of 'em are all over -- Indiana, Chicago, um, Montana, Kentucky, so you get a variety of women.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And it -- it's fun.  It really helps you just, uh -- it lifts you up and -- and keeps you going for the rest of the week.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That sounds good.
L:  Yeah.  Well, you can tell, I like to talk so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's right up my alley [LAUGH]. Do you have a -- what kind of neighborhood do you live in?
R:  [LIPSMACK] [COUGH] Excuse me. [COUGH] Um --
L:  [MN]
R:  I've got close neighbors, I mean, real close, um, and there's al- -- it -- it's in a sub division.
L:  Oh, that's good.  So you're like our -- our neighborhood and know each other and -- and socialize together.
R:  Well, I don't socialize too much.
L:  Pretty much a home body, then or ...?
R:  Yeah, um, I don't do a whole lot of talking so I -- I don't, uh, know -- you know, know a whole lot of people too well.  I need to get over it though.  I need to learn how to do some small talk 'cause, um, that's the way you get to know people.
L:  Oh, sure.  And just, uh, a smile can start the whole conversation.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I [inaudible]
R:  Are you still there?
L:  Yes [inaudible]
R:  I'm losing you, I can't hear.
L:  Uh-oh.  Can you hear me now?
R:  Yes, yes, I can.
L:  Oh, good.
R:  Well, I've been labelled as shy so I guess that -- that fits 'cause I'm not very outgoing.
L:  Well, you don't sound like you're shy.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, over the phone, you know, there -- it's not, uh -- it's not threatening.  You don't know the other person and you can say what you want, you know, a little uninhibited and -- but when you see somebody face to face it's like, "Okay, this is a little bit different".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, I guess that's true but I guess my parents were really sociable people and -- and I was, believe it or not, very shy all my life and I used to hide behind my mom when people would say, "Oh, is that your little girl?" and I met my husband who was extremely outgoing, the total opposite of me, and, uh, in college he -- he belonged to a frat house and he'd say, "Oh, you've got to come to the frat house, we're having a party" and I'd go, "No, I don't like crowds", I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, if I'm with people I know --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I'm -- I'm okay but --
R:  Right, right.
L:  I -- he'd say, "Oh here, I'll introduce you to Susie and -- and this is Tom and I'll be right back" and I wouldn't see him for hours and I'd just be so nervous --
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  -- so -- so uncomfort- --
R:  Well, how did you get over it?
L:  I finally figured I had to start being --
