L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Patricia Slager from Winston Salem, North Carolina.
R:  Oh, wow!  Oh, I'm Brenda Lindquist from, um, Lafayette, Indiana.
L:  Oh, oh [LAUGH] right.
R:  [LAUGH] I didn't hear the beginning of the message because something else was going on but I did hear say, "Introduce yourself to the other participant". [LAUGH]
L:  Was this to talk about friendship, friends and whether they're -- we have friends that are numerous or whether we have few -- few close friends. [LAUGH] How about you? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, oh.  Well, I have some of both but I call, um -- like the numerous number of friends I call them acquaintances but I have really good acquaintances too so, you know -- but I have -- I have several really good friends that I've had, like, all -- my whole lifetime and I'm in my fifties so [LAUGH] it's been a long time that I've had 'em as friends.  What about you?
L:  Same here.  I'm in my sixties, I'm a little senior here.  Uh, yes, I have friends I've had all my life but it seems like the friends that I -- friendships that I have developed, uh, that we ha- -- really have become like a kindred spirit, they're always there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, they are my friends forever and, like you, I have acquaintances but quality acquaintances.  I'm not really a social person that collects people [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, I think I'm too busy to do -- to do that but, um, the friends that I have we have a lot in common and I'm comfortable with them and I can trust them with everything or anything and they're just always there and I know they're always there if I need them and it -- we can go for weeks or months and not talk to each other.  Like I have lived in nine States before and in my living in that many States I kept friends like Christmas cards or whatever.  But just to give you an example, last week a friend I haven't seen in twenty years, and maybe talked to during that time three or four times -- we sent Christmas cards [LAUGH] and that's about it, and maybe we'll say, "We have another grandbaby" or whatever -- they just called and said, "We're going to be in your area, we're taking a cross country trip, we'd like to stop in and see you" [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  We are so excited. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yes, yeah.  Isn't it neat?
L:  And it sound like we're just picking up where we left off [LAUGH] and it's been --
R:  Yeah.
L:  The kids were babies then and now they have their own babies, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  Oh well, you know, I think that is a sign though of a true friendship.
L:  It is.
R:  You know, I mean of where you just have an enduring friendship, where you feel as if you have just -- you can pick up wherever you left off, no matter how many years it's been.
L:  That's true, that's really true, and you have -- it seems like there's some friends that they can be busy or involved or whatever but you know that if there is a need they will call, you will just rise to that occasion.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or, if you have a need, they'll rise to that occasion.  Maybe you haven't heard from 'em or have been too busy to [SIGH] plan anything and you'll just call 'em and say, "You know, I just had you on my mind" or whatever and it doesn't matter.  It's just the sweetest kind of thing and I think I like also that I can be vulnerable to my friends.  I mean, they can come over and catch me --
R:  Right.
L:  -- not at my best or my house not the cleanest.  I run a day care so --
R:  Oh, wow.
L: -- there's usu- -- [LAUGH] there's a lot --
R:  Oh, wow, you must have some energy.
L:  Yeah,  I tell you there's a lot of stuff around.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And they -- they can come in, I'd love to have it kinda guest related, but they can come in and move things aside and take the toys and everything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and sit down and they can go to the kitchen and the dishes may be still in the sink and they'll just -- just have some coffee, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think those kind of things they build and you can cry with them if there's something sad and you can laugh if there's something [LAUGH] happy and -- and you can care about them, you pray for each other, because we're Christians and we really always do that and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that kind of cements things and --
R:  It does, it does.
L:  So, we feel like that -- you -- someone -- I read somewhere that friends are like fl- -- flowers you gather for a bouquet and it -- it's really true.  Each one of 'em has their own beauty and their own function and there's no competition or any real threat but, you know, you're never -- you know you're never alone or isolated.  They're there, out there, so -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I have, um -- it's kind of odd, um -- I still think I'm more comfortable with friends closer to my own age in general, you know.  However I have such a diversified group of friends and, if they do meet each other, they -- you would think that since I like them they'd all like each other but I find quite often that they don't necessarily, um, and then I have a friend who has recently -- just really, we hit if off but she's only twenty three years old.
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  And I'm actually old enough to be her grandma, you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, [LAUGH] well, her mom was really young but, uh --
L:  And she doesn't see it?
R:  Pardon me?
L:  She doesn't see it?
R:  Yeah, well, she does with me, one on one but then one of my other friends was over who is in her seventies and she was -- my friend who is in her seventies was sitting at the table, um, my kitchen table.  I didn't realize they were both going to come over but I just had surgery Friday, and the other friend is very -- she just kind of takes care of herself, she doesn't expect me to wait on her and so she went to the refrigerator --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- got something to drink and -- and the -- the older friend just about fell off the chair, you know.  She was just appalled. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I kinda liked it because I don't have to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to attend to her all the time, you know, she just makes herself comfortable.
L:  There's a compliment in there for you.  It says that you make me feel so comfortable that I know that I -- I can take liberties and -- and -- and it's okay and that's like saying your home must make her feel at home and there -- there's homes you go into that you don't feel that.
R:  True.
L:  So, I think there's a compliment when someone, uh, decides that they can save you, uh, the steps or whatever and say, "If you don't mind, I'll just go to the refrigerator and pour myself a -- a glass of juice" or something.  I think that's a wonderful compliment.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  I do, too.  And I have friends likewise that are young and old but then I have -- have remarried after many, many years of divorce and my husband's a lot younger than I am and so we -- we flow in two different groups.  We find that we're -- that we're, like, magnetized by the young people that he finds interesting and a lot of energy with and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, uh, and then he feels very comfortable in the grandma, grandpa set  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He's sort of adopted my children and their children and he --
R:  Wow.
L:  He feels like he's a grandpa and sometimes I think he acts more like one than I do. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's what happens you live with somebody for a few years, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  [MN]
R:  I got remarried after -- after ten years of being divorced, you know, but I married a guy that was a year older than me, uh, but he had trouble adjusting to the grandpa situation --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- whereas I -- because I was a grandma and he wasn't, you know, at that point.
L:  But that -- that passes so quickly 'cause you know children have a way of getting into your hearts and they make friends for you, too. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, my grandkids will -- they make friends for us because they have their little girlfriends and we actually have met two neighbors that we hadn't had a chance to get to know because the little kids found each other --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and so we found out, "Well, we have to get to know them".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We thought, "Wow, they're so cool.  We've got to have them over for dinner one night" [LAUGH] and we didn't even -- we'd just seen them in passing, we didn't realize, you know.  So, sometimes we could -- you can see the friends or about to be friends --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and that's the really important part, too [NOISE] is you're always open to increase the numbers if that's -- you know, if that's what's meant to be and -- and it goes on.
R:  I think so.  I think when you're a Christian, too, your heart is open to all kinds of relationships and accepting people --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- as they are --
L:  Oh yes, oh yes. [NOISE]
R:  -- not as you, you know, expect them to be.
L:  And you have an in- -- instant common denominator --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because you have faith and that -- that instant faith, that instant common denominator puts you in the same value system.
R:  True.
L:  And -- and that's what so cool 'cause you can, uh -- you already have w- -- it saves working through a lot of stuff [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But we have friends that aren't Christian that -- that, um, we believe will be and --
R:  Great.
L:  -- they're drawn to us and that --
R:  Ah!
L:  We think that's really good, too.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And we teach in a -- we teach school in a church school and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and, uh, we're finding that these little children, uh, that we teach are fifth and sixth graders, they kinda look to us as -- one -- one of the little girls wrote us an email and she said [SIGH], "You are my very best friend".
R:  Oh.
L:  And I -- you never ever think about a ten year old thinking that I'm their best friend.
R:  Oh.
L:  And we just thought that was so special.  We said well we know we're meant to be in her life, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  So, that is --
R:  Oh, my, that is special.
L:  That's real special.  But, you know, you talk about getting married again.  You know, I -- I married my friend,  I -- and we hear that statement and I never thought, "Yeah".  The first time I was married I was a kid and the second time we were just buddies and friends for a year and a half and it -- it is true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The friendship being there first makes the marriage so inevitable --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It -- it -- yeah, makes it so beautiful.
R:  Yes, yeah, 'cause the friendship is enduring, you know, and some of the more superficial things --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- usually are not.
L:  That's true.
R:  So --
L:  You -- you're --
R:  That's true.
L:  You're absolutely right and there's times of a special occasions and stuff --
R:  Oh, oh.
L:  -- they're wonderful.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, what do we do now?
L:  Has she buzzed us yet?
R:  Uh, I didn't hear anything.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, she said at ten minutes she would let us know but, by golly, this could go on.  I think you're pretty special. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you know what, I was thinking the same thing.
L:  I think we have a lot in common.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I love Indiana. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow, wow, [LAUGH] wow.
L:  I have a daughter --
R:  I don't know if we're allowed to give our email addresses or not but I could give you mine.
L:  Oh, I'd love that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mine's probably easier to remember so let me give you mine.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It's fi- -- we like to go fishing --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and it's fishbytes, spelled F.I.S.H.B.Y.T.E.S., and we're AOL dot com.
R:  Oh, wow, yeah.  So, it's, uh, B.Y.T.E.S. --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- fishbytes?
L:  Fishbytes.
R:  Oh, that is cute.
L:  One -- no spaces.
R:  Yes.
L:  And what I -- my husband kinda won me with promising to teach me fly fishing --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and that -- that kinda drew me in, you know [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] He just reeled you in then, didn't he?
L:  That's it, that's it, that's it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's it.  Went from friendship to fish -- fishing companion. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, oh, what better thing.  Oh, that just, um, strengthens the friendship. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's exactly true.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, this is exciting and, uh, you know one of --
R:  Yes.
