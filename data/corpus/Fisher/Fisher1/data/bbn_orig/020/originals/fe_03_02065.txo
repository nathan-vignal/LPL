R:  Um, my name's Catherine.
L:  Hello, my name's Nancy.  How are you?
R:  I'm okay.  Uh, where are you?  You have an accent, where're you from?
L:  [LAUGH] I'm from Leeds, Alabama, right outside of Birmingham, Alabama.
R:  Okay.
L:  Southern accent, huh?
R:  Yeah, definitely is.
L:  Where're you from?
R:  I'm -- I'm in -- well, I'm not from Philadelphia but I live in Philadelphia. [MN]
L:  Well, nice to talk to you tonight.
R:  Yeah, I -- this is my first call but --
L:  Mine too.
R:  Okay, cool.  Well, we're supposed to talk about warm weather ...
L:  Activities?
R:  Yeah, or cold weather.  So, I bet you probably like the warm weather down there.
L:  I like the warm weather.  I really do like the warm better.  I just got back from Colorado and I had to -- a chance to do some cold weather -- cold activities and I believe I'll just take the warm m- more of -- I like it better.
R:  Yeah, I grew up in the pacific northwest and so it's pretty mild, but I was really close to the mountains so we went skiing a lot and I really, really don't like snow and cold.  I mean, I like cold weather but I don't like cold weather activities.  Like, I don't like winter sports so ... definitely prefer warmer things.
L:  Well, we're just getting into spring here and I just love the warm weather and what you can do outside.  I love to walk.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've been walking outside a lot, out in the -- I prefer outside activities better than inside.
R:  Yeah, I definitely prefer outside activities.  Like, I ride my bike everywhere and so I definitely like to ride my bike, um, for fun too so ...
L:  Good exercise too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've been trying to get up and walk early in the mornings for exercise and -- and for outdoor activities too and just to enjoy the fresh air and being outside.
R:  Mm, yeah.  Being outside is really nice although --
L:  I also like to go boating.  I don't have a chance to do that much --
R:  Ooh, boating!
L:  -- but I love going boating.  And I used to ski a lot outside but I don't do that much anymore.  It's old age is creeping up on me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I like doing that too.  I like fishing, or especially when the fish are biting I like doing things like that outside.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know ... my -- my parents are really into boating.  They have a sailboat and a ... and a motorboat and I really -- I don't know.  I like being -- I like swimming in the water.  I don't like being in the boat.
L:  You swim?
R:  Yeah.  I'd rather just be like all the way in the water instead of like on the water, you know?
L:  We don't live too far from the lake and I just like to go to the lake and just fish and swim and just picnic.  Just anything to do outside I enjoy that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  My children do too.
R:  Oh, how many kids do you have?
L:  I have three.
R:  Oh.
L:  And they all live -- all grown, but they all live outside and they stay outside and when they come home to visit we always go -- go outside.  Like, last Sunday at Easter we went outside and made pictures.  Just enjoy being outside and took the baby for a ride in the stroller and just enjoyed being outside and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- doing things.
R:  Are things blooming yet?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Good.  Yeah, things are just starting to bloom now so ...
L:  A little bit cool here today, but I was, uh, doing some yard work and just ... it's a little bit cool wind blowing but it's going to be warmer tomorrow.
R:  Yeah, in Philly it gets really hot so I don't like to be around much in the city 'cause it's a big city.  There's so much cement [SIGH] it's kinda hard to leave the city sometimes in the summer but [SIGH] it's nice when I do. [MN]
L:  Oh, some of the cold weather activities I just finished, uh, my second time snowmobiling.
R:  Snowmobiling?
L:  Snowmobiling.  Twenty five miles.  That was a lot for one day.
R:  Wow.  How fast could you get up in this?
L:  Uh, we went about -- got about forty five miles an hour.
R:  Forty five miles an hour?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Wow, I don't think I'd wanna go that fast.
L:  Well, I was always the last one in line.  We, you know, follow --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- each other and I was always the last one in line but when we got to the open field, my daughter rode -- I rode back with her, we really went fast so, you know --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- on the buddy thing.
R:  That's cool.
L:  But it was, um, quite an experience.  But that -- it just so happened that day was war- it warmed up and we even got warming fa- my face got blistered that day.  So, it really wasn't the cold, cold weather that normally you have snowmobiling.  So, we just kinda lucked up that day.
R:  Hm.
L:  And also we went tubing.  Have you ever heard of that?
R:  Oh, yeah, tubing is great!  That's like the one winter sport I like.  Like, on the snow, right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, that's the best.
L:  You ride like an incline up go in your tube and you -- you come down off the mountain with your tube.
R:  Mhm, mhm.  That is really fun.
L:  So, much fun.
R:  Way more fun than skiing.  I don't like skiing.
L:  Yes, I -- my balance isn't very good for skiing.  I don't know, that wasn't my thing, skiing.  I did that last year and I thought, "No, not for me".
R:  Yeah, it's definitely ...
L:  I'll come down on my butt other than ...
R:  Mm, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Tubing down rivers is really fun.
L:  Well, this was -- oh, I -- I did that one time too in Colorado.
R:  Yeah.  My -- one of my best friends growing up had a farm and a huge river running through her farm and we'd go tubing all summer long and it was ... really the best thing ever ... growing up so ...
L:  That's kind of a laid back ... good -- good thing to do in the summer, isn't it?
R:  Mhm.  Really relaxing.  Well, parts of the river are really fast and kinda rocky so it's kind of like an adventure but, yeah, it's definitely relaxing.
L:  Have you ever been rafting?
R:  No.  Haven't been rafting yet.
L:  That's fun too.
R:  I'd like to try it some time.
L:  The one time -- I been a coupla times and last time I went it was ki- you know how you go with a guide and all that?
R:  Mhm.
L:  It was kinda -- it was kinda fun.
R:  That was in Colorado?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Hm [LIPSMACK].  Haven't been to Colorado much.
L:  A lot to do there.  I've been in the summer and in the winter.  My daughter lives there so [inaudible].
R:  Ah, okay.
L:  My -- probably my chance to go, do well.  So, last year when we went, we went sn- oh, dog sledding.
R:  Dog sledding?  That would be something.  That would be cool.
L:  That was really a lot of fun.  You think, "Oh, that's not gonna be fun" but it was a great outdoor activity that you only do one time in your life.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  We had a lot of fun doing that.  We got to drive them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sled thing and the dogs and the ...
R:  Yeah.  Huh.
L:  -- the whole nine yards, so all the -- and [inaudible] might do that if they had a chance.  Her husband -- see, he's been up there five years and he said I did more in a week than he'd done in the whole five years since he had lived there but I kinda tried to pack it all in -- in one week.
R:  Yeah, when you're trying -- yeah, visiting, trying to do everything. 
L:  It's kind of a fr- you know, one time only deal thing.
R:  Mhm, mhm.  Huh, I'll have to try that sometime.
L:  What do you like do inside?
R:  Mm ... I don't like being inside.  [LAUGH] Uh, I'm inside too much in my life.  Um, [LIPSMACK] ... I like watching movies, I like reading ... like, knitting.  I like ... I don't know.  I don't like being inside.  If it's nice out, I prefer to be outside.
L:  Me too.
R:  Like, I mean, now I'm having a barbeque in my -- you know, my backyard so it'll be nice, and like working in my garden and that kinda thing.
L:  I'm not much and a lotta people play games and stuff inside but I never have been much on that.
R:  No.
L:  I -- I like don't watch the movies [inaudible] and I took a break and watched a movie then, and I like to read also and ... but other than that I'm like you.  I'd rather be outside and ...
R:  Yeah.  It feels good --
L:  I've just recently got a new house and you have the big screen in front porch.
R:  Ooh!
L:  And so I'm planning on spending a lot of time out there just in -- just relaxing --
R:  Mm, mm.
L:  -- in spring and summer.
R:  Screened in so it keeps the bugs out?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, that would be nice.
L:  Mhm.  But I definitely prefer the outside.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I like to do yard work.  Do you like to do yard work?
R:  Yes, yeah, I do.  I have to have a garden wherever I live so ...
L:  What do you grow?
R:  Um, grow -- I try to grow sunflowers.  Like, I really -- zinnias have worked really well in this climate in Philly but tomatoes, um, hot peppers, carrots, all kinds of herbs.  I like zucchinis, pumpkins, any kind of squashes grow really well.  Um, when I lived in Portland, I had a lot of berries, um [LIPSMACK] but they don't really grow around here very well.  Kind of a lot of work.  I don't have a very -- I live in a row home so I don't have a big yard.  It's pretty small so I have to pack everything in, but, um ...
L:  I've never tried to grow herbs.  I've always heard -- seen it but I definitely think I've never tried to grow.
R:  They're really easy.  They're really easy.  Especially if you just get like a start from a garden center.  You just put it in the ground and ... there you go [SIGH].  You don't really have to --
L:  [inaudible] flowers too working in the garden.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I tried to plant a few tomatoes and peppers and that's about it.
R:  Yeah.  They're pretty easy --
L:  That's better than nothing though.
R:  No, they're pretty -- they're pretty, um, good hardy plants, tomat- well, it depends on the kind of tomato you get, but peppers and tomatoes usually are pretty adaptable ... [SIGH] and they like sun but [SIGH] I don't know, they're pretty hardy.  [LIPSMACK] At least here they are.  I don't know about down south.
L:  Yeah, they're pretty hardy here.  Everybody usually plants after Good Friday so I'm kinda behind.  I've gotta get mine planted.  Like I said, we've had some cool nights.  It was real warm then all of a sudden it -- it's what they call blackberry winter 'cause the blackberries have started blooming.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, we kinda turned cool back cold, so it's just now getting planting time again.
R:  Yeah, they -- they say here that you're not supposed to really put stuff in the ground 'til Mother's Day but --
L:  Oh, really?  I heard it was Good Friday which was last week.
R:  Yeah.  No, I -- I -- we put some flowers in the ground and they're doing fine so far.  I mean, it's not gonna freeze.  There's not -- there's no way there's gonna be like -- it's gonna get below freezing right now.  [LAUGH]
L:  I did something today I've never done before.  I had some big ferns and I planted them in the ground.  Usually I just plant 'em in big containers.
R:  Mm.
L:  but I took 'em out of the containers and planted them in the ground.  I -- up on a kind of a porch awning in the shade.
R:  Yeah, they're definitely shade.
L:  Yeah, they gotta have shade, so I'm real -- gonna be really interested in how my ferns are gonna do planted in the ground instead of the big container this year.
R:  Huh.  Yeah, ferns grow everywhere where I'm from.  Like, they grow as tall as me, bigger than me ... they're like everywhere but that's Oregon.
L:  I've got one that I kept over through the winter at work and it was huge.  It took two people to pick it up.
R:  Wow.
L:  And we potted it today so I'm anxious to see how it'll do.  I babied that thing all winter long and swept up under it and ...
R:  Hm.
L:  -- 'cause they shed so bad so I ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- pride myself for carrying it over.
R:  Hm.
L:  That's about my favorite, is ferns.  I love ferns.
R:  Yeah,  ferns are really nice 'cause they don't much work and they grow really well and they're really a nice ... touch in the garden.
L:  That's one thing I really enjoy is -- is flowers and planting outside and just seeing everything grow and going out the next day and see what's happened.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Look at your handiwork, I guess you would say.
R:  Exactly, yes.  You -- you accomplish something.
L:  And it's always so pretty after the grass is cut and ...
R:  That's one thing, I don't have a lawn.  I don't really have room for a lawn.  I mean, I don't have a front yard at all.  It's just the, uh [NOISE] ... like, my stoop and then the sidewalk.
L:  You said your house was what?
R:  It's a row home.  Um, on -- like, on the east coast there's like houses that are like old brick houses, usually, um, [LIPSMACK] -- and they're right up next to each other so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there's not like a space between the next house.  Like, they're all smooshed together, which is nice in the winter because ...
