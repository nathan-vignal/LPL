R:  [NOISE] Melissa.
L:  Hi, my name is Avalon.
R:  [NOISE] Sorry, my daughter's, like, crying.
L:  That's okay.  I have one of those, too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Honey, bring me a lighter.
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  I was talking to my daughter.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  Never mind, it's here.  Go ahead.  We're supposed to talk about friends.
R:  Yeah, I think that's what they said.
L:  Okay, do --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- want me to lead off or do you want to?
R:  Uh, why don't you go ahead.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, my very best friend of ten years died about five years ago.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, I'm so sorry.
L:  And I never have replaced her but, life goes on.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And I found out recently that I have a lot of friends, more than I thought I did --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because of some, uh, family challenges.  We live in a real small rural community --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and my daughter has some behavioral problems and I had some people come to my assistance and aid that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was above and beyond the call of duty or friendship, either one.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, that was gratifying and I think friends are just about as important as food, air and water [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE]  Yes, very much so.
L:  Specially -- specially when you don't have a family --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I -- I don't have family living except my daughter.
R:  Oh, wow. [NOISE] Yeah, my friends have been there for me through a lot. [NOISE]
L:  How old is he?
R:  I just recently split up with my daughter's father and they've helped me out a lot --
L:  Oh, my.
R:  -- and supporting me and -- yeah so -- but they've been all throughout my childhood and everything.  I'm younger, so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you sound young.
R:  I'm only twenty six so --
L:  Well, I'm old enough to be your mother. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  But --
R:  So -- but, yeah, they -- they have.  I mean, I've gone [NOISE] -- my one friend, her mother was actually there for me through a lot but she was more like a friend than a mom. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- but we lost her a couple -- well, it's been almost ten years now that we lost her.
L:  Well, my friends have been more -- of more value to me than any family member ever has been.
R:  Yes.
L:  And they say --
R:  It's like they say, you can tell them anything --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and they don't judge you for it in any way.
L:  [MN]
R:  They just look past it like, "Okay, I accept you like that" and go on with life. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, and -- yeah, I'm sure you've heard the saying, Melissa, that you can pick your friends but you can't pick your family.
R:  Yes.
L:  And you can always walk away from your friends but you can't necessarily walk away from your family --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if they're dependent upon you [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not in good conscience.
R:  Sometimes you wish they could but -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, sometimes that's true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I think after nine eleven everyone came to value their friends and family a whole lot more.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And that really is more important than things.
R:  Yeah, well my sis- -- my brother is in the army and he's in New York right now and he -- my sister in law said that there's like so many people that were coming to help her because they were like so scared and she was going over everybody's house and -- 'cause they were just so scared that everybody was going to get sent away.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they said it was like -- I mean, they had friends crawling out of the woodwork, they didn't even know were there.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  People that knew them and were ju- -- it was like everything just became tighter --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- closer.
L:  Yeah, I think a family tragedy or, you know, any kind that's real upsetting tends to -- to really bring your friends out.  We moved back to West Texas recently from Dimming, New Mexico --
R:  Okay. [NOISE]
L:  And I'd just been there for, like, two and a half months and I -- I'd made friends, um, in AA and among the Green Party, which I got very active in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and with an animal rights group --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- collecting feral or free roaming kitty cats --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and getting them spayed and neutered --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and when it came time to pack the truck --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I had friends coming out of the woodwork to help pack the truck --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all of them saying, "We don't want you to leave" -- [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:   -- and that made me feel real good --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because just like friends can help --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they can also hurt you pretty deeply at times.  And I have lost some good ones, you know, death -- not through death but through attrition and just, I guess, it was time we'd learned what we had to learn from each other.
R:  Yeah.  I think my friends have taught me more out of life than anyone.
L:  Your who?
R:  My friends, they've taught me more.
L:  Your friends?
R:  Yeah, than anyone, even myself.  I've learned more from watching them [NOISE] and listening to them [NOISE] than anyone.
L:  Well, I've -- I've probably learned more from my daughter than I have anybody else.  She's developmentally disabled and she's taught me patience and compassion and [SIGH] now she's teaching me [SIGH] that there comes a time that maybe you just have to let go and put something in God's hands that you can no longer effect a change in and that's not an easy place to be.  But I know I've got friends that are supporting [SIGH], whatever happens, and that helps.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How old is your son?
R:  My daughter is two and a half.  I don't have a son, it's a daughter, little girl.
L:  Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said you had a son.
R:  No, it's okay, it's all right.
L:  Well, my daughter is not that much younger than you are.  She's twenty, she'll be twenty one in November but she's --
R:  Oh, that's a fun age.  I remember that age. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, she's about seven mentally or emotionally --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- or intellectually but she wants -- she has a twenty year old body that wants to be twenty years old.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  And it's just not real safe or feasible or practical right now.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And I'm at the risk of wearing out a bunch of my friends [LAUGH] calling for help to deal with her, I'm afraid.
R:  Yeah, but they -- if they're true friends they know that it's like you -- you only have so many resources --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and that they're going to stay there.
L:  Yeah.  Well, one of them had quit smoking six years ago and she was over here two days in a row and she bummed one of my cigarettes.  It was -- well, she had one other cigarette in six years --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I had to let her have it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I want to quit smoking but I need things to settle down. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  Ah, all my friends smoke. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  All of them are my spirits.  Like we just, like, started together and we just can't quit. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, well it -- it's difficult.
R:  [NOISE] 'Cause the only friends that I really have [NOISE] I mean, are the ones that I had in high school [NOISE] and we've been together thirt- -- thirteen, fourteen years now.
L:  Oh, that's good.  Hang on to 'em.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Take good care of 'em.
R:  Oh yeah. [NOISE] In fact, I'm in a -- one of my best friend's wedding next month.
L:  Hm.
R:  Yeah.  It's actually two -- two of my friends that I went to high school with, they decided -- in high school they were just friends and now they're getting married. [LAUGH]
L:  Well.
R:  [LAUGH] It's like, "Okay, you're weird". [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] Not really.  I -- I think it's probably -- you got the best chance of success if you marry somebody who's your best friend.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I had a gal in Huston tell me that one time.  We were talking about the guy I was living with and her husband, and she said, "I married my best friend" and I thought, "What a nice thing to say" because they, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they played together and laughed together and worked together and --
R: [NOISE]
L:  -- and they just really were good friends and I -- I don't think I'd want anybody for a mate that wasn't my best friend.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Ideally.
R:  They say the best relationships start off as a friendship, so --
L:  Big uh-oh there.
R:  And grow from there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My problem is all my friends are girls. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you know, I think my best, closest friends, for the most part, have been women.  There've been a few guys --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they're not around anymore, that were good friends but the one that was my -- what I felt was my best friend was more of an enabler than he was a -- really a friend.
R:  [NOISE]
L:   Anytime I needed help, he'd bail me out but, you know, the -- the people I've been able to talk to the most openly and trust and [SIGH] really communicate with have been women and then some of the women that have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And then some of the people that've been the nastiest to me, other than men [LAUGH] there's one or two women --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that hurt me the most.  So, I guess, people are just people.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, men can -- or women can be mean, [LAUGH] they can get downright bold.
L:  Yeah, and men won't usually go to that -- they won't put out the energy or the effort emotionally to --
R:  No, they just walk away. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  It's like, "Okay, I'm not dealing with this, I'm walking away".
L:  Yeah, they've got it easy.  I know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- very few men would have gone what I've gone through the last twenty years with my daughter.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  In fact, her -- her father didn't even want to be a part and parcel of it [SIGH] and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- left me to take care of it by myself with no family help.  So, I had a little bit of help from my friends with her. [MN] I wonder if we've used that word friends enough in this. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, this is actually the first phone call I've had.
L:  Really?
R:  Yep, this is the first time.
L:  Mine too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mine too.
R:  So -- and I just -- I was on the internet the other day, I saw it, and I thought, "Hey, well, it's a little extra money coming in the pocket, [NOISE] maybe actually meet some new people. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, did they let you make any number of calls or --
R:  [NOISE] Um, they've called -- this -- I don't know, this is the first one.  They say that it can be numerous.
L:  Oh.
R:  So --
L:  Well, I need to go back and look at that site --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because I -- where I went to it just said you can sign up and get three phone calls and talk --
R:  Just three?
L:  Talk -- yeah, and get three phone calls and talk for ten minutes on each one.
R:  Huh.  Well, I noticed that it said that there was a --  there was like an extension on it or something.  That there was like, for six to -- was it four to six weeks after the fact of the -- the whole thing going on that there was going to be more people that would get more phone calls after that, so --
L:  Well, I have to go back to that site and research it.  I was going to try to get my daughter --
