R:  Hello.  Hello.
L:  Hello.  Can you hear me?
R:  Yeah, is this -- who is this?
L:  This is Tim.
R:  Tim.  This is Bob.
L:  Hi, Bob.  How are you?
R:  Okay.  Wh- -- wh- -- what [NOISE] -- what was the topic again?
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  Inside or outside and, ah, hot or cold? 
L:  Right.  Outdoor activities and if -- ah, of those whether they are warm or cold.  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  What do you prefer, hot or cold weather?
L:  Ah, definitely warm, but, ah, I -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- don't do a lot of outdoor activities, so I am kind of a oddball to begin with, I think.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, --  
R:  [MN]
L:  -- the -- the few that I do like would be --  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like Ultimate Frisbee or, um, picnics, of course.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Barbecue type.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, things of th- that nature.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] I like indoor activity, but, um, I like to [MN] sit outside on my porch and look across the valley and see the lights at night and stuff.
L:  Oh, neat.
R:  Yeah, I like that.  It's like -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- looking at -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- stars.  [NOISE] 
L:  [MN]  So [MN], um, star gazing, that would be an activity.
R:  That would be an activity, yeah.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But it's not stars; it's lights.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Human made stars.
R:  Right, human -- 
L:  Got you. 
R:  -- made stars. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I like to watch TV a- -- or, ah, listen to music or [NOISE], ah, watch movies.  I've watched two movies today so far on HBO two.
L:  Wow.
R:  [NOISE] And, um, I'm listening to some music now.  You can probably hear it.
L:  Yeah, a little bit.
R:  And, um, um, I like to read the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times and business magazines.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm retired now, but --  
L:  Oh, that's neat.
R:  -- I like to read inside --  
L:  So it sounds like you --
R:  -- get on the computer.  
L:  -- do a lot more indoor activities.
R:  Yeah, more indoor activities.  I like cold weather.  [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  [SIGH]  
L:  I think as far as -- you won't take your Wall Street outside with you.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Probably too -- too -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Out on -- 
L:  -- bright to read.
R:  -- the porch.  Yeah, right, I did that.  [NOISE]  
L:  Oh, you did?
R:  I did, during the day, during -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the morning hours.
L:  Let's call that an out- outdoor activity, then.   
R:  What?  
L:  We should call that an outdoor activity, then.  
R:  Fresh air activities.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Neat.
R:  What do you do indoors?  
L:  Oh, mainly [inaudible] on the computer or, um, -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- ah, play with the kids.  Still have two kids at home.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, [MN] once in a blue moon I'll do the dishes and laundry -- wait, that's every day.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  My wife doesn't like doing 'em, so ...
R:  Oh. 
L:  Um, [MN] that's pretty much it.  We've been cleaning.  We are selling our house, so we are actually --
R:  Oh, are you? 
L:  Actually been -- been on, um, selling mode, so the house is clean for once.  
R:  This is a good time to sell your house.
L:  Yeah, summer.  Summer is usually the hot time, so ... 
R:  Also the interest rates are low.  
L:  Yeah.  That's a good sign.  
R:  I don't think they are going to remain low much longer.
L:  Yeah, we'll see.  Um, Green- -- Greenspan got elected for another term, and so the -- you know, at least we'll have some consistency there, but he may raise it too.
R:  Right. 
L:  Uh-huh.  Of course, prime's already immensely low. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And, um, mortgage rates are still five or -- or so per cent, so -- 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- the demand is -- is high enough that it didn't drive them down any lower. 
R:  That's right, not getting any lower. [NOISE] 
L:  Well, I'd be surprised if they do, but they might -- might get a [inaudible] --  
R:  The houses are selling for more because interest rates are low. [NOISE] 
L:  Correct.  
R:  So you want to get the most you can out of your house.
L:  We [inaudible] priced it [MN] definitely on the high side. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's reasonable.  We've already had two offers, so ... 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, those didn't work out, so we -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  -- are back on the market, but, yeah, definitely you're right -- 
R:  What part of the country do you live in?
L:  I'm in Oregon.  
R:  Oregon? 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Oh, so it's like three twenty there? 
L:  Ah, -- 
R:  Or three twenty five? 
L:  Yep, that's correct.  And you sound from the south, maybe?
R:  [MN] Well, I'm -- 
L:  Or east coast. 
R:  -- from Ohio.  
L:  Ohio.  Oh, great.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Know a few good folks from there, and I don't know any bad folks, so ... 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Radar O'Reilly of course was from O- Ottumwah.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  But I guess he was a +fictional character.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's right.
L:  But, yeah ... [PAUSE]
R:  [NOISE] Is that where the Golden State Warriors are?
L:  Ah, that -- that's California. 
R:  Oh, California. 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  What do you have in Oregon?  
L:  Um, for, um, professional just the Portland Trail Blazers.  
R:  Trail Blazers, right. 
L:  And, ah, I didn't hear if they won or lost last night.  
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
L:  Um, I'm actually a Utah Jazz fan, and they're not doing too good.  [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]  
L:  So, um, --  
R:  Where you moving?  Out the state?  [NOISE] 
L:  In, um, which part of the States?  
R:  You going to move to another state or anything? 
L:  Oh, no.  Yeah, just sa- -- actually, same town even.  Just a --
R:  Oh, is that right?  Oh.
L:  Yeah, just a little bit closer to -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- our kids' school, so --  
R:  Oh.
L:  -- make commute time a bit easier.  It's a private school.  
R:  Oh.  Well, that's smart.  [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  It'll be good -- a good deal.  
R:  We've lived in this place for, um, [NOISE] eighteen years now.
L:  Wow.  
R:  It's just me and my wife.  
L:  Oh, okay, but that -- still, that's good.  
R:  Yeah.  [MN] [NOISE] 
L:  We, um, -- been ten years for us.
R:  [NOISE] Is that right?
L:  And so good and bad time to move, I guess.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  You know, they picked the wrong topic for us.  We are both more indoorsy.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Right.  I guess it -- it -- it's not too cold there in the winter, is it? 
L:  Here?  No, we are on the western side of the mountains, so, um, pretty mild, actually.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, we get maybe one --  
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- one small snow -- 
R:  I guess you don't do any skiing or anything like that?  
L:  Well, you can drive -- plenty of -- of tall mountains and volcanos nearby you can drive to, so ...  
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] Do you do skiing?  
L:  Not me, no.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Not a big -- 
R:  What?  
L:  Not a big door -- outdoor -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- [inaudible].  I do everything indoors pretty much.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah, a lot of people love skiing.  We went and -- 
R:  I wouldn't.  I never liked it.  I had a headache [NOISE] both times I went.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah, we -- we saw -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- went and saw someone and -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, they were getting a little -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- ambulance thing to pick 'em up.  
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  They had, ah, -- I guess couldn't slow down and whacked a tree.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Whacked [inaudible]. 
L:  And I'm sure, yeah, that was not a good -- 
R:  [NOISE] What happened to Sonny Bono. 
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, that's true.  
R:  [MN] 
L:  That's true.  That's what, um, -- lost his senatorship that way.  I guess his wife took over.  
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
L:  And then, um, that happened again in Missouri -- ah, the Carnahan husband died in the -- the plane crash.
R:  Oh, that's right.
L:  And she served, and I think she got re-elected afterwards under, um, you know, her own name.  
R:  Yeah.  [MN] 
L:  So, just shows you -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- crazy Missourians.  
R:  [MN] 
L:  That's where I'm from, by the way, originally.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Where?
L:  Missouri.
R:  Missouri, yeah, St Louis? 
L:  Ah, around Jeff City.  
R:  Oh.  [MN] St Louis is a hot town right now.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  It seems to be growing again.  Um, we don't get there very often, but ...  
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  Yeah, I prefer indoor and cold weather.
L:  Oh, well, I'm indoor and warm, so ... [LAUGH] 
R:  I like it spring time and fall, though.
L:  Oh, yeah, I'm sure it's beautiful there in Ohio -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- with the -- the trees.  
R:  What?  
L:  With the -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in the fall with the trees all changing their colors.  
R:  Well, look, the temperature is not too bad.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  I just had a kidney transplant, um, [NOISE] these last six months or a year.
L:  Wow.  That'll -- that puts a [inaudible] on what you can do, right? 
R:  Well, it may -- you -- you take drugs to keep the kidney from rejecting.
L:  Got ya.  
R:  And that lowers your immunity level.
L:  Okay. 
R:  So, um, [NOISE] if it's cold out, you're more susceptible to colds and flu and stuff.
L:  Okay.  
R:  And if I lived in a warmer climate that would be good, but we're not going to move anywhere.  [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, you -- 
R:  I like it when it's [NOISE] warm or -- or -- or -- or spring or fall.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  But otherwise when it's cold I tend to get sick easy.  [MN] 
L:  [MN] Oh.  
R:  At least this last winter I did.  [NOISE] 
L:  [inaudible]  
R:  I'll find out in the future winters.
L:  Right.  I got the young kids and get sick a lot too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's right.
