R:  Hello.
L:  This is Bill.  Can you hear me? 
R:  I can hear you.
L:  Okay, and your name, first name? 
R:  I'd like to know what's this all about.  [PAUSE]
L:  Ah, what's this all about? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, ah, we're supposed to talk for eight minutes on the subject of indoor and outdoor activities.
R:  Right, but why the -- 
L:  And, ah, this is about, ah, -- from what I understand, they are -- they are developing voice recognition technology.  [PAUSE]
R:  Who made the call? 
L:  Pardon? 
R:  Who made this call? 
L:  Ah, this call came from [MN] the, ah, University of Pennsylvania -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- ah, department that's doing this, ah, study.
R:  Okay.  All right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We can talk.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You're from what state? 
R:  Delaware.
L:  Delaware.  We're at opposite ends of the country.
R:  Where are you? 
L:  I'm in southern California.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And fortunate we are -- we [MN] -- we are enjoying a beautiful, sunny southern California day.
R:  Ah, well, today we're enjoying a nice April shower spring day.
L:  I see.  We've actually had a cooler April than normal to date and, ah, --
R:  You have? 
L:  In fact, I have, ah, relatives in the upper mid west who've had some warmer days than we have had out here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in the last week.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, we are supposed to -- the topic is to discuss indoor and outdoor activities.
R:  Indoor --
L:  A- --
R:  -- and outdoor activities.
L:  And, um, [MN] just to help us carry on with the discussion, they give us a topic to discuss to make it easy.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, we don't have to just arbit- -- [MN] you know, select one for ourselves, but, ah, -- 
R:  This is the first time that I've done this.
L:  Well, this is the first time for me too, and I, ah, just signed up I think it was just yesterday.
R:  Mhm.  Okay.
L:  Got the paperwork completed and, ah, I found out about it through, ah, a party on the Internet -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- who's a contact of mine.  [LIPSMACK] And, ah, [LIPSMACK] tell me what you like to do outdoors.
R:  I like to practice tai chi outdoors.
L:  Tai chi? 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And, ah, [PAUSE] I think we have some tai chi schools here in the city in which I live.
R:  Where do you live? 
L:  I live in Hemmitt.
R:  Hemmitt.  No, I don't know that one.
L:  Hemmitt's about ninety miles --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- east of LA.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, --
R:  Well, tai chi is everywhere now.
L:  And [MN] spell it for me, would you? 
R:  How -- well, if you use the -- the [inaudible] -- well, it's spelled two ways:  T.A.I. C.H.I. C.H.U.A.N. or the latest, um, Chinese [inaudible] T.A.I. J.I. Q.U.A.N.
L:  I see.  And so it's partially self defence and, ah, what else? 
R:  Um, well, [MN] it's for good health.  It's, um, [MN] body mind practice, coordinating your thoughts and your mind together.
L:  Right.
R:  But it also is a martial art, so -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- there's that aspect of it as well.  Mhm.
L:  Um, now you say you like to do this outdoors.
R:  Right, I do.
L:  Rather than indoors.
R:  Right.
L:  Ah, that's interesting.
R:  Yeah.  Classes generally are indoors, but -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- um --
L:  So, you're talking about doing it by yourself or with others outdoors? 
R:  Um, well, I do it by myself, yeah.
L:  Well, then you must have already taken classes to know what to do and how to do it.
R:  This is true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, even if you've only had a -- [MN] a couple of classes, you could still do what you know.
L:  [inaudible] I'll imagine.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Sure.
R:  What do you like to do outside? 
L:  Oh, I'm a person of a wide range of interests.  Um, for, ah, keeping in shape I, ah, -- I take brisk walks --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, ah, since I spent so much time inside on my computer, which you happened to catch me at, ah, we [MN] -- well, we caught each other at various things [MN].
R:  Mhm.
L:  I was in the middle of doing some work on the computer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But for exercise I get out and -- generally, ah, late evening and I'll take a half an hour walk for about two miles.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then, um, when it's still light out, late afternoon or early evening as, ah, the days are longer here, I will get out for about a half an hour of bike riding.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Now those are hap- -- those happen to be activities that I presently take time for, but I love to get out in nature, um, ah, love to, um, -- love to travel, love, you know, [NOISE] many different kinds of sports.  It's just that I have not taken time -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- for many of the things I li- like, ah, recently.  And when I was raising a family our, ah, [LIPSMACK] family loved, ah, camping and we have some beautiful mountains that are -- in fact, my little valley is surrounded on three sides on mountains.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'm only a half an hour away from beautiful forested mountains, ah, and, ah, I don't know if you've ever heard of, ah, Idyllwild, California.
R:  Mm.
L:  It's west -- west of Palm Springs.  If you've ever been in Palm Springs, there's a bunch of mountains --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- just west of Palm Springs.
R:  No, I don't know them.
L:  Well, y- you sort of heard of the -- I'm sure you've heard of the city of Palm Springs.
R:  Yes, I have.
L:  And there's some big mountains between Palm Springs and L.A.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I'm on the L.A. side of those mountains.
R:  Okay.
L:  And Palm Springs is on the other side.
R:  Ahah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I lived in Mohave when I was a child.
L:  Do you remember much about that? 
R:  I remember the sand.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ahah.
L:  For sure.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Sand, sand, sand.  [LAUGH]
R:  And open space.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's something special, I think, to be raised when you're a kid, ah, with some open space to enjoy.
R:  I agree with you.  Yeah.
L:  I, ah, feel sorry for youngsters that are raised in what we could call I guess asphalt jungles.
R:  Well, I think that's why things like fresh air kids started, no opportunities to enjoy the outside.
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  Mm.  I was caught in another indoor activity [MN] with this phone call.  I was taking a nap.
L:  Oh, is that right?  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]
L:  What was your first name -- 
R:  Janet.
L:  -- may I ask?  Janet.  I have a sister whose birth name was Janet, but she kind of scrapped the E.T. at the end and has been gone by Jan every since from about high school or something -- 
R:  Mm.  No, I've n- --
L:  -- or jun- --
R:  I've never had a nickname.
L:  Ahah.  So, it's not really a nickname so much as just a shortened name.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] I -- I never had that.  And your name? 
L:  My name is Bill.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, well, what do you like to do?  Do you prefer outdoor or indoor activities?  That was one of the questions.
R:  Do I prefer -- mm, [MN] which is not the same as, "What do you usually do?"  I think I --
L:  Ah, --
R:  -- prefer outdoor.
L:  Yeah, that's true f-, um, -- what you prefer to do, as far as activity is concerned, yeah.
R:  Mhm.  You can do [MN], ah, -- pretty much anything that you can do inside you could do outside.
L:  Oh, yeah, and why not be outside as long as the weather permits.
R:  Right.
L:  And you've got fresh air and sunshine and, ah, more scenery than your four walls.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And so forth.
R:  Of course you get to breath in the dioxins.
L:  Um, tell me more about those.
R:  Dioxins? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Those are the pollutants that are in the air.
L:  Are -- oh, oh, okay, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  The, ah, -- the poisons that, ah, -- 
R:  That's right, that are, ah, lurking around here.
L:  Well, that's one of the dangers in some areas of southern California, ah, for athletes who, ah, -- well, when you have -- but as the years have gone by the smog has been less and less of a problem in southern California.  They've gotten more control of it.
R:  Right.
L:  When I first moved here in the, ah, late fifties, ah, my [MN] -- I lived in Pasadena and the mountains aren't that far from Pasadena and we couldn't see the mountains the smog was so heavy.  But I pitied these athletes [MN] who after s-, you know, high school and college are out in the fields in the afternoon trying to work out, run track, exert themselves, when, ah, they could get so choked up with the smog.
R:  Right.  I -- I once knew a, um, round town jogger and he died of lung cancer.  He --
L:  Oh, my.
R:  -- he was not a smoker at all.
L:  And so the su- suspicion is --
R:  That his running activity.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember exerting myself enough [MN], ah, in that type of, ah, pollution to really begin to feel a little choked up, yeah, and of course --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- with smarting eyes.  That was years ago, though, when I was in Pasadena in the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- early, ah, -- I actually lived there from fifty nine through seventy two.
R:  Well, California has I think always been at the forefront in -- in trying to make these environmental changes too.
L:  Oh, yes.  In +fact, we -- they've been -- [MN] gotten pretty strict on, ah, gasoline standards --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, ah, I forget the name of it.  It went by an acronym, ah, --
R:  [MN]
L: -- it's another addi- --
