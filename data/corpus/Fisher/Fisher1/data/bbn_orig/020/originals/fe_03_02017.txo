L:  Hi, my name is Frank.
R:  Hi, I'm Pamela.
L:  How are you? 
R:  Boy, wh- -- I'm good.  Boy, what an issue.
L:  I know.  Um, [LAUGH] --
R:  Have you done this before? 
L:  Yes.  As a matter of fact I think I was only scheduled for three of them.  This is I think --
R:  Yeah, I was too, and I'm up to seven now.
L:  Um, aren't they only supposed to do three? 
R:  Yes.
L:  This is my f- --
R:  So, I don't know what's going on.  I'm going to have to call in tomorrow or Monday.
L:  I know.  This is my fourth one, um, -- 
R:  Yeah, give the man a call.  [MN] Um, I forgot his name.  I'd have to look up the paperwork.
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  Anyways, onto the topic.
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yes, yes, yes.  What is the topic again?  Something about, um, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- illegal activities in business.
R:  Yes, and -- 
L:  How -- how the government's supposed to control them better.
R:  Yes, and how it has affected the stock market and ourselves.
L:  Well, how can the government better control them?  I g- -- how can they better monitor them?  I mean, we don't want a big brother situation, do we?  [PAUSE] 
R:  There's -- I don't mind accountability to a certain point.  But there's --
L:  But we don't want them over -- we don't want them watching over our shoulders like big brother.
R:  They're already doing that.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  They're -- [LAUGH]
R:  With satellites and so on.  I mean, give me a break.
L:  I know.  I hear you.
R:  I mean -- [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] It's the corruption -- machine will now hang up.  [NOISE]
R:  What?
L:  [MN]
R:  Hello? 
L:  Oh, oh, it's my recording machine.  I didn't pick up in time, so, I see, just ignore that.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, ah, --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- the problem is corruption is everywhere.  Ah, how are we going to get businesses to conduct themselves in an ethical manner?  I think that's the real issue.
R:  Well, actually, I think it starts back with the way people are raised.
L:  Ah, true.
R:  Morals, values, ethics.
L:  Mhm, mhm. 
R:  Character.
L:  It goes all the way right -- right into government.  I mean, even in my own little city that I live in I think there's corruption in its own little city hall.
R:  Oh, I know.  I just went to a theatre and there was five posters that were just stolen last Monday.  I mean, give me a break.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Inside the theatre and outside.
L:  Mm, I hear you.  Um, --
R:  And -- and you're talking corporate now.  I mean, -- and corporate's even more complicated.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Because you're dealing with the multi factions here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Multi levels.  You're dealing with, ah, access situations here, unauthorized access and so on.
L:  It's all about ethics and morality and, you know, [SIGH] I mean, if they're going to really cheat, just how well can they cheat?  If they're going to hide, how well can they hide?  Doesn't the government hide and cheat behind our back?  [PAUSE] 
R:  Yeah, we're not supposed to get into that subject, though.
L:  Well, isn't the subject about monitoring? 
R:  Well, it's about corporates, though, and I don't really think that we can do enough to secure ourselves or monitor ourselves.  I think it really has to do with the human person themselves --
L:  Well, --
R:  -- and how they're raised.  Um, it doesn't matter.  You got hackers, you've got -- I mean, no matter how much security you put up, someone's going to get in it.  It's a challenge.
L:  I agree.
R:  If you deal with a person individually on how they're raised -- it's like my husband said.  My husband got fired, ah, a couple years ago and he said -- and he was management, and he goes, "You know, I train my people to be better than I am.  What does that tell you?"
L:  I don't know.  I'm listening.  That --
R:  Well, if you consider that if you're a manager [MN] and you want the best for the people that are under you and you're willing to sacrifice yourself -- he f- -- got -- was fired because he would not fire someone else.
L:  Mm.
R:  Because there was a pet peeve between upper management about him and this person, and they were finding any way to axe him, and -- and my husband stepped in and said, "No".
L:  Mm.
R:  Just like --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- that.  Did it several times, and they didn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like it.  And so they --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- fired him and told him that he wasn't -- he wasn't supporting the corporate unity.  And so -- 
L:  Well --
R:  -- in Washington you don't have to have a reason to fire.
L:  Hm. 
R:  But, see, --
L:  That's terrible.
R:  -- that gets you right there.  I mean, our companies are just as corrupt.  It's a buck, and it comes down to just a buck.  [PAUSE] So, --
L:  Yes, you're right.
R:  -- people --
L:  You're right, absolutely right.
R:  I mean, let's get -- I mean, you might as well get to the root of the problem, not what the symptoms of it.  Corruption is the symptoms, right?
L:  Absolutely.
R:  So, how do you affect it?  You've got to start small.
L:  [MN] Right.  It all starts at the beginning, doesn't it? 
R:  Yeah, it really does.  I don't care how you look at it, it really does.  And it doesn't matter what raise -- what situation you're in, morals, character, ethics, all these things are taught.
L:  Mhm.  I have a friend who has a s- -- ah, a son who's I think in grade seven, and he was raising -- 
R:  I have one in eight.
L:  Oh.
R:  A daughter.
L:  Well, he was raising marijuana in --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- his bedroom so that he can buy a four thousand dollar laptop.  First of all, why does he even need a four thousand dollar laptop, is the question, and, ah, there are better ways to raise money than to grow marijuana to sell it.
R:  Yeah, but if you had a good relationship with your child I would think you would know --
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  -- they were doing that. 
L:  His -- his mother had no idea --
R:  There's -- there's --
L:  -- till he started to sell it.
R:  See, and there you go --
L:  And that's how the corruption starts.
R:  -- from generations -- yeah, and it goes from generation to generation, and it -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and that's how it is effect.  We can't get any better if we don't start at the beginning.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Our family unit.  But then I'm dealing religiously also in the sense of I'm a non-denominational, um, believer and, ah, I -- I really feel we have to take some of the responsibility ourselves.  We can't keep [inaudible] it off on our parents and -- and everyone else.  Yes, so what I had a bad, rough background.  So, I've had rough times.  That doesn't give me any excuse.  Am I willing to change?
L:  [MN]
R:  I have that choice.
L:  Well, change is hard, though.  You have to work at it, but -- 
R:  You have to want to.
L:  Oh, yes, that's right.
R:  Like you want --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- an ice cream cone.
L:  Mhm, mhm. 
R:  Like you want to go to the movies.
L:  Mhm [MN].
R:  It's the same thing.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  It really is.
L:  And it requires a lot of work, too.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I'm not saying it doesn't.  But, if you really want something, doesn't it always? 
L:  Always, absolutely.  Nothing is free.
R:  So, how -- 
L:  You have to put --
R:  -- do we change?
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, --
L:  You've got to put the work in and the effort.
R:  But how do we stop corporate co- corruption and so on?
L:  Well, first of all, we have to have a public awareness of it.  We've got to be aware of it and start at the beginning, the root of it, [MN] early on in childhood, in --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- our upbringing.
R:  And how it affects and how it's a rippling effect.
L:  That's right, from generation to generation to generation.
R:  Or even within the company itself, and the people and their families and their family's family and so on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, when there's stress in your job, someone's stressed, you feel it.
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  You know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And if you're on the edge or whatever or you're corrupt or get tempted, [PAUSE] you can leeway that way if you don't have good grounded upbringing.
L:  I just don't know how the government is going to better monitor this, though.
R:  I really --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- don't think they can.
L:  [SIGH] Well, -- 
R:  I think they've gone so far as it is now between the cameras and -- I mean, I'm a mystery shopper.  So, --
L:  A mystery shopper?  What is that? 
R:  A mystery shopper is someone that goes around and is hired by the company.
L:  Oh, oh, okay.  A competitive shopper, you mean?
R:  No, mystery shopper.  We're anonymous.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We're -- we're hired by the corporate companies. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And we go and -- like tomorrow I do an interview with, um, one of the managers at an apartment complex.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she doesn't know I'm doing that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But that's what I'm doing.  And I'm assessing certain things that she should be pointing out.
L:  Oh, --
R:  And, ah, --
L:  -- that's interesting.
R:  -- it's the same with this movie -- with the Paramount movie picture place that I went to, and I work for Paramount.  I work for about two hundred places, but anyways.  [MN] Um, I'm an independent contractor.
L:  [MN]
R:  But anyhow, um, that is monitoring.  [PAUSE]
L:  Well, --
R:  But --
L:  -- perhaps the government can have small staff assigned to many companies, I don't know.  Really, it's just -- it's a matter --
R:  Unless they're corrupt. 
L:  It's true, isn't it?  [LAUGH] 
R:  See, now --
