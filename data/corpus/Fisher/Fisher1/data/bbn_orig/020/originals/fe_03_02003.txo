L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  I couldn't understand what the subject was. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I didn't -- I didn't really understand it, either.  I think it was, uh -- 
R:  Something about the government, which is a [LAUGH] -- which -- which is a thirty minute topic anyway. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it -- it was sort of like what the government with Enron and all that was doing.
R:  Oh.  Oh.  I don't -- I don't -- 
L:  And how -- how it has affected you.  By the way, my name is John.
R:  John, I'm Rose.
L:  Hi, Rose.
R:  Um, I -- I don't know that it has affected me, except for the fact that it just irritates me that the government is so crooked [LAUGH] and I think they've got a lot to do with that Enron thing.
L:  So do I.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- I believe that -- I believe in -- in [COUGH] whether it be a little form or a big form it's affected everybody because now you don't know if the money you're putting in your 401K is safe -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- or, you know, so on and so forth.  You just don't know any more.
R:  That's right.  Yeah.
L:  And you just [COUGH] -- it's probably put a damper on a lot of people raising their 401K -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it -- it's just ridiculous and there's people on higher official government that have done the same thing.
R:  Yes, and they were involved in this, I believe.
L:  Yes.
R:  I understand that some of the friends are friends of the people of the higher -- [MN] about as high as you can go were involved in that and so I'm sure that the -- the -- the major leaders were, too.
L:  Well, [COUGH] you just got to, uh, I don't know, you just got to -- do you have to grin and bear it or -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- what do you do?
R:  It's al- -- it's almost like you do because you -- you vote them in there, so you're responsible anyway and then, uh -- and then you're not happy with them.  I didn't vote this guy in of course, but that's still -- 
L:  Well -- 
R:  -- it's just -- it's a political thing.
L:  Neither did I and -- and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  That's another -- that's another hour [inaudible] commentary there, but -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I did a write in. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, there you go.
R:  Yeah, I -- I wrote in.  Who did I write?  Ron Paul.
L:  Okay.
R:  Mm, so -- 
L:  Well, I -- I voted for the other participant and, uh -- 
R:  Oh, did you?
L:  -- ob- obviously that didn't work. but, uh -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [COUGH] I mean, you just don't know in today's government what's going to happen.
R:  No.
L:  I mean it wasn't just Enron, it was -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a couple of the other ones and -- 
R:  There's --
L:  -- and you just don't know and then you also don't know whether it's -- even if it is not 401K, you know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like the place I work at has stock options.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Will I take that too? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you don't know.
R:  No.
L:  I mean, [LAUGH] look at Martha Stewart.
R:  R- right.  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  I mean, what do you know?  
R:  And -- and you know that she -- 
L:  You don't know a damn thing.
R:  Yeah, and she's not the only one that's, uh, guilty of that, either, so ...  
L:  No, but it just seems like she walked away scot free.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And why is that?
R:  I, well, [LAUGH] I -- 
L:  Is that because she -- because she owns Kmart?
R:  Probably.  
L:  I mean, you know -- 
R:  Got big bucks.  Big bucks controls everything just about, I guess.
L:  Yeah.  It -- it's just -- it's just ridiculous to the point where you don't know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what the hell is going to happen next.
R:  Yeah.  And you don't want to invest, you don't even want to do the stock market, you don't want to do nothing.  Y- you never know if you're going to -- going to just completely lose your money or -- or, uh -- it's -- I don't know, it just seems like everything is crooked and it shouldn't be that way.
L:  No.  No, it shouldn't, but, I mean, [MN] if -- if you look at all your government -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what are they?  They are [several inaudible words].
R:  Huh? 
L:  They're [several inaudible words].
R:  They're what?
L:  [several inaudible words], acts of lawyers.
R:  Oh, yes.  Yeah, right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So if anybody knows ins -- ins and outs and loopholes and everything else like that, well, there you go.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  There's your answer.
R:  Yeah, and politic- politics is, uh, politics -- I, uh, I had somebody that just studied politics one time and they said if -- if they had to do what -- what politics expected of you, they would never be a top politician.  I think this guy was going to be a politician, he was real interested in doing that, and I think he wound up as a fisherman. [LAUGH]
L:  As a fisherman?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I guess -- I guess -- I guess it wasn't that interesting then.  I don't know.
R:  Right.  He says it was just too crooked, that even -- even the text books teach you how to do things that are not right.  I've never read them, so I don't know, but, uh, [MN] it seems like this wasn't anybody I knew, this was somebody on television.
L:  Right.  Right.  Exactly, and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it -- it -- it happened there for a while where higher officials in our government were involved -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- but you don't hear nothing about that.
R:  Oh, no.  No.
L:  You're going to hear about Enron, you're going to hear about, uh -- I -- I -- I forget the other -- there was two other major ones.
R:  I'm trying to think of who they were and I -- 
L:  I know one was a cable company.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and that's a- -- that's another rep[?].
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  I mean, and -- and the government has got their hands in there, too, for surcharges and taxes and everything else like that.
R:  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I mean, you know, it ain't never going to stop, it's only going to get worse, but then when do you feel safe?  You don't.
R:  Yeah.  I just don't -- I don't know where it's going, I just don't know where it's going.  It seems to me like when I was a kid it wasn't this bad and I know it was.
L:  Yeah, but you just didn't hear about.
R:  That's right, [LAUGH] yeah -- 
L:  I mean -- 
R:  -- but because when I was a kid Roosevelt was, uh, there -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and he's -- he's no angel.
L:  No- none of them are.
R:  No.
L:  It's just back then they -- they kept it sort of hush hush and they didn't want you to know about it, but now -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as soon as somebody finds out and lets the cat out of the bag, so to speak -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- look out -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- because the media is all over it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and that's a good thing and then again it's a bad thing.
R:  [MN] Yeah.  I was going to say when the media puts their twist on it and you don't know if they're telling the truth.
L:  I mean if you -- if you're watching the news lately there was a couple of banks, one in New York and one here in Philadelphia -- 
R:  Aha.
L:  -- where the people were throwing their money because the bank official was embezzling money.
R:  Oh.
L:  It was like the depression days.  They were lined up outside the bank.  It's just nuts any more.
R:  Uh -- uh -- yeah, well -- well, now that -- that reminds me of one that was here down in Phoenix -- um, I'm trying to think what he did.  I can't even think of his name, but it was a big, um, a bank, uh, mess and we had to -- I mean you and I had to pay back the money.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  What -- what was his name?  Do you remember that?
L:  No, I don't remember his name.
R:  Uh, yeah, I can -- I can see him, I can see his face because he was a Phoenix politician and -- and he was -- but he was a banker and he was a well-known man and he walked on water and then he -- and then they found out this about him and it went to court and he got off scot free and the people had to make up the difference.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, well, it -- it's the taxpayer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH] It's always us.
R:  Yeah, so -- 
L:  And -- and when does it stop?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know when it stops?  
R:  [MN]
L:  When we are no longer on the face of this earth is when it stops.
R:  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, that's just -- that's just the way it is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is this your first call? 
R:  Yes, it is. 
L:  It's my first call, too. 
R:  Is it?  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't even under -- I don't understand how it's supposed to work.  I, uh -- 
L:  And neither do I because I just registered on line this morning.
R:  Oh, did you? 
L:  And it -- it said they would send over like an ID or confirmation number -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- within seventy two hours -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and we're already getting calls, so I don't know how the hell this is working.
R:  Yeah.  I got my -- I got my -- they said seventy two hours but I got mine about, uh, three hours after that.
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  So I -- I hadn't sent it out to anybody, I just -- I wanted to see what was going to happen with this first and see how it worked.
L:  Right, and, you know -- you know, I heard it on the radio and -- 
R:  Oh, did you? 
L:  Yes, and it was just something that, you know, [MN] why not, you know, you can talk to anybody about anything.
R:  Sure.  Yeah.
L:  I [inaudible] my email, I probably got something back in the mail and I don't know how it works, did they tell you specifically what you had to do after you got your email?
R:  No.
L:  Okay, so -- 
R:  No, they just said that there would be a call and it may be sooner than later and I said, "Well, I had better be sitting by the phone tonight then" because it sounded to me like it might be tonight, so ...  
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, then I guess I should check my email, but -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I just got a -- I just got home from work a little while ago -- 
R:  Mm.  Yeah.
L:  -- putting in that money to buy my extra stock in my 401K in my company, so -- 
R:  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  So it's, what, ten o'clock where you are?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah, and that -- I think that's what I put.  Of course, I even forget what I put down -- 
R:  Oh.  Oh.  I see.
L:  -- with the -- with the time periods.
R:  Yeah, I put --
L:  No, I think I put ten.
R:  Seven o'clock and right at seven it happened, so -- 
L:  Yeah, that -- that's pretty weird, huh? 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, and the computer -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- computer calls you, so [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't know if these things -- I guess they are monitoring this or -- 
R:  I guess it's -- 
L:  Whatever.  I -- I don't know how that works either.
R:  Oh, I imagine it's taped and if they're making a voice print they're -- it's taped and they, uh, they somehow read it back through a computer, but I didn't know I was going to talk -- talk to a live body.  I thought I was going to --
L:  Oh, yeah, I knew that.
R:  Oh, did you?
L:  Yeah, I knew that -- 
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  -- because, um, from what I got in the email it said that, you know, you'll be talking to somebody about -- it could be anything -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- or it could be about anything and they gave us the government question.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So hopefully we're not ruled as communists right now.
R:  Oh, yeah, right.  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [inaudible] with what we've been saying, but -- 
R:  Well, I know.  I think, though, that, uh, they know that the country is pretty well up in arms with the way things
