R:  Hi, I'm Tammy.
L:  I'm Lee.
R:  Hi.  Um, okay.  Wow, they would give us a tough topic. [LAUGH] um, I think that as far as any of the illegal stuff goes on, um, I believe that doing the under cover stuff is the best way to handle it.
L:  I -- I can't hear you.
R:  I'm sorry.  Is this better?
L:  Yeah, now it's better.
R:  Okay.  I -- I -- I believe in, um, putting people in under cover for -- for that type of stuff to -- to try to find out what's going on illegal and then, um, that would probably be the bet- better way to stop it.
L:  You mean in corporate scandal?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Aha.
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  Yeah, that's one day -- one way to do it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, uh, another way is to, um, well, like, what they are doing now is just, you know, post stricter, um, laws govern- governing financial-- 
R:  [inaudible] but people break laws.
L:  Everybody breaks laws.  Um --
R:  Yeah, you gotta try to do the sneaky stuff.  I always believe in doing it sneaky.  Um, trying to do something outright means that you are giving people a heads up of what's going on and when they know what's going on and they find ways to get around it, but if you're sneaky and they don't know what's going on, then I think you'll get more accomplished.
L:  Or they catch them in the act.  Um --
R:  Yeah, but -- I mean let's say they s- -- um -- [MN] 
L:  But what hap- -- what happens if you catch them in the act after they already embezzle and spent the money?
R:  Okay.  Well, if I was -- well -- 
L:  Like Kenneth Lay from Enron.  I mean, all that money is gone.
R:  Oh, I didn't follow that scandal that much.  I don't even really realize what went on with that.  He, oh, he ended up -- 
L:  Well, Enron what happens, they, um, you know, they told all the employees to, um, you know, hold on or sell the stock and then the employees listened and got misled and stock became worthless and they lost all their retirement.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, you know, then the company went bankrupt but right before that action took place all the top executives, including this Kenneth Lay guy, took their millions when the stock was high and ran away.
R:  Ooh.
L:  Well, you know, took the money and, um, ran. 
R:  And all the money is gone?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, being now the company is bankrupt now there is no money for the employees' retirement plans because [MN] -- 
R:  But didn't they have insurance or something that would cover it?
L:  [inaudible] bankrupt.  Uh -- uh, that's a good question.  I forgot what happened, um, you know, I wonder why insurance -- 
R:  Yeah, [several inaudible words] like when you are in a business like that you should always get some type of insurance to protect yourself in case anything, um -- 
L:  Well, I think it had to do with the value of the stock, like you -- you can't insure a value of stock.  Otherwise --
R:  Well, that's the gamble you take when you buy stock.  Like I -- I own General Motors stocks.  Sometimes it goes up, sometimes it goes down.  That's just, you know, the gamble I'm going to take.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I'm willing to buy more stock in other companies and that's on me if it falls.
L:  Yeah, see that's -- 
R:  You know, I mean you take a chance.
L:  -- the thing.  This was employee stock to build up their -- I'm sorry, [MN] I said retirement plan [inaudible] I meant profit sharing plan.
R:  Right.
L:  And it kept growing over and then the employees got tricked and misled and then their -- 
R:  Yeah.  Well, nobody forced them to buy it, though. 
L:  -- accumulated savings became worthless, right, that's why yeah, there's no insurance, it's just stock, uh, plan, not a pension plan.
R:  Okay, so how do you think they should have handled it, then?  Like [MN] to keep that from happening?
L:  Um, well, trying to keep the top executives more -- held more accountable, um -- 
R:  They are.  Aren't they going to [inaudible], I guess, aren't they?
L:  Well, yeah, they -- I thought they came up with some new laws, um, but -- or maybe they should require mo- -- h- here's one.  Maybe they wish -- they should require more, you know, quarterly audits by the government.
R:  Do they do background checks before they hire these people?
L:  Um, some companies do, but even so, um, you know, audits are not necessarily required, um -- well, actually, see Enron got audited by a big four firm because the auditors lied. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, hm, okay.
L:  You know, that was part of the big scandal.  No, they should just have government auditors, like, go in periodically.
R:  Were any women involved in it?
L:  Um, no.
R:  You see that's the problem.  Now, if we have women involved in these -- 
L:  Well, no, no, I mean no -- no woman was found guilty.
R:  Because women don't lie.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, there's your problem right there.  You know, we need more women in charge of companies and maybe running the country and stuff like that and then things will be smoother. 
L:  Well, that's another, you know, topic for discussion.
R:  [LAUGH] There's your solution right there.  No, I mean I -- I think that, um, you know, like i- if you, you know, the under cover thing to me, that's the easiest way, I think.  If it's cheap, you don't have to worry about whether you're doing any, you know, um, security monitoring or anything like that, [MN] you know, and all that auditing.  That all costs a lot of money but if you sent just somebody -- 
L:  No, actually, it is cheaper to have the audit than to have a full-time under cover person.
R:  How do you say [inaudible]?
L:  Um -- 
R:  It can't be.
L:  Well, yeah.  I mean, you say [several inaudible words] someone under cover.
R:  Yeah, you don't got to pay them like a million dollars to go into a company and figure out what's going on.
L:  No, but you got to pay them a hundred thousand to work and be there eight hours a day.
R:  Not a hundred thousand and -- and what if it was part-time or you could have somebody pretend to be an intern learning or something like that and they don't have to be there all the time, they just go in every now and then, but to constantly monitor something. 
L:  Yeah, but it achieves nothing.  It takes, you know, a few months or maybe a few years for fraud to develop.
R:  Oh, it does? 
L:  Yeah.  Um, well, depending on the size of the company, like, it only takes a minute for someone to steal money out of the petty cash draw -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or something like that, but to uncover millions in a huge company that's been hidden like a paper trail, that takes months of investigation or research.
R:  Mm.  Okay, so what do you think?
L:  Um, [MN] I don't know.  I mean, um -- no, well, I tell you what I think, you know, just have more required government audits because, well, you know, my experience is that when you have government auditors looking over the financial books of the company, I mean they're almost as bad as the IRS knocking on the door of your house.
R:  Right, okay. 
L:  Um -- 
R:  Yeah, but people get over on the IRS all the time.
L:  They get what?  
R:  They get over on them.  They -- they lie and cheat the IRS easily.
L:  Well, um, I -- I don't know if it's that easy, um -- 
R:  I know people that have done it.  They write -- they'll write off anything and they get away with it, people that own businesses.  I've had people tell me what they do.
L:  Oh, yeah, no.  Okay, let's put it this way.  Yeah, it's easy to cheat on your tax return but the minute they start questioning your tax return and audit your return, I mean, um, then you're dead.
R:  If you're consistent, then you don't got to worry about that, getting caught.
L:  Y- you know, unless you have very good, you know, uh, records but, um, y- yeah, I'm just speaking from my minimal experience that, you know, government auditors are not pleasant people to deal with and with a company they'll just keep digging and digging and digging.
R:  Okay, so if somebody gets caught doing something like that, what kind of punishment do you think?
L:  Well, I mean, now they're imposing -- I thought George Bush was imposing harsher penalties, like, some accounting managers, um, I think have been sentenced to five years in prison.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um -- 
R:  But do you think that that punishment is, um, got to be equal to somebody that, you know, killed somebody or raped somebody or a chronic thief like robbing banks, armed robbery, something like that?  I -- I just don't feel -- 
L:  Yeah, that's the thing.  I -- 
R:  -- those -- those same type of people belong in jail with like hard criminals.
L:  Yeah, I mean I can't equate white collar crime with, you know, the mass murderers, um, I mean you're -- you're right about that, but, no, I mean, but -- 
R:  No, I mean you think five years in -- I think one year in jail is bad enough, I mean, you know -- 
L:  Well, not -- not for a top executive that embezzled two to ten million dollars.  He would laugh and say, "Go ahead, put me in jail and give me a book to read".  You know what I'm saying?  I mean if someone gave you ten million dollars you'd sit in jail.
R:  Yeah, I guess.  I'd be, I think -- I think, uh, when you give somebody community service, like make them do work for free, that kind of -- I think that's a better type of a punishment.
L:  Well, yeah, of course, um, and also if they give all the money back, the ten million, um -- 
R:  If they have it, still. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, well, I guess it --
