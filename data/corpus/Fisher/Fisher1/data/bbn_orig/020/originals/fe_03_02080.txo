R:  Hi, I'm Rebecca.
L:  Hi, my name is Karen.  I'm in Texas.  Where are you?
R:  I'm in Tennessee.
L:  Tennessee?
R:  Yes, ma'am.
L:  I've visited there.
R:  [LAUGH] It's a beautiful state.
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  What kinda activities -- do you like going hunting or fishing?
L:  Do I like hunting and fishing?  No, I can't say that I do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm not a very outdoorsy person.
R:  Ooh.
L:  [LAUGH] Do you -- do you enjoy the outdoors?
R:  Yes, ma'am.  [LAUGH] I sure do.
L:  Ah.  I've done some, uh ... I do a lot of gardening and that's about the extent of my outdoor activity.  I've done some rock climbing, but no one in my family is a hunter or a fisherman.
R:  Hm.  [LIPSMACK] Well, I don't -- I can garden but I'm not a good gardener, I don't have the green thumb. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I've been blessed with a green thumb, although I bought some plants this year that haven't done very well but my tomatoes are looking very good.
R:  [NOISE] We had a -- 
L:  I hear children.
R:  Oh, yeah, I have two.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I have grandchildren. [LAUGH]
R:  Ooh.  I don't even wanna know about them days. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, do you like going swimming ... and walking?
L:  Uh, yes, I do walk.  I walk everyday and, um, I think I'll be walking for a while, at least I hope so.  My mother is eighty four ... and she walks four miles a day.
R:  Goodness.
L:  I can't brag on the same distance.  I do about a mile a day.  Do you walk?
R:  Um, every once in a while I do.  I don't do it on an everyday +basis -- +basis.
L:  Well, with children, it's hard to do anything on an everyday basis -- basis except take care of them.
R:  Well, I usually put the baby in the stroller and my daughter's usually in school so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that is good to wa- if you have ... if you can take a baby out to walk.  It motivates you.
R:  Oh, he loves the outside.
L:  Hm.
R:  He sneaks out the door so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no!
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] How old is he?
R:  He's sixteen months.
L:  Oh, that's so cute.  Yeah.
R:  The outdoors is our ... thing.  We go camping in the summer and ... [LIPSMACK] we usually go about three or four times during the summer.
L:  Oh, that's really good.  I've never -- I've never really been camping.  The -- the extent of my camping is a -- is a cabin.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We take a tent. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I've never actually been tent camping.  I don't think I would like it.  I like, um, as a minimum, hot and cold running water. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, we usually do pretty good.  The creek that we usually go to though, it's -- whenever it's ninety or a hundred degrees, you can get in the creek and it feels like it's seventy degrees so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's really nice.  You know, that's -- I live in Austin, Texas --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and we have a spring fed creek that is a public swimming pool.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, and the water there is seventy degrees year round.
R:  Oh.  Well, ours ... I guess it pretty well stays -- it's spring fed and I guess it pretty well stays the same temperature.
L:  Right.
R:  But in the summertime, it's good to go into whenever you're hot. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it does.  And s- and -- and Texas summers can sometimes be hotter than the hinters of hell.
R:  Oh, yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  They can be miserable.  Of course, I understand y'all had a pretty warm summer last year?
R:  Yeah, we did.  We did -- we had a pretty well minimal winter.  It wasn't too bad.  [LIPSMACK] But I like the warm weather better then the cold.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I think, um -- I think I like the warm weather better than the cold myself.  I think I suffer more than the heat from the cold though.  But I've never been in really, really cold weather.  I mean, we ... we have, um -- we have snow about every four or five years and when I say snow, I mean, we have snowflakes that fall but it never covers the sidewalk.
R:  Oh, I'm originally from Michigan so I know the cold weather.  [LAUGH]
L:  Ooh, you really do.
R:  Yes and the weather from up there and down here is very different. [LAUGH]
L:  And from where you are to where I am it's probably even that much different again.
R:  Probably.
L:  Yeah.  Now, I don't think I could take really, really cold weather.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I just wouldn't -- well, in the first place, I wouldn't know how to -- I wouldn't know how to handle myself.  I wouldn't know how to, um ... to navigate.  We can't drive in the ice and snow because we never have.
R:  Yeah, and that's the way people are around here whenever we get a snow, they're at the grocery store buying everything.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  So ... [LAUGH]
L:  And, uh [LIPSMACK] so it -- I -- I'd be dangerous if I were out and as a matter of fact, when I have vacationed where there is snow, I can hardly walk.  I don't know how to stay up on it, you know?
R:  Yep.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I understand.
L:  I keep wishing I had cleats in my shoes so I wouldn't slip.
R:  Oh ... [LIPSMACK] I don't know if that would help you here or not.  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't -- I've seen, uh [MN] ... I've seen rubber band things that you put over your shoes and the bottom of 'em have like, uh ... well, they look almost like cleats but they're little razor blade, sort of points.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So that ... your weight digs them into the ice.
R:  Huh.
L:  Supposedly.  I don't know if they work or not because I've never ... tried them --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but it looks like it would keep you from slipping.
R:  I don't know.  I've never ... tried 'em or I've never seem 'em. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Maybe they just sell 'em to southerners.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It'd be something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You -- do you keep your grandchildren?
L:  Sometimes I do.  Uh, but I work and so ... unless it's some sort of real emergency or unless it's a holiday, I don't usually keep them.
R:  Oh, you guys would ... play games or somethi-
L:  And besides that, they're getting up pretty big now.  They're about -- they're fourteen and twelve.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, they don't need much keeping.
R:  They're pretty well dependent on their own self.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  So, I don't -- I don't sit with them very much.  I used to sit with them when they were ... you know, toddlers, but now they don't need me.
R:  Hm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And my mother lives with them ... and so ... they have a sort of built in babysitter.
R:  Yeah.  We got playing -- or did you used to like playing volleyball or badminton?
L:  Yes, I did.  As a girl I played a lot of badminton and I played some volleyball but not ... a -- not a whole lot but a -- a good bit.  I lived -- I was raised, uh -- I live -- Austin is in central Texas but when I was a girl when -- I was raised at the coast.
R:  Oh.
L:  On the Gulf coast and so we used to play beach volleyball -- volleyball a lot.
R:  Yeah, volleyball's a lot of fun -- ah, it's a lot of fun to play.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You can get a lot of exercise from it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, we used to play at the beach and the sand is good.  We used to play barefooted.  It was before there were -- there was any fear from needles and things like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, the sand was really good for your feet.  It polished 'em.
R:  Well, we usually play out in our front yard and it's grass so we usually -- I usually kick my shoes off and play without any shoes on.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, that's good.  You must have a large yard.
R:  We have a pretty big yard.
L:  Yeah --
R:  My husband --
L:  -- well, it sounds like you guys do a lot of activities outside.
R:  We do.  My husband, he works outside because he -- he's an outdoorsman anyways.
L:  What does he do?
R:  Uh, he lays asphalt.
L:  Oh.
R:  Works for an asphalt company ... so, he's outdoors in hot, hot weather.  [LAUGH] [COUGH]
L:  So, is asphalt as expensive ... as concrete or less?
R:  Uh ... I think asphalt's more expensive than concrete is.
L:  More expensive?
R:  Yep.
L:  That's amazing.
R:  Yes, it is.  [LAUGH]
L:  I always thought that it was less expensive and somebody told me a couple of years ago that they were about ... the same price and I was shocked so I was -- that's why I was checking with you just to find out if the information I had was true.
R:  I think concrete's a lot less expensive.
L:  Wh-
R:  I think asphalt's more.  It costs more, uh, 'cause all the work that you had to put in to the asphalt.
L:  Oh.
R:  'Cause you have to ... remember you put it down, you have the paver that goes over it, then you have rollers that go over it, to give -- get it level and ...
L:  Right, and so the only bad thing about it is that ... diesel fuel will ruin it.  Is that right?
R:  No, they use diesel on it.
L:  They do?
R:  Uh-huh.  The smell --
L:  Well, somebody told me if you had a diesel spill on it, it would hurt it.
R:  It may make it weak.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, see, they use ... they use it and they have to keep watering the rollers to keep the asphalt ... from sticking to the rollers.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  So, it's pretty cool.  [LAUGH] I try to learn what I can.  [LAUGH]
L:  Pretty hot work in the summer, I bet.
R:  Yes, ma'am, it is.  He usually comes in and he's hot and ... tired.
L:  I'll bet.  Oh, yeah.
R:  I don't guess he gets enough of the outdoors.
L:  Hm.
R:  Whenever it rains he usually finds something to do in the house; either watch movies or play on the computer or play games.  [MN] About all we can do whenever it rains.
L:  So, how many of these calls have you made?
R:  Uh --
