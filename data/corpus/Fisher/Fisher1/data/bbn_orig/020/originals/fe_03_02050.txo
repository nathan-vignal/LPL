R:  Hello.
L:  Hello. [LAUGH] 
R:  Hi, I'm Tania.
L:  I'm Dana[?].  [LAUGH]
R:  Where are you at?
L:  I'm in Maryland.
R:  Oh, I am too.  Where are you at?
L:  I'm in Elkridge.
R:  Elkridge.
L:  Do you know where that -- like Columbia, Ellicott City.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Frederick County.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  So we are a little -- a little bit far away but not too far.  That's kind of neat.
L:  So, let's see, what are we supposed --
R:  So -- 
L:  -- to talk about?
R:  Outdoor activities.  Did you hear what they said?
L:  Let's see, it was: do you like cold or warm weather activities --  
R:  Well, --
L:  -- outdoor or indoor.
R:  [LAUGH] -- today, I -- I usually like spring soccer, and we were at my son's game.  Of course it was raining.  Wasn't too cold, so that wasn't too bad, but the raining part isn't --
L:  Yeah, that's not fun.
R:  -- very good.  They were, like, falling all over the field, so ...  I -- I --
L:  Are they little?
R:  -- definite- -- well, U ten.
L:  Okay.
R:  But, yeah, they're still falling all over the field [LAUGH], so -- but at least it wasn't freezing, because it has been cold.  I definitely don't like cold sports. [LAUGH]
L:  You don't like, like, skiing or?
R:  I've only been skiing once and, ah, -- and I didn't have any lessons -- 
L:  Mm, you have to have a less- --  
R:  -- I kind of, you know, -- the only way I knew how to stop was to fall down -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- so I got really -- I -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I kept falling on the same side.  I didn't think about falling on the other side.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I actually -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  Um, this is so funny having this conversation.  I mean, [MN] I actually am not very, like, out-- active -- I'm not very active any more.  I kind of, you know, whatever.  But, um, I grew up in Michigan and, I mean, we used to go, like, ice skating and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I mean, it's not fun if you're bundled up and -- and I mean skiing [MN] -- more like cross country skiing and downhill skiing a few times.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Um, I think downhill skiing could be a lot of fun.  It -- it's actually something -- [MN] if you have a lesson, I mean, you can learn enough in one or two lessons to ha- -- I mean, you can learn enough in one lesson to ha- -- at least have fun.
R:  Right.
L:  You're not going to be any good, but at least you can do it.  Um, --  
R:  I think I just -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE], um, for -- [MN] because it has to do with weather, the question, -- 
L:  Yep. 
R:  -- um, I think that's the thing, I don't really cold weather that much.
L:  Yeah, I don't --
R:  So that's probably why I don't like those things.
L:  I don't really like cold weather very much.
R:  [LAUGH]  But, yeah, -- 
L:  I'd rather, like --
R:  -- I do like ice skating.  I did that before, and I -- I do like that.
L:  But you can do that indoors too. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's true, because they have ice skating rinks all around now.  So ... 
L:  So, okay, we like indoor ice skating. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] really, but, um, yeah, -- but, I mean, think -- think about all the activities.  I mean, volleyball, softball, um, --
L:  Yeah, [MN] --  
R:  I don't play soccer, but I like tennis --
L:  I consider shopping an indoor activity.  I like doing that. [LAUGH] 
R:  Shopping.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, 'cause they didn't say it had to be sports.  I was -- 
L:  That's true.
R:  I was -- I was just thinking -- 
L:  Indoor activities -- 
R:  But, um, --
L:  -- let's see: [MN] shopping, working --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- playing on the computer.
R:  Oh, yeah, working, I don't like that.  [LAUGH]
L:  I like it most of the time.
R:  [LAUGH] Depends on what it is, I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I definitely like, like, warm weather because -- I like, ah, even like gardening --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now that the weather has been starting to warm up, it just -- it puts me in a much better mood and -- 
L:  Yeah, I like, like, sightseeing.  Like, we take the kids places, like down -- like, you know, down to the harbour and that kind of --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- stuff and, like, -- I like -- [MN] yeah, so I like, like, spring --
R:  It's just easier in the warmer weather because you don't have to have all these coats -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you don't -- driving.  You know -- 
L:  Plus in Maryland -- 
R:  -- you don't have to worry about it --
L:  In Maryland it's just miserable when it's cold.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's like -- [inaudible] I mean, growing up in Michigan when it's cold it's, like, dry and cold and they have --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  -- ploughs.  Here it's just wet and cold and miserable and icy and -- [MN] 
R:  Oh, that's interesting, 'cause, see, --  
L:  Here it's different.
R:  -- I've never been to Michigan, obviously, but I would think it would be colder there, but I guess --
L:  It's colder but it's, like, -- here it's just wet and miserable.
R:  Mm.
L:  There it's, like, dry and the sun shines off the snow.  Plus when you live there you spend the money on having really warm coats [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and boots.  I mean, and -- and all that.  An- -- I mean, here it's like, you know, you are sort of really not that prepared and --
R:  And I think the last couple -- well, I've lived my whole life here, and we used to have -- pretty much every winter it would be kind of like it was this past winter, and the last few years we have really got it easy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I -- I don't know when you moved here.
L:  I -- I've been here a long time.  I've been here -- 
R:  You have, okay; 'cause I -- I know that in the last few years, um, -- I live in a newer development and people that have moved here recently, you know, and they think, "Oh, it's not that bad," and then it's like, "Well, this is not normal".
L:  This isn't normal.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  No, no, no.  It's -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- like the year before last was, " [inaudible] where is it?"
R:  I had gotten a four wheel drive a few years ago -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and I never had to use it until this year, finally.  [LAUGH] It was like --
L:  I do like sledding outside.  I have a five year old -- or actually six now.
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  Um, [MN] so -- I mean, I like doing that kind of stuff, like playing in the snow with the kids for --
R:  No, see a- again, I can't -- I mean, I would like to, but [MN] I go out for a little bit and [MN] for the all the trouble it takes -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- for me to get --
L:  To get bundled up.
R:  -- three pairs of socks on and all the stuff, and then I'm cold and then I want to come in.  I was like that when I was a kid too.  I would stay outside with my neighbour because she was my only friend that was nearby and so, you know, we would play together but I would always be like, "Can't we go in?  Can't we go in?" and she would be like, "No, let's play".  I'm like, "I want to go in and have hot chocolate".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I just never liked the cold weather.  But, um, yeah, my kids are out there --
L:  I don't think I'd ever take a vacation somewhere cold.
R:  No.
L:  I mean, a vacation would definitely be somewhere like at least, if not hot, um, you know, at -- at least like, you know, spring like so you --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- could go, you know, -- go see whatever there is to -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- see and do stuff and --  
R:  I mean, I wouldn't -- I guess I wouldn't want to be, like, melting away, like horr- horribly hot, like -- like Key West.  We went to Key West.  We've been there a couple times, um, but we happened to go in June one year where we had a different -- we were supposed -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to go to San Francisco, and the -- and the -- 
L:  Mm. 
R:  -- my -- my husband had a seminar out there and things changed.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So we --
L:  I went to San Francisco last June.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Yeah, we thought it was going to be warm.  Like, what idiots. [LAUGH] 
R:  It's supposed to be cool because it's on --
L:  It is.
R:  -- the water. 
L:  Yeah, and it [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah.  But I thought, "Well, that'd be a nice trip in the end of June 'cause --" 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even if it's a little cool that'd be nice," but then, you know, his seminar --"
L:  Key West would be --
R:  -- got cancelled, so we thought --
L:  -- miserable.
R:  -- "Well, it's too expensive to fly all the way out there," so we thought, "Well, we'll go somewhere, so we'll go to Key West again because we like it so much".  Oh, my gosh, it was so hot there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we didn't want to do anything, I mean even not doing activity outdoors, even just, you know, ah, -- 
L:  Laying around, ordering a drink.
R:  -- getting on the little tram and just driving.  I mean, we would take a shower and everything.  Even in the evening, by the time we would go out i- -- you know, our make up would be, like, melting off my face --
L:  Yes.  You can't go places like that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- in June.  [LAUGH] That's why it's cheap. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's why it's cheap in June.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, but going there in, like, March or April it's really nice --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause you -- you know, it's warm --
L:  Yeah, no, no, no, it's --
R:  -- it's like summer.
L:  -- supposed to be like one of those places people go and then they never leave.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like a little tropical paradise.
R:  Yeah.  It's --
L:  I've never been -- I haven't been down there.
R:  It's really +friendly -- friendly, and it is like that.  It's like a Jimmy Buffett place, you know.
L:  Yeah, it's like --
R:  But we are not talking about activities, so we are going to get in trouble. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  What happens if we don't talk about the right thing?  Um, --
R:  But -- I don't know.  Is this the first time you've done this or?
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- 
R:  Oh, is it?  Okay. 
L:  And, actually, last time the thing called my husband hung up on it 'cause he was like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- "What's this junk?" and I was --  
R:  Oh, no.  
L:  -- , you know, -- [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I, um, -- I got my first call the other day and we talked about -- it was: what does family mean to you.
L:  [MN]
R:  So these topics are kind of hard, and I don't know exactly, you know, what we are suppose- -- I know --  
L:  I guess unless you're really --
R:  -- we are supposed to be talking about activities, but --
L:  -- I mean, this is sort of like a weird topic, like: do you like warm or cold, hot or -- I mean, okay, we can talk about we hate cold, we like wa- --
R:  Warm or cold activities.  I mean, we are --
L:  Warm or cold activities --
R:  -- talking about the temperature.
L:  -- in or -- yeah, in or out.
R:  But if I could do --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- well, let's say skiing, for instance, you -- I don't know, it probably isn't the same.  Snow skiing and water skiing.  It's not just the temperature because they are actually two different --
L:  They are entirely different.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Water skiing -- I mean, [MN] water skiing I've done, like, when I was a kid but -- and that's it.
R:  I never did it because I could never see.  My eyes were always so bad, and now I had the laser surgery so I need --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to do it some time, but I haven't done it yet, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  It's fun.  I- -- it's -- I mean, again it's something I haven't done in years, um, but it actually is a lot of fun and it -- it's another thing that if you are at all coordinated, um, -- I mean, I -- I'm not very good with, like, hand eye coordination, like catching, like, balls and hitting them and stuff, but --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like, but as far as things like with my, you know, -- like that kind of thing, like, with my legs and that kind of stuff I can, you know, I -- I -- I can [MN] -- I was always able to, like, stay up and, I mean, it doesn't take that much to then get more advanced, you know.  You can -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You can definitely after doing it -- you know, do it a couple times you can again do enough to have fun and then you can get a little more advanced where you are, like, you know, crossing over the wake and then you get to the point -- 
R:  But wouldn't you say that's a lot different than snow skiing? 
L:  Way different.
R:  Okay. 
L:  [NOISE] But maybe the set of, um, balance type skills, like [inaudible] I guess --  
R:  Okay.
L:  I mean, like, my legs -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I used to run.  I mean, my legs are s- -- [MN] again, I -- I don't do, like, baseball and, you know, --
R:  Right.
L:  Um, my legs are always strong and -- and, you know, I have a good sense of balance, so it -- that same type of, like, you know, being able to -- to stand up on those [LAUGH] skis and --  
R:  Yeah, using -- 
L:  -- be pulled along.
R:  -- the same muscle groups, yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  It's the same kind of muscle groups and coordination, so, um, --
R:  That makes sense.
L:  -- and even we used to do cross country skiing.  God, years ago we used to do cross country skiing. 
R:  Now that, you'd have to be in --  
L:  That's easy.
R:  -- really good shape I think to do that.
L:  [SIGH] But that's [inaudible] --
R:  I would probably do a half a mile and I'd be like [NOISE] --
L:  Not really --
R:  -- burn out. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- 'cause it's not so different than doing, um, -- like I said, I was in good shape back then -- um, [MN] but that's another thing that you could do at a different -- [MN] you can learn enough in one try to get -- and then you just kind of slide along and it's only really hard if there -- if there are, like, any steep hills either up or down.  [LAUGH]
R:  So you are just sliding and all, but you are still -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- going -- I mean, you are -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- probably -- you are doing like a trip, right?  I mean, it's almost, um, -- you know, you are doing so many miles or something, right?
L:  Well, you are doing like a tr- -- we used to do -- I used to, um, [MN] give tours to kids at a nature centre, and so then we would -- they would learn -- they would get, like, a lesson in cross country skiing --
R:  Oh, that's neat.
L:  -- in the morning, and then they'd go on their skis and -- and so, no, I mean, you are just going around little tr- -- I mean, whatever you want to do.  You are not necessarily racing or -- or -- you know, you could go out in a park, in nature, you know, whatever and just ski around and just -- you know, just basically like taking a hike only you are doing it on skis.
R:  On skis, right.  Mm.
L:  So, I mean, you know, as long as you want to go, and it looks like it's hard but it's not 'cause you're -- you're sliding.  I mean, it's the same effort it takes to, let's say, walk except that you are on skis so you are going to slide.
R:  And you don't have much of a chance of falling down --
L:  No, unless you go down a hill.
R:  -- so you don't have to worry about trying to get up.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah, exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's the hard -- unless you go down a hill.  Then it, you know, --
