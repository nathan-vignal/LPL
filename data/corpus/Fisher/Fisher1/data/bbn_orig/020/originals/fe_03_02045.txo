L:  [NOISE] Hi.
R:  Hi.  I'm Pamela Anderson.
L:  Um, yes.  Can you hear me? 
R:  Yes, I can.  I'm on a --
L:  Hi.
R:  -- cell phone.
L:  Me too.  [LAUGH] That was the easiest way to be reached.  My name's Connell.
R:  Hi.  What was the question they were asking? 
L:  Well, they had, um, two sets of questions.  The first one is do you like, I believe, warm weather activities or cold weather activities, and then it said, um, do you prefer inside activities or outside activities.  So those were the two sets.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh.
L:  Which is fairly easy.
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  [MN]
R:  Let's see, I like, ah, -- what do I like?  I like both.  But, actually, I'm in Washington, so I like it kind of cooler.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, our, ah, summers are cooler.  So, I like that.
L:  Yeah, and you know what, for me it's kind of different b- -- not different, but, you know, there's -- there's so different in activities that you could do.  [NOISE] But I guess the best one for me would be year round because you can play football when it's cold, even when it's hot, and you can play basketball when it's cold or hot.  But I guess the definition is if it's snowing -- do you think that's it? 
R:  [PAUSE] Yeah, that would -- that would limit it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  You can't play tennis too well while going snowing.
L:  Exactly, unless you're -- 
R:  [several inaudible words] snowing.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you can't do that.  [LAUGH] It would be kind of slippery.  But I -- so, I would say I would like it better with, um, warm weather activities.
R:  Yeah, I agree.  But I like to ski.  We like to snowboard.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  We like the mountains.
L:  Yeah, that is fun.  [NOISE]
R:  So, we [MN] --
L:  In California you only have, like, a month or two where you could do it, really, like, when it's really -- when the sno- snow's really good, because I don't like the artificial snow that they produce.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, that's pretty bad.
R:  My brother lives down there in California.
L:  Yeah, and it's [MN] -- it's really hard here like during the, um, -- the winter seasons and stuff like that.  You have such a limited time for the snow to be there and it's like good snow rather than the slush.  [PAUSE]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] And so that's why I think I prefer the warm weather ones better.
R:  Well, Tahoe --
L:  So, --
R:  -- has some nice ones though.
L:  Yeah, they do.  Yeah, they do.  But I prefer, like, the -- the warm weather ones just like ball games and, you know, -- like right now --
R:  Scuba diving.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It's just -- it's just nice, and then you get to be outside --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but not in the dead middle of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- summer, because that's kind of painful.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I agree, [MN] air conditioning city.  So I'd like --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- between the spring or the fall time are my favorite times --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- for here in Washington.
L:  Mhm, I can imagine that.
R:  Because it's [MN] not too hot and not too cold.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And not a lot of raining.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's true, because when it's raining you can't do anything, pretty much -- 
R:  Well, actually no --
L:  -- any outdoor sports.
R:  -- not in Washington.  In Washington we pretty much do everything that we always do.
L:  During the rain also? 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  [MN] Except for gol- -- [MN] we go golfing.  We, ah, --
L:  Oh, that's true.
R:  [NOISE] We do all that stuff.
L:  You have to --
R:  And so -- [LAUGH]
L:  -- because, ah, I guess in places where it rains inconsistently you have to just kind of go through it, or else [MN] you'd be stuck.
R:  Well, you don't really notice it [MN].
L:  Really? 
R:  Yeah.  After a while it's pretty much -- it's pretty much just, ah, -- I don't know, you don't notice it [NOISE] at all.
L:  That's true.  And I guess I'm spoilt because if it's like a sprinkling I'm like, "All right, time -- time to [MN] bring the game inside.  We can't play anymore".  That's just how --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- I am.  "The floor's -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- the floor's too wet.  I'm going to slip and someone's going to get hurt."  So, -- but I like it when it's, like, you know, basically, -- like, right now in California it's sunny, but then there's a nice breeze.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I -- I think that'll be, like, the optimal time to p- -- to play any type of outdoor sports, except for of course skiing because you can't.  [LAUGH] But, um, -- so, how do you -- do you prefer indoor or outdoor sports better? 
R:  [PAUSE] Ah, my husband likes outdoor sports.  I like, ah, outdoor sports.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I agree.
L:  I think it's easier, yeah.  It's easier to do the out- out- outdoor sports, um, [NOISE] in comparison to the indoors because there's not really a lot of things that you could do indoors when you think about it.  There's not too many venues that you could actually -- unless you go to a gym that has, like, the racquetball courts and, you know, indoor pools and stuff like that.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] So, I think there's m- -- you know, you could do more things when you're outside, you know, when -- when the weather's good, even when it's cold because you have, you know, your variety of things that, you know, you could do in the winter and in the summer.  [PAUSE] I'm not really s- -- 
R:  I agree.
L:  Yeah.  I'm not really sure what else you could say, except if we talk about individual sports that we d- -- that you could do, [LAUGH] if we start listing them.  [PAUSE]
R:  That's true.  I don't know, I like bicycle riding.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know what, that's -- that's right.  That's another type of sports --
R:  And swimming.
L:  Yeah, those are two sports, and then, like, also there's hiking that you could do in --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- nice weather, [NOISE] and that burns off a lot of calories.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, it does.
L:  [NOISE] And, you know what --
R:  I'm recording this.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Well, I'm doing a --
L:  I'm im- --
R:  -- I'm doing a mystery shop right now, and you called right [MN] -- they called right in the middle of it.
L:  Oh, I'm so sorry about that.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's not your fault.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's true.  It's their fault.  I've been --
R:  Really nice, though.
L:  -- waiting for one.  [LAUGH] It is. 
R:  Oh, have you?
L:  It's nice.
R:  Is this your first one? 
L:  This phone call? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ok- --
L:  I've been waiting.
R:  Oh, I didn't know that.
L:  Yeah, I just [MN] --
R:  This is my seventh.  [LAUGH]
L:  I signed up, like, maybe a week ago and this is the first phone call.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah --
L:  So, I [MN] --
R:  -- there's a lot of them.  I'm on my seventh one now.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, I'm not quite sure what they're doing.  I'm going to have to give them a call.
L:  And see exactly what they want us to specify.
R:  Ahah.
L:  It's pretty, [MN] you know, -- [MN] you know, there's only so much that you could say about in- -- you know, pretty much indoor sports.  "Yeah, I like indoor or outdoor sports.  Ah, what do you like better, winter [LAUGH] or summer" [LAUGH] basically, and that's pretty much it.  But --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- I think --
R:  I agree.
L:  -- I think --
R:  I don't know what else you can say about it.
L:  Yeah.  I just think [inaudible] sum it up, I think that you could do more things, um, when it's, [NOISE] you know, -- with warm weather compared to cold weather, although there's [MN] both numerous things that you could do with each one.  But my, ah, preference is the warm weather, and I believe that I like outdoor sports better than I do indoor sports.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  So, if you're, ah, -- if you like the cold weather, then you like to snuggle and you like to be indoors more --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- of the time, or you like to ski, where if it's [MN] -- you like the outdoors, well, then you like the summer time and you do more outdoor things than indoor.
L:  Correct.  And then --
R:  Pretty much sums it up, doesn't it? 
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] it does.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And because -- [MN] besides, like, indoor sports, like, th- -- this is just my ideas, just that you have to have, you know, some type of money to be able to perform indoor sports where actual -- there's activity going on.  Like, for me, indoor sports, since I have kids, it's more like, um, just games and hide and go seek and stuff like that, activities --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- more than sports.  So, and it's always better to be outside.  You burn, you know, more energy that way and --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- you could relax outside.
R:  The sun feels nice.  At least it does --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- right now. 
L:  Yeah, it does.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It does.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm happy for the weather right now.  And plus --
R:  Me too.
L:  -- when you -- when you go in- -- when you're inside doing something, you just -- you know, you wind up feeling so confined because of the walls and the ceiling and -- 
R:  I think you do.  We don't.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] We're snugglers in our family.
L:  We are too, but, you know, I guess [MN] most of the time [MN] during the day it's just me and my daughter, and the only thing that we have to do are just, like, basically coloring and just indoor things, where if we're outside we can do a whole, you know, lot of other things.  So, we're -- we're not --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- too -- it's strange because if you really ask me how many times I go outside during the day, [LAUGH] it depends on what I have to do.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.  That's true.  I -- I kind of a stay at home mom more or less.  But my kids are all older, so I'm more of a run around mom now.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, goodness.  My daughter, she's, um, --
R:  But I do like --
L:  -- in --
R:  -- to drive in the -- in the sunshine more than I do the rain.  [LAUGH]
L:  It's true.  It's just -- also it's like a safety concern also, because you figure --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you don't -- there's not r- a lot of -- well, there -- of course there's -- because they didn't scratch it, but during, um, the winter time when you have to drive to places that are -- you know, that you're going to be attending sports games or anything else, and, you know, there's more of a danger involved because of the wet roads and then, when you're playing, the slippery ground, whereas the summer it's just like, "Oh, it's a nice day.  Let's go".  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.  That's true.  [PAUSE] Oh, boy.  You know, you --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- run out of things to talk about with this -- this, ah, subject.  I haven't had --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that problem with the other subjects.
L:  Really? 
R:  This is weird.
L:  What kind of -- what kind of other subjects do you --
R:  Ah, --
L:  -- usually --
R:  -- one was on Saddam Hussein and Iraq and the other one was, ah, shoot, what were they?  Um, oh, gosh.  I've done so many now I don't know which [several inaudible words]. 
L:  Well, you know, --
R:  They've --
L:  -- I think it's [MN] -- it's -- it's better when you have a broader subject to talk about because there's, you know, a lot of things that you could say.  [NOISE]
R:  I know.
L:  [MN]
R:  You're really limited.
L:  Yeah.  This is -- so, it's not a very good [MN] first experience for me, [LAUGH] but it's good enough, you know.  I stated my case.  I like what I like.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I did too, and then you've just kind of run out of things to talk about.
L:  Yeah, exactly. 
R:  I wonder if they're trying -- that -- but that's what this is all about, if I'm not mistaken -- 
L:  Just about --
R:  -- is, ah, --
L:  -- ma- --
R:  -- not the subject but just how we interact with one another.
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  I think so.
L:  Oh, because it's a study for a -- a university, is that correct?  And -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and, what --
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Okay.  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, they have to get the right people because there's a lot of people that will just not say anything else and -- 
R:  Well, --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- they record all this, so then they know what we're saying.
L:  Yeah, pretty much.  I [MN] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'd love to have that job, listening in on this phone call.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know, but, you know, they got to pick subjects that have a little more detail or --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- issues involved to, um, -- controversial or otherwise.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  But just --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- talking about the sun and the winter and the weather and so on, it's kind of boring.
L:  And it -- and that's -- yeah, exactly, and like -- like all the topics, it's everybody's preference but, um, [MN] it's a little bit more limited with this one [NOISE] just because it is just so cut and that's it.
