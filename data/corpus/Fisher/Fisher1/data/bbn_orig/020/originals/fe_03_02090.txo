R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Angela.
R:  Hi Angela, I'm Linda.
L:  Hi, Linda.
R:  I -- I know this is about friends --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and, um,  I have a -- a few lady friends, some that are acquaintances, some that are really, really good friends, um --
L:  That's about like me, too.  I've got, uh, real -- one real, real close friend that happens to be my neighbor.
R:  Mine, too.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  We're like -- we're always together and, uh, then I've got some friends from work and some frien- --
R:  Okay.
L:  Just lifelong friends that I've been, you know -- God, I've known for ever, so --
R:  Well, and I have that too, um -- they live out of State and we get together, ha, well, we've gotten together about a half a dozen times in the last thirty years but it's always me going in that direction.
L:  Yeah, never fails, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, all the time, so ...  Um, my friend who is my neighbor we do everything together --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- also.  We have a whole lot in common, we go away for the weekend, we've gone on cruises and if I need anything I can always count on her and vice versa, so it's really nice.
L:  Yeah, it is nice.  That's how I am, too.  We do all of our shopping together.  Anytime our husbands don't want to do it, we're together --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- doing it ourselves or we need a weekend away from the husbands, we g- -- [LAUGH] go -- we go out of town [LAUGH] or -- um -- 
R:  Well, in our case, we're both single.
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's even more fun, you get to do [LAUGH] all kinds of things together.
R:  Yeah, I mean, you know, whatever pops into our head, we get to go and do it, we have no --
L:  Right, and don't have to worry about anybody to answer to.
R:  No, our children are grown and, um, so we're -- you know, it's -- it's fun.
L:  That's cool.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  That's cool.  Yeah, there's a lot of times where our husbands will get together and say, "Okay, we're going to do a project" [NOISE] and Donna and I go, "Not us" [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And we walk -- you know, we go, "Okay, that's when we're going out of town and we're not going to be around while you're doing that project together" [LAUGH].
R:  Well, and, you know, I've gone places with some people that are acquaintances but, you know what --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I don't always -- um, a lot of times I wish I hadn't gone.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  It's always better to go with a close friend.
R:  I think you're right, you know, uh -- sometimes I think well I need to -- to, um, increase my friend --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I need to have more friends, you know.  You never can have enough but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there just seems to be a few people you click with --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and that's just the way it goes.
L:  Right, right, that's how I am too.  I mean, there's some people that I can get along really well with but I'm not necessarily comfortable going for the weekend, you know, I'm more comfortable just being good acquaintances with and --
R:  Yeah, having lunch with or something like that, yeah.
L:  Right, right, and -- but then there are those few like Donna that I just really click real well with and can do anything with and be comfortable. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, yeah. Almo- they're almost like --
L:  We work in the yards together and everything.
R:  Oh, we're not -- you're next door to each other?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, we're just one block apart so we don't really work in the yards together [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, we're right next door together and, uh, so we do the -- we work in the yard and, in fact, a lot of times we'll do our gardens together and do projects -- you know, small projects together [SIGH] and then, uh --
R:  Well, you -- one can cook dinner and the other one -- and share, and then the other one.
L:  Right.
R:  Well, that's fun.
L:  Yeah, we've even done that.  It's funny because we'll get together and have a -- have a family get together, you know, between the two households and, uh, we'll, uh -- I'll, you know -- she'll do the -- start the cooking and I'll finish it or I'll do dessert and she'll do the main course or -- [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, see that works out really well.
L:  We do all kinds of things, yeah.
R:  Do your husbands get along?
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They get along real well.  They, um -- they're both stubborn so, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And they -- they work real well when they do projects together.  They can -- they work things out that they would fight over, you know, if it was just one of 'em and, uh, they stay a lot calmer when they're -- when it's ju- -- when it's the two of them.  So, we don't have to listen to 'em cussing at each oth- -- or, you know, at the project.
R:  Well, I'm -- I'm divorced but I do remember when my husband would work on a project --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and it didn't go exactly right, even though he didn't read the directions, but, you know, I remember that.
L:  [LAUGH] They don't, do they?
R:  [LAUGH] No, they don't.
L:  It's horrible [LAUGH].
R:  I know [LAUGH] ah.
L:  They do that all the time and -- and it's funny when the two of them get together and they haven't read the directions, they always figure it out but it's like, you know, "If y'all read the directions y'all be done by now". [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I think --
L:  But they -- at least they're not cussing us or cussing the project, they're just working together and figuring it out --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it's a lot more peaceful, so --
R:  Well, you know, I -- I think that's a man thing, I guess, I don't -- I don't know.
L:  Uh-huh, it is.
R:  I don't know [LAUGH].
L:  It's got to be [LAUGH] but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, yeah, Donna and I do all kind -- I mean, we get together every single time they're together, you know, we go do our thing just to get away from them, do whatever they want to and --
R:  Well, with her being your neighbor do you ever feel like, "Uh-oh, here she comes now" and you're in the middle of something or can you can tell her, you know, "Jeeze, I'm really busy right now"?
L:  Um, I usually can tell her pretty well, um -- I mean, we -- we've gotten along -- in the beginning, I think, there was some -- some times that I felt, it was like, you know -- I don't know when I first met her, you know, am I gonna to know -- am I gonna to be able to be that close to her and go, you know, "I need my o -- my space time".
R:  Mhm.
L:  But we've -- we've grown together for five years, you know, and grown -- our friendship has grown so much that it's been -- we pretty much go, "Okay, I am too busy, I can't do it tonight, or today or whatever", you know, "I'm going to have to have my alone time" or whatever and we do real good at -- at doing that.
R:  Well now, that's good, that's good.
L:  So, um -- but -- yeah, I do remember right in the beginning, you know, there was times -- 'cause it took us, I mean, when we first moved in, we both moved into a neighborhood that had brand new houses, and so that first year was like we kept on -- you know, we kept talking across the yards but we never really got together because both of us were so busy doing things and, um --
R:  Yeah, there's a lot to do, even with a new house, yes.
L:  Yeah, exactly, and then we just finally started walking, is what we ended up doing, and everything just kind of grew from there and now we're inseparable most of the time [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  So.
R:  If you guys ever move, it's going to be a tearful reunion there.
L:  I know, we decided that if we ever move we're going to buy a piece of land and we can have -- big enough to have two houses on it [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] I think you --
L:  We've even joked around about putting a gate in between our yards, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But it -- it's pretty funny 'cause they have a pool and we don't and, um, they pretty much have -- have told us any time we want to go in the pool, whether they're home or not, just go on over there and -- so, we've joked around about putting a gate in there and -- you know -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, um, it's pretty funny, but --
R:  Just like adjoining rooms at the hotel --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you also have an adjoining gate there.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, well --
L:  So -- so y'all live about a block away?
R:  Yeah, just a block and I'll walk over there or she'll walk over here but what's nice is I retired and she's working so really we just get together some -- once in a while in the evening and pretty much on the weekend.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I have a lot of free time. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you've got your alone time there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, so that makes it nice.
L:  That's one thing about having a family.  She does not have -- she does not have kids so all she's got is the husband to contend with but I've got two teenagers  --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and a -- and a husband to contend with so there are some times where I'm just too tired and I'm then I'm like, "Okay, Donna, not tonight, I'm just too exhausted, I've got to just sit", you know, and she'll do the same thing 'cause she works, they have their own business.  So, normal hours is not, you know, working with them, they -- they work round the clock, basically, on their own business, so it -- it's pretty interesting but we're real good about being able to just tell each other, "Okay, too busy, don't have time for you right now" [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, just want to chill out tonight.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah, I've said that.
L:  And then there are times where we go, "Okay, I need you because I need to get away" [LAUGH] so --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  You know, that works real well, also [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I -- get me out of here [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah, I've called my friend too and said, "You know what, I've been in this house for three days, you need to get me out of here" so --
L:  Yeah, "I don't care where, just anywhere" [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, so that's nice.
L:  Exactly.
R:  But, you know, when I worked, though, I can't say that I had close friends.  I -- I think I didn't have time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I had children and my husband and the house and I worked long hours and I had acquaintances but I -- I didn't really take the time to make a friend.  At least you did so that's nice.
L:  Yeah, and I really think that if it wasn't for her living so close we wouldn't have -- I would be the same way 'cause before I had several people that I called friends but we didn't get together and do things outside of work when we saw each other and things like that, um, but living so close together, you know, they have get togethers all the time and -- because they're single and they don't have kids they'll -- they'll have a get together at, you know, um, fourth of July and things like that, and they invite all their friends that have kids so it worked out that we could bring our kids and, um, that's kind of how -- after we started walking and actually started going to their parties is how we actually -- everything worked out and I was like, you know, it'd be pretty easy to actually have a friend in this because she's right there, she's right next door, so it's not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, it's not like it takes a lot of time to -- to build a friendship when they're that close.
R:  Are you about the same age?
L:  Huh?
R:  Are you about the same age?
L:  Actually, she's my husband's age.  We're about six years different, six years apart.
R:  Well, that's still -- that's not bad.
L:  Yeah, we're close, yeah, but she's my husband's age so it works out real well, I mean, we all get along real well, all four of us, so --
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  Which makes it even easier, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that we can all do things together, not just the two of us.
R:  Yeah, 'cause if one of the husbands didn't like someone then that would make it difficult.
L:  Exactly.
R:  But, yeah --
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah, that's great.  Um, are you on the east coast?
L:  Uh, no, I'm actually Texas.
R:  So am I.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay, oh, I didn't realize that.  I -- I figured they would put -- put us with anybody but --
L:  Yeah, I did too.
R:  Ah.
L:  I did too, huh.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Maybe we're the only ones on the Saturday list. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, today's Sunday.
L:  Oh, Sunday list.  That's right, it is Sunday, isn't it?
R:  Yes.
L:  My goodness.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  The weekend's flown [LAUGH].
R:  Well, and I am real bad about not knowing the day because I don't work and when you don't work you just don't care.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And my daughter called me one day, and she's grown and has a job and -- and ...
