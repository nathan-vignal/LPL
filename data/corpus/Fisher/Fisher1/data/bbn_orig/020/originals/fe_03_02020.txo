L:  Hello? 
R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Joan.  [NOISE]
R:  My name's Andrew.  [NOISE]
L:  Okay.  So, I -- and I -- I really could not hear too much of what --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they said.  I know it's something about cortra- -- corporate America.
R:  Ah, it's -- I [MN] -- 
L:  Did you hear it? 
R:  I didn't hear it too clearly.  I was -- I was a little distracted, um, but it -- I remember hearing the word stock market.  So, I presume it's something to do with --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, accounting reform or something like that.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.  [NOISE] I'm -- I'm not real sure if I understand all of it to be honest with you, um, --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- if they're talking about, like, the Enron thing and [NOISE] -- and all of that.
R:  Ah, I presume so, yeah.
L:  Well, [LAUGH] I hate to even comment on that.  I just think they ought to put all those guys in prison.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I told my economics professor on, um, I guess it would have been Wednesday [inaudible] we had class, you know, I s- -- I said [MN] we could consider, um, you know, a- adjusting the rules for fraud so if y- -- put a -- put a price per limb and if, you know, -- if you defraud people to the amount of, say, five hundred thousand dollars for your personal gain we can cut off one arm and if it's a million dollars we'll cut off two arms.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  You know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And -- and so forth and m- maybe that would be a bit of a in- incentive not to or some- -- [LAUGH] 
L:  I [MN] -- I would think that would do it.  I would think that would do it, especially if he didn't have any arms or legs left he couldn't do much of anything, so --
R:  Well, --
L:  -- guess it's learning a lesson the hard way.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  No, I -- I just think they really need to be punished [MN] I -- I think, [NOISE] and -- my TV is loud and my thing broke here.  Um, I think we need to punish those guys severely.  I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, take their little toys away from them, you know, put them in a regular house like, you know, the people that work for them and -- and just let them, you know, --
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  -- live their life the way the [MN] -- a way -- the way the average person would have to live it and -- and, um, [NOISE] -- actually, they should go to prison and their families could live just a normal life.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] You know.  I just don't -- I think we -- we pamper them too much.
R:  Have you -- have you -- um, do you happen to read the -- the cartoon strip Doonesbury? 
L:  I have, yeah.
R:  I remem- -- I remember back, um, [MN] after -- after it all came out, but when they -- wh- when things started getting, um, cleared up and -- and so forth they -- they ran a s- -- a series where they had the -- Ken Lay and his wife were, um, having like a -- a yard sale [SIGH] of their house --
L:  Oh, I think that --
R:  -- all the contents to [LAUGH] -- to pay for the bill- --
L:  Yep, I --
R:  -- bills and liabilities and stuff.  It was -- he -- he --
L:  I think I saw that.
R:  -- he stuck some really good [LAUGH], um, just commentary in there.
L:  Yeah, I think I remember seeing that.  I don't remember actually what it said, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I thought it was -- it was pretty good.  And I [MN] -- well, I don't know.  I know they're not talking about, um, you know, the presidential things and stuff, but I even think when the Clintons left the White House and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- took some of their little gifts along with them I thought, you know, that they should be penalized for it, you know.
R:  Well, it's probably true.
L:  And it -- it shouldn't have been what [several inaudible words] they wanted to pay for it.  I think they -- you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's like [MN] -- you know, I think it -- it shows like the younger kids if you're rich you can get what you want.
R:  Mm hm.
L:  You know.  But yet let the poor guy take something that doesn't belong to him and, you know, they go to prison and -- and I think it should just -- you know, it shouldn't be based on what you have -- [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as to what you get.
R:  I'll have to admit that if -- if I had been working in the White House, you know, as some, you know, little desk worker or something, i- it would be pretty tempting to -- to have a little fun on your way out [MN].
L:  [MN] Well, I think some of the things could be legitimately [NOISE] called gifts and stuff but, you know, when you walk out with all of the -- the china and the silverware and the goblets --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, -- and, um, -- 
R:  Yeah, [MN] th- th- th- th- th- there's certainly [MN] --
L:  -- linen.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [MN] Yeah.
L:  You know, I --
R:  You --
L:  -- I think there is -- there's a limit as to what you should be able to call yours.
R:  Mhm.  Th- th- th- that's definitely true.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I don't know.  I --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- don't know, it's just -- but I -- I do think, like, -- I think there's been so many things come out about them, you know, these big businesses and stuff and these people that have -- have, um, you know, sold their stocks and -- and pocketed their money and everything --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- while they're telling the employees just to hang loose, you know, and -- and be cool and stick with them, you know.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  And -- and they -- they made their big bucks and everything and then their employees lost all of their money.  I just think that they -- they need to make an example of them because I think it's happening more and more because people are getting away with it.
R:  I think that's true.  Um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's [MN] -- I'm a -- I'm a college student right now and [MN] the, um, -- the -- the -- the question of ethics in business has been, um, often raised in [inaudible].  It's one of our favorite things we do to -- to make fun of the business students.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Point out, you know, "You don't even have ethics classes.  How can you claim to" [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "support them and stuff".
L:  Oh, [MN] that's true.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I, um, -- I have not worked in a while, so I -- I, um, -- I don't know.  I've been out of the work field for -- for quite a while now.  But I -- but I just think, you know, -- I just think that, you know, employees [MN] -- well, even -- even, um, American Airlines, what they've gone through, you know.  [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, they talked their employees out of raises and -- and, you know, [NOISE] um, I have a [NOISE] -- a nephew that works for them and -- and they take, you know, pay cuts and -- or other compensations and stuff and -- and yet these employees, ah, -- these big shots have given themselves big bonuses.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, where they haven't actually -- they haven't actually taken --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- from their employees, you know, as far as -- because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they haven't gone bankrupt yet.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, if they go bankrupt, they're -- they're -- still have padded their pockets now, and if they go --
R:  Mm hm.
L:  -- bankrupt their employees are out of a job and they might be out of a job too, but they have more money to show for it.
R:  [NOISE] Indeed.
L:  [NOISE] So, I --
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  -- I just think they need to make an example to some of these places, more than just a slap on the hands, because I don't think it's going to stop until they -- you know, these people are punished.  [NOISE]
R:  Mm hm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm -- I'm kind of wondering if it's something that can stop.  I mean, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is it -- is it, say, you know, [MN] something that is just almost irresistible to people in charge of large amounts of money or is it just a, you know, -- [NOISE] whe- when you're -- when you're making all these decisions, I mean, -- I g- -- I guess it's -- it's not [MN] entirely clear to me that i- -- that it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, something we can get rid of, not that we shouldn't do anything about it, but I'm not --
L:  Oh, I think they could get rid of it.  I think if -- I think if there --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was more of a, [NOISE] um, what do they call it, um, um, [MN] I can't even think of the term they use, like check on --
R:  Deterrent or -- 
L:  Well, no, just like, you know, if they have more of [MN] a -- gosh, what am I thinking?  [NOISE] Um, you know, like they check on people.  I can't think of what [MN] -- 
R:  [LIPSMACK] More -- more --
L:  -- what it is.
R:  -- um, oversight or auditing --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- something.
L:  Yeah, I think if -- I think if -- well, people pad their -- their figures too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I think if there was -- if the -- I think maybe an audit would do it.  I don't know if I would -- if it would be an audit or if it would be [NOISE] like a committee that would go over every book in every detail, you know, to see where the money is actually going.  I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think it could be done, and I think you have to have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- honest people, you know, that run these corporations.  [NOISE] You know, it -- it -- they know what they're doing.  They know if they're being underhanded or not, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They know if -- they know if they're, ah, [NOISE] giving themself a raise when they're asking their employees not to take a raise or they [MN] -- they know that -- that they cashed in all these stocks and stuff, but yet they've told their employees to hold on to them knowing that the stocks are going to drop, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I -- I think they could put a stop to it if they would [NOISE] --
R:  Oh, you're -- you're probably --
L:  -- if they'd really go after them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.  Well, you're -- I -- I think you're certainly right.  [MN] They -- they definitely know what they're doing.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I guess there's a question of whether do they actually think of it as wrong [MN].
L:  [NOISE] Mm, [NOISE] well, [NOISE] I don't know.  I would think [NOISE] -- I don't know.  I -- I would definite- -- I believe they think it's wrong.  [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I think if they didn't, then why wouldn't they just admit to what's going on?  [NOISE] You know, why would they try to cover it up?  [NOISE] 
R:  Well, [MN] there -- there -- there's a difference between doing something you think is wrong and something that other people think is wrong.  I mean, ah, [MN] --
L:  No, it's --
R:  -- trying to think of a e- easy example, but it -- I mean [MN] --
L:  [MN] Well, yeah, I know what you're saying, and -- and that's true, that's true.  That -- there is a difference because you see things the way you want to see them, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] But, um, [NOISE] I just think if -- if I tell somebody, you know, not to do this because the company is going to be okay, and then I don't have enough faith in the company that I'm selling my stock, and I'm --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- going to make sure that I sell it quick enough to get my money back out of it or most of my money out of it, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm not going to take a big loss, but yet I'm telling these people to hold on to theirs.  You know, I should be holding on to mine if I have that much faith in the company.  I mean, after all I'm -- I'm one of the big shots and -- and, you know, -- 
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  I just -- so I -- [NOISE] I think they know that -- that they were in the wrong, I really do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Tell me you're the head of Enron.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Or, or --
