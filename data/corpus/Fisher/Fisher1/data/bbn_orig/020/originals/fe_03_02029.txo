L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  Bob.
L:  Errol.  How are you? 
R:  Errol, hi.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, do you like cold weather or hot weather? 
L:  [LAUGH] Um, [COUGH] well, [SIGH] if I had to choose I think I probably prefer [NOISE] cold weather.
R:  Oh, is --
L:  I live --
R:  -- that right? 
L:  Yeah.  I live in the south and, ah, we don't get a lot of cold weather here and, um, generally speaking I can tolerate the cold weather better -- better than the, ah, -- than the hot weather because when it gets hot here the humidity is just terrible.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It -- it feels awful and I can -- I kind of -- I like the, ah, -- I -- I like in between, actually. 
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  But that wasn't one of the choices.  I like warm weather.
R:  [MN] Hot or cold, they said.
L:  I'm sorry? 
R:  They said, "Hot or cold".  So you have to take a pick, I guess.
L:  Right.  So, since I have to choose, then I choose, ah, cold weather, but --
R:  I would too.
L:  Really? 
R:  I live in Cincinnati and we have, ah, the river here, and when it gets hot in the summer the humidity is just terrible.
L:  Really? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So the humidity there is pretty bad too? 
R:  Yeah.  [PAUSE] 
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's [COUGH] pretty awful here as -- as well.  And the thing about it too is that [PAUSE] it just -- well, last summer it -- it didn't really get that hot, but it was -- the -- the -- the air in my car went out.
R:  Oh, terrible. 
L:  And I didn't want to [LAUGH] -- and I wanted to sell the car.  My car is up for sale right now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- and -- and I didn't want to put, you know, seven or eight hundred dollars or whatever it was going to cost to fix it -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- into the car in order to -- to, ah, repair --
R:  Do you --
L:  -- the air conditioning.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I just kind of, ah, tolerated it.  But it was -- it was quite uncomfortable.  And if -- even if it's not very, very hot here, it's -- it's -- it's humid enough so that it makes it very uncomfortable.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You need air in the south.
R:  Right.
L:  You really do.  It's not a -- just [inaudible] necessity.
R:  It's not a choice.  It's not a choice.
L:  Yeah.  And it says -- o- one of the other questions was, "Do you prefer in- indoor activities or outdoor?" -- 
R:  Or outdoor activities.  Well, [COUGH] [PAUSE] I'm an indoor guy.
L:  Really? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  What are you doing?
R:  I --
L:  What do you like to do indoors? 
R:  I like to listen to music and I like to watch movies.  I -- we've got a cable system here and you can watch almost any movie you want whenever you want.  [PAUSE]
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  And, ah, I watch movies.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, ah, -- 
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- I get on the computer and I read -- read magazines and newspapers, The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times and different mag- -- Fortune magazine and, oh, Business two point oh and Red Herring, different magazines I read.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  So I'm pretty well occupied indoors, and then when we go out we go to restaurants.  I guess that's indoors.
L:  [LAUGH] That's only out just to get to the -- the, ah, indoor facility.
R:  Right.  But I do like -- when the weather is pleasant, I will like to go out and sit on the porch and watch all the lights across the valley.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  At night.
L:  You say you like to watch the what?
R:  The lights across the valley at night, the different lights.  It looks like stars.
L:  Oh, okay.  You live on a hill? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  So that is nice.
R:  Yeah.  What do you like, indoor or outdoor? 
L:  Well, I -- I think I prefer outdoor activities.  I look forward to -- and I'm not terribly athletic, but I -- I do like to do, you know, -- I've become more, ah, outdoorsy over the years.  I like to be outside, even though the outdoors doesn't always agree with me because I have hay fever.  But I enjoy being outside.  I like the [inaudible] --
R:  Playing golf? 
L:  Yeah, not -- I don't do golf.  I jog.
R:  Jog.
L:  And w- -- and I like to walk, you know, -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- go to the park, look around, enjoy the -- the beauty of nature.
R:  Right. 
L:  Ah, you know, just -- I like -- I really like lakes.  I like to go to the lake and -- I'm not a f- -- I don't do any fishing.  I just like to look at the water.
R:  Oh.
L:  Very relaxing.  I'm -- I do a lot of writing.
R:  Oh, do you? 
L:  And it's -- yeah, and it's very relaxing and it seems to kind of encourage my creative juices to flow more freely.
R:  Oh, is that right, the lake?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Is that right?
L:  Going to the lake always does that.  Being -- just being outside -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- seems to, um, inspire me to think more creatively.
R:  Gee.
L:  So I -- I'm more of an outdoorsy kind of person for that reason.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH] But [MN] the -- the bad part about that, though, is that during the spring when I'm outdoors [COUGH] -- excuse me, I really have a terrible problem with sneezing and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- coughing and, you know, all the pollen just really drives me crazy, but -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- I c- -- try to withstand it and, you know, -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] -- until it gets too bad.
R:  Right.
L:  But for that reason I would probably be more out- -- more outdoors.
R:  Right.
L:  Outdoorsy.  But it's interesting they -- you know, they give you -- when they give you these either or questions -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sometimes -- you know, it kind of forces you into making a choice and sometimes -- y- you know, because there are times when I prefer to be indoors because I like to watch movies, like you do.  Um, I'm not -- I don't watch a lot of TV, though.
R:  Don't you? 
L:  I like to read magazines and things like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I -- a- and I l- -- I like to listen to music and I'm -- I'm also a musician.
R:  Oh, is that right? 
L:  So I make my own music.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I enjoy -- I play piano, keyboard -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that kind of thing.  So I like to, um, do that.  I entertain myself like that, and then sometimes I'm on the computer as well -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, [COUGH] doing research and sometimes just checking out different things and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- going to the different newsrooms and things like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sometimes I can spend three hours on the computer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, three or even four if I don't have anything else to do.
R:  My wife can spend twelve hours on a computer.
L:  She spends twelve hours?
R:  She has.
L:  Just for fun? 
R:  Internet.  [PAUSE]
L:  I -- I mean, but it's not business related? 
R:  Well, some of it is. Not much.  Mostly -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- Internet.
L:  [PAUSE] Well, you know what, I first started using the Internet several years ago. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I remember that I would get on and I would -- you know, sometimes you -- you -- you -- you get these pop up boxes and, ah, --
R:  Oh, yeah, you have to screen those out.
L:  Yeah, and you click -- you click something and then it takes you somewhere and then you find that before you know it you end up getting into some website that's [MN] -- you know nothing about and you had no intentions of going to. 
R:  Right.
L:  You know, --
R:  And you get an --
L:  -- and it's --
R:  -- email forever from them.
L:  Yeah, and then you find that you start -- you start getting all of these emails that, um, just drive you -- 
R:  Spam.
L:  -- crazy.  Yeah, spams and -- and it -- it's just -- it's crazy because -- and you can end up, especially when you first start -- for somebody who's a beginner -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- especially if sometimes you -- I -- I would click on some things and I didn't even realise I was clicking on something, you know.  Sometime- -- they're so savvy now with the way they have these things laid out on the Internet and so you can click something and be [MN] on another website and not even realise.
R:  Back -- w- when I first started, we had -- I [MN] -- w- we were on AOL.  We didn't know how to -- I don't even know if they did -- AOL screen -- would screen things for you or not, b- but things would pop up.  And I signed on one day and, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where I signed on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I was holding onto the mouse --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, ah, this thing pops up right underneath where the mouse i- is signed on at [PAUSE] and it was for a foreign language studies, and I accidentally pushed the button right where I had just stopped unpushing the button to get on line.  And then I was getting these things about foreign language --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- on the computer.  How to learn Spanish, how to learn Italian, how to learn French, how to learn Russian.  They had about P- Portuguese, English, everything.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] All I did was sign on accidentally, hit it again.  [PAUSE] 
L:  Well, the other day I -- you know, I'm -- I'm an Internet buff myself and the other day I was just kind of fooling around with the -- with the net, you know, when I was -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on the Internet.  And I typed in [COUGH] yahoo dot IT and it took me to the yah- -- to the Italian version of yahoo.
R:  Oh, is that right?
L:  Yeah.  They -- they have their -- and it's all in Italian.
R:  Is that right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  It was interesting.  And you find things on there that you won't find on the -- the yahoo that's in English.
R:  Is that right?
L:  Yeah.  And I suppose there's probably one for [inaudible] yah- --
