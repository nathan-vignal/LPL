R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  So, do you prefer cold weather or hot weather?
L:  Uh, hot weather.
R:  Oh.
L:  I'm a biker.  [LAUGH] I like riding motorcycles.
R:  Oh, are -- are you in the south?
L:  Uh, Virginia.
R:  Oh, okay.  What part of Virginia?
L:  Um, I'm about six miles from the West Virginia line.
R:  Oh.  Oh --
L:  Um, next to, um, you know -- you know anything about the Greenborough or the -- or the, uh, homestead?
R:  Not really.  Not a whole lot.
L:  Okay.  It's two great big resorts.  Uh, what is it?  Uh, President comes into the Greenborough all the time.  Uh, it's the one that had the bunkers, so I'm not very far from that.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You know, they had a big thing on TV about the bunker over here ... [LAUGH] and, uh, I like summer better, activities.  I don't do any skiing or anything like that so ... everything that I do's summer.
R:  [COUGH] Neither do I.  Are you more of an indoor or outdoor person?
L:  [SIGH] I like being outdoors ... more in the summer.  In the winter, I have a tendency to hibernate.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That makes two of us.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well ... I live -- 'cause I -- I live in a -- a city right outside of Atlanta.
L:  Oh.
R:  Ooh!  And, um ... why'd you say that?
L:  Uh, that's hot down there.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So, actually it depends on what time of the year.  I mean, in the summer I -- I stay indoors --
L:  I --
R:  -- a lot.  In the winter, I'm indoors a lot, um ... but I would say ...
L:  Spring and fall.
R:  -- in the  spring is when I get out.
L:  Yep.
R:  Spring and fall are nice seasons.
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- I can understand 'cause it's like a hundred in some index -- heat index down there like all summer long.
R:  Well, yeah.  Last year I think it was like upper nineties.  It was something like probably I guess around, um ... [LIPSMACK] ninety five or something like that, or ... yeah it was -- it was pretty hot.
L:  Yeah.  We had a pretty hot summer here last summer but ...
R:  Really?
L:  Uh, hotter than what it's been in a while 'cause we had a drought.
R:  Yeah, a --
L:  A bad one so ...
R:  Did too.
L:  Mm, that, uh, that hurt us because usually the ... [LIPSMACK] rain in the -- uh, keeps us cool, but it didn't last year.  But, um, I don't like really, really hot heat.  When it's like that I have a tendency to stay inside with the central air but, um ... I'll go out when it's really hot on a bike 'cause we live in a rural area and we've got a lot of, um ... a lot of the rides that we go on are -- are real shaded up in the country.
R:  What kind of bi- you mean, like a bicycle?
L:  No, motorbike -- motorcycle.
R:  Oh, okay.  You ride a motorcycle?
L:  Yeah.  And, uh, we got three. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, um, so it's ... you can go up and through there and it's not as bad heat wise.  If I had to stay like downtown in the concrete, I couldn't do it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't blame you.  So, what do you like to do when you're -- when you're inside?
L:  Mm, [LIPSMACK] read, the computer of course, um ...
R:  Everybody says the computer too because I -- I'm -- I'm kind of an internet freak myself.
L:  Oh, and ours is never off.  It's --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  twenty four, seven, yeah.  I mean, we're standing around fighting for who's gonna sit back down in the chair again. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I can understand that.  I -- you know, I have a friend who, um, does quite a lot of these studies and such.  She -- she's on the computer all the time and -- but her thing is making money out of the computer.  You know, some people wanna work from home and that kinda thing.  Well, that's what she does.  She does --
L:  Well, I do ebay.
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Yeah, I do ebay and their ... mm, a couple of years ago there was those points programs that was out on line ... and I rocked up some Amazon gift certificates [LAUGH] ...
R:  Did you?
L:  Yes.  I had, I think ... I think I figured it out but I had over fifteen hundred dollars one year just in Amazon.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How'd you do that?
L:  Um, you clicked on different programs.  You -- you went to -- you visited websites and they gave you points for website visits --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, you know, if you did, like ... oh, seven or eight programs a day, you know, you could rock up, and there was one out there called free ride.  They really gave you good Amazon.  Then I had another -- there was another one out there called jaboom and you rated music ... um, and put 'em in categories.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Matter of fact, that's where I got one of my, uh, name's from is jaboomer two, and I mean, I -- I could make ... twenty dollars a week gift certificates a week gift certificates off a that site easy.
R:  So, what, have you -- have you redeemed any of 'em?
L:  Yeah, they're all gone.  And now since the internet crash ... [LAUGH] those programs have dried up.  [LAUGH] Nobody wants to pay you to do anything now ... you know, like that.
R:  When you say, "The internet crash" what do you --
L:  Um, when all the stocks went.  Like, um, pest dot com, um, all of those companies that went belly up.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  A lot of those was big contributors to these programs ... and so when they went down and the money start -- stopped funneling to the points programs, well, the point- points programs also folded.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, were you able to redeem most of 'em before the ...
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- they went out of business.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Yep, I got 'em all redeemed.
R:  Oh, well that was nice.
L:  Yeah.  It saved me a lot of money one Christmas.
R:  [LAUGH] I'm sure, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, do you do the -- the test drives too?
L:  If I can, yeah.  I'm on a coupon board called my coupons.
R:  My coupons?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  My coupons dot com and, um ... I try to do the test drives but again a lot of those places that get the test drives are ... like Saturn and stuff like that.  I have to drive a good distance to find a Saturn dealership.
R:  You're in kind of a real rural area?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] And, uh, it, um, you know ...
R:  Well, now you know a lot of those people on fat wallet aren't actually doing those test drives too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are you familiar with fat wallet?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I've been to fat wallet.
R:  Okay.  I'm a loyal visitor of fat wallet.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, in fact I'm a member now.
L:  I'm -- I'm, um, I'm a member of my coupons and I, um ... you have to check it out.  My coupons dot com --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I -- I'm Jaboomer two on there.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I -- I gotta big mouth.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But we, um, we got coupon boards, family boards, rebate boards.  Uh, I save unbelievable money with this coupon trading thing.
R:  Now, what about the surveys.  Do you do those too?
L:  Yeah, if I -- yeah, 'cause I -- somebody sent me an email about signing up for this.  I didn't even know it was out there and somebody fr- I -- I'm assuming from one of the boards I've visited, you know, pulled my name and my email address and sent it to me and as soon as I found out about it, I, you know, signed up and like it was like two days later I started getting telephone calls, and um ... [SIGH] my brother has participated in this a long, long time ago.  I think this is like a l- um, language --
R:  Linguistics --
L:  -- study.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And he had to go around.  Matter of fact, he come up here with a tape recorder, um, and we're talking like, what, seventies and, um, he tape recorded a bunch of us around here talking.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because for some reason we had this weird ...
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] weird way of talking.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I've had, you know, a lot of people tell me, "Where're you from?" [LAUGH] but ... and, uh, so I -- he's done this before so somewhere in the seventies I was on -- I'm on tape at this very same ... college from the seventies ... where he taped me.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I forgot what it was.   He had me read something I think back then, um, but, uh ... yeah, this is fat wallet.  Uh, it seems like to me like I'm a member on there but I can't remember what name I signed up under.  It was --
R:  Have you -- have you found that, uh, you've -- which one do you pick as -- as best -- as the better one?  My coupons?
L:  I like -- I like my coupons ... and they have private boards.  There's a new one out there too that me and some friends have started up.  It's very private.  You've got to be approved to go on to keep the trolls out.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, it's starting up and it's doing pretty good and, um, we have different boards on that one.  Uh, the same thing, test drives and stuff like that.  Family relations board which I'm a m- moderator of, and, uh --
R:  I see you are an internet buff.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I tell you.  I have two disabled children and I take care of my father who's eighty two years old.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And my time out of the house is limited, and there's times when one of them is sick or something like that that I have to stay up all night.  So, to keep myself awake I stay online because if I sit down and start watching nothing but TV --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'll go to sleep.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But I can watch TV and do the computer and stay awake.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] And, um --
R:  Yeah, I understand that.
L:  So -- and then when AOL went unlimited, hell, the sky was the limit.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, that was a blessing for you.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, man, I jumped up and down and screamed [LAUGH] 'cause again, being in a rural area, like earth link and all those places ... we don't have 'em.
R:  Uh.
L:  I mean, we got AOL and -- and intello's.
R:  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] And that's it.  That's, uh, the maj- major two internet servers.  Well, I guess Walmart dot com ... you can probably get.  I don't know.  I have but never went there.   We just been on AOL since ... ninety ... four ... so we've just stayed there.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  Well ... [LIPSMACK] I like fat wallet a lot.  I -- I -- I been checking that out now for about a year so --
