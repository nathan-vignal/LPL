L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  Good.
L:  So, what kinda activities do you like to do?
R:  Well, [COUGH] I ... I'm kind of an outdoors kinda person.  I like to play tennis, jog, you know, walk ... through the park.  Uh ... [LIPSMACK] I just like to be outside and I live in the south and we don't have a lot of cold weather so ...
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I live in the north.  We have plenty of cold weather and this winter we got beat with it.
R:  Where do you live?
L:  Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, we got more snow than we -- I mean, you know, what was the -- like, twenty ... some places got up to t- uh, two feet so, um, I'm not really cold weather.  I used to be.  When I was younger, of course, I used to go out, do the snow angels.  I used to have the snow -- you know, build igloos, you know, snowball fights and all that when I was little.  Um, it's not as fun as an adult for some reason.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It just seems a little annoying to have to drive in it.
R:  Right, yeah.  I --
L:  And -- yeah, you know, so it's like not as easy, but, um, I guess I do out- um, I like to read so that's usually a indoor activity but really I like to read in, um ... say, I usually do that indoors so I guess if I had more places to read outdoors, you know, like my house is not real, real big outside and I have neighbors around I like to have privacy when I read. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  So, you like to do outdoor stuff?  Do you ever do anything indoor or anything like that?
R:  Yeah, I watch TV, I ... [LIPSMACK] I don't -- I like to, uh, surf the -- the net and that's how I found this.  [LAUGH] I'm on the computer a lot.
L:  Okay.  Okay.  I found out through my sister.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Newspaper 'cause we're in Philly, so Pen is right here, so, um, I did find out like that.  I do have a computer but I'm in graduate school.  That's another thing that takes up a -- a lot of my time is, you know, doing stuff related to that because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, you know, I'm getting my masters.  I'm going to ... do everything I'm told to and do all my work.  So, yeah, I use my computer but usually it's in relation to that.
R:  What are you getting your masters in?
L:  Um, it's a MED.  I'm learning how to teach visually impaired children.
R:  Oh, okay.  That's very interesting.
L:  So, you know, I'm like, a -- a year and a half into it and it's a longer program but I'm -- I have like a year and a half more to go.  I teach in public school now but you know ... [LIPSMACK]
R:  Oh.
L:  So, during my days I don't particularly get out.  I don't really get outside to do, you know, outside [LAUGH] during the week.  It's like a pick 'em up in the morning before school 'cause I teach kindergarten --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- and then they're dismissed and we stand out with 'em for fifteen minutes.  Um, it's not in our contract but we do it to be nice, to see that someone picks them up.
R:  Oh, well, that's nice.
L:  So, I -- during the day, you know, I have an aid that takes them out to recess and so forth and during the summer it's like -- last summer, I didn't get to do anything because I had surgery.  So, I sat, read, channel surfed ... and even that bored me after a while because that was a long --
R:  I can see.
L:  It was like a long while.  It was like, God, I'd like to [inaudible] you know, but how much can you really do?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, like a- after a certain amount of time it is nothing else to do.  Especially when you can't move.  [LIPSMACK] That was like a -- a little bit torturous but ... what kind of things now you like to do outside [inaudible] banks -- did you use- like to do it when you were younger?
R:  Did I like to do what now?
L:  Outside things when you were younger?
R:  Not really.  I was not -- I was not an outdoors kinda person when I was growing up.  I w- I was outside some but not really a lot, but I -- I appreciate it more, I think, because I can be outside -- I'm not really -- I don't consider myself extremely athletic although I do try to do enough to k- to kind of stay in shape --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- remai- and be physically fit.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um ... [LIPSMACK] I like to do things li- I just -- I have a greater appreciation for nature.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh -- than I did when I was growing up and while as a kid I think I -- I did -- you know, I appreciated the flowers and the ... you know, the insects and all that kinda stuff, but now I -- I have a greater appreciation for that so I just kinda like to look at ... the trees, the flowers, the -- the plants and stuff like that when I'm outside.  Um, [COUGH] in addition to doing stuff like, I'm not really into the camping thing or I'm not that much into --
L:  I did that.  I was a girl scout.  I did that when I was young.  I gave that up like a bad habit.
R:  [LAUGH] Been there, done that, don't wanna go back.
L:  The bugs.  I am a girl scout leader currently and some of the city troops -- troop leaders don't go camping.  It's just a thing.  I'm not taking 'em out to the woods.  I'm not crapping in the woods.  It's not gonna happen and as I've gotten older, I don't like bugs.  I don't like bugs coming into my house.  I'm not going out to where they normally live and call myself, "Ooh, I'm gonna sleep out here".  No.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's not gonna happen.  It's not within the realm of possible things.  My girls, you know, my troop, they just have to get over it and go someplace else.  I did it when I was younger without complaining.
R:  Well, I mean, but [COUGH] I think when you're a kid, you don't even think about things like ... bugs and you -- you don't -- I mean, you're having so much fun playing with your friends and just doin' stuff --
L:  It was exciting. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  But as you get older ... [LAUGH] you know, your interests change or, you know, the things that used to bother you when you were -- or didn't bother you when you were a kid a lot of times bother you as an adult --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause you're like ... I just don't have time for that, you know?
L:  It's like, oh no, I don't wanna kill -- ooh, that wasn't it.  [LAUGH] Yeah, now my activities have changed.  I mean, I end up doing inside stuff like I've ... walk, but I don't usually get to walk outside.  I walk on my treadmill which isn't as fun but I put the TV on and, you know ... and the time goes by for my treadmill, and I can go out and walk but I actually -- our days have been back and forth.  You know, like today it was around fifty five degrees, and it's not -- it should be around sixty.  So, it was a little cooler than -- it goes back and forth and our winter was real hard.  I can go out to, um, local parks.  I always feel more comfortable.  One way where I live, one way you walk, is decent and it's pretty and then the other way it starts going downhill.  [LAUGH] So --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- I don't wanna -- well, I could walk the way that was really nice but not downhill.  But I just -- you know, I go on my treadmill and ... [MN] you know, as long as it's exercise and trying to get myself exercise, then if it's inside instead of outside -- sometimes within the summer though, I get out more because I have my summers free.  And I can go out to, like, Fairmount Park which is ... the park system here.  Go out to Fairmount Park and walk outside during the summer.  Usually get up early in the morning.  You know, on the early side because after I sleep in -- after a certain amount of time of sleeping in ... you know, you can get up early and not have a big fuss over it.
R:  Right. [COUGH]
L:  So, um, I do do that during the summer but not last summer, the summer before, and now I'm able to do it again this coming summer, which we're all looking forward to.  [LAUGH] Counting down the days.
R:  I'm sure about that.
L:  So --
R:  I have friends who are teachers and, uh, believe me I -- I can definitely relate to that.
L:  Yeah, our -- our school systems falling apart, but you know [LAUGH] it's like, okay, it's falling apart.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's what they're there for.  So, have you seen snow?  Have you actually physically touched --
R:  Yeah.  Well, it -- it is actually snowing here.
L:  Okay.
R:  I live in Atlanta, Georgia.
L:   Oh, okay.
R:  It actually does snow here every now and then.  In fact it snowed this year.
L:  Okay.
R:  But I mean, it's usually like an inch or maybe two ye- two inches.  If we get four or five or six, that's really a lot.
L:  It's -- [LAUGH]
R:  You gotta keep in mind --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we're not prepared for snow.  We don't have snow tires, we don't have snow chains, the road crews are not equipped to handle that.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, yeah, it's a lot different.  Up here we expect it now.  We didn't expect as much as we got but, um, we expected it.  Uh, you know, we expect snow.  If this is a year and it doesn't snow, we're surprised.  I mean, you know, we're just built in to expect it so, no, I was just curious if you like got to do -- like, when you were a kid did you get to go outside and like just --
R:  Oh, in the snow?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, I mean, I can't -- you know what, I can remember when I was a kid, I lived [COUGH] ... in a -- I -- I grew up in Atlanta and when I was a kid I remember my dad going out and -- and, uh, getting snow.  We would play in the snow and he made snow -- what we called snow cream.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] Which, to me, seems so silly now.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, it was kind- it felt kinda -- I don't know what he did but he put milk in it and something else, in the snow, and created some type of concoction that tasted pretty good to me ...
L:  Oh.
R:  -- as a child.  So, I remember doing that once or twice maybe.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, we're -- I mean, I actually have seen snow.  I'm not like the people in California.
L:  Like, "What does snow look like?"  [LAUGH] Okay.  Yeah, because some people have memories, okay, "Ooh, my first snow".  Like, I have kids in my class, a little girl.  She came from India and this is like her first time.  We did a graph of different --
