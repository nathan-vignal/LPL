L:  [NOISE] Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  How are ya?
R:  Good.
L:  My name's Tara. [NOISE] 
R:  Tara?
L:  Ahah.
R:  I'm Ray.
L:  Hi, Ray.  Where are ya?
R:  I'm in New York, in New York City.
L:  Oh, I'm in New Orleans.
R:  In New Orleans?
L:  Mhm.
R:  How's the weather there?
L:  Hot.
R:  Hot.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm jealous. [NOISE] 
L:  Well, it's not cold up there yet, is it?
R:  Well, yeah, it is, actually.  It's -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's unusually cold for this time of year.  It's still going down into the, ah, -- the forties.
L:  That is [LAUGH] cold.  
R:  It is really cold.  It's -- it's -- it's too cold.  It -- I don't know, I mean, it's been getting up to just barely sixty at the high point of the day, late in the afternoon, and then it quickly dips down, and it's been like that for, ah, a couple of weeks, and on top of it today it's raining.
L:  Ew.
R:  So it just sucks.
L:  That does sound icky.
R:  Um, --  
L:  I'm sorry about that.  See, I got a sunburn yesterday at the jazz festival, so ... [LAUGH] 
R:  You got a sunburn?
L:  Oh, yeah, big time.  I'm all crispy now. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-oh.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's no good.
L:  [MN] Well, it was a great time, though, so it's every bit of worth it.
R:  Yeah.  What'd you do there?
L:  Saw Bob Dylan.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, sounds like a fun outdoor activity.
L:  Absolutely.  So which do you like better? [LAUGH] 
R:  I definitely like it hot.
L:  I do too.  Hot is good because I like swimming and playing tennis, things like that.
R:  Oh, I'm [NOISE] no good at tennis, but I love to swim.  Swimming is a lot of fun.
L:  And it's way more fun outside than inside.
R:  [MN] Yes, definitely -- at least, ah, usually.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Usually it's more fun -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- unless you, ah, get into trouble.  I did that once.  I s- -- was swimming and I swam so far away from shore that I couldn't see it anymore.  That wasn't fun.
L:  I did that too.  I did that in Maui once.
R:  You did?
L:  Scared me to death.
R:  Yeah, I was very frightened too.  I got picked up by somebody in a boat. [LAUGH] 
L:  [inaudible] well, I eventually swam back to shore, but, still, that's really a scary experience.
R:  But, um, let's see what else do I like outdoors.  I like -- I love to play volleyball.
L:  [NOISE] Volleyball?   
R:  Especially -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- on the beach.
L:  [NOISE] Well, see, I'm no good at volleyball. [NOISE]
R:  You're no good at volleyball?
L:  But I like it.
R:  Well, I'm not, like, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- great at it, like a champion, professional player or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- anything, but I do enjoy it.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I'm not very good at anything.  I'm a decent swimmer, but I'm no athlete.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So ...
L:  My, ah, -- hey, shh.  Um, [NOISE] do you like, ah, -- are -- are -- are there any indoor [NOISE] activities that you're, um, especially fond of, or is it all, like, outdoor things?
R:  Mm, well, [SIGH] no, I don't know that I really like, ah, indoor stuff more.  If I'm indoors, I'm probably, ah, working, um, very often at my desk.  It's no fun.  [NOISE] But I don't know -- let's see, indoor activities ...?  
L:  'Cause I'm on the Internet a lot, so I like that too, but if you asked me, "Would you rather be inside or outside?" I'd probably prefer to be outside, even though I do spend more time inside.
R:  I do, too.  I just don't know if I would count, like, being on my computer as an activity.  I guess in once sense of the -- the word it's an activity, but it's not very active.  It's just you sit there and it's a -- it's a, ah, -- it's a mental exercise.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Although, to tell you the truth, they have now -- they have the coolest thing here.  There -- there's a little park in the middle of the mid town business district of Manhattan --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- called Bryant Park --
L:  Ahah. [NOISE]
R:  -- and they have, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- B, um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- wireless access point -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- throughout the entire park --  
L:  Really? [NOISE] 
R:  -- where you can use -- I don't know how familiar you are with this sort of stuff, but you -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you have -- you can have a wireless Internet connection over -- they call it a eight oh two -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- eleven B protocol --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- a wireless card, and I like to go sit in the park when it's nice out, which hasn't been --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- very often -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- lately.  It's only been, like, a good hour or two here and there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and usually it's been too early in the day.  But I'm hoping that as it really starts to warm up and it's still, you know, nice and sunny and warm even after business hours that I'll go sit out, ah, in the park --
L:  You know, that is such a good idea.
R:  -- and do some work on my computer, and -- and I could say that I would --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I would love that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then that's an activity that could be either indoors or outdoors --
L:  Yeah, but that'd be -- probably be more enjoyable outdoors just like other things are.  That's -- that is just such a great idea.
R:  Yeah, come to think of it, almost every --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- every indoor activity that I can think of is, um, more fun outdoors.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Like, I like to go -- I go out a lot and I like to go to -- to different restaurants all the time and to bars and lounges, but I always like -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to go places where you can sit outside and eat -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- where there's a outdoor patio --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- where you can go drink.  That's always more fun than indoors, to just be out in the, ah, -- the open air.  It's definitely more fun.
L:  [NOISE] Wow!  I had never thought about that.  You can.  I mean, you can -- everything that you do [NOISE], um, indoors can be done outdoors somewhere.
R:  That's right.
L:  I mean, like the -- the Internet thing, I mean, not in my town, but it sounds like something I'd like to start.  [LAUGH] Wouldn't that be great to be the first --  
R:  You could do that.
L:  -- somewhere [inaudible] that.
R:  There's stuff on the Internet.  You could read about -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- how to do that, where -- if you have a broadband connection in your house you could set up equipment that would allow you -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to sort of transmit --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a -- a signal right in your immediate area where people could use it, so you might be able to take it in your backyard or ...  You could definitely do that sort of thing.  It's possible.
L:  Wow, that is great.  That is great.  So we both like warm we- we- [MN] -- I can't even talk. 
R:  We both like warm weather and we -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- both prefer outdoors.  Yeah, [NOISE] I guess I do.  I really prefer [NOISE] outdoors for, ah, -- for everything.  Um, something -- 
L:  I think --
R:  -- you can only do --
L:  -- we need to move into a tent.
R:  Huh?
L:  We need to move into a tent.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Some things you can only do outdoors, like, ah, dance in the rain.
L:  Like what?
R:  Dancing in the rain.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I like to dance in the rain.
L:  I have done that.
R:  It's hard to find people who like to dance in the rain.  I don't know what it is about rain, but people are like, "Oh, oh, I don't want to get wet".
L:  Well, that's something that you really have to be in the mood to do.
R:  Oh, --
L:  You know, I don't think that's an -- that's an anytime sort of thing.
R:  Oh, I don't know.  If I can find somebody that wants to do it with it me, I'll be in the mood.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]  
R:  I'm all for it.
L:  [NOISE] Well, how old are you?  That might make a difference too, because when I was younger I was much more willing to do it than I am now.
R:  When you were younger.  You don't sound that old.
L:  I'm not that old.
R:  Well, I'm thirty three.
L:  No.  Ha, I'm thirty four. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay.  Well --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- all right, maybe I haven't grown up, I don't know.  I still like to go dancing in the rain.
L:  Well, me, I -- I -- I would still do it, but I -- I don't think I have done it since I was, let's say, twenty seven, something like that.
R:  Oh, a long, long, time ago.  [MN] 
L:  So ...  But, --
R:  [inaudible] for that --
L:  -- um, -- I mean, do you ski, like --
R:  No, I hate skiing.
L:  -- snow ski?
R:  I won't ski.  I would break my leg.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Well, I, ah, -- you know, I -- I've snow skied and it's still [MN] I -- there -- there's nothing that -- [MN] well, put it this way, I would rather do lots and lots more things than I would do that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, um, because [COUGH] I'm [MN] -- I'm -- I'm just a warm weather person. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  I -- I'd rather spend my time outside, where it's -- where it's nice and toasty than, you know, all bundled up [MN], where your range of motion is limited too.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I need to move somewhere where it's nice and warm all year round, like down by you.
L:  Well, I -- I -- I mean, I -- I live here and [NOISE] it's warm almost all year round and I used to live in Clearwater, Florida.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And the weather there is about the same as it is here and -- but it's just -- it's prettier there, much prettier.  I'd move back there if I had the opportunity, you know.
R:  I have a friend --
