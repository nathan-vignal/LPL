L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, I'm Soha[?].
L:  Hi, I'm Samantha.
R:  Hi, Samantha.
L:  How're you doing today?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  I'm good thanks.
R:  That's good.  So, which one do you prefer?  Outdoors or indoors activities?
L:  Mm, for the most part, I prefer things outdoors.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I kinda ... I feel a little cooped up, um ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  But there's like -- today because it was raining -- um, where are you -- where are you located?
R:  Um, I'm actually in southern California, so we have -- we're having really great weather today.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I'm in Philadelphia where it's really rainy.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, and it's -- and it's the beginning of May so we're sort of done with winter --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, emotionally and theoretically, and it's not funny any more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but it's kind of cold and rainy so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] I don't know.  But it was kind of nice actually to, uh, have a day unexpectedly where I would just take, like, sort of doing wintery things like cooking and reading and relaxing as opposed to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- feeling like I need a duty outside.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I actually enjoy, um, indoor, uh, too, or I did and -- until, um -- I have a little daughter and -- and she's just learning to walk and things like that so we go outdoors a lot now.
L:  Ooh.
R:  So, like right now, today, you know, she's in the backyard and I've been taking her to the park and things like that so ... I'm actually starting to enjoy that a little bit more, but before her, I -- I was basically a very much indoor kind of a person.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, if I had the free time I would read or ... watch TV or do something like that.
L:  Hm.
R:  Yeah, but ... I'm not -- like a usually a ca- camping kind of a person or anything like that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, yeah, but with her, because she gets cooped up at home ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I like to take her out --
L:  How old is she?
R:  She's just, um, uh, just barely over one.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  She's like fif- fourteen months.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, yeah.  So, she's, um, you know, walking and things like that so she's really liking it, going outside.
L:  Yeah --
R:  So, uh --
L:  -- being all frisky like one year olds can be.
R:  Pardon?
L:  Them being frisky like one year olds can be.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Yeah, and getting into everything and ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- doesn't want me to help her.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  She thinks she can do it all herself.  [LAUGH] Uh, but it's fun, you know, and, um, [LIPSMACK] so we've been doing that a lot.  That's -- I -- for the most part I enjoy indoors.  I actually like, um, you know, I mean, I like summertime, but I also, like you said, I kind of don't mind it when --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's winter and it's raining and you kinda get --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you have to sp- stay at home to kinda --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know --
L:  Well, summertime in California is kinda -- have you always lived in California?
R:  Yeah, I've always been here.
L:  'Cause I used to think, um, [NOISE] that I was much more of a summertime kind of person ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I used to live in Massachusetts and -- and I loved the summertime and -- and, um, [SIGH] but then I moved to Philly and it's like ... it's -- it's so hot here in the summer that you really can't do -- and it's so muggy and, uh ...
R:  Oh, really?
L:  There's so much you really can't do outside, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, summer used to mean -- and like warm weather to me used to mean, kind of like, upper eighties, maybe some breeze, um ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and, uh, like the ability to go outside, whereas wintertime was just so dark and so cold and -- and it was so much snowing and -- and, um, shoveling all the time that it really -- I didn't enj- you know, it was good for like a month, but it would last from, like, November through -- through April, we'd have like wintertime and ... then I moved to Philly and it was like -- like summertime that you couldn't go outside after June --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- 'cause it was so ... 'cause it's so disgustingly hot and, um --
R:  Really?  I don't know what the weather's like over there.
L:  Really?  Well ... [LIPSMACK]
R:  Really hot?
L:  It's really hot and it's -- there's like no breeze and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it's really humid and, um, I didn't think it was going to be that bad.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, because I was, like, you know, coming from sort of the northeast I figured that, well, Philadelphia's still in the northeast but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's -- haven't -- because of sort of like the currents of air, I don't even know.  I don't think it's Gulf Stream at that point --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, um, you know, because of everything else it was just -- it just gets so ... so muggy, to the point that there's this, um, sort of distinct Philadelphia style ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of, um, guys in particular, will like shave their heads in the summertime --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and walk around with just wet rags on their heads.
R:  Ooh.
L:  It's like not even hats and it's not even like fancy rags --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's just like whatever kind of towel you can have --
R:  Mm, very attractive.
L:  -- you get it wet. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Maybe it's your t-shirt.  Maybe, like, you've taken off your t-shirt --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you've jumped in the fire hydrant and you just walk around in it, and it's funny --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- like, I've never seen that before but ...
R:  That's really weird because I thought California was, you know, has the hottest weather but, I mean, we get really hot during summer.  We get up to like maybe a hundred --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a hundred and ten even sometimes.  And -- but it really kind of rarely gets muggy like that. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I just couldn't stand it if it was like that.
L:  It's dry and --
R:  Uh!
L:  -- what -- what part of California are you in?
R:  Well, I'm in southern California, near, uh, Magic Mountain.
L:  Okay.
R:  I don't know if you're familiar with them?
L:  Um, a little bit.  I've -- I've traveled over there a little bit, um, and --
R:  Yeah.  So, yeah, especially in and out here in -- in this area, it gets really, really hot.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then, um, but it really does not get, you know, um, muggy like that.  Sometimes it does and I just -- I just couldn't stand it if it was always like that.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Because, uh, it's just a ... ooh! [LAUGH]
L:  It's just -- you can't -- you can't even -- you can't breathe ...
R:  Breathe!  Exactly!
L:  You can't, like ... you know, and like I said, I used -- totally used to think I was like a summer person.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, forget about it.
R:  But then you also get --
L:  Gross.
R:  -- like you get your really tough winters, huh?
L:  Yeah, which -- this winter was like really tough.  You know, I'm sort of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hoping that it makes -- that it keeps the summer mild for a while, but like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But for me, the winter -- this -- this winter was sort of what I'm used to expecting from -- from Massachusetts --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I lived in Wolster[?], Massachusetts, which is -- there's some, um -- in western Mass. they have all these -- there're some mountains.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And so for whatever reason, like you get the, um, like the breeze off the ocean and sort of like a salty warmer kind of front comes in off the --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- off the water, 'cause we're about, like, forty five, fifty miles in from the coast and then on the left side you get the ... they're not like huge mountains, but like, you know, the western hills and stuff and when -- when they meet, they -- like, sort of the pressure fronts tend to meet right above Wolster ... [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in the valley there.  So, we get dumped on with snow.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  Like, you know, like whenever you watch the forecast, it'll be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, tell you like ... oh you get like maybe like three inches in Boston and like, you know, two inches in New York, and Wolster --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- will get, like, six inches, like ...
R:  [MN]
L:  So, when Philadelphians are complaining about it this past winter I was like, "Y'all know nothing, like ..." [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, do you ski with ... like with all the snow and everything?
L:  You know, I used to.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, like I used to -- my parents are actually -- they're both teachers.  Um, when we were little, like they've always been really good at like making a buck stretch.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they used to, um, gather students and go skiing with students in the French Alps.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, but they would do it so that, like, you know, if -- if you buy ten tickets, you get one free kinda thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like with all these airlines, so basically we would go skiing through the French Alps for three weeks --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- for -- for like two weeks, for like, six of the years when I was growing up, um --
R:  That's nice. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] it was a pretty good deal, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, and then my dad taught in private school so often he would teach, um, people who had like second homes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and --
R:  Oh, gosh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- so then like we'd go to Vermont and stuff, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so ... here's --
R:  A good deal.
L:  -- my -- my parents, you know, my father had a real salary and my mom just did a lot of tutoring but we'd still --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, vacation like millionaires.  It was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was pretty cool.
R:  Yeah.  Did you -- I know I love it when you get deals like that and ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] It's kinda like --
L:  How about you?  Do you like surf or anything?
R:  Um, no.  I'm here -- I know I live in California but I mean, I love swimming.
L:  Mm.
R:  That's one of my favorite outdoor activities that I do but, um, I don't -- I don't surf.  I -- I don't ever really find it ... like, you know -- I see people doing it and I'm like, "What's the pleasure in that?"  I don't know.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess -- I mean, and you know, it's not like I'm not against speed or anything 'cause, you know, I drive pretty fast [LAUGH] but, um, I don't know.  It just kinda like -- with snowing -- I mean, with skiing and surfing, I just kinda ... maybe with skiing I see a little bit of a -- the pleasure in it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but not with surfing.
L:  See --
R:  But I love swimming.
L:  So, you do ski a little bit?
R:  [MN] No, I don't ski at all.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I don't.  I just -- I just kinda -- you know, when I see people doin' it, I'm like, "Well, you know, I can see how that would be fun" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, I don't -- I don't -- don't myself.  But, um, I just -- I really like swimming and, um, you know, just -- just pretty much going to the beach and, you know --
L:  Yeah.  Ha, that's interesting 'cause, like, I love -- actually I -- I, um, I've spent a lot of time down on the beach and I like swimming is one of my sort of top three favorite activities.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, and when I was in California I just ... um, I'd actually had dreams that I had surfed before, um ...
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- but I'd never actually surfed, but like, I'd had about three dreams where I had surfed and I'd stood up and stuff and ...
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I went to, um, this beach just north of San Francisco, um, when I was up there and I went surfing and, like, it was one of the b- I -- I loved it because it was like swimming except for like you never got cold --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause you were, on ...
R:  Yeah, you're --
L:  -- a wetsuit.
R:  Right.
L:  And you didn't have to worry about jellyfish and --
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- if you got tired you could just float for a while.
R:  And did you -- did you pick it up really easily or --
L:  I did, actually --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- like it was -- it was fairly, um, you know like --
R:  Kinda natural it came to you?
L:  Yeah.  Like, I only went one day but, like, I stood up and like, uh, it felt like the board felt really natural 'cause I'm so comfortable with the water and ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and stuff like that, but ...
R:  Oh.
L:  So, you really ought to try it if you like swimming.
R:  Yeah, you know, I -- maybe I should.  Maybe [LAUGH] I should of, but, um, yeah, I -- I -- I've never tried it.  I -- like I said, I just never saw the -- never saw the attraction in it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Actually, but, um, but you went up north?  Isn't -- aren't the beaches over there kinda rocky and ...?
L:  Um, a lot of them were, um, yeah, but I -- there -- there -- they do have some spots, um ...
R:  Where you can surf --
