L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, this is Ron.
L:  This is Jacob.  How're you doing, Ron?
R:  Pretty good.
L:  All right, so ... you have a lot of friends, Ron?
R:  [LAUGH] Um, I would say so, yes.
L:  Yeah?  More friends than acquaintances?
R:  Uh ... well, it seems to be the people that are my acquaintances are generally my friends as well.  Like, I don't really have ... people that I know that I don't hang out with.  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN] So, I have a few good friends --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then a bunch of, say, peripheral friends and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then maybe a couple of acquaintances. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  How bout yourself?
L:  Uh ... I have very few good friends.  Yeah, it's about the same.  I -- I think I have a -- a wider variety of acquaintances.  Lots of acquaintances, lots of people I, uh ... [LIPSMACK] I know are -- or, you know, sort of know or some- one of my friends knows and who I end up hanging out with, but not necessarily of my own accord.
R:  Um, how bout a -- you guess there are people you work with your friends?  [LAUGH] Or are they your enemies?
L:  What?
R:  People you work with?  Are -- do you consider them your friends or like --
L:  Um ... not really.  I -- just in the -- just when I'm working with them I talk to them but ... outside I -- I -- I don't really.
R:  You think that's just 'cause of your workplace or ...
L:  Uh, well --
R:  -- take it as ...
L:  -- I think it's because they're all considerably older than I am.  Like, the -- the two people I work with closest, one of whom is, uh ... like forty and the other one is maybe fifty.
R:  Yeah, I'm sure [LAUGH] that has a lot -- a lot to do with it.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] so ... you know, I can- -- I mean, I get along fine with them when I'm in working, uh, in my lab but ... when I'm not, you know, I don't really -- really see them at all.
R: Yeah, you wouldn't ne- then you wouldn't -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- hang out [inaudible] of work in other words.
L:  Uh, how 'bout you?
R:  Um, it's different.  Where I work there's a --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- actually the company I used to work for that went out of business, a lot of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- us are still friends even though we've been split up due to layoffs or finding new jobs and that sort of thing, and, uh, we're actually ... it's kinda much like going to college in a way.  We're all like this sort of similar age and ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- kinda bonded as the company ... grew and then fell apart. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, so most people did come along to the new place and -- but in general, the new place I work there is older people there and ... they're pretty cool and stuff but I wouldn't necessarily hang out with them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- outside of work.  Like, the old place I would. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  I mean, are most of your friends from where you used to work?
R:  Excuse me?
L:  Are most of your friends from where you used to work?
R:  Uh, no, that's just like, ah -- I've just made new friends that way.
L:  All right.
R:  I'm guessing to make new friends ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- by work -- meeting people at work or through my --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- older friends I guess you could say.  I generally don't meet somebody and then become their friend, you know, out of the blue.  It's always through somebody else.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or through the workplace.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, well, I don't -- I don't think it is planned I really try to meet anybody new.  I think I've got enough people ...
R:  [LAUGH] Yes.  I just was saying the same thing the other day.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's like, "Hey, you should come meet -- meet so and so, blah, blah, blah.  You need more friends".  I'm like, "Nah, I don't need any more friends". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Ah.  I don't have time to see the people I do know.  I don't really need ...
R:  Yeah, I agree.
L:  -- need more people.
R:  I agree.
L:  Ah.
R:  Um ... [LAUGH] what else can we talk about now? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know.
R:  Uh, that's kinda lame, I think. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Ha- have you done this before?  Is, like, this your first call or ...?
R:  Yes, very first call.
L:  Yeah, mine too.
R:  I said I was available between two and four and they called right at [LAUGH] two o'clock.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  But, uh ... let me think.  What can we -- friends wise.  Yeah, how many friends do you have from, say, being young, like, in high school? [SIGH]
L:  In high school?  Um, I don't think I really have any ... any any more.  All them are -- all of them gradu- graduated a couple of years ago.  I have a lot of friends who are out at college at this point, um, who I see -- or some of them still work in Philadelphia so I see them, and ... others show up occasionally.  You know, like, come down when they feel like it.
R:  Mm.  So, I mean, you're not living -- I mean, your friends from high school, you're just out of touch 'cause of, uh ...
L:  I -- I -- I see them --
R:  -- geography or 'cause of -- you just ...
L:  Well, I mean, I see ... um ... I guess I see -- I have two friends -- at this point I only really have two friends from -- from high school.  I mean, and they're actually earlier than high school.  Um, most of my friends from high school, yeah, I just stopped -- uh, I still see them when I go home, um, which is -- home's in Ohio, but, um ... I don't --
R:  Hold on a second.  My -- uh, my son's dialing so I'll switch over to the other one.
L:  What?
R:  My son's battery's dying.  Hold on.
L:  Oh, all right.
R:  [NOISE] [inaudible]
L:  All right.  Yeah, so, I mean, I see my -- my friends from high school when I go home but ... otherwise, uh, I don't really ever see them.  The other two friends I have, uh, one's gone to New York and one's in Chicago, and then I -- I talk to -- you know, I see the guy in New York a lot more frequently than I do the guy in Chicago and I don't talk to either of them more than maybe once a month, once every other month, but we stay ... more or less in contact.
R:  So, you think, uh, email and stuff like that ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- has, uh, affected the friendships?
L:  Yeah, it definitely helps.
R:  Yeah, I totally agree.  Like, probably half the people I wouldn't necessarily be in constant contact with if it wasn't for email --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause I don't like, uh, call people very often.
L:  Yeah.
R:  On the phone's more ... email conversations or even instant messenger ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even more immediate and actually more fun. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  
R:  It's more like a --
L:  I suppose you can email someone and, you know, get back to -- and they get back to you whenever they feel like so ...
R:  Exactly.
L:  That's, yeah -- definitely more convenient.
R:  I have to s- -- I don't have many friends from high school left although it's more just 'cause we went to college and fell out of touch ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I'm pretty sure that a lot of them, if we got back in touch --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or they move back in the area, we -- we'd become friends, you know, again.  And it's kinda the same with, uh, my college friends.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like I know that, say, I haven't seem 'em in months or talked to them in a month --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when I see 'em, we like pick up where we left off ... you know, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, we see each other at each others weddings and stuff like that and it seems like ...
L:  Yeah, I have that same -- same feeling.
R:  -- the good old days.
L:  It's ni- -- it's nice not having to ... be able to just pick up without having to fill in the details, you know?
R:  Yeah, that's the good thing about email 'cause I really kinda keep in touch and update on people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you see each other.  It's not like you hadn't ... it's more ... oh, no, informal, I guess if you're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in touch with that person through email.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But if you haven't actually been in touch with them then you have to ... catch up with all the ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- stuff and it seems more phony in a way. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, how're you doing and what're you doing these days? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like there's questions that I just, like, kinda sound like the person really doesn't care but feels obligated to ask them.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's nice.  So, you know, when you're ... like there's -- if you see someone all the time and you have to know what's going on with them all the time, if you see someone, you know, once every three months, then, like, where -- where are you right now, what are you doing, sort of covers it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you don't really -- really care about the details [NOISE] of that person's every day of existence, uh ...
R:  Yeah, I agree.  Do you have a best friend?  I don't have a best friend.
L:  Do I have a best friend?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, I have a couple of -- couple of very close friends.  Uh, one of the -- like, this guy who's in Chicago and the guy who's in New York are very close friends and I've got one or two here in -- in, uh, Philly.  How 'bout yourself?
R:  No, I wouldn't say I have a best friend.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, I think that's more ... it seems to be more a female thing than a male thing to have a best friend.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That you confide everything in.  It just dep- -- on certain friends, like, know certain things about me and ... that I would talk to them about and they wouldn't know other things about me and stuff like that.
L:  Mm.
R:  It just seems to be ... uh, whichever friend.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, it's -- doesn't necessarily have to be a guy either.  It can be a girl.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Depends on the situation on who I would call up to talk to [LAUGH] on the phone.
L:  Yeah, now, there are some things that are definitely easier to talk to a ... with girls than with guys.
R:  That's true.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Would you s- -- would you say you split ... male friends, female friends fifty fifty or is it, uh ...?
L:  No, I think it's definitely more male friends than female friends.  Um ... yeah, there are ... I've had female friends in the past who -- uh, it just sort of lose ... um, lose things in common over time.  They just tend to have [inaudible] more in common with them whereas guys all seem to ... probably the same basic ... I don't know how to describe it 'cause the -- the basic trajectory th- that guys follow.  I'm not sure.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I think there's often more, just ... things in common like a lot of times just talking to my friends, I talk about sports --
