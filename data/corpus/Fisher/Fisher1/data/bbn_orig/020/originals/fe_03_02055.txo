R:  Shaun Sarel[?].
L:  Hi, I'm Amy.
R:  Amy.  What's up, Amy? [NOISE]
L:  How you doing?
R:  All right.
L:  [LAUGH]  Um, --
R:  Where you from? [NOISE]
L:  Ah, Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm from Atlantic City. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay.  All right.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] [NOISE]  So what's the topic for today?
L:  Um, warm activ- -- outside activities in warm weather or cold weather.
R:  Oh, they want to know what I like to -- we like to do, ah, -- 
L:  Exactly.  So --
R:  I like warm weather.
L:  Me, too.  Definitely.
R:  Outdoors.  Yeah, 'cause, you know, like down here in Atlantic City it's like, you know, when it gets nice -- like, I'm looking at the weather now on TV.  They said tomorrow it's going to be seventy two degrees.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I know --
L:  So being outside is what --
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  -- right, you could be outside.  And what -- what kind of activities would you -- like, if it were eighty degrees tomorrow what would you do outside? 
R:  Um, [NOISE] let me see what I'd probably do.  Basically to tell you the truth I don't have any money right now. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] And I'm broke right now, but if I were to have some money I'd have probably went to the, ah, boardwalk, walked up and down the boardwalk, probably did a little shopping, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Um, let me see.  Actually, basically what I -- I usually do all the time, 'cause I've only really been out here for, like, nine months, since like last August.
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE]  And I had missed most of the season last year, I only had, like, one month for the season.  I didn't really get a chance to really enjoy myself, but [NOISE], number two, I'm a musician [NOISE] and [inaudible] and I go down to the boardwalk and, you know what I'm saying, watch other acts and stuff, you know.  That's what I probably will be doing if I had the proper equipment and the right, you know, permits to be out there. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm. 
R:  I think that's what I'd probably be doing, like, tomorrow if I -- you know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah, definitely.   
R:  Yeah.
L:  If it were --
R:  Yeah.
L:  If it were that nice I'd probably go outside, um, --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  I like to walk around and get some sun, get some fresh air.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because I work in an office, so I don't get a lot of fresh air during the week.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That would be really great.  And do you do anything like sports wise outside? 
R:  No, I'm not athletic any more because I'm thirty four now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I'm a little older, but it's still guys out there that can really still, you know, get down for playing like basketball and, you know, like, um, baseball and tennis and stuff like that, but I'm not --
L:  Right.
R:  -- really that active like that any more like I was when I was younger.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and I don't really do any, you know, like activities like that any more.  I might go watch a game if they're having one or something.
L:  Right.
R:  Or maybe when its -- I'm the -- I'm the more type of guy I like to fish, stuff like that.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, that's nice to do --
R:  Yeah.  So, like --
L:  -- in the summer time -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that would be good to do down in Atlantic City. 
R:  Well, -- yeah, like I went fishing, ah, it was nice, like, -- do you remember that day it was really nice like two weeks ago? 
L:  Ahah.
R:  It was real nice out and I think it was like eighty degrees that day.  It was like --
L:  Right, yeah.  We had a couple of really nice days.
R:  I went fishing that day but I didn't catch anything because the water temperature is not warm enough, you know what I'm saying, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for the fish to really bite yet. 
L:  Yeah.  What kind of --
R:  So I got to wait -- huh?
L:  What kind of fish are there when it's really cold? 
R:  Um, um, right now they, like, -- fish bite, like, they've got, like, certain fish, like, bite certain times of the year.  Like certain flounder they call winter flounder which is called fluke.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that bites during the winter.  Mostly this time of year, but I think they like to be in little warmer -- more of a warmer type of water, you know what I mean?
L:  Right, right.
R:  But it's still -- the water is still cold right now and it's not really going to really catch anything right now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Unless you go up near, um, [MN] like, -- like, right now the stripers are, um, spawning right now up in, um, Cornicks[?] Point, like Salem County area. 
L:  Okay.
R:  In New Jersey, and then like Chester area over that way.  Like, Delaware County, like over that way.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And then over like, you know, like they go up and down the Delaware River, they come up and spawn.  That's the only way -- that's where they're mostly at right now.
L:  Right.
R:  Were they're striking bass, but as far as like the fish game and stuff in Atlantic City, ain't nothing really, you know, happening right here.  Too tough right now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You've got to go up that way where they're spawning and where they -- you know what I'm saying -- where they're hibernating -- not hibernating but, [MN] what, I mean, --
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, they're mating right now and they're laying eggs and they get hungry and they're easier to catch.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  So that's what I like to do, I like to do that, you know.
L:  Yeah.  I like to come down to the beach a lot in the summer time and just relax and swim or --
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I did that --
L:  Or run on the boardwalk.
R:  Yeah, I did that last year and I first moved down here -- see, I'm originally from Penns Grove.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Ah, in Salem County, New Jersey. 
L:  Yep, I know where it is, mhm. 
R:  You know where I'm saying, home town of Bruce Willis.
L:  Oh, really?  I didn't know that.
R:  Yeah, that's where he from.  I used to --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- live right behind his father.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, um, -- yeah, but, um, anyway, um, [MN] yeah, I used to come down here from Penns Grove, I used to come down here, like, all summer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I kind of was like, "Oh, wow, I like Atlantic City.  It's, like, real exciting", you know, seeing they have a lot of outdoor activities to do here.  You know, you can swim.
L:  Right.
R:  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You can, um, -- you can boat, you can fish, you know, that's -- there's a lot of things to do here in the summer time.
L:  Yeah, there are.
R:  When like -- yeah, there's a lot of things to do here or you can gamble which is an indoor activity, but ... 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah, I did that but I kind of fell in love with the place, but ... 
L:  Yeah, it's really nice.  Now, do you do anything in the winter time, like, outside, like skiing or anything like that? 
R:  No, I don't do nothing in the winter time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just -- just, like, try to work whatever, 'cause there's going to be nothing to do.  Like, if I had the equipment like snow mobiles and skis and stuff like that.
L:  Right.
R:  I would probably do it.
L:  Right.
R:  But I don't have that kind of money and that kind of equipment, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  See, I don't really -- I'd much rather, like, given the choice, be outside in the warm rather than -- skiing like I've been but I don't really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I wouldn't prefer it, I'd rather be in the hot weather sitting on the beach somewhere and doing something like that.
R:  Right.  So that you like to swim?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I guess if its, like, um, if it's really cold outside I'd be inside and go to the gym or do something indoor like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like work out, kind of something like that.
R:  Oh, so they say we can talk about indoor and stuff, too?
L:  Yeah, indoor or outdoor activities, ahah.
R:  Oh.  Yeah.  Ah, yeah, well, I like to -- let me see what I like to do indoors.  Well, gambling is, ah, an indoor activity, right? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, sure. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I like to do that.
L:  Ahah.
R:  Yeah.  What part of Philadelphia are you from? 
L:  Um, Old City.
R:  Old City, yeah.  I think I heard that on TV one time.
L:  Yeah, ahah.  Yeah.
R:  -- on the news. 
L:  Yeah, yep.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but there's a lot of stuff to do out here, too, outside.  There's like, there's Fair -- Fairmont Park or or, um, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm near Penns Landing, so --
R:  You know what I like to do when I come to Philly?
L:  What's that? 
R:  I like to go to the, um, to the, um, trails up in the mountains, like, in Fairmont Park doing trails --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you go down -- up and down and stuff.
L:  Yeah, there're a lot of trails.
R:  Oh, I love that.
L:  Yeah, you can ride a bike or just walk around.  That's --
R:  Yeah, and you just --  
L:  That's really nice.
R:  -- we walk like in the woods and just walk all up and down.  I mean, it was so fun.
L:  Yeah.  I think -- I heard that that's, like, huge -- it's the biggest park in the whole country.
R:  For real?
L:  That's -- it's the biggest park that's located in a big city.
R:  For real?
L:  In the US, yeah.  It's -- It's really big --
R:  Oh, 'cause --
L:  It's like twenty -- I forget how many square miles, but it's really huge.  So ...
R:  Get out of here.  It's bigger --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- than, um, that park in New York, Central Park?
L:  Yeah, well, that's what I didn't understand but I guess -- I guess so, yeah. 
R:  What, Fairmont Park is bigger than that? 
L:  Well, that's what it said, that it's the biggest park located in the city, so I guess it is bigger than Central Park.
R:  It must be 'cause Central Park don't have all them trails and stuff like that I don't think.
L:  Oh, that's true, yeah.  It's more just like grass.  There's not --
R:  They -- yeah, they weren't -- it's like a flat, you know what I'm saying?
L:  -- you can't really go hiking or something.  Right.
R:  Their park is like, more like just flat straight out.
L:  Right.
R:  They don't have like all them mountains and all that stuff and, like, Fairmont Park is awesome.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They've got the trails you go down, then they've got the plateau and all that stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Man, that's cool.
L:  Yeah, it's really good.  Plus they have like you can take your -- if you had a dog you could take dogs there.
R:  Ahah.
L:  Um, or I think you could -- there's even places you can roller blade.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Stuff like that.  But, um, it's tough.  I used to like to roller blade a lot in the summer time when I was --
R:  Oh, you like to roller blade?
L:  Well, I used to but then, um, it's -- you can't do it on the boardwalk down there.
R:  Yeah, you can.
L:  You can?
R:  Yeah, there's guys roller skating with their roller blades and stuff.  You're talking about those skates with the -- the straight wheels on it?
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Yeah, they was -- they been doing that. [NOISE].  Yeah, you can do anything down there now.  Now they even allow you to have alcohol in the boardwalk as long as it's in a cup. 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I -- did they just make a change this summer, like, um, --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- at the casinos they can -- you can serve alcohol on the beach now? 
R:  Yeah.  They can serve --
L:  Is that new this year?
R:  Huh?
L:  Did they just do that?  Did they just change that?
R:  Yeah, they passed that law, like, during the winter time.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  Yeah, so now this year you can bring your drinks, people can bring their drinks out there and everything, they can't do nothing to you, but it's got to be in a cup.
L:  Oh, okay.  Not, like, a bottle.
R:  Yeah, you can't, like, drink it out the -- straight out the can, you got to, like, pour it into a cup, though. 
L:  Oh, okay.  No --
R:  See, before they didn't allow you to have it there at all, you know what I'm saying?
L:  Right.  Can you have it on the boardwalk, too? 
R:  Yeah, you can have them anywhere from the boardwalk on towards the water.
L:  Oh, my God.  That's great, I didn't know that.  
R:  Yeah, mhm, but you can't have it, like, anywhere from the boardwalk towards the blo- -- the city blocks, they don't allow that.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But you can have it from all the way down here from where the boardwalk begins all the way to where it ends.
L:  Ahah.
R:  From the, um, from the board walk on to the water they can't do nothing to you.
L:  Oh, wow.  That's cool.  I didn't know.
R:  But it's got to be -- it's got to be in a cup.
L:  Good.
R:  Yeah.  How old are you, Nancy, Marie, what's your name again?
L:  Amy.
R:  Amy, how old are you?
L:  Twenty seven.
R:  Oh, you're twenty seven?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  What was your name again?
R:  Shaun. 
L:  Shaun, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, how about stuff like --
