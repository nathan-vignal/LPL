R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  H- hi.  My name's Gina. 
R:  Hi, Gina.  I'm Rose -- 
L:  In -- 
R:  -- in Portland, Oregon.
L:  Okay.  I'm in, ah, -- just right outside of Dallas, Texas.
R:  Oh, okay.  Is it warm down there?
L:  Yes, it is.  It's been --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- eighty something.  [LAUGH]
R:  Not fair.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's kind of -- it's -- it's been wet up here [LAUGH] and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and kind of chilly tonight.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  Oh.
R:  Okay -- 
L:  A -- 
R:  -- ah, let's see, our topic is, um, corporate -- the corporate, um, --
L:  I kind of missed part of it.
R:  Yeah, I did too.  Well, I missed it at the beginning, but I think they were talking about, oh, what the government can do to, um, clean up the corporate scandals that are going on [PAUSE] with the --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- different corporations, [MN] which is --
L:  Well, --
R:  -- a real good question.  [LAUGH]
L:  It is a good question.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  
L:  Yeah, because -- I don't know, everybody complains that the government's dipping their fingers in where they don't belong anyway -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it seems like, but -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that is really a good question.
R:  [MN] Maybe it's --
L:  Any ideas?
R:  -- not so much -- it -- maybe it's not so much that the government needs to clean up the corporations as the corporations need to clean house.
L:  Exactly.
R:  They need to be accountable.  Well, the governments need to be accountable to the people too. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But they need to be accountable to their stockholders and the -- the people that use their products.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] [inaudible].
L:  Like maybe the higher up should have a little more standards than they do.
R:  Yeah, just because they can --
L:  You know, as f- -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- as far as accountability.
R:  [NOISE] You know, just because they can get away with it doesn't mean that they necessarily, you know, have to, until they get caught.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [MN] I don't know.  I -- I don't know how the government could possibly, ah, [PAUSE] make them conform or make them be accountable.   
L:  You've got me on this one.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it -- it's --
L:  Yeah, it --
R:  -- you know, I mean, [MN] --  
L:  [MN] I'm not even sure what to say.  Um, -- [PAUSE] 
R:  [inaudible].
L:  I don't know, they -- they've got all this CEO talk going on right now, you know.  Some of them have quit and some of them have been, ah, -- I don't guess they said fired, maybe let go or -- or whatever, but --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, usually their let go, though, they're let go with the, um, [NOISE] -- with all these, um, little benefits that --
L:  Benefit.
R:  -- they go with. 
L:  Yes, -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and these huge severance pay checks.
R:  [NOISE] Right; and -- 
L:  And -- 
R:  -- it's all written in their contracts that they get these huge +severance pays.
L:  Mhm.  Maybe they should be more -- more like y- your regular everyday employee, you know.  You -- you -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- don't get anything more than what you have coming to you.  [PAUSE] 
R:  Yeah, that --
L:  I -- I -- I [MN] --
R:  -- would be nice.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know.  That -- that's --
R:  [MN]
L:  That's a really good question.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] I guess the -- the account -- well, [NOISE] you know, I mean, we have the securities commissions and everything an- and they didn't seem to notice when the stock was going crazy and -- and it wasn't making sense [PAUSE], or I guess -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they had enough ways of --
L:  They're --
R:  -- fooling them into making them believe that it made sense. 
L:  Yeah, it -- it almost seems like there's just enough loopholes for the higher ups, the more important people, you know, the [PAUSE] -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I -- I don't know.  Um, -- 
R:  Maybe we need to eliminate the loopholes, government needs to [PAUSE] make the -- the rules that apply to one apply to all without any exceptions.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So that they don't have these little, you know, loopholes to go through [inaudible].
L:  Right. 
R:  Make -- start making corporate America pay taxes in America and not have little offshore companies all over the place.  [MN]
L:  Yes.  There you go.
R:  To stash their profits.  [NOISE] [SIGH] Instead of making -- instead of making us poor pe- -- m- -- people in the middle having to pay all the taxes.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH]  Yeah, I guess that's -- that's just -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- not a subject -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I know a whole lot about.  Um, I'm one of the ones in the middle.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  So am I.
L:  I know.
R:  One of those that -- that does a lot of the paying and that's about it.  [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  It -- it's amazing with the recession going on that's going on and, um, you know, I -- it [MN] -- they don't seem to be making any sense with what they want to do or what th- they can do and all this trickle down again where, okay, the guys on top get the break so that the money will just kind of trickle down to the bottom.  [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  Okay, yep, sure.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  That's almost going to happen.  [PAUSE] 
L:  But -- I don't know.  I was trying to think how the government might be able to do something about it.  Um, [NOISE] [PAUSE] I don't know, you know, without just actually stepping in and saying, "Okay, well, this is how it's going to go," but I think maybe the -- some of the sa- same things that we've just mentioned [MN] might be going on in the government too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You know, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I think they have these large severance pay and what have you, you know, going on too.
R:  They sure do.  [MN] Now, it w- -- it seems to me that the government was never set up to be, um, a full time job.  A senator or a representative was never supposed to be a full time job.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or a career.  It was something that, you know, you went in and you did your term and you went back to your other life.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Instead of making it a career, you just keep doing the government stuff. 
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I would say accountability is probably the biggest thing that -- that they would probably need to do, but how they would do that, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  [PAUSE]  Yeah, I -- you know, if -- if -- well, I'm sure that, no matter what, somebody's going to find a way to get around the edges here, there and the other, and if they find a way they're going to use it.
L:  Oh, yes, I think that's going to happen no matter where you're at, at the bottom or in the middle or at the top.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.
L:  You know.  That's just kind of a standard for some people, I guess: [PAUSE] if this doesn't work for me, let me find a way around it.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  [MN] And I know -- I -- I know some people that were really hit hard with -- with the, um, -- the way the ta- -- the -- you know, the -- the stock market has just fallen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And of course there's a lot of people out there that were paper millionaires [inaudible] overnight with the stock market, and the next thing you know they were paupers, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.
R:  [MN] Unfortunately they took it all to ha- -- I -- you know, I mean, [MN] as far as I'm concerned, the stock market is kind of, um, -- you know, you -- you put some money in, you do your 401K and you just forget it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because it's not really there.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  As it goes up and down, and you just hope you'll have more -- more when y- -- when it gets time for you to retire than what you put in.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH]  Yeah. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] [PAUSE]  Mm.
R:  [NOISE]  
L:  Is --
R:  But I --  
L:  -- is this your first call or --  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or have you had several calls?
R:  Um, this is my second one that I've done. 
L:  Ahah.
R:  Um, --
L:  This is my four- --
R:  They've tried to --
L:  I'm sorry, go ahead.
R:  Ah, they tried to call me a couple of times, but my shifts have been changed and I've got my cell phone number in there and so I can't carry it with me --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when I'm working, so ...
L:  Well, this is my fourth phone call, and I have to say this is the one that has stumped me.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  On my other three it was like we just talked and talked and talked and all of a sudden the time was up but it's like I wasn't done talking.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Yeah, this -- it's -- it's --  
L:  Th- this one is --
R:  -- it's just a real hard subject, um, to try to come up with.  [PAUSE]
L:  Yes, and --
