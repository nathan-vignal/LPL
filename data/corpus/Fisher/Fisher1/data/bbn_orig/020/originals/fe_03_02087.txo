L:  Hi, my name is Jody.
R:  Hi, I'm Anne.
L:  Hi, it's nice to meet you.
R:  Um, what was the -- I couldn't hear the whole topic.
L:  It's, um, on friends.  If you have just a few close friends or if you have a lot of friends or if you just mainly have acquaintances and --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and one best fr- friend.  Uh --
R:  Uh --
L:  I'm --
R:  I -- go ahead.
L:  Oh, okay, I'm sorry.  [LAUGH] I think I fit into the latter part.  One really best friend and then a lot of acquaintances, but, um, I'm the type of person that can [NOISE] -- will help or do things for [NOISE] just about anyone -- I'm sorry, my son's friend ... um, and, um, so ... I can make friends easily but they're not real close friends.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um [NOISE] --
R:  I think that happens as we get older too, you know.  It seems harder, um, the older I get to, um, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- keep the ... best friend that maybe you had for a long time and it seems like you can't -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the relationships don't get as close as they did when we were younger.
L:  Right.  I think --
R:  You have less time for friends [LAUGH] ... that's what I find.
L:  I think [NOISE] -- I think it's harder to -- I'm sorry.
R:  That's okay.
L:  I think that it's harder to, um, keep friends in this day and age and [NOISE] close friends because life is just so hectic --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [NOISE] and you're ... and you're trying to, um, do things with your family.  Get, you know, your life in order and it seems like a day's gone before you realize that you can't even keep in touch with anyone.
R:  Right.  
L:  So --
R:  I know and, um, with us, we move a lot but I know that, like, I have -- I have three very close friends that, um, no matter where I move ... I've always been in touch with them and, um, even if we're not in the same State for a while or whatever, we -- you know, we talk on the phone at least once a month and it seems like our friendship never changes and when we do get together it seems like we've been together every day, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because we have so much in common.  And then other than that, I feel like everybody else is just kinda acquaintances, coming and going and, you know ...
L:  Right.  That's basically how it is with -- except I've stayed in the same place and my friends have moved.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And so it's like I've been in the same town for almost thirty years and it's just like ... everyone else moves away and we -- um, [LIPSMACK] we keep in contact somewhat.  The ones that I keep in closest contact with seem to be the ones that ... are like sisters, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  They, um, they're really only two that I've kept in such close contact with that it hasn't -- there hasn't been a lull in our relationship and then one that has stayed living here in town with me so she's over at my house every weekend and it just -- and we do anything for each other and ... if I have a problem with my children I know she'll take care of it, if I can't.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh ...
R:  Yeah, I, um -- that's how it is.  I usually find, um [SIGH] well, we do move a lot and so when we get into a new -- new area, you know, it usually takes me ... about, maybe six to eight months, sometimes a year, to really develop a close friend in town that, you know, like you're together with all the time and you know, watch each other's kids and, you know, do things together and so forth.  And then we end up moving.  [LAUGH] And I usually keep in touch with that person for probably about a year afterwards and then it seems like it just fizzles, but then I have these lifelong friends who, you know, I've spent, you know, like my friend that we went to missionary training school together and we lived together for several years and -- and we talk on the phone every single month and we see each other maybe every two years but we're just so close because we went through so much together for such a long time.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I know that I always have those lifelong friends that I can call, you know, and that I have a very close family so my sisters are always around, but, um, as far as, you know, [LIPSMACK] making friends and holding friends and best friends and stuff, seems like I have a long list of ... [LAUGH]
L:  Right, best [inaudible] --
R:  [inaudible] most are former friends. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  That's very interesting because I have, um, four brothers and two of 'em I'm very close to and we do things together all the time.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  More so than I would would friends, you know, outside the family friends.
R:  Right.
L:  And because I consider them as two of my best friends ...
R:  Right.
L:  And, um ... this girl that I went to college with was like, "Your brothers can't be your friends" [LAUGH] and I was like, they are the people that are always there for you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, your brothers are your protective, you know -- they are protectors.  They protect you no matter what, you know?  It doesn't matter if the person picking on your is twenty times their size, they're going to ... defend you so ...
R:  I never had a brother.  I had four sisters. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] Yeah, I always wanted a sister.  They'd, um ... I guess that's ... why they, um, girls that I did stay close to ... um ... they're families were similar to mine so it was like and they became close to my parents so it was like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we were sisters.  They ...
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  And they don't have sisters.  They have brothers also [LAUGH] so ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I just -- you're kind of attracted to the same kinda people ... or, you know, like ... you're family members or yourself.
R:  Right.  People who have the same kinda, uh, values and ideas and ...
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, I tend to look for, um, you know, to spend time with people that raise their children the same way as I do.
L:  Yeah, right. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, so then we all -- well, 'cause I have four, and when we're all, you know --
L:  I do too. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, do you?
L: Yeah. 
R:  And, uh, so when we get together and stuff, you know, on a ... it's hard if you get together with someone -- the [inaudible] don't last as long if they're raising their children extremely different than yours, you know?
L:  Or if they don't have children.
R:  Oh, yours don't have children?
L:  No, I'm saying -- oh they -- they don't -- like one of my friends --
R:  Oh, right, or if they don't have children?
L:  Yeah.  Like, my very best friend, she doesn't have children but she treats my children like hers and she knows what my values are and she's not going to talk against those.
R:  Right.
L:  They -- there are people that I've befriended and I thought we could be good friends, but my children have got in -- in the way.  It's in their viewpoint --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because they didn't have kids and so ... they were jealous of my kids because they were taking me away from that relationship.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, you know, so ... and the ...
R:  And I know children take a lot of time, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  So, I'm not as free as others to get together and do, you know ... can't get together with friends as often --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when you have smaller children.
L:  And it's, um, like playgroups and stuff like that are really cool because then you can see other people in your same situation.
R:  Right.
L:  You can ... and they may just stay acquaintances.  They -- they're still acquaintances that you can kinda -- you can talk to and relate to on -- on that -- those grounds ... you know?
R:  This is true, yeah.  I -- yeah, some of my good friends that ... I've met in playgroup and then in church.  I've spent a lot of [LAUGH] time in church nursery. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, that well [LAUGH] and it's because your kids are all the same age so ... you're going to be able to communicate better that way.
R:  Right.
L:  So, are you ... is your family in the military or what do you --
R:  No, we just move a lot. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  We get asked that often but we just -- we just move a lot for different opportunities and ...
L:  Right.
R:  Seems like we come back and forth to Chicago though.  We spent quite a bit of time in Chicago.  That's where I'm from.  But we've also lived in Indiana, Virginia, Texas.  I lived in Mexico for a while so I --
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  A lot of -- lot of the stuff I did is, um, I moved because we were working with the missions organization so I do a lot of traveling within that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and now, um ... and since then my h- -- my ex-husband, well, he was pursuing, you know, the corporate ladder and so we moved for better opportunities several times, and now I'm back in Chicago with my kids so --
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  -- starting over. [LAUGH]
L:  -- my husband -- yeah [LAUGH] my husband grew up in military so he got to move around a lot, but that kind of -- now he wants to stay stationed and I'm like, "Oh, but it would be so cool to go see this or that" so [LAUGH] he's already gone and seen it so ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, he's probably burned out.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  There's, uh, 'cause there are other times, you know, just like the friend thing for me, I tend to make friends extra easier than my children because I'm more open and I'm just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, I'm just -- I want friends, I'm gonna pursue friends and that's the way it is, you know?  I -- I feel like if you show yourself friendly, you will always have friends.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, but now, like, my son, he's very quiet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, he has a harder time making friends and it seems like every time he finally gets a really good friend we move.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so I do see that we need to -- I mean, he's thirteen now and I do think we really need to ... I need to settle down for the rest of their, you know -- for the rest of their -- their years and let them have some stability because we are constantly moving and -- and then they -- you know, they make friends and they lose their friends quickly.
L:  Do you think that has anything to do with the media, um, talking a lot about stranger danger and things like that and --
