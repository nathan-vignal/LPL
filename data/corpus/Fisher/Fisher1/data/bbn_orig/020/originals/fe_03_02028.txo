L:  Yeah, just a minute. [inaudible]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  [MN] Hello, my name is Lisa.
L:  Hi, my name is Suzanne.  How are you?
R:  Hi Suzanne.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um, what sorts of uh, do you, do you prefer indoor or outdoor activities?
L:  Actually, both, depending.  I have to choose one? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no, no, I don't believe so. [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, [MN] um, when, um, well, let's talk about outdoor activities for a moment, and um, when you do outdoor activities, um, do you prefer warm weather or cold weather activities?
L:  Actually right now, I live in Florida, but I really like the cold weather.
R:  Oh, really?  Um, ...
L:  Much better.  Because well, what I think is that um, in the hot weather, it's so hot here sometimes that you can never take enough clothes off to keep yourself cool.
R:  Right.
L:  But while you are in, in the cool weather, you know, you can just dress appropriately to keep warm.
R:  That's true, you can always add clothes. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  You know, so ...
R:  Um, did, did you, when you lived, um, elsewhere, or when you travel, do you do things like skiing, or other sorts of ...
L:  No, I've never skied, but I just like, you know, going out, shopping --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- just walking, or, I like walking.  I walk a lot.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  So that's basically what I do.  Um, in outdoor activities, I actually do golfing. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, golfing. [MN] Yeah, I have a, yeah.
L:  I, I, I enjoy golf.
R:  Um, I've never, I've never golfed, I do a lot of walking myself.  
L:  Mhm.  
R:  So I, I just ah, I, I prefer it when it's, when it's cool.  
L:  Yeah, it's nice when it's cool.  
R:  But not, you know, when it's cool it, like, hurts your lungs to breathe and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  When it's too hot, I just [MN] don't want to really be outside.
L:  You don't want to do anything, exactly.  The only weather that I really don't like is when it's raining.
R:  Yes, that makes --
L:  That's --
R:  -- it difficult.
L:  That's the only thing.  And here, it thunders and it's lightning.
R:  Mhm.
L:  In Florida --
R:  Mhm.  
L:  -- we get lots of lightning strikes.
R:  Oh.
L:  All the time.  And just like today, it's lightning.  [LAUGH] And the lightning sounds like thunder. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But it's actually lightning.
R:  That can get dangerous as well.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  Um, I'm in the mid-west.
L:  Oh.
R:  So we, we have it, but not quite that bad.  Um, --
L:  Yeah, it's [inaudible]
R:  -- I used to live on the east coast, so I know what it's like to have like hurricane season and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [MN] I used to --
L:  It's worse in Florida.  Hm?
R:  I used to work as a geologist, so I spent lots of time outside. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And um, it didn't, of course, depending on what I was working on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it didn't matter what the temperature was, I had to be there. [LAUGH]
L:  You had to be out there.  Oh.
R:  Um, but ah, so that was one part of it [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- pardon me,  I didn't really like. 
L:  Right.  Oh, boy.  Um.
R:  Um.
L:  Also with, with outside, I'd like beaches.  Do you do beaches as well?
R:  Oh, [MN] yes, actually that's the one thing I miss a lot about living on the coast.  Um, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [MN] land locked right now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And um, yes I um, actually I grew- I was actually raised on the east coast.  So --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I have a lot of memories of childhood, going to the beaches.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And um, that's something that I miss and always do when I travel back.
L:  Yeah, when it's hot, I love being in the beaches.  You know, nice and relaxing, you just can look at the waves, even if you're just laying on the, you know, on the beach, you could be somewhere and just looking at the water.
R:  Right.
L:  I just love looking at the water.  I love water sports also, I love boating. [MN] And um, just little things.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  I uh, yeah I'm not a, I'm not a very strong swimmer --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in spite of the fact that I grew up, um, near the ocean. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so did I, I'm not really uh, such a good swimmer.  I grew up on the islands, which is, you know, lots of water.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, but I love, I love it, I love being out there.  But I will not really get that, you know, not a really strong swimmer, but um, I could save myself.  You know what I mean?
R:  Mhm, mhm, right.
L:  Yeah, I like things like that.
R:  Um, I did a --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- do you have your, your own boat that you --
L:  We used to.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We used to.  No longer. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's, that's --
L:  So, that's, that's part of a [inaudible] kill, we don't do that any more.  My son loves going fishing, um, he loves fishing.  So --
R:  I used to go fishing a lot myself.
L:  Mhm.
R:  When I was, even when I was very young --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with my, with my father, who introduced it to me.
L:  Yeah, I used to do that with my dad when I was little.  And right now, my son loves doing it.  My husband doesn't like it that much, but his grandfather loves taking him fishing.  His great-grandfather, [several inaudible words]
R:  Oh.
L:  And they love going fishing together.  You know, they'd catch these little things and he want to cook it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] And I lived um, on a lake, and he would always go throwing his line, and he would catch fish.  I caught one once, a tiny one, but he catches these nice big ones.  But we throw them back, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  But I'm always afraid of them. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because they wiggle and moving so much.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  I actually um, I like salt water fishing, ocean fishing.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I don't like lake or fresh water --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- fishing at all, it's just not as --
L:  That's it, I do too, but it so happens we live right there. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  We are fortunate to live on the lake, so he got to play fishing, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They weren't edible, they like, catch them then throw them back.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  Right.  Yeah, I prefer the ones that we were able to catch and then eat, like, blue fish or black fish or [inaudible] on the [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, I used to get, I caught well, when I was growing up and we would go fishing, everyone would catch fish and I, once, I caught a tiny, tiny one.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, you know I was so proud of that little fish.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I have, we, we kept it, but it was, you know, that was the height of my, you know, experience.  That was the best thing that I did.  And I always talk about it, because it was, you know, my, my, what I did, you know.  So ...
R:  Right, right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well some people say that ah, that women are bad luck for fishing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That we, we cause, [LAUGH] we bring the men down. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  A woman's on a boat, that's gonna be a bad fishing day. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really, well ...
R:  That's the, that's the old folklore, [LAUGH] I guess.
L:  Oh, I, I just love, I didn't care, as long as my father and they were there, and I am with them, I was happy to do anything.
R:  Right.  
L:  You know?  So just the one little one I caught was fine. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, same, same here. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  We, I also enjoy, like, camping and stuff.  Do you do camping?
R:  Um, you know, I, in spite of the fact that I'm, a geologist --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- even though I'm not working as one right now, I really don't like it. [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  And not my, I mean I've done it many times, some of it by necessity.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause I had to stay in the field.  
L:  Oh, --
R:  But um, I just, I just you know, don't, I often don't like the bugs and the everything else that goes along with it, I'd just rather be home in my bed.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  But it's fun, we found that, you know, we did a few camping, so, we didn't do any last year, yeah we did one last year, um, I was pregnant with my baby.
R:  [MN]
L:  And I still went.  
R:  Wow.  
L:  'Cause my um, son's grandparents, you know, they want him to get into this, 'cause my, my husband used to do it when, you know, he was younger.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So they're like, oh, this is something good, experience, good experience now, so we should take him camping.
R:  Right.  
L:  [MN] And the very first time that I did it, we all went like an eight man tent.
R:  Mhm.
L:  There was like, six, three, five of us, in that one tent.
R:  Oh.
L:  And it rained the whole weekend.
R:  Oh, no. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That was my first experience, I'm like these guys want me to come back? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, the first time I did it, but it was fun, it ended up being really, really fun.  We did um, things on the lake, we do those streams, and they did canoeing, and [MN] um, that rubber tube, and snorkeling and stuff like that.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Even in the rainy weather.
R:  Wow, that's great.
L:  You know?  It ended up being fun, so I didn't mind doing it another time. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Maybe I would like it more if I got to do more activities like that.  We didn't do any sort of --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- canoeing or snorkeling.  That --
L:  Yeah well --
R:  -- makes it even more exotic.
L:  Exactly, it was fun.  So, [MN] I enjoyed, I enjoy stuff like that, it ended up being really something that I wouldn't mind doing.  The second time I went with them, we had two bigger tents this time, and they put an air-conditioned unit in the tent. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so we had an air-conditioned unit in the tent, so it made it so much more like home.
R:  [LAUGH] That's great.
L:  You know?  Everyone was looking at our tents with envy. [LAUGH]
R:  I didn't, I didn't even know there was such a thing. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, we brought a whole big unit. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's great.
L:  You know, so, it was fun.  And um, well we have fun everywhere.  I don't like bugs.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Even though I'm out there, I'm still afraid of the bugs and all that.
R:  Right.  Um, --
L:  We had fun. And [inaudible] it was like home. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Um, have, were, were you in an area remote enough that at, at night you saw a lot of stars?
L:  Oh, yeah, we got to see the stars, and a lot of trees.  Actually here in Florida, we did like Blue Springs State Park.
R:  Okay.
L:  We did John Springs, John, uh, Prince Park.  And, we did that twice, and then they went to North Carolina up in the mountains, which I think was fun. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  And we have to do it again this year, they want us to, to come up with [several inaudible words], and they want us to come up and do the mountains again.
R:  Oh, that's, that's great.
L:  You know, 'cause it's gonna, it's gonna be nice and cool up there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, so, it will be fun.
R:  That's a good experience.  I, um, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I --
L:  It was good for the kids. 
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Yeah.  Really fun.
R:  More recently I've been doing, I after the geology, I did more astronomy sorts of things.  
L:  Mm.
R:  They're somewhat related, so --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So um, one big part of me.  Being outside is, if I have a good clear view [LAUGH] of the sky.
L:  Yeah, I always wanted to do --
