R:  Hi, my name is Carla.
L:  Hi, my name is Donna.  How are you? 
R:  I'm good.  And you? 
L:  I'm fine, thank you.  How do you like this weather? 
R:  Well, the weather where I am is actually very, very nice right now outside.  I've been enjoying being outside and -- and, ah, taking [MN] advantage of it, um, trying to -- to walk and go and feed the ducks.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's really been beautiful.
L:  Oh, well, the weather over here's kind of -- it's been raining off and on.  I did go out and enjoy -- ah, it was kind of sunshiny for a little while this morning.  I went out and I enjoyed a -- ah, a walk.  It was very nice out.  But now it's starting to rain.  It will stop and start again.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I like -- I don't like hot weather, I don't like cold weather.  I think I like it in between, you know, like the spring and the fall.
R:  Oh, absolutely, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That's my kind of weather.
R:  Yeah, where I'm from -- where I'm from here it's really -- it's [MN] -- it -- it gets really, really cold in the winters, like for about --
L:  Where are you calling --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- from.
R:  Oh, I'm -- I'm from, um, -- I'm calling from Minnesota.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm from --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  So, we've got this --
R:  Yeah, so you're pretty --
L:  -- funny weather.  [LAUGH] We've got this funny weather going.  And usually [LIPSMACK] when it's nice outside I wal- -- I -- I go -- I walk -- I like to walk, and I walk around and window shop and sometimes I sit outside and read, you know, if the weather permits.
R:  So, you take your -- your -- your indoor activity and bring it outside, your -- your reading.
L:  Well, I read everywhere.  It doesn't matter where I'm --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  I love to read.  I read anything.
R:  I love to read too.
L:  I'm a -- ah, I like romantic novels, but I -- I can read anything.  [PAUSE]
R:  That's great.  That's -- that's my -- that's one of my favorite things to do, um, for at least, um, -- you know, an indoor activity when it's not so nice outside or you really can't get out.
L:  Right.
R:  To be able to just -- I mean, to go to the book store and just be able to sit in there and -- and read through the magazines.  Like, where I work, I work at the Mall of America.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, they have a book store in there downstairs, and it's a really big Barnes and Noble and it's really nice to just sit in there.
L:  Oh, yeah, I haven't been in Barnes and Noble in a long time, but I noticed that they have a lot of great books in there.  I went with my mom last summer and they have a lot of -- or what -- we found a book store.  We went out a couple of Satur- -- a couple of Mondays ago and it was really nice outside and we went to -- they have this new book store.  It's like -- and they have so many books and they were all really, really reas- -- it's like a discount book store.
R:  Wow, yeah.
L:  It -- it's really great.  They had all kinds of books in there.  It was really great, and we plan on going back again because they had so many varieties and, like, you -- if you go to a normal book store you pay like for, ah, um, some books ten, twelve dollars and they were like three fifty.
R:  Wow.
L:  Oh, they had so many nice --
R:  Really.
L:  -- books in there.  [MN]
R:  That's really good because -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's so expensive and you can't always -- you know, you can't always, you know, get to the library either [NOISE] and that's not always the most convenient --
L:  Well, you know, we have a lot of libraries here actually.  Where I -- where I live it's two, and we -- we have one like on, ah, -- it's like on Broad and Morris and then about seven or eight blocks from there it's another one.  So, we actually are pretty close to the library.  But some books that I get ou- out, ah, you know, I -- I like to keep.
R:  Sure.
L:  So, I -- I -- I try to, ah, get the names of them and then go to the book stores, see if I can find them there.  And at this book store that I found they were really reasonable.  So, ah, --
R:  So, is -- so is that your favorite [MN] indoor activity, is -- is reading -- 
L:  Reading, yeah.
R:  -- or do you have other? 
L:  Oh, well, I like to listen to music.  I like all kinds of music, but I think gospel music is my favorite. 
R:  Oh, yes, it's beautiful.
L:  And -- yeah, and my mom -- like, my mom, she's a, ah, ah, like -- she sings and [MN] she's in this group that they -- they do plays like Madam Butterfly and Carmen and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- stuff like that.  And I -- and I usually get to go and see her because she always gets tickets, you know, and --
R:  That is -- 
L:  It's wonderful because the [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  That is --
L:  -- full.
R:  -- amazing.
L:  Yeah.  I'm just waiting for the -- the theme parks to open because I have some grandchildren and I'm dying to take them because there's a lot of places like, ah, -- there's this place in Allentown, I forget the name of it, and I want to take them to Dorney Park and, you know, stuff like that -- things that I didn't get to do when I was little, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, now that I have grandchildren I think it's wild because my mom took my kids to all those places.  So, --
R:  Aw, they must keep you busy.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I love it.
R:  Running around.
L:  Oh, I love it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It is wonderful.
R:  You sound incredibly young for having grandchildren though.
L:  Well, I'm --
R:  You sound very vibrant --
L:  [LAUGH] I'm almost fifty --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- but I don't feel like it.  You know, I really don't feel like it.  But, ah, I figure I might as well enjoy the outdoors and all the -- all the -- all the things while I can.
R:  Sure.
L:  You know, because you're not promised tomorrow.
R:  That's true.
L:  So, I try to do a lot of good things.  I love to roller skate.  Now that -- that for me -- 
R:  Oh, --
L:  -- is the thing.
R:  -- yeah.
L:  I love to roller skate.  And I used to ice skate when I was younger, but I've gotten afraid.  I don't know if I could do it now.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I've only tried that once and -- and I fell so many times I thought, "Well, I don't know if I really want to do this again".  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, the roller skating is fun.
R:  Well, the roller skating, yeah, --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- yeah.
L:  But I'm kind of --
R:  That's nice.
L:  -- not too wild about that ice skating thing.
R:  That's what I was talking about too.
L:  Mm.  Well, I like, you know --
R:  That's funny.  So, you're not really -- you're not really that far off from my mom's age.
L:  And where's that? 
R:  Ah, she's about -- well, actually, wait a minute, she's -- I think she's about fifty five now, yeah, fifty five. 
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  So, ...
L:  My mom will be seventy soon.  But if --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- you've seen her, you wouldn't believe it.
R:  No, I probably wouldn't --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- because listening to you I would have thought from -- from your -- from your voice and how -- how vibrant you sound I thought that you were about thirty.
L:  Well, I feel like it.  I have a son that's thirty.
R:  [MN] Wow.
L:  [MN] And I have one that's twenty eight.
R:  My age.
L:  And we kind of like do things together, you know.  They -- well, they like sports, basketball.  Now the only sport that I really like, and -- and that's football.  I like football.
R:  Wow.
L:  [NOISE] So, -- and I used to play football with my kids when they were younger.  [MN] Now you wouldn't get me out there.  [LAUGH] In a million years you couldn't --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- get me out there now --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, and -- 
R:  [LAUGH] That's great. 
L:  I'm a outdoorsy type person.
R:  Yeah, yeah, especially [MN] with [several inaudible words] I mean you really want to be outside.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  And -- and with the world the way it is today you got to enjoy yourself when you can.
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  I know.
R:  So, that's so crucial now.
L:  Yes, it is.  It cer- certainly is that.  But w- what do you really like to do?  What's your more favorite, ah, um, summer activity? 
R:  Um, well, when I was younger, when I was still in school, I played a lot of -- lot of volleyball and basketball because I'm very tall.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [inaudible] about -- I'm -- I'm just a little, tiny bit over six feet.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, [MN] when I was younger -- I haven't grown much since then but, you know, when I -- when I was that age I was tall for my age so, -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I gravitated towards those kinds of things and had an interest.  Now I'm more -- [PAUSE] I mean, I -- I love to go out for walks.
L:  Mm.  [MN]
R:  And -- and go feed the ducks, go feed the ducks and go feed the squirrels at the park.
L:  Oh, yeah, I do that in the park, and feed the squirrels.  I think that's cool.
R:  Love that.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  And the ones here are really friendly though.  They'll come up close enough to you, they almost try to climb up your leg, some of them.
L:  Yeah, they're -- they're -- they're more bold than they used to be.
R:  They're so used to people feeding them.
L:  That's -- that's what it -- well, see now the parks over here I think they have signs up there asking you not to feed them anymore.
R:  Oh.
L:  I think that's kind of sad because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're hungry like everybody else.
R:  [LAUGH] That's true.
L:  You know.
R:  So, ... 
L:  But, ah, I l- -- I -- I'd like to go to Atlantic City.  They say the boardwalk is so much different from the way it used to be, but I haven't been there in quite a while.
