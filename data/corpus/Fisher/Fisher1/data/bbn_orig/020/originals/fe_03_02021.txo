L:  Hello? 
R:  Hi, my name is Stephanie.
L:  Hi, my name is Sherry.
R:  Okay.  Would you like to start?
L:  Um, I really don't know what too much to say about that, ah, [MN] -- I think she said it was something about, um, illegal practices or something -- 
R:  Um, it --
L:  -- that corporate America does.
R:  It was like what would you think the government should do about the scandal I think it was.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, shame on both of us.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  Um, [PAUSE] well, I don't know too many scandals that has happened far as that's concerned.  Um, I don't know --
R:  One of [MN] --
L:  -- if there's too much they --
R:  -- one --
L:  -- they could do really.
R:  Can you name one government scandal?
L:  Was it government scandal?  Um, mm, I mean, besides with the president --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's the only thing I could think of.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, [PAUSE] but I thought [MN] -- I thought she said something about big businesses or something.
R:  She did.  She said something.  It -- it was in reference to the government scandal as far as corporate and --
L:  But I don't know any scan -- that's the whole thing, I don't know any scandals that happened far as business is concerned.
R:  [PAUSE] If you did know any scandals far -- 
L:  I mean, it would help me.
R:  -- as business is concerned.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  That say if you did know any business scandals far as the government was concerned, how would you feel about it?  What would you do about it?
L:  [PAUSE] [MN] The -- the whole thing is I don't even think that the government has that much power.  I don't think there's too much that they could really do about if it was a business that had, um, a scandal or anything -- I don't really think the government can do too much.  Um, I mean, besides the fact that they report it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or anything like that, I -- I don't know, maybe they, ah, probably wouldn't let them do something --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- far as tax wise or, you know.  I -- I -- I really couldn't say -- I couldn't see them doing too much about that, really.  What do you think? 
R:  Ah, me either.  I really don't know too many government scandals that's going on.  Let me see if I really do know any government scandals that's going on.  Um, [PAUSE] um, well, I would just say I do think that, um, anthrax was like a government scandal -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- far as with the mail and everything, because I think the government was a part of that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I really do.  I don't think that that was a terrorist or anything.
L:  That was scary because I -- me working for the state -- 
R:  I don't think so.
L:  -- that was, like, really a messed up situation because we had got to the point where we could not open mail because of all that anthrax thing, and then they was like if you did open mail there were gloves.  "Have we seen anything suspicious?"
R:  Ow.
L:  It was -- it was crazy.
R:  I think that was the government --
L:  And then you had a lot of people that was scared. 
R:  -- wanting us to think that was one of the terrorists so then they could really go to war.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because the government is -- I mean, they say --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that, um, -- that the other countries are, it's just the government is just so, um, [LIPSMACK] what's the word [several inaudible words] that we are -- we supposed to be the kinder country, but I don't think we are.
L:  Mm.
R:  Think we're just as evil as the other countries.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, --
L:  Yeah, I kind of agree with that.
R:  -- I think that was a scandal.  The anthrax --
L:  Because I --
R:  -- scandal was conspired by the government to make us believe that this was one of the other countries doing this to us and it really was the government so, therefore, that we could go to war.
L:  No, I'm thinking too that the SARS thing that they got now, that that's like, um, -- that has something to do with +terrorist threat probably with the germ warfare thing that they got going on because nobody never heard of it before.  Now all of a sudden you got this big issue about SARS and people can't --
R:  Ah, therefore that could be a part of the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- government too, I mean --
L:  Mhm, because it was just -- it was crazy.
R:  -- because think about the gov- -- I mean, the US government is always something that's going on, they probably going over to China, messing around, putting these plagues on these people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You never know.  I mean, the government's involved in so much scandal that we -- we really can't realise, because we Americans, we see America in a different light -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to what other countries see them in.
L:  Even with the small part -- smallpox, um, vaccine thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they were saying that they just wanted, like, the hospital workers to get that and that, um, they would -- they -- they only had so many shots that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they can issue out.  And then -- then the hospital workers didn't want it because they didn't believe for whatever reason that it was helping anybody to get the vaccination.  So, it's like -- I don't know.  [NOISE] It's -- this is -- this is a crazy government.
R:  Do have a crazy government.  I just think every -- ah, and I don't know, I -- I just don't believe anything that the government says because it's all just --
L:  I always think that they're hiding something.  I always think that they're hiding some detail or something.
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  So, even with the, um, Saddam[?] they can't find him and all this.  So, I believe they know where he's at.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I believe they know where --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- bin Laden is.  I -- I believe that they know these things.
R:  That's another scandal which the government try to act like bin Laden is such a terrorist that he just want us Americans so bad.  But, you've got to think about it.  We as Americans, we're coming over there on their holy land.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you know.  So, -- I mean, we're just seeing what we see on the media.
L:  Right.
R:  What media is telling us.  So, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, these people are just protecting their land, their turf.  I think it's a shame that the government is over there messing with those people.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I had a friend that said the same thing.  He was like, "Why would we go over there and send -- and fight those people and everything", and I'm -- and I -- I've never really understood the whole thing, purpose of the war.  But, um, [SIGH] -- and everybody had their o- own opinions about why we need to go to war, but it -- to me it didn't make any sense still.
R:  Right.  Another scandal --  
L:  So, then there's just like, you know, --
R:  -- with the government just to get those people oil.
L:  That's what I thought it was.  I've only thought it was about the oil.  People say, "No, it's not about the oil.  It's, you know, -- it's about setting the people free, this, that and the other thing".
R:  Mm.
L:  If that's their way of life, that's their way of life.
R:  Right.
L:  Who's -- who's to say that everybody's supposed to have the same kind of way of life.  It's like even that great wall, when they tore that down.  Um, I've -- I can't even think what country that was.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And the same, like, -- the people went back to the same kind of communist, um, atmosphere.  [MN] Nothing changed.  People were still scared to cross over to the other side, so -- 
R:  I don't know.  I just think our government has a lot -- and maybe we do have a lot of s- scandal that are -- far as -- what was that, um, senator name that killed that young girl, [MN] the -- the intern he was messing around with?  They never got, um, -- it never got out because the -- we had the, um, oh, gosh, -- the -- what went on with the, um, -- [LIPSMACK] when the missiles attacked the [NOISE], um, -- that building, the aeroplane crash.
L:  Oh, oh, oh, right, right [MN] because that -- that --
R:  Remember when that senator killed that intern girl, but he never got exposed fully because of what happened --
L:  Because we had that --
R:  -- with that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with this --
L:  -- because of nine eleven, yeah.
R:  -- nine eleven, yeah, with the nine eleven.  So, that was another scandal that they kept amongst each other, you know.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And that senator man he did [NOISE] -- he really killed that girl, but never came out.
L:  Mhm.  That's some crazy stuff.  Ah, well, I guess we do know some scan- -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, we do.
L:  We just -- we just didn't know -- I was -- I got -- I guess --
R:  I guess the way they said it.
L:  -- the question kind of like threw, ah, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- threw me off, so -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, and this is like the third call I got.  So, I'm trying to keep up with the topics, but it's kind of hard.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I just base it on what if we did know any scandal, how would you feel about it. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] for the most part, um, I don't like feeling as though I'm being deceived.  You know how people always hold back details or whatever and then they make a big blown out case first and then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they turn around and then all these hidden details, "Oh, we never meant to -- we never -- we forgot to tell you about such and such," and it's like, "You had to know that from the beginning", so ... 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It was just like when they sent all the troops over to Kuwait and everybody's saying, "No, we're not, um, -- they're not going to war".  Well, why would you send all them people over there --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- if you didn't have [MN] any intentions of war.
R:  I don't care, that's nothing but over oil.  We won't never know the truth, like you said.  We won't really know.  Only people that know it is George Bush and his people. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Their little scandal.  [PAUSE] I think it's a sin, though.
L:  Yeah, --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I think it's a sh- -- I think it's a shame that so many lives was lost in the midst --
R:  I know.
L:  -- of all this.  And even when you look at the girl that, um, got shot in both ankles and they kept telling a different story every time you turn around.  First, it was though she's -- she's a little injured but, you know, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- then they're trying to find out, like, were they being tortured.  You know -- you know those people were being tortured.
R:  Of course they are.  They are torturing the --
L:  So, there's no reason to shoot nobody in the ankle.
R:  I think like the American -- like the other foreign countries, um, torture -- tortured Americans, I d- do -- I think that Americans really do torture the other people that they capture.  They have to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What makes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- us any di- --
