L:  Hi, my name's Chrissie.
R:  My name's Sandy.
L:  How are you doing? 
R:  Oh, I can't believe I finally got somebody.
L:  Oh, yeah?  You know what, calling in the evening is best.
R:  Really? 
L:  Yeah, that's what I found.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, um, --
R:  Sounds interesting.
L:  Yeah, but usually it works in -- [NOISE] the later because of -- I don't know if you're on the east coast or the west coast [MN].
R:  East coast.
L:  That's the thing.  The west coast doesn't wake up till three hours after us.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um, so, --
R:  Okay, Chrissie. 
L:  -- they want to know about outdoor activities.
R:  Yes.
L:  Or cold weather or warm weather.  [NOISE] I'm a warm weather kind of girl.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, obviously if you're in California, huh? 
L:  I'm not in California, no.  I'm actually in New York.
R:  Oh, you're in New York? 
L:  I am in New York, yeah.
R:  In New York City? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You're an outdoor type of person? 
L:  I definitely am, yeah.
R:  I'm an indoor type of person.
L:  You're an indoor type person.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What do you like to do indoors?  What makes you indoors?
R:  Well, post traumatic stress syndrome.
L:  Mm.
R:  I have that, and I h- -- and I love my animals.
L:  Okay.
R:  My -- my cats.  So, I love being with my animals.  But I do like to sit out every day, sit outside and just breath fresh air.  I live in the country.  Actually, I live in Frenchtown --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- New Jersey.  So, I live in the country, a rural area, Hunterdon County.  [several inaudible words] ever heard of it in New Jersey? 
L:  No.  So, it must be pretty small since we're neighbors and I don't know it, right? 
R:  It's only fifteen hundred people.  You ever hear of New Hope, Pennsylvania? 
L:  Actually I go there often, yes.
R:  New Hope?
L:  Yes, New Hope.
R:  Well, this is a suburb of New Hope.
L:  Okay.
R:  This is about fifteen minutes away from it.
L:  Okay.
R:  But it's right along the Delaware River, which New Hope is.
L:  It's very pretty over there.
R:  Yeah, really -- really nice out here.
L:  Okay.
R:  And so, ah, we have horses running around in the back.  I live in an apartment complex.  But, um, it's a very small complex.  It's only six buildings.  There's only fifty four people.  I think, fifty four apartments here.  And, ah, I have a mountain right outside in the back, and usually on the weekends, usually on Saturday, today, like this --
L:  Yeah, it's kind of rainy today.  [MN] [LAUGH]
R:  -- we'll see the horses coming down -- we'll see the horses come down, you know what I'm saying, and they've got --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- their little, ah, -- they -- they have their helmets on and stuff like that and they also have, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some neat -- some really neat, ah, I think like four wheeled motorcycles or something like that [MN].
L:  Like the ATV type of things? 
R:  Yeah.  How old are you?
L:  I'm twenty eight. 
R:  My -- that's close to my son's age.  My son's twenty six and my daughter's twenty eight.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] I'm forty eight.  I'm old.
L:  Oh, no, you're not old.
R:  I'm an old fart.
L:  No, no.  Old is like ninety.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, what do you like to do? 
L:  Um, I like to [several inaudible words] whole outdoor thing is I would love to live where you're living.  I love to go camping and I love --
R:  We have the most wonderful biking trail over here, we really do.
L:  I love biking.  I love camping.  I ride the ATVs.  We have some land up -- up, ah, kind of in between the Catskills and the Adirondack.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, in some place called Schoharie County we h- -- we have, ah, land that's surrounded by, um, a national -- like, state park.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we bring our ATVs up there, and it's pretty nice.
R:  Wow.  Well, the only problem with living near the water where I am, where -- [MN] it's the Delaware River, is that there's more bugs.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But there's also a lot of wildlife and [MN] -- and there's horses like crazy out here, as you walk --
L:  They're wild horses? 
R:  -- as you go out -- no, [MN] no, no.
L:  Like owned horses, yeah.
R:  Owned horses, and there's a lot of horseback riding around here.
L:  Do you do that? 
R:  Ah, no.
L:  No.
R:  No, I don't.  I used to when I was y- -- really young, I used to do some.  That's growing up in New Jersey.  [MN] That's -- that's what you do.  And I think every girl goes through so- something when they're like twelve or something.
L:  Yeah, that's when I went horseback riding too.  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know what it is.  My daughter too.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's very funny, because that's around when I used to go horseback riding all the time.
R:  I know, people go horse crazy.  G- girls usually go horse crazy around that, just like their first boyfriend.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Mine was named Applejack.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] Well, my daughter, [MN] she got -- she got tired of horses when she had to [MN] -- keep cleaning out -- cleaning out the stalls for her horse work.
L:  Oh.
R:  We had a friend who w- -- who had a horse farm.  And riding horses is fun, but cleaning out horse stalls is not.
L:  No.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know what, I actually managed a stable.  It is really not fun.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I used to have the other people do it.
R:  Do you have any pets? 
L:  I do.  I have, um, -- well, I -- I like indoors too, because I have two dogs.  But, see, my dogs are outside dogs.  They're mountain type of dogs.
R:  Oh, great.
L:  They're big, big dogs, so they like to go outside with me.
R:  So they have to be run.
L:  They have to be run, because otherwise they'd just -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I wish I could have cats, but I am definitely allergic to them, like asthmatic.
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  It's really sick because actually I'm staying right now.  I have a foot injury, unfortunately, which is driving me crazy because it means I can't do any kind of outdoor things, but my uncles have two Burmese.
R:  Ahah.
L:  And they're just amazing, but I'm so -- I can't even touch them.  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  [LAUGH] I look at them and I start coughing.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's a shame. 
L:  And I take medication for it.  You know, they've been trying to like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- find something that'll work, but none of the medications work.  So, I'm limited in that sense.
R:  But you do walk -- you do walk your dogs pretty often if they're outside, huh? 
L:  Well, yeah, -- they have to go -- well, I'm not doing it right now because, like I said, I have a foot injury.
R:  Right.
L:  But I do walk them, like, four times a day.  I love to be outside.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  You know, this kind of -- even in this weather, even though I have a foot injury, I still walked around today as much as I possibly could until -- now I'm over here doing my exercises to kind of compensate.  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm on the phone right now.  [MN] This is a paid thing, Jeremy.  They -- they -- they pay you to talk to somebody, usually a stranger.  But, yeah, I -- I -- I like -- I like doing indoor things myself, some -- you know, I lo- -- I love movies and --
L:  I do too, actually.  I guess that's indoor, yeah.
R:  -- and all that kind of sedate things because it -- it's really calming, I think, you know.  You wouldn't believe the movies that I like.  They're the worst movies in the whole world, those horrible low budget films.
L:  Like the B movies? 
R:  Yeah.  I love the really old ones.  They're my favorite.
L:  Like Ed Wood and stuff.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I love Ed Wood too.  [LAUGH]
R:  I have gled- -- Glen and Glenda.
L:  Glen and Glenda is classic.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, is that funny or what?  [LAUGH]
L:  He's just great.  I mean, I love [MN] -- Plan Nine from Outer Space is just classic. 
R:  Oh, I've got that.  That's one of my favorites, yeah.  But I have some of the other weird ones too.  I think, ah, Night of the Ghouls. 
L:  Oh, yes, I've seen that one because actually -- 
R:  Really? 
L:  I -- o- one time we -- we actually rented -- it was [MN] -- you see, that's the one thing.  Like, I love outside stuff, but in the winter you really can't do it very much here in New York.
R:  You can't do much of anything.
L:  You know, it gets pretty cold.
R:  So, you enjoy the indoor -- in store stuff.
L:  Only in the win- --
R:  I was just watching Man from Planet X, I think it's called.
L:  I don't know -- I don't know that I know that one.
R:  Yeah.  It's not an Ed Wood film, though.
L:  Oh, okay.  No.
R:  Not an Ed Wood film.
L:  But we rented them all one winter.  [LAUGH] 
R:  But I have Glen and Glenda.  I have -- I have, ah, -- I have Night of the Ghouls.  I have, ah, -- I think Glen or Glenda is funny.  It's like weird porn from the fifties or something.  [LAUGH]
L:  It's really bizarre.  I know, it's like -- it's like the first gay porn, I feel like, or first transgender.  [LAUGH]
R:  Is that weird or what?  [LAUGH] "What type of underwear?"  Oh, I just -- I just love the way the -- the -- that they -- they have the -- the [MN] -- the, ah, -- the devil over there and -- and people are whipping each other and all kinds of weird stuff.  It's like -- [LAUGH] I sent it to my daughter.  She was ready to die, [LAUGH] you know what I'm saying? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, --
L:  Did --
R:  -- [MN] that -- that's cool.
L:  Did you see the -- the -- the one with Johnny Depp in it where he plays Ed Wood? 
R:  No.
L:  No.  It's pretty good, actually.  It's funny because --
R:  I heard -- I've heard a couple of people tell me that, but he was a real whacko, Ed -- Ed Wood.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's the thing.  It's really funny because you just really get to know, like, how -- like, you know, with that first scene when he's looking in the window of Glen and Glenda and he just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kind of stops and he looks and he's like -- and, like, he literally, like, -- Johnny Depp does this scene where they do it and it's like one shot and he's like -- and it's a horrible shot and he's like, "That was perfect".  You know, [LAUGH] and they move on -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because he was just so crazy.
R:  He must have been a nut.  I swear to God he must have been really -- really a nut, [LAUGH] because [LAUGH] I can't understand how they ever did these things.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I [inaudible] believe he got funding.
R:  Why they spent so many thousands of dollars to do these things.
L:  That's what I mean.  I c- -- I was actually surprised he got the funding, especially during that time.  Now it's a little bit easier because, I mean, it's so low budget.  But back then, you know, six, seven thousand dollars is a lot of money.
R:  Yeah, they were talking about [inaudible] for Christine Jorgensen, something about a -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, oh, wow, I can't -- I can't believe somebody doing a film that bad for [LAUGH] -- for sex change operation people, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] To explain it to people.  And they were talking about women in stockings and how men dress down.  I have to admit, though, men are pretty weird.
L:  Yeah, they do a lot of weird stuff.  It's very true.
R:  Well, I can't understand who would actually consider it to be a wonderful thing to wear a roo- -- a noose around their neck, and that -- that's what men do with ties every day.
L:  [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  It's a noose.
L:  Well, you know, women, we do it with the heels, I mean -- 
R:  Oh, that's horrible.
L:  It's just a different -- it's just a different form of torture.  [LAUGH]
R:  It sure is.
L:  I never get that, you know.  Actually, my foot condition -- my doctor's like, "Oh, if you wore high heels it wouldn't have happened".  I'm like, "No, but then I would have a knee and back problem".
R:  Yeah.
L:  "So, what would be the difference?" 
R:  Yeah, you would.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, it depends on your body style too because, um, foot injuries could be caused by so many different things.
L:  Well, mine is because I have flat feet, so that's why a heel would be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it would be good, but I'm not putting them on.  [LAUGH]
R:  No.
L:  When I was around twenty one I decided, "I will never wear heels again".  [LAUGH]
R:  No, they're painful.
L:  They are really painful.
R:  I just can't believe that they [inaudible] -- they -- they push all the weight into the front of your foot, then you have a bunion.
L:  Yep.
R:  Or a corn.
L:  Or you get a neuroma --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which is where the ner- -- the -- the bones rub against the nerve.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, it's painful.
L:  Yeah.  So, how about warm or cold?  Do you --
R:  Well --
L:  -- which one do you prefer?  I mean, obviously we're in the east.
R:  -- I was in Florida one time.  Did you ever go to Florida? 
L:  I lived down there for a while right after college because I love the warm. 
R:  I lived there for nine months.
L:  You did?  I lived for, like, ten.  [MN]
R:  Oh, my God, isn't that weird.
L:  This is like a very alternate reality.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That is a strange coincidence, isn't it? 
L:  Yeah.  Did you like it down there, though? 
R:  Well, my sister lives down there.  So, I had a nervous breakdown.  So, how do you like -- like it when you have a nervous breakdown, right?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, --
R:  But, um, I --
L:  -- at least --
R:  -- I think -- I think --
L:  -- they're friendly down in Florida.
R:  I --  
L:  The people are nice.
R:  -- these people are nice, the churches are nice down there.  There's a lot of fun bike trails down there.  There's a lot of things you could do.  There's like a boardwalk everywhere down there, whereas up -- up in New Jersey it's like -- it's very seasonal.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because -- because it's warm all the time, you could do so much.
L:  Exactly.
R:  But -- and your body does get used to the heat.
L:  Yeah, I mean people are, like, "Oh, I can't b-" -- I was there that summer when there was all the fires, and they're like, "Weren't you hot?"  I was like, "No.  It was like a hundred degrees".  I mean, you get used to it.  If you're -- if you're -- if you're winter is seventy degrees, going to a hundred's not that big of a change.
R:  No, no.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It does -- and -- and -- and I was really close to the gulf -- the gulf bea- --
