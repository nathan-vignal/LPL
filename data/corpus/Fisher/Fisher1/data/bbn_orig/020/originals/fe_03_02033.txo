L:  Anna Dungle[?].
R:  Monica Pace[?].
L:  I beg your pardon? 
R:  Ah, my name is Monica Pace.
L:  Um, Anna Dungle. 
R:  Hi, Anna.  How are you?
L:  Just fine.
R:  [MN] Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Oh, I'm sorry, um, it's hard to hear over this phone, I guess.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, um, the [MN] -- do you want to start the topic, or would you like me to start?
L:  I'd like you to start, please.
R:  Oh, okay, sure.  Um, as far as liking cold weather or warm weather better, I would definitely say warm weather.  Um, I like to be outdoors.  I like to take walks and stuff like that, and cold weather prevents me from -- I don't know, just doing the simplest things and just being happy about it, because it's just too cold, you know what I'm saying?  It's just --
L:  I know exactly what you are saying.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I like the warm weather [MN] -- the warmer weather too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  To take the walks, get out on the porch, go on picnics, have, ah, -- you know, enjoy the grandchildren, things like that.
R:  Yeah. [PAUSE] So, mm, let me see.  Um, --
L:  How 'bout going to the beach?  You like that in the summer time?
R:  Yes, do I, yeah.  Um, I like, um, -- I've been to the beach in Maine a lot -- ah, my parents now live there -- and I like the contrast between the really cold water, because it doesn't get past I would say sixty five degrees.  It's very cold, and it -- it gets -- I mean, you would think Maine -- because it's up north, it's, um, -- it would stay cold, but, actually, in the summer it's really hot.  It's like down here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, I really enjoy that.  I'm looking forward to taking a vacation up there and, um, -- yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Well, my husband and I've taken the children and the five grandchildren to the beach in South Carolina a couple of years in a row --  
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and which -- they enjoyed it.  We had a good time.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  It was nice and -- but it was gla- -- it was good to be home.
R:  Yeah.
L:  With five grandchildren hollering at you every two seconds, it gets --
R:  Oh, my --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow!  Wow, wow.  I don't even have kids, let alone grandkids.  That's -- that's really amazing.  Wow!
L:  Oh, yeah.  I took 'em -- [MN] we all went to the beach, and of course I was playing in the water with all five of them and they were -- all five -- hollering and screaming at me at the same time, and after about seven days and -- we've come home.  I told my, ah, kids -- I said, "I don't want to see 'em for a month."  They were all here the next day!
R:  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] So ... [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But in the summer time it's warm.  I like to take the grandchildren to -- well, I take 'em swimming a lot and take them to the park, you know, and things like that.  They enjoy that.  We have cook outs.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Um, I like that too.  Um, my sister and brother in law live in the suburbs, and they invite me over a lot.  They, ah, -- they cook on the grill.  I'm -- I'm a vegetarian, so they'll make me, um, -- I don't know, there's veggie kebabs and things like that, and, um, -- I'm trying to think what else on the topic of warm weather.  I'm just so glad the winter is over because --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- it was -- it was absolutely horrible.  I --  
L:  And where are you at?
R:  I was sick the entire -- I was just sick the entire winter.
L:  [MN] Ah, where do you live at?
R:  Where do I live?  I live in West Philly.
L:  Oh, in Philadelphia.
R:  Philadelphia, yeah.  Where --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- do you live?
L:  Well, I'm in West Virginia.
R:  Oh, my gosh!  Okay.  Wow!  
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  This must be, ah, a nationwide, um, type of, ah, survey, then.
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  Wow, I had no idea. [MN] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, West Virginia was nice.  It was -- we had a bad winter, but now it's starting to get warm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'm looking forward to it.  The trees are green and summer's on its way, I hope.
R:  [MN] Me, too, yeah.  [PAUSE]
L:  Okay, we need to talk about something else about warm weather.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It's so funny.  It's such -- it's -- it's a limited topic, I would say.  I mean -- um, I mean, I -- I -- I would say, unless you like skiing or something, you wouldn't like the cold weather, especially outdoor activities [several inaudible words].
L:  I've never tried the skiing because I was always afraid that I would end up with a broken leg.
R:  Yeah, or just everything broken [LAUGH], like in my case. [LAUGH]
L:  No, I like the warm weather.  I'm like you. I like the walks and th- the cook outs and the picnics and the swimming and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, things like that. 
R:  Yeah.  This will be my first summer, actually, that I haven't, um, had the use of, ah, my parents' pool, because they -- they recently moved to Maine.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They used to live in the Philadelphia area, out in the suburbs, and, um, wow, it was -- it was so beautiful out there.  Um, quite a contrast between I would say where I live now, which is in the city, and out where they lived, which is, um, almost I would say rural.  It's not even town.  It's kind of -- [MN] it -- you know, it's -- it's out there a little bit.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So they had a huge backyard and, um, I -- well, I -- I'm still a painter, but I used to paint all the time, especially, um, back -- when I was in college and I would go home for the summer, and, um, I would take all my paints outside and just sit outside and paint the landscape, paint what I saw --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- or, um, just do some different things.  Maybe, if I wasn't painting directly from nature, I would find, um, a photograph of, um, -- I did this whole series when I took a trip to Ireland a few years ago, and I did a whole photographic series and a whole sketch series, and I took that outside and just -- just to be outside to get a tan and stuff like that and --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- the weather was so nice, and I would paint that stuff and, ah, um, -- because I use oil paints [PAUSE] the fumes kind of are overpowering if you are indoors, like if you don't have a very well ventilated space.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I didn't want to just, like, use my bedroom and have it smell like paint all the time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, yeah, that's one thing I miss because -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I don't have a backyard anymore.  It's just --
L:  I bet you could get some beautiful, ah, paintings in Maine in the summer time.
R:  Ah, yeah, yeah.  I actually have, um, back when I used to vacation with my family.  Um, you know, up until a few years ago I used to take my paints up there and, um, -- I'd be right on the coast.  I would set my, um, -- my easel up, and it would be so windy and everything would blow away and I'd get paint all over me, but I came up with a few fun things, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But ... [PAUSE]
L:  Do they do a lot of sailing in the summer time at Maine.
R:  Um, I think some people do.  I know my parents don't.  They -- they mostly like to take hikes and stuff like that.  Um, they don't do much of the -- the boating aspect.
L:  I imagine they -- they have some beautiful trails in the summer time up there in Maine.
R:  They do, yeah.  They are right, um, -- where they live it's the northern most coast of Maine up, um, -- right like -- basically right on the border of Canada.  So -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- sometimes they'll take hikes from Maine into Canada. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh. 
R:  Yeah, and, I mean, it's -- it's so -- I mean, it's so close by.  Basically, it's just that invisible line between Maine and Canada, but they, um, -- they've gone to, um, Campobello Island, um, which is Canadian, I believe, and, um, -- yeah, so [MN] they are very outdoorsy, nature people -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- so I guess maybe that's where I got it from.
L:  Ah, that could be.
R:  Yeah.  But they like cooler weather, which is why they moved to Maine in the first place.  Um, most people that I know of when they retire go down to Florida.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Um, and they just went the completely opposite direction, and it's -- you know, good for them if that's what they like.
L:  Well, now me, I like the warm weather.  I --  
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- would much rather be w- warm all the time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, West Virginia, would you say that's, um, -- [MN] w- would that be any [MN] -- I'm trying to think of -- I know geographically where it is.  Would that be, um, basically the same weather that you would get in Philadelphia or, um, --
L:  Yes, because we are, like, a hundred -- ah, two hundred miles from Pittsburgh.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It's where I live, and whatever the Pittsburgh weather is, it's basically the same thing that we have here.
R:  Right, right.  So you guys --
L:  Now, today it's a little bit on the chilly side, but it's not cold enough to wear a coat.  It's just been overcast.
R:  Right.
L:  But in the summer time we get a lot of hot weather and very humid.
R:  Ah, y- -- we do too, yeah.  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Especially living in the city.  It's -- you know, it gets really unbearable.  Um, in the summer I'm mostly outdoors because my apartment -- I'm on the fourth floor and, um, -- as you can imagine, it's sort of like, um, I don't know, just like going up into your attic in the summer time.  That's --  
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  That's what the weather's like in here.  There's windows only on, um, one side of my apartment, so there's no cross ventilation.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, um, if the wind doesn't happen to be blowing in from the west, I, um, -- it gets -- it gets pretty bad in here, um, at night.  I was using a, um, -- a window fan, like an exhaust fan and -- but, um, I think now that I have a little bit of extra money I'm going to just have to break down and get an air conditioner --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because [LAUGH] any place that you can sit in the middle of the day and not be able to breathe and just watch candles melt all by themselves -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- without being lit -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know it's warm!
L:  That's warm.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Very warm.
R:  I -- I have all these warped candles in my apartment to prove it [LAUGH], that that's how warm it gets.  It's -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- just, um, -- almost inhumane. [LAUGH] 
L:  Now, we have two great big maple trees in our front yard.
R:  Ahah.
