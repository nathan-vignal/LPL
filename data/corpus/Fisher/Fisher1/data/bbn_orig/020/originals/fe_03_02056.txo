R:  Ah, my name is Edith.
L:  Hi, I'm Lynn. [MN]
R:  Hi, Lynn.
L:  How are you?
R:  Okay.
L:  Okay, so the topic is, ah, whether we like cold or hot, I believe, weather and indoors or outdoors activity.  [MN]
R:  Well, not too cold or not -- just, you know, spring weather.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'd rather indoor activities.
L:  Okay, well I agree with you with the spring part.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, but, ah, I love outdoor activities because I love walk- -- I, ah, live cross Daisy Mountain.
R:  Oh.
L:  [MN] Ah, in the middle of the city [LAUGH] but there's a mountain.
R:  Ahah.
L:  And I go walking there every morning with my dog and when I'm in nature I feel like I'm in heaven.
R:  Ahah.
L:  I feel like, ah, this is paradise.  So I must say that I love the outdoors and I guess the -- the dog has taught me that.
R:  Oh, sure.  Mhm.
L:  To lo- -- yeah, to love all weathers because -- 
R:  Now, where do you live?
L:  In Montreal.   
R:  Oh.
L:  Ah, Canada, but there's with the Mount Royal which is, ah, a big park that was, ah, designed by Mr Homestead who also designed Central Park in New York.
R:  Ahah.
L:  So it's -- it's quite a safe park actually, and it's big so, ah, --
R:  Oh, I bet that's nice, mhm.
L:  So, you know, he -- he introduced me to the outdoors and I feel like, ah, -- I -- I'm in the city and away from the city, so I like the outdoors 'cause -- if it's outside of the city.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I must -- I must, ah, -- if it's in nature.  If it's in with the traffic downtown -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- no, [LAUGH] I don't like the outside and I feel the elements much more.  Like the cold weather I feel more, the more -- the, ah,  -- the, ah, precipitations I feel more but if I'm in nature strangely enough it doesn't bother me that much.
R:  Oh, I'm sure.  Mhm.
L:  So, so what kind of activity do you do indoors. 
R:  Well, I like bowling.
L:  [MN] Okay.  That's -- that's nice.  I haven't bowled for a long time.
R:  Haven't you?  Mhm.
L:  No, but it's a fun activity to do with a group.  I must admit whenever I've gone it's, ah, you for- -- I for- -- I keep forgetting how much fun it is but it's the sharing.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, you can get in groups, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the clubs and everything and -- and the couples.
L:  So that would be fun.  So you're a serious bowler? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, good for you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you participate in, ah, in, ah, championships -- in, ah, competitions I should say? 
R:  No, not that -- not good.  That -- oh, one time we were in a, ah, championship, you know, but we didn't do -- win anything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, it -- you know, just for the fun.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, you know what, I think I -- I love nature and that's my -- my -- my preference if I had to choose only one, but, ah, indoors is also nice.  I think a balance of everything is good.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If you can have, ah, -- if you can have both, like, you know, ah, 'cause sometimes you like to be indoors.
R:  [NOISE]  Mhm.
L:  And sometimes you like to be outside.
R:  Oh, a lot of people like skating, you know, --
L:  Oh, skating is fun.
R:  -- ice skating.
L:  Skating is fun.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Snow shoeing is fun.  Ah, cross country skiing is -- I love.  I mean, I can do all of these in the mountain which is nice.  I can go across the street go up the stairs and the lower chalet you can rent any of that equipment.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Depending on, ah, what's out there.  You know, if there's lots of snow in one day and it's difficult to walk you go borrow some -- you -- you go over get some, I should say, some, ah, some, ah, snow shoes or some skis.
R:  Oh.
L:  And you, ah, -- so it's, ah, -- I guess I'm very privileged and blessed to have that.
R:  Oh, you sure are.  Mhm.
L:  So -- so, yeah.  So where do you live? 
R:  In Cincinnati.
L:  What's the weather like there?
R:  Oh, it's -- right now it's real pretty out today.
L:  Oh, is it?  It's sunny?
R:  There's a little -- ahah, there's -- there's a breeze and it's warm, you know, seventy some degrees.
L:  Oh, well, that's nice.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, we haven't had that yet.  It's, um, it's so- -- spring is having a hard time making it this year.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, ah, I don't know if that was the same with you and we haven't --
R:  Well, it's been kind of cool here.  In fact, we had the heat on, you know, in the house -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- for a couple of days now.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And, ah, but it's been nice, you know.
L:  I guess.  You know what, I think the most important thing that I'm learning because the changes in weathers are so unpredictable.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Is that not to expect anything and go with the flow and when I do that I don't -- I guess I get more in tune with the weather that we have and I don't resent any weather so much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, it doesn't mean that I don't get fed up a bit but much, much less than I used to, and I think it's because it's so unpredictable.  Like, I used to say, "It's not supposed to be doing this at this time of the year."
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And I would get angry at that.
R:  Well, now here it's almost May and, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, it's cool.
L:  I know.  It's not -- it's not the normal weather.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's not -- it's certainly not the norm- -- I don't think we can expect normal any more or there's no such thing as normal any more.
R:  Well, I always say it's from going up to the moon. [LAUGH]
L:  It's going up to the -- what's going up to the moon?
R:  [LAUGH]  You know, going up there and messing arou- --
L:  We're all going up there?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Is that what you said? 
R:  No, ah, -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, [inaudible] okay.
R:  It's like messing around up there with the -- 
L:  Oh --
R:  -- atmos- atmosphere.
L:  -- it's because of the -- it's because of, ah, us sent, you know, sending people to the moon?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  In, ah, as space that's, ah, --
R:  Space, yeah.  I think that's affecting the weather.
L:  It could possibly be.  I mean, you know --
R:  Mhm, I've heard a lot of people say that.  You know, I know they have to do it and everything like that, but, ah, you never know.
L:  Oh, I'm sure it has effect because I think all the universe is connected and everything has, ah, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- has some bearing on each other.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, we're -- we are all connected.
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  In some way or other, so it has to affect us like, ah, going for oil in the ground must affect the earth somehow.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  It has to.  I mean, you know, it's -- in my mind anyway.
R:  Mhm.
L:  In my brain it does, ah, it has to have an effect.  So, ah, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You're probably right.
R:  You never know.
L:  That -- you never know, and, ah, unfortunately I don't think anybody knows.
R:  No.
L:  We always know too late the consequences of our actions.
R:  Mhm.  Would you like to go up there being an astronaut?
L:  Ah, now that would be really, really be an outdoor activity, wouldn't it? [LAUGH]
R:  It sure would. [LAUGH]
L:  Actually, I'm adventurous enough to say, yes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I would, I think, ah, -- that would be the ultimate outdoor activity.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I think, um, so I think -- you know wh- what, I think one day it will probably happen. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  There will be peop- -- you know, on a regular basis that would be one of our choices --
R:  Yeah, I think --
L:  -- as an outdoor activity.
R:  And sky diving, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but that's not going to be -- 
R:  Boy! 
L:  -- in my life time, I think. [LAUGH] No, I --
R:  [LAUGH]  How'd you like to do that?  Oh, boy.
L:  Oh, I -- well, not -- well, sky diving I haven't done.  I haven't even done it from a plane yet, so I'm not too sure about the other. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I don't know.  If, ah, you know, if you could just kind of float like you see the anti gravity and just, ah, -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And kind of control where you're go, not just go out in outer space and just float there for the rest of your life.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, ah, yeah, it's, ah, it's fascinating when you really start thinking about indoors and outdoors, it brings all kinds of thought.
R:  That's right, mhm. 
L:  You know, just even the gravity that we're -- we're held to the ground.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, it's a ball, it's round and we don't fall off. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's -- [MN] it's, you know, ah, the world is -- the universe is really, really fascinating and, ah, --
R:  Mm.
L:  And I think we should really, ah, enjoy it more on a daily basis and when you think about the wonder of it all.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But outdoor is -- I love the grass, I love the smell of the grass.  I love the, ah, -- everything in fresh air is, ah, and where it's not polluted -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- is beautiful.  Away --
R:  My husband likes fishing.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But that's -- you see, just the fact of being out there.  The only thing about fishing is that you go in the direct sun unprotected.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, like you, I don't like extremes of weather.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Like, I don't like really really hot and I don't like really really cold.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I hear that Madeira has got ideal weather.  Somebody was telling me when I was, like, explaining that I like, you know, spring and fall and I like, ah, -- I like the cooler wea- -- ah, the cooler weather but not cold.
R:  No.
L:  You know, where you can dress appropriately.  I love to feel the sun and, ah, a cool breeze or the coolness of the air on my face at the same time, if you know what I mean?
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, if you go on a winter day and it's really sunny?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you feel the warmth and the cool at the same time, so it's just, ah, -- you can really enjoy the sun because you're not hot.
R:  Would you like to live in Florida?
L:  You know what, I would -- um, I have a sister that lives there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I like Florida at some times, it's just I don't like humidity and they have --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- in summer it's very humid. 
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  If it wasn't for that I'd love to live in Hawaii.
R:  Mhm.
L:  In, ah, -- I -- I haven't been -- I've been to Hawaii but I haven't been to Maui. [inaudible]
R:  Oh, now that, a friend of mine's been there and she said, "Oh, that Maui that's the best".
L:  A perfect paradise.
R:  Ahah.
L:  Yeah, I know.  I have a friend that wants to retire there. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I hear good luck to you 'cause I think you need a lot of money to -- to retire in Maui.
R:  Yeah.  No, I've never been to Hawaii.  Oh, I'd love to go there.
L:  Oh, Hawaii's nice but, ah, apparently the best is Maui.
R:  Mhm.  That's what they say, mhm.
L:  Yeah.  So one day I must go there, you know.  I'd love to go a swim with the dolphins.
R:  Oh, would you?  Mhm.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Wouldn't you do that?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Wouldn't you like that?
R:  I don't know. [LAUGH].  
L:  You're not -- 
R:  I'd have to think about it.
L:  You'd have to think about it. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know.  It's one of my dreams, one of my dreams.
R:  Oh.
L:  Oh, 'cause they're so pretty, and it's -- 
R:  Well, you ought to do that.  You never did that?
L:  I never did that.
R:  Oh, well, you ought to do that.
L:  Absolutely.  It's on my list of to do things. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  I have a long list, that's the problem.
R:  That would be nice.
L:  Yeah, no, I think everybody's that done it, um, --
