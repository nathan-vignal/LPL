R:  Hi, this is Jackie in Florida.
L:  Hi, this is Jeanette in North Carolina. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And we're not too far away from each other. [LAUGH]
L:  No, we're not.  Huh.
R:  Hm.
L:  I love the warm weather. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm. 
L:  Is it warm --
R:  [COUGH] Well, I -- I like summer and fall.  You -- uh, spring and fall.  You can keep your summer and you can keep the winter.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I love my winter. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Huh.
R:  Huh.  [SIGH] What types of outdoor activity do you like?
L:  I like tennis.  I like, um -- well, I don't participate in it but I like the ... um, basketball, baseball. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I like to, um ... let's see, putt putt.  I can't play golf so I have to putt putt.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Actually I've only -- I've only played golf one time.
L:  Mm.
R:  And it was pretty okay.  I didn't mind it.
L:  I get --
R:  I like the miniature golf too though.  That's fun.
L:  Yeah, I get the irons mixed up. [LAUGH]
R:  You get the what?
L:  The ir- --
R:  The irons? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I don't know which iron I need for what. 
R:  Me neither. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH].
R:  There's a little bit of a -- a learning curve to that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's um -- I enjoy --
L:  Certain posture.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Huh. 
R:  The swings and stuff like that.  I like horseback riding.
L:  Oh, that's one thing I'd love to do.  Never done.
R:  Is that right?
L:  Yep.
R:  I'll be, in North Carolina, and you never been horseback riding?
L:  I have never been horse riding -- horseback riding or anything.
R:  Wow.
L:  I want to.
R:  Hm.  Yeah, that's fun.  Maybe get -- if you get somebody ... you're better off going with somebody that -- that's a friend of yours and has a horse that -- that they know ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as opposed to going to, like, a dude ranch and getting stuck on some ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- fud dud or runaway, you know?
L:  [LAUGH] Some wild beast. 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  If you don't have a good experience for your first time, you probably would never go again but, um ...
L:  Ooh, I'm -- and I'm afraid of heights too so that's another thing.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know what though?  I am too.  I am scared to death of heights and I'm only five one and you can put me on a sixteen hand horse and it doesn't bother me.
L:  Hm.
R:  I guess, 'cause you know -- you fe- you could feel you've got something solid underneath a ya, you know?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I would lo- I would love to go horseback riding.  Oth- ... it would be a new experience for me but ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I think it would be fun.  I've seen -- you know, seen pho- shows with the horses and everything, you know.  Oh, ride a horse you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's a lot of fun.  It's a lot of fun.
L:  I never got the courage to ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And Steve prop-
R:  I've been riding since I was a little kid so ...
L:  Mm.  Well, for cold weather, let's see.
R:  For cold weather, I think the best sport is ...
L:  I like playing in the snow.  [LAUGH]
R:  You've like what?
L:  Playing in the snow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Building snow men.  That's about it.
R:  I grew up in New England and I had my fill of it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  I've got a friend in Massachusetts. 
R:  Oh, and you don't like the -- what is that white stuff?  To me, my idea of a fun thing to do in the snow is sit inside with a mug of cocoa.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we do that most of the time.
R:  And a good book.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Watch TV, movies, you know.
R:  [LAUGH] With some --
L:  Or read.
R:  -- popcorn, yep.  Yep, that's about the only use I have for cold weather activities.  Uh, warm weather stuff, swimming.  I love to go swimming.
L:  Yeah, I can -- I can do that.
R:  I prefer pools.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, or lakes.  I'm not real crazy about the ocean.  I go for walks at the ocean.
L:  Hm.
R:  And when I was back home, back up in Rhode Island, I used to go horseback riding down, you know, on the beach at the ocean, but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't like swimming at the ocean.
L:  Hm.  I -- well, I've only been to Virginia Beach and I miss -- I'm never really actually -- I used to have a pool when I was smaller, but ... I haven't been swimming in I don't know how long.  I mean, it -- it's been years.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I mean, I love just going out and get the garden hose and ... [LAUGH] have a sprinkler and run through it or something.
R:  Yeah, put the sprinkler on and let the kids run through it.  I remember doing that when we were kids.  Ah. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Huh, that and the trampoline. 
L:  Now, that's one thing I'm not brave enough to do [LAUGH] ...
R:  Is that right?
L:  -- is trampoline.
R:  I'm not brave enough to really bou- when I was -- when I was a kid I used to love that.  That used to be probably my favorite.  I didn't like, like, the horse because I had bad ankles and when they'd make us do that kinda stuff, I never liked that stuff.  You know, walking on beams because I never knew when my ankle was gonna give out.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It wasn't fun [LAUGH] you know?  But the trampoline, it didn't -- not if my ankle gave out I just ... [LAUGH] I just bounced some more, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Let's see.  Um ... [LIPSMACK] well, I like to play ... well, when it's cold weather I like to stay inside and play card games too.
R:  Yeah.  Card games or board games.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Rummy ...
R:  Yeah, that's fun.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, Monopoly.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Scrabble.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Boggle.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Um, Pacino[?].  Have you ever played that?
L:  No.  Uh-uh.
R:  It's, um -- it's kinda hard to find.  The only place you can find it is, like, Toys R Us and, um ...
L:  Hm.
R:  -- they have a -- a house brand of this -- well, if you ask for that they'll tell you what it is they call it.  Something a little bit different.  And what it is is it's cards and ... and it's se- like Bingo you can get five up, five down, five across and each one of those is opposed to it being numbers is a playing card that makes a poker hand.
L:  Hm.
R:  And so the first one to get -- that gets Pacino and the way we used to play it was we used to do three pots and everybody that played put a penny in each pot ...
L:  Hm.
R:  -- and if you got the center card then you got ... the center -- you got the middle roll of money, because sometimes you wouldn't get it every single hand.  Whoever got the first Pacino got the first ... pot and then the last pot was for four corners.  If you got all four corners.  Sometimes that one would build up and you might -- would get seventy five cents.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Hm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I used to be a real tennis nut.  I mean, when I was -- when I was young -- I haven't played tennis in a while either but when I was younger I used to live close to a tennis court and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a friend down the street and I would go and play tennis.  Every afternoon [LAUGH] ... every afternoon, uh, during the summer [LIPSMACK] and ... I loved badminton, um ...
R:  Badminton's a lot of fun.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I like badminton, yeah.
L:  Ping pong.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Pinball.
R:  I like badminton actually better than I like ping pong.
L:  I'm good at pinball so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!
L:  I, uh -- I'm not too good at speed ball, but, uh ...
R:  What's speed ball?
L:  Speed ball?  Well, it's like taking a ball and throwing it up in different rings, you know, and it goes in ... ring and ... if like five, ten, fifteen, twenty on down.
R:  Kinda like ski?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like that game that they have at some of the arcades?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Where you roll it up and try and get it into the center ring?
L:  Yeah, we call it speed ball.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah?  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] And, um ... [LIPSMACK] I like, um ... th- I just like to watch the racing sometimes on TV, Nascar.
R:  Mhm.  Who's your driver?
L:  Well, I have two.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  Daryl Jarred and Tommy Stewart.
R:  Okay.
L:  Tommy Stewart because the guy I'm dating now, he looks like Tommy Stewart so ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And Daryl Jarred just because I like Daryl Jarred.
R:  I tell you what -- well, did you like Tommy Stewart before or after you started dating him?
L:  [LAUGH] After. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's the key question. [LAUGH]
L:  Because well he -- he looks like him so ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, we went dancing one night and the band that was playing, the guy -- do y'all know that we've got, uh, Tommy Stewart in here with us tonight, and I turned around and I looked.  Yeah, I was just looking, I -- and I did not think about it and he turned around he says, "Don't turn around.  I'm talking about you". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like he was like ... [LAUGH] and now we call him -- his name is actually John, and we call him Tony now. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, uh ...
R:  Nothing like having an identity crisis, right?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And, um, let's see ... now, I ... my best friend, she lived with me and my parents and, um, we -- we've been friends twenty five years and ... [SIGH] she likes Jeff Gordon.
R:  That's who I -- that's my driver.
L:  You like Jeff Gordon?
R:  Yep.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, boy, I'm in trouble. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I am in trouble.
R:  Why?
L:  She is -- I -- I tease her all the time about Jeff, you know?  It was like ... um [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I just tell her that -- I mean, I know he's not cheating, you know, but I'll say, "Oh, he cheated you know.  He got in there in front of him and he cheated". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm always teasing her.  And she said, "He did not!".  I said, "Yes, he did.  I saw him".  I said, "He blew out somebody's tire and he passed 'em so there". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But we have fun, you know.  We're just ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- doing all the fun and ...
L:  the last race that they ran, uh, uh, he's been my friend for years and years and years and he's like -- he was a diehard Ernhart fan, you know, and he's always forever razzing me about being a Jeff --
