R:  Hi, my name is Vaster[?].
L:  Hi, uh, I'm Lewis.  Yeah, this is my second time, so uh, go ahead, you can go first.
R:  And this is my first time too, so you have more experience than I do, I think.
L:  Oh, okay, so I'll, because I go really fast, all you do is just basically talk about the subject of, I don't know what they're looking for, but just talk.  Um, what was the subject again?  Um, corporate scandals?  Or corporate --
R:  And what the government should do to boost up the economy.
L:  Oh, man, that's a big subject.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, well I don't know it's just, the last one was the um, the Enron one, um, I was watching a thing on ah C.N.N. I think, um, they were talking about, um, there was, they have like a big list, there was like eight or nine ah CEOs and stuff or corporate leaders that were ah, um, I guess charged with ah, a bunch of offences, and then it had on the bottom, like, zero of them went to, I think eight or nine of them got convicted, but zero went to jail.
R:  Mm, that ... [MN]
L:  So, I don't know it's kind of off the wall that they can get convict for stealing, you know, millions of dollars basically, and putting all these people out of work and then not even spend one day in jail and then some people ah, can go to jail for, you know, a lot lesser things.
R:  Oh, yes, I agree.  I agree.  Ah, but um, I don't know, there are lots of people that, people that say that you get a different kind of justice if you are really rich.
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's basically what it boils down to, 'cause it's like, you know, this country is, the United States is basically a capitalist society.  So, if you have money you can basically get away with a whole lot.  Not everything, but a whole, a whole lot more than people who don't have money.
R:  But the thing that I don't understand about Enron and all this other business, like [inaudible], ah, uh, he couldn't find how many billion dollars?  I don't know, one point five, something like that.  I, the thing that I don't understand is how come this practices could go on for such a long time, and nobody knew about it?  How come, how come they weren't caught earlier?  How come they could get away with this for such a long time?
L:  Mm, I, I think it's 'cause basically the ah, the, they're a bigger, like a bureaucracy, you know it's just not like a, a team of, of ah, bank robbers, it's like a whole group of ah, um, guys telling their other guys there, you know, people under them and a whole bunch of people in the company, I think they have three thousand people employed, but, it's like a group of people, I don't know, key employers maybe, like all around the world, for Enron probably about, you know, about, ah, two dozen that are main, the main one that are making everybody do it.  And they're all smart people, so, they know, ah, ways to get around it for a while.  I think it was their bookkeepers, Anderson or something like that --
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  -- that was, basically um, they knew about it, but they didn't.  Kind of like, it's like ah, they were, you know, ah, "Scratch my back, I'll scratch yours" kind of thing.  They were paying them and, and giving them money, so they knew it, but they didn't know it, and they're not a police force, you know?  
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  But um, so they kind of looked the other way.  I mean there's a lot of people, and w- finally one lady I think, you know, the lady that actually told on everybody.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah so eventually, you know, somebody gets kinda like, "Hey this, this sh- is wrong", and then they do something about it.  But everybody's, you know, in there for their livelihood, so they're kind of like, they don't want to lose their jobs and stuff, 'cause ah, even the lady that told was, had a good, high paying job, I think like, you know, hundred thousand dollar as year.
R:  Yeah, I don't think people in lower positions even get to see any budgets of anything ever, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Most people don't really know what's going on in the company.
L:  No, yeah, exactly.  'Cause it's, especially a big company like that, they don't know, you know, where the money's coming, where it is, you know 'cause people, they have different investors, and probably they're public companies too, so it makes it more complicated.  So yeah, they're just, I think they're, well they're in the middle of reforming.  Now I think ah, the president, yeah, he ah, ah, got some kind of commission together, and they're supposed to, I was watching on T.V. right now, they just um, it's an ongoing investigation, and they just put one guy actually in, in jail I think.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, they're working on it.  It just takes time.
R:  Yeah but I, I am wondering if they could, if some club would put some laws in place or something to regulate at least the, the accounting companies, right?
L:  Mm.
R:  The accounting companies like, like Anderson --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or whatever, that, if they could do something.  
L:  Yeah well that's what they're doing, they're working on it, it takes time to, to ah, they try to, you know, set up commissions and then investigate and go back and back, and they got a subpoena all those documents for years, and go through them.  So, but, it should be like anything else.  You know, like when something tragic happens, then they do something about it.  Like this messed up the stock market jobs, economies and stuff, it's having like, you know, a ripple effect.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, yeah, once that stuff happens, and people get outraged, and then change happens.  But I think those guys, they know about it, I mean they have so much money that they can, even if they do, you know, get arrested and go to jail [SIGH], um, they're still gonna come out and have millions of dollars left over.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So those guys are like really, really smart.  But, um, that's, that's not it.  If it keeps them, they're still criminals, but they're ah, they're just a lot smarter, and --
R:  Now they're very rich criminals. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and bigger stakes.  Huh?
R:  Now they're, they're very rich criminals. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they're rich criminals, yeah.  Should write a movie about it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But um, yeah, there's not much you can do except ah, ah, be smart.  And now, you know, watch out when you ah, go get a job at some places, like, that you think are good companies.  Do your research, you know on the internet or whatever, and investigate them and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- make sure that, that they're good before you invest your time and money into their stock. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, I know.  Although I, I personally stay away from the stock market for a while, but um, if you want to get a job at the company, right now with the way the market is, I don't think that just me personally have lots of options for research. [LAUGH] Whoever gives me a job, I take it! 
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, yeah, well that's true too.  Same thing is like the economy, sometimes you don't really have a choice.  But, you know, that's just the way it goes.  Take a job wherever you can get it, and then just keep your money.  Well if you're gonna do that, then don't put it, 'cause I think a lot of those people put it, a lot of their money back into their, ah, into their retirement fund.  So they not only lost a job, but they were putting, like --
R:  I know.  Tha- --
L:  -- a certain amount of money into their IRAs and then, the company who's backing it with their money, but it wasn't real money.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  So they were losing, they were losing their money they put it, and then the money the company put in.  Actually, it wasn't any money, so they, they lost a lot of stuff, and not only their job.
R:  Mm.  That much I can tell just from that.
L:  Yeah.  I, some of the people had, like, um, hundred thousand dollars worth of stock they'd be working it for, like, like you say, it's been, it went on for a long time, like fifteen years. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mm.
L:  And I think Enron was part of that, um, that energy scandal, oh, ah last summer, or the one before that.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  When they, ah, jacked up the prices on everything and they said it was because of, ah, downed power lines and stuff, and then they found pout that it was all a big fabrication, and Enron was part of that too.  So [SIGH], yeah, it can get pretty ah, it can get pretty sticky.  So, that's what we have the um, ah what is it, the C.E.S. or S.E.C. to ah, watch them, but, it looks like nowadays, we have to have everybody watching everybody.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  So you think that if, ah, the government, say puts in place more rules and regulations for the companies to follow in their accounting, this is going to help the stock market, or you think that it's not going to react to it at all?
L:  Oh, yeah, if they actually came out and publicly said that they were going to "Do this, do this, we passed these new bills", then yeah, it, it will have a lot, people will have a lot more confidence.  Like you said, yeah, people don't have any confidence right now in the, in the stock market, and they're doing it, ah, spending their money on different ways like real estate and gold and different stuff.  But, the stock market needs to be ah, you know, it needs to be back the way it is, because it's part of our [MN] economy.  So, yeah, I, I think that will happen.  But they need to be a little bit more, ah, they're, right now they're real secretive.  But ah, they're, they're working on it, 'cause you know --
R:  Yeah, probably when the- come up with a good plan takes probably a lot of time.
L:  Yeah a lot of time 'cause it's really complicated, you know?
R:  Mm.  Right, [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  And these guys, these, these guys know what they're doing, they'll, they've got connections to brokers and everybody and [MN], and so they have to, they have to really outsmart them, like the IRS always had to be outsmarting everybody each year.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, it's why they changed the laws to make it all complicated, so you know, they make it real simple and everybody starts getting, they start getting tricky.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So --
