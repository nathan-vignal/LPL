L:  Hello, I'm John.
R:  I'm Janette.
L:  How are you?
R:  Fine.
L:  [LAUGH] This is odd.
R:  Yeah, new for me, too, so -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Where are you?
R:  Ah, North Carolina.
L:  Ah, I figured.  You have an accent.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'm in Los Angeles.
R:  Ooh.
L:  Do I have an accent? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Really?
R:  No.  It's about eight o'clock there, isn't it?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I guess it's all, er, relative.
R:  So, we're discussing the business issues, huh?
L:  Uh, yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, let's see. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm let you start. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Uh, how can we, uh, prevent, uh, illegal activities in business I think was the first part of it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, I'm going to say that, um, they need to -- the government needs to change the laws, uh, in regards to allowing the companies that audit, um, companies [MN] to not also work for the company.  In other words, they should be independent and they should not be allowed to be paid by the same company that audit them s- -- audits them, like WorldCom.
R:  Well, I think that they should screen the employees better and see if they have, um -- you know, dig deeper, like, test them for more drugs and any abuse like that before they hire them and then they won't be doing it in the workplace.
L:  Mhm.  That's a good idea.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, and they need to check them see if, um, if they have had any problems with taking money, stealing money, you know, and [SIGH] that way they won't be -- they won't be, um, embezzling money either, so -- 
L:  You know I found out the other day -- this is interesting.  A lot of the people that do the, um, uh, customer service, like you call a customer service number if you have a problem, are actually in prison.
R:  Mm.
L:  [LAUGH] That seems like an odd thing to allow prisoners to ge- -- have personal information on people like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, if you call to order something, like one of those infomercial deals -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- often the person that takes the orders is actually a prisoner, they are in prison.
R:  Wow.
L:  They farm out the, um, customer service so they have your credit card numbers and everything.  It's pretty scary.
R:  Shoo! 
L:  They should change that.
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH] I'm not so happy about, uh, some criminals having my address and phone number and, [MN] uh, credit card information.
R:  Me either.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They -- they could put a stop to that, too, couldn't they?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  That seems like -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it shouldn't really be legal but I guess it's like really -- it's a good deal for them because, you know -- 
R:  Do they get paid for it? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they get paid for it.
R:  Wow! 
L:  So, and they have -- you know, what else are they doing? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, that's true.
L:  [LAUGH] Plus, I guess it's -- it's much cheaper for the employers because the companies pay out -- don't have to pay prisoners that much, so -- 
R:  How do they know that the prisoner is not going to take our information and, you know, just, huh, go crazy with it?
L:  You see, that's the problem.  I think some of them do, actually.
R:  Mm.
L:  That's what the story was about.  Apparently some of them were actually writing down the credit card numbers and, uh, bringing them back to their cells and then they, you know, they're allowed to make phone calls so they were calling and ordering things. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's a little strange.  They could cut that out. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's true.  I mean, you never know when the prisoner is going to call now. [LAUGH]
L:  No.  Hey, I could be in prison. [LAUGH]
R:  Instead of calling AT and T, you know, collect phone call. [LAUGH]
L:  But, you know, that's the thing.  You really have no idea.  They should have -- you know what, they should at least have to identify themselves as prisoners -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then if you didn't want to give them the information you wouldn't have to.
R:  "Hello, I'm an inmate.  I'm" -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  "Uh-oh".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You're supposed --
R:  But I'm not, so -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I'm not telling you my credit card information, then.
R:  [LAUGH] No, I don't want it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] All right.  [LAUGH] Uh, let's see what else.  How has this affected us. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, man.
L:  Have you been affected? 
R:  The way the economy is now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, they do credit checks for everything.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  It's pretty crazy.
R:  You can hardly even go -- you can hardly even go to a doctor without having to do a credit check.  
L:  It's true.
R:  And I think they need to cut back on that.
L:  All right.
R:  I think people would -- I think we could benefit more if they could raise the minimum wage -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and if they could cut back on taxes. 
L:  Mm. 
R:  And if they would just, um, you know, not have to check credit for everything you do.  I mean, [MN] I can understand checking credit for, uh, what, buying a house or buying a car, but when you want to open, uh, like a checking account or savings account they have to check your background and I mean [SIGH] that shouldn't have anything to do with, um, whether you can open a checking account or not, you know? [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, I had them check my, er, credit the other day when I wanted a cup of coffee.  I thought that was a little too much.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Is Starbucks getting that way now?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, they wanted three forms of ID and, you know, my last tax return. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow! 
L:  [LAUGH] I thought that was a little too much. [LAUGH] I can't believe I'm getting paid to make jokes. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, yeah.  I think, um, a lot of people have been affected that hold stocks because of these companies and a lot of people, uh, even people that don't hold stocks directly, like if they have a [LIPSMACK] retirement or a pension plan at their -- where they work, a lot of times a good portion of the money of, uh, that's in those accounts is invested in the stock market and they don't even know, really, which stocks, so a lot of people have had to actually go back to work because, um, their retirement funds have been depleted because of these companies [MN] misrepresenting the amount of money they make and then the stock dropping to almost nothing.  I don't think that's -- there should be more safeguards to protect people from fraud, from the people -- from the reporting of income because it -- it affects the stock market and then it really can affect people, especially people, retirement people, who are trying to live off of their savings or retirement funds.
R:  Mhm.
L:  To have them lose not only their -- the interest that they are making to live off of, but also the principal of -- of their, uh, the money is I think pretty criminal.  I think it should be much more, there should be much stronger standards and also the people that are involved in that type of fraud should have [MN] -- should be punished [MN] more heavily than they are.
R:  Yeah.  I think so, too.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- I don't know how those -- some of those people can sleep at night.
R:  [SIGH] [MN] 
L:  Well, they rip off -- not only are they ripping off their shareholders but the people that work for them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's -- it's those poor people that worked at, er, Enron and WorldCom and -- that owned stock th- th- that were sometimes heavily invested for their future [MN] in that way lost all of their income.  I mean, that's, uh, that's like losing your retirement -- your entire retirement fund in one swoop.  That's horrible and they knew they were doing that.
R:  Yeah, the economy's gone down.  I mean, uh, heh, people losing their jobs and -- 
L:  Yeah, that's a problem, too.
R:  I know, um, it's had a real major effect on people that have had jobs for -- with the same companies for over twenty or thirty years and -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they're having to, um, cut back on their hours and -- or just -- some even have to move because they can't afford to pay for rent or pay for the mortgage any more.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, um, about stocks, well, [SIGH] I personally don't have any, but -- 
L:  Well, that's good. [LAUGH] You're lucky because this is a bad time to own stock. [LAUGH] Don't buy any. [LAUGH]
R:  But the- these people that have stocks, you know, I don't know if they're really going to the right place -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that you don't know if they're really, um, growing or if they're being invested in someone's pocket.  You don't -- you never know.
L:  No, it's difficult to know and these guys, if they're crooks, there's [MN] pretty much not much you can do about it.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, after the fact it's too late.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  So that's why they need to be more accountable.  They shouldn't just be able to -- the problem is that they will hire -- they can hire their -- the people that audit them to make sure they're honest, so they're paying the people.  What are they going to do?  Come back and say, "Well, we think you're dishonest"?  They want to keep their -- they want to keep getting paid.  Er, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
R:  No.
L:  It -- it has to be more independent.
R:  They need to hire people that they know will work instead of just --
