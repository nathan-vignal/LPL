R:  I'm fine thanks.  Where are you?
L:  I'm -- I'm good.  I'm -- I'm in Austin, Texas.  Where are you?
R:  Pardon?
L:  Um, where -- where do you live?
R:  I'm in Maine.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Where are you?
L:  Austin, Texas.
R:  Oh, Austin, Texas --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- oh okay.  You don't have any ac-
L:  I go to --
R:  You don't have the accent. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] No. I -- I go to, um, the University of Texas here.
R:  Oh, I see, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I -- I'm -- I'm a, I was gonna say a housewife.  No, I'm not.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm a stay at home person. [LAUGH]
L:  I see. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah ... so, uh, what do you like to do for activities?
L:  Um, I like bowling a lot. [LAUGH]
R:  Do you really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I did that about a month ago for the first time in years and years.  I hadn't done it for ages.
L:  Really? 
R:  Yeah, it was fun.  It's changed so much though. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  We- um, when I was in high school I was in the bowling club and we went every Thursday.  It was a lot of fun.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, we had that too and I really didn't do it much when I was in school but, uh, I did it, you know, after I got out and then I hadn't done it in a long, long time.  I used to love -- I'm from Montreal so I used to love to figure skate.  I still -- well, I'd like to be able to.  I, um -- I'm a little old. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  It was -- it was so easy, like, on the Olympics and stuff so --
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I can never do the spins or anything.
R:  Yeah, me neither.  I just used to -- we -- that's a big thing up there, you know, so ...
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  I -- I have, um, a friend in France who, uh, used to ice dance.
R:  Really?  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's -- I love to watch ice skating.  That's one of -- that's probably --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my main show -- my main sport that I watch.  I'm not really into all the other ... you know, the football and the baseball and all that good stuff. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  I have --
L:  Well here --
R:  Sorry.
L:  Sorry, go ahead.
R:  No, you go ahead.
L:  At school I -- at my school everyone's into football.  [LAUGH] A lot of people anyway.
R:  Yeah.  Actually, I got into it last year.  For the first time I sat through a whole game because I'm a Patriot's fan and I -- I live close to Boston.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, when they -- when they were winning the- I was there, yeah!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was very happy. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But my son -- ah, I'm a big hockey -- I -- I -- I was, as I say, brought up in Montreal so hockey is ... the big, big thing.  And my son --
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  -- played it for years, so yeah, I -- I love to watch hockey.  So, that's -- I guess th- that's probably my most favorite sport, was skating and ... anything to do with ice. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  When you come from up there it's ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you get used to it.  But -- and then the summer it's the beach.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah, I live near the beach so yes. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Is -- is your water cold there?
R:  Oh, yes. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's refreshing. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know I went to Florida once, oh, several years ago and I went, you know, got in the water.  It's like -- it's like bath water. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  I'm used to this cold crispy, you know ... [MN] uh, cold, crispy water we got -- we have in Maine, but, uh -- but it is refreshing.  I mean, you know, on a ninety degree day it's -- it's kinda nice, but --
L:  Yeah, I -- I say, um ... I'm from Houston.  I'm just going to school here and there's a beach in Galveston which is about an hour away but ... it's -- the water's usually all brown and it's not very nice. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah.  Well, you're not -- the question -- there's no -- is there any ocean around you? [LAUGH]
L:  Hm?
R:  Any ocean?
L:  Um --
R:  You don't have any?
L:  Um, not really.  I- um, just ... like Galveston which is on the Gulf of Mexico but it's not, you know, like I said, it's not very nice.
R:  Right.
L:  But here -- here in Austin, you know, it's like in central higher Texas.
R:  Ooh.
L:  So, we have, um [LIPSMACK] like Austin and there's also a river, I think.  Yeah.
R:  Well, I lived there when I was ill for a few months way back, way, way back in the sixties, and, uh, that was the one thing I really missed, because I -- I love ... the reason I moved down from Montreal down here -- I mean, I met my husband, that's one reason, but, uh, the fact that, you know, it's on the ocean and the beaches --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I love all that.
L:  Yes.
R:  So, I ... it was --
L:  It's very dry in Arizona.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it was kinda strange being out in the desert, but no, I definitely love -- love the, uh, I love the ocean.  Anything to do with, you know, outside.  I probably am more an outside person than I am ... you know, indoors.
L:  Yes, yes.  Th- when -- where did you live in Arizona?
R:  Ninety sixty seven.
L:  No, um, where, sorry.
R:  Oh, where?  Sorry, in Phoenix.
L:  Okay, yeah, I went to Phoenix in, um -- in middle school with my, um -- I was on the chess team and we went there for nationals.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Uh, the national championship was in Arizona that year.
R:  Now, that -- I -- I learnt to play that and it's like that takes a lot of, I don't know, brain power?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  You have to really concentrate.
R:  [COUGH] Yes.  Yeah, I was never very good.  My -- my ex-husband was really good at it and he tried to teach me and it's like ... sometimes I'd, you know, just luck out and hit the -- hit it right and move the right [inaudible] man --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but other than that, no, no.  It -- it -- no, couldn't do it.  But, boy, you must be really good to have made the ... the nationals.
L:  I was -- I was -- I was ... pretty average.  I don't know.  Like, our team was just really close knit and that's why everyone got to go.  It wasn't that ... based completely on skills, but our team was really good.  We got third place at nationals that year.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's great.  Another thing I really like to do too, and I don't know they consider -- I guess it's an activity, I love to karaoke.  I'm lousy! 
L:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
R:  I'm lousy, but I love to do it. [LAUGH]
L:  It's fun.  We went for my friend's fifteenth birthday a few years ago.  It -- it was a lot of fun ... even though I'm really horrible. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's it and I've -- I've been to, you know, quite a few clubs that have it and, uh, you get -- I mean, some of them get up and blow you away because they're so good, and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, then you have me and I've never gotten up in public and done it.  I do it at a friend's house.  She has a professional machine.
L:  Oh.
R:  And we party over there and, you know, I'll do it there with friends that I know but no, I've never gotten ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I -- [LAUGH]
R:  Me?  I'd clear the joint for sure. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I -- I -- I -- I don't mean -- I don't do it by myself.  Only when my -- a bunch of friends go up on stage with me.  The same.  But, yeah, it's fun.
R:  Yeah, it is.  It is.  Uh, I don't know.  I guess, I -- I -- I'm a silly -- I'm quite a bit older than you, but I -- you know, when it comes right down to things, I think -- I think we, you know, pe- kids -- kids, young people, still like the same things that I -- you know, I did when I was in school and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't think that changes that much, you know?
L:  Not really.
R:  Not really, no.  No, um, I have four sons and, you know, they're in their, like, twenties and thirties and, uh, they ... pretty much -- well, though my -- one of my sons is  big, big into, uh, the video games --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- which I'm not -- I'm not.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Not at all.  I'm into the computer ... big time. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But not the video games.
L:  Yeah, I have so many friends who are addicted to video games.  It's ... it's horrible and they're also violent.  A lot of them anyway.  I don't like the violence.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh.  No, I -- I, uh, I'd find myself -- I get too -- too involved, you know?  I get really wrapped up. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I'm not, uh ... I haven't really -- my -- my grandchildren who are young, you know, seven and five, they -- they're in to them, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  They sit and play.  You know that blows my mind because I've just been on the computer for three years and I was one of those ones that never, ever was gonna learn how to -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- use a computer! [LAUGH] Oh.  [LIPSMACK] But, uh ... I don't know, I guess -- and, you know, what -- what ... I'm -- I'm -- you said you were in college?
L:  Yes.  And this is my first year actually.
R:  Oh actually -- oh, good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And what are you going in for?
L:  Um, right now I'm doing Latin American studies but I'm not really sure what I want to do with that, so I might, um, choose to double major with something else.  I'm not sure yet though.
R:  Uh-huh.  I -- well, very good.  Very good.  I have -- one of my kids finished college.  The other three are -- one took in -- uh, [MN] he's in Alaska.  He takes, uh ... what does my other son do?  He's into refrigeration.  He just got --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- his license for that, yeah.  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  Cool.
R:  And then my other son's a manager of a -- a CVS store and ... so, yeah, they're all doing pretty good.  And the other one is just -- he's an artist so ... [LIPSMACK]
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, um, how do you like the weather up there?
R:  Up here?  Uh, today actually was rotten.  It rained all day, but normally it -- we're just starting to get some nice weather.  We had in one day in the eighties last week --
L:  Oh, wow --
R:  -- which was a little bit warm, too fast, you know?  
L:  See --
R:  We went from like thirty to eighty in a matter of one day. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it's so hot down here.
R:  That --
L:  I mean, it gets cold in the winter but not -- not that cold.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, it -- it got up to like ninety four two days ago.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I -- that would seem -- uh, I lived in Arizona in -- from September 'til February and even though it was winter out there, there were days when it was hot, and I don't -- I don't like the humid- well, they don't have humidity but when hot is hot [LAUGH], you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when it's almost ninety it -- or ninety five degrees, it's hot so ...
L:  Yeah.  See, Houst- --
R:  I'm not one for the heat.
L:  Houston is so hot and extremely humid.  It's ... disgusting in the summer.  [LAUGH] It's horrible.
R:  Yeah, I -- I think I would prefer, uh ... well, I've been to Florida and that was hot too but not quite as bad, even though --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's humid, but I -- I definitely ... I definitely like the four seasons, and that's --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and that -- and you know, I love fall here.  Fall in New England is just unbelievable.
L:  Oh, I know.  I've seen plenty of pictures. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  It's -- it -- it is and it's, you know, they --
