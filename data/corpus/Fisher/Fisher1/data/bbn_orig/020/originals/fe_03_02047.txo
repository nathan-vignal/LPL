R:  [NOISE] Hi, my name's Joy.
L:  Hi, my name is Suzie.   
R:  [MN] And we're supposed to talk about what we like to do in hot or cold weather.
L:  Right.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is --
R:  I definitely -- 
L:  -- my first one. [LAUGH]
R:  Mine too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I definitely do not like to do anything when it's cold.
L:  Me neither.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I definitely, um, -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't really like hot weather either, though.
R:  No, I don't like to be really hot. [NOISE] [MN] Where do you -- where do you live?
L:  I live in Seattle.
R:  Oh!  Well, you are in about the same boat I am.  I'm in Portland.  [MN]
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  In Portland, Oregon.
L:  Right.  So about the same whether?
R:  Yeah.
L:  We are lucky.  We don't get it too hot or too cold, but, um, --
R:  Do you guys camp?
L:  We do like to camp.  [NOISE] Um, [NOISE] and that's definitely more of a -- a summer activity.  We like to -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, also go to the park, go to the beach.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, we go to the beach quite a bit.  A like to camp, but I'm usually the one -- I won't come out of the tent till the fire's built and the coffee's ready and --  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and then I'll come out. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's too cold for me.  We've got a little guy, though, that we've been taking with us since he was sh- [NOISE] [inaudible] he wa- -- before he was born, actually.  And he's like his dad: he doesn't get cold.
L:  [MN]
R:  [NOISE] And I'm always freezing. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] I -- I'm -- I'm like that too.  [NOISE] Um, my son is three and he's -- he's pretty much the same as his dad.
R:  Oh, isn't that funny?
L:  He's adaptable to any -- any en- environment.
R:  Well, that's how my son is too.  It must -- maybe it's a girl thing, I don't know, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but I don't like being cold.  I've got -- we've got a fireplace and I've usually got the heat and the fireplace going, like right now.  I got the fireplace burning right now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  We come up that way quite a bit.  Um, my husband's got family up there in Bellview.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [MN] Ahah.  We were just up there a couple of weeks ago, in fact.  When was it?  Yeah, it was about -- it was the week before last, I think.  [MN]  
L:  Yeah, I haven't been down to your neighbourhood for quite a while.
R:  Well, it's pretty much the same down here as it is up there. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I know. 
R:  Rain.  Like this morning my son had a baseball game, and I wasn't looking forward to it because it's always cold in the morning and they -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- cancelled it because of rain, and now it's sunshiny and -- and warm.
L:  [NOISE] So -- 
R:  Or warm enough to sit outside.
L:  Right.   
R:  [MN] 
L:  [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  Even when I come there, I like to go to see the Mariners games -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I have to have my coat and -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, now that they have the open -- the open arena.  You know, before it used to be closed, but now that Safe -- they have Safeco Field it's open and to me it's too cold.
L:  Right.  We always bring a blanket.
R:  Me too, and coat and everything else.
L:  Yep.  
R:  [NOISE] And then you have to park and walk, and I'm always bitching all -- I have a thyroid problem too, so I'm cold all the time anyway.
L:  Oh. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And my poor husband, he likes to fish and all that, and I'm usually sitting in the car, you know, "Have fun.  I'll be here reading a book when you get back".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] 
L:  Well, do you like to ski or do anything like that? [NOISE] 
R:  Um, I grew up in Iowa, so I never learned to ski.  My husband, he's -- like I said -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- he's from Bellview.  He knows how to ski.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, last summer I started -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to learn how to water ski [NOISE], and that's kind of fun.  But I haven't ever snow skied, uh-uh.  Do you?
L:  I've snow skied a few times.  [MN] We usually go water skiing a couple times over summer, though, so ...  
R:  Yeah, we do too.  [MN] You got -- what kind of boat?  You guys got a boat?
L:  No, we go with friends. [MN] 
R:  Ah.  [MN] We go up to, um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  We like to go to Lake Villishinick[?], but, um, the family has a cabin at, ah, Lake Merwin.  Do you know where that is?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  Campers Hideaway?  [MN] And we have a -- a twenty foot Sea ray over there.  We go --
L:  Oh, wow. 
R:  -- skiing and all that good stuff, and I'm usually freezing and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I remember one time we went we were going out salmon fishing and him -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and the son were all gung ho, "Woohoo, we are going salmon fishing," and I was miserable and I'm sitting in the boat.  It's like six o'clock in the morning.  Of course, on they go and -- and the boat wouldn't start and they were all bummed out and I was like, "Yes!" [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "Yes!"  And, "Oh, that's a shame, honey".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "You can't go out on the boat". 
L:  Even in the summer it sometimes gets just cold out on the water.  [NOISE]
R:  Well, yeah, and I'm -- you know, like I said, I'm from Iowa and back there when it's hot -- if it's hot all day, it's hot all night.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  If it's ninety, it's -- it pretty much stays eighty or ninety all night long, and that's great.  But out here as soon as the sun goes down --
L:  The temperature -- 
R:  -- if you are somewhere -- 
L:  -- drops.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  If you're somewhere in shorts, forget it, it's all over.
L:  Well, I'm glad --
R:  You're freez- --
L:  -- that it's finally starting to warm up.  
R:  [MN] I am, too, though --
L:  I don't know, I think -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- our weather has been pretty similar, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, you know, for here it's been so overc- -cast and gloomy and everything.  I mean, finally we had a nice day yesterday, and today the sun's out.  [NOISE] It's still a little cool out but --
R:  I [several inaudible words] and it's real -- it's, ah, pretty windy here.  But it's warm.  I'm out on the deck right now, and I wouldn't be outside if it was [LAUGH] any type of cold at all.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But the winter seemed to pass pretty quick.  I mean, I kept meaning to get out here and get the garden turned under before winter came, and winter's came and gone and I'm standing here looking at it now going, "Ew".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "I better get the rotor tiller out and get busy." [MN]
L:  So, do you like the garden a lot? 
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we do.  We got a nice garden out -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- here on the side of the house.  And I'm a vegetarian, so -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it really helps.
L:  Yeah.  We live in an apartment, but, ah, last week I went to the nursery since it was finally starting to warm up a little bit and got a bunch of plants out here on our little -- on our patio, so ...
R:  Yeah, you can still have a garden.  Sometimes that's even better to have a pot garden. [MN] 
L:  Definitely --
R:  You know what --  
L:  -- very controllable.  [LAUGH]
R:  Very controllable, because this garden sometimes [MN] -- man, you get out here and -- and when it's hot in the summer especially and you got to come out here and pull weeds -- I hate weeds and I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- hate grass.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And if you don't come out here for a couple days and you come out and look and it's like, "My God, how does stuff grow so fast?  I don't understand it".
L:  Yep.  I've got this little plant that's in- -- doubled in size in just a week.
R:  Wow.
L:  So I think I'm going to have a -- a nice little tree pretty soon.
R:  What -- what kind of plant is it?
L:  Um, let me see ... I don't know exactly.  I'm not real familiar with the plants, but -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  Oh, the tag is gone. [MN] 
R:  But is -- is it a house plant?
L:  It -- it's a house plant.  It's indoor outdoor house plant.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  I've been, ah, keeping it outdoors this past week, though, 'cause our patio's covered, so ... [MN]
R:  You ever grow herbs?
L:  I do.  I have a little herb garden going on too.
R:  See, those are cool 'cause you can plant them outside during the summer and then in the winter you can bring 'em inside.
L:  Yeah.  I did my, um, first one last s- summer and so we used it all winter.  I did sage and parsley and, ah, chives.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  And, ah, my husband loves chives.
R:  I do too.  I've -- I've got --
L:  So we went through those pretty fast. [LAUGH]
R:  You know what's fun to grow -- it really -- it -- it's -- it's -- you can use it for a lot of things too -- is lavender.
L:  Really?
R:  Oh, yeah, and it smells really good.  You can get the French lavender or you can get the, um, -- just the English lavender.  Oh, yeah, it's great.  Smells -- you can make tea or you can make, ah, potpourri, you know.  It smells good and you --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- can't kill it.
L:  It pretty much is very hardy. [LAUGH]
R:  Ve- very hardy.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I ignored mine all winter.  Like I said, it's sitting out here on the [NOISE] patio right now and it's starting to grow already, and I just pretty much ignored it all.  Same with the chives.  They're blooming.
L:  [MN] Yeah, the chives -- they grew very well, so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we were lucky with that.  The sage, I don't know, that kind of [MN] -- I don't know, it died off a little bit.
R:  Oh, did it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Huh.  I've got --
L:  I don't know why. 
R:  -- some -- 
L:  B- -- 
R:  I've got some purple sage.  I just --  
L:  They are all in the same, um, pot.  It's one of those really long pots and I have it sectioned off.
R:  Ahah.
L:  And the different herbs in different sections.  So, you know, they are all getting the same nutrients and everything, so ... [NOISE]
R:  That -- that could be -- I mean, some of -- some -- they might not be compatible.
L:  [NOISE] Well, it's between the chives and the parsley.
R:  Huh.
L:  [NOISE] So, yeah.  I'm going back to the nursery next week, so maybe I'll check --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [NOISE] out and get some lavender and ask them about that.
R:  Um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I've got winter green and spearmint too.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And those are fun because you can make tea or, ah, -- or boil them, you know, to make your house smell good.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  Those are fun, and they pretty much grow no matter what you do to them too.  I've got spearmint and -- and winter green, and they just take off every year.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And liquorice. [MN]  Oh, yeah, now I'm outside I see I've really got to get out here and get to work.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yikes.  Oh.  Well, hopefully we'll get some camping in this summer.  I've, ah, -- I've been going to a different doctor and on some different medication for my thyroid, so I'm hoping maybe I'll have more energy this year and not be such a stick in the mud and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- get out and have -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- some fun.
L:  Yeah, we are planning on going in, um, [MN] um, end of June, and, ah, --
R:  Where you going?
L:  We are probably going to go out and --
