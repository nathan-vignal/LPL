L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hey, that was quick. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  Ah, I didn't have to wait long to talk to you today.
L:  I waited, like, two seconds.
R:  Yeah.  Ah, my name is Audrey.
L:  Hello, Audrey.  My name is Hank.
R:  Hank.  I'm in New York.  Where are you?
L:  Wel- well, I'm in -- you're in rainy New York.
R:  Yes.
L:  I -- I'm in sunny Southern California.
R:  Oh.  I lived in California years ago for four years I -- I was out there.  I went to San Diego.  I liked it very much.
L:  Well, thr- -- I --
R:  I -- I liked that, ah, ocean, ah, area that you have.  You have a state park there, ah, Coronado Beach.  That was beautiful. 
L:  Cor- Coronado is one of the finest beaches, yeah.  I live in nor- -- in San Diego North County.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, --
R:  And --
L:  -- I'm coming to New York on Wednesday, so get rid of the rain. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  Um, I tell you, I can't tell you what you're going to get when you come because, ah, we go from sunshine one day where it's really hot, ah, to weather where it's, like, fall weather.
L:  Well, I --
R:  And it's --
L:  -- I lived in New York, I went to school there and lived there and just retired and moved out here.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And, ah, they -- my friends there say this is the worst, coldest spring or fall- -- ah, not spring, it's the coldest winter that you've had for years and years.
R:  Um, yeah, it was but I felt the winter went quite fast.
L:  That's good.
R:  Um, and, ah, ah, you're lucky in San Diego you're going to have nice weather all year round.
L:  It is -- that's why I moved here and the -- the topic was to talk about the weather.  There couldn't have been a nicer topic because -- 
R:  I -- I agree.
L:  The w- -- 
R:  But for retirement isn't San Diego kind of expensive? 
L:  Ah, yes, but no more than Manhattan.
R:  That's true.  And, ah, it's, ah, is -- Manhattan has an awful lot of things to invite you to when you have to spend money.
L:  Yes.
R:  Whereas San Diego you can go to, like, um, ah, beach areas.
L:  You can go to the beach.  You can -- you know, it's not really expensive to go to the -- the wild animal park or to the zoo.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's just -- it -- you know, it invites outdoors.  Living in Manhattan as I did, that did not invite the outdoors.  In fact, trying to get outdoors to do something became, you know, an -- an obstacle and a chore.
R:  Yeah.  I live on the east side and, ah, there's a bike path all along the river on the east side.  So I like to ride on that bike path, um, that's one thing I like to do outdoors.
L:  Well, I lived on fifty fifth street right by the East River Drive.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And I -- 
R:  See, you were by the bike path, too.
L:  Yeah, and I used that +bike pack -- bike path.  In fact, I belonged to the, ah, New York Athletic Club and we had -- we have, they have still -- you know, kind of a country club up right near Pelham.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I used to ride my bicycle up there. 
R:  Oh.
L:  Through the Bronx.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Holding my breath in some areas but, you know, no problems.
R:  So, um, do you find yourself outdoors a lot --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- or indoors?
L:  Outdoors.  Outdoors.
R:  Outdoors.
L:  I spend very little time compared to the time I was in Manhattan.  You know, in Manhattan you're indoors unless you're going to work or going out shopping or going to, you know, some entertainment.
R:  [MN]
L:  Sometimes on the weekends, ah, we had a house up in Connecticut so we'd go up there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And when we sold the house, ah, a year before I retired I brought my bicycle down to Manhattan with me and then that's -- I used to go down to the lower east side and, you know, on weekends it's quiet.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I could get outside but, it's -- it's -- it's a chore, you know, ah, you can't just sort of stroll out your door.  You have to take the elevator and walk down halls and go in and out of doormen and things like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you're talking to a converted southern Californian.  I love the weather 'cause I can be outside and run almost every day of the year.  In fact, this year I think there were two days that I didn't run this winter.
R:  I -- it's funny, I lived in the Marina Delray area for like four years.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And I was also by bike paths an- -- ah, on that are- -- ah, side, um, but I -- I tend[?], because my work was so demanding, I tend there were an awful lot of people at that time who didn't really enjoy the outdoors as much as I did when I was in New York.  But it has shifted a little bit in that I am more indoors now, um, than I used to be years ago.
L:  It's just --
R:  Um, the -- the air quality is not what it -- ah, what I like that much.  
L:  No, the air quality -- I used to run in Central --
R:  It's a little bit dirty.
L:  I used to run in Central Park. 
R:  Ahah.
L:  I'd go from work to the athletic club, change clothes and go out and run in the park, and I remember days in August and late July where the air would be just yellowish brown.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And just hang over the city and that -- that can't be helpful.
R:  No, it -- it -- the -- air quality is a problem.
L:  And here, I live about four miles from the ocean and we have a good offshore breeze, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  We have fresh air, cool air, you know.  Well, you've lived here so you know that --
R:  Now, what part of the San Diego area are you because that Coronado Beach was beautiful?
L:  Oh, I live up in Oceanside which is twenty three miles north of San Diego.  If you go --
R:  And it's on the water area? 
L:  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  Do you know where [inaudible] --
R:  Do they have bike paths like they do around Redondo Beach down where you are? 
L:  I'm sorry? 
R:  Do they have bike paths?
L:  Oh, yeah, everywhere.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  All of the residential streets have +bike path -- bike paths and there are bike paths along the beach, ah, w- -- Camp Pendleton is just north of Oceanside and that has bicycle paths clear up to Orange County which is twenty seven miles.
R:  Mhm.  A.A.R.P. had a, ah, convention out in San Diego.  Did you go to that? 
L:  No.  I didn't even know there was one.
R:  Um, are you online at all on the internet?
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, if you go to the A.A.R.P. website there's an awful lot of chat going on with people from all over the country.  They have bulletin boards.
L:  Oh, [inaudible] --
R:  It's like an online community and people kind of share tips with each other as to, you know, good places to travel, health issues, um, you name the topic.  If you haven't tried --
L:  Well, I'll have to -- I've never gotten on a chat room.  I'll have to try that.
R:  It's not a chat room.  It's like messaging back and forth.
L:  Oh, a bulletin board sort of. 
R:  Bulletin boards, and you can be anonymous, ah, going back and forth.  Um, you don't have to use your name or you can use your name.
L:  You [inaudible] --
R:  It's strictly up to you, and you can sign up to some groups where you want to use your name and other groups where you just, you know, every time you sign on you're just a guest.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's -- I don't know if you have to be a member or not to join, but it's only like twelve fifty a year and there's discounts on prescription drugs and -- and, ah, --
L:  Oh, I've been [inaudible] A.A.R.P. 
R:  -- and they're -- they're always squawking about various issues, um, you know, and people are debating certain issues that are of concern. 
L:  Well, that would be nice to get insurance, you know, information.
R:  Ah, information links, um, like for a while I needed, ah, some prescription drugs and I was able to get them from Canada, ah, at a very good price just for a short period of time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then I ended up getting them through the A.A.R.P. pharmacy service.
L:  The pharmacy.  I -- I've used that.
R:  But it was still a link on the, ah, A.A.R.P. bulletin board.  I -- I'm always picking up little tips of information from there.
L:  Yeah, I've used the A.A.R.P. pharmacy.
R:  Ah, the A.A.R.P. --
L:  They all send -- you know, I call them and they send them out within twenty four hours.
R:  Oh, so you are a member?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Oh, but you don't -- you haven't used the online community bulletin board? 
L:  Never got on- online with it.  I guess I'll have to try it out.
R:  Right.  Right.  And wi- --
L:  Some rainy day when I -- when I don't want to be outside. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  And I -- I tell you with the, um, um, A.A.R.P. pharmacy I belong to Member Choice which is fifteen dollars a year extra.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But you get better discounts but it depends on your, ah, pharmacy requirements.
L:  Sure.
R:  Ah, but it's, ah, a lot of members don't know about that extra Member Choice program.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, it's handed by Express Scripts which handles, like, a lot of union benefit plans.
L:  Oh, I [inaudible].
R:  And a lot of large corporate plans.
L:  So they have a very --
R:  But they do it for A.A.R.P. 
L:  -- have a small copay.
R:  Pardon?
L:  And then do you have a smaller copay?
R:  Um, I don't know how it works from California.  I only know how it works from New York City and it's very specific as far as whatever drug you're using.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You could be using one drug where it works really well only because of the relationship with the manufacturer.
L:  I see.
R:  And another drug it's not as much of a saving.
L:  It depends on the company and the drug, I guess.
R:  Right.
L:  But, you know, I live --
R:  So you -- you have to ask and shop.
L:  I live near Mexico so getting drugs are no problem. [LAUGH] [several inaudible words]. 
R:  Oh, that's true, they have discounts, ah, but I never liked that Tijuana.  Did you go to Tijuana?
L:  Oh, I go there, ah, if I need a pre- --
