L:  Hi.
R:  Hello?  Yes, hello.
L:  Hello?
R:  My name is Zada.
L:  My name is Dorrie.
R:  Okay, I live in the state of Washington.
L:  I'm in Michigan.
R:  Oh, wow, that's about opposite. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, sure.
R:  So, are you planning on getting as much warm weather as I get?
L:  Hm?  Was I planning ...?  Well, we've had weird weather.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you've been getting a lot of cold and, uh, snow, haven't you?
L:  It was seventy one day and forty the next.
R:  Oh, my.  [LAUGH]
L:  It's a beautiful day today.  Everybody's all ... mowing their lawns and planning the yard and everything.
R:  Yeah?
L:  The kinda weather you like.
R:  Well, I live in a real rainy state.  We get lots of rain and ... today's been kinda so-so.  It's been raining and then not and it's colder than usual.
L:  Ooh.  We haven't had a lot of rain.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But it's --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- kept us inside 'cause it's been so cold.  And we did have snow a couple of weeks ago --
R:  Oh, did --
L:  Lots of it.
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] that was unexpected.
L:  And ice.  Ice storm.  Uh, so do you -- do you like weather?
R:  Uh, I'm --
L:  Sports or ...?
R:  [LAUGH] I much prefer summer.
L:  You do?  I do to.
R:  I like going out in the sun.
L:  Well, I'm -- I'm not too crazy about being out in the sun but I do like to get out and ... walk around and drive around and ...
R:  Mhm.  So, as far as what they want to discuss about -- I'm guessing you like outside activities?
L:  Uh, well, when the weather's nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When the weather isn't nice, I'll stay inside ... and  [LIPSMACK] watch TV and work at my desk ... get on the internet, talk to my friends.
R:  That sounds about what I like.  I'm sitting at my computer right now.
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, I just went offline and the phone rang.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  We -- we have to do a dialup modem around -- I'm out in the country.
L:  Oh, huh.
R:  I can't get the fast ... online stuff.
L:  Oh, well, mine is too so ...
R:  Yeah?
L:  [MN] But then ... [SIGH] I used to do a lot of outside sports, but [LIPSMACK] I'm getting too old for that so I guess ... but we do --
R:  I -- [LAUGH]
L:  Huh?
R:  Yeah, I like to go out and watch my nieces play softball, but I don't like to join in.  [LAUGH]
L:  You don't?
R:  I do like watching.
L:  I never was -- I never was much good at softball.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Played a little tennis but not much, and horseback riding I liked, but ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] I married a man that doesn't do any of that stuff so ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I kinda depend on my nighttime TV viewing.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  I have a whole lot of favorite TV shows.
L:  I -- well, I have a few.  I -- what I do usually is just ... zip through the -- the ... with the, uh, control until I find something that looks interesting and watch it.  There's only a few that I watch [LIPSMACK] consistently.
R:  Yeah, I'm into shows like CSI and ...
L:  Oh, yeah, we watch CSI.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  But I don't care for the reality shows so --
R:  Oh, like Survivor and ...?
L:  Yeah.  I'm not interested in those.
R:  The other guy ... Overboard.
L:  Uh ...
R:  My husband kinda controls the TV.
L:  Wh- you too, huh?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] It's real bad.
L:  Oh! 
R:  It's bad.  He likes to flip around.
L:  Oh, yeah, he --
R:  I like [LAUGH] -- I like watching cart- ah, co- commercials and he always turns the commercials off.
L:  Oh, does he?
R:  Yep.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, my husband doesn't li- he -- e- every time there's one commercial every time it comes on, [MN], [MN].  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But ... so -- so you don't spend much time outside either then, do you?
R:  Not really.  Um ... I like to -- you know, we live on three acres so I like to go --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- out and walk around on it.
L:  Oh, you've got plenty of room.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We've got -- well, we're not exactly downtown but we're not suburban either, so we've got --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- a big yard but [SIGH] oh, we get out in the backyard with the dogs once in a while.  We've got two big dogs and we used to walk them around the block and take 'em down to the park and things, but we're both getting -- or my husband is semi -- semi disabled, and so we -- you don't let 'em out in the backyard, throw the ball and chase 'em.  Let them chase it, I mean, rather but ...
R:  Yeah.  I have three dogs. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  I like small -- small things.
L:  Well, [LIPSMACK] I would like a smaller dog.  [LAUGH] These things are horses.  I mean, they're just huge.  But -- and we had two cats but we lost one.  So, we have to round them up and take them out three or four times a day.
R:  Yeah.  We had a problem with coyotes getting our cats. 
L:  Oh, no.
R:  Yeah, coyotes and possums and ... [LAUGH] raccoons and things.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, you say it's real sunny out in Michigan today?
L:  Oh, yes, it --
R:  Wow.
L:  It -- it -- we -- well, we went out to, uh, we went out to eat.  My kids ... two of my -- two of our kids and my husband and I went out to eat.  When we went in it was warm, but the -- the weather is changing a little bit.  It's getting a little cooler.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, went out without a sweater, but, uh, when we came back out of the restaurant, I wished I had my sweater with me but we didn't.  Of course, we got in the car and drove home so ...
R:  Yeah, I imagine it's a little bit later where [LAUGH] in Michigan than it is here.
L:  Uh, yeah, it's eight o'clock.
R:  It's only five o'clock.  It's five o'clock here so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  We haven't even --
L:  That's right you're way over there.
R:  We haven't even fixed dinner yet.
L:  Oh oh.
R:  I was just thinking, oh, I should probably be doing that, but ... [LAUGH] yeah, I kind of forget about, you know, when you're talking to somebody on the phone, it's like they're in the same area.
L:  Yeah, you don't con- don't really consider that the difference.
R:  It's really ... it's -- it's almost hard to even imagine.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You're ... three hours difference in time. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, like, it's still daylight here.  It's probably starting to get dark over there.
L:  Well, it's ... not ... it's still -- it's still quite light but it's -- it -- you can tell that it's gonna be ... it usually gets dark around eight thirty around here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or after eight to eight thirty it starts getting dark.  [MN] And then everything gets quiet and [inaudible] we sit outside very much unless they -- just coming home or something from somewhere.
R:  Well, I sure hope we start getting some sunny weather.
L:  Oh, you haven't had much, huh?
R:  No, it's just ... we had like a inch of rain the day before yesterday.
L:  Oh, no.  We -- well, we haven't any actual rain.  Like I said, it's been snow and ... and we had that awful ice storm, but ... we had a couple of really, really warm days and then they went -- [LAUGH] and then the very next morning we woke up and we couldn't believe the weather 'cause it was so cold, so we stayed in.
R:  Yeah, we're ten or twenty degrees lower than normal right now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The other day it was in the thirties and it's supposed to be in the sixties.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, so like around -- for this day, you know, we don't usually ... we don't have extreme weather.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, we don't get the real cold and the snow like you guys do.  It -- but we don't get the real sunny stuff either.
L:  Well, you're a little -- well, a little bit nor- little bit far- further north than we are but I think the differences that you're ... west.  I don't know why it makes a difference but it seems like the further east you go, the cooler it is.
R:  Yeah, you know, I -- I think --
L:  Even when you're ...
R:  -- as far as Washington goes, I think it's because we're so close to the Pacific ocean.
L:  Well, that could be too.
R:  And whether it -- it comes up and it kind of goes north and then shoots down ... and goes south when it hits in -- into the rest of the coun- uh, United States.
L:  Mhm.  Well, we [SIGH] have water all the way around us but we're closer to Mich- Lake Michigan.  We're like ... fifty, sixty miles from Lake Michigan and sometimes --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- that makes a difference and sometimes it doesn't.  It just depends ... 
R:  Yeah, water can just -- it can make, you know, that really affects weather.  Yeah, hard to talk about weather for ten minutes.  [LAUGH]
L:  Huh?  [LAUGH] Yeah.  That wasn't the subject but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was more interesting I think. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  So, has -- have you been doing this long?
L:  No.  You're my second call.
R:  No.  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  And you?
R:  Well, you're my first.  [LAUGH] You're my fir-
L:  Oh.
R:  I think I got a call last night but we were out eating.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  I had forgot I left at -- about five o'clock for this ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  This is interesting.  I'm not sure what it's all about.  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm not either but ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK] I was -- I was referred by a friend of mine --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so sure I could -- she said, "You can talk". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] well, yeah, you're doing good.
L:  "I know you can talk on anything for ten minutes with anybody" she said.  "I -- I suggest you do it" so I did.
R:  Well, I know ten minutes is not a very long time.
L:  It isn't.
R:  And I just thought, well, I just -- I like to try new things and I thought, well, this sounds interesting.  Let's give it a shot and see what it is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I got an email about it so I -- I -- oh, heck, I'll check it out.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I'd really have a topic like pets or something but ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well ... there's lots of thing to talk about.  They said they had lots of topics.
R:  Yeah.  It -- it could be interesting.  Might meet some ... friends.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah --
R:  Make some friends.
L:  -- yesterday -- yesterday we talked about ... um, big business --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- corporations. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
