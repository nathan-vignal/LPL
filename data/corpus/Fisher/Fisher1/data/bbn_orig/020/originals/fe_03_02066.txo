L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hey, this is, uh, Rich.
R:  Yes, and this is Jean.
L:  Hey.
R:  How are you, Rich?
L:  Hey, I'm doin' pretty good.
R:  Good.
L:  I -- I didn't catch the whole topic.  I got the cold weather or warm weather and inside or outside.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Was there a third part to it?
R:  Ye- can you speak up a little bit?  I -- I have a little hearing problem.
L:  Sure, yeah.
R:  I can -- okay.
L:  Uh, I was just asking, the -- the question --
R:  Did you get -- did you get the name of the subjects?
L:  Yeah, well, I got -- I caught the part about, uh, you know, cold weather or warm weather and then inside or outside, but it seems like there's -- was there a third part to it?
R:  I believe it was.
L:  Oh [LAUGH] oops.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Anyway, what do -- what weather do you like?
L:  Uh, you know, I actually like the cold weather.
R:  Well, I was born January the first and I don't like cold weather.
L:  Really?
R:  One, because I'm asthmatic and I live in Georgia and this weather has been fine for me with my asthma and my -- not so much with my asthma but more importantly with my arthritis.
L:  Oh.
R:  Because I'm at that age.
L:  I'm actually in Georgia also.
R:  Yes, so you know what I'm talking about wi-.  Are you from the south?
L:  Uh, actually I -- I grew up in Alabama.
R:  Yes.
L:  And -- but right now I'm military so you know every couple of years I move around.
R:  Oh, wonderful.  So, you're okay?
L:  Oh, yeah, well -- and before I was in Georgia, um, I was up in Alaska, so it's real cold up there.
R:  And you like the cold weather?
L:  Oh, yes, I really did.  I -- I -- I just -- I liked the, uh, you know, the ... uh, winter sports, you know, like, s- uh, skiing and things like that.
R:  Oh, yes.  Uh-huh.
L:  So --
R:  I like football too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  I love football.  And -- but I don't have to play in it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  I go out to see it necessary ... which is seldom.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I watch it from the TV.
L:  Right.
R:  But, um --
L:  It's cheaper --
R:  -- I can take either -- yes.  [LAUGH] I can take either, uh, but not a lot of cold weather.  I don't prefer -- I prefer that it's warm.
L:  I have a lot of, uh, allergies too so ...
R:  I do too so you know.
L:  Yeah, that -- that was the one good thing about Alaska.  It was really cold up there but you know there's not a lot of pollen floating around so ...
R:  Yes, exactly.
L:  -- you know, it's kinda nice in that respect but ... yeah, I -- I like both of 'em but if I had -- if I had my choice I would take the cold weather.  My wife --
R:  I feel -- I feel the same way.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  If I had my choice I would take all the [inaudible] warm weather.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  But cold weather's good for the germs, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The snow will come and take away the germs and things of that sort.
L:  Yes, yeah.
R:  I lived in New York for twenty years so I know about cold.
L:  Oh, really?  Okay, well, that's where I'm going next.
R:  You're going?
L:  Yes, I'm going up to, uh, Westport, New York.
R:  Oh, okay.  I think I've been there at some point.  Westport?
L:  Yeah, that's uh -- that's just about fifty miles north of New York city.
R:  Going towards ...?  Is that ... going like upstate New York?
L:  Uh, yes.  It's heading up north from New York city.
R:  Uh-huh, because my son lives in West Spring Valley, New York, and that's upstate.
L:  Oh.  Huh.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yes, that's a lovely place.  It's lovely up there but, uh, when I left New York, I don't miss the cold weather.  Once and a while we get a little snow here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But a little.  A little, not enough to --
L:  Yeah, a little.
R:  -- make ice cream or anything like that.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Snow cream.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um ... well, we take what the Lord gives us.  He has to do his work.
L:  Yes, exactly.
R:  The snow will take away the germs.  It has -- it has its benefits.
L:  Yes, it does.
R:  So, what was the other subject?
L:  Well, the other one, I think was do you like, you know, to be inside or do you like to be outside?
R:  Well, I prefer both.  I -- I'm not a house person to say.  When it's nice, I'm out.  I been out today.  I t- get out as much as I can.  I do walk.  I walk a lot, um, because it's good for my health and my arthritis.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  Yes.  What about you?
L:  Uh, well, being military, I -- I spend, uh, you know, [LAUGH] a good deal of time outside and ...
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and, you know, even when I'm not working I -- I like to be outside.  I like ... you know, I like outdoor things.  I like, you know, hunting and fishing and ...
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, just anything outside.  I don't -- I don't really like to be inside much at all.
R:  No, I get claustrophobia if I stay in the house too many days.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] But I had to stay in there with the pollen, but I was sick so ... I -- that was okay, but when I'm well, I'm like you.  I like to get out and smell the air and -- and just walk and see all the beautiful things that nature has given us: the trees and -- and -- well, I worked on a farm when I was a young girl so I know about farming.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH] I've been around.  I was born in Salisbury, Maryland. 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  In Perdue[?] country.
L:  Wow.
R:  But I went to New York in the early sixties and stayed twenty years, and then I came back to Baltimore, Maryland, came here to Georgia with my son and my daughter in law and they had a baby.  I came to visit and I went back to Baltimore, packed up my things and moved here in nineteen ninety seven. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's great.
R:  But I prefer, this is good for older people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Especially my arthritis.  I can do with the problem once in a while.
L:  Yeah, my --
R:  But wh-
L:  Oh, I'm sorry.  Go ahead.
R:  Do you have family?
L:  Uh, yes, ma'am, I do.  I have, uh, I have a wife and two -- and two daughters.
R:  Oh, wonderful.
L:  Yep, and I was gonna say, my grandfather actually had a farm, uh, up in Michigan.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, I -- you know, I spent a little bit of time up there and then when he retired, he ... uh, you know, he did, uh, a similar thing to what you did.  He moved down to Florida.
R:  Yes.
L:  He wanted to get some of that warm weather too.
R:  Exactly.  You will feel that too when you're old bones start getting old.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I'm sure I will.
R:  How old are your children?
L:  Uh, actually, one is, uh, thirteen, and one is almost five.
R:  Oh, so you have a teenager and a baby?
L:  Yes, sure do.
R:  Yes, that's wond- all girls?
L:  Yes, both girls.
R:  I have five sons.
L:  Wow.
R:  Eight grandsons ...
L:  Wow. [LAUGH]
R:  -- one granddaughter who's twelve and lives here in Atlanta in, uh, Marietta[?] and a great granddaughter that lives in, um, the Bronx, New York.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Almost in that order.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Almost in that order.
L:  Wow.
R:  And there were no female but me until my granddaughter came along.
L:  Wow.
R:  And it's been good.  Uh, my sons are very good.  They're good sons, they're good husbands and it -- you know, God has blessed me very much and as a result I'm giving back to other people the [inaudible] in my -- are you there?
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, well, I guess I'm just down the road from you.  I'm in, uh, Douglasville, Georgia, on the west side of Atlanta.
R:  And I live in Dacata[?].  Well, you know where I live?  Near the Veterans Hospital.
L:  Yeah, okay.
R:  If you're coming from Drew Hill and you cro- if you -- if you're coming down Claremont Crossover, Drew Hill, I'm before you get to the Veterans Hospital.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yes, uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty neat.  That's -- that's unusual.  I talked to, um, one other person, you know, on this -- on this study and he was from -- I think he was from New Jersey.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, it's just kind of interesting that we -- we got linked up and we're both from the same area.
R:  I talked to a gentleman one -- and he was from Florida.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  He was living in Florida, yes.  This is my second call.
L:  Yeah, this is my second one too.
R:  Yes, uh-huh.  Well, I didn't get the other one the other night and I couldn't understand what they were saying.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And we got disconnected so --
L: Oh, boy.
R:  I don't know what happened but I called them and let them know I was still willing to do the study.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And I didn't get the last subject.  I had no idea what she was saying.  It just went off my mind.
L:  Yeah, well, I was switching telephones so I -- I didn't catch it either.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  They have to do a little better, uh, I'll tell them when I -- but the -- the recording.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yes.
R:  Perhaps a little bit -- be clearer and louder.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, the guy I talked to from New Jersey ...
R:  Yes.
L:  He told me that he thought, um, 'cause we kind of got off the -- the -- the topic that we were supposed to be talking about ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and he said that, you know, he didn't think that they really cared what you talked about.  They just kinda wanted to -- he said he thought the study was about, um, you know, your -- your voice patterns and --
R:  Yes, I believe so.
L:  -- and things of that nature.  He said they just -- they just wanna give you something to talk about so you don't just sit there on the telephone.
R:  Yes.  Uh-huh.
L:  So, and that -- that kinda makes sense.
R:  Y-
L:  I don't really think they care if I like the outdoors or I like the cold weather.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH] I believe that's what is -- how you -- how you speak on the telephone.  That's the most important thing.
L:  Yeah, probab-
R:  And how you are able to fill the questions --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that are asked because ... you and I may have a opinion and someone else may have another.
L:  Right.
R:  Totally different from what w- uh, we're talking about.  They move -- people move to different cities for jobs and things of that sort.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What is- -- -ever's available in that city.  I moved here b- because I retired.
L:  Right.
R:  But you're here because you're in the military.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  There's always a reason.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Why people move or -- or live in a place for lots of time or live there forever.
L:  Well, and this is a -- a neat place for us because, um, my family and my wife's family are both in Alabama so --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  -- uh, we're, you know, for -- for once in my career we're really, really close to, you know, the rest of our family.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, that's been kinda nice.
R:  When will you get out?
L:  Uh, I've got at least -- uh, I've been in for about ten years now so I've got at least ten more to go.
R:  Well, my -- my -- my brother's son, my nephew, he's on the US, uh, Enterprise and they were the first ship to go out but now they're, um, at, uh, Norfolk, Virginia.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So, he did not go out but my other nephew, my brother's -- this is another brother.  His son is at Fort Hood and he was waiting for his deployment orders but he had -- he didn't go yet.
L:  Huh.
R:  He's in the army.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yes, and, um, then my brother's son's girlfriend, she's in the navy, but she's over there.
L:  Mm.
R:  Yes, she's over there --
