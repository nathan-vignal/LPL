L:  Hello, I'm Sabrina.
R:  [NOISE]  So, do you like cold weather or warm weather activities? 
L:  Um, I like warm weather activities.
R:  Do you?  What type? 
L:  Um, not really sports type activities, I guess just, um, like going outside to a park.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just hanging out, um.  I don't like water but I'll hang on the outside of a pool. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  But, um, I guess I'm mostly an inside person, too.
R:  Ahah.
L:  Which do you like, cold or warm? 
R:  Um, actually both.  I like -- I like cold simply because I like to snow ski and -- 
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  Yeah, I like to snow ski so, you know, and I like playing in the snow, [NOISE] but, I mean, I live in Texas so I don't see a lot of snow but, -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, --
L:  I live in Colorado, so ...
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] so you do see a lot of it.
L:  I see too much snow! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah. [MN]  Yeah, I like -- I love skiing in Colorado but, I mean, I like the warm weather activities too.  I'm actually sitting here planning my garden in the backyard.
L:  Ahuh.
R:  And, ah, so, I mean, I like -- and I like walking, you know, going to the park and walking the dog.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, [MN] --
L:  Do you have kids?
R:  No, uh-uh.   
L:  Just either take, um, your pet to the park? 
R:  Yeah, my husband and I just take the dog and -- and, you know, go for -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I like to go for a walk in the morning or the evening and, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, you know, and I -- generally the same, I just like to be outside.  So, ah, I -- I try to be an outside person but I guess time wise I spend most of my time indoors. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, yeah.  I think it's -- I don't know, you get caught up on things inside of your house to do.
R:  Exactly, yep. 
L:  And then all of a sudden the day's gone and you forgot to go outside.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's funny how that happens on the weekend.  You feel like, "Man, I didn't get to spend any time outside".
L:  Ahah.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, that's why I'm hoping -- I'm hoping that the -- the garden -- we, ah, we moved into our house about a year ago so we haven't really done much in the backyard and I'm hoping, you know, that actually putting a garden in will make me want to go outside and piddle around for a while.
L:  Yeah.  I bet that would want you to be outside more.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Right now I take the dog outside and that's about all the time I spend out there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, sometimes it seems like too much wo- -- I don't know, actual work to --  
R:  Yes.
L:  -- do a garden.  I don't know, I have a bunch of weeds I need to go out there and pull.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, [LAUGH] yeah, I'd rather be inside at this moment, [LAUGH] and it's really warm out today, too.
R:  Yeah, yep. 
L:  So I should be out there, but ... 
R:  Yeah, well, you know, we were -- I was outside for a while, you know, because I'm trying to visualize my garden and it -- you know, it actually did get a little warm where I wanted to come back inside. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, yeah, that's true.  I lived in Texas, um, for a year.  I really remember how warm it got. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, I know and it's -- it's not even May yet and it's really warm here.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH].  But it's nice in Texas, though. [NOISE]
R:  It is, it is.  It really depends on the time of year, you know, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I guess, you know, your activities are based on what time of the year it is and -- 
L:  Right.  If it's so hot out that you feel like you're melting --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then of course you want to be inside and you are wishing for cooler weather.
R:  Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH]   
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then when the cooler weather hits I'm sure you can't wait for summer to come.
L:  Right.  That's it exactly.  I -- gosh, I haven't skied since I was a kid.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, I grew up on skis, I'm -- 
R:  Ahah.
L:  Since I was about six and I stopped when I was, I think about fifteen was the last time I went.
R:  Wow.
L:  Mhm.  I was actually --
R:  You know --
L:  -- pretty good for a while.  I don't think I would know how to ski. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I'm sure it would come back to you --
L:  [LAUGH]  It probably would.
R:  -- kind of like riding a bike.  Yeah, cause I --
L:  If I fall. [LAUGH]
R:  -- I didn't even live on Colorado but my parents, I think, started skiing when I was five is when I learned how to ski and we usually went once a year and there were a couple of years that we skipped, but, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, but, ah, I hadn't been in a couple of years and I'm trying to teach my husband, so I think --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I think he likes it now.  We've been three times since we've been married and I think we're going to start doing it yearly.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's nice.
R:  Yeah, it's --
L:  Do you -- do you water ski?
R:  Yeah.  See, we like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he picked up water skiing real fast but he was a little hesitant with the snow skiing. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, but we don't have a boat, so we -- we don't go out as often as we'd like unless we've got a friend who -- who's going out or something.
L:  Right.  We have a boat that we haven't used for seven years. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [inaudible]
L:  Because I don't like the water.  I really don't care to be out on the water and we have two little kids that I really --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- would be nervous with them out on the water.
R:  Really? 
L:  So the boat just sits in the driveway.  I know --
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  -- that's very pathetic but ... [LAUGH]
R:  I -- so I take it you don't -- you don't know how to swim? 
L:  I -- It's weird, I do know how to swim [NOISE] and, I don't know, I always went to the pool when I was little.  I don't know, I just started not really liking to be around water.
R:  Huh.
L:  Oh, it's weird.
R:  Yeah.  I -- 'cause I --
L:  So it's warm weath- -- warm weather comes everybody is water activities and -- 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- I'm like, "Oh, no, I don't want to go".
R:  Oh, wow. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause we -- I grew up with a pool.  I think my parents put a pool in when we were, like, -- I was four, again, like four.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you know, I grew up in the water and my sister's kids, um, have grown up around a pool.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they just -- you know, they're fish.  My -- actually, my mum was just telling me the other day that my sister's got a [MN] -- her youngest one will be two in July.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And her and the seven year old were riding their bikes round the pool and the two year old fell in the pool.
L:  Ooh.
R:  Yeah, but because -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- she's been around the water and in the water so much -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- she -- she swam to the steps and got out.  I mean, she was a little upset and coughing and spluttering but she --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- knew enough to swim to the edge.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  But I -- I still think I'd be scared, you know, more apprehensive --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with kids around the water.
L:  Yeah, it is scary.  I don't want my fears to --
R:  Got to keep them out.
L:  -- to be reflected on them. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So it may be one of those things that their dad takes them -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- by himself, [LAUGH] you know? 
R:  Well, yeah.  Do they know --
L:  "Out the door guys".
R:  Do they know how to swim at all? 
L:  Uh-uh. 
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  Yeah, they've been to pools in a hotel.
R:  Ahah.
L:  And I wasn't there.  That was on a vacation with their grandparents and they had their water wings on.
R:  Ahah.
L:  I just saw pictures and I was like, "Oh, no you took them in the pool! I'm glad I didn't know". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I think it's probably important, though, that they do learn how to swim.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, just for safety reasons.
L:  Oh, very important.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When you're a teenager and your friend throws you in the pool and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah, that'd be pretty embarrassing.
R:  Yeah, or you could -- to be a teenager and don't want to wish out on going to the lake with somebody.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, accidentally fall in or whatever, you know.
L:  Yeah, end up half drowning in front of your friends.
R:  Yeah, yeah. 
L:  That would be embarrassing.
R:  Yeah, well, you know, just safety reasons, too.  I hate to -- you know, I hate to say that but I've -- but I heard, um, a lake around here that some people went -- or two guys went out on a jet ski.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and neither one of them knew how to swim. 
L:  Wow.
R:  You know, and then, you know, jet skis --
L:  That's not real bright!
R:  No, it's not, you know, and you end up tipping over and can't get back on and, you know, you don't know how to swim, there's a problem. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, big problem. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I think that's just a safety issue.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...  So where in Colorado?
L:  I live, um, just a little north of Denver.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah, kind of by Boulder.
R:  Yeah.  My brother lived in Monument for a while.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's more up in the mountains type. 
R:  Yeah.  I went to visit him and it was beautiful.
L:  Yeah, it is really pretty.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it snows like crazy up there.
R:  Yeah, I'd imagine so.  You get --
L:  You almost have to be an outdoor person to live in the mountains. [LAUGH]
R:  I would -- I would -- yeah, I would think so, but I just remember, you know, being -- 'cause I guess he was kind of at the base of the mountain so you just kind of get to look out and have, like, this, you know, gorgeous landscape to look outside your window. [LAUGH]
L:  Ahah.  Where in Texas do you live? 
R:  In Dallas.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's nice.
R:  Yeah, for the most part it is. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I lived in Corpus Christie for a year.
R:  Oh, really?  Down south, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  It was very hot. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I'd imagine.  It's -- it's even worse down that way. [LAUGH]
L:  Ahah.  [LAUGH]  It was very humid. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  See, I don't -- I don't deal well with the humidity.
L:  Yeah.  I didn't either.
R:  My par- -- yeah, my parents live in Florida and I don't particularly like the humidity there.  At least Texas heat is usually fairly dry.
L:  Right.
R:  And we usually have some sort of wind.
L:  Yes, that's true, I do remember that.
R:  Yeah, it makes it a little bit more tolerable.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm. 
L:  Hm.  [PAUSE] 
R:  So, we talked about activities. [LAUGH]
L:  Activities.
R:  So you don't play sports at all? 
L:  No.  No, I'm not a sports person.
R:  Yeah.
L:  More of a girly girl. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Do you do sports? 
R:  Um, yeah, I played soccer up until two years ago.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, but I was playing indoor soccer [NOISE].  I played soccer in high school.
L:  Ahah.
R:  And a littl- -- I played it for fun in college and when I moved back to Texas after college I -- my brother introduced me to indoor soccer.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, it's a lot different and it -- it's a lot of fun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but I haven't -- haven't played soccer, I stopped playing, prepare for my wedding and --
