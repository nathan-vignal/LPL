CUSTOMS AGENTS AND THAT AND THEY NEVER THOUGHT OF SOMEBODY GOING TO TORONTO TO TAKE A VACATION INTO IRAQ OR WHATEVER GOING THAT WAY YOU KNOW AND THEY NEVER THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY AND TO ME  (fe_03_00679-A-0068)

WE JUST CHECK ALL OUR BAGGAGE THROUGH THE UH  (fe_03_00679-B-0027)
UH PORTERS AT THE ENTRANCE  (fe_03_00679-B-0028)
AND THEN SHE'LL TAKE UH SOME OF OUR HAND CARRIERS AND GO AND START TO CHECK IN IMMEDIATELY AND THEN I'LL GO RETURN THE RENTAL CAR WHICH IS OFF AIRPORT TYPICALLY  (fe_03_00679-B-0029)
COME BACK TO THE AIRPORT AND THEN I'LL GO THROUGH TO SECURITY  (fe_03_00679-B-0030)

MHM  (fe_03_00679-B-0040)
MHM  (fe_03_00679-B-0041)

AND THAT'S WHERE I'M SAYING TO YOU YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PRESENCE THERE  (fe_03_00679-B-0044)
IN ORDER TO STOP THAT AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY ITS GOING TO BE DONE  (fe_03_00679-B-0045)
AH BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WILL PUSH THE ENVELOPE  (fe_03_00679-B-0046)
AND  (fe_03_00679-B-0047)
THEY HAVE GOT TO JUST  (fe_03_00679-B-0048)
MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE IN EVERYONE'S MIND THAT IF YOU'RE CAUGHT DOING ANY OF THIS THAT THERE WILL BE SOME CONSEQUENCES THAT WILL BE SEVERE  (fe_03_00679-B-0049)
AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU ARE GOING TO STOP THIS  (fe_03_00679-B-0050)
NOW THERE'S THESE OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST PLAIN FANATICS AND ANYONE WHO WANTS TO DIE FOR THEIR COUNTRY OR THEIR RELIGION THEY WILL  (fe_03_00679-B-0051)
AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT THAT  (fe_03_00679-B-0052)
BUT WHAT WE'RE AIMING FOR IS TO MINIMIZE EXPOSURE AND FOR THAT I'M ALL FOR AND IT'S GOING TO COST US A LITTLE MORE MONEY  (fe_03_00679-B-0053)
THAT'S ALL RIGHT I DON'T MIND PAYING A LITTLE MORE MONEY TO MAKE SURE I'M GOING TO ARRIVE SAFE  (fe_03_00679-B-0054)
THEN AND THAT'S WHERE I FEEL MOST PEOPLE LOOK AT AND THEY'LL AGREE IF THEY DO ANY FLYING  (fe_03_00679-B-0055)
UH A LOT OF PEOPLE AREN'T FLYING THEY'RE DRIVING NOW AND I DON'T HAVE THAT LUXURY 'CAUSE IN HAWAII I START OFF ALL MY TRIPS WITH A FIVE HOUR FLIGHT  (fe_03_00679-B-0056)

THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU KNOW EVERYONE SAYS THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN HERE AND THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THEY DISCOVER AFTER A WHILE THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON UNDER EVERYONES NOSES  (fe_03_00679-B-0068)
AND LIKE I SAID THERE'S NO PREPARATION FOR THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO PRECEDENCE FOR IT  (fe_03_00679-B-0069)
