SCHOOL BAG AT ONE POINT AND I DIDN'T REALIZE I PUT THEM IN THERE AND THEY FOUND THEM SO  (fe_03_00694-A-0008)
I THINK THAT I THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO HELP I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHY THEY'RE SEARCHING FOR EVERY  (fe_03_00694-A-0009)
FOR NAIL CLIPPERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT LIKE I UNDERSTAND THAT IT COLD BE USED AS A WEAPON BUT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_00694-A-0010)
YEAH LIKE THINGS YOU CLIP YOUR NAILS WITH YEAH  (fe_03_00694-A-0011)
THEY THEY THEY TOOK THEM I COULD HAVE I DIDN'T REALLY NEED THEM BECAUSE YOU CAN JUST GO TO THE DOLLAR STORE AND BUY OTHER ONES BUT THEY TOOK THEM I DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT BECAUSE THEY JUST DIDN'T WANT IT ON THE PLANE I GUESS  (fe_03_00694-A-0012)
WELL AGAIN LIKE I CAN JUST I JUST I DIDN'T REALIZE I PUT THEM IN THERE AND I CAN JUST GO LIKE IT WAS MY MISTAKE 'CAUSE I ACCIDENTALLY PUT THEM IN THE CARRY ON LUGGAGE  (fe_03_00694-A-0013)
SO I JUST FIGURED THAT I CAN JUST GO TO THE DOLLAR STORE AND GET LIKE ANOTHER ONE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO IT WASN'T REALLY A BIG DEAL FOR ME IF I HAD SOMETHING OF VALUE I MIGHT ASK THEM TO  (fe_03_00694-A-0014)
LIKE HOLD IT AND PUT IT ON MY CARRY ON NOT MY CARRY ON BUT MY CHECKED BAGGAGE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT  (fe_03_00694-A-0015)
WELL I HAVE LIKE I HAVE NO PROBLEM GOING THROUGH LIKE THE SECURITY CHECKPOINTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT BUT THE ONE OF  (fe_03_00694-A-0016)
THE THINGS THAT I THOUGHT WAS A LITTLE TOO FAR WAS WHEN THEY DECIDED LIKE I FLY USUALLY OUT OF PHILLY INTERNATIONAL  (fe_03_00694-A-0017)
AND THEY WERE CHECKING SHOES THAT WAS ABOUT THE TIME THAT THAT SHOE BOMBER WAS GOING OFF AND I JUST DIDN'T I THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE WEIRD THAT THEY WERE CHECKING SHOES BUT I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'RE DOING  (fe_03_00694-A-0018)
DO YOU THINK THAT'S TOO FAR OR  (fe_03_00694-A-0020)
WELL ALSO PART OF WHAT I THINK PART OF WHAT I THINK HAPPENED DURING THE TERRORIST ATTACKS WHERE I THINK SOME PEOPLE I THOUGHT I REMEMBER THEM SAYING THAT SOME OF IT WAS THE EMPLOYEES HAD PLANTED SOME OF THE THINGS ON THE PLANES  (fe_03_00694-A-0022)
SO I THINK THOSE PEOPLE ALSO NEED TO GO THROUGH SOME SORT OF SECURITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT BRINGING THINGS ON TO THE PLANE SO IT SHOULDN'T BE THERE ALSO  (fe_03_00694-A-0023)
YEAH AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO BRING THE FOOD ON TO THE PLANE  (fe_03_00694-A-0024)
PART OF PART OF THE POINT OF FLYING WAS THAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FASTER THAN ANY OTHER WAY  (fe_03_00694-A-0026)
MHM  (fe_03_00694-A-0027)
YEAH SO AT LEAST YOU CAN AT LEAST LAND THE PLANE AND  (fe_03_00694-A-0028)
YEAH SO YOU CAN'T USE THE PLANE AS A WEAPON ITSELF  (fe_03_00694-A-0029)
UM I WOULD THINK THAT THEY WOULD I THINK THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER IF LIKE THEY MADE SURE THAT THE CHECKED BAGGAGE DEFINITELY WOULD LIKE BE THEY ALL WERE SCREENED TOO  (fe_03_00694-A-0030)
RIGHT NOW THEY SCREEN A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE BAGGAGE FOR INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS BUT NOT FOR DOMESTIC FLIGHTS  (fe_03_00694-A-0032)
I THINK THAT'S PART OF IT TOO BECAUSE IT'S EASY YOU COULD JUST EASILY PUT SOMETHING ON IT LIKE IN A BAG LIKE THAT  (fe_03_00694-A-0033)
LIKE YOU COULD JUST EASILY PUT SOMETHING IN A BAG THAT'S GOING ON A DOMESTIC FLIGHT AND EASILY JUST BLOW IT UP IN THE AIR  (fe_03_00694-A-0034)
[LAUGHTER] WHAT YEAH DEFINITELY LIKE AT LEAST COME UP WITH A WAY TO GET PEOPLE THROUGH THE LINES FASTER BECAUSE AND YOU CAN'T KEEP IT KEEP IT YOU HAVE TO FIND BETTER WAYS OF GETTING PEOPLE THROUGH THAT LINE TOO  (fe_03_00694-A-0035)
LIKE LIKE WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW THEY'RE GONNA COME UP WITH A FREQUENT FLYER CARD FOR PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN JUST GET MOVED THROUGH THE LINE FASTER BECAUSE THEY FLY SO OFTEN DO YOU THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA  (fe_03_00694-A-0036)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00694-A-0037)
YOU MEAN LIKE THE WAY AN AIRLINE WOULD DO NOW HOW THEY HAVE LIKE THE SPECIAL LINES FOR THE TRAVELERS THAT TRAVEL ALL THE TIME AND STUFF LIKE THAT MHM  (fe_03_00694-A-0039)
DO YOU LIKE THE WAY DO YOU LIKE UM DO YOU LIKE THE FACT THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT TOOK OVER THE AIRPORT SECURITY IN THE UNITED STATES  (fe_03_00694-A-0041)
MHM  (fe_03_00694-A-0042)
MHM  (fe_03_00694-A-0043)
WELL YEAH I THINK I THINK  (fe_03_00694-A-0044)
LIKE THE BUSINESS IS GONNA TRY AND DO IT AT THE LOWEST COST POSSIBLE  (fe_03_00694-A-0045)
YEAH WELL I THINK ALSO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT LEAST CAN STANDARDIZE IT FROM AIRPORT TO AIRPORT SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOU HAVE WE HAVE PEOPLE JUST RUNNING LIKE I KNOW IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT WAY NOW BUT MAYBE AT LEAST OVER  (fe_03_00694-A-0046)
WHILE THEY GET THIS DEFINITELY UM  (fe_03_00694-A-0047)
TRAIN PEOPLE THE SAME WAY SO EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME BACKGROUND SO YOU CAN HAVE SOME SORT OF THE SAME KIND OF  (fe_03_00694-A-0049)
SOME SORT OF STANDARDIZATION  (fe_03_00694-A-0050)
OF THE SECURITY MEASURES  (fe_03_00694-A-0051)

ACTUALLY THEY DID CHECK MY SHOES WHEN I WAS UM  (fe_03_00694-B-0014)
LEAVING OR COMING I'M NOT SURE BUT THEY DID CHECK MY SHOES  (fe_03_00694-B-0015)
ACTUALLY THEY CHECKED NO ACTUALLY IT WAS AT J._F._K. THEY CHECKED EVERYONE'S SHOES THEY HAD EVERYONE TO TAKE OFF THEIR SHOES  (fe_03_00694-B-0016)
THE GATE  (fe_03_00694-B-0018)
HAD SORT OF A MADE UP BOMB IN HIS SHOE AND TRIED TO EXPLODE IT IN FLIGHT  (fe_03_00694-B-0020)
THEN I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT EXCESSIVE BUT UM  (fe_03_00694-B-0021)
I'M NOT SURE HOW LONG  (fe_03_00694-B-0022)
UM TO WHAT EXTENT YOU CAN ACTUALLY UM  (fe_03_00694-B-0023)
KEEP THIS GOING FOR HOW LONG BECAUSE LET'S SAY  (fe_03_00694-B-0024)
YOU HAVE ANOTHER TERRORIST ATTACK INVOLVING THE AIRPORT SECURITY AND SO FORTH  (fe_03_00694-B-0025)
SOMETHING SIMILAR AT LEAST THEN YOU NEED OTHER MEASURES AND THEN OTHERS AND THEN OTHERS SO WE HAVE TO LET'S SAY  (fe_03_00694-B-0026)
RULE A LINE AND TRY AND LET'S SAY UH  (fe_03_00694-B-0027)
PREVENT THE PROBLEM THAT IS PER- TRY AND SOLVE THE UM  (fe_03_00694-B-0028)
ATTACKS INSTEAD OF PREVENTING THEM THROUGH UM EXTRA SECURITY WHATEVER  (fe_03_00694-B-0030)
OH YEAH THAT'S TRUE BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THE UM A LOT OF YOU KNOW AIRPORTS AND THE UM THE  (fe_03_00694-B-0031)
AIRPORTS AT LEAST BEING PILOTS AND THE UM STEWARDESS DON'T GO THROUGH THOSE SECURITY CHECKS OR THAT'S A POSSIBILITY TOO SO  (fe_03_00694-B-0032)
UM THINGS CHANGE AFTER SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS  (fe_03_00694-B-0035)
DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE IT TOO MUCH IN ORDER TO MAKE IT LET'S SAY AN INCONVENIENCE TO THE PEOPLE AND THE PUBLIC BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE TO BE AH LET'S SAY THREE HOURS BEFORE YOUR FLIGHT AT THE AIRPORT  (fe_03_00694-B-0037)
IT'S TOO MUCH PAIN TOO MUCH TIME TO WAIT THERE THREE HOURS AND THEN WAIT AND THEN  (fe_03_00694-B-0038)
IT'S CRAZY  (fe_03_00694-B-0039)
YEAH AND IT TAKES NOW I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_00694-B-0040)
HOW LONG IT SHOULD BE LIKE A BUS I THINK THAT'S THE WAY TO UH  (fe_03_00694-B-0041)
ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ISOLATED  (fe_03_00694-B-0043)
SO THERE WILL BE THERE WOULD BE NO LESS INTERFERENCE BETWEEN THE UH PILOT AND THE UM WHOEVER IS RUNNING THE THING  (fe_03_00694-B-0044)
AND HAVE HAD THESE INSTANCES BEFORE  (fe_03_00694-B-0045)
YEAH LAND IT AND LET'S MAKE SURE THAT THIS THING DOESN'T HAPPEN  (fe_03_00694-B-0046)
YEAH AND NOW I BELIEVE THE PROBLEM THEN [NOISE] IS  (fe_03_00694-B-0047)
BECAUSE I DIDN'T DO ANY  (fe_03_00694-B-0048)
SO DO THEY CHECK SHOES AND THEY CHECK BAGS AND AS  (fe_03_00694-B-0050)
UM  (fe_03_00694-B-0052)
AN INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT  (fe_03_00694-B-0053)
BUT DO THEY DO THAT DO THEY CHECK LIKE THE INTERNAL FLIGHTS DO THEY CHECK THOSE THINGS DO THEY DO ALL SORT OF THE SAME THINGS  (fe_03_00694-B-0055)
MHM  (fe_03_00694-B-0058)
YES I DON'T THINK THAT'S HAPPENED BEFORE BUT  (fe_03_00694-B-0059)
I THINK THAT'S DISCRIMINATION  (fe_03_00694-B-0062)
WAIT IN LINE AND THAT'S IT  (fe_03_00694-B-0065)
WHY SHOULD THEY GET PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT IF THEY FLY OFTEN THAT'S STUPID  (fe_03_00694-B-0066)
NO THE SPECIAL LINES THEY HAVE IS BECAUSE THEY PAY MORE THERE IS ECONOMY AND BUSINESS IF YOU PAY MORE THEN OKAY  (fe_03_00694-B-0067)
THAT'S FINE BUT BESIDES THAT WHY SHOULD THERE BE PREFERENTIAL LINES WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH SECURITY THAT'S STUPID  (fe_03_00694-B-0068)
SECURITY IS FOR EVERYONE IT'S LIKE HAVING DIFFERENT COURTS TO JUDGE THE RICH PEOPLE AND DIFFERENT COURTS TO JUDGE THE POOR PEOPLE DO  (fe_03_00694-B-0069)
YOU SEE MY POINT  (fe_03_00694-B-0070)
WELL  (fe_03_00694-B-0072)
DESPITE THE FACT THAT MOST PEOPLE LET'S SAY IN THE UNITED STATES LIKE AS MUCH THE LET'S SAY IN GOVERNMENT TAKING OVER CONTROL AND SO ON I THINK CERTAIN THINGS SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE GOVERNMENT EVEN THOUGH UM  (fe_03_00694-B-0073)
SHE MAY NOT DO A GOOD JOB AS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BUT THE POINT IS THAT UH IF YOU TRUST SOMETHING TO GOVERNMENT UM  (fe_03_00694-B-0074)
YOU'RE NOT SAME IN A SENSE SURE THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE  (fe_03_00694-B-0075)
MINIMUM PERFORMANCE  (fe_03_00694-B-0076)
ABSOLUTE MINIMUM PERFORMANCE WHICH IS LET'S SAY IS IN A SORT OF WAY GUARANTEED WHERE AS IN A BUSINESS YOU MAY HAVE A UM  (fe_03_00694-B-0077)
LET'S SAY AN ADVERTISED MINIMUM  (fe_03_00694-B-0078)
IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT OF WHAT THEY ARE  (fe_03_00694-B-0081)
YES EXACTLY  (fe_03_00694-B-0082)
I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY MAY NOT DO IT BETTER THAN THEY MAY DO IT BETTER BUT WHEN YOU NEED LET'S SAY AN ABSOLUTE MINIMUM PERFORMANCE  (fe_03_00694-B-0083)
FROM A CERTAIN  (fe_03_00694-B-0084)
LET'S SAY A CREDIBLE FACILITY CREDIBLE BUSINESS THEN  (fe_03_00694-B-0085)
