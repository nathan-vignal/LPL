HELLO I'M RONALD HENDERSON  (fe_03_00657-A-0001)
HI  (fe_03_00657-A-0002)
YOU KNOW WHAT THE TOPIC IS [MN]  (fe_03_00657-A-0003)
YEAH I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH HEIGHT- HEIGHTENED SECURITY THEY ACTUALLY HAVE AT THIS POINT THEY HAVE  (fe_03_00657-A-0004)
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT AROUND TRYING TO UH CHECK PEOPLE AS THEY GET ON ON THE PLANE  (fe_03_00657-A-0005)
BUT UH THAT'S ABOUT ALL I KNOW UM THAT THEY ARE DOING  (fe_03_00657-A-0006)
UM MAYBE THEY ARE ALSO SECURING THE PERIMETERS MORE  (fe_03_00657-A-0007)
O- ONE OF THE THINGS I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE DONE IS CHANGED ALL THOSE JOBS TO BE FEDERAL JOBS  (fe_03_00657-A-0010)
AND I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH HELP THAT HAS BEEN FROM THE SENSE OF OF REALLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE  (fe_03_00657-A-0011)
IT CERTAINLY INCREASED THE COST OF RUNNING THAT JOB  (fe_03_00657-A-0012)
IT'S MADE MORE JOBS THAT ARE A LIVABLE WAGE  (fe_03_00657-A-0013)
AS OPPOSED TO PEOPLE THAT WERE ON A JOB THAT WASN'T A LIVABLE WAGE BEFORE  (fe_03_00657-A-0014)
AND UH HAVING THEM DO THE JOB SHOULD BE BETTER  (fe_03_00657-A-0015)
[LAUGHTER] I AM NOT REALLY SURE OF THAT THOUGH I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE D._C. AREA  (fe_03_00657-A-0016)
AND WORKING WITH DIFFERENT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IN THE PAST AND SO UH  (fe_03_00657-A-0017)
UM MY EXPERIENCE OF THAT DOES NOT GIVE ME THE GREATEST UH AMOUNT OF CONFIDENCE IT'S ALMOST LIKE MY EXPERIENCE OF BEING IN THE NATIONAL GUARDS AND SEEING THOSE BIG BILLBOARDS THAT SAID SLEEP WELL YOUR NATIONAL GUARD IS AWAKE  (fe_03_00657-A-0018)
DOES NOT MAKE ME FEEL REAL COMFORTABLE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00657-A-0019)
YEAH WHERE ARE YOU AT OKLAHOMA RIGHT I'M OUT HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA SO IT'S A LONG WAYS AWAY UM BUT I UM  (fe_03_00657-A-0022)
I GOT THROUGH FAIRLY QUICKLY THE ONLY TIME WE'VE FLOWN LATELY IT WAS BUT WE WENT IN AND OUT OF THE LEHA VALLEY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT WHICH IS A FAIRLY CLOSE AIRPORT IN HERE  (fe_03_00657-A-0023)
AND THEY UM THE UH FIRST LEG OF OUR FLIGHT WAS ACTUALLY A A BUS RIDE INTO NEWARK  (fe_03_00657-A-0024)
AND THEN WHEN WE GOT TO NEWARK THEY JUST RAN US RIGHT ON THROUGH IT  (fe_03_00657-A-0025)
WAS RATHER VERY QUICKLY UM SO I DON'T I HADN'T REALLY NOTICED A LOT OF DIFFERENCE IN THAT SITUATION HAVE YOU FLOWN ANY LATELY  (fe_03_00657-A-0026)
MHM [MN] [MN] NOT ANYTHING NEW ABOUT THE SECURITY THERE  (fe_03_00657-A-0028)
UH WITH GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES OR NO GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES  (fe_03_00657-A-0029)
PROBABLY HASN'T CHANGED MUCH OF ANYTHING HAS IT SCARED YOU MORE TO FLY  (fe_03_00657-A-0030)
ME EITHER  (fe_03_00657-A-0032)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_00657-A-0033)
RIGHT ANYWHERE WHERE THERE'S A LARGE CROWD OF PEOPLE  (fe_03_00657-A-0034)
UM THE THING THAT WAS SO DIFFERENT ABOUT NINE ELEVEN IS THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY USING THOSE PLANES AS BOMBS  (fe_03_00657-A-0035)
THAT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT SITUATION  (fe_03_00657-A-0036)
[MN] SO WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE WHOLE HOMELAND SECURITIES  (fe_03_00657-A-0037)
DEPARTMENT  (fe_03_00657-A-0038)
PUTTING ALL THOSE AGENCIES TOGETHER  (fe_03_00657-A-0039)
[MN]  (fe_03_00657-A-0040)
AND THEIR NEW RULES IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY'S SAFE I GUESS THAT'S PART OF THAT IS EVEN AT THE AIRPORT NOW  (fe_03_00657-A-0041)
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LEAVE YOUR LUGGAGE OPEN  (fe_03_00657-A-0042)
SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GET INTO IT  (fe_03_00657-A-0043)
UH WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST  (fe_03_00657-A-0044)
YOU DON'T THINK THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE GUNS  (fe_03_00657-A-0046)
YEAH I THINK THERE'S A REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALLOWING THEM TO HAVE GUNS  (fe_03_00657-A-0048)
UH AND INSISTING THAT THEY CARRY A GUN  (fe_03_00657-A-0049)
I THINK THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF UH  (fe_03_00657-A-0050)
PICTURES WITH ALL OF THAT FROM A SECURITY STANDPOINT FRANKLY PERSONALLY I WOULDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH 'EM HAVING GUNS I UH  (fe_03_00657-A-0051)
I DON'T THINK THAT THE GUNS ARE WHAT'S DANGEROUS I THINK WHAT'S DANGEROUS IS PEOPLE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_00657-A-0052)
USING 'EM FOR BAD THINGS  (fe_03_00657-A-0053)
AND UH  (fe_03_00657-A-0054)
MHM  (fe_03_00657-A-0055)
SO YOU CONCERN WOULD BE THAT THEY COULD SAFELY TAKE CARE OF THE GUN  (fe_03_00657-A-0056)
YEAH I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT  (fe_03_00657-A-0057)
MOST PEOPLE IN IN OKLAHOMA CARRY GUNS OR HAVE GUNS OR  (fe_03_00657-A-0059)
THERE ARE A LOT OF GUNS YOU SORT OF HOLDING THERE  (fe_03_00657-A-0060)
WHAT ELSE DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING FOR AIRPORT SECURITY  (fe_03_00657-A-0064)
JUST TRY TO DO WHATEVER THEY CAN DO TO MAKE IT BETTER  (fe_03_00657-A-0065)
SO HOW IMPORTANT IS SECURITY  (fe_03_00657-A-0067)
COMPARED TO CONVENIENCE  (fe_03_00657-A-0068)
HOW MUCH ARE YOU WILLING TO ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO UH  (fe_03_00657-A-0069)
REALLY HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR LIFE IN ORDER TO BE MORE SECURE  (fe_03_00657-A-0070)
'CAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S HAPPENING WITH UH THE WHOLE HOMELAND SECURITIES RULES AND REGULATIONS  (fe_03_00657-A-0071)
IS THAT WE'RE MOVING MORE INTO AN ERA OF WHERE UH  (fe_03_00657-A-0072)
THE GOVERNMENT HAS YOU KNOW DOING ALL KINDS OF TRACKING STUFF ON PEOPLE  (fe_03_00657-A-0073)
