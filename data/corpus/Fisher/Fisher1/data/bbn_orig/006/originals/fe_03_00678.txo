R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Sue.
L:  My name is Susan.
R:  Oh, wow, isn't that funny?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Um, so, what do you think about that topic?
L:  I don't like it but ... [LAUGH] Pardon?
R:  I -- I, um -- have you had any problems with the ... uh, going to the airports and the security or anything?
L:  No, not really.  I haven't flown since, uh, the cra- crash into the big b-
R:  You haven't?  I did a couple of weeks ago and I know I felt a lot safer.  I think, I mean, for me anyway, knowing that they're watching everything.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, [inaudible] I think I had a, uh ... um, my sister's daughter came in on a airplane and we took her to the airport, and we pick her -- picked her up; but we walked her as far as we could walk her and, um, it looked a lot sa- safer.
R:  Right.  Yeah, it is my cousin.  I was with my cousin when we flew and she has shoes that have metal plates in them, and she had to take them off when she was going through security so, I mean, I know they're really watching.
L:  She didn't have to go barefooted, did she?
R:  Just, um, when she, 'til after she got through the, um, the security gate thing, the metal detector.  'Cause this type of shoe that -- she has Sketchers and they have metal in the shoes for some reason.  I'm not sure why.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But they just had to take them off and then they checked them to see if there was anything else other than just the -- the normal thing that's in there.  But I -- I was scared right afterwards you know as far as flying and what it was going to be like, but ... I know it hasn't [NOISE] changed anything as far as wait time.  I mean, when we were at the airport we didn't have to [NOISE] stand in really long lines or anything.  [NOISE]
L:  I've always been afraid to fly anyway. 
R:  Have you?
L:  Unless there was a death in the family, I don't think, you know, it could get me on an airplane.
R:  Yeah, my mother's that way too.  But, uh, I love to fly and I didn't for the longest time afterwards, but I think I feel safer with having that extra security there and people checking; and knowing that people aren't going to get any farther than what they are supposed to go.
L:  Yeah, I -- didn't they turn it over to military, this checking people now?
R:  Um ... I'm not sure if it's military exactly or if it's just government employees or you know, that they hired special people for the security --
L:  [MN]
R:  --instead of just any kind of Joe Schmo coming off the street.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] so they had to go through, ah, um, more security before they could even get the job, I guess?
R:  Right, yeah, like a high security level position is what it's like they're applying for now.  [NOISE]  They probably check everything about the person.  [LAUGH]
L:  And I heard from somebody else that, um, that the people are nicer that check -- are checking you out.  They're not so rude.
R:  Yeah, you know, come to think of it, they were.  The people that -- 'cause I've flown through the same airport before and the people were nicer that checked us through, a lot more patient, you know.  I don't know.  But I know after the experience I just had and this was actually my first time flying since then, um, I -- I definitely would fly again without any second thoughts about it.  [NOISE]
L:  Well, I just have a fear of flying altogether, so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have flown in it you know.  My kids bought me a plane ticket to Florida because one of my kids were graduating.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Before nine eleven, it was in two thousand.  [NOISE] Yeah, he graduated in two thousand.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, that was out in, it was a horrible thing.  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh no.  It's like, one bad experience; you never want to get on again. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I didn't like travelling [NOISE] by mys- [NOISE]
R:  Oh, you had to travel by yourself?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That makes a difference too.  I -- I had to fly once with two of my kids and that was difficult, [LAUGH] but yeah, I wouldn't like going just by myself.
L:  And I smoke [NOISE] so they had these rooms you go in and the rooms are full of smoke with people [NOISE] just standing in this little room smoking.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh no.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I didn't even want a cigarette.
R: Yeah, you wouldn't need one with all the smoke that's already in there.  [NOISE]
L:  And I don't -- I [NOISE] went in the bar, I was thirsty.  [NOISE] I got me a -- I think it was a V8, and I think I had, like, layovers, you know, drinking all that V8, it's the only thing I wanted to drink at the time, I had diarrhea when I got to the other end.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh no.  [LAUGH] Yeah that's definitely a bad experience.
L:  Well, I read, ah, you know, like, every hour and I got me a -- you know, V8 and I don't remember eating anything, I just drank those V8s.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But, I mean, all in all, as far as I feel safer anyway.  I mean, whether you like to fly or not just knowing that it's there if you do have to fly ... [NOISE] you know, I think -- that makes a little bit of a difference.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] I'm in Colorado.  Where are you? [NOISE]
R:  Arizona. [MN] [NOISE]
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE]  Honey, go get Mommy.  Mommy will help you.  [LAUGH] My nephew is here.  [LAUGH] He alw- he always comes to Aunt Sue.  [NOISE]
L:  [inaudible] call?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Is this the first call you got?
R:  Yeah.  I've had a couple of other ones but I haven't been able to do them and this is the first time I've actually been able to do the call.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well this is, uh -- uh, I was in the bedroom and I didn't hear my cellphone ring, so I saw a message on it and I thought well I'm going to have to stay in the room with the phone now.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  So, this your first one too?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I was wondering what it was going to be like but I like talking to ... people on the phone.  I don't know.  [LAUGH] I had gotten a call once that was a wrong number and I ended up talking to them for over an hour.
L:  [MN]
R:  Just about, you know, nothing.  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Well, I don't understand what this study's about.
R:  I'm not sure.  I think -- I don't know if it's more about, um, the way people ... um, react -- talk to each other.  I would think -- I mean, they give you a topic so you can ... have something to start with anyway but I don't know if it's just about that subject or if they just want to see how ... people interact without know- you know talking to somebody else if they have no idea who they are.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, they ask you where you were raised?  I wonder if they are picking people that were raised in the same spot or ...?
R:  I don't know.  I was raised in Pennsylvania, so ... 
L:  Oh, I was -- I was raised in Arkansas and, um, Dallas area.
R:  Uh-huh.  I don't know how they do that then.  I mean, there's got to be some kind -- you'd think some kind of common ... common thing there unless now that we're living in about the same area, I guess, that maybe that's it.  Hard to tell, some of these studies I'm not sure how they do them.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and I told my neighbour about it and she said, "Well, I wouldn't do it" and I said, "How come?"  She said, "Because I don't ... I don't know what they are going to use this study for, you know.  In the future it could be some brain altering thing".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, I don't know about that.  But, I mean it's from the University of Pennsylvania, so I mean ... I don't know.  That didn't really worry me.
L:  Well, that's what I told her.  I said, "Well -- well, it -- it's a well known university of research" and ....
R:  Right.
L:  -- and ... yeah, she was kinda negative as well.  I'm doing them anyway.  [LAUGH]
