R:  Okay.  We're being bad.  We're supposed to talk about life partners.
L:  Yeah, life -- life partners, huh?

R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He's a sweetheart [LAUGH].
R:  I don't know much about life partners 'cause I'm not looking for one yet.

R:  Oh.
L:  I told her just take it easy, you know.  No -- you're in no rush to anything.

R:  [MN]
L:  She wants to go back east.  I said, "You need to go".
R:  [MN]
L:  I said, "You don't need to be worrying about life partner" because her boyfriend wanted to get engaged for Valentine's Day.  I said, "What are you nuts?  At sixteen, you gotta be crazy".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- in this day and age so ...
R:  Isn't it funny though how you just find a total stranger you can talk to them for ten minutes without --
L:  What?
R:  Hm?
L:  What did you say?
R:  Oh, I said it's interesting how --
L:  How you can just talk to -- yeah, to somebody for ten minutes.  It's funny because I was -- I guess maybe because in the questionnaire they ask what town you were originally from and I was from New Jersey originally.  Maybe that's why.  That's where I live now so, maybe that's why they put a New Jersey person with me [LAUGH].  Figure at least we'd have something in common you know.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  Maybe that's why just --
L:  That's probably why, yeah.
R:  -- [several inaudible words]
L:  Did they ask you all the same thing, you know, what part of -- where you were from originally?
R:  Yeah.  Um I was from -- I'm from Uzbekistan.  I was born there.
L:  Oh.
R:  Right, and then --
L:  So, you were from there and see, I was from Jersey originally so ...
R:  Well, I was raised here so --
L:  Oh, you were raised here, yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Do you have any, uh, different customs as far as life partners?  Do you have different customs?
R:  I'm sorry.  Can you say that again?
L:  Do you have a different custom as far as life partners?  You know, in your family?
R:  Do I have a different response for life partner?
L:  Do you have a different custom?  You know --
R:  Oh, no.  No.
L:  Where did you say from?
R:  Life part--
L:  Where did you say you were from?
R:  Um, I was born in Uzbekistan but --
L:  Oh, that's what I mean.
R:  -- we're American now.
L:  Does your country have different customs as far as husbands?  I mean, does your parents --
R:  No.
L:  -- pick your husband or --
R:  Uh, we're Jewish so --
L:  Oh, you're Jewish?
R:  Yes, it's --
L:  Oh, you could have a problem too [LAUGH].
R:  It's --
L:  My first husband was Jewish okay --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:   -- and I learned a lot about it, cause you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:   -- but it was hard because I was -- I was Catholic and when we got -- we got married by a priest and a rabbi.  But it was all right.  You know, most of -- most of the family didn't accept me but there was one or two aunts that accepted me, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was okay though.  It worked out pretty good.   But, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a lot of countries have different customs as far as marriage, you know, to get the partners and all.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I have friends from India that, you know -- the -- their spouses get picked out.  Girls just sit around their Mama -- their Mama picks out their husbands.  They like it too.  They say it's easier, poor soul.  I don't know if I'd like it [LAUGH].
R:  With me it's more like, "Okay, we'll find somebody who's gonna treat you well who you love" --
L:  Uh-huh.  Right.
R:  -- et cetera -- but they would prefer he's Jewish.
L:  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  Yeah, because it -- well, it makes it a lot easier raising your children 'cause the children take the -- especially the religion of the mother.  The children take it so --
R:  Oh, I don't know.  I mean --
L:  -- in the Jewish religion they do.  So, yeah I'm studying world religion so, um, I know -- I know -- I knew a lot from being married to him and, um, it makes it a lot easier.  As long as he's good to you and he takes care of you and he supports you.
R:  That's right.
L:  It's good to marry in your faith though because you have a lot in common then.  Yeah, you really do.
R:  I don't stress too much about it because who knows.  I mean --
L:  You don't go -- you don't go to -- you don't go --
R:  No, I'm not very religious.
L:  You're not very religious?  I wasn't --
R:  So, it doesn't bother me.
L:  Out here, out in Arizona, everything's completely different.  I'm telling you.  They have very few Cath- they do have some Catholic churches but it's always what churches look back -- back east.  They're nothing like that whatsoever.  You know, they're very small, they don't -- you know, completely, completely different.  You don't see no stained glass.  You don't see none of that and, um, the people just -- the people here were very different anyway, okay?  You don't wanna come here if you want to find a husband, okay?  Do not come here.
R:  Oh, believe me.  I'm staying right here.  I like the city.
L:  Yeah, do you?
R:  Yeah, Arizona's a little too rural for me.
L:  Yeah, Arizona's f- oh, God I'm here ten years and I can't stand it.  I hate it.  Okay, every day I'm like these stupid people.  You know, I don't understand --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- how they do these things.  Oh, really.  And I'm gonna college with a lot of 'em.  I just shake my head and say, "Oh no, look at these kids".  They don't -- they don't know where --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're going.
R:  It's a bit con-- you know, I go online and maybe I'm talk to somebody from Arizona.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, somebody over there.  Oh, my gosh.  Here you graduate high school.  They're going to college.  I mean, it's weird if you're not.
L:  Yeah, right.  It's true. 
R:  Over there, it's like everybody's a construction worker at eighteen years old.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, they go and -- they go and that's where the money is right now, in construction.
R:  That's crazy.
L:  You know, because they built up from Phoenix all the way up -- all the way up north they started going north and they just kept on -- they went right straight.  Phoenix is almost all -- Phoenix is all developed and they went some to south to [inaudible], you know, through Tucson--
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they're building down that way but they're going up north too.  And, you know, that's what everybody likes to do and some people -- I go -- as I said I go to college with a lot kids but they don't even know what they want to do really because there's not really a lot of business here, you know.
R:  'Cause nobody's there thinks long term.
L:  No they don't.  They don't.  Everything's short term and --
R:  They think they'll be able to carry like lumber in thirty years.
L:  Yeah, I know.  Everything's, uh, casual here.  Ev- everything's casual.  They have no concept of, uh, of any kind of class conflict whatsoever.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, they don't know how to dress, they don't know how to talk, they don't know how to eat [LAUGH].  You know, they go out to restaurants in the evening and they dress in shorts and a tee shirt, you know.
R:  [MN]
L:  And I can't handle that.  I'm having a hard time with that.  You know, the women don't wear stockings.
R:  I -- I have problems with the --
L:  The women never wear stockings, they only wear --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, never.  Even in a bank.  They dress up in tee shirts and jeans.  They don't even wear, you know, dress clothes and you know --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- it's really weird.  It's -- it's funny.
R:  I'd have -- yeah, I'd have a serious problem with that.
L:  Oh, yeah, I still do.  You know because I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I don't go leave the house without my makeup in the morning and I wear stockings all the time with -- you know, if you're wearing a pair of shoes, you're got to wear stockings and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, you see, I'm not dressed without stockings and it's like they, you know, look at you like -- and high heels, forget about it.  Nobody wears heels at all.  I -- but -- you know, nobody else wears heels.  They wear sandals all year round.  They wear all flat shoes and they don't -- they hardly put no make up on.  You know, you just don't dress.  You don't [several inaudible words].
R:  Mhm.
L:  To me, I just can't handle it going to a real classy restaurant -- I think we're over five now.
R:  Well, why did you move over there?
L:  Yeah, I might be.
R:  Why?
L:  What are you saying now?  Are they going to say something to us?
R:  I said why'd you move there if you don't --
L:  Well, I was -- I went from there -- I sold my house in Union City.  I had a three family house.  My brother made me sell when both my parents died and I went to Florida for two years and it was okay but it was too humid and there was no full time work at all.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I met my -- my current husband there and he was -- he was from Michigan originally and we said, "Oh" -- and I had a girlfriend who was from Union City, on the same block -- she was raised with me and she said, "Why don't you try back down here?"  She come down here.  She was here a year at that time.  I said, "Okay".  So I came and I'm here and it's good for the kids because it's nice, airy open spaces.  They wouldn't make it up there.  You know, they could never go up there and live especially after being raised here.  There's no way they could because there's -- you know, the people that are bad, supposedly bad, you know they think they're so bad they're ain't nothing, okay.  They are nothing.  You people you just walk on by so it's a completely different life for them.  You know, I just take my hat off.  It's good for them, you know.  My daughter graduates high school next year.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she wants -- she's gonna go to North Carolina I think she said.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  And she wants -- she wants to go back east as my own daughter still lives up there.  She wants to go back east and see her sister.  And I said, Okay".  I was gonna take -- I was there nine eleven.  Of all the --"
R:  Oh.
L:  -- times to go back home and visit, right.  Nine eleven.  And, uh, I got stuck there and I came home and I was gonna go last year and I said, "No, I'll wait until next year".
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, it's just -- it's so different because --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- it's the same country and you think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- everybody's American but then people over there --
L:  Oh God.
R:  -- they're just -- they're so different.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Everybody's -- almost everybody's Mexican too.
R:  I don't --
L:  A lot -- a lot of Mexican where [several inaudible words] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a lot of Mexicans, you know.
R:  Over here, it's like I don't know any ...
