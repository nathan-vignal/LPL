R:  Hello.
L:  Hi. I'm Sandra from California.
R:  Hi.  I'm Megan from Ohio.  How are you?
L:  Oh, hi.  I'm okay.
R:  Good, good [NOISE].
L:  So, is this your first time doing this?
R:  Yeah, it is.  I saw it on a message board and I was like, "Oh, okay I'll try it" [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It's first time for me too so what do we do?  Just wait.
R:  Um, I -- you know, I think we're supposed to talk for ten -- I think, ten minutes on their subject --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and then they tell us when to hang up.
L:  Okay.  Um, what changes have we made?  What -- what about -- you want to start or you want me to start?
R:  Um, you can start.
L:  Well, uh, I'm in California so the only thing that I do, uh, a lot of is avoid crowds and, um, going anywhere, you know, like, unsafe.  We just had the Superbowl --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in San Diego.  
R:  Right.
L:  And I wouldn't have been caught in that crowd.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, if you would have seen the, uh, security that was going on on the TV, the way they were showing it.  I mean, they had good security.
R:  Yeah, I bet they had to.  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, so that's about it.  Um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I don't like to really go into any -- any large crowd.  Almost even a movie show you know --
R:  Really?
L:  -- because you don't know what's gonna happen in there and -- and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- especially then you have your children, if you have any children?
R:  Yeah.  I g -- I have a two year old.
L:  Oh, gosh.  Uh-huh.
R:  Yes, yes.  And I -- do you have children?
L:  Uh, grandchildren.
R:  Grandchildren? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Ei- uh, eight and ten.
R:  [NOISE] Eight and ten.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I have a, um, nephew who's eight [NOISE].  Um, well I guess I can say -- let's see.  I really -- you know what, we don't -- we haven't made any ch- the only change, well the big change, is that I was a flight attendant --
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  -- for Continental.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they, um, cut back so drastically that I ended up leaving because after being there for four years I went back on reserve because they cut back everybody.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And reserve -- what reserve is is when you first get started, you're on call twenty four hours a day --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and they can give you two hours notice to go, like, on a quick trip somewhere.
L:  And was this when you had your little two year old?  Your baby?
R:  I was coming right off of my maternity leave and going back to work.
L:  Oh, you wouldn't want to do that.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  --um, I was like, "Yeah I can't do that" so ...
L:  Well, I think that's fr- I mean, you know, chances are --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like they say of anything happening, but I don't know.  With the baby, I'd wanna be home with her.
R:  Yeah.  Well, you know, it wasn't even -- it wasn't even like a fear of something happening --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it was just my work was no longer the same because they cut back hours and I couldn't get the same, you know, kind of trips I wanted.  I -- like as a line holder you get a month's schedule and it's just your schedule but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as a reserve person, you're just whatever they want you to do.  So, they've actually offered so many leaves because they're trying to get rid of people there.  Like I have friends who are -- who have on leave pretty much since it happened --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they just keep offering more.  I think hoping -- hoping people won't come back 'cause they just don't have as many flights --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and as much money as -- they're not growing like they were before.
L:  Well, that had to be awful.  Wh- where were you when that happened?  September eleven?
R:  I was actually at home watching "Good Morning, America".
L:  Oh, you were already up and everything when it came on the news --
R:  Mhm --
L:  -- screen.
R:  -- yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I actually saw it on TV as it was happening.
L:  Mhm.  I got a fax from a friend and my daughter came in and said, "Turn the TV on, turn the TV on" and, uh, of course I seen the second thing live but it's, like, leaves you speechless, you know.  I -- I --
R:  I know, I know.
L:  -- um, you can't imagine.  That's about the worst thing we've, uh -- I'm sixty [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  Grandma [LAUGH] but --
R:  Yeah, I'm coming -- I'm twenty eight.
L:  Oh.  This is really nice doing this.
R:  Yeah, it's interesting.
L:  Sometimes when I do emails, I, you know, ans- answer back or I like to do the cooking things and the cooking letters and -- and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, when I do, I write Sandra in California and a couple of times I've got someone back -- uh, wrote back and said, "My daughter's there.  What part of California are you?" so we start writing like that and it's kinda neat, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um, you don't think you'll be going back?
R:  No, I won't.  Because once you leave you lose your seniority and you'd have to start all over --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so I'd have to go through training again which is two months and be away from my family and then, you know, lose -- have no seniority to start.
L:  So, are you in a small town or do you, uh, you know --
R:  Actually I live right outside of Cleveland, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm, like, maybe ten minutes outside of Cleveland.
L:  I was born in Michigan, Detroit.
R:  Oh, were you?  Okay.  My, um, father in law, his parents lives in -- live in Michigan.
L:  I heard of people coming over there to, is it, Toledo or somewhere where they used to gamble?
R:  Um ...
L:  I don't remember.
R:  Toledo --
L:  Well --
R:  -- not Toledo.  Um, I'm not sure.  I know if you go to Canada I think there's a big place.
L:  Uh-huh.  So, okay, let's get back to the subject [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  So, is there anywhere around you that would be like a big mall or anything like that that you would --
R:  Yeah, well, we have, um, a -- like South Park Center is probably our largest, nicest mall.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But it doesn't -- you know, I really don't think about it.  It doesn't really -- I --
L:  Well --
R:  I guess I just figure it's just gonna -- meant to happen to me --
L:  Right.
R:  -- no matter what I change or do, it's in my fate, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.  Well, my daughter's thirty two --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and the kids are eight and ten so lots of times I stay home and then you hear -- you hear warnings kinda like, "Oh, something's buzzing that maybe something will happen at Disneyland or something".
R:  Yeah --
L:  And so they --
R:  -- well, you have a huge theme park there.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Because they like to go to places like that and the, um -- oh, what is it?  Five flags or six flags.
R:  Six flags.  Uh-huh, we have one --
L:  -- and Knots Berry Farm --
R:  -- of those too.
L:  -- so any time they go to those places, I'm really kinda --
R:  Yeah ...
L:  And now this weekend, she's talking about, um, my two daughters and the two kids going to Las Vegas and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just to look around and they have the kids, you know, so they're not going to gamble but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- there's supposed to be a lot of things families can do and --
R:  You know what, I used to have layovers there.  It is.  It's a lot of fun.
L:  Oh.  Uh-huh.  Well, I'm telling the kids, "Boy, there's gonna be crowds.  You better ..."  The little ten year old boy he just drifts off and he goes and sees whatever he wants, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I said, "Somebody can get you in a minute".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I said, "They -- you know, they have people that block views" and you know, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just stand in front of somebody and --
R:  Yeah.  And you know I'm more worried about that than anything because there was a, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- something around here that somebody, a neighbor or something, had gone into someone's house while the parents were sleeping, broken in and stole their child.
L:  Oh, that -- yeah, that's happened here.
R:  I'm like more afraid of that [MN] than someone --
L:  Yeah.  Well, lock your doors and --
R:  -- attacking.
L:  Huh.  Yeah, you don't want to, you know, leave her out of your sights.  Oh, I love girls.  I have two girls.  Well, that's after I had one.  That's all I wanted was more -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- girls. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Other than that, you know, I mean I've seen a lot of people on TV, you know, on Oprah and all them how --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they've really, you know, said how this has really affected their lives and they've -- they --
R:  yeah.
L:  -- second thoughts but I don't have a hus-
R:  I think it's -- it's affected a lot of, um, people's jobs --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know.  A lot of -- like just for an example, the Rock Hall of Fame.  My friends lost jobs there because the, uh -- they were getting funding -- actually funding from Continental and Continental cut back all their funding after September eleventh because they were losing money.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so then that, in turn, that was their biggest funder for the Rock Hall.  So that, in turn, meant that, um, they were, you know --
L:  When you say Rock Hall, what do you mean?
R:  We have the Rock Hall of Fame in Cleveland.
L:  Rocks or rock and roll or what? [LAUGH]
R:  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Rock and roll.  I understand that.
R:  Yeah, sorry.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, we have the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame here and so because they lost so much funding because September eleventh affected the airlines --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and that was who -- that's who funded them, then my friends have lost their jobs.  So, they were out of work for, like, six months.  She finally found a job, um, with the Red Cross because she didn't like non profit organisation kind of thing --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and the Rock Hall is non profit but yeah.
L:  Oh, see you're interesting.  You know a lot.  They'll get a lot of information out of you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I'm -- I'll just stay at home and, you know, help with the kids and take 'em to school and back and forth but you are involved in how this has affected other people.
R:  Yeah.  Well, you know, now I'd pretty much -- I work part-time.  Uh, my mum owns a -- she owns Ohio Dance Theater which is our regional dance company.
L:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
R:  So, now I just work part-time for her and I just stay home, you know, with --
L:  Well, that's gotta be fun.  She puts on shows and things.
R:  Uh-huh.  They do like the Nutcracker, they do Cinderella.
L:  Oh.
R:  They're doing --
L:  Well, sell me some tickets.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'll never get to Ohio.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  So, um, yeah, pretty much -- I mean, it's aff- I guess it's affecting me because I went from full time to now I'm pretty much a stay at home mum.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  But --
L:  Do you -- do you plan on --
R:  -- I like it though.  I'm glad.
L:  Do you plan on like -- would you like to have another baby that you're home?
R:  You know what, I would but not for maybe another year.
L:  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, my girls are four years apart.
R:  Yeah, I think that would be --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- enough because it's pretty rough [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's pretty rough when they're first born.
L:  Is your husband able to be home all the time with you, or does he --
R:  No, no. 
L:  -- have a job away?
R:  You know, he's not -- he's the restaurant management business.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  So, he's actually works crazy hours.
L:  Well, you have it good.  Mum and the dance studio for shows --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and your husband in the food --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- depart- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah [LAUGH]
L:  That's pretty good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, where did you see about this survey at?
R:  Um, it's called "big, big forums".  It's like, um, a forum, big, big savings dot com.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And it's -- they -- people go on and find all kinds of [NOISE] like post all kinds of deal they find and coupons.
L:  Maybe -- I think I've seen -- I'm trying to write that down.  Did they just have something on it -- oh, no that was for California only that you could get a little free George Forman and all those things.
R:  Yeah, I saw that.  I thought, "Darn, I wished I lived in California".
L:  Oh, yeah.  It was, uh, like a -- a couple of little cameras and things you could use on the computer and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I did --
R:  I find all kinds of good deals there.
L:  Big, big forum right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, and it was posted there.  I was like, "Oh, you know, I'm at home.  Why not?"
L:  Oh, yeah.  I -- I don't know how I find it.  Just on one of the newsletters I get.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I --
R:  It's interesting.
L:  How's your weather?  I guess they're not gonna butt in.
