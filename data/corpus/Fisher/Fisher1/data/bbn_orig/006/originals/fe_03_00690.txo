L:  Hello, I'm Cherie Foster.
R:  Hello, oh yes, my name is Vincent Brown.  Hi
L:  Hi, Vincent.
R:  How you doing?  How you doing?  Okay, um well we're supposed to talk about the airport security.
L:  Yeah, yeah, oh, I guess and do we think that it, uh, heightens the, uh, security in the air or ...
R:  [MN]  Well, I think it's good.  You can't say it's bad, but then again it has its negative too.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, I guess if you the -- if you're the passenger having to wait in line ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yes, yes.  Ah, it, um, you know, um ... I know what you mean.  It's just -- it's -- it's making our way of life a little difficult but, ah --
L:  Well, I'm a little biased I guess because I work at an airport.
R:  Ah ha.
L:  And although I don't have anything to do with the security end of it, I work in administration, um, I can see the real pluses for it in the particular airport I work at seems to have done a pretty good job of, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- changing things.
R:  Oh, so you say you are, okay what do you mean by you're biased?  You see -- you see mostly plus?
L:  Yes, oh yeah absolutely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's hard not to be a little biased because I work for the airport but, ah, but the way that we handled things at the airport, we seemed to have gotten lines down -- gotten lines pretty short and get people through, uh, pretty well.
R:  Yeah, right.  No, I -- I -- see -- although don't get me wrong, after nine eleven there's no doubt about it, that we need security, okay?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and as I said I'm also proud of my [inaudible].  In other words if you said to me take it away, go back to your way, I say no.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, now have you had to fly since then?  I -- I've not flown so I have not had any personal experience.
R:  [LAUGH]  I have not flown but I have taken him to the airport.
L:  Yes.
R:  And, taking someone to the airport, and waiting sometimes just as ... [LAUGH] easy, [LIPSMACK] it gives you a certain sense of, um, you get the feeling about what they have to go through, because you know you have to wait for them until they get on the -- you know -- they get on the plane so you see all the security and what they have to go through.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, I -- I -- like I said I've no problem with a negative, [LIPSMACK] but ah --
L:  Well our airport the -- the, uh, the meeters and greeters cannot go airside any more.  So, you can't actually meet passengers off of the airplane so that's kind of a negative in some ways --
R:  [MN]
L:  But uh --
R:  Oh, oh, oh you mean what you are saying is that, um, [inaudible] to get in the airport and to get in a plane you have to go through a [inaudible], you know just, like, you know when you used to meet them coming off the plane right there.
L:  Well, you have to go -- you can't go -- in fact you can't go through a checkpoint if you don't have a ticket.
R:  Right.
L:  So, yeah
R:  Exactly.  Exactly, right, right, right.  [several inaudible words] be a certain distance away and now they are talking about, uh, the amount of luggage that you can carry on; what kind you can carry on; you have to leave your bag open, um, I was reading something about leaving the bags open; access to, uh, security if they need to go through the bags.  And I couldn't figure out -- fully understand that, you know what I mean?
L:  Well, in -- in not having the personal experience myself, I -- but I do have a daughter that flew over the holidays and they were searched a couple of times but her husband, uh, is originally from another country, not a Middle East country or anything like that he's from --
R:  [MN]  Right, right.
L:  Yeah from Iceland.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But she felt like they kind of picked on him because he was from another country.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Even though he's a citizen, so ...
R:  Right, right.
L:  But -- but, I -- you know all in all I think that, um, I think that we've done a good job, I think that the airline industry as a rule has done a real good job as far as security goes, and I can't help but think it's got to have some impact.
R:  Yeah.  It does and also I think that okay, my view is too also, that the government may have to -- okay the cost, when I look at the cost factor too, okay --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause I'm you know, in economics, and figures in my head, and this is tremendous cost factor added to the airport uh, you know what I mean?
L:  Well, that's correct.  And I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- just watching the changes in our budget and stuff this year [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, I --
L:  I can see the difference it's making.
R:  Yeah, because I'm in New York and I'm, ah, as a matter of fact very close to ground zero, and I -- when I look at the airline I say gee that's such a tremendous cost to them.
L:  Mhm
R:  I don't know if whether they should be, um, subsidized by government because there is a certain amount of cost for security or because let's face it, um, you know you have a railroad too that's going to be a -- I don't know but it might be the next to be attacked, but anyhow, I'm saying that they -- all the -- these -- these security that is going to be in demand by the Federal government, right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, it's a tremendous, and I may be wrong, the airline industry worked out security too.  But, if they had to put all these costs on to your ticket [LAUGH] I guess it's gonna either hurt the budget in terms of making a negative profit or either just increase the price of tickets tremendously.
L:  Well, in the industry itself is hurting because of a lot of that anyway already.
R:  You don't have to tell me that, I know it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  People, ah, people are thinking twice about flying.  You know.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh absolutely, yeah.
R:  I mean, if I gotta go here to -- if I just go next door or something, I'd just take a train you know I [inaudible] train now.  But you're right, go ahead, go ahead, I certainly --
L:  Yeah, I'm in Dallas and I wish --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we had more public transportation.  Uh, you know I really do, I wish we had more public transportation here, but there are what I've been reading and what my experience has been too, there's more people renting cars, and driving if they don't have more than a few hours to go whereas they used to get on a plane.
R:  Yeah, ex-
L:  Now whether that has to do with security or cost or what -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's probably a combination.
R:  [LAUGH] It is a combination.  Like you say it is a combination of [several inaudible words] definitely thinking about have that, uh -- you know flying fear -- fear of flying now because of what's going to happen you know.  Um, so there is, like I said a combination of factor.  Uh, why people are considering not flying now, and but as you say there are still a lot of people not flying out as before, and I think that nine eleven of course had something to do with it, tremendously.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh.
L:  Well, my daughter said she felt safer in the air this year.  Yeah, and when she came in for Christmas she said she felt safe which that to me is good you know even if she complained a little bit about some of the stuff she had to go through.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  She did feel safe.
R:  She did feel safe, yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, that's good, that's good that she felt safe because, uh, you know, um, before the only fear we had of flying before was if something went mechanical or otherwise happened to the plane.  And now we have this factor of what you say and, uh, [LAUGH] basically about terrorism when you see certain people that you try to stereotype or you try to like they say, uh, profile them.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Because of the situation, you know, and I had some friends of mine from, um, and even right there in Texas, I was stationed in San Antonio, Texas when I was in the air force.
L:  Uh-hum
R:  And you have many Mexican American descendants and they could look very well like a mid- Middle Eastern
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, I have friends from Central America that look like Middle Eastern and, um, sometimes you know, like I said again, people look at them kinda funny.  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, a lot of people are in a lot of fear and I guess that's a tendency that people have you know and I can -- I really, I've really felt for anyone who looked of Middle Eastern descent --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, that had to deal with that 'cause that's a shame you know that to have to deal with that but [SIGH] you know, I mean our skies should be safer considering, you know, the wake up call that we got.
R:  Oh yes.
L:  And everything that's been changed.
R:  Oh yeah, oh yes, like I say I'm in favor, don't get me wrong in security too --
L:  Yeah.
R:   -- because I tell people you know like realistically no one thought you could just take a plane and use a plane as a bomb you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or use it as a missile, you know what I mean?
L:  Well, I just can't understand why nobody thought of that before.  You know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I -- I feel like airport security was so lax and I didn't -- you know I didn't know it.  Of course I didn't have anything to do with that end of it either but ...
R:  Well, you know, it's just like um you could not think about it 'cause it is just something that was beyond your thinking.  Okay during World War II we had what was called the Japanese, what they call it Kamikaze --
L:  Mhm
R:  -- [LAUGH] where ...
L:  Well, that's in essence what they did just like the Kamikazes, yeah.
R:  When you run out of bullets or whatever you just use a plane and you go straight into the, ah, ship, right?  You use the plane itself as your weapon and, uh, you know, we just didn't think of it today in those terms that the person in the plane is going to commit suicide, is going to use it to come and you know blow themselves up.  And, ah ...
L:  What's hard to fathom is that anybody would think that way?
R:  It is hard to, but you see [several inaudible words] when you have, I don't know, ah, I see certain things another way to it.  Um, I'm not gonna talk about [inaudible] in general but, you know, people; first of all if you were a humanitarian you'd say well why would someone want to do that?  That's a big question you should ask yourself.  So, we are all born blank whatever, from childhood, and why would someone, if you've been brainwashed, if you've been whatever, but [inaudible] the reason why.  I mean, ah, I'm not in favor of those people I think are negative about -- they doing things wrong.  But we also have to look for the cause too, and I think that's the biggest thing to look into, why are they doing these things and has something been done to them or something, what purpose?  It could be, it could not be just for greed or just for craziness itself to want to kill yourself.
L:  Right, right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's I'm in a sociology class right now and, uh -- 
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- we're talking about different things and how, you --
R:  Well, you must have a lot [inaudible] good.  Go ahead.
L:  [LAUGH] It's very interesting.  It's very interesting right now, and we haven't talked a lot about terrorism or anything like that --
R:  [MN]
L:  But, I'm getting a whole different point of view of a lot of things, by being in this class, and, and you know culture is interesting anyway, any culture, but you know we all -- we're all used to what we live in and anything that's out of the norm, um, [LAUGH] it's hard to accept, you know, because we've grown up with a certain thing,
R:  Well. Let me tell you a story.  We lived in, [inaudible]. In America we accept a lot more than many other countries in the world.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And many other cultures,
L:  Mhm.
R:  You follow what I mean?
