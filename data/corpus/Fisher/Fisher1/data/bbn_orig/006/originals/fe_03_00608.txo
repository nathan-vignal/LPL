L:  Hi, this is Lisa.
R:  Hello.  This is Betty.  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  This is Betty.
L:  Hi, Betty.
R:  Hi.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.  How are you?
R:  Okay.
L:  This is my first time on one of these calls and I wasn't quite sure what to do [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] It's my first time too, so I didn't --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- know either. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, where are you?
L:  Uh, in Pittsburgh.
R:  Oh.  I'm in North Carolina.
L:  North Carolina?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] What's the weather like down there?
R:  Cold.
L:  Cold.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Real cold here, too.
R:  Yeah, it's real cold.
L:  So, I guess we're supposed to be talking about holiday.
R:  Yeah, I guess so.
L:  What's your favorite holiday?
R:  Oh, I don't know if I've got a favorite holiday.  Do you?
L:  Yeah, I don't know if I do either.
R:  No.
L:  I would say Thanksgiving maybe.
R:  Yeah, that would be good.  Yeah, I like about all the holidays.
L:  I like the holidays where all the family and friends and that get together.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, me too.  Do you have a lot of family and friends?
L:  Oh, somewhat.  Yeah, I got, uh, two brothers and a sister and a couple of uncles and aunts and cousins and stuff like that and we get together quite often, especially on the holiday.  Nice to see everybody and get, you know, caught up on things.
R:  Yeah.  I usu- --
L:  How about you?
R:  I usually go to my sister's on Thanksgiving.  Usually at Christmas too but this year her husband was in hospital so we didn't go at Christmas.
L:  Is she okay now?
R:  Uh, well, he -- he had the lung cancer and he had surgery and he was -- was in ICU for, like, seven weeks and he's still in the hospital but he's doing better now.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  So, we had Thanksgiving but then Christmas we're just putting it on hold until he gets home.
L:  That's one thing.  You can always put things on hold and it doesn't really matter when you celebrate 'em.  It just matters when you're all together.
R:  Yeah, that's right [LAUGH].  Do you have another favorite holiday?
L:  I'm trying to -- to think.  Um, I used to really like Christmas but anymore I don't.  I think it's so commercialized that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, it kinda has taken away from the spirit that I remember when I was a kid.  But --
R:  Yeah, it's --
L:   -- I guess I -- I --
R:  -- just not as much as fun [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause, you know, I've got a little grandbaby though and it was fun for him.
L:  Oh, yeah, and when kids are involved that definitely makes a big difference.
R:  Yeah, that makes some difference [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, like when my niece was younger, I -- you know, I think it was a little bit more exciting but she's gotten a little bit older now and it's still exciting for her but it just -- it's a little bit different.
R:  Do you have children?
L:  No, I don't.  Actually, just have one niece out of all my, uh, brothers and sisters.  How about you?
R:  Uh, yeah.  I got a son that's twenty three and a daughter that's almost eighteen.  And then my son has a little -- a little fourteen month old little boy and then he's got a stepson.
L:  Yeah, I imagine that makes it nice at Christmas.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they -- they definitely like Christmas [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] What about the other holiday?
R:  I don't know.  Let's see.  Mostly Thanksgiving and Christmas is the best.  What's your next favorite?
L:  Oh, I don't know.  Maybe the Fourth of July.
R:  Yeah, that one's good, too.
L:  With the fireworks and some of the excitement and that just kind of -- the whole celebration aspect can be kinda fun.
R:  Yeah, I like fireworks.
L:  Do you get to see them often around the Fourth of July or any other time?
R:  Uh, most time we go see some.  Do you have lots of 'em where you are?
L:  They do a lot at, uh -- in the city of Pittsburgh and I can see a little bit out my window but not too much.  I usually watch 'em on TV and then I have the window open and I listen to 'em also [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Well, we -- we live out in the country so we have to go to town to see it [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.  Do you have a -- a farm or something or just live out in the country?
R:  Well, actually I live about half a mile from the city limits but it looks like we're further out. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really [LAUGH].
R:  But then the city limits is just a little bitty town so [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- uh, we don't have any in this little town.  We have to go to the next bigger town. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  How far are you from, um -- where did you say you're at, North Carolina?
R:  North Carolina.  I live maybe about fifty or sixty miles from Charlotte.
L:  From Charlotte.
R:  Yeah.  Have you --
L:  I've only been in there for layovers in Charlotte.  I've never really been -- well, actually, no, I was at Cape Hatters.
R:  Yeah, that's out on the coast.
L:  Yeah, that was, uh, back in the eighties.  I was down there on vacation once.  That's the only time I've really been down into North Carolina.
R:  Uh-huh.  I've never been to Pennsylvania.
L:  Are you from North Carolina originally?
R:  Yep.
L:  Yep.
R:  Yep [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I'm from [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] I'm --
L:  -- I'm from Pennsylvania originally also.
R:  Uh-huh.  Have you always lived there?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've always lived here too.  Within a few miles of here anyway [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  I've got a nephew that his ex wife lives in Pennsylvania somewhere.  I don't know where at.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  How cold did it get up there?
L:  I don't know really know.  I didn't watch the numbers.  I just know that it's been, uh, pretty cold [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know my car didn't want to start too good the one morning and that's unusual so I know it had to have been pretty cold on that.
R:  Uh-huh.  It got down they said about eight degrees here and it was cold and windy.  I don't know.  I hope it don't get that cold again.
L:  Yeah, I'm hoping that it warms up.  Makes it dangerous for the animals and stuff that have to be outside and all that.  I don't like to see all that going on when it's so cold.
R:  Mhm.  Well, I guess you're used to the cold weather.  
L:  Yeah, somewhat.  I don't like it but I guess I tolerate it.
R:  Yeah.  Well, we don't usually get it this cold very often.
L:  Yeah, that seems awfully cold for where you're at.  Definitely.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  If --
L:  Is that all we were supposed to do, was to talk about the holidays and stuff for --
R:  Yeah, and they said something about talking about, uh, if you could make another holiday or something.
L:  If you wanted to create one --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what would you create?  So, how about you?
R:  Oh, I don't know.  Just, uh, a fun day, I guess.  [NOISE] I don't know what you would call it [NOISE] but just a day to go and really do anything you wanna do.  I think we have to talk until the recording comes on to tell us we've talked long enough.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I would create, I guess, a holiday that would be kinda like a fun filled holiday, I guess and a bunch of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- family and friends just doing something.
R:  Yeah, I think a holi- I know a holiday from bills.  That would be good.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  No bills.  That would be a real good holiday.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No bills and no calls. [NOISE] Oh, my baby's -- [LAUGH] she's mad.
L:  Yeah, sounds like it.
R:  Yeah, I had a pair of scissors laying here [NOISE] and they're with Scotty and he grabbed them and I took 'em.
L:  Oh, well that'll do [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that will.  Now, that's my baby.
L:  So, you're babysitting.
R:  Yeah, I've had him -- [NOISE] well, his older brother got sick and they didn't want him to get sick and I usually get him like every other weekend anywhere from Wednesday till Sunday [NOISE] and then he went home one night and then the next day the little boy was sick and he went home with his other grandparents and I got him the next day and I've had him ever since.  But I guess he'll go home tomorrow. [NOISE] So, I've had him about, I don't know, I guess about two and a half weeks [NOISE].
L:  Wow.
R:  But he's just like -- just like he belongs here 'cause he's here a lot [NOISE].
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE].
L:  So, are you into the Superbowl at all?
R:  The -- who me?
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, no, I'm not into Superbowl or football.
L:  Well, I watch it to watch the advertising [LAUGH].
R:  You watch the Superbowl to watch the advertising? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, because they have some pretty funny ads and stuff.  I mean, they pay millions of dollars to be, you know, able to advertise during that time period and they put some pretty funny commercials together so I tend to watch it to watch the commercials --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I guess I'm a little bit weird.
R:  Well, I probably won't even turn it o- the television on because that'll be on and I don't watch football.
L:  I normally don't either but the Feelers were in the play off and I watched the ...
