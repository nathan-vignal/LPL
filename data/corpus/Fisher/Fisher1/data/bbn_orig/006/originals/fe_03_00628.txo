L:  Uh, hello.  My name's Ann Marl.
R:  Hi.  How are you?
L:  Fine.  How are you?
R:  Fine.
L:  Have you done this before?
R:  No, this is my first time.  Yourself?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Good.
L:  I wonder how long you talk or they just cut you off or what?
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know but something about life partners.  What's the most thing -- important thing about a life partner?
L:  What do you think?
R:  Uh, that you can trust the person and you have a lot in common.  Um, but you know what I usually find that opposites attract.  What about you?
L:  Yeah.  My husband and I are opposites.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Very, very opposites.  We don't the same food --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we don't like the same movies, we don't like the same activities --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- at all.  Nothing.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We have nothing in common at all --
R:  I just --
L:  -- and we've been married, like twenty three years.
R:  Oh, bless your heart.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's wonderful.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's wonderful.  I just, uh, read something about, um, Loretta Lynn.  It was in our Sunday magazine pull out section.  She was with that man about forty seven years.  Her life partner --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and her husband and he passed away, I think, in nineteen ninety six and she was able to weather, like, the ups and downs of their relationship and, you know, when he passed away, she was devastated 'cause he was hers since she was a young girl.
L:  I think she married him at fourteen.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  He -- he was, I think, six or seven years older than her.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I read the book about her life and --
R:  Did you?
L:  -- all and I think -- I think she was fourteen --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  -- because she had her first set of twins at sixteen.
R:  Oh.
L:  Well, she had her first baby, I think, at fifteen --
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  -- and then a set of twins.
R:  Unbelievable.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Unbelievable.  So, her life partner, I guess, you know, was good for her in a way.  She said she had troubles.  The marriage wasn't that, you know, solid in the beginning because I guess he went around cheating and whatnot but [NOISE] she said when there's children involved, you just do what you have to do and stay together.
L:  Yeah.  My husband had a drinking problem.
R:  Oh, so did her husband.
L:  Yeah.  Mine had one and there was times I wanted to leave --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and my -- the -- the -- my first husband died --
R:  Oh, Ann.
L:  -- and this was his, uh -- this was his -- his fifth marriage and I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- was number -- number five.
R:  God.
L:  And he had two kids and I had two kids --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and the kids hit it off perfect.  He had two girls, I had two boys.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  And, I mean, they're still close now, just like brother and sister.
R:  Oh my gosh.
L:  They claim each other like that.
R:  Wow.
L:  But, uh, my kids would beg me not to leave him --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- because, you know, they wanted a father --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and he was good to 'em --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and so I just sort of bit the bullet until finally just, uh, after about ten years, I said, "This is it --"
R:  Oh.
L:  "-- you know.  Either you quit or I go"
R:  Oh.
L:  And, uh, he pulled one more and I said, "That's it".
R:  [MN]
L:  You know, and I started packing his stuff --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and he said, "I won't do it again" and he's been -- he hadn't drank anything for twelve years.
R:  Thank God.
L:  Are you married?
R:  Yes, ma'am.
L:  Yeah.  How long you been married?
R:  Since nineteen eight -- no, nineteen eighty eight, yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yep.  Um, it's hard to find that perfect person.  I think that's what people are fooled by, you know, when they're looking for their life partner.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You always think the grass is greener and whatnot, but I don't know about that especially today.  It is hard finding decent people out there.
L:  Yeah.  My son's thirty three --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he's been married once --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and had -- was engaged a couple of times --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they go off hunting somebody else on the side and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, so he's like a bona fide bachelor now and --
R:  Oh, man.
L:  -- you know, I told him.  I said, "One day, you'll find the right person" and he says, "I don't know.  Every -- everybody I find is either out for money --
R:  Yes, ma'am.
L:  -- you know, they don't want to work -- 
R:  Mhm.  True.
L:  -- they want you to keep 'em up --
R:  Yes.
L:  "-- or they've got about three or four excess baggage".
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  You know, and he said, "I don't want any more children".  He's got one that --
R:  I was just gonna ask you that.
L:  Yeah, he's got a fourteen year old [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, wow.  How old is your son?  Thirty three?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  Well, he's thirty -- matter of fact, he's thirty four Friday.
R:  Oh.
L:  And then I've got another son.  He's thirty six --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he's got two kids but his are younger.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Hm.  He said he wished he'd had kids in his twenties.
R:  No kidding.
L:  Yeah.
R:  See, I was thirty -- what am I now?  I'm thirty nine.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Thirty eight, thirty seven, six, five.  I had my kid when he was thirty -- when I was thirty four so I -- we waited.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Sometimes it just doesn't happen right off the bat, you know.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  I live in New York.  How about yourself?
L:  Oh, North Carolina.
R:  Oh.  I love your accent.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, what do you think?  Do you think there's better life partners down there than there is up here?
L:  I don't know.  They s- I'm, uh, kinda overweight and they say that, uh, New Yorkers, the men like bigger women so --
R:  You think so?
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  I don't know.  My husband doesn't [LAUGH].
L:  He doesn't?
R:  Nope.
L:  But, you know, I've -- I've seen where they say, you know -- I've watched some talk shows one time --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and they would be some handsome --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- good looking men --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- and these big, big women --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I think, "Where do you they find these guys" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and they were all from New York, New Jersey.
R:  Oh, my God.  Well, the fella that I work with he has a thing for them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I said, "Wow, really".  I said, "You don't like the skinny little itty bitty ones?"  "No" he said, "No, I like the bigger ones.  I -- I just like that".  I said, "Okay".  I said, "When did that start?"  So, I don't know.  I guess when he was a young guy dating.
L:  Yeah.  My son, he wants little bitty --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- not over a hundred and forty -- a hundred and thirty pounds.
R:  [LAUGH] Is he tall?
L:  And --
R:  Is he a big guy?
L:  He's six two.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  But he's overweight --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about thirty pounds.
R:  Uh, well you can pull that off when you're tall.
L:  Yeah --
R:  You know?
L:  -- well, you can do weights and all.  It's easier for a guy.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Absolutely.  I was excited about this study to tell you the truth, Ann.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  How about yourself?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I was, like, "Oh, I was looking forward to it".
L:  Well, see I kept getting calls all week and it takes a while --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for the thing to connect --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I'd hang up on 'em because --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- I'd think --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, I wouldn't hear anything and I'd just hang up, and they'd call back about thirty, forty minutes later and I'd hang up again.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And finally today I sit here and held the phone and I thought, "I'm gonna wait a minute".
R:  Good.  
L:  You know --
R:  I'm so glad.
L:  -- well, the la- the first time after five -- they called again around five --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and I hit star sixty nine and dialed the number back and it said, "Fisher study" --
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  -- and I said, "Oh, my God, that's what that is".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So ...
R:  It's so funny because when it first started down this end, I didn't have my PIN number.
L:  Well, I had to go look mine up on the computer --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and then at five o'clock and by the time I did, they hung up on me.
R:  Oh, no.  I was so -- I was so upset about that, you know [NOISE] but we're supposed to be talking about this life partner thing. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  What else can we say?  I mean, um --
L:  Well, it's like my husband, uh -- see, you know, you have to take the good with the bad.
R:  That's hard.
L:  Y- listen --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I tell you what.  My husband's eighteen years older than I am.
R:  Okay.
L:  I'm fifty five, he's seventy three.
R:  Oh, my God.  Really?
L:  And, you know, he was just, uh -- he's been an excellent provider --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and then he had a stroke --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- about three years ago --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and he's got end stage emphysema because he worked a lot in asbestos and then --
R:  My God.
L:  -- you know, stuff like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, now I'm at the point I'm having to take care of him --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- you know, where I thought, "Well hey, here's somebody who can take care of me --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- a little bit" --
R:  Yes, yes, yes.
L:  -- but I'm having to do everything.  I have to, uh --
R:  Oh, God.
L:  -- bathe him, I have to --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, do the whole -- cut up his food --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, everything and it's like, you know, sometimes I feel --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like I got cheated and then I don't because I love him to death.
R:  Oh.  Now, that is true love.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  That is something that you wish someone would do for you, you know what I mean?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  God forbid you ever need it, but I'm sure he's thanking God for that day that he -- he married you because another woman or another person in the -- in the --
L:  Would have walked off.
R:  That's right.  Put them in a home.
L:  Oh, he gets -- he gets me frustrated sometimes.
R:  Oh, of course.
L:  But, now, you know he's stubborn.
R:  Well, you know --
L:  But it's not one of them -- I'm lucky that he's not one of these that get real ill and mean --
R:  Yes --
L:  -- when they get older.
R:  -- grouchy, grouchy too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  Well, he's not grouchy.  He's --
R:  Oh, thank God.
L:  -- just a -- he's just a baby.
R:  Thank God, thank God.
L:  He's just a baby doll.  Everybody loves him.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh.
L:  Everybody who meets him falls in love with him.
R:  You know what it is?  I -- I -- I think that also people want in another person what they don't have themselves.  Like me I like to be thrifty, you know, I like a bargain, this and that.  My husband, he won't care.  He'll -- he'll go to a store and spend like ten dollars on, uh, something that would normally cost like two dollars and -- and I guess --
L:  I'm like that.
R:  -- you know, yeah, we -- I sometimes get mad at that but then if you're too much alike, I don't know if that will work out.  I -- I -- I don't know.
L:  I don't know.  I've never had one -- well, my first -- well, my first husband and I were that.  We were pretty compatible --
R:  Really?
L:  -- but yeah, but he wanted to run round on me all the time --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I stuck it out till he dropped dead.
R:  Oh, my God.  That hurts.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Hurts you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Sure it is.
L:  I stayed with him, you know --
R:  Why sure.
L:  -- but the last -- well, the last words we had was, "I wished you'd drop dead so me and the kids could draw your social security check" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and this was on Friday and Monday morning he dropped dead.
R:  Are you serious?
L:  Yeah, and my husband now told me, "Don't you ever tell me to do that".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, it was -- it was so weird because I mean, you know, I said, "The best thing you can do is just drop dead" and he did.
R:  [MN] Oh, my God.  How did he die?
L:  Had a heart attack.
R:  Oh.  Oh, man.
L:  It's like, you know, that's scary.  
R:  You know what?
L:  When you tell somebody --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they do it for you [LAUGH].
R:  So wh- you know, what I always say?  I always say, "What goes around comes around".  That's with your life partner, with your friends, with anybody.  That's what I believe in.  I -- I feel if you do something to someone that isn't, you know, honest or good or true, in the long run you're gonna get it. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You're gonna -- it's gonna come back to you somehow.
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- my son's learning that now.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  He's learning all these lessons that --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I've been trying to teach him for thirty four years.
R:  Oh, man.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's hard.  It's hard being a mom.  It's hard being a -- being that partner to somebody, you know.  It's -- it's hard all around, especially also --
L:  Yeah, it's a lot of work.
R:  -- if you work.  I was just gonna say that.
L:  That's what I try and tell my son, you know.  A marriage is fifty fifty but you -- sometimes you get seventy five.
R:  Yes, absolutely.
L:  Women have to give in a lot more --
R:  Mhm.  I know what you're saying.
L:  -- than men.
R:  I know what you're saying [MN] because my husband one day he's like, "Oh, you're taking care of our son.  Oh, why don't you go out and get a real job?  Why don't you do some work?"  I'm like, "What?  Why don't you stay home and you take care of our child and you see what kind of work it is" because he thinks I'm up over here eating my bon bons and watching TV all day and that's just not how it is.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  Hello.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Anne?
L:  Yeah.  I'm still here.
