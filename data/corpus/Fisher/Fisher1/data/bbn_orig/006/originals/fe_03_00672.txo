R:  Hi, this is Mary.
L:  Hi, I'm Kathy.
R:  Hi Kathy.
L:  Hi.
R:  Do you think it has made a difference?
L:  I don't know.  I, uh ... I've only -- have you flown since September eleventh at all?
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  'Cause, I've -- I've flown twice.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And both was to Canada, so it was international.  But, it doesn't seem like they're doing a whole lot more.
R:  That's what my mom said.  She flew down to, um ... Texas, and she said that she didn't even really notice anything different.
L:  Well, I have to sa- oh my God, I'm sorry I'm -- I just opened this thing out of the fridge and it was full of rotten vegetables, I'm sorry.
R:  Oh goodness.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  It sounds like my refrigerator. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, yeah, you know everybody's got dirty little secrets in their fridge.  I know I do.  Um, but uh, I don't think that's the topic we're supposed to be talking about.
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  It just threw me off when I saw that.  Um, you know that's the nice thing about having a cell phone or cordless phone, is you can go all over the place.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, anyway ... I don't know, I mean, I was going to say about the last time I flew, is some weeks ago and I had a clip in my hair, you know like a big metal barrette?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I got stopped and I got wanded, and you know the guy make me take the barrette off and he wanded me again and everything and I thought, but that happened before nine eleven too.  You know, because whenever I wore something big like that in my hair they would always ... stop and make me take it off if I forgot to take it off.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and put it in the tray.  So I mean, you know that stuff has been going on.  But you know nobody's checked my shoes, nobody's really checked too much of anything.  And you know they tell you don't bring, uh, flammable stuff on; and I realized they went through the whole of the trip last time with a little spray can of stain remover in my pocket which I forgot was there.
R:  Which you could have, yeah you could have --
L:  Which could explode.
R:  It could have been used for a weapon.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  You know, and of course if I'd known it was there I would have taken it out because I took out my Swiss army knife.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, but nobody searched my bag.  So, [several inaudible words].
R:  So, is it -- so, I don't really think it's helping.
L:  I think if ...
R:  I think they're profiling people.
L:  Yeah, I think they're doing that.
R:  Which doesn't help.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, anybody could be a terrorist.
L:  Yeah, I absolutely agree with you, and I think terrorists are not stupid.  You know, they may not be nice people but they're also smart, a lot of them and, you know, what if they got some old grandmother.  You know, I mean even if she was a Pakistani grandmother.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, to -- to become a suicide bomber.  It's you know, it's, uh -- chances are good that she wouldn't get stopped.  Although on the other hand they did, uh -- or my mother went through the airport in a wheelchair they searched her pretty good one time so --
R:  Really?
L:  -- who's to say?  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]  Well, I'm flying again on February twenty eighth, so I'll see.  But frankly, I don't think -- from what I've seen and what I've heard from people and from yourself, I don't think that -- I don't think they can really do anything about it.  I think if people want to get it on there, they can get it on.
L:  Right, you know it was funny because I was just talking to somebody about this, um, just before I came home tonight, and he said, "You know there's really --" this guy's an old retired guy, somebody I know; and he said he was working in the airline industry pretty much all his life, and he said the same thing you know, "If they want to get it on even now they will".
R:  Uh hum.
L:  But the thing is, what he said and I kind of agree with him, is where they'll stop it will be before they ever get near the plane.  You know that if the FBI or whatever is trying to locate these people who have these intentions, and stop them before it gets to the point where you know you have to search them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, well, I think ... see I don't know; I'm kinda -- I'm one of those people that's a little paranoid and thinks that the government has access to everything we do.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And then -- but then on the other hand that's kind of unreasonable to really think that they're that bright.  I mean they're just people --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and I, you know that like I said there's part of me that thinks they have access, so when these people are checking out books on how to make bombs and stuff, I know, if they check them out of a library or they buy 'em from a bookstore ... certain things red light, there, you know what I mean, like buying books on bombs and stuff?  But I don't really know how accurate that is.
L:  Well, I -- yeah.
R:  You know what I mean?  I don't really know what kind of a handle they have on this.
L:  Well, I -- I think that some of it is you know old fashioned, just leg work --
R:  Mhm.
L:   --you know, like old fashioned police work.  I don't think that, you know, and I am a librarian and I really don't like the idea of them being able to you know -- because what if I check out a book on making bombs just so I can find out what to look for --
R:  Mhm
L:  -- the next time I'm on a plane?  You know, does that make me a terrorist?  I'm not a terrorist.
R:  No.
L:  You know, but the thing of it is ... you know on the other hand if you have informants, you know, or have your sources and you're an FBI agent, and you know your one source comes to you and says, "Hey, you know that guy Mohammed has just moved down the street from me and he's, you know -- he's into all this stuff and he's going to this mosque.  And he's you know yelled at my wife the other day and said you know she should be in the house, and you know America's such a horrible place and everything", well, you know, maybe that guy bears a little bit more checking out.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, or maybe the guy down the street who's saying the same thing only his name is John Smith and who -- he's -- he has some kind of white survivalist guy.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, 'cause they're equally both terrorists.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and I think that's the way a lot of these things get solved, is through police work rather than through uh ... [SIGH] searching and ...
R:  And all the high tech surveillance and all that.
L:  Yeah, and you know randomly going after people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I think that ... yeah that's not to say that stuff doesn't have a place 'cause as much as I hate it and I fear it I think it probably does have a place.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  You know.
R:  I mean, I'm afraid of it and I wish that it didn't have to be there, but I think a lot of it -- you know I don't like them watching us.  I grew up in fear.  Once I saw nineteen eighty four ...
L:  Mhm
R:  -- I grew up in fear of that and now it's here and it's, like, okay but it's kinda necessary some of it you know.  I mean, I got used to having cameras at the workplace.
L:  Yes.
R:  And they were all over and my thing was, well, I'm not doing anything wrong so who cares, and I got to where I ignored them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But at the same time, I don't really like them being there.
L:  I don't like the presumption that you're guilty until proven innocent.  You know and that's what it says to me, cameras in the workplace.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know what -- what they were there for.
R:  Well, it was in a grocery store.
L:  So, it was partly there for your protection, it was partly there to prevent theft.
R:  Oh, yeah definitely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we still had people that -- we had one girl -- I mean the cameras were trained right on the check stands, and she was pocketing twenty dollar bills.
L:  [MN]
R:  You know they're there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I mean how stupid are you?
L:  Well, I absolutely -- someone I know once said crime makes you stupid.
R:  Said what?
L:  Crime makes you stupid.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I mean it's a true.  You know, if you're smart you can find other ways to get ahead besides being a criminal.
R:  That's right.
L:  But, um ...
R:  I've known a lot of bright criminals and it's just, like, you know -- if you just knocked your crap off and put as much effort into something legitimate, you'd have money instead of being in jail.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's true, that's true.  I mean, there-- and as I said, the bright ones are the ones that don't usually get caught but then there's also, like a subset of people that are just lazy.
R:  That s true.
L:  You know, [inaudible].  That's the thing.  It's a quick fix solution and you know to get it back to the suicide bombers, that's what they're trying to go for.  You know if you think about it, it's like, "Well, we're not wanting to sit down and dialogue with you people because you know we hate you and we think you're the infidels and you know you should all die right now".
R:  Mhm.
L:  "So, we're going to kill you and you know we'll blow up with you because ... we're seventeen years old and we just don't care".
R:  Exac- well they have nothing to care about because they haven't been taught any different.
L:  Right and they don't have you know any jobs or any prospects of the future, or any kind of, you know, reason to think that things can be solved peacefully.  They don't have an example set for them, ever.
R:  And it's -- and they -- they're taught to believe it's all our fault.
L:  Yes, of course they are.
R:  Its' not their government, it's not that they're all being held bound, that the women aren't being given any education, that they don't want to come into the twenty first century, twenty second century whatever it is.  [LAUGH]
L:  Its twenty first century I think.
R:  It is the twenty first, okay.  They don't want to come in.
L:  Yes I think twenty first century is us and twenty second century start from.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean they don't, they don't want to come in to the new century; they don't want to look at anything; they want to stay stuck in a bunch of old values that just ... don't apply any more --
L:  Well you know --
R:  -- and -- and they don't work.  If they worked, they would have something.
L:  But the thing is it's like any other ... I hate to use the word patriarchal system because it's not exactly what I mean, but any other [SIGH] kind of system where you get people --
