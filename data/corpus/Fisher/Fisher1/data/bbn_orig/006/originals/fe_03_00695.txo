R:  Jennifer.
L:  Hello.  Uh, this is Tom.
R:  Hi, Tom.
L:  How you doing?
R:  I am -- I am fine.
L:  Okay, [LAUGH] good.  There's this talk about national security.
R:  Okay, have you taken one of these surveys before?
L:  No.
R:  Okay, neither have I.  So ...
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, my assumption is that, um, -- heighten airport -- I don't see -- I don't feel that, uh, heightened airport security is going to, um, diminish terrorist attacks.
L:  Okay.
R:  I think it will -- I mean, my opinion is that it might be a little harder for them to, um, I don't know, get through the process of trying --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of getting through airports, but I don't think it will diminish their efforts.
L:  Yeah.  Uh, have you -- have you flown a lot since September eleventh?
R:  Yeah, I have.
L:  Yeah, me too.  It's like, uh --
R:  I -- I'm actually in LA and so I go through LAX.
L:  Yeah, I've been through there a little bit.
R:  Okay, and, um, I don't -- I mean, there is more security and they do -- do some random checks, um, some of the people that I fly with, they do look a little scruffy at times.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they will call -- call them out.  But I -- I mean, they're -- I guess their procedures in my opi- I mean, I think they're looking for the wrong people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I don't know how beneficial it is.
L:  Well, the thing is, like, I don't know what the pr- and -- 'cause they supposedly the people had, like, uh, box cutters right, when they hijacked the plane, which were okay to bring on airplanes, you know.  So, it's not like the security was faulty or anything.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, so even if they checked the guys out, it's -- well, you can have this on there.  So, I don't see what -- I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, now it seems like if someone tries to take over a plane that people --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- are just gonna freak out and not let in happen, you know.
R:  Yeah, I think, -- I think, if nothing else, that's the security measure that's been put in place, is that people aren't gonna sit around and take it anymore.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, even if -- even if it were a normal hijacker, even if it was some crazy loon --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, who's -- who's your typical white blonde blue eyed guy --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  No one is gonna put up with it.  They're just gonna say, "It's, like, you know what, I'd rather be the person that dies on this plane --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- to save everyone else".
L:  Yeah, yeah.  And I've been flying southwest around and it's always crowded, and, um, you can't -- I mean, whenever you get up to go to the bathroom or anything you can't wait in line, like, no congestion up here.  So, I don't know how it will work itself out.  And they have the, uh -- the pilot doors are shut the whole time, you know and they have this sign, "We are not opening the doors up", so I don't know.  It'd be -- it'd be something to see.  But, in the other -- the other problem with the airport security is that it's just, like, you know, some -- some dudes screening people, you know.  Like, if they're -- if they don't -- if they let one thing through one time when they're on the nod or whatever, it's -- that's the problem.  You know, we can have these great security measures, but there's always going to be people behind them and people are always, you know, uh -- have stayed up too late or be hungry or whatever and that's what's going to cause the problem, you know.  Not the measures, but the people putting it in place.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I really agree.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Because uh, I mean, I do have to -- I mean, I do say that the people that have been hired or -- or are still -- or still hold their positions are not -- I mean, I don't really think they care.
L:  Yeah.
R:  One way or the other, it's just -- they only care because they will get in trouble, um --
L:  Yeah.  Well, I don't know, it's even if people do care, you know, you can't be a hundred percent --
R:  Right.
L:  -- all the time, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, I guess I put it -- I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess that's -- that's too harsh of a statement to say that they don't care.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, it's more that, they're not paid to be, uh, you know a hundred percent vigilant.  They can't be --
L:  Right.
R:  No one can be.
L:  Right, exactly.  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Unless you're in Israel and you're in the military and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you're paid to do.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, [inaudible].  I hear there if, uh, they have any qualms about a flight --cancelled, like, they just cancel flights if they -- they have, you know, a bad feeling about it.
R:  Yeah, since September eleventh, I've seen several documentaries on, um, what they do in Israel.
L:  Yeah.  It's intense.
R:  It's, yeah
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was really, I mean after I saw that I was really scared, I mean I could understand what they're doing.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I just thought I would never want to go through their airport, ever.
L:  Right.  Don't you have to like -- you have like an hour long interview or something?  Everybody on the plane before they get on they have to, everyone has to talk to the security chief or something crazy like that.
R:  Yeah, and I think, if I'm not mistaken, it's like four to six checkpoints, like, four to six people can interview you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [several inaudible words], and I mean [several inaudible words] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and everything [inaudible].
L:  Well, on the other hand they haven't had any -- any problems --
R:  No they haven't.
L:  -- since they started doing all that.  But, you know, that's the -- that's the slippery slope question, right?  You know how much do you want to give up, et cetera?
R:  Well, and too I think of it, um, in terms of -- I mean, Israel is a fairly small country and they only -- I don't know how many -- I think they only have the one international airport there.
L:  That's true, yeah -- yeah.
R:  And, we're looking at a country that's you know fifty times bigger than they are.
L:  At least, yeah.
R:  We have, I think we have over a hundred international airports so it's -- oh no, we don't have that many.  'Cause most of the middle states don't have any [inaudible].
L:  But still, can you imagine, like, interviewing everyone at LAX at any given time?  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that place is like a beehive in there.  It's insane. --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'm sure that the ones on the east coast are the same story.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  The thing that freaks me out about, uh, airplanes and that, is I read this article about, like, shoulder mounted guided missiles that you can, you know, get on the black market for like a thousand bucks and that you know how are you going to stop that from happening?  Some guy driving up on a pickup truck and shooting a plane out of the sky as soon as it takes off.  Because you know the commercial jets don't have anything to prevent that like the military ones do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, when I fly that's what I'm worried about now and not so much someone on the plane but someone you know in the neighbourhood who is going to shoot it down.  But let's hope that doesn't happen.
R:  I hadn't thought about that, but --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, you're right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean there's -- I mean there's just a hundred different -- I mean, a hijacker now is -- there is so many different ways that they can, um, you do something to a plane or --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- your airport or anything else, like, -- I guess to a certain extent I'm wondering if, um, all the focus seemed on making sure that passengers and everything aren't terrorists --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- is, um, maybe deflecting some of the other ways that -- other things that we should be looking at.
L:  Yeah.  It seems like it, because, I don't understand some of the security things like, ah, -- like, um, the at the curb side check ins, how they suspended that for a while.  I didn't really understand why that would matter.
R:  I didn't either.
L:  It just doesn't -- I mean -- okay.
R:  They ask you the same questions and they do the same things as if you were walking up to the front.
L:  Yeah. I don't -- I didn't get it at all.  I don't see how -- I don't know.  It just seems like, if you're gonna make a bomb and you're willing to sort of kill yourself to get in on, you'll just drive to the airport and set if off before anyone can tell you to move your car, sort of, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  But, then why would you blow up an airport?  [several inaudible words], you know downtown, San Francisco or something and just blow that up or a bunch or people.  I don't know just scary to think about.  But I -- but I guess these stories of people being turned away with, you know, pocket knives and nail clippers and stuff, show that I guess that people aren't sort of doing their jobs.  But if -- I guess the point I made earlier is that they were doing their jobs before, you know, they -- you were allowed to have pocket knives and stuff.  That's sort of strange.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it seems like this -- this emphasis on more security isn't -- misses the point sort of.  It wasn't that people were asleep at the job; it's just that we weren't ready for what happened, and it seems like a str-.  Yeah, it's like you said, people have sort of a cosmetic response, you know making sure of doing something, instead of actually [MN] --
R:  I would agree.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So.  I guess -- do you think, -- do you know if they change the questions on us, or ...
L:  I [inaudible].  I got one the other night, I didn't feel like talking about, so I just -- I just said, "Not tonight".  Press nine, nine for deny.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, I thought we were actually gonna be able to pick what we were gonna talk about.
R:  Well, I had -- a friend of mine told me about this --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and she -- and I -- I thought it was a questionnaire.  I didn't realize that you were actually going to talk to someone else about --
L:  Yeah.  It's misleading, the thing.  I thought we were going to be talking to a robot or something. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] The way it said it and then I read more -- that I was, like, uh I'll just do it anyway, it'll be weird and fun.  Yeah, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  I had no idea either.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  This is so strange.
L:  Yeah, I wonder how many people are doing it.
R:  Yeah, I wonder too.  This is really weird.
L:  And I bet all the conversations get to this point where people talk about it, the project more than the topic.  That's what's more interesting you know than any of the topics.
R:  Yeah, because you can only talk about the topic so much --
L:  Yeah.
R:   -- without having, like, some kind of fuel added to it --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- to spark up.
L:  Right, [several inaudible words] like, well I disagree with everything.
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] you guys don't know what you're talking about.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's hard to --
R:  I feel more secure.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. Right, you know, I hadn't thought of that.  And I guess someone's gonna have to listen to all these too or something which is -- which can't be a fun job.
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
