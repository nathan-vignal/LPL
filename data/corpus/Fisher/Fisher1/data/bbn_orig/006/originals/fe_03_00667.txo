R:  Hello.
L:  Becky, hi.  Hi, my name is Becky.
R:  Hi Becky, I'm Toni.  Hi.
L:  Nice to meet ya. [LAUGH]
R:  You too.
L:  Well, I don't know about you, but I sure as heck hope that, uh, the heightened security kind of knocks these people out.  You know, I was really upset you know, when nine eleven happened.  I don't know what your feelings are on it, but ...
R:  Well I wa- I --
L: -- I just hope they can do something. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I have traveled quite a bit since then, and I have noticed the difference in the airports and I think it will deter some people from --
L:  Right
R:  -- from, you know getting things on board that they're not supposed to.  They even searched under my hat.
L:  Wow.  Wow, that's really surprising --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but -- but it's good in a way.  I mean, I'm glad that they're really, you know getting down to the nitty gritty so to speak.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I agree.  I think that, um, they need to do more.
L:  In terms of how?  I haven't traveled, so like honestly I don't even know. [LAUGH]
R:  [COUGH] Well they don't check all the bags you know.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  They only check some, and if you're picked by the computer, then they check your bag and you get searched.  But, they don't do it to everyone, and I truly believe that they need to search and they need to x-ray every single bag.
L: Yeah, I was just going to say that, and I don't like that they just let the computer do it.  I mean, anybody can get by.
R:  It is, it's random chance through the computer whether you get picked or not.
L:  I mean, I realize that, you know, it's going to be time consuming and stuff like that, but isn't it better to be safe than to be sorry more or less?
R:  I'd rather wait longer.
L:  Yeah, yeah I definitely would too.
R:  Yeah, I think that, um, that's going to help.
L:  Where do you normally fly out of?
R:  I fly out of Boston or Manchester, New Hampshire.
L:  Oh, okay, so then that was closer with the attacks.  Isn't that where one of the planes went out of, there were two of them?
R:  Out of Boston, yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I'm -- I'm, like, by Newark in New Jersey.  So, I think one of them went out of there also.  Yeah, I definitely agree with you, they really need to tighten it even more.
R:  Mhm, and I think people are just going to have to be patient and put up with it.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  'Cause we can't let that happen again.
L:  Exactly, that -- that puts such a toll on us -- I ... it's just incredible, I couldn't believe it [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah ... so this your first time doing one of these?
L:  Yes, it is.  I'm kinda at a loss to --
R:  It is mine too.
L:  --what to say.
R:  Yeah, it's mine too, I don't know exactly -- I guess we are just supposed to record what we're talking about.
L:  Right.
R:  But uh ...
L:  I think it's supposed to be about ten minutes or something to that effect.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN].  I know it was interesting, the first time I flew after nine eleven was in November.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- right after the September eleventh, and um ... and the security was very tight this way, and then I had flown to the mid west and it wasn't that tight in the mid west at all.
L:  Wow.
R:  And I found that interesting.
L:  Well, I guess they kinda figure it's a rural area, that, you know, why are people going to go out there?  But, they could come from anywhere --
R:  But, you can't think that way.
L:  Right, yeah exactly.
R:  'Cause they're gonna look for those holes.
L:  Yeah, now that they, uh, what to say, they concentrated on the major cities, but who knows, I mean they could turn around and start going for the smaller cities so to speak.
R:  Exactly.
L:  The less popular, not less populated, but, um, I'm trying to think of the word to say.  But, I guess it's like less frequented or something.
R:  Mhm.  Right, 'cause I was thinking of a very rural Kansas City airport, and the security guard was actually sleeping. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He was sleeping, I swear.  I looked at my mother and like yeah, we're in Missouri all right.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh yeah, I feel real safe. [LAUGH]
R:  You know?
L:  Wow, that's incredible.
R:  They have tightened it up a little bit since then, but I was kinda surprised how lax it was, especially right afterwards.
L:  Right, I mean, I know that really tightened it up um right after the attacks happened.  But, like you said it -- they just seem to be really letting up on it, so to speak you know they don't seem to be enforcing it as much as they were any more.  And now the whole situation with Iraq, I mean that is just another threat to us.  I mean, we don't know if he is going to do the same thing or something worse or whatever.
R:  And they need to be willing to invest some money in it too.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And I know money's a big issue, but that have to invest some money in it even if it comes from somewhere else.
L:  Yep, you may be absolutely right.
R:  'Cause in the long run, it's gonna save money, it's gonna save lives.
L:  Right.  That's the main issue.  You have to protect your own cou- uh, country, and at the same time you have to be willing to spend the money to do that.
R:  Mm. Yep.
L:  I don't know.  I'm wary about traveling, um, on an airplane right now.  I mean, there's a place I'd like to go and things I'd like to see but I'm really wary about doing that; just because of the fact that I don't think that the security is that great.
R:  Well, the first time I flew it really bothered me and I -- I was very anxious, but since then it doesn't ... um, I think, not because I feel safer, I think it's just because it's a fact of life now.
L:  Right.
R:  And, it's just like getting in a car, you just never know.  So it's kinda that way because the odds of it happening -- I mean, you just never know.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I just try not to let it bother me, and can't keep it from letting you live your life either.
L:  Well, yeah, exactly.
R:  And I mean, you can't -- you can't always look at someone just because of the color of their skin and say there's someone that are gonna do it either.  And a lot of people say, "Well, if I get on, somebody that looks you know, like they're Afghanist- they're from Afghanistan or from Iraq, I'm not getting on the plane".  Well that doesn't mean anything.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, they could -- they could look just like anybody.
L:  I look at people that are from those areas, and yeah, I don't treat them any differently and I never did from day one or from the day after the attack till after the attacks.  You -- you can't do it.
R:  No.  You can't judge everybody by the actions of a few people.
L:  Right. 
R:  [NOISE] Now, that's kinda sad.  I know a lot of people up here are persecuted.  They had nothing to do with it; nothing at all to do with it.  'Cause uh ... so, do they tell us when we're done talking?
L:  I think they're supposed to.  I'm --I'm not really sure.  I thought that the guy would  [LAUGH] come back on and say, "Okay, times up" but I'm not really sure 'cause this is my first one.  So, I just thought it was different, you know, something different to do and not necessarily meet other people, but just --
R:  [inaudible] online.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Somebody had given, uh ... somebody had given me a link to it so ...
R:  That's how I found it, yeah.  I do a lot of studies.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, it's wicked fun.  I get Campbells soup to study.  They're probably not wanting to record any of this [LAUGH].  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's a lot of fun.  I think it's fun and I make money.  I just -- it's just -- it's like found money.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know.
L:  Nice and easy [LAUGH] so I'll just take a little taste, and if I like it then fine, and if I don't then fine. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, so I'm just [inaudible] little while.
L:  Yeah, that's really the only reason why I'm doing it.  That's good.  I do a lot of, um, [LIPSMACK] like the research groups who whatever, may not -- like a whole bunch of them, 'cause there's so many out there you don't know which one is actually legitimate and which ones aren't so ...
R:  Right.
L:  I'm still searching around.  I'm still kinda new to it so ...
R:  Yeah, I don't know yet if this one's legitimate.  We'll find out I suppose.  I don't know anyone that's done it.
L:  How cold is it up by you? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, it is so cold, it is enough to die.  It --
L:  It's about ten degrees right now [LAUGH] over here.
R:  Yeah, we're about that, but the wind chill is like twenty below.
L:  Wow.
R:  It is so cold.  I've lived here for a long time, I've never seen it this cold, never.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah, this is like starting to get to me now. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I'm done.  I'm ready for summer.
L:  Yes.
R:  I have some friends who are flying to Puerto Rico next week, for a weekend at a resort and that's funny 'cause she's the one whose husband that said if I see anybody that looks like they're from Afghanistan or Iraq, I'm getting off the plane.
L:  Oh!
R:  And I'm like, well you can't do that, because you just never know, you know.  But he's just so adamant about it.  And, she's like, "What am I gonna do?  He'll get off the plane".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, she goes, "I'm not gonna get my vacation.  I'll just get --".  He was going to call the airline to ask it there was any names that resembled that.
L:  Ugh.
R:  But okay, that's a little extreme but now they haven't flown since, um, this happened, either.
L:  Right.
R:  So, this is their first time, so he is probably full of anxiety.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh!  I don't even know if I could do that.  You know, just call up and say, "Um, can you tell me who that is?" you know.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, no, I don't think I'd do that. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I understand his fears and all, that but, you know, like you said, that is, uh, to the extreme you know just ... and then you kinda feel bad for the person on the other end who ... who is of that descent so to speak, and --
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, and I can just imagine what they're going through.  I really can and they're absolutely innocent in the whole scandal, if you want to put it that way.
R:  Well, it's true though you know, there are things that have happened in this country if they wanted to block us all together and say we were all at fault.  You know, just I don't know, if you are white, Christ they could say, "You're a member of the Ku- Klu Klux Klan" and I have nothing to do with it.
L:  Right.
R:  You -- you can want people that way all you want, [COUGH] doesn't make them that way.  But some people do think that way; it's sad, it's really sad.
L:  It is.
R:  And the airlines have lost a ton of money --
