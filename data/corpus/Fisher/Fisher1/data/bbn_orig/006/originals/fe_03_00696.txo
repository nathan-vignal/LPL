R:  Hello.
L:  Uh, hello, my name's Janet, what's yours?
R:  My name is Adam.
L:  Adam, okay.
R:  How are you; how are you doing?
L:  I'm fine, how are you?
R:  Good thanks.
L:  That's good.  So, uh, do you like to eat at restaurants or at home?
R:  Well, I work in a restaurant, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- uh, I prefer to enjoy my leisure meals at home.
L:  I see.  [MN]
R:  Um ...
L:  Um, what's, um -- do you think the food is better at home or at the restaurant?
R:  Well, I think food is often better at home.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Myself.  I like to cook, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, I take more care.
L:  Uh-huh.  [COUGH] Excuse me.  Um --
R:  But you know, I wouldn't, you know -- I like -- since I'm a waiter, I can't, you know, deny this sort of element of, uh, being in public and engaging with people.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh, so --
R:  What about yourself?
L:  Um, well, I like -- I like it when people you know bring the food to me and treat me nicely you know as a waiter does.  Um, but then I also enjoy being able to select everything that goes into the pot --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, if it's organic or not, or if it's been washed or how long it's been in the refrigerator --
L:  -- and all that kind of thing.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I just feel like I have more control when I cook for myself.
R:  Yes.  I know what you mean.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, does that mean that you often, you eat -- you eat at home more than going out?
L:  Uh, yeah.  Actually, um, my pocketbook dictates that I eat at home, and, uh ...
R:  Right.
L:  So that's what I do.
R:  I see.
L:  [MN]
R:  And what else, uh, they're curious about our favorite meal or something like this?  The [inaudible], the robot wants to know what our favorite meal is.
L:  Oh, okay. Uh, gee, I think my favorite meal is oatmeal, uh, flavored with flaxseed.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  [LAUGH]  Very, very bland and, uh --
R:  That sounds all right for today; it's a lot of snow outside so it'd be a good winter meal.
L:  Oh, really, where are you at?
R:  I'm in Virginia.
L:  Oh, and you have snow?
R:  Yeah, we got -- we got a lot.
L:  Oh, well --
R:  Last night.
L:  -- I'm in Quebec and we have snow too.
R:  Oh, yeah?  You, I'm sure, have more. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, um, actually there's not that much on the street right now, uh, we had, ah, some days of [inaudible] so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, you can actually almost, uh, almost see the pavement in places.
R:  I see.
L:  [MN]  Still --
R:  Well, um.
L:  -- yeah um -- uh, what's your favorite meal?
R:  Um, let's see.  [LIPSMACK] I don't know if I could say that I really have a favorite meal.  I often cook the same thing when I cook at home.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, usually, uh, some vegetables and, uh, and either a pasta, a polenta or rice or something like this.
L:  [MN]
R:  And some sort of sauce.  Um --
L:  What's polenta?
R:  What's that?
L:  What's polenta?
R:  Oh, polenta is corn meal.  But if -- you can cook it with a little cream and butter and sort of, uh, it makes like a, um, either soft -- you can eat it soft with like a sauce, or you can let it harden and fry it, um, and eat it like a little, uh, sort of fried cake or something.
L:  Sort of -- and how's that different from grits?
R:  I don't think it is different from grits.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But grits is prepared often with, um, cheese I think or -- I think it's what -- what goes with the corn meal that makes grits.
L:  I see.
R:  Although I'm not sure.  I am in the south.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Did you grow up in the south?
R:  Uh, no, in, uh, Los Angeles, California.
L:  Oh?  Well, there's a lot of cultural influences out there.
R:  Yeah, that's for sure.
L:  Uh, I grew up in the mid west in a town that was settled partly by Italians but they didn't really leave their mark on the cuisine of my little town.
R:  Which town is this?
L:  Oh, it was Osage[?] City, Kansas.
R:  Oh, in Kansas?
L:  Yeah.
R:  All right.
L:  And I remember when pizza --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- arrived in, oh, like the late fifties or early sixties and we thought it was terribly exotic.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
L:  And terribly spicy.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  So, and before then --
R:  I've lost my taste for pizza somehow.
L:  Have you?
R:  Yeah, I don't know how it happened.
L:  Hm.
R:  You know everyone likes pizza, there's that saying that everyone likes pizza.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know if it's true so much.
L:  Hm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, actually since I've come to Quebec I haven't found a really good pizza, uh the pizzas here are kind of bland [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for my taste, so I'll eat it, I know that I'm eating nourishing food when I eat a pizza but it's, like, uh, um, -- you know -- what else is there?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  Well, I've actually got to go to this restaurant speaking of food and uh, begin setting up, um, I'm not sure if we'll have business 'cause of the snow, but ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN].  We'll see.
L:  So, how much, how much snow do you have?
R:  Oh, we only got maybe -- it looks like, uh, five, five inches, something like that.
L:  Oh, well.  That's quite a bit when you have to drive round in it.
R:  Uh, yeah.  The roads are pretty good.  It melted mostly today.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It was, you know, just cold enough to snow.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So.
L:  Yep, okay, [SIGH].
R:  Well, uh, nice talking with yah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's been quite pleasant, uh.
R:  Right.
L:  Have a good day at the restaurant.
R:  Likewise.
L:  Okay.
R:  Take care.
L:  You too.  Bye-bye.  [NOISE] Are you there?  How long are we supposed to talk?  No one knows.  Okay.  [NOISE]
