L:  Hi.
R:  Hi. I'm Bonnie Sanders [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, my name's Sandra too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How odd.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What was your first name?
L:  Sandra.
R:  Sandra?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay.  What were we supposed to discuss?
L:  Uh, whether, uh, September -- we've --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- made any changes to our lives since September eleventh.
R:  Okay.  Are they supposed to prompt us?  I've never done this before.
L:  I haven't either.  This is my --
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  -- first time.  I guess we're just supposed to say, "No" [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.
L:  I mean, I haven't, uh, changed anything.
R:  No, I don't think I have either.
L:  Okay.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know what to do next.  I guess -- I don't know if we need to be quiet or what.
R:  Okay [NOISE].  Sh, mummy's on the phone [PAUSE].
L:  Maybe so, maybe no [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know.  I've never done this.  They didn't tell us what to do.
L:  Uh-huh.  They didn't tell me either.
R:  [NOISE] I wonder if you should -- I don't know.  Um, I had read on the Internet that somebody said they just got on there and talked about something for a few minutes and then they came back on and said that was enough or whatever.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I don't know if that's what [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, okay [LAUGH].
R:  If we haven't done anything, I don't know what to do [LAUGH] --
L:  [MN] Well --
R:  -- you know [LAUGH].
L:  -- they said they were going to send me an email but I haven't been on to check it.  My daughter's been playing on the computer so ...
R:  Yeah, my mother in law actually is the one that signed up for this and she's not here so I thought I'd do it for her.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Did they say how much they pay you for these?
L:  Uh-uh.  No.
R:  Yeah.  I was curious.
L:  I'd forgot I'd even signed up for one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  She signs up for -- my mother in law signs up for everything.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I like doing surveys so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I usually do 'em.
R:  Hm.  She's always getting a five or a ten dollar check in here and there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and doing survey for this and that.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] She likes to do that kind of stuff and get freebies off the Internet.
L:  Yeah, that's what I do.
R:  I'm always at the post office getting freebies [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Yep.  That's what -- I don't do the freebies so much anymore but I used to do 'em a lot  [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but then they disappeared.
R:  They get tiring after a while.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You get to do a lot of the same stuff.  Emily, no more of that please [NOISE].
L:  Wow.  I can't imagine them thinking we had a big giant [NOISE] answer --
R:  And they record --
L:  -- to give 'em for this [LAUGH]
R:  Well, they record -- I really didn't change a whole lot --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, you know, we dug out American flag out that we already had and just happen for that, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and we put it out -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- pretty much all year round --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- now but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- instead of just Memorial Day or whatever, but that's really about the only changes we've made.
L:  I haven't done any.  I mean, I've been flying on airplanes, and --
R:  Oh, you have?
L:  -- stuff like that so I mean, I -- I'm not had any changes really that are --
R:  Yeah.  It doesn't bother --
L:  -- because of that.
R:  -- to fly or anything?
L:  Uh-uh. 
R:  No.
L:  No.
R:  I don't ever fly anyway so [LAUGH].
L:  I've only gone like twice but, you know --
R:  Yeah.  I think I've flown once my whole life so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really.
R:  I don't think I'd be nervous though about getting on a plane.  I mean, uh --
L:  No.
R:  -- I just --
L:  I was at first but [NOISE] now I'm not [NOISE].
R:  Yeah, the first time probably.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, it's nerve wracking to fly anyway --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for me but I don't think it'd be any big deal.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I don't think I would change anything either.
L:  Okay.
R:  Sit in there with it, baby.
L:  How long this is gonna take?
R:  I don't know.  They didn't say how many minutes or anything we were supposed to take, did they [NOISE]?
L:  Uh-uh.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No questions or anything.  How many questions?
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] I guess they come back on here after a while and tell ya --
L:  Yeah.
R:  --f [NOISE] you're done [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Cut you off or whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Did you have anybody that you knew in New -- where are you from?
L:  Missouri.
R:  Missouri.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, I'm in Texas.
L:  Oh, I'm getting ready --
R:  So, you didn't know anybody.
L:  -- to go there next month.
R:  Huh?
L:  I'm getting ready to go there next month.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Where to?
L:  Corpus Christi.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Way down there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm just north of Dallas a little bit.
L:  Oh, yeah.  We'll be heading that direction.
R:  [NOISE] You didn't have anybody in New York then, did you --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that was affected by --
L:  Nope.  Did you?
R:  Um, no, well my sister in law had her sister, um, was living there at the time but she wasn't [NOISE] um --
L:  She wasn't in the building?
R:  No, uh-uh.  She, uh, worked about two miles from it or so.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  It was kinda devastating for her 'cause she walked past it though, you know --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- on her way to work.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that morning she had already walked past it and been at work, you know.
L:  Oh, jeeze.
R:  Just gotten to work when all that happened so it kinda freaked her out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  In fact after she's moved back --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- now.  Uh --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- she moved back to Oklahoma after it [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  I think she decided it wasn't [LAUGH] New York wasn't cut out for her --
L:  Yeah [MN].
R:  -- after something like that [MN] --
L:  Yeah.  I wouldn't want --
R:  -- as I couldn't imagine.
L:  -- I wouldn't want to live on a coast right about now.
R:  No.  Uh-uh.  I couldn't imagine LA or anything like that.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  Sounds scary.  [NOISE] You can hear my child.
L:  [MN]
R:  Emily, mummy's on the phone, baby.  Got a three year old.  How old's your daughter?
L:  Four.
R:  Four.  I've got a three year old and three month old.
L:  Yeah, I've just got the one.  I'm not going for another one.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No way.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No way, no how.
R:  We're done.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm not having no more.  I've got one girl and one boy and I'm not having any more.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My kid's, uh -- she's in there playing with Polly Pocket at the moment.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I was playing in her room when they called.
R:  I think it's weird too that they -- they're gonna, uh -- you know, I mean, I kinda feel like everything's changed after September eleventh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I think it's weird too that they're grow up in a world, you know, different than what I knew but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then on the other hand --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- I guess every generation kinda does that.  It's a little worse each generation I think but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [MN] you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just weird to know that they're gonna grow up -- my son was born even after September eleventh so, you know, he's gonna just know a totally different world in the history books and stuff.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  Kinda odd to think about [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  It's, uh -- what, babe? [NOISE] Okay.  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, so it's really affected my sister a lot more than it has me.  She's like freaking out about everything.  She did the --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  -- "Oh, we're not going to the fourth of July big --"
R:  Celebrations.
L:  -- big celebrations, you know, like citywides[?] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and all that".  She's --"
R:  Scared to go do any of that kind of stuff?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where does she live at?
L:  Same-- same town.
R:  Oh, does she?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Huh, and I --
L:  You know, so --
R:  -- don't think you can really let it affect you -- you know, change your life a whole lot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I think it made a lot of people be more patriotic, you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- but I was always kinda patriotic anyway.
L:  Yeah.  Same here.
R:  So, I was kinda glad to see a lot of people do that.
L:  It was -- it was, you know, it was kinda good that it happened in a way because it did bring everybody together.
R:  Yeah, kinda opened everybody's eyes.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know, I think everybody --
L:  Don't take it for granted.
R:  -- yeah, I think everybody's appreciating life a whole lot more now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  I always felt that I was kinda that way anyway but it was neat to see how everybody else, you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- started changing and -- and --
L:  Oh, gosh.  Like the day after you couldn't find an American flag to buy anywhere in this --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- town.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was weird.
R:  Yeah, they said Walmart and everybody was totally sold out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of 'em [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  That was what in the tee shirts and --
L:  That's where we went.
R:  -- everything were so in demand --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's amazing how stuff like that -- something like that changes all that.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause on -- it -- just for like the first, I don't know, couple of days it seemed like -- seemed like we didn't even w- I mean, I don't know, it just was almost like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we didn't even live in the r- in the same country.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because all of a sudden --
R:  We were --
L:  -- you'd see American flags on every vehicle driving --
R:  Everything.
L:  -- down the road.  They were in every window.
R:  Stickers, and every body was giving away --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- bumper stickers, and everybody had --
L:  Yeah, it was like, "Did the aliens take over or something?"
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  I mean, you know, if you didn't --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it was just -- it was kinda odd --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to see --
R:  Yeah, it was.
L:  -- the change in just a couple of days.
R:  It was good but it was amazing how it happened overnight.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  
R:  You know.
L:  Really.
R:  I remember I was off work that day that, uh -- when it happened I was sick and had called in sick that morning and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- before I started -- I turned on the TV and seen everything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, I remember just being glued to the TV all day long.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Boy, I was glued for, like, a week.
R:  Yeah.  Well, yeah.
L:  I mean, yeah.  
R:  'Cause they -- they --
L:  To not watch it --
R:  -- canceled football and everything and every day I'd sit down, you know, and --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- and, uh-- well, I had seen -- I turned on the news after the first tower had been hit but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- before the second one was.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I remember sitting there watching that second one get hit and just going, "What in the world?" you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because at first I thought, "No, they were talking about terrorists and --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- stuff and I thought, "No that's just an accident" you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Some plane just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then to hear on the news, "Oh, they got another to the Pentagon" --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then they had another one, um, you know, that hadn't crashed yet that was in Pennsylvania.  I was like, "Oh, my God, where is that one going?" you know.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  It was kinda scary [LAUGH].
L:  I, uh, was watching that, um -- the -- the news show with Kitty Kirk on it when that happened and they were talking about it and the look on their face scared me more than anything --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause I'm thinking --
R:  Yeah, yeah, 'cause they're sitting there.
L:  -- "What's wrong with them?  I'm thinking, "What's wrong with them?  Something's wrong with them" and then I realized, "Oh, wait a minute" [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, that -- that wasn't an accident.
L:  The second plane just hit the next tower and --
R:  Yeah, it wasn't an accident.  That something was going on.
L:  -- it's now supposed to --
R:  Yeah, we had that.  One of my relatives, I can't remember now who it was, called and said, "America's under attack", you know and I'm right here not too far from Dallas.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I was like, "Oh, my God, are they gonna --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- nuke Dallas or something [LAUGH], you know.
L:  Yeah, yeah. 
R:  That's your --
L:  A big giant town.
R:  -- first -- that's your first thought is nuclear war, you know [LAUGH].
L:  That's right.  I thought the same thing.  I'm thinking, "Okay, we're the third largest city in --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- Missouri.
R:  Are you in St Louis?
L:  Kansas City --
R:  Kansas City.
L:  -- and St. Louis are gonna get hit first --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we're about two hours from them so ...
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's scary --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- it really is.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They sometimes say that when stuff breaks out.  I think, "God, if they're gonna hit Houston, maybe I'll be all right, but if they --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- hit Dallas, then oh, I'm in trouble" you know [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Then it's like, "Well" but I don't know, I don't think you should really live your life scared because there's nothing you can do about it.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  You know [LAUGH].
L:  No.  I wouldn't go anywhere else so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know I --
R:  I wouldn't want to -- I wouldn't want to live in another country or anything.
L:  Uh-uh.  Not at -- not at all.
R:  But, it is funny that America kinda got woke up because we always thought that stuff always hap- happened something else, you know.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  That was -- that was my thought too.  I thought, "Oh, that always happens overseas", you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Nothing like that ever happened here.  We'll never -- you know how you see that on TV?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You see the streets and stuff like that and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think, "Oh, that all is scary".
L:  It makes you, uh -- you know, it's made -- it -- it gives you a -- a sense of -- of, uh, all these countries that have been fighting for years --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and years and years.
R:  Yeah, and ...
