R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  This is Carolyn.
R:  Hi, Carolyn.  I'm Judy.  I'm living in Texas and you are from where?
L:  Missouri.
R:  Missouri.
L:  Where are you out in Texas?
R:  Oh, just outside of, uh, Dallas in a little country town called Terrell.
L:  Okay [MN].
R:  And I live out -- I have a farm outside of Terrell.  Uh, at the time -- you know, when nine eleven happened I was staying up at my mum's on that day.
L:  Boy, wasn't that something?
R:  Oh, it was terrible.  It was --
L:  My dau- I was sleeping and my daughter called me because she was teaching and she called me.  She said, "Mother, turn on the television".  I said, "What happened?" [LAUGH] and she says, "A plane hit the World Trade Center" and I turned it on and I'm like [MN] I thought, "My sister's there".  My -- I know my goofy sister would be at -- 'cause she lives in New York.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  I said, "Oh, she always travels back and forth to the city and I know she hasn't seen the World Trade Center" and I was just saying to myself -- I kept trying and trying to get a hold of her [LAUGH].
R:  So, how long --
L:  I live a few miles from Kansas City but my husband's from Texas.
R:  Oh, whereabouts?
L:  Weatherford.
R:  Weatherford.  Yeah, that's close to -- closer to, like, Fort Worth.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, he grew about around Sil- -- and nobody could believe that nine eleven.  I mean, we were like glued to the TV.
R:  I know.  When I -- I saw it -- I -- the TV happened to be on.  We don't usually watch it at that time but it happened to be on and I saw what had happened and , um, I -- I stood there and I said, "Mum, you know, I don't think that was a mistake" and then --
L:  No [LAUGH].
R:  -- and then we -- as we were standing there, I saw another one.  You know, when -- the second one that went through.
L:  Yeah, you just -- you couldn't believe it.
R:  Uh, and when the -- when the towers went down, I just sat down.  They-- they have a step going into their living room and I just sat down on that step.  I mean, I just dropped.  I went, "Oh, my God, you're not gonna believe this, Mom.  You're not gonna believe this.  It's gone.  They're both gone".  And course she had never seen, uh, the World Trade Center --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- and, you know, I've been there and I've been up in the -- the restaurant and everything and, uh --
L:  No, I hadn't been.
R:  Oh, and, well, you know, to me a tall building is the ones in Dallas and they're not that big but you go up in that World Trade Center, you're looking down on what looks little boats and little airplanes are flying around.  It'll make you nauseated, you know, the way that it feels like -- you can just feel the tower move almost or see it or you -- you sense it anyway, you know, because you're so high up.  And the idea that that would have just gone down [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and all those people.
L:  I don't -- I read in the paper or heard on television that they had pieces of the hijackers' bodies.  The FBI does.
R:  Pieces of 'em.  How do they know?
L:  Pieces of 'em.  I don't know.  They got the DNA from somebody.
R:  I mean, there was pieces of everybody.
L:  Yeah, I know but they had to piece their body together.  They do have parts of the --
R:  Whoa.  I didn't know that.
L:  But this is what gets me because if any part of them is missing, according to the Muslim faith, they don't go to heaven.
R:  Unless there's some special --
L:  No, there's not anything special.  
R:  Oh.
L:  They don't go to heaven.  They -- the body --
R:  Really?
L:  -- all has to be together.
R:  Oh, my.  So, they sacrificed themselves to do us harm.
L:  For ninety four virgins alleged.
R:  Oh, no.  Oh, no.
L:  And that one guy was so prissy, I couldn't believe it.  He wanted -- he -- like -- like if you go find the World Trade Center you're thinking of -- well, they're gonna shave all the hair off my body and they -- no woman can touch -- well, no woman did touch it.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean what could you touch of it [LAUGH]?  I mean, --
R:  Really [LAUGH].
L:  -- you know, he knew he was gonna die.  He had the will.
R:  Oh.  Well, have you flown any or needed to or not?
L:  I used to when my first husband was in the service.  We went back and forth from Hawaii and then I had to take my daughter to Fitzsimmons in Denver.
R:  But since nine eleven have -- have you?
L:  No.  No.  My husband will not even get on a plane.  He used to fly all the time when he's working.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And he was supposed to take a flight down there to get a car -- he's supposed to get himself a corvette.  You know, children when they get older --
R:  Uh-huh [LAUGH].
L:  -- in their sixties.  They've got to have a -- you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, he says, "I won't go in a plane".
R:  Well --
L:  But then my son in law has to travel every week.  He has to run back and forth to Dayton, Ohio.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And he has time for the plane all the time.
R:  Well, I think about it, you know.  Uh, I've -- I've traveled extensively, you know, um, in Europe and places like that but [MN] it has made me think more than once about whether I really want to do it or not.
L:  Well, you know, the thing is we live right on the path for Rosecrantz[?] Field which is the big deployment center for the air force --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it's where all the, uh, reserves, air force reserves so we get these C one thirties going over our head --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I mean, there's these great big huge planes and I keep thinking, "One of 'em is gonna fall on me".
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, because you see 'em and you can look up there and practically see the whole pilot and everything up there.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And no building in St. Joe is high.  I don't know if you've ever been in our town.
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  Okay, it's like Jesse James was killed here and the pony express started here.  That sort of thing.
R:  Uh-huh [LAUGH].
L:  And we -- you know, we have close to a hundred thousand --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but it's not a huge town, and, uh, you know, it's just like everybody was just hypnotized.  You didn't dare go any place.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Did -- could you?  I mean, people just could not do anything.  They just like glued.
R:  Yep, yep that's -- uh, that's the way we were too.  It was just -- uh, just stunned.  I mean there's no other word for it.  Just absolutely stunned and, um, [MN] I don't know, like I say we, um, I -- I have traveled quite a bit but since then, I haven't really wanted to.  It's -- it's not like I've used that as -- as a reason for not traveling but I know deep in my heart that I really kind of [LAUGH].
L:  Well, you know the thing is the trains are no better.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And the --
R:  Well --
L:  -- cruises -- what would happen if they got on a cruise?  They could blow up a thousand, over two thousand people.
R:  Well, see that -- that's the thought is that, you know, just about anything, any place [MN] I mean I feel like we're just kind of, um, surrounded and threatened, you know [LAUGH].
L:  Well you under -- yeah, well the thing is and here we're gonna go into a war.  Nobody's backing us.  I think we ought to stay away from Iraq for a while.
R:  I do too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, you know we're gonna go in there and we're gonna mess up and we'll get stuck in there like we did in Vietnam.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, that -- yeah, I -- I hear what you saying and that is a -- a real --
L:  And those --
R:  -- scary thing.
L:  -- people are mean in Iraq.  I mean, you know [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, you know --
L:  -- I -- I mean --
R:  -- they are.
L:  -- I've known A- Arab people.  I used to go with them, I used to date when I -- in between the times in marriages but I used to go with them --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they should be mean [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  W- and we don't understand a lot of, you know, what makes 'em tick.  We --
L:  Well, I -- you know --
R:  -- really, really don't.
L:  -- I've studied the faith --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the different faiths of the mid eastern people so I'm -- I'm pretty lucky on there and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I kind of understand the people and I can sympathize with them although I don't think we should be doing this witch hunting we're doing now.
R:  That's -- that's ex- exactly the way I feel about it too.  I really do.
L:  Did you see that poor woman, uh, on twenty twenty or something that she, uh -- her husband was killed by, uh, some fanatic, you know, after nine eleven and he was Pakistani or something and she's gonna be deported because he's dead now and they were over here -- he was over here on work, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- yeah, as a refuge and they're going to deport her because he's not here anymore.
R:  Well, isn't that kind of dangerous to her to go back?
L:  Yes, and I just couldn't believe it because I'm going, "But he died because we were goofy".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, you know, some people that were, you know -- and I -- I thought of Jerry Falwell.  I don't know whether you're that kind of a person but did you hear what he said?  He said that Mohammed was a fanatic and a crazy person and a terrorist.  I said, "Oh, that'll do good for ..."
R:  Oh, good for relations.
L:  Did you hear of that --
R:  No, I didn't [LAUGH].
L:  -- when him and Pat Robinson [MN] --
R:  I sure didn't.
L:  I mean I don't know what religious faith you are but I mean, I thought, "Oh, my God" and --
R:  Why not just --
L:  -- then they talk about the people in -- you know, the Muslims doing that.  I says, "That's the trouble.  You get fundamentalists on each side --"
R:  Yeah.  What --
L:  "-- and they do the same thing".
R:  One -- one of the problems I see is that, uh, now people have a tendency --I know I have a tendency, I'll put it that way, to [MN] look at people -- I don't know if they're Muslim, I don't know exactly where they're from but I'm --
L:  They could be from Italy.  You don't know.
R:  And I don't know and yet I don't feel that trust -- trusting of them anymore.
L:  But see I have a doctor -- uh, one of our doctors, our urologist, is a, um, Lebanese.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And he hasn't had any trouble.  I mean, like he's been here forty years but still, you know, people get a little uneasy and 'cause we have Arab doctors here.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We have a college town and my brother's one of the professors at the college and we have, oh, probably six or seven Pakistani or, you know, Arab people.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Nobody's done anything.  You know, they don't dare, of course, but, uh -- well, I feel sorry for 'em.
R:  I do too because, uh, like I say, I even feel hesitant and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for no r- for no real reason, you know, I just do.
