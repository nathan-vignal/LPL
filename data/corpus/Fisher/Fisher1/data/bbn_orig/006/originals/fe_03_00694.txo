R:  Hello
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Esky[?].
L:  I'm Roger.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  You too.
R:  So, what are we supposed to talk about?
L:  Um, I guess we're supposed to talk about airport security, I guess.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, they say -- they want to know if we're -- if we think it's going to help at all.
R:  So?
L:  I've flown once since the terrorist attacks in, um, two thousand one, and I -- they seem pretty thorough actually.  I had nail clippers in my school bag at one point and I didn't realize I put them in there and they found them, so --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I think that -- I think that it's going to help.  I don't really understand exactly why they're searching for every -- for nail clippers and stuff like that, like, I understand that it cold be used as a weapon but you know.
R:  Nail clippers?
L:  Yeah, like things you clip your nails with.
R:  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, and what did they do with them, did they take them?
L:  Yeah, they -- they -- they took them.  I could have ... I didn't really need them.  Because you can just go to the dollar store and buy other ones, but they took them, I didn't have a problem with that because they just didn't want it on the plane I guess.
R:  Yeah but how are you are supposed to clip your nails if they take your nail clip?
L:  Well, again, like, I can just, I just -- I didn't realize I put them in there and I can just go, like, it was my mistake 'cause I accidentally put them in the carry on luggage so I just figured that I can just go to the dollar store and get, like, another one or something, like, that so it wasn't really a big deal for me.  If I had something of value, I might ask them to, like, hold it and put it on my carry on --not my carry on -- but my checked baggage or something like that.
R:  Mhm.  I see.  So, when do you think we should stop?  At what point I mean?
L:  Well, I have, like I have no problem going through, like, the security checkpoints and stuff like that, but the -- one of the things that I thought was a little too far was when they decided, like, I fly usually out of Philly International, and they were checking shoes, that was about the time that that shoe bomber was going off and I just didn't -- I thought it was a little weird that they were checking shoes, but I understand why they're doing it.
R:  Actually they did check my shoes when I was, um, leaving or coming, I'm not sure.  But they did check my shoes.  Actually they checked, no actually it was at JFK they checked everyone's shoes, they had everyone to take off their shoes, and before going through the, ah ... the gate.
L:  Do you think that's too far or ...?
R:  Oh, considering that there was a person that, ah, had sort of a made up bomb in his shoe, and tried to explode it in flight, then I don't think it's that excessive.  But, um, I'm not sure how long, um, to what extent you can actually um, keep this going, for how long.  Because let's say you have another terrorist attack involving the airport security and so forth, something similar at least, then you need other measures and then others and then others so we have to let's say, rule a line and try and let's say, uh, prevent the problem that is per- try and solve the, um ... determine what this [inaudible] terrorist attacks instead of preventing them through, um, extra security, whatever.
L:  Yeah.  Well, also part of what I think -- part of what I think happened during the terrorist attacks where I think some people -- I thought I remember them saying that some of it was the employees had planted some of the things on the planes, so I think those people also need to go through some sort of security to make sure that they're not bringing things on to the plane so it shouldn't be there also.
R:  Oh yeah, that's true.  Because I've seen the, um, a lot of you know airports and the, um ... the airports at least being pilots and the, um, stewardess don't go through those security checks or that's a possibility too so ...
L:  Yeah, and all those people, like the people who bring the food on to the plane.
R:  Yeah and the work and everything so you never know.  But, you know there's always um [several inaudible words].  Things change after something bad happens.  The problem is, you don't have to change it too much in order to make it let's say an inconvenience to the people and the public, because right now you have to be ah let's say three hours before your flight at the airport.  It's too much pain, too much time to wait there, three hours and then wait and then, it's crazy.
L:  Yeah, part of -- part of the point of flying was that it was supposed to be faster than any other way.
R:  Yeah, and it takes now, I don't know how long.  It should be like a bus I think that's the way to, uh ... let's say, trip flying in the sense that, I think if you travel and the people whatever should be, um, one hundred percent isolated ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so there will be -- there would be no less interference between the, uh, pilot and the, um, whoever is running the thing, and have had these instances before.
L:  Yeah, so at least, you can at least land the plane and --
R:  Yeah, land it and let's make sure that this thing doesn't happen.
L:  Yeah, so you can't use the plane as a weapon itself.
R:  Yeah.  And now, I believe the problem then [NOISE] is because I didn't do any internal flights before, let's say, um, non international flights.  So, do they check shoes and they check bags and [inaudible] as, ah, um, an international flight?
L:  Um, I would think that they would -- I think that it would probably be better if, like, they made sure that the checked baggage definitely would like be -- they all were screened too.
R:  Mhm.  But do they do that?  Do they check like the internal flights, do they check those things, do they do all sort of the same things?
L:  Well, right now they screen a hundred percent of the baggage for international flights but not for domestic flights.
R:  Oh.  I see.
L:  I think that's part of it too because it's easy, you could just easily put something on it, like, in a bag, like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, you could just easily put something in a bag that's going on a domestic flight and easily just blow it up in the air.
R:  Yes.  I don't think that's happened before but ... maybe let's not give them any ideas.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] What, yeah, definitely, like, at least come up with a way to get people through the lines faster because -- and you can't keep it -- keep it -- you have to find better ways of getting people through that line too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like -- like, what do you think about -- you know how they're gonna come up with a frequent flyer card for people so that they can just get moved through the line faster because they fly so often?  Do you think that's a good idea?
R:  I think that's discrimination.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It would certainly help me because I'm, let's say, a frequent flyer.  But, uh, I don't think that's fair.  [several inaudible words] wait in line, and that's it.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Why should they get preferential treatment if they fly often; that's stupid.
L:  You mean, like the way an airline would do now, how they have, like, the special lines for the travelers that travel all the time, and stuff like that?
R:  No, the special lines they have, is because they pay more.  There is economy and business.  If you pay more then okay ... that's fine but besides that why should there be preferential lines when you're going through security?  That's stupid.  Security is for everyone; it's like having different courts to judge the rich people and different courts to judge the poor people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you see my point?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I don't think that should be implemented.  It's, um -- it's discrimination.
L:  Do you like the way -- do you like, um -- do you like the fact that the United States government took over the airport security in the United States?
R:  Well ... despite the fact that most people, let's say, in the United States, [inaudible] like as much, the let's say in government -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- taking over control and so on.  I think certain things should be left to the government, even though, um, she may not do a good job as you're supposed to, but the point is that, uh, if you trust something to government, um, you're not same -- in a sense sure that you're gonna have minimum performance; absolute minimum performance.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which is, let's say is in a sort of way guaranteed where as in a business you may have a, um, let's say an advertised minimum performance but [inaudible] actual minimum performance is actually much less.
L:  Well, yeah I think, I think --
R:  In a public business let's say what they show is something different of what they are.
L:  Like the business is gonna try and do it at the lowest cost possible.
R:  Yes, exactly.  I'm not saying that they may not do it better than -- they may do it better -- but when you need, let's say, an absolute minimum performance from a certain, let's say, a credible facility, credible business, then without considering cost you should do it on you own.
L:  Yeah, well, I think also the federal government at least can standardize it from airport to airport so it's not like, you have -- we have people just running -- like, I know it's not necessarily that way now, but maybe at least over -- while they get this definitely, um, implemented, I think that they cam train people the same way so everybody has the same background so you can have some sort --of -- the same kind of -- some sort of standardization --
R:  Yeah
L:  -- of the security measures.
R:  That's important.  Yeah, what did you think about that, um, [inaudible] that they advertised so much before?  Have you seen the news?
