R:  Hello.
L:  Hi [MN].
R:  Hi [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Have you done one of these before?
R:  No, this is my first one.
L:  Okay, me too.  Um --
R:  I was hoping we'd get to talk about something cheery like our house pets but it seems not [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Um, I'm Diana Stebner[?].  I'm in Texas.
R:  Oh, my name's Dominee[?].  I'm in Texas as well.
L:  Where in Texas?
R:  Austin.
L:  Austin.  Okay, I'm in Houston.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] So, I guess we should talk about our topic.
L:  Yes.
R:  Have you had any changes?
L:  Um, I guess the biggest change is the financial hit that took our -- instead of looking forward to retiring shortly, it's getting put farther away.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, we have a lot less four one K than when we had before.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, but as far as -- I still fly.  I don't --
R:  Yeah, I fly too.  I was nervous.  I didn't for about a year but then it didn't really come up.  I didn't have to fly so ...
L:  Um, I guess I figured that it was like a "fool me once".
R:  Yeah.
L:  That I really didn't think it would, you know -- they had done that and it wouldn't be happening again.
R:  Yeah, I was actually in New York on the, uh, anniversary because my family -- that's where I'm from.  I'm from Brooklyn.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I went up there to visit my family.  It just happened to be at that time and it was strange.  I was nervous beforehand.  I -- you know, a little bit --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it didn't stop me but I was a little bit nervous but then once I got there, you know, we just can't sit around thinking about it.  You know, just kind of life goes on.  People might have --
L:  Did you go down to the -- to the Trade Center?
R:  No, I didn't go.  I didn't go down there because that wasn't the part of town I was in.  I was in more central Manhattan.
L:  Okay.
R:  And then in Brooklyn and New Jersey but [MN] yeah.
L:  Any other changes in your life?
R:  Uh, let's see.  I don't know.  I guess I -- for a while there I paid a lot more attention to the news.  I mean, I always keep up but now it's like if ever I'm home and doing chores I always kind of have CNN on in the background.  Especially at the very beginning there when it seemed like there was breaking news things.  It was like, "What else could happen?"  We're breaking it every few minutes.
L:  Right, and I think probably a lot of people pay more attention to the news now than they used to.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, because, you're right, there are a lot of things that they tend to come on with.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think probably I tell my kids -- I call them a little more often --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just to say, "Hi".
R:  [LAUGH] That's good.  Yeah, when it happened my parents were living overseas so it was strange.  In a way I was glad for them because I didn't know what was gonna happen here.  I mean, when it first happened, you know, who -- who knew if things were gonna start happening every day or not.
L:  Right.
R:  But in a way it was hard for them being overseas.  They were in Asia because, like, they felt so removed from everything and a lot of the, uh, media over there was a little harsher than it was over here so they were kind of -- it was hard for them having to be in a kind of anti American climate when all this was going on --
L:  Oh, yeah.  I can imagine.
R:  -- and everyone was in shock [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.  What does -- what did they do that they were in Egypt?
R:  Oh, no.  They were in Asia.
L:  Oh, Asia.  Okay.
R:  Yeah, they were in Hong Kong [LAUGH].  I know what -- 
L:  Okay.  I thought you said Egypt --
R:  -- that would have been --
L:  -- and I'm thinking, "Oh, God" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Egypt would have been really bad.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH]. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, my son travels.  He's got a girlfriend or a good friend in, um, Paris.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And he goes over there to skiing about once a year and I always worry about him when he goes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And he said he, um, tries to affect a Canadian accent --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and say he's from Canada [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Cause he doesn't -- he speaks some French --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but not enough to pull it off that he's not American so ...
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, my dad was in Korea just a couple of weeks ago when all that was starting to heat up and I --
L:  Oh, jeeze.
R:  -- was like, "Oh, God".  He was in Seoul in South Korea but I always get nervous when -- when he travels.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  He travels internationally a lot.  He's actually been to the Middle East but not since all this happened.
L:  Okay.  I was --
R:  He used --
L:  -- going to say does he ever get to go anywhere nice? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].  He used to go to Pakistan all the time but they haven't -- since September eleventh he hasn't been there.  I think he's been to India once but --
L:  Wow.  What does he do?
R:  He works in retail so he goes over there to check the factories and make sure everything's okay.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, there's a lot of -- you know, he gets to go to some nice places but it's mostly, um, mostly like Taiwan and Hong Kong --
L:  Yeah, places where they have the cheaper labor.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- [MN] it's -- but he's been to the Middle East because they do a lot of, uh -- they used to do some business with Israel so he'd go to Israel and, like, you have to have two passports because if you have Israel stamped on your passport, the middle eastern countries wouldn't let you in, so I don't know -- I guess having two passports works.  I don't know exactly how it works but he says that how most people do because he used to have to go to Egypt and, like, they would never -- they wouldn't let him in if he had the Israeli stamp on this passport.  I think he only went to Israel like once or twice.  It's not like he was there all the time.  But he doesn't go -- they don't send them to any of those places anymore.  I think they're too nervous.
L:  I think that's a very good idea.
R:  Yeah, --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- especially Pakistan where they could be kidnapped.
L:  But that's right, and there was a photographer and report in Columbia just recently that got kidnapped.  I think it was last week.
R:  Yeah, I saw that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So scary.
L:  Yes, it is.  Do you have -- do they come on and tell us when to stop?  Do we have any ideas?
R:  I think they probably do but I [LAUGH] --
L:  Okay [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] The little robot operator [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, I, uh -- when I signed up to do this I really didn't have any idea what I was getting myself into.
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  But you can only do three of 'em.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So -- and I guess we could have just said, "No we don't like that topic.  We want something nicer".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I don't know how much they expect us --
R:  I think they said ten minutes.  Isn't it ten minutes?
L:  Okay.
R:  I -- I haven't been keeping track but I think that it's probably -- we're probably almost done.
L:  Yeah.  Um, and I guess some people could get into really political discussions over nine eleven and, um --
R:  Yeah, maybe they want us to argue [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Well --
R:  Well, what do you -- well, who's gonna be for nine eleven [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  Um, okay.
R:  [MN] I don't know.
L:  So, do you do in, um, Boston?
R:  I'm a writer.
L:  You're a writer.  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  How about you?
L:  Um, right now I'm just a housewife.
R:  Oh.
L:  I, um, I've done several different things and I -- my husband's job isn't real secure at this point --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so I don't want to do anything that -- if I'm gonna have to pick up and move.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I play sweeps on the Internet and I, uh, go to movies [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, what do you write?
R:  I write, uh, fiction like short fiction and I've had, like, poetry published.  I'm working on a novel now so ...
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  I've written screenplays but none of them have gotten made so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- [LAUGH] you wouldn't have heard of any of my movies [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Well, now what's your name again?
R:  Dominee.
L:  Dominee?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Okay.  See if I can remember that when you become famous.  I'll say, "I talked to that lady on the phone one day".
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, do you think that we- being in Texas that like we're less connected to it because, even if anything else happened, I mean, like I feel that it's pretty unlikely that anything would happen here. 
L:  Okay. No, see --
R:  Like if you lived in --
L:  -- being in Houston scares me to death.
R:  Oh, 'cause of the oil.
L:  Yes.  One big boom --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- but not only that but all those pipes connect all of the count- all over the state --
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  -- and if you set a fire in one of 'em and it gets bad enough, it's gonna up all through the state so yeah, it does --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kinda freak me out here.
R:  Yeah.  I guess that's true.  I didn't think of that.
L:  Yeah, um, Austin's such a neat place.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I really like it there and I -- I probably would feel safer there but, um --
R:  Yeah, the only thing I could think of that made me nervous is like one of George Bush's daughters goes to school here --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but, I mean, who would like blow up a city just because of that [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  I mean, you think I'm stupid --
L:  I -- I -- I --
R:  -- but right after, you know, when I was worried about everything happening 'cause all my family, you know, was still in New York --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I worry about them all the time and I have friends who live in DC and it's like here it feels relatively safe.  Like that's the only thing that's even political here [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  I think they probably --
R:  -- and then that he was the governor.
L:  -- attack Crawford, like his ranch, before they'd come after the daughter so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I actually don't know, where exactly is Crawford?  Do you know?
L:  It's somewhere out by Waco.
R:  Okay.  So kind of between here and Dallas.
L:  Yeah, mhm.
R:  You know, because I wasn't sure.  It always seems like they were pretty -- like our local news always goes to cover it so I knew it couldn't be like that far.
L:  Yeah, um, yeah I -- I -- it can't be that big either --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- because I've [NOISE] --
R:  -- it must be a little town.
L:  -- I lived in outside of, um -- well between Dallas and Fort Worth for --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- quite a while and would drive down to Austin and stop and I don't remember any big signs or anything about Crawford so ...
R:  Yeah, 'cause I went to high school in Plano and I used to -- and my parents lived there while I was in college back here in Austin.  We drove up and down the interstate all the time and I don't remember ever seeing signs for it either like Hillsborough, Wacahatchi[?], all those places but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  It must be a little tiny town.
L:  Mhm.
