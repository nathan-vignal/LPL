R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Christie.
R:  Hi, I'm Cathy.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm good.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, what do you think about the airport security?  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Well, I don't think it  -- well, it does a little bit more good than it used to, but I still don't think it's -- it could be better.
R:  Right, that's -- I feel the same way.  I don't -- I don't think there's too much we can do about terrorist attacks.  If they want to get in they'll figure out a way to do it.
L:  Yep, I agree.
R:  [MN]
L:  And ...
R:  Tightened security might help, like you said, a little bit, but ...
L:  Yeah, but it's not gonna ... if they wanna get in bad enough they will.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]  Yes, I feel the same way.
L:  [MN]  And I don't the new -- you have to leave your suitcase unlocked, I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that would be fine as long as you could lock it again before it goes onto baggage or whatever, but --
R:  Right, I agree.
L:  -- that just promotes more airport employees going through your stuff --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and taking whatever the hell they feel like it.
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I agree, I don't really travel that much so I don't -- I don't feel --
L:  I don't either.
R:  -- threatened by it myself because I'm really not a traveller, but ...
L:  Yeah, I very rarely fly anywhere.
R:  Yep.
L:  Once or twice every, you know, two, three years, so --
R:  Yeah, that's about me, maybe every five or six years [LAUGH] even.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I really don't go very -- go anywhere.  I did however go, of course like a month after the September eleventh happened.  [LAUGH]  I went to Las Vegas but ...
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] Did you feel safe?
L:  But I was a little worried, but ...
R:  Did you feel safer though because they were checking things better?
L:  I guess.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, how safe can you really feel though?
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  Well, that's what -- that's how I feel about it; you know they can tighten security but you're still always -- you never know what's going to happen.  I mean you could walk down the street and get hit by a car.  [LAUGH]  You know?
L:  Exactly.  Yeah, I don't think it's gonna  -- I mean -- it's changed and all it's done is create a bigger hassle for the honest person trying to get on an airplane.
R:  Right, I agree.
L:  But, again, you look at other countries who ... their security has -- have always been really strict and they've always searched everything and -- and you know it -- they don't seem to have any problems.
R:  Right.
L:  But they don't have the amount, or the volume of people that we do, travelling every day either.
R:  That's true, yeah.
L:  [MN]  Kinda difficult.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's tough for all the airlines too, who are losing business because of it.
R:  Yeah.  But the thing is people have to travel so you are always gonna have a lot of -- a lot of airplanes up there and a lot of chance for terrorists to, like, figure out some other way to get in, you know.
L:  Right.  I'm sure they'll figure out a new way.
R:  Yes, that's --
L:  You know.
R:  -- the scary part.  You never know.  [LAUGH]  No matter what type of security they have, you never know what's going to happen next, so --
L:  Right, and if you have enough money you can buy your own jet.
R:  Right.
L:  And have your own ... you know, flight crew and stuff and go fly that into a building.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Who's gonna stop that?
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  Right.
L:  Because it it's a private plane, they don't check you like -- you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think they do anyway.
R:  Yeah, I don't think, like, the smaller airports probably don't have security that they do at the larger ones.
L:  Right.  And I think their -- their xray machines suck to begin with.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't think that [LAUGH] you know, I don't think that they really do a good enough job.
R:  Right.  Well, look at right after everything happened how many people were going through and they found out that you know -- they got through with knives and other things that they had, and got through the system.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, and I can't -- one guy hadn't he put dynamite or something in his shoe?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, we used to get around that I guess.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, unfortunately. [SIGH] well like you said, luckily for both of us neither one of us fly very often so it's not that big of a deal.
R:  Right.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Well.
L:  Okay, well, how much time's left?  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know, that's what I was wondering.  Is this thing, or is there a time limit, like does it automatically say, "Okay, your time is up" [LAUGH] or do you just keep talking?  [LAUGH].
L:  I'm not sure; this is the first one I've done.
R:  I know this is the first one I've done too.  I think it said, like, ten minutes or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But how much --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- can you talk about the one subject for ten minutes?  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  I don't have much more to say other than that.  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't, how do you feel about it, well we always say how we feel about it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  Uh.
L:  I don't know.  It could be better.
R:  Yes, I --
L:  But then it's just gonna create longer lines and bigger hassles but in the long run it would be worth it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you know you're ... you know -- not going to be flown into a building or die because of a terrorist --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's worth the longer wait and the bigger hassle that it is.
R:  That's true, too.  Every little bit helps, you know.  If they can tighten security and you know save one plane, then they did a good job so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, it's worth it I guess.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  It would take a lot to coordinate something like they did.  I don't think that ... they would be able to do that again.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, take four planes, you know at one time and --
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, yeah, maybe one, you know maybe two.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I don't think all at the same time; that they would ever be able to pull that off again.
R:  But that's the whole thing, I don't think they'd ever try to do something the same as --the same thing again.  They'd try -- it'd be something totally different, like, who would --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- have ever even thought that you know, what happened could have happened that way.  You know, ever- that's like something nobody even ever dreamed of.
L:  Right.
R:  So, there's probably something else that nobody even ever thought of that they're probably planning right now for ten years from now.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  We don't know.
L:  I'm sure, I thought -- I thought they were -- I was at work when that happened and I thought somebody was joking when he came to my desk and, like, "Get out of here".
R:  Me too, I know.  When we first started hearing about it at my job, it was the same way, everybody was, like, "What?" you know and you know you were getting, like, little pieces of information at the beginning and everybody you know was, like, you know, "This is -- you've got to be kidding".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I was -- somebody came up to my desk and told me and I'm, like, "What?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "You're joking, right?"  He was, like, "No".  I'm like, "Oh my God!" and we got a TV set together, and I have a radio at my desk and I put it on and, like, then they said you know, "The Pentagon" and I was , like, "Oh my God!"  It was just unbelievable.
R:  It was.  Mhm.
L:  [MN]
R:  The first I heard about it at work, they came in and just said a plane had hit the World Trade Centre, the Twin Towers, and we just thought it was an accident, you know, like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- oh wow, that s awful, you know, a plane ran into the building.  But then, like, ten minutes later somebody else called us and they said, "You know, you are not going to believe this, it's on the news, another plane hit" and then we started really talking about it and started, you know, listening to the radio and everything.  [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Terrible.  Oh, well.
L:  Yeah.  Oh well, hopefully it'll get better and ... you know nothing like that, uh plane wise would happen again, but like --
R:  Right.
L:  But who knows.
R:  Um, hopefully not.
L:  We probably have to, you know, be more secure in all the borders, you know from here to Canada, from here to Mexico.  You know, not just airplane rides but, you know, border patrols and --
R:  Right.
L:  Anybody can come into the United States.
R:  Right.  That's true.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  I think that's another reason we've made it too easy for people to get here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, even to --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- fly here from other countries, you know if you have a visa or you have, you know, a green card or whatever, you can get in.
R:  Right.  And the --
L:  I don't -- I don't --
R:  -- people that get in stay here or they are here illegally and they're still here anyway, for years.
L:  Right, I don't think it should be that way either.
R:  No, it shouldn't be.
L:  I know America's the land of the free but I think we should be a little more, uh, tight on security and who we let in.
R:  Right, well that's it, especially now, you know, not knowing who's a terrorist and who's not.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, you can't just let everybody in and say, "Well, we'll try to figure it out", you know.
L:  [MN]
R:  Can't do it.
L:  [MN] I mean, I guess they come back on and say when your time's up.
R:  I guess, I would think so.  [LAUGH]  Otherwise people could just talk for days.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I don't have much more to say though.  [LAUGH]
R:  It would be better if it was a subject that you had more to say about.  You know, like this, like, there's really not too much more than you can say --
L:  Right.
R:  -- how you'd feel about it, you know.
L:  Well, we've kinda covered it all.
R:  Yeah, I think so.
L:  I mean, I don't know any ways to -- to make it better, but ...
R:  Right.
L:  Something -- somebody should come up with something. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Uh, we need some kind of, like, Star Trek laser things that they just, like, wave the wand over you and they can tell everything, [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH]
R:  -- inside out, what you got, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Some space age --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- thing.
R:  You know.  Something that's [inaudible] and thorough.
L:  And what they'll let you have on a plane in your carry on is just ridiculous.  You can't  have nail clippers.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Come on now!
R:  That's true.  [LAUGH]
L:  What is somebody gonna do with a pair of nail clippers?  [LAUGH]  "Come here and we'll cut your nails off".
R:  Yeah, pull your toenails out, one by one.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I mean, scissors I can see.
R:  Right, something that's sharp.
L:  A little more dangerous.
R:  Right.
L:  Not as obviously, you know -- you know, put it on your check luggage if you have to take scissors or a knife.  I mean, I usually typically carry scissors with me.
R:  Right, you --that's it -- you know, you'd have like a --
L:  You know.
R:  -- bag with little things like that: scissors, nail file, and things but --
L:  Right.  Of course, the scissors I have are the kind that just, like, clip -- trim my bangs or something, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're not even sharp on the end.  So, I mean, they could be used as a deadly weapon, but ...
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I think it's silly some of the stuff that they say you can't have on your carry on nowadays.
