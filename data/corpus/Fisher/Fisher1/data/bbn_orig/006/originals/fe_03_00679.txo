R:  Hi.
L:  Hello?
R:  Yes, hi.
L:  How you doing, I'm Ed.
R:  Hi Ed, my name is Richard.
L:  How are you doing, Richard?  So, what do you think? [LAUGH]
R:  Ah ha, I would -- I would be of the ilk that yes it does?
L:  I would also.
R:  Because the mere presence there makes people think twice.
L:  Oh, I don't know about making them think twice.  They have those problems, um ... they don't have the problems like in Israel and stuff like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as we do, but, um, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I think what they would -- you'd have more problems with those, uh, at the other end where they have the problems like in Israel, where they're bombing things and you know ... [SIGH] in other areas, you know what I'm saying?
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, the, um ... [SIGH] there's -- there's got to be a better way to do it as far as I'm concerned but in- instead of tying up everything the way they have been ...
R:  Well, it's like anything though, it goes through growing pains and I've experienced it enough to realize it first hand.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I've only gone a couple of times, and unfortunately the couple of times I went, I was stuck at the airport for like three or four hours.
R:  Three of four hours?  Where were you flying?
L:  Pardon me?
R:  Where are you flying from?
L:  Out of Buffalo. [MN] 
R:  Out of Buffalo?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Okay, 'cause I'm in Hawaii.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I have never experienced a delay of longer than probably thirty minutes, but I also arrive at the airports almost two hours early just to avoid this.
L:  Well, that's basically what I'm speaking of; the two hours getting in there to get you know the register and everything else --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, ah, it took that, well, in Buffalo you took approximately an hour, an hour and a half to get us moving, you know, it's ah, it's crazy.  I noti- I noticed some of the things that they were doing because they redesigned the airport.  Their parking was, uh, absolutely disgusting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because where you had to park and everything else and then you know, um ...
R:  Well, most of the time we use a rental car so when I get there, uh, the missus, we go in and the missus usually takes care of, uh -- we just check all our baggage through the, uh, uh, porters at the entrance.
L:  At the entrance, right.
R:  And then she'll take, uh, some of our hand carriers and go and start to check in immediately, and then I'll go return the rental car which is off airport typically.
L:  Right.
R:  Come back to the airport and then I'll go through to security and because we always take our office on the road, uh, I can't help but get stopped because I have a lot of computer, uh, gadgets and all of these wires and things [LAUGH] in my briefcases so ...
L:  Oh, my lord.
R:  Um, it goes without saying that I just look at it and open it up.  Whatever you need look at it.  I tear everything open, I don't care and I'm taking off shoes as directed and I just look at this and say uh, "Go ahead, find whatever you want to find".
L:  Well, we-
R:  It's upsetting to me when they look and he sees some pistol is someone's baggage, and then he disappears in the crowd which results in everybody getting thrown out of the airport and restrained.  Now, that's frustrating.  That hasn't happened to me and if that does I would be very, very upset.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you know, it -- it -- I don't know if I'd be upset about that, but the problem --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- would be, I would have to imagine it was how did they get it in there in the first place? 
R:  Mhm
L:  I mean, the last thing -- I mean use that -- would they pull the whatchamacallit was knives I mean, what were they, package knives?
R:  Right.
L:  Box knives, that's what they call them, and you know I mean, uh, more or less gang rushed the pilot's, ah, [MN] -- the pilot's cabin but the, uh [COUGH] -- on the -- on the other hand, you know, a gun in the airport means somebody failed some place, and if there's one gun, you know what I mean?
R:  That's -- that's the thing is that, ah, these people still feel that they can get silly again and that's where I'm saying to you, you have to have a presence there.
L:  Right.
R:  In order to stop that.  And that's the only way its going to be done, ah, because there's a lot of people that will push the envelope, and they have got to just make it absolutely positive in everyone's mind that if you're caught doing any of this that there will be some consequences that will be severe.  And that's the only way that you are going to stop this.  Now, there's these other people that are just plain fanatics and anyone who wants to die for their country or their religion, they will --
L:  Right, well.
R:  -- and there's nothing you can do about that.
L:  That's -- that's without, uh -- without a doubt, I mean ...
R:  But what we're aiming for is to minimize exposure, and for that I'm all for, and it's going to cost us a little more money, that's all right; I don't mind paying a little more money to make sure I'm going to arrive safe.
L:  Right, that's the bottom line,
R:  Then, and that's where I feel most people look at, and they'll agree if they do any flying.  Uh, a lot of people aren't flying, they're driving now, and I don't have that luxury 'cause in Hawaii, I start off all my trips with a five hour flight.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, just to get some place.
R:  Just to get to where I -- I start to work and, um, so that -- that makes me a little more vulnerable in that respect.  But, it's the whole transportation, period.  So, I look at that and I go, uh, I can live with it. Yeah, it will be a pain and yeah, uh, it's going to be like this for a long time, but if that's what it takes to make sure we don't go through another um nine eleven, that's a small price to pay,
L:  It is really if you stop to rationalize it, the, ah, -- it, like, in my case, I [MN] -- we -- we took off -- we went down to Florida on vacation shortly after nine eleven, and I wasn't particularly scared about going, and -- but the -- for me it was the ramifications of the waits that we had.  Because, like I said -- like you said it was going through a growing stage, and I'm sure our wait was ridiculously long because of the fact it was just after that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, so it was like in January we went, and, um, you -- we -- you know it's like I told my wife, I says, "I wouldn't want to do this again because of that but so we're going to have to wait for a while".  But it was, you know, like I said it is a pleasure thing and like you just said it's, uh, getting there was, uh, all important.  [LAUGH]  I'm scared to death of planes to begin with --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- and just looked at the landing aspect of it was my, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm glad we touched down on all wheels to begin with you know what I'm saying?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So it is, um -- it's not so much the -- the -- how can I put it?  The -- the taking off from the Buffalo airport and that, because who would ever think Buffalo was an area for terrorists.  And about a year later they found out they had a terrorist cell in Lake [inaudible] which is about five miles outside from where I live.
R:  Ooh.
L:  So, you know, and I said you have to rationalize the fact well, yeah, this could be a very bad area, you know, for terrier -- terrorists and that.
R:  Well, that's interesting because you know everyone says that's not going to happen here, and there's a lot of things they discover after a while that have been going on under everyones noses.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And, like I said there's no preparation for that because there was no precedence for it.
L:  Right.  Usually -- well, in our way of thinking, you -- you know, we -- we -- we've gone as far as ... because of our area, because we're close to the Canadian border, okay, and our borderlines were very lax, okay?  Well, we used -- what my aunt used to do is go from Buffalo to Toronto and take Toronto to, like -- we -- we're Lebanese and she would visit our relatives in, um ... uh, Lebanon.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you know, she would go on her vacations and that, but we'd go through the border here because there's no checking.
R:  Right.
L:  You know what I'm saying?  And she could come back into Buffalo by landing in Toronto and she would come back with her gold chains and stuff like that and when we came back over the bridge, they'd never check any of that stuff.  "Where were you?"  "Well, we were at Toronto, you know we were in Toronto".  "Well, what were you doing?"  "I was picking up my aunt; she was on vacation".  If you then say that she was on vacation, where she was at, you know what I am saying?
R:  Mhm.
L:  They never bothered ya.  "Okay, have a good day, go on".  And that went on for years, [LAUGH] and you know -- and now, it's -- what's rightly so, you know, that aspect of it, that there is like a big hole in their security from the customs agents and that.  And they never thought of somebody going to Toronto to take a vacation into ... Iraq or whatever going that way, you know and they never thought of it that way.  And to me, you know after you realized that that hole was there and we found it by accident basically, what else could be happening, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, you know, it is not unlike you where you would be coming into the States from the States but it was an island you know.
R:  Right.
L:  It's a -- at christmas time we were talking about it and I reminded my aunt about that and she says, "You know, I never really thought about it" and she goes, because we're -- it's not really an abuse because she wasn't doing anything illegal but by the same token, if somebody was looking for a way to do it, that would be the way, you know?
R:  That -- that's what -- those are the loopholes --
