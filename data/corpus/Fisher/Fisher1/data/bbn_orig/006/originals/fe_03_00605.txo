L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi. 
R:  Hi, my name is Sharon.
L:  Hi, Sharon, this is Louise.  I did this survey once today. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, did you? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes, I did.
R:  [SIGH] Well, this is my first time.
L:  Okay, well, what's your favorite holiday?
R:  [SIGH] Well, I think my favorite holiday is probably Thanksgiving.
L:  Thanksgiving?
R:  Yeah, how about you?
L:  Oh, I think I like Christmas, just because of the decorations --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- not because it -- you know, it's all special, but j- I like the house decorated. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] yeah, that is nice too. [SIGH] I don't know, I guess Thanksgiving because, um, [LIPSMACK] I like to cook and that's the tradition -- turkey with all --
L:  Turkey, yeah.
R:  -- the trimmings and everything, so [SIGH] -- and to me it's a lot less stressful than Christmas time.
L:  Ah.
R:  You know, even --
L:  Yeah, the -- they -- they -- you know, you've got to be right on that, it really is.
R:  Yeah, and I love the dec-
L:  Your biggest worry is just getting the turkey done. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And it being juicy.
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
L:  [SIGH] Christmas you don't need to get everybody to just get what they like, blah blah blah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] and, um, [LIPSMACK] I love the decorations and the lights and everything of that sort and I love to decorate the house, but I do find Christmas to be [SIGH] very stressful, and I haven't, um, found my way around that yet, I haven't figured that out over all --
L:  Yeah, yeah --
R:  -- these years.
L:  -- yeah, it does get stressful --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- by the time it's all over you've just glad and you want to get the decorations --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- down and out --
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  -- [SIGH] and just relax a little while and get it done with.
R:  Yeah, I know it, and I think y- you know, all through Christmas I think, "I've got to take these decorations down and repack them and restore them --"
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  "-- [LIPSMACK] in the basement room" and it's, like, [LIPSMACK] oh, there's the most horrible --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- job ahead of me, so [SIGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- yeah, I think that's part of it too.
L:  Yeah, [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- taking them down I think is worse than putting them up.  I mean, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- before Christmas, you know, the month before or whatever, when you decide to put 'em up --
R:  Mhm, oh, it's --
L:  -- you know, the stress --
R:  -- new, it --
L:  -- isn't really there. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it's new and exciting at that point, you know, you haven't done it for a year, so it's, [SIGH] you know, it's fresh, it's something different and you can get into it, but by the time it's over with, it's like, "Oh, I've had a whole month on this and [SIGH] --"
L:  Yeah, you've sick of it --
R:  "-- I don't want to --"
L:  -- and now you've got to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- touch 'em again [LAUGH] and --"
R:  [LAUGH] I know.
L:  "-- put 'em away". [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] I know, and make -- and [SIGH] then you have to get 'em packed back into that [LIPSMACK] um, box, [SIGH] and like, they never fit back.  Like, you took them out, you know? [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] This is true, this is true.
R:  [SIGH] Exactly.
L:  So --
R:  So --
L:  -- if you had to create one, what would you create?
R:  [SIGH] Oh, well --
L:  And I didn't have an answer for it this morning, so --
R:  Yeah, I don't --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- know.  I haven't -- I have really never, ever considered that.  There's so many holidays, I thought, "Mm, one more --"
L:  Yeah, it seems like --
R:  "-- what would I do --"
L:  -- there just would be --
R:  "-- with one more?"
L:  -- there's just one for everything almost.
R:  I know, I --
L:  Well, the guy this morning that I talked to in Georgia said if he had -- he would create singles day, because his holidays -- all -- all the holidays are basically for families --
R:  Families, yeah.
L:  -- but none just for single people. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  And I was like, "Hey, that's --"
R:  [SIGH] Well, that's a good --
L:  "-- pretty good one off the top of your head".
R:  Really, that's a good point, that would be a good point, and [SIGH] and I know [MN] -- I have a single daughter who's in her early thirties, and, um, [LIPSMACK] she does a lot of holidays and a lot of things like that [MN] from time to time with her circle of single friends.
L:  Mm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And so, I could see where that would -- that might work out.
L:  Yeah.  I just can't think of another holiday that I would want.  I would want th- the -- another legal holiday, I think September the eleventh should be [SIGH] a legal holiday, but as far as a celebrating holiday, [SIGH] I --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Y-
L:  -- just can't think. [SIGH] 
R:  I'd -- I could -- I'm [MN] with you.  I don't think an- and we've got so many th- and --
L:  But I think m- you know, as long as it's another day off work, what difference does it --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- make? [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I don't have to worry about that any more, so [LAUGH] --
L:  We'll create ten of them just to get the days off work, huh?
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  So, holidays to me are, you know, kinda like another day only [SIGH] you cook something different or whatever, but, [SIGH] um, yeah, it's, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, and sometimes I think people --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- you know, they have to celebrate absolutely everything, so [SIGH] -- and th- then you think about the consumer -- consumerization of everything, you know, it -- it just gets to the point where people drive themselves crazy --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- feeling that they have to celebrate --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- every little thing, and I think it creates, y- you know --
L:  More stress.
R:  -- so much added stress to people's already stressful lives.
L:  Yep. [SIGH] 
R:  So, I'm for leaving everything as they are. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, that works too. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  So --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- and we're --
L:  I don't know, are we supposed to stay online till it comes back on, or what?
R:  I -- like I say, I've --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- never done this before --
L:  [SIGH] Oh, that's right --
R:  -- so --
L:  -- okay.
R:  -- [SIGH] I've -- I assume that they'll let us know when it -- what do we have, fifteen minutes, or something like that --
L:  Oh, I don't know.
R:  -- to do this?
L:  The other two -- the both of the other ones that I did was about [LAUGH] five minutes, I mean, you can only talk about [SIGH] a subject --
R:  So many things --
L:  -- y-
R:  -- so long, yeah.
L:  Yeah, and then --
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Hm?
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I am in Ohio.
R:  In Ohio?  I'm in Iowa.
L:  Iowa?
R:  Yeah, and we're getting --
L:  I'm --
R:  -- snow --
L:  I'm --
R:  -- today too, so --
L:  I've been in Ohio about almost three years.  I'm from --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- California originally, so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Quite a weather change for me.
R:  [SIGH] I -- y- you've -- I guess --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- it is, definitely.  Oh, I've got a daughter in Santa Barbara, so, [SIGH] uh, where I'm --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- going next week to wait for the new baby, so --
L:  Oh. 
R:  -- [LAUGH] I'll get to --
L:  I just come -- I've was in [COUGH] San Francisco last summer -- this last s- summer, visiting my daughter. [COUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So --
R:  Yeah, so, [LIPSMACK] I'll get to enjoy some nice weather, it's been so cold here lately that --
L:  Well, bring some back this way. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I hope. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I hope, but [SIGH] it's, uh -- you know, and it's hard, holidays are hard when you've got family out of town --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] and so far away --
L: Yeah. 
R:  -- and, uh --
L:  It is, because I haven't -- since I've been here, I haven't been with any of my family --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- my -- my own family for a holiday, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, I always end up -- I know this last year was extremely hard, I was in a bad mood most of the time --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] like Christmas, so [SIGH] you know --
R:  Yeah, and it --
L:  -- it just [SIGH] --
R:  -- it -- [SIGH] and I say if we had one more holiday to celebrate, [SIGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that would be one more stress point, because --
L:  You wouldn't have --
R:  -- families are so --
L:  -- your family with you, huh? [LAUGH] 
R:  -- scattered any more --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- they're so totally scattered that, um, you know that just adds another stress to your life --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to be missing your family one more time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, [LIPSMACK] 
L:  [COUGH] I think we --
R:  So, that --
L:  -- don't need any more holidays.
R:  I -- yeah, is that --
L:  [LAUGH] Just free time off work is mine. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Do nothing day. 
R:  A hol- here we go, a holiday from holidays, an extra day off work, how's that?
L:  Yeah, that's good.
R:  [LAUGH] That would work.
L:  Yeah, just a --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- holiday to stay home from work.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Well, I think I told, um, the guy I was talking to this morning, you know, ditch day. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  D- ditch work day.
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH] That sounds good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so you just talk your employers into that one.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That would --
L:  Well, you know, they -- at the highschool, they got senior ditch day and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, all these other things, and [LAUGH] why not?
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly. [LAUGH] 
L:  Just 'cause you're an adult doesn't mean you can't do it.
R:  That's right.
L:  But, of course, then they'd say, "Why, you guys do it [LAUGH] anyway". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Which is true.
R:  That's true, yeah, the -- there's always the way when you have to --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- get a day away.  There's always a way to manage that.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  So [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh. [SIGH] 
R:  Anyway, but that's, um, [LAUGH] -- so this experience is totally new to me and [LIPSMACK] my husband got me involved in it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so [LAUGH] --
L:  So, you found it on one of the freebie boards or --
R:  [MN] I -- yes, I think that's where --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- he got it, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, he does a lot of that cruising through, he's --
L:  Yeah, I do too, I do it all day long.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All day long, [SIGH] so anything that's out there I pretty well run into it or --
R:  He --
L:  -- run across it.
R:  Exactly.
L:  But he got you into it instead of doing it himself, huh?
R:  [SIGH] Well, you know, he went on, and he was -- evidently they won't let you do two -- two members out of one family --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- because he had signed up and they had called him [SIGH] a time or two but -- [MN] and left a brief message but I think he was on the computer at the time --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- or some -- the phone was busy anyway.  Um, [SIGH] so then he signed me up and then things came in my name, so I don't know if they just switch from him to me now.
L:  Hm.
R:  So --
L:  But he didn't get called back, no?
R:  He did -- well, I guess -- I take that back, he did have one conversation.
L:  Mm.
R:  I can't remember now what they were talking about, but, uh, he did have one conversation.  I think it was about outdoor sports and things of that sort.
L:  Yeah, I did one day before yesterday, um, [SIGH] oh, what was that for? [SIGH] Oh, those, uh, reality shows on TV.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And the lady I talked to [LAUGH] she's just -- [SIGH] we d- neither one of us watched them and neither one of us liked them. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] So that made it short, then.
L:  [LAUGH] yeah, it was very short, so --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, there was nothing left to talk about, I've --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- only [MN] I've seen an ad [LIPSMACK] you know, [SIGH] in passing, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I don't even know what's [MN] even out there any more, [SIGH] --
R:  I --
L:  -- but some of them are just gross.
R:  Oh, they're idiotic.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You -- the -- I just can't --
L:  Some people will just do anything for a buck won't they? [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- I know it, and I don't watch them myself, you know, like you say, in commercials or just clicking through or something, but [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- it's like, I'll turn the TV off before I'll watch one of those things, I mean they're --
L:  Oh, yeah, well --
R:  -- just so insane.
L:  -- my husband watches them, so, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I -- I'll walk through the livingroom of something and [NOISE] [SIGH] and --
R:  And make fun of him?
L:  -- [SIGH] and one of them will be on there, and I'll catch a glimpse of somebody eating something really nasty.
R:  Yeah, oh. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] so --
R:  But there's got to be a better way of making a buck than --
L:  Yeah, you know, like --
R:  -- doing stuff like that.
L:  -- I said, anybody will do anything for a buck but, you know, that's going too far. [LAUGH] 
R:  Really, [LAUGH] that's for sure.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] So, well [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I don't know, um, [LIPSMACK] I guess if you hung up at five minutes before why --
L:  [SIGH] I don't know, you see, like I said, they didn't --
R:  -- and you got a c-
L:  -- they d- this didn't come with instructions, so --
R:  Uh-huh, You got to call back?
L:  I don't know.
