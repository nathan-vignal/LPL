L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My name is Anne.
L:  Hi, Anne.  My name is Maryanne.
R:  Maryanne.  Okay, this is the first call I've done so --
L:  Mine, too --
R:  Yeah, or --
L:  --so we're both in the same boat.
R:  Oh, good [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] What part of the country are you in?
R:  Uh, Michigan.
L:  Okay, I'm in Georgia.
R:  In Georgia.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  So, we're supposed to discuss, uh, what changes we've made in our lives since September eleventh.
R:  Yeah.  I think that and just at the beginning they said just to discuss September eleventh even, so I guess the biggest changes for us would just be appreciating what we have and -- and paying more attention to what's going on around us.
L:  Yeah, I'll agree with that.
R:  That's the biggie.
L:  [MN]
R:  Has -- [MN] how was it with your family?
L:  Um, it -- it -- [MN] my family I -- I'm -- they live in another part of the, you know, country so, um, it was just, you know, made me want to get in touch with them, make sure things were okay.  My father lives in New York city so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um [LAUGH] I was a little --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- concerned because he works in the Wall Street area but he happened to not be in the office that day.  Um, [MN] I-- I'm a little bit more aware of what, you know, how other countries perceive us, I guess, that the -- the negative way that they perceive us.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, us as in being Americans.  Um, but yeah, I -- I -- I agree with what you said.  I mean, I definitely do appreciate what I do have, um, when I see what, you know, obviously, a lot of people don't.
R:  Yeah, and I have to totally agree with you too on the aspect of seeing how other countries perceive us.  I had no idea how bad it was [LAUGH].
L:  No.  Nor did I, but, I mean, you know, uh, a lot of people say that.  I mean, we only get what we get from the news, you know, so I mean we're pretty, you know, sheltered I would thing unless we travel.
R:  I think so.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I was just reading somewhere.  I can't even remember if it was -- what country it was but they were talking about that couples didn't even dare go to the bars at night and this is supposed to be, you know, fairly friendly country because if you're just a couple alone, you'll get beat up.  You know?  It's like it's sad.
L:  Yeah, it is.  Um, I mean, a -- a lot of the other things that -- you know, I mean, I've learned a lot more about other cultures and things, um, in general, you know, from what's gone on.  Um, you know, I -- I've always -- I work in technology so I'm exposed to a lot of, you know, [MN] people that are not from, you know, the US or -- or here on a visa but I -- I never really realized, you know, how they lived or what they thought or, you know, um, how fanatic [LAUGH] they could be about the religion, some of them.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, and -- and we have that here too so I won't sit here and say that we don't but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it was -- it was a big eye opener, um, but, uh, were you -- uh, did you fly at all?  Like have you, I mean, did --
R:  Actually --
L:  -- you fly a lot before?
R:  Actually, no I have never been in a big plane so ...
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm in rural Michigan [LAUGH]. 
L:  Well, I -- 
R:  How about you?
L:  Um, I don't fly a lot but I fly, like, about two or three times a year and -- and I will say that, um, what's kinda ironic is is that I was at a high school reunion the week before September eleventh where I had to fly.  Um, so, I was kinda thinking, "Man, I'm -- you know, what if I had been on a plane then" because I really was.  I was traveling from Pennsylvania to Georgia.
R:  Oh.
L:  Exactly the week before [LAUGH].  Um, but, uh, I remember the first flight I took after September eleventh which was a while.  I think it was in February, um, of last year.  I was definitely very nervous.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, not so much as something was going to go wrong but I was really nervous because of how different it was to fly.  I mean, you were really searched and there were, you know, military people and stuff in the airports with guns and, you know, just things that I had never seen before, you know?
R:  Oh.
L:  It was definitely very different but, uh, once the plane took off, I felt fine [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I can just imagine the -- the stress.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, why you're there like you say with the guns and wondering, you know, not necessarily that there is gonna be a terrorist attack but what if somebody did some stupid [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I do.
R:  You know?
L:  Well, they definitely searched -- you know, I was surprised at like the things that they would take from your bags --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know what I mean?  I mean, things that they would consider a weapon.  You know, and how they would search people's things -- I mean, really search people's things.  I don't think I've ever experienced anything like that even in, like, customs, going into another country so it was definitely really different.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  But, you know, I mean here, at least where I mean, because I'm -- I'm -- I'm actually just outside of Metra[?] Atlanta so I'm -- I'm definitely in a big melting pot [LAUGH] as far as, you know, different people from different cultures, you know.  Um, people that have, you know, gotten citizenship from other coun- countries and people who are here like on work visas so, um, I thought before all it all happened, I thought I had a pretty good appreciation [LAUGH] for, you know, other people and their beliefs and what not but I think after September eleventh I realized how little I really did know, you know?
R:  Me, too.  And -- and sometimes I'll -- I'll get so into it that I end up still going on reality overload.  You know, just with -- even with Iraq and everything going on now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just like I feel like I didn't know nothing and I still feel like I don't know anything.
L:  Well, I don't think -- I -- I think that, you know, now they're, like, they should tell us everything and I -- I don't like to not be told things but I think that -- I think it's okay to pick and choose what you tell us.  I don't think we have to know everything, because I -- I -- and this is just building on what you said about information overload.  I mean, I feel like every time I turn on the news now, you know, somebody else hates us or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- making somebody else mad and we're gonna go to war with three different countries and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I just [MN] --
R:  And sometimes I think they tell us things that we shouldn't know, not necessarily because we, you know, it's -- if we hear it, then you know the enemy is hearing it.  The terrorists are hearing it.  You know --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- and there's just some things that they say that I don't think they should be saying.
L:  No, I -- I -- do you remember, um, back like when, um, it was like the Gulf War and, um, I remember this because somebody actually brought it up on like one of the talk radio things or something recently but, back when we had the Gulf War and how the media was following it so closely that they were actually tipping off, you know, Saddam Hussein as to what we were doing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I don't -- I kinda worry about that, too.  I mean, I think that, you know, they were saying, oh, um, well this was after September eleventh, you know, we should, you know, be worried about nuclear power plants and we should be worried about our water supplies and stuff.  I think it kinda gives them ideas, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  I do, I do too.  Before they end up cutting us off, because they cut us off in ten minutes, I want to ask you aren't by any chance a member of big, big savings, are you?
L:  Uh, no but I'm on another board.  Well, actually, I am a member there but I don't post a lot.
R:  Okay [LAUGH].
L:  Um, but I'm -- I'm on -- you know, I'm on all the deal boards.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, um, yeah, that's -- I mean I think we all got this little tip for this thing probably [LAUGH] from one of them.
R:  Probably but I was reading on there where some of them were catching up.  They were catching up, "Oh, it was you I talked to", so I just thought I'd ask --
L:  Oh, no.  This is my --
R:  -- ahead of time.
L:  -- first call.  I haven't talked to anybody but I am on big, big savings.  I post as Atlanta Gal but I probably only have, I don't know, maybe twenty posts.  
R:  Okay.  I'm --
L:  And --
R:  -- Nature[?] Girl.
L:  You're what?
R:  Nature Girl.
L:  Nature Girl.  Okay, well I'll look for it [LAUGH]--
R:  Okay, Atlanta Gal.
L:  -- and I'll make sure that I post but I'm usually, you know, in the freebies or in the first sale or trade and again, not a lot because, you know, it's just one of the many boards that I, you know, bore through --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- once a day just to see what's out there and what's going on.  But, yeah, that's funny, so -- so you've -- I haven't gone over there to read.  Where -- what -- what forum is it under?
R:  [MN] In referrals -- not referrals.  I think rewards programs, I think.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'll have to go look and read the set --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because that's interesting [LAUGH].
R:  It's bent[?] a little bit but it was just kinda comical --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, seeing people that caught up with each other.  There was, I think, two of 'em that actually made a match, "Oh, it was you" [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What's it to ya?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So ...
L:  Well, I wouldn't have even thought to ask it because I didn't know, you know, I mean I didn't know how widespread the advertisement for this participation was, you know.
R:  Yeah, I don't know either.
L:  But we're probably getting off topic.
R:  Yes.
L:  They're probably gonna listen to their tape and [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But no, I'll look -- I'll look for a post over there from you and post in it so then you'll know who I am.  But I'm usually on a board called Deal Expert.
R:  Oh, okay. I --
L:  And I spend a lot of time there but, you know, everybody has their one home and then they --
R:  Right.
L:  -- visit a bunch of the other ones --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to make sure they get it on something first, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, --
L:  Do they -- so, what -- they usually just cut us off when we've --
R:  Fr- from what I read after ten minutes, they will tell us we have to say our good-byes.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And then I think they ask us if we want to review it or leave a comment or something, from what I read.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, but, um, I think this is pretty cool that they're doing this.  Y- you know, just kinda interesting getting to talk to somebody like -- like you from Atlanta, what you thought on September eleventh.
L:  Oh, when it happened.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, what happened and -- and see what some of the views are, like you said you're from Atlanta and I'm in a real rural area.
L:  Oh, I was petrified because on our news they're saying, "Oh, CNN's a target" you know and we have the CBC and they're a target and they're gonna release all these diseases and I'm thinking, "Oh ...
