L:  Hi.  My name is, uh, Nester Figaro.  I live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
R:  Hello.  I'm Shannon Everhart.  I live in Amarillo, Texas.
L:  Oh, hi [LAUGH].  Uh, [NOISE] well I guess if we have to talk about nine eleven and, uh, to tell you the truth, it -- it's been kind of hard, uh, for me.  In the beginning I didn't think so, you know.  I thought it was business like usual and, uh, you know, and we have to be more careful [NOISE] but actually, uh, me and the family have decided to [NOISE], uh, care more about each other [NOISE].  Think about, uh, what we have and what we don't have and the people that are serving now and, uh, and the war in Afghanistan because we have friends in the war over there.  So, uh, those are some of the changes.  What about you?
R:  Well, I -- I agree with your change about caring about your family more, knowing what's -- you know, it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what important.  What's there for you --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when you come home during the day.
L:  [NOISE].
R:  You know, I mean if that was taken away from you like it was so many people --
L:  Correct.
R:  -- how would you deal with that?
L:  Yeah, and -- and -- and it makes you think about, you know, the children that you're raising and what kind of world they're gonna grow into.
R:  Yeah, --
L:  So --
R:  -- exactly.
L:  -- yeah.
R:  Are they gonna -- sad to say, are we gonna be here in the next few years?
L:  Right.  Correct.  Yeah, it -- it -- it's very difficult and I think that life in general has changed for a lot of people and, you know, even though, uh, we're like three years after the fact now, going in for three years, uh, I think a lot of people still in the back of their mind's window, you know, they can go and, uh, watch the Superbowl or, you know, go and to do different things like that but I think still the security it's, um, one of the uppermost things in their minds.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I know a lot of people -- like shortly after wasn't there like a big sporting event?  Yeah, the -- what was it?
L:  Um --
R:  Baseball, wasn't it, that got canceled for a while?
L:  Right.  Correct.
R:  It was the s- uh, World Series.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, I mean, pe- I don't know, I mean, right now I'm not afraid to go, you know, what I mean but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it was something to think about and I guess it's -- it probably still is but it's not top of your priority list.
L:  Right.  No, --
R:  You're thinking, "I want to go do this sporting event".
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, and my family and my wife doesn't want to travel, and I said, "Well, you know, I think things are --"
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- a little more easier now and better but sometimes she's kind of pessimist and says, "Well, you know, if we're gonna take the little one to, uh, Disneyworld, what if someone attacked there".  That should be -- she thinks that that would be a prime target --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- so we're -- you know, you have to look behind and -- and -- and think twice of where you wanna go [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I watch mysel- I do see myself watching CNN a lot more.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The news channels.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, yeah and, uh, trying to find out more about, uh, military things and what's gonna happen.
R:  Yeah, exactly what's going on.
L:  You know, and it -- and it sometimes kind of scary because, uh, I was telling somebody else that, um, with fighting in Afghanistan and maybe Iraq, it's gonna be difficult and I don't think it's gonna be as easy as they -- they're talking that it's going be so I don't know.
R:  I don't -- I don't know about that either.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  It's gonna be real hard [LAUGH] --
L:  I know.
R:  -- especially with all these people being deployed right now.
L:  Correct.  We have a, uh, lot of friends being deployed here in Milwaukee and, uh, that's a concern to families and their jobs and what's gonna happen, you know.  A lot -- a lot of people are very optimistic because of the war ten years ago, or twelve years ago but twelve years ago and now is totally different, I believe, so I don't know.  It's gonna be something to watch in the next few days --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- weeks.
R:  The rest of our lives.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's true.
R:  Sad to say.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Um, no I don't know how you -- you watch things and --
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  When -- when you watch things, uh, you gotta be careful and over here there has been people who attack people from the Middle East and who might not even be, uh, Afghans or whatever, [LAUGH] whatever those guys were.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, so you know, we're -- we're watching, we're watching and even though we think, you know, I don't think Milwaukee's gonna be a big target unless they drink beer.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I heard something in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Houston that they had some church arson and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some synagogues or something attacked --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and they think it's something to do --
L:  Yeah, the Milwaukee Mosque.  They, uh, they shot at it and they called -- they called a school and -- and threaten 'em and what they're going to do to the kids and it's not a good thing.
R:  No.
L:  It's really not a good thing.
R:  No, and they're not gonna tell us everything.  They're gonna just tell us what they think we need to hear.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  I mean --
L:  That's the fear [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Exac- I think that's what does bring out the fear, cause we don't know everything.
L:  Right, and, uh, you never know what they're hiding so that there's not, uh, people, uh, [LAUGH] running around or running away or creating more problems.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, that's sad to say but I mean, we don't know everything that's happening.
L:  Right, and -- and you know, I -- I think that votes for the President seems to be very confident that he's going to win this, that there's so many people now against the war that I don't know, I don't know what's gonna happen.  I think that the, uh -- if, uh [NOISE] the status, uh, of people being for the war, it hasn't changed a lot [NOISE] in the last few days.  I don't know.  We -- we come from a family of, uh, of l- liberals.  Not me but, uh, [LAUGH] I come from a family of liberals and they are, um, very much opposed to the war and I don't know.  I -- I think diplomacy is the best thing.  Uh --
R:  It's -- it's scary.  The thought of war --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is scary.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But if it's something we have to do then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, they're gonna do it regardless, I think, in my opinion.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Uh, I don't know nine eleven [MN] will always be in my mind, the fact that my birthday is nine twelve.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] It's, uh, it's always a big reminder and I didn't feel like, uh, doing anything last year when it happened and, um, this year it was like, "No, better not" [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  It was -- yeah, that is tough.
L:  Well, so -- yeah, people get depressed and stuff and --
R:  Do you fly?
L:  I'm sorry?  Oh, I used to.
R:  Do you not fly -- I mean, like after nine eleven, you don't fly anymore?
L:  Uh, nope.  I haven't.  Uh, we usually went to Puerto Rico or California for visits and I can't get my family to go on a -- on a trip anywhere.
R:  [LAUGH] I don't blame 'em really.  I mean, I wasn't a big flyer before it, you know.  I was -- I'd gone maybe once on an airplane because I didn't like 'em before but now I really don't care for them.
L:  Right.  Oh, and I [MN] -- always when -- when you get older you start thinking more about your mortality and, uh --
R:  Yeah, we've got children to think of too.
L:  Right, right.
R:  It's not just you anymore, it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what's better for everybody.
L:  Correct.  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  Uh, I think -- I think it's going to be with us forever, nine eleven and the aftershocks of everything that happened.  They'll always be with us.  Now, I think that -- that's my opinion of it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's gonna be in the history books that's for sure.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  We can just pray that it doesn't happen again.
L:  Right, or, you know -- you know, and -- a- people think the worst case scenario.  I'm kind of a worrier ...
