L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  I'm Kim --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- Kim Reverend.
R:  I'm Irene.
L:  Hi.  How are you? [LAUGH]
R:  I'm fine.  How are you to doing?
L:  Okay.
R:  So, what's your favorite holiday?
L:  Oh, Christmas [LAUGH].
R:  Of course [LAUGH]
L:  I'd have to say Christmas, of course.
R:  Of course, of course.  Right? [LAUGH].
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  Any particular reason why?
L:  Um, I don't know.  I just -- I actually enjoy going out and shopping and wrapping the presents and all that kind of stuff so ...
R:  Well, I work in retail so you can imagine what Christmas was like for me.
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  Part time, you know,  job and it's, like, [MN] it's about -- well, actually for us it starts early 'cause, you know, September they're starting to put the trees out or something and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you've got to get -- get motivated in there but, you know, it's just like I love sales.
L:  Right, me too.
R:  So, it's like, you know, the -- after Thanksgiving my nieces, they laugh at me.  They think it's hysterical what I do because when they were little they used to get up, um -- you know, like I would -- we get up like and do the early sales or whatever.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, you know, that -- one year they slept in the car to make sure they didn't get left.
L:  Okay.  Fine.
R:  Because they're into the same thing, and you know every year they call me, "What, you got your papers out. [LAUGH] You -- you ready?" [LAUGH].
L:  Right [LAUGH].  I do the same thing [LAUGH].
R:  I know [LAUGH] --
L:  I have to find the best --
R:  --  and he's like "What"
L:  --  bargain I can find so [LAUGH].
R:  Yes.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  it's -- it's like this is -- I just [several inaudible words] "Why do you do that?"  I said, "It's the thrill of the hunt".
L:  Right.  I have all the coupons  --
R:  You know.
L:   -- and [LAUGH] ready to go at --
R:  Oh, so you sound like me --
L:  Oh, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  -- sound like me [LAUGH].
L:  I always have a purseful of coupons ready to go [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  Yeah, I get the sale ads lined up, you know --
L:  Yeah
R:  -- and it's like, "Okay, now who's got what on sale.  Okay, and if we do this and let's see, okay you go that way and I'll go this way and we'll meet here" and you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's -- it's, you know.
L:  I know [LAUGH].
R:  And this is like yeah, 'cause it's like, "Okay, Thanksgiving's here, okay, it's time to go, you know".
L:  Right [MN].
R:  So, but as far as creating a holiday, I'm thinking I can't come up with one to save myself, you know, it's like --
L:  I couldn't either.  I was like I have no idea.  We have enough I guess [LAUGH] I don't know.
R:  You know, and that's what I'm thinking 'cause like, you know, where I work we get these oddball hol- I mean, we get Martin Luther King Day, we get President's Day --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we get, you know, Memorial Day.  The only thing, I guess, we don't get is Good Friday.
L:  Yeah, but we used to have that off.  We don't get that anymore, and they actually took President's Day away from us, too [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, really.
L:  And gave us -- well, they actually -- they, um, gave us a long Memorial Day and Labor Day weekend.  We have Friday and Monday off for both holidays but it's nice.
R:  Wow.
L:  But then --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- you have to go from New Year's Day to Memorial Day without a vacation [LAUGH] so --
R:  Oh, so you --
L:  -- that's kind of like -- 
R:  -- so else you'll have to take a -- a -- hol- a vacation day or something.
L:  Right.  Yeah, five months is a long time without a vacation day so [LAUGH] but it's nice when -- when they come so you get that long weekend so -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I know.  It's-- it's -- it's like -- and fortunately for me like where I work we -- I -- we have flexitime[?] so you get like every other Friday off.
L:  Oh, I have every Friday off so we've [several inaudible words] --
R:  Oh, really.
L:   -- yes.
R:  Well, see -- see mine rolls into like the week -- the holiday weekend which is really nice.
L:  Right, that's nice.
R:  So, it's like yeah but no, I -- I guess that I really enjoy -- you know, Christmas, I guess, you know, is like seeing the lights out --
L:  Right.
R:  -- 'cause usually we go out and, you know, the city -- they do have these couple of places that are really big like one of the colleges here like does a big light show and then, of course, neighborhoods and --
L:  Right.  I like doing that too.
R:  -- and so, you know, and then, um, in this other town that's about probably thirty minutes, they, um, it's like where we have the Azalea Festival, well in the Christmas time they light it up.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And they do all the -- uh, you know -- that's just like, "Wow" you know, so we just -- usually get a big group of people [NOISE] um, together to go out and, you know, just look at the lights, you know, and just make it -- you know, big eating out.  Maybe some of them like to eat, go out or else go out to look at the lights and then come back and eat and talk.  You know, just --
L:  Right.  That's nice.  Yeah.
R:  You know, but it's funny.  I -- I -- well, I guess with working in retail too it's funny to just sit there and see people who, um, you know, like the men.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  My fri- my boyfriend went out Christmas Eve and shopped and like, "Thank you".
R:  Okay, okay, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  And then he tells me -- then he tells me "Well, what I bought you is not really what I wanted to buy you but it's all they had --"
R:  [MN]
L:  -- left so [LAUGH] so you can exchange it after a couple of weeks when they restock".  I'm like, "Well, that's nice, isn't it?"
R:  Oh, well, gee, thank you very much.  I appreciate the --
L:  Yeah, like you had how long to shop for it, you know, [LAUGH] you waited until --
R:  It's like men.  If you -- if you made my life any more happier, I'd be -- I just wouldn't know what to do with myself, right?
L:  Right, so ...
R:  That is -- that is wild but --.
L:  [MN]
R:  -- yeah, it's funny to see the man -- and see in here this year it, um, [COUGH] you know, we had a big storm --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- a big snowstorm so that really, you know, put a damper on the, um, the shopping experience --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because, you know, a lot of the people that day just, you know, [inaudible] from the mall until like Christmas Eve.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, everybody's out like "I gotta get this done, I gotta get this done".
L:  Right, yeah [LAUGH].  Yeah, actually we had snow Christmas and it -- everybody got -- ended up staying at home all day so everybody's Christmas plans were changed so it was like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the weekend came along and everybody had Christmas on the weekend because nobody could get to anybody's houses so --
R:  I know [LAUGH].
L:  -- you know. [LAUGH].
R:  But it was -- 'cause I, you know, -- 'cause -- well, I went to work, you know.  One of those stupid people that was -- well, I went to work you know [NOISE].  The store didn't close so, you know, what can you do?
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  And, you know, but it's just like I guess 'cause I get home -- 'cause, you know, with the timing of the sun goes down, it was also kinda neat because the time I get off work there's a lot of places that are lit up.
L:  Yeah, that's neat.  Yeah.
R:  On the way from the mall.
L:  Right.
R:  But I guess the only disadvantage from being in the mall, you know, like I said our store, they put Christmas stuff outside in September.  You know, by the time Christmas gets here sometimes you're kinda like, "Okay".
L:  I know.  Why can't they at least wait until after Halloween before they put the --
R:  You know --
L:  -- decorations up and like --
R:  [several inaudible words] you know, you know, the Halloween twisters are right next to the turtlenecks for Christmas --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- and you're going "You know, you --"
L:  Yeah, right.  My gosh --
R:  -- guys are pushing this just a tad bit too much --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I'm thinking, "Okay, next time we're gonna try having Christmas in July".
L:   Right, yeah.  I know we should do that. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm just like --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but I know I go out and this is something -- like this year I was so proud of my -- well, my niece made me.  She said, "You cannot buy any more Christmas ornaments".  She said, "You don't even put the tree up".
L:  Right.  Oh, jeeze [LAUGH].
R:  And I don't because from working in retail because I'm there so much --
L:  Right.
R:  -- who wants to look at another tree?  
L:  Right.
R:  But I keep thinking, "You know, one of these days that tree's coming up and I need all these ornaments" and she goes out to the garage and she's like "Okay, what's in this box and this box and see here this whole bag of you know" and I'm thinking, "Well, I didn't ask you all that", you know.
L:  Right.
R:  "Stay out of my --"  So, yeah, it's -- it's -- it's funny to --
L:  Yeah, I just -- I just pulled out boxes that I'd had over the years from the attic and like, "Boy, do I have a lot of Christmas stuff".  I'm like, "I could decorate three trees".  You know, [LAUGH] like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- "I've gotta stop buying, I can't buy anything else" [LAUGH] so, it's like ...  So, I don't really tell myself I had but [LAUGH] --
R:  I know.  That's how I am.  I'm like, "Hey, --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- you know, but okay, you -- you just got way too much, girlie, girl, you know"
L:  Right [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  Oh.
R:  I get too much more and I just don't know what I'm gonna do and it's like --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- so I don't know.  Yeah.  It's like, you say these holidays but now it gets to a point, you know, they just run together.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You now, it's just like sh- you know, by the time you get through Christmas -- but then like this year, like you say with the weather and stuff, it's, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it just  kinda threw everybody so everything ran together.
L:  Right, yes.  Yeah.  I know.
R:  So--
L:  I was even -- I was even away.  We went away like two weeks before Christmas.  Like I can't do that again because it just like made the holiday go even faster in a way [LAUGH].  Felt like I missed out on things 'cause I wasn't home but you know [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, I mean and --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- I think that's what it is is that everybody just kinda like, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, it's a break you know, cause we do ours and then like I said, I work in retail and it's like a day after.  Fortunately I didn't have to work the day after the holidays so I was able to go in and, you know, just cruise the after sales, you know, 'cause [LAUGH]
L:  Right, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Ah.
R:  And I think that's what a lot of people ended up doing.  They ended up having to shop after --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the holidays --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it -- it makes for an interesting time, I tell you that much.
L:  Right, [LAUGH] yeah.  Ah.  I'm just trying to think of any holidays that aren't made up already.  I think Hallmark's got a -- a card for every occasion [LAUGH].
R:  You know what I'm th- you know and --
L:  Like there's Boss's Days --
R:  -- they have like -- they have --
L:  Secretary's Day --
R:  -- they have sweater's[?] -- something like sweater's day.  
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  I'm like "What the heck is a sweater's day?" you know --
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  -- things like that and I'm going, "Okay".
L:  Yeah.  I was just trying to think of like Hallmark's got every occasion you can imagine [LAUGH] like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- days you'd never think was a day unless they have a holiday for it [LAUGH] so I don't know.
R:  Yeah, I know, and I'm just going like, "Okay" --
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  -- we've -- we've discovered one.  Okay.
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  We've -- we've got that one down and -- [MN]
L:  Right.  Well --
R:  And it's -- it's really funny and crazy, you know, and it's like, you know, like you say they have holidays, I have that booklet that shows all the holidays --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's like, "Okay. --"
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  -- Okay, you know".  It's like "Oh".  I don't know but I just think so -- but then some of the holidays like where I used to work -- I used to work in, um, um, an oil company and I mean we got, I mean there was like banker's type --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You know, we'd get like Columbus Day.  
L:  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah, right.
R:  You know, but then we would get holidays like Veterans Day and then depend on whether or not it was an election year --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's, um, you know, if it was an election year then it was kinda like, um, well we got that --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- again.
L:  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah, I know.  It's like I work for a pharmaceutical company and -- but in the United States we get the least amount of days off because there's like over in Europe and France they get all --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like the Catholic days, all this.  I'm like, "Why can't we have this day off?"  Like we're all the same company [LAUGH] it's like -- but they have all kinds of extra holidays too [LAUGH] so I don't know but ...
R:  Uh, you know and that's what I was looking at because I know -- my friend and I used to work in the rental car industry.  You know, it's like mandatory.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And when my brother was in the military I used to visit him --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and he would -- you know, they would get -- and they're -- the people over there would -- if they told you they worked in the military base, they get the military holidays, you know, the America holidays --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- then they get their own and I'm just like --
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  -- "Okay".
L:  Yeah.  Oh, boy.
R:  So, yeah, it's funny that, you know, with that and it's like, "Oh, okay".
L:  Right.
R:  You know, it's like --  I mean, my brother was like ...
