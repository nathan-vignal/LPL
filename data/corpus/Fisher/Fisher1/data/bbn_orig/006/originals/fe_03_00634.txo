R:  Shirley.
L:  Lynn.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  Are we supposed to discuss this?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] Okay.  Um, [NOISE] well, for a life partner I'd like -- I -- I think having similar experiences is helpful.
R:  Okay.  I think honesty is the number one priority.
L:  [MN] Yeah, honesty and faithfulness.
R:  Yeah.  Well, the -- I've been married for thirty four years so I've -- honesty, being totally honest and ev- about everything has worked real well for us.
L:  I'm just going through a really hideous divorce --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and my husband left me and the kids for another woman.
R:  Uh-oh.  So, there's the faith- [LAUGH] faithfulness. 
L:  Uh, yes.
R:  Well, oh.
L:  And I think you also have to be s- selfless because, um, he said, "If everybody -- if he's happy, everybody will be happy".
R:  Oh, one of those.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] extraordinarily selfish human being.
R:  That's what it sounds like.
L:  Uh-huh, and when -- I think you have to have a real strength of character.  When you make commitments, that you follow through.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  Like I said, we've been married thirty four years and my husband thinks of everybody else before himself.  He always has, so it works real good.
L:  Yes, that's -- that is important.  I know I -- I did the same [LAUGH] but what a big mistake for me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How long were you married?
L:  Oh, sixteen years.
R:  Oh, a long time.
L:  Yes, and he said we had a good run.
R:  A good run.
L:  Yes, it was a good run.
R:  Did you have kids?
L:  Yes.
R:  How many?
L:  Two.
R:  And he walked out on them too, I guess.
L:  Pretty much.  Pretty much.  I mean, he sees them every other weekend but --
R:  How old are they?
L:  Daughter sixteen, son twelve.
R:  Uh, almost a teenager and teenagers are rough, too, to deal with at any time with something like this.  I'm sure it's really hard.
L:  No, it's been going on for over two years now and, um, in the family -- [MN] children need their fathers regardless of what they think.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh --
R:  Well then one of the assets to a life partner would be commitment to children too.  If you plan to have --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- children, they better be committed to 'em.
L:  That's -- that's right.
R:  Better be committed.
L:  Yeah.  Well, commitment is -- it's probably -- the honesty and commitment and then faithfulness which I suppose if you've got commitment, you would be faithful.
R:  Mhm.  I think so.
L:  And, um, a certain amount of maturity.
R:  [LAUGH] He wasn't, I guess.
L:  [LAUGH] You know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- most --
R:  I know it's not funny, Lynn, but -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] No, actually I mean it's -- it's better to laugh at it than what I've been going through.  Um, [MN] I -- I guess I grew up always being the very responsible one in the family, extraordinarily responsible --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, uh, so it was good to have someone that was different than that.  I mean, he really knew how to have fun and, um --
R:  Does that make him a good life partner?
L:  Well, actually it -- it worked [MN] up until he decided somebody would be more fun than me.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, it worked -- it worked well because he would make the plans and then I would, um, follow through and make sure everything happened and while that I don't think is necessarily a life partner, it should made life, um, flow smooth.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, uh, having the same values.
R:  Yeah, that's real important.  That's real important.
L:  Mhm.  Yes, and I have to say --
R:  I guess you both -- when you got married, you both wanted kids, you both wanted the two kids and all.  That wasn't a problem.
L:  Oh, I -- we had discussed it and I thought it was okay.  I got pregnant [LAUGH] then all of a sudden it became, uh-uh, not okay.
R:  So, he didn't -- what did he do?  Decide he didn't want to be a father and husband?
L:  After I got -- yeah, initially but the number two one was planned.  So ...
R:  Yeah, you have to agree on that one too [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, no.  Absolutely.  Um, no, you do and if one partner says they don't want children, then you don't have them because --
R:  Mm.  Or else you don't get married to start with.
L:  No, or you go find -- or you end the marriage there and then and start over.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Because then you're at cross purposes.
R:  Okay, it all comes back to the honesty.  If you're honest about everything, then you know right up front what you're getting into --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what you want, what your plans are.  You know if -- if you are honest with one another, you don't say, "Well, yeah, I want kids" and you say that just so you can get married --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then later, "Well, no.  I really didn't want kids".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What do I hear in the background?
L:  Oh, these cockatoos.
R:  Oh, birds.  Okay.
L:  Mhm.  Yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  I got them -- I was given them for Mother's Day.
R:  By?
L:  By my children [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  They, um, they found -- and my daughter organized -- she -- she found them.  She got them for free, basically.  But they're gonna have to go.
R:  [LAUGH] I'm not a bird person so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I have to sell my beautiful home and God only knows where -- what kind of hovel we'll be moving into.
R:  Oh, I am so glad I have the husband I have.  I -- I -- when I picked, I picked good.  Like I said, we've been married thirty four years.  We just bought our home a year ago.  We've been in it, uh, fourteen months.  This is not our first home but this is -- this is the best one we've had so -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's wonderful.
R:  Yes, we've --
L:  Yeah, it's -- um, I was just thinking, sharing is -- because I know that things started to go -- to be wrong when, um, he was working such long hours and not sharing, um, his life with us.
R:  Now, how was he working long hours and fitting another woman into the picture?
L:  Met her at work.
R:  Oh.
L:  And since -- then he was in a different company.
R:  My husband's a driller on an oil rig so he doesn't meet woman at work so that's -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I think there's very few.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Although I did meet a woman that was a cook out on one of those oil rigs.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I did meet a woman that was a cook out there.
R:  Well --
L:  But she said everybody was --
R:  -- not very many women [LAUGH].
L:  No.  She said that at the end of the day, you're so tired that nobody looked attractive.
R:  Yeah, I don't care.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Don't care. 
L:  But, uh --
R:  Well, I bet you're not very big on any kind of life partner right now then, are you [LAUGH]?
L:  No, you know, I -- I just look and I -- I see that I made a big mistake and, um, that I knew this wasn't right after we'd been married a year and when I got pregnant.
R:  A year?
L:  Yeah.  Oh, I was --
R:  And you stayed with him for fifteen more.
L:  Yeah.  I, uh -- he begged me not to leave him [NOISE] but, um --
R:  Should have gone with your instincts.
L:  Should have gone with my instincts.  I would have been better off.  Yeah, because --
R:  See I'm -- I'm so glad that I don't -- I'm so glad that I don't have to say that, that I would have been better off to have done this or this or this because I know all along the way I made the right choices.  I have a husband I love dearly, we have eight children, eight grandchildren --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- three grandchildren on the way so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it's been a -- it's been -- my life partner turned out number one okay [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, my parents were married until my mother died and so they were married probably forty eight years, and my ex husband's parents were married fifty two, fifty -- or fifty three years.
R:  Oh, he -- he is an ex now.
L:  Oh, yeah.  It's -- this is California and believe me the divorce laws --
R:  Oh, I'm in Oklahoma so ...
L:  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Here you can get -- you can get a div- -- the marriage can be ended and you will be legally divorced but your divorce isn't over because the property settlement isn't handled yet [NOISE].
R:  In what length of time?
L:  Six months.
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  And this is not good, let me tell you, because after he got that, then he had no incentive to settle.  But that's -- that's away from the subject.  Um, no, I see what mistakes I made by not, or one, not leaving and [LAUGH] but I had a -- a child on the way and, um --
R:  And then you had a second one.
L:  Well, the second one -- everything seemed to go really well after that.
R:  Oh, you were okay during that time.
