L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.

R:  Hi.
L:  [LAUGH] My name's Cartier[?].  What's your name?
R:  Vicky.

L:  Oh, Vicky.
R:  Yes, ma'am.
L:  Oh, okay.  Nice to meet you, Vicky.
R:  You too, hon.
L:  Um, if you don't mind me asking, what -- where are you?  Where do you --
R:  In Oklahoma.
L:  Oklahoma.  Wow.
R:  Where -- where are you?
L:  California.
R:  Wow [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.  Last time I talked to somebody in New York.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, this would have been a good topic for them.
R:  Yeah, so maybe that's why they -- well, they didn't do New York.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That could be, you know. It is --
L:  Maybe it's too sensitive.
R:  -- a weird topic, though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It is.  It's pretty touchy.
L:  How did you hear about this whole testing thing?
R:  Oh, through the computer.
L:  Through -- through -- I mean, you got an email from someone.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Did you?
L:  Yeah, I got -- I was, um -- I was a linguistic student at the University of California at Berkley --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so I got an email from them and they told me about it so that's how I heard about it.
R:  Wow.  I just got a spam email.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, how weird.
R:  Well, because I do all surveys anyway.
L:  Okay.
R:  Maybe that's why I probably got it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I do do a lot of surveys.
L:  Okay.
R:  A lot.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]
R:  Any- anything for a buck, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.  I totally agree.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  May I ask how old you are?
L:  Um, I'm twenty four.
R:  Wow.  I'm forty four.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  They always give me these young people.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  All right.
L:  You know, me and my niece are twenty year difference so I'm always like, "When I'm twenty -- when she's twenty four, I'm gonna be forty four" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I always thought, "We could still relate to each other --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- at that age" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Wow [LAUGH].
L:  But I don't know [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Always getting young people, yah.
L:  [MN] Um, my -- this is not on topic but my -- my music teacher's from Oklahoma [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Yeah, so I don't know.
R:  It's pretty dull here.
L:  And she's actually forty four too so, you know.
R:  Wow.
L:  I just picture her face and your voice or something [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, really.
L:  I don't know.
R:  God [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Heavens.
L:  [MN]
R:  We don't all talk -- well talk like this.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I swear where we don't [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, how do you think that September eleventh has changed your life?
R:  Has changed my life.  Hm.  You know, I look at people like, uh, you know, the -- the people with darker skin, not -- not black people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but them people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- really I -- when I look at 'em, I look at 'em.
L:  Like middle eastern people.
R:  Yes.  You know, I really look.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes.  I don't really --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- walk -- like when I go downtown --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'll -- I'll go way around 'em [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know that's -- I know that's horrible --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I -- and I know it's not everybody's fault --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's not their fault but part of me just can't help it.  Did you lose anybody then?
L:  No.
R:  I have.  I -- I -- I lost six different people.
L:  [MN] You did?
R:  So, it has changed my life tremendously.
L:  Well, see you were very connected.
R:  Huh?
L:  You were connected to that.
R:  Yes, I -- yes, I am con- I feel like I was, yes.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And it was pretty -- most of 'em were -- were friends though --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- mm, but [MN] it was -- it was too horrible [LAUGH].
L:  Wow.
R:  It was too horrible, really horrible, yeah.
L:  I feel so disconnected to the whole September eleventh thing that I don't think anything -- is the only thing that has changed is, um, uh, when I went to the airport they took away my cuticle cutters and I was really upset [LAUGH].
R:  Ni, night.
L:  You know, I mean the airport security --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Now, that is weird.
L:  -- was ridiculous.
R:  I haven't flown since.
L:  [MN].
R:  I haven't flown at all.  I don't think you could get me too yet.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's another thing.  I don't think I could fly.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, how was your -- what was your flying experience like before that?  Were you always a little scared to fly or ...?
R:  No, not really.
L:  No?
R:  No.
L:  Hm.
R:  I'd just -- yeah, I'm really leery.  I won't even go inside the airport at all.
L:  Hm.
R:  [LAUGH] I know that sort of sounds stupid but I just --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- can't do it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I can't do it [LAUGH].
L:  Well, oh, well.  To each his own, right?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I remember -- I remember when, um, okay there's September eleventh and then I had a class in summer school.  Anyway, I was going to China and I was telling one of my friends, "I'm going to China and, you know, it's a fifteen hour flight and --"
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, it's really nerve wracking" and --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he said to me, and this is another really bad comment, he said, "You know, if you see anyone with a turban on, or anything like that" he said, " You just yell or run or whatever" [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  And then he's like, "You know what you're probably gonna get slapped with a little law suit but you probably shouldn't do that".
R:  Yes.
L:  And then he's like, "Well, come to think of it, I think I'm gonna start wearing a turban --"
R:  [MN]
L:  "-- so I can start suing people" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, God.
L:  [LAUGH] Really bad joke.
R:  It's okay.
L:  Really bad joke.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, you know, it made us laugh so ...
R:  Yeah, that's all that matters and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- we need to make light everywhere.  I think so now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now.  We need to try to get over it.  Well, I'm -- well, I'm trying hard.
L:  Yeah, and I -- I don't -- I still don't have a problem with middle eastern people or looking at 'em or ...
R:  Well, it --
L:  I remember during the Gulf War and I was younger.  I was, like, in junior high [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, um, I did.
R:  So was my daughter [LAUGH].
L:  What was that?
R:  I said, "So was my daughter".
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Because she's twenty six.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].  So, I remember.
L:  So, I remember back then when I was little, I wouldn't look at them and you know.  I mean, I'm in the San Francisco area so I mean there's a lot of cultures out here.
R:  Oh, yeah.  My uncle lives there.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He lives in San Francisco?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  He does.
L:  So, I mean there's everything up here and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you just get used to it and --
R:  I would think so, yeah.  You should get used to something but I'm right -- right in the middle of the bible belt, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, they barely let us go have casinos.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  You know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we have dry counties still.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, this -- it's pretty ridiculous.
L:  [MN] You mean there's no alcohol in some parts?
R:  In parts.  Uh-huh.
L:  Is that what you said?
R:  Yes.
L:  [MN] Really?
R:  Yes.  There's dry counties.
L:  Oh my goodness.  I've never even heard of that [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Now, you have, honey.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] You learned something today, hey?
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  In Oklahoma?
R:  Uh, yes.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And they have it in Min- in Arkansas too.  See our beer -- well, we sell beer but it's only like -- like three point beer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, Texas and Kansas sell six point beer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's like if you live close to the border either way they're just like -- everybody from Oklahoma goes there to get beer [LAUGH].
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Party, all right.  Let's -- well, let's all go to Kansas.
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Are you close to a border?
R:  Well, I live in Tulsa.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, we're closer to, uh, Kansas than we are to Texas.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's only a four hour drive to Dallas.
L:  Where's, um -- it's a four hour drive to Dallas?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Where's, um, Okla- OU, Oklahoma.
R:  It's in Stillwater.
L:  Is that close to you?
R:  It's not very far, no.
L:  Okay.
R:  Not far.  It's a little bit.  But, you know, it's about an hour maybe.
L:  Do -- do most of the kids go there?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, okay.  Like does your daughter go there or ...?
R:  No, she didn't go there.
L:  She didn't.
R:  No, she went to -- she went to a city college here.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I started a city college too [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I couldn't get her to go anywhere.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah, she still lives here or with -- well, well with me.
L:  How are the -- the jobs out there?  How's the --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- employment?
R:  Sucks.
L:  It sucks.
R:  Yeah, but -- yeah, it's pretty bad.
L:  I know.  Same thing over here.
R:  It is -- I guess it's pretty bad everywhere.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  But, um, what are -- what like -- you know, do you just do surveys and --
R:  I do everything.  I do a lot of 'em on the computer or --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a lot on the phone and, uh, I -- I get 'em by mail.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, just whatever.
L:  So, does -- is this a pretty good deal?  This phone call.
R:  I don't know.  This is only the second time I've done this.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think you gotta do it three times to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- get paid.
L:  Yeah, and then you only get to do it three times.
R:  Oh, it is only three times?
L:  That's what my friend told me.
R:  Well, I'm just have to sign up under my other name, man.
L:  Exactly [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, and you're -- oh, and they're recording this.  Oh, God.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] My [inaudible] gone now [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] It's okay.  Your daughter's gonna sign up, right?
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  They say, "Sure" [LAUGH].  Yeah, I know [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Sh- shame on me [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Okay, we strayed off the topic.
R:  Oh, well, so.
L:  Oh, we talked -- I think I said everything I needed to say --
R:  Everybody does.
L:  -- on that.
R:  Everybody does.  I'm sure they do.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe that's the point.  Maybe that's the point of this research.
R:  Yeah.  Get -- have everybody get to know ever- where everybody else.
L:  Right.

R:  You know so ...
