L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi [LAUGH].
R:  Hi.  This is Bill.
L:  Hi.  My name is Mary.
R:  How are ya?
L:  I'm fine.  How are you?
R:  Good.
L:  Have you done one of these before?
R:  No.
L:  No.  Me neither [LAUGH].
R:  This is the first time [MN].
L:  Okay.  I -- I guess I'm not really quite sure what were supposed to do here.
R:  Uh, neither am I really.
L:  Um, I -- I'm understanding that we're sup- are we -- now, the topic is life partners?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And we're supposed to have, like, a ten minute conversation on that subject.  [LAUGH] Is that right?
R:  I guess so.  I guess that's --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- how it works.  The -- the introduction said what the most important thing was about a life partner or something like that.
L:  Yeah.  Okay, um, to me it's [MN] wow, it's -- it's love first of all and compatibility and, um, I -- you know, I'm married and I have children and --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm. 
L:  -- it -- I picked somebody that I felt would be an overall family person, um, including children, the whole thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, not just -- not just one on one, just the whole, you know -- do you know what I'm saying?
R:  Yeah, I know exactly what you're saying.  Trust is real important to me too.
L:  Trust is real important.
R:  You know, I had a first marriage that went, uh, went wrong and, uh, that was due to a, uh, a -- a horrible, uh, uh, destruction of trust on my, uh, ex wife's part so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, but I'm, uh, married again and, uh, I took trust into major consideration when, uh, when we made the decision to get married.
L:  But yet how do you -- how do you know, you know, like when I picked -- I --
R:  I guess you don't really.  I guess you don't totally ever know because I thought I could trust my first wife so ... and I couldn't so -- as it turns out so, uh --
L:  Right, yeah.  Because I -- I have also experienced that.
R:  Oh, have you really?
L:  Yes, and, um, trying to rebuild at this point.
R:  How long ago was that?
L:  Um, it started about [MN] uh, right about two years ago this month.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, and lasted, uh, about nine months.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's with your current husband?
L:  Yes.
R:  Wow, and you were able to put it back together?
L:  No.
R:  No.
L:  Um, I can't -- well, at this point we're still together.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, we've got kids.  Um, I can't -- well, I think you must have felt that way also because you didn't repair that first marriage.
R:  Right, absolutely.
L:  Um --
R:  I can't even -- I couldn't even look her in the face and trust her ever again.
L:  And that's how I feel.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's totally how I feel.  Um, the pain is so enormous.
R:  Oh, man.  Yeah, I know.
L:  [MN] and it -- you think it's never gonna happen to you.
R:  No, that's exactly right.  It -- it seems like something you see on TV or something or, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Yeah, so, you know, at this point, you know, at my beginning point thinking of a life partner, that's what I wanted.
R:  Right.
L:  At this point, that issue is paramount.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  What mak- -- what keeps you together?  Just the kids?
L:  Yeah, and financial.
R:  And financial.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are you seeing other people or ...
L:  No.
R:  No, you're not.
L:  No.
R:  That must be rough.
L:  Yeah.  And -- well he -- he is not now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it lasted for nine months, then it was over.  But I never felt, um, true remorse for it.  Never felt that he was really sorry.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm.
L:  Which is -- uh, I mean, you probably felt that same thing.
R:  Absolutely.  I -- you know, and -- and, uh, somehow I was to blame for it --
L:  That's --
R:  -- or according -- you -- according to her, and I don't know if you've -- you got that too.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, I look back and it wasn't perfect but [MN] you know.
L:  Well, same here but I -- I don't think that anything warrants that action.
R:  No, I don't either.
L:  You know, there's, you know, on my part wherever he'd complain, it was, you know, "Fine, then let's go for counseling".
R:  What's that?
L:  I -- you know, I also asked, "Let's go for counseling if you think things aren't --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- perfect here".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And he refused.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, you know, I felt that on my end I always tried and that wasn't done on the other end so ...
R:  Hm.
L:  But, yeah, I -- I think -- I think trust -- trust is absolutely the most important thing.
R:  Yeah, that's where I'm coming from.  I mean, I feel I have a trusting relationship now.
L:  Do you have kids?
R:  Oh, I have a step -- stepson now so, um, and I didn't in the -- luckily I didn't have mar- children in my first marriage --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or that would have become -- luckily and unluckily of course but, you know, that would have become a m- a much intense issue.
L:  Right.
R:  But, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, the other thing is that I feel like I still love her but, you know, I know nothing could ever be the same because of what she did and, uh --
L:  And had -- had at that point I -- did she tell you or did you catch her?
R:  Uh, she left with no notice.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  And, um, I had to track her down basically and it turned out to be at the time we owned a business together so, um, she actually ran off with one of my employees so, uh --
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  That was a rather rough one, but, um, then she came back, um, to town and tried to make things right again and, uh, you know, just looking at her I knew that, you know, I can never look her in the face again and trust her.  If she goes to the store, I'm gonna be wondering where she's going and, you know --
L:  And you don't feel that at all with your current wife?
R:  No, I don't.  Not at all.  She's, uh --
L:  Yeah, see that's just -- that's just exactly what it is.  I don't trust him.
R:  Yeah.  You know, if he's -- like I imagine if he calls ya, and says, "Well, I'm gonna be an hour late" you're wondering, "Yeah, right.  You know, where are you gonna be?"
L:  Right, and -- and due to his work, which is how he had met her, um, he still certainly has opportunity to see her while she -- while he's working and I know he did at that time often.
R:  Hm.
L:  And, um, you know, so he says that he doesn't stop in there anymore.  She owns a business with her husband.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it's a similar kind of situation.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Wow.
L:  And, uh, you know, I know that if he was stopping in there, her husband would call me very quickly [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, because he didn't know about it.  I called him [LAUGH].  I said, "We need to talk" [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I wasn't gonna let her get away with it but she essentially did get away with it because he had too much to lose financially --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because they're quite -- very wealthy.  We are not.  But, um, [MN] I know -- even as far as looking for another life partner, if at any point I would do that, to me it would be very [NOISE] difficult to, um, trust somebody again.
R:  Yeah, you know, that was really kind of the case with me but I guess I've let my guard down enough to trust my current wife.  I don't think that I'll ever trust anybody the way I initially trusted--
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my first wife.  I don't, you know --
L:  How long were you married?
R:  Uh, we were married for five years.  We were together for, uh, nine years.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, uh ...
L:  Yeah, it wasn't like --
R:  No, it wasn't like, you know, a first year thing or something or, you know, but, uh, yeah, it was, you know, destruction of what I thought a life we had built together.  Complete destruction.
L:  Right.
R:  So ....
L:  Right.  That is -- that's exactly it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You now, I've got a fifteen year old daughter and a twelve year old son and, um, [COUGH] one of the biggest things that we talk about when it comes to relationships is respect.  You just have to have somebody that respects you.
R:  Yeah.  Hm. 
L:  And --
R:  So, you guys are staying together basically for the kids only, or is it the money too or ...?
