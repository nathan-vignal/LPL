R:  My name is Mary.
L:  My name's Ali.
R:  Hello, Ali.
L:  Hey, how're you doing, Mary?
R:  Okay.
L:  I've never done this before.
R:  Uh, me neither.
L:  Okay.  Where are you?
R:  In Oklahoma.
L:  Oklahoma.  I'm in Atlanta.
R:  Oh.
L:  I bet it's cold there, huh?
R:  Huh, yes.  Pretty cold [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's a lot warmer today than it has been.
L:  You get the worst of all the weather, don't you?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  If you don't like it one day, just wait around.
L:  That's right.
R:  It'll be better next day.
L:  That's right.  So, what are we supposed to talk about here?
R:  Uh, what's our favorite holiday --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and why?
L:  Well, what's your favorite holiday?
R:  [MN] Thanksgiving [SIGH].
L:  Yeah?  You like the food?
R:  I like the getting together, sharing, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, the -- it's an easier holiday for everybody to get together.
L:  Yeah, it sure is, and, uh, of course if your family is, uh, a family that gets along it's nice for everybody to get together.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we have, um, a big family --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- extended families, you know, aunts and uncles and cousins and grandkids and -- and stuff like that [MN].
L:  Is everybody in Oklahoma?
R:  Mostly.  The ones that are in Texas, you know, we don't get to see them too much on holidays.  Then we go out once or twice a year and have a barbecue or something in the summertime [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's nice.  What time -- what time is it in Oklahoma right now?
R:  Ten o'clock.
L:  Ten o'clock.  All right, so you're an hour behind me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, so are you from Oklahoma?
R:  Oh, uh, yeah.  Well, I was born in Texas but been here since I was in second grade.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  Same town, too [LAUGH].
L: [MN]
R:  Lived in other towns every once in a while but always come back to Jade[?]
L:  Yeah.  What, uh -- what do you do for a living?
R:  Home daycare.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  How many kids do you have there?
R:  I can have seven at a time [MN].  I have about thirteen enrolled.  I'm twenty four seven.
L:  Wow.  You must have a lot of patience.
R:  I have a lot more patience with children than I do with adults [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's -- that's good.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's good because I, uh -- I'm kinda the opposite but I guess, uh -- what we -- I'm -- I'm supposed to tell you my favorite hol -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- what is my favorite holiday?   Um, hm.  Well, I like Christmas just because it's nice for -- to get all the gifts and give gifts and all that stuff.
R:  [MN]
L:  Although sometimes it's stressful because you -- you know, you gotta have, uh -- have the right gifts and everything but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, but --
R:  I find it very stressful --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- lately because of the economy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the lack of income.  You can't give a present that you wanna give, you know, and, you know, it's --
L:  That's right.  So, do you have kids yourself?
R:  Oh, yeah.  I've got two boys.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're all growed up.  They're now at the position where they can buy Mama presents.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Yeah, my youngest one, he's had a heck of a year.  He's worked all year long and he a- was able to take me to the store and buy -- give us -- say, "You got this amount of money.  You're gonna spend it on clothes" [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  That's great.  What does he do?
R:  He works at the chicken plant [SIGH].
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Do you know what that is?
L:  No.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What is the chicken plant?
R:  [COUGH] It's where the chickens come in in a truck --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- live and they leave in the freezer.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  He works in the debone part.
L:  So, he has to, uh -- he doesn't kill the chickens.
R:  No.  They're already cleaned up and everything by the time he gets a hold of them.  They're just taking 'em apart and the chicken breast and tenders and things is what he messes with.
L:  Oh.  How do they, uh, kill those chickens?  Has he ever told you?
R:  They've got a machine now.
L:  Really. 
R:  Cuts their necks [MN].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What does it do?  It just chops their head off or --
R:  Not all the way.  They -- it's supposed to, I think, but half -- there's a lot of the -- the first ones that get a hold of 'em have to go ahead and pull the neck off.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's -- it's weird but it's not so bad.
L:  No.  Well, and so he lives close.  How about the other one?  Does he live close to you, too?
R:  Oh, yeah.  He -- he -- he works over in the next town, uh, at a lumber yard.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  He's been there three years.  I'm pretty proud of him.
L:  That's good.  So, everybody's stayed close to home.
R:  Pretty close.  Between this town and one town in Texas is about the whole family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How about your family?  You got kids?
L:  No.  No, I'm still single.
R:  How old are ya?
L:  Thirty seven.
R:  That's not bad.  I'm forty four.
L:  Oh.  Well, you must have had your kids early, huh?
R:  No, I was twenty three before I had my first one.  My oldest one's twenty one.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah, my youngest one's nineteen.
L:  So, you're married, single?
R:  Nah.  I tried getting married three times.  Didn't work out.
L:  Three times, huh?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Goodness.  Well, at least you -- you try [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, that's what I -- my youngest one's already informed me that I'm gonna die a widow or die single [LAUGH].  He's not letting nobody else come in here [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Wow.  Well, that's -- y- y- you're not looking, huh?  You're just --
R:  Well, kinda sort of.  Uh, it would take a hell of a man, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I'm very temperamental and the daycare comes first, the kids come first, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, I have one special needs child that if he still needs me when he's eighteen in five more years or in what eleven more years then, uh, I'm gonna be here for him.
L:  That's good.
R:  You know, and a man ain't gonna take me away from that.
L:  That's good.
R:  But it'd be nice --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- later, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to find someone that could blend in.  That would be great.
L:  Right.  That's good.  Well, maybe you can ans- -- let me tell you my little niece who's gonna be two years old, uh, screams bloody murder every time I walk into the room.  I don't know what's going on with her.  She just started this.  She doesn't -- I don't know.  I scare her to death.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What's that all about?
R:  Um, that could be anything.  It could be what you're wearing or -- my sister had that problem with a child --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, he just -- she'd just look at him --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and sh- he would scream --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- and cry --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and it took a long time for him to quit doing that.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well --
R:  It could be how loud you are or how quiet you are.  Um, I don't know.
L:  I don't know.  She's hurt my feelings though.
R:  I know, but the thing to do is don't -- don't crowd her.
L:  Yeah, don't force it.
R:  Yeah.  Just don't run away from her either.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, but don't crowd her and just, uh -- she'll come around.
L:  And my, uh, sister wanted to take her to a daycare and she cried so much when she leaves her, that she couldn't do it, so ...
R:  Now, if she trusts the daycare -- uh, the baby's two, then she's talking a little bit?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Okay.  Um, I've had, uh -- I've had kids come in here.  I think this one little boy it took him almost a month before he would quit screaming.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, when his Mama left him.  And then I've got a couple of others that they're playing -- they've playing their mother, you know.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Right after door shuts --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and Mom -- before Mom's even in the car --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they're quiet and they're playing.
L:  Right.
R:  But until she shuts the door, they're screaming, "Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me" [LAUGH].
L:  I -- I can see her doing that, yeah.
R:  Yeah, but, um -- but you're gotta -- it's hard.  You're gotta -- you're gotta trust the daycare.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the daycare has to let that child scream and -- and have a fit.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and give it a quiet time. 
L:  Right.
R:  I always say, "If you're gonna throw a fit, you go lie down until you feel like playing" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that usually works pretty good.
L:  I wish you were in Atlanta.  She could [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- she --
R:  Well, right now I could use some more kids, I tell ya.
L:  Really?  Well, you should move to Atlanta --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- 'cause she's having a heck of a -- I mean, everybody has a hard time finding people.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Well, down here the economy's so bad that it -- I've got four kids that would come back in a minute but they're -- it won't pay their Dad to go to work.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah.  They lose, um -- they lose too many benefits plus the help with daycare, it costs too much.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  With four kids, daycare's expensive.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ... and I've got others that grandparents are taking care of 'em --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I got a couple that they're latchkey kids now 'cause Mama can't afford to let 'em come here.
L:  Right.
R:  But they call me every day.  "We're home now, Mary".
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I say, "Okay, you stay in the house till Mom gets there" [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Well, um --
R:  Oh, we're supposed to invent a holiday.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, invent your holiday please.
R:  No, you ...
