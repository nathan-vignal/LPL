R:  Hello.
L:  H- Hello.  I'm --
R:  This is --
L:  My name is, uh, Tony Wallis.
R:  And I'm Pam Parnell.
L:  Hi.  How're you doing today?
R:  Just fine.  How are you?
L:  I'm doing great.  Um, uh, you wanna go first or you want --
R:  Well, if you want, you can.  It don't matter.
L:  Um, well, what I thought about is since -- since it happened, that, um, I know I stay at home a lot more and especially when it first started I didn't -- didn't go out much and I still do I spend -- spend, um, a -- a lot more time interested in the news every day and watching, like, CNN and seeing what's going on and --
R:  Yeah, we do, too.  We have --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- it on every morning and every night and, um, we had planned a vacation for, you know, like in October but when that happened, we haven't been anywhere since.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it just worries me really bad.
L:  Yes, yes, yeah.  I mean, yeah, that's definitely cut down on vacations and I -- I -- I remember before it happened I wasn't one to fly and it wasn't because of no good an airplane.  I just don't like to fly period anyway, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  But when that happened then that made it even less --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, wanting to fly.
R:  Yeah, 'cause you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- don't know who the terrorist is and who they might strike next.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think it's really affected everybody.
L:  And even though, like, you know, you try not to prejudge anyone but when you see -- wanna see something or see someone that you might feel might be part of it, you -- you just, you know, you can help but "Hey, what's going on?"
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  You can't help but to, uh -- you can't help but to, um, uh, you know, have -- have somebody like if -- if that person, you know, is he doing something or you know --
R:  It makes you look around every corner [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  It's -- it's made, uh, my husband and I both really paranoid of going anywhere really.
L:  Yeah.  Well, definitely, definitely.  So, they're always warning you that something's gonna happen again and --
R:  And it will happen again, I'm quite sure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's scary what's gonna happen to this world too.
L:  Yeah, I mean -- and, you know, the same thing about it on, uh, -- well, what your beliefs are but suddenly everybody has -- has seemed like they've grown closer, whatever religion they believe in, have -- have grown -- have gone more of -- uh, their faith has made 'em grow into whatever they believe in. 
R:  Yes, I agree.
L:  It's just since this happened.
R:  I agree.
L:  You know.
R:  Uh, I'll never forget what I was doing that day.  Me and my daughter was helping over the church camp, you know, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we ha- -- we was painting some fence posts and had the radio going and heard it and I'll always remember what I was doing on September the eleventh.
L:  [MN] Well, you finished or you still going?
R:  Yeah, I'm still here.
L:  The thing about it -- the thing about it that I'll never forget is, um, I was in surgery on that day.  That was my last -- the last time I was in surgery.  I'm a dialysis patient and I -- I had surgery and I'm -- I'm on the way to the surgery and it's in -- in Duke -- Duke University and I'm hearing -- I hear on the radio about some planes go- um, going to the World Trade, and to tell you the truth, I really didn't know what the World Trade Center was and then, like I kept hearing reports, and they said something about the Pentagon.  I knew what the Pentagon was.  And -- and, um, I think well -- well once I got there, that I had had the surgery before I hear about the last plane that went down.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, you know, I -- I was -- I was -- I was just so scared.  I'm like, "What is going on?  I mean, what is going on in the world?"  Why are all these planes -- you know, after -- it was report after report and I'm wondering.  I said, "How are they gonna to perform [MN] if you know -- I just don't know what they're gonna hit next, you know.
R:  I know, and -- and we don't know how many terrorists is here in the United States and what their next plan is.
L:  And the thing about it people, uh -- a lot of people talk about how in New York and how they couldn't tell the difference.  I've been to New York.  My brother lives there now.  There are so many there you could -- they were just part of [inaudible] and they were just part of, you know, the normal everyday crowd so the minute they said it came why they couldn't identify 'em, because they fit in.  There's just as many of them as they're any race in the -- or people in New York, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I -- you know, being there I've seen and it's -- they've -- they've kinda taken over but they have [inaudible] everywhere there, you know.
R:  I would imagine.
L:  Yeah, and like I said, they be theirselves and they're finding -- they seem to all be in New York or somewhere.  Somewhere around that area.
R:  I -- I --
L:  You know.
R:  -- would be afraid to be there.  I'd be afraid --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to be in Washington or -- or really just any place at this point.
L:  You know, yeah, really because I mean I -- you know, I -- it's really, you don't know where they're gonna hit but you figure that those two places that, you know, I really don't want to be there [LAUGH].
R:  And it's so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- scary because we're going to war, there's no doubt.  
L:  Yeah, you know then again the thing about that about going to war, I -- I -- what I'm worried about is not only what Saddam Hussein would do but I really do think the terrorist attacks -- some more are gonna happen when we -- the war happens.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're gonna be mad about the war and I think some things are gonna happen then.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I really do.
R:  Yeah.  The +anthrax and then, or however you pronounce it, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then they're talking about all these smallpox vaccinations and --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- don't know what they're gonna put out there, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's just so scary, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I always felt so safe 'cause I love America, you know, and I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- was born and raised in Kentucky --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, now I'm afraid, you know.  
L:  Yeah.  They said the best thing we, you now, have here is the freedom that we have. Again, it's -- the bad thing is the freedom that we have because the people -- the -- you get to do what you want to do and 'cause -- if you want to be a bad person, it allows you to do that too, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's -- it's -- it's good and bad but, you know, I still love it.  I love all people and you know, you know what I'm saying.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I know exactly what you're saying.
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  Yeah, it -- it -- I --
L:  You say -- it is -- it is scary like you say.
R:  They say, uh, not to change anything in your life so I wasn't gonna take my daughter trick or treating that --
L:  Oh, mhm.
R:  -- October and you know, they're saying, "Well, don't change anything you do" and then, you know, you're paranoid because you're wondering, "Well, is this person putting something, maybe in this candy to maybe kill somebody or ..." 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, because there's a lot of terrorists terrorizing on the United States.
L:  Uh, I think you're like -- I mean, I mean you used to have [several inaudible words] when we were kids but now, Jesus, nobody is off limits now, jeeze [LAUGH] you know.
R:  I know.
L:  That's the scary thing too.  
R:  I know.
L:  Nobody's off limits.  Just -- just we -- anybody -- the person is a target so, you know, they -- that's why you say you worry about your kids, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they -- they -- they -- they don't, you know -- so they can't look for it like you can.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know what I'm saying?  So, you really worry about them even more.
R:  And I feel sorry for all the little kids over, you know, in Afghanistan and all them places, you know, that -- that get killed and -- and, you know, they ain't even got to live their life yet.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Innocent people like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's, uh --
R:  And there's just so many terrorist groups out there, you know, it just [MN] it just -- you've got to watch your back all the time it seems like and then I don't think that's really gonna help.
L:  No. not at all.  Not at all.  I mean, I don't know, I mean and I say when you are out somewhere you, uh, -- a lot of times I'm thinking, you know, especially -- especially when you're in a crowd of a lot of people and you think about, uh, would this be a target and --
R:  Right.
L:  What kind of buildings -- you don't go into big buildings anymore.
R:  Yeah, you're paranoid.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I think it's changed everybody, you know.  Everybody.
L:  Wait -- hello.
R:  Pardon me?
L:  Oh, w- w- what were you saying?
R:  I said I think it's changed everybody, you know, and how they see the world today.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and I was really proud of all those people that attacked that one on that plane, you know, and know- knowing they were gonna die, and --
L:  That's -- yeah, that -- that took a whole lot of courage right there.
R:  Yeah, it sure did.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, it just changed everybody's life, I think, and I don't want to take a vacation.  I don't wanna think about going too far from home.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't wanna be, like you said, in a big crowd of people or -- or anything, you know, 'cause you don't know who to look for.
L:  No, not at all.  You know, you really don't know who at all is, uh -- when you, uh -- 'cause wherever I go, I just gotta [MN] try to make it as quick as possible.
R:  You what?
L:  I say wherever I go, I try -- try to get in and I, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- 'cause you're scared and you're gonna do whatever do 'cause --
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I stay close to home now and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and it -- it just -- it's made me see life different and -- and I know the war's coming and -- and there's no telling what they're gonna do, you know.  I feel like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I feel like this world might soon be over [LAUGH].
L:  It definitely -- it definitely seems like, you know, it could be.  The way -- the way that they -- they -- they doing it now, well you don't care about yourself.  You know, there's no way to defend against that, you know.
R:  I know and if they -- you know, they talk about, um, all the things -- the nuclear stuff and if that did get here, you know, it would probably kill -- probably no telling how many people.  Maybe everybody.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We don't know how powerful they are.  It is only the, uh -- only the government knows how really powerful they are and who has what, you know.
R:  Yeah, and they're not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- gonna tell us everything.
L:  I think -- I think there's a ...
