R:  [LAUGH] What's this -- we -- if we have a favorite holiday?
L:  Um, yeah.  I guess mine's Halloween.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'd probably say mine's Christmas.
L:  Oh, well.  
R:  Good.
L:  I like Halloween 'cause of the -- I don't know.  I've got kids and it's their favorite holiday 'cause they get to dress up and go out and do the candy thing and I don't know.  I mean, they like Christmas, too but for some reason --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I've always been partial to Halloween so ...
R:  Yeah, well kids like candy and I always -- um, I'm kinda a -- an older mum and I have an eight year old and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- oh, I don't know, Christmas is -- is nice because, you know, [COUGH] kids kinda feel -- oh, Christmas is probably the best time of the year and kids get to -- he still believes in Santa Claus and they -- you know, they're so excited getting the presents and --
L:  Yeah, mine still believe in Santa too but --
R:  Christmas is kind of a magical time.
L:  I don't know.  It's just, um -- yeah, Christmas is -- yeah, definitely.  I mean, it's -- it's -- I guess what they said if you had a favorite holiday, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- well, no.  I mean, I'm not tr- trying to [LAUGH] tell -- I guess that -- that Christmas is fun because it's fun for my -- my daughter and -- and -- and everything 'cause she's -- she's nine so she still believes in Santa too [SIGH] but as my favorite holiday, I guess I've -- since I'm almost forty, I guess I've sort of outgrown the whole Santa Claus thing, awake late wrapping presents thing so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  I'm forty seven and have an eight year old but I don't know, I think Christmas is still my favorite holiday.
L:  It's also asks us --
R:  I like to -- yeah.
L:  -- if we could create a holiday, so ...
R:  Yeah, I can't remember what he said.  To create a holiday, what would it be? [MN]
L:  Huh.
R:  Probably be a holiday where parents didn't have to --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, work [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They could take time off and have a maid come in or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have somebody cook for ya, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] That'd be --
R:  Wouldn't that be a nice --
L:  -- a good -- that'd be a good holiday.
R:  [LAUGH] Where you didn't have to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- rush around get all kinds of stuff done.
L:  Oh, yeah [NOISE].
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Didn't have to spend a lot of money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] You could, uh --
R:  You could, you know, go on vacation and -- and not come back for --
L:  Two weeks.
R:  -- a couple of weeks at least [LAUGH] --
L:  Cancun holiday.
R:  -- and get paid for it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Huh?
L:  Cancun holiday.
R:  Cancun holiday [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  The Mex- the Mexican -- the Mexican holiday.  Yeah, I guess that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my -- that would be -- that would be a really good holiday for me --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- 'cause I'm a single mum so ...
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Yeah.  That would be like, uh --
R:  Oh, you got like double duty then.
L:  Well, yeah, and I work full time so ...
R:  Oh, where do you live?
L:  In Cleveland.
R:  Oh, wow.  I'm in southeast Iowa.
L:  Are you?
R:  Right now, we're getting all kinds of snow.  It's unbelievable. [MN]
L:  We've had a really bad winter here too, so ...
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah --
R:  Oh.
L:   -- it's been -- they said it's the worst winter Cleveland's seen.  I've been here for twelve years and --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  -- it's definitely the [SIGH] worst winter that we've had.  It's been sub z- I mean, last winter and the winters before were -- were mild and this has been like eight inches constantly of snow on the ground and --
R:  Oh, my gosh.  Really?
L:  Yeah --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and sub zero weather and you don't want to go out and your cars don't start anymore and --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- and I drive forty five miles to work every day so ...
R:  Oh my word.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I drive like, yeah, thirty miles.
L:  I think we're off the subject though [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  How we -- we gotta get paid for this, we're gotta talk on the right thing.
L:  [LAUGH] I guess.  How did you find out?  I went on the Internet and found it.
R:  Oh, so did I.  I went on the message board and I found 'em on deals connection or something.  I can't remember but oh --
L:  They said that -- you know, when they sent me my email they said you can only do three of them [NOISE].
R:  Yeah, I called 'em and I told I -- I -- I set it up for, like, weekday nights and then I -- I woke up my husband and I thought, "Can I do it like over the weekend night?" and they said, "Sure".  So, I said, "Okay".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, oh we gotta get this subject taken care of then.
L:  Well, how long are we supposed to talk for?
R:  I said ten minutes.
L:  Ten minutes.
R:  I looked at the microwave here and it's -- I think we started at nine twenty four so it's like nine twenty eight.  We've been talking about four minutes.
L:  Oh, man.
R:  Can you --
L:  Ten minutes is --
R:  -- remember the rest of the question? [LAUGH].
L:  Just -- it just asked if -- if you had [NOISE] --
R:  Could create a holiday what would it --
L:  Could create a holiday what would it be and what's your favorite holiday and, you know, I -- that's about, uh-- that's all I really remember.  I didn't know it was gonna be interaction with somebody else.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I thought they were just gonna call and ask me questions so, um, they didn't really explain it on my email.
R:  Oh --
L:  Um.
R:  -- oh, they did on mine. 
L:  They just give me my PIN number and said that, you know, when somebody calls [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, anyways, um, yeah, your holiday sounds pretty good.  I guess that, um, I was thinking of that movie.  Uh, did you ever watch that [NOISE] -- oh, what was that one that where -- where they actually combined Christmas and Halloween? [NOISE].
R:  No.
L:  The Nightmare before -- The Nightmare before Christmas.
R:  Oh, no.  I've heard of that but I never saw it.  No.
L:  Now, that would -- for me, because when you started talking about Christmas, yeah, Christmas is -- because you get together with your family --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and, you know, like I got -- all my brothers and sisters are grown and my parents are still alive so, um, you know -- and -- and -- and kicking [LAUGH].
R:  Oh [MN].
L:  So, we always sort of all converge.
R:  Oh, you go there.
L:  Yeah.  My father was a math professor at BGSU in Bowling Green so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- he's retired now.
R:  So, if you could kinda combine Christmas and Halloween.
L:  Yeah, that would be my -- it -- 'cause I need to have all -- I don't know, I kinda -- I'm kind of a -- a -- I'm not a spooky person but I like to be --
R:  So, its' gonna be a --
L:  -- scared.
R:  --religious spooky holiday with all kinds of candy and --
L:  Yeah, and presents to open.  It would be like -- 'cause I mean there -- there is no doubt that even I'm almost forty I -- I mean I -- I still enjoy going to my parents house and they always get us -- they always get everybody gifts, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:   -- so, um, and most of the time now that my sister and brother and I are all grown, we pick out our gifts but -- but every year they -- they -- they surprise us with something that wasn't on our list or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and so, ideally, I guess that -- but that movie just -- when you said Christmas and I said Halloween, that movie sort of, uh [NOISE] sort --
R:  But then you'd have to go trick or treating --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the snow.
L:  Well, you wouldn't have to go trick or treating.  I guess you could -- you know, um, uh --
R:  Well, if you get snow.
L:  -- I spent, um, part of my -- when I was in college I spent a year in Nova Scotia --
R:  Oh my word.
L:   -- Canada --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they have a -- they have a [NOISE] -- guys, I'm on the phone.  They have a -- a holiday that happens every New Year where [NOISE] they actually dress up and, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and go out and, um -- not beg for money but they go from door to door in costumes on New Year's Eve and it's like a tradition in Canada and I can't remember what it was [MN] but I remember going with the people I was staying with and that was sort of a combination of, like, Halloween and, uh -- and -- and the Christmas season so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it was, like, to celebrate the New Year and people would go out and -- and -- and --
R:  That sounds -- sounds kinda different.
L:  -- y- yeah, so --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- and I mean, every -- it wasn't just like them playing a trick on me 'cause I was -- I mean, lots of people were out doing this.
R:  Mhm.
L:   -- so ... but, uh -- so I was just thinking that -- that was a -- a combination of the Halloween Christmasy thing.  The don't really celebrate [NOISE] too much --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- up there the way, uh, we celebrate down here, believe it or not.  So, anyways, you talk for a while.
R:  Oh, what am I gonna say?
L:  [MN].
R:  I was thinking if you combined those two holidays together you'd have to have like a Santa Claus in a different -- in a Halloween costume and --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- and angels in a costume.
L:  [COUGH] Excuse me.  I'm sorry.
R:  And what else?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What else?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, you know, you gotta do Christmas.  Well, you see I'm Catholic so you got that religious component.
L:  Oh, I'm Catholic, too.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  That's probably why I like Halloween 'cause it's so against every -- I mean, not that I'm against Catholicism.  Believe me, I'm a very -- I'm a very religious person.  I'm very staunch but I mean, it's that one time a year where, you know, you kinda let that --
R:  Let that pass.
L:  -- whole -- all those beliefs sort of fly out the window because you don't believe in ghosts and you don't believe in -- you know, it's supposed to be [NOISE] against the Church and stuff.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's just a chance once a year to --
R:  Kind of a Druid thing.
L:  Yeah, where you're just like "Okay, this is obviously a national holiday thing going on here so ... "
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, I don't even know.  Is Halloween even considered a holiday?
R:  No, I don't think so.  Well --
L:  I mean, Christmas and New Years and Easter, those are official holidays.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You don't -- you get days off for those even.
R:  But Halloween is -- well, I think it used to be, like, a holy day.  I don't -- I don't know.
L:  Oh, All Hallows Eve?
R:  All Hallows -- yeah.
L:  Yeah, All Hallows Eve and -- and -- and -- and November first is All Saints Day.
R:  Yeah, that's what that was called, yeah.
L:  And you had to all- we always had to go to church on All Saints Day because I went to a Catholic school so ...
R:  Oh, yeah.  We still do.
L:  [LAUGH] And then, uh -- you know, Fat Tuesday isn't really officially a holiday either but a lot of people go out and go nuts the night before Lent begins, too --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- so ...
R:  Yeah.  Not -- yeah, around here they still do but --
L:  Iowa.
