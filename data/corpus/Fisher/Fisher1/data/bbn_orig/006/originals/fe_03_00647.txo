R:  Hi.  Can you hear me?
L:  Uh, yes I can.
R:  Oh, my name's David Lampley[?]
L:  Hi.  I'm Tina Persuer[?]
R:  How're you doing?
L:  I'm okay.  How are you?
R:  All right.  I live in San Diego.
L:  Oh, I am in Tennessee.  Uh --
R:  I figured you might be in that area --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- by your accent [LAUGH].
L:  That kinda gives it away, doesn't it? [LAUGH]
R:  A little bit.
L:  Yeah, I'm close to Memphis, Tennessee.  Um --
R:  I don't know whether we're waiting for another prompt or ...
L:  Uh --
R:  They said, "Introduce yourself".
L:  Right.  Um, the calls that I've been on before I didn't get another prompt until close to the end of the conversation.  They'll let us know there's just a short time left.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And then a couple of the others that I have been on, there was nothing at the end.  We just, uh, talked maybe fifteen minutes or so and then hung up so [LAUGH] ...
R:  Mhm.  So, it's not very structured then.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, I had, uh -- I was on vacation last week so, um, I think I got one voicemail and, of course, I couldn't take so this is my first one.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, so I guess we should discuss it then, huh?
L:  Right [MN].
R:  How did it affect you at all?
L:  Oh [MN] well, things that I have done different since that time.  Um, tending to spend a whole lot more time with my family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I was, uh, working a lot, my husband was working a lot of overtime and everything at the time and -- and, uh [MN] our kids were at the point where they wanted to stay in their room and read or listen to their music or whatever.  Since that time we have, um, had our satellite service disconnected where we had nothing to do but spend time with each other when we're home together.  So, it has made a big difference as far as the closeness in our family.  Um --
R:  That's probably a good thing.
L:  It seems -- it seems like, you know -- I mean, I'm not scared of what might happen.  You know, I'm not living in fear because I know that if God were to decide, you know, within the next fifteen minutes, it's my time to go, I'm ready.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you know, I don't live --
R:  Not afraid of --
L:  No.
R:  -- something happening to you immediately.
L:  No, no.  I'm not afraid of anything happening to me, um, as far as that goes.  Oh, I mean nobody likes to think about, you know, walking into an airport and getting on a plane and it being the last time you ever do, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, but as far as living in fear, it hasn't affected me that way.  If anything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I would say it has, uh, just pulled everybody in our family closer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So [MN].
R:  I -- I guess -- well I may be different, I may not be.  I don't know.  I'm a Vietnam veteran.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I spent twenty years in the military.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, not much really phases me, um.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I feel really bad for the people --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that it happened to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but, uh --
L:  [NOISE] My three year old joined me.
R:  Sorry?
L:  I said, "My three year old decided to join me".
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I have to take his toy.  Go, back in there with your sisters, come on [NOISE].  Okay [LAUGH].
R:  Um, I may be a little hardened or, uh, you know, going through life -- I mean I've been on ships, I've been on airplanes, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Spent my nine months in Vietnam.  My brother --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, was there with me.  He -- he died of, uh -- you know, had problems, uh, from Vietnam from post traumatic stress disorder.  I came --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- from a military family.  We're pretty close.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, sort of a loner though.  My wife's from another country --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so we have different, uh -- I guess, um, different interests, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and so, like I said, I felt sorry for the people who died --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, uh, I read a lot on Ashcroft before he became attorney general --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it's like this is so strange that all these --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- things sort of fit in, you know, not that I really believe --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the government would have something to do with it but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I've seen everything, heard everything.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Nothing really surprises me.
L:  Yeah, I've done a lot of research since that time and I guess I've probably read more history --
R:  Really?
L:  -- since that time than I have in my entire life, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's interesting because you just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- start thinking and well, --
L:  Yeah, were there --
R:  -- let me see why, you know.
L:  Yeah, and were there signs leading up to this or, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Um, [MN] see I was at work when it happened and a lot of people stayed home --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- were afraid.  I took one plane ride last Thanksgiving.  Not two thousand and two but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- two thousand and one to visit my mother in Atlanta --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it definitely -- not that I travel all that much but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there's such a lot of people in the airport.  It was sort of inconvenient --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, an inconvenience.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I guess that's probably the greatest impact it had on me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [MN] what else?
L:  Um, well I was trying to think.  The day that it happened I had just left my girls at school and I came home and I turned my computer on and before I got signed on good, um, a friend of mine instant messaged me and asked me had I heard any news and I said, "No" and he said, "Well, you need to turn your TV now".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, I turned my TV on, uh, I'm gonna say, maybe five minutes before the second plane hit, and then I guess probably for the next thirty six hours that's where I was.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was, um, right in front of the TV.  I -- I sat there and cried and, um, prayed for the people that their families were involved and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- oh, I don't know.  Just --
R:  You're -- you're a housewife?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You take care of the kids?
L:  Yeah, and a substitute teacher so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- um, I'm here part time, part time not [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I do substitute teaching [MN] and so it's, um, it's --
R:  I -- I guess another --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [MN] input not direct- well, I guess it's directly related, uh, that it seems to me -- you know, I -- I -- like I said, I came from the military from -- my thing was in the seventies so the way to do things is different so I'm old fashioned and live in -- live in the seventies but the way that they're [LAUGH] going about, you know, with tons and tons of ammunition and war planes and over there trying to kill one or two Afghanistan guys --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they've had more accidents killing Americans than they've had --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- casualties, you know, and it's like -- it's like, uh --
L:  I know.
R:  -- it reminds me of the mindset that I read in the sixties, uh, or when they started the Vietnam war and everybody believed whatever Kennedy said, whatever he --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  -- he -- he wanted it this way and that's the way they were gonna do it.  And then it was like ten years later, it's like -- like you know what, we're -- we're not doing anything and we got a lot of people there and fifty eight thousand guys are dead so let's, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- let's back out while we're ahead, you know.  So, it's like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, Americans get in this mindset and they just, you know, uh -- I don't know the word for it.  Uh, we all believe in -- in the same thing, you know, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sort of get, uh, like sheep, you know.  Got down the trail and, uh, get brainwashed a little.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Not that there's a lot of people that have their own disagreements.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah, Americans, you know, are independent too but it's -- I just see this, you know, uh, sort of strange thing.  I sort of sit back and watch the way people react.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, so anyway that's, uh, September eleventh.  I had a friend that I just contacted recently that I went to high school and college with --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we had a reunion and I contacted him, I think, a couple of months before that happened and his daughter went to the elementary school closest to the Pentagon.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I guess he was the first one there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to pick up his daughter.  So, he was right there.  I called him because I knew he was in Alexandria --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I knew that was close, and his wife's a CIA agent , uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so he doesn't anything what she does but, uh, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's the only really person that I had any direct contact with that was close by there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I guess [MN].
L:  Yeah, well I had -- I can't think of anybody, you know, that was, um, directly related with us that was involved in that.  Now, recently just within the last couple of weeks, I have, uh, started talking to this lady on a message board that, um, is dealing with a lot of things from it because her husband was killed there.
R:  Oh [NOISE].
L:  And so, you know, she's really going through a lot and we've kind of got a little on line support group for her so [LAUGH] ...
R:  That's good.  Was he in the building or something?
L:  Yes.  He was in the building.
R:  Mhm [MN].
L:  I know.  I think she said he was on the -- on the seventy ...
