R:  David Kelsey.
L:  Hi, I'm Karen Walker.
R:  Hi Karen.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good.
L:  Good.  So, what do you think?
R:  Oh [COUGH] what do I think?  Um, yeah, it will help you know, um.  It won't be a total deterrent.  I think we've got a long way to go to be honest.
L:  I don't think that there is anything that they can do for people who are willing to die.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I think what we have to look at [MN] is like Israel and, uh, their airline.
L:  Right.
R:  KML, I believe that's what it's called I could be wrong.
L:  LL.
R:  LL, yeah.  And basically look at the shoe bomber, Richard Reid, um, he tried to board one of their flights just to blow their flight up before he boarded, ah, one of our planes.  And he basically came to the conclusion that it wasn't worth it, you know.  But yet he felt that he had an opportunity on -- on a US airplane.  You know, luckily I think the guy was kind of a moron, you know, and wasn't trained well enough and he was stopped.  But obviously the Israelis are doing a, um, better job at, um, screening the passengers and have better sophisticated means of, um, interviewing people or of screening the baggage or whatever to deter that because they've never had a plane hijacked.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, so I mean, you would think there would be a bigger target there.  It's just you know, it's known that they're so efficient in what they do, and we need to incorporate their, um, quality control into our, um, our operations really; that's what I feel.
L:  Right, but you have people who walk around, ah, walking you know with machine guns and stuff too.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Um.
L:  And are Americans ready to do that ...
R:  Mm, I don't know, you know
L:  -- for safety?
R:  Yeah, that's a good question.  You know.
L:  Because [COUGH] I don't know that if someone is [MN] willing to die to take an airplane down, if there's anything that anybody can do ...
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, to keep them from -- with all the measures that we could put in.
R:  Yeah, and, uh, there's many better ways of taking them down to be honest, um, like all the stinger missiles that are missing right now.
L:  All the wh- I'm sorry, all the what?
R:  Stinger missiles --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that are missing from the, ah, um, when we helped the Afghanistani --
L:  Right.
R:  -- freedom fighters.  They would be under twenty years old and probably non operational but other countries are going to come up to that technology sooner or later you know and it is just a matter of time before they fall into the wrong hands and, ah, you know that would be probably a more efficient way to be honest.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  So --
L:  But I don't know, when you have people who are kamikaze and --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- and willing to die and you know.
R:  [MN] Yeah, um --
L:  I think they could take -- I think that they could take better measures but I don't know that any measure is going to ... completely --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- assure that nothing is going to happen.
R:  Yeah, well, um, yeah no -- no -- no, ah, procedure is one hundred percent effective you know.
L:  I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
R:  No procedure is a hundred percent effective.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, so some things will slip through the cracks but I think we need to tighten up our procedures, huh?
L:  Oh, I, yeah definitely.  So -- so what can -- what?  To do what?  What more?
R:  What more can we do?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [NOISE] Um, now that I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean besides leaving our first born there until we get back.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah; yeah, um, that I'm not too sure, what we --
L:  If -- if we did complete background screens, and, um ... and everything that has been brought up and mentioned before, it's gonna make flying obsolete because no one will be able to afford it.
R:  Right it would be true, yeah.  At what cost does your -- does the safety outweigh, you know, for the benefit of the safety outweigh the cost of it?
L:  Right.
R:  Sure.  Yeah, that -- that I don't know and, um, that's a really good question and I don't know that and I --
L:  Yeah, I don't either, because you know I mean, if you -- if you really run a background check --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you're talking about several hundred dollars.
R:  Yeah, for each -- each passenger and all that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and if you had just -- I mean, if you add just the several hundred dollars to each plane ticket ... 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, I -- I --
L:  I mean, how many flights would that stop you from taking?
R:  Oh yeah, well definitely.
L:  And make it not feasible for you to fly, and you go okay, I mean, I can drive this.
R:  Right, I hear you there.
L:  You know?.
R:  Yep, I don't know, you know.
L:  I mean, especially salesmen and stuff who are not -- you know who are paid on commission, and they are not reimbursed for their flights.
R:  Right, yep.  I -- th- I, myself haven't flown since nine eleven, you know, not that I fly that much --
L:  I haven't either.
R:  -- not that I fly that much myself in the first place, but, um, yeah it's -- who knows?
L:  But, I personally ...
R:  Mm?
L:  -- have ... since nine eleven, I don't know that I would -- I would have a lot of  ... apprehension about flying now be- that's before when I didn't.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.
R:  Sure.  [MN]
L:  Um, so even though I haven't flown since then, if I had of had the opportunity to -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know and say either flown or driven --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which for me, driving is a whole lot -- driving is painfully ... is painful for me physically to drive because I have fibromyalgia[?]. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I would still take driving.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I would take the three days that I would be in bed recuperating after the drive.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah, so, I mean for me, it's -- you know, like ... it is a big thing.
R:  Yeah, it -- uh, I don't know where all this will end you know, is the best defence against all of this is basically, um, get out of the middle east in general, you know what I mean?  Um, kind of I think that, you know, that the more you stir things up over there ... it's got to come over here somehow.
L:  Or not, you know, we're not going to get out of the Middle East.  And, even if we do get out of the Middle East, there's not going to be peace in the Middle East.  If there's no bible, there's not going to be peace in the Middle East, ever, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And you go ... [LIPSMACK] you can't argue with that.  I mean ... you know it's just not going to happen.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, as much as you'd like to see it happen, I agree with you there.  It's just too fractional, too nutty really.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  You've got people who believe that they're right, and instead of being, like, well, like I am.  I can have an opinion about something, and just because you have a different opinion, doesn't make me feel like you're wrong.
R:  Right.
L:  It just means that we different su- you know we have different opinions.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We're different people, and we believe different things, but that's not how they believe over there.
R:  Yeah, theyre --
L:  You know, if you have a different opinion, you know, you're -- they'd just as soon see you dead.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  You know.  [NOISE]
R:  Yes, it's very fanatical.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  So -- but as far as airport security, you know I have no idea what more that they can do.
R:  Yeah, but besides just making it so prohibitively expensive that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- everybody goes, uh, rail for mass transit, you know.
L:  Right, and then what are they going to do with mass transit, you know and rail?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They are going to end up having to do the same thing.
R:  Yes, t- t- to an extent yes, yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ... but you know we had the bus attacks after -- after nine eleven.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Yes, that's true, I remember those.  [NOISE]
L:  So.
R:  Oh, then you know ...
L:  You know, I -- private car --
R:  [NOISE] -- homeland security in general with the DC sniper.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know the fact that they were of Islamic faith and all that kinda, you know, worse things could happen that pop -- you have one in every state you know as they said.  
L:  Right.
R:  Um, where all this leads to, I don't know, you know.  [NOISE]  'Cause, you know we could go over [NOISE] to the Middle East [NOISE] and take it out in a matter of months I mean --
L:  And you don't think that's where we're headed?
R:  Um, no 'cause I don't think the US population -- I don't think the, um, uh, people of America would let it happen to be honest with you.  [inaudible] let it happen, you know.  Um, 'cause Bush's popularity is waning right now, um, pretty hard; and there's a lot of, um, anti war sentiment out there and really we're the only nation that; besides England; you know, which will support us in anything; we know that -- that, um, is wanting it, to be honest.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  [NOISE]  All of our allies are kinda saying, [NOISE] you know this is almost gunboat materialism.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And, if you go in there and decide to take out the whole entire Middle East which I, obviously you could very easily, um, [NOISE] but at what cost, you know?  You know they'll -- they'll come back and hit us with something.  [NOISE].  There's no way they can't. [NOISE]  Then the big question is, you know, if you fight a war, you should win something right?  [COUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  What would you -- would you have won?  [NOISE]
L:  Um, well [inaudible].  It's whether ... you know it's been something that's been going on for a long time.
R:  Yes, that's true 'cause you know, um, I agree with you there, um, because --
