R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Hi, my name is Lorrie.
R:  You're name is what?
L:  Lorrie.
R:  Lorrie?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's too funny, my name is Laurie.
L:  Oh, is it?
R:  [LAUGH] Yes, How do you spell yours?
L:  L.O.R.R.I.E.
R:  And mine's L.A.U.R.I.E.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, gosh, that's pretty funny, when --
L:  [SIGH] That is.
R:  -- you said your name was Lorrie, I though, "Wait a minute, is --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- she telling me what my name is?" [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  This is my first time doing this.
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Oh, okay.  Well, I was in some kind of a study previously, um, [SIGH] but this was a little bit different and, um, it -- this is my first w- w- call on the Fisher study.
L:  Okay.
R:  [SIGH] So, you got the topic?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, holidays?
R:  Yeah, what's your favorite holiday, and [COUGH] --
L:  If you could create one?
R:  -- and -- and if you could create one, what would it be and how would you celebrate it.
L:  I just haven't thought about this [SIGH] till they just said. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I know, I guess, you know, you can -- you can log online and see what the list of topics are, but it's --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.  When they -- they in- told you what [LIPSMACK] what the, uh -- your PIN and, uh, information about the study, there was a [SIGH] -- there was some link [SIGH] to topics.
L:  Oh, okay, I'll --
R:  And I --
L:  -- have to check that out.
R:  Yeah, I went to that and while they had, like, about fifty [SIGH] different topics and some of them were very interesting, um --
L:  Hm.
R:  Well, [SIGH] anyway --
L:  Do you want --
R:  -- do you have a favorite holiday?
L:  [SIGH] Um, I guess probably, um, Easter, um, [LIPSMACK] I like it because, um, it's, um, celebrating the birth of Christ and, um, also it's in the spring and it's the --
R:  Not the birth.
L:  I mean the birth, [LAUGH] thank you.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  The, um --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- resurrection, you know, death and resurrection of Christ.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [SIGH] And, um, also, um, we always have a spring party also.  I guess if I was going to create a holiday, that's probably what it would be, just a spring holiday, where, [SIGH] um, we'd just celebrate that i- it's the new beginning, you know, of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- spring, and, we fly kites and have a, um, [LIPSMACK] a little hunt for things around the yard with baskets, kind of like an Easter egg hunt.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, [SIGH] we make the spring wreath and put on the door and, um, that kind of stuff.
R:  Well, that sounds cool.
L:  So, what about you?
R:  [SIGH] Well, my favorite holiday has always been Halloween.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] And, um, I have good --
L:  Why's that?
R:  -- good memories of it when I was a kid, you know, getting [SIGH] -- getting dressed up or -- or having my mum help me make a costume or -- and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [SIGH] um, just being taken around the neighborhood when I was very little, and, uh, collecting candy.  Of course, I -- I have a sweet tooth, I always have, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that -- you know, I like that part of it. [SIGH] [COUGH] Excuse me. [LIPSMACK] And, um, [LIPSMACK] [MN] I -- as I got older and could go round with other kids in the neighborhood without my parents that was, uh -- it -- they -- it was always just something exciting about -- about it, um, going up to a [SIGH] -- a dark house that didn't have any -- any lights on and --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- knocking on the door anyway because they probably didn't want to be bothered, but we would knock on the door and then run away. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] I was a rotten kid. [SIGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, but that's, uh -- that's always been my favorite --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- holiday, and even as an adult, you know, just , um, going to costume parties and , um --
L:  Well, it is fun to have a reason to dress up and --
R:  Yeah, I think we ought to dress up more often.
L:  Yeah, than just then, you know.  I have tried for the kids' birthdays, uh, sometimes have the kids come dressed up --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- you know, for a birthday party.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  [SIGH] I don't know if you're old enough to remember the -- the -- the old, um, come as you are parties?
L:  Oh, no. [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah, they're -- they -- that used to be something people would do, they would just [SIGH] call people at the last minute and just say, "Come as you are" and not -- you know, people would -- whatever they were wearing, whether it was a -- if they were in their skivvies or [SIGH] -- or whatever , um --
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- they would just come, like that, and -- and there'd be [NOISE] you know, food there and, um -- that's -- I think that's lot of -- lots of fun.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] You know, and, uh, not to be all dressed up for a party, [SIGH] uh, but just to come kind of au natural.  And if I had to, um, [SIGH] spe- uh, no, if I had to, if I could create a holiday, I think I would create , um, an international peace day.
L:  Oh, okay, that's good.
R:  And, how to celebrate it?  Um, I guess, one [MN] would want to honor peacemakers.
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  And, uh, [COUGH] -- and maybe, um, take actions, um, against war, against , um, violence.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And kind -- you know, try to teach -- to teach peace.
L:  Right. [SIGH] I'm not for war, um, and I'm not sure about getting involved in this one right now, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I do understand -- I've read a lot of, um, [LIPSMACK] history books on different wars and things, that sometimes to keep peace, you [LIPSMACK] have to fight.  I mean by not fighting, [SIGH] you don't have freedom.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, but if you -- if you look back to lots of wars that have, um, started and -- and they seemed like just wars, [SIGH] the -- the reason that they started was because, um, tyrants were able to take power.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, because of injustice.  I mean for instance, if -- if there had been a fair settlement after the first war -- World War --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I don't think Hitler would ever have come to power, but the people were suffering tremendously --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he was able to, you know, scapegoat one particular group and [SIGH] um, it -- it -- you know, and gain, uh, gain a lot of power, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because the -- the -- the -- the German people had been treated very, very unfairly after that first war.  Uh, they were punished and -- and in other words --
L:  Huh?
R:  -- the, um, the Allies , um, punished them severely in, uh, in the Treaty of Versailles.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, I don't think we would have needed to go to war, we wouldn't have had a Hitler [SIGH] to, um, to fight, if, uh, if it hadn't been for that, so [SIGH] --
L:  Well, that may have, um, um, helped, but I think there's always tyrants who want power, who want to rule, and [SIGH] want to have power over other countries and -- and that may have delayed it some, but --
R:  [SIGH] Well, and we've put some of them in -- in power.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, we -- we assassinated a democratically elected [SIGH], uh, Allende on, of all things, September eleventh nineteen seventy one.
L:  [SIGH] Where was he president?
R:  Chile.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, the, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [MN] our CIA was responsible for his assassination [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and, um, [COUGH] and then they had, uh, who did they end up with?  Um --
L:  Somebody that was --
R:  You know, they ended up with a -- a -- a dictator that we supported --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Pinochet.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Who -- who, you know, was, uh, is a war criminal. [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] Um, we've done that in a lot of places.  In fact, we supported, um, Saddam Hussein.
L:  [LIPSMACK] W- I'm -- I'm not aware of when we supported him.
R:  Before the first Gulf War.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The first Gulf War, like this is going to be the next Gulf War.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] One in a series. [LIPSMACK] But before that war, um, when he was fighting Iran, you know, it was -- it was to our, [SIGH] um, advantage to, you know, we wanted to see the Iranians' faces rubbed in the dirt because of the, uh, embassy incident, and we supported, uh, Sad- we -- we armed him.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hm.
R:  Yeah, read your history. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, well, yeah, and that's -- like I say, I've -- I've read some later, but, yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that -- that's even more recent.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's -- that is, and you know, when you think about wh- when you think about [SIGH] -- oh, well we're getting a little far afield from holidays bu, uh, [LAUGH] it -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it -- it really is very, um, it's very upsetting that we -- y- you know, we're probably going to have, [SIGH] um, uh, [MN] a lot of blood shed on both sides.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Both civilians and -- and our -- military people, [SIGH] um, [SIGH] or -- you know, fighting a -- [SIGH] trying to depose a dictator who, um, who we propped up there, when it --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- was, uh, when it was to our advantage to do it.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, that's a good point.
R:  Yeah, we've done it a lot.  I mean, I -- I -- [MN] I -- I feel very -- I feel like I'm a very patriotic American --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I don't think being patriotic means necessarily falling into goose step [SIGH] behind a president who is just w-
