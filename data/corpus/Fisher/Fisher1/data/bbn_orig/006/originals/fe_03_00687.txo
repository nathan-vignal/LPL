L:  Hi, I'm Karen.
R:  Hi, I'm Fran.
L:  Okay.
R:  Have you ever done this?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no I haven't.  [LAUGH]
R:  No, me neither.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, [MN] um, airport security, um what do you think?
R:  Uh, I'm not convinced that it increases anything except the time that you have to spend in line.
L:  Right, I -- actually I haven't flown since September eleventh, so I wouldn't know personally.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I'm not so sure that's effective, I mean taking sewing kits doesn't seem to me to be a great help.
R:  Right.  And taking, ah, randomly taking little old ladies, I mean I've been where [NOISE] they picked on an eighty something year old couple in front of me, out to go through all their luggage.
L:  That's incredible to me because I know they're trying to fight against this idea of profiling possible terrorists, but it seems to me that going after the elderly just to seem fair is really ridiculous.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Definitely.
R:  I have flown a couple of times and, uh, the time that you have to get there and the time that you have to wait and the thing there with people taking their shoes off ...
L:  Good lord.
R:  Um.
L:  How long have you generally had to wait in line?
R:  [NOISE] Oh, we've gone to the airport, like, an hour and a half to two hours before a flight and I've had the experience of the people, um, the security people weren't even there yet.
L:  Wow.
R:  Um, we went through -- I mean we couldn't get through.  We had to wait and we could see them in there, it wasn't the time that their shift was and all.  Somebody said they were sitting around talking but they weren't letting people go through.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  So, I mean, I personally haven't had any experience that made me feel like any safer about it.
L:  Definitely.  I know, well it doesn't seem to me that they are hiring them as qualified of people.  So --
R:  I mean, they're just like, not hiring criminals any more.
L:  Which is a step up of course.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I think, I don't know what they're paying but I think it's pretty close to minimum wage, which ...
R:  [MN]
L:  I don't know, I think if they really want to get people to catch --
R:  Well, for government -- I think they're government employees now so there has to be more money.
L:  That's true.  Definitely.
R:  Doesn't mean they have to do more work, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, they get paid more money for the same job.
L:  Mhm.  Hm.  So ...  [SIGH]
R:  I don't like to fly.
L:  Yeah, neither do I.
R:  And I wish I felt it was safe.
L:  Mhm.  I know.  It just -- the thought -- I have to fly later in the year, just the thought of it's giving me the creeps.  Just -- I frankly I don't think that there's -- I think if there's someone who really wants to get something through, I don't think there's much they can do to prevent it.
R:  Mhm.  I think they've -- that's been proven.
L:  Yeah.  It certainly has.  I just think that they're +focusing -- focusing so much on the tiny things, like, you know scissors and sewing kits that you know they are losing sight of the forest for the trees.
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE]  I think it's just an effort to make people think that you know something's being done.
L:  Exactly.  Well, you know, and they're hoping that seeming busy will seem like mo- somehow confuse people into thinking that's the same thing as keeping the airport safe, but in reality it's not.
R:  Having a lot of people very frustrated with the uh increased wait, and the amount of time it takes to get -- you know, that airplane travel's not so quick any more when you have to add all this time on.
L:  Oh, exactly.  Well, I know [SIGH] -- I don't know what airport it was that just filed for bankruptcy but you know that thought of having to go to the airport and take off my shoes and stand in line for three hours, isn't very appealing when I could just -- if it's a short flight, just get in the car.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, financially that's not a good thing either.  I don't know what they're gonna do.
R:  I mean I'm not opposed to, like, the extra money that they add on for the, um, ticket now.  [inaudible] if they're really doing something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just not really sure that that's what's happening.
L:  Exactly, exactly.  Well, I mean the sad thing is that we'll actually never know if something was averted just because people -- someone was too scared to go to the airport, or whatever.  So, it's a shame that we couldn't actually know that; it would probably make us feel a lot better.
R:  Well, they have all these statistics on people that just did it, like, deliberately took things through like just to show that it hadn't really been beefed up that they could still get these things through.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And that was pretty frightening to read.
L:  Oh, definitely.  Yeah, that definitely was.  [SIGH] What to do? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's why I don't fly.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I think ah, that's the general reaction.  I think there's definitely less people flying.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]  Before, you know, business people have to fly but people for pleasure I think, I would think that that's pretty -- that's down some.
L:  Oh, definitely.  I know that a lot of people over the holidays, who usually fly that I know, drove out with their families.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, yeah it's definitely affecting things.  [NOISE]  Mhm.
R:  I just personally, I'm not comforted -- comforted by the idea.  I don't have the opinion that if this government employs then it's taken care of.
L:  Exactly.  Well, same here [MN], it's [MN].  They've been known to slack off on a few things and not get it quite right.  [NOISE] Frankly.
R:  I don't know how much difference it makes, like, you know from one airline to another, I guess it goes by the airport.
L:  Definitely.  I don't know what the airline was, but there's one airline that really had a focus on security, even before September eleventh --
R:  El Al[?]?
L:  -- and they already had -- no, it was American -- it wasn't Jet Blue but it was something like that; it was a small company and they already had steel reinforced, uh, cockpit doors well before September eleventh.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I know, they were -- I'd be probably feel more comfortable with them as opposed to, like, US Air.  But El Al is definitely something I could [LAUGH] you know, stand behind because they're definitely, really good with security.
R:  I mean, I've never flown them, but that to me that's the name I always associated with the most security.
L:  Oh yeah, definitely.  I'd -- I don't know where they fly.  I know they fly into San Diego and LA but not anywhere near me.  But they ask, like, such probing questions whenever you go through security, like, even who did you date?  Because, I know, I heard one story about a woman who was questioned, and she had been dating someone while she was in Israel and it turned out, you know, they just kept questioning her about it, and she was really frustrated.  But it turned out he had slipped something into one of her slippers, something that would explode and they sniffed it out.  Quite amazing.
R:  Well, see there, I'm impressed with something like that, with a story like that.
L:  Definitely.  It never ceases to amaze me.
R:  But not all the people have to go through separate -- go through something separately if they have a pacemaker.
L:  Oh, exactly.  Well, I know I heard at one point, heard on the news some time that Al Gore had been searched at the airport.
R:  Really?  [LAUGH]
L:  Like, singled out to be searched and you have to wonder.  You know, I know he's a little sad about losing the election but really I mean you don't [LAUGH] you don't have to assume he'd go to those lengths.
R:  No.  That's going a little too far.
L:  Exactly.  So, some things, a little better training might make me feel a little better but the fact is I'm just going to be leary.
R:  Oh, and that, I mean and I know this isn't a very good thing to admit but I'm not really against profiling in the States.
L:  Yeah, that's something that a lot of people think but they just don't want to say because it --
R:  Right, I feel I shouldn't say it but you know we don't know each other.
L:  Exactly [LAUGH] I can't quote you.  Uh-huh but ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, I feel the same way, I mean ... it's --
R:  And I would feel there are people that if I saw in line in front of me I'd feel upset about getting on an airplane with --
L:  Well, you have to use your intuition, and that's what that is.  I mean if -- if we knew that little old ladies were the ones perpetrating terrorist acts, we'd feel uncomfortable around little old ladies.  So, it's just -- you have to go with your intuition and common sense in this case.  [NOISE]
R:  But, I know that's not the, uh, politically correct thing to say.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I know.  Yeah, I don't -- I know some people that if you said that around them they would just, they'd be apoplectic, they wouldn't know what to say.  They'd think you were a horrible person, but --
R:  I have to say that's the first time I've said it because ...
L:  Really.
R:  I don't know that I'd say it even around my friends.
L:  Well, exactly.  Well that means already this phone call's helped you.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Get that off your chest.  [NOISE]  That um, [NOISE] yeah that's the truth, I think that's the truth that most people don't want to admit that it's -- it's something that really should get out there. [NOISE]  Because as long as they keep continuing this charade of, [NOISE] "Oh we have to be absolutely entirely fair, and single out everyone" while they're searching, you know, twelve year old Johnny who is going to a soccer game in North Carolina, they could -- someone else could be slipping through the cracks.
R:  I think that, um, they're doing -- I mean, I think it's not as random as they're saying anyway.
L:  Yeah, well one would certainly would hope.  Since I haven't been there I really don't have a basis of comparison but --
R:  'Cause we were stopped on a flight last summer, um, and I think it was because we had a one way ticket.
L:  Oh.
R:  If we had gone on two different airlines, then I think --
