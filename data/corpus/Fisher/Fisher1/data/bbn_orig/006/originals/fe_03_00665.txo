L:  Hello.
R:  Hi there.
L:  My name is Ken.
R:  Hi.  My name is Andrew.
L:  Hi, Andrew.  I've been asked this question a lot.  Uh, I think, um, along with doing surveys like this on the phone, I do a lot of surveys on line, uh, through emails and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that's one of their favorite questions and -- and I -- I haven't made any changes but even -- even if I had though I think I would answer that I hadn't, uh, because I -- I think that's part of -- of, uh, how I feel that we can respond and we're not gonna tell some -- we're not gonna exaggerate anything and say something, "Oh, you know, I'm more afraid than I am or whatever" you know but I actually haven't made any changes.  It really hasn't -- hasn't affected my life at all.
R:  You know, I felt that same way.  Um, I have noticed some of the changes -- I live on the west coast in California so --
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  -- physically I was separated from the actual events --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- however, uh, [MN] you know, the -- the changes that have come about, uh, because of them have been sm- -- have been small and, you know, slight but they kind of add up to a sort of, um, kind -- kind of like a -- like a small little wave that comes over it like, um, for instance one of the small things was, uh, I had to ride the, uh, Metro train to get my school every day and, uh, that's -- it's called Bath and, uh, one of the things was they shut down every single restroom [LAUGH] --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- throughout the entire system and I -- I know somewhere -- some want to do that in the name of security --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but they kept them shut down for about six months --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that -- you know, I -- I was kind of disgusted by a lot of the things that happened.  Uh, the bathroom really got me because, you know, how are you gonna shut down bathrooms, you know, just to save a few bucks in the name of security.  But, also, um, things like, uh, the whole car promotion that just wouldn't stop.  The, you know, "Keep America Rolling" [NOISE].  You know, that -- that really affected my perception of what happened, you know.  I -- I want to believe things have changed for me but I don't think they really have, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  At first, you know, Letterman was like, "Oh, you know, things have changed.  No-one can be funny" and all these things were just happening all over the place and, um, they were like, everyone wondered if, you know, things would be, you know, the same ever again but it seems like things have settled into exactly the same way they were before --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and now the mindset's like, "Okay, now it's going to stay this way permanently.  Things are never gonna change".
L:  That's right, yeah.
R:  So, to me that's how things have changed.
L:  Yeah, it just -- it just changed my viewing habits, you know.  I just watch TV more that's all, you know [LAUGH].  That's about it [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Actually TV -- like I -- I've gotten myself into a -- a more rigid television structure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, I'll watch, you know, maybe like some whatever -- I -- we're kind of watching Fox now because Fox has a lot of stupid programming, it's mindless and it's kind of fun.  You know, they have that man versus animal and it was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so stupid and mindless but --
L:  Well, I -- I actually -- I actually watch the news more.  That's what I'm watching.  I'm watching the news about the terrorism war.  That's what I'm watching but --
R:  Yeah, I was gonna say the same thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We watch something stupid then we watch the news and then we watch Letterman.  It's our --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- stupid, very important news every single day ten o'clock, you know, the good st- -- solid hour for news --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then, uh -- and then something stupid again.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Also on my radio I've set, uh, a bunch of presets.  I've set all my AM stations to, uh, purely news stations.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, whenever anything happens, anything at all I always, you know, go right to the AM radio station so I can find out what's going on you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And there's always, you know, alerts on the radio so ...
L:  Yeah, I -- I find myself watching news on TV all the time.  Oh, I just have the news on all the time.  It's really strange.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But that's it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You getting many calls or ...?
R:  Um, yeah, at first, uh, I wasn't sure how to end the calls so I -- I took like three or four of 'em --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, the sys- but we weren't sure how it's supposed to end so the system gonna -- it will cut us off after ten minutes and say, "Thank you" --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- but we just have to talk- talking till it says, "Thank you".
L:  We do?  So, you do have to stay on for ten minutes?
R:  Do have to stay on -- yeah, I found out the hard way because I had done like a whole bunch and apparently they didn't count because we didn't stay on for the full ten minutes.
L:  Oh, bummer.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, this is my -- like my sixth one but we always just shut off really quick so --
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's the way I was doing it at first and then I call them because no one I talked was really sure about how it was supposed to work.  We finally [LAUGH] figured out, you know, um "Okay, this is -- " uh, something's not right here because no-one was getting inf- any information so we finally -- I finally called them and found out, oh, that the, uh -- you have to wait for ten minutes --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- until it says, "Thank you".  It was funny because the lady I talked to was living in Tennessee and, uh, I connected to her like three separate times just the way this has been set up --
L:  Yeah, I got some --
R:  -- then --
L:  -- lady twice, yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, it's because we didn't wait until it said, "Thank you" so, anyway [LAUGH].
L:  No, that's fine.  I -- I don't mind.  As long as they told us that up front I would -- I would do it, you know, but if they don't tell us up front --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's no way you can know.
R:  Oh, now a lot of us were confused because nowhere in any of the messages or anything we got did it talk about --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you know, "Oh, you have to, you know, wait for this full ten minutes" but anyway ...
L:  That's right.  Yeah, I agree.
R:  A lot of folks need to know [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, really.
R:  I actually -- I found out about this whole survey thing from U Penn, like from a deal website [LAUGH].
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, that's pretty funny but, um, anyway back to the conversation [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, security and all that.  I -- I notice a lot of stupid security for small things, very small things like our traffic court here has this just minor security system set up now and you [MN] -- tax dollars at work, you just can't believe it.  They make you take off your shoes and your belt before you even go into the building for anybody.
L:  Wow.
R:  And it's just -- they -- they had this like ninety year old man taking off his shoes and his belt in the name of security and I -- again it was to the point of ridiculousness for me so ...
L:  Yeah.  A lot of people going way overboard that's for sure.
R:  Yeah, um, but it -- it's nice to see that things are loosening up a little bit.  I was at the airport a little while ago and, uh, things were a little bit milder than they [LAUGH] were to begin with.  Uh, folks were definitely, you know, a lot looser.  The whole federal, um, security thing at the airports.  That really, um, -- one of the things about that was that, you know, they were gonna get rid of all the original screeners and here in Bay area apparently the screening system was very good but it was all, um, people who weren't officially US citizens.  They were -- they had green cards but they weren't citizens.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, they all got fired and they were excellent screeners and they had no problems ever but they had to put those federal guards in and now all the federal guards, you know, having the problems and everything and so, I don't know.  I'm just [MN] -- as far as the security goes, it [MN] -- it's kind of [MN] to a point, anal [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  That's right, yeah.
R:  And I'm just -- and -- and now the way things are going with, uh, you know, in -- in the name of anti terrorism we have, you know, the off -- uh, total information awareness in the offers of homeland security.  It's just -- it seems like -- I hate to the be paranoid, you know, you know, person, you know, ra- [LAUGH] shaking things up but it -- it's seems like it -- we're -- we're beginning to slip into like a ninety eighty four type situation here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm not liking it, I'm just -- you know, I'm certainly not the paranoid, you know, information nut but this -- some of the things here are very scary and also I just heard on the news today that, uh, Bush was talking about some strategic office -- I think it was called strat commerce.  And they were talking about deploying nukes in the war that we haven't even decided to fight so [MN].
L:  Well, it's -- they have to do something, you know, and you have to support whatever they do because that's -- that's what they're for, you know.  There's no sense in -- in electing somebody and then not giving them any power so [LAUGH] it's --
R:  No, no, I agree with you totally.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I think, you know, if Bush kind of slipped up in his days but, uh -- I'm sorry, not Bush, Clinton.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Clinton should have done something when he was in power but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, I -- I think, you know, they definitely need to do something.  They need to get rid of the whole, you know, Saddam's regime over there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  That needs to be changed out.  That's just a matter of fact --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, and you know, you -- you can't claim that we need to do for oil or whatever.  That's garbage, you know.  We're always going to need oil, we're always gonna need that stuff no matter what you do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We're gonna have to change it but there's just no changing it so we gotta do something now.  I don't think nukes are the answer though [LAUGH].  I don't think --
L:  Well, I don't know.  I've -- I've heard a lot about, uh, tactical nuclear weapons, you know, in field -- in the field for not -- not mass destruction where you're gonna wipe out a whole city or anything but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- tactical nukes, uh, you know, for limited use.  I don't see any problem with that.  If it's gonna be used in the field just against military targets, that's -- we're not -- we're not talking old technology, you know, where you're gonna drop 'em from ten miles up and then wipe out half the country.  We're not talking that, you know.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I wouldn't -- wouldn't be in favor of that either.  Of course not.  You know, that's just mass destruction.  That's what we're fighting against.  But, uh, tactical nukes --
R:  I actually -- I'm gonna claim ignorance because I do not know about the weapons they're talking about.  All I know is that they were talking about using nuclear type weapons and that's [MN] --
L:  Well -- well, I -- I don't -- I -- I -- when they -- when they say that, um -- I've heard that too but they had -- they had tactical nukes in -- in, uh, the theater in ninety one for the Gulf war too.  They just didn't use 'em.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, I don't know.  And they probably won't use 'em this time but, uh, for -- for the strategy that -- that they could employ, I -- I would be in favor of it, so ...
R:  Yeah, well, whatever gets the job done, I guess.
L:  Yes, that's right.  That's right.
R:  [MN] 
L:  Exactly.  Don't -- don't take any weapons away from them.  Don't take any of the things that they have options away, you know.
R:  Yeah.  No, no, no, definitely.  I mean, um, it's very important that it gets done.  Really, it is.  I mean, [MN] --
L:  Well, I don't know.  I've -- I'm lucky I'm from southern California and -- and I don't -- I'm far aware removed.  I grew up on the east coast so I feel for 'em but, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, we don't think out here that it affects us because it -- because it doesn't, because they're not here, you know.  It hasn't happened to us.  Maybe when it does, maybe everybody's gonna change their minds but ...
