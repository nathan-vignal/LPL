R:  Hi, my name's Cindy
L:  Hi, I'm Terri.
R:  Are we just supposed to talk?
L:  I think so.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I haven't done one of these so I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]  Me too, this is my first so we'll -- we'll help each other through.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.  [LAUGH]  Oh, what do you think about the question?
L:  I think that anybody who wants to really get onto a plane and do some damage is going to find a way to do it.
R:  They're going to do it anyway. You know they'll get through.  It -- I mean, maybe it helps get some of the -- the toenail clippers out but ...
L:  Yeah, well you know, it's just like a lock makes an honest person honest?  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Exactly, they're still going to get through, and they're still going to do what they want to on an airplane regardless.
L:  Exactly, we do [several inaudible words] for a living --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and um, you know, they talk about the -- the keeping all the knives and stuff out.  Well, excuse me, but the bottom line is, um, if I wanted to I could take a knife right on.
R: [LAUGH]  Exactly.
L:  It would be made out of -- out of, uh, obsidian, which is volcanic glass --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and obsidian is -- it goes down to one molecule.  That's what they used for eye surgery before they had lasers.
R:  Ah, well you know you can --
L:  So, you know --
R:  There's always ways they can find, you know.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I mean, one way or the other if they are determined to get in and do some damage, they're gonna.
R:  Yeah, you know I mean there's just -- and look how many things that they have found trying to get on airplanes, imagine how many they have not found.
L:  Yes, exactly.  Exactly.
R:  You know there is just, -- I truly think that they can just get through with anything they want to; if they are seriously minded enough to do it, they will find a way to do it.
L:  I agree, one hundred percent.
R:  You know, that's how a lot of the drugs and such come into our country, is they find a way to do it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm, and as soon as they plug up one hole they find another one.
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly, and you know, and if you have to fly you have to fly.
L:  Yeah, yeah, do you do much flying?
R:  Uh, no not really.
L:  I haven't for a while.  I did for a -- I was quite active with it for quite some time.
R:  I did quite a bit a while back
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's just me and my two teenagers now, so we don't do a lot of flying any more.  [LAUGH]
L:  I understand, I've got custody of a fifteen year old grandson.  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, I have a fifteen year old and a thirteen year old, so, and they're both boys.
L:  Ah ha.
R:  You know, so we just -- we just don't do a lot of flying any more, um ...
L:  No, me either.
R:  No, it ...
L:  It's not ...
R:  I just stay home pretty much.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, [LAUGH] when the kids around.
R:  Oh yeah, exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Kids can, uh, be I tell you, a whole handful.
L:  That's for sure.
R:  But you know, after this whole nine one one thing, I don't think either one of my kids would want- --would wanted to have got on an airplane.
L:  No.
R:  Because it's -- it's scary.
L:  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.
R:  But, you know, I mean there was this woman on the news with all this terrorist attack the other d- -- um -- oh when -- it wasn't the other day, my gosh, it was New Years Eve.  And she was in Las Vegas.  We live near Las Vegas, and, um, she says you know there -- there, um, has been some kind of terrorist warning on Las Vegas over New Years Eve, and she says, "If they're gonna kill me, they're gonna kill me".
L:  Mhm.
R:  If you're flying in an airplane you have to think the exact same thing nowadays.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, when it's your time to go, it's your time to go.
R:  Well, yeah, and I kinda wonder too sometimes, there's some people that get on the airplane that are allowed to carry a weapon on airplanes.  Well, what if they just lost their mind?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Would there be any difference in, you know, them killing everybody?  Um, someone who is allowed to have a weapon on an airplane?
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, I mean, I don't think there's any difference whatsoever.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Because they're going to get it through.
L:  Well, and the bottom line is it is kinda like gun control, if you take guns away from John Q public -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- only the, the cops and the robbers have 'em.  [MN].
R:  Yeah, and the robbers outgun the cops.  [LAUGH]
L:  You got it.  [LAUGH]  I wintered in Arizona for a few years, and out there everybody can wear a gun on their hip.  As long as it is exposed, you can carry any gun you want.
R:  Yeah, I lived in Lake [inaudible] for quite a few years.
L:  So, you understand that; and the crime was down because nobody knows if somebody's got ...
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, and they don't have the amount of crime that they have around here.
R:  No, no, see where I live we have extremely little crime, I live in Southern Utah.
L:  Ah.
R:  We moved up here about four or five years ago, and there is very little crime.
L:  A beautiful state.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's beautiful; it's a little too, um, [LIPSMACK] righteous just for me, but, um ...
L:  [LAUGH]  I understand what you're saying, I caught up in [inaudible] Idaho the last couple of springs --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and I was a full time RVer; and went off the goat trail --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and Idaho, and got into [inaudible] Canyon, and oh God it's wonderful there.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, it's absolutely gorgeous, but you know here, you have to get a permit to carry a gun, you know --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and you have to have an  -- if you want to conceal your gun you have to have it.  But you know what?  They give the classes down at the local pawn shops.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  Well, Michigan's a little harder than that.
R:  Ah.
L:  Um, they're relatively strict here which is fine, I don't have a problem with that, as long as people can still have access to them.  I don't believe in taking them away from everyone.
R:  I don't either.  I don't.
L:  Only because, you know, crime is definitely deterred if you don't know if there is a gun on the other side of the door.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.  That's why I don't have a problem, like, with airlines.  Some of the people I know that you know do, with the possibility of a pilot carrying a gun, because jeez, you know, if someone comes to break into the cockpit, um, they can probably get that gun out real quick.
L:  Yup.
R:  You know, and save a lot of people on an airplane.
L:  If they're capable of using it.
R:  Yeah exactly.
L:  That's the next thing, I mean I refused; I was a full time RVer for ten years --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I refused to carry a gun with me because it was only giving someone the ammunition to kill me with.  
R:  Ex- [NOISE] haven't either.  Uh, are you there?
L:  Pardon?  Yeah, I'm here.
R:  My phone just went click, I don't understand that.  Um, we don't have one either, just because I have teenagers.
L.  Mm hm.
R:  You know, I mean, I live in a good neighbourhood you know, but just 'cause I have teenagers I don't have a gun.
L:  I don't blame you.  I wouldn't have one around here with my grandson.
R:  Oh no, I'd have to lock it up and then what good is it?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  You know, I'd say, "Excuse me, Mr. Burglar, hold on while I go get the ammunition in one room and the gun in the other room" you know, no, no, that -- that's not for me  [LAUGH].
L:  Yep, I understand totally.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  And the bottom line is, I could point it at him but I'd never be able to pull the trigger.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, yeah, the only way I ever would is if my sons' lives were in danger.
L:  Yeah, well, I think maybe then I could but I'm just, you know, if it were just me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You -- you know they'd take it away from me and kill me.
R:  Oh me too, oh sure, oh sure.
L:  Why give them the ammunition?  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Exactly.  God.  Where did you find out about this survey?
L:  Through a big, big, savings.
R:  Ooh.  See I'm -- I'm disabled and so I, um -- I'm home unfortunately; I don't like being home, um, and I have nothing to do so I go on to some freebee sites on the internet --
L:  Okay, so you're in the big league forum already too then?
R:  Yep, exactly.
L:  Okay, same here, I'm Centaura.
R:  Ooh, okay, I'm Cindy on there or was -- or it used to be Cinde with an e and now it's Cindy.  Was Cindy because someone, something happened and I lost my user name.  I mostly go into easy board forums.
L:  Ah.
R:  And there's a lot of -- a lot of them there, and I found out about this one, and because it's blasted everywhere on the internet ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  --and I thought well you know that's a good thing.  I have nothing to do anyway.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah only I had -- I was minus water one day and this is the first call that I have actually gotten through, they called several times. 
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  But I haven't been here, so ...
R:  Yeah, they called a couple of times and for some reason I wasn't home --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or, um, I was actually probably in bed, um.  [LAUGH]  Yeah, well, I was hurt at work a few years ago.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, um, I am only forty one and I'll never work again.
L:  Oh dear.
R:  Yeah, so I'm home.  So, I figured, "Jeez, you know, if I can be of help of anything, I am more than willing to do it".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And um, I had no clue what kind of questions they would ask.
L:  Me either.
R:  Yes, I di- of course I had no idea how it worked.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, we're both finding out together.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, exactly.  I mean the question was very, I mean I don't -- [LIPSMACK] you have your feeling on it and that's it, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So, thought they maybe keep calling you on it because you have your feeling on it.  [MN]
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know it's not a multi dimensional question.
L:  No, not at all.
R:  Not at all.
L:  At least this one isn't.  There's others I could probably go on for hours on.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh sure.  Oh, oh yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, let's do something on alternative healing and I'll never shut up.
R:  Yes, exactly, yeah, yeah or give you something on --
L:  Or why people shouldn't give their kids their immunization shot.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly, yeah, like give me something on disability, workmen's comp, you know I'd talk for hours.  [LAUGH]  I wouldn't have a problem on those.
L:  Exactly, but when you're talking about something that you don't participate in it's difficult.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah I mean I don't fly on planes very often but you know I -- and it's funny because when I used to, I never ever thought about guns being on airplanes.
L:  You know the only time I ever had -- I had two -- two kinda of closey[?] calls but not like this.  I mean --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- one was when North West Airlines dumped the entire thing underneath the, uh, expressway in Detroit.
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  About two months later I was flying in North West and they routed me to Detroit, and -- and as they pulled me out of the gates the pilot says, "Well, excuse me folks but the rudder doesn't feel quite right, I'm pulling in to have it checked" and he pulled in and the rudder fell off.
R:  Oh my land.
L:  Now, this plane had just landed with a load full.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh my gosh.
L:  So that was pretty scary.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh wow, the most I ever ran into was storms.
L:  Well, I had that one, one time too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes. Yeah.
L:  I was taking a puddle jumper up to the upper peninsula to meet my ex, uh, and --
