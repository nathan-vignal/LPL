L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi [LAUGH].
R:  Hi.
L:  My -- my name's Cletta.
R:  What's your name?
L:  Cletta.
R:  Cletta?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm Shannon.
L:  Have you done this before?
R:  No.
L:  I haven't either.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, we should be real good then.
L:  Yeah.  Do they stop us or anything in the middle or -- I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- how long as we supposed to talk?
R:  I have no idea.
L:  What'd they say?  We're supposed to talk about how things changed after --
R:  If anything in your life has changed after September eleventh.
L:  After September eleventh.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Uh, West Virginia.
R:  West Virginia?
L:  Yeah.  You?
R:  Upstate New York.
L:  Oh, my gosh.  You're in New York.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Oh, you're -- did you, uh -- you were up there [MN] -- I hurt my leg that's why I'm moaning.  Uh, what we supposed to talk about here [LAUGH]?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, well I tell you ain't nothing much changed of mine except I'm scared to death now [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  No, I can't really think of anything that has really changed at all.
L:  Well, I -- I never flew or anything before and I -- I surely wouldn't fly now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'd be afraid to get in a plane or anything.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh --
R:  I've flown before but not recently.
L:  But -- but you never had a fear of flying?
R:  No, not really.  It didn't really bother me ever before.  I think I'd -- I think I'd be more scared about the whole airport security thing that they have going on now where it takes forever to get through and [MN] all the different scares that they've had about finding, you know, people with weapons and stuff in the airports.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Yes, I'd, uh, -- I don't know.  I think it's safer here at the house --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- than in a --
R:  I did go to New York City the January after but I didn't get down to the site, and it was --
L:  I guess, uh, yeah, they have that all cleaned up but it didn't take 'em long, did it?
R:  I don't really know.  I know that they're done now, yeah, but I don't remember how long it actually took.
L:  They, uh, never did find everybody though, did they?
R:  I don't think so.
L:  I know, um, there was, uh, a man from here in town, uh, that used to be here.  He was a -- a preacher and his grandson was killed in the -- was in the plane that hit the Pentagon.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's terrible.
L:  A real nice looking boy.  Oh, but, uh, I think, uh -- no, I don't think anything's changed about my life [LAUGH] after that but I never did anything before [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But somebody told me they got like, uh, five calls, uh, in two days.
R:  For what?
L:  To do this.
R:  Oh, really?  I've gotten [COUGH] I think -- I think this is my fourth.  The one -- actually I got one earlier today but I wasn't here.  It was my answering machine and then my husband got one when I wasn't here and then I got another one like five minutes before I was leaving for work so I couldn't really do any of those so I was really happy when they finally called and I actually had the time to do it.
L:  Well, I think I've missed, uh -- uh, let's see there was, uh -- I don't know if it was this morning.  There was about three calls but it just said, "Penn University" or something.
R:  Right.
L:  And I was expecting a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a one eight hundred Penn or one eight hun- the eight hundred number, but that wasn't what showed up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then I was on the Internet last year --
R:  And it said about how it wasn't --
L:  -- and it came over my call wave --
R:  Right [NOISE].
L:  -- you know, that -- but there was anything I could do then.  I was on the Internet.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I've -- I've probably missed about four of 'em.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do they pay you when -- [LAUGH] I guess we're supposed to be talking about that other thing.  Do they pay you after this is all over with or what [LAUGH]?
R:  Um, I'm not sure when that happens [MN].  I don't know if, you know, they're doing this for so long and then you'll get paid at the end of whenever they're done or if they send you a check after every single one that you do.  I'm not really sure.
L:  I wonder what the purpose is?  I mean --
R:  I think it's a -- a university and they're doing some sort of research project.
L:  Mhm. So, they -- are they taping us?
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, you talk about something then [LAUGH] and I'll jump in.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, okay.  Thanks.
L:  Well, I don't know what -- I don't know what, uh -- now the other day I think I couldn't have talked about it e- either because they told me the topic was, uh, uh, lasting relationships or --
R:  Life partners?
L:  Yeah, life partners or something.
R:  Yeah, that was the one that my husband got.
L:  [LAUGH] And I've been divorced for about nine years so I --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- I couldn't have really jumped in that one either.
R:  Nope.
L:  So, uh, I mean I don't know a whole lot about this, uh, nine eleven thing except for what I've seen on TV and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, you know, I never did fly before.
R:  Right.
L:  And --
R:  Were you at home when it happened?
L:  Um, yes and I forget who call- oh, I know.  I was -- I was on my way to a county about twenty five miles and I had my radio on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they were talking about it but I didn't think it was a real thing, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  Because I think when I -- when it was on there it was when, uh, the plane hit the second building.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the weather -- I mean, the news guy was saying that another plane had hit the other tower and I wasn't sure what he was talking about.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, you know, I listened a little bit and then when I got back, I stopped at my sister's and she was watching it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on TV.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I didn't know, you know, what it was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or anything till I got back.  Because I thought it was just some kind of story on the radio.  I didn't think it was -- something was really happening.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, no, I don't guess it's affected my life much except, um, really don't want to do again and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- then after, every time you hear a plane --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LAUGH] you know, it's kinda scary.
R:  Yeah, it is.  Especially once they fly low.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, that always makes me kinda nervous.
L:  But that's, uh -- I guess that's the only thing.  How it's affected me is that I'm scared to death to have to hear an airplane go over.  I'm really afraid, you know, of them attacking again --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because they said something about if, uh, if we bomb over there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that the -- the Twin Towers would have looked like a -- a fire cracker or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- compared to what they would do.  So, that's a scary thought.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I'm afraid, you know, I'm just afraid of what will happen if they do --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, attack over there so ...
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I mean, I hate to see even -- now, I'm not -- I don't guess I'm supposed to get into anything like that but [LAUGH] ...
R:  I remember I was at home and I actually had the TV on so I saw it, you know, right when they started broadcasting it and my husband actually at the time was, uh -- he was stockbroker so they sent him home because they -- when they -- you know, obviously they shut down the NASDAQ and everything in New York City, on Wall Street so he couldn't do anything.  So -- and they ended up sending everybody home then.
L:  Is that far from --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- where that is or ...?
R:  Um --
L:  I'm not real familiar with New York.
R:  Yeah.  I'm right up by Lake Ontario.  Have you ever heard of Syracuse, New York?
L:  Yeah, I've heard of it but like I said, I couldn't --
R:  Don't know --
L:  -- I'm sure where everything is --
R:  Right 
L:  -- up there.  I mean --
R:  It's -- yeah, it's probably three hundred miles away.
L:  That's still pretty close home, isn't it?
R:  Yeah.  A little closer than I would have liked to be.
L:  Yeah, but there were -- there were, uh, a couple of other people from here in this town that was -- I think two of them.  No, one other one worked in one of the towers and another one from here had an office down the street.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They had seen it all happen.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  But, uh, no, but as far as -- well, I don't know.
R:  I didn't know anybody that was either in the planes or in the towers or even saw it happen at all so -- which I guess is a good thing.
L:  Now, you know, this -- this guy that was in town.  Everybody was talking about his grandson being on the -- on the one plane and, uh, I wanted to see him on TV when they had him on TV.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, because when he was here in town, it was back, I guess, when I just, uh, was young because ...
