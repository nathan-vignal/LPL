L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, this is Maureen.
R:  Hi, this is Anita.
L:  Hi, nice to meet you, Anita.
R:  Nice to meet you.  [LAUGH]  
L:  You too.  
R:  This your first call?
L:  My second.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, this is my first.
L:  Okay, well, I had another one earlier tonight, so --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- it's kinda breaking in gradually.
R:  Yeah.  So, we're supposed to talk about airport security.
L:  Airport security.
R:  I don't know.  I -- [LAUGH] I've been kinda nervous about it ever since the terrorist, you know about flying.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  Um, ever since the, uh, you know September eleventh thing.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  What about you?  Are you a easy flier or a --
L:  Um, yeah, I think so.  I would.
R:  Yeah
L:  I -- I'd get on a plane in a heartbeat.
R:  Yeah, well I have to get on one next week, so [LAUGH] I've gotta get on there.
L:  Oh really, where you going?
R:  To Denver.
L:  Oh wow, from ...?
R:  From, um, Maryland.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so you're probably pretty nervous?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I guess, you know, I felt -- I always thought of ways that they could, um, you know, bomb planes before.  I guess I'm kinda paranoid like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then after that happened, wow.
L:  Well, does the heightened security make you feel more comfortable about it?
R:  Um, [SIGH] yeah, yeah it does.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I just -- I'm really a lot more comfortable now that they got these, um, [LIPSMACK] the machines that screen for bombs.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And all the luggage.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I think that, you know, that's one of the things I thought about, you know that would be easy to do.  
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause, you know, they didn't -- they don't ever screen all of them, but ....
L:  Right.  But now they do, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, they just started.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It does make me feel better.  But I guess I'm just you know a nervous flier anyway so ...
L:  Yeah, have you flown much?
R:  Um, yeah, I mean, well, maybe about thirty or forty times.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was real nervous when I first started, and then it just kinda got you routine.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Until this happened, and then I started thinking, "er".
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, what about you?
L:  Well [MN] no I -- my very first time I flew I was a nervous wreck --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, um, since then I found out how easy it is, I just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's so much easier than going any other way.
R:  Yeah, it's like taking the bus.
L:  Right, and I believe that when your time is up your time is up,
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, no matter where you are.
R:  There's just nothing you can do, right?
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right, right and I would not want to go that way.
R:  Right.
L:  But if it happened, it happened.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think the heightened security, uh, almost doesn't ease my mind --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because you know you get crackpots out there that are going to try to break the system.
R:  Right, try to break through.
L:  It's like hackers on computers.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, you tell them they can't do it. 
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  And they're gonna find a way.
R:  It's a challenge.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's like a challenge to 'em.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and the fact that I haven't flown since nine eleven --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but how long it takes now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, from start to finish, from the time you have to be at the airport and go through all this and ...
R:  Yeah.  I flew, let's see, last year about this time --
L:  Uh-huh
R:  -- I flew like five or six times and that was my first time be- since --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the terrorist thing and I mean, it didn't take that -- I mean, the worst of it was over, you know it didn't take that long.
L:  Right.
R:  It was a lot better then I had thought it would be.
L:  Right.
R:  But, now, I don't know now that they put these Federal um -- Federal inspectors in, how different it is.
L:  Right.  Right, I --
R:  I always get stopped anyway.  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you?  [LAUGH]
R:  I always get my bag searched for bomb -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know why.
L:  Yeah, does it make you nervous?
R:  No, I mean, I --
L:  Is it like being --
R:  -- know I don't have any bombs so.
L:  Yeah, I know. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But to be singled out is like ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  No, I mean I don't -- I don't know why.  I don't know, maybe I just, uh, you know it's every fifth person and I just coincidently keep being the fifth person.
L:  That fifth person.
R:  You never know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Now, I don't know I think if they really want to do it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's gonna be done.
R:  Yeah, of course.
L:  No matter how much they heighten the security.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean you can always come up with [NOISE] some creative way --
L:  Right.
R:  Especially when they keep publicizing exactly what they're checking for.
L:  Exac- yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  And you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what they're doing exactly.  They know exactly what they're doing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And ...
R:  And people keep getting through, like all these newspaper reporters keep getting through with guns and knives.
L:  Right.
R:  And --
L:  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  And like I said before, as far as, just like computer hackers ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they gonna, you know ...
R:  Yeah, well that's what -- I mean, you know, not that I would do this, but if I were a terrorist -- I used to live in Colorado right next to one of the air traffic control centers.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, so in that building there's maybe a hundred, a hundred and fifty controllers with all the air space over --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, I don't know how many square mile area from Denver to Kansas City.
L:  Right.
R:  I just -- and there was a little airport near there.  I'd just fly into that thing.
L:  Right.
R:  And knock a hundred controllers off the air at once.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I mean, there's always something you can do if you're evil.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know.
L:  And -- and all this terrorist at the airport --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- may stop them from boarding the planes --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and causing the terror, but like you said, "Look at these towers".
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, they're pretty much wide open.
R:  Mhm.
L:  To get to 'em, um.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I deliver mail.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  I'm a mail carrier and we had a concern with -- we have a mail truck that goes right to that tower --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in our town --
R:  Right.
L:  -- every day.
R:  Right.
L:  Now, our mail trucks aren't secured.
R:  What town are you in?
L:  At night.  In Maine.
R:  In Maine, okay.
L:  Yeah, [inaudible] Maine.  Our mail truck's not secured at night.
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  You know, who's to stop somebody --
R:  Someone could out something in it and --
L:  Exactly.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you know if they really want to do it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They can do it.
R:  Unless we have a police state where everyone gets searched all the time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- some things are always going to get through.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You can catch some of them, but you know something eventually is going to happen if they want it to --
L:  If they want it.
R:  -- and I guess you can't just -- worrying about it is not really going to help, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  I think you need to work more on relations --
R:  Right.
L:  -- with other countries and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And less on, uh, I don't know, in your face type of --
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  But, so, anyway I think this is interesting.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what was your other topic before this?
L:  Same thing.
R:  Oh, airport security.
L:  Yeah, same thing,
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But it was with a gentleman,
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it was very strained, you know --
R:  Oh really?
L:  It was -- he was having a hard time talking to me --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I was having a hard time talking to him.
R:  Right.
L:  And I wonder if that isn't what they're doing, trying to --
R:  Where was he from?
L:  Uh, Iowa.
R:  Okay, I think they're putting different -- because I'm from Georgia originally, 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You're in Maine, 
L:  Yeah.
R:  He's in the mid west.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're probably hooking up people with different accents to get us to talk about the same thing.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Like, if I say airplane and you say airplane, then it can tell -- oh, this person sounds different than this but they both are saying airplane.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right, and I think to see how well people relate to each other.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know it's been easy --
R:  Total strangers.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- talking -- yeah, it's been easy talking to you where it was strained talking to him.
R:  Well, guys aren't very good on the phone anyway I think.
L:  No, they're not.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  They just sit there and you have to ask you know, well ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ask a question and they go yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, unless he's my twenty one year old son, then he's got a growth on his ear.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh yeah?  [LAUGH]
L:  But ...
R:  That's like my brother won't -- I mean, he's terrible on the phone.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean he's my brother, I've known him my whole life and [NOISE] he's just you know ask him a question, yeah, everything's fine.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My dad's the same way, so ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah that's how most men are.  They just don't ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.
R:  Don't have any verbal ability.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, apprehensive.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I guess if we are done talking about security
R:  Uh-huh .
L:  That we can just ...
R:  We just hang up?
L:  That's the end of it, yeah.
R:  Okay, I didn't know, I thought maybe we're supposed to talk for a certain amount of time and then it would go boop.
L:  No, nobody --
R:  You're all done.
L:  -- nobody ever said anything and --
R:  Oh, okay, so that's what you all did last time, just done talking?
L:  Yeah, this guy, that was his second call and he said that's all they did, they talked for a little while --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and that's that.
R:  All right, well, Maureen right?
L:  Yeah, Maureen.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It was nice to talk to you.
R:  It was nice to talk to you.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, you take care. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, you too.  Bye bye.
L:  Bye bye.
