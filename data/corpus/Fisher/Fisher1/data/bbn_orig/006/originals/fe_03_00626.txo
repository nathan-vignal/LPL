L:  Hi.  My name is Dee.
R:  How're you doing, Dee?
L:  I'm fine.  How are you?
R:  Good.  I'm fine.  Um, gosh, you go ahead first [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm gonna put the hot potato in your lap [LAUGH].
L:  Well, thanks [LAUGH].  Is this the first time you've done this?
R:  Yes [LAUGH].
L:  Y- Yes, me too.
R:  Okay, well -- [SIGH]
L:  Well, I guess -- w -- well what do you think is the most important quality?
R:  I would say, you know, honesty and integrity.
L:  Yes, that was my first choice, honesty.
R:  Okay.  Uh --
L:  Definitely.
R:  Do they go on and keep asking -- oh, well you haven't done this either.  I don't know if they -- if they just want our input and they keep asking us questions or --
L:  I think they just expect us to -- to talk about it and discuss it.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, that -- that was just the one question to kinda get us going [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.  Well, I do, um, I do believe honesty, you know.
L:  Yes, I think so.  You -- you can't have any kind of a relationship without that.
R:  Really.  Um, above and beyond and at my age now which I am, forty six, that's more important than ever.  Um, you know, twenty years ago I guess it didn't mean -- you know, you thought or I thought it meant a whole lot but it really didn't.
L:  Yeah.  It -- I think so at that age you don't realize that until you are older.
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  Yeah, well I'm forty one and I've been with my partner now be six years next month.
R:  How many?
L:  Six years --
R:  Oh, wow.  Okay.
L:  -- next month.  Mhm.
R:  And, um, I'm on my second marriage but I've been with my spouse now about almost sixteen years.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's good.
R:  It was, you know, it was a very good move on my part, um, and, you know, it was the best thing I ever did and there is a lot of honesty and [MN] you know, trust which is another thing.  Um, there was not a whole lot of trust in my first marriage --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so and that was mostly on my, you know, spouse's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- behalf, not mine.  Okay.
L:  He did -- he didn't trust you?
R:  No, he didn't trust me but I was so young and he just -- he was an abuser and, um, you know, I think he was one of those want to take control type people that you hear about on Oprah and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- Doctor Phil.
L:  It's funny -- it's funny you should say that.  My last one was exactly like that.
R:  Really?
L:  Yes.  Yes.  Verbal -- verbal abuser.
R:  Well, mine was verbal and physical and, um, I just -- after my first son was born, I had to get out of there because, you know, I didn't -- I didn't want my child to see that even though he was only two at the time.  You know, they pick up on stuff like that.
L:  Yeah, it's amazing what they do pick up on.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [MN] They say it's about three when they first start getting their memories that they can remember when they're adults.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  So, --
R:  That's what I've heard.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he turned out -- he's twenty one now --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and he's turned out to be a great kid, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then I had a child with my husband now and he's fourteen.  [MN] I don't think he'd realize anything.  He's just --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- go, go, go, you know [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, he's at that age.
R:  Oh, my Lord, God! [MN]
L:  Well, my husband has, uh, two boys from a previous marriage.  They're, um, nine and twelve --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we have had our first child together three years ago.  
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh, so you got a little one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is it a little boy or a little girl?
L:  It's a little girl so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- he finally -- he finally got a little girl.
R:  Oh, how sweet.
L:  So, yeah we're real happy.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  Yeah.  Yep, I found a good one this time.
R:  Yeah, you know, and, um, statistics, you know, because I do watch a lot of TV, they say, you know, if you've been with an abuser the first time, it's always gonna happen again and again.  And luckily, I guess for the both of us, that did not happen.
L:  Mhm
R:  You know.
L:  Me neither.
R:  Um, so I feel very fortunate with that.  You know, I was very picky.  After I got my divorce I was, you know -- it was, like, I was not gonna go out with just anybody or, you know, I was just very skeptical.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah, I was gonna take off and live in a monastery [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I felt like I needed to --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know, to get my sanity --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or whatever, um, but, you know, it turned out to be great.  I mean, of course, there's your rocky times and your good times but now it's just like everything is good so ...
L:  Mhm.  Well, once you get to know that person really well, y- that makes all the difference but it takes a long time.
R:  Oh, it does.
L:  It really does.
R:  It does.  Um, you know, reflecting back now, I don't -- I mean, I don't condone people to get married, you know, after they've known somebody for a year or, you know, six months or whatever but it takes -- it's like you said, it's takes so much longer --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to get to know and to trust somebody because they can cover up for years --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know, their own traits --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- and personalities.
L:  Yeah, discovered that with the last one.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  It took a while [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I was with mine for, uh -- well, I was eighteen when I first got with him and he was ten years older and, um, I should have known that from the get go, but I was too naive and young, I guess, immature --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to realize it and it took, you know, a good eight, ten years to figure out, "Hey, I don't need to be here".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then another kid later -- you know, a kid later and he'd already been married, had two kids and -- [MN]
L:  Yeah, gosh, I -- I guess I was lucky.  I'd -- I'd never wanted to have kids with -- with my last one.
R:  Oh, you're luck- -- well, mine kinda just happened.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I, um -- we were still just living together and I got pregnant and my mother was kinda like, "You'd better get married" type thing and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it was like, "Okay".  "Be good to yourself.  Do the right thing" and then when she found out what was going on, she was like "Oh, I'm so sorry".
L:  Oh, no.  Mhm.
R:  So ...  But, you know, you always learn from your experiences, too.  I have no -- at this point of my life, I have nothing negative to even say about him.  Um, I got a great child out it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, he's a very good -- he's a hard worker, he's a good worker.  He, you know, loves his mom [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.  Well, that's good.
R:  -- which is great, you know, so ...
L:  Yeah.  Funny, you're talking about your -- your previous husband being ten years older.  Mine was fourteen years older [NOISE].
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] So, I wonder maybe just the, um -- such a big gap in the ages.  I don't know.
R:  [MN] Well, I know for me I was very insecure.  Um, my parents were divorced when I was very young and [MN] you know, I didn't have my dad around as much as I wanted to and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, my mom was dating somebody else so, you know, she wasn't around.  So, I figure that's probably what my thing was.
L:  Yeah.  Well, my parents were divorced when I was three --
R:  Yeah.
L:   -- and I -- I come from Scotland --
R:  Oh, really?
L:   -- and my father was -- my father was American.  I've lived here for eleven years now.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and when I -- when I was three, my mother took my sister and I back to Scotland so I don't know.  Maybe, just needing another father figure I guess [LAUGH] maybe that's what it was.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Being the older -- older guy.
L:  Mhm.  But I did have a stepfather and he's wonderful.  Um, he came into my life when I was about four.
R:  [MN] Well, that's great.
L:  But I guess, not -- not quite the same as your -- your own father at the time but not until you look back --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, that I realized that he was more of a father than my real father was.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, we would get a Christmas card and a birthday card with twenty dollars in it every year and that was about the only contact that we ever had with him.
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  So, yep.
R:  Well, I had a stepdad too but he was not [MN].  I did not like him and, um, even when my mom passed away several years ago -- it's been about eleven, twelve years now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my sister ended up keeping in contact with him and, um, it really kinda irritates me or irritated me and then he passed away last year and my sister kept saying, "Are you not gonna go even talk to him?" and it's like, "No" [MN].
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, he left my mom when she had breast cancer and he was living with another woman --
L:  Gosh.
R:  -- you know.  I don't find that --
L:  No.
R:  -- a good attribute, you know [LAUGH].
L:  No, no [LAUGH].
R:  So, we've -- you know [MN] I just say -- you know, it was like "Uh-uh.  No way" 
L:  No.
R:  So ...
L:  I guess it would be different if it was your real father.   You know, you might have that kinda connection there but --
R:  Oh, I think so.
L:   -- you would, you know --
R:  You'd still be mad but it -- it'd still --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- be your real dad, you know --.
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so to speak.  Your -- the guy that brought you into the world --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so to speak.  Okay.  I'm reading over this thing now and see how long or what we're supposed to do.
L:  I do -- I -- I need to go back onto the website and print it out.  I didn't.  I don't think there's any minimum time we're supposed to discuss it, I guess.
R:  [MN] I don't know.  I got a call last night and I could not find my email to get my PIN number.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  So, I couldn't even participate.  It was like "Oh, my God".  I kept putting on that thirty second thing --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and even tonight was looking around going, "Oh, my God, where is it?" and I finally found it.
L:  [LAUGH] I stuck mine to the back of my cellphone because on the weekend I'm in and out of the house so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I put ...
