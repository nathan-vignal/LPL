L:  Hi.  I'm Sue from, uh, Syracuse New York.
R:  Hi.  I'm Donna from New Jersey.  How're you doing?
L:  Good, thank you.  How about you?
R:  Oh, I'm doing okay.  What -- now we have to talk about, uh --
L:  Security.
R:  -- heightened security.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I just -- actually I was checking, uh, the, uh, price of tickets on line because I was planning for a trip in May and I just found a price hike due to the -- well, so called, uh, height -- heightened security [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's right.  Now, we had -- the government had to, uh, put in people and pay them a higher wage so that they'd --
L:  I think they also had some kind --
R:  -- do a better job.
L:  -- of state of the art of technology.
R:  Oh, was that what it was?
L:  Yeah.  That's very expensive.
R:  Yes.  So, you think this is gonna, uh, lessen the, uh, chance of attack in the air.
L:  Mhm.  I don't really know but well, better safe than sorry, I guess.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I think, uh, I think it will make it more difficult to achieve but I don't know if it can stop because, uh --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- I, uh, uh, took a plane --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- this past April --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to Texas from New Jersey --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Philadelphia International Airport and, uh, we put our bags through the scan, you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, I had a -- a nail clippers and they went through just fine --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then on the way back, uh, we had, uh, cho- uh, we had our tickets that we used to -- to get to Texas and accidentally gave those to the man to look at --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he let us right on through --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- without valid tickets so, uh, we brought this to his attention and he was very upset, you know.
L:  Hm.
R:  He was very upset that he had allowed this to happen, you know.
L:  Yeah, but I guess it really depends on the locality, like when I was flying to Chicago in November, last November, I -- I think I got nothing wrong with me but I always got checked when I went through that security door, it always bingoed and so the security staff just checked me in and out but nothing was found.
R:  Oh, so it malfunctioned.
L:  Yeah, well it -- I guess it's like, uh, they have a false negative and a false positive.
R:  [MN] Oh, gee [LAUGH].  Oh, gee [MN].
L:  So, kind of I don't like to travel by the air very much now.  It just, uh -- well, and it's like people are lining up just because of the security checks because it takes longer than before.
R:  Yes, a lot longer.
L:  Yeah, especially like for a city of Syracuse where there is only one gate open and everybody's lined up there.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, my.  Yeah, I'm not su- I -- I -- I think what -- what all this heightened security does is it's going to make anyone who wants to do something wrong --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- a little wiser about how they can get away with it but I know personally, myself --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that I very easily well could -- was carrying a sharp object --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and got away with it and then on the way home boarded a plane without having to use my tickets.
L:  Wow.  You saved --
R:  So, uh --
L:  -- some money [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].  Well, the ticket was already --
L:  Well essentially you could [LAUGH].
R:  -- paid for.  Yeah, you know, so I guess if you want to do it, you're gonna do it.  Like the -- the man who had the bomb --
L:  Yeah, that -- that's what --
R:  -- in his shoe.
L:  -- I think, you know.  Like if -- if you hire a security guard, it -- he could only prevent, you know, the normal people not the thieves [LAUGH].
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  Like in a bank.  That's all would happen.
R:  Yes, that's all that happens.  Yeah, so I hope, uh -- I don't know, I hope it works out.  I --
L:  But I think it's like a pose that you have to take to show that, uh, we have the determination to achieve this.  So, --
R:  Oh, yes. You have to take --
L:  -- you cannot just sit there and, you know, do nothing.  As a political move, this is pretty wise.
R:  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  This has to be done.  It has to be done.
L:  Otherwise the voters would just be mad at them.
R:  [LAUGH] The voters would be mad.  You know, I -- with all this heightened security I don't remember them announcing that they actually caught any terrorists.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  I'm not sure.
R:  I know there were a couple of people that were arrested in Florida but it turned out that they weren't, um, terrorists at all.  I think maybe what we should concentrate on is making sure our pilots are not inebriated.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well [LAUGH] ...
R:  A lot of drunk pilots any more.
L:  Oh, oh.  Well, that's --
R:  Right?
L:  -- too bad.
R:  They are.  I mean, two more.  Uh, two weeks ago two more were caught drunk and I don't know if this is a new thing or it's just people are more aware of it or --
L:  It's a -- this is a plot or they're just --
R:  Or they're drinking because they're --
L:  -- alcoholics.
R:  -- nervous because they do have to fly a plane.
L:  I don't think so.  Well, I don't think they're trained to behave like this.  I mean, to drink alcohol to make it -- to solve the nervousness.  No, no way.
R:  Well, I -- I don't think they trained 'em that way but I wouldn't be surprised if there are a lot of nervous pilots --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they want to carry guns and, oh gee.  It's a mess.  I have to take a flight --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- next month to Florida and I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- not looking forward to it.  I'm trying to think of a way to not possibly -- I could take a train.  We --
L:  Hm.  That's too --
R:  -- could drive.
L:  -- long. 
R:  But the time, yeah, the time you spent -- you lose, you know, it's --
L:  Yeah, actually, you know, last winter I met a guy in Amtrak.  I was taking Amtrak just from New York to Boston so it's pretty close but that guy was traveling from Arizona to New York.
R:  Wow.
L:  On the Amtrak train.
R:  Wow.
L:  I think he spent a couple of nights on the train as well --
R:  I'm sure he did.
L:  -- as well as three days and he said he just hated, you know, the security check.
R:  [MN] On the train?
L:  [LAUGH] Well, no, on the -- on the -- on the f- he doesn't -- he didn't take a plane because of the security checks.
R:  Oh --
L:  So, and he -- he thought it might be safer to take the train.
R:  It might be safer but he sure --
L:  It's too slow.
R:  -- did spend a lot of time to avoid a security check [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean a security check delays you --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- but not for three days.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I mean [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's not a good reason [LAUGH].
L:  And it's -- well, it's much more comfortable --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you stay for three days in the air- airport hotel than on the Amtrak train [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, gee.  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  And the Amtrak trains aren't so safe anymore anyway.
L:  No.
R:  It's all getting old.  The rails are old and --
L:  And they were always late.  They were never, never on time.
R:  I've taken an --
L:  Well, I just take it like once or twice and every time I discover something new and horrible [LAUGH].
R:  It was horrible?
L:  It was.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Last time, it was, I guess, three or four hours late.  The original journey was only six hours but it was four hours late so we traveled ten hours.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  It was horrible, so --
R:  Oh my [LAUGH].
L:  -- if I could I would -- I'd -- I'd rather go through the security door [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, it's not difficult to do.
L:  I guess if you're not taking an international airliners it wouldn't be that [MN] uh, it wouldn't have a high possibility of, you know, getting really bad 'cause they only hijack those long distance flights.
R:  Mhm.  Let me think.
L:  Because they need enough oil, enough gas in -- in the engine -- for the engine if they want to really go somewhere.
R:  That's true, unless they carry a bomb.
L:  Oh, a bomb --
R:  They then --
L:  -- will not go through the security door.
R:  Well, how did the bomb go through -- the plastic explosive go through when the man had it in his shoe.
L:  Yeah, that's why when I went through the security door, that, uh -- that the device just bingoed and they just check my shoes and I was so surprised why they were focusing on my shoes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because of the man with the shoe bomb.
L:  Yeah, because I didn't think of that at the time and I was so surprised --
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  -- because the lady said, "You just please take off your shoes".
R:  Mhm.  So, you could have had it in your hair.
L:  [MN] Oh, they didn't check my hair though and actually when I -- I remember once my luggage was also checked but the min- the man didn't really take notice.  He just, um, rifled through very, very quickly and said, "Okay, it's fine.  Just go".
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I guess I -- if I really have something inside, I might still be able to take it with me.
R:  Yes.
L:  Because they didn't really check, you know, in details.
R:  No, no and can you imagine ...
