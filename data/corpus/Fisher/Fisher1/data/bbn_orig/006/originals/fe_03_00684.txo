L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  This is Joey.
R:  My name's Cindy.
L:  How you doing?
R:  Fine.
L:  [MN] Uh, I don't know, what do you think?
R:  Uh.
L:  I think it's helping.
R:  Yeah, I think it helps.
L:  But, it might be a little bit too strict.
R:  Um, yeah, I don't think I am gonna want them going through my bags.
L:  Oh, your bags and they can strip search you, or at least get you down to your underwear.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like people have hardware in their body from surgery or something.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, 'cause I work in the medical field and, you know, I know patients who have pace makers and, um, you know, metal heart valves and, you know, stuff that they can't take out.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And prove.  But, um you know, I don't mind them xraying my bags and stuff but I don't want them opening up and going through all my stuff.
L:  Yeah, I heard that recently that they -- actually they x-ray your stored pad- your stored baggage.
R:  What, the overhead baggage?
L:  No, the stuff that goes on -- in the belly.
R:  Huh?
L:  Um, not your carry on but your ... baggage that you check.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And they're going to start checking that stuff and opening it up if they want to.
R:  I guess in case somebody carries a bomb on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  Yeah, and you know, some of the stuff they can do is ridiculous.  You know, like a nail file.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or you can't have a plastic knife to cut your meat.
L:  [MN]  Okay, well, make it a little bit tender.
R:  You know?  [LAUGH]  Some of it does get to the point of being a little too much.
L:  Oh it's redundant.  It's like anything ...
R:  I think that sometimes if the terrorists are going to do it, they're gonna find a way anyway.
L:  Yeah
R:  I mean ...
L:  This is to de- to deter the Joe on the block -- [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- from trying to pull a prank or something.  [NOISE]  I'm not real sure. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, I like it.  I haven't flown since then but I don't fly that much.
R:  No, I actually don't like to fly much anyway.
L:  [NOISE]  Okay.  [NOISE]
R:  I actually have a fear of flying myself, but ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, my parents are going up to California tomorrow, so ...[NOISE]
R:  And they haven't flown since then either?
L:  No.
R:  No.  I think it would be more scary now.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh, I'm just not sure what's going to happen tomorrow.  [NOISE]  It's like, their flight's in the morning, I mean six forty AM.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they still have to be there ninety minutes early.  [NOISE]
R:  How many?
L:  Ninety.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [NOISE]  This is a small town in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
R:  Yeah.  I live in a big city.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  Houston.
L:  Houston, I've been there.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was stationed in, uh, Portford[?], Texas, for a while.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Then over to Galveston,
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, God that was ninety ... that was in ninety two when I was in Houston.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's a pretty nice place.  Always something's going on.
R:  Yeah, there is.  
L:  [MN]
R:  But, um, you know ... I don't know.  The president's speaking tonight, too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I'm just watching him.  [NOISE]
R:  I don't want to watch it.  I think he's lost focus on what he's supposed to be doing.
L:  Yeah, he's talking about cutting all this, but he wants to spend billions of dollars a day to go to war.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, with Iraq.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, again.  [NOISE]
R:  You know, it's like, uh, did we forget who bomb- you know who blew up our airport -- airplanes?
L:  [NOISE]  Huh, yeah.
R:  That's where the focus is supposed to be.
L:  Yeah, it's like he's -- well maybe he thinks they're behind it or something, I don't know.
R:  Well, I thought he was from the beginning, but anyways nobody cared about my opinion, but ...
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, I'd hate to see them troops go back over there again.
R:  Well, there's terrorists everywhere.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it's like, are we going to go to war with every single country that has terrorists?  You know, we can't do that.  We're not big enough to have a war with every single country.
L:  Well, it's like the fight we -- Russia was our main problem.
R:  Oh, they're -- there's -- they're nothing now.
L:  Yeah, now we have to have had something to fight for, with or over.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But now it's terrorists.
R:  But you know, until it happens here in this country, you know, when there is a war on our land, it's gonna be another story.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you know, when it comes down to that, or it's going to be a very sad day.  [MN]
L:  Well, the thing about terrorism then, I mean it's not like a regular front line battle.
R:  No.  It's anybody.  [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Children, women, anybody.  Innocent people, you know.
L:  No.  I think security is a good thing.
R:  Yeah, they need to have heightened security, but you know, why weren't they doing it before all this stuff?  Why did it take an act like that [NOISE] for them to say, "Hey, wait a minute, we need more security"?
L:  Well, that's the way people -- that's the way we are, we are like --
R:  True.
L:  We don't take action until it affects us.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] You say, "Okay, uh, I'm gonna quit smoking 'cause somebody I know died".  I don't care --
R:  Oh, some people don't even do that.
L:  Right.  I don't care if somebody died [NOISE] in a different country whatever it's when it hits home brings the realism closer.  [SIGH]  Uh, how long have you been doing this?
R:  This is my first one.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  This is my first night, my third call.
R:  Oh, is it?
L:  But my first night.
R:  Uh-huh.  What happened with your other calls?
L:  Oh, the same thing, talked about airport security.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So, I don't know if I'm gonna ... if I'm going to get paid for each one, or ...
R:  Oh.  So, you just talked about the same thing, three times?
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, yep.
R:  That's weird.
L:  'Cause, uh, well there was a gal in ... Missouri, a gal in Maine, now I got one in Texas.
R:  [LAUGH]  So, um, oh you know, it's weird.  I didn't know that.
L:  Oh, that works, you know, keep -- keep coming.  Myself, I just got laid off the first of the year.
R:  Oh, really.  Actually, I've been out of work since uh, last June.
L:  Oh, damn.
R:  Well, I've been working temporary but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's tough all over.
L:  Yeah, 'cause I just, I had an inter- like a job interview or something down at the community college, and they said that all the funds from the national were used up.  You know, my company funds were used up so I can't get no edu- or try to further my education through them.  I have to pay for them out of my pocket.
R:  [MN]  Yeah, people are getting laid off everywhere.
L:  Yeah.  [MN]  And he's talking about cutting taxes.  Mm, that'd be great, and he's -- he's --
R:  Too little, too late.
L:  I remember when he was elected, one of his sayings was, "A job for every person that wanted a job".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He just said that again.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, where at?  Burger King?
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause Burger King ain't gonna pay my rent.
L:  No, not five -- five something an hour.
R:  No.  Doesn't even gonna get it.
L:  That would barely cover my trip payment.  [LAUGH]
R:  Nor mine either.  Very strange.  How did you hear about that -- that Fisher[?] place?
L:  Oh, my wife was -- she's on it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, I don't know, she's [SIGH] -- she logged me and it's, like, I'm getting all the calls.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  She's done two or three.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [MN].
R:  Does she get 'em in the same night, or ...?
L:  No.  Well -- I, er -- hers was, uh, if you were a lot -- which -- what was your favorite holiday?
R:  [MN]
L:  And if you had your choice to make a holiday, what would it be?
R:  Mhm.
R:  I like that one.
L:  So, okay that was a simple one.
R:  I like that one.
L:  [MN] [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  That's a good one.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  So, what's your weather like?  [MN]
R:  Um, today it was, like, almost seventy degrees.
L:  Uh, must be nice.
R:  Last Thursday it was twenty four.
L:  Well, on Thursday we were probably about minus ten.
R:  Oh, jeeze.
L:  Today we warmed up to twenty four and we got snow.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, about two inches.
R:  Well, we are battling the, um, sickness of allergy and sinus problems here.
L:  Oh.
R:  Because we are going from seventy degree weather to twenty four degree weather.
L:  That's hard on a body.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, yeah, I just battled for five days --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- worth of sinus problems.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH] Big temperature change like that'll screw everybody up.
R:  Yeah, I was, like, you know, our bodies weren't designed to do this.
L:  Nope.
R:  [LAUGH]  Seventy degrees and in two days it's twenty four degrees.  [LAUGH]
L:  Damn.  Hear of getting down to fr- -- Yeah, they got down to freezing as well as the --
R:  Though, I don't think we're supposed to do that.
L:  'Cause, when I --
