L:  Hello.  I'm Ronald Henderson.
R:  Hi.  I'm Gaylor Kaiser.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  You know what the topic is [MN]?
R:  It's about, um, airport security and if, um, they think that the heightened, um, security will keep from, I guess, the terrorists from attacking again.
L:  Yeah, I'm not sure how much height- heightened security they actually have at this point.  They have --
R:  I don't --
L:  -- substantial amount around trying to, uh, check people as they get on -- on the plane --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, uh, that's about all I know, um, that they are doing.  Um, maybe they are also securing the perimeters more, uh.
R:  I don't really know, um, and I think that they are checking -- checking people and luggage more.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Though I don't really -- I don't really know, you know.
L:  O- One of the things I know that they have done is changed all those jobs to be federal jobs.
R:  Yeah, I -- I knew about that.
L:  And I'm not sure how much help that has been from the sense of -- of really making a difference.  It certainly increased the cost of running that job.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's made more jobs that are a livable wage --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as opposed to people that were on a job that wasn't a livable wage before.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, having them do the job should be better.
R:  Yeah, I -- I would think if -- I would think if the government was doing it now that it ought to be better.
L:  [LAUGH] I am not really sure of that though.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I spent a lot of time in the DC area --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and working with different government agencies in the past and so, uh, um, my experience of that does not give me the greatest, uh, amount of confidence.  It's almost like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- my experience of being in the National Guards --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and seeing those big billboards that said, "Sleep well.  Your National Guard is awake".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Does not make me feel real comfortable [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Well, let's hope they do a better job.
L:  Yep.
R:  So, but no I, um -- I really don't know how much it's really improved.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know here in Mustek[?] you have to get there like two hours earlier.
L:  Yeah.  Where are you at?
R:  In Oklahoma.
L:  Oklahoma?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Right.  I'm out here in Pennsylvania so --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- it's a long ways away.  Um, but I, um -- I got through fairly quickly the only time we've flown lately.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It was -- but we went in and out of the Leha[?] Valley International Airport which is a fairly close airport in here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they, um -- the, uh, first leg of our flight was actually a -- a bus ride into Newark --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then when we got to Newark they just ran us right on through.
R:  Huh.
L:  It was rather very quickly, um, so I don't -- I hadn't really noticed a lot of difference in that situation.  Have you flown any lately?
R:  No.  My sister has and, um, that -- she says that they haven't really, I mean -- it's about the same, she said other than she has to get there a little bit earlier.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, they -- I think they still -- I think they check her luggage and stuff.
L:  Mhm [MN].
R:  But she hasn't really -- I mean, she hasn't really told me, you know, that there's any new --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- anything new really.
L:  Not anything new about the --
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  -- security there.  Uh --
R:  No.
L:  -- with government employees or no government employees.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Probably hasn't changed much of anything.  Has it scared you more to fly?
R:  Not really.
L:  No.
R:  Not really.  I think --
L:  Me either.
R:  -- I think that, um -- I think that it could happen again.  I mean, I don't -- it don't really scare me.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, I guess they could -- I -- I guess it could happen on a bus or a train just as easily.
L:  Right.  Anywhere where there's a large crowd of people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, the thing that was so different about nine eleven is that they were actually using those planes as bombs.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That was a very different situation [MN].  So, what do you think of the whole homeland securities department?
R:  Oh, I don't --
L:  Putting all those agencies together.
R:  Oh, I don't know.
L:  [MN] And their new rules in order to make sure that everybody's safe.  I guess that's part of that is even at the airport now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You're supposed to leave your luggage open --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so that people can get into it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh.
R:  I don't know, I think -- I think there's -- there's a lot of improvement that needs to be done.
L:  What would you suggest?
R:  Oh, they def- well, I think -- I think one good thing would be to -- to train the, um -- the, um, the stewardess and the, um, pilots and all that and you know, give them some training or give them some leeway of, you know, what they can and -- you know, what they can do.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, I wouldn't -- I wouldn't say give 'em guns or anything like that but I don't -- I don't mean -- it may come to that but I don't know.
L:  You don't think that they should have guns?
R:  I've -- not, not right now.  Now, if we go to war I might change my -- my mind.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, right now it's kind of -- yeah, I think if they do give 'em guns then they should make sure that they're trained and everything.
L:  Yeah, I think there's a real difference between allowing them to have guns, uh, and insisting that they carry a gun.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think those are two different kinds of, uh, pictures with all of that from a security standpoint.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Frankly, personally, I wouldn't have any problem with 'em having guns.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I, uh, I don't think that the guns are what's dangerous.  I think what's dangerous is people, you know, using 'em for bad things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh --
R:  Well, I think my biggest concern would be if they -- if they weren't trained properly --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then someone might be able, you know, to take it away from 'em or whatever and, you know, so I don't -- I'm kind of iffy on that -- on that part.
L:  So, you concern would be that they could safely take care of the gun.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I can understand that.  I'd -- do most people in -- in Oklahoma carry guns or have guns or ...?
R:  Yeah.
L:  There are a lot of guns you sort of holding there right?
R:  Yeah, we have a, um -- we actually have a, um -- they started a concealed, um, weapon law.  You have to register it and -- well, they always had to do that and, um, you can carry it concealed if you have a -- I guess, like a concealed weapon certificate or something like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm not really sure.
L:  Yeah.  What else do you think we should be doing for airport security?
R:  Oh, well, I know, um, at the, um, main airport here they have it where you can't, um -- used to you could park in front of the airport and now you have to go park.  I think that's a good idea.  Um, just, um -- I -- I think they need to look more and be more cautious.  I've heard -- I've heard like on the news people passing security and all that.  I think they need to look more -- look more at their security and ...
L:  Just try to do whatever they can do to make it better.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Mhm.  So, how important is security compared to convenience?
R:  I think I would rather, um -- I think that security would be more important.  Um, at least that way we knew that, you know, we'd be safe and ...
L:  How much are you willing to allow the government to, uh, really have access to your life in order to be more secure, 'cause that's one of the things that's happening with, uh, the whole homeland securities rules and regulations is that we're moving more into an era of where, uh, the government has, you know, doing all kinds of tracking stuff on people.
R:  Yeah, I think -- I think that we've, you know, we -- we still need, you know, we still need that privacy.  Um, I don't know.  I guess it would depend on the situation. I don't, you know -- I don't know.  I think -- I think that we still -- you know, we still need privacy --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- so I don't know.
L:  Mhm.
