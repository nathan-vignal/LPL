L:  Hi, I'm Laura Atkins.
R:  Hi, I'm Sandy Reid.
L:  Okay, we supposed to talk now?
R:  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible]
R:  [LAUGH] It just says introduce yourself, that's all they said.
L:  Okay.
R:  So.
L:  Um, what can we do to prevent?  [SIGH]  Um, start checking.
R:  And have better control.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, as a matter fact, um they -- you know how they put sanction against oil and things like that, why can't we have sanction [NOISE] against these kinda chemical.  [NOISE]
L:  Mhm
R:  Going into the wrong hands.
L:  Right.
R:  So.
L:  I mean, chemicals as far as [NOISE] would it be like the +smox- -- smallpox.
R:  Biological, chemical [NOISE] you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Any kind, um ...
L:  So, like the, uh, the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- anthrax or whatever 
R:  Right, right.  So --
L:  Yeah, they could have prevented that, I mean sooner than they did.
R:  Yeah, especially we have control on import export.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know and we have so much government controlling on everything so why can't they do that?
L:  Right.  And the way they fixed it this time was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- microwave the meal, basically.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it stopped it from, um, doing any damage.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] They could do stuff like that.
R:  Oh, I'm sure there is way they that they could control, [NOISE] have better control.  Like say with technology as great as they are.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  I don't see any reason why it wouldn't.
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  Do you think going to war is one of the way to stop it.
L:  No.  I mean, it's -- it's basically just a -- our technology has gotten so bad that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they can do warfare with chemicals --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- without actually throwing a bomb.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And basically that's -- basically we are at war.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I know I'm afraid.
R:  Oh yeah definitely.
L:  And it is a way of war is scaring the people.
R:  Mhm.  Exactly, so ...  [MN]
L:  So, is it going to help us to go to there countries?  I don't know.  [inaudible].
R:  [inaudible].   [NOISE] Yeah, [inaudible] I'm sorry.
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I don't know if going into another country is gonna do any good but [SIGH] we gotta stop it somehow.  [MN]  Is it gonna get worse?
R:  I hope not.
L:  I --
R:  But I think it will though.
L:  Oh, I think so.
R:  We don't have a better handle on the situation.
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- I don't -- I think the government knows what's going on at all times, I think they knew that the attacks was coming.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But they just blew 'em off.
R:  Mhm.  I think it the easy -- easiest way out.
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh no.
R:  [LAUGH] It's not a fun subject.
L:  No, it's not. [LAUGH]
R:  That's for sure.
L:  [LAUGH] Um, but the ...
R:  It's my first time doing something like this.  Is it yours?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They've called a couple of different times but I didn't know what they was doing.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I went back to the site that I signed up for, and, like, that's what's going on. [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  Well, yeah.  [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.  Well, we're gotta stay on this task.  We gotta talk about biochemics[?], [inaudible]. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Anyway, um, are you afraid to open your mail?
R:  No.  Not at all, are you?
L:  No.
R:  Yeah, I think, I -- I have confidence that, you know, that these thing now does make aware in [inaudible] and things like that, that they are better control better monitor.
L:  Mhm.  Are you afraid to go into, like, a mall or a --
R:  No.  You can't be afraid.  I mean, to me -- to me, I live a good life, I'm not afraid of dying [LAUGH] --
L:  No.
R:  -- although I'm not. So, no, I'm not afraid of anything.
L:  Yeah
R:  And I refuse to let somebody else control my life by putting fear in me.
L:  Right.
R:  So, no, not at all.
L:  Do you watch news regularly to --
R:  Mmm
L:  -- to see what's going on?
R:  Not really, on and off.  I usually listen in morning when I go to work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and to see what's going on in today's world and that's about it.
L:  That's what I used to do you know, when I was going to work.  I'm laid off right now, but --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- um, I refuse to watch the news.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because all the news is doing is trying to find the worst story and twist it to make it a little worse and --
R:  Right.  As a matter of fact if you -- after them what happen with nine eleven, I think the media could actually brainwash people to believe what they want you to believe.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like they were saying now oh Iraq does not have these -- kind of technology and, um, I don't believe it, I think they do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They have it twelve years ago.
L:  Right.
R:  Now, I think they even have more.
L:  Yeah 'cause they had uh chemicals back then.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'cause I know a couple of people.
R:  And then you're talking about that was twelve years ago.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, definitely going to have a lot more now.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I don't know who they're going to use them against.  There's a couple of theories I have, one is to use it in a neighboring country so that they could have control and have, uh, more, um, power to take on the US.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, how long are we supposed to talk?  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know, they're supposed to come on and end it.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [inaudible] it was thirty seconds.
R:  Oh, okay, and, um, so therefore as much as I hate war, I -- I think we have no choice to prevent ...
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  What's gonna happen?
L:  We need to protect our country.
R:  Yes, we do.
L:  And I did get an email you know, and it was an awesome email because it said [NOISE] something about one of the big wigs like Saddam like or something was gonna give a hundred thousand dollars to anybody that would kill an American.
R:  Mhm.  Oh yeah, I know that for a fact.  And I can't reveal the source.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I don't want to put myself in jeopardy but, yeah that is a fact.
L:  Right, but it -- in this newsletter it said, [NOISE] well this email; it said that um what is an American.  We all are Americans; there is not just one nationality here.
R:  Exactly.
L:  It's every nationality in this country.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And to be an American, you know it could be Saddam; he could be an American.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It -- it --
R:  Look at Bin Laden's own family that was living in US for how long.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, so -- but his idea is that -- the bad thing about it is that if his people were only know how we really are, compassionate caring and all that, they probably wouldn't have that kind of hatred against us.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, but in that they are brainwashed from the day they were born.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So they have no qualm about him using any kinda chemical thing against anybody.
L:  Uh, and like it said in this email, that it's sad because we've helped every country out in one way or another over the years.
R:  Mhm.  I know, it's amazing how it's -- [inaudible] as I mentioned to my husband say why can't we be selfish and just pret- -- take all the military out every country and just surround our border.  But, then he say, that with a chemical, uh, warfare and all that it wouldn't help because they could shoot in the air or whatever.  But then why can't we intercept it, you know?
L:  I don't know.
R:  I think it's about time we should protect us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We have enough force that could protect us, for sure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause, we have military all over the world.
L:  Yeah.  And it -- but my thing is -- if they're going, -- going to get to the military they need to protect us, they need to pay the military more.
R:  [MN] Oh, I totally agree.
L:  I mean, congress has no problem with giving themselves a raise but --
R:  Well how about giving to other country money --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for that?
L:  I mean, uh, military is -- a lot of military families are -- live on welfare because [NOISE] they can't make it on the pension or the money that military pays them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN]
R:  Exactly, and we know how hard it is for, um, military spouse to go to another country and try to get a job.
L:  Yep.
R:  You know, it's not easy.
L:  No it's not.
R:  So, and I know they don't get paid too much so I -- I agree totally.  Give them better housing too.  [LAUGH] So ...
L:  I don't know, it ma- -- the -- the warfare, it scares me because they could do so much effect just by one little bomb.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's got all these bad chemicals and stuff.  You know, that's the reason why we got cancer.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Is because of the radio- uh -- uh, the --
R:  Well, the chemical is even worse because [inaudible] you don't live [inaudible] do you suffer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And like you say I'm not afraid for myself 'cause I enjoy, live a real good life 'cause --
