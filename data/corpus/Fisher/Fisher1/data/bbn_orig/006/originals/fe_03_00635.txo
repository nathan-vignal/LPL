R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Yeah, hello.  This is Jom[?] King.  I'm a graduate student at University of Illinois.  I'm glad to talk with you.
L:  Cool.  I'm a, uh, physician from Florida.
R:  Yeha.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What do you think mo-- what is most important about life partner?
L:  What's important about a life partner?  Somebody who can deal with my schedule [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Somebody who -- who doesn't have a problem with it when I -- when I work a hundred hours a week.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  She doesn't -- she doesn't complain and go "You're not home when I need you to be home".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And someone -- someone who also doesn't want -- doesn't want a free ride.  Someone who wants to actively participate, you know.
R:  Yeha.
L:  Somebody who wants to pay the -- pay for some of their bills, you know, and not just sponge off ya [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I've met enough of those women [LAUGH].
R:  Uh, great.
L:  Yeah, it's always fun.
R:  Hm.  I think, uh, uh, it is important to have, um, similar [inaudible] and a similar attitude to life.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  Well --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- definitely, that's important.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You know --
R:  Secondly, I think, uh, uh, it is easy going on the -- on the opportune magic to the life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeha.  You -- you know, this and some common interests that is also -- also important.
L:  No, that's very important.  I mean, if you don't have a common interest with --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- someone why -- why-- why would you want to spend the rest of your life with them or -- or even -- even more than a couple of weeks with them [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  If you got bored with 'em real quick, I mean, that would -- that would be -- that would be it.
R:  Yeha.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, but, uh -- hm, where did I put that? [PAUSE]
R:  How you talk about with your partner about this?
L:  Uh-huh.  Let's see.  That's good.  Okay.  What was the question?  What did you say?
R:  Mhm.
L:  What did you say?
R:  Yeah.  How you talk about with your partner about your --
L:  How long are we supposed to talk about the --
R:  -- desire or your some requirements about this?
L:  How long are we supposed to talk about this for?
R:  Um, I would think we -- we must talk about ten minutes.
L:  They say ten minutes, huh?
R:  Yeha.
L:  [MN] 
R:  How long?
L:  I don't know.  That's a --
R:  That long?
L:  I don't know.  That's a long time sometimes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sometimes I can just talk about something in about two minutes and that's about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it doesn't need much more than that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Again, yeah, it's good to have common interests and feel comfortable with someone and, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- feel like you can share whatever with them.
R:  Yeha.
L:  But that doesn't always happen so ...
R:  Yeah.  But sometimes -- sometimes you just [inaudible] around with the common interests --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like you.
L:  No, some times you do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Now, what is leaking?
R:  Yeha.
L:  [NOISE] What is leaking?  Uh, fruit salad leaked.  Okay.
R:  I hear a lot of noise from your telephone.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I'm, uh, going in and out.  I was getting things all taken care of.  I just -- just got home from working.
R:  Uh-huh.  I see.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  So, what you're a grad student?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I did that -- did that way back when. [MN]
R:  Hm.  I'm very busy.  Um, um --
L:  Where -- where are you from originally?
R:  I come from China.
L:  From China?
R:  Yeah, I just -- about four months ago.
L:  Do you -- are you gonna be able to stay here or are you gonna have to -- have to go back?
R:  Hm.  I think -- I hope to stay here and got my [inaudible] for about four years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  Yeah.  At the begin -- at the beginning I like not to come here.  It's new for me.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it's a big -- it's a whole difference change probably compared to China.
R:  Yeah.  Do you often communicate with your partner?
L:  Uh-huh.  Always.  Have to. 
R:  Uh, yeah.
L:  If you don't communicate with 'em, then --
R:  Yeah, I think communication is very important to keep a good relationship between us.
L:  Definitely.  That's very important to keep a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to keep the interest level up and --
R:  Yeah, because the, um -- we're -- we're taught from the different people at the beginning, yeah --
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  -- we must have some difference -- we have different thoughts, different backgrounds, different education so we have to communicate with the partner under- understand what she thought about things -- about life.
L:  Definitely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.  When did you learn English?
R:  Hm.  I -- hm, I have done it  in my college year.
L:  That -- that --
R:  I think about, uh -- about, uh six years ago.
L:  Really.  You're pretty -- you're very, very fluent for someone who's only been speaking six -- six years.
R:  Thank you for your praise.  Yeah.  Um, I'm still improving, its -- yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Sometime I find it's hard to -- to -- for me to speak, yeah, and, uh, for -- for [several inaudible words] is, uh, much easier to learn.
L:  Really?
R:  Because, uh, before I come to United States I have no environment to talk with people and learn -- learn these things on the speaking.  I only learn from books.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah.  It is the real problem.  Yeah, after I come here, my spoken English has, um -- has, um, impro- improved --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a great deal.
L:  Yeah.  It sounds like it.  You're doing a good job.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Thank you.
L:  No, I mean, uh -- I mean, I've -- I've -- I used to teach and I still do teach --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I used to teach medical students and interns and residents --
R:  Yeha.
L:  -- and -- as such, and I -- you know, I used to have some of them who -- who were not, you know, not raised in America --
R:  Yeha.
L:  -- and they'd come from somewhere else and their English skills would not be anywhere near as -- as --
R:  Yeha.
L:  -- as well as yours are.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, that's definitely a compliment.  That's, uh, that's important to be able to communicate in the same language.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Have you ever done one of these things before?
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh, sorry?
L:  Have you ever done one of these little surveys before?
R:  No, I haven't.  Um, you see the -- uh, the spring semester just the beginning.  I'm very busy about the [several inaudible words].  I'm also graduate -- graduate assistant.
L:  Oh, you have to be.
R:  Yeah, so I have to do some work for my supervisor.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What are you, uh, studying?
R:  Uh, I -- I study in the department of electrical on the computer engineering.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you -- when you get done you'll be able to find a job anywhere.
R:  [MN] Yeah.  I -- yeah, I hope so, yeah.  But it's, uh, it's better for us, uh, to study in this major -- major.
L:  Mhm.
R:  There are many, uh -- many, many new things to learn, yeah.
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  How about your education?
L:  Uh, I don't know.  I have -- I have about five degrees.
R:  Uh-huh.  I see.
L:  I have, uh -- a degree in psychology, a degree in biology --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a masters in toxicology, my doctorate --
R:  Do you like that major?
L:  Yeah, well which one?
R:  Um, bio- biology.
L:  Biology was okay.
R:  Yeah, great.
L:  Yeah, it was a good thing.  Um, so that's --
R:  H- how about the weather, uh, in Florida?
L:  How are the weather in Florida?  The weather?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's cold a little bit here for here.  It's abnormal for here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Besides our -- our Tampa Bay Buccaneers just won the, uh, Superbowl a couple of minutes ago.  Everybody's going nuts here.
R:  Yeah, but I think it's much better than Illinois.  You would say there are --
L:  You must have snow on the ground.
R:  -- a lot of snow.  Lots.
L:  A lot of snow, huh? 
R:  Yeah, and they don't melt at all [LAUGH].
L:  No, it doesn't.  It doesn't get to disappear, no.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's always like that unfortunately.
R:  Have you gone abroad?
L:  Have I gone abroad?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've mainly gone to like -- like the -- not so much to Europe but to, uh, like the Caribbean and things like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  [MN] I -- besides the United States, I have gone to, uh, Japan.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, and [several inaudible words] uh, Tokyo.
L:  Tokyo.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'd -- I'd love to get down there some time.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I don't like that -- that city at all.  It's very crowds and busy.  A lot of people and a lot of [inaudible] everywhere.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  It's -- it's completely different probably than here.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Well --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I've gotta do some errands and I think we've been on for a good ten minutes.
