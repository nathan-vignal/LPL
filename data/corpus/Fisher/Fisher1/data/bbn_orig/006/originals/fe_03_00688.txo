L:  Hi.
R:  Hey, how's it going?
L:  Oh pretty good.
R:  My name's Fred, what's yours?
L:  Donna.
R:  How's it going?
L:  Pretty good. [MN]
R:  So, what do you think?
L:  Oh yeah, I think it will.
R:  I think it will, also.  I think that the precedent itself of security will make somebody think twice about doing something, yeah?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I suppose so, with today's news and everything that's going on, [LIPSMACK] so ...
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Have you been to the airport since, uh, nine eleven?
L:  No, I haven't.  No, I have never been a flier, so ...
R:  Oh really?
L:  No.
R:  I have, it's really not that bad.  I've heard horror stories about people getting checked like five times before they get on a flight but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I got checked once and that's it.
L:  Mm.  No, I've only flown on, uh, small planes so --
R:  Right on.
L:  Uh.  [SIGH]
R:  Well, I flew internationally so I had to be there like an hour or more --
L:  Mhm
R:  -- earlier, so I had to be there three hours earlier instead of two.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which is what it was before.  So, how long do we have to talk for?
L:  I don't know.  I don't know.  Uh, lets see, airport security, oh what do you think about them hiring, you know, after the um [LIPSMACK] the nine eleven?
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Uh, and they hired all those new employees?
R:  I think it's good for the economy.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh well, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  People get more jobs.  [LAUGH]
L:  I think they're doing a better job.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, more or less, but I think you know it was too lax before all this took place so ...
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK]  Um.
R:  I think it gives more people jobs, too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which is nice.
L:  Mhm.  Now, what is it you can only take on a carry on bag?  With today's ...?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, you're limited to one and it has to sit, like, a space provided.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, at the check out -- check in counter [NOISE] they, they, like, they have this box and if your carry on doesn't fit that thing, you have to check it.
L:  [MN]
R:  But it's good, I mean I didn't take a -- a carry on.  I've flown, like, I don't know, three or four times.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's not that bad.
L:  No.  Was that within country?
R:  Um, three times within the country, and once outside.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, where abouts in the United States are you?
L:  Uh, up in Maine.
R:  Uh, I'm completely south of you, Miami.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  Oh, my husband's flown there.  He flies.
R:  Oh, there you go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Has he complained a lot about the extra security?
L:  No, he hasn't had to since then.  Um ... with his job and all but, um, no ... no actually, um, I believe this is where one, ah, no -- did all three of them board here in Maine?  No.
R:  The terrorists?
L:  Yes, because they came in from Canada, [LIPSMACK] and I know they boarded down here in Portland.  I don't know if it was --
R:  No, I'm not sure.
L:  Yeah.  I remember -- [LAUGH] I remember that because they were worried about [LIPSMACK] the coastline and everything, 'cause it's so vast, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I know most of them trained in Florida.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like, their flight school or whatever.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  A good friend of mine actually, um, he came down here to visit me from Orlando, Florida.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he got red tagged at the checking counter and he got stopped, like, five times.
L:  Really.
R:  Yeah, they searched him, like, five times.  They made him take off his shoes and everything.
L:  Hm.
R:  But he doesn't look like your normal everyday law abiding citizen, so ...
L:  Wow. 
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what happens when you have tattoos on your head.
L:  [LAUGH] I suppose.  I'm not into, uh, um ... do you know if there's a time or some limit or something?  [LAUGH]
R:  I have no idea.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  I signed up for this, like, two nights ago.
L:  Yeah, me too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I saw it on a form.
L:  Mm.  [LIPSMACK] Ah, let's see, airport security.  Hm, no they -- do they still have as many flights that they had prior to this?
R:  Uh, no, I know a lot of companies are losing a lot of money because of it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, United has gone bankrupt.
L:  Has it?
R:  Or went bankrupt or something. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, my girlfriend worked at this building where they had their offices and they closed it.  So, I don't know.
L:  [MN] Oh.
R:  You know what this study's for?
L:  [LAUGH] Right now, airport security.
R:  [LAUGH] I think it's about conversation tones and everything.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I signed up for it online.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  Um, and, uh, we're supposed to talk about the topics that we're ch- you know were given.  [LIPSMACK]  Uh ...
R:  Airport security.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know, it's a lot more nerve wracking going on flights now though.  I tell you that much.
L:  Is it?  Is it?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah you can feel the nervousness of people on flights.
L:  Mm.  [LIPSMACK].  Well, yeah, yeah I can understand that, I think I probably would too if I was a flier.
R:  I personally don't think that the terrorists are going to try another airplane hijacking just because of -- they know what happened and after that, um, the story came out of that plane that went down in the field in -- I think it was Pennsylvania --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that people aren't going to stand there and just take it, you know.
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] Actually I think there was another, um, incident that happened, not too long after that, but, ah, somebody got a little carried away on the plane and the passengers went right after him.
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, the shoe bomber too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Stewardess just jumped on him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I would.
L:  Oh, definitely.  If you know, you know, you are gonna go down anyway.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.
L:  At least you are having a chance.
R:  Yeah.  Don't let 'em take out innocent people.
L:  I know.  I know.  Uh, what do you think about the pilots?  Now, I don't know if they passed that law or not, about the gun?  If they should be entitled to carry a gun in the cockpit?
R:  Uh, I'm not sure.  I don't think it's a good idea.  .
L:  No, especially after those pilots got picked up for being intoxicated.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.
L:  You get a little bold sometimes when you have a few, but ...  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know the one that did pass was, uh, bulletproof doors ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- between the cockpit and the rest of the plane.
L:  Well, that's a good idea.
R:  Yeah, it's a great idea.
L:  They probably --
R:  But then again the terrorist might just sit back there and say okay open the door or we're gonna kill the passengers.
L:  Well ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, but you know you also have the option of, if you did open the doors and could they do it again, nine eleven?
R:  Well, yeah, I mean, if they open the doors they should, you know, be as smart as to think that if they do open the doors then everybody's dead.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I don't know, it's a touchy subject.
L:  Yes, it is.  I think everything's really touchy right now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Best not ...  [MN]
L:  Mhm.  Oh ...
R:  Well personally I don't mind waiting an extra hour if it means being safe.
L:  Oh, sure, sure.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah, my mother's flying out to Florida next month.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh yeah?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Is she nervous?
L:  Oh, I'm sure she is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  She's a nervous person anyway, so ...[LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Take a Valium.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, yeah, that's fine, unless the plane gets shot down.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] I don't think it's gonna get shot down.
L:  No.  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  It's the way everything's going in this country.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, oh, mm.
R:  I'm trying to see in the email that I got today, how long --
L:  I know.
R:  -- it was going to be for.  So, where did you see it online?
L:  Uh, I really can't remember.  I think a friend sent me an email.  I'm not sure. Um, [LIPSMACK], um ...
R:  No, there's nothing in this email that says how long we have to talk for.
L:  No.  All I know it's recorded, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  Well, I hope we've been some use to them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I just, I don't know how much more you could say about it really.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  I think they're doing just about everything they can.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  I'm actually gonna apply for a job --
