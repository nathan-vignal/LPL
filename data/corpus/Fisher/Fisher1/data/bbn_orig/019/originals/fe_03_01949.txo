L:  Hi, my name's Erin, from Texas. 
R:  Hi, my name is, ah, Denise from Philadelphia.
L:  Are we supposed to talk now?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think so.
L:  Have you done this before?
R:  Ah, no, I haven't --
L:  Me either.
R:  -- I got a couple of calls and I was either asleep or just missed the call, so this is really my first call.
L:  That's weird.
R:  And it -- yeah.  And it actually seemed like a very interesting project, and I wonder what, ah, they intend to do with the information.
L:  I have this idea that it's not really about speech, I think it's really about something else. [LAUGH]
R:  It's not about speech?
L:  Well, they say it's, it's about language and speech and stuff --
R:  Right, right.  But if you look at the topics, did you look at the discussion topics?
L:  Yeah, mhm.
R:  It doesn't seem like it's about speech, does it --
L:  No.
R:  -- it seems more like an opinion survey.
L:  I think it's education too.  I think they're trying to see, you know, people -- are people in the South dumber than people in the North, or --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, like stuff like that. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, it's really cool to get to talk to, um, people that you don't know from all over --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the country.  I mean, I probably would not have had an opportunity to talk to somebody from Texas.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But we're supposed to be talking about family, aren't we.
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  So let's see.
L:  Okay, family.
R:  Do you have any family in Philadelphia?
L:  No, I don't.
R:  Or anywhere on the East Coast?
L:  No, everybody that I, um, am related to lives in the South.  Um, I have one brother in Romania --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and he, ah, he just had a baby and -- so that's probably --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- person that's fartherest away.
R:  Where in the South?
L:  Dallas.  Well actually, I live in Dallas but my parents --
R:  Oh, you mean South Texas? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, Texas, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  I should say Texas, but.
R:  Okay.
L:  Anyway.
R:  My family, or at least my paternal family is from the South, but ah, by that I mean, ah, South Carolina.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I just came from visiting, ah, South Carolina after having not having been able to go for about seven years.
L:  Oh.
R:  The last time I went was for my grandmother's funeral, she died when she was ninety nine years old.
L:  Wow.
R:  And I went there two years before that for my father's funeral.
L:  Oh.
R:  He was the youngest of fourteen children.
L:  Wow.
R:  But he died, ah, before she did.
L:  Oh.
R:  So it was really kind of a home going, I guess --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for me.  It was a wonderful experience, being able to visit my aunts and uncles, even though there are only four left out of the fourteen.
L:  Wow.
R:  One aunt and three uncles.  But now they all have children and grandchildren.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So that was really neat.
L:  Well, can I ask you how old you are?
R:  Forty three.
L:  And I'm twenty four, by the way. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] Okay.  Um, I have --
L:  It's just funny --
R:  -- a daughter who is twenty seven.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I have a daughter who's twenty seven, she lives in Atlanta, and she's an RN.
L:  Oh, neat.
R:  Yeah, so.
L:  Well that's good.
R:  I kinda have family spread out across the country.  Across the globe, really.
L:  Mhm.
R:  My mother's family is originally from Jamaica.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Part of them stayed there, and the other part came here to, um, the mainland and, and, ah, settled in Baltimore, of all places.  And I say that 'cause I don't like Baltimore too much. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But um, so --
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  -- that's where my mother's grandmother lives.
L:  Oh.  Well, pretty much all my family is Texas or Louisiana.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I don't know -- I don't know, it's so weird, you know, I get so jealous of, ah, people who know their heritage, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like I don't really know, I'm -- I'm just white, I don't know [LAUGH] like where my family came from --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- or you know, so it's real, you know, weird to -- you know, I get jealous of like, you know, Saint Patrick's Day and other ethnic type holidays --
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  -- you know, 'cause I don't know how to celebrate.
R:  Do you have any idea why that is?  Why your family heritage wasn't, like, passed down to you?
L:  Well, I -- maybe 'cause it's mixed, or maybe -- I know that we're -- I think that we're just, you know, German.  
R:  Okay.
L:  You know, plain Jane German, you know.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  Like we don't have any kind of, you know, interesting mix in there, you know.  
R:  Okay.
L:  So.
R:  Well, do you know who your grandparents were?
L:  Oh yeah, yeah.  My grand-
R:  And were they-- they were born in the States?
L:  Well, um, yeah.  My grandmother's still alive, and she -- um, she --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I don't know where she was born, but she lives in, ah, North Texas, and ah, my grandparents on the other side were born in Louisiana.
R:  Okay.  And how about your great grandparents?  Do you know anything about them?
L:  Um, I know a little bit about them.  My great grandparents on my mom's side, um, Louisiana area, and ah, my -- I'm not really sure about my dad's side.
R:  Okay.  
L:  Probably Texas.
R:  That's probably a good place to start, ah, with your great grandparents.  If you can find out where they were born.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Even if they were born here in the United States, sometimes, ah, where they live or where their parents settled will give you an indication of where you came from.  You know, I'm, I'm pretty much in the same boat.  I mean, even though I'm African American, I cannot trace my heritage back past my great grandparents, for obvious reasons --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because our families were broken up and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, sold.  So I, I really don't know either.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it took, it took, ah, you know, I went through great pains to even go back that far. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  So.
L:  Wow.
R:  Oh, but I don't think I ever really considered it from that -- that angle.  I know when I have -- I've had discussions in the past with Caucasians, and I ask them, well, you know, about their ethnicity, because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there is only once race, and that's the human race --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but I've asked them about their ethnicity, and they just -- they draw, like, this blank.  Oh, I'm just American.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You know, I'm just white.  I'm just American.  And maybe for a while it was so that, you know, you could just assimilate into whatever the American culture was.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was probably important at the time many families immigrated to --
L:  Well yeah, America is a melting pot, and, you know, if you -- you know if you don't pay -- you know, if you -- if your heritage wasn't passed down when your family came over to America, then you probably don't know it, you know.
R:  Right.  It just melted.  That, that's right.  That's just -- it just melted.  And um, you know, I don't think that that should be.  I think it should be like a soup pot, or a big salad, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- where you can keep your individual heritage--
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and identity and still be an American.
L:  Yeah, mhm.
R:  Do you have any children?
L:  No, I'm not married --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- um, don't have children, uh-uh.  I'm too young. [LAUGH]
R:  Well that --
L:  I'm just kidding.
R:  -- I'm glad you feel that way. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I actually had my first child when I was sixteen.
L:  Wow.  How many children do you have?
R:  That's why I have -- ah, I have three now.  Um --
L:  Wow.  What was that like?
R:  What was it like?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Very interesting.  Very difficult.  But very rewarding too --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because my daughter now is twenty seven, and she's an RN, she lives in Atlanta on her own, she supports herself, she makes more money than I do. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So you know, I guess it turned out pretty good for me.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And then I have a thirteen year old son, and a fifteen -- sorry, sixteen year old daughter.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Who are still at home with me.
L:  Oh.  What do they want to be when they grow up?
R:  Ah, my son says he wants to design cars.  And, um, my daughter, she's kind of wavering between -- at first she was on this singer actress --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- kind of vibe, and then now she's starting to move towards something like, well now I think I should be a lawyer or -- so, but she's kind of at the age where she wants to be everything, and --
L:  Yeah.  I'm at that age. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know what I want to be.
R:  Okay.  Are you a student?
L:  No, I've graduated already, but um, I'm in -- I'm in post production for, ah, TV and movies and film -- I mean, films and TV and video.  So, post production is like special effects and, um, animation and design --
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  -- and it's fun, but you know, it's not as fun as I thought it would be.
R:  Oh, that sounds so cool though.
L:  It sounds cool on paper, but when you have to work --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- ten hour days every day, it's not fun.
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So you work for a television studio?
L:  Well, it's a -- it's an animation studio.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, it's not really -- you know, we don't go directly to TV, we just -- the people hire us to add things to their stuff.  Like
