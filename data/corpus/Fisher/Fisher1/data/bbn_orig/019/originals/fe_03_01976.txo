L:  Hi, my name is Ed. 
R:  Ed, ah, good afternoon, my name is Wayne.
L:  Hello, Wayne.
R:  Hi.  I'm in Nashville Tennessee.
L:  Well, we're in Dallas, Texas. [LAUGH]
R:  Not too terribly far.  Ah, but, ah, --
L:  Is this your --
R:  -- I understand that, ah, that the topic is, ah, is if, or what if anything the government can do to, um, --
L:  And how -- right, and how has it affect -- the corporate greed, has it affect you and, you know, what has -- how has it affected you.
R:  Right, right.  I well understand, and, and, ah, --
L:  Actually, ah, to give you an example, we were in the stock market -- we're retired, and we were in the stock market, and as the stock continually kept down -- going down, and then we heard about Enron and different other companies and how they're affecting the market, we decided to go with an annuity --
R:  Mhm, yes.
L:  -- which gives us a little more security.  Now, when we were discussing annuity we went to, ah, one that was based on the -- which is variable, which is still based on the market, so as the market fluctuates, we do have fluctuation on this annuity, but it is guaranteed to the base amount that we have.
R:  Yeah, there is a base, ah, ah, for it, as opposed to it bottoming out on you.
L:  That is correct.
R:  Yeah, I'm, I'm just very slightly, slightly aware of the variable annuity option.
L:  Well, with the variable annuity that we have, which gives us protection against economic ups and downs, um, we are committed for a seven year period --
R:  Right, that is the -- okay, that is the stipulation because --
L:  That is a stipulation, so if you decide to leave early, you're looking at, like, um, fifteen, twenty per cent -- I think ours is, like, twenty per cent.  So what we would normally do is -- yeah, we've got some chances that, you know, if the market turns around, which hopefully it would, ah, now that we're getting more government intervention, they're looking at accounting practices more, we're gonna -- we're not gonna be hurt as much.  But yeah, we were a little bit concerned.  Now, my wife, ah, retired from a firm, got her retirement package, has had not problems, because it wasn't based just generally on the stock of the company. 
R:  Well, yeah.  For which I'm sure she is, ah, very grateful, having --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- watched, ah, very carefully, even though I've never been involved in corporate life, like, like you, I am retired, I'm sixty --
L:  Oh, you're a youngster.  I'm sixty five. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I retired a couple of years ago --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I was on the Fire Department, they permit you to go when you're fifty five.
L:  Oh, well good for you.
R:  If you have enough time in.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, but watched all of it very carefully myself, and the -- you know, the question too, I wonder how you feel, ah, whether congress itself, or any legislative body for that matter, can -- 
L:  Well, I feel that congress is getting involved.  Ah, --
R:  Probably due to great protest from the American public --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- most of whom lost money.
L:  Well yeah, that's true, and then, you know, to -- ah, if they want to stay in congress they've got to listen to their constituents, and basically, um, the I -- I'm almost sure your finance and security committee is, ah, looking into this and looking at, ah, well, example, ah, more stricter, ah, you know, looking at stricter guidelines, they're also looking at, ah, more, um, open accounting practices, and, ah, I think what they did recently with the, um, executives having to sign, um, sort of a loyalty oath to suggest that they are going to, ah, govern themselves accordingly, ethically, et cetera, it's important.  But you're still gonna get somebody that basically, ah, sees the market as a personal gain, and ah, wants to, ah, see what he can get away with.  And I think it's gonna be a little more difficult now because congress is aware of it, these executives when they're reporting their, um, profit and loss statements are really signing off --
R:  Are signing off on --
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  -- what, what is supposed to be the truth, but it's turned out to be a colossal pack of lies. 
L:  Well --
R:  Everybody from Worldcom, to really --
L:  Well, I'll give you an example.  This is what, this is what's happening, especially in Dallas with American Airlines with Cottie[?], the CEO, I mean he --
R:  Right.  All of us have seen that.
L:  Yeah.  He had to --
R:  Resign.
L:  -- resign.  There was nothing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- he could do.  I mean --
R:  Well, ah, it's that humiliation, it, ah, -- if a gentleman was willing to stand up and meet after workers make incredible concessions, and they pad their pockets with colossal bonuses, to stand and look at these men and women, then he's got more cahonies than many Texans I've met, and Texans have big ones. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, thank you very much.  Ah, I --
R:  I was stationed in Texas.  I don't know, they treated me pretty good.
L:  Well, and I'm passing through Tennessee to, ah, go up to Kentucky, we're gonna do some -- we've got a national camping organization, they're gonna do the Midwest.  But basically it's true that, um, a lot of corporations are looking for one, the profit and loss statement, that's how the guarantee their, um, shall we say, their existence, ah, in their positions, and their salaries.  But still I'm amazed at how these executives, and I know they have a large responsibility, but just how they seem to get their bonuses, their salaries, their stock options, and the middle class working person still has to struggle.  So I think with congress having them, ah, signing off, scrutinizing them now, I think, ah, the accounting organizations are going to have to police themselves more.  And, ah, yeah, it's, ah, it's a big hit and a big concern, but I think it's turning out to be better now.  Not the best, not cured, but better now that it was before.
R:  What you have, ah, you have a great deal of, ah, of faith, Ed, in, um, --
L:  Well, let me say this. I'm a laborer --
R:  -- in, in our congress that, that, I'm sorry, I don't have that.  I'd like to have faith.  But I --
L:  Well, I understand.
R:  -- I'm a tad sceptical, having observed politics [LAUGH] for many years.
L:  I -- well, as a matter of fact --
R:  Lack of courage.
L:  -- yeah, no I agree with you, and especially --
R:  To buck the corporations that are in fact feeding --
L:  Well, not only the corporations --
R:  -- feeding the trough, as they say.
L:  No, but I think you make a good point, because you being a fireman, and being a civil servant, or having been a civil servant, and I'm, I'm sure city government has put you, you know, to the -- against the wall as they're doing right now in Dallas with the police and the fire department.  They're giving them increases, not as much as they want --
R:  Yes, but that has very little to do with corporate life itself.
L:  Yeah, well that's true.
R:  And, and how congress -- ah, I, I understand all of the things that you said, and yes, ah, but fundamentally, ah, they also, I think, would have to use in addition to it a bit of a carrot.  I mean, ethics are very difficult to teach -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'm not too sure graduate schools, ah, such as, ah the one we have here in town at OGSM at Vanderville, for example.
L:  Oh, it's an excellent school.
R:  It is.  They have recently started teaching ethics, but I'm not too sure that you can legislate, um, bad behavior, but you can apply instead of the carrot the stick, in the sense that if enough people were locked up in prisons, rather than the treatment that is normally handed out to people from a certain economic group --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- dare I say class, because someone might suggest that I was talking about class warfare.  Um, --
L:  No, I hear you.
R:  But, but I have seen this, I saw it at Eglin Air Force Base when I was stationed there.  There was a federal prison on Eglin Air Force Base and you wouldn't know it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I've also been at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama --
L:  Come on.
R:  -- and you wouldn't know that place was a prison because these guys are walking
