L:  Hi, I'm Angela.
R:  Hi, I'm Michelle. 
L:  Hi Michelle. 
R:  Hi, how are you? 
L:  Good. 
R:  Um, I guess we're supposed to be talking about 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- family. 
L:  Yeah. [SIGH]  I have a -- let me see, we have an eleven month old right now with a double ear infection --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and the flu. 
R:  Oh, no. 
L:  The families wonderful, along with five other children. 
R:  Oh, my goodness. 
L:  Yep, so I'm a mum, of six.  
R:  Wow.
L:  One of who is currently sick.  And my husband is changing her diaper right now
R:  Oh, my goodness. 
L:  So, if all of a sudden you hear this scream, you know she's having one of those days. 
R:  Oh, I can understand. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's my family. 
R:  Well, I only -- I have half of what you have.  We have three children, um, and our youngest is four months old.  And then the oldest is five. 
L:  [MN]
R:  The girl's sandwiched in between that's two and a half. 
L:  Oh. 
R:  Umm
L:  Well that's good.  Our two youngest are girls.  We have a one -- Barbara's almost one. Kendra just turned two.
R:  My goodness. [LAUGH]
L:  And four boys, and, um, -- Stevens seven, and we have twin nine year old boys Chris and Justin, and Alexander's ten. 
R:  Wow. 
L:  But some day I have to figure out how this keeps happening. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My [inaudible] said that, um, I'm pay -- I paid off her medical bills --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- now.  I'm starting on her kids. 
R:  You have your own suite at the hospital [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they've named it after us.
R:  Oh, sure. 
L:  So, but yeah it's -- great though, I love having a big family.
R:  Right.
L:  -- Um, you know basically most of the time the kids get along great.  Um, there's always somebody to play with. 
R:  Right that's true. 
L:  And so that's -- I think that's the neatest thing about [NOISE] the family 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- And how just having -- having that many kids, of course Barbara looks like she's vampire [NOISE] baby these days. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Cause she's just got two --
R:  Oh, she's --
L:  -- finally got two teeth
R:  Oh. How cute.
L:  And they're little -- they look like little -- they're not in the front, their on the side, one on top one on bottom. 
R:  [MN] Well that's different. 
L:  So we just call her the vampire baby these days. 
R:  Oh, that's so cute. 
L:  So, yeah, she's standing and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, she's right at that fun age. 
R:  Right, [MN] now I can't wait.  I mean, you know with the first one, I guess I was just so much more tense, you know every little cry, or --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- sound I was running there.  But now you know with the third, it was just so much more relaxed.  And it was just so -- so much fun.  You know. 
L:  Well that's what we say, you know the first one when the pacifier hit the ground, you know you were in. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Cleaning it sterilizing it. 
R:  Right.
L:  By the sixth one you look at it, you blow it, you --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- hand it back to them. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know --
R:  That's true though.
L:  -- I don't really care if the -- you know if the out fit -- like today Barbara's been through eight or nine outfits throwing up.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, until the sun went down I finally just took off every thing it was easier. 
R:  Exactly. 
L:  She's throwing up like crazy today. 
R:  Oh.
L:  So, you know you just kind of -- what pants have been the item of the day today. 
R:  Right.  I understand.  It is fun, but I do -- I mean yeah my daughters just -- she's at the stage where she -- she's very opinionated, and she has to pick out her own clothes. 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, you know with -- with my oldest was [inaudible] a probably -- given him a choice of two out fits that I preselected.  With Lauren, it's like okay well if you want to wear the pink and white poker dotted pants, with the pink and white striped shirt I just don't care just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] -- and hygiene [inaudible] of course are.
L:  With her -- with her hair in three ponytails
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  Exactly. 
L:  I think the girls are much more opinionated -- the boy will just  "Okay that's fine mum". 
R:  Right. 
L:  The girls, even our eleven month old bug right now Barbara's -- you know she wants this magazine.  It doesn't matter how many other books she has. 
R:  Right
L:  She's going to have this magazine --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or you're going to hear about it. 
R:  Exac- Exactly.  Maybe it is girls. 
L:  I think it's 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- A girl thing. 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  But I'll tell you what.  Even at eleven months she was already -- when she wants it, she wants it now, and if she doesn't get it.  So she is just -- gosh, she's so much fun. 
R:  Oh.
L:  I forget how much fun they are at this age, and everything's so new.
R:  Right.
L:  I think that's what's so wonderful is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- You know she'll sit there and just concentrate, and concentrate -- wish my boys would do the same things with school. 
R:  [LAUGH] Concentrate, right.
L:  You know, concentrate that hard --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to get it accomplished until she does it, and she'll just keep working on it -- it's like standing up. 
R:  Wow. 
L:  And, so I mean that's what -- I think the big thing though that we do as -- as a family is make sure that we eat together. 
R:  Right.  Yes. 
L:  It's like there's no options -- and that's the thing I remember growing up as we get older, Sunday nights you ate with the family.  You had to be dead at the morgue 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to not be at the dinner table on Sunday nights.  That was just -- that was all there was to it. 
R:  Right. 
L:  So, and I think that's a really neat thing to have with the family.  To be able to sit down, and say you know I ate -- cause you can find out so much with that. 
R:  That's true.  An- and that's how we are  [inaudible] as you say growing up. Sunday dinner was always the big dinner, you know, it was always this -- the biggest meal of the week was always Sunday 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- dinner and all you always had desert and every thing else, and, um, an- and so yeah we still -- and there -- even today there are certain things -- you just don't be late with the Sunday dinner.  You know it's like. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  I remember one night it was one Sunday we were really busy, and I made spaghetti for dinner.  My mother happened to call, and I said, "Oh, we're in the middle of dinner".  "Wh- what are you having?"  "Oh, spaghetti -- on Sunday".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yep. 
R:  It was like, "How dare you have spaghetti on a Sunday". 
L:  Oh, yeah, you have to have meat, potatoes --
R:  Exactly. 
L:  -- vegetables, and fruit. 
R:  Exactly. 
L:  Chocolate milk 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- And you know home made apple pie.  
R:  Yeah, oh, of course. 
L:  Oh, yeah, well and that's what I mean  that's just how it was growing up. 
R:  Right. 
L:  And I --this is some of the neatest times that I remember, that you know mum, and dad always made sure they were home. 
R:  Right. 
L:  You know, my brother and I could bring home friends, or  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whatever on Sunday night, but our buts were sitting on that table --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- on Sunday night. 
R:  Exactly. 
L:  And that's pretty much the kids -- the only thing I just -- that kind of bothers me now, is that our church for our youth group do a Sunday night dinner. 
R:  Oh.
L:  And so that kind of gets difficult sometimes, because --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- but, you know I'm like that's fine if you guys want to go, but you can't -- you still have to come and sit at the [NOISE] dinner table [NOISE] with us. [NOISE]
R:  Right. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's true. 
L:  And the kids don't always [NOISE] I mean they're kind of [NOISE] like, I want to go play game boy.  I wanna [NOISE] go do this -- it's like, no, you know.  You will sit down here --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and you will enjoy this.
R:  [COUGH] Exactly.  Cause I mean I remember y- [inaudible] -- I remember my mother getting up on Sunday morning, and putting the roast in the oven before we went to church, and setting the oven, and you know the whole, the whole thing.  So it is -- I think that it is really important. 
L:  [NOISE] And so I mean if there's -- I -- to me if there [NOISE] is nothing else that I can give to my kids to go on [NOISE] it's t- to you know remember that, you know is family is the core. 
R:  Right. 
L:  And you know no matter what else happens.
R:  That's --
L:  I could be furious with my mother, but you know what I still know mums going to be there. 
R:  Right. 
L:  I want my kids to do the same thing.  I want --
R:  Right.
L:  -- them to know -- you know the families the core. 
R:  Right. 
L:  No matter [NOISE] what else is going on, you can always count on the family to be there. 
R:  Exactly.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Exactly.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And always come back home, you know and, [SIGH] an- and I think that's what we try to instill that, you know.  It's great to have friends, and it's, you know  um, work -- we're happy that you make these, these wonderful friends, but as you said the family is  is the core, and, you know Lauren is always going to be Ajay's sister no matter what happens, you know and, um.  And I think right now of course, they're very young, so they get along pretty well for siblings of this age.  [COUGH] And I just hope that it continues -- 
L:  But see --
R:  -- as they get older.
L:  -- that's what my brother and I even now -- I'm, you know -- I'm thirty four, he's thirty two. We don't really have any thing to do with each other, and we never did.  I mean, we each did our own things growing up --
R:  Right. 
L:  We, you know.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  My parents -- my parents used to always joke -- said, you know no one ever better come in between us. 
R:  Right. 
L:  But they never knew if they were ever going to come home, and find one of us had killed the other one. 
R:  Exactly
L:  And it -- but it's even -- I mean even now to this day I mean, I was home -- my parents house at Christmas, and I mean my brother and I were going at it like we were in junior high. [MN]
R:  Right. [LAUGH] Right.
L:  Yeah, you go by, and y- you know punch the other one.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He touched me first he's looking --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- I'm like thirty something years old.  But you know, no one could come between us 
R:  Right. 
L:  -- that was just 
R:  Exactly. 
L:  Screw -- you know I'm sorry but if any ones going to kill my brother, it's going to be me.
R:  Right. 
L:  [inaudible] And now like my brother's a cop.  I mean --
R:  Oh.
L:  We really joke about it that -- that you know -- the criminals better be smart enough not to go after my brother and shoot him, because there will --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- be hell to pay, because --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They don't need to worry about the other cops finding them, which is going to be pretty bad. 
R:  Right. 
L:  Worry about sis finding them. 
R:  Right.  Right. 
L:  You know if any bodies going to kill him, I'm gonna get the pleasure of doing it. 
R:  [COUGH] [LAUGH]
L:  And that's what, you know -- but we really, you know -- my brother, you know -- if something should happen to my husband and I, [LAUGH] my brother would kill me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But he gets all the kids.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know. 
R:  I know my sister -- my sister right now she has one and then one on the way -- any minute, any day. 
L:  Oh, gees.
R:  And um, and yes, an- an- and we always joke that, you know, if any thing happens to us well she'll have five children, [LAUGH] and you know. 
L:  Well my brother has --
R:  And vice versa. 
L:  -- none.
R:  Oh, really. 
L:  He's not married. 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  My brother has toys -- you know my brother has in the middle of --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Dallas [inaudible] Horses, and a TV -- mean my brother had fun -- you know bachelor boy toys. 
R:  Oh, wow.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I mean my brother would end up with
