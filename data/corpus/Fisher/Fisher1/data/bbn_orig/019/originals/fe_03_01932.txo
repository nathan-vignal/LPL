R:  Hello? 
L:  Hello, how are you? 
R:  Good, how are you? 
L:  Doing pretty good. 
R:  Good, so, um, I'm Tia.  And, um, what does family mean to you? 
L:  Well family means my husband and kids.  [LAUGH]  Extended family. 
R:  No I -- I mean I don't have, um, children of my own and I don't have a husband.  My boyfriend and I have been together a long time and we live together, but I don't --but I have some clue -- because I want that -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm gonna be thirty next year.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'm thirty five and got two kids. 
R:  Oh, okay
L:  Been married for thirteen years.
R:  Okay -- okay so you know what family is about? 
L:  Yes.  
R:  I mean I have my parents, and I have a brother and a sister, so I'm close to them and actually my mum is very s- -- well, she was diagnosed with cancer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So like I -- we've been doing family stuff -- we did is before but, like, you know, now I'm getting into the  okay, Sundays I go over to their house in [inaudible] and, you know, all of us will come over and eat, you know, it's just -- again those family moments -- just 'cause I'm getting older doesn't mean I can't -- you know, we can't do stuff together. 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah I know what you mean.  My dad's birthday is next week and we're having a family get together. 
R:  Yeah I --
L:  My great grandpa is coming down. 
R:  That's like -- you know, that's one of the best parts in this with -- well I want to be is mother because I love -- I mean besides me being a teacher I look forward to being able to it that like -- you know, have -- you know, have kids and to have some good memories at least of child hood.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Nobody's perfect but, you know, they have -- I get --
L:  It's harder --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- if you really think -- they start teaching the kids very young in school that your parents aren't allowed to yell at you, or anything so --
R:  Actually we don't teach that -- I teach kindergartens and, like, --
L:  Well they taught her in that kindergarten. 
R:  Really? 
L:  Yes in North Carolina they do. 
R:  Well this is Philadelphia, and, you know, what --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't tell them that because if some -- a child acts up and the parents wants to take them outside and yell at them whatever -- some parents like to beat them, but I can't let them do that in front of me.  They have to go like to a bathroom or something [LAUGH] like -- you know, I don't tell parents, "Oh, you can't do that".  I don't tell the kids, "Oh, your parents can't do that". 
L:  Well they started teaching them -- they have a class, every year they are taught a little bit more.  Um, they take them through child prevention week. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  They have a whole week that they show them all of these ugly movies and tell them all of these horror stories. 
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  But, uh, if my child needs the spanking --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- she is gonna get it.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, that's how I feel.  That's a family decision  like, you know, like parents side and I don't think there is anything wrong with my parents spanking their children. 
L:  No I don't -- I don't be- -- I believe that, uh spanking and beating are two different things. 
R:  Yeah it's not like, "Okay I have the extension cord and I'm, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, beating the kids" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know thanks not the spanking.  You know I -- I -- you're right there is a difference, but especially up here, like, family has replaced -- in a way they want it -- it seems up here that they want us to do more and of the family role for it kids  like, you know, now they get breakfast in the school, which is good but now we have certain [inaudible] and, like, "Hey what about the" [LAUGH] -- what I- -- what about, like, uh, partnership but from home and we don't really have that and it sometimes feels to us like they want us to take that role. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's like well, you know, if you have the kids -- okay even if they're unintentional kids let's try to -- not that we're not willing to work with them, but if a child does -- you know, I have kindergarteners who don't do their home work all of the time.  That's a par- parental issue. 
L:  Yes it is. 
R:  It's like, you know, the parent should be sitting down and I'm not giving them, like, hours of homework. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's, like, fifteen minutes -- it's, like, sit down and, um, do it -- so what is some of the things you like to do with your children? 
L:  With my children? 
R:  Yes. 
L:  I'm very involved -- up until about eighteen months ago --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I broke my hip.  I was a school bus driver and Girl Scout leader.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I'm a Girl Scout leader. 
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, d- -- you know, they did anything I was involved. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You were there. 
L:  Yep, um, she had baseball, softball, cheerleading -- they have done that. 
R:  So you have them involved and you go with them? 
L:  Yes. 
R:  That's good -- that's good. 
L:  Up until about eighteen months ago when I broke my hip. 
R:  And then you couldn't but --
L:  I'm kind of can't sit on a hard bench for very long.  I still go in my car --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if I'm having a good day, and sit in my car. 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You just sounded different, you know, is -- showing your daughter is important and to find a different way of participating in it. 
L:  Well I told them I used to go to the volunteer at the school all the time and I'd be over there every day in the library, making copies whatever. 
R:  You like parents like that, uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean I help, and just come in. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah we like that. 
L:  But, uh, it became very hard when I broke -- when my hip completely collapsed. 
R:  Oh, that's a shame. 
L:  So now I can't squat and bend, but I still show up at school, and I take her back and forth to school every day. 
R:  Okay. 
L:  But, uh, -- 
R:  Hey even that time driving the -- that's like you can make quality -- you know, you're in the car and you can talk and so forth  "Okay what ha-"  -- not just okay ask them how their day is but also go into, "Okay, what did you do?"  like, you know, "What happened?" y- you know [MN] -- talk about her day and so forth. 
L:  It makes a big difference -- can you hold on just a second? 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  What is it Jack?  [NOISE]  Yes you may have another cookie.  One more it's -- it's close to bed time.  Okay.
R:  Okay so --
L:  [LAUGH] It's about nine thirty here.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah s- same time here but of course, you know, this is me  -- being in this house alone right now cause he's working so it's like "Okay", but you know little people are going to come up and [LAUGH] like ask you questions and so forth, but I'm sure they are happy and the school -- anytime the school can get the family involved -- or a mother or even fathers -- I have a trip to the circus tomorrow. 
L:  Oh, the circus. 
R:  I know -- I must [inaudible] all must be crazy.  Um, we have a father going, 'cause I always tell fathers, "Fathers are allowed to go too, it's not just mum's that can go on trips" -- fathers can -- you know, I try to encourage them to be in their lives too.  You know, I don't care if the parents aren't married, they still -- you know, the fathers --
L:  Well I try -- I try my best to get my husband involved he's just not as involved as w- -- I am because he's an over the road truck driver.  He's gone. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  He drives coast to coast.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, I was on the verge of -- they were changing the school system and every thing over here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, I'm home school during the -- during the summer -- uh, go by the booklets set the -- and then we work on it during the summer to keep her fresh -- get her a little bit ahead, um, I've got is huge library.   [LAUGH]
R:  That's always good also. 
L:  [LAUGH] But, uh, no he doesn't  he's not as involved because he's not here.  He's here maybe a day a week. 
R:  Okay -- 
L:  He had to start doing that a couple of years ago. 
R:  Okay.  So he's, uh, -- he's on the road but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  So you have to really, like, -- if you're planning stuff I mean like vacations or something you have to sort of work around it or go anyway, but since you're -- you're not physically probably going on vacations.  [LAUGH]
L:  No we haven't been on vacation since I got hurt. 
R:  Yeah well I'm sure it will be like my mother -- I'm sure that 'cause she has [inaudible] the cancer weakens her bone, so what she's gonna do is, um, she'll be back better -- she'll be better again as we -- you know. 
L:  Well tell her not to let them do -- give her cortisone shots, in any shape or form. 
R:  She's not allowed -- she has a steroid but it's oral. 
L:  No don't take it, it weakens your bones even more.
R:  Really well --
L:  That was my problem.  See I got hit by a car. 
R:  Oh.
L:  And they were giving me steroid shots in my joints and I was taking steroids medication orally.  I found a very good specialist.  If he told me that they should never have given me any type of steroids because one, I had, uh, -- I've had cervical cancer. 
R:  Okay.
L:  And for two, it weakens the bone.  Now I need two hips replaced and a knee replaced, and it's not been ten years.  I'm thirty five years old. 
R:  See you're gonna have to do that and work around your kids --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and your husband and all that. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean I think you'll  -- you know a good thing is that you're young so that you can to that and, you know, but I'm sure --
L:  Well, no, they don't want you because the joint will only last fifteen years.  They want you to go as long as you can without it.  Plus I don't have the money to pay for it.  [LAUGH] So you can --
R:  That's ri- -- yeah.  That, you know, some of my mum's care -- even she has health insurance and actually she's never gonna -- she can't go back to work, but, you know, she had to go on my fathers -- she's going to have to go on my fathers now, but they sent bills to the house and I can -- I understand what you're saying because
