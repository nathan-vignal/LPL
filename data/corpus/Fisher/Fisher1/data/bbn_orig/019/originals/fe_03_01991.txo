L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi! My  --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- name is Eva and, I'm from West Virginia.
R:  My name is Annette and I live in Oregon.  
L:  Oh, my goodness, you're really far away.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I've always wanted to go there. [COUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's wet and rainy now, so, 
L:   that's what we're having, too, did you like today's discussion topic?
R:  Um, I don't know --
L:  I wasn't too --
R:  -- much about it, it was, ah, how the corporate scandals affected, what's your opinion on the corporate scandals, what 
L:  Well, I've  [LAUGH]
R:  -- can the Government do?
L:  Well, I  I've really  I don't know that much about it, either.  I just think that, ah, the rich are going to keep getting by with it, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:   they're not going to do anything with them, do you?
R:  I don't know, I know after the whole Enron thing, they really should step in, and curb the illeg-  illegal activity, 'cause I know a lot of people lost their pension plans with Enron, and, ah, other people were paying outrageous elect-  electricity bills, 
L:  I know 
R:   we're still paying outrageous electricity bills. [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, there's -- and there's some people that are never going to get that money back, and 
R:  Yeah.
L:   don't you think that people like Martha Stewart, that they could just keep, you know, they never get caught 
R:  They're still making money! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, it doesn't make sense that she's never had to stand up for what she's done, and her part.
R:  Right. 
L:  I agree, I think that the Government needs to step in, and we need to, ah,  somebody needs to be accountable, 'cause there's people that were CEO's, they're still living in their big mansions and they're not doing without anything.
R:  No.
L:  Mm ... Have you ever been to, ah, this side of the United States, to West Virginia?
R:  No, I've 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- been to DC once, when I was in eighth grade, 
L:  Uh-huh?
R:   that was a class trip.
L:  Oh, yes.  I think the farthest I've been towards your way would be, ah, Wisconsin.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] that's about as far as I've gone on the west side.  But, ah,  mhm.  Have you been doing these phone calls very long?
R:  No, I signed up on Tuesday, 
L:  Oh, 
R:   just this past Tuesday. [LAUGH]
L:  Is this your first one?
R:  My second one, I missed the first couple ones, I wasn't home [LAUGH] 
L:   now, we only get three, don't we?
R:  Um, we get three, but I think you can sign up to do more, a couple of people they're letting do more, 
L:  Right.
R:   and then you can always call into the system, too, I think.
L:  Well, I had, uh,  I've been having trouble with my phone number, I don't know if it was because I was using the zapper on my line, but  I was not receiving any phone calls, so then they gave me a email telling me I could initiate phone calls.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So that's what I've been trying to do lately and this is the first time that it's worked for me.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I did talk to a lady, ah, a month ago and she was in New York.  [MN] We had a interesting conversation because [COUGH] she had family overseas,  
R:  Oh, 
L:   and, you know, she was having mixed feelings about the war and everything, because she had loved ones she cared about too.
R:  Yeah,  this past --
L:  But, I tell y- -- huh?
R:  Pardon?
L:   [MN] go right ahead, I didn't mean to interrupt.
R:  Oh, I said, this past month, I have a lot of friends in the army and the marines, so I was calling their families to see if they'd been deployed or not.
L:  My, ah, son in law's in the marines, he just got back from over there.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, yeah, it  it means a lot to me, too, to keep up with this,  and especially on  I don't know if you watch Fox News Network, but it was so comforting to, you know, to have the reporters right there with all the military guys, letting us know what they were doing, and they got, you know, to talk to the family back them, and, 
R:  Yeah.
L:   it kind of gave me a bond with them, like, you know, they weren't so far away.
R:  I try not to watch the news too much, 'cause it's depressing.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It can be.  I just, you know, I think that, ah,  I'm just so relieved that the -- hopefully, the worst part's over with.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you just never know. [LAUGH]
R:  The news has kind of, like, kind of dropped their coverage of it.  They've kind of said, you know, the war is basically over, we're going to be occupying, and there isn't as much coverage as there was.  Even two weeks ago.
L:  Well, I just think that, ah, I think that sometimes we had too much focus on our men, because 
R:  Yeah.  
L:   we were telling everywhere they were, and if they were trying to sneak up on someone, they had no way of doing it.
R:  Right.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I totally agree with that. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  It was just something that -- it was interesting, though, to get to -- to see it first hand for a while.  But now, when you turn to the news, it just seems like it's so boring, because [LAUGH] it's back to the regular things. 
R:  [MN]
L:  And I miss some of it, I guess, 'cause it kept me company during the night, I was, you know, watching, but I'm just glad that I saw two of ships come home --home today and, it's just so wonderful to see the families reunite. [COUGH]  I've got a terrible sinus infection, you have to excuse me, I have [MN] to keep clearing my throat.
R:  No problem.
L:  [LAUGH] [COUGH] So, do you have anyone close in your family that's in the military?
R:  Um, no, my husband was in, but he's completely clear.  
L:  That's great.
R:  He's out.
L:  My son in law, was supposed to be out in January, 
R:  I heard they froze it, 
L:   and they would not let him out.
R:  -- yeah, our next door neighbor, his wife was almost done, she only had a couple of weeks left when they froze it, --
L:  Oh.
R:   and, um, called her back up, she's leaving in about two weeks.
L:  Oh, they're sending more out! I didn't know that.
R:  Yeah.  So 
L:   well, well, what branch is she in?
R:  She's in the army, 
L:  Oh, 
R:  So  
L:  -- well, I hope that she won't have to be long, it's so hard to take mothers away from the children, I think.
R:  Yeah, well, they don't have any kids, but, 
L:  Oh, 
R:  -- but still -- [LAUGH]
L:   it's still hard, isn't it?
R:  Yeah, she was looking forward to being done! [LAUGH]
L:  Right, I can't believe that there are still pe- people out there, because, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, we're sending so many home now.
R:  Yeah.  Well, one of our other neighbors, ah, was going to be sent to Afghanistan and they changed it to France.
L:  Oh, 
R:  So, and he's leaving at the end of May.
L:  Well, I'm sorry to hear all that, I 
R:  So 
L:  -- hadn't been keeping up with that, since, you know, I thought that it was over.
R:  Yeah, they're still, I guess, they're still doing things in other places, so  
L:  Right, 
R:   we're  we're glad they changed his posting though.
L:  Well, I know they're trying to find, you know, all those hidden documents and things, and that's going to put our men in jeopardy, too, because -- 
R:  Uh.
L:  -- they want us out, now, they say, okay, w- we've won, you all get out, United States, and we can't do that.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  We got to hand it over to somebody responsible, and, and that's going to be hard, trying to decide who's going to, you know, rule the country now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause they think -- already think the United States is really aggressive, so we really need to kind of tiptoe around them, [LAUGH] and get out and, get our guys back home.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.  [COUGH] well, let's see, I'm trying to think of what else.  [MN] Oregon, are you anywhere mere Portland?
R:  Ah, I'm near Portland, I'm in one of the suburbs.
L:  I had a -- one of the nurses training my best friend was from Portland, Oregon, 
R:  Oh, 
L:  I had a -- she had a funny last name  Diske[?]?  I had never heard that name before, and so, um, it was interesting to, ah, to finally meet someone who was from Oregon, she never got to go home on holidays or anything, because we only had a week off, and 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- Oregon's so far away! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- well, um, I actually grew up in California, I moved here four years ago, 
L:  California?
R:  Yeah, I grew up in LA.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, you're lucky.  I bet you loved it there.  
R:  Um, for the most part,  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:   most of my family and friends are still there, so 
L:  Oh, now, are you not --
R:   I miss them a lot. 
L:  Are you that far away from them now, traveling?
R:  Um, it's about eleven hundred miles.  
L:  Oh, I didn't realise, oh, my goodness.
R:  Yeah.  California is a very long, skinny state, so  [LAUGH]
L:  I know, I mean, I've never been there, I would be afraid to go there, it's -- 'cause you got earthquakes, and mudslides.  [LAUGH]
R:  See, I can't stand tornadoes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:   earthquakes, no problem!
L:  I- I can live my tornadoes, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I don't think I'd like --
R:   I don't want, you know, 
L:  Oh, isn't that funny. [COUGH]
R:  -- when the wind picks you up, that's wrong.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  It's funny though, I bet -- you really don't have many earthquakes, though, do you?
R:  Ah, Oregon doesn't really have any, -- [LAUGH]
L:  I meant, oh, I meant, pertaining to 
R:   but in California, 
L:  -- California, right.
R:  Um, --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- there's lots of little ones 
L:  Uh-huh?
R:   I mean, I grew up with them, the last big one was in nineteen ninety four.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, 
L:  Oh, I know, it was the 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I was at the ball game, 'cause I was watching the World Series.
R:  Ah, that's that was nineteen eighty eight. But -- 
L:  Oh, that was terrible.
R:  Yeah.  That one was pretty bad.  Um, we call it the Northridge quake, because that's where it was centered, and then, ah, it happened, ah, round the Martin Luther King holiday.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So 
L:  Mm.
R:   but that one was pretty bad, and most of the valley where it was centered was destroyed, so 
L:  Mm.  It just -- to make you just so helpless, but I guess we are with any kind of, ah 
R:  Natural disaster.
L:  Right, we really are.  [COUGH] Mm.  Well, I bet you, you don't have any sinus problems, I tell you, we have such wet 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:   weather here, and that's -- that's been my biggest problem.
R:  Yeah.  Actually, there are, because it's, um, the trees and everything are starting to bloom?  This is the worst state for allergies, so 
L:  Oh, it couldn't be any worse than West Virginia.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I hate it --
L:  Oh --
R:  Well, they grow grass seed here, so 
L:  Oh, 
R:  -- um, certain areas of the state are really bad.  I never had allergies before I moved here.  So, oh 
L:  I was born and raised in West Virginia, but 
R:  Yeah.
L:   I went to nursing school in Virginia and, lived down there for eleven years, 
R:  Uh-huh?
L:   the whole time I was down there  it's a dry, hot climate  I had no sinus problems.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:   none, and now I have [inaudible]
