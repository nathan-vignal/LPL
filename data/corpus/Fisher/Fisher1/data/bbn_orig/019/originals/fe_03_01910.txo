L:  Hi, I'm Therese McCracken.
R:  I'm Wendy.  How are you doing?
L:  Fine, how are you?
R:  Good.
L:  Uh, do you have any children?
R:  No, I'm still only twenty four.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, uh, then what does family mean to you at th- at that age then?
R:  Well, I think it just means, you know, people who love and support you and will always be there for you no matter what.
L:  That -- that sounds good.  Um, I have a four children and a husband and, um, I think, my opinion of family that there's many different families as far as we have a church family that we're very involved with and fond of and, uh, our view of family on the -- our inner circle of our fo- or our six is supporting and loving each other like [NOISE] -- like what you've said and, um -- but with being a parent also it's part of the discipline thing and trying to get your children to do -- to do what's right, even when it's hard.  And, uh, I'm very grateful for my family.  A lot of times I get stressed out and challenged but I think that's part of being a mom also.
R:  [LAUGH] Definitely.  And, like you said, a family, you know, doesn't necessarily have to mean biology.  It's just anyone who's, you know, really close to you and gives you that love and support.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It doesn't have to be, you know, someone who you're related to.
L:  Yeah, it makes me think of when I worked and, um, then it -- it was -- it was a family in that point of view, even though we wasn't blood related, uh, you knew about everybody and what was going on and that actually my Goodyear family, because I worked at Goodyear, and was, um, you know, you were affected [NOISE] by what affected them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] And you hated to hear of their sorrows and you rejoiced with them when there was happiness and so -- and -- and that's the same way with the church family also.  And it -- it's amazing how many different families you can have because then you also have your -- your mom and your dad and your sisters and brothers and all the ones -- nieces and nephews you care for.
R:  Mm, definitely.
L:  And so that's, um -- it's amazing when you actually think about it and -- and I -- I tend to take it for granted, and now just sitting here and talking with you about it.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I think everybody takes it for granted until, you know, that day comes along when they really need, you know, someone to be there for them and -- and then it's a family member and they realize how important they are.
L:  Yeah, well I think -- you know it makes me think about the -- the m- the war [NOISE] that's going on with Iraq and how --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- uh, there's many mothers and fathers [NOISE] that are over there and family back here missing them and we are so blessed.
R:  Definitely.
L:  Uh, that we -- you know, myself didn't go.  My brother may end up going still even though the war's [NOISE] potentially over --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the separation is really hard but, I think, that also if it's a real strong family it'll pull you closer together with --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just know that, you know, that support system is there.
R:  Definitely.
L:  [NOISE] And -- do you have any brothers and sisters?
R:  I have one brother, he's an older brother.
L:  Is he -- are you close to him?
R:  Yeah, we've always been like very close and, you know, I always idolized him growing up and, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- now that we're both adults, you know, we're -- we help each other out and we're just close like that.
L:  Oh, is he married?
R:  Yes.
L:  So, see -- yeah, and that's probably just another extension [NOISE] of family, as far as his wife and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- children and -- does he have any kids [NOISE]?
R:  No, they just got married recently.
L:  Oh, well -- well, see then you're looking forward to nieces and nephews and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Definitely. [LAUGH]
L:  Spoil these young 'uns.  Yeah, and that's -- I have got a sister in Florida and, well I'm from North Carolina, I don't even know where you're from.
R:  New York.
L:  Oh, okay [NOISE] and, um, I don't get to see her that often and so it -- it does.  I call here quite often and just to be able to talk with her.  She's got five children.
R:  Wow!
L:  And, uh, so it's -- you get to hear each one -- about each one and it -- it's just, you know, you love 'em so much and hate to be so far away from 'em.
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] And then with, uh -- I've got all my other -- other family here with -- as far as my mother and -- I've got two brothers and, uh, two sisters and so I'm closer to all my other nephews and nieces [NOISE] and, uh, it is it's precious.  We almo- we almost all of us go to the same church [NOISE] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and so that -- that brings another closeness [NOISE] and so we -- all I know is I'd been depressed just to have the -- you know, just, uh -- you d- -- when you're getting to the point where you are -- don't know where to go it's nice to be able to turn to family that care about ya and love ya anyway.
R:  Right.
L:  They can look past, you know, your faults and say, you know, "I'm here for ya [NOISE] and I'll care of your needs or I'll support you with whatever you decide" so that's [NOISE] -- that's a good thing.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- even when I went away to college and I didn't have my family around there, you know, your friends that you live with they become your family and --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, now where'd you go to college?
R:  Um, in New York.
L:  Oh, where are you from originally?
R:  New York.
L:  Oh, okay so you just moved -- you just moved out of home?
R:  Right.
L:  Oh, okay [NOISE] yeah.  And that's [NOISE], you know, any -- I think any time that you have that close sort of relationship where you're talking to them every day and you're spending time with them and eating meals and cleaning up after each other and all the w- all the things that go with living together it -- it is -- it's, uh, so personalized.
R:  Mm.
L:  And if you get along with 'em or you don't get along with them, and it -- well the thing with -- with family you don't get to choose.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You do choose your friends but you can't choose family.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And even if you get along with them or not you're still in that situation so, hopefully, as you mature it -- it gets better.
R:  Right, you learn to get along with them.
L:  Yeah.  It wa- I grew up with, uh -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I have a twin and then my other two older siblings and then I have a younger sibling that's ten years younger.  And I was just the brunt of everything --
R:  Mm.
L:  And, um, as we became teenagers we were further apart but as we became adults, because we're all in our thirties now, except for the younger sibling, um, we have a good relationship where I can call each one and share with them and they share with me and it's -- it's a better relationship and I'm grateful that you can get to that age where you no longer get upset [NOISE] about every little thing and, you know, you -- you've matured enough that, you know, the bad things, even though they are bad, you can get through 'em.
R:  Right.
L:  And be supportive.  And then we have to have a dog that's part of our family.
R:  Oh, that's true.  I forgot, I didn't even think about that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, you know, for a lot of families -- my -- my dad and his wife, uh, they have three dogs and that's their babies.  And my brother and his wife, even though they have -- she has two children, it's his stepchildren, they have three dogs and that's their babies.  I mean, they do everything for 'em and that -- when they go places they take their dogs.
R:  Mm.
L:  And that -- they have even have family photos with the animals.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, you know, it is amazing when you start thinking about people with their family, that's -- you know, that's what they consider these are our babies.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I hear them say it all the time. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And so, even though they -- and they love our children, they've, um -- I've got a one year old and a three year old, a twelve and a fifteen year old and they have just taken the two youngest children and just have -- have adopted 'em.  And they love the older ones but they can't hold them on their knee any more, so ...
R:  Right.
L:  It's really amazing to see how families change and mature and, um, we had moved away for a year and when we came home it was a very humbling experience to see that all my nieces and nephews had grown and some of them had -- had even outgrew me.
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] As far as height and, uh, I'm like -- it's just amazing 'cause life doesn't stop [NOISE] just because I'm not here.  And you would -- you would love to think that everything stopped at home until you get back and that's just not the case.  But it -- it is good to know that the family relationship is still there.
R:  Definitely.
L:  And so, we've been very blessed and it sounds like you're -- d- do you have a good relationship with your parents?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Are you dating anybody?
R:  No.
L:  Uh-oh. [LAUGH]
R:  Focussing on my school.
L:  Oh, that's good.  What are you going to school for?
R:  Lawyer.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, that's wonderful, con- congratulations.
R:  Thank you.
L:  That's a -- a big goal to be going for so ...
R:  Well, I'm graduating in a month so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow, that's wonderful [NOISE].  Con- -- well, that's even more congratulations.
R:  Thank you.
L:  Um, well I wish you much success with that and then you'll be -- after that goal is reached, which will be pretty soon, you'll be looking to start a family hopefully in the next few years and, uh, meet the right guy and then it doesn't take long and then children come out -- come -- come about.
R:  Eventually. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, they do and they're -- they're wonderful --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they're -- they're a blessing.  We've -- there's many challenges but there's -- there's many blessings that also come with being a mom and, uh, I'm also in school myself, even though I have so many kids [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, uh, they're all real supportive of me being in school.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  And so that's -- that's one of the blessing also.  My family's real supportive too which is amazing, uh, that they care if I -- if I do well and, you know, they want me to succeed and I -- I think that's a part of being a family is --
R:  Mm, exactly.
L:  -- everybody caring about each other and wanting the best.  Is your parents really proud?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I bet they are, I bet they're about to bust.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Now, were you home schooled any at all?
R:  No.
L:  Yeah, I, uh, I actually home schooled my children last year and that brought us even closer together because of the -- you know, you spend twenty four seven together.
R:  Right.
L:  And it just -- [NOISE] you know, it is a lot of time but it also [NOISE] was, uh, very amazing to, uh, bond with the -- the kids [NOISE] that way and they didn't all the peer pressure so they -- they didn't have to conform.
R:  Mm.
L:  And -- and one of the hard things about being a teenager, with my daughter being fifteen, is that [NOISE] you -- you look at all your friends and you -- you're judging yourself on what they wear, what they do, what their expectations are [NOISE] and then you -- if you don't have that to be around [NOISE] then it's, uh, a lot better for you to, um, co- conform to what your parents would have you to do.
R:  Right.
