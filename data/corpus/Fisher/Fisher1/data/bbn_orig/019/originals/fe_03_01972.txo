L:  Hi, I'm Shauna Stanton. 
R:  [NOISE] I'm Pam Weiner.
L:  I see you have children. [LAUGH]
R:  Ye- --
L:  I just put mine down.
R:  Yes.  Um, I have, I have two children.
L:  Okay.  Have you done these surveys before?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, neither -- me -- neither have I.  So, um, I guess we just talk about, ah, the corporate scandals?  Was that correct?
R:  Right.
L:  Okay.  Um, have the affected your life at all?
R:  Well, I certainly feel like, um, you know, because, you know, there, there's so much crime involved that it does affect, you know, the, the middle class America, 'cause, you know, the government has to bail all of these, ah, corporations out, and then it costs all of us.
L:  Right.
R:  So.
L:  Um, it seems to me that it's, like, they, um, sometimes the government's even in on them.
R:  Right.
L:  And then they, you know, they put them away, and, um, you know, it's, like, they -- they get screwed out of their money.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know -- I -- I'm not trying to -- I'm not getting out what I'm trying to say. [LAUGH] Um, ah, --
R:  Yeah, um, yeah, so it's very, you know, it's very hard to, to, you know, hear all of these things going on and, um, you know, and here, you know, my husband's working sixty, seventy hours a week and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and -- you know, when I hear about all this corruption, and ah, the taxes in our area are, you know, really really high, and, you know, and I just think, you know, you know, all this is going on, you know.  So.  Um, --
L:  Well, I think that, um, for one they need to get the corrupt people out of office. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you know, that could put a stop to some of it, because I know that -- you know, how, how are they doing this all by themselves?  The government has to be involved somehow.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, I mean, you know, maybe not to the fullest, but, you know, they talk about the, the crimes, you know, stuff getting over the border and things like that.  Well, there are corrupt government officials that let it get over the border.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  And, um, you know, but there's, there's only so much that, um, you know that, you know, we're trying to control everything in all of our lives -- you know, in all of our lives. 
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, you know and so, um, you know, like there's so much money that has to go to other things, and that's why there's not enough money for the borders, to protect the borders.  And, um, -- so you know, that goes on too.  I mean, they've had to cut down on the amount of people that can be watching over the borders.
L:  Right.
R:  But that could also be because we've spent so money -- so much money bailing out, you know, all these corporations. [LAUGH] So.
L:  Yeah, and they're the one -- they're the ones that is doing illegal activity, and then, you know, we indict them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then we just pass it off, and they get cleared in the free, and, and I read an article in the paper where the government paid them back, you know, so much money.  You know, corporate businesses get more money than anybody I know, and they're -- as far as taxes and the IRS and things like that.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, you know, us, you know, middle class families, we're sitting here with, you know, nothing.
R:  Mm.
L:  And why the corporate businesses, they get in trouble, um, and then they're back in business a couple of weeks later --
R:  Yeah, with a new name, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- yeah.  And, ah, -- yeah, but you know, somebody else, you know, like these small -- and small businesses, they may do the exact thing as these corporate, you know, corporations and, you know, people go to jail.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  And it's because they don't have enough money and the government wants somebody with money so they can, in return, receive more taxes from the bigger corporations.
R:  Mm.  Yeah.  'Cause I always -- you know, I mean, I often hear about small businesses.  I mean, although they're doing illegal things --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, ah, you know, I do hear about, you know, somebody going away for five years and six years.  You know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But.  You know, I mean they -- I mean, there are people that -- I mean, you do hear about bigwigs at corporations, you know, they, you know, they do go to jail, but you know, it just seems like they do get away with so much.
L:  Yeah.  A lot gets pushed under the rug.
R:  Mm.  Well, lots of times, lots of times the people who are in office, you know, they are -- they also have an investment in these big companies.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, it happens all the time.
L:  Yep.
R:  You know.  You hear about it all of the time.  So.
L:  So, how do you think, ah, you know, our government can stop it?  Are you for Bush, or --
R:  Well, ah, --
L:  [LAUGH] Yes or no?
R:  You know, um, you know, you know with foreign policy, I am.  I -- you know, I always feel like -- I feel safer when a Republican is in office.
L:  Right.
R:  I really do.  But I feel like the economy is always better when a Democrat is in office. [LAUGH] So -- you know, I mean, at least -- I mean, I'm talking -- I mean, I'm really not that old.  I mean, I'm thirty something years old, so -- but what -- you know, from -- from the time that I remember back, you know, it always seemed like I always did better under a Democrat.  But then I wouldn't really want a Democrat in office when I was -- you know, when we were in the midsts of a war.  So. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's just -- that's just my opinion. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, how do you think we can crack down on the corporate scandals?
R:  Um, [SIGH] well --
L:  I mean, not we as the people, but you know, um, maybe we can write letters to our senator about, you know, what our position is and how we think they should go about doing it.  I mean, sometimes they do listen to smaller people.
R:  Mm.  And, um, you know what, and I think it really has to be put down on paper exactly how this affects families.  You know, if somebody really -- if they actually looked at it and, you know, and saw how, you know, how we could, you know, we are spending so much money on this kind of thing, and um, you know, and, you know, and there's so many programs that we could be giving that money to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to help people.  And it's really unfortunate.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, but -- you know, when we get -- when -- you know, when they're -- we're at -- our country is in the midsts of, you know, a huge corporate scandal, you know, everybody's looking to how, how do we get out of it, you know, how is this gonna be -- how is this gonna be taken care of, you know.
L:  Right, instead of just taking responsibility for what they've done to begin with --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and then they pay these high, high, you know, attorneys millions of dollars to get them off --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and so there's more money wasted over something they know they've done to begin with --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, you know, um, --
R:  And then it just -- it sets -- it sets up other con- other companies to do the exact same thing, 'cause, you know, they're like, well, you know, we'll get away with it.
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, you know, and that's unfortunate.
L:  You live in a big city?
R:  No, we live in a small town.
L:  Yeah, so do I, so --
R:  I have cows living down the street from me. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I had cows out --
R:  And turkeys across the street.
L:  -- my back yard not too long ago, so [LAUGH] um.  Are you from New York -- area?
R:  No, Massachusetts.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm here in Illinois. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I got a lot, lot of farm land.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, you know, I live right across from Saint Louis and there's a lot of corporate businesses over there that, you know, I get the, ah, Saint Louis Post dispatch, and it seems like almost every week there's something in there about a corporate business --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, doing something wrong and, um, I think us taxpayers are the ones that are paying to -- not to -- I think we should be paying more to prevent it.
R:  Right.
L:  And we're actually paying to, um, in a way, endorse it, you know.
R:  Right.  Mm.
L:  And, you know, just by buying maybe the products that they sell, or, you know, -- 
R:  You know, but, but we have seen that in the past, where comp- -- where people have boycotted companies, and then within a few months, you know, I mean, people just go back to doing what they were going -- what they were doing, you know.  It doesn't last very long.  People tend not to boycott for very
