L:  Hello, this is Helen -- 
R:  Hello.
L:  Helen Min- Minnoy[?].
R:  Hello, my name is Lisa.  I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch your name.
L:  It's Helen.
R:  Helen, hi Helen.
L:  Hi, Lisa.  [PAUSE]
R:  Um, I'm not sure I clearly heard the-- the topic other than family.
L:  I guess that that was it, that's all she -- 
R:  That was it? Okay -- 
L:  Yeah, that was it. [LAUGH]
R:  -- I didn't know if it was something about -- something more than that.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.  
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  Oh.  Do you have a -- do you have a family? 
R:  Um, I am -- I'm single.  Um, but I have one -- one parent who is living and, ah, I'm an only child.
L:  Oh.  Well --
R:  How about yourself? [LAUGH]
L:  I have -- I have an older brother. 
R:  Okay.
L:  But I'm -- I have four children of my own who are all grown.  I have four sons.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] But -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they -- they live all over the country so I have one in Alaska, one in Florida, one in, ah, Massachusetts and one in Maine so I-- I don't see them very often. [LAUGH] So --
R:  Wow, that -- that must be difficult.
L:  It is, it is.  'Cause as far as family, my parents are pass -- have passed away and my brother lives in Chicago so I really don't have a close family.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Which -- which is too bad.  It's not what I would have wanted for a family.  It's not what -- it wasn't my idea of a family when I was growing up.  I wanted, you know, a close -- a close family but I guess that doesn't always happen.
R:  That's true, that's true.  Actually, I, um, although my family is -- is much smaller, I'm [inaudible] the ones that are but I do have -- I'm not very close to them either, so I can -- I can understand that, but, ah, I guess I -- I look forward to having a family of my own some day.
L:  Right, right.  Well, my sons -- my -- I have one son that has got three kids and then the other three sons, two aren't married, they live with their significant others.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And the -- I have another son who's been married seven years but they have -- both have great careers, so I don't know about kids.  It's hard to say.
R:  Right.
L:  So I don't know.  I guess -- and -- and you have so many, ah, you know, what's the word I want?  Stuck parents and, um, -- oh, what's-- joined families, you know.  Ah, I don't know what the word "family", it's not like it used to be for me anyway.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, that's true.  Um, in fact sometimes I'm not close with my blood relations.  I do consider some of my closer friends more so my family.
L:  You've got it, you've got it because I know I spend a lot of time with -- I have a -- a friend who is -- actually much younger than I am but his family and I are -- are very close.  So they kind of adopted me and I spend holidays with them and more so than my own family.  So I guess -- I guess the word "family" means a lot of different things or can -- can mean a lot of different things.
R:  Um, that's true, that's true.  In fact, my -- my boyfriend's family has somewhat adopted me already even though we're not, you know, engaged or married yet, so, like, you know, I certainly see what you mean, mhm.
L:  But that makes it nice, makes it nice if you're close.  I -- I know I -- I was -- I have been married twice and my both in laws were -- I was very close to them and, ah, they make, you know, 'cause my mother, I am -- I am from Canada and my mother lives up there and I live down in the States so it was nice to have, like, a second set of parents on both sides so I was lucky in that, you know, that way.  We did get along really well.  But, no, I don't know if -- I don't think -- I -- I -- I assume you said you have got a boyfriend, so you haven't got children obviously yet? 
R:  Right, not yet, no.
L:  Though nowadays that doesn't seem to be the case either. [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.  I [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true, there are a lot of families with, ah, that don't have married parents. 
L:  I know, they have the kids first and then get married, I know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I'm from the era where I'm still not quite with that. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Back when it was the other way around. [LAUGH] 
L:  But, ah, I -- I -- I don't know how I feel [LAUGH] but I have mixed feelings, but -- 
R:  Oh, well, I -- I mean, I -- I feel that it's -- that it -- that it can work out.  I mean, people might have difficult circumstances especially if it was an unplanned child but -- 
L:  Right.
R:  But-- I mean, I -- I even know couples who are not married who plan to and had children even before they were married and that wasn't a purposeful thing -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and it's worked out for them, so -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, I think they have -- they have great families even if it may not be like a traditional nuclear family used to be.
L:  I know.  It's -- it's funny 'cause I was brought up in a very conservative family.  We were very -- and no such word as "divorce" in our family. And, ah, you know, we were -- I -- I won't say religious fanatics 'cause that wasn't the case but it was church every Sunday, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And Sunday school, and it was just -- it was just so very different than what it is now, and even my own kids.  I brought my own, you know, my own children up very differently, so, but I wouldn't -- I wouldn't trade my childhood for anything, nothing, not when I look back and I see what's going on nowadays.  It's like, no, I'm -- I'm glad I had the type of childhood.  My dad died when I was fourteen so obviously it changed.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Rather, you know, when I was young.
R:  Right.
L:  But, and my mom never remarried, so -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, I -- I did miss the man's influence in my life.  I think that's why I've been married twice. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, [LAUGH] I don't think I learned how to get along with them.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, no.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I guess one really never knows what -- what caused that. [LAUGH]
L:  No, no, I -- I think I became very strong though and -- and strong willed and strong, you know, opinionated [LAUGH] and I wasn't a yes, yes person.  So -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and the kind of men that I happened to be attracted to were the type that didn't, you know, that I guess wanted to be in control.  So it was always a -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  No, my kids have -- my kids have all married strong women.  Isn't it-- it's funny how you look -- you look and you see -- we are -- I guess we are what we're -- we are a product of our, ah, you know, bringing up.
R:  Oh, that's true.  I mean, you can definitely see how your family shapes you for the -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  For the better or worse.
L:  Yeah, very much so.
R:  And you can see it reflected in future, ah, generations as well.
L:  Right, very much so.  In fact, I married two only children.  And, um, -- well, I don't know.  I have -- as I say, I come from -- I have a brother, but it just seemed that I was drowned and, you know, even now, men that I dated have never been married.  Both of them are only children.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it's like, whoa, there's something wrong here.  Because I -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I happen to -- I would -- I would like -- I would like my family to be closer, I really would.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, big family get togethers and I envy -- I envy people like that.  My dad was one of twelve, so, and my mom was -- 
R:  Oh, wow, that's a -- that's a big family.
L:  Yeah, mhm, yeah.  And my mother was -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- one of five girls so, yeah, I come from a fairly good sized family but -- 
R:  Mm, I'd -- I'd always wished that I had a -- a sibling.  It's, ah, difficult being only child in many ways and, of course, you know, everyone else, especially when you're -- you're kids, they say "Oh, you're so lucky, you get everything".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, yeah, it's true.  I had eve- -- I was spoiled and, you know, I was able to, you know, get everything just for me, but, you know, it's just not the same.
L:  Right, right. 
R:  Not having someone -- someone around so I know that if I have one child I'd definitely have to have one more. [LAUGH]
L:  One more, yeah.
R:  Because I don't -- I don't want just to have an only child.
L:  Right.  I always said that too and I didn't plan on four, but [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I always said that, you know, I would have liked two.  That was my plan way back, but, ah, -- but my brother and I, I mean, there was two of us but we are not close at all, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you would think we would be because he's, you know, we're -- we're the only living of, you know, of this generation and, ah, we both have parents that, you know, have passed on, but, no, no, we're not.  I tried, not like I didn't want it and not like I didn't try, but it just -- he was a workaholic or he is a workaholic, and he just doesn't have time for anything but, you know, work and his own family.  He is close to, you know, his immediate family, but -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Were you able to rely upon each other when your parents passed at that time in your life?
L:  Well, my dad died when I was fourteen and my brother was eighteen and he did -- he supported my mother and I until I got out of high school so he was very good.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  And, ah, he's been there for me several times, but he's just, ah-- he's not an outgoing person like I am.  He's-- he's quiet.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he would never be doing what I'm doing now.  [LAUGH] He is just -- we're just very -- two dif- -- you'd never know we come from the same parents, never.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  He has done very well with his life.  He has had a great career and he set goals and he went after them.  Me, I kind of floundered and my -- my idea was going to get married, have my kids, my little house with the white picket fence, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  That's -- that's what I wanted back then, that's -- I would have been very happy.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But unfortunately the first man that I married didn't feel that way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He didn't really want kids so that was a big bone of contention, and even though we had three, he didn't want the responsibility, so -- but, and he doesn't have anything to do with them now.  So talk about family, it's, ah, really -- yeah, my -- my kids have-- yeah, I think -- I don't even know if my kids have an idea of what, you know, they don't have a childhood to look back on like I do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'm -- I'm glad I did have -- I did--
