R:  Hi, I'm Lenora. 
L:  Hi, I'm Ted. 
R:  Hi, Ted, I, um, this is a big broad topic today. 
L:  Yes, it is and they're asking like three questions in one it seems. 
R:  Yes, but I do think that, um, that the major corporations and all the scandal has a lot to do with our economy today because, um, a lot of money was lost through Enron and some of the other big boys. 
L:  Yeah, I think you're -- you're definitely right about that. 
R:  And what do we think that they can do to curve it?
L:  I think they can for one thing, put the big boys in jail?
R:  And real. 
L:  Throw away the key, I'm sorry. 
R:  Real jail, not --
L:  Right. 
R:  Not the luxury prison. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, not the luxury prisons where they are getting caviar and lobster and hard time. 
L:  Right. 
R:  Put 'em on the chain line. 
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Where are you -- are you from New York?
R:  No, I'm from Philadelphia. 
L:  Oh, okay.  I knew it had to be New York, Philadelphia or New Jersey, somewhere in there. 
R:  Where are you from? 
L:  I'm fr- in Atlanta. 
R:  Oh, all right. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  So, yeah, so it's just that, you know, they do -- they do the crime but it's blue collar so they act like it's nothing major.  But it affected a whole lot of people, their pensions and just -- it -- it's an tumbling effect, you know.  They start at the stop but it comes down to the -- to the cleaning people because they lose pensions and, you know, their livelihood.  They work twenty years and they think they have a pension in there and they don't have any money.  It's a sad, sad situation. 
L:  It really is.  [COUGH] So what do you think should be done to curb this kind of thing?
R:  I think they should have more monitoring of these major companies, you know, being that they do have the financial status they have their own accountants and all that, government need to have some kind of systems in place to monitor those people because it's just like you have carte blanche, you are working for the person that -- the person that has the money that is doing the scam is paying you so you pad the books to make your, um, person look good.  They have to do something because it can't continue on like -- continue on the way it is. 
L:  Yeah, I agree.  I don't -- I don't know exactly what's going to be done but I think that's probably one thing that -- I think -- excuse me, I think one of the main things that can be done to discourage that type of behaviour is simply to punish people who are -- who are proven to be guilty of it. 
R:  Openly. 
L:  Stop them in their tracks and make examples of them openly.  And like you said, send them to real jail, you know, just like they would anybody else because if you or I or any -- I'm assuming, you know, that you you're not one of these people who works in, you know, who was in top level at a top level management position in a corporation?
R:  Right. 
L:  Um, but if you're in that situation and -- and you have access to or you have an opportunity to participate in that type of behaviour, I think that, um, you need to be stopped in your tracks.  I mean, something -- like you say, has to be done to stop it. 
R:  Right, because it's not -- it's -- it's not a small -- it's not a small crime.  It's, you know, it's not a small crime to get a couple of headlines in the paper then it's not hurting no more.  What actually happens to those people that were found guilty in Enron?  Do we ever know, no. 
L:  Right. 
R:  It's not in the news no more. 
L:  And you know what is funny to me is you have people who write bad checks, and I'm not saying that it's right to write a bad check. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  To a merchant or to anybody else, but you can get prison time if you can thinking of writing bad checks. 
R:  Right. 
L:  And yet, I mean, I have known people who have gotten, you know, maybe five years, ten years, whatever, depending on how much was involved, for writing a bad check and yet these people can steal literally millions of dollars from people and also [inaudible] from thousands of people. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And nothing happens. 
R:  Yes.  And I believe the stock -- the stock market actually is affected by it because all these big corporations are reporting that they have all this gain and once they do the paperwork, it's just paper money.  They actually don't have all that money so the stock markets are affected by these corrupt, you know, people. 
L:  Well, and the other way that they're affected too is the fact that people like you and me, ah, typically become more, ah, -- more distrusting. 
R:  Right. 
L:  Of corporate America in general.  I know I'm more distrusting.  That alone with the fact that we know that -- well, along with the fact that I was reading not long ago that a lot of the, ah, the top level managers in corporations get these huge bonuses besides already being paid really, really well.  In addition to that, they get these big, big, big bonuses. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  For meeting certain goals. 
R:  Right. 
L:  And even when their -- when their jobs are eliminated -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- they're the first ones who are, um, provided for.  I mean, it's like screw all the rest of you. 
R:  Right. 
L:  You know, all the rest of the employees. 
R:  The hard working ones. [LAUGH] 
L:  You just have to do the best can you.  You -- you might get, you know, maybe a couple of months pay or something like that, but it seems like they get huge bonuses and they're taken care of for life, you know. 
R:  Right, so now people that have a little bit of money that want to invest in some stock are scared now because of these major corporations that are scam -- scamming so we won't take our little bit of change --
L:  Yeah, and put it in the stock market. 
R:  And put it in the stock market. 
L:  Instead, I think a lot of people are going with the more conservative investments like real estate. 
R:  Right. 
L:  T bills. 
R:  Or bonds. 
L:  Um, bonds and things like that that are a little bit like I said a lot more conservative. 
R:  But they don't have big returns, you know. 
L:  Right. 
R:  They have smaller returns but they have more security. 
L:  Right, more security, less risk?
R:  Right, right and that, you know, and it's all of us have our -- a lot of us have our pensions and our 401Ks invested into the stock market so, you know, if we're not retiring within twenty years, what do we look at, you know? 
L:  Right. 
R:  With all this scandal and all this stuff going on.  Will there be any money?  Will there be any social security?  [LAUGH] because they want to take our social security benefits and invest it. 
L:  Yeah, that's true. 
R:  So it's -- it's a major concern. 
L:  That's a pretty sad state of affairs.  And I think, like you said, something must be done and quickly.  Otherwise, I guess we are all kind -- of our pensions will go in the hell in the hand basket so to speak. 
R:  You have to come from the top -- the top man. 
L:  Yeah, and speaking of that, I mean, I haven't been real impressed with our current administration. 
R:  No. 
L:  In terms of actions taken against people who have committed those kinds of crimes.  I don't think there's going to be very much done either because, I mean, when you think about it, I mean, you don't cut off the source that feeds you so to speak. 
R:  Right, that's it -- that's it.  That's the bottom line [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's the bottom line, so those big corporations funds a lot of the political campaigns and things to that nature, so if you are going after them, then that means the money that they are putting into you are going to cease.  So we all [LAUGH] so let's quiet it down, let's put it in the headlines a couple of days, let it die down, get another big issue and then people will kind of press this under the table. 
L:  Right, and that's what has happened since we have been involved with this war with Iraq. 
R:  Right. 
L:  Because people aren't talking quite as much as -- about -- about the economy.  People are still losing jobs, but when you look at the fact that people are losing their lives in the war with Iraq -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- that kind of took a back seat. 
R:  Took a back seat. 
L:  Yeah, so -- 
R:  Some other corporation is -- is doing the same thing that Enron was doing but he's getting away with it right now. 
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And eventually it -- it will come to light. 
R:  Yes, but after he has made millions of dollars. 
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  And have put it somewhere where it may never be found. 
L:  And the thing that gets me too is that these people really are in need of the money much less than the average person.  I mean, they're already making millions of dollars.  I mean, they would make that whether they stole money or not. 
R:  Right. 
L:  But in addition to the money that they're already getting paid, the salaries and the bonuses and all the other perks, they can't settle for that.  They've got to steal, got to scam and scrounge around to, ah, to get more. 
R:  It's that cut the rope attitude, you know.  You know, just go after the jug- jugular and get whatever I can get.  Don't care who it's going to affect, and it not only affects those immediate people in their company, it affects all of us in some way or another. 
L:  Well, I think it -- it starts to affect, like you say, not just the investors of the particular corporation that's affected, you know, where the scam takes place, but it also affects people's attitudes towards corporate America in general. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Which in turn affects our national economy. 
R:  Yes, and -- and national economy needs to be affected in a positive way right now. 
L:  Yeah, you -- you better believe that. 
R:  [LAUGH] Because it has enough negativity going on around us that we need to bring something positive so if he showed us that he was working to do something with these --
