L:  Hello?
R:  Hi -- Hello.  I'm Jodie.
L:  And my name is June.
R:  How are you doing?
L:  Okay, and yourself?  
R:  I'm fine, thank you.
L:  Ah, this is my first call.
R:  Mine too.
L:  Oh, okay, [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so I hope we can do it correctly.
R:  Okay, um, they said that the topic was what does family means to you?
L:  Yes, right.
R:  Okay, and well, ah, do you want me to start, or --
L:  Yeah, well, why don't you begin? 
R:   Okay, um, well, to me, family is your support system, that -- there's -- it doesn't necessarily have to be people that you're related to, like, by blood -- 
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- that you just have a common relationship, because you've grown up together, or, you're always there for each other and I mean my family is my best friends, my husband's best friends, people that I could go to if there was a problem, and --
L:  [MN] That's, that's interesting, because I, ah, think of family as nex- next of kin.  Um, ah, I am an only child, so that the only family that I have living is my father who has Alzheimer's disease, and, ah, he's, ah, ninety three and I'm sixty three, so --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- that's, um, ah, I -- I remember, he he was always very family oriented --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- he took care of his mother and he took care of my mother which was, you know, his wife --
R:  Right.  
L:   -- and, um, I sometimes wonder if, um, you know -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I sometimes worry that, um, you know, when it's my turn for somebody to take care of me, you know, there'll be no one there.  Um, I -- I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- family, um, is somebody that, when -- when you go into an emergency room --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you have somebody to say, ah, my next of kin is so and so -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, and, um, what w- we're doing in -- in our synagogue, is, um, let's say you're -- a lot of people are living alone, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, what they're doing is forming a support group something like what you said.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that, ah, they call each other every day to make sure, ah, --
R:  Thank you.
L:  -- they're okay.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, so I think that's a good idea, and, um, we used to have it at our, in our apartment called "I'm okay, you're okay", but for some reason, it -- it never was continued.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Ah, do you have a very large support group?
R:  I guess. [LAUGH] I, --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- um, [NOISE] well, first of all, my immediate family. I have, um, four brothers and, um, [NOISE] one of my brothers is married and he has two children. 
L:  Mhm?
R:   And, um, he and his wi- -- he and his wife are very supportive and, um, for my oldest daughter's father's not in her life, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, she's adopted by my husband, and then I have, I have her and three other children, and my --
L:  Oh, you do have, oh -- 
R:  -- husband's family --
L:  -- that's wonderful!
R:  Yep.  And, um, the friends that my husband and I have that I consider family, it's because he and I have grown up with them -- 
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- and, ah, we didn't grow up together, but, like, my friends are the friends that I have kept from when I was six years old and moved into the Dallas area.  And, um, --
L:  Is that where you're from?  Are you talking from Dallas now?
R:  I'm from Dallas County, I'm in the city of Garland.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  Where are you calling from?
L:  I- I'm calling from Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, wow! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I didn't, I didn't know they had this long distance.  This is interesting.
R:  This is interesting, it's [NOISE] to think you should  get [inaudible] from all over.
L:  Yeah, that sounds great.
R:  And I'm -- I don't know if it has anything to do with, um, a social aspect or not on your view of what family -- 'cause I hear that -- a lot about, you know, like, some people do feel the same way that you do, that family is, like, your blood connections. --
L:  Maybe, maybe, --
R:  Or your next of kin.
L:  -- you mean from the east.
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Do you mean from the east, a lot of people think like I do?
R:  Wel- -- I'm, um, like --
L:  'Cause they think it's so conservative, yeah. 
R:  -- more northern.
L:  Conservative, yeah.
R:  Yeah, more, more that it's not as, um, it is a more conservative view that you're more close knit, you're not sharing, not that you're not capable of caring or sharing -- [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just that you have a different idea [NOISE] of what's supposed to be personal.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah  --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and I think also, um, cities where people move to ah, probably have the greater, um, ah, they consider their friends as part of their family.
R:  Right.
L:  Because a lot of people from the west originally was from the east and their families are back in the east --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, everybody else is in the same situation as they are.
R:  That, that does make sense.
L:  Yeah.  But -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- ah, you know, that -- a- and then I think the weather has something to do with it, too, because in southern climates, where it's warm, you're outside all the time.
R:  Right.
L:  So you're, you know, you meet your friends, for gardening, you know, you meet your friends, ah, let's go out and do this and do that, um, where, I guess, i- i- in the east you have your, like, wh- where I'm born, it's the sa- -- I live in the same city that both my grandparents lived in.
R:  Yeah.  There is not as much migrating [LAUGH].
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  It's more old town, it's your home town since, um, [MN] I have, one's -- one of my friends has lived here since she was born --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- and the others have moved in since, you know, they were still small children, but so, their families moved here, they weren't -- their ancestry isn't here.
L:  Yeah, oh, I see, now, I'm from the state Pennsylvania --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- which has the oldest population in the country other than Florida.  So there's a second, ah, state that has, ah, the oldest population and, um, this isn't because people retire here, this is because people tend to stay here, you know, in the same area where they were born and their parents were born, and, ah, there's a certain part of south Philadelphia where you have generations living in the same neighbourhood.
R:  Right.  That's -- that's kind of like where my grandmother lives [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.  Where --
R:  See, where I come --
L:  Where's that?
R:  Um, she lives in Parsons, Kansas.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Which is a very small city --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, it's one of those places that's you're born there, you very rarely move out [LAUGH].
L:  Right, right.  And, and --
R:  And [MN] --  
L:  -- that's something that Philadelphia is like, now.  I mean, you have your Irish section, your Polish section, section, your Italian section, where people have lived there for generations.  So --
R:  Ah? 
L:  -- you know, it's quite different than in a, in a state that receives a lot of immigrants.  So you, you have a, a big family?  That is wonderful.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  And that's wonderful, that your husband, um, decided to adopt your -- the child of your first marriage.
R:  Ah -- he, um, well, ah, her biological father doesn't really want to have anything to do with her, and my husband felt that that was just -- that she needed somebody and he was going to be the one to make the decisions and everything, so, why not, it be legal?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And he wanted her to feel that she was his.
L:  Oh, that, that's, that's great. How, how --
R:  And, um, and after --  
L:  -- how old are your other kids?
R:  [NOISE] I'm sorry?
L:  How, how old are your children?
R:  Um, she's sixteen, then I have a ten year old -- 
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- I have a nine year old and a four year old.
L:  Oh, okay, it's well spread out.
R:  Yes [NOISE].
L:  Does the older child help you with the younger?
R:  She does, um, she gets into her own stuff, and then [LAUGH] not wanting to help much with anything [MN] [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but, um, the one thing that she is mostly consistent with is the other children.
L:  Mhm -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- oh, well, that, that's great.
R:  And [MN] --
L:  Where, where, where did your husband come from?
R:  [MN]
