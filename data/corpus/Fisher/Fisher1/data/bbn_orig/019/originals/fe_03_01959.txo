R:  After the tone.  Corporate conduct in the USA and scandals.  And whether it hurts economy.  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Oh, hi, my name's Lori.
L:  My name's Mary.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well I guess we're supposed to be talking about the -- I didn't hear part of it, the corporate conduct, or something?
L:  I could hardly tell what she was saying either. [LAUGH]
R:  About the scandals --
L:  Corporate --
R:  -- well, I heard about -- the part about scandals in the USA, whether it hurts our economy.
L:  Yeah.  That's not exactly my favorite topic. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Do you know anything about it?
R:  Well, I guess they're maybe talking about like Enron, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, like, ah, oh, what's the other company that -- Worldcom.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, I have a friend that works for Worldcom, and -- and EDS too, like two of my friends that work for Worldcom, like just their day to day daily jobs, you know, they're afraid they're not going to have one the next day.  So.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I think that just hurts economy, it hurts like their moral sort of selves.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's terrible.  I mean, it, it does hurt the economy and the stock market, and -- but as far as what you do to change it, I have no idea, you know.  More laws.
R:  Yeah, and -- and --
L:  Passing more laws, or you know, I don't know.
R:  I, I think it does hurt, like, the economy just as a whole, because, you know, it's like, right now we're at the lowest unemployment rate, and people are going to be looking at America saying, well, looking at what they're doing now, the lowest unemployment rate, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, still I think, you know.  I guess I'm trying to find the words.  It's like, we'll, we'll bounce back, you know what we're saying --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause, like, we've been through this stuff before.
L:  Sure, yeah.
R:  The depression, and you know, stuff like that, so we'll bounce back, so does it, like, hurt the economy?  It's like, yeah, I think it does, but just temporarily.
L:  I think it does too, but, ah, I don't know, you know, as far as changing it, I suppose they need to pass more laws and, and make people more accountable, really.  It's mostly accounting fraud.
R:  There you go, there's the key word: accountability.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, like, I remember I saw, like, an Enron, um, like the -- when they were filming some of the talks about that, and one lady said, you know, well I sent memos to this a long time ago --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, you know, I've indicated this before, and like they called him a whistle blower, I kinda called him a hero because other people in the company knew about that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but they didn't step up and say something.  So yeah, that kinda hurts the economy and the -- just Enron as a whole.  It's like, you can't tell me that only one person, that lady who whistle blewed knew about it.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  So it kinda looks like maybe we're not doing honest business or something.
L:  Yeah, that's really true.  That's very true.
R:  'Cause, I, I remember, ah, I saw -- and they actually had this on Jay Leno that they were talking about the Enron, and one guy in the background was sitting there like rolling his eyes every time the chief executive was, like, saying something, and he was like rolling his eyes, like, oh come on, give me a break, like you didn't know what was going on.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then it's funny, then that guy was the one that got indicted too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I'm like that kinda makes it look even worse, you know just the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just the different stuff --
L:  Yeah.  And then they were giving themselves bonuses, and you know, taking all the money and, and running basically.  It's stupid.
R:  Yeah.  What was the deal with the American Airlines?  I think they guy stepped down because -- is that because of the economy, like he was embarrassed that he didn't admit to the bonuses or something?
L:  I don't know.  I -- they're asking, you know, regular people to take cutbacks, like stewardesses and all that, so -- yeah, then they were giving themselves bonuses.  That's stupid.  I mean, it doesn't make any sense.  
R:  I wonder if that's why he resigned then, 'cause that would be like a perfect example of, like, you know, how, how it makes us look bad.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like this guy's on TV, I'm trying to help everybody and I'm trying, you know, to help American Airlines get back together, and you know it's good for the company, it's called American Airlines, that's one thing right there, America --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but then it's like, if he stepped down for that --
L:  They should probably just have outside accounting agencies, you know, handling major things and, and reviewing people's books to see what's going on.
R:  I, I think they did with Enron, and who was that -- or something, and then that, that company didn't get good reputation either.
L:  No, they -- they're horrible.  I mean, a lot of people lost money on that.
R:  And I know, they said like, all the people -- this was bad for the economy, it's like, yeah, it's bad for the Enron when they're saying a lot of people lost, um, their life savings, their nest egg.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So yeah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's definitely bad for the economy.  I mean, it's like these people trusted the company and the trusted the economy's gonna do good.  I don't think it's really part of the, you know, the government's fault.  The government didn't tell the people, hey, lie about your accounting practices.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, they might have had some kind of role in it, like maybe they wanted more taxes and stuff, but -- and then they were just talking about George Bush, like if he asked for another tax cut to help the economy that really might just hurt the economy --
L:  Yeah, I think it will.
R:  -- I didn't -- did you read up on that?  Or someone saying, like, George Bush is saying that, you know, 'cause he wants the taxpayers to think, okay, I'm getting help from the government 'cause they're cutting this tax or that tax --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- and then it's, it's --
L:  He's just trying to, you know, win the next election by making himself look good --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- behind the tax cut, it'll do a little stimulation of the economy, and then he'll look okay.  Otherwise people are just going to say, God, you know, I don't even have a job, whatever, I don't want to vote for him.  So that's mostly politically motivated, I think.
R:  Yeah, it -- I don't know, like, if he's personally saying like he's doing anything to help Enron, or -- it's like, if he is, do you know about it?  Is it, like out --
L:  I have no -- no idea.
R:  -- yeah, that's -- if he is helping, it's like, what is he helping, or it's just like, do we just not read enough news about it, or is he just not, you know, doing enough marketing to show what he's helping with.
L:  I don't know.  I watch a lot of news, but I never see anything about that.  You know, it's just covering it up, they're just kind of forgetting about it.  So I don't really know what he's proposing.  There must be something, though.  You can't let it go on like this, you know, with people -- it's just one company after another coming forward and saying, oh yeah, we really weren't making [LAUGH] money, we were losing money, and, you know, that doesn't work.
R:  And, and it's amazing how some of them say, like, they hid like millions of dollars through this, and it's like that's kind of scary that that company -- like, God, millions of dollars, that seems like it's hard enough on its own --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but we hear like one company, and like, you know, EDS, and then like another big one comes out, and then -- I'm kinda waiting for like, well, who's the next big one coming out.
L:  I know.  And that's a terrible way to live, because [LAUGH] you know, how can you then invest in stocks when you think that it could be your stock next coming forward and saying, you know, it's not worth anything, because people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- once they, they say they've done fraud and all of that, nobody wants to buy the stock, it just sinks down, and then you're left with nothing.
R:  Now, did that K-Mart close because of accounting errors, or --
L:  No, I think they just closed because of bad management, you know --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH] -- people not shopping there, there's Target and Wal-Mart, nobody cares about K-Mart that much, you know.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause I was wondering if that had, like, anything to do with, like, corporate politics and stuff.  Like the one -- I think it was Enron, wasn't that the guy who had like three houses or something?
L:  Sure, yeah.  He, he did.
R:  So that's his personal benefit.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I don't think K-Mart's like that.  They seem to be just struggling, you know, due to basic factors like people not going there.  I know that's how it is by the one near us.  Nobody shops there, and even if you --
R:  I don't even know if there's any down here anymore.
L:  I -- they closed the one by us, and I don't know, I'm not sorry. [LAUGH] Because I went there I couldn't find what I wanted anyway, you know.  It's like, simple things they didn't have, so I'd end up going somewhere else, and --
R:  Yeah.  And all those people are out of a job too, so.
L:  Yeah.  There's a lot of people losing jobs there.
R:  I mean --
L:  That's terrible, the economy.  I mean, it's really -- I think it really is bad now.
R:  I, I think how they put it in the press, like Worldcom's having problems, and EDS is having problems and so on and so forth, it would be nice to continue the press coverage about how they're doing now.  Like my friend that works for Worldcom, they said they're coming out of bankruptcy, but I haven't seen that in the press.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They just tell their employees that.
L:  I haven't seen anything about Worldcom, but I did see that K-Mart emerged successfully from bankruptcy.
R:  Oh, that's good, okay.
L:  So the stores that are now open, they should be able to keep them open.  I, I don't know, I hope they do.
R:  Well that's good for the economy, and that's kind of like a good example.  I mean, whether it was corporate or not, just you know, that they can come out of it.  'Cause that's a big company.
L:  Mhm, it is.
R:  So I mean -- and it's kind of sad for like the people who are hard -- are hard workers at those company, 'cause it's like, once they look for another job, it's like, oh, you worked for Enron, oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.  I didn't even think about that.  That's not their fault, you know.
R:  I mean my friend -- yeah, she got out of there just in time. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, it was like I think a year before that happened, but still just on her resume.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  People might think, well did you leave the company, did you jump ship, or you know.  Heaven forbid, like what if somebody quit when they were part of that.  I mean, that's bad on the economy, not just for Enron, but for the person -- the employees.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, if they don't have a job, that's definitely bad on the unemployment rate.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause I mean, I know some friends that they would say they would look for a job and then they got like an email back, well five hundred people applied for this job, or a thousand people applied for this, and I thought they were joking.  So I was like, dang, I did not know the economy was that bad.
L:  Yeah.  I've heard that lately too.  Over a thousand people for one job.  You know, how do you even have a chance?
R:  Yeah.  I mean, how do they even read it?  It's just --
L:  Even if you're perfect I don't think [LAUGH] you could get that job, you know.  It just seems -- it's not fair.  I don't know.  I've got friends who have lost their jobs and their having a really hard time.
R:  Isn't it amazing, I was like, a couple of years ago we didn't know that many people that, that lost, um, the job, and now it's like you can probably name like four or five or something -- 
L:  Uh-huh.  It used to be -- 
R:  -- out of your friends.
L:  -- there were signs everywhere, help wanted.  You know, it's like, oh, you could have a job in a minute if you wanted one.  And now it's a whole different story.
R:  Yeah, they had that, ah, the job on -- ah, the thing about the news about that, how they used to have all these help wanted signs, and the story was you don't see them anymore.
L:  No.  I haven't seen one -- I can't remember seeing one, you know.  It's -- noone has them advertised.
R:  I -- I think it's amazing, like I saw monster board dot com being advertised on TV
