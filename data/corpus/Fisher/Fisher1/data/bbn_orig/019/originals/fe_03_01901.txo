L:  Susan.
R:  Cheryl.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  I guess we just start talking.
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.
R:  So what does family mean to you?
L:  Um, well, I -- I come from a pretty big family I guess, so -- 
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  Well, I mean not immediate family but I come from, like, a family where, like, extended family is just as close as immediate family basically.
R:  Cool.
L:  Yeah.  So -- 
R:  Well, like, um, what kind of things do you do with your family or, um, --
L:  Um, well, ah, I don't know.  We don't really have, like, yearly events or whatever but, you know, just, like, um, where, like, we all kind of live close to each other so we'll see each other, like, you know, once a week at my grandmother's house or whatever, and, um, yeah, I'm, like, pretty close to my cousins.  I have a lot of cousins.  I have, like, [NOISE] thirty cousins [LAUGH] or something like that so -- 
R:  So do you -- do you play games with the family or do you, um, --
L:  Um, well, when we were -- I mean, when I -- when I was younger, you know, like, with my cousins, we definitely play a lot of games.  I -- I think now we just kind of, like, sit around and talk about, you know, stuff. [LAUGH] You know, I don't -- I don't really -- 
R:  Right.
L:  I don't really know what we do now, [LAUGH] just, yeah.
R:  That's kinda -- we -- we all play games and we love to get together and, um, have big, like, um, you know, buffet dinners and that kind of thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, um, let -- let the kids play and just have, um, --  to me it's more like, you know, time together and hanging out and, um, being, oh, um, we like to -- we like to go, like, get pictures made together and that's a big deal to us.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, having -- 
L:  See, we've never done that, but, um, I think the last time we had like a big family picture together was when I was, like, one 'cause -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I, it -- you know, I'm in the picture in my mom's arms and that's, you know, I think that's the last time that we did that, so, um, ...
R:  So probably just, like, um, just being together and, um, having, you know, I think just being able to, um, 'cause, I like, I have a sister that lives kind of far away, but, um, we still stay connected, you know, calling each other and -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah, same here.  I mean, actually in terms of -- 
R:  -- and, um, just kind of keeping up with family stuff.
L:  Oh, sorry to cut you off. [LAUGH]
R:  No, that's okay.  Go ahead.
L:  Um, yeah, and, I mean, in terms of my immediate family, I have an older sister and a younger brother, and my sister and I are really close.  I mean, I'm -- I'm close to my brother also -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, you know, my sister and I are just, you know, we talk to each other about everything and, mm, when she was away at college, um, you know, she was far away and we'd -- we would keep in touch and -- 
R:  Just like the connection thing, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think that's a lot of it is just -- because I think even, um, family can extend out of, you know, can extend like you said, you can have extended family or extended whatever, as long as you have the connection of, you know, the things you have in common and, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The love for things and that sort of thing.
L:  Yeah, exactly, mhm, exactly, and I -- I think also, um, I don't know if you would agree, but kind of going on that definition, that there are certain friends that after a while, you know, basically become like family, yeah. 
R:  Basically family, yes, exactly.
L:  And, you know, you can even be closer to them.  I mean, I have a few friends that I've been friends with since my junior high days that -- 
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I think we're -- are closer to me than some of my cousins, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  Even though I still love my cousins dearly and, like, you know.
R:  Exactly, but you have -- 
L:  They're blood but -- 
R:  -- more of a connection with -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Them or more of a commonness than, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Not that -- not that you don't with your family, but I know it's kind of the same, um, I kind of have it too -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with some -- some friends, and I mean, I'm very close to, um, family and that sort of thing, and, um, you know, they have cousins and -- we have lots of cousins and that kind of thing but, um, -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think a lot of it is just having, you know, it -- it is the time spent or the time that you spend at it -- 
L:  Right, exactly, yeah, that's true.
R:  -- you know, what you -- what you build or whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- 
L:  And I think you start to also just realize more what that means as you grow older.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think when I was younger I was definitely like, "Oh, I don't need my family, you know". 
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  "When I'm independent", that's it, you don't -- I'm not dealing with them.
R:  And I think as you get older you do realize that you need that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know you need that too.
L:  Yeah, and even --
R:  And you appreciate it.
L:  Yeah, definitely, definitely.
R:  So that's kind of a, um, being able to -- I don't know, that's my big thing, is I -- I love being able to get together and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, just hang out and chat and, you know, see how they're doing and that kind of thing, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just calling and checking up on each other and, I mean, that's, um, -- that's a lot of it, but like you said, you can do that even with friends and, you know, extended -- extended family so -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  And, I mean, I definitely -- in terms of extended family, like, I have some cousins that I'm much closer to than others and, you know, so who I want to kind of keep in touch with more.  Like, recently one of my really close cousins has, like, um, got engaged and that was just, you know, for -- 
R:  Oh, that's neat.
L:  You know, it was like, "Oh, yay", -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, whereas with another cousin like I might have just gone like, "Oh, that's -- that's great", you know but -- 
R:  Yeah, yeah, somebody you could be happy with and -- 
L:  But -- but, yeah.
R:  I -- I think a lot of it too, you know, I mean, 'cause you go through so much together, it's like, you know, happy, sad, you know, whatever types of occasions, basically you're, you know, -- that's if who you are involved with is, you know, they're family, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you have good times and bad times and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, so that's a -- I think it's just a lot of building -- building blocks, you know. 
L:  Yeah, definitely.  I don't know, but what -- what do you think of -- I mean, would you go to, like, any extent for your family?  I know I have, like, for me I have some family that, um, they said, like, "Oh, no matter what, we're family and I'll do anything for you and go to any extent". 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I kinda think that's a little overboard.  I mean, you know, it depends on the situation I would -- 
R:  Yeah, yeah, [LAUGH] I think -- I think I'm that because the majority of the time, yes.  I mean, if it's not -- I mean, if it wouldn't obviously, you know, get me thrown in jail or something. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  You know what I mean? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Mhm. But, yeah, I mean, um, for the most part, you know, because I think you do have that -- that connection or closeness or whatever there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, but, ah, so do you all like do -- does -- does your family, like, do holidays and stuff, you know, get together once -- once a week or -- 
L:  Um, um, well, yeah.
R:  Once a month? 
L:  We tend to, we tend to get together once a week.  Actually, I thought of something else that, like, we all love to do together.  We all, you know, watch movies together.  We're a big movie family, you know. 
R:  That's cool.
L:  Um, when we were younger we used to go out to the movie theatre.  Now, we're just kind of, like, oh, go down the street and rent a video.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  Pop it in and, yeah.  And then we usually will do that, um, like, at my grandmother's house, you know, because she's kind of the matriarch, you know, um.
R:  That's neat though.
L:  Yeah, so and, yeah, so -- and tends to be like all my -- yeah, all the family kind of gets together, like, once a week. I mean, it's not always once a week, we try to do it, like, once a week -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but not necessarily.
R:  Try to.
L:  You know, so -- 
R:  Yeah, we like to have family game nights and play -- get together and play games and -- 
L:  Mhm, oh.
R:  -- and, um, like, everybody makes something and brings and, you know, get together and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and just hang out and, um, I don't know, I guess, you know -- 
L:  Yeah, that soun- sounds like fun.
R:  Just connections. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Make it -- just trying to make connections with everybody.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I think everybody kind of gets busy sometimes and when you're a member of that, you know, you need to be -- you need to -- you need to stay with your family -- or at least to be able to get with your family and hang out and that kind of thing because, um, you know, you're not -- you don't know when something might happen to one of 'em so -- 
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  -- and that's kind of a big deal in our family, so -- 
L:  No, I think it's the -- it's the same for our -- for my family I think.  Um, like, my -- my grandfather, um, died about four years ago now and, um, like, all the daughters, like, my mom -- it's my mom's father, so my mom and her sister, they were all really close to him and I think after that, they kind of all -- that's kind of one.  I mean, they would still visit him fairly frequently but I think after that, one, because they wanted to take, you know, take care of my grandmother.
R:  Right.
L:  And, two, because they kind of -- kind of brought them back and -- 
R:  Kind of brings, yeah. 
L:  -- made them realize, you know, -- 
R:  Yeah, the realization that -- 
L:  Yeah, so -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think it's kinda -- it's kinda sad in a way ev- even though I see what you mean -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it's kind of sad in a way when something like that brings you back to -- even though I think it's a good thing, you know what I mean? 
L:  Yeah, yeah, I know.  I totally agree and -- 
R:  But, sometimes I think it takes something to get, you know, to kind of wake you up, and, ah, no, it's the same in our family. 
L:  Yeah, no, no.
R:  Kinda wake you up and spend time together and, you know.
L:  Yeah, no, it's -- it's definitely kind of like a contradiction because, I mean, it's not that before that, you know, we weren't tight knit -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and we didn't see each other, it was just kind of like, not as intense and now it's like, "Oh". 
R:  Probably more haphazard than --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then I -- I -- well, I know it's like that in our family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, there's been times where, you know, you just -- I think you get to where you take it for granted sometimes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then when something happens, sometimes you realize, oh, my goodness.
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  You know, this is, you know, this isn't always going to be like this, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's a ever changing -- I don't know about your life, but, you know, our family life is a ever changing thing so -- 
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely with ours, yeah.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And just like I said with so many, um, people in the extended family -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- it's always like someone's growing up, someone just had a baby, someone, you know --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- is going off to college and -- 
R:  College and marriage and -- 
L:  -- we won't see them again.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, yeah, yeah, so -- 
R:  I know it's just -- it's so amazing.
L:  Mhm, yeah. 
R:  Just to watch the family, you know, the whole way things change and, um, that's -- that really is -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Truly amazing.
L:  Yeah.  It is pretty -- it's pretty amazing and, I mean, there are definitely times where, you know, --
