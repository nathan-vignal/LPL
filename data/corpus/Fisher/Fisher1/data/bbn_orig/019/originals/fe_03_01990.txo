L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Melanie.
R:  Hi, I'm Marion.
L:  Hi, Marion.
R:  I really don't know anything about corporate scandals, it hasn't affected me.
L:  Well it hasn't affected me either, I mean, not directly, I suppose, you know, you've got the, uh, the Enron thing, I suppose, is the first thing that comes to mind when I think about the corporate scandals and, you know, I know a lot of people were affected by that, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I guess, ah, the most recent one, -- I live in Saint Louis, I don't know where you are --
R:  I live in Massachusetts.
L:  -- In Massachusetts? -- ah, you know, there's kind of a deal going on right now with, um, American Airlines and -- and how they set aside, you know, the special pension fund for, ah, their executives and so all of the labor unions and everything are up in arms about that -- I gue- -- to me, that kind of qualifies as another one of those corporate scandal sort of things, --
R:  Mhm.  And --
L:  -- I don't know, but, it -- [MN]
R:  I -- I didn't watch the news today, my son had a hockey game but I heard -- my mother was telling me something about some CEO from some company, she wasn't sure -- well, she didn't tell me, um, both of them had to resign --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they're going to get some charges against them, --
L:  Yeah, yeah, I think that might be American Airlines, I don't know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- about charges against them, there may be something else going on, it seems like, once a week, there's something going on.  You know, MCI had a big deal where they were, ah, fabricating numbers, and making everything look good, and it got to a point where they couldn't make up numbers any more, and got caught at it.
R:  See, now, I thought that these companies have independent, um, accountants that have to go in and check their books.
L:  Well, you know and, I guess, that is the theory, but I know that when I worked, ah, I -- there was a company that I worked for, and they had a, you know, supposed independent auditing company, but, you know, realistically, that company -- the auditor -- is paid by that company, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, you don'- -- they don't want to be the person to say, "Oh, you can't do that", or, you know?  That's where they're making their money, so they're going to do whatever to make their client happy, it seems like, in a lot of cases, anyway; you know, if the auditors were somehow, [MN], I guess I hate to say, gosh, more Government regulation, but you've don't want a situation where you've got CEO's, -- and the company is losing money, hand over fist and, the CEO's and the Board of Directors and everybody, they're -- they're giving themselves these million dollar bonuses, something just doesn't seem right with that, you know.
R:  I know, but you see the same thing in, ah, Government, --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- where, you know, they just voted themselves a raise and upped our taxes.
L:  Well, you know, and, and -- my husband and I were talking about that the other day, that the days of having to have someone represent us in Government -- I think that that is quickly coming to an end as well, that, you know, with telephones, and computers and, all the communications that we have that weren't around two hundred years ago, you know, why should I have someone go to Washington to supposedly represent my interests, when in reality, he's representing the interests of whoever gave him the money to get into office with to begin with.
R:  True. [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, that if they were taking -- put a vote, okay, you know, all three hundred million Americans, "Here's what we're talking about today, do we want to send fourteen billion dollars to Turkey so we can fly over?  No!" [LAUGH] You know, let's all vote no!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, where, I guess, Congressmen and Senators have, kind of, different interests, I think if you take it back to the people that the money really belongs to, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, what -- what you're saying, that the Government wastes, yeah, you know, i- it -- it probably doesn't seem like such a bad thing t- to these businesses to do that, because they look at it and that's the way our Government's run, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, you know, why not, but, you know, our Government has this bad habit of spending money like it's theirs, or something.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Is isn't?
L:  Ah, y- -- I -- I don't know, I think it's your paycheck and my paycheck, --
R:  I know, --
L:  -- you know, where they get the money from, but -- but there's just this bizarre theory that they think they can spend whatever, like, they've got just an open checkbook. [inaudible]
R:  Just like, I read something about, um, during some meeting they slipped in, some, you know, other, um, allocation of some money, and it was, like, to go fix some statue in -- down South, or something, --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and people just didn't realise what they were voting for.
L:  Well, they do that all the time, what is that called?  Pork -- pork barrel --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- stuff.  And you know what it is, is that, you know, Fred, the Senator, is try to get his bill through, and so his buddy Bob says, "Okay, you know, I'll vote for you, and the three other guys from South Carolina will vote for you if you'll just add this one little thing here", and so, you know, that's how they end up getting the big bill passed, is by adding all the little junk to it, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's just crazy.  I'm just trying to think there was another one, oh, I don't recall, the MCI, the American Airlines thing, oh, I know what I was thinking, here -- here sits, American Airlines, you know, threatening bankruptcy about once a week, now, you know, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, well, if the unions don't take a thirty percent cut in pay, and, you know, they've got to lay off, like, ten thousand people, and got to do all this stuff, and so, they're wanting another Federal bailout, --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and I'm, like, I'm like, "No!" -- it -- it's -- it's kind of like, I heard somebody refer to it as corporate welfare, --
R:  Ah, mhm.
L:  -- you know, and -- and it's, like, okay, we've -- we've pretty well figured out over the course of time, that welfare doesn't actually help anybody help themselves, that it just kind of creates a class of dependency, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I think you know, like, with these airlines, they're kind of in that situation, like, well, if we run our business really poorly, and American Airlines had a one billion dollar loss for a quarter, -- I mean, that's incredible, --
R:  I know --
L:  -- I can't even imagine spending that much money, running an airline a- and so they're, like, back with their little hands out, going okay, we get more, right?  And they were trying to tack that onto the, uh, the War Appropriations Bill.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, it's -- it's of those deals, where, okay, let -- let one of them go under, and, and, you know, then the others will pick up the slack, there are certainly airlines running profitably in this country right now, I mean, it obviously can be done, --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- some of them aren't doing it very well -- so you're in Massachusetts, it's almost seven there, huh?
R:  Yes.
L:  Did you initiate the phone call, or did the, uh, thing call you?
R:  It called me.
L:  Oh, okay, when it has called me in the past, it's always been pretty much on the hour, so I was really surprised when, um, my son comes up and he goes, "Hey, mom, your cell phone's ringing", it's, like, "Oh, that's strange!"
R:  Right, I -- I didn't know I could go off topic, but I do have a question:  Are we supposed to leave comments or is that an optional thing?
L:  I -- this is only my second call, --
R:  Me too.
L:  -- um, I didn't, I didn't leave comments before, I get the impression they throw out a topic, this is just my theory, they throw out a topic so we will have something to talk about, instead of going, "Hi, I'm a stranger, you're a stranger, we don't know each other", --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, it -- this is some other of a linguistics study --
R:  Yes, that's what I read, to dev- -- developing software, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- voice recognition software.
L:  Yeah, so they take someone like you from the Northeast and someone like me with a bad Southern accent --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and they're, like, "Okay, what are the differences in the way these people talk", and I think that is of more interest to them than --
R:  What we're talking about?  Okay, [LAUGH]
L:  -- us sitting and discussing econ- -- yeah.  Discussing economics, you know?  I think as long as there's some rattling going on, they're pretty happy with us, so -- so you've done -- this is your second also?
R:  This is my second one.
L:  When did you get started on it?
R:  Um, just this week.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- uh, um, the first two calls I missed, I wasn't home, this is, ah, school vacation for us, --
L:  Oh.  -- 
R:  -- for us, and my -- my son had a hockey game.
L:  Oh, I was really surprised, I, ah,  signed up for it one morning, and I indicated that I would be available for it at two, three, four, five in the afternoon, and, I mean, two hours later my phone was ringing, --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and I-I didn't realise it was going to be that quick, so I missed that call, and then, um, I think I missed one yesterday as well, I was out of my car for just a few seconds, my son had baseball practice, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so I was out of the car for those few moments and missed the call and, I thought, oh, they're -- they're surely going to dump me, --
R:  That's what I thought when I missed the first two.
L:  Do you, ah, do you, like, work regular work?
R:  No.
L:  What do you do normally?
R:  I'm -- independent contractor.
L:  Do you do mystery shopping and stuff?
R:  Yes, I do.
L:  Yeah, I think that's where a bunch of us got onto this thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Did you, ah, get it, like, the Cheryl Durban post, or?
R:  Ah, I don't know, I mean, it's everywhere.
L:  Oh, was it really?
R:  Oh, it was everywhere, you know, --
L:  Oh, --
R:  -- people didn't believe the legitim- -- ah, I can't even talk -- they're going to get, like, that one, you know, if it was, like, legitimate or not.
L:  Yeah, I, ah, you know, I signed up for it, and I thought, "Gosh, you know, how bad can it be", and you look at it, and it's actually a dot E.D.U. -- it's, I mean, it's a legitimate email address, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I went through and kind of did a-a search engine search on some of the Fisher Project, and stuff, and it -- it seems to be legitimate, so I wasn't that worried about it, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I thought, "Oh, what's the worst thing, I talk on the phone for ten minutes, --
R:  I know, that's how I felt.  
L:  -- to a couple of strangers?"  [LAUGH]
R:  They're paying me, that's great -- I mean, I hope they do, but [LAUGH] i- it wasn't a big waste of time.
L:  Yeah, yeah, exactly and they said that you could get, gosh, I guess, up to twenty or something calls, did you see that, that you could actually --
R:  I saw that.  And then I saw someone say, but they only pay you for three.  I -- I don't know --
L:  Oh, is that right?
R:  -- I don't know if -- what's right.  Uh, that
