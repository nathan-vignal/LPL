R:  Hi I'm Carolyn.
L:  [NOISE] Hi, this is Dianne.
R:  Hi Dianne, how are you?
L:  Fine, how are you? [LAUGH] 
R:  Fine.  I didn't know ahead of time what the -- the topic was going to be, did you? 
L:  Neither did I, no.
R:  [LAUGH] It's kinda -- 
L:  Luckily -- 
R:  -- interesting.
L:  -- so luckily enough it's not too difficult I guess. 
R:  Yes [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Family's pretty easy.  The first time I did it was about, um, um, something very political [LAUGH]. 
L:  Oh, was it?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Which didn't interest me at all I'm not in politics.
L:  [MN] 
R:  But family I can do.
L:  How are you going to stretch --
R:  Do you come from a big family? 
L:  Um, actually well, if four is big then, yeah, I have four -- a family of -- well, actually six if we include --  
R:  Six kids, or.
L:  No, mum and dad too [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, okay [LAUGH].
L:  But, yeah -- go ahead, I'm sorry.
R:  My mum's family was large, so I was used to having a large family around but I only have one brother, so.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Let's see --
R:  -- well, my poor daughter she doesn't have any brothers and sisters, so it's just dwindling away.
L:  Oh, no.  I know, doesn't it seem like that more and more nowadays that, um, that a lot of people are having one or two children? 
R:  Yeah, yeah -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- it wasn't on purpose, but it did happen that way, but, yeah, she has a lot of friends that have multiple brothers and sisters, so, yeah.
L:  That helps [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  What does family mean to you?
R:  Pardon me? 
L:  I asked the question what does family mean to you?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  Um, what does it mean?
R:  I suppose -- let's see, if you look at it in an academic sense, well, family obviously is going to start out with your immediate family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But for me what family is --  
L:  [NOISE]  
R:  -- is anybody in the blood line --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- or married into the blood line [LAUGH].
L:  Good answer [LAUGH]. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Good answer.
R:  Then of course there's your good friends, they're kinda like family right? 
L:  Yeah, they almost become family after a while [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm -- I'm twenty eight so I, you know, I have friends from high school and stuff like that but I've I have other family like my aunt or my husband's aunt, she has friends that she's known for like twenty five years and, you know, thirty years and I'm thinking at -- at some point it just starts to become family [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I've got one girlfriend -- now I'm -- I'm a lot older than you, I could be your mom [LAUGH] --  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- my daughter's twenty three --  
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.   
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] but I've got one girlfriend --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that -- gosh, we met in fifth grade --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- so, that's a long time ago. [LAUGH]   
L:  Ah, that is a very long time. [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] and another girlfriend that we were in high school together --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and, ah, we kinda lost each other for like ten years --  
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- and because of the class reunion --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we managed to link back up and kinda just picked up right where we left of, it was --  
L:  Really? 
R:  -- pretty amazing, yeah.
L:  Was that the ten year or the twenty year? 
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  You not at twenty yet, are you? 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah?
R:  So, ... 
L:  Well, that's nice -- 
R:  [NOISE] But -- 
L:  I have a friend like that to.  I've -- I've known her since seventh grade, but, you know, we kinda keep touch -- 
R:  You know, -- 
L:  -- [inaudible] 
R:  -- people kinda go in and out of your life -- 
L:  Yeah --  
R:  And --  
L:  -- I notice that.
R:  -- it's -- it's kinda interesting to watch.  The girl that I knew since fifth grade, um, --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- she married a guy that was in the military and moved all over the country --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, one of the few that didn't go out of the country but it's like, okay, once a year almost always we find each other --  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- you know, and write Christmas cards and --  
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  -- I happen to go -- again, another class reunion [LAUGH] --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- found her again in person.  She didn't go but she was living in that town still and it's kinda like we picked up where we left off.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  That is nearly two years ago too, so.
L:  That's always good.
R:  Good friendships --  
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- are lasting, you know. 
L:  Yeah, no matter what -- 
R:  When and when they disappear, I always know there's something wrong. [LAUGH] 
L:  Really?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, like one -- one when she disappeared for ten years it was, um, a marriage problem --  
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and she dropped out of sight and the other one disappeared for a few years and -- and there was just a lot of stuff going on that it would have been good if I put more effort into finding her because she could have used an ear or a shoulder to cry on kinda thing.
L:  Oh, that's too bad.
R:  [LAUGH] That's a lesson for you.
L:  Well, [LAUGH] --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But you know -- I guess that's the big difference between family and friends.  Family you can't get rid of, friends maybe --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they just dwindle away.
R:  Pardon me? 
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I'm -- I'm just saying that family you can't get rid of --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- but friends, you know --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- but friends, [NOISE] you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  You don't get to choose your family.
L:  Right, exactly, so. [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] You're stuck with them.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But, you know -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the other thing a I've noticed about that even if it's somebody -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, a brother or sister or parent or something that you really don't like --  
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and I don't know there's that -- there's that family tie that brings you back and well, you know, if they really need you you're there, or --  
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- if you really need them, they're there.
L:  [NOISE] That's true --  
R:  I hope.
L:  -- that's true.  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I don't --  
L:  Knock on wood.   
R:  -- know if that's true with everybody, but my daughter had a friend who was a foster child --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and he was still in touch with his -- his parents --  
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and after he graduated from high school he was no longer eligible to do foster child so he was out in the world on his own --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and couple of years later my daughter comes back telling me that his mom had gotten in touch with him and she was always a real problem case with drugs and -- and alcohol and anyway she gotten really, really sick and ended up in hospital and didn't have any way to pay for it, he felt obligated to pay for her medical bills --  
L:  Oh, no. 
R:  -- so -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, here's a case of family in a worst possible situation and yet there's a -- a tie.
L:  Yeah, yeah, he felt obligated.
R:  Yeah.   
L:  Oh, my goodness, that's a sad story.
R:  Yeah, it really --  
L:  [LAUGH] My -- my husband's, um, mother or my mother in law she's, um, -- she was raised as a foster child and so she kinda has the same type of situation where she has family that she knew while she was in care but, you know, as soon as she was old enough, you know, they didn't step in to offer her anything it just kinda seems strange to me, but, you know, or, you know --  
R:  It's tough.
L:  -- it's just very different.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There is a lot of situations like that I understand.  I belong to a quilting group --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and a couple of times one of the members has gotten up and said, you know -- well, we do charity quilts all the time anyway -- 
L:  Oh.   
R:  -- and so, she was asking people to direct their quilts to this one organization and what they do is, as each foster child turns eighteen years old they get a quilt because often -- 
L:  Ahah. 
R:  -- often times that's about the only thing that they can call their own -- 
L:  Oh, yeah -- 
R:  -- and take with them -- 
L:  -- that's nice.  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- because they just get turned out --  
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- so ... 
L:  So, it's not much of a family structure and you almost wonder how -- how it affects them, you know, I know it does, but how does it -- 
R:  Oh, --
L:  -- change them --  
R:  -- yeah -- 
L:  -- or --  
R:  -- very.
L:  -- you know, how -- how does that affect their own family when they, you know, have one and in this situation she got married or my mother in law got married and then, you know, had my husband and then that was it, just one child --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they ended up getting a divorce but, so, you know, you wonder how -- how much that impacted her life and ability to keep her own family together, so.
R:  That's true --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, it kinda comes back to what does family mean to them? 
L:  Right, right, exactly, you know --  
R:  Right -- 
L:  -- and --  
R:  -- well, because fellow -- my daughter's friend I mean he had -- he was treated very, very badly as a small child --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- before he went into the foster care, so for him family in some cases means a lot of pain --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- and a lot of rejection and a lot of --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- problems, so -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know it would be interesting to watch if we can stay in touch with him.  I believe he went into the army recently.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  I don't know, you know, exactly where or if he ended up in the Mid East, or --  
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- anything, hopefully -- 
L:  Hopefully he's not [LAUGH] --  
R:  -- at some point somebody will get in touch with me again and say, "Okay here's where he's at now". 
L:  Oh, what -- what part of the US are you from? 
R:  Um, Seattle area.
L:  Oh, okay, you're from Washington.
R:  Yeah, where are you? 
L:  Ah, Southern California.
R:  Pardon me? 
L:  I'm sorry, Southern California.
R:  Southern Cal? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ooh, is the weather nice down there?
L:  It's [LAUGH] -- today it wa- you know, it's sort of cooling off this past week, we had rain -- 
R:  Oh.   
L:  -- like over the past couple of weeks, but not heavy duty just like --
R:  Enough to -- 
L:  -- showers.
R:  -- cool it off and green it up? 
L:  Yeah, yeah spring showers.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But other than that it's -- it's been hot, it's heating up, [LAUGH] so. 
R:  [LAUGH] I have a cousin in River Side.
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay, so you know all about what's going on over here.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I have family just about everywhere.  I have family in Europe. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, see, you're family, yes --  
R:  Yeah, but -- 
L:  -- are all spread out.
R:  -- the extended family I've recently done a little bit of study in the genealogy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And made contact with a distant -- very distant cousin in Germany.  Come to find out I was practically in his backyard only a couple of months before --  
L:  Oh, my goodness --
R:  -- I bumped --  
L:  -- isn't that strange.   
R:  -- into him on the internet.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So, you do come from a large family then. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, he's like, you know, nine generations removed. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  But I do have family in Sweden, my father came from Sweden.
L:  Oh, man.
R:  So, I have contemporaries --  
L:  So --
R:  -- over there.
L:  You said that you took a gen- you gotten a genealogy, did you take a class? 
R:  Yeah.  Pardon?
L:  Oh, w- -- I'm sorry, you said you gotten a genealogy, did you take a class, or? 
R:  No, no, I just got interested -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- um, I had an elderly aunt and, ah, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- one of her cousins who had kinda kept family history and I've always been interested in it, I was kinda the next in line, the next generation to be interested in it and I had some spare time so I started fooling around on the internet just typing in names and seeing what I could come up with --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and hooked up with, um, some other people from around the country that were in the same line -- 
L:  That's great --  
R:  -- different branches -- 
L:  -- that's great. 
R:  -- same time line kinda, and actually one person I bumped into had talked to this cousin who, um, passed away several years ago now and so he had shared some of his notes with the other -- 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- [LAUGH] so -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and then this guy from Germany just kinda found us.  There's, ah, a branch of a family I think in Canada --
