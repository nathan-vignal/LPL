L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Cheryl.
R:  Hi, this is Stacey.
L:  Well, hi, Stacey.  It's nice to meet you.
R:  It's nice to meet you.  Where are you at?
L:  I'm in Garland, Pennsylvania, and how about you? 
R:  I'm in Chatsworth, Georgia. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, this is my first call.
R:  Oh, really?  It's my second.
L:  So this is really new to me.
R:  [LAUGH] It's my second one so I'm giving it a shot.
L:  Okay.  Our subject of the day is what does family mean to you.
R:  Yes.  Family means everything to me. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, it does me too.  I really enjoy my family.  I have four children.  What about you? 
R:  I have two teenage girls who are nineteen months apart.  They -- been married twenty years this year. [LAUGH]
L:  I have two sons ages fourteen and fifteen and two daughters ages nine and ten and I was married for fourteen years and now I'm divorced.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I have a wonderful boyfriend.
R:  Oh, that's -- 
L:  Who has a nineteen year old daughter who's in the military.
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  So -- 
R:  Is she serving over there? 
L:  No, actually she's in Texas, thank God.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  Ah, we were nervous for a while, we hadn't heard from her.
R:  Yes.
L:  And, ah, it was really rough, you know, you know, she's family. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  That's the thing and -- but, you know, it -- it -- it's rough having somebody in the service.  I have a nephew who's in the military also. 
R:  Yeah, I do too.
L:  He is, ah, twenty nine and has three children of his own.
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  And he is going to Korea for a year without his family.
R:  Oh, not good at all.
L:  No, no, not at all, but -- 
R:  My daught- -- my two daughters one is fourteen, nearly fifteen November and I've got one that will be sixteen in -- on the twenty ninth of this month.  So -- 
L:  So.
R:  In the process of planning [inaudible] her party and -- introducing her to the dating world and all that stuff that I don't want to do. [LAUGH]
L:  I very much dread the day my daughters date.
R:  Oh, it's -- it's driving me crazy.  I keep telling her, "No, you're not sixteen, you're only three". [LAUGH] So --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So I refuse to let her go out.  [LAUGH] But they're pretty good kids so, but as far as family, I've been lucky I guess.  I got married two days after my seventeenth birthday only, like, I said, together twenty years this September.  I'm one of the lucky ones so it's not easy.  Doesn't come out that way when you get married young. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  I got married right out of high school, a month and five days after graduation and, ah, my marriage lasted fourteen years but it was on the rocks from day one.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, ah, it was hard but I was raised in the church and I have a strong belief and, um, my church did not support divorce and remarriage but I've got past that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I finally decided that, ah, I couldn't live with him and I divorced him and after four years I finally came to the conclusion that I did not think the Lord wanted me to spend the rest of my life alone.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How I ended up getting married was he had asked, I had accepted but told him he may have to wait 'til I finish college.  And, ah, my parents called my bluff.  I said, "If you don't let me cash my life insurance so I can use money to go to college, then I'm going to get married".  And they called my bluff and like an idiot I got married. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I just -- mine was just simple, you know, oh, yes, totally in love, have to get married type thing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But my parents told me -- well, he went -- he went to my parents and asked them which was unusual during the day but they told him if we were still together a year from that day, well, they would -- they would give, you know, give us their permission.  And so a year later on my birthday they took me down and signed the -- [LAUGH] sign the papers and said they didn't like it but it -- I mean, it's been hard, it ain't been easy and if we hadn't had God, I'm sure, you know, we would have been down that road several times especially earlier in our marriage but about, oh, I guess, about seven years ago on our anniversary, he said something, he said, "Well, I guess I'm taken now in the fine print after this many years you can't get rid of me now, you're struck with me" so -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- kind of thing so if I get -- if I get upset with him or something like that, he always throws that at me, and says, "Don't forget the fine print, you can't do that". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I said -- I told him I wouldn't want to train another one now, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like I just told him if I got rid of him, there wouldn't be no more.
L:  Well, you know, um, with mine, um, I ended up getting divorced, filing for divorce after, ah, -- he went for a pack of cigarettes and called me three months later from Texas.
R:  My goodness.
L:  And it wasn't the first time.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, ah, but I assured him it was going to be the last.  I had already sold his car because he didn't even take his car.  I already sold his car and filed for a divorce. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I literally, ah, -- even when I was married I was a single parent most of the time.
R:  Right.
L:  And I worked a full-time job and spent nine years trying to get my degree in accounting. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  And I still have not managed to get my associate's degree which is a two year college degree in accounting.  This one class at a time thing and doing homework with the kids, just isn't cutting it.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's -- I mean, you should be very proud of that though.
L:  My kids have just been wonderful through it all.  I mean, I cannot complain a bit about my kids.
R:  I'd say that's just -- that's just another star on you, what you've done for 'em, you know.  You raised 'em that way, so -- 
L:  Well, I mean, they have been great.  You know, they help me study as much as I help them study.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I do taxes and bookkeeping out of my own home, plus I have a job out.  I no longer work full time now.  Now I only work part time out of my home.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, ah, the way my kids hold up during the tax season is absolutely unbelievable.
R:  Yeah, I bet. 
L:  I mean, I know most adults wouldn't hold up that well.
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] that's true.  Well, my husband owns his own business and so you're, well, you know, going on for thirty year now, I started running his office and stuff here at the home and do all his accounting and stuff that I'm able to do here at the house and have a -- run his office from the home so I'm there with my girls for the last going on three years, this will be our third summer and I got to -- I used to work full time ever since we were married and went back to work, just a couple of weeks after each one of 'em was born and decided I wanted some time with 'em before they were going to college and everything and I'd missed part of their, you know, most of their growing up.
L:  I did too with my kids because I was working full time out of the house.
R:  Right.
L:  And then I got, um, injured at work and became disabled.
R:  Oh.
L:  So then I -- I stayed home for nearly two years before I even got this part time job out of the house and, um, and it was just a Godsend.  I mean, as much pain as I've been in, it is still a Godsend just to be home with my kids.
R:  Wow.
L:  You know, and be able to be there for them and to, you know, do all the school plays and the PTA meetings and -- [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, that means so much.  My girls are so active, especially my oldest one.  She's living in high school.  She's a sophomore now and she's into, ah, she's in the color guard in the band, and she's in chorus and all the plays and she just -- anything she can do, she does.
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.
R:  And my youngest one, she had her -- she decided she wanted to go out for color guard and they had their try out and she made it so I've now got two going into it this year.  [LAUGH] We spent summer out in the school parking lot most of the time doing band camp and things like that, but we go to every game and every performance whatever they do, and that means a lot to 'em, more than the little extra things they were getting when we were both, you know, working out school time and things, but they have seemed to enjoy it more because I talk about maybe getting another part time job outside of the home and they're just, "No, no, because you've got to do this" and do this.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They want me there more than the other things.  I mean, they don't -- they suffered a lot.  I mean, most kids they have more than they need anyway, but they -- they're real good and I've been lucky.  They, you know, no trouble or anything and they're both active in church real well and, you know, it's just another blessing from God that I've got my family in church and they look to Him too first and they're not often because there's so much here that they could be into and I just -- I'm lucky that they ain't, you know, like, they come up with good morals and stuff, so -- 
L:  It's hard.  
R:  It is.
L:  It really is hard to instill that in your kids.  I mean, I live in a little town, you blink your eye and you miss it.
R:  That's right, that's why -- where we're at.
L:  We live on Main Street and honestly I'm not kidding you, the street dead ends after quarter --
