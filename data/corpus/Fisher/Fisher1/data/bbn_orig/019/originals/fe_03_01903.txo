R:  Hi, my name is Deborah.
L:  I'm Cindy.
R:  Hi Cindy.
L:  How are you? 
R:  Fine.  Um, I guess we're supposed to talk about --
L:  Families.
R:  What the word family means to me.
L:  Oh, well, it means a lot. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, what it means to me is somebody who is going to accept me just like I am when I'm being perfect or when I'm being imperfect.
L:  Mm.
R:  When I'm being crazy and obsessed or when I'm being beautiful and related and selflessly loving.  [NOISE] Another thing that family means to me is somebody who isn't going to leave me just because there's something about me that they don't like.
L:  Mhm.
R:  In other words, not like a husband and, um, and wife sometimes feel that if they have incompatibility, they don't need to stay married.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And fulfil their commitment.  To me what a family means, even a husband and wife family, the whole concept of what the word family means to me has to do with sticking around even in the hard times. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because if you don't stick around in the hard times, how are you going to be there to see the glorious wonderful times? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's what family means to me.
L:  Um, I think it means to me not just -- I mean, yeah, my immediate family and my brothers and my sisters and my mom and dad and my boyfriend, but also friends too.  I feel sometimes they're extended family.  You can be really close to them and they can be family, like, to you.
R:  Oh.
L:  Oh, I think that, you know, even -- 
R:  It's true.
L:  Yeah, you know, work, you kind of have your work family kind -- 
R:  Uh-huh, right.
L:  You might not get along with everyone every day.
R:  Right.
L:  But something could happen where they're still your family, a death or a baby being born or something.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But of course -- 
R:  And church family.  And there's all kinds of families I guess.
L:  Yes, church family, exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's all different kinds and they all mean something different I think.  Um, ...
R:  Is there a commonality to what the word family means to -- to you [NOISE] even if the families look different or act differently for each other? 
L:  I think just -- there -- someone's always there, not even always there, but someone to turn to, um, just have someone listen or, you know, listen to them or even if -- even, like, I had my best friends who don't -- don't live anywhere near me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're still family in a way, even if I can't talk to them once a month or whatever.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Something might happen, you'll catch up and it's still family to me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  In a sense.  But I still -- 
R:  So actually what I hear you saying is two things.  Family means availability and family means we may not touch each other's lives in a direct way -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, on a certain level of intimacy on a day to day basis but that doesn't mean that you don't have a place in my heart that is lasting --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and I'll always be there for you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh.
L:  You might think about somebody and not be able to talk to 'em for a while and then -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, I was just thinking about -- that's funny that family came up today [LAUGH] because -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- at work we had two deaths.  I mean -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  One of my co workers lost her father.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And one of the same day, we got an email that one of the guys lost his mother.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it was really -- even though I don't work directly with the man -- 
R:  Mhm [NOISE]
L:  -- it was just all of us, it was kinda, you know, sort of a gloomy day today. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  You know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And that's our family too, we all felt terrible.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, what could we do right now but send cards and well wishes? 
R:  [NOISE] To show that you care for each other, right?  
L:  Yeah, and that's what we're talking about today.  We're one big family even if we don't see this person every day or talk to him or work with him, but we felt terrible today which was just very gloomy.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] That's wonderful.  One of my co workers, talking about wh- -- family and what family means, [NOISE] her mo- -- she gets, um, to live close to her mom. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so they make plans.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they do stuff together.  I don't.  First of all my mom doesn't live close.
L:  Oh.
R:  And second of all, I'm not sure that I could handle hours and hours and hours -- 
L:  With your mom? 
R:  -- having a whole day with my mom.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Like, you know, Cheryl does.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So I just really respect and honor, and I just appreciate on her behalf that she can have that kind of relationship.
L:  That's funny -- well, I mean, I do spend time, well, maybe like every other week I'm with my mom.  We do something, but my brother makes these little digs because I don't talk to him a lot.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I talk to my sister all the time, I have my nieces and nephews -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but he runs into my co workers who he knows and he'll make little digs, like, "I actually saw my sister on Easter" and -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  Like, it's not that I don't -- I don't intentionally do it, we're just both busy.  He's got two kids and a wife and I have my dog and boyfriend and my other nieces and nephews and my parents and we just have -- he stole my family and I -- I hate when he makes little comments like that because it's not on purpose.  It's we're both -- we don't really live near each other, we actually work in the same town though but we live on opposite directions.
R:  [NOISE] You live on opposite -- 
L:  Well, like, I live an hour from him. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But we work in the same city. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my.
L:  Which is weird [LAUGH] so we both drive in a half hour.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  But he works by a couple of miles from me and he does work in a restaurant so actually I used to try to at least go eat there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  At lunchtime once a month but I changed my lunch hour to a half hour so it's not -- I can't just run up there.  [LAUGH] So -- 
R:  I -- I have been divorced for about twenty years now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  No, no, not twenty years, eighteen, yeah, I was thinking about it just the other day, eighteen, and I know -- I -- I will never forget the reason that I chose to marry him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it was because he lived in the same house, he lived -- he loved and honored his mother especially, and he liked all of his family.  His family gets together still for every holiday, birthdays.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, everything.
L:  Yeah, that's good.
R:  And I had never had that.
L:  Oh.  
R:  Um.
L:  Did you live far apart from your family or -- 
R:  Well, I never lived at home again after I was thirteen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But what I really liked about his family is that they just -- it was like they held open their arms to me.
L:  Oh.
R:  And they gave me a different, um, understanding of what family could be for one another 'cause even after he and I separated and then divorced five years later, they made it really clear that my daughter, you know, our daughter -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the one that we had created together and I were always welcome.  And not only that, they almost, like, insisted that we continue to come and be a part of their family.
L:  Oh.
R:  Like for family gatherings and everything.
L:  So that's another family, that's neat.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, because I never had that experience.
L:  So do you still talk to him, well? 
R:  Um, [LAUGH] if it's -- if I keep it really short and brief.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And it pertains on a very small level with -- about his daughter.
L:  Oh.
R:  Now, the other thing that he really will talk about is what he's passionate about which is cars. [NOISE]
L:  Oh.
R:  Taking care of cars, everything about cars.  So if it's about that, now we could have a conversation.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But nothing personal.  
L:  Oh.
R:  That was the one weird thing.  I mean, here is this -- he loves and adores his family, their family is so wonderful together, but yet there's no soulful intimacy.
L:  Ha, that is too bad.
R:  It's almost like they know how to be really great friends.
L:  Except for family.
R:  But don't touch, like, on to soulful levels of intimacy.
L:  Is he close to your daughter? 
R:  Yeah, he is.  
L:  That's good.
R:  As a matter of fact, it took about sixteen years later.
L:  Wow.
R:  For -- for him to be willing to make changes in his life so that he could be available to her and have a friendship and have -- do the father thing.
L:  Wow.
R:  And she moved down there to live close to him now.
L:  Really? 
R:  Yeah, southern California.
L:  He's lucky, ah, she didn't resent him [LAUGH] for all those years.
R:  No, I -- they wouldn't have served me anything to, ah, expend that kind of negative energy.
L:  Right, yeah, but just from her own not seeing him and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's good.
R:  I just figured it was always my job to honor the concept that I had learned about what family could be and to not create or not close any doors because of something that was between he and I and had nothing to do with her.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It actually helped me to forgive.  It actually taught me, now that I'm thinking about it, it actually taught me a really important lesson about what family could be too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We could totally not even get along but we can find a way to get along because we have something important to be. 
L:  To the child.
R:  Mhm, which was parents.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, that is important I think. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You don't have to talk to him all the time, you just have to help raise -- 
R:  Yeah, just like you were saying.
L:  Yeah.  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And my dog's my family too.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, now, see, there's another part of family.
L:  Yeah, and then on the weekends my boyfriend brings over two so she has a family.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Like two of the girls that I work with here, they have cats.  They're cat lovers.
L:  Oh, they are? 
R:  Yeah, and one of their -- Tracey's cat died and -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it was so awful, and truly that cat was part of their family.
L:  Yeah, it's terrible when they die -- 
R:  Truly, I know.
L:  -- or when they're sick, you have no idea what's wrong with them.
R:  I know.
L:  I hate that.
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
