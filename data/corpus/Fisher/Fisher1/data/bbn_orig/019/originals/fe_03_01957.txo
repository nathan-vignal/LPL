L:  Hi, I'm -- 
R:  Hello?
L:  -- I'm Robyn.
R:  Hi, Robyn.  I'm Lesley.
L:  Hi, Lesley. [LAUGH]
R:  How are you?
L:  Fine.  Are you in California?
R:  Um, no, but I'm on the west coast.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Are you in California?
L:  I'm in Washington, but I've, I've always talked to -- ah, Washington state, and I've always talked to Cal- people in California.
R:  Oh.  Actually I'm from Washington but I'm in Oregon right now.
L:  Oh, where?  Portland.
R:  So -- yep.
L:  Oh, we're right -- I'm in Camus.
R:  You're where?
L:  In Camus.
R:  Camus?  I don't even know where --
L:  Next to Vancouver.
R:  Oh.
L:  Vancouver, Washington -- you know, Camus --
R:  Oh, so you're actually closer to me than to Seattle or something like that?
L:  Oh, yeah, I'm like --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  -- right on the river.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The way your accent is you sure don't sound like you're --
L:  I know, I grew up in Mississippi.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So what, I know we're supposed to talk about family --
L:  I know.
R:  -- but what made you, ah, move west?
L:  I got hot and I got -- I wanted to see some hills and mountains.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  All right.
L:  I moved here from Florida.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Mm.  Much hotter there.
L:  Oh, I love it here.
R:  Cool.  I like it here too.
L:  Well, um --
R:  So.
L:  -- so what does family mean to you? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it's a very interesting time to be asking me that, because I'm in my thirties and I think my parents are on the verge of a divorce.
L:  Uh oh.
R:  Yeah.  It's a very interesting time for our family.  So I'm definitely, ah, oh, in a position to talk about this topic, because I've been thinking about it a lot lately, and sort of revisiting what, what I -- what my vision, or image of my family is, 'cause it's getting to be a little -- well, it's getting shattered, basically.  So --
L:  Oh.  Well, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- give me your phone number real quick, before, you know, before they cut us off and maybe, you know, we could talk later -- if you want -- 
R:  Sure, yeah.
L:  -- my number's eight -- mine's eight three four two three oh two.
R:  Man, you're brave.  They're all recording this.
L:  I know.  I don't care.
R:  [LAUGH] Can you say it again, though, I missed it.
L:  Eight three four two three oh two.
R:  Oh okay, cool.  Thanks.
L:  Anyway, you --
R:  Um --
L:  -- can just call me when you get a chance.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah.  So it's just stressful, but um, but I guess, I guess my -- what family means to me has sort of changed, um, over the years in general, but at this time it sort of means, um, who you choose as family, and, um -- are you there?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And just, you know, what some of those bonds are like.  I've found that over the years I've actually chosen my own family in my friends, because of just, you know, the way that those relationships have gone, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and have actually kind of surpassed what my family has been able to provide in a way.  So.
L:  Well you know, I know I've done the same thing, I mean, I've got -- I don't think family exactly means biological, you know, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and it's funny because I just lost both of my parents.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  I mean, they, they both died in the last three years.
R:  Oh no.
L:  And -- there are five kids in my family -- I've got two brothers and two sisters, and you know through a div- I mean, you're -- in a divorce you're grieving something, and, and when they die you're grieving --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and that, you know, it's almost like you can see how family stress affects each family member.  And it's almost like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you get to know them through a tragedy, almost.
R:  That's true, and it almost seems that when you choose your own family by, you know, choosing to have that commitment with -- feels like family --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- somehow it seems easier to weather the hard stuff in that relationship --
L:  Right.
R:  -- than with biological family, and I don't know why, why is it that we, you know, expect I guess different things, or we put more difficult things on our biological family members, and so on.
L:  I think because we're still holding on to maybe sometimes grudges or things that we grew up with.  I don't know, but it's like I got to know my sister so much better through this -- through all this going on, and one --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- sister I became so much closer to, and the other one I was just so sad about how greedy she was.
R:  Wow.  You mean when your parents died?
L:  Yeah.  Because I was the trustee.
R:  Mm, oh.  I see. [LAUGH]
L:  And, you know, and all of it -- there's always one in every family, they say. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the five of us -- the four -- the other four, we were won- you know, we were wonderful supportive and -- but the -- this one just -- oh my God, it was, it was so sad.
R:  Gosh, yeah.  You know, what's that about. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, what is -- especially when she was what, you know, my mother's family did, and you know, it's like you at least try to learn from the past, but.
R:  Mhm, exactly.
L:  But one of the things I miss the most is family.  I haven't lived near family in twenty five years.
R:  Mm.
L:  I haven't lived in the same town with, you know, I've got a brother in Vermont, a brother in Florida, a sister in California --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and, and I'm in Washington, and my parents lived in Dallas. [LAUGH]
R:  Hey. [LAUGH] Well, it meant you had -- at least had some place to crash in every place you went. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, I know.  Um --
R:  That's interesting what you say about the trustee factor --
L:  Oh my gosh.  I could give an --
R:  -- because my mom actually --
L:  -- I could give an education on that.
R:  Well I bet.  And -- 'cause -- well, my mom was the executor when her mom died, and she has two brothers and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- oh my goodness.  I did not know there was such ugliness --
L:  I know, you don't --
R:  -- inside those people. 
L:  It's almost like you don't know your family until there's a death, or you don't know your husband until you divorce him.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That one I believe too, 'cause I've been there.
L:  [LAUGH] Me too.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  No -- yeah.  Okay, and so in a way -- and I mean this of course with all sarcasm and humor, but that's kind of the ideal, you know, way of where you can say, okay, let's, let's be family now, and you can say, okay, let's not. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, I know.  It's -- it's true.  And it's like now my -- one of my sisters and I, we're more like friends now, rather than sisters.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know --
R:  That's cool.
L:  -- because of all this.
R:  Mm, good.
L:  And um, and my other sister, she's like an acquaintance now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But my twin brother and I, I mean, we're still the exact same. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
L:  But um, I miss living near family, especially when someone -- one of them's in need, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You want to help them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but you can't get there to help them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or --
R:  I actually miss my brother the most, 'cause he lives, um, back out east with my parents -- well, near where my parents live, like a few hours away, and I just -- oh, my brother and I grew up so close the whole time --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- we didn't have like the sibling rivalry that a lot of kids have, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really love each other, and I think that's what I miss the most, you know, when you say that, that's what rings a bell for me, is, oh, my brother, you know.
L:  I know.  I know.  I miss -- I tried to get my -- my other brother to move out here. [MN] He's in Vermont.
R:  I tried to get mine to move out here too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, where in the east do they live?
R:  I'm like, it's much better out west.  Sorry?
L:  Where does he live in the east?
R:  Michigan.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  He would like it out here.
R:  Well, I know.  I've tried.  Well, he's married, and you know, they're kind of settled down, so.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I see these families getting together on Sundays in the summer, and you know, Christmas and I'm going -- and I just turn into a Scrooge.  I'm going, well screw you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it's basically 'cause I'm jealous. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, and they're having barbecues, and I'm going, I hate you. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  They always invite me though, but -- so I adopted the family across the street.
R:  Well see, there you go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, that's, that's about --
L:  Yeah.  That's what it is, they're my family here.  Like you said.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it's just, um -- I mean, I love their parents, I love their brothers and sisters, I love their kids --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so, you know, they always say, well Robyn, you can always -- you're always welcome.  And I say, but you never have to say that 'cause I come over anyway when I see cars over there. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Oh, well then they are your family. [LAUGH] 'Cause that goes back to that whole thing about, you know, what separates real family from, you know, like a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- pseudo family or something that people say you're the hardest on the ones you love the most, or -- you know.  I know that around my mom I, I can just have, you know, a really bad day --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's okay.  And it's not going to sacrifice anything, or --
L:  That's good -- that's so good. 
R:  -- you know, change her opinion of me.  Mhm, yeah.
L:  That's really --
R:  So I like that.
L:  -- yeah, when you can just be -- let be -- you know, if you're just irritable [NOISE] and you don't want people to try to fix it, you just want them to accept you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, okay sometimes I'm in a good mood --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sometimes in a bad mood. [LAUGH]
R:  You just want them to say, oh, she's cranky today.  Isn't that sweet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Anyway. [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.  You know, I love you anyway, you're cranky, you better love me when I'm cranky. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  But I do think --
R:  That's what family is.  It's about --
L:  It is.  That's what it really is.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know.  Instead of not accepting it and then gossiping with the other family members, boy, she's turned into such a bitch.
R:  Right.  I'll put up with your bad days if you put up with mine. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, really, really.  I just want you to know I'm PMSing right now, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Yep, exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  But I think it's important -- I, I think it is important that families at least
