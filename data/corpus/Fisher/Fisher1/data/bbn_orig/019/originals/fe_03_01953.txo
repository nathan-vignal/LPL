R:  Well I work in Wilsonville, so.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  At a retirement community. [MN]
L:  Well --
R:  Anyway, do you want to go first?
L:  Yeah, you bet.  Um, my family means tons to me, especially my mom and grandma, they're the people in my life that I'm the closest to.  I grew up, um, as an only child, and my parents were divorced when I was younger, so, ah, it was just me and my mom.  And so, you know, we were like sisters, and did everything together, and -- so just have a really special bond.  And my grandma helped out a lot, so.  I'm really close to her as well.
R:  What about your dad?
L:  Um, I, I --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- wasn't close to my dad growing up, um, but I am -- since I got married, you know, I'm older now and, um, we, we get along really well now.  Um, but we didn't growing up --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- mainly because of my stepmom, so. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- we get along really well now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I actually have a little sister, um, my dad and my stepmom have a daughter, so.
R:  Oh.
L:  So that's fun. [LAUGH]
R:  Kind of a half sister.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Brothers?
L:  No brothers.
R:  You're an only child, that's right.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I grew up as a -- I mean, I have my little sister, but --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I grew up, you know, just me and my mom.
R:  How long you been married?
L:  I've been married four years.
R:  Mhm.  I've been married almost fifty.
L:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH]
R:  Next year.  Mm.
L:  That's a lot longer than me. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Yeah.  A couple of three generations between us here.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [MN] Okay, well far as I -- my family is concerned, um, my father and mother, um, had a farm, never, um, never divorced --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my dad, ah, well, he had some horses that he, he used to do farming with and also, ah, hunting and things like that, and he had a, um, a buggy that he would take to town and take to, to, ah, fairs and to, ah, parades and things like that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know.  And, ah, and one day, ah, one of the horses, ah, that he was riding reared his head back and hit him, hit him in the face, you know -- 
L:  Oh no.
R:  -- the horse's head, it just reared back and --
L:  Oh.
R:  [MN] -- and then, ah, then he got a blood clot and shortly after that he passed away.  But --
L:  Oh, how sad.
R:  -- yeah.  But my mom lived until she was ninety seven, so --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- although the last few years she had pretty much lost her current memory, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  My great great grandma lived -- she died when I was eight, she was a hundred and five.
R:  Oh my gosh.  Yeah.
L:  And my great grandma, my great grandpa's still alive, but my great grandma she died two years ago --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and she was, she was ninety three.
R:  Oh, well you probably have some good genes too.
L:  Yeah, I hope so.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] But, ah -- um, anyway, I come from a family of four, or -- yeah, four brothers --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and no sisters.
L:  No girls, huh?
R:  No girls.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, [MN] um, I married a Westland girl, and um, we --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- have four daughters.
L:  Four, oh.  So you --
R:  No sons.
L:  -- came from all boys and then all girls. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But now I have eight grandsons.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No granddaughters?
R:  Two granddaughters.
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  But my, my, ah, closest brother, he had, ah, four daughters also --
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  -- and he has six grandsons and no granddaughters.
L:  Oh no. [LAUGH]
R:  It's just swapping back and forth.
L:  Yeah, you guys have a trend.  You're consistent at least.
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But, ah, let's see.  All of my daughters live fairly close, the furtherest one lives about a hundred miles away.  Um, so we don't get to see her as often.  But the rest of them live fairly close.
L:  Yeah.  That's nice that you're all pretty close.
R:  And, as far as family goes, ah, my wife and I live with our oldest daughter and her husband, and --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and our youngest daughter and her two kids, 'cause she just recently separated from her husband --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and getting a divorce.  Ah, they're living here too, so.
L:  Oh, wow.  So.
R:  So we have a big family here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that would, that would be fun.
R:  [MN] All the way from -- let's see, the youngest one is eight, I guess --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, eight and nine, and they're up to -- I'm seventy, so.
L:  Wow.
R:  We got quite a span there.
L:  Well good for you.  My grandparents are, um, they're about your age, and so I, you know, I'm really close to my grandma and grandpa --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they actually just came out to visit a couple of weeks ago, so that was nice.  My family's all over the place, so [LAUGH] you don't get to see everybody.
R:  Are they?  Well that's kinda good too, because you can travel around that way and go visit them.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  It is good.
R:  [LAUGH] [MN] We can't do that.
L:  It would be easier -- my husband -- yeah.  My husband's still in school, so it'll be easier when we have more money, when he's done with school. [LAUGH]
R:  What do you do?
L:  Um, I'm an estimator.  I run an estimating department for a traffic signals supply company.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Kind of a random job. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  No, that's a little different.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [MN]
L:  It's interesting.
R:  Yeah, I bet.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I take are of about two hundred and forty seniors.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  I'm a senior myself, but.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, working in a retirement community and so there's a lot of, a lot of family there too, that, you know, that come in and you see, see how families react to their senior parents.  Some come and visit them often, and some of them seldom, and some --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of them only come because they think they have to.  You know.
L:  Oh.
R:  And so -- yeah, so some of those people are really, really lonesome.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  That's how -- my great grandpa, he -- ever since my grandma died, he's just so lonesome and sad --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, they'd been married like seventy five years, and --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and just, you know, they were just best friends and sweethearts, and it was just so hard for him when she --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he's -- he always says that, you know, whenever I see him, he's always like, oh, I just don't have much to live for anymore, and --
R:  And what do you say to him?  You know, it's pretty hard.
L:  I know.
R:  Like, oh yeah, you got a lot.  Well, what, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  And he, he won't leave, he lives in this small town, about -- he lives about three hours from my grandparents, and he won't move up to the city, he wants to stay in the house that he built, you know, his house, and he still does all the, the yard work and cleaning and cooking, and it just breaks my heart.  He's all down there by himself.
R:  Where, where's that?
L:  He lives in this small town in Utah called Lowah.  And my grandparents live in Salt Lake.
R:  Oh.
L:  So yeah.  My mom lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
R:  [LAUGH] Goodness.
L:  So yeah, everyone's just --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- kinda all over. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And my husband, he's actually from here, but his parents live in San Diego, California, so.  We've just got them all over the place. [LAUGH]
R:  How did you happen to hear about this program, the Fisher project?
L:  Um, from a friend on mine --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that I don't -- I don't know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- where she heard, heard about it.  But I thought sure, I like to talk. [LAUGH]
R:  Does she -- yeah. [LAUGH] Does she do mystery shopping, by any chance?
L:  I think she does.  Yeah.
R:  That's how she found out about it then.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  We do too, we also do merchandising in stores.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  You know, we go into a store and we -- ah, well, my wife and I go together actually, and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we do, ah, jewelery and sunglasses, and we just stock the shelves and the towers and the racks and things, you know --

L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ten, twelve hours a week or so, but.
L:  That must -- and so they -- you heard about it through them?
R:  Ah, yeah.  Because the company that, ah -- um, not the company we work for, but the company that, ah, that found us the merchandising job also has us do some mystery shopping jobs, you know.
L:  Huh.
R:  Mystery shopping is kinda interesting, but all kinds of businesses have mystery shoppers, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, it's not just restaurants and things like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We do apartment shops, you know, where we go in and pretend like we were renting an apartment --
