L:  Hi. 
R:  Hi there.
L:  Hi, I'm Mary.
R:  Hi, Mary, I'm Jordanna.
L:  Well, I've never done this before so, I don't know where [LAUGH] to start.
R:  Well, I'm new to it too, this is my first call.  But, um, the topic was corporate America.
L:  Which I think is a mess right now.
R:  Yes, I would have to agree, and, ah, one of the things they said towards the end is how, how their conduct has affected you, and, um, I used to work for MCI Worldcom, so the conduct of the people that are involved in that has affected me greatly --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- since I was laid off last year. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that would.  I know, ah, my husband is a truck driver and the way the econom- [PAUSE] --  whether he's going to have freight to haul or not.
R:  Right, right.  Well, personally, I mean, my friends and I have been talking a lot about, ah, you know, how we were brought up is, you know, you go to work for a company and you work hard and you're honest and you're devoted to them and that they're gonna take care of you in the end.  And, and those days just seem to be gone.
L:  Yes, they do.
R:  You know, you get laid off and your, your 401K isn't worth anything because your stock is now worth nothing, so you have no retirement and you have no job.
L:  And I think before everybody was kind of loyal to the company that they was with.  It was kind of like, you know, more like a family.
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  Anymore it's everybody's out for themselves.
R:  Yeah.  Yep.  And when your leaders are, are taking advantage of --
L:  [NOISE] No you don't.
R:  -- people --
L:  Sorry, I had a five year old come talk to me. [LAUGH]
R:  That's okay.  Um, yeah, when the leaders are -- you can't trust them, and they're -- you know, it seems like they're just trying to suck the blood and money out of the company and then leave everybody hanging --
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, you can't -- you feel like you can't trust anybody anymore.
L:  No.  That's the way I feel.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're out for what they can get and they don't care about their workers.  It goes both ways.  The workers don't care about the company and the management don't care about the workers.
R:  Yeah.  Yep, that's, ah, you know, I mean Bernie Eberds[?] is sitting there getting paid a, a million and a half a year to not come to work.  You know?  Um, he's not --
L:  I'd like that, but. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I don't go to work and they're not sending me my check for a million and a half a year. [LAUGH]
L:  No.  We don't go to work we don't get a pay check.
R:  That's right.  That's right.  And I was just talking to another friend of mine, he used to be a flight attendant, and apparently the, ah, -- was it American Airlines?
L:  I think that's the one --
R:  They -- all the employees just agreed to take a pay cut to keep their jobs and keep the company afloat, and um, all the executives got a, um, retention bonus.  And it equaled the same amount that the employees agreed not to take.  So all the management and all the executives got bonuses, and the employees all took a cut in pay.  Now, that doesn't make any kind of sense.
L:  No, that makes absolutely not sense to me.  I think if the employees have to have a cut, management should have a cut too.
R:  Right, right.  But the employees did it to keep their jobs, you know, and management once again has taken advantage of the situation.  So my faith in big companies and having them take care of me is completely shot.
L:  Mine too.  It really is.  
R:  So --
L:  It seems like you can trust anybody anymore.
R:  No.  Well I don't -- I trust people, individuals, people I can talk to face to face.
L:  Yes.
R:  And, um, you know, I still have that faith, but you know, as far as putting my heart and soul into a company again, I don't think I can do it.  
L:  No, that's hard to do because you never know what they're going to do to you.  
R:  Well --
L:  They don't care about the individual anymore.
R:  That's right.  That's right.  Pay you as little as they possibly can, and get as much out of you, and screw you in the end if it suits their purpose.
L:  Yep.  They, they expect you to work for nothing and be at their beck and call.
R:  That's right.
L:  If they want you to work overtime, you need to be there.
R:  That's right.
L:  You're not supposed to have a private life. 
R:  Right, right.  Well, those days are gone for me.  I'm gonna try to figure out another way to make a living.  I've got three kids at home, so [MN] --
L:  I do too.  I'm raising three grandkids, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's starting over for me, and it's -- I don't, don't envy them, growing up in this world, I really don't.  
R:  Yeah.  It's tough.  It's tough to know what to teach them.  You know, you want to teach them honesty and integrity, but everybody around takes advantage of those qualities it seems like, you know?
L:  Yep.  You want them to teach them that, but on the same hand you want to teach them to protect themselves.
R:  Watch your back. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, it's tough.
L:  Because you never know what your boss is gonna do.  Be loyal to your boss, but watch him at the same time.
R:  Right, right.  People in general, I think.  Anymore.
L:  Yes.
R:  So where are you?
L:  I'm in Utah.
R:  Oh, in Utah.  I'm in Colorado.
L:  Oh, we're not too far apart then.
R:  No.  We had some snow yesterday.
L:  [NOISE] We had a nice day yesterday.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's a little windy today, but not too bad.
R:  Yeah.  Well, we got ten more minutes, or ten minutes total.  
L:  It's hard to think of something to say for that long.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I think I'd like to figure out a business I could start on my own so I'm only, you know, I only -- I'm only accountable to myself, and my conscience is my guide, and I don't, you know, I don't have to worry about being screwed, you know what I mean? 
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  So --
L:  But I think in this time it's hard to start your own business because everybody's out to run you out of business.
R:  Yeah, if you -- unless you can find a niche, um, you know.  Something -- I'd like something I can do from home 'cause my kids are, are in school, and daycare is so expensive that, you know, with the -- the economy the way it is I can't afford to go back to work and pay daycare.
L:  See it even -- it's the trickle effect.  It even affects people in daycare.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  Everything has to be -- you know, they have to raise their prices for childcare because everything else is outrageous --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so it doesn't make it worth your while to go to work anymore.
R:  It doesn't.  Um, you know, that's why finding something -- something part time, you know, that you could do from home that allows you to still be with your kids, is, is what I'm trying to come up with.
L:  Then you'd have a boss you could trust.
R:  [LAUGH] Most of the time.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Unless I'm having a crazy day. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I think we all have those.
R:  Yeah.  Especially with three kids.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So.
L:  How old are your kids?
R:  I have thirteen, eight, and four.
L:  And I have ten, eight, and five.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  In this -- in this group.  I'm raising three grandkids, so --
R:  Right.
L:  My other ones are all married and have grand -- have kids, so I'm a grandma, but in the same --
R:  But raising them again, huh.
L:  I'm in -- a mom too, again.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, I don't -- I don't envy them having to grow up in this world and going into the business, you know, into the --
R:  The workforce?
L:  -- workforce.  That's the word I was trying to think of.  Because that's gonna be hard on them.
R:  Yeah.  Yep.
L:  If there's even one when they grow up.  The way things are going you never know.
R:  Well, you almost have to have a college education anymore to even work at McDonald's, you know.
L:  Yes.
R:  Although in my -- I'm in Colorado Springs, but there's people with masters degrees working at McDonald's 'cause that's the only thing they can find right now.
L:  It, it's crazy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Some of the big businesses that you though would never in your lifetime go out of business are out.
R:  Right.
L:  And it's, like, "Okay, this is getting scary".
R:  That -- that's right.  So the -- I guess the military. [LAUGH] I've got an eight year old that I'd like to send to the military. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] [COUGH] Well, I don't envy anybody that has to go out into the work [PAUSE] do that anymore, so.
R:  Yeah.  Well, something's gotta change.
L:  Yes, it does.
R:  Something about the way people -- that -- the way we treat each other, you know.
L:  What ever happened to love thy neighbor, you know.
R:  Well.
L:  And not that way of loving.  That way is too frequent.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I don't, I don't know.  I mean I -- there's -- there are good people out there, 'cause I've met a lot of them.  But, ah, you know, you get stomped on so many times that even good people start to get jaded, you know?
L:  Yes.  You have to be leary of everybody.
R:  Unfortunately.
L:  And that, that's not good.  You wanna, you wanna live in a world where you feel safe and like you can trust your fellow human being.
R:  Well, and I grew up in a very very small town, so, you know, it's harder for me -- it's hard for me because you knew everybody, your mother knew what you were getting into trouble doing before you got home, you know.
L:  Yes.  My mother always told me that, "I know what you're doing even when you're not here".  And they -- she did.
R:  Did you live in a small town?
