R:  Hello, my name is Cheryl.
L:  Hi, my name's Alexis.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine, Alexis.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.  Where are you at? 
R:  I'm in Detroit, Michigan.  Where are you?
L:  Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh.
R:  Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh, oh, right.
L:  Right.  So they've got people from all over the country doing this.
R:  Yeah, all over.
L:  Oh, this is my second call so this is kind of interesting.  Um.
R:  Actually, it's my second call also.
L:  Is it?  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think -- well, I didn't get the whole topic, um. 
R:  Yeah, I was going to ask you -- 
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I know it's something about how to curb your illegal activities in government with corporate scandals.
L:  Corporate scandals and how it affected your life.
R:  Something to that effect.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How do we curb that? 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I -- I don't know.  Um, we've a lot of it here in Pittsburgh recently because of US Air and you may have seen that and you guys probably have it in, um -- 
R:  Oh, yeah, we have a lot of that because of, um, you know, um, NCI and a -- a lot of tele- telecommunications things, you see 'em all over.
L:  Right.
R:  You just vote for Adelphia, Enron.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, Andersen accounting, um. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  But I -- I think it affects us personally just because of the stock market and, you know, personal finances that actually but it hurts -- it hurts every person because if you're -- if they're doing illegal things that causes the stock market people lose their jobs and Detroit is, you know, a prime example because you guys have all the, ah -- 
R:  Auto.
L:  -- auto out there.
R:  Correct, yeah.
L:  Yeah, see, we don't have -- we did have US Steel here.  Now the only really big employer we have is US Air and they're pulling all kinds of really cool things with, you know, the -- because of two thousand and two and the World Trade Centre -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they're saying well, travel is bad and we're one of their hubs, their major hubs, and all they want to pull out of their contract with the Pittsburgh Nat- International Airport.
R:  You know, and I think when things like this happen, I don't -- I think accountability, um, accountability has been an issue with me in a lot of these -- these companies.  They don't seem to have the right person accountable initially.
L:  No, they don't, no.  It seems like that they can -- we have Westinghouse here and it seems like they -- the people that are the head of this go in, take their bonuses -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and leave.
R:  Yeah, and it's not fair.
L:  And it's almost like they're raping the count- -- the company.
R:  Yeah, they come in with that mentality, I'll go in I'll take what I can.
L:  Right.
R:  And if the company shall fall and its employees also, oh well.
L:  That's -- that's exactly the way it is.
R:  And they're -- they seem -- they be -- well, I don't know if they are necessarily protected but it's like with all the money that they take and all the money that the company loses and as you -- as you stated, employees losing jobs and benefits and thus for, they should be held accountable to the point where they have to pay it all back and then some.
L:  Right.
R:  And -- and the employees shouldn't have to suffer not to the extreme that they have been.
L:  No.
R:  Um, when they have yachts and, ah, you know, half million dollar cars.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  And ten million dollar houses and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and -- and have a plane and, you know, all of this stuff.  I think -- I think our CEOs, CFOs and whoever else of a O [LAUGH] are living too well.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  On the employees.
L:  And they're not -- 
R:  You know.
L:  -- and there isn't any accountability.
R:  Right, there is none.  It's like and then you see them go, they go before, ah, a jury of peers and what not but you can really only do so much.  They've already as you stated raped the company.
L:  Yeah, and so and then they walk away and they're clear and free and they just go to another company.
R:  Right, but they've lived the life off of you and I and then the stock market will plunge because they, ah, doctored the books or had ten sets of books and -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  By the time a firm accounting is done of all the -- the -- the matters that went on in company A, like you say, it falters, now they're at company B, but they've lived the millionaire life at company A and take that cavalier attitude to company B and the people who hire them, you would think, you would think, that they would say well wait a minute.
L:  I don't think so, I think -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No, I think because I think those people are at the same level and probably -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- doing the same type of thing and because one, for example, Westinghouse was Mike Eisner who was, ah, Disney.
R:  Okay.
L:  And so he was a Disney and then he moved to Westinghouse and Westinghouse then was bought out by CBS and then CBS, like, pulled out of Pittsburgh 'cause my husband works for them, and you know, he was forced into an early retirement and he didn't want to do that.  He was only fifty five, but -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, we were lucky.  He's been given a very small pension and, you know, our benefits are covered to a certain extent.
R:  Okay.
L:  But, you know, and he was able to get another job so we're fine, we landed on our feet but other people weren't.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and so and now Michael Eisner has gone and he's somewhere else.  And so it, you know, and he'll be doing the same thing to another company and I think that just isn't -- 
R:  It's not right.
L:  No, it's not.  It's not ethical, and I -- 
R:  Do you think that -- I -- I don't -- I don't know if, um, I think the -- the -- the, I guess, front line employees bear down to low to -- to do something significant but by themselves. 
L:  I think so.
R:  But how can we come together collectively maybe because it would then -- would -- within a company or within across -- across the board -- across companies and say that we need to have this come to a stop?
L:  We have, um, at work, we have what we call an advisory board which is made up of big executives from different companies and they come in and spend three days with us and they go through everything.  They go through your books, they talk to employees, um, you know, and you have to be honest with them and they look to see how many minorities you've hired and, you know, what your budget is and I think maybe companies -- a lot of other companies should do this and then they go and they take what they have done and they put this into a report and they turn this over to our CEO and they come in once every three years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so even though three years is a long time between, it kind of makes things a little more honest.
R:  But does it keep the CEO on the -- on the honest ethical moral track?  Is this assuming that the CEO is not crooked?
L:  Um, no, I don't think it is.  And our -- our people, our management people only get a five year contract.
R:  Oh.
L:  So after five years, the head of our department is -- he can renew his contract if other people vote for him to renew his contract.  Otherwise -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- he's out.
R:  I mean, you know -- 
L:  So if he's not doing a good job in five years, you know, they have the option, and I've been there twelve years, fourteen years and I have been through one, two, three, four, five department heads.
R:  Mm.
L:  Because some of them have stepped on and, you know, and some of them their contracts just haven't been renewed.  And so maybe other companies should look at something like that.  You get a five year contract.  There are no bonuses unless stockholders and, you know, employees -- 
R:  Right.
L:  Are getting their -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  What they need.
R:  Yeah, I would think so too.  I -- I think, ah, one of the biggest industries that probably should do that is the telcom industries, telecommunication.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They really should because their top people are always well compensated for a job not so well done.  It doesn't, you know, and the employees are the ones that really get the shaft on that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Always 'cause they come in with these horrendous, like, they call it, um, bonuses to come.
L:  Oh.
R:  And then if they do, you know, so well then they get additional bonuses and, um, meanwhile, the employees aren't getting anything.  They're paying more, [LAUGH] they pay more for their own benefits.
L:  Right.
R:  They get less in raises.
L:  Right.
R:  Yet, um, and their company seem to keep going down and those -- those, ah, industries weigh heavily in the stock market as well and I think that's probably why, ah, a big part of it won't come back [LAUGH] because -- 
L:  I think so too.  I mean, that's why the steel industry, one of the reasons that the steel industry failed so miserably in Pittsburgh because, I mean, we were steel.  And, you know, it was just one thing after another and now the latest one is -- and there's no accountability and that's the problem.  LTV Steel just said, "Well, our retirees, we can't afford benefits for them any more.  Oh well", and so now all these people who have worked thirty or forty years in the mill, you know -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- now have no health insurance.
R:  And that's not fair but have you noticed the CEOs and what not, those -- those people way high up, they have -- they always have health insurance for life?
L:  Oh, yes, yeah, that's true.
R:  They have it for life and they've been -- they come to the company anywhere from six months to six years, I mean, it's -- it's never really long.
L:  No, no, none of them stay too long.
R:  But they are taken care of for life and this is at multiple companies.
L:  That's yeah.
R:  They have multiple ranges of dinner sets available to them where the little people still are suffering because of their mishandling years later.
L:  Yeah, so I think there has to be some accountability in whether it's at the government level or a company --
