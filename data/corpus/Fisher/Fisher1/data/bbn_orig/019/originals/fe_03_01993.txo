R:  Hi, I'm Kelly.
L:  Hi, Marty.
R:  Hi, Marty.
L:  How are you? 
R:  I'm fine.  Where are you at?
L:  I'm in Connecticut.
R:  I'm in Arkansas.
L:  All right.  How's your weather? 
R:  Ah, it looks like it's going to rain.  We had some bad storms last night.
L:  Yeah, we get it tomorrow.
R:  Oh.
L:  But we're supposed to talk about the business economy.
R:  Which is sucky.
L:  Which is terrible in -- 
R:  I just noticed, um, on the [SIGH] Yahoo or something I was looking at on the computer that the Dow was down like a hundred and something points today.
L:  Yeah, it had a bad day but, you know, being, you know, maybe an hour away from New York, we get, you know, we stay -- I don't know, maybe, I don't want to say more on top of it than you do, but, you know, try to -- we hear more and they -- they, being Wall Street so close, but I don't trust 'em at all, and the more you read and every day and there's Enron and everything else and, ah, I think they're all in cahoots and I'm not really a stock market person, are you?
R:  Ah, no, I got a 401K that I really don't have much choice in how it's invested, and I have taken a major hit the last couple of years and, I mean, it's just making me sick and I've changed jobs to a different, ah, employer and I want to roll it over, and the guys I work with keep saying, "No, ours is worse, don't roll it over" [LAUGH] 'cause they're losing too. 
L:  Do you have the -- 
R:  I'm just waiting for it to stabilize.
L:  A matching -- a matching employer contribution? 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, I do too, but -- and I don't even know what I have.  I'm forty five so I know I got to work another fifteen or seventeen so I started, ah, just, ah, maybe six months ago having the deduction taken out on a weekly basis of buying a savings bond.  The, ah, Federal Government goes right into your checking account and I buy a twenty five dollar bond every Friday and I figure -- I'm -- I'm thinking of even upping that to maybe buying a fifty dollar one every Friday and -- 
R:  Do you want the government -- you let the government go into your checking account?  I'd be afraid that they'd take more than you wanted 'em to take. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, in this day and age, you know, you -- you check it every day and, ah, you know, it's all there computerized and anybody who takes it out, you know, you got it documented that they took, you know, two -- they hit you for two bonds but they give you the serial number right away and -- 
R:  Oh, well, that's good.
L:  And this and that and I just feel that's safer than the stock market.  I mean, you know, it's going to double in seven years or ten years and -- 
R:  That's true.
L:  And, ah, you know, the -- the way the stock market's going and, you know, you hear more and more of people who have -- I was talking to my father in law last year and he says he took a sixty thousand dollar hit in the last three years and he wants to buy a new car and he was planning on it, but he's retired and he doesn't think he can afford it now and, you know. 
R:  No, mine -- mine wasn't that bad.
L:  Yeah.  And, well, you know -- 
R:  Mine was only a couple of thousand every quarter but it was enough to hurt me.
L:  Yeah, and, yeah, I -- 
R:  Because I'm thirty seven and I've been putting in since I was twenty eight so that's, like, nine years.
L:  Yeah, but I don't trust 'em anyway as I think they're all politicians and they don't, they all -- they make their little deals before and, you know, the -- the big guys know who's selling what or what company's going to do what before -- 
R:  Oh, the insider trading like -- 
L:  The insider trading every, you know, that it's been going on for years.
R:  Oh, that's illegal, you don't think that goes on, do you?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, for cry- -- I mean, you might get somebody else that they catch, you know, and they, you know, how many do they catch and how many do get away with it? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  In, you know, so they -- is it the story that they catch one but they didn't catch the other fifteen?  You know.
R:  Well, we used to say about Enron earlier they were building that huge power plant out in one of our, um, rural areas, um, over the last two years and we didn't know Enron was one of the major [inaudible] in it and when all that blew up, now we have, like, sitting on, like, a sixty acre field, obvious electrical big, you know, [inaudible] and -- and, you know, those big things they have for, um, that they conduct the electricity through, and everything. 
L:  Right.
R:  Sitting out there and they're rusting because when they went belly up, it just left out there.  And a lot of people lost their jobs at, you know, when they first brought it in, it was going to be this real great thing, you know, and it was going to bring a lot of jobs to the area and -- and now you just drive by and it's all still fenced up and the fences are locked and the gates are locked and -- and, it's just sitting there resting and you can just imagine how much money's sitting out there.  It seems like somebody could take it and at least sell what's out there and make some money back for the -- the shareholders that lost so much.
L:  Oh, yeah -- 
R:  Yeah, but it's just -- it's sitting there.
L:  -- yeah, you read the stories.
R:  And if it sits much longer it's going to be just wasted.
L:  And the people who got ruined, the average, you know, mom and dad who -- who were advised or whatever and, you know, they thought they were going to be able to retire and do six months in Florida and six months here or something.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And not live like kings but, you know, enjoy themselves, then you know, sixty five year old people have got to go back to work because, ah, you know, the games they played and, ah -- 
R:  Well, see what they could take place at [inaudible] and you know if there's one here, there's probably several around the country.
L:  Oh, more than that.
R:  Why can't they sell that stuff that's sitting out there and there's -- they're just literally rotting, and try to recoup some money for these people that lost all their money?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've wondered that I don't know how many times.  It seems like the courts would have, you know, taken possession over some of that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And try to have sold it because you know there's stuff out there that other electrical companies could use.
L:  And all these people who were smart enough, they -- they hid the money and they, you know, the big shots and they donate to the politicians and who's running for this and that and the old story that the big guys, you know, would you go to jail for five years and -- but you know you got fifty million in some Swiss account somewhere?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know. 
R:  And because it's -- it's in another country's account, you know, they don't have to give it back and that's not right. 
L:  Yeah, it's under their kid's name or it's under something and they, you know, they can't touch it or, you know, it's just a whole big game and a mess and I -- I just don't trust any of 'em and, you know, financial advisors, this is -- I think they're just throwing sand in the wind too and just throwing it up and who knows what's going to happen every day.  You know, I don't even -- I, like, you say, I try to listen to what the market did but, you know, one day it's, you know, it goes up seventeen, twelve, thirty and then boom you get whacked for a hundred and fifty, and -- but it's -- it's really hurting a lot of people.
R:  It is, it really has.
L:  And, you know, the -- I don't know what the answer is.  You know, my father used to tell me growing up, you can never go wrong with real estate.  I wish I listened to him.
R:  Well, but you can too.  Have you not heard about that poor woman in Texas?  She -- she was a nurse somewhere up in Oklahoma somewhere, saved for years and bought a piece of land down there in Texas they were paying.  She was going to build her house there and retire.  Well, the EPA have confiscated this land because they found a bug on it.
L:  Oh.
R:  That has never been found anywhere else and now they've got this rights of -- of protection on this land because of this little bug and she can't build on it and she can't sell it because they're making it into a -- a preserve for that bug and she got screwed out of all of it.  She can't sell it.  The government won't pay her for it.  It has just been taken and here she has tak- -- saved for years.  And she is -- I've seen her on TV two or three times and, ah, the last time I seen her was a couple of months ago, but she was, you know, talking about, she can't even recoup any of her investment because, you know, the EPA has taken it as, you know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  This bug.
L:  The intimate domain or whatever.
R:  And, you know -- 
L:  You can't win these.
R:  The people suggested her, you know, if you burn it, the bug's gone. 
L:  Right.
R:  You know, maybe you can at least use it then and she said, "No, then they'll put me in jail for it".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's not right.  So, I mean, real estate's not always the best way to go either because that'd be me.  I'd save forever and buy a piece of land and have some weird little bug nobody has ever seen before and not be able to use it. 
L:  Yeah, so where -- which way do you turn?  Do you invest?  I mean, you've got to invest this day and age but, you know, do you -- it's even hard enough to scrimp enough to invest in anything be it a stock or so, so I figure that at least buying a bond every week I'm doing something and -- 
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- and trying to save something and, you know, at least the government backs that and I'm not taking some CEO of some board who is, you know, I don't know, who knows.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, you know, and every day you get something in the mail from this financial or, you know, every time on the TV you get these commercials of prudentials or let us -- let us help you in, you know, every -- ever- -- it seems like every other commercial's somebody, you know, American Express Financial Advisors or these financial advisors.
R:  Or [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, every -- 
R:  [inaudible] counselling and -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah, and you pick up --
R:  And, you know, those are just as bad as if you file bankruptcy.
L:  It's what? 
R:  Um, if you go to one of those.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause you are overloaded with bills and all. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just like if you file bankruptcy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because, ah, they call your creditors and actually tell them that you can't pay the higher price, you know, payments and everything and they, ah, the creditors end up revoking your cars.  They cut your interest down so you will pay part of it and because some of the people at work were talking about it and they said that it's just like, um, if you file bankruptcy in the first place.
L:  So, you're -- you're -- you're behind the eight --
