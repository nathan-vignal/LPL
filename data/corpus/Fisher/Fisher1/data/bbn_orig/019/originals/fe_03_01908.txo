R:  -- I -- I -- I need to speak to somebody and, uh, I -- friends sometimes -- you think they're your friends but they're really not.
L:  Yeah, I -- I, you know, I've got friends here.  Uh, I -- I just started doing volunteer work for the Sheriff's Department and I've started getting around and getting out and doing things and finally, you know, getting things going in my life [LAUGH].  I w- I had -- you know, my -- my ex husband had been abusive and all this here and that's why --

L:  Oh, he was -- he was just -- he would hit me and get mad at nothing all the time and -- and, you know, when your kids start begging you to leave their dad you know something's wrong.
R:  Yeah, well, that's pretty bad.
L:  Yeah, then when I left him I started talking to this one guy on the Internet and we met six weeks later and two weeks later I moved in with him and we've been together for about six years now.
R:  You're kidding?  You met the guy you're with now on the Internet?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, god, you've got to help me out.  I got --
L:  We met on, uh, a divorce chat channel.
R:  Oh, my god.  Want to hear something funny?
L:  What?
R:  You live in Sacramento?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Now, I suffer from major depression over a girl, can you believe that?
L:  Yeah, you know, I know how that is.  Uh, you know, me and my husband's been having problems lately because he puts the feelings of everyone in his family first so, you know, that kinda hurts.
R:  Yeah.  The girl that I was involved with she lives right near you.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah, in San Francisco.
L:  Yeah, that's about, uh, a couple of hours away.
R:  Yeah, so I can never got up there any more because I just couldn't handle it --
L:  Yeah, Phil -- Philadelphia's a long ways off.
R:  No, I couldn't go there anymore because of -- I would just get too depressed --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- anywhere in California.
L:  Yeah, I can understand that.
R:  But, I, uh, I'd love to meet somebody but I can't meet anybody, it's just not so easy.
L:  I know it -- it's hard but whatever, you know, our family -- you know, my -- when I broke up with my ex husband it was hard for a while.
R:  You know, I want --
L:  You know, I didn't think -- I didn't think I would ever want to meet anybody again, you know, or anything and --
R:  Well, that's they way I feel and I still haven't changed.
L:  But, you know, then I met Randy [LAUGH] so ...
R:  You're lucky.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I, uh, when I had -- see family's important because when I had -- a- at one time I had a lot of money and everything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm a lawyer.  And all these people used to call me all the time and I used to think I had so many friends --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but then when I lost my money I found out you really can't depend on them anymore, they really weren't your friends.
L:  That -- that's sad.
R:  You know, and I -- so, I -- the only people that call me now are my mom and my sister and that's about it.
L:  That's sad.
R:  I know.  Well, keep your eyes open, if you ever -- if you ever know any tall blondes that want to meet a nice guy, pretty good looking lawyer I'll come out there --
L:  Oh.
R:  I mean, I don't know if I'll come out there but I'll meet them somewhere.
L:  [LAUGH] You'll go anywhere, huh?
R:  Well, I wouldn't --
L:  Well, I hope you have good luck in finding someone, you sound like a nice guy.
R:  Well, thanks, but I can't meet anybody -- I -- I -- I'll be honest with ya I don't hav- I don't -- this is gonna sound weird, okay?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You're talking to a guy who doesn't even know how to do the -- use a computer. [MN]
L:  It takes time to get used to computers though.
R:  I just never bothered.  See what happened, I -- after I was de- devastated by this girl six years ago --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I just never -- I -- I -- my whole life has changed, you know.
L:  Yeah, it's hard, I know.
R:  A- and now I started -- I started appreciating my mom and my sister more than I ever did.  Well, when I had a girlfriend you don't appreciate them as much -- y- you don't give them as much time as you used to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and I -- I lost a lot of time with my family.  Now -- now, I spend a lot of time with them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I'm, uh -- I just can't meet anybody.
L:  Well, that's -- I guess, well someday you'll -- that right person will just come along when you're least expecting it. [LAUGH]
R:  That's what happened with this one girl and I -- I thought she was the right person but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I just can't meet anybody.  It's very hard.
L:  [NOISE] Well, see I -- I know how -- I really know how you feel because right after, you know, the -- I split with my ex I didn't -- I didn't -- I didn't want to meet with anybody.
R:  How old are you?
L:  Uh, forty six.
R:  You're kidding?
L:  No [MN].
R:  You -- you wanna -- you wanna know why I said that?
L:  Why?
R:  I'm forty six.
L:  Really?
R:  When's your birthday?
L:  April.
R:  April what?
L:  Fourth.
R:  Oh, so you just -- April -- you just had a birthday?
L:  Yeah, just --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  When's yours?
R:  I'll be forty six, July -- well, I'm actually forty five but I'll be forty six July twenty fourth.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes.
L:  [NOISE] That's funny, huh?
R:  So, a very hard to meet somebody.  They're either too young or they're too old.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I know it's --
R:  I want it to be somebody like in their thirties or something but I can't.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's very, very hard.
L:  You know, my -- my brother met his wife wi- -- through a Christian, uh, thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It was called Equally Yoked, is the name of it.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he just started going to these meetings and stuff and, uh, he met his wife and they got married within six months. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my god, all these things happening to you.  Internet, oh, meetings.  I should get out of the house sometime.
L:  Yeah, as -- as I say, you can't meet anybody unless you get out. [LAUGH]
R:  I know, I know.  But, um, at least one -- the only good thing about breaking up with somebody is that you start getting closer to your family --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you start -- you start spending more time.  And my mom is very old and I -- I'm glad I was able to spend -- you know, I'm still able to spend more time with her now --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- than I ever did.  And, uh, otherwise I was just letting time pass by with her, you know.
L:  Oh, yeah.  How old is your mom?
R:  She's eighty eight.
L:  Wow, she is -- she's getting old, isn't she?
R:  Yeah, and my -- I have my little dog with me, keeps me company, she's a maltese.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  A little -- I keep -- I carry her around in a little bag.  She's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I consider her family too.
L:  Yeah, animals can -- can help ya feel better a lot.  I know last night me and my husband were, you know, like, having problems because of, you know, hi- his -- his putting his family, you know, his sister and everybody putting their feelings -- well, even his -- his sister's wi- brother.  He's sister's husband first.  And the cat just jumped on me, I guess the cat knew I was sad and our cat --
R:  You have a cat?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just -- what's her name?
L:  Buddy.
R:  And that's part of the family too, right?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, well she jumped on my lap and sh started, you know, cuddling up to me.  I guess she knew I was feeling sad.  Animals can sense that when you're feeling --
R:  Oh, abso- absolutely.  An- and my little dog's name's is Houston.  She's -- she's a little -- she's a girl but I got her in Houston so I named her Houston.  I -- I didn't expect to get her.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I spent  -- and I know it's just hard to believe, I spend twenty four hours a day with her.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I take her everywhere with me.
L:  Yeah.  Animals -- I can't take our cat -- our cat freaks out when she goes in the car.
R:  Well, I put mine in a little bag and I carry her everywhere, even take her out to eat with me and everything.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  People --
L:  That's nice.
R:  -- think I'm weird but I t- -- I don't care what they think.
L:  Well, it's not -- you know, if you wanna take your dog with you like you -- you ha- -- you should. [LAUGH]
R:  It helps you -- you know, like I said, I suffer from depression and they help -- it helps you a lot to have somebody that cares about you with you, whether it's a dog or -- or your family, you know.
L:  Yeah, it helps to have someone that cares.
R:  And, like I said, I'm very close with my mom now and, um, I speak to her like at least five times a day and, you know, I call her -- I'll say, "Mom, what're you going to watch -- what show are you gonna watch now on TV" and we watch the same show together so we can comment on it later.
L:  Oh, right.  Well, I know after I left my ex husband I -- I became kinda closer to my -- my sisters and all them.  Even though I -- I moved a thousand miles away to get away from my ex husband I feel I talk to them more --
R:  Where in St. Louis was that?
L:  Huh?
R:  Where -- where in Missouri?
L:  Uh, Springfield.
R:  Oh, okay, 'cause see my ex girlfriend was from St. Louis.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, small world, huh?
