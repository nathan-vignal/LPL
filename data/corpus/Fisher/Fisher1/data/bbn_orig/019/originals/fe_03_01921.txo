R:  Hello. 
L:  Hi.  My name is Sarah. 
R:  Sarah?
L:  Yes. 
R:  Hi Sarah.  I'm Brenda. 
L:  Hi. 
R:  I'm in Chicago, where are you? 
L:  [SIGH] I'm in Montana. 
R:  Oh, wow. 
L:  Missoula, Montana. 
R:  I've never been to Montana. 
L:  Oh, it's a small place. [LAUGH] 
R:  I've heard it's beautiful, though. 
L:  Oh yeah, it's beautiful out here.  Mountains. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Chicago is fun too.  I've been, I've been to Chicago, a couple of times before. 
R:  Yeah, it's fun.  I don't know if beautiful is the right word, bu-  but it's a good word.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So we are talking about family.  Is that the deal? 
L:  Uh, I guess so.  I just signed up for this today. Um --
R:  Me, I just signed up yesterday so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it says to tell what family means to us. 
L:  [SIGH] Um, both of my parents, are married. Um.
R:  To each other? 
L:  Yes.  And I have an -- an older brother, who's also married now.  Um, but I guess they're not the only people I consider my family.  I have friends who are family, um, I guess family is sort of a support group in a lot of ways I think. 
R:  Yeah.  See that's what I think too, because I don't -- I don't have any family in Chicago. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I've definitely learned to -- like as far as my biological family, [SIGH] I have limited contact with them 'cause they're in different states.  [SIGH] So, um, I've definitely learned that family, like you said is a support group, or it is a different -- you know, it's not necessarily meaning you are related to someone.  I think it can just mean people that you're comfortable, you know around, and people that you can lean on, and share things with. 
L:  Definitely. 
R:  You know, and this might sound, I don't mean to sound funny, but like I consider my animals [SIGH] my family too. 
L:   Oh, of course.  No, me too. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Do you have a lot of animals out there? Or ?
L:  Um, I only, I have a bird. 
R:  Oh, cool.  
L:  I have a parrot.  Um, and he's my only pet beside -- my roommate, [SIGH] uh, has a bird, and she has a bunch of fish. [LAUGH] 
R:  Very cool. 
L:  And, I definitely think that we treat them like [MN] spoilt children. 
R:  Like fam- -- yeah I actually work with animals, so I'm like really a strong advocate of knowing a lot of people who consider their -- their pets, um, like family.  And my friend has a bird, I don't know [NOISE] like hardly anything about birds, but she loves hers, I mean, she is always talking about it, and what she d- --, you know what the bird does, and how it talks back to her, and I know that she would be lost if any thing happened to the bird, so.
L:  Yeah.  Wh- what kind of animals do you have? 
R:  I have, um, two cats, [LIPSMACK] and then I have one fish, and, um, even the fish I consider my family. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yes, this is funny. 
R:  You know, I feel guilty like if I forget him, you know sometimes I'll forget him, eh, you know forget to feed him, and then I'm, like, "Oh, no, I forgot to feed Hulio, and then I'm, like, "Oh no Hulio, here I am". [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And my cats are definitely -- because I live alone, with them so they're definitely like my family.  
L:  Mm
R:  You know, and, um, I, you know get 'em presents, and, you know.  I don't know, I get really, and I get really angry too --  this probably getting off the topic so, sorry if someone's whoever. [inaudible]
L:  The topic. 
R:  But, um, yeah, I get really mad when people don't treat their pets like family, like, and just abandon them when, you know when they move, or --
L:  Definitely. 
R:  Y- you know, if they get a new boyfriend who doesn't like cats, or doesn't like dogs, they just bring their animal to the shelter, and you'd never do that with a person.  Like, I don't think many people are gonna bring their son or daughter.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, to a shelter, because they meet a guy and they're allergic -- they think they are allergic to 'em.  You know. 
L:  I hate, um, you go pet stores, and they have [SIGH], those starter kits, which are like the smallest little cages -- they're something for I guess frogs, and lizards and things like that, just with nothing, and I -- I don't know people just, I don't t- tend to think that people think that animals have, um, you know, feel things as deeply as people, but that doesn't -- I don't know -- that's definitely not the experience if you observe them.
R:  I know, like last, last week it was really sad 'cause so many people were, looking for rabbits for Easter gifts and they don't -- you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That, that is so, so wrong to get a rabbit for an Easter gift, you know.  I don't even know what rabbits have to do with Easter any way. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, we were trying to figure that out.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But --
L:  Or chickens, people get chicks, --
R:  Yeah. 
L:   -- and then they grow into chickens. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh I know, [inaudible] the saddest thing 'cause --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know people think it's cute, and, you know it's -- I mean it's cute to look at, but it's not cute for the animal when it's abandoned, and you know, it's like left somewhere, and you know -- no, are you in like a big city, or like a smaller town, or suburb, or ?
L:  Um, it's a large city for, for Montana.  I think it's the third largest -- it's -- it's about -- we -- there's a university here.  I go to the university.
R:  Okay. 
L:  And, um, with the -- when all the college kids are in town, um, it's about eighty thousand. Sixty to eighty thousand people. 
R:  So -- so are most people there like in, like, um. [LIPSMACK]  How can I put it --like in traditional families did you have every thing there as well, like, --
L:  Oh, everything.  Everything.  Um, there's a large, uh, gay community. 
R:  Oh really, now see I wouldn't of even thought that. 
L:  [SIGH] No, yeah, there are actually is um -- Missoula's a pretty liberal, uh, --
R:  Oh 
L:  -- town.
R:  -- I've heard of Missoula.
L:  Uh, part, I think partly because of the university and it's also, um, a writer's sort of colony.  There's a lot of writers who come out here -- we've got a good creative writing program, and --
R:  I had no idea. 
L:   -- just the mountains attract it so, um, -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- yeah there's a lot of -- actually it's kind of interesting cause of the university, [SIGH] about a year ago, um, these two women, two partners, uh, filed a complaint against the university saying that they should have equal, um, equal partner benefits.  Um, but they -- their partners should get insurance like, uh, heterosexual -- 
R:  Right. 
L:   -- couple would get insurance, and health care.  [SIGH] And I think like a week or the few days after, they, um, they -- they filed the suit. Uh, th- their house was burnt down, with 'em in it -- they all got out.
R:  Oh --
L:  They have --
R:  -- my god. 
L:  -- a young child as well, but it was a big hate crime out here, and really pub- --  I mean they showed it around the country for a while. 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah I, you know I vaguely remember, like, this is some sort of like -- I remember hearing a glimpse of this --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and that's awful, cause I think that's definitely, like, falls into, like, a family as well.  Do you know what I mean? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's like the traditional family of whatever a hundred years ago, is not like, the way every one lives these days. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  You know, and so I totally agree.  I think if people, um, -- I don't think people should have to be in a legal marriage.   You know, I think there should be a way to clear your partnership, or your --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- family without having -- you know I don't know how you would do it, but I just think that there should be some way to do it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] so you can get those benefits, without -- you know tax benefits, insurance benefits, things like that without having -- you know it doesn't mean the only family in the word is a straight man, and a straight woman and two point five kids. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, see that's so interesting 'cause I -- I've travelled a lot, but I've never been to the north west, and all I really have heard about Montana, is that it's absolutely gorgeous, and that also like, um, [LIPSMACK] you know there is some cowboy and western people --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and then also, and I know this is so, like, stereotypical -- I so apologies, and that like a lot of weirdo's go out there that want to be left alone. 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You know. 
L:  Yeah.  Famous [inaudible] case.
R:  Right.  And that's like I said  -- I mean -- but I don't really believe in stereotypes.  Do you know what where mean? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  But that's --
L:  But, they're sort of true.  I mean there are still -- not so much in western Montana, but, um, eastern Montana's, completely cowboys, and you still -- you know they're all over town, and, [SIGH] um, --
R:  Now, are you in eastern, or western, or central? 
L:  I'm from -- I'm from uh, Tennessee originally. 
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  Yes.  Um, and came out here for college. 
R:  Oh, wow, so you'd --
L:  I have always wanted to come out to the northwest. 
R:  Are you in like eastern Montana now?  Or western? 
L:  Western, Montana. 
R:  Okay, and that's where it is not so cow boyish?  Right? 
L:  Mm, yeah. It's more developed.  Much more developed.
R:  Okay.  I've been to Tennessee, and that was beautiful too.  I went to Memphis, and had such a blast. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It was like too much fun. 
L:  You love the Elvis things. 
R:  No, not so much, Elvis -- I just like -- I just ended up going there for a weekend, and I mean I like, Elvis --  I'm not like an, Elvis, fanatic.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But like Memphis was like just a city I hadn't seen, and I was really impressed.  It was, you know a lot of fun, but every one tells me I should go to like the smoky mountains and --
L:  Mm, they really are pretty. 
R:  --  and that.  So, you know, yeah, speaking -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of family, Elvis, has a weird family life. 
L:  Huh.
R:  I mean his whole family is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- pretty bizarre. 
L:  I don't -- I don't know too much about him except that he was, he was very much a mama's boy, I think.  He had some, uh, obsession with his mother during his life. 
R:  Yeah, cause he had a twin brother. 
L:   Oh, that's right. 
R:  That died at birth.  Cause I don't know if you have seen, um, like any of the Lis- -- his daughter Lisa Marie?  Like her interviews, 'cause she just put out a record. 
L:   Oh, really. 
R:  Yeah, and um, so some of this Elvis, stuff is um -- Lisa Marie, is like thirty five, I think, but she was Elvis's only child. 
L:  Mm
R:  And, um, you know.
L:  Yeah, I can't imagine what it would be like to have like famous parents and [SIGH] grow
