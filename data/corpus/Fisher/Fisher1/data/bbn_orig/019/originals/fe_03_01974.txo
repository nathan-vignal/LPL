L:  Hi, I'm Jenny. 
R:  Hi, I'm Daryl.
L:  Hi, Daryl.
R:  How are you?
L:  I am fine.  How are you?
R:  Good.  Doing well.  Where -- what part of the country are you in?
L:  Ah, I'm in, in Texas.  Where are you?
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm actually in, um, Georgia.
L:  Oh.  So we're both Southerners.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So what do you think about, ah, the question?
L:  Well, I -- yeah, I'm not really -- I'm not really sure, ah, as far as that corporate -- what, corporate ethics, I believe that's what -- what I'm understanding that they're wanting us to talk about --
R:  Right.
L:  -- ah, and how it has affected us.  Um, I'm really, you know, not that -- although I work I'm not that directly involved with, with corporates, um, with any changes of, of, of corporate ethics, and, and I'm kind of, um, personally kind of agreeing with the way my company has been working.  I haven't seen any changes.  What about you?
R:  Well, I, I think they mean not only just the company that you work for, but just in the overall -- in the environment --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the corporate environment within the United States --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, um, in light of all the things that have happened recently --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with Enron, with MCI, Martha Stewart and some other people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- who have been involved in some major corporate scandals.  I personally think that, you know, these people should be prosecuted.  I believe that they should be, ah, put in jail --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think they key should be thrown away, and I have very little tolerance for people who already have a lot of money --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they're clamoring constantly to get more, you know.  We're talking about people who have millions of dollars already.  We're not talking about people who are struggling, trying to pay --
L:  Oh, definitely not.
R:  -- the bills to keep the lights on or -- you know, trying to, ah, -- these people struggling to -- maybe to try to stay in their million dollar homes or something like that, or -- and they're not even struggling to do that.  But you know, to me it's just totally different than if you had a situation where maybe say you had a, a sick child and you really needed some money to pay for his operation to keep the child alive, you know, to me that would be -- not to say that it would be right to steal --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I could understand that a little bit better.  You know.  But I just have very little tolerance for it and I think that it's unfortunate that the people who have the least are the ones who are penalized the most for doing crimes that are much less serious, in my mind.
L:  Well, and, and -- I mean, you're absolutely right.  However, I'm, I'm not sure -- and, and I think that what's happening, you know, it's -- even here most recently with American Airlines, um, I, I think that it's good, and I think it's going to affect change, but I don't know that it's going to, to filter down to the -- should I say the little person, um, until several years.  I think all this has to settle, but I don't know that any, any of -- any of the current, um, happenings, the news happenings have, have elicited any change as far as pay being distributed to other people within a company.  You know, maybe, ah, corporations who are involved in this that haven't gotten, should I say, caught, um, are maybe looking at redistributing it, but I wonder when that's gonna happen.
R:  Yeah.  That's a good question.  And, and one of the other things that, that I've seen and I think a lot of people have seen as well, I've certainly seen it in the media, is every time I -- I look at the newspaper or look at -- on the internet or watch TV, I hear something about corporate executives getting these huge bonuses.  You know --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- ah, [LAUGH] you know.  I think --
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  -- the money should be more -- perhaps more evenly distributed to the employees and they should share in the profits as well.
L:  Oh, definitely.  And, and what's, what's mind blowing is, is how these, these corporate executives are, are, um, protected even if they are fired, let go, or they're -- I mean they -- millions of dollars they're, they're protected.  And yeah, I agree --
R:  If they go and -- yeah, if, if they can -- somebody can go and serve as seat president and CEO of a major corporation for two years --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and in order to get rid of him or her --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as the case may be --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you've gotta pay them -- usually they even have a contract or some type of agreement where you, you pay them dearly --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to let them go.  I mean, somebody -- I think the other day I was reading that some -- there were some executives who receive these huge -- what they were talking about, just the severance packages that --
L:  Mhm, mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- CEOs receive when they're released from corporations, and you think about that in comparison with the other people -- with people like I'm assuming you and me, you know, --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- who, who maybe working for a corporation.  If they let us go they might give you --
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  -- three months' salary.  You know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I know, they might give us notice that we're -- that we're, we're gonna be gone -- 
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  -- yeah -- 
R:  -- and, and just in --
L:  -- instead of just locking us out.
R:  -- and they don't -- yeah.  And you don't even know that you're gonna be let go --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- until, you know, people show up for work, you know.  I have a friend that works for Coca-Cola and he showed up for work -- now he wasn't laid off, but he was telling me that he showed up for work and, you know, the announced that there were going to be five hundred additional jobs that were gonna be reduced, or --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- seminated[?].  And he showed up for work one day, and um, they called everybody and he said all of his -- the people in the department where he works, and either the people, ah, remained on with Coca-Cola or were given raises -- I mean, or were let go --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- right there on the spot.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they were told to go and clean out their desk --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they were dismissed, and they got, you know, maybe a couple of months' severance pay --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, just a very basic severance package.
L:  Yeah, they didn't get their -- they didn't get half of the company and two million dollars to boot. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  And, and two or three Bentleys.
L:  But see, and that's -- so that kind of brings me back to my original point.  So, so these executives are, are caught, but how -- you know, I don't say -- see these companies going, well okay, you know, we need to reexamine this, and let's kinda distribute this.  You know, I don't see that it's going to -- that it's eliciting any changes.  So as far as, as corporate ethics, other than getting caught, have, have they changed any?  Are they going to change any?  You know.  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- I mean, that, that's a question that remains to be answered.  
L:  Yeah.  And, and is, is, is that -- is that even -- well yeah, it should be an issue.  I mean, it -- yes, it should be an issue.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And, ah, um, however, you know, as far as our corporation is concerned, ah, it is well published what the president gets.  I mean, it's in the annual port -- report what he gets, what is severance package is gonna get, so why aren't -- why aren't people like you and I saying, "Hey, wait a minute".  You know, -- now Texas is not a union state, you know.  Maybe unions are something that need to -- I don't know.
R:  Resurface. [LAUGH]
L:  Maybe resurface to get -- I mean, unfortunately maybe to improve the, the ethics of, of the ivory tower.  I would hate that.
R:  I think that's a good point.  I, I think that may be one of the solutions to the problem.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know.  Only thing is if, if -- generally if you're working and if you're in management, typically it's very difficult to organize a union.  I mean --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- there are no unions in management.  I mean, you, you're just kind of on your own.
L:  Well, I think kinda that's the point though, yeah.  I mean, the management -- it's the underlings who formed the union to keep the management --
R:  Well no, well what I mean though was the lower management.  I was speaking of --
L:  Oh, oh.
R:  -- more [inaudible] you know, there are a lot of lower and middle managers who are not really directly involved in those things, who are not involved in the scandals, like the -- I'm speaking of the people who are doing all the dirt are generally the people who are upper upper management.
L:  Right, uh-huh.
R:  The right -- the president and right under him, his entourage.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  So --
L:  His or -- his her.  You were saying his, I'm not kinda, you know -- they're not all his.  I mean, they aren't all males.  There are females so I was just kinda --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That, that's true.  I mean, you know, and that's kind of -- you know, pardon my sexism. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I mean, but the majority of people -- of, of corporate executives in America today still are male, and that's why --
L:  Yeah, yeah. 
R:  -- I'm --
L:  I was just kinda jabbing you a little.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But you know, um, what I was gonna say though, is that I -- what was the second question?  It was, how can we resolve that, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- one of the ways that you suggested is the unions.  I think by sending them to jail, you know -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- by prosecuting, ah, people who are, who are guilty of being involved in corporate scandals.
L:  Yeah.  Well, you know, I [inaudible] that the people who are watching this are learning by example, but I'm being total -- totally naive to think that, ah -- and I'm sure there are some people going, gee, you know, maybe we should rethink
