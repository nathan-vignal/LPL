R:  Hello, this is Jane.
L:  Hi, my name is Gwen.
R:  Hi, Gwen.  So did you understand what the topic is about?
L:  Well, a little bit.  I -- I listened pretty close because whenever they first called, it didn't make any sense but after they had explained it a little more, it, ah, it does make sense.  It seems like, ah, especially in the past year, there seems to be more and more scandals that have affected so many lives and -- 
R:  Yeah, Enron and American Airlines.  I'm right in the middle of an American Airlines right now.
L:  Are you really?
R:  I live in Dallas, Texas so -- 
L:  Oh, I live in Texas also and have quite a few friends that work for American.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It has been watching along and I used to work in the telecom industry so World Com and, ah, and I used to have as one of my clients, ah, the big Houston scandal that went on down there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  In, you know, I -- I think it's sad in so many ways because the people that it affects don't have any say so at all in what's going on and nine -- nine times out of ten, they don't -- they don't have an inkling that it's even happening until, you know, until the bottom falls out.
R:  [COUGH] That's true.  I know, and it not only affects their lives but, you know, how much money they spend.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, when they -- can't buy cars, when they can't buy insurance and -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know, it -- it affects everybody so much and -- and -- 
L:  Well, it's -- it's -- I think it's -- it's tough, you know, because, you know, the big ones in the -- in the group usually come out less harmed than the worker bees like you and I, you know. 
R:  Yeah, that's very true.
L:  They end up with the golden parachutes that no matter how bad things are going to be, um, you know, they were -- they were protected throughout.  I, ah, worked for Motorola for a year, ah, in their, ah, iridium program which was a satellite phone program and it finally went bankrupt.
R:  Uh-huh, okay.
L:  But the interesting part was I knew what was happening as it was happening.
R:  But was there a big rumor mill and it was real scary, right?
L:  Oh, yeah, it -- yeah, it was really scary but it was more palatable because we knew pretty much what was going on as it was happening.  We didn't know everything but it wasn't just where you walked in one day and boom it was over. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like it has been with so many of, you know, the big -- the big companies that, you know, it's, you know, I, you know, a lay off is not fun but at least if you've been semi prepared for it and at least feel like there was no scandal involved, I -- I think it's -- it's so much harder on these people whenever they find out later that, you know, funds have been misappropriated and their 401Ks are gone and, you know, that there's fraud involved.  I, you know, in our situation it was just a matter of a lot of bad business decisions and -- and technology that was before its time and -- and things like that.  And that was much more palatable than knowing that the people who you've trusted, you know, have -- have not been making wise judgments.
R:  Yeah.  Well, and so what -- what can you do about it?
L:  Well, I, you know, I think at the point where I am at, I don't think there's a whole lot that -- that can be done, you know.  I think most of the time it's over my head, I mean -- 
R:  Did your company --
L:  Don't you --
R:  Did your company come in and help retrain or -- or -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.  I got a wonderful severance package -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, so, I mean -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I, you know, I -- like I say, you know, I've been in several downsizings and lay offs and stuff and I have never, ever been in a company where I had, you know, any inkling that there was fraud involved.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, that was lucky. 
L:  How do you feel about the Motorola, ah, or not the Motorola, I'm sorry, the American Airlines?  I mean, did you feel cheated and, um, you know? 
R:  Well, it, um, you know, the -- the news I think makes it scarier.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Than what's -- what's going on.  Um, I -- I don't know what those people are going to do, you know, what's it going to do to our economy as far as losing thousands of jobs in Dallas, you know, what -- what about houses?  Are they going to be able to, you know, support their homes, their, you know, send their kids off to good schooling, college or whatever and, you know, you just wonder what the -- what the big picture is like and -- and what did that guy just, um, um, retire yesterday or whatever -- not retire.
L:  Yeah, it makes you wonder.
R:  Resign, he resigned yesterday.
L:  He resigned, but, you know, how did it really affect him, you know? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Was he really harmed in the deal or was he just given -- 
R:  His name -- 
L:  -- hush money to go away quietly.
R:  Yeah, his name is just sullied and everything but, you know, he went away quietly with his tail between his legs off to get another job or whatever.  Because he is -- he is a prime guy for -- for a new job.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  He's creative and innovative and -- and whatever and -- and so, you know, you know, he's going to get a -- 
L:  Well, and what's sad is a lot of people probably don't think he really did anything wrong.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, he got caught, you know, and that's bad but, you know, so many people will feel like, well, he was just trying to do what was best for the company at the time.
R:  And he couldn't be all eyes and all ears.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, so, you know, that's the part -- I don't really know that [SIGH], you know, I know one of the questions that they ask was do you think it affects the economy?  And [SIGH] I don't know that it really affects the economy that much.  I think it affects people more than it affects the economy.  I mean, yes, if -- if American Airlines was to go bankrupt and there was a lot of people laid off, sure, there's going to be a -- a ripple effect out into the, you know, into the workplace because they're people that, you know, are their suppliers are going to be affected and, you know, there is going to be a ripple effect but, um, other than that ripple effect, I -- sad to say is I think people are getting used to being conned any more.  I think it's much more -- I don't want to use the word "palatable" but [SIGH] it's almost more acceptable than thirty years ago when my parents were working.
R:  Yeah.  My dad can never understand why I've had so many jobs when he worked at Michigan State for, you know, well over thirty years and even though he's retired, he still is asked to come and do lectures and -- and do such and such even though he's in his eighties now, you know, and he can't understand why I've had so many jobs and it's like, "But, Daddy, they don't want you".  You know, like -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they -- they have no loyalty to you like you have to them.
L:  Oh, no, no.
R:  And you're just so easily replaced and here I am in my fifties and, you know, I have as much experience as a kid coming out of college but I want twice as much salary as they do.
L:  Oh, of course.
R:  And so, you know, because I've -- I've -- 
L:  You deserve it.
R:  I deserve it, but yet they can get two people to replace me.
L:  Oh, exactly.
R:  And of course if they keep me, then they are going to make me do two or three people's jobs.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And when I can't handle it, and if I crab about it or whatever, then, you know, I'm uncooperative or whatever and then -- 
L:  And then when the axe falls you'll be the first to go.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I think that's the -- that is the key that is hard for people our age as we watched our parents with the same job for twenty, thirty years, and our society any more is just not set up that way.
R:  And my daddy used to take a month or a month and a half vacation.  We used to go places.  We went to Europe.  We went to Mexico.  We went and did fun cool things together and now, you know, if -- if you're sick for one day, then the work on your desk is -- is not taken over by somebody or it hasn't -- 
L:  No.  
R:  You know, it's not passed off to somebody or shared, it's, like, there when you get there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, so yeah. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  The, um, the loyalty from corporations is not what it used to be.
L:  No, it's not.  No, it's -- it's, it's a totally different society.  And, you know, the -- the thing about the lay offs and things, you know, whether it affects our economy, I think is what's sad is people are very accepting of the fact nowadays if you go on a job interview, it's not the stigma that it used to be if you've had five jobs in the last three years, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was reading an article about that, and, you know -- I think.
R:  Just as long as you use the appropriate word, you know, that was a cezanne[?] or a downsizing or -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know, the company moved or whatever.  Like, my -- my husband's company moved, um, from Dallas to New Jersey and they offered him the same salary that he was making here for a move to New Jersey.  Well -- but the cost of living up there is more.
L:  Yes.
