L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, how are you doing? 
L:  My name's Susan.
R:  I'm Kelly.
L:  Hi Kelly.  So are you familiar with the, um, topic?
R:  Um, a little bit.  Are you?
L:  A little bit. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't feel like I'm really, um, real knowledgeable.  Um, probably the most knowledge I gained was from watching that movie on TV about Enron. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, that's true.
L:  [LAUGH] So that was a good movie they had it on, um, I guess it was on HMO and it was just disappointing that the people that were so high up were so greedy.
R:  I know, very greedy.
L:  Yeah.  And they, um, also had no, um, no concern even about human life.  I mean, um, they even said in the movie that, you know, the -- the one man that had been scheduled down in some other country where they were installing the gas lines -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And he knew that there was a leak and he reported that and they immediately moved him away from there and re- relocated him and eventually that leak blew up and people were killed.
R:  That is ridiculous.
L:  Isn't that sad? 
R:  It's very sad and I'm sure that goes on in huge corporations all over America.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Things like that.
L:  I was shocked.
R:  That is very sad.
L:  Yeah, and he said if you -- at Enron if you can't say something positive, don't say anything at all.  They don't want to hear any negative news.
R:  Right, and then looked what happened to 'em.
L:  Right.
R:  My goodness, it's very sad.
L:  I know, and I think -- 
R:  So what do you -- 
L:  -- it has affected the stock market.
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Definitely with all these companies crumbling.  Look at American Airlines.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  People are afraid to fly too.
R:  Oh, I know, I know.
L:  Are you?
R:  Ah, not really.  I flew in October so -- 
L:  Did you?
R:  I wasn't too -- I was a little afraid when I got on the plane but after getting on the plane and being on there I wasn't too bad.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Yeah.  How about you?
L:  I don't fly very often but my son does have to fly frequently.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  For his work, you know, and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- he's nervous.
R:  Oh, I'm sure.
L:  Yeah.  And, um, he doesn't like flying.  I am older so that when we used to fly, it was so nice, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, I guess I kind of figure if it's your time, it's your time and -- 
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  -- I'm not going to live my life in fear, you know.
R:  Right, that's kinda what I had to think when I got on the airplane. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it worried me 'cause I had my whole family with me and I was thinking ooh, they could take us all out.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  In one sitting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But we made it.
L:  Oh.
R:  We made it back safely. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, but it's just too bad.  I mean, that's not good for our nervous system to feel that stress, you know.
R:  No.
L:  Like --
R:  Exactly.
L:  So you have children?
R:  Yeah, I have one.
L:  One, yeah. 
R:  One son.
L:  How old is he? 
R:  He's two.
L:  He's a doll.  
R:  Yeah, he's just a baby.
L:  My little grandson's two.
R:  Oh, that's exciting. [LAUGH]
L:  Much nicer to be a grandma I think. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I'm sure.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm just starting, I know.
L:  I would be, um, scared to death if they took my grandchildren on the plane, more afraid than for myself going.
R:  Right, right. 
L:  Because it would just be such a loss if something happened to them I don't know if I could cope.
R:  I know.
L:  You know.
R:  I know, I understand, ugh.
L:  Yeah, so, um, what type of work do you do?  Do you work? 
R:  I work for the government. 
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  Yeah, yeah, the state government.
L:  Oh.
R:  What about you?
L:  What state are you in? 
R:  Texas.
L:  Texas.
R:  Mhm, and you?
L:  I'm in Michigan and I work for the university, University of Michigan.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But we're experiencing, um, budget cuts.
R:  So are we.  In fact I just went to a meeting today.  They're cutting our health insurance, like, way back where we're going to have to start paying a percentage of our -- we used to be on HMO.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And now it's still going to be like an HMO but you still -- you have to pay like twenty per cent of all your -- all your things you go to like your lab work, xrays, stuff like that and we've never had to do that here in Texas so it's going to be a huge -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- huge, huge, huge thing.
L:  How upsetting because -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's just hard enough financially, you know.  You feel like you -- everybody lives within their means -- 
R:  Right.
L:  So then when they add more expenses.
R:  Right, and they don't give you any more income.
L:  Exactly.
R:  But they add more expenses. 
L:  And then they have this attitude well just be glad you have health insurance.
R:  Exactly.
L:  But they -- 
R:  That's what they were saying today.  Look at all these people in the world that have lost their jobs, have no health insurance, be glad you have health insurance but I'm like, "Look, you know, that's not the way we look at it".
L:  Right, we look at it, like, how are we ever going to do this? 
R:  Exactly.  And I think Texas had to cut like, nine -- no, twenty one billion dollars. 
L:  Oh.
R:  So they're cutting wherever they can.  And I guess I'm just should be very thankful that I still have a job since -- 
L:  Yeah, they're laying off like crazy.  It is scary, you know. 
R:  Yeah, it's very scary.
L:  And then, I mean, if you could have seen the rich people at Enron.  I mean, our country is getting to be like the third world countries where there's the very wealthy and the very poor.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And the middle class is just disappearing.
R:  Mhm, that's true. [NOISE]
L:  And nobody can afford a home any more.  I mean, the price of housing's just out of sight.
R:  I know.
L:  I was looking at houses just this weekend and, I mean, the average house -- 'cause I'm in an expensive area -- but in Ann Arbor the average home is two hundred and forty thousand.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Yeah, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  And it seems like the richer keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer.
L:  Yeah, yeah, and we keep having more expenses, like, now we have to pay our health insurance.
R:  Right.
L:  And they don't even pay their taxes.  I mean, we probably pay more taxes than they do.
R:  Than they do, mhm. 
L:  Because they can afford all these tax cuts.
R:  Exactly.
L:  So it makes me angry that, um, the government -- I don't know what the government could do to improve it but it would seem like, um, I don't know, I talk to people from other countries, you know, and, um, specialize medicine, so -- 
R:  That's true.
L:  So I'm pretty good at this point.
R:  I know, I know.  
L:  And --  
R:  It does sound good.
L:  Right, and they have a lot of other benefits too as far as housing goes and, like, if they don't work out in the one job then there's other jobs they can do, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  While they look for something else and, I mean, it seems like our country is just getting, um, so that it's very hard to live here.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and the elderly are really suffering.  My mother is in her nineties now.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Yeah, and, like, her income back from when she worked, you know, with inflation, I mean, and the rate of her social security because of the rate of money that she earned back then, um, I mean, when you're old, you're, um, unable to improve your situation and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and you're stuck.
R:  It's sad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it seems like they're cutting -- the government is cov- cutting more and more for the elderly.  I know here in Texas they are trying to do away with almost the whole entire elderly and disabled program just to save money, and I just can't -- we have a lot of old people in Texas.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know what they're going to do.  I feel so bad for them.
L:  They say with the baby boomers, you know, all turning middle aged now --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  That our country's going to be a lot older.
R:  Right.
L:  Everywhere.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Each day in Michigan in the next twenty years, it will be like Florida.
R:  Wow.
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  With all the seniors, you know.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  And the three page obituaries, you know. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Is what I think, when visited St Petersburg, I was amazed at the obituary columns, it took pages. 
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  I'm exaggerating but they took a good two pages, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  I know.  So -- 
R:  That's funny.
L:  Know what they'll accomplish by -- well, they expect for us to take care of them.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- but we can't afford a house, so where are they going to go? [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know.
R:  It's sad.
L:  So I was hoping maybe the economy was better other places.
R:  I don't think it is.  I know my father in law and my father right now are out of work.
L:  Are they really? 
R:  And it's all because of nine -- I mean, everything down trickled from nine eleven and they both are out of work now and they both -- they have been out of work since Christmas, both of them, and I mean, they had executive level jobs and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Both of them.
L:  And they are older now.
R:  Have only had, yeah, older.  Like, in their -- my father is in his sixties and my father in law is in his fifties but -- 
L:  Not old enough to retire.
R:  Right.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  Exactly, so they're fast and furiously looking for a job and they can't -- 
L:  Who's going to hire 'em at that age? 
R:  Exactly.  They're overqualified, you know.
L:  Yeah, and they expect a higher salary than somebody that's -- 
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  Plus they have higher medical expenses.
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  So -- 
R:  And I feel so bad for them.
L:  I hope that -- 
R:  'Cause neither one of 'em -- I think they've had -- each had a phone interview and that's about it.  Nothing has -- they haven't had anything. 
L:  That's so scary, I am so sorry.  It is, it's just -- 
R:  I know.
L:  -- so upsetting that, you know, especially when it hits home with people that you love, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you see how upsetting, and they probably still have their homes they're paying for.
R:  Yes, they do.
L:  Plus you can't retire because the stock market has taken away all of -- 
R:  All of your money, uh-huh.  That's what my dad said, he hadn't really had a retirement fund in years and then he had put all of his money into the stock market.
L:  Yeah.
