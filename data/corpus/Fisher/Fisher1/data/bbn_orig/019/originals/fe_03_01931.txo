L:  Hello. 
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi this is Deborah.
R:  Hi I'm Christina. 
L:  Hi, how are you? 
R:  Good, how are you? 
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH] So [COUGH] have you done this before? 
R:  Uh, yeah I did it last night. 
L:  Oh, okay? 
R:  Have you? 
L:  No this is first time. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How did you find out about it?
R:  Um, on a search on the Internet. 
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  How about you? 
L:  Um, well I do this other line of work, mystery shopping --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it just so happens one of the coordinators had some information on this so she had [COUGH] passed on this information. 
R:  Oh.
L:  So any way we're supposed to talk about family? 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Okay, wanna start? 
R:  Um, yeah, I guess. 
L:  Okay. 
R:  Um, [SIGH] I just got married, like, a month ago, so, um, I think that family, um, is starting to mean a lot more to me -- you know like I have -- I have a mum and a dad, and, um, all of that but, um, now that I have got married it's, like, you know there's somebody else that I have to focus on, and then, um, where -- we wanna have kids so it's kind of like your whole attitude towards family life changes when it's two of you. 
L:  Right. 
R:  You know what I'm saying? 
L:  Right. 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, no, I understand completely because, um, my family has been very disconnected because, um, -- hold on the second [NOISE] being recorded on my answering machine.  [NOISE] Okay, um, [COUGH] 'cause my parents split up when I was a kid, and, um, then my sister passed away, um, like, in her twenties and so then it was just me and my mum. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, you know so it was kind of like very disconnected, and now that I started my own family cause I'm married also and I -- we just had a baby, he's, uh, eighteen months.
R:  Oh.
L:  I -- you know, I'm focusing more on my immediate family -- my immediate family has changed. 
R:  Right. 
L:  It's no longer, you know, what was, it's more what is. 
R:  Right. 
L:  So I understand that.
R:  Yeah and I understand where you're coming from 'cause my parents got divorced when I was a year old. 
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  So my dad is actually my step dad --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause I don't have any contact with my real dad. 
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  Since the wedding.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Don't want any contact with him. 
L:  Wow.  So you haven't had any contact since you were a year old?
R:  No, we've had a little bit of contact, um, -- it was my mum and I from the time I was a year old up until I was seventeen.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- and we kind of had contact with my dad was not the type of dad that you would want.  He didn't try to see me, he didn't want to see me, he took us to court -- I mean it was horrible --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, we started getting a relationship back together and then he made his own other family, and kind of left me out. 
L:  Mm.
R:  So we haven't, um, -- we haven't really had much contact for two years, but he was invited to the wedding and he came. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  He almost didn't come cause my step dad walked me down the aisle, but --
L:  Oh, he -- he was resentful about that?
R:  Yeah, and then my husband his family is close --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so it's kind of -- it's hard for him to understand you know when I get upset because my dad's not around and things like that. 
L:  Yeah I have exactly the same situation where my father's family is very close --they're in meshed even -- you know they're mostly all on the east coast and [MN] they're very much in each others life and my family is all over the place. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know cousins and what not they're very spread out.  And very distant from each other, so it was kind of hard for me to get into this pattern of attending all these family functions and -- you know, like getting used to a routine of being with family again.  [MN]
R:  Right. 
L:  Um, like I kind of fought it the first two years that we were dating and wh- -- after we got married, but then [MN] now it's become pretty natural, where I'm not fighting it any longer and I kind of like it. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [MN] Um, and as a matter of fact like at our wedding I was kind of -- that was my family because since they are all over the place, they're, you know, not as much participation on my side of the family as there was on his.  Like his family all came.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know and it was expected that they would come.  Where as like on my side of the family it was pretty optional.  [MN] And, yes, as far as my father he had died I guess about five years ago and I -- you know, kind of like wondered how comfortable I would have been with him even being at my wedding because he was an alcoholic. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And I just wouldn't of been able to trust him being sober that day, you know, so it would have of been uncomfortable.  And so I didn't really have to make that choice. 
R:  Yeah -- yeah it was hard on my wedding 'cause, like, my whole family doesn't get along.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  Like my grandmother which is my mum's mum, doesn't get along with us and then my mum's sisters doesn't get along with -- I mean it's -- it's -- it pause pretty messed up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so of course we were worried that somebody was gonna, you know, do something --
L:  Create the scene.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Everybody acted alright.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, every thing was [inaudible] so I guess you know I did have a few resentments about people who didn't show up you know, and just didn't even respond to invite, cause I stay connected with the whole family.  I'm one of the few people who have, you know, most of my cousins like they don't really stay in touch with the other cousins but -- I'd like to travel a lot so I am always visiting, you know, this one or that one and [MN] so I kind of stay in touch with everybody --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, I go to their weddings, you know, so like I'm going to one next week in Florida, and my mother's down there any way -- so I want her to see the baby, you know, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause we haven't been down there in about six months, um, but, you know, I would -- I would go anyway, you know, cause I think that you should be there for the occasion. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Um.
R:  And family's important and I think I started to realize that word lately with, um, you know my step dad and I getting closer and then being a part of my husband's family. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Because before I thought family was my mum.  [LAUGH]
L:   Right. 
R:  And now, you know, you find out that there is more than that. 
L:  Right.  Yeah we're not even sure like, [MN] you know, I kind of would like to have another baby, um, just so that it is a bigger unit. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, 'cause, you know, I guess, like, -- I'm kind of an only child now, you know, and it's so fleeting, you know, and to see, like, -- you know, like, if my -- when my mother passes away that's it, you know, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- my immediate family, and I guess, you know, I would like to build a bigger family, but at the same time I don't know if I have to energy -- the stamina to kind of do it 'cause I'm older, I'm in my forties. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And started a family late, you know, so I'm just thinking it's kind of rough to start it now. 
R:  Right.
L:  You know, if I was in my twenties maybe I would have more energy to do it.  So it's something we've been saying, like, I kind of would probably do it but my husband's not willing to h- -- unless, like, I took over all the responsibility.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  'Cause he thinks it's too much work.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And he doesn't really want to do the work 'cause, you know, when he was growing up his mother did it all. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And he kind of expects me to do it all, so we have a lot of --
R:  Different views. 
L:  Yeah, and we have difficulty over it, you know, -- we've sought out counselling over it because I'm just not on that mind set. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I'm a modern woman, you know, and I just don't believe that my job is to diaper and feed, and, you know, you don't have to do any thing except, you know get waited on. 
R:  Yeah, I'm pretty much lucky 'cause my husband understands that if we have kids, you know, he has to take care of them as well as me, and we worked an out where he'll just have to work his job at night and I'll have to work my work mine during the day so that we can both be there. 
L:  Yeah, well, you know, we -- I thought we had that agreement too because he seems to be, you know, very modern also, you know, where he really didn't seem that way when we were first married -- you know, he helped clean up and stuff, you know, he wasn't the type that wanted to be waited on, and it -- but after the baby came and he saw the work that was involved all of a sudden, you know, it was just like he didn't want the work. 
R:  Right. 
L:  So he kind of started taking this different attitude, and, um, he was working at night which really worked out well because, [MN] you know, we could do shifts, um, but he really just didn't want the responsibility -- stop it
