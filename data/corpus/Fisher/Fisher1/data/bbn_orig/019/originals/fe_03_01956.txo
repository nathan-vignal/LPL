L:  Hello? 
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name is Sharon.
R:  I'm Jenny.
L:  Hi.  Where do you live?
R:  I live in Seattle.
L:  Ah.  I live down in Eugene, so we're kind of on the same coast anyway.
R:  Yeah, mm.
L:  [LAUGH] And okay, so we're supposed to discuss what family is?
R:  Mhm.
L:  What is family to you?
R:  Well, in my world I have a roommate and a baby in my house, so that's somewhat of a family, I guess.
L:  Somewhat of a -- definitely.
R:  And I have a mom and stepdad and his five boys, so that's another one. [LAUGH] And I guess I have a third one, because I have a boyfriend and he has two children, so.
L:  Aha.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So you have all kinds of variety of families?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Huh. [LAUGH]
R:  And what about with you?
L:  Well, I have -- don't have a whole lot of family, I have -- I -- my daughter, ah, has a five year old and her and I share a piece of property down here in Eugene, and I have a little house in the back, she has the bigger house in the front.  So that's part of my family.  And then I also have another son and another daughter that are older, and the live in the Eugene area too.  The other daughter has a boy and a girl, grandkids, and then my son has never been married and thank goodness has no children. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then the only other family I have is my own family is I have a brother that lives in, ah, Kansas.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And other than that I don't have anybody else, but I'm a little bit older than you are --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so all my family's kinda gone.  But we have a lot of, lot of extended family.  My daughter has a lot of real close friends that she's had for a long time that have kinda gone through -- I just lost my husband six years ago, and so they kinda were around before he passed away, and were there when he didn't -- was sick and did pass away, so they're kind of a, kind of an extended family, so.  I guess I would say I have a large extended family, but not a very big close family, so.  But I think a family is what you make of it.  It doesn't necessarily have to be your blood, it can be anybody.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just how close you are.  You know, how close you are to them, so.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's, it's fun to be able to share somebody else's family some time when they don't have somebody close.
R:  Mhm.
L:  In the area or something, you know, if it's not -- if it's of younger people that don't have the fam- their mothers or fathers around them, it's nice to be able to share your family with them, so.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which sounds like what you've done with your roommate.
R:  Yeah, I guess so.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Her family's in Arizona, and we're both from Arizona, but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- my mom and I moved up here after I graduated from high school and then kind of started our new worlds or whatever. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  And then my extended family is in North Dakota.  My grandma and my aunt and uncle --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and all of them, so.
L:  Very good.  So did you have family in Seattle?  What made you move to Seattle?
R:  No, um, just something new and I wanted to go --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- to college up here.  I'd --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- looked at, um, I initially went to a bible school 'cause that's sort of my background --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, then I just -- I really like it up here, it's really beautiful, so.
L:  Yeah, it is beautiful up there.  I've been up there several times and it is beautiful up there.  Only problem is is it's just like it is down here, it rains.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And rains and rains.  We went to a soccer game with my -- my daughter's out of town that has the five year old and -- [COUGH] to a seminar, she's at -- in [inaudible] and, ah, so the five year old had her first soccer game today, so we had to go to the soccer game, and it hailed, and it rained, 'til we were all just totally drenched --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but if you're familiar with soccer, soccer goes on no matter what.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And so consequently we played soccer in the rain --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- but it got so cold we thought we were going to freeze to death, but we survived the storm, so that was all that counted --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and come home and went and had pizza and got warmed up, and then come home and got warmed up by the fire, and the --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- jammies on and all that stuff, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So.  But I think, you know, family is really important.  I know with, like I say with my daughter that lives here that has the five year old, she's -- will get her bach- has just got her bachelor's degree at U of O and then she's going to go to Portland State for her Masters.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And so family's been real important to her to help with the baby --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and get through.  She's a divorced mom, so she's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- needed that extra help to, to get through with all her schooling and, you know, with somebody to watch the baby and whatnot, and she's grown -- she's not hardly a baby anymore, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- she goes to kindergarten, and so somebody has to be here when she gets off at noon, and you know, all that kind of stuff.  And even when she was littler, well my, my other daughter took a lot of care of her because she had the -- you know, she was available and she had the time to do it, and my other daughter, the daughter that's going to school needed to be gone at night 'cause she had night classes and she's always worked full time as well, so.
R:  Mm.
L:  So family was really important to her, that she have that, ah, to fall back on -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and kind of get her education, 'cause Lord always knows when you're -- she's like thirty, and when you're that age you need as much education as is all possible --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because getting a good job that pays you a long, long time good pay, if you don't have a pretty good college education anymore, that's really a hard thing to do.  It's possible, but it's a hard thing to do, so.
R:  Yeah.  It's a easier way in the end, but yeah, getting there is tough. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.  Right, yeah.
R:  I've gone through the same thing, 'cause I have a seventeen month old, and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, from the beginning his dad and I have been split up, and I guess that's a forced family or something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is the fact that he has a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- dad who's really involved in his life.  But we aren't together, and so we've had to work out, um, our custody situation and --
L:  Yep.  Well they haven't been together really either since she was born.  She -- they got a divorce -- or they were separated when she was pregnant, and she -- they were separated when she was born of course, and so they've never lived together since she's been born, and then they got their divorced -- I think she got her divorced about four years ago.  Not too long after Ty was born.  And um -- but he, for a while he wasn't really too much in her life, but since she's got a little bit bigger, well he's -- he's been pretty much in her life, and he -- much more than my daughter would like for him to be sometimes, but he has a girlfriend, he's from Turkey, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so his family is in Turkey, and of course I've never met them.  Heather, Heather went overseas to, to work one summer when she met him, so she has met his family, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- nobody else, none of the rest of my family has ever met his family, and probably never will.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, ah, but he has another girlfriend now that has a, ah, he has a little boy and girl by her, so Ty has a definite extended family, 'cause they're half brother and sister, but she tells everybody she has a brother and a sister, because she -- that's to her, that's her family.  I mean, she claims everybody as her family, 'cause we're big ones on calling everybody an aunt, you know, if it's somebody that's real close to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to my daughter, well that's her aunt, whoever.  So.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So she tells everybody she has a brother and sister even though they're really a half brother and sister.  And, and the girl that he's with is black, which is not a problem except that when you see this little boy, this little boy is black, and so it kinda confuses people when Ty says, I have a brother or sister and here comes this little black baby because they don't realise that, that it's not the same mother as her.  So -- [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, mm.
L:  -- she's saying, I have this brother, and it's not -- it's really just a half brother, so.  But it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a very, you know, at that age, at five, color has no boundaries, which color shouldn't have any boundaries --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but color has no boundaries at five, and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so she is really, it's really been interesting how she's gone through this process, and, and the baby, when the baby was born, the little girl was born, she had really her -- one side of her intestines didn't form and so it pressed her one lung up so she only had one lung, and --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- she had really massive massive problems, and she has only been out of the hospital -- she was born in November, and she's only been out of the hospital about a month.  So Ty was really excited when they finally brought her home, because she told everybody that she had a sister, and her sister was in the hospital, and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- she gave a -- kept everybody on an updated scale as to what was going on with her sister.  But it was -- it's her sister.  I mean, there's no --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- no doubt in her mind that that's her sister and her brother, so.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's good to be able to extend your family, you know, beyond your actual, actual realm, and I really do hope that as time progresses that they will always stay close, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but he's not a real, real sturdy person, so I don't know how long he'll be with this girl either, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, you know, hopefully he'll be with her, or be in touch with her long enough to where Ty will -- at least the kids will be old enough to where maybe they can stay in touch with each other on their own if their parents don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.  So because like I say she really thinks having that brother is really something special.  So.
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
L:  A family, like I say, is what you make of it.  It's just anybody can be your family, it just is one of them things that has to happen.
R:  Mhm.
L:  On your own.  How long has your roommate lived with you with her baby?
R:  Oh --
L:  Is it not her baby?
R:  Yeah, it's my baby.
L:  Oh, it's your baby.
R:  You know, she's just here as a friend.  She's been here, um, now almost two and a half years, I guess.
L:  Oh, so she was with you before the baby was born?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, well that's good.
R:  And yeah, of all people to have as your instant
