R:  Hi, my name is Marie.
L:  Hello, my name is Giana.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you too.
R:  And she wants to know what family means to us.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ah, family to me is happiness, ah, love, security, ah, just all the good things in life.
L:  Well, to me it's more or less the same.  It's, ah, unity, it's love, unconditional love --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- it's, um, happiness of course.  And it's just a sense of well being and, um, just all what is good is family to me.
R:  Yes.  I agree with that totally.  I would be probably lost without, without family and just being able to communicate and see my, ah, children and my grandchildren, and it's just -- it's very important, I think, ah, to -- to most people, I think it is.
L:  I think so too.
R:  Yes.
L:  I mean, family is, ah, it's even more than friends.
R:  Yes.
L:  And I like -- I like friends. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But family is, is just something -- is blood.  I mean, blood -- united, it's united, so.
R:  Yeah.  And for the holidays I don't think there's anything better than having family for the holiday --
L:  Oh, I agree.
R:  -- ah, because I know I have people at church that don't have family, and it's kinda sad, I think, ah, for the holidays when they don't have family close.
L:  I agree a hundred per cent.
R:  Yeah.
L:  This time in our lives, my husband and I are distant from our families --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and holidays is kind of -- is very hard, actually.
R:  Yes.  Well I have one daughter here and one in New York, and I'm in Kansas City, Missouri --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't know where you're at.
L:  Oklahoma.
R:  Oklahoma.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so I -- at least I have the one daughter here and that really, really helps a lot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think it would be tough when your kids grow up and they do move away.  I know it is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you don't have them close, where you can -- especially with grandchildren, you can spend time with them while they're growing up, and to just love and nurture them, and I think all children need grandparents.
L:  I agree with that too.
R:  Yes.
L:  That's, that's really true.
R:  Yes.  So now, I wonder how long we're supposed to talk here. [LAUGH]
L:  I have no idea. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is the first one I'm doing, so I don't know. [LAUGH] Have you done this often?
R:  Ah, no.  Well, I've been doing mystery shopping.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So this is kind of, ah, goes in, you know, with that, you know.  So, but, um, I am going to have my grandson this weekend, he is three, so he's a handful --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, so I'm usually wore out by the time he goes home.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That should keep you really busy, then.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yes.
L:  Did you have your grandkids for Easter?
R:  Ah, just the three year old.  I had -- ah, was with my sister and her husband, and, and her kids, and then of course my daughter here and the three year old.  My daughter in New York I don't get to see but maybe, mm, twice a year, and that's kinda tough.
L:  Yes, it's hard.
R:  My grandchildren there are growing up, and um, they're thirteen and fifteen, and they just grow up so fast when you don't get to spend time with them or see them.
L:  Yes, they do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause at that age, they're-- it just spurt.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just grow so fast.
R:  Yes.  So, but ah, I just think that -- of course I was raised as family being very important.  My grandmother had fourteen children.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  So it was just -- it was a big family get together on Sundays at dinner and everything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I was just kinda raised around that.
L:  Up to this day my, my sister and my brother who live in the same home town as my parents, they get together every weekend.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I mean, they're all grown up with families and --
R:  That's the way my grandparents --
L:  -- they all get together.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Every weekend.
R:  Uh-huh.  That's the way my grandparents, ah, when they were living, that's the way it was.  Um, it's not that way so much anymore --
L:  Right.
R:  -- 'cause my mother's passed away now.  But, ah, when she was living, well we used to go over there just about every weekend, the family all got together.
L:  Yeah.  It's just to hang out.  I mean, it's nothing special, just to hang out and --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I think times are changing, I don't know -- I don't-- ah, think the younger generations of the families are kind of getting away from that.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think they're miss --
L:  Everything is --
R:  I think they're missing out on a lot.
L:  I agree.  But life now is so busy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- between commuting and work, and --
R:  It is, yeah.
L:  -- trying to juggle the kids and work and all that stuff, it's just --
R:  Yeah.  Both parents working and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then the weekends come, you know, they have so many other things they have to get done before they go back to work again, so.
L:  And being away from the, from the grandparents too, that takes a lot --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- from the kids.
R:  It really does.  It does.
L:  Yeah, I think so too.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  'Cause I really enjoy being around my grandchildren.
L:  I know, and grandkids have so much to learn from the grandparents.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  I used to -- my grandparents are passed of course, but I just adore them.
R:  Well, you get so -- well, you get so attached to the grandkids --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- whenever they're around, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  It's -- and I just think it's important for them to relate that, ah, grandparent with part of their life and something that they'll remember.
L:  Yes.
R:  And doing and having fun with the grandparent, doing certain things.
L:  And to me family's more than just a -- the mother, the father, and the kid.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's more also the extended family, the grandparents and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- the uncles and aunts --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and all the cousins.  I grew up with all my cousins, and we had such a fun time --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- growing up, all my cousins.  And it was just fun.
R:  I, I, I agree, 'cause I did the same thing, and I'm not -- I don't -- you know, I hate to see the family kind of -- I think it's kind of going by the wayside, but I just don't think that the families interact as much with the cousins and the getting together and the playing -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- today as what they used to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The distance is the big factor nowadays too.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Well, the distance along with everybody being so busy working and everything.
L:  Yes.
R:  So.  Yeah.  Are you, ah -- did you get hit by that bad weather in Oklahoma?
L:  No, luckily for me was like, um, east of us, so.
R:  Oh, well good.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It wasn't that bad, it was just really windy and, and awful weather here, but it was nothing dangerous, so.
R:  Yeah.  It's been -- the wind's been blowing, it's been raining here.
L:  Yeah, same here.  Luckily for us we've been missing tornados.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So that's good.
R:  We had some hail today, though.
L:  Really?
R:  Hail, yes.  We did.
L:  We've just had a lot of rain.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It was pouring the whole day.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh dear.  Well, she can come back on the line now any time --
L:  I know. 
R:  -- I don't know what else we can say about our families. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I mean, when two strangers get on the line.
R:  How many children -- yeah, how many children do you have?
L:  I'm expecting my first.
R:  Oh, you are?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well good.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, good.
L:  Yeah, so.
R:  When, when is the baby due?
L:  December.
R:  Oh, well you got a ways to go.
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  My, ah, grandson that I keep, his birthday is December twenty third.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, more or less the date they gave me, so. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  So he was almost a Christmas baby. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, they've been telling me, this is going to be a Christmas baby, so. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, well it'll be exciting.
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, yeah.  It will be exciting.  Now, is your mother and father still living?
L:  Yes.  But they're -- they're far away, though.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, that's too bad.
L:  That's the sad part.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they'll be here for the birth.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I was in the delivery room --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- with, ah, my daughter whenever she had, um, my grandson, and it is, it's just -- it's really something to see.
L:  Yeah.  I need my mommy. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Even though you've had -- I've had children myself, it -- you don't -- it's just different to see your grandchild being born.
L:  Really?
R:  Oh, yeah.  It is.  And the -- you know, to hold them when they're -- yeah, it's just different.  Yeah.  And I got to cut the umbilical cord, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all of that.  And it just has -- it has special meaning.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think, you know.
L:  Yeah, it's like --
R:  You know.  Wow, I just wish you all the best, 'cause --
L:  Well, thank you so much.
R:  -- I just-- children, I just love children.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just absolutely love them.
L:  We love them too -- well, I love children, it's just that I didn't have any before. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, we were too busy before, and now we're ready.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  Yeah.  And we're excited too.
R:  So are you -- are you -- are you planning on -- how many children are you planning on having?
L:  Probably two.
R:  Two.  That's a good number.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't want one, but I don't want three or four 'cause that's too many.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I had two girls, so that was, you know, I'd like to have one of each, but I had two girls and I figured that was enough, I wasn't gonna keep trying until I had a boy or anything. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, that's what I keep telling my husband.  Whatever it comes, two is enough. [LAUGH]
R:  Two.  That's right.
L:  But he wants a boy.
R:  Yeah.  Oh yeah, they all do.
L:  Yeah, of course. [LAUGH]
R:  But to be able to afford them today, and um, you know, the cost of sending them to school and just clothing them --
L:  And daycare, my God.
R:  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  Daycare's outrageous.
L:  I know.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, you're better off, if you could afford it, to stay home until they get into school.
L:  Yeah.  Well, we're thinking about that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We'll have to see now, the economy's kind of iffy right now --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I don't know
