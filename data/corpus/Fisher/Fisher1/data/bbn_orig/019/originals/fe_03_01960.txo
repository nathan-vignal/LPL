L:  Hi. 
R:  Hi.
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  How are you?
R:  Okay.
L:  Good.  I am Dee.
R:  I'm Jude.
L:  And what's your name?
R:  Jude.
L:  Okay.  And you know I, I actually, I don't know what's wrong with the -- maybe there's something wrong with my phone or something, but I was having a problem hearing all --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- the, ah, the information that they were giving about the topic that we were to discuss.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I know it's something about scandals and, and corporate America or something?
R:  Yeah, um, business and the stock market and how --
L:  Enron. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, basically --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all of that.  Which is funny 'cause it's not in the slightest what I was expecting.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [LAUGH] Based on the other topics I've done on these phone calls, this one hit me from out of the blue.  I mean, I think it's terrible, I think it's terrible that there are -- that the way America has evolved is that there are these huge corporations with these guys who are doing awful stuff and hiding millions of dollars in foreign bank accounts and laundering money and, you know, insider trading, and there's all kinds of stuff going on, and --
L:  And getting away with it.
R:  And they're -- exactly.  And they're getting away with it.  And I don't necessarily believe the government should intervene in everything, but I think if nothing else is taking care of it, somebody needs to.
L:  Yeah.  I agree, and I -- one of the main things that I have a problem with is the fact that you've got these big corporate giants, you -- these people, I was reading the other day about all the money that a lot of the CE- -- CEOs are collecting --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, who are, ah, you know, caught up in the job reduction and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, work force reduction and so on.
R:  Right.
L:  And how they're -- some of them are getting -- most of them are getting millions of dollars and all that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I, and, and I'm not disagreeable with the fact that they're getting paid well, but my thing is that, um, you know, even with the, with the, as far as the scandals are concerned, is, ah, in many cases, you know, they, they already making big big big bucks --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then on top of that they're not satisfied with the money that they're making, and then they go out --
R:  Well, and in addition to that --
L:  -- and they pull these stunts like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then they give, you know if somebody is caught with, ah, you know, you've got a lot of people who -- you know, kids who are caught up in selling drugs and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and even adults.  And if they're caught with just a little bit of mar- marijuana --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they give them ten years, fifteen --
R:  Right.
L:  -- years.
R:  Right.
L:  And these people who are stealing millions of dollars --
R:  Yep, yep.
L:  -- ruining people's retire -- ruining people's futures, you know, when, when in the case of Enron and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- MCI and all that --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- I mean, they're people whose futures are literally just --
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  -- tossed to the wind.
R:  That's right.  Financially.
L:  That's what I have a problem with.  I, and I really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- think that they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- and I don't think that there's much difference between them and the, the guy -- the drug lords --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the people who are selling drugs --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and making big bucks.
R:  Well in general the government's priorities are off if, you know, if they're going after the little guys instead of starting from the top.  You know.  I mean, how many white collar criminals behind their desk who are embezzling small amounts of money wouldn't be happening if governments were monitoring corporations that were allowing corruption from the top.  If they got good ethical people in starting from the top going all the way down, they wouldn't be hiring guys who'd be able to get away with embezzling money, you know.
L:  Right, right.  And that's true.  That's very true.  And just recently --
R:  And the same thing like you said about the drug lords, you know, go after the, the big supplier guys, don't go after, you know, people who are small scale --
L:  The little guy on the street who's making --
R:  -- and on the street, and -- yeah.
L:  -- a few -- couple a hundred dollars a day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or even a thousand dollars a day.
R:  Go -- start from the top and you'll actually be able to address the problem.  Start -- start that small --
L:  Yeah, but you'll never address it, ah, completely --
R:  -- and you'll never be able to do it, yeah. 
L:  -- if, if you just go after -- if you start at the bottom.
R:  Yep, exactly. 
L:  The people who are at the bottom of the totem pole.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.  And, and that's what I say too.  So I, I think it's just --
R:  Well, and the other thing is --
L:  -- ridiculous.
R:  -- you know, you look at these guys, and it's so crazy how America -- how the whole ideal has changed.  It's funny, because I'm a teacher, and I was covering somebody else's class the other day, and they were discussing American ideology.  And looking at, ah, Walt Whitman, who lived in the eighteen hundreds and what was the ideology of the eighteen hundreds compared to now.  And the kids said now, everybody hates America who's not American, but everybody in America thinks we're great because we're totally selfish.  We're all about what do I want, what --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- can I get.  And that's exactly what's going on.  These guys are like, okay, you're not happy with the twenty four million dollars you already have, now wait a minute, you play -- you pay all of your employees, you know, poor Fred and his wife over there, you pay them seventeen thousand dollars a year, and you have twenty four million dollars and you're going to rip off all of your stock holders too, 'cause you don't think that's enough?  I mean, it's crazy.  It's got to -- it's gotten to be such great extremes.  These guys have so much money, and the employees are so poor, they are earning so little compared to the big guys, and the middle class is getting wiped out by these big corporations.
L:  And, you know, it almost makes you think about, well, it makes me think about the way it is -- the way it was in Iraq.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, with, ah, Saddam, [LAUGH] he was living like a -- well, he was literally a -- I mean, like a king.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, you know --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I heard about these, these -- all these -- you know, he drank from some, um, container that was made of gold -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- or something --
R:  Right.  Yeah, I know, I was reading about all of this insane stuff that they found in his palaces.
L:  All this extravagant stuff that he -- that he had.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Or that he used and all of that --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- and I just think that, it's just ridiculous.  I mean, it's, it's, it's awful.  I mean, we are in a sense not too much better, ah -- I mean, we have freedoms to do things, and we --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, we can work basically wherever we're qualified to work --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in most cases, and make money, and take the money and spend it the way we like for the most part, and, and we do have freedoms, and I'm glad to be in America, I'd rather be here than anywhere else in the world --
R:  Oh, definitely.  But I think most Americans abuse those freedoms.  They don't take the --
L:  Yeah, and, and the people --
R:  -- responsibility that comes along with it.  Like --
L:  And the people --
R:  Like --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  I was just gonna say, you know, like, like managing your, your company and paying your employees properly and making sure that, you know, the -- if you own a company and you have a bunch of people that work for you, you distribute the profits through your employees.  You provide profit sharing.  You send dividends to your investors.  You know, it's not all about how can I get rich and have a million other people doing the work so that I can jaunt around being rich.  You know, the responsibilities of being free need to be taken care of.
L:  Well to me, now, it seems like -- I mean, 'cause they're already rich.  I mean, if -- you can live very comfortably by going by the book as a CEO --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, very comfortably.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You can be rich.
R:  Yep.
L:  And if you're president of MCI --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- I mean, well not now, maybe -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but, when they were in their heyday --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- I mean, you could do very well.  I mean, you could have a very very comfortable life.  But the thing is, those people are not satisfied with just making that salary and getting all those other perks, and getting --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- stocks benefits and --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- profit sharing and all that.  They, they have to steal from their stock holders and all that in order to feel like they're really really -- I guess -- I think it's almost like a game.  I -- 'cause they can never spend all that money.
R:  Mhm, yep.
L:  I think it's like a game of -- I think it's kind of like with some of the celebrities and some of the other people who have a lot of money --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- I mean, my thing is, once you get, you know, a certain amount of money, every additional amount that you get, each marginal unit of --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- of dollars that you get --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- really ain't gonna make that much difference.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  What can you do with it?
R:  That's very true.
L:  You know, Oprah's a billionaire now, but I mean, what -- what can she do?  She'll never spend all that money.
R:  Yeah.  And you know, she, you know, she sells a book contract or, you know, does a part in a movie or something, and you read about a, you know, fourteen million dollar contract.  Oh yeah, like she needs another fourteen million dollars.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then, then, to make things even worse, they put these stupid shows on like Celebrity Who Wants To Be A Millionaire and Celebrity Jeopardy, and these celebrities are so rich that it wouldn't mean anything to them to win the petty, you know, a couple thousand dollars you can win on Jeopardy, so they play for charity.  Now, why don't you just get out of the way and let some American whose life would be changed by two thousand dollars stand in that spot and win the money?  You know --
L:  That's a very good point.
R:  -- charity's good and great and I like that, but you know, look at some of the charities these people pick, you know, like, like the Cat Spay and Neuter Society.  It's like, great, thank you, that money could of gone to some person who could of actually used money, instead of to your charity.  Charities should come later, after individuals are taken care of.
L:  And, and you know something else has just occurred -- well, occurred to me, I guess, in light of all the, the corporate, um, scandals that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- have occurred, you know, recently --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- is that I just -- I've just thought about this recently, that if they took all the money [LAUGH] or just a portion of some of the money that has been stolen by some of these corporate executives in some of these scandals recently --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and over, over the years, not necessarily just recently, 'cause there's no telling how much has been stolen --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that, that hasn't been discovered yet.  But you think about how many homeless people that would help and how many --
R:  Oh yeah, yeah.
L:  -- handicapped babies --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know, babies who have birth defects --
R:  Exactly, people who really --
L:  -- people who really --
R:  -- need the money.
L:  Yeah, who really do.  Like you were saying, who really do need the money, who a couple of hundred dollars will make a major difference, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  People who can't -- some older people who have a problem getting their medication --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- you know, think about how many -- how much that would drastically improve so -- the quality of so many people's lives.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If they would take a portion of that stolen -- [LAUGH] of, of that money and put it for a good -- toward a good cause --
R:  Yep.
