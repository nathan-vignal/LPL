R:  Oh, I'm from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
L:  Great, great.  Okay.  We're supposed to talk about family I suppose [LAUGH].  Have you done one of these calls before?  This is my first one. 
R:  Yeah, this is my first one.  Is this through the University of Pennsylvania?
L:  Right.
R:  Oh, okay, right.  Yeah, I went there.  My -- one of my friends sent me this information actually.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, there was an ad, ah, in one of the local papers about it and so I went on their website and signed up.  Ah, do you have a large family?
R:  Ah, no, not really.  Why, do you?
L:  Um, sort of, but not really.  Ah, immediate family is not large but, ah, my father was one of eleven children.  So I have -- 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- a lot of cousins. [LAUGH]
R:  That's a lot of kids.
L:  Lot -- lot of aunts and uncles but, well, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  A lot of them have passed on.
R:  We're a small family actually, just me and my brothers.
L:  Are you -- you and your brother? 
R:  Yeah, two brothers.
L:  Two brothers, okay.  I have one brother.  Um, are you married?
R:  No, I'm single.  I just graduated from college two years ago.
L:  Oh, okay, congratulations.  From -- from U Penn?   
R:  Yes.
L:  Great.  What -- what was your field of study?
R:  I was a business major and an English major.
L:  Oh, double major.  So what are you doing now?
R:  Right now I'm selling commercial real estate down in Center City, Philadelphia.
L:  Great.
R:  Well, what about you, are you married?
L:  Ah, I'm divorced.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I'm divorced, no children.
R:  No children.
L:  Um, and I work in the, ah, insurance and investment field, um, do annuities, long term care, life insurance, those kinds of things.
R:  Oh, all right.  I used to be a, um, stockbroker, you know, for a couple of years.
L:  Oh, really, okay.  So you've got your series seven licence.
R:  Right, and sixty six.
L:  Right, we call it sixty.
R:  I know.  You call it what?  
L:  We call it sixty three down here.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, the -- the sixty three and the sixty fives are now combined into the sixty six exam.
L:  Oh, really, okay.  I did not know that.
R:  At the-- yes, the uniform state law exam.
L:  Well, ah, what does family mean to you?
R:  Um, I guess just, you know, the people who you can always come back to no matter what, you know, what happens in your life because they're your blood and they have to kinda take you in.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] it's like unconditional love I suppose.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Yeah.  That's the way I feel too.  I -- I assume both your parents are still living?
R:  Oh, yes, both of them.
L:  Yeah, both of mine are too.  Do you have any grandparents that are still alive? 
R:  I have a grandfather who is still alive.  My grandmother just passed about two months ago.
L:  Oh, sorry to hear that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My condolences are with you.
R:  It was kind of a rough loss.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I've -- I've lost all my grandparents now, so -- 
R:  Oh, sorry about that.  How old are you?
L:  [inaudible] I'm -- I'm forty one. 
R:  Oh, okay, yeah, I'm only twenty four.
L:  Yeah, I know.  You make me sick. [LAUGH]
R:  What did you say?
L:  No, I was just kidding.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] I said you make -- you make me sick, but I was just kidding.
R:  Ah.  So what --
L:  The good news is I don't look forty one.  I look like I'm about thirty four so -- 
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  So -- 
R:  So what does family mean to you?
L:  Um, more or less the same thing.  I mean, I've -- I've always -- I've had a very positive experience family wise, you know, blood is thicker than water so to speak.  And -- 
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- sort of like you, you know, it's -- it's like when I had nobody else that I can talk to about something, I know that I can always call my brother or I can call my mom and dad or I can call an -- an aunt or a cousin and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and -- and just know that I'm going to have love and have, ah, an open ear and, um, you know, have that open line of communication that, you know, you really can't have with someone that's not part of your family.
R:  Sure.  You can pick your friends but you can't pick your family.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, you know.  Now, you know, I don't know if you're a religious man or not but I also think of family in terms of, ah, also my church family, you know.  Um, I -- I'm -- I'm really into -- into my church and so, you know, there's a lot of people there that I can confide in and so I get a lot of familiar -- familiar, is -- is that part of family?  I guess it is, that I can -- I can get sort of a sense of family from my church family too.
R:  What denomination are you?
L:  I'm Episcopalian. 
R:  Oh, all right, yeah, we're Roman Catholic.
L:  Okay, so we're -- we're cousins [LAUGH].  
R:  Yeah.  Religion is a big part of family too.
L:  Yeah, I think so, I think so, especially, ah, you know, you get together for the big, you know, traditional holiday things, you know, the Thanksgiving dinner, the Christmas deal, you know, all of that.  Um, you know, I have a lot of -- a lot of pleasant memories over the years in regards to --
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- to those types of things, yeah. 
R:  And religion is kind of a framework around which, you know, family can rotate once in a while.
L:  Oh, I think so for sure.  I think -- I think so for sure.  Um, you know, I'm -- I'm very grateful that I was raised in a Christian home and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  Um, you know, ah, had the -- those values instilled to me at an early age, you know.  It's -- it's sort of like served me well.
R:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm grateful for that too.  I'll definitely raise my children to be religious, you know, hopefully to be Catholics.
L:  Mhm, sure.
R:  Though depending on who I marry.
L:  Right, right.  There's always some consideration there, but yeah, I -- the way I look at it is as long as they, you know, believe in God the father, God the son and God the holy spirit, wherever they go to church, you know, that -- that's cool, you know in felicity and just talks about working out your own salvation, you know, with fear and trembling and, um, you know, whether you're -- whether you're Roman Catholic or Episcopalian or, you know, Pentecostal or whatever, you know, I -- I -- I think that's the main thing, is just, you know, having that good solid foundation of-- of, ah, the love of Christ.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and the love of -- the love of family.
R:  We're all part of God's family in a way.
L:  Exactly, absolutely.
R:  Go- God's children.
L:  That's right.  I mean, we're all part of the body of Christ, you know, so I think that's pretty cool.
R:  I mean, that's another family, the holy family, you know, Jesus, Mary, Joseph.
L:  Sure, absolutely, absolutely, and Joseph, you know, I mean, gosh, talking about a -- a guy who, ah, was being ridiculed, you know, because, I mean, he and Mary weren't married at the time and here she is pregnant, you know.  I mean, he had to have a lot of strength and a lot of courage to get through.
R:  Especially since there was some other man's baby.
L:  Right, [LAUGH] exactly.
R:  So to speak.
L:  Right, or, yeah, either way, yeah, exactly, you know.  Um, that -- that had to be -- there's no -- there's no question he should have been canonized for what he went through just to be there and kind [LAUGH] of coordinate things, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  That's -- that's what family does, you know, they help organize things for you and they're there when you're going through tough times.
L:  Sure, sure.  My mom and dad have been great, you know, every time I've needed something and, you know, I've always been pretty independent, you know.  I mean, when I was eighteen, man, I was gone.  You know, I was in college and stuff like -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  See you later kind of thing, you know, but -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so was I.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Eventually you come back.
L:  Oh, sure, absolutely, absolutely.
R:  Because you realize you don't know as much as you thought you did.
L:  Oh, you know, I was -- I was the smartest kid in Tennessee back then, you know, but -- [LAUGH] 
R:  Still are.
L:  But I -- I learned like you, I think I learned pretty quickly that I wasn't nearly as smart as I thought I was.  But -- 
R:  Didn't have the resources that you thought you would.
L:  No, not at all, not at all.  So -- so you live in Philadelphia? 
R:  Yes, I do.  I live out in, um, you know, little neighborhood in Grace Fairy[?] which is one of the neighborhoods here in Philadelphia.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's a nice -- nice little area, a lot of families around there.
L:  How far are you from, ah, King of Prussia? 
R:  Probably about forty minutes.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.
R:  Not too far.
L:  King of -- remind me-- it's been a while since I've been to Philly.  King of Prussia's kind of on the west side of the city.
R:  Right, yeah, north and west of the city.
L:  Okay.  But where are you in relation to the city?
R:  I'm in the city.
L:  You're in the city, okay.
R:  Right.
L:  Okay.
R:  I'm in, um, the south side, South Philly.
L:  Okay, okay.  It's been years since I've been up there.  I used to date a girl who, ah, went to Bren Mar as a matter of fact.
R:  Oh, no kidding, I did too.
L:  Really?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, when was that, many years ago though?
L:  Ah, yeah, it's been -- it's been several years for me.  Actually I-- I, ah, I don't want to say decades but it's been -- it's been a long time.  Um, but years ago, um, gosh, I waspa- --
