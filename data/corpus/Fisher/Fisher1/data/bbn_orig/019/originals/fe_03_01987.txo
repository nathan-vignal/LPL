L:  Donna Stajack[?] 
R:  Hi, Joe McCarthy.
L:  Hi, how are you doing? 
R:  Good, how about yourself? 
L:  Oh, just fine thank you.  A little surprised about the topic, [LAUGH] I wasn't too sure.  I couldn't hear it at first but -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Kind of a different -- 
L:  Yes, it was.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I guess I should say how it affects me.  I don't know, I think it affects me in, gosh, every way.  Um, all of the prices of things going up and I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, they -- let's just review -- review the topic basic.  The first thing they said was the illegal, ah, activity in business basically is what they said or -- 
L:  Mhm, I -- I do believe so.
R:  So, what would that involve, I mean, stealing or what? 
L:  [NOISE] To me I'm thinking they're talking probably about, like, Enron which I live close to.  I'm in Houston, I don't know where you're at but -- so to me that's my opinion on that part.  So if that's the case -- 
R:  So basically scandals -- scandals within companies, right.
L:  That's what I'm thinking.  I'm not positive, ah, I didn't receive, like, a pretty much a letter or email, you know, detailing everything that goes on with it.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  But I know in our -- you know, in our town, it's -- it's pretty big and to me, you know, it's just -- I know it's hurt a lot of people that -- that have been around me.
R:  I'm on the phone.
L:  Hurt their, you know, their pay checks and things like that.
R:  Yeah.  Well, [COUGH] I guess basically what I'm thinking is that -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if there's scandals in companies, all -- I don't know, [LAUGH] it's hard to say what I'm thinking but it's just first of all it's unbelievable how -- how people get away with that kind of thing.
L:  Oh, I agree there. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, how does it affect me?  How does it affect me?  I mean, personally it doesn't -- I don't -- I don't think it really affects me, it personally, but the economy I guess it would be, you know, all these people lose their jobs because there's a few people in a business that want to try to make themselves rich.  I guess in that way it would affect me.
L:  Well, true, yeah.  I mean, myself, no, I don't -- I don't really know anybody personally.  I know that -- you know, I've talked to other people that I've known, you know, other people which I guess you could say -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it has affected them to the effect well, one, they are unemployed which also hurts our economy ourselves.
R:  Right.
L:  So, and plus I -- I have known with -- with reading and things like that, that with the Enron scandal, oh, my gosh, that the money that they've lost, the people have, you know, built their things on 401K and -- and stocks and bonds and -- 
R:  And then they have nothing.
L:  Yeah, they're completely broke and that was their -- their whole life is involved around that.  I know if it was for me and if I had, you know, had a 401K and all of a sudden it went bankrupt and all my money was gone, I'd be terribly upset myself.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I guess I could say that's how it affects me I suppose.  I mean -- 
R:  Yeah, I was having trouble kee- keeping up with the, like, there was different things that the topic was about, others, like, how it affects you or I or did you catch the other parts of it? 
L:  Right.  Well, the economy, I know it -- it was hard to hear it myself here, so -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sometimes there's background noise here but I -- I believe they were saying -- I don't know how it affects your economy or how it affects you, or -- I suppose we're supposed to be continuing talking about, you know, our economy.  I mean, I don't know.  That's pretty much the only biggest thing I could think it would be, Enron, but I know there's a lot of other companies that are, you know, where the -- whether it be CEOs or somebody down below there that are taking advantage of the people. [NOISE]
R:  [COUGH] Well, like, what's another one, like, ah, like the, ah, McDonald's scandal, you know about that? 
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  With the Monopoly thing.
L:  Yes, definitely, yes, I cannot believe that. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, that affects people's trust, you know what I mean?
L:  Right, definitely.
R:  So, like, say, you are going to McDonald's and you think you're going to be eligible to win a car or a million dollars and -- and you go in and you do, you know, you do this for a year, you know what I mean, or whatever, I mean, whatever they run the thing for, a month, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- so you've been buying all their products and half the reason why you went in there was to try to win, you know, yeah, you're hungry but you -- you thought you had a chance to win something.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I understand.  My family was like -- my kids were like, "Please take us to McDonald's.  We can, you know, try to win this.  I need one more" [inaudible] my stepdaughter's, like, fifteen. 
R:  Right, yeah, I need the -- 
L:  "I need that one piece".
R:  -- "I need the railroad and I win a vehicle" or whatever.
L:  Park Place.  Yeah, "Just give me Park Place, that's all I need" or, you know, we were the same way, "Okay, okay, we'll go ahead and buy you this".  You know, you had to buy a certain amount of or a certain type of item.  We were the same way, we definitely went in and did that and, yeah, we were duped the whole way through.  That -- that definitely disappointed me.  Now they're wondering why they're, um, they're having problems.
R:  Yeah, well -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I will tell you right now, that -- that one affects me because I work for McDonald's. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, do you really?  [LAUGH]
R:  So -- so, you know what I mean, it -- it affects me personally because first of all it makes me look like I'm part, you know, I mean, obviously I'm not, but, I mean, it makes me, you know, I'm a McDonald's employee, I don't think people look at me like I'm a big thief or anything but maybe they think -- 
L:  Unless you were the person that -- that was part of, you know, that had the hand in the dealings of all that, I think you're probably okay there.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You might not think that, I can understand your point there, definitely.
R:  So, ah, you know -- 
L:  I mean, that had to be hard on you.
R:  Well, yeah, it was very disappointing, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and, you know, just recently we were running another, um, it's not Monopoly or anything but it's another game, you know what I mean? 
L:  Oh, are they?  I didn't know that.
R:  Where you can win -- where you can win stuff, you know, but I just wonder, I've had several people say, "Well, yeah, I don't think there's any prizes".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Just because, you know. [NOISE]
L:  And that hurts McDonald's, doesn't it?
R:  Well, it hurts McDonald's, it hurts -- 
L:  Your sales, I mean it hurts -- 
R:  -- well, it hurts your sales, it hurts -- it hurts the -- everybody that's connected with McDonald's.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I mean, well, we buy this and that from everybody else so if we're not selling quite as much or whatever, well then, you know what I mean, it affects them too, you know. 
L:  Well then, it's been a while 'cause I have to admit though I do kind of work, not work for McDonald's but I have done some secret shopper jobs for McDonald's.  Thank goodness you don't think -- remember my name [LAUGH] hopefully or where I live.  
R:  You actually were a shopper, you're -- you do that now?
L:  Yeah, I do that -- yeah, I do that now, yeah.  Oh, gosh, now, I wonder if I can't -- I don't really know you so I -- I guess it will be okay.  You know, I do the secret shopping for McDonald's.
R:  That's awesome, that's very interesting.
L:  Yeah, but I have not -- I know, isn't that strange?  But I've never really thought about that when I go to do the job, like, oh, look at this, oh, look at this company, you know, how it duped us, but to me, I don't think of McDonald's duping us, I think of a few people that have done that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- so really it hasn't affected me in that way, but that's where McDonald's itself, I imagine it's affected, you know, affected their business, that's what I'm saying.  I have been reading about it, I know their business has suffered, that's for sure, and, you know, they're not building as new -- as many, this is what I'm reading in the paper here now.
R:  Yeah, I read that stuff. 
L:  They're not building as many new or redoing McDonald's and things like that, so, but I do secret shopping for McDonald's.
R:  That's -- that is very interesting.
L:  Isn't that weird?  But as the economy, no, as for how their scandal has affected me, no.  I still pretty much, you know, after that I went a little leery, but I still, you know, went to McDonald's because my kids wanted a, you know, Big Mac. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I mean, most people don't go for those games and stuff but -- 
L:  But, um, you know, it's -- 
R:  I mean, what other scandals has there been?  I'm just trying to think of any.
L:  I -- I -- I'm sure there's tons. [LAUGH]
R:  We could talk about President Clinton, but I don't know if you want to go there. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] no kidding.  Hey, I voted for that guy.  What a fool, you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Goodness gracious, what did I do? 
R:  Well, [MN] government is business and that was definitely a scandal of sorts, you know.
L:  Yes -- yes, it was.  You're absolutely right but I do kind of feel bad for you if you're a McDonald's employee there, not -- not now though 'cause I imagine from what I can see, they've bounced back.
R:  Yeah, I think we've -- I think that the -- I think that the -- the shopping thing has kind of put everybody on their toes so to speak.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  I have -- have you noticed -- I mean, do you -- I guess -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Do you do the same stores or do you do different ones or -- 
L:  Oh, I do different ones all the time, yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  It depends.  I can only do them, like, once a month or once every two months.  I have probably done about six of them.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So it varies.  Like I said though, but I guess I'm lucky that I haven't really thought about the scandal any more.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  When I first heard about it, I was looking at all my pieces thinking, you know, I was duped, this is ridiculous but then I also thought, that wait a minute now, it wasn't the whole McDonald's company, it was just -- I think it was just two guys or two people or whatever. 
R:  Well, it was a separate -- it was a separate entity altogether.
L:  That's right, it was the people that were doing the business. 
R:  Yeah, they hired it out, yeah, they hired out another company that -- that basically handled the prizes and, you know, and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  All the packaging and all that and -- 
L:  Yeah, who didn't stop me.  Now, the Enron thing, like I said, the only reason that was affecting me is because Forino[?] is my town and watching people -- sorry, lose all their money, that -- that's the part that was affecting me.  That, you know, just watching people lose thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars.  I mean, I've heard about people saying, "Well, all my savings was in there and I had" you know -- 
R:  Right.
L:  "Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars" and, you know, tied up in all their stocks and things like that and the next thing they know -- 
R:  So, how do you -- how do you even trust -- I guess -- I guess to me the way it affects me the -- the most out of everything would be my trust for anybody that's in some kind of authority figure type thing, you know -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- like the upper executives or the people that were in charge of the [COUGH] pack- -- you know, the -- the prizes and that all that.
L:  Yeah, but it has power.  The economy makes -- they can do whatever they want to do.
R:  That's -- 
L:  That's hiring practices, you know, quite well.  I don't like that person, okay, he might be the most qualified or whatever, I just don't like that person so I'm sorry, you know, or you're fired because, you know, you don't think the way I do.  So that's the part that worries me about all this, it's --
