L:  Hi, I'm Lauren.
R:  Hi, I'm Cindy.
L:  Hi, Cindy.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  Good.
R:  Good.
L:  Um, let me just say this is the first time I'm doing this conversation.
R:  Oh, good 'cause it's the first time I am too so we should be good, right?
L:  Oh, right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And I have a cold so, um, and bear with -- bear with me if you can. [COUGH]
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  That's -- that's okay.
L:  So let's -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  What part of the world are you in? 
R:  I am in Illinois.
L:  Oh, right, I am in Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, wow, okay.
L:  Let's -- I guess we need to cover the topic of family.
R:  Yes, topic of family.  
L:  Top -- 
R:  What does the word family mean to you?
L:  Um, you -- I mean, are you thinking about this microcosmic, like -- like, in the large scale, what does family mean and, like, you know Hilary Clinton -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and it takes the thought of, you know, a village to --
R:  [NOISE] I think one of the things -- I -- I guess it's just the topic is families.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, if I would say what does the word family mean to you, I guess it's what does it -- what does it seem, you know, what does it come -- what comes to mind whenever you say family? 
L:  Got it, okay.  So, I mean, I think of family tree and my parents and my siblings.  I have one older brother and I think about a lot of stress and communication.
R:  Mhm, well, that's very strong, you only have one brother?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I have -- there's six of us.
L:  You're kidding?
R:  No.
L:  What number are you? 
R:  I'm number one.
L:  Oh, my. 
R:  And, um, I am forty two.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And my youngest is twenty four.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  So there's a -- a large variety there.
L:  How many -- how many of you have kids too so, how many like, grandkids or whatever around there? 
R:  No grandkids yet.
L:  None yet, okay.
R:  Well, um, I don't have any grandkids.
L:  No, no, I meant, like, how many of you out of your four --
R:  How many of the four? 
L:  Yeah, have kids.
R:  Um, let's see, I have one, my brother has one, my sister has three.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Two, one, so three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  There's eight and then, um, one -- my youngest brother is not married.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So are you a close family?
L:  Yeah, we actually are, um.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I fight really aggressively with my father and I'm learning as much stress as we have the more I need -- other people learn about their family units, and as horrible as I thought our relationship was, at times we are so very close family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, we, you know, a week doesn't go by where we don't talk to each other and we all -- my parents live in north Jersey.  My brother lives in central Jersey and I live in Philadelphia and a really wonderful thing happened.  My brother -- I have been in Philadelphia for graduate school and -- the past ten years.  My brother met someone in New York City whose parents are from about fifteen minutes from me.
R:  Wow.
L:  So whenever he does, like, family things, they're always down here.  It's wonderful.  Like, if he, you know, married somebody from another area, I think the family would have -- like, I would have fallen a little bit further outside the family unit.
R:  Right.
L:  But he has kept me close to the family and, ah, I -- I love that, I just think it's such a -- a special thing that I have extended family because of my brother like right close to home and it was such a coincidence.
R:  Right.
L:  And how about you, is everyone in Illinois? 
R:  No.
L:  Where -- where is everyone? 
R:  All of -- all of us are in Illinois and most of us are within at least an hour apart except one.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  When -- I have -- I have a -- I don't have a twin but I have sisters that are twins and one of the twins lives in Louisiana.
L:  Oh.
R:  She's the one that's the furthest away.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, we're a pretty close family.  Um, I talk to my parents at least once a week.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then, um, I -- I was real close to my -- to the next youngest brother.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's closest to me in age but over the past -- I'd say over the past five years we've drawn away from each other.
L:  Mm.
R:  And so we don't talk as much, and right now, my -- my baby brother who's the twenty four year old -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- is living with us.
L:  You're kidding? 
R:  He got a divorce last year.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, um, he didn't really have any place to go and my mom had taken in my youngest sister and -- and her son because she was having marriage problems.  Her husband was beating her and -- 
L:  Oh, my.
R:  So they're working at getting a divorce so he did- -- he didn't have any place else to go, so I told him we had an extra room.
L:  Oh.
R:  So we're -- we're pretty close with everything.  I have -- I have a sister that lives about a half hour from here that we're real close to.  Um, I can -- I can talk to her about anything and she can also talk to my husband about anything.
L:  I love that. [COUGH]
R:  And that's cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, because, um, and the sad part is that his parents are still alive and he has one sister but they are not a close family, never really been a close family even growing up.  And his sister is, ah, sixteen years apart from him.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, they talk maybe once in a while.
L:  Oh.
R:  So my family has taken him in.  My parents consider him a son and they don't consider him a bro- -- a son in law.
L:  Right.
R:  So that's kind of neat, you know, that -- and he accepts my family as that.  So it's real -- we're real close.  
L:  That's sweet.  It's sweet that he's taking in your younger brother as well as you are too, like, you all have to communicate and live together now.
R:  Right.  Yeah, and, um, so it's -- and it's good, you know.  He's got a -- a full-time job now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Here in town and -- and we live in Springfield.
L:  Okay.
R:  Springfield, we live in the capital city.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  [COUGH] But, um, he's got him a full time job and so he's trying to get on his feet and we're helping him out in that situation and so he can get some money up.  Um, and I think family is very -- 
L:  He's young too, twenty four is young.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Um, now, are you -- are you a church going person?
L:  I'm a synagogue going person.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, and my family is synagoguish, but I actually, since I've moved away from home, I came to Philadelphia actually to go to graduate school in Jewish education.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I joined a synagogue and I'm -- I'm thirty three but I joined about five years ago and it's very -- not so odd but it's -- it is a little bit odd for a single person under the age of forty to join a synagogue.  It's usually very family oriented.
R:  Wow.
L:  Um, so it's been -- it's been an interesting experience, like, um, you know, people invite me over for dinner sometimes and my -- my brother used to tease me, like, "Why are you going to synagogue"? 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, but it's -- it's a -- it's a way of, like, making a -- not family but community.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think that's -- that's equally indifferent and important because I think meeting community, you know, it's like this is the cold call.  You have a chance to be seen in a different light than all of your mis- -- all the stuff that you grew up with.  So I think -- I have different relationships with a lot of people who are older than I am, like in their fifties.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Who kind of mentor me or I wouldn't say they parent me but they have or get a perception of me which helps me kind of grow differently than my perception by my parents, I think that they have, you know.  And then I come home again and I'm talking about valuable relationships that I have with people of diverse ages, people who have children, young children and teenagers.  I think it has been, um, I guess, just a good way of meeting -- just that, meeting people at different life ages, um.  I got a new experience what they're -- how they feel with different parts of life, whether it's family issues for them or life cycle events, marriages or death or just hard work, and people losing jobs has been a huge topic of conversation.  I lost my job six months ago and I have been tempor- -- working temporary jobs and my brother who bought a house a year ago and just had a baby a few months ago, which has been a real wonderful thing, lost his job and, ah, you know, when I talk about my parents and I feel -- I feel very judged and I don't feel very supported and then I go out and I talk to people in the community and I'm like, "All right, this is a normal thing, it's a horrible thing right now --" 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but kind of normal".  So --" 
R:  And -- and the reason why I asked that was, you know, if you went to church or, um, because we -- we were pastors.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And, um, kind of -- kind of maybe a lot of people considered us strange pastors in the church world I guess and, um, we always taught -- 
L:  Who's -- who's we, you and your husband or in your family? 
R:  Well, actually my dad was a minister.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I am also a minister and my husband is a minister.
