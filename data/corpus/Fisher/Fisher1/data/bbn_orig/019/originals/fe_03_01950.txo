R:  Hello, my name is Lori.
L:  Hi, my name is Diane.
R:  Hi, Diane.  I guess we're talking about family and what it means to us.  Um, gosh, well, I guess that's a good one for me, I have three small kids, um, and, ah, I mean, since the kids came along I don't do anything for myself anymore, everything [LAUGH] is for them.  Um, do you have children?
L:  Um, no actually, no, but I'm -- I'm from kind of a large family, I have, ah, four sisters.
R:  Brothers and sisters, so.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's a good one for you --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- growing up were you real close and everything?
L:  Um, yeah, yeah.  Pretty much.  So, um, yeah.  A large family, and that was pretty much, you know, the, the family unit, I guess.
R:  Yeah.  Did you all go through the elementary school and the high school together and all of that.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, um, ah, I don't know, so are we just supposed to talk for however long? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I guess we're just talking about family, and you know, our experience and, um, I don't know.  When it comes to family outside of my immediate family, um, my family unit is very dysfunctional, and um, I, I have two half sisters and a half brother, and I never see them, I never talk to them, um, my mother and my step father are still alive, my biological father's passed away, um, and I just never talk to them.  We just have nothing in common and when we do get together every once in a while, [LAUGH] every three or four years, we are at a loss of what to talk about, and we get bored with each other thirty or forty minutes later.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  So your main family is your -- like your kids and --
R:  Exactly.  My husband and my kids, yeah.  I've got a, um, a seven year old boy, and I've got five year old twins, one boy and one girl.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  That should keep you pretty busy. [LAUGH]
R:  It does keep me busy. [LAUGH] Um, I used to -- when, when everybody was much smaller, when, when the oldest one was three and the little ones were just very young I worked full time, um, and then that became harder and harder as they got older, and you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- required more of me.  Um, so now I'm kind of staying at home with them right now, but I've got my little ones going into, ah, kindergarten --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- in the fall, so I'll get back to work.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- gosh.  To answer the question, they want to know what family means to us.  Um, I don't know, you start.  I've been rambling on. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um, well when I think of family I pretty much just think of them like my immediate family, you know, my mother and father [NOISE] and my sisters. [NOISE] Ah, I wasn't real close with like my relatives, like aunts and uncles and things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We just see them, see them rarely, so. [NOISE] So I guess for me it just means, you know, with my sisters I grew up with, and, and my parents.  Um, and I mean we're all, um, grown now so we're, we're away from home and all that, so do our own things.
R:  Do you still -- a lot of you still live in the same general area where it's easy to visit with each other?
L:  Um, actually I am the only one that does not.  I --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- ah -- yeah, my family is in Texas and I live in California, so.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in California also.  I guess maybe they matched us up because of the time zones.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I think that's how they do it.  So.
R:  Yeah.  Have you done this before?
L:  Um, no actually this is my first call. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I missed a call last night, but um.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, um --
R:  Well, I don't know, what does family mean to me.  Um, family -- I mean, those are my friends, my closest, my closest, um, closest people that I know are my family, and I would do anything and everything for my kids, and um, and my husband, um, and, ah, it's just, ah -- oh, I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  I guess you could say it's like the people that you can rely on no matter what.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  You're right, you're right.  Friends come and go, and you know, you have -- you general have really good friends, but it's still the family are the people that are always there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Always there.
L:  I mean, regardless of what you do or what you've done or --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- things like that.
R:  Yep.  Yep.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So.  Okay, well, let's see.  Um, I'm just trying to remember the instructions.  I, I remember them saying that, you know, when I -- as I started talking I had to ask you about your experience, but I guess I have.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, so -- and you've asked me.  So, let's see.  And they want us to keep going for five minutes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean ten minutes.  Ten minutes, right?
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, do you have brothers and sisters that -- that have family, or --
R:  Well, they're all in a different state, um, my two half sisters live in, um, Arizona, my half brother lives in New Hampshire.  My husband's, um, relatives all live here in California, and I would consider them my family before I would consider my biological family my family.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  Um, my, my husband has a brother and a sister, and they both have children that are close to the same age as ours, um, and they're not too far away, we can get to anybody's house within about an hour and a half, whether it's, you know, his brother, his sister, his father or his mother.  Um, they're all here in California.  Um, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- those are the people, besides my immediate family that live in this house, those are the people that I consider family.  I've got a cousin here, um, and a cousin -- a female cousin here and a female cousin back east in New Hampshire that make up the rest of my family.  I'm very close with those two gals --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, but, but that's it.  That's it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, like I said I -- my, ah, my mother had, ah brothers and sisters --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- she's kind of, she kind of, um, I guess they didn't get along, so she got -- she was kind of okay with a couple of them, but, but ah, she hasn't kept in touch --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and my dad's the same way, and I mean, I don't even know really his side of the family at all.  So.  So, um, yeah.  That's why for me it's more like I don't really consider my relatives [LAUGH] like part of my family, because they were never really a big part of my life.
R:  Yeah, that's just kind of the way you were brought up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, another, um, thing about my family out here in California, my husband and I and the kids were living in Arizona and I just had nobody there and he had nobody there, and I thought it was really, really important for my children to grow up with their cousins --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- because I had cousins when I was growing up, the two gals that I mentioned to you, and, and their brothers, and, um, some of my best memories, you know, doing some -- anything with my sister, my cousins, um, you know, some of my best memories.  And just to think that the kids weren't going to have any family to grow up with in Arizona made me want to move to California, just so that they'd have family to grow up with.
L:  Oh wow, so that's mainly why you moved here then?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  It is.  Um, just because there was nobody over there.  Nobody.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, um...
L:  Yeah, I remember we did -- I did visit my cousins more often when I was younger.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they lived at like -- well, we lived in Dallas and they lived in San Antonio, so it's like a five hour drive --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- didn't see them too often, maybe once a year or something.
R:  Yeah.  So you don't have a whole lot of memories with your cousins either?
L:  Ah, not --
R:  Not a lot.
L:  -- too much.  There's one particular, I guess, brother that she visited, I remember them mostly, 'cause she would visit him and we would -- we were kind of the same age, and -- me and some of my sisters, so.  So, um, I kind of -- that's really, they're the main ones that I remember.  So.  But we really haven't kept in touch or whatever.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what do you do now when you have a family gathering?  It's, it's you and your parents and maybe a brother or sister?  Or --
L:  Um, yeah.  It's my family, my sisters and like their boyfriends or husbands or whatever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So that's family.  And that's, ah -- actually none of my sisters have had kids yet or anything, so --
R:  Really?  Yeah?
L:  So, um, and it probably won't happen any time soon. [LAUGH]
R:  So you don't have a whole bunch of nieces and nephews running around?
L:  No.
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I don't -- my older sister, I don't think she even wants kids, so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, ah, my -- there's quite a big range between, like, my ah
