R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  
R:  Hey.  My name is Hank.
L:  Hello, I'm Beverly.
R:  Hi, Beverly.  Ah, this is my first time, so we're gonna have to talk about what did they say -- what family means to us?
L:  Right, about what the word family means.
R:  All right.  I'll let you start.  You sound like you're very verbal [LAUGH] to know what to do.
L:  Well, I've done this once before, so um, sometimes it's a little awkward going the full ten minutes, but --
R:  Oh [MN] --
L:  -- then they give you a little survey afterwards, but, um, family.  Hm.  Family to me, I would say means, um, [LIPSMACK] well, I have children, so I would have to say children.
R:  Sure.
L:  Um, children and husband.  Uh, [MN] being together, uh, doing things together, spending time together, um, [LIPSMACK] knowing each other.  Um, not like it is today where most families don't know, don't know who their mum and dad or who their kids really are 
R:  Or which mum or dad.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Um, I myself, I home school --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- my children.  And, um [LIPSMACK] I'm a stay at home mom, and I have been for about the last six years.
R:  Good for you.
L:  And I really like it.  Um, I really really enjoy it.  Yeah, it's difficult at times.  You know, I'm with the kids twenty four seven, but, they're my family --
R:  Well, yes.  [LAUGH]  
L:  You know, yeah, um, right, um, --
R:  They're yours, and they may depend on you, so that's -- that's a nice thing, 'cause I'm older generation, and our, you know, we grew up, mother stayed home and took care of the children.  Fathers were the breadwinners, but in the last twenty or thirty years, things have broadened and changed you know, and become so, oh, mobile.
L:  Right.
R:  That there is a value there of the mother being the primary influence during infancy and up to, you know, I guess, teenage or --
L:  Right.  
R:  -- lower teenage.
L:  Especially with boys, the father steps in about the young teen years.
R:  Yeah, you know, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, and then suddenly the mother is the pain.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Oh, "Mom don't let you do nothing" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, or, "Mom's scared that we're gonna get hurt", or, yeah then, yeah you're right, it does --
R:  Well yeah, mother's are very very protective and then there's this sort of slide for the young boy to go and identify with the male part of the family.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And there are so many families now that have no male -- I'm trying to think of the word -- [LIPSMACK] not idol, but no, influence --
L:  Model.
R:  -- you know, positive role model.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And getting back to the family, you know, family to me is the same as you.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Family is your wife or your parents or her parents and your children, and in my case, grandchildren, in the family unit.  But I think in a broader sense, it's also community.  Um, you know, your society, you talk about the family of man, or the family of man and woman.  It -- i- it can be a broader sense, it could be a religion.
L:  Right.  
R:  You know, your family.
L:  Right, right.  Yeah.
R:  Um, I'm just trying to think of different uses of the word family, because it could be 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it could be, as you said, a very inanimate, um, group, or it can be inanimate or philosophical.
L:  Right.  I --
R:  We belong to, you know, everybody belongs to the same family in the widest general sense.
L:  Right.  Now see, I belong to, um, [LIPSMACK] I belong to like a message board online.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I've known these people for three, four, some of them for three, four, five years --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and they're my online family.  We connect.
R:  You know, I've never done that, and uh, I use the computer a lot, but I've never tried that.
L:  Yeah, it's, it's neat.  Um, we've -- we've -- you know -- it's easier -- sometimes it's easier to explain something like that to someone that you don't have.  You know what I'm saying?  I mean -- I mean these people that I know are in New York and California and Texas and Florida --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I know somebody -- I'm in, I'm in Missouri.  I know three or four of them are from Missouri.
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  So it's easy, sometimes it's easier, um, we kind of use it as our counseling section, you know., um. [LAUGH]
R:  Well that's a, that's a 
L:  We don't have to go to therapy because we can, we can hash out all our problems online with our friends.
R:  Well now that's, that's a good idea, because you're getting a support group and also a very -- very experienced group.  
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  Maybe some of the people have gone through some of the things that you're -- you're questioning or you know, want to know about --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they can give you a different point of view, or at least an alternate point of view.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have a friend that um, I have a young teen daughter, um, and she has a daughter that is just getting out of teens, going into adulthood --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I look to her for a lot of advice, because she has gone through this.
R:  [LAUGH]  Sure, sure.
L:  Now, you know, my family now, my -- my -- my real family, my blood family, um, there's not a lot that are necessarily my age, or that are going through the same problems --
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  -- that I'm going through with my teens.  And so they are, they are really helpful, you know.
R:  Can I ask --
L:  It's, it's neat, people, you know sometimes people don't understand, I say, "You know, my online family", and they think oh, the weird thing --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they think, "Oh, you're not gonna go meet those people are you?"
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And I've met, actually a group of us got together last year and went to the Renaissance Festival in Kansas City, and there was people there from Missouri and from Indiana and from Iowa.
R:  Wow.
L:  And this year we're hoping to make it bigger, but we actually got to see each other and we knew that these weren't big old truck drivers, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This actually was the mother of the teenage girl who we were talking about, you know?
R:  It was all real.
L:  Right.  And I -- I just did the same thing again, I went to visit some relatives in K- -- it's amazing the people the meet that are so close to you or who have such similarities, how the internet makes the world so small.
R:  Oh, it does.
L:  You know, it's, your family, you can call, I can call my dad in California, and it makes the world a little smaller.  I can get online and I meet somebody that lives two hours away from me, and it makes the little -- world a little smaller --
R:  Sure it does, sure it does.
L:  -- you know.  And the girl that I had met, I met a girl online at my message board, we talk about family a lot on the board, and she was only fourteen.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  And so I set her up with my daughter to be pen pals.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  And I found out that she lives in Newton, Kansas, where I go to visit, three, four, five times a year.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  And so I was able to meet her here a couple months ago, and my daughter was able to meet her.  And so that was really neat, and it was -- it was kind of friendly 'cause the shoe was on the other foot, because when I met her, you know she's fourteen, her dad is -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- her dad was a minister, and so I met her at ch- -- at her church.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And at the time I'm thinking you know, "Why don't she give us her phone number and all?"  Well, she can't give me her phone number, she's only fourteen, she doesn't really know who I am.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  You know?  So, she had the protection of her family there, and that was really interesting.
R:  Well, yeah, you know I'll have to try that.  While you were talking, I was thinking about family.  I come from a very large family.  I had nine brothers and sisters.
L:  Wow.
R:  And so, -- I had, and my wife -- she was an only child.  But we had, through my siblings, ah, I was the youngest.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  So I had older sisters and older brothers, and so they went through a lot of the stages and things that we went through, you know, they'd already been through, and so I, -- you were talking to your online family, I guess I, -- well, we didn't have computers in those days.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So we were lucky in that we had enough of my brothers and sisters to talk to and say, you know, "What -- what do you do about this?"  And when my wife first became pregnant, she had never gone through it or had anyone that had gone through it, so my sisters were very valuable to her, and that's family.
L:  Right.  Her mom would have had her opinions from twenty some years before --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- whereas your sisters were right.
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  I have one sister and, -- but my mum and my dad came, -- well my mum came from a family of seven, my dad came from a family of four, but I was raised, born and raised in California.
R:  Ahah.
L:  And my mum had, -- mum and dad moved out here in about nineteen fifty six, and I was born in sixty six.  Well, all of my relatives still live back here in Kansas.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  So we would come visit maybe every four, five years, but I didn't have any quote family in California except for my mum, my dad and my sister.
R:  Oh, I see --
L:  So when --
R:  -- so you were really just growing up with one sibling?
L:  Right, right.  And then when I, when I got older, and here just about five years ago, we moved out here to the Midwest so that I could be around my family, and after I've been around them for four or five years, now I can understand why my dad moved from California.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  It's the patent -- place -- gossipy type thing, you know, --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- that most relatives that, -- that live close to each other that never move away, it's that type of environment, and I'm not used to that, you know?
R:  Well, California is so liquid and so, -- I say everything's on wheels.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  It's just -- the mobility of people here, -- I heard a, um, a television or maybe it was a radio commer-
