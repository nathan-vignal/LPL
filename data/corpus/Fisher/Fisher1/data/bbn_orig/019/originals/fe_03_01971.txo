L:  Hello? 
R:  Hello.
L:  Um, my name's Jeremy.
R:  Hi, Jeremy.  This is Sue.
L:  Hi, Sue.  Now, all right, I had problems trying to hear that recording.  Now, what, what are we supposed to be discussing?
R:  We're supposed to be talking about corporate scandals, um, and how it has affected you and what the government could do.  I had trouble hearing it as well.
L:  Let's see.  Corporate scandal.  Well, I think that first off corporate scandal is nothing but a whole bunch of rich people sitting there trying to make more money and stuff their pockets with money, stopping people like me who actually need money from having a chance to actually make money.  All they ever want to do is sit there and make more money and they don't care about us, all they -- they just sit there [SIGH] it's hard to explain.  Um, they'll hire on so many people, and then if these people don't do what they want them to do, they fire them and then have the few people that do work hard actually work more overtime, even though they don't get paid for overtime.
R:  Right.
L:  Do you know what I'm saying?
R:  Yep.
L:  And then they'll sit there and they'll hire on new people and do this over and over again, and they keep keeping -- they keep the people that actually work really hard to -- [SIGH]
R:  To drive down costs ultimately for them.
L:  Yes.  And they never actually offer any incentive or any reasons for these people to actually be working as hard as they are.
R:  Right.  It's cheaper for them to, um, pay one person overtime than to pay a second one benefits.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Has it ever directed affected you, the stock market?
L:  Directed affected me?  Ah, --
R:  Like in the stock market?
L:  No, I actually, ah, don't go into the stock market 'cause I'm a -- I, I am a spendaholic and I'm afraid that if I got --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- started in the stock market I would probably, like, make one good buy or -- and then sell it when it -- I made a profit off of it, and then I'd go crazy with a whole bunch of other stuff and I'd end up, like, really bankrupt.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So --
R:  It's affected us, not -- we don't directly deal in the stock market, but with 401K it has affected us.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, I don't know how much the government can really do.  I mean, they can do anything they really want to do, but I don't know what the right solution is to get the Martha Stewarts out of the area that they're in, but that's just all -- that's a lot of fudge factor, is what that is.  
L:  Now --
R:  You know, she had the inside scoop.
L:  The government probably could do something to try and change it and make it better.  But I think that the government is also sitting there reaping a huge profit off of the way it's going now, so why would they want to change it if they're getting what they want out of the system.
R:  Sure.  Yep.  They always do.
L:  The only time they ever actually go and seem like they're really trying to change something is if things aren't going the way they want to.  If they're not making the millions upon millions of dollars that they think they could make from this, then they will change it.  And until that happens, they're just going to leave it the way it is.  They say that they're gonna change it and they say they're gonna do this and they say they're gonna do that, but they never actually do anything.
R:  I know, and a lot of times when the government gets their hands in on it, it just makes a bigger mess.
L:  Mhm.  Because sometimes they actually do fix something, but more times than not, all they do is get the media involved, and they get people all hyped up about the issue, and then nothing changes.
R:  Right.  Yep.  I think, I think there are some, um, CEOs that have retired that's getting a bad rap, like the CEO from, um, GE that retired --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I saw on Hannidy[?] and Colms[?] where -- or the O'Reilly Factor or something where they were trying to give him a bad rap, um, but I think the guy did work hard and make them a very lot of money and should be compensated in his retirement.  I don't -- I don't see --
L:  Oh, well of course.  I mean, people like him that actually go out of their way and start from basically nothing and just work their way up and make the money that they make, and then they get slammed once it's time for them to actually retire, and they try and, like, just give them the shaft.
R:  Yep.
L:  I mean, there are those that work hard to get what they've got, and then once they have it, you know, others want to just try and take it away from them.  
R:  Yep.
L:  The people that actually work hard and make something out of themselves, everybody else feels like they owe them a free ride, even though this whole time they've been trying to do nothing but hold them down.
R:  Right.  Well, he, he gave up a lot of things because of all the, all the other issues in the media.  Um, from, you know what I saw and what I read in Fortune about it, but there are -- there are a lot of Martha Stewarts out there, you know.
L:  Yeah.  But there's not really much that -- well, let's see, what could the government do to actually try and change it?  The government could probably --
R:  Stiffer penalties.
L:  The government could probably, like, keep an eye on things and say, like, you know, you can't do this and you can't do that, but then if they did do that, all you would have -- you would have a whole bunch of people that are sitting there doing it illegally and trying to, you know, keep it out of the government's watch, and then they'd just end up pocketing the money and nobody would be the wiser.
R:  Right.
L:  So, the thing is, the -- probably the best things that the government could do, if they really wanted to, would be to try and, like, -- I guess, you know, go under cover in these businesses, send somebody in that they don't know is, you know, with the government and see how things are actually running inside of these big businesses.
R:  Yep.  To police the companies themselves.  Unfortunately that would be, you know, more tax dollars, but -- I don't know.  I know, I know it definitely has affected us due to 401K.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  To watch that go down every, every quarter is very disheartening.
L:  See, my wife is thinking about buying stock in her company 'cause she works for Blockbuster, but with the way that the stock market has been bouncing around a lot over the last year or two, she's not really sure if she wants to.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  'Cause the little bit of money that we do have that we could actually spare to put into that, we don't want to end up just losing because some companies do something really stupid and end up losing themselves a lot of money, taking away the little bit of money that we use just trying to make an extra couple of dollars.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, 'cause we, we try and, you know, do things right, and, you know, we're just trying to get by, and you know, sitting there working really hard, making -- barely making it by, and then if we actually invested in the stock market for, like, right now, you would think that the war would actually help the stock market and the economy, but every -- every month the economy has been -- or the unemployment rate has been getting worse since the war started.
R:  I couldn't see the war stimulating the economy in any way.
L:  Well --
R:  I think it's got a lot of people rightfully scared.
L:  During World War One, World War Two, and the Vietnam War, the economy did go up due to the fact that, you know, a lot of people got shipped across -- you know, overseas, and then those that were unemployed went and got jobs, henceforth creating, you know, less unemployment and, you know, just stimulating the economy because more people had more money to spend.  But right now, you know, all you've got is a whole bunch of, you know, college students sitting here running around protesting, and then you got people sitting there just getting into big debates over it, and then all of these big musicians or actors or actresses are sitting there spewing out their opinions which are, like, you know, causing them great problems over the whole ordeal.  So I just really don't know what to say about the war anymore.  You know.
R:  I've got an opinion on that, but that's a whole nother call.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] I -- and I -- I do think that made a difference in, um, you know, of course in the economy, but -- and, and ultimately that will affect the stock market and everything.  Um, I don't know if that will play any role into corporate scandal, while the cat's away the mouse will play so to speak, you know, you know, you never know what might crop up from that.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  Now, the thing is, I think that a lot of these people that are sitting here, you know, in the corporate scandal that are oh so rich, the main thing with them is the reason they never get caught is because they've been in it so long, they've got enough money to where they can pay these, you know, lawyers that charge like, you know, a half million dollars for, you know, one year's worth of work, and these guys are so well trained they know how to get these guys off the hook without ever actually having to do anything.  You know.
R:  Yeah, I think there's might be, um, smaller dogs doing the dirty work for them in, in some cases too.
L:  That's possible, you know.  All you have to do is find somebody that, you know, somebody smaller than you, and they'll do the dirty work, and then if anything ever goes wrong the lower guy is the one that gets in trouble, and then when they -- you know, even if they did say, hey look, this guy was, you know, paying me to do all this stuff, well how were they actually going to get the proof to track it back to him.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So you know, I just really don't know how they could actually go and, and catch these people.  It would be good if they could, but I, I just don't think it's any way possible for the government to actually get involved in that type of a
