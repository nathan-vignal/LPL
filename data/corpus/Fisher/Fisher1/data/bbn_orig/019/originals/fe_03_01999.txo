R:  I don't even know.  Something about -- I couldn't even hear.  Something about, uh --
L:   She said something --
R:  -- how the government can edge corporate, uh, some crap.  I didn't even hear it.
L:  Can you hold on for a second?
R:  Yeah.

R:  [LAUGH] This is pretty interesting.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I think --
R:  [LAUGH] How'd you hear about -- how did you hear about this thing?
L:  Um, I was on -- on a message board.
R:  Uh.
L:  And, um, they were -- somebody had -- I think somebody had listed a posting about it and so like all these people, you know, had signed up and stuff for it so I was like, "Okay, I'm going to sign up" and so they say, like, as soon as they signed up on line, you know, they got a confirmation, then they had got a call, you know, that night.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I did the same thing.  Uh, a guy -- I work for a web site called, uh, clan lighter[?].
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  Clan world network dot com?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, the guy know that I work with on there recommended me to it because he was in Pennsylvania -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he is going to study through PSU.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So he had me -- he gave me a link and said that you get paid for talking on the phone.
L:  Oh.  Yeah, well, like, sure, why not?  Um, well, so, I -- I guess I'll tell you a little bit ab- about myself.  I used to work at Enron until I got laid off in December and so -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, gee.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So I -- so I was there two years -- well, [MN] no, three years.  I was there three years because I went there right after graduate school and so, um, yeah, I didn't get laid off when they did that big layoff, um, you know, last year, but this year I guess that was my time and, uh -- 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I hear about that business a lot in the news.
L:  Yes, I know.  So, you know, I don't -- because I don't really know what's going on because I haven't even been looking in the news or looking in the newspaper regarding that company any more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Er, but I know, you know, there was a lot of people, you know, who did a lot of things that they shouldn't have and then a lot of them are, you know, they are going to get like a tap on the wrist -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, or, you know, there's not -- there's not going to be anything done with them, then all those people who lost their jobs, you know, they're like unemployed and the people at the top, you know, they're sitting pretty on their money and stuff, so, you know.  I --
R:  Yeah.  Uh, it -- it was insider stock trading or something like that, insider trading. 
L:  Aha, yeah.  It was that -- 
R:  Something like that.
L:  -- it was them spending a lot of money.
R:  Yes.  See -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- didn't the CEO run out with, like, a couple of billion?
L:  Yep.  Yep.  Mhm.  And then -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, like the -- like the -- like the bad thing about it was I remember when they had that -- that, um, stockholders meeting and, you know, they were telling everybody that everything is going to be okay, you know, and invest your money in stocks and all that and they knew, you know, all along that, you know -- 
R:  It was gone.
L:  Aha.
R:  Ha ha.  That's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- well, sounds -- doesn't sound like a very good meeting. [LAUGH]
L:  No, it sure doesn't.
R:  Did they give you shares in the company as, uh, sort of like extra benefits?
L:  Uh, yeah.
R:  For working there?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, shit.  
L:  And, um -- 
R:  That's not very good. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And see what -- what happened was I guess they must have been selling their stock, you know, when they knew it was going to be going down and they were trying to tell everybody else to buy more stock and they knew their stock, you know, was -- was worthless. 
R:  Yeah, drive up the price.
L:  Mhm.  Exactly.  I was like, "Man".
R:  Yeah.  Some nasty stuff.
L:  Yeah, it sure is.  So now I'm looking for another job.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] No, I'm still -- I'm -- I'm in school still.  I'm finishing up my last year.

L:  -- you know, just be prepared -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to talk and, you know, they said like everybody who they talked to and stuff was all, you know, nice and stuff.
R:  Yeah.  It's pretty interesting.  [MN] I guess it's kind of the same thing as the internet except over the phone.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.  Like I say, I had never -- 
R:  You can talk to people on line --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that you don't know and you get to talk to people on the telephone you don't know.
L:  Mhm.  Exactly.
R:  Pretty interesting.

R:  No, I never heard about it until he mentioned it to me.
L:  Oh, okay then.
R:  I don't think he heard about it until a few days ago.
L:  Oh, okay then.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I don't even know what the study's about, just about telephone habits or something like that.

L:  Man.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess that's like the open [MN] amusement park.

R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ebor City -- you ever heard of Ebor City in Tampa?
