R:  Hi.
L:  Hey.
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, hi, my name's Melissa.
R:  Hi -- hi, my name is Melanie, I'm in Los Angeles, California.
L:  I'm in Philadelphia.
R:  Okay, what does family mean to me. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Family means to me is to have, um, just basically people around you that love you, that care for you, that are always willing to help you.
L:  Yeah.  I don't really have much of a dissimilar view.  I, ah -- I don't know.  I mean, family to me means -- I mean, people who are gonna stick by you pretty much through --
R:  Thick and thin.
L:  -- thick and thin, yeah.  I mean, people who, like regardless of, of, um -- I mean, for instance, I mean a family would be to me somebody who, if my father, for instance, didn't really like homosexuals or interracial marriages, and I ended up doing one of those things, he would still, you know, love me.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  You know, like somebody --
R:  They love you unconditionally.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Basically they will love you unconditionally no matter what you do, whether you do right or whether you do wrong, they will stand by you and stick by your decision.
L:  Right.  Well, do you have a family?  I mean, like kids or a husband?
R:  Oh, yes, I do have two children.  I am divorced.  And I have, ah, two sisters.
L:  Two sister?
R:  Yes, I have two sisters, um, that live out here in California with me.  And as a matter of fact, we talk about sisters, um, I'm a teacher, my sister got me a job in her school. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow.  That -- yeah, that's family.  That really --
R:  You know what I'm saying, so we're, we're really, you know, we're really, really close --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as a matter of fact I just ate dinner with her, we're really, really close, I mean, we're older, I mean, we're not like, you know, teenagers.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um, it was really interesting because my mom died, um, five years ago, and on her deathbed -- we're three girls, my mom says, you wanna know something, I -- what want from you is before I die, that all three of you will always remain friends, 'cause there's nothing like having sisters.
L:  Oh.  That's really nice.
R:  So you want to know something, we're very, very close, you know, we see each other holidays and everything like that, we spend holidays together, we make sure we get together, and I do have family here, I have cousins that live in Los Angeles, but it's not like having a sister or a brother or a mother or a father, you know, nearby.
L:  Yeah.  Well that's it -- I don't have family near me at all. [LAUGH] I, um -- I upped and moved -- it had  nothing to do with my relationship with my family, I love my family.  My immediate family.  A lot of my, you know, extended family I could kind of live without, but, um, I moved up here from Florida, and I don't get to see many of my family that much, I have -- I'm twenty three years old.  And I don't --
R:  Okay, I'm double -- I'm a little bit more than double your age.
L:  [LAUGH] I don't really get to see -- I mean, I have a, I have a pretty good relationship with my siblings, we're not all that close, but they're a little bit younger than I am and I don't think they really developed a sense of that sort of thing yet.
R:  Well, you want to know something, when you have children and everything like that, just, just you have to say, you know, stick by your, you know, brothers, stick by your sisters, I'm very close with my daughter, family means a lot to us, you know, we --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- get together on holidays and everything like that --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- right now I'm in Los Angeles and my daughter goes to college down here, so --
L:  Oh, so she lives near you?
R:  Um, she lives, she lives down at, you know, at the college --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but you know what I'm saying, when she lived -- I didn't live near her when she did start college, and you want to know something, I used to fly her home for holidays --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, it's time to be with your family.  You know, there's time for friends.  Now, we do have like an extended family back in New York --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we know them for over fifty five years.  As a matter of fact I flew back to New York in, um, in, um, November, and she's seventy years old --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and she is like my second mother because I've known her ever since I was born, you know what I'm saying.
L:  Is it your mom's sister?
R:  No, she's not my -- no, she's not my mom, she's a good friend of the family for fifty five years --
L:  Oh, she's just -- oh, okay.
R:  -- for fifty five years she's a good friend of the family and she's like my mom.  She really is.  She's like my mom.
L:  Oh, no that's awesome that you -- I mean, you're close enough to her that you're willing to fly --
R:  Right.  I mean I don't --
L:  -- all the way to New York.
R:  -- call her Mom obviously, but I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I talk to her every week and everything like that just to make sure she's okay, she and her husband, I speak to her children.  We're like family.  They call -- yeah, they called my mother Aunt and everything like that.  You know.  So, um, you know, family is very important, I mean, you know what I'm saying, I mean, I got --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- divorced and moved to California, my sisters helped me out, so family is important.  I mean, friends are really great, I mean, I lived in New Jersey, had sisters out here in California, and it was nothing just like having your family close to you.  Like I had friends, really, really good friends, but there's certain things that you could tell your sisters that you just can't tell --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- even good friends.
L:  Yeah.  I wish I lived physically closer to my, my family, 'cause I don't really -- I can't -- I, I go to school and everything, so between school, ah, and the fact that I work all the time, and the fact that I'm poor, I don't really have the opportunity to go visit them very often, and ah, they don't -- they don't really like the city that much, so they don't really come visit me. [LAUGH] Which, I mean, I wish that would change, but a lot of it has to do with like my dad's panic attacks and stuff like that.
R:  What you need to do no matter what, you need to like put away, you know, save, instead of like eating out, you know, save --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and just money so that you can go and visit them, like surprise visits and stuff like that.  'Cause you don't have --
L:  Yeah, you know act- I did that.
R:  Like we just -- like we've just had holiday, family --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- means important -- is very important to my sister, her son goes to college down here, and as a surprise my brother in law sent my, my nephew home for the holidays.  And my sister almost fainted.  She goes, that was --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the best gift you could of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- possibly have given me.  
L:  Yeah.  That's -- I did -- my dad's fiftieth birthday was in October, and ah, I took a greyhound bus down to Florida [LAUGH] and, um, they were having a surprise party for him, and I snuck in, and he about collapsed.  It was, it was pretty fun, actually. [LAUGH]
R:  So, you know what I'm saying, I was in a very, very bad spiral last year with my sister that I had to stay with --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so it's important, it's really important --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- that you stay close with your immediate family.
L:  Well yeah, you're right.  I mean, if, if something happened to me in my house right now, I wouldn't --
R:  I mean, if I need anything, if I need anything financially, I mean, you know, you could ask a friend, but it's much better to have a family to go to ask them for help.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't, ah, really have anybody to go to.
R:  I mean, you're talking about thousands of dollars, you're not talking about I'll lend you a hundred, you know, something like that.  And that's why it's important that you stick together, you instill values, when you do have children, that family is important, you know what I'm saying.
L:  Mm.
R:  You always get together on holidays, you just get together, and my -- as my mother said, it doesn't have to be mother's day for me to -- for you to wish me a happy mother's day.  Every day should be mother's day.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  You're right.
R:  And she was right when she said -- when she said those kind of words.  Because, you know, a mother is a mother, you know, and that's it.
L:  Yeah.  See, you're really close to your mom when you were growing up.
R:  Well no, she passed away five years ago.
L:  I mean when you were growing up, you were very close.
R:  Yes, very close.
L:  What about your dad?
R:  Yeah, we had an extended family --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- with my grandparents, my aunt and uncle lived in the same house, we had three floors --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- to our house.  Yeah, we had this huge house.
L:  Wow.
R:  And all of us -- yeah, mhm, my grandparents had their own apartment, my aunt and uncle had their own apartment, and then we had the whole, um, upstairs and downstairs.  So I grew up with an extended family, my aunt lived three blocks away from us, and this is something that my children will never see because the closeness, you know, everybody moves to California, this one lives here, this one lives there --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- and they just will never experience something like this that we had growing up.  You know, your family --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of like, you know, like, you know, thirty people getting together and, you know, they -- you know, we get together as a family, you know, but like, not like we used to with, with aunts and uncles and --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- cousins --
L:  Yeah, I know what you mean.
R:  -- and everybody over the years have moved away.
L:  Yeah.  When I go visit my parents I rarely ever see any of -- even though they all live in Florida, I rarely ever see any of my aunts or uncles or cousins.
R:  Just remember, if you're ever in trouble or anything like that, it's your family that you would call, you know.
L:  Yeah.  That's another thing I think that's like, that just shows why the world is like it is now, 'cause so many people don't think that, and I mean, you know --
R:  That's right, they just lack the whole family values and friends are important and [inaudible] to party --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- on Sundays, on Sundays, every Sunday we used to take the bus, we used to go to my aunt's house growing up, okay?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Used to go take the bus, three buses to get there.
L:  Wow.
R:  Used to take three buses to go to my -- my mother would take us three girls on the bus, and we would go visit my aunt every Saturday, and kids nowadays are busy going to the mall, they're busy doing this, they're busy doing that --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- we had family day it was every Saturday in our house, and um, it's just -- yeah, family is not that important, everybody lives in different places, but even if you do live in far away places it's important to send cards, it's important to call --
L:  Oh, yeah.  I try to drop them a postcard, we talk, you know, we talk every few days, I just talked to my dad for about half an hour tonight.  
R:  And I am a school teacher so I do believe that family values are very important --
L:  Oh yeah, you probably see the, ah, you know, the effects of that sort of thing every day.
R:  Yeah, and I -- and obviously I have -- my children are from a broken home, so I do see, you know, the effects of divorce and everything --
L:  Mhm, right.
R:  -- like that.  That's why it's important to, you know, be a good role model for children --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and instill good values in them.  You know, family is important, and it's important to, you know, respect and everything like that your family.
L:  If you can't respect your family, how are you going to respect just the general public?
R:  'Cause you know a lot of these kids are -- they talk back to their family, ah, I don't have to listen to what my mother says --
L:  Oh, you're kidding --
R:  I'm old enough to make my own de-
L:  -- my, my parents would have slapped me in the mouth.  I mean, I did get slapped in the mouth for talking back.  I -- you know, that's just.  I don't know --
R:  But a lot of people grow up, they, they, um, they totally have nothing to do with their parents, they are resentful of certain things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that have happened early on in their live --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and [several inaudible words] mother's trying to guide you in the right direction and family is important.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I'm saying, because is the person that raised you and, you know, and that's that.
