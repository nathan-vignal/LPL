R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  I'm Mary.
L:  I'm Mary too. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, two Marys.
L:  Yeah, it's easy to remember, huh.
R:  Uh-huh.  I live in Minnesota. 
L:  Oh, I live in Wisconsin.
R:  Oh.  We're neighbors then. 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Um, I'm, ah fifty years old and my husband's ten years older than me and getting close to retirement --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and so that, um, the thing about the corporate scandals or ethics, you know, I think is really important, because it's affecting a lot of people, especially those that are close to retirement --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and in retirement. 
L:  Yeah, I think it's really important too.  I mean, you just can't -- if we don't trust in the system, you know, nobody wins, so I think it's very important.
R:  Yeah, and I'm just -- I'm just kind of afraid that George Bush or -- even though I voted for him, is that he is a big businessman, and I'm not really sure if he is willing to clamp down on, you know, those fraud and the things that have happened.  I mean, he was friends with Ken Lay, and I think Ken Lay was responsible for a lot of the things that were going on in Enron, but it doesn't seem that he's being held responsible.
L:  Hm.  I'm not familiar with him.  But, um, yeah, I believe you. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  The stuff that went on with Enron was -- was crazy, you know.  
R:  Do you, um, -- do you have any -- like, do you work for a big company or any company that has been in the news lately at all about any of the things that have been happening with --
L:  No.  Uh-huh.  Nothing about it really affects me personally.
R:  Okay.
L:  So.  It's just all theoretical.  But I can certainly relate to it, you know, I can imagine if you were working and lost everything you'd saved it would be, you know, catastrophic.
R:  Yeah.  Well, one of the reasons I kind of stay up on it too is I read the Wall Street Journal every day.
L:  Do you?
R:  And when you read the Wall Street Journal it's very alarming to see what's happening.
L:  Mm.
R:  One of the things lately is that, um, like, say several major airlines are on the -- teetering or already filed for bankruptcy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then you read that the tops -- the top level people, the executives --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- are writing in all kinds of protection for their own retirements, you know, and huge bonuses and huge retirements --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at the same time they're asking the lower people to take all these pay cuts --
L:  Mhm.  I have heard about that.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And it's just recently been happening with American Airline, even though -- I don't know if they're officially filed yet or not.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, so all the different unions that were involved were taking their votes, and the only one that hadn't really finished or had an opportunity to, to redo their vote was the flight attendants --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then when they -- they had heard that the top people had written in all these bonuses and retirement perks for themselves, so they redid their vote, and they voted, voted down to take the pay cut.  
L:  Mm.
R:  So the board pressured the president, who had -- the president, who had decided to push this through, you know, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for the pay raises for the top people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so now they've forced him out.
L:  Well that's good.
R:  Because of the stance of the flight attendants, and the other unions, you know, revolting to -- that they were not going to give any concessions if the people at the top were, you know, asking for these but yet going the opposite way on themselves.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so my husband and I just had a long discussion about this actually, before the phone call --
L:  Wow, that's weird.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You didn't know what the topic was gonna be?
R:  No.
L:  Wow. [LAUGH]
R:  And he -- he works for --
L:  You're ready to talk about it then.
R:  Yeah.  And he works for a major company, and they just had a meeting yesterday on business ethics, you know, so.
L:  Oh.
R:  He was just leaving for work and I said, oh, this phone call subject is business, you know, the ethnics and things going on.  But I mean, I really do feel that we need a president who's willing to get in there and say, we've gotta clean up this mess on Wall Street.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And it's not even so much just the big companies, when you're starting -- I mean, when you read the Wall Street Journal, you see all these things that are being looked into about cheating, like, even on the trading floor, and how people are getting information, and even though some of the people who are called specialists on the trading floor, they might be able to profit only by a few pennies because of their inside knowledge, when you multiply it times the number of share of stock that they sell --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, that they're -- everybody's getting their little cut of things.
L:  Sure, yeah.
R:  And all these things have been kind of known about, but nobody's really stepped up and said much about them, so they're -- it seems like they're checking into a lot more things now.
L:  Well that's good.  That's a beginning anyway.
R:  Yeah.  But every time you read about a new thing coming out, it shakes the stock market a little bit more --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- in my opinion.
L:  Yeah, it does.
R:  And it seems like, you know, it causes, you know, the overall values to drop.
L:  Mhm.  And --
R:  The company -- the company my --
L:  -- people --
R:  -- husband works for, the stock has gone from a high -- I was looking at a chart just a little while ago, from a high in nineteen ninety nine of sixty eight dollars.  Well, they're really happy because right now I think it was trading at nine dollars and something.
L:  Oh, jeez.  And I suppose you invested in that, hoping to --
R:  Um, not by choice.
L:  Not by choice.
R:  Only because it was part of, you know, the -- say they didn't have a match, they had, um, where they would give you employee stock options.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, you didn't -- you just took them because that's what they said that they would give you, so.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so you go from being on paper, you know, where the stock was worth almost seventy dollars, and the low, that it's been as low as four dollars.
L:  God.
R:  So it changes quite a bit.  And it's just -- I mean, it's something that of course you can say, well I got it for nothing, but it was part of your pay --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and, and you counted on it by saying, "Oh, this is what you'll have for retirement", and then all of a sudden it goes from what it was --
L:  Was his company involved in a scandal?
R:  Yes.
L:  It was?
R:  Yeah, his was one of the companies that was -- actually one of the ones that was one of the first ones involved in some scandals.
L:  Oh, boy. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  He still has his job, though, and he's -- plans to keep it? 
R:  Yeah, he still has his job, and they've had a lot of -- you know, like, it's, it's a worldwide company, so they've had announcements, you know, that they were reducing this many and this many.  I mean, they've done that routinely over the years, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it wasn't anything like the Enron.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, that, that was a huge scandal.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  That was.  And the whole thing kind of fell apart too there, you know.
R:  Yeah.  And I would like to believe that, you know, President Bush is a good enough person that he would be putting, putting good people in charge of making these decisions too -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, to oversee these boards and things, but it seems like some of the people that he's appointed have themself had problems from -- that have come out in their backgrounds.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, where they shouldn't really be sitting in positions to judge other -- leaders of other companies for the things that they're doing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because they themselves have had some shenanigans in the past.
L:  Yeah, well he -- President Bush himself had a little trouble I heard too, so.  You know.
R:  Yeah.  I'm not real sure of what, what his things were as far as financial dealings.
L:  I'm not exactly sure either, but they said he wasn't entirely, you know, clean. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  That he has done some thing that were suspect, so.
R:  Yeah, I mostly -- I've heard more of, of Chaney, you know, and his involvements with Halliberton[?] and, and things like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I, I try to pay attention to it, but it just seems, like, it's so overwhelming that there's so much -- you know, there's so much, um, questionable stuff -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, there is.
R:  -- that you just -- you don't know how to keep track of it all.
L:  No, you really don't.
R:  And I think that it's causing a lot of people that maybe have already retired and are looking at some things now and are saying, well maybe, maybe I shouldn't have retired.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  But then I guess if the more people that can move on they create an opening, then hopefully they could bring on a younger person --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, to employ another person.  So --
L:  Mm.
R:  I'll let you give a little more, 'cause I've been, I've been shooting off my opinion.
L:  Well [LAUGH] I'm not, you know, as knowledgeable as you are about the subject 'cause I don't read, ah, the paper every day, and I don't know, you know, it upsets me personally to think that all these things are going on, but I really don't know how it change -- you know, how to change it or, or what should be done.
R:  Yeah.  I felt that the union pressure on American Airlines was a good thing.  I've never really been one that has said, "I think that unions are so great" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I feel that that -- because they are organized they've been able to put pressure and, and cause something like that to be done.
L:  Yeah, that really -- that did work out well.  You're right.  That was a good thing.
R:  And my husband was kind of saying, well -- I mean, he's not in a union, but we could do the same thing.  "Well, how would you organize it?". "Well, just pass the word".  Well, I don't think it would be that easy --
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  -- you know, unless you have a network of, of say through email and communication to say that you were going to have a walk off the job to protest because the president of his company just got a huge, ah, bonus, you know, even though the company has lost money.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I mean, if you wanted to protest that as an individual, I suppose you could write a letter to the president of the company and, you know, and voice your opinion, but then you're also in a position where maybe you'd get fired because of it.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  Mhm.
R:  Or watched more closely.  But at least as a union you've got that protection of the whole group of you -- 
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- you know, standing up for something like that.  So.
L:  Yeah.  And it's official, they can vote and they have official results.  So, you know, --
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  That does work well.  But unfortunately not everyone has unions, you know, so.
R:  Yeah.  I think it's cutting deep into the fabric though, this cheating and -- I mean, if, if people are just not going to have any faith in our stock market, it's not only going to affect us as Americans, but as foreign investors too -- 
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- that are looking at this and saying, "Well we can put our money in other places where possibly we, we don't have to deal with all this corruption and" --
L:  Yeah, mhm.
R:  -- and all these investigations are not only
