R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, my name is Don, how are you?
L:  Good, how are you.  My name's Sue.
R:  Sue.  So, um, your opinions on corporate legality at this point of the game right now?
L:  Um, I, I couldn't understand what they were saying.  What were -- what were they saying?
R:  I, I think what she -- I had a problem with her accent as well.  Um, I think what they're looking for is, um, corporate ethics at this point of the game and how it's affected us.
L:  You mean like as far as Enron and those scandals and stuff?
R:  Those scandals, I would also probably assume like right now the big thing in the news would be, um, American Airlines, their employees are asked to be -- you know, take all these concessions --
L:  Right, take -- take --
R:  -- to keep them out of bankruptcy while they're giving away perks by the billions --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- to their management.
L:  Right.  Well I think that people like in Enron, and people like the CEO at American Airlines, I think they should all be, be held criminally responsible, really, because it is criminal acts that they're doing, and they're cheating their own people while they're putting money in their own pockets.
R:  Well, from my, from my region right here, um, US Airways is the number one employers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I'm, I'm watching US Airways as they begged with the county and they begged with the city to give them all these concessions to get them through bankruptcy court, and then they get right out of bankruptcy court and then they're going to end their leases and just terminate us.  You know, and then cost this region billions.
L:  Right, right.
R:  I find that, that action appalling.  And I think the government should just start going after these, these people.  That's ridiculous to go that far.
L:  No, I don't think they're doing enough to -- I don't think that they're making any statements about it, and that's why people keep doing it and getting away with it.
R:  And you know, and I mean the effect it has to be having on the economy.  I mean, Enron definitely tanked the stock market.
L:  Oh, definitely. [LAUGH] That affected --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- all of us.  I mean, not just -- I mean, the people that worked there, um, I have a little bit of an issue with people that worked there putting all their eggs into Enron.  You know, they say that -- I've always been advised never to, to put, you know, everything into one company, especially a company that you work for, so, you know, some of those people -- I have, I feel really bad for those people that had all their money in Enron, but I -- on the other hand I don't think that they should have had it all in Enron.  But they believed in the company and the company gave them reason --
R:  Yeah, they believed, they believed --
L:  -- to believe in them, so.  You know.
R:  And you know, if you work for them I would think that you should believe in the people that you work for, but that's, that's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- tragic.
L:  Right.  I mean, nobody could have anticipated anything like that happening.  I mean, in a big company like that you would never think that it could just go just like that, you know.  Same with the airlines.  I mean, well the airlines are a little bit different because they've suffered so much --
R:  Yeah, nine one one did do a little bit of harm to them, but I think the airlines had this coming a long time before hand.
L:  Yeah, me too.  Yeah, yeah.  They've been, ah, they kinda have a monopoly, the big airlines, you know, there's -- you know, there's only so many airlines to choose from, and they work in conjunction with one another, one lowers their fares the other one does --
R:  True, but you, you just can't -- I mean, even US Air, before their bankruptcy, they, they were still paying, um, ah, Michael Wolfe, their chairman, a huge amount for his retirement and severance pay and this that, whatever, knowing darn well that coming down the line, that they've just been, you know, fudging on their accounting systems to, you know, hold theirselves through.
L:  Right, right.  Yeah, I mean -- and you know, they've got to change some laws too, like ah, you know, some of those Enron people -- Enron people had mansions being built in -- I think Florida it was, and there's no law that -- that they can have that, you know.  There's no law that can take that away from them.  You know --
R:  Yeah, I don't, I don't begrudge anybody making money, I don't.
L:  Oh, I don't either.  I mean, if you earn your money and you -- you're entitled to bonuses I think you should get them, and I don't have anything against people becoming rich in corporate America, because that, that's the goal.  But to cheat other people on the way up there, you know, I --
R:  Yeah.  And, and there definitely should be some kind of a, you know, response from the government on this.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  More so than what they're doing, I would believe.
L:  Right, right.  Because they're really not doing anything.
R:  I mean --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- every time you hear someone who gets investigated now on Wall Street, basically they just get them for obstruction, being the lesser charge, you know --
L:  Right --
R:  -- well that's nothing.
L:  The ordinary people, like you or I, if we went out and, ah, robbed a house or something, it -- we'd probably be thrown in jail for longer than these guys are thrown in jail for, you know.
R:  Yeah.  White collar crime is much nicer than -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, and they have -- they have the money to fight it, they get the best lawyers, they have the money to do it, and -- you know let's face it.  If you have the money you can get out of it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, you can.
L:  'Cause you can buy, you can buy people to get you out of it.  And you know, then maybe they end up spending a little bit of time in federal prison, which is more like a hotel room, you know what I mean, [LAUGH] some of those federal prisons are, you know -- they say if you're gonna do a crime you might as well do a federal crime, because the federal prison system is a lot better than, you know, regular jail. [LAUGH]
R:  I, I've never realized exactly what those people at Enron were going through.  I mean, not necessarily Enron, but the people in Houston were going through because of the loss of Enron, until, you know, hear in Allegany County, Western Pennsylvania, we were going through -- we are going through --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, this US Air mess, and I mean, they have laid off over forty per cent of their workers here in Pittsburgh, they've -- um, it, it's just become, you know, insurmountable at this point of the game, that if county doesn't just beg and borrow to, to do everything they can to keep them, they're just going to walk away and just care nothing, even though like three months ago we were the number one supporters of them to get them through bankruptcy.
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know, so I, I see what, what corporate greed and, um, you know, their actions can do.  'Cause they really don't care about us. [LAUGH] They've made that clear.
L:  No.  When it comes right down to it, they really don't.  I mean --
R:  No, they, they don't care about this county, and you know, this county has made them the number one employer in the county and now they're just cutting back, and they -- they're ready to walk out on us.
L:  Yep.
R:  And leaving the rest of us county payers with I believe six hundred and some million dollars worth of debt on that airport we did for them.
L:  Yep.  Yeah, and -- my husband works for a company that just recently came out of bankruptcy, and -- you know, and luckily they came out of it.  I mean, a lot of companies never do, you know, unless -- unless they get help from the government, you know.  I mean, I don't understand the priorities [NOISE] the government puts on bailing people out of certain things.  You know.  I could see them wanting to bail the airlines out to a point, they -- they kinda have to, you have to have the air traffic --
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  -- you know.  But um, I don't know, I just --
R:  And that opens up a whole new can of worms then, because everybody's going to pretty much feel that their industry deserves just as much credibility.
L:  Right, right.  Yeah, I live in Rhode Island and we went -- um, we had that terrible nightclub fire here --
R:  Yes, the nightclub fire.
L:  -- you know.  And, ah, they, they were turned down any federal help at all, just -- and they were just looking for help to pay the rescue workers the overtime that it cost, you know, stuff like that.  And, ah, they turned them down and they appealed it and they turned it down -- they just turned it down again yesterday.  You know, so -- you know.  And that, that was not a lot of money, you know, that really would of helped the state a lot that needed it, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, there was [NOISE] --
R:  Where the airlines, I mean, that was billions that they asked for in government guarantees.
L:  Right, right. [NOISE]
R:  And I mean billions.
L:  I don't know.  I just don't know whether [NOISE] -- could you hold on one second?  Hello?  Hello?  Hold on.  I'm sorry.
R:  That's all right.
L:  Jeff.  Yeah, I don't, I don't know what about corporate America, I don't know where it's headed, I don't know if there's any -- would be any huge companies left that are, that are honest companies.
R:  You know, I think it would probably do a whole lot more for the industry, the, the consumer confidence and everything if they could actually just prosecute one person and, you know, see it through to fruition.  That the American people could actually see, like well at least they're trying to do something, they got somebody --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, you hear about all these people that they take in, but then you never hear anything else.  No, put them on Court TV, let's see the whole thing go through. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't have problems putting the ordinary people on Court TV.
R:  Yeah, I mean, it's not like I'm going for a public flogging, but I mean, you know, show us the whole thing.  Let's, you know, get somebody.
L:  Yep. [LAUGH] So, um, I don't know.  I guess -- I don't know what you -- what else to say about corporate America.
R:  Ah, well, like you said, you just had a husband company come out of bankruptcy and, ah, I've had our largest employer in our area come -- come out of it, and they're still prepared to walk away. [LAUGH] With government guarantees.
L:  Yeah.  Well, sometimes it's not enough too.  You know.
R:  Um --
L:  Sometimes it's just not enough that, that it's not going to do -- it's just not going to -- it may help like in the short term, but in the long term it's gonna end up the same way, you know.
R:  They, they've already reduced their services, um, they're going to be different no matter what.  That US Air that you know up in your area's going to be different. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I mean, they're going to have to do something because there's not going to be any airlines left.  I mean, it's only a matter of time before the other ones are going to have to do the same thing.
R:  Well, I mean, if every airline right now is getting concessions to go into bankruptcy --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, why would the healthy ones not do it.
L:  Right.
R:  And I --
L:  I mean, I --
R:  -- and I'm sure a lot, a lot of that is -- a lot of that has to do with some of those union contracts, because I mean, you know, the airlines were getting union contract after union contract every time.
L:  Right.
R:  And I mean, I'm sure some of them were accepted.
L:  Oh yeah, sure.
R:  So it's not like I can blame management on everything.  But I, I'm a firm believer that if management
