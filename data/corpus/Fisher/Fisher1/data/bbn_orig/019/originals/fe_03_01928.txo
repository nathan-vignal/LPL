R:  Hello, my name is Valerie.
L:  Hi, Valerie, my name is Lou, how are you?
R:  Okay.  How are you?
L:  Well, I'm fine, just sitting here, having, just finished having dinner with my family, as a matter of fact.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, okay. [MN] 
L:  How many children do you have, Valerie?
R:  I have two.  I have a son twenty eight and a daughter sixteen.
L:  Oh, I have a son, sixteen and a daughter who is fifteen.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have two grandkids, too. [MN] 
L:  Really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with your twenty eight year old, I, I, I'm assuming --
R:  Yes, yes, thank God.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Are they in the same state that you're in? 
R:  Yes.
L:  That's nice.  Do you get to spend very much time with your kids?
R:  Yes.
L:  [MN]
R:  Do you, are your children, do they go to the same school?
L:  Well, not yet, um, one of them, I home schooled my children through the sixth grade.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  And then --
R:  I never knew anyone who did that.  
L:  I loved it, I would do it again --
R:  Um.
L:  -- in a heartbeat, it was really a lot of -- ah, well, it was just a good opportunity for me to, to be able to know what my children were learning, and, and just to be able to spend time with them.  But when they went, when, when my son was, it was time for him to go, or, when he was turning thirteen and getting ready to go to seventh grade, I really wasn't equipped to teach him at home any more, so he went to a private school --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  And -- and then he's a, a football player and a baseball player and he wanted to play five -- eight ball, so he ended up going to public school when he was a ninth grader, and she, ah, when he was in ninth grade was in, ah, turning seventh grade, so she went to the same private he did.  But next year, they're going to be at the same school.  He'll be a senior and she'll be a sophomore.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Yeah, it's really, um, -- and actually, the reason we did that was to, um, to let her enjoy -- and she's also an athlete, so she'll be playing, ah, varsity soccer. They could be at the same school, and enjoy each other playing, and, ah, they're very close.  So it's, it's, I'm, I'm happy that she'll be at the same school with him.
R:  That's nice. My daughter is, ah, my daughter played softball up until a couple of years ago, she played, I guess, from the time she was six till she was fourteen.
L:  Is that right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Why did she quit?
R:  [SIGH] Because all of the people who were managing the girls' teams moved out of the neighborhood, and nobody took it over -- it was really sad.
L:  Oh. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Now did you, ah, [MN] did you play, is that how she got interested in? --
R:  No, I didn't play at all.  I never played any sports.  Um, [MN] I had, I had a friend, and, ah, they put fliers through the neighborhood and my girlfriend was getting her granddaughter into it, and she told me about it, so we walked them up and signed them up for it that first year, just for -- you know, something for them to do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then she liked it and she was good at it and she got a lot of trophies, and she got, ah, best defensive player, she was good.
L:  Really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then she quit?
R:  Yeah --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- well -- 
L:  -- was there no other way that she could have found--
R:  She could have done it in school but she kind of lost interest, she didn't want to play in school, I think it was kind of the neighborhood thing, and then a lot of the players weren't around any more, you know, the neighborhood changed, so --
L:  Right.
R:  You know, she didn't really want to do it in school, and the only option she had, which I paid for her to sign up, was to play baseball, and she would have been the only girl -- 
L:  Well -- 
R:  -- and then a lot of people told me not to let her do it cause she was going to get hurt --
L:  Well --
R:  -- playing with the boys, so, I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just put an end to it.  
L:  But, but --
R:  I was sad 'cause I used to like to go see her play.
L:  Oh, I know, that's, that's what I, I really am going to miss when my son is gone.  [MN] It, it really is a wonderful opportunity to, to go and watch them perform and, not only that, but all their buddies that they've basically grown up with -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- are still on the same team.
R:  That's --
L:  I mean, that's really fun! 
R:  -- that happened with her, but, ah, most of the girls she was on the team with moved out of the neighborhoods, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it was just a bad situation.
L:  Right.  So is --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- she involved in anything else at school?
R:  No, not really. She works.
L:  Oh.
R:  She works, um, in a supermarket, she'll be the- -- matter of fact, she'll be there a year next month.
L:  Well, that's being involved.
R:  Mm. [LAUGH] 
L:  You'd rather have them be involved than --  
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- something, whether it's work, or a band, or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or, ah --
R:  She was --
L:  And, and then, what do you do?  Do you, are you [MN] employed outside your home?
R:  Oh, yeah, [MN] oh, yeah, I've been on my job thirty three years.
L:  Is that right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  What kind of profession are you in?
R:  I'm a voluntary service specialist.  I work at the VA hospital.  Um, what, what -- we, ah, recruit volunteers and interview 'em and place them throughout the hospital, and then we also work -- we're part of the public affairs department, so we have to, like, try to get celebrities, or [MN], ah, politicians, to come in, and visit with the patients, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] like, we're having our volunteer luncheon next Friday -- it's a recognition ceremony for all of them.  It's interesting.  [COUGH] 
L:  Oh, I bet it is.  How'd you get into that line of work?
R:  Well, I had -- when I came -- when I first started there it was six years I worked in the steno pool which was, like, transcribing medical --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then, for twenty three years I was the secretary in the lab, ah, but I, I didn't have college, so I did other things to try to beef up my resume --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so I could -- so I ran for, um, what was I? -- first I was the secretary, then I was the vice president of the employees' association, and I became an EEO counselor and I was also a girl scout leader.  So all of that gave me some experience, like, um, you know, planning trips and giving parties and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- things, so, when this job became vacant I put in for it, and I was, you know, got the job.  So I --
L:  That's fine.
R:  -- and I've been in it for about five years.
L:  Well, congratulations.
R:  Thank you ! [MN] 
L:  Spe- speaking of college, did your son go to college?
R:  No.  That's a whole 'nother story. [LAUGH]  
L:  Oh, well -- 
R:  My son --
L:  -- that's boys.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, my son did not go to college.  He works at a [SIGH] place where they make, you know, bay and bow windows.
L:  Okay.
R:  And he's just, ah, I think he put in to be, um, in the, in the roofers' union --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- so -- 'cause they're building, um, two stadiums here, two new, um, sports stadiums.
L:  You know, I don't know if it's worthwhile to ask where we're from.
R:  Well, I'm from Philadelphia.
L:  Okay. Well, I'm from Texas.
R:  Oh, are you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.  So he's, so he, is he a roofer?
R:  No, but he's got a friend, you know how they do --
L:  Right.
R:  He's got a friend whose father is something in the roofers' union, that's how it works here --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you know, with the trade unions, you have to know somebody.
L:  Right.
R:  So, hopefully, um, the frie- -- the friend's father might get him on as a roofer.
L:  Well, what about your daughter?  Does she want to go to college?
R:  Mhm, yeah, she wants to be a chef, a pastry chef.
L:  How fun, they've got --
R:  And we have a -- 
L:  -- like, chefs' school.
R:  Well, they have one right here in Philadelphia.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, it's called the restaurant school.  And it's close to, it's, it's close to my job, and close to where we live --
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  -- so, that's --
L:  Are you married?
R:  I'm divorced.  I've been divorced for a year, but I was separated since ninety, but I was married for --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- in sixty nine.
L:  Well, is their dad involved with their lives?  I mean, did you --
R:  Not really.  He started --
L:  You had to virtually raise them on your own?
R:  Yeah.  Oh, well, let me see, when I left my son was fifteen but my daughter was two --
L:  Oh, God --
R:  -- and I was forty, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  --  I started all over again.   
L:  Oh, God.  You are thirty eight when you had her?
R:  Thirty seven, yeah.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  I can't even imagine.
R:  Mm. I couldn't either, let me tell you ! [LAUGH] [COUGH] 
L:  Well, ah -- you know, though, I, I'll have to say, that, um, when I was about that age, I really wanted another baby again, and even to -- and my husband was six years older than I, and we were kind of late in life to have babies, after the two he didn't want another one, but I did talk to the doctor about it and he said, you know, that that age, that thirty seven, thirty eight years old, is when women, he sees more patients coming in and expressing the same desire to have another baby.
R:  Is that true? 
L:  Yeah, and he, he said it's because of, just, you know, su- subconsciously, wo- women, I guess are thoughtful of the fact that their biological clock is ticking down, and I would have had another one, but I would have been about thirty seven, thirty eight when I'd had it --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- and now, in retrospectively -- you know, I'm real glad that --
R:  It's a lot, um, it's a lot, well, we didn't plan her birth, I was using that, um, what was it, the today sponge, that was out --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- and, ah, I didn't believe it, you know, the doctor said "you're pregnant" I'm like, [MN] you know, it's a false positive, you know -- 
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- do it again, and she said, no, no, you're pregnant.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] Because we weren't getting along that well then.
L:  [MN] 
R:  But, ah, oh, she's a treasure to me now.
L:  Yes.  You see, isn't that amazing, you, you, you think at the time "Oh, my gosh, I can't, I don't know if I can go through with this", but then, she's sixteen now and you look at her, and can you imagine life without her?
R:  [MN] Oh, no.  Especially, I had to, ah, take care of my grandmother.  She died in December --
L:  Oh, I'm sorry.
R:  -- oh, yeah.  But, um, she had, she was like, you know, just thriving up until she was about, mm, eighty eight, 'cause she was ninety two when she died.
L:  Isn't that something?
R:  Mhm. So, for four years, you know, she got progressively worse, and she was living by herself in an apartment and first I had to take her into my apartment, but I had a third floor apartment, so then I had to buy a house --
L:  Mm.
R:  --  to bring her with me, and if it hadn't been for my daughter, I --  you know, helping me with her care, I
