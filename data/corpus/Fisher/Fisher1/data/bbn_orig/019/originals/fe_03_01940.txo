L:  Hi? 
R:  Hello? 
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, Ruffea[?].  What's your name? 
L:  I'm Mary.  Wh- what was your name again? 
R:  Ruffea. 
L:  Ruffea? 
R:  Yeah, everyone calls me Ross -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- so that's a little bit easier.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- I live in Minnesota.
R:  Oh, wow.  I live in Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I didn't know there were gonna to be people from this far away, so that's interesting.
L:  Yeah, and the topic is family.
R:  Yes, and I guess what does family mean to me?  Um, [LIPSMACK] well, I have a very small family --  
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so it's somewhat different [LAUGH] than I'm sure a lot of other people.
L:  Are you a parent? 
R:  Um, no I'm not --  
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I'm not a parent [LAUGH] not yet at least.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, but I have a small -- well, now I have a family, I'm married now, so that's my -- my own little family. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But before I got married my family was myself, my mother and my sister.  My father passed away --  
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  -- so, for me family was a lot of women [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, well that's nice.
R:  [LAUGH] They talk -- they talk a lot together --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, it's kinda different.  How about yourself? 
L:  Well, I'm from a family with four children.
R:  You have four children?
L:  And -- no, I only -- I only have one daughter.
R:  Okay.
L:  And she's, um, twenty eight.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And it's my second marriage and then my husband has three sons from his marriage too from his first marriage --  
R:  Oh, you have an extended family?
L:  Yeah, and then my mother, I always tell people about her because she's from a family of fourteen children.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  So, I mean that's really a huge family.
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  I can't imagine what that was like, but I hear the stories, you know, from her sisters and them talking about what the days were like back then and they lived in a four bedroom house and ... 
R:  Fourteen -- 
L:  Yeah, fourteen chil- --
R:  -- fourteen children --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and two p- -- sixteen people total?
L:  Yeah, and there was eleven girls and three boys.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  But what family means to me is I think about her family and, you know, they have a lot of, um, get togethers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Every -- every year they have a standing thing for Thanksgiving where they hold it in a church basement because there's so many people --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  So, there's usually, you know, it probably varies from one hundred and fifty to two hundred, you know, on a good year, but --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 'Cause --
R:  That's amazing.
L:  -- all the nieces and nephews -- well, th- they can come, come in -- if they can't come they don't feel bad -- 
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and they'll try to come the next year.
R:  Because I guess you get lost in the maze of --  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- of so many people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  And there's varying degrees with those people in the family.  I mean, there's some that don't come, have never come --  
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- because they live -- well, they use that for an excuse, they live out of state or even when they live closer they didn't come they just don't care about it -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, and then there's certain ones that are diehards and they love it, but -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and my daughter being an only child, because I didn't get married until she was actually in her teens.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think she feels kind of cheated sometimes, you know, because she was the only child.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, like, "Where's the rest of my family?" -- 
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  -- you know, [LAUGH] maybe you know what I mean when I say that.
R:  [LAUGH] I do, I do.  It's -- it's so interesting because --  
L:  [NOISE].
R:  Now that I'm -- I'm married my husband, um, he has a kind of a typical family like a mother and a father and brother and aunts -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and uncles and nieces and nephews and all these people, so this past year was the first time that I've actually been to a Thanksgiving dinner or a Christmas dinner with a bunch of people who were related --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, it was so change for me, I was like, "Oh, my gosh this is great", [LAUGH] like, -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, --  
L:  [MN]  
R:  -- just really amazing and so, someone just recently -- it's my birthday today actually --  
L:  Oh, happy birthday [LAUGH].
R:  -- thank you and -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I got a card in the mail that said, you know, "Happy birthday to my niece" and I was, like, "Whose niece am I?" 
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But I was like, "Oh, my gosh, it's great, now I have like a big normal family".
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because all my mother's relatives passed away, so.
L:  I think it can be real comforting especially when there's times when, um, like right now I'm helping out a lady who has cancer --  
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and she really has been very independent, she's in her seventies but hasn't really had to rely much on anybody for any help.
R:  Right.
L:  And all of a sudden she needs a lot of help because she's, you know, getting chemo, and --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she just needs somebody there and I thought this is when the times when family and friends are really -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- important, you know, you hate to say that but you -- you need it --  
R:  Yeah, it's true --  
L:  -- you have need.
R:  And she doesn't have family or friends in the area -- obviously you're helping her out a lot --  
L:  Well, she has a son that lives, um, you know, within ten miles but another son that lives in another state.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, it makes it really hard.  I mean our society now is people live all over and people lose track of their family ties.
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- and it's really -- I think it's difficult, you know, cause you have to go where you can for a job and --  
R:  Yeah, yeah.  It's -- it's kinda of interesting -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- people used to stay in the same areas as their family all it the time, kinda year after year and year -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and so, um, you know, my -- my new family, you know, they all live in Pennsylvania area and one -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- after I started, you know, dating him, got married I realized I wanted to be closer interstate where all these new people who were my new family were.
L:  Yeah, you wouldn't want to be away from them? 
R:  Yeah.  So, we picked up everything and left our jobs in New York and moved back to Pennsylvania.
L:  [LIPSMACK] oh, wow.
R:  So, it's been great though, [NOISE] it's definitely been great, you know, it's a new experience for me, um, but it's definitely been worth it, you know --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm glad that I get a chance to have like kinda of a pseudo grandmother now and --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uncles and aunts, which is really kinda neat.  So, I love it [LAUGH] [MN] --  
L:  Well that's -- that's good because then you've got your, um, what do they call it when you have your network, you know, there's your, um, support group or whatever -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you want to call it and then there might be times when you say, "Oh, I" -- well, I live -- I grew up in a small town and it seemed like my relatives were always around keeping an eye on everything I did.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] The good things and the -- 
L:  Growing up --
R:  -- and the bad things.
L:  Yeah, and if it wasn't a relative, somebody knew, you know, my family or knew --
R:  Right.   
L:  -- my relatives, so.
R:  Do you -- do you live -- did you grow up in Minnesota?
L:  Yeah, I grew up in Minnesota in a small town, but I live now in a -- in the Twin Cities.
R:  Oh, okay.  Where did you grow up? 
L:  I grew up in a little town of Fairbolt[?] --  
R:  Fairbolt. 
L:  -- Minnesota.   
R:  Which part of Minnesota? 
L:  Um, it was about an hour south of the Twin Cities, so --  
R:  Okay.   
L:  -- about an hour north of the Idaho border.
R:  I use -- I used to travel a lot to Minnesota for work.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So, I love it out there.
L:  Was towns did you travel in? 
R:  Um, the Twin Cities mostly --  
L:  Okay.
R:  -- back and forth there, but there was a small town in southern Minnesota -- oh, my gosh, I'm trying to remember the name --  
L:  Ohatana[?] 
R:  What is it called?
L:  Ohatana.
R:  No, it's really tiny.  Back when I used go there and this was in the late eighties the telephone numbers were two numbers though.
L:  Oh, wow [LAUGH].
R:  Um, and I -- oh, the high schools' colors were purple and white and it was -- and I can't remember, but it was just like a small kind of farming community and there is a lake there, and --  
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- everyone knew each other there was as general store, so, I have always, you know, looked back on those times like really fondly because everyone knew each other, you know, --  
L:  Yeah my town was bigger than that, it was sixteen thousand, so.
R:  Oh, okay [LAUGH]. 
L:  So, it had -- but I know what the little towns are like.  I think, you know, sometimes growing up in those kind of towns the family really sticks around.   
R:  Yeah.
L:  Especially if there's enough -- enough, um, farm or whatever their kids are gonna to do to keep em busy, but a lot of times, you know, like if there is more than one son or daughter there's not enough to make a living off of one farm, so.
R:  Right, right and it seems like a lot of people, you know, stuck around if they did go to college, you know, at the University of Minnesota they would come back and work in the town or work on the farm so, it was a kind of a nice atmosphere --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, the family that I would go out there with, one of my friends from high school, you know, everyone knew that, you know, this family would come in during the summers, so it was kind of nice like everyone would get together and, you know, have picnics and things like, which was great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I love Minnesota.
L:  [LIPSMACK] but talking about families again, I feel sometimes like, well, that huge family is my mother's family --  
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- you know, it's -- it's not really my family.
R:  Really?
L:  Well, because it's -- I mean my family should be my mum and dad and my brothers and sister --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, but none of my brothers or sisters like to come to that big family get together.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  No, they just don't feel comfortable there, but --  
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and I'm the only one that really goes --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and I don't go every year either, but --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- my daughter and I we kinda get a kick out of it, we think it's neat that it's a tradition that just keeps going and, you know, we -- we feel like, well, if we're around --  
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- then we'll go to it, but if -- like say she lives in Atlanta --  
R:  Oh, wow [NOISE]  
L:  -- so, if I want to be -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- visiting in Atlanta then I don't feel bad if I miss the Thanksgiving.
R:  Mhm [NOISE] because at least you're with her? 
L:  Right.
R:  Which is nice, and --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- she have her own family yet, or?
L:  She? 
R:  [MN]  
L:  No, she's single, she's --  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- she's not married, so.
R:  [MN]  
L:  She's twenty eight.
R:  Oh, okay so --  
L:  And I keep hoping that she'll find somebody, but.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] she travels every week for her job and --  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and -- and I mean I guess when I was younger I thought, oh, it would be great if my daughter grows up to be a career women --  
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and that's what she is now and so now I keep thinking, well she had better find somebody [LAUGH].
R:  Right [LAUGH] and that -- that's kind of the nice thing that I discovered when I kind of, you know, changed everything in my life.  Now I have a lot more time to focus on family, before when I was so involved with my career, you know, I never took vacations, now I feel like I want to be around the people that I'm related to and I want to have children and I want to settle down, like I -- I want to get to know the people that I'm related to distance related to, you know, more so than when I was so busy --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- doing a ton of other things and I feel like I missed out on a -- on a lot kinda being away from everyone and kinda being so busy with work --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, you know, I think my focus has really changed more so.
L:  What's -- what's your age? 
R:  I'm --
