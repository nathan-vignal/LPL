L:  Hi, my name's Danny.
R:  Hi, I'm Richard.  Are you there?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, yeah, this is, ah, the first time I enrolled so I'm just a little new.
L:  Oh, yeah, this is my first time also.
R:  Oh, great.  Um, so we have to discuss, ah, the topic of what a family means.
L:  Yeah, what -- what family means.  So, I mean, I -- what do you -- what do you think family means? 
R:  Well, um, that's, ah, an interesting topic because I'm Mormon.
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  Yeah, and so the family could -- family is real important and, like -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the families, like, the -- your bottom line in what [inaudible] with me, what defines my rules and how I conduct myself throughout my day and throughout my life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I, ah, wasn't born Mormon.  I -- I chose it just because of its stand on the family, and so I think what -- when I see someone who's having problems in life or doing well in life, I always credit the family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Negatively or positively.
L:  Right.  Well --
R:  So, I'm sorry, go ahead.
L:  Oh, I was going to -- were you -- are you -- were you an only child or do you have brothers and sisters? 
R:  Yes, I was an only child, yes.
L:  Yeah, me too, I'm an only child.
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  Yes.
R:  And see, I'm an -- an adopted only child so my parents had to, like, apply and -- and had to, ah, get references to become a family to have a child.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  How old were you when you were adopted? 
R:  Two months old.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] And it's interesting that you're also an only child.
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  Because I think that kind of shapes who -- your birth -- birth order or if you don't have any brothers or sisters kind of shapes you too in what you do in life and how you -- how you look at the world.
L:  Oh, yeah.  My roommates are always telling me I'm an only child and I'm -- I'm spoiled to -- to no avail but I disagree.  I'm not spoiled, I'm just, you know, I'm used to being an only child.
R:  Well, that's interesting because, um, my friends always say that my strengths and my weaknesses are because I'm an only child.
L:  Right.
R:  It was, like, [NOISE] I was spoiled at home but I was also taught manners outside the home.
L:  Right.
R:  So I wasn't -- I was not allowed to act spoiled outside the home.
L:  Right.
R:  Like, I had to conduct myself appropriately in other people's homes and I had to conduct myself appropriately at school.  I couldn't get away with murder.
L:  Oh, exactly.
R:  Whereas at home, of course, I was the only one that mom and dad had to worry about so they didn't have the pressures that, you know, I have a friend who came from a big family so there's just fewer pressures -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when there's just one child.
L:  Right.
R:  But I am used to -- like, when I see friends, I -- I see my friends like one at a time.  I don't like crowds, I don't like groups because I was always alone.
L:  Right.
R:  So I, um, it's very easy for me to even now as I'm older, it's easy for me to entertain myself.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I don't get bored easily because I'm always used to, you know, I'm not lonely but I've -- you know, when you're -- when you're a child, you're growing up alone 'cause you don't have brothers and sisters to entertain you.
L:  Exactly.  Oh, yeah, I can -- I can entertain myself for hours without -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- without anyone else.
R:  Oh, yeah, and people think I'm lonely and I'm just, you know, happy 'cause I'm not lonely at all.
L:  Mhm, right.
R:  I don't -- I don't need -- I don't need outside things although I have a lot of friends.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't -- I don't have to have them to -- to not be lonely, you know.  And it sounds like you feel the same way.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely.  I mean, and I can -- I mean, I'm also -- it -- it also kind of developed me into being more shy than everyone else.
R:  Okay, me too.
L:  You know, because you don't -- you don't interact with, you know, a whole lot of other -- I mean, you go to school, you know, when you're little and you play with all your classmates.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you're still -- you're still not, you know, going to sleep next to, you know, your brother every night, you know.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And, you know, it makes you somewhat more shy than -- 
R:  I would agree.
L:  -- than, you know, someone -- than someone that comes from, you know, a family where they had, you know, two sisters and three brothers.
R:  That I would agree, but -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I had to work harder at having self confidence.
L:  Right.
R:  Because I was always -- yeah, it did make me a little shyer because when I went to college for the first time, you know, I had a roommate and I had to deal with the dorm and I had to deal with a big group of other -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- guys and that took me a while to adjust to.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because I had never had to adjust to other people.
L:  Right.
R:  Because my -- it was just my -- my parents with me so I didn't have to -- it took me a while to adjust to a group of people so -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- I totally, totally agree with you.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, -- I went from living, you know, just me and mom to going to having, you know, a roommate at college and I'm still in college now but I have -- I mean, I live in a house now.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, but, yeah, I mean, I did the dorm all that, and I moved, like, three states away and went [NOISE] -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and went -- went to a school where I didn't know anyone at all.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  And that was -- it was quite a change and I go to the largest university in the country of course, so -- 
R:  Ohio? 
L:  I mean, -- no, no, no, no, Texas.
R:  Really?
L:  Texas, yes.
R:  All right.
L:  So technically we're the -- we're larger than Ohio because we -- we don't count our, ah, part time students.
R:  Okay.
L:  And they -- and they count part time students when they -- for their enrollment.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  So technically we're the largest.
R:  Wow, I did not know that.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it's not a thing to brag about because, I mean, our classes are huge.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  It gets kind of bad but, yeah, I mean, I came here and didn't know a single person when I got here.
R:  [NOISE] Wow.
L:  But it worked out to where I met, you know, some really cool kids and it worked out real well.
R:  I just did the opposite.  I stayed in State and I went to a small Lutheran college 'cause I -- I didn't think I could cope like you did.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I thought I would be -- 
L:  It was hard.
R:  Because of being an only child I thought I would be overwhelmed and that I wouldn't be able to, you know, I would just be overwhelmed with it all.
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  So for me I made the right choice 'cause it was a smaller school and it was in State, it wasn't right in the same city but it wasn't that far away from my parents.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah, and I did okay because [COUGH] because of that fact, I think I knew myself well enough that [NOISE] if I'd gone, you know, to a big school, I would have just been I think swallowed up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that for me was, um, [NOISE] the negative part about being an only child.  But it -- I really have stayed all my life with my parents' values.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I've always not done anything really, really stupid because I didn't want to -- my parents were always very important to me in my life.
L:  Right.
R:  And I -- I -- you know, I didn't want to ever do anything too dumb that would disgrace them too much.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I think my family is probably the most -- the strongest pull on my -- every aspect of my life.
L:  Yeah, oh, yeah, definitely for me too.
R:  But it sounds like I was growing up more -- I was overprotected whereas you maybe were given more freedom.
L:  Oh, oh, I mean, well, yeah, -- to an extent, you know.
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  I mean, it was -- I mean, I went to, ah, the -- I went to a, um, an episcopal school, like, middle school.
R:  Okay.
L:  And my mom worked the Episcopal Church that was right next door.
R:  Okay.
L:  So if I got in trouble, you know, the teachers just walked right next door and, you know, were like, "hey, your son -- your son's acting up" and of course I got in trouble.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I mean, I didn't get away with much then but then once -- once I hit high school, you know, my -- my parents they were pretty -- they were like, okay, you know, you're going to go to college in four years so we're going to let you, you know, just make sure you don't mess up on your own.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you'll be ready for college, so really, like, yeah, once I hit high school they backed off and they weren't -- they never really hounded me about homework or, you know, anything real hard core like that.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, and it -- it worked because, you know, I hadn't -- hadn't bailed out of college yet so -- 
R:  Did you choose this college because it was so big?
L:  Oh, well, I -- I was born in Texas.
R:  Okay.
L:  So this is -- I've always wanted to come back to school here and -- 
R:  All right.
L:  I mean, you know, we have such a great -- they have a really good engineering school which is what I'm in right now.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, I mean, our football team, basketball team, it's all -- it's all great so there's-- this is -- I-- I only applied to three schools and they were all in Texas.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So yeah, I -- I was basically set on Texas by the time I was a sophomore in high school.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  Oh, I knew -- I knew this is exactly where I wanted to go.
R:  That is so cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, what was I going to say?  But it sounds like it helped-- didn't you kind of go to a private middle school, that episcopal school? 
L:  Oh, yeah, my -- my middle school was-- it was tiny. I had, like, my -- I think when I graduated, like, eighth grade, it was -- it might have had, like, twenty three students maybe in my class.
R:  Okay.
L:  But then my high school was really big.  I had, like, almost six hundred kids when I graduated in high school.
R:  Okay, mine too.
L:  So I gradually stepped up, you know, in size.  So it was-- it wasn't too bad.
R:  And so now you live in a house? 
L:  Yes, I'm in a house.
R:  Okay, like a fraternity? 
L:  Oh, no, no, no, it's a -- it's just -- it's a four bedroom house, like -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  A couple of, like, ten blocks off campus.
R:  I was just asking because I have friends who say they live in a house but it's a frat--
