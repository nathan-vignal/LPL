L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, can you hear me?
L:  Yes, I can.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm fine. [LAUGH]
R:  Where are you?
L:  I'm in Houston.
R:  I'm in Seattle.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Is this the first time you've done this? 
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, me too, okay.  [LAUGH] I guess we're supposed to talk about family.
R:  Okay.  So, you want to start or what?
L:  Um, okay.  I am a stay at home mom.  I have a nine month old son and a eight year old daughter.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I've been married four years.  Ah, I have a brother.  My parents are still married.
R:  Well, praise God for that, huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I guess family to you means pretty much the nuclear family?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  If that's our topic.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, well, I guess I see a few wider definitions of family than that but it always comes back to the blood relationships in the end, doesn't it?
L:  I think so.
R:  Yes.  Well, I don't have any family that lives anywhere near me, not physical families.
L:  I don't either.  They're all in Missouri actually.
R:  They're in Missouri?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, my parents are in LA.  My siblings are spread all over the place.  Huh, such is life.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So do you go to a church?
L:  I do.  I go to a Baptist church here in Houston.
R:  Do you consider that to be family?
L:  Um, it -- it's my family now.  But before when I lived in Missouri -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- all my family's up there, my dad has eleven brothers and sisters, my mom has nine.  So -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Big family.
L:  Right.  We were really close.  Um, and we went to church up there but coming down here, yes, I do consider church more my family down here and, actually, our Sunday school is called Family of Friends.  There's a lot of us who have -- who don't have family down here so that has become family. 
R:  So did you move down there for your husband's work or -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh-huh.  Often happens, doesn't it?
L:  Yes, it does, especially down here.  I don't know anybody who is actually from Houston.  Everybody is transplanted from somewhere else.
R:  Really?
L:  Yes.
R:  How long have you been there?
L:  It will be two years in July.
R:  Mm.  You must have a lot of cousins, huh?
L:  At [inaudible] I do.  I don't even have a count.  There's just so many of them.  I just, you know, --
R:  Do you like having cousins?
L:  Mm?
R:  Do you like having cousins?
L:  Yeah, I do.
R:  I also like having cousins 'cause they were sort of like brothers and sisters but not really.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I have twenty seven cousins.
L:  Oh, so you have a pretty big family too.
R:  Yeah.  Well, for this day and age I suppose.
L:  Yeah.  Yes.  [PAUSE]
R:  So I consider, um, that the church here is my family.  In a certain way they take that place socially, but I don't know if they really fulfil the same function in other ways if you know what I mean.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I do.  There's -- yeah, I can understand what you're saying.
R:  I mean, as much as we -- we talk about it in church that it's the family of God and such.  I don't exactly call 'em up and say "my car has broken, will you come help me"? 
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  How long have you been up there? 
R:  Well, about three years.  I was gone for a year but I'm in graduate school here so last year I was in Europe and now I'm back here again.
L:  Okay.
R:  Sort of a strange place.  I grew up in southern California.  The climate isn't exactly to my liking.
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] I can imagine.  Are you closer to your family even being so far apart?  Do you guys keep in touch?
R:  Oh -- 
L:  Regularly? 
R:  Some parts of my family.  All the parts are kind of estranged you might say.  Um, I do have a cousin that lives here.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Well, I don't know how close you are, but, um, my nearest family member is about three hours away in Louisiana and we're not very close but -- 
R:  You're not close to Louisiana?
L:  Oh, we are -- yeah, here in Houston we're about three and a half hours away-- well, not even that, about three hours away.
R:  Oh, so it must be on the east side, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess I don't really know where it is.
L:  Yeah.  We're, um, Houston is about forty miles from the coast maybe if that.
R:  Yeah, I always think of -- of Texas as being big wide open dry land.
L:  Yeah.  We're actually -- it's -- it's nice and green in Houston.  We're not in the -- in the -- well, it is flat but it's not the big cracked walled, earthly kind of Texas I thought it would be either.
R:  Um, so you have trees and everything?
L:  Mhm.  Well, the part -- I'm actually north Houston.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, a little town called Spring but once -- when you go south, south east or south west-- it's -- it's really flat and there isn't a lot of trees but it is still really green.  There's some trees, but where I'm at, there's a lot of trees.
R:  I've never actually been in Texas.  Have you travelled much?
L:  Not really.  Um, I lived in Florida for a while.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And spent most of my life in Missouri up until a couple of years ago.
R:  Well, I drove through Missouri once. 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  That's about it.
L:  Yeah, you see, I've never been too far away -- well, my parents lived in Idaho for a couple of years -- 
R:  Really.
L:  -- and I visited them.
R:  What part?
L:  Boise.
R:  I have a cousin that lives in Boise too.
L:  Yeah, it -- it's nice.  I like it there.
R:  Yes, but my family's spread out pretty much across the west but, you know, not much anything east of the Rockies.  It's all way out there.
L:  Huh.  My, um, family -- most of my family besides a few aunts and uncles still live in the same fairly small town in Missouri that out of, um, eleven brothers and sisters that my mom and dad had -- well, that my dad has -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's only one that lives out of state.
R:  Wow, that's pretty incredible.
L:  And I think my mom has a couple of brothers who live out of -- out of state.  Yeah, everybody has stuck close together because everybody's really close and --
R:  Well, like I say, I don't know -- I can't imagine that to tell you the truth.
L:  I know, it's -- it's -- it's odd.  My husband's, um, his family on both sides, like, he's got seven aunts and uncles on one side and five on the other and they're everywhere else but where they came from.  Nobody is at home.
R:  That sounds more like what I'm accustomed to.
L:  Yeah, everybody grows up.
R:  Spreads out all over the place.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I think I understand the last -- I lived in Colorado for a long time.  I was the furthest east of 'em all in Colorado.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Almost at the Continental Divide, just west of the Continental Divide, ski country.
L:  Yeah, I bet it was pretty.
R:  But it's flat here, no family.  But I don't know, I'll get out of school and move away from here.  How long are you there for, permanently?
L:  Well, it was supposed to be just a couple of years and then my husband was supposed to go back to where we came from because there was going to be some retiring going on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And now that company is -- isn't doing that great and actually people are getting laid off and forced into retirement so we're probably here a lot longer than we wanted to be.
R:  Oh.
L:  But it's really grown on us.
R:  Ah.
L:  It's really grown on us.
R:  Yeah, that's the economy right now, isn't it?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Unfortunately.
R:  Do you have a little baby?
L:  Yeah, yeah, he's sleeping on me right now.
R:  Well, that's pretty precious.  That'd make you think family straight off, wouldn't it?
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was kind of one of the conditions of us moving so far away, we'd -- we'd try to have another child and it happened really quickly so it was a good thing.
R:  Well, I have a cat.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's not the same thing as a baby but it sits in your lap anyway.
L:  Yeah, yeah, we've got a cat too.  She's quite the lap cat.  I usually have them both in my lap.
R:  So do you know anything about this cat stealing the baby's breath stuff?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or is that an illusion? 
L:  Yeah, I think a wise -- a wise [inaudible].  I think they smell --
