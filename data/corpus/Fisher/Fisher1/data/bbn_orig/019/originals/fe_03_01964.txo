L:  Karen.
R:  Lyn.  Hi, how are you?  Where are you?
L:  I'm in, ah, Louisville, Kentucky.
R:  Okay, I'm in Canada actually, Montreal.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, the question was, ah, about the illegal activity in corporate America, I believe. 
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yes.
R:  Well, I don't know about you, but it, ah, I no longer trust, ah, accountants.  I feel that a lot of the business probably are doing the same and we don't know about it.
L:  I -- I feel the same too.  Um, a lot of things that are happening in corporate America, the general public is not brought about upon, ah, especially stockholders or not being aware of what's going on there either.  [NOISE] Get out and close the door.  I'm sorry.
R:  [LAUGH] That's okay, that's okay.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Just close the door.  [NOISE] Corporate America is not being brought up on what's going on.  Um, the -- the stockholders are not even aware of what's going on because what they put in their year in paperwork, is what they want to say.  It's not necessarily what has happened.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think that reflects into the stock market too because no one trusts anything any more.
R:  Exactly, exactly.  I think maybe part of the business -- ah, the problems are businesses so big that nobody knows what anybody else is doing so people can get away with a lot of things.
L:  I agree.
R:  Yeah, so, um, I don't know what the answer is, but definitely more monitoring is -- and I think it's good that they are starting to check into it and I hope they continue that because we need more confidence in -- in the business people.
L:  Right. Um -- I -- I look forward to thinking that once -- what's going on in the world today, once that ends and we can get back to what the home problems are -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, that at that point, they can give more, ah, actually government regulations into private businesses.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Even -- even, um, stockholder held businesses that they can get more accounting in there and independent accounting I guess would be the best way to phrase that because right now, the in home accounting or the hired accounting can easily be swayed.
R:  Yeah, or it can be bought, you can buy for -- for what -- somebody that you want them to do.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And they're -- and they're loyal to the person that, ah, hires them because I've seen that on small scales.  Um, so, you know, you almost have to have open books and, ah, people like, you know, people more than one person that can check the books on a regular basis.  
L:  Yes, the accounting firms need to be held -- I think they need to be held more accountable too for what is being done.  The -- it's almost like the accounting firms need to be audited as well as, um, the firms that the accounting firms are auditing.
R:  Yes, yes, I agree.  [COUGH] I don't know, I think it's bit like lawyers.  It's, um, ah, I don't know, it's accountants, ah, or the record keeping is, um, how should I say it?  Let me think about this?  I haven't thought any -- kind of a wind and way.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm sorry.
L:  That's okay.
R:  Um, anyway, ah, yeah, you're right.  I think we need to get back to -- to something smaller, and I think, ah, they need more monitoring like I said.  Ah, and I am -- I'm anxious for everything to get back to normal because values are not what they should be and I think that's reflected in family life everywhere so it obviously spills into business.  Um -- 
L:  Yes. [NOISE]
R:  So we -- the problem is probably very deep.
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, more than -- it's a symptom I think of our society probably, and we're as much responsible for it as anybody else I suppose.
L:  And it's probably much more elaborate than anyone could ever imagine it being.
R:  Yeah, and more complex, and ah, I guess people get too big and it's just like power corrupts almost.
L:  Yes, and then you can think you're invincible and you can get away with anything.
R:  Yes.  
L:  And then you turn around and look at these companies that are going bankrupt or close to bankrupt, that yet they are still paying their CEO's these exorbitant amounts of bonuses.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  Yes.
R:  You -- you don't have to go too far for that.  You can start with governments.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Their retirees get the pensions that none of us will ever get.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So it's, ah, -- I don't know, it's, ah, we need to get back to basic principles of way back and, ah, I don't know if that will ever happen.  I think -- it may be crises are necessary to bring back balance and maybe everything that's happening in the world right now is for a reason, I mean, a bigger reason that we don't know about like up there -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- I guess I'm a bit -- I'm a bit, ah, spiritual also, so that's -- 
L:  Yeah, I think -- 
R:  -- affected my thinking.
L:  Yeah, I agree with you.  I do, everything does happen for a reason, ah.
R:  At a -- at the perfect time in that we may not understand it and I think things will, ah, change, and sometimes we need something to be really jolted for things to really change.
L:  I think in a way with the stock market falling as it has -- 
R:  Yes, people are scared.
L:  -- it's given people more reason to go and reevaluate things that they were just taking for granted before which is how a lot of these CEOs and agencies got away with what they did because people didn't really look and question -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what was go going on.  They just thought, oh, I'm getting this much money back from this much stock and I'm doing this and, hey, you know, I just -- I want everything go because I'm making money.
R:  Okay.
L:  Which in the long run should not be the way things go.  Money -- it's become a money driven society and -- 
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, for sure.
L:  And that's what it has come down to and as long as these people are getting money, that's all really all they cared about.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And what they've got themselves into now is they had everything all lined up and now with the things that have gone on at home, in, ah, the world, everything, um, then they are finally starting to see, "hey, wait a minute, maybe I should take a better look at what is going on.  How -- how is my money being used in this area?  And how is my money being used in that area"?  And reevaluate that.
R:  It's -- I wonder if -- it's so big, I wonder if it will ever come to pass.  It's -- I think things are too big.  Corp- corporations are too big, everything is too big.  And, um, for my -- in my -- and whenever something is that big you lose control.  Nobody has got control.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  There is there's no way CEOs can not be -- cannot keep track of everything.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, it's impossible, it's impossible.  So, ah, I think we need to demerge instead of merging [LAUGH], you know, because little -- when things are small, they are more transparent, ah, by virtue of being small and, ah, they -- they use, ah, more consultants, ah, you know, wi- without -- 'cause when everything is in house sometimes you, you hide things.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And, ah, you get away with you -- you start -- you try something small, you get away with it and then it keeps going bigger because I seen this like, you know, personally at work, and at some other places and people -- if their -- their tendency is to be that they, ah, -- they go bigger and bigger and more fr- --  and more fraud and they get away with it.  Like I say, they become invincible so they think and then it gets out of hand and then you have to continue I suppose. [LAUGH]
L:  I guess it would go right back into slapping the hand that feeds you at that point because why would they want to go against the company that's giving them a pay cheque?
R:  Yes.
L:  Whereas if they had an independent contractor come in that had no real cost to the company that would feel freer to acknowledge when there was, ah, errors or misappropriations or whatever they feel -- 
R:  I don't think -- I'm personally probably don't think they're errors.  I think somebody along the way, ah, maybe even hired somebody to do, you know, that would do the creative -- ah, accounting but they want it, you know, the creative bookkeeping.
L:  Yes.
R:  To hide things or to misrepresent things and -- 
L:  And even if it -- and even if it was ended up being a legitimate error but no one went back and fixed it -- 
R:  It's too big I think to be a legitimate.  Maybe at the very beginning and then they hid it.
L:  Yes.
R:  Maybe you're right, you know, like, you make a mistake and then you hide it because -- 
L:  And then that turns into something bigger and it snowballs.
R:  Yes.
L:  And then it's out of everybody's control and all they can do is just continually try to hide what started out small and grew larger and what -- I'm sorry, what was the company name that was closed? 
R:  Enron.
L:  Enron, yeah.  They -- you know, that one there that was just total -- 
R:  That one was bad, [LAUGH] that was bad.  I wonder how widespread it is.  It's -- it's, you know, it, ah, it would be, ah, more reassuring if it was just a couple of companies but it's it has become an accepted practice in that [inaudible] then we are having probl-, you know, it's -- I think it's ethical and it's morals and it goes like I say much deeper than just the companies, it's obvious --probably a reflection of our society.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And you need to get down to basic values of, you know, family values and what the forefathers thought of, you know.  If you look at the Constitution and, ah, you know, even the -- the -- the core with God trust -- does America -- what does it say?  God -- in God I trust.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, it's -- at that time it sounded like they had very solid religious and moral values and I don't think that would have happened.
L:  Very much so.  And -- and back -- I want to think that back when they wrote the Constitution and they got everything written down, yet --
