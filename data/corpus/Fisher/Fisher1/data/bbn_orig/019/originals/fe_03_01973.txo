L:  Hi, this is Dorie Gunn. 
R:  Hi, my name's Florine Dillingham, how are you, Dorie?
L:  Oh, I'm fine.
R:  Good.  Ah, what do you think about especially like the Enron corporation that seems to have started all this?
L:  Oh, I don't think it really started it, I think it was going on before, I just think that brought it to the public eye.
R:  Well you're probably right, that was the first pub- publicity it had.
L:  Yes.
R:  And I believe this sort of stuff has gone on in corporations for years.
L:  I'm sure it has, having been in both sides or corporation in, in, in the offices and in the plants and things, I have seen things that scared me, [MN] really.
R:  Really?
L:  And you can't, you know, say anything because it's your job.  But, ah, --
R:  You couldn't be, like, a whistle blower.
L:  Ah, well, I could of, except that it would of involved a whole bunch of other people that were depending on me, so.
R:  Right.  I understand.
L:  Um, but I think Enron probably brought it to a head, and I think that -- well, I can't imagine anybody getting away with this kind of stuff, but apparently they did, until it was discovered.
R:  That's what amazes me too, I think there should be some kind of -- [MN] something that they should have to own up to this, something -- I think it's criminal actually, because they stole the money from their people.
L:  That is the part that really is disgusting and sickening.  Um, there should be some more government control of that sort of thing anyway, or else there should be some tightening down in the company itself about some of these people that they're hiring.
R:  I agree, especially those higher ups who seem to have everything in secrecy and held in secrecy.
L:  Well, it doesn't seem like -- they're very careful about the people that they hire on the lower echelons, I've noticed, they inspect them carefully and, and -- but I guess if you got a degree and you've got enough experience you can go anywhere.  But --
R:  It would seem that way, and to me it seems like they, they have no feelings and no care, no thoughtfulness for the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people that are lower down, they are just like pawns.  They don't even exist as people to these people because they're only involved in their own financial welfare.
L:  That's true.  It's very true.
R:  And the same thing is happening -- well, it's a bit off the subject -- too in the airlines, which is also a corporation, I expect.
L:  Yep.
R:  And, ah, they too were -- tried to take away from the lower down people, and -- but that one got caught. [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.  Well, I think too that it's going to be -- they're going to be looking at them a lot more closely now.
R:  Well I believe so too.  I don't think --
L:  But it's a little late for that. [LAUGH]
R:  The government can't really police them.
L:  No, there's --
R:  But there should be someone that they need to answer to, someone -- the auditors, the -- you know, someone needs to answer -- everybody needs to answer to someone.
L:  Well, if they're all in it together it doesn't [LAUGH] matter who they answer to, apparently.
R:  That's right.  But ultimately there should be some power that --
L:  There should.
R:  -- you know, that everyone needs to report to.  Not necessarily all the details, but the basics so that people would know they're on the up and up.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  And I think we need to go back about forty or fifty years to get where we were then. [LAUGH]
L:  I think -- you know, you're probably right.  Forty years, at least.
R:  You know, back then people could sign a deal with just a handshake and a man's word was his bond.
L:  True.
R:  And anymore it seems like that is going the way of the dinosaur.
L:  Yep.  
R:  And that is a shame.  You worked on both sides in corporations?
L:  Oh yes.  I was a buyer --
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  -- metal buyer.
R:  And so you saw all the ugliness. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, I did.  Well I worked for a company that, ah, essentially sold us out.  I mean, they transferred all their, all their, ah, manufacturing down south --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- and, um, I mean, I was almost the last person out.  I helped them, um, liquidate their assets, I helped them sell their properties and things, and the guy behind me locked the door. [LAUGH]
R:  But you did all this to keep your job.  I mean, what can you do?
L:  And I -- I told them, they asked me if I wanted to transfer down there, and I said, "No". [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well.
L:  Because I don't want to leave my home and I don't know, I said, "What you've done to us here --"
R:  Could do it again.
L:  "-- you could do down there".
R:  So we've lost the trust in these people.
L:  That's true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know about that company anymore.
R:  No.
L:  It's not a big company, and --
R:  I owned a small business once, and a couple of the people we made products for, ah, transferred down to Mexico --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so we no longer got the business, and I think a lot of our corporations are getting products from outside the company, and services especially, and that's not good for the economy here.
L:  Well that's true.  I think that has a great deal to do with the situation we're in now.  
R:  Yes, it does.  And, ah, do you think this is -- what these people did, not necessarily Enron, but all those --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like them, do you consider illegal or only immoral, or unethical?
L:  Well, it's all three.
R:  [LAUGH] I agree.  I'd agree totally.
L:  I mean, it's got to be illegal or they wouldn't have shut them down when they found out. 
R:  And isn't there only, like, one in jail?
L:  True.
R:  I believe, and there's, like, two hundred or something, you know, that have been exposed?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that --
L:  You wonder --
R:  -- if you or I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if you or I did that to someone, where would we be?
L:  [LAUGH] In jail.
R:  Yes we would.
L:  For quite a while.
R:  Within the week. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And why do these -- why are these people not held to liability for this? 
L:  That's what I cannot understand.
R:  Me too.  It's like, "Oh, well, we did it, and we took all their money and these people have nothing left, but, oh, well, we do".
L:  Yeah, that's it.  Well, I read -- now, I can't remember where it was, that some company, they're, ah, ah, they voted not to, not to -- some of the, some of the lower down people voted not to accept a raise, they said, "Look, you know, the company's having trouble, we don't need a raise this year, and meanwhile the big guy --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- got a couple million dollar raise".  And he took it.
R:  And that's the way it seems to go.
L:  Yep.
R:  It's like if you have money they'll give you a lot more to keep you.  Why they want these people that badly I don't know, maybe because they'll cover up for them.
L:  That could be, because you know, they're, they're laying off older people that have been with them longer and hiring newer ones because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they can hire them for less.
R:  Yes, my husband was laid off -- 
L:  Mine two.
R:  -- about two and a half years ago, and boy, I'll tell you, it hurt.
L:  Yep.
R:  Because, ah, they got someone younger for less money.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so we have no insurance, we have nothing.  Just social security.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, they don't care. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, my husband had been with the company like thirty, thirty years or so --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- but he and -- well the same time, the same time that my company was moving, he was being dogged, and they finally laid him off --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- well he was there long enough so that he gets his pension, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it still, you know, he could of been still working for another five years, 'cause he was only, like, --
R:  Well my husband too --
L:  -- another almost ten years.
R:  -- another five or ten years, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Because he was only fifty seven. 
R:  And, ah, when you're that age and you're laid off, then even the big corporations [LAUGH] won't pick you up.
L:  It's impossible.
R:  Yeah, it is.  It absolutely is.
L:  I was --
R:  And there's another inequity.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, these corporate people, some of the people in the top are not even very old.
L:  No.  And it kinda makes you mad when kids your age [LAUGH] are making millions, doesn't it.
R:  Really.
L:  I mean kids your -- people your kids' age --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I should of said, are making millions, and the people that are working for them that have been there for forty years are making peanuts now --
R:  Right just minimum wage and a little more, maybe.
L:  Yeah.  It's discouraging.
R:  So what do you think we should do about corporations, who would we hold them accountable to in the end?
L:  That's a, that's a good question.
R:  Yeah.  Who would it be?
L:  I -- government --
R:  We can't really have the government overseeing them because then it's not free anymore, you know.
L:  No, that's true.  Government can't do it, and if they won't, there's got to be some kind of, of balance somewhere.  But it's very difficult to decide something like that.
R:  Yes, it is.  And most people -- you know, people like you, you've seen it before, but many people never really see that until it's too late, they don't see it coming.
L:  That's right.
R:  Until suddenly you're out on your ear.
L:  Well, I didn't really see it coming.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because they told us there'd always be -- this company would always be in Grand Rapids.  
R:  Huh.
L:  There's always be a Detrolac[?] in Grand Rapids.  Well, there isn't.
R:  Well, it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- seems like they like to lie too, doesn't it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  They said -- it was really funny, because they -- the -- they changed the president, they, they had -- they had a man that had been there for years that was president --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when I started
