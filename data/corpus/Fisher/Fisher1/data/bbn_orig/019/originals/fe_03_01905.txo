L:  Hi, my name is Mindy.
R:  Hi, my name is Cheryl.  [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Hello, can you hear me?
L:  Yes, I can hear you.
R:  Oh, okay, I'm sorry, I'm on a cell phone, it might be a little difficult.
L:  That's okay. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm sorry, did you say your name was Mindy or Mandy? 
L:  Mindy.
R:  Mindy, hi, Mindy, nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you too.  What part of town are you in? 
R:  I'm in Detroit, Michigan.
L:  Okay.  I'm in New Orleans. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  All righty then.
L:  So I guess we're supposed to talk about what family means to us.  [LAUGH]
R:  All right.  What family means to us.  Do you want to go first? 
L:  No, you can go first, I'll let you go first. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] okay.  Family means to me.  It means having, um, a constant barrage of loved ones, someone to talk to, someone to hug, someone to spend special occasions with, someone to share your ups and downs with.  Um, you know, just -- just to have someone other than people that you're close to.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Outside of family, um, someone that you can really find a comfort zone in.  I believe sometimes you can find someone outside of family that gives you that -- that feeling but without that, um, somewhat blood relation or relation through a marriage or some sort to where they have been able to come to really know you.
L:  Right.
R:  As you are, as -- at -- at your comfort zone.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I -- I -- I believe that -- that -- that gives you that -- that -- that -- that ultimate feeling.
L:  Right.
R:  And you get it because these are the people you call family.
L:  Right.  [NOISE] I feel like it gives me a feeling of safety and security and -- and knowing that -- that someone's always going to be there for me no matter what, that -- I could be the biggest group in the world but [LAUGH] your family's always there for you and, ah, friends.  Like, my mother used to say to me and my sister when we were growing up, um, "Friends come and go but your family's always there".  So -- 
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's true, that's true.
L:  Do you have a large family? 
R:  Actually, my immediate family is fairly small at this moment.  I lost both parents, um, in ninety three and ninety seven respectively and I'm -- 
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  There's three girls -- oh, thank you, but trust me, it was -- it was -- it was an experience that it was just time for me to go through.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, there's three girls and one boy.  But outside of that, that immediate family, I had, like, forty four to forty six cousins.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH] So I -- I -- I didn't feel lost at all.
L:  Do you have any children? 
R:  I have no biological children.  I have, um, had the pleasure of raising just about all my nieces and nephews.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, so I -- I -- I feel -- ah -- I've -- I've -- I've had a chance to gain -- gain that nurturing.
L:  Right.
R:  Mothering aspect.
L:  [NOISE] They're lucky to have had you. [LAUGH]
R:  Thank you, thanks.  
L:  You're welcome.
R:  And what about you?  What is your family life?
L:  I have -- I have -- I grew up with only one sister and, um, and then I have two girls myself. 
R:  [NOISE] How old are they?
L:  Ah, I have a ten year old daughter and a twenty month old daughter.
R:  Oh.
L:  So it's a big gap. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow, okay, well, that's good.
L:  My oldest -- my oldest daughter helps me a lot with my youngest though.  So it's -- it's nice, it's -- it didn't work out like we planned, because, you know, we had three miscarriages in between, but, ah, ended up working out well because I can -- I had, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- eight and a half years to spend with one all to herself, and so she thinks she is the queen.  And -- [LAUGH]
R:  Of course, but -- 
L:  And, ah, but she's able to help me with the other one.  I can take a bath by myself, I can do a lot of things.  I'm cooking dinner right now and she's watching. [LAUGH]
R:  Gee, and -- and that is such a blessing.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  At least -- at least, well, you know, I -- I know that when they grow together, closely -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- they develop a bond.  It's like you almost can't break 'em.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's like one develops the same -- they develop the same identity.
L:  Right.
R:  But when you have space in between 'em, you have -- 
L:  Mhm.  Well, me -- me and my sister, while we were growing up, we, um, we fought like cats and dogs.  We were only eighteen months apart.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And we still -- we still fight -- we still quite a bit, ah [LAUGH] now that we're older, but there's a difference between the fighting.  It's just 'cause we're such opposites, you know.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I feel like I'm the one that -- I have my head on the right way. [LAUGH] She's -- she's just kind of hasn't grown up yet, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  I know the feeling, I have a sister like that.
L:  So -- so I'm the one who's constantly bossing at her. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  So at least the fighting now is -- is not so much, "I'm going to pull your hair and punch you in the face". [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  It's more of lecturing and, ah, but -- 
R:  Yeah, I can understand that.  Well, my sisters, I think they -- they just think that everything I gained they're supposed to have.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Although I worked for it.
L:  Yep, that's the way it works for us, mhm. 
R:  And like, no, no, no, I worked for this, you go out and work for yours.
L:  Right, uh-huh.
R:  But I -- I just -- it's strange, it's strange how you grow up in the same household.
L:  Right, and you turn out to be so different.
R:  Right, and I just never understood that.
L:  That's -- that's how me and my sister -- 
R:  It will come to me.
L:  I mean, my sister still -- she moved back in with mom -- my parents and -- and, ah, and I remember when my husband's parents had passed away, um, you know, went through all the ordeal of, um, having to move everything and sell the house, and it was a lot of work trying to get rid of all that junk that they had.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I remember, um, after, you know, they had passed and we went through that whole -- whole ordeal, I told my parents, um, look, you all need to try to get rid of some of your junk you have.
R:  Right.
L:  Because when you pass away, it's not going to be fair to leave all that on me and Jenny so -- so we can get your house ready to sell it, and I remember my mom saying, "You're not going to sell my house".  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  
L:  Okay, and she said, "Well -- where -- where's Jenny and Ashley going to go?"  Her -- she has daughter.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I say, well, she's just going to give her the house, [LAUGH] so of course I got pinned the selfish one.  [LAUGH]
R:  So that's just being the -- the realistic one.
L:  At a high [inaudible] I have had to -- everything I have, my cars, my furniture, everything I have worked for. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  You know, some -- some -- some kids just expected to be handed everything on a silver platter and it just -- 
R:  Why do I know that?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I have a God sister that's just like that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  She's oh, early thirties and she has two kids, ten and twelve.  She won't work.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  She stays in her father's house and when something breaks, we share a two family flat.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And when something breaks, you would think since she -- she's not paying rent, she could at least go and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- have it fixed or fix what her kid has broken.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or replace something for normal wear and tear.  She feels it's his -- his responsibility.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.  I think -- you know what I think it all boils down to, I think all across the world we all have the ex- exact same family, we just all look different. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, and I was just thinking now, like, oh, gee, do you ever have thoughts and talk to somebody that -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- how many miles away and you still say, oh goodness.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You do that too?  I mean -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I just look at her and I'm like I just -- I just don't understand.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do- -- my Godfather, he -- he has -- he's been a surrogate father to me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  All my life.
L:  Right.
R:  And to see, he said to us, "All I want to do is see you guys graduate from college".
L:  Mhm.
R:  I have two and a half degrees.  She has okay, she -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  She went. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But she never came home with anything.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  And, you know, she expects so much though.  It's like when I may build major milestones.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, she -- yeah, she's happy, you know, but he's so, you know, he's so elated that he just wants to do the world, "Okay, we'll fix up your house", yah de yah de yah de.
L:  Okay, and they get jealous saying no, well -- 
R:  Right.
L:  You should pay for it.
R:  When I told her, "Well, why don't you do something"?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, do something to make him want to do for you.  He knows that you're coming to him with your hand stuck out.
L:  Yeah, and my sister's attitude is -- 
R:  All the time.
L:  -- I shouldn't have to do something in order to get the same attention. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, you know, but it's -- it's just awful.  I mean, the last statement I heard her make was her daughter needs braces so she said, "Well", ah, she thought -- ah, saw a commercial on TV for Sears and I think it was like ninety eight dollars per month.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So she said, "Oh, fifty dollars a piece, I guess the grandparents can handle that".
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  And I just looked at her and I said, "Well, why can't you?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, -- well, they -- they want their grandkids to have the best, so, um, I figure if I go and tell them she needs braces, then they will be more than willing to help out.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And that's -- I said, well -- "If you got -- got the braces, yourself, you took the initiative".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And then couldn't afford it -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- maybe they'd be a little bit more willing, but you plan on going to them saying, "Okay, this is what my child needs, um, give me some money".
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, and I said, "You never stopped to think that probably why you're stuck in the rut you're in and you're not climbing anywhere is because that's where you want to be".
L:  Right.
R:  "That's exactly how you want to be".
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and it's like, "All right, here we are, all family".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And to look at us, we're just like night and day.  We st- -- like I say, we stay in a two family flat.  You will come in the downstairs door, look directly to your left and see in her house and you'd be like, "Okay, a tornado hit".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You come up maybe twelve stairs --
