L:  Hello?
R:  Yes, hi there, my name is Roy and, ah, I'm representing the University of Pennsylvania on our, ah, survey gathering, ah, thing today.  Ah, can you hear me all right, sir?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  Well we're just -- we'd like to talk to you, to get to get your opinion today about corporate governance and, ah, you know, what's going on currently in the corporate world, basically.  Ah, I know there's been a lot of news about it lately regarding, ah, corporate scandals and that sort of thing, and I was wondering if you might, ah, for starters, just ah, think if it should be a self policing thing, or do you think the government should be, ah, perhaps more involved?
L:  Well, ah, first of all my name is Jay.  Ah --
R:  And where are you from, Jay?
L:  Maryland.
R:  Okay.
L:  Mm.  I've always believed that the less government inter- intervention the better.
R:  All right.
L:  But, um, recently there has been some bad examples, but I, I, I think they've come about because of government intervention in trying to, um, you know, hide things from, from the government and things like that.  So if there was, ah, less --
R:  In other words you feel that the government just needs to have more regulatory authority over and above the existing laws that may be in effect?
L:  Ah, no, I don't think --
R:  Or do you think that, ah, the government should be -- should have less authority in fact because there may be too many laws in effect?
L:  Exactly.  I think it should be less laws.  Because --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- because the more laws you make the more ways people come up to get around them.
R:  Well, that's, that's true.  Um, but there's -- I think you'll, you'll agree with me that most corporations out there are pretty honest, but ah, you know, ah, unfortunately the, ah, the results of the fewers have ruined it for the many, and I think this is even reflected on the stock market itself.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Perhaps unfairly, and it probably has even shied away some people from even making additional investments in the market, you know, even in a money market -- ah, in a mutual fund situation where they could come in, um, you know, with small amounts of money.  I think it's just given a bad, ah, taste to a lot of people for, um, ah, corporations in general.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, ah, don't, don't you agree that it's the corporations in this country that really represent the, ah, the true economy and not the government?
L:  Ah, yeah, I would, I would agree that, that it would represent the economy, but of course the government tries to control, um, exactly what, what the corporations' outputs are.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, the, the more -- it seems the more prosperous the corporations get, the more, ah, regulations will come.
R:  Well I know a lot of people feel that way, and, ah, it's probably the results of, ah certain political parties' philosophies, ah, which may have jurisdiction in the matter.  Um -- how do you feel about, ah, companies having, ah, off shore, um, ah, bank accounts or, ah, so called loopholes that they can get away with that are tolerated under the current, ah, tax laws?
L:  Ah, I --
R:  Do you think this might be for the betterment of the companies to, ah, perhaps, ah, employ more people, or do you think they're just using it for selfish reasons?
L:  Well, of course there are some that are going to use it for selfish reasons, but then there's those that, that it's, um, it does help to, to bring more jobs, because it's, it's, it's less money that has to go away to, to the government.
R:  Sure, sure.  And we sure do need more jobs in this country.  I know that, ah, officially the current, um, unemployment rate they say is six per cent, but don't you really think it's a lot higher?
L:  Ah, I'm not -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it, it's hard to tell from my little corner of the world.  But --
R:  Well, in my corner of the world I sure see a lot of people out on the streets driving cars, and I assume they may be out there looking for work.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  They can't be, ah, joyriding during the week -- during the day, that's for sure.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, do you think that, ah -- so, so you're saying, basically that we really don't need, ah, more laws, we just need more, ah, adherence to the existing laws by the corporations?
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh-huh.  Okay, and what do you think, ah, we should, ah -- that should perhaps be done to, ah, encourage this, ah, ah, this so called honesty by the corporations?  Should there be maybe financial incentives, or should the government maybe, ah, ah, just try to, ah, ah, you know, come down more on the corporations?  In other words, should -- should it be a voluntary thing mostly on the part of the corporations, and how do you think they could get that going?
L:  Ah, yeah, I believe it would be, ah, voluntary, um, you know, because money talks.
R:  That's for sure.
L:  And if you put some incentives out there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [MN] the corporations are going to eat them up. [LAUGH]
R:  Like maybe tax incentives that they could pass on to, ah, the employees and, um, you know, all around -- be -- you know, just have a better all around situation for everybody.
L:  Exactly.  
R:  Because some people are of the opinion that a lot of the, ah, ah, economic problems today are results of our combined tax brackets of around forty per cent when you, ah, you know, govern in all the, ah, the federal, the state, the, um, you know, and the property taxes and the school taxes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't think anybody's in as low as twenty or twenty five per cent bracket.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Would you like to see the IRA expanded even more?  In other words, something to get people more to save, and, and, ah, and encourage more dependence -- independence on their own?
L:  Definitely.  They -- the IRA should be expanded.  I mean, it should, it should be -- even other avenues.  I mean, even, um, you know, more choices for, for IRA type of, ah, situations.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um --
R:  Because I know they're recently expanded the contribution amounts just this year to three thousand dollars from two thousand, and that's been hanging at two thousand for a little bit too long, ever since the middle seventies, I think.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, and, and, and really three thousand is, is not that much.
R:  It sure isn't.
L:  If you're talking -- if you want people to save ten per cent --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, of their gross income --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to put away, you know, especially tax free --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, that three thousand is not a lot.
R:  That's not a whole heck of a lot if you're -- especially if you're getting a later start in life.
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
R:  I know if you're in your early or mid twenties that three thousand a year can, ah, really multiply by the time you're in your sixties, but a lot of people don't ah, really, ah, ah, start to get the need to save until they're in their forties or fifties, and by then it may be too late.
L:  Exactly.  
R:  Ah, but ah, it's a start for sure.  Ah, what else do you feel the, um, the government, um, could possibly do to encourage corporations to, ah, be a lot more, um, ah, voluntarily compliant, ah, you know, for both fairness and, ah, you know, things in general that they could help, ah, their employee, ah, employees with?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Or, or do you think the government's doing a pretty good job right now, ah, of, of monitoring things?  In other words, sufficiently enough?
L:  Ah, yeah.  I mean, [LAUGH] over, over monitoring.
R:  Well, what's your personal situation, if you don't mind me asking --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- are you, ah, working for a government or a corporation, are you self employed or --
L:  Yeah, I'm self employed.
R:  Okay.  Well then --
L:  I guess it's a big bias there. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well that's self employed and small businesses is what makes this country run.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] I mean, I, I've worked for government, I was in the military --
R:  So was I, uh-huh.
L:  -- and I've, I've worked, you know, private sector --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, large corporations, small corporations, and --
R:  And, ah, do you prefer, ah, being your own boss, ah, the best of all three?
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Well you have to, ah, ah, govern yourself because if you don't the books aren't going to balance and the customers aren't going to come in, are they.
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  What -- generally speaking, what type of business are you in?
L:  Um, I'm in --
R:  Ah, without being specific.
L:  Yeah.  Ah, basically, ah, consulting, um, business development consulting.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's good.  Well, being close to Washington DC I guess there's opportunities for that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's something I'm going to have to look on the internet myself, because that's something I'd like to get into.  I'll have to do a Google search on cons- consulting and see what I come up with.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you have a computer at home?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  Well there's enough information out there to, ah, certainly, um, you know, ah, give you more information.  Ah, I wish I could think of some sites for you I could suggest, ah, for, ah, small business.  But, ah, you'd be surprised what you could come up with, ah, on a Google search or a Look Smart search --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with just one or two key words.  Are, are you looking to expand your business, maybe, and grow bigger?  Or do you think you're going to stay a one man operation where you are?
L:  Yeah, I make -- I'm, I'm actually expanding now.  I'm, I'm actually expanding in, in different areas.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, you know, I'm trying to divide my time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I, I actually went to get over into, um, you know, I've been studying and, and monitoring, um, into foreign exchange trading.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's been very intriguing to me. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  Well, are you self incorporated?
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  Because, ah, ah
