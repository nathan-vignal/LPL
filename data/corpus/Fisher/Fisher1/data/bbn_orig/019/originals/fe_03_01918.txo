L:  [NOISE] Hello! this is David.
R:  Yes, this is Heather, and I guess I'm doing a phone study.
L:  Yeah, I guess so. 
R:  They said we were supposed to talk about family, is -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that all they tell us?
L:  Ah, I guess that, this is just my first one, so --
R:  Mine too. [LAUGH]
L:  I have no idea.  Ah, bu- -- yeah, I guess it's what family means to me.
R:  Yep! that's what they told me.
L:  Okay, ah, pretty much, family, is, ah, my close, my close family is, I mean my wife and kids, and mama's parents, ah, [NOISE] ah, trying to do whatever I can to make them happy.
R:  Ye- my family right now would be my husband, we don't have any kids yet, and then I have my parents, I don't have any brothers or sisters, and grandparents, aunts and uncles, all live out of state, but we try to keep in touch.
L:  Oh, okay, yeah, I've got, ah, quite a few aunts and uncles,  I guess, around me, but, ah, but they're not really, what I consider close, ah, we rarely get together, even, ah, sometimes, oh, I guess, used to, used to get together around Christmas, and Thanksgiving, but even that is becoming rarer.
R:  Um, I know how that is, I haven't had Thanksgiving or Christmas with my parents, I don't know how many years.  I'm a church musician, so I always have stuff at work for Christmas.
L:  Oh, okay.  Where, where are you calling from?
R:  I'm in Lincoln, Nebraska. 
L:  Okay, I'm in Hendersonville, North Carolina.
R:  Wow.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, I, ah --
R:  I just signed up for this thing, yesterday.
L:  Ah, I had this just, just a couple of days ago, so, I'm not really sure what it's all about, but --
R:  I'm not either.  I thought there'd be, like, more specific questions, not just topics, um, [NOISE] my husband's at work right now, so I'm just here by myself.
L:  Well, I've got two, two boys here.
R:  Two boys.  My office mate ha- just had her second daughter about a month ago.  Still haven't seen her yet but I saw the pictures. 
L:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  A lot of people enjoy the baby stage and all that.  Like, I like the grownup stage a little more.
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] their other --
L:  There's a little more freedom.
R:  Their other one's just eighteen months, so I don't know how she's,  she's doing it all.
L:  Yeah.  Mine are seven and five.  So they -- able to do a lot of things for themselves --
R:  Yeah. That's good.
L:  I suppose they're going through the, sort of, different stages of totally being dependent, ah, you know, starting to crawl, and then walk, and everything, and -- it was a relief when they started actually talking. 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  "Tell me what you want!" [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah.  Rather than point, and open your mouth and "Ah, ah, ah" --
R:  [MN] My husband's got brothers that are twins --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- they're, they're, um, three years younger, so they must be twenty five:  But I haven't, they, um, they look alike, but they don't look like my husband at all.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  They're much taller, and they don't look alike at all.
L:  Ah, so --
R:  I guess, maybe twins run in the family.  
L:  Yes, mothers.  It's supposed to run in my family, and we were hoping that we would not get them and we didn't.
R:  Well, that's good.  I don't think I particularly want twins.  I guess it'd be the next generation where you get --
L:  Yeah, yeah, normally it skips one or two. Um, we're happy we didn't have, ah, at least the one and didn't have the two, so -- we thought there for a while we might, but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- turned out not.
R:  That's good.  How, how do these people do it that have triplets, and quadruplets, and who knows, all the [LAUGH] --
L:  No, no, not at all.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's like, I got some, some friends at work that got a, one boy who's, I think he's about five, five or six, and then they've got twins on the way.
R:  Oh, wow. 
L:   So yeah, if I had to find a way out I would have done it, but I'm glad I didn't.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Automatic three.
R:  I got a friend in Colorado from college and her husband just got sent to the Middle East with the army --
L:  Uh-oh.
R:  -- so she's got her two little girls by herself.
L:  Yeah, that would be bad, ah --  
R:  Let me think, one is just about four, the other one, no, the one must be three. The other one's almost five.  And they had just moved out there when he got back in the army.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  They were in Kansas.
L:  So she's really not even settled in, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Having to, having to try to deal with him going off, and then, making new friends and everything.
R:  Yeah, I think it was back in November that they said he might have to go.  So I guess it could have been a lot earlier.  But she has no idea, of course, when he'll be back.
L:  Yeah, I guess a lot of them don't have any clue when they're going to return.
R:  [MN] My husband works for television, and his station sent some people over, but luckily he didn't have to go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, soon as he told me that, that was when all those journalists were injured and killed.
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  And it was like "I'm glad you're here!"
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you can just stay home, don't volunteer --
R:  Yep, and as soon, as soon as it all started, his beeper  was going off all the time with all these CBS all pagers.
L:  Yeah?
R:  It finally slowed down on that.  I mean, they were, every few minutes "We're going to have continuous coverage.  We're going to break in every hour.  We're going to do this". Like, I don't care. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Especially, he works the evening shift so, you know, we're trying to sleep in the morning, and that thing's going off.
L:  Ah.  Yeah.
R:  But luckily, that slowed.  That slowed down.  But he had CNN on all the time.  I'm like "Don't you get enough of it at work?" [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. So, there's some people at work, that's all, basically all they do is, is watch the news, and everything, and I, I just don't see how -- love it?  Well it's like right now, my kids are watching Nickelodeon, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's about all I get to watch. 
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] they control the viewing.
L:  They pretty much do, ye- although they have one in their room too, they're just kind of back and forth, and I just kind of relax.
R:  Our newspapers actually slowed down some on it.  Now there's all budget cuts, and people being laid off for this, that and the other, taxes, all that stuff [LAUGH].
L:  Yep, well, same thing here.
R:  I go to the university, and that's kind of a mess right now.  I guess the, um, President said that they were going to have to get rid of some tenured faculty, and that's really caused enough horror.
L:  Oh, oh.
R:  I don't know in what program.
L:  Yeah, that's going to ruffle a few feathers there.
R:  Yep, and then I heard something about a fifteen percent or twenty five percent tuition hike.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] and it already went up about ten or fifteen percent this year, so I'm glad I only have one year left.  But that is unless -- and they already have it with -- where the out of state tuition is just outrageous --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and now the in state's getting that way.
L:  Well, that's just, I guess, ah, I know one thing everybody's looking at here in North Carolina is trying to follow South Carolina's example where they've got a, just started a lottery --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- yep, so they, ah, a lot of the tuition is paid for, pretty much, they're trying to get it to where if you maintain a, a C average, you don't pay for school.
R:  Wow.
L:  You pay for college all the way through, and here in North Carolina  they are fighting the lottery, 'cause they don't want a lottery --
R:  I was going to say, I think they were fighting it here a couple of years ago --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Then everyone said that everyone's running to Iowa --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  And doing it there, so we might as well have it here.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's it.  Around us, well, we've got Tennessee that's got it, Virginia's got it, and South Carolina, so, there's pretty much all the states around us have it.  And we said, "What are we waiting for, why are we sending a lot of our money somewhere else?  We might as well leave it here."
R:  Yeah, that's what they said here and then I think they dropped it.  I haven't seen anything about that, but, well --  
L:   Yeah, well, I think our, I think our Governor is now pushing for it, so, yeah, that's one of my concerns, is trying to pay for college later on, with the, with the kids and, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I've tried to start saving, but it's just a little bit I'm saving, and seeing all the costs going up, I'm not sure how I'll be able to --  
R:  Yeah, outrageous every year.
L:  -- afford that much.  Yeah, and I, I guess when they fi- were first born, I said, well, I've got eighteen years to save for it. 
R:  Right.
L:   Well, now I've got like eleven --
R:  Yep.  [LAUGH] It'll be here before you know it. 
L:  -- and then both of them are going to hit, hit at about the same time, there's only, like, two years' difference.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that can really be hard.
L:  Yep, so I'm either hoping one of them or, or both are really good athletes, and can get scholarships, or really, really smart, or --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, scholarships definitely help, I couldn't have done it without it.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] I'm afraid I'll be just like my parents, where they, they were able to put me through the first year, and after that I had the co-op.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I pretty much paid for my school but, then, ah, it was difficult, it took me, like, a year longer --
R:  Yeah.
L:  To go, and but I did come out, and only owe about two thousand dollars, --
R:  Wow.  Wow, that's great.
L:  But, ah, yeah, I- I'd like to be able to pay for theirs, but I just don't see, I don't see how.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, my husband's still paying off some of his stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He started out as a meteorology major with a journalism minor.
