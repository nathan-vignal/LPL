L:  Hi, this is Amy. 
R:  Hey, Amy, my name's Ben.  How are you?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  Good.  Ah, so that's, ah, a pretty difficult topic we have.
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH] Are you, ah, -- I'm a -- I'm a -- I know a little bit about that stuff, I'm a third year, ah, law student.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, ah, do you -- and you're -- what sort of, ah, career do you have?
L:  Actually I work for a very large software company, so, um, --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and actually this year we have been, um, affected, financially at least, a lot because of corporate --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- well, the economy.  I don't -- and it's hard to pinpoint how much is related to, um, corporate scandal, I guess, but certainly our stock has gone down significantly this year, which is very disappointing.
R:  Yeah, there's -- I mean, part of it, ah, you know, I mean, I think over the past few years, you know, there are folks on Wall Street that have sort of inflated expectations about companies, and, you know, there was a couple of years there where there was -- where investment bankers were pretty much committing fraud, you know, in sort of the way they structured deals.  And, ah, -- and you know, that pumped up the stock market but maybe that -- a lot of that was just sort of fake value.  You know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you know, and hopefully the government will, ah, you know, ah, go after the investment bankers and CEOs that are, um, committing accounting fraud and all that stuff, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- yeah.  I'm, ah, I -- I think, you know, that's the sort of, ah, scandals in the sense that, you know, they, um, -- that a lot of value was lost and a lot of, ah, money was sort of taken away from small investors, and, and, ah, put in, you know, investment bankers' pockets is, is not a good thing, you know.
L:  Yeah, and I think it's hard to say because, um, it's probably -- there's so much going on in large corporations today that, um, that I think it's hard for anyone to really know how much --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- maybe scandal or how much pocketing is going on of funds.  I mean, you open the paper any day and you can see, you know, somebody that was committing some type of fraud, um.  And it -- but I think it's hard to strike a balance between government's involvement and private corporations.
R:  Yeah, sure. 
L:  To balance, balance that out with people's investments and their own personal --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- savings and well being.  I mean, that's certainly huge.  So it's, it's a fine line, because, um, even for a publicly traded company, it's still usually private corporation and I would hate to see government getting too involved in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in how companies run their, their finances and their corporations.
R:  Yeah.  I think a, a lot of it is, ah, accounting issues --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, you know, right now there -- there used to be very little government oversight of accounting standards, you know, there was, ah, the Federal Accounting Standards Board -- or the -- and there was some private sort of industry accounting boards that monitored sort of how, how accountants -- you know, how -- so you know, when a company makes, makes a contract with a -- or sells some services, they can either book it, you know.  I mean, a lot of this stuff came from the companies booking, ah, profits, you know, now, when they should have booked them over twenty years.  So their balance statements looked, looked a lot better to investors, but it -- the -- so that their stock price went up and they made a lot money -- more money off their stock options.  But the reality was that they were sort of -- those were artificial accounting entries because they, they weren't actually going to get the money for, you know, unless it was over twenty years.  And the accounting industry I think was sort of complicit in a lot of that sort of, sort of loose standards that, that, ah, were out there.  So -- so right now I guess, um, you know, with, with Sarbanes[?] Oxley[?], with legislation that the government passed, and, um, with Sarbanes Oxley, there's sort of this new accounting oversight board that, ah, -- which a few people were just appointed to.
L:  Okay -- what -- I'm sorry, what are they called?
R:  Well, I, I'm not sure -- I'm not sure what it's called, but there's, um, there -- it's sort of part -- it's sort of under the direction of the Securities Exchange Commission.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  There's, there's this accounting board that's gonna -- that's gonna have some oversights sort of over, over accounting standards now.  And there's -- so that one of the big questions is whether or not, ah, companies should have to account for stock options.  
L:  Okay.
R:  Like when they -- like when a CEO gets a hundred million of stock options.  Now, you know, they don't have to put that on the balance sheet, so investors -- so investors don't know, you know, how -- so a company could be making -- you know, have twenty million in profits --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but be paying off thirty million to CEOs in the form of stock options.  And, um, so, so there's -- right now, right now nothing's happened about that.  So I'd like to see them, you know, ah, force these companies to account for stock options and -- but I mean, there's the concern of the government getting too involved.  You know.
L:  It -- yeah.  There is -- my job, I work, as I mentioned, for a software company --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I work in support, so, um, I deal with customers all day, and, um, as I mentioned it's a really large company and, um, all the fortune five hundred corporations are -- not all, but I think, I don't know, like eighty seven per cent or something use our software to run their financial, um, their sales and distribution and their marketing --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- so I -- I mean, I speak with customers all day and a lot of issues that come up with the software, because it's very complex, is um, is really it's the financials, and especially in the past, I'd say less than a year or so, there have been so many more issues that have come up in terms of quality assurance --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and, and regulation for finances.  And, um, for example Enron has been mentioned --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- I -- so many times, just in talking to customers, and they've even mentioned on a couple of occasions, you know, this is -- wouldn't have been an issue last year but, you know, we need resolution on this immediately because --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- because we're so tightly regulated, we're getting audited all the time, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, that's all based on, on situations like Enron.  So it's, it's impacting on I think a lot of people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  In, in every facet of public corporation life, anyway.
R:  Yeah, I guess so.  I mean, I've read a few articles saying that sort of the chief financial officers of these big public companies, their jobs are, are, like, three times as hard as they were before Sarbanes Oxley, 'cause, ah, they have to personally certify the company's financial statements --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- under sort of penalty of going to prison, or facing big fines.
L:  Wow.
R:  And that wasn't the case, sort of, prior to Sarbanes Oxley.  So they -- they really want to make sure they get it right, and the problem is with accounting standards, you know, people -- there's so many things that are sort of questionable.  There's no -- accounting isn't clear at all, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because, because, um, you know, there's items of income and, ah, assets that, you know, are -- there's sort of different ways that you can value them.  And several of them are sort of acceptable under business practices, so.  So Sarbanes Oxley, it's sort of -- it's come in there, but it's created a lot of confusion for, ah, CFOs.
L:  Mm.
R:  Because they -- you know, they, they want to make sure they're getting it right, but it's, um, it's not really, you know -- and a part of it is Enron, Worldcom and a few other companies are sort of -- you know, they're bad actors, and, ah, I think most people -- most people think that most companies are not trying to engage in those sort of, ah, you know, schemes.  So it's, it's a shame that, ah, you know, that more honest financial officers are having to, you know, deal with the fallout from Enron.  But, um, --
L:  Mhm.  And I think it's hard too, because especially someone at that level of management is involved in so many other -- other areas of management in managing the company, even if it is the CFO, um, so for them to actually personally certify that, you know, every fact of accounting is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not so much even right or wrong or trying to be corrupt or, or not right, it's just to certify something of that magnitude, it's, I think it's too difficult because they wouldn't have been involved in the day to day daily operations in running --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, the numbers for last month, I mean, they wouldn't have done it themselves, so how -- it's, it's tremendous pressure, I think, on them if they have to say, yeah, I guarantee that everything's right, even if it's -- you know, that -- I mean, how could they know that?  They can't.
R:  Yeah.  I, I'm glad I don't -- I mean, a lot less people want to be, ah, I think want to be chief financial officers, because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, just because there's so much -- I mean, there's a -- that sort of -- they're -- I guess, ah, I mean, some people are worried about sort of maybe a progression over the past maybe, you know, what, ten or twenty years of, ah, of imposing a lot more criminal liability on, ah, corporations.  And they're sort of -- the direction has, you know, has been towards making, ah, making a lot of things crimes that pr- -- that previously would of been -- you know, you would of -- would of been subject to damages and civil fines, but they're -- the penalties have gotten a lot harsher, and, ah, there's a lot more criminal penalties for a lot of things that, ah, the corporate officers do now.  And, and for people that are in -- and also, you know, each corporation has a board of directors also, and, ah, and previously, you know, boards of directors, they're -- they're supposed to
