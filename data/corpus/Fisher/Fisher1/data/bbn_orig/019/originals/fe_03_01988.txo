L:  Hello, my name is Laura. [PAUSE]  Hello, my name is Laura.
R:  Yeah.  Laura?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And is this your first time in the study?
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Oh, we have quite a topic here today.  What do you think of the corporate illegal activity?
R:  Well I think it's gotten way out of hand because they hadn't -- hadn't policed it up until, ah, they -- they got, ah, you know, until it got out of hand. They could've been doing something about that.
L:  What do you think our government can do to help police the corporate activity?
R:  Well, now I -- I think that they -- they -- they can do a lot of things with it now, because they got a constant watch on it and they got the police that, ah, -- the police [inaudible] watch on it, [MN] and, ah, that's all they have to do, is keep -- keep on top of that now, and I think they can erase all of that.
L:  Do you think high collar, blue collar, white collar crime has risen in the past few years?
R:  Ah, did what?
L:   Has it risen?  Or have we just been more --
R:  Yes, it has, it -- it is really risen in the last -- well, I think they've had it all along but they just caught up with it.
L:  So we've just been more aware of it now?
R:  Yeah, right
L:  Has it affected you personally?
R:  Well, not -- well, it is -- affected of us personally.
L:  And what do you think we as -- as a general public can do?
R:  Well, ah,  well, the general public, ah, they can stay, ah, right, ah, abreast with it -- I mean, by, ah, keeping a watch on it and, ah, --
L:  Do you -- do you think we should boycott certain companies that have had the problem?
R:  Well, I don't think you should really boycott it, but, ah, the ones that are really been into it, ah, the government's taking care of it.
L:  And is that a responsibility of our government?
R:  I think it is, cause --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they're supposed to keep things like that in check, you know.
L:  So I think -- I think personally that it's been going on for a long time --
R:  It has been, they just caught up with it, they just caught up with it.
L:  -- it's just that we're more aware of it now and we've just -- we're just becoming more aware of it now due to the different media that wasn't always available in the past --
R:  Right.
L:  I definitely feel that's an issue. I don't think that -- I -- I think that we have seen perhaps rising costs because of some of the issues that are passed [inaudible] consumers and --
R:  Oh, yes, definitely, definitely so, yeah. Especially, especially, ah, the, ah, the ele- electricity thing.
L:  Yes, that -- I think that's a very big issue, and the cost has passed down to us so we have seen it from that end of it also.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I also think perhaps that we don't do enough, I don't know per se what we could do to change it [NOISE] but I think perhaps that we -- general big business gets away with too much --
R:  Yes, they do.
L:  -- and I don't think they pay their fair share of the taxes, I think that we need to make the general businesses and big businesses more responsible for the fair share of taxes rather than the brunt being to the working person.
R:  That's true.
L:  So, I'm trying to see -- I -- I'm not sure where we could do this, but if -- if the tax pays line up and they were held more responsible for some of the issues that have been -- in time, I don't think that necessarily that they are being held responsible --
R:  They're not being --
L:  -- [COUGH] -- it's always being passed down to a different person whereas the true culprit responsible is not being -- is not being given the brunt of the punishment.
R:  You're right.
L:  I think perhaps that we see --
R:  Oh, listen, ah, is it possible -- I got -- I gotta to urinate -- I'm sitting on the bed, it -- it'll be about one minute. Hello?
L:  Yes.
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, well, the reason for that it -- I'm handicapped, I'm paralyzed on one side due to a stroke I had ten years ago.
L:  Well, that's okay, we all have to do our duty [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  You're right -- well, that's why I had to tell you, you know.
L:  Yeah. I don't know -- I think I don't necessarily know how specific we can make changes but I do think that it -- it is an issue in our economy today. Do you feel that the economy has taken a -- a downward trend because of some of these issues?
R:  It -- it really has, it's taken, ah, a big beating because of that.  All that money, them billions of dollars, it -- it -- the stock market has really suffered, so have all the people that has -- that has the stocks and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, they got, ah, two or three of the big fish and I -- I think if they stay right on top of this, they'll -- they'll get some more.
L:  Yes, I do. I think they need to be able to, uh, you know, pull these people out, but at the same point in time, I -- I also think that the corporations that are the worst offenders are being -- they're given more leniency --
R:  Yeah, they're being slapped on the hands.
L:  -- and I don't think it -- it's necessarily a strong deterrent for them, and I also see that perhaps they're having -- each corporation is using what is, you know, called a -- called a scape goat, where the true people responsible for the decision making are not paying the price.
R:  Well, they have deterred a lot of it by punishing the ones that has gotten caught, I mean the big ones.  But it really haven't stopped -- haven't stopped at all.
L:  No, I don't know, do you think it can stop?
R:  Well, I don't know --
L:  I mean, if it's something we're always going to have --
R:  Well, I don't know whether they can stop it all -- but, ah, they -- they can do a pretty job on it.  It all depends on how they handle them now, and how they punish them. W- --
L:  And do you think -- do you -- have you seen punishments that fit the crime right now?
R:  No, I don't think so.
L:  [NOISE] Do you think the punishments will be a strong deterrent for them?
R:  I think it --it -- it is being --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know what the future might hold --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but it -- it stopped a lot of it when they -- when they, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- got the big men and they seen what they do to them, the ones right behind it they -- they believe, ah, -- really slow it down, they're not going to stop it completely because a lot of that stuff is done under the table and the big people think that they -- they did enough not to get caught.
L:  Yeah, I don't believe they're going to be a list out, but I think -- I mean, I think we can stop some of it but I do think that the majority is under the table and the pocket books are always going to be big enough and human nature being what we are, there are always going to be somebody willing to accept money
R:  Well, that's right
L:  -- for a wrong deed.
R:  -- that's right, because that -- that almighty dollar is so big, that's what it's all about.
L:  Yes, and I think that we're going to have -- and -- and I mean, -- I don't think that we can ever get rid of that innate greed that people have, and it's not everyone but there's always going to be a certain percentage of the general population that's going to have it.
R:  That's right, that's right.
L:  I think we could cut down on that but I -- I don't see it disappearing as a whole in the future --
R:  Naw, I don't either.
L:  -- I think it's something [NOISE] we're always going to deal with --
R:  Look at Barbara Stewart.  I mean, ah, ah, what her name?
L:  Streisand?
R:  No, what's the lady's name --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Miss Stewart, the one that -- that they had, ah, -- she's a billionaire, a self made billionaire.  Martha Stewart, yeah.
L:  Oh, Martha -- Martha, yeah.
R:  They didn't done anything -- they haven't done anything to her.  They said that, ah, that -- a lot of people say that they're not going to do anything to her.  She knows too many big people in -- in the high places, and that's wrong.
L:  Yes, if it was inside trading, it was but I think maybe perhaps it's an issue of that that they can't prove it. That's another issue I think that they're --
R:  Well, they have to be able to prove it --
L:  -- facing with the corporate --
R:  -- in order to do anything about it.
L:  Right -- is that they're going to have a hard time proving.  [NOISE]  I think that is another issue that they're going to have is that some of these crimes are going to be unprovable --
R: That's right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And if they're un- --
L:  And that is an issue.
R:  -- if they're unprovable, they'll be unpunished.
L:  Exactly. [NOISE]  I think it's going to be very difficult finding proof -- companies are getting [NOISE] more and more sneaky [LAUGH] with, you know, issuing specific memorandums
