L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  How are you? 
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  Pretty good.  Where you calling from?
R:  Philly.  Where you calling from?
L:  Uh, Wisconsin.
R:  Ah, welcome.
L:  All right.  So, the topic is, uh, family?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.
R:  What do you think?
L:  Uh, nowadays, I don't know.
R:  No, how come?
L:  Um, I mean really what is a family though?  I mean, uh, a mother, a father and a child or -- I mean there's so many different types of families nowadays.
R:  It's true.  I think that they all kind of -- it's how you interpret it.  Whoever -- you have like your biological family and then you have the family that you -- you choose.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I'm a big fan of family either way.
L:  Yeah, well I don't know.  
R:  No?
L:  I -- I guess, uh, uh, personally for me, you know, there was never a father --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- figure so, uh, you know, I really couldn't care less --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I -- I guess in that aspect.
R:  Really, so you feel like you don't care about family or do you --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- feel like you've chosen another family?
L:  Uh, yeah, you could say that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That'd be better good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  Have you always grown up in Wisconsin or ...?
L:  No, actually I, uh, grew up in Chicago.
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh, I lived there for sixteen years with, uh, just my mother and my grandparents.
R:  Uh-huh, wow.
L:  Um, a few years ago moved to Wisconsin, uh, the whole family did.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] Um, after -- a few years after that the whole family split apart.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, and, uh, everyone went their separate way.  I myself went to, uh, to college.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I did that whole thing and now the, uh, the whole family is deciding to, uh, relocate and come --
R:  Really.
L:  Yeah -- and come closer to each other.
R:  That's kinda nice.
L:  Yeah, we- we'll see.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We'll see.
R:  Yeah, sometimes family can be good in doses.
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  Hello?
L:  Yes, hello.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm s- --
R:  Hello?
L:  Yes, are you still there?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, I'm sorry.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, it -- it's this call waiting thing.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  And I hate it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I hate it.  So ...
R:  Um, what were you saying?
L:  You know, I totally lost, uh, my train of thought there on that.
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  I totally forgot.
R:  Um, your family's moving closer.
L:  Yes, yes they are.  Um, hopefully in the next, uh, two or three months.
R:  Wow, that's pretty soon.
L:  Yeah, actually it is.  It -- it's been in the process for about a year now, I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um --
R:  Is the reason they're moving to be closer to each other?
L:  Um, yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, um, my -- my, uh [COUGH] excuse me, my mother recently got married a few years ago --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, my grandparents are getting older --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, uh, I guess they want to be together, so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  What about yourself?  Did you grow up in, uh, a decent family so to speak?
R:  Um, I have come to appreciate my family a lot more now that I'm older.  Um, I -- I guess, uh, I grew up with mom, dad, brother, pretty standard but I moved out, um, when I was sixteen and lived with another family that I'm still closer.
L:  Okay.
R:  And then when I kinda grew up a little, um, I moved back after high school as an adult and, um, we were able to kinda forge a relationship as adults and we work much better like that and --
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  -- so now they're a huge support for me and so I have a lot of family.  I have two large families plus I kind of consider the people that I've adopted into my life to be my family as well.  So, lots of friends that I've had that I consider almost my blood.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I have a pretty loose definition of family actually. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I suppose.  Well, that's -- that's good, though, that's good.
R:  Yeah, so that's I think why I like it so much.
L:  Do you think, um, middle class people have better families than, uh, substandard class people or, uh, really --
R:  Substandard? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well I'm, you know --
R:  Right.  Um --
L:  The bottom of the bottom, I guess.
R:  Yeah, well I would say that, um, no.  I mean I think that economics don't have much to do with a family.  I think that if you're living in poverty you have a lot -- it's a lot harder.  You have a lot more stresses and so your family might get like tried more often --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, I think, also for some families, um, that's what brings them close together.  You know, that sometimes when you're in a really difficult situation you have to kind of bond together with the people around you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I think that -- I don't know if I would -- I think that there's a lot of differences for people who live in different classes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I don't think it necessarily --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- makes a better family or not.
L:  Okay, well what do you think about the, uh, wealthy.
R:  The wealthy?
L:  And families, yeah.
R:  I -- I guess I would say the exact same thing.  You know, I think that, um, money makes things logistically easier but it doesn't mean parents are going to be around.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It doesn't mean you're gonna spend time together.  It doesn't mean that you're not shipping kids out, you know -- [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to the -- with the nanny or whatever.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, um --
L:  Okay.
R:  I don't know, I think --
L:  I -- I --
R:  So, how about you?
L:  I -- I totally -- I would totally agree with you on that but, um, you know, sometimes, you know, you just get a feeling, you know, middle class has, you know, the mother, father, brother, sister --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, living in mid America so to speak, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a little bit better off than the wealthy or the poor.   Some --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, sometimes I think.
R:  Yeah, I guess, you know, it's interesting, say, you know, I think that in some cases it's really true.  I mean, in other cases I think that one of the reasons we probably think that is we think of like America as like the -- we think of, like, middle class as like mainstream --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and I just try -- I heard a statistic recently that, um, apparently only seven percent of the families are traditional families in the United States.  So --
L:  Really?
R:  -- meaning that only seven percent of all families are a mo- mother, father, a married, heterosexual --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, living together, non divorced family.
L:  Wow.  Pretty low.
R:  Yeah, it is pretty low. [LAUGH] You know, and that's kind of what we have our standard by, pretty interesting.
L:  I remember, uh, my grandparents talking, um --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- many times years ago about, uh, about back when they got married, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in the early fifties and, uh, how family was so important.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Everyone lived within, like, two or three blocks of each other.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it -- it's funny how, uh, time goes by and that's not the same any more.
R:  No, it's really different, I think.
L:  Different.
R:  And -- yeah.
L:  Different values --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- people have.
R:  I was, um, visiting my family, um, last week and we were talking about how even when I was growing up it was really important for us all to have dinner together.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and that it was like you couldn't miss dinner, you know, that you had to home, whatever you were doing after school or after work or -- and that was just the time that you spent together.  And now, we weren't really a functional family [LAUGH] I moved out when I was sixteen but still, you know, there was still that time that we all had to spent together --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that's just not even -- not even at all a reality now for most families.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Well, that's all very true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know a lot of people that, uh, you know, have children and are not with, uh, the individual any more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, it -- it's just crazy.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I -- I can't picture that.
R:  Yeah, it -- it's kinda funny I, um, often get more surprised when my friends -- I'm sort of at the age where a lot of my friends are getting married and I -- I'm getting --
L:  What age might that be?
R:  [LAUGH] I'm twenty five.  
L:  Okay.
R:  So, I'm kinda more surprised that my friend are getting married than having children.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] You know, I'm like, "Oh, you're getting married, that's a huge commitment"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "You're pregnant, no problem" you know, and it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- very different.  
L:  [MN]
R:  How about you?  How old are you?
L:  Uh, twenty three.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, you know, in fact I only have one friend --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- who actually did it right.  Um, met a girl, uh, dated for a long time, fell in love, whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- got a house, got married and then had a child.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's one out of, we'll say, twenty.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and that --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- that's just crazy.
R:  It is.  I mean, it's kind of -- I don't know.  What do you think about those new shows, the Married by America?
L:  I haven't ever seen it.
R:  Uh, terrible, in my opinion.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, yeah, I don't know, I mean it's too hard of a topic, I guess, you know --
R:  What are you --
L:  -- to really discuss.
R:  Family?
L:  Yeah, I mean -- I mean, really what is a family though?
R:  Yeah, what do you think a family is?
L:  I -- I have no idea.
R:  If you could define it right now what would you say it was?
L:  Um, people being close to you that you care about and love would probably be family for me.
R:  Yeah.  I think that's a pretty good definition.  I think --
L:  Well --
R:  Yeah, I think I kinda think of it as like people who are unconditional.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're unconditional ...
