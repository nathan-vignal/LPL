L:  Hello, hi. 
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name is Sherry, how are you?
R:  Okay, how are you?
L:  I'm okay.  I didn't quite hear what [LAUGH] the whole topic is --
R:  I'm Lucille.  The topic was what can the government do to [COUGH] improve business practices, I guess.  It was a little unclear, I couldn't --
L:  Okay, like corporation corruption --
R:  -- get all the words.
L:  -- they thinking about that Enron, and --
R:  Yeah, oh yes.  I -- ah, yeah, I have some very -- ah, how do you feel about it?
L:  Okay, well let me see.  Would the government do another intervention of the government.  Well, I think if we had better, ah, policing.  If you have major corporations and businesses like that, don't they have to file, you know, paperwork and, and taxes and account how many shop -- you know, stocks and bonds that they have when they account, you know, um, to account for their shareholders.  And that should be like public record, and someone should of been able to see that, for example, Enron wasn't, um, um, getting the profits that they say they were getting, and that they were losing money continuously, and then after -- and particularly with that Enron situation, they had a woman who worked there who went to, you know, I guess she was a whistle -- whistle blower --
R:  That's right, yeah. 
L:  -- and said all of this was happening, and nothing was done.  So I, I don't know what more than --
R:  Yeah, well that's not what more the government can do, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- these, um, corporations, officers, accountants, were breaking the law --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I don't [MN] believe that nobody had an inkling.  I think part of the problem is that --
L:  What do you mean nobody?  Noone in the organization itself?
R:  Or even in, ah, the Securities and Exchange Commission --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- which is supposed to regulate them.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, because, um, they -- so many of these corporations have ties to the government, you know, and the vice president, ah, was doing the transition right after election --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, ah, he had a group of, ah, people coming in to advise him on what energy policies they should promulgate and what legislation they should ask for --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Enron representatives were sitting at the table, and they were help writing the proposals.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If these corporations were not allowed to give so much money to the political parties and the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- political candidates --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they would have much less influence.  I think that's part of it --
L:  Right, so they think everybody else is looking the other way because they've donated --
R:  Yeah, I, I really think so.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the other thing that the Security and Exchange Commission, um, could crack down --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, nobody has gone to jail yet.
L:  Right, what you -- what --
R:  Yeah, you know, they think after a while people will just forget all about it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, it'll be swept under the rug and that's that, and the contributions and the -- ah, will go on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now, Vice President Chaney was an officer of Halliburton before he was elected.
L:  Yes.
R:  And Halliburton [COUGH] just -- pardon me, just got --
L:  You okay?
R:  -- a big contract --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, in Iraq.
L:  Okay, yeah, mhm.
R:  Ah, Condoleezza Rice --
L:  Mhm, I read that.
R:  -- was involved with a big oil company, I think it was Chevron.
L:  Mhm.  So --
R:  You know, um, they're just -- there's just no line drawn between government and corporations.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, they're in bed with each other.
L:  Mhm.  But I think a lot of this is still, when you mention the Security Exchange Commission, if you have a company -- like Enron, if you start dumping a lot of stock, you know, prior to --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- things like that should of been a red flag right there, and then the stock holders should of known, and I guess, I don't know, does the SEC fall under government control?  If, um --
R:  Yeah, well yeah --
L:  -- because they --
R:  -- the head of the SEC is appointed by the president.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And, ah, again, you know, the, ah -- they -- they're not strict, they look the other way.  For one thing they don't want to rock the market, they don't want to see the stocks go down --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and for another thing, you know, they're all buddies, they're all, ah, profiting --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and they're all, ah, drinking from the same trough.
L:  Same deal.  Which, which scares me when you see big government, and they want now, they just says, well, let's take all our money out of Social Security and let you invest it in, you know, you can do, you know, stocks and bonds or, you know, whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I'm just saying, I don't think that's a great idea, if you have all of this corruption --
R:  Oh, there's no way --
L:  -- you know, you could take --
R:  -- you would get me to do that.
L:  -- you -- to do that, you think, yeah.  This is off their topic, but it, it's --
R:  You know --
L:  -- still all the same with me.
R:  I'm on a pension --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and half of it is tied to the stock market.  It's variable -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- in other words if the market goes up my pension goes up --
L:  But that kind of thing, you would, you would get more --
R:  -- I've lost hundreds of dollars every month because of this.
L:  Mhm.  But they were saying you would get more with the other way that, you know, Bush --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- is planning it.
R:  At least my Social Security is fixed.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, it's a fixed amount.  I know I'm going to get it, I hope. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right, right.
R:  And, ah, there's no way I'm going to invest it in the stock market.
L:  Right.
R:  It's just too uncertain --
L:  But it would be, be invested with government controls.  That what they were saying, and I'm just gonna --
R:  Well, you know, the government are supposed to be controlling what's going on right now and I'm not impressed at all.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know.  I really don't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- trust them.  Um, they, ah, play around with Social Security money --
L:  Right, mhm.
R:  -- ah, they, you know, include it in their income with their budget amounts --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and ah, Social Security money is used to, ah, to finance government bonds --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they only pay something like -- a very low percentage.
L:  Mhm, yep.
R:  Ah, I really think they're cheating the, ah, Social Security fund --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they're using it for political purposes.  I just don't trust the government --
L:  Right.  Well you --
R:  -- ah, to go any further with my --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- retirement money.  I just don't.
L:  Well, you still think that, um, in light of everything else, that like the big corporations, should they -- should the government say, look, you cannot donate -- donate any money to any political action funds at all?  You think that would help with the corruption, if we put --
R:  I think so.  I really do.
L:  -- a -- I know there is a limit.  I know there's a personal limit on people, like two thousand dollars, that's as much you can donate to anybody --
R:  Yes, but the corporations, you know, ah, they contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they can get away with it, ah, and their officers, and they use relatives and friends --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but the corporations are not regulated as far as contributions the same as, ah --
L:  I was saying, if the government put a cap on --
R:  -- as individuals.
L:  -- the amount that they could donate --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- maybe, you know, a lot of people would stop looking the other way, because, you know, we're not greasing anybody's palms that way.  But I kind of figure they'll find some other way around it, would be the business trip --
R:  But, you know, there's another problem.  A lot of these corporation executives get jobs in the government, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the vice president, Condoleezza Rice --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I'm sure there are many others --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then a lot of the people who leave government agencies and positions, then they go and they're, you know, directors of corporations --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so --
L:  Right, they go into private industry.
R:  -- there, there's no separation.  There has to be legislation to separate.  And also the legislation that exists right now is not being enforced --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, people that committed criminal acts are getting away with it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and ordinary working people have lost a lot of money.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They've lost money in their retirement funds and their savings, you know, people who depended on their stock dividends to --
L:  Yeah, yeah absolutely.
R:  -- for their income.
L:  'Cause, you know, I lost all my [inaudible] my four oh one, you know --
R:  Oh dear.
L:  -- and I was like, oh my God, I'm still fairly young, but you know, I can get a bounce back, but a lot of these people, like if you've worked twenty and thirty and forty years for a place and then lose all your money, and, um, there -- they should be like, like a survivor fund.  That's what the government should have when those big corporations, um, fold under or go bankrupt, these people should at least get back twenty per cent or thirty per cent of their money.
R:  Yeah, but the trouble is the money doesn't go to investors.  Now, the government provided millions of dollars to airlines, you know --
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  -- who were going bankrupt --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but the investors and people who lost money on the stock market investing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in those airlines didn't get a penny.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They got nothing.
L:  Oh yeah, that's -- yeah.
R:  Ah, it's just -- I think the government is worried so much about protecting corporations --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they try to persuade us that, ah, if the corporations and business is all right, then the little people will be all right too, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's not necessarily so.
L:  Oh, I understand.  I, I see.  Well, what else was on that topic list? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Other than, ah, you know, I don't know -- and I guess, I guess we're sorta agreeing on this, um, I don't know, you're saying that government should just have more, um, legislation to prevent such a -- such things that have been happening in big business corruption.
R:  Or at least say when somebody is the head of a corporation they can't go right into government.  There should be a time lapse.  And when somebody leaves the government --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't think they should be able to go immediately to work for a corporation --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because if these deals are in the works, you know, they know that if you do what the corporations want, you're gonna get a nice job as a, a director, the directors make millions of dollars a year.
L:  Or you could become a lobby list -- a lobbyist. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, the lobbyists.  Oh, that's another story, yeah.
L:  That's like, you know, like Chaney and all of those, and Condoleezza Rice, you know, they were like lobbyists.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, prior to their, their, their -- they go to, um, give their clients -- you know, reflect their clients' best interests on the Hill, so favorable legislation
