L:  Katy.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name's, uh, Chris, I'm, uh, twenty four and I'm near Austin, Texas.
L:  Oh, I'm Katy, I'm, uh, twenty one and I'm from Boston.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, family.
R:  Yeah, family.  Not just another word, right? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, um, I don't know -- well, I guess sometimes I think that family is just the people that are related to you but --
R:  Well, that's the most --
L:  -- a lot of times --
R:  That's the most --
L:  -- I feel like -- what?
R:  That's the most simple -- that's the most simple definition, yeah.
L:  Yeah, but I definitely have found out that a lot of times family is like more about people that you can rely on and I know a lot of people who, um, are, uh, queer or homosexual who define family as the people that they can count on to be their allies.
R:  Mm.  Yeah, I see that -- and there's all kinds of communities, I think, uh, like the people in the community, you know, are just as much family as anyone who would be related to 'em by blood, you know.
L:  Right.  Do you have people that you call like uncle and aunt and stuff that aren't in your family?
R:  Not really, but I'm not particularly close with my blood family so -- I don't -- I mean like I'm more -- I'm closer with my friends.   I consider them --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well maybe like at least equal to my blood family, so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's -- it's pretty much always been that way --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for me.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I definitely have a lot of people that I grew up with in my life that, um, were like my parents' fraternity brothers and stuff like that and I grew up --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with my extended family really far away.  So, my father's, especially, fraternity brothers became like uncles and their wives like aunts and I call their kids my cousins and I hang out with them like they're my cousins so ...
R:  Well, the only thing I had like that was when I was younger and one of my mom's best friends called herself my aunt, you know --
L:  Mhm [NOISE].
R:  -- and her -- her daughter was my cousin, you know, so ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, of course I didn't choose that, they chose that but, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Yeah.  I don't know I guess now, I definitely have like friends that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I have friends that I have been friends with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for a really long time that I think of as family and -- oh, were, you know, we can go months and months without talking and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it'll still be the same kind of connection when we talk again even though a lot of time has passed.
R:  Right, that's the exact same kind of thing I have with my friends.  'Cause I just moved a couple of years ago and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I still -- I talk to them, you know, maybe -- maybe once or twice a month, maybe and I still feel real close to them.  I know when I go back there it will be just like I never left almost.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  I guess -- yeah [LAUGH] I hope. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  A lot of times [LAUGH].
R:  You hope?
L:  I think I count on that but then I'm like, "Oh wait, maybe it's not enough or a few too many months for some people". [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Sometimes the time and distance really do make, uh -- I'm not sure of the impact they have but I don't think it's gonna happen in my case.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] So --
L:  Uh, where did you relocate from?
R:  Uh, Tacole, Washington, about thirty miles south of Seattle.
L:  Oh. [NOISE]
R:  But, uh, yeah that's where my -- my god- -- my godkids are. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  I have, uh, a god -- a goddaughter and a godson.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're my best friends kids so that's another kind of definition for the use of family, I suppose.  Is, you know, you have godparents or something like that.
L:  Yeah.  My family became, um, estranged from --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like the people that were my godparents.
R:  Mm.
L:  And, uh, it was really weird, like I -- and their -- uh, the people that are my godparents, their children have my parents as their godparents.  And we ended up -- they needed up liking getting in a business dispute [NOISE] and we stopped talking to them completely.
R:  Oh.
L:  And that was like really weird because they definitely were good enough friends at one point so wanna include them in the family.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like equally, both parties are so, I don't know, that was kinda weird.
R:  Yes, I guess the family's kind fluid, [LAUGH] kinda change --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- can change based on events and whatnot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  But, uh, yeah, I don't know, I mean I wonder how many people do just think of families as the people who raised -- I'm mean my girlfriend, she's really into her family --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, a lot.  A lot more than I am into my family family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I don't know how many people really do think of fam- -- just their blood relations as their only family, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  I don't know I -- definitely like -- I don't know.
R:  Maybe it's a trend with -- with younger people, I don't know, to, you know, have a wider --
L:  Well --
R:  -- wider definition of family.
L:  Yeah, well I think especially in the United States since everybody's so mobile.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like, I mean, it's not uncommon for, you know, move from like all the way out in the Washington to Texas and, you know, to have people scattered everywhere that, you know, kind of become your family based on distance and who's around and like geographically who's available to fill in those family types of traditions.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  And I think, like, those people -- like in -- maybe in different parts of the world where you're around your family your entire life and, um, the population isn't as mobile, you tend to stick with blood relation with your family much more.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] But, I guess, in a lot tim- a lot of times, like, the community is an extension of your family maybe.  Based on the fact that your family isn't there a lot of the time and they maybe are blood relatives.
R:  [NOISE] I don't know it seems kind of opposite for me and my girlfriend, my girlfriend her parents worked overseas all the time, she really loves 'em and wants to be with them all the time.  But I lived with my parents and well, I didn't feel very close to them so ...  I mean they were great parents, I guess, in terms of providing but, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- didn't have to feel close to them but it's the reverse for my girlfriend though, kinda interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, uh, um, so --
L:  Well --
R:  Oh, go ahead.
L:  Oh, well I was gonna say I didn't really become close with my parents until I moved far away from them. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Really?
L:  Well, I think it was a matter of being able to choose when I communicated with them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And if I didn't wanna talk with them I could choose not to answer the phone [LAUGH] rather than having to, uh, see them every time I went to walk out the door.
R:  Yeah, well I think my girlfriend was away from her parents during her teenage years a lot.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Maybe that helped [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah. [NOISE].
R:  Okay.  What about closeness?  Do you think you have to be close to someone you consider family?  I mean 'cause, you know, I'm not particularly close with my blood relations but I -- they're family I guess.
L:  Well, I don't know, um, I [NOISE] I'm definitely at a point where I feel like it's real important to be close with people, especially my mother.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I think that's because her relationship with her mother was really tied and I know that, like, she needs to have that replicated in our relationship.
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  But I know a lot of people who aren't close with their family and they're just close with other people as a result.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I think you need to be close with some people in the same way that you'd be close with blood relatives or as traditionally perceived as how you would be close with blood relatives.  Because you -- you need some sort of support system.  Like I'm sure that you have a different kind of support system that's outside of your family.
R:  Yeah, well all my friends but, you know, I don't know -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't have that much of a support here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, don't have much of a family here.  Never really been too social since I've been here.  Just work a lo- just work a lot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And hang with my girlfriend. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you've got your girlfriend.
R:  Yeah, that's something. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, maybe right now you're in a place where your life isn't so complicated that you need a huge support system.
R:  Mm, that could be true, that could be true.  I suppose -- and maybe I would have looked for it if I needed it.
L:  Yeah, I think -- and you definitely like seek it out when you need it although some people just kind shrug off any closeness with any people.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  But --
R:  Yeah, I think, uh, I think family's becoming less and less important these days too to a lot of people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean even -- even including the definition of really close people like I -- I just keep getting the impression there's a lot of people out there who really like to be loners and don't mind [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, [MN] you know --
L:  I don't know I -- well I definitely, uh, uh, a one of those people -- like my family's definitely really important to me right now.  I definitely have, like, chosen to live where I do because this is where I grew and I don't want to move away from my family and I --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- don't wanna be really far away from them and thinking about grad school and stuff like, I'm like, "Oh my god, I might be on a different coast".  Like, that would be really weird [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, no, I wanna go back to where I'm from, that's where all my friend family is. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  So --
L:  It's hard though, it's hard to be like in a different place because you don't have the associations with it that --
R:  No, you don't.
L:  -- that you do in the place where you grew up or even just the place where you spent a large portion of your time.  Like I -- from my college in Boston --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I can see the building that my father works in 'cause it's like -- it's like a really tall building.  I can see it out the window from my classroom, it's pretty crazy. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow, that is close [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it's super close.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  But it's not -- it's not bad though, I mean it's like we don't have to force being together 'cause it's just like it's convenient sometimes and if I want to c- -- go to my parents house for dinner or something like that --
R:  Yeah, talk about it.
L:  -- and it's nice to know that that's there.
