L:  Hi, my name is Gloria. 
R:  Hi Gloria, my name's Karen. 
L:  What are we just supposed to listen for ten minutes? 
R:  [LAUGH] I think we're supposed to talk to each other for ten minutes. 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I thought it was to listen to them for ten minutes, and then talk afterwards. 
R:  Hu?
L:  I thought it was done the opposite way. 
R:  No, I don't -- I don't think so. 
L:  Okay.  Where are you from? 
R:  I'm from Iowa. 
L:  Wow, I'm in, uh, Texas. 
R:  Oh, that's straight south.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] No I'm just surprised.  And, uh, what kind of family do you have? 
R:  I have a ten year old son, and a fifteen month old daughter 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I'm expecting another son any day. 
L:  Oh, how wonderful. [LAUGH] No, both my children are grown.  I have a thirty two year old, and a forty year old. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, no grand children. [NOISE]
R:  Are they close by? 
L:  Yeah, we -- that -- just moved to Texas. Um, we're actually from Maryland.  But want to move closer to the children. 
R:  You don't sound like you're from Texas. [LAUGH]
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  [COUGH]
L:  [inaudible] [LAUGH] Okay, then what else are we supposed to speak about. [LAUGH] Family life, or 
R:  What does family mean to you. 
L:  Very important. 
R:  I thought that's what I heard him say. 
L:  Okay.  Alright.  To me it's very important, that's why we picked up and moved at our age.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you're not too old the move. It's -- 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it's a big change though. 
L:  It is -- it's a tremendous change.  Um, we used to live in Indianapolis now, and right on the water. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And Texas is definitely land locked, but we absolutely want to be near our children. 
R:  It's very different to you, but the cultures a lot different too. 
L:  We haven't found that yet.  [LAUGH] But we've --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- only been here a little bit.  [LAUGH] So, uh, ah, and, uh, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but it's great having -- being having -- being this close to our children.  Cause we have very little family left. 
R:  Oh, I bet.  I keep moving back to Iowa.  I've been -- been -- lived El Paso for a while. 
L:  Uh-huh. Okay.  Did you like that? 
R:  Mhm?
L:  Did you like living in El Paso? 
R:  It was okay.  [LAUGH] It's a border town.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  
R:  It was okay. 
L:  Yeah.  Wh- what does your husband do? 
R:  He's a Lawn Tech, he grows grass, and kills weeds and stuff. 
L:  Oh.
R:  We don't have a lot of grass down around Texas, do they? 
L:  No.  No.  Um, it just seems strange. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There aren't a lot of trees, or, um, -- well I guess the most that we miss is the water. 
R:  Oh, I bet. 
L:  Being around the water, and being so land logged, um, the way we are here -- but it has its compensations. 
R:  Right, but my mother lives down in Florida, and they don't have grass down there either. 
L:  Oh, wow. 
R:  It's that real sandy dirt down south I think.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But Alabama's nice though.
L:  You don't get to see your mum, too of- very often? 
R:  I haven't seen her for a couple of years now.  Been too busy having babies, to get down there.  [LAUGH]
L:  You got to take all of the babies and go see her.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, one of these days.  It's just --
L:  I mean, with air fares as low as they are right now.
R:  Yeah, I've been thinking about it.   It's still -- still quite a chunk of cash though. 
L:  Uh-huh. Well I don't know, um, I just got a ticket to go visit my niece in LA, and it was eighty nine dollars. 
R:  Really, from Texas? 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It was cheaper for me to fly to Tex- --out to LA to see her, than to go back east to visit friends. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So, I said I will go  go -- [LAUGH] cause we still  we have very little family.  And other than that -- well I'm assuming you're a homemaker. 
R:  A what? 
L:  A stay at home mum. 
R:  Oh, your kids are grown.  [LAUGH] 
L:  No you.
R:  Hu?
L:  You are? 
R:  No actually I'm still, well sort of working.  I was working full time. 
L:  Wow. 
R:  And I -- I plan on staying at home with the kids so, now. 
L:  I guess it must get expensive to pay for somebody. 
R:  Yeah.  Did you eat all of those French fries?  All of the French fries are gone. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  What are your children's names? 
R:  Um, little one's Grace, and my sons Blake. 
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  Are you expecting a girl or a boy this time? 
R:  A boy. 
L:  Hu. Bet you can't wait till it's over though.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I'm ready.  [SIGH]
L:  You're ready? 
R:  [LAUGH] I'm ready. 
L:  I remember that time, it's time for that to be -- done with and over. 
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  Just come home and be with your family again  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  Take advantage of the few days they might give you at the hospital. 
R:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  It sounds like a [inaudible] when the family goes to hospital.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's amazing how first time mums can't wait to know home, after that they --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Keep me in at least overnight.  [LAUGH]
R:  Home's boring. 
L:  Yeah it's boring, but still. 
R:  [COUGH] Watching the -- watch- watching the baby channels, and like your first one you have to give them a bath and stuff it's like hello. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, no, it amazes me was really, um, that how many people don't  -- can't handle little ones. 
R:  Can't handle. 
L:  Little one -- you know babies --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that haven't -- they just don't know.  I know one of my daughters in law is petrified.  She's afraid of become pregnant for that reason. 
R:  Oh, geez, they grow up so fast.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know, she says mum, are they gonna, [MN] how do you handle them?  What do you do with them?  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't want to break her.  [LAUGH]
L:  It sucks --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and especially when my daughter in laws older, so it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I guess she's getting a little concerned now too, cause she passed thirty five.  Still for the first one. 
R:  Wow, I'm forty. 
L:  Oh, I keep telling her, "This is the time, now or never".  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I was at the doctors office said I was too old to have any more kids -- face it you're not fifty yet. Geez.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Wow, oh, god I can't even imagine. 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Fifty and walking around like that. 
R:  Really. 
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's too much.  [LAUGH]
R:  I was a lot [inaudible] at thirty. 
L:  Yeah, it's always easier when you're younger.  That's why they say children belong to the young.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Yeah, it would be fun at their -- at the graduation, and be -- we have open houses.  It's kind of the local tradition to have an open house for your kids when they graduate from high school.  I can just see all her -- all her friends saying it was so nice of you grand mother to host an open house for you.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] God I can't even imagine having a child and paying for college, at this point. 
R:  We're just going to have to be really smart.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's almost threatening. 
R:  I'm really good at sports. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh. I'm -- I'm saying that's really that's frightening, because college is so darn expensive.  I mean, I think back, and when my younger one went and he's thirty three now, one year of his college equaled four years of my college. 
R:  Oh, gosh. 
L:  Tuition wise.  I -- I mean we were like [LAUGH] please -- but, um, well I -- we found out th- the hard way there are a lot of grants out there -- there are all kinds of money out there, if you have the time to look.  And that's what you have to -- you know.  But hopefully your kid will be very smart and win scholarships.  [LAUGH]
R:  I hope so. 
L:  [SIGH] Do you have any idea what this whole fisher experiment is? 
R:  I think they're just -- just listening to how people talk to each other.  From different areas of the country and things. 
L:  Okay.  Alright --I really have no idea.  Um, somebody signed me up, and I got an email this morning and I went, "Oh",  [LAUGH] "Okay". 
R:  I thought it sounded like fun. 
L:  So, um, --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- no it really can be very interesting meeting, and talking to people from all over the country. 
R:  Yeah, I was a little worried about what kind of topics they'd give you though. 
L:  Well, you, um, -- from what I understand you don't have to accept a topic. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  You can go on to something else, like they'll call you back for it. 
R:  Or you can call in too, I think. 
L:  Oh, that I didn't see.  But, um, yes you can -- hu. 
R:  Like two, three different calls or something. 
L:  Okay.  That's not -- well see three different calls.  Is that all they're gonna do is three calls? 
R:  Yeah, I think that's all they need any one person eligible to do is three, and then call if they want to do another one, [SIGH] with ten calls or something, or nine calls that you had to use five different telephones. 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right. 
R:  I don't have five different telephones, and I don't want to go sit over at the neighbors either. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] No, not really. 
R:  [SIGH]
