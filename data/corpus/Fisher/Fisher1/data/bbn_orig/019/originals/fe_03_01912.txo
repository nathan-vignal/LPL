R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, my name is Patty.
R:  Hi, Patty, I'm Erin.
L:  Hi, Ann.
R:  Erin.
L:  Erin, hi.
R:  Yeah, hi.  Where are you calling from?
L:  I'm calling from California.  And you?
R:  Oh, North Carolina.
L:  North Carolina.
R:  So ...
L:  Is your family in North Carolina? [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, no, my family is in Florida.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I am here in graduate school.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  What about you?
L:  Um, my family is in Indiana.  I actually have some cousins in North Carolina.
R:  Oh, nice.  What part?
L:  Um, they're in -- in the Rawleigh general area.
R:  Okay, that's where I am.
L:  It's some small town outside.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- all of you- -- you grew up in Florida?
R:  I did.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I did.  I just came to North Carolina for graduate school.  And, um, actually this topic is interesting to me because I am going to be looking for a job very soon and where I, um -- I'm trying not to look for a job in places that are far -- very far away from my family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm really close with them and, uh, talk to my --
L:  You mean parents, cousins, aunts, uncles?
R:  Yeah, mostly, uh, parents and, um, and aunts.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, I'm an only child.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't have siblings, um -- yeah, so it's important for me to try to live close although I'm looking for -- I'm looking at a company in, uh, California.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] Um --
L:  [LAUGH] What's your area?
R:  Uh, I'm in linguistics.
L:  Oh, really.  I'm a linguist.
R:  Are you?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It doesn't surprise me because [LAUGH] those -- it's a Harvard --
L:  People interested in this kind of data--
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- collection.
R:  Right, Harvard Linguistics is doing this, I think.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, uh, and what about you?  What does the word family mean to you?
L:  Well, um, they're people who, even though they may not like you, [LAUGH] can't get rid of you. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  And they share a history although it's been extended in a strange way recently like I have a twin brother who, um, just found out an ex girlfriend of his had a baby twenty five years ago --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that she [LAUGH] never mentioned to him.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] But it turns out to be his. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you're kidding.
L:  Mm.
R:  Oh wow! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What a surprise.
L:  So, I have a niece who is twenty five years old that I never heard about.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  Wow!
L:  So, in -- in some sense that's family --
R:  But it --
L:  -- but somehow the -- the relationship of seeing somebody grow up and seeing somebody -- you know, knowing somebody since you were little or seeing somebody since they were little is --
R:  Right.
L:  -- more of the feeling of family to me than -- than some biological bond that--
R:  Right.
L:  -- you can only tell if you run some tests.
R:  Right, absolutely.  Um, my -- I mentioned I'm very close with my aunt and, um, she -- she divorced, um, the guy that I kind of think of as my uncle and, uh, remarried --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I cannot bring myself to call this man Uncle Dan.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, he doesn't feel like family to me.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  They've been married for maybe three or four years --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, I think it maybe doesn't help the situation that he's kind of not a nice person.
L:  Oh yeah --
R:  -- but --
L:  -- especially if you like the aunt that's got to be un- --
R:  Yeah, yeah, I like the aunt a lot and, um, it's -- it's interesting I m- -- I don't know being southern you kind of grow up calling people aunt that aren't your aunt.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I remember my mom had a good friend that I was called Aunt Jackie that was not any relation to me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just one of mom's friends 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that she wanted me to kind of show deference to.  So, you stick an aunt in front of that [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but I don't know if that would make --
L:  Yeah, actually my -- the best friend of my graduate thesis adviser asked me to call him Uncle Doctor Arthur. [LAUGH]
R:  Uncle Doctor [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's Arthur Abramson, I don't know if you did any phonetics but --
R:  Um, I did I -- although that name doesn't --
L:  Yeah, they're the voice onset time guys.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay, yeah, absolutely.  Got ya.  Uh, what is your area in linguistics now?
L:  Um, most phonetics.  After --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- after -- after graduate school in linguistics I did a post stock in electrical engineering and MIT and --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- then ended up doing mostly speech recognition since then.
R:  Oh, cool.  Very cool.
L:  Although now I'm, um, doing consulting and getting involved in, um, using speech technology and language education so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that's a lot of fun.
R:  That's very interesting.  Um, in ESL or just in --
L:  Well, more generally but a lot of the -- a lot of the, um, interest is in, um, ESL and --
R:  Okay.
L:  What about you?
R:  I am studying reading acquisition.
L:  Oh really?  I'm really interested in that area too.  I'm also tutoring reading --
R:  Oh wow, that's great.  I'm -- I'm trying to, uh, hopefully land a job with Leapfrog.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They're based out there in California.
L:  That's right.  Well, one of the -- one of the --
R:   Nice area.
L:  -- company -- [LAUGH] I started a company that had a spin off company that does reading --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and they had hired somebody who came from Leapfrog --
R:  Wonderful.
L:  -- and -- and I had done a project with the guys at Broderbund[?] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- who are now at, um, Leapfrog.  So, that sounds like a --
R:  Oh neat.
L:  -- good company.
R:  Neat.  So, is all of that out there in California?
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Okay, so that's kinda --
L:  Well, actually the spinoff company -- the reading company is in Boston.
R:  Okay, what's the name of it?
L:  It's called -- I named it Sups but now it's called Soliloquy Learning.
R:  Soliloquy Learning.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Huh.
L:  And the idea is to use speech recognition to track as a child reads.
R:  Oh, interesting.  Interesting.
L:  The project I'm now trying to get linguists interested in is, um, that you might be interested in, is rewriting text to a lower reading level.  Because in the kids I tutor --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- once they get more than a year or two behind the real problem is that stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're interested in is too hard for them to read.  
R:  Right.
L:  And stuff that's at their reading level is too babyish.
R:  Right.
L:  So, if you could translate vocabulary and grammar, um, somehow--
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- make it more accessible there would be more text of interest --
R:  Ha.
L:  -- to them.
R:  That's -- that's interesting.  I've, um -- I think leap frog does something like that actually.  High interest, low level.
L:  Mhm, right.  Introducing books, high -- the high low series.
R:  Right. 
L:  But I -- I think -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- it's a technology not too much more difficult than things that people are doing automatically, and I can't figure out why --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- people aren't doing research in this area.
R:  Huh.
L:  For, you know, automating the process.
R:  That's very interesting.
L:  What's your thesis topic?
R:  Um, onset rhyme awareness and reading acquisition --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a balanced approach. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I'm trying to finish it up, um, this month.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I'm -- I'm kind of at a standstill.  I haven't, uh, run any data yet so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, yeah we'll see. 
L:  Yeah, are you -- do you have to treat dyslexia and dealing with that or sort it out or ...?
R:  Um, not -- not in my thesis, um, particularly although I'm interested in it, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm looking -- I'm kind of replicating a study by Rebecca Trayman[?], um, whether or not onset rhyme awareness is a strategy that kids can use when they're learning letter sounds.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, letters, um -- let's see, letter sounds that occur in the onset of the letters name like the letter B make a sound Ba.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And Ba is the onset of its name.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Those are much easier for kids to learn than when the, um, letter sound comes, say in the decode --
L:  Like W. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, like W, for sure or, like, even an L where it's in the name --
L:  Mhm, mhm, mhm.
R:  -- of the decoder.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We've got W and H and Y, those are really hard.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, you know, and then I'm trying to tie it in, you know, on a grander scale, onset rhyme awareness and, like, there's a body of research out there using orthographic analogies that, uh, you can kind of get into that cycle of reading where you have to learn a segment but you don't get good at segmentation until you, um, have some experience reading and you don't get good at reading until you can segment and, um, you know, kind of my proposition is that onset rhyme awareness is a way into that so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's interesting.  Are there any other linguists in your family?
R:  No.  Unfortunately, um, my uncle is a rhetorician in California.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, maybe I could just go visit him.  Uh, yeah, I suppose we need to go back to the family ...
