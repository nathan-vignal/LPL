R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  My name is, ah, Marcus Bean[?].
L:  My name is Rachel.
R:  Okay.  Where are you calling from, Rachel?
L:  I'm calling from Massachusetts.
R:  Okay.  I'm calling from Washington DC.
L:  Ah, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Our -- our -- our nation's capital.
R:  Yes, yes, yes. [LAUGH]
L:  So, how has corporate scandal hurt you?
R:  Well, corporate scandal can hurt me in, um, a different way, than, say, if I wanted to start a business on my own.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, it can hurt and put lock down on certain criterias in starting a different business and how many people can be a part of the business, or if I'm a part of a business that's in the corporate scandal, we also can be left out in the cold, like, loss of job and then depending on the, ah, credibility of the company and people find out that you work with that company, could lower your chances of getting a job somewhere else.
L:  Mhm, mhm. 
R:  In that area -- in, you know, for another company because they figure that if that company has a scandal and you was working for that company, that, um, you just as guilty as the next person that works there.
L:  Mm.  Yeah, that's true, it does, you know, guilt by association, yeah, that's true.
R:  Right.
L:  I think that -- I think it hurt the economy as a whole because I think a lot of people stopped -- well, I think a lot of people lost money in the stock market and because of that, a lot of people stopped investing and I think that that hurts the economy as a whole, um, because I know a lot of stocks are not doing as well as they probably should, um.
R:  Right.
L:  I know it's affected me because, you know, we have a good deal of stock in my husband's company which is what he got when he signed in with the company.
R:  Mhm.  So they are basically part of his salary, and whenever he gets bonuses, a lot of those bonuses come in the forms of stock certificates, and unfortunately, they're virtually worthless to us at this point.  You know, two years ago, they were worth, you know, several hundred thousand dollars and today, they're barely worth the paper that they're printed on, so, you know, we -- we kind of sit here saying, "Gee, I hope the stock market would do well because then we wouldn't have to get an equity loan", you know, to, ah, you know, repave our driveway or something, you know, when we could just be cashing in stock which is, you know, what we would like to do. [COUGH]
L:  You know, so I think -- I think all of that corporal -- corporate scandal has hel- -- has really, um, put a damper on many people, you know.  Um, not just from a working perspective but also from the stock market and the way the economy moves.
R:  Right.  Because, um, even myself, I want a, um, -- I mean, my company is not under no scandal but because of the, um, economy, and because I invested a lot of mo- -- money into the stock, the value of the stock is not worth -- 
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  Is not worth anything.
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- I -- hear you there, you know.  I mean, a year ago -- you know, I -- I -- I remember three or four years ago, you know, looking at my husband's company.  It was like a hundred dollars a share, and, you know, now, he comes home and says, "Oh, we broke thirty five today" and it's like, "Hurray".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I mean, just [LAUGH] and, you know, you're looking for that small little jump, you know.  He was talking the other day about selling at forty dollars a share and I'm sitting here thinking, you know, four years ago we would have laughed at such a thought, you know.
R:  Right, right. 
L:  But, um, I don't know.  I -- I -- I don't know what the government can do about corporate scandal and, ah, -- except put may- maybe, um, stiffer penalty -- well, not really stiffer penalties, but maybe stiffer regulations on auditing.  Um, you know, I think that, you know, these fortune five hundred companies and these really big corporations that have stockholders like this, I think they really need to be audited on a yearly basis by an independent auditing firm.
R:  Exactly, exactly. 
L:  Um, you know, and -- and I think audits need to be done on the auditing firms.  I mean, you know, I think that's the only way.  Unfortunately we live in a society where not only do people, um, you know, move around in a -- in a vicarious position, but they also, I don't think people really take their jobs all that seriously any more.
R:  No.
L:  So I think mistakes are made whether intentionally or unintentionally, and I think the only way to get around that is to do more checking.
R:  Oh, yes, and because if -- if they start doing a check and balance on, um, corporate America, [LAUGH] they already complained about how the government does a check and balance on each other.  That might curtail some of the, ah, the -- the scandal, but like you say, it depends on the individuals that they're hiring and it also depends on the -- 
L:  Yeah, and I -- and I think -- I think that they should also [SIGH] -- I think they should also when they find these, um, you know, things that have -- have been done illegally and knowingly done illegally, I think they really need to push these people's buttons and put them where they belong.  I mean, I think they need to set examples of these people, you know.  I don't know how many, ah, Enron executives are actually going to end up behind bars, but I don't think there's going to be too many of 'em.
R:  No.
L:  And I -- and I certainly don't think it's the top level, you know, that are going to end up behind bars.
R:  Right, and then it also goes on the -- on the -- on the -- on the fact of if the person was on the inside working for Enron or any company for that matter, how much information do they know and did -- you can look at it one or two ways.  Did they try to tell someone about it? 
L:  Mhm, yeah. 
R:  Did they try to, you know, stop the practices that were going on? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or did they get, like, a little pay off like, okay, you know that we're [LAUGH] that we're doing something -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- illegal you know -- 
L:  And not only -- 
R:  -- you scratch my back.
L:  And -- and once they're caught, are they -- are they then paying off, you know, these big lawyers to get them off the rap you know, to blame it on to somebody else?  I mean, you know, it just seems that the more money you have and the more money you can steal, the better off your chances of getting away with it.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, which -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- which unfortunately has just multiplied over the years, you know.  It just, um -- it -- it just seems to me that if someone has stolen, you know, a billion dollars, they should be in the same prison with, you know, everybody else, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean they shouldn't be -- 
R:  It's almost like a repeat performance of like, OJ Simpson --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or one of those big type trials like, okay, he is very known, well known.
L:  Yeah, and he's going to get off, yeah. 
R:  Uh-huh, let's get a dream team together and we're going to play this out as long as possible.
L:  That's right, that's right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I -- I think the -- I think the -- I think the government has to be more focussed on, um, you know, things that are really illegal and things that are, you know, just savvy business moves like the whole, you know, trying to get Bill Gates and Microsoft.  I mean -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think that was just a total waste of money.  I mean, they -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they couldn't prove any wrong doing.  There's -- there was nothing devious that Microsoft was doing.  I mean, they weren't trying to bilk people out of money, I mean, or anything like that.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, they were trying to make a buck for themselves but isn't that the reason we are in business? 
R:  Right.
L:  Maybe instead of spending a billion dollars chasing Bill Gates, maybe we could have spent a billion dollars getting Osama bin Laden.
R:  And that was just a jealousy factor because of -- he had the -- 
L:  That's all it was.  That's all it was.  I mean, Bill Gates has never done anything illegal in his life.  He gives billions of dollars to charity every year.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, Microsoft employs more -- more people than anybody else in the world.  They give to so many charities and yet they went after them with a vendetta as though they were organized crime.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I mean, I just think that the government is misplaced in, you know, what they're trying to do.  You know, I -- you know, it's all a political thing and -- I think this whole, um, corporate scandal thing has just, you know, I -- I think it's fallen by the wayside.  You don't even hear about it any more.
R:  No.  And then -- then once it gets into the scandal, then it gets into [inaudible] well, this is our first amendment right.  We have the freedom to do this or we have the freedom to do that.
L:  Oh, yeah, they all have the right, yeah, they have the right to do everything, yeah.
R:  And -- and then it brings up a whole different ball game, like, wait a minute, you just -- [LAUGH] you just embezzled millions of dollars of the company's money for something that doesn't have any fancy business or you just sold -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the money, you know, what I mean? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, -- yeah, I -- I don't understand it.  I don't understand it but -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, it -- it just seems that the government has really misplaced their, ah, loyalties and, um -- 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- and, you know, really misplaced where they should be putting their efforts, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  I think, um -- 
R:  Then it goes back to, like, even if you start in a corporation, what type of, um, ah, rules are in place so when a person decides to start up a corporation, what type of procedures do they have to go through? 
L:  Yeah, to make it -- to make it -- 
R:  On a check and balance all the way from the time that the company signs the document and go into a corporation or do they just, okay, this is what you need to do, X, Y and Z, follow this and then you have your corporation.
L:  Yeah.  But unfortunately, the, um, unfortunately it's the little guy with the small company that's going to, um, pay because he's not -- he's not going to be able to follow all these procedures that are in place because of these, you know, big corporations and --
