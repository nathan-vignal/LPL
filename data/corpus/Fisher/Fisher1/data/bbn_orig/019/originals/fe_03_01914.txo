R:  Hello?
L:  Hello. My name's Doris.
R:  I'm Jessica.
L:  Nice to talk to you.
R:  Nice to talk to you too.
L:  So, I guess I want us to talk about family, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And what it means.
R:  Oh, what, I mean, it depends on what your family is like, I guess.
L:  Mhm. Well, I have six kids, so, -- [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I have two.
L:  Mhm.  So, if you want to go first and say what it means, you can. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay. [NOISE] Well, I mean it just means that -- shit, I have never even really thought about it --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [LAUGH] 'til just now.
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, I guess it means being together and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Sharing, you know, life with each other.
L:  Yeah, helping each other, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  God, it's going to be like ten minutes is going to be forever.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] Um, just be there to support each other, and do everything.
L:  Mhm.  And, and raise the kids together, not just one parent doing it, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and all the discipline, and all the, you know, things you have to do when you have kids, and --
R:  Mhm.  A whole family can be a single parent home too, though.
L:  Oh, yeah, I know, but I'm, you know.
R:  It doesn't always work --
L:  No, but --
R:  -- the way you want it to.
L:  -- even, you know, the single parents, I, you know, the other parents should help.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, hm, how old are your kids?
L:  Um, I have five boys, sixteen, fifteen, eleven, nine, and five, and my girl is thirteen.
R:  Mm, well, --
L:  How old are yours?
R:  Mine are three and one.
L:  Mm, well, little ones?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I love those ages.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, they're fun.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] This is only my second one so I'm still trying to get the hang --
R:  Yeah, this is actually my second one too, I --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I've never done it, you know, I haven't really done it a whole lot, so, --
L:  No, and the woman, yeah, an older woman last night, you know, she did most of the talking, so it was like, "Phew! Thank God!" [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah -- [LAUGH] yeah, I kind of got one like that yesterday too.
L:  [MN] I think they do that the first time. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Um, let's see, well, um, are you and your husband still married, or --?
L:  Yeah, we've been together seventeen years, married --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- but together nineteen.
R:  Wow.
L:  [MN] And you?
R:  I've only been married three.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Three years.
L:  Seems like forever, though, sometimes --
R:  Oh, yeah [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] See, that's another thing about family, being able to put up with each other [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah, getting used to their habits, and --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Getting used to each other.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I would think after seventeen years, though, you'd probably ... pretty used to each other.
L:  Oh, yeah, but you know, still, the -- you know, after that long them little habits start really getting annoying [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [MN] Yeah, the ones that you think are cute at first.
L:  Yeah, then you're like "Oh, my God, he's doing it again! Stop!" [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] I don't know, see, that's another thing, having fun, you know, as a family, and --
R:  Mhm, going out, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, it's definitely interesting when you go to dinner with a one and a three year old.
L:  Oh, yeah [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I remember when mine where little, it's, you know, one had to go to the bathroom, the other one wanted to get down and walk around the restaurant --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and I'm like, "Oh, Lord" [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  So are mine already.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  My older one's getting a lot better now, but -- he's always been good in restaurants, so ...
L:  Mhm.  Now mine, forget it, well, you know, when you have like six of 'em--
R:  Oh, my goodness.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] they're all in different directions. [PAUSE]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, um, well, I mean, I just think a family should be there to support you no matter what you're doing, and everything.
L:  Mhm.  Yep, and not judge you.
R:  Huh?
L:  I said, "And not judge you", you know.
R:  Mhm.  Not be judgmental of anything that you do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's for sure.  And, you know, just be supportive and take care of each other, really.
L:  That's, that's right, that's the most important --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And make sure everybody's happy, because if one of them's not happy, the rest of them, forget it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Or they'll try to make everybody else --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- unhappy.
L:  Yeah!
R:  Anyhow, you've got to be happy.  Everybody's got to be happy or it won't work.
L:  That's right.
R:  [MN]
L:  It's hard to come out with, you know, when they call, you're not ready?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And then you never know what that topic's going to be, and it's like, "Oh, um, oh, ah, I don't know what to say" [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I guess they're gonna, you know, expect that from people first starting out.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, they can't really get that much from people.
L:  No. 
R:  Um, [LAUGH] ... just spending quality time with each other, I guess.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] Well, just, you know, quality time, having fun, being together, helping each other.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I figure, you know, if all the kids are okay by the end of the day then they pretty, I did a pretty good job.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] That's what I always, that's how I always figure it out.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah -- do you work, or --
L:  No.
R:  Oh.
L:  No.  Stay home all day [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I'm actually going to school, still, so ...
L:  Mhm.  That's good though.
R:  Yeah.  So I really do need the, you happen, help, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And stuff, you know, [NOISE] I'm home during the day, but, at, you know, I'm at school most of evening.
L:  Yeah, but then when you come home and there's like ten thousand other things you need to do --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- before you can think about call 'em to bed and then go to bed and there's still a lot of things you didn't get to.
R:  Yeah.  Well, my husband's pretty good about that, you know --
L:  Mhm.  That's good.
R:  You know, he usually, you know, he's the one that usually makes dinner, 'cause I'm really not here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, except on the weekend, naturally, but.
L:  Yeah.
R:  After he gets home, I play a girl, I go "Hey, honey, okay, I'm leaving, bye!"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, so I don't really see him a lot during the week.
L:  Nah.  So [MN] you do a lot of things together?
R:  Well, on the weekends we usually, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, we're always doing stuff.
L:  That's how it is here.
R:  Yeah.  During the week, it's kind of hectic, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he wants to do something, he has to take the kids with him, or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, if I have stuff to do during the day, then I take the kids with me, but --
L:  Mhm?  Let's see, that's, you know, that's, that's working together even though you're not together?
R:  Mhm?
L:  Doing it, you're each kind of part, in the, you in the day and him in at night.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So it works out, that's, you know, another thing about helping each other.
R:  Yeah.  And it won't be for that much longer, you know, after, I only got a year left, so --
L:  Mhm.  What are you going to school for?
R:  Um, business.
L:  Mhm, that's good.
R:  You know, and my Masters in business, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'll be done hopefully next summer.
L:  That's good though.
R:  Yeah.  And then, I can just start working and we'll both be at work at the same time --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  We won't actually get to see each other, but --
L:  No.
R:  But, yeah.  He's really good about it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I don't think, I don't think I could be going to school if he wasn't.
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's, you know, a lot of people, they wouldn't look at it like that, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but --
R:  [MN]
L:  That's a good way to look at it, though.
R:  Yeah, I mean he has to be around, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- able to do it.  I can't do when he's here, you know, when I'm not here.
L:  No, that's right.
R:  [MN] So. Yeah --
L:  I think they make this over ten minutes --"No!" [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. I don't know, I think it's just that, you know, you have to be a team, and pull together.
L:  Yeah.  And even, you know, like, not talking about husband and wife and the kids, but like, the extended family --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Mine helps me a lot, so --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  That's a good thing, too.
R:  Baby-sitters are always
