L:  Oh.
R:  So, I don't lack much of socially because always have my family, and besides that the off spring of the family which is the kids, and nieces, great nieces, and nephews, so I never long for  [LAUGH] you know, a social life -- so basically my family is that. 
L:  Gosh.
R:  I myself have, uh, two kids, a son twenty and a daughter thirteen, I'm a divorced father, and single parent raising them -- so you know I can see how family is quite important in my life and -- and a big aspect of my life.  And, uh, I try to instill those same values in my kids, and tell them the importance of family --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and how you know we should, uh, keep the, uh, tightness, and closeness, because, uh, basically that's all we have. 
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, well I just, um, live with my mum, and my brother, and, um, -- well the only family that's really close to where I live is my mum, and my brothers, since I live with them.  And my grand parents live -- so I see them a lot, and they're important to me [inaudible].

L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's funny. 
R:  And, uh, I don't know I've just always, uh, you know, wanted to get out that far. 
L:  Oh, that's neat. 
R:  It's great.  Uh, um, and, uh, you know, um, [inaudible] I come from a very huge family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which means, uh, always something to do -- always a birthday to celebrate, always you know, another kid or niece born.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. Uh-huh.
R:  That's basic- -- my life evolves around family cause I don't do much socially --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I'm involved, uh, --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- family, you know, come from such a large one. 
L:  That would be nice --
R:  And --
L:  -- I guess.
R:  -- consequently I have a [inaudible] for kids.  I'm a schoolteacher, um, forty eight years old, and I'm a single parent, so, you know -- kids are my life. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  And I teach elementary, and intermediate, which is, uh, middle school.
L:  Wow. 
R:  But anywhere from, uh, K to about the eighth or ninth grade. 
L:  Oh, so do you teach a subject or --
R:  Um, no basically I do a little bit of them all.  I don't have a -- a certain area of concentration. 
L:  Oh, 
R:  I just do a little bit of them all [LAUGH] and, uh. 
L:  Oh, hu, are you a substitute?
R:  Uh, yes basically now I'm a --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- substitute now -- I just -- I just retired from the city from one job.
L:  Oh.
R:  So I'm trying to start another career in the school board.  And, um, so I basically like to stay to the smaller kids I am substituting now. 
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Full position open. 
L:  Smaller kids would be more pleasant --
R:  Well you know what, plus --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- Uh, I- I'm in a -- I'm from Philadelphia. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [inaudible] they are from urban area, uh, I -- I kind of like the smaller kids, because I've been with the older ones, and it's been kind of rough in the urban setting. 
L:  Oh.
R:  See a public school can be quite -- quite challenging. 
L:  Yeah, if I was going to be a teacher, I would not want to teach --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- older kids cause seeing how they treat their teachers.
R:  And believe me --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I've been a recipient of some of them, and I [inaudible] so I can't really deal with the older kids because they're just  it's just too much.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And believe me in this day and age, uh, uh, um, I retired for the [inaudible] for the city. 
L:  Oh.
R:  You know I had eighteen years with them. 
L:  Oh.
R:  I just got out of it, and when I was walking to the school dealing with children, I just said, "damn, this basically wasn't any much different than being in a prison than being in a school". 
L:  That's funny.
R:  [inaudible] [LAUGH].  And, uh, you know -- so you know really teaching can be quite dangerous now too. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  As you can see it happens in the news so much [inaudible] you know, you never know what you're facing.
L:  Yeah, I wouldn't --
R:  And --
L:  -- want to teach high school at all. 
R:  Uh, you know me, I did it a [inaudible] high school a couple of weeks ago and I told them I wouldn't come back again. 
L:  [LAUGH] Why, were they like really rude? 
R:  It was a very good experience.
L:  Oh. 
R:  And, uh, not many of the kids, uh, um, -- just don't have much respect to teachers like they did when I was in school. 
L:  No, they don't seem to have much respect for much of any thing
R:  Right.  And when I went to school the teacher was like somebody you looked up to, who -- when they said something you, you know, you got to chill -- oh, I better -- and they look at you and tell you, you know, hey you know, this is basically the way that I am, and -- so I don't want to really, uh, wanna deal on that level again.  And I find that little ones I can reach better, and you know, you can just, uh, -- how can I put it I just feel that they're more receptive, [LAUGH] you know. 
L:  Yeah [inaudible] think probably --
R:  You know so -- basically -- and I think now with the break down of the family, and you can see the results of that break down on the school.  A lot more kids are coming from broken homes.  A lot of them coming from one parent homes, and there are a lot of them coming from homes where they've been raised by grandparents, who, you know, um, -- I don't know, uh, [inaudible] coming from this generation that got lost and they got caught up [inaudible] and drugs, and other life style which left, uh, grandparents raising a lot of kids and  -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, sometime I look around the school and parents and coming up and a lot of times it's the grandparents coming up. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And with the break down of the -- you know, you can see that, uh, -- you can see the result of that in the kid.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  So, that's why, you know, I try to help my kids and my nieces just how important their family is -- and, you know, it doesn't matter who raises them, just as long as somebody raises them who -- you know.
L:  Yeah, [inaudible] it's better when the parents can be around more.
R:  Oh, without a doubt.  And I was raised too basically by myself.
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  And --
L:  -- My mum, did too.
R:  -- and they basically did a good [inaudible] I gotta daughter that's a straight A student at thirteen.  [inaudible] uh, college.  [inaudible] Are you -- you sound real young.
L:  Yeah, I'm nineteen.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My kid's your age.  [LAUGH].  I'm forty seven.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's twice your age.  Are you out of school yet?
L:  Um, I am out of high school, but I went to college for a year and a half, and I'm not going this year.
R:  Okay. 
L:  This semester.  
R:  [inaudible] Okay.
L:  I was trying to work so I could earn enough money to get a car, and I was going to go back next semester --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but I think like I might join the military or something, because then I'll get a lot more money and be able to get school for free. 
R:  Good move -- good move  -- that's what, uh, my son was moving towards too.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah -- yeah. 
L:  What branch does he want to join. 
R:  Uh, marines.

R:  Okay.  And that's [inaudible] always want to join the marines too.  Why --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I just want to wear the uniform.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [inaudible]
L:  Guys in uniform get lots of admiration.
R:  I was always impressed by how they were -- they just look like, you know -- you had to be in tip top shape and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they just looked there.  [LAUGH]
L:  My brother wants to become a marine.
R:  Oh, man, this is something about the marine that, you know -- I just see.  [LAUGH]
