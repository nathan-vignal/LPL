R:  Hello? 
L:  Hi. 
R:  Hi I'm Melissa Alexander.
L:  Hi Melissa, how you doing?  My name's Jason Gallagher. 
R:  Hi Jason, nice to meet you. 
L:  Nice to meet you too. 
R:  Okay I guess the topic is family? 
L:  Yeah, it's a pretty cool topic. 
R:  Yeah, and that's easy to talk about. 
L:  It is easy to talk about. 
R:  Everybody has one.  [LAUGH]
L:  Everybody has one and, you sure can't choose them. 
R:  Exactly -- well family means to me, one of the most important things in the world.  I come from a large family, um, I have seven sisters and brothers and I'm --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- the baby.
L:  Do you really? 
R:  Yeah I'm the baby. 
L:  Wow. 
R:  And on my dad's side, uh, there was twelve of them. 
L:  Wow. 
R:  Yeah and I have eighteen nieces and nephews. 
L:  Wow that's so cool. 
R:  So Christmas for us is absolutely fantastic. 
L:  I bet -- I -- I -- gees. 
R:  Yes, absolutely fantastic.  Each of us -- each of the children my brothers and sisters we're all different and  and, you know, all unique in our own little unique ways, but I mean I have four sisters -- four sisters and three brothers. 
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's super cool.
R:  Four sisters and three brothers -- I'm the baby. 
L:  I guess you're hoping for grandchildren. 
R:  Oh God, yes -- yes I'm the baby of all of the [inaudible] and of course was a little spoilt by mum and dad. 
L:  Sure. 
R:  'Cause I'm six years behind the next one older than me. 
L:  Oh, wow. 
R:  I kind of snuck along.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right you snuck up on them, that's cool. 
R:  She was supposed to be the baby, but here I come.
L:  That's cool.
R:  And, um, it's very important to me family and I've been married for, like, five years now -- I'm with -- married my High School sweetheart. 
L:  Oh, that's so cool. 
R:  Yeah [inaudible] --
L:  It's like a storybook. 
R:  Yeah, we started dating in eighty three, and we date for fifteen years and then we've gotten married in nineteen ninety eight.
L:  Wow, okay.
R:  We've been married since nineteen ninety eight -- so we've been together for twenty years. 
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  I'm thirty six and we've been together for twenty years. 
L:  Oh, okay, wow. 
R:  And, uh, we have one son and --
L:  Wow, the way you -- you came up I would of totally thought you were older than that. 
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Thank you. 
L:  That's cool, I would of thought, you know, [inaudible] --
R:  Thank you very, very much. 
L:  Wow. 
R:  I have one son who is three and he is my entire world. 
L:  Wow. 
R:  He's the first of hopefully three children that we'll have, and I'm a stay at home mum because I believe that if you can afford to have either the husband or wife stay home, the children to me in my opinion, because this is -- this is what I was raised up in.  Uh, mum was a stay at home mum, and my dad he worked, so I think that a child gets that one on one attention starting from birth, up until you know whenever, there is that one on one attention -- there's that security that either mum --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or dad is always gonna be there. 
L:  Awesome.
R:  And -- and it's really -- I mean my husband and I started dating and talking about marriage and everything like that -- that's one thing we talked about in the beginning -- when we start having children we want to be somewhat financially okay. 
L:  Sure.
R:  Where as, you know, I could at least stay home and stay home with -- with our son or either stay home and work from home.
L:  Right.
R:  And be there with him at least until he gets in school -- all day and then that'd be first grade and then what I'll do then is I'll go to work after I get him to school and then hopefully I'll have a job where I'll get out and be home by the time he gets home.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's great. 
R:  Yeah, but family it's -- it's -- it's everything to me, and, um, I talked to my brothers and sisters -- [SIGH] I mean a different one every night. 
L:  Wow. 
R:  I have one in Florida --
L:  That's really neat.
R:  -- I have one in Pennsylvania -- I have one in Connecticut -- I have one, two, three sisters here in Michigan. 
L:  You're in -- is that where you are? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I'm in Michigan -- I'm about twenty miles out from, um, Detroit -- I'm in a suburb called Flinton Township. 
L:  Nice.
R:  Yes, so what about your family?  What does your family mean to you? 
L:  Well a lot of the things that you said --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- are extremely similar, and a lot of things that are extremely converse. 
R:  Yes. 
L:  Um, I'm uh -- I'm actually thirty three --
R:  Okay. 
L:  And, uh, I have two children but first I guess I should say that family to me, if you could put it in two words it would probably mean unconditional nurturing. 
R:  Yes. 
L:  And, you know, --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- 'cause nurturing goes along with love.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I'm a -- I'm actually a -- I'm an only child. 
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, my dad comes from a family of seven --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and my mum actually has nine. 
R:  Wow. 
L:  So and everybody else on both sides have more than one child. 
R:  Really? 
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  The lord blessed them with you --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- an only child. 
L:  Yeah, and, uh, -- 
R:  Okay. 
L:  I actually have a -- a three year old --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- a daughter and a five month old.
R:  Oh, you have an infant? 
L:  Yeah, I have an infant -- I have a five month old son. 
R:  Aren't they precious? 
L:  Yes.
R:  Aren't they -- I mean children are precious -- aren't the newborns amazing?
L:  Ah, they're -- they're -- they're the most, uh, --
R:  Oh.
L:  They're the best commodities we absolutely have. 
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah there's nothing like it. 
R:  I know you're in awe.
L:  I -- I am and --
R:  No matter how bad your day's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- going, when you make it home and look at those children's faces --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like every thing that you've gone through to -- to take care of them and make a living --
L:  It's so minimized.
R:  -- is worth it. 
L:  It is -- it absolutely it -- it's gone.
R:  And even if you've had a bad day, when you look at their faces, it don't even matter no more. 
L:  It really doesn't, and love it.
R:  And their faces can brighten up the whole room. 
L:  Right  like, you -- my wife, uh, and I are both professionals, but my wife -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, gave up her career and she is stays home with our son and daughter. 
R:  Oh, god that's great.
L:  And that's very, very important to us. 
R:  You know, what, people don't realise how important that is. 
L:  I -- I couldn't agree with you more. 
R:  I know the economy is in -- in a kind of the desperate state -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and really takes two incomes.
L:  Right. 
R:  You know, like, with myself, I was in Telecommunications -- my husband is a Detroit Police Officer. 
L:  Okay. 
R:  So I had some complications when I -- when I became pregnant and that was in two thousand and then I -- I had -- well I became -- became pregnant in ninety nine -- I had Blair in two thousand.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I've been home with him ever since, so we've kind of had to really, you know, lay back some things, and really budget and so forth because he's the only one working, uh, outside the home.  I recently started working inside the home doing some market research. 
L:  That's so unbelievable -- that's -- that's -- so does my wife.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm. But, you know, what I believe [SIGH] in my opinion I believe sometimes when one parent at least stays home and does the beginning years, the child is much more -- when they do get in school and when they do start going to kindergarten and getting around other people, I believe they're much more -- they're independent and they all much more secure and grounded. 
L:  And you -- that's what I was going to say, they're much more in tune with their emotions. 
R:  Exactly.
L:  They -- they understand consequences --
R:  Exactly. 
L:  I -- I couldn't agree with you anymore -- anymore --
R:  Exactly. 
L:  On that topic.
R:  A- and, you know, -- and it makes -- it makes a big difference too when that child gets in school and that teacher says, you know, "Okay, I see where mum has been working with her, I see where dad has been working".
L:  Right.
R:  "God, he's excelled and I mean he can really speak well, and, you know, he knows this -- he knows his colors".  That stands out, because why? One of the parents is at home. 
L:  Because [inaudible] again back to that unconditional nurturing. 
R:  Exactly. 
L:  Twenty four, seven, three sixty five, no matter what. 
R:  Exactly. 
L:  And that -- that is -- you can't put a price on it. 
R:  No, that's right. 
L:  And even if like day care was free and it was great --
R:  There's still not.
L:  It still wouldn't be the same. 
R:  No. 
L:  And day care, you know, in itself I think it's a necessary entity but I don't think that they're --
R:  You know, I used -- I used to work in the day care field and when I was working there I would always say, "That is going to be a last alternative for my child". 
L:  Yeah, absolutely. 
R:  The ratio is one to ten -- I mean ten, you know, -- ten children on one teacher, so --and as the kids get older the ratio becomes higher. 
L:  Right. 
R:  And I mean you really can't give each of those kids your undivided attention at all times.
L:  No.
R:  Someone is gonna miss out on something, somewhere. 
L:  Right.  Exactly. 
R:  You know, "Becky's gonna have to cry, while the teacher goes over there and attends to Lucy and Johnny". 
L:  And it's easier -- and that's in [inaudible] how they slip through the cracks all the way up. 
R:  Exactly. 
L:  You know.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Wh- --
R:  You know, when I used to work in the day care centre I used to try to just make it my business to try to give each kid as much as I could all of the love and nurturing, that I could, because I really felt for them -- mum would come in leave them at six o'clock in the morning -- mum is the last one or dad's the last one to pick them up at six o'clock in the evening.
L:  Right, at six o'clock in the evening. 
R:  And that's a long day. 
L:  Right, they're with the kids for you know, three, four hours. 
R:  That's a long -- and this one lady actually brought her son in who was six weeks old [inaudible] --
L:  That's a sin. 
R:  And he got --
L:  I mean it's not a sin -- I guess for some people --
R:  She had --
L:  -- it's what they have to do.
R:  And she had to do it, but it's just, oh, -- and she would come in crying every morning -- tears in her eyes -- she could hardly leave him. 
L:  Yeah I bet.
R:  You know.  She [inaudible] leave him, so I mean -- I said at that point, "When I have kids we just have to struggle, -- 
L:  Right. 
R:  -- need to cut back on a few things but --
L:  Right. 
R:  I'm going to be home with mine". 
L:  Exactly, it's so worth it because you --
R:  It is. 
L:  It's worth cutting a few pointers and -- and -- and we actually just bought a house last year. 
R:  Okay, congratulations. 
L:  We're -- thank you and we're, um, you know, we are not doing as many things -- we are not buying as many things --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we're not indulging as much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it's not -- you don't really even think about it. 
R:  No. 
L:  It's, like, just so worth it. 
R:  No, you really don't -- you're in a whole -- you're in a whole different --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- frame of mind. 
L:  Yep, it really is. 
R:  You know, because your most important thing is the welfare and the safety of your children. 
L:  Yeah that's -- in some ways, you know, that's kind of a purpose maybe of it all. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, every -- your whole perspective changes. 
R:  You know what, that's a good way of looking at this. 
L:  It really is. 
R:  It's a good way of looking at -- and when things get hard for me and my husband, and he's like, "You know we really need two pay cheques coming in here, and I -- I'm doing this, and I'm doing that".  And I say, "Okay honey, I understand but look how intelligent Blaire is" --
L:  Right. 
R:  He can count to forty -- he just turned three --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so he knows all of his colors. 
L:  That's really cool. 
R:  All of his ABC --
