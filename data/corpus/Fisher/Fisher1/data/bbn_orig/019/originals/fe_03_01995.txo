R:  Helen.
L:  Jenna.  Ah, so the topic is corporate conduct in the US.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, how has this affected you? 
R:  Um, it's -- it has affected -- it hasn't affected me per se but, um, [NOISE] I realize that over the last couple of years, there have been like a lot of mergers and acquisitions and, um, you know, like companies like Enron and NCI where people, you know, [NOISE] end up losing their jobs, their investments, all because of the corporate, you know, the conduct -- [NOISE] the businesses are conducting.
L:  That's true and Enron and also, um, Martha Stuart with that scandal that happened.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, actually somebody I know has stock in Martha Stuart so -- 
R:  Wow.
L:  -- it definitely affected that person.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That, ah, conduct.  I guess they think they are very -- they're immune, like, these -- these rich people.  They sort of think they're immune from being found out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but, ah, the Enron thing and the Martha Stuart thing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- proved that that's not true, that, ah, that anyone is susceptible but I wonder if this has had anything to do with the recession.  Do you think that, ah, it has had something to do with the recession or not? 
R:  I don't, um, I don't know if it per se has anything to do with the recession, but I think that their conduct because now, you know, companies are not seen in the same light that they were seen before and I think because of the way that these businesses are conducting themselves, they are making themselves appear, you know, I mean, that -- I'm pretty sure that's not going to help the economy.
L:  Mhm, that's true, that's true.
R:  You know, because, I mean, you have, um, all across the board, like, even with the acquisitions and everything that has been happening, I mean, the salaries of C- CEOs has, like, doubled and tripled.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And understanding that they play a large part into, you know, the success of the company but it -- it doesn't exactly say that they are sometimes not aware of the -- any -- if any illegal activity that has been going on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I think, you know, there has to be a place where you can [NOISE] kind of draw the line.
L:  Yeah, that's true, that's true.
R:  And say okay well, you know, this is going on but I think that the -- there has to be more, you know, government monitoring. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And even then it's -- it's still left because it's human beings that are doing it because it's like, I think it was yesterday in the newspaper here in New York, had a whole bunch of judges [NOISE] accepting money for doing divorces.  The lawyers are paying the, you know, the -- the -- the judges under the table.
L:  I had -- hadn't read about that really. 
R:  Yeah, and it just came out yesterday.
L:  Mm.
R:  So I think or this morning but it's just, you know, as long as, you know, the person is willing to do the dirty business and someone is -- allows them to do it, you know, for the sake of collecting money, then there's always going to be, you know, laws are going to be broken.
L:  Yeah, I mean -- I think -- I think President Bush said something about, ah, when Enron and all those things first happened that they were coming up with some kind of law or something, or some kind of -- something he was going to come up with to, ah, to sort of stop this from happening but I -- I don't quite remember what it was and I know he said something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I mean, I think like that Enron example and the Martha Stuart example, I think it's been, um, a learning lesson to all these different companies, you know, that you can't do these kind of things.  You can't have illegal practices.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you know, you would think that they would have maybe learned by the others' experience.
R:  [LAUGH] But I think that they're all -- many are driven by the dollar [NOISE] and as long as [NOISE] -- okay, thanks.  As long as you're driven by the dollar, you know, the company may be willing to do whatever it takes to make the dollars.  Like, I used to work for a company before where we had to verify people's employment status and we had -- there were like one or two members at the job who were forging other people's signatures, you know, and as time passed on, it was then discovered that it -- it was one of the unwritten, you know, policies of the company, whatever brings in the money just do whatever brings in the money.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, so as long as things like that happen, [NOISE] it's hard to say that illegal activity, you know, won't go on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  There's always people that want to -- want to rise to the top and if the way to rise to the top is by being a brown noser or doing special jobs, then, you know, there's always going to be somebody around to do the dirty work.
L:  Yeah, you can't -- you can't sort of put a law on human nature and what human people do.
R:  Exactly.  
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  And, you know, it's hard even with the government because then you have even like politicians, you know, you did when they are running for office it comes out, you know, the news is more, you know, comes out even faster but they sometimes accept money that even when they need to pass a bill or something, you know [NOISE] people make gifts and donations and, you know, you know, they use that as an excuse but sometimes it's just in order for them to vote in the way that whoever, you know, whatever company they are involved with, to kind of, you know, use that to get a vote or to get a decision passed their way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you know, it's kinda hard.
L:  I wonder if, like, this is -- I mean, I'm sure, I -- I don't read that much but if they, you know, I don't know if this happens in other countries talking about corporate conduct in the US, I wonder if it's like as bad in other countries too or if they maybe have better rules or, you know, it seems to be -- but it seems to be very prevalent in the US with all the examples but I can't think if there are any other people -- I mean, all I think of is Enron and Martha Stuart when I think of, you know, legal -- illegal business practices.
R:  Yeah, I don't know because I -- I mean, I'm studying human resources now, so it's kind of hard because there isn't much to read about on global, you know, global cor- corporations.  I mean, that global -- the way that the, you know, the United States has had to globally expand to other parts of the world as well has also affected the economy because they can't conduct business the same way as before.  Now, there's more competitors, and even to the simplest things.  I mean, you can find [NOISE] fifty thousand different brands of soap so you know that when you start thinking like that, somebody is not making the money.  And, you know, when you go to the store, I mean you have so many choices and variety so you know every company is not going to be able to stay on top because everybody's not going to be able to purchase, you know, we're not all going to purchase the same soap or maybe three or four or five of them.
L:  Mm.
R:  So I think that also affects it and they really haven't made any text books that I know of on how, you know, other countries do their, um, their business globally.  I know the salaries like of CEOs are not across the board in the global countries.  So if the salaries are [inaudible] there's not that need to make the money.  There's probably not that need to, you know, do illegal activity.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I -- I'm also pretty sure, ah, the -- the expenses are not that high because I mean -- 
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- the last couple of years, I mean, rents have doubled, tripled, you know.  People are spending more, have to make more.  People are now working where before maybe you only had a one -- one person in the household who could work and support the family, nowadays it mostly takes two people.
L:  That's true, yeah. 
R:  So with expenses and everything going on, you know, people have to work even harder and at the same token you kind of understand why somebody might want to do something illegal just, you know, to make a little extra money or to be a little, you know, have that peace of mind or be able to provide for their family.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- it's like the conditions of, you know, financial -- financial conditions today with the recession and with -- also with the war recently.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And all that, it sort of creates a climate where people are more likely to do these kind of illegal business activities.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  I mean, I was even overhearing people today on the train and they were talking about, um, 'cause now with all the budget cuts, I mean, they want to cut unemployment.  People are now finding jobs, and after they run their year up in unemployment, guess what, they're not entitled to any more benefits.  So it's going to become again where robberies were -- robberies had decreased over the last couple of years.  They're probably just going to go up because if people can't find jobs, they got to [NOISE] feed, you know, they're going to do whatever it takes to feed their family.
L:  Yeah.  You're right, you have all those cuts like Bloomberg is making all the cuts, different jobs and stuff and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- cutting -- cutting different things and after school programs and that kind of thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So it all just creates this kind of, um, -- this kind of financial situation where people are likely to do illegal business practices 'cause it's -- they're just interested in the dollar and not anything else really. 
R:  Mhm.  And then the thing -- the funny part is that everybody is talking about how bad the economy -- like everything is nine eleven.  Every company is always having these cuts, um, business is bad.  But you don't see people's salaries or at least you don't see the -- the lower class workers' salaries being, um, given substantial raises, but, however, the top executives are getting large bonuses.  [NOISE] They're getting their regular percentages of raises so the business can't be doing that bad.  I mean, there's other companies where even though they say, you know, business is bad, but what they are actually doing instead of laying people off, they actually will have them work instead of working five days a week, come in and work four days a week, that kind of stuff in order not to lay people off.
L:  Yes.
R:  So it all depends on the standpoint of whoever is in the top position in what they feel like do --
