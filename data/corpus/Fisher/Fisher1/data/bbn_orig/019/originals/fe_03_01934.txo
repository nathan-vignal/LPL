L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Oh, am I supposed to give you my name or what?
R:  Yeah, I guess.  I'm Theresa.
L:  Okay, I'm Patsy, this is my first call.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So we're supposed to talk about family and what it means to us.
R:  Mhm.  Where were you raised? 
L:  Austin, Texas.
R:  Austin, Texas.  Do you come from a big family?
L:  Ah, no, about four people.
R:  Really? 
L:  Yeah, four siblings; that's about it. That's --
R:  Oh, four siblings?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, that's a pretty decent sized family.
L:  Yeah, I think that's decent.
R:  Are you the oldest or the youngest? 
L:  Middle.
R:  Middle.  Yeah, I have one older sister.  We're like three and a half years difference but, um, --
L:  Wh- -- 
R:  My family -- my family overall's pretty small.
L:  Where am I calling to -- I mean, where are you from? 
R:  Oh, um, I'm calling from Nashville.
L:  Oh, Nashville, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've been through Tennessee, that's very nice.
R:  Yeah, it is pretty nice.  I -- I grew up outside of Chicago, suburban Chicago, but I've been here nine years.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  So your family all lives in Texas?
L:  Yes, pretty much.  I do have some in California.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And San Jose area.
R:  Do you have, like, a lot of aunts and uncles and cousins and everything?
L:  Um, yeah, but I don't get to see 'em much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because I'm by myself in Dallas.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So I have no relatives here.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, um, if I were to see anybody, I have -- I have to travel and make the time to travel.
R:  Yeah, that's me.  I don't really have any family here either.  I would have to go back to Chicago.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, but I've got an aunt and uncle that live, um, to Bowling Green which is like an hour from here, so at least I get to see them and -- and we're pretty close.
L:  Oh, okay.  Do you have kids?
R:  No. 
L:  Me neither.
R:  No, no, no, I haven't been married either.
L:  Me neither.
R:  Yeah.  You know, at this point, I'm, like, thirty five and I haven't had children, so I'm not thinking that I really want any.  If -- if I do, I can change my mind and adopt I guess.
L:  Oh, well, actually I'm looking into that.  I'm doing research.
R:  For adoption?
L:  Yes.
R:  Are you really?
L:  Uh-huh, and I'm quite a bit older than you.
R:  Oh, that's exciting.
L:  Yeah.  I'm kind of scared because I don't have a family support system.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And if I do this, it -- it's going to be all on me.
R:  Wow, but -- I've -- I've known people who've done that on their own.
L:  Well, I've met some people who have but, ah, the people who -- who, um, have done it, the single women who I know that I've met briefly -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, they have support systems.  They have aunts or -- or cousins or sisters or mothers or somebody helping them out in the same city.
R:  Wow.
L:  And I know I won't have that support system.
R:  Do you have really good friends that you're really close to?
L:  Well, yeah, but that doesn't mean that they're going to -- 
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  You know, they don't live close enough to just drop over.  I do have one neighbor.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's my best friend.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, I mean, if I take it on, I can't -- I can probably depend on him sometimes but not a whole lot because you're taking this on.  You're -- you're asking for this.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You're choosing this.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, um, I could probably depend on him on -- in an emergency, but -- 
R:  So mostly, and you work full time and everything?  
L:  Yes, but, um, as it is now, I'm close to kind of retirement that I can get out of my, ah, -- I have, like, a half a dozen jobs.  I can get out of my main job, um, and -- and not too long.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And if I coincide the adoption, then I'll have to put the kid in day care maybe for a couple of years and then I can be a halfway full time mom.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  So I'm -- I'm not sure about that.  I'm not -- I mean, I -- I think I do want to adopt and I've been thinking about it for a long time and doing research but really not doing anything.
R:  Yeah.  Are you wanting like --
L:  You know, you do research and you get, ah, caught in the research and not the actual doing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And right now, the cheapest I find -- I've found is sixteen thousand.
R:  Wow.
L:  So I was -- 
R:  Are you wanting to adopt like, ah, an American child or -- 
L:  No.
R:  -- a foreign child? 
L:  No, I don't want to do American because they take 'em back.
R:  Wow.
L:  They have made -- 
R:  Such a good opportunity for -- for a child from a poor country to be able to be raised, you know.  The United States is so wealthy when you look at the global view of things, you know.
L:  Yes.  Well, the, ah, the foreign adoptions are very expensive because we have to travel to that country and do all the legal and social work.  You do the social work here in this country.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you have to travel to that country and do all the legal work there.
R:  Wow.
L:  And so that's very expensive and, ah, the -- the money worries me right now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I don't have that in -- in bulk.  That means you have to take out some kinda loan.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, but that is an option and there are single women doing it.  You know, I never made at these -- I've -- I've gone to, like, three seminars.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I never meet single men.
R:  Right.
L:  Wanting to adopt.
R:  Really?
L:  No, and -- 
R:  That's odd.
L:  -- you know, I don't know, I -- I don't think the men, ah, as a -- as a whole in society are that, ah, I don't know.  They're just not doing it.
R:  Well, that -- that's interesting.
L:  The women are but not the men.
R:  Oh, you know, women I guess tend to be more nurturing or --  
L:  Yes, and they're not, ah, -- the men are not developing 'cause I see single women and their hu- -- their boyfriends leave 'em when they get pregnant so where is the nurturing for their own flesh and blood? 
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's true.
L:  And there's a lot of divorced people who aren't getting the child support from the men.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Again, where's the nurturing?
R:  Right.
L:  So, I'm not getting that but, um, yeah, that is an option for you, if you decide to do that, though you are still young enough to get pregnant.
R:  Mm, yeah, I don't know that I'd make a good parent.  That-- that's what's always scared me.
L:  Well, you know, the thing about it is, in -- in our time, the -- the time we're living in -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you don't have to do either.  If you don't want to you don't have to be a parent.  It's not like the old days.
R:  Where -- where you -- yeah.
L:  Where society said you had to.  They gave you a -- a certain limitation.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But now you live in such a good time span that if you don't want to, you don't have to.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's very true.  Um, living in the south is a lot more conservative than where I grew up too where at my age being single here is considered very odd.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, back home it -- it wouldn't be as noticeable or -- or something, but I'll get that, "Oh, you poor thing.  Somebody will find you". [LAUGH] It's like, "Well, I'm not really looking" but, you know, for somebody to assume or make that presumption it's kind of odd.
L:  Yes, I -- I get that a lot.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I just tell 'em, "Look, I'm not doing a good job of finding a mate, then you do it".
R:  Right.
L:  And I just give it to them.  Now, my circumstances is that I'm an artist and I live in a gay kind of world.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's all I meet.
R:  Yeah.  Well, to -- to me my friends mean more to me than my family because my friends have been there for me in ways that my family never was.
L:  Well, the same here.
R:  And so to me that -- that is my family.
L:  Okay.  Then you're saying that family is not flesh and blood, you're saying it's relationship.
R:  Yes, very much so.
L:  Okay.
R:  But, yeah, I would say that I truly believe that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because my friends and I are very close and we've been friends for years and years and I can talk to them and rely on them more, and plus I know that they care about me because they want to not because they're related to me and feel an obligation.  And -- and that's -- that's a special gift to have somebody who wants your friendship and cares about you because they just want to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What kind of artist are you?
L:  Well, right now, um, I do several kinds of art, but my -- my main job is, um, Yellow Pages.  Um, the artist that does it, um, in the Texas region -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  So Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Austin. 
R:  Like graphic artist?
L:  Yes, it's computer art.
R:  Oh, oh, well, that's cool.
L:  So when you open up the Yellow Pages from A to Z --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- somebody has to design all those ads.
R:  See, I work for a newspaper so I know exactly what you're talking about.
L:  Okay, so, yeah, they -- they -- do the same type of paper almost and the same color prints.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, yeah, you would.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, we do layout.  We're a weekly paper so we do the layout every week.
L:  Okay.
R:  And we have our own in house graphic artist.
L:  Well, what's your position? 
R:  I do accounting.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  I do the anal crap that nobody else wants to do. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  But are you anal, ah, in your home life?  Are you good at saving and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Number crunching and -- 
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, that -- that part of it, yeah.
L:  That's good, that's real good.
R:  Yeah, if it doesn't drive people nuts it's good.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, if you're getting your goals accomplished.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because in our society money is a really valuable tool.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, I mean, you -- you're dependent on it for lots of things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um, if you're real good with that, that is really good because -- 
R:  Yeah, it -- it buys you independence.
L:  Yes.  That's what, ah, money means to me, freedom.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I -- I equate that the same way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Money means independence and it means freedom.
L:  Yes.
R:  And if I were to have to rely on someone, it would -- it would really, really devastate a certain part of me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I just wouldn't be able to let go like that.
L:  Yeah, you'd probably need to have your own job or -- or your own source of money coming in.
R:  Yeah, even if I were married, I -- I -- I could never not work because I would feel that I would lose my independence and give up a part of myself.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And -- and that --
