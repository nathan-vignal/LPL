R:  Hello.
L:  This is -- 
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, this is Veronica.
R:  Hi, this is Chuck.  Ah, -- 
L:  Hi, Chuck.
L:  So how has it affected you? 
R:  Wha- -- how has it affected me?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, it's affected me in the respect that my -- my grandchildren will, um, [MN] not ever look up to these people, you know, like a role model or anything because most people think [LIPSMACK] that when you're successful in life, no matter how you get there, that's what the important thing is, but it -- but the important thing really is how you get there, that you don't step on a lot of toes to get there, you know, to -- to be honest and -- and -- and trustworthy and to have integrity which is something that's really lacking in this world.
L:  Yeah.  I really think that the government should have certain laws in certain ways that they have to prosecute people that don't follow rules and the companies because, um, the people that work hard to make these companies successful are the ones that get affected --
R:  Tha- --
L:  -- so there definitely has to be more investigations and people, you know, that are actually there watching over, you know -- you know, the numbers constantly.  There has to be more of that and there has to be laws where prosecutions, you know, [MN] -- 
R:  Well, it seemed like people nowadays feel like if it feels good you do it, you know, but you can't do it at somebody else's expense because without us, they wouldn't even have a job to speak, you know.
L:  Correct.
R:  That's -- that's -- that's what -- how I feel about it because it takes everybody in this world to -- to make it, you know, and if it wouldn't be for the stockholders, they wouldn't have a job.  All the CEOs'd be out cutting grass or whatever they be doing.
L:  That's -- that's true.  I mean, it's affected me in the way that, um, my husband worked for a company that was a Fortune Five Hundred company and -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Now he's laid off and the stock market has just, you know, completely, you know, that's, you know, but, I mean --
R:  Wh- --
L:  -- what -- what do you do now?  It's like now -- 
R:  What -- what happened -- I'm sorry.
L:  Yeah, go ahead.
R:  Ah, what happened to me was in nineteen eighty seven I was working for Eastern Airlines and, um, they -- they went down tube.  They went file chapter eleven, you know, went bankrupt.  But [COUGH] the under- underhand dealings that went along with the transfer of, ah, the -- from Eastern to Continental with Mr Frank Lorenzo and Frank Borman was really worse than insider trading because Eastern Airline was sold for a song, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And over forty nine thousand people lost their jobs including me.  What -- I actually took an early retirement, and after twenty eight years of service, I ended up with five hundred and thirty two dollars a month.  Plus the fact that I had over -- I -- I missed about twenty seven days in twenty eight years, believe it or not and, ah, I lost over twenty four hundred hours sick leave and you could imagine how much money that was, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- I was really bitter about it but, you know, you can sit around and cry about things or you can get off your duff and -- and go do other things and that's what I do.  I do merchandising work -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, ah, I enjoy it because I meet a lot of people in all, you know, but these people, like you say up in the top echelon should be made to pay for -- for what they do, just like all that Enron situation.  Those people should be made to live in a tent -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and take in the money and give it to the people that trusted them.
L:  Yeah, the people that worked hard to make them the money that, you know, they did have and they just, you know, and no consideration. Yeah.
R:  Well, that's certainly and -- and, you know, and -- and, everybody turns their -- their back on it but I really do think we have a -- an administration.  Ah, President Bush, ah, thank God he's in there as far as I'm concerned.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, ah, -- 
L:  I agree.
R:  -- but he has integrity and that's something we haven't had for a long time, and [COUGH] when all the shenanigans were going on, is when, um, Slick Willy President was in there, you know.  And, ah, what bothered me was it didn't bother anybody no matter what he did, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Now that, you know, the economy and -- and everyone is feeling an affect now is when everyone now wants to do something about it when they should have -- laws should have been created way before.
R:  Well, you know, -- you know, they had too much plastic floating around, you know.  Nobody pays for anything any more.  They charge it all and that's another problem you've got too, you know.
L:  Yeah, everything is too lenient.  There has to be -- 
R:  And -- and I think, um, Mr Bush, unfortunately in- inherited a lot of stuff that comes down because what happens in the time of -- of one leader's rule, ah, doesn't necessarily mean that that's the fruits of his rule.  It -- it -- it comes back at a later time, you know.  So I really think he got a bum deal with all that Enron business, but like you said, I think -- 
L:  Yeah, I think that -- I think that -- 
R:  Huh? 
L:  I think that Enron, ah, really just, really -- really took a big affect on everything and a lot of the corporations are having to deal with what -- even the good companies out there that are trying to, um, do things the right way have taken, you know, affect and have had to lay off just so that they can meet, you know, quotas so that, um, they can still survive in this weak economy.
R:  Sure, but, you know, also, ah, take American Airlines.  Those people gave up their salary -- 
L:  Yes, they did. Mhm.
R:  -- come to find out that these people, ah, that were in the top echelon -- in fact the -- the chairman of the board resigned today or yesterday -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- bec- because, ah, they were taking all this money and if -- even if they would have gone on strike and bankrupt and everything, they would have gotten like, what, forty five thousand dollars a year, just -- just retir- -- 
L:  And at the end -- at the end what is really his penalty?  He is out of a job but, um, what is really his penalty?  He's probably already had so much money underhand that we don't know about.
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  So, I mean, where -- where do the laws come in where he gets investigated and -- 
R:  I -- I -- I -- I don't know.
L:  -- where he gets prosecuted, you know.
R:  I don't know.  I, um, it's -- it's good for government to -- to, you know, to punish all these people and all but you can't let government run your life.  The people have to -- the people have to look for better things, you know.
L:  There has to be someone there.
R:  Instead of a quick buck, you know.
L:  In corporations like this there has to be someone out there looking out for the people that work hard to make, you know, the CEOs and the presidents -- 
R:  That's true.
L:  -- rich. And --
R:  And -- and the harder you work, the harder you work, ah, the more you're punished with taxes, you know.
L:  So what -- what -- what -- wouldn't you say that the government should have stricter laws or stricter penalties? 
R:  I think you ought to, you know, you can have all kind of laws but if you don't enforce 'em, they're no good.
L:  Correct.
R:  And that's what happens.  They have all these laws, you know, in the books that these people should be punished and punished severely, you know, even jail, and I don't mean a rest home, I mean -- I mean, you know, working eight, ten hours a day and -- and earning their keep for -- for what the citizens are paying to put them up, do you follow me?
L:  Yeah. That is -- definitely. 
R:  But even -- even so when you take these big executives and you put 'em in jail, what happens?  They go like a country club.
L:  Yeah, it's -- I mean, what is really -- that's what I'm saying, it's like what is really, yes, he resigned, yes, you know, he's out of a job but what about the people that gave up their salaries and they're still in the same boat from where they -- you know, they -- 
R:  That's right.  That's why I -- why I say they should be made to -- to reciprocate for whatever people put into that and let 'em, you know, let 'em be, um, -- I don't know how you could say it, let 'em work and let the money that -- that they earn go back to the people that put 'em to where they were in the beginning.
L:  Somehow give it to a pay back.
R:  Yes, pay back.
L:  All the people -- all the people that had their 401Ks and were investing, ah, in Enron and believed that they were going to retire at a certain time -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  All that -- all that was a lie.  All that is -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  You know, -- 
R:  An- -- 
L:  How do you let someone who's, you know, fifty five start over? 
R:  That's right.
L:  You know, how do you start over and, you know -- 
R:  Well -- how -- 
L:  How do you start saving from the start when you've worked for a company for so many years to realize that, you know? 
R:  It's hard.
L:  -- they have been robbing you blind.
R:  It's hard, it's just like -- 
L:  You know.
R:  -- like, when my incident, you know, when Eastern went bankrupt.  I was out on the street and then I was -- I -- I wasn't getting social security yet and if I earned over a certain amount a year, I was punished.  I had to pay one dollar back on every three I made -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so why should I work for the government?
L:  That's true -- 
R:  You know?
L:  -- that should be -- that could be one of the laws that they could, you know, come up with, you know.
R:  Well, they did come up with it where -- 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Where, you know, when you are a certain age you can -- you can earn some but I think they ought to make it even younger because after you reach a certain age, you're not going to be on this earth too much longer, you know.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, but I'm talking about the CEOs that, you know, steal money from their own company.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Workers once they find another place or somewhere to work, they -- they should be made to pay back -- 
R:  They should.
L:  -- so much money or they should be made to -- 
R:  They should be made to sell all their possessions. 
L:  That's correct.
R:  They should be made to sell everything.
L:  Correct.
R:  And let 'em go live in an apartment like the poor people had to do that had nothing to fall back on.
L:  That's right.
R:  You know.
L:  That's -- mhm.
R:  But -- but, ah, you know, the funny thing about it is if it doesn't affect you, it doesn't -- it doesn't -- if it doesn't affect people, it doesn't bother 'em.  It only seems like when it hits home you what I mean.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, if it's an uncle or -- or husband or -- or a cousin or whatever, you know, a father, whatever --
