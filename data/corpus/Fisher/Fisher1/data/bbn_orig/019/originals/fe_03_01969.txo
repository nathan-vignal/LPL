L:  Hi there.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, this is Linda.
R:  This is Michelle.
L:  Hi, Michelle, how are you? 
R:  Fine.
L:  Good, good, you're not a mystery shopper by any chance, are you?
R:  Um, that's how I found out about this.
L:  Yeah, me too. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, this is my first one to do so -- 
L:  Oh, cool, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think this is my third.  I'm not -- I'm -- I'm pretty sure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So government illegal activities and how is the scandals, I'm ta- -- I'm assuming they are talking about Enron and all those, right? 
R:  Yeah, that's what came to mind for me.
L:  Okay, same here.
R:  Um, the government, what can the government do?  Um, I think if they would maybe have more checks and balances with the, um, corporation on their reports that they put out.
L:  Right.
R:  Might help.   
L:  I know that where I work is they've gone very, very extreme on, um, ethics and they do a lot more communication, you know, on this is how we do things, this is our accounting practice.  We don't, you know, we will not put up with any, you know, blah, blah, blah.
R:  Real strict.
L:  Very, very strict.  I think a lot of the big companies have had to come out with that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, to say we are not doing anything like that, you know.
R:  [LAUGH] Yes, you can trust us.
L:  Well, you know, because I -- and I think that's one thing that's said is it how has it affected the stock market and I -- and I -- I'm sure it has.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The safe in the -- the company, I mean, was shocking when all that started, never thought about.
R:  Right, that they would lie about that and, um, yeah, be dishonest about their earnings -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and mislead.
L:  And play that kind of game.  I mean, and how many people it affected -- how many employees did it affect at that company?  That it devastated with no, you know, no pos- -- no retirement built up.
R:  Right, yes.
L:  Gosh.  
R:  Lots lost the lot.
L:  Yeah, yes, and then to kind of find a couple of other companies have done it as well, to -- to play that game.
R:  Yeah, yeah, it's bad.
L:  Yeah.  So that -- so [inaudible] what can the government do, huh? 
R:  Yeah, what can the government do?
L:  Gosh.  What really -- it really saddens me is that the government has to keep getting involved and involved and involved, you know. 
R:  Right.
L:  And that there can't be regulations out there that like -- like the accounting firms.  You always assumed, okay, since accounting firms are doing the -- the audits and a double check and all that, but -- but was it -- was it Arthur Andersen? 
R:  Yes.
L:  That also got in trouble? 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Like, gee, your whole faith in the whole system was, like, oh, no.
R:  Yeah, they were all, um, lying about numbers so maybe -- 
L:  Right.  Now the government is going to have to step in and help.
R:  Right, and have extra checks to make sure that everyone is being honest.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Yeah, and I think the stiff penalties for those who do lie.
L:  Yes.
R:  And deceive.
L:  And make it really well known what those penalties are.
R:  Right.
L:  Right, I mean, of course -- 
R:  You do this, this is going to happen.
L:  Right, and earlier in the -- earlier in the game, so that so not many employees' lives are so devastated by it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, every year, whatever, so now we have, what, somebody checking the checking company.  I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  Somebody is going to have to audit the audit company I guess.
R:  Right, right.
L:  But it would be a shame to spend more government money to do that but I guess if it -- which means more of our money.
R:  Right, yeah, that's right.  It is a shame that they -- 
L:  Yeah, so I'm -- but I'm not sure of the answer.  I don't know what other answer unless you have a -- well, there would almost have to be somebody that's accountable to the government, another audit company.
R:  Uh-huh, yes.
L:  I guess.
R:  I don't know what would make sense, be honest though either.
L:  Right, exactly, unless it's oh my gosh, you could get into all sorts of -- I guess the only thing that's going to keep the confidence of -- of the United States people as, you know, being within a company like IM that -- that just continuously says, "Here, this is what we're doing", you know.  Um, I know we were -- the company I work for was in a magazine.  It was, like, one of the top -- what was it, hundred ethical companies in the country.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  Yeah, yeah, because they're just going -- and this -- this comes out every year so it's not like something new because of Enron.
R:  [COUGH] Right.
L:  You know, they -- they do this every year but they are looking for specific things that, ah, um, that companies are doing to make sure that their stockholders are, you know, comfortable and their employees are comfortable, so -- 
R:  Yeah, I think that's a good -- a good -- 
L:  I wonder if -- 
R:  -- idea to do that.
L:  Yeah, I wonder if the government couldn't do something on that same kind of -- I wonder who does all that checking.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Maybe they could use that same system.
R:  Yeah, just show they would want it to be high on the ethical list and they'd want their company listed -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- as high 'cause that would give people confidence and invest in their company and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  You know, that would be. 
L:  I wonder what they -- I don't know what they use, but, I mean, there would be something that -- maybe it's already in place, that wouldn't cost the taxpayer so much money.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't know about you, but it just seems like every time we turn around the government has got to get involved and to regulate something because somebody has ruined it for -- 
R:  Right, right.  
L:  You know.
R:  They don't always do the best job either.
L:  Right.
R:  So -- 
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  Not -- not to pay them, so, yeah, that sounds -- that sounds good.  What was the other question?  Oh, how has it affected us?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, yeah, I'm a stay at home mom but my husband works and, um, it's affected us I guess because the 401K keeps coming back, um, with quarterly losses.
L:  Losses.
R:  Loss, loss, loss and, yeah, we're just in our mid thirties and we're looking for retirement and wanting to -- 
L:  Sure.
R:  -- not knowing what to do, um, where to put our money and -- 
L:  Sure.
R:  And, um, so it has affected us and that we aren't -- we're not making anything on the money that we do invest.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, um, yeah, then we don't know really what else to do with it so -- 
L:  Right, right.  And of course, you know, granted it was inflated for a while and maybe it was inflated because of these companies.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Being, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- being dishonest.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, really you had a stock market doubled and it -- you know, maybe there was a -- maybe if it -- that hadn't happened, maybe they're the ones that caused it while these, you know, great earnings and all that and -- and now we're hitting, seeing a ripple effect of not only going back to -- to the negative like you said, um, quarterly reports, but also where's reality in this?  Where wo- -- where would we be realistically, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and -- and if they -- did they inflate it so much now that they really are hurting everybody? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Maybe it's not just their employees they hurt, but maybe 'cause the stock market is, you know, rebounding from it.
R:  Right, yeah.  Yeah, there's a lot -- a lot going on.
L:  Gosh.
R:  All it with nine eleven and the war and Enron and just -- 
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  And usually -- 
R:  Confidence.
L:  Usually -- usually 'cause I'm older, I mean, usually the, like, the Vietnam war and stuff sim- stimulated our economy and wars normally do that in some ways.  I mean, the other is tightening in other areas.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But -- but you kind of wonder if, ah, you know, the timing of all this with Enron and all the other companies, the dot com companies and stuff that happened to that, it kind of, um, you know, ruining that part of the stimulation of the economy.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's been a lot been going on in the last few years with it. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I don't know if it's just the corporate conduct or -- 
L:  Right.
R:  But, um.
L:  Is your -- is your husband's company kind of going out of their way to make sure everybody's comfortable and --
R:  Yeah, yeah, they do, uh-huh.  He works for a family owned company.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  Yeah, yeah, and they -- they have good earning systems that is finally coming back, but, um, I don't know.  That -- it didn't sound like they go out to the extreme that you all do but they're private so they don't -- 
L:  But they're, yeah.
R:  They don't have to prove anything.
L:  Yeah, and that -- that is a difference.  I mean, the family still needs to [COUGH] family operated still needs to [COUGH] make their employees comfortable but at the same, you don't have the thousands of employees to -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- to worry about to, you know, to communicate to I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is what I'm trying to say.
R:  Right.
L:  It's not as critical, that's good.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Man, you know, it's just an interesting question that they pose today, isn't it?  The -- I know last time I was on a call I was -- I didn't take the call because nobody to get on with me and it was very confusing so when she first said the topic, I went, okay, I hope she's going to go into more detail on this.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they said the topic and then I -- then a man came on.  It sounded like a recording and I didn't understand how it worked so I hung up and I was like, "Oh, my gosh I'm confused" so.
L:  Oh, funny, a man came on? 
R:  Yeah and he said "Patrick" or something.  He didn't say like hi, and I thought -- 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I just had to ramble on for ten minutes.  I didn't quite understand.
L:  On, no. 
R:  Yeah, but what did they want to know, anything else?
L:  I don't think so.
R:  Corporate conduct and the -- 
L:  Let's see, the scandal and how the scandals affected us and how has the scandals affected the -- I guess everybody else.  I mean, that's kind of -- 
R:  Yeah, like you said, it sounds bad.
L:  What -- yeah, what have they shown the -- the -- the latest index was on people saving versus spending.  It's -- it hurt Christmas, it hurt -- 
R:  Retailers.
L:  Retail across the board but, you know, really showed at Christmas I guess and I don't know how Easter did but I know it was really showing in the retail world of people cutting, you know, saying, "Whoa, we're making -- we're getting losses on our 401K". 
R:  Right.
L:  We're going to -- 
R:  Cut back, uh-huh. 
L:  Yeah, we're going to cut back somewhere.
R:  Right. And then all the people even just lost jobs at Enron. 
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Lost their -- 
L:  There are so many, it's amazing.  Well, we have a United Airlines, um, big United Airlines in Indianapolis so that's really been a big hit here.
R:  Yeah, we're American.  I'm in Dallas.
L:  Okay, yeah, so -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're getting a big lay off there.
R:  Yeah, uh-huh, thirty five hundred pilots I think, four just in our neighborhood'll get the call any time.
L:  Oh, man.  Well, my friend who works at -- her husband works for Northwest and they've asked for voluntary -- for some of the mechanics and the -- and the pilots and stuff to take some voluntary -- to take cut back on vacation, you know, things like that.  They are starting.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So they are starting with the voluntary to see what happens.
R:  Wow.
L:  But, yeah, the United has already hit here so you know that all the, you know, you have the combination of nine eleven and then Enron stuff -- [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  What timing --
