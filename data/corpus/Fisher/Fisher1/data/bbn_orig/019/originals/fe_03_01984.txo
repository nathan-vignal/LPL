R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name is Sally Minks.
L:  Hi, my name's Donna Hernandes.
R:  And, well, what -- I think -- shall we talk?
L:  Sure, go ahead.
R:  Well, I think that the government -- I think is causing a lot of the financial -- the, ah, economical problems that we have in this country.
L:  How -- how is it you think the government is causing it? 
R:  Well, I think they're not doing anything to -- first of all, I don't think with the tax, I think the tax is -- is terrible.  I don't think we should have a tax cut.  I really don't.  I think there is such budget deficits in this country that it's just amazing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And how do you feel about it?
L:  I mean, I agree in some respects.  I -- I -- I think a small -- some form of tax cut may help stimulate the economy but, ah, you know, but I don't think a large tax cut is actually necessary and -- you can't guarantee that it's going to stimulate the economy so -- 
R:  Yes.  I think -- are you in the stock market at all?
L:  Um, I have a 401K so -- 
R:  Similar, I'm in the stock market and I just -- and when, you know, I see my stocks going down, but fortunately I don't need it to live on but I just -- I think this country is in a very bad shape financially.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's definitely true.  But -- but I mean, you know, I -- I understand from the perspective of we need to do something to stimulate the economy and bring that around, you know, and I don't know what the answer is.
R:  Well, what I'm afraid is that when the next president comes in, we're going to have such huge debtors and we're going to have taxes.  That's the only way that's going to get this country started again.  We have to tax the people and sort a lot of new projects and I just really feel that, you know, we talk about [SIGH] this country and I really think that we are headed for a very bad depression.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, I wonder -- I wonder if -- if -- how long it's going to take before things turn around because, you know -- 
R:  Oh, I don't think -- I don't think it will be in this -- I don't think it will be with this, um, administration.  I think we're going to have to have a whole new administration come in because there's going to have a lot of changes made.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I don't think -- well, I mean, I'm just think that -- it can -- economically this country is in for a very bad, bad time.
L:  Mm.  Well, we've been in the bad time and I -- I guess I'm optimistic.  I still -- I'm still hoping that we come out of it, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  With -- with, you know, maybe when the war kind of, you know, the -- the ends of that kind of get tied up and -- and everybody comes back home and kind of starts doing, you know, their normal lives again.
R:  It's not going to happen.  I really don't think it's going to happen.  I think this country is -- we're headed for tremendous, tremendous thing because we are going to have to support this Iraq.  Forget about the oil.  It ain't -- it just ain't going to be.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, I think that we're really in a very bad situation when it comes to the economy.
L:  Oh, I agree, and you can see that from -- from what's happening to some of the large corporations who are kind of, you know, going under and -- and I think that kind of -- I think there's going to have to be a lot of changes.
R:  Well, look -- 
L:  You know.
R:  -- look what happened to American Airlines.
L:  Right, right.
R:  There -- there's going to be a lot of changes and we -- until we get somebody who is not so oriented, you know, have big money behind 'em, you know, I just, you know, you live in a town, you see your taxes but I think our taxes will go up.
L:  Mhm.  Well, you know, it -- that might not be a bad solution.
R:  Well -- 
L:  You know.
R:  Wherever you, you know, it depends on what part of the country you live in but, you know, everything is expensive and the economy, everybody talks about the economy and you cut back and you don't do this and you don't do that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And tax cuts, believe me, and big business not doing it and, you know, you don't know -- you don't know what to do next.
L:  Right.  I don't know, it's one of those things, like, I don't know if anybody has the answer for, you know, because if you raise the taxes so we get the country's budget out of the deficit, you know, you're going to put more pressure on the individual people and then, you know, they're not going to have the money to necessarily spend, you know. 
R:  But -- but it's -- and they have proven that tax cuts does not stimulate business.  Maybe they need some government programs building highways or building buildings or doing something to get the economy going.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like -- maybe like a -- a Peace Corps in the United States, you know, to get roads, to get schools done.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But we have to promote within this country.  We really have to, um, start thinking about what we should do with the economy, whether it's big business.  But big business really doesn't care about the little person.  It's only what they can -- what they can make their money on.
L:  Right, right, and that I think that's -- that's part of the problem.  And one of the things that has to change is, you know, big businesses not taking care of their employees, taking care of, you know, their upper level management, you know, and -- and -- 
R:  Upper -- upper middle management always make the millions and millions and millions and millions and the poor person only makes X amount of dollars.
L:  Right.
R:  And -- and the only thing that's saving us really is that we have low inflation.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I think maybe there needs to be some changes so that things like what happened to the Enron employees doesn't happen, you know, because people work for a company for so many years like that and then to just completely lose everything that they had put away for their retirement, that's, you know, that's obviously not going to stimulate the economy.
R:  And -- and when you have people in the sixties who can't retire because their 401K has [MN] vanished.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And, I mean, and you pick it up and the stock market is going [MN] down every single day. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, you just, you know, you just and you see services, you know, you look at and you really don't know what to do.  I don't know what the answer is, I really don't.
L:  No, I don't either.  I figure that's why we -- that's why we pay those people the big bucks to run this country. [LAUGH]
R:  Maybe we don't pay the big bucks.  I mean, there were some people who will buy to become -- to become an elected official.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Money is -- in this country is very, very important.  Like, well, take President Bush for an example.  He didn't -- he -- he floundered for years and years and years and then in -- and then when his father became Vice President, he sort of kind of made a lot of money.  He got into oil.
L:  Mm.
R:  And he made money in oil, but he was floundering for years.  It's the right connections, you have to -- 
L:  Yeah, oh, yeah.
R:  You have to have the right connections.  If you don't have the right connections, you're in aid of lot -- lot of trouble.
L:  Well, and it's that way from the President, you know, on down to -- to your, you know, normal business, is it's all about who you know, you know. 
R:  Well, what type of business, you know, what might sell in one part of the country won't sell in another part of the country.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, example, what can I use as an example?  Everybody has a digital camera and everybody has a cell phone.  I don't know where people get money to do that.  Because -- 
L:  [NOISE] Sorry.
R:  It's very expensive with a cell phone.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, there are some people have three and four cars and they're mortgaged to the hills with fifty nine houses.  I don't know how people live, I really don't.
L:  I don't either 'cause I see, you know, I see that a lot.   You can see that just driving around.  You know, it's the not so nice neighborhoods with the really nice cars sitting outside and makes you wonder.
R:  Well, I -- I live in a big city, and fortunately where I live, the one thing that saves it -- me is we have mass pratan- -- [MN] mass transportation and plus the fact I can do, I walk a lot.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And if I didn't have that, you know, and I look for bargains otherwise --
