R:  Hi, I'm Trista.
L:  I'm Bob.
R:  We're supposed to talk about family.
L:  Family, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So -- well, I'm big on family.  I've got, ah, four kids and a wife and myself, and...
R:  How old are your children?
L:  Oh, they're, ah, five, eight, ten and twelve.
R:  Wow. [LAUGH] I've got a one and a two year old.
L:  One and a two, ah.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  So new to it, almost.
R:  Yeah, I'm actually very new to it.  Do you -- are your parents still alive?
L:  Ah yeah, they are.  How about yours?
R:  Yeah, my mom is very -- she's terminally ill.  And ah --
L:  Oh, that's too bad.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  Sorry to hear that.
R:  -- she's got a lot of health problems that, um-- and her kidneys and her, um, her organs basically.  She was on Prednisone for so many years because of other health problems, and it destroyed her system.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well Prednisone, actually that -- doesn't that do something to your immune system?
R:  Yes, it does.  She's actually --
L:  It's like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- halts it or something? 
R:  Yeah.  She's actually got Lupus, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, all brought on by the -- of the Prednisone.
L:  Wow.  And that was to help with arthritis?
R:  Well, originally it was to help -- she had gotten an eye disease.  I know this sounds totally weird that this isn't true, it's hard to believe, but [LAUGH] she got an eye disease and they wanted to halt her from going blind and losing her sight, so they put her on Prednisone.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um, she chose to go that route, I mean, she could of, you know, chosen to just, you know, ride it out, but she decided to go with, you know, going the route to prevent her from going blind, so.
L:  Oh.  So did it stop her from going blind?
R:  Ah, yeah.  She has tunnel vision in one eye left, so she's -- and it's been almost twenty years since she was diagnosed, so slowly through the years she's lot a little more, a little more here, but she still can see, and my mom's a very stubborn person [LAUGH] --
L:  Well yeah, I guess.
R:  -- so, to her it's real important that she be able to get the most out of life.
L:  Wow, well that's, that's interesting.  It -- for some reason it just reminds me, I went to a funeral today --
R:  Oh no.
L:  -- and of a friend of mine, not a family, but ah, you know, all his family was there, and -- and it was -- you always see families pull together at something when there's a, a trouble, you know, like that.
R:  Right, right.  Right.
L:  So.
R:  That's actually -- I just start -- I just watched the show ER --
L:  Oh, yeah.  That was just starting here.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And they are talking of the -- well maybe if you're gonna watch it I won't mention it. [LAUGH]
L:  No, I decided I wasn't gonna watch it.  I turned it off and then the phone rang. [LAUGH]
R:  With the -- yeah, the -- um, in the storyline he had actually lost his mother, she died, the -- Carter.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And -- it was all about family.  He, um -- you know, how close she was, and then, um, his girlfriend, she had gotten, um, her -- let's see.  Her brother, he had -- he has schizophrenia, and she went and -- 'cause she went and left him -- left her boyfriend who was, you know, dealing with the death in the family to go make sure that he got his schizophrenia me- or medications to help him, and family -- it sort of reminds me of the topic of family because no matter what happens in family you put, you put that first --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you, you know, whatever it takes.
L:  Wow.  
R:  Yeah.  So are you children -- um, do you work full time, or --
L:  Ah, yeah, I do.  I work --
R:  So you're able to spend time with them, and --
L:  I work during the day.  I do, I'd like to spend more time, but ah, my wife, she takes good care of them, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with four kids it's --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- not like she can work outside the home.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so she pretty much takes care of them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're -- but you know, now they're starting to get into school more, well the five year old's in kindergarten so she only goes half day --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- but, ah, so.  But um, yeah, I really like spending time with my family, although sometimes I probably don't spend enough time.
R:  It's hard to -- it's hard in our economic situation to be able to balance family life.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  I mean, it's just -- I'm actually a freshman going back to school as a thirty year old.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  'Cause my husband lost his job, and --
L:  Well that's too bad.
R:  Yeah.  It's just --
L:  What did he do?
R:  Well, he was -- he's a sign maker, and, um, the place where we -- the area we live is very economically depressed --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and so he actually is on the displaced worker program to enable him to get some training for the area we live in --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- he's actually getting his commercial driver's licence so he can handle larger trucks.
L:  Do large trucking things? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  He doesn't want to do over the road, but he will be -- it'll open up some doors for him that -- you know, 'cause our area is like you take what you can get, basically.
L:  Where -- what area?  I don't know if that's --
R:  I'm in Minnesota.  I'm in central --
L:  Oh, okay.  I could tell you're from the north, but I didn't know where, so.
R:  [LAUGH] I'm in central Minnesota.  How 'bout yourself?
L:  Oh, okay.  Utah.
R:  Oh Utah, okay.
L:  Yeah.  So.
R:  Are you in Park City?
L:  No, but I'm about thirty minutes from there.
R:  Okay.
L:  I'm in Salt Lake City.
R:  Oh sure, okay.
L:  Yeah.  So we had Olympics.  So. [LAUGH] Last year.
R:  Oh, okay.  Oh, yeah.  We were out there a couple of years ago.  My husband and I -- before we had children we decided to do a lot of travelling together --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- we wanted to build our relationship together to make a strong marriage before we decided to have children, so we did a lot of travelling and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- did what we could do to like, you know, experience things.
L:  So did that help or hurt, or --
R:  Yes.  Yes, it did.  It really helped.  We, um -- I was married when I -- I got married when I was nineteen, and so I've been married now almost eleven years coming up here in September.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And, um, we didn't -- of course we have a one and two year old, so we waited -- were able to travel internationally, local -- you know, around the country --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and it actually was really good for us.  We did some missionary work and did a lot of --
L:  Oh, where?
R:  Um, down in Southwest Minnesota.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So I mean it doesn't -- it's not real far away, but it's --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- it was a very isolated area, so.
L:  You can do that kind of work anywhere, so.
R:  Right, right.  And so we sorta just did a lot of different things, and, you know, family means-- to me means, you know, taking it as it comes and adapting it to your family.  So much today people discard their family if things change in their life, but I think you should adapt it.
L:  Oh, I agree.  Well you're supposed -- the idea is -- a lot of people get married because they think they're gonna get something good out of marriage and that their partner will make them happy, but the idea is you have to bring something to marriage, and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and, you know, if it's not going the way you want it, you don't just throw it away, 'cause your next one would be the same.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  What you want to do is build it so that you can grow closer.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And so you try and work on things together to grow closer, instead of deciding, well, this isn't what I wanted.
R:  Yep, I think people focus too many -- to much on their own needs --
L:  Yeah, they do.
R:  -- and yeah.  Yeah, it's -- I can totally -- that's like a pot button for me --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a lot of my friends get -- a lot of my girlfriends are, you know, get divorced after a couple of years because it just doesn't work for them, or it -- they're going separate ways.  And I'm like, you know, if that's the case, then you need to like, you know, work together to accommodate each other.  If you're -- if one person feels unsatisfied then work together to find a way to make it better, instead of saying, oh, this just isn't gonna work, you know.  
L:  Yeah.  It's not magically going to work.
R:  No.
L:  It doesn't matter who they're with.  They -- they'd have to work at it -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- to go the same way.  And if they're going separate ways they've got to work on just try something so that they can go the same way.
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know.  I agree with that.  There's -- that's one of the big problems in the world, and --
R:  Yep.
L:  But --
R:  Definitely, definitely.  So what do you do for a job?
L:  Oh, I manage a blueprint company.
R:  Blueprints?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.  I don't --
L:  Actually we don't actually make real blueprints anymore, they're all black.  But, ah --
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  But --
R:  Oh, what -- blueprints as far as like, like architectural --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- drawings?  Okay.
L:  The architects give us, um, their plans, and we make, you know, copies for them --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and give them back to them.
R:  Okay.
L:  And that's what people build the buildings with.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, but --
R:  Okay.
L:  Now, what do you do?  Do you have --
R:  Well, I'm actually -- I'm a stay at home mom right now, and um, you know, a student --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and um, I'm going for marketing.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I was, um-- I did own a business.  Um, I was a personal chef.
L:  Oh.  What does that mean? [LAUGH]
R:  What I did is I went into individual homes and made meals for them that they could freeze and -- that they could freeze and use in the future.
L:  Oh, okay.  Is it, is it for, like, people that are, um --
R:  For anybody.
L:  -- like shut ins, or is it people that want some really tasty --
R:  Um, it --
L:  -- gourmet type food?
R:  Right.  Um, my specialty was, um, special dietary needs, so I helped people that had, like, you know, um, that were allergic to different things, maybe they were allergic to wheat and they needed special grains --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- um, that was my specialty, I did have clients that, you know, just -- they had different circumstances, I had a single man that needed -- that didn't want to mess with cooking dinner every night, but he wanted something gourmet, so he had me.  And then there's an older person that I worked with that was, um, you know, her husband had passed away and
