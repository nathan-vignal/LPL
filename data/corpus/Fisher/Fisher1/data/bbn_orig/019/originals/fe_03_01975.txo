R:  Hello.
L:  Hello. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  I'm Debbie Weans.
R:  Um, I'm Veronica.  And, um, it was very strange hearing the robot caller, but I guess, um, do you want to start talking about the topic, or do you -- do you want me to start, or --
L:  It doesn't matter to me. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I don't think that the government can really ever monitor all the things that somebody can do behind their closed boardroom door.  And um, luckily a lot of the scandals have not affected me, like thank God I haven't lost my life savings when Enron --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, died or something.  But, you know, a lot of people have and it's terrible.  Um, do you have any thoughts on that?
L:  Yeah, I -- you know, I don't think -- you know, I think there's a lot -- you know, you can do so -- only do so much as far as reporting, and there is just some people have to be honest, and you know, you can regulate -- try to regulate as much as possible, but, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- unless you are in a totally government run state --
R:  Right.
L:  -- there isn't really a lot that, that can be done, and corporate scandals haven't really affected us a whole lot either, so. 
R:  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, it's -- until it starts getting like that book Ninety Eighty Four and they have a camera in every single room everywhere --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- um, they can't possibly monitor all that stuff.  But the thing that's amazing in a way is people can be so evil.  Like, like, you hear about stuff where they'll just play fast and lose with people's life savings, or their retirement plans, or all those things, and it's just for greed, and it's like they just don't care -- they're so selfish and greedy that they can just, you know, destroy the rainforest or ruin people's lives or whatever, or like that whole Mike Milkin[?] thing, or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, how can people be that evil?  It's amazing.
L:  Yeah.  And that they don't -- and it's always, you know, it seems like it's the people at the top -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  That's interesting, yeah.
L:  -- that, you know, they have -- they're making plenty of money anyway, and they're just -- you know.  I guess it's just kind of proof that, you know, there's never enough, you never have enough.
R:  Yeah.  I guess, like, they're in some kind of weird psychological state where they -- I don't know, I can't -- never having known, you know, bazillionaires --
L:  Right.
R:  -- corporate executives or anything, I don't really know.  But they're -- I think they just can't be, like, regular people or something.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, they just can't be happy that, you know, I have enough money to buy what I need and just -- that doesn't seem to be enough --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for some people.  But --
R:  Yeah.  It is very -- and I'm sure they have their whole own mindset about, like, probably in their mind they think, wow, this is great, I'm doing the right thing, or, look how great it is what I'm doing, or something.  Like I, I don't know if they really even feel that what they're doing is wrong, or, or anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Kind of like, you know, drug dealers or people who are in a, a drug culture where drugs are accepted, and then they don't realize as much how awful it seems to people not in that culture.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  And maybe they're just all in their little world of, you know, high finance or something.
L:  Yeah.  And what looks -- looks good.
R:  Right.
L:  What, you know, it looks good for, for now, and kind of live -- almost living for the minute instead of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on it -- really looking long term.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, how this will all play out. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  I don't know, are we allowed to, like, do we have to stay on this topic?
L:  I -- I don't know.
R:  I don't know either.  Like, um, I was -- you know, when you read that little thing in the beginning of the study it say, um, like when people -- I don't -- and they ask you so many questions about the phone that I don't know if this study's about phones --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or is it about people talking or what.  And they -- you know, of course for the study they have to make it deliberately kind of ambiguous and -- 'cause if we knew what the study was it would affect us.  But --
L:  Right.
R:  -- really, it's, like, you gotta wonder.
L:  Yeah, what -- yeah. I'm not sure exactly what -- you know, talking about trying to find information from, from somebody.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Usually when you're talking you're usually trying to find out information from somebody. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  You're just, like, -- it's that the person's a stranger, you're just, like, "Well what are the directions to Independence Hall?", or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, "Do you know what time it is?".  And -- so then they give us these, these big meaty topics to talk about --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, oh, okay yeah, it says, "In your calls please speak on the suggested topic.  Give your opinions and the benefit of your personal experience" -- of which we have none.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "And please ask about the other person's experience and opinions".  Um, yeah, okay.  Well --
L:  Ah, -- 
R:  -- I mean, it was a good choice of a topic, you would think there would be so much to say about it, but I kinda -- like, it's just so remote from us.  Well, from me.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't -- I mean, um, my husband's an actuary, so he works in insurance, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I stay at home.  So.
R:  Right.
L:  So we don't have a lot of -- I mean, we have retirement we're saving for, but other than that we don't really have a lot of, you know, it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- doesn't affect us a lot. [LAUGH] So --
R:  Well the, the scary thing is, like, sometimes it trickles down to just the regular people.  I think that that happened at Enron and like a lot of these places, just like the normal employees who had their retirement plan or whatever, um, that got affected.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  I thought it was sad when I heard, you know, them talk about how every day when they were coming in to work people -- you know, they were just really talking up Enron and, and encouraging people, encouraging their employees to invest all of their money --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in Enron.
R:  I know.  Can you imagine.
L:  And then, you know, then, you know, they're left high and dry.
R:  Right.
L:  Well, you know, while a lot of the executives sold -- they knew when to sell.
R:  Right.
L:  And so they ended up being okay, and --
R:  Yeah, that's terrible.
L:  -- and so, you know, I just thought -- I thought it was pretty sad, you know.  It's one thing to be excited about your company and, and, you know, wanting your employees to be happy with the company and, and happy to work --
R:  Right.
L:  -- there, but it's another thing just to be hyping it up so that they'll -- and -- buy your stock. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh yeah.  Right.  See that's -- it's just evil, that's what I'm saying, it's just, like, evil.  It's heartless and evil.  And then just think about the people who are kind of older.  Like, you know, the younger people probably can pick, pick, pick up the pieces and move on, but like the older people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's -- you know.
L:  The people that were, you know, five to ten years from retirement.
R:  Right.
L:  That, you know, now, you know, they don't have twenty, thirty years of working left --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to make up for -- make up for that.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, see -- well, do -- um, like, does your husband work for a big corporation?  Is it like --
L:  Mutual of Omaha.
R:  Oh, that's a big corporation.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, it's -- you know, it's pretty big but it's a little different in that -- I mean, it's not -- it's, you know, owned by the policy holders --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and so there really isn't stock, per se, to buy -- 
R:  Interesting.
L:  -- of the company.
R:  Is that true of all insurance companies, or is it --
L:  Most.  All mutuals.
R:  Wow.  So is that what mutual means?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  That's --
R:  So --
L:  If a company -- if an insurance company is a mutual company, then it's owned by all the policy holders.
R:  That's so interesting.  [LAUGH] I'm so glad I talked to you.
L:  [LAUGH] So yeah, and I mean, and it's kind of -- you know, most, most insurance companies are kinda set up that way, but, but um, not, not absolutely all of them.  But --
R:  But not all of them.  Wow.  That's kinda nice.  That's like when United did that thing where the employees owned the company, it's, like, all the stock somehow was turned over and all the employees owned it.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't -- not sure how that works, but --
L:  Yeah, there's some, some grocery stores around here like that.
R:  Oh yeah? 
L:  Yeah, that the -- it's employee owned or whatever, so.
R:  Like what -- where are you, are you in Jersey of Philadelphia or what?
L:  In Nebraska.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, 'cause, um, you know, of course University of Pennsylvania's right here in Philadelphia, and I am from Philadelphia and I learned about it in an ad in the local paper, but they're getting people from as far away as Nebraska?
L:  Yeah, I found it on the internet site, actually.
R:  Wonderful.
L:  So, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow.  And um, you really didn't have any kind of an accent that would make me think that you were not from around here or anything.
L:  Yeah, well I don't know, I think that's kind of Nebraska.
R:  Okay.
L:  There isn't a lot of, a lot of accent around.  When you get further south, Kansas and south --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then there's more and more of an accent.  But I'm originally from Kansas, so I used to have the accent before we moved here.
R:  What did it sound like?  I don't even know what a Kansas --
L:  More Southern.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Is it like Texas, 'cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I know what a Texas --
L:  Like, like Texas Southern.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, interesting.  Um, I think -- I feel bad 'cause we're, like, off the topic, but I don't wanna --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- do the topic.
L:  Well, we're sorta. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [several inaudible words]
L:  But, ah, --
R:  Um, corporations, corporations.  What else did they say -- 'cause they said, like, a bunch of things in the prompt, they were just, like, okay, corporations, what do they do --
L:  Yeah, like five hundred -- you know, five, five different things, and then I was, like, "Well, I should of been writing that down", but I wasn't. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um, yeah, 'cause I had the general idea and thought that okay so, um, scandals, um, --
L:  Oh, and how it affected the economy and the stock market, I guess, was one.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  Yeah, ironically like the stock market, it's all made out of those people sort of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and so you hardly know what to think.  But the stock market is so -- I mean, this is going -- so dumb to say, it's obviously unpredictable.
L:  Right.
R:  It's, like, normally a war makes the stock market better, but this made it worse.
L:  Yeah. I -- I don't know if it really -- I think it affected the stocks some because, you know, they just
