L:  Hi, this is Melinda.
R:  Hi, this is Danielle.
L:  Hi Danielle.  Did you catch our topic?
R:  Yes. [inaudible]
L:  I'm sorry, I actually didn't catch it.  I -- I -- I caught the first part, it was corporate conduct.
R:  Yes.
L:  And then -- and then it seemed like the -- the second part didn't quite -- quite agree with that, so I was like, what?
R:  [LAUGH] They were asking us what they thought about it, how it affects us, if we think that the recent scandals have caused, um, the mild recession.
L:  Okay, the recent scandals.
R:  Yes.
L:  Like what?  I'm trying to think of what, recent scandals?
R:  I guess they are thinking as in rec- -- I guess they're thinking about Enron, um -- 
L:  Okay, gosh that's -- 
R:  World com.
L:  That's funny 'cause it's like such old news, you know. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now everybody, you know, you're thinking about the war, you know. 
R:  There's already been a movie made about, ah, Enron and all like [inaudible] had the fifty minutes of fame.
L:  Yeah.  What's your name? 
R:  Danielle.
L:  Danielle, okay, okay.  This is my first one I've done on this, so -- 
R:  Me too, me too.
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH] I got a call yesterday on education and I was like, oh, I don't know and so I -- I said no.  But I was like, oh, well, what the heck, you know, I'll do it.
R:  Yes.
L:  Gosh, so corporate scandals, let's see, let me think of some of the most recent ones.  Um, [SIGH] how about all the -- the CEOs accepting --
R:  Oh, all this -- the way they -- the new way they pocket their money.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Mm.
L:  And all the stock that's been put underneath the table, um. 
R:  Right.
L:  And people cashing in and making millions of dollars.
R:  I know, and it affects me because I'm a graduating senior -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- from college and I've seen all the kids who are -- I'm not, um, a business major, but all the kids who would have went to those fields, are now coming into like, um, more, like, non profit sector type work of which I would have gone into.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so now the job market for the jobs I would -- like teaching, um, Peace Corps, all the, I guess what people call crunchy jobs -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, are being swarmed by these kids who are getting turned away from corporate America.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Because they're not -- they're not -- they're just not hiring, um, because these kids really are taught for four years how to sell themselves, how to, like, put themselves out there no matter what, if they know how to do it or not, they are getting all these jobs and getting into teaching America, they are getting into the Peace Corps, they're getting -- they're becoming, like, usually, you know, anyone could go in the Peace Corps, you just have to be willing and able.
L:  Right.
R:  And now it's just such a -- it's such a process.  You used to be in line, and, you know, into these programmes and teach for America, they were dying for people to -- to just apply and now they have too many applicants.  So I think in that respect, it's -- it's -- I'm dealing with it because I'm dealing with, ah, a more competitive job market.  It's like come out of school, um, and I came into school in nineteen ninety nine, boom of the economy, everyone is still doing really well, um, you know, computer stocks were still out- outrageous, you know, going into -- into this, like, yeah, I can do really well in the, um -- in the helping industry.
L:  Right.
R:  As everyone else goes off into, you know, Wall Street and here I am, and I'm at an ID as teacher and, um, my -- the school I go to, I go to school. I go to the University of Pennsylvania and have Laughton Business School, no more on the graduate business school and so I'm, like, sitting next to the most competitive people in the world.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] And there they are taking my job.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  As a teacher.  So that's the way I'm feeling it.  I'm feeling it that -- that way.
L:  That's interesting for me 'cause, like, you're in school and I'm in the corporate world and I think I feel in -- in some respects the same way because, um, let's see, I worked for the dot com industry during the dot com boom.
R:  Yes.
L:  And, um, you know, we were building web sites for companies like, Walgreens and, you know, really big companies, are paying big money to have -- to have their -- an Internet presence and to have the same look and feel on the Internet that they did in their -- in their stores, and right about the time that the dot com industry fell, that's when you had all these corporate scandals.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, start happening, and I think that really contributed to, um, the dot com industry failing as hard as it did.  I think if you wouldn't have had all those scandals, um, the dot com industry, at least probably more of the dot com industry would have been able to survive, and as a result, I mean, everybody -- pretty much everyone that I knew in the dot com industry got laid off.  You know, companies went bankrupt.  My company went bankrupt.  Ah, people got laid off and all of a sudden you had this glut of technical people, um, that needed jobs in the market.  And, um, I was actually off work for about, I guess probably three or four months, um, which was actually ended up being good timing because I had had just had a baby so, um, I was able to stay home, you know, a little longer than I had anticipated.  Um, but when I came back to work, um, you know, working for a company that makes, um, who makes, ah, testers for -- for chips for companies like Intel and Motorola that put computer chips into their, you know, their telephones and their computers.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I'm an information security professional and, um, so I, you know, do all the technical and procedural stuff on how to secure information assets.  But our company, um, I think is still in some respects reeling from the scandals as well as the -- the, you know, the fall of the dot com industry.  You know, our stock prices are still low, um, you know, as a result um, when I signed up, my options were really high, um, so my -- my stock options for signing up, you know, are worth nothing now.  Um, the good news is that as we get stock incentives and stock bonus, you know, now, we're getting the lower prices.  Um, but, I mean, definitely, definitely it's affected, ah, I think the whole corporate world as a whole.
R:  Mm.  Let's say I think it's also funny is that, um, people as you mentioned the dot com fall, I think that people really weren't asking questions and asking in, like, I remember the hot question was, where is all this money coming from?  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And how -- when -- when are we going to see, you know, when these companies are actually going to make money?  Like, everyone was asking, where is, you know, [inaudible] where is it?  Like, where -- where is the money that it's earning?  Um, that -- because we have the stock that's worth all this stuff, but, like  --
L:  Right.
R:  Where's -- where's your output?  And I think that maybe -- as you -- as you're bringing it up, I'm thinking that maybe -- that might be the callous looms other to other sectors, other industries like, yeah, where's yours too? [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, we think about all the millions of dollars that was spent, you know. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  To get an Internet presence and -- and you think about all the scandals and even some of the -- the scandals that didn't come out, you know, I think about people that were in my company that were, like, um, just, you know, gurus, you know, that you -- you pay top dollar for them and they -- they abused, um, their privileges, you know.  I knew one guy that worked out of California and, um, he -- he expensed, um, suits, you know, to the company because he was just, you know, he was so good, the company didn't want to lose him and so they -- they did things like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think that, you know, doing things like that, you know, it started at the bottom but it starts at the bottom and -- and it gets approved, you know, it goes all the way to the top, the corruption. 
R:  I think almost it's like a culture, it's like that's -- that's how you're supposed to behave, and I think it's an idea that people have that that's what you're pos- supposed to do so that I think -- I think -- I think what happens is a lot of people come into these positions newly, behave that way and then it -- it kind of backfires on you.  Like, I know here at school, like, the culture, the -- the idea that people at college think they're going to behave in their -- in their next job and [inaudible] they're so out of touch with reality.  I'm not in the business, I'm not looking people like do you really think it's going to be like that, like, [LAUGH] do you really think you are going to have like this grey, like, right out of college, like all this, you know, all these beautiful things that, you know, it's not going to be -- what world are you living in?  What TV show are you watching?  What loser is watching?
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I think that's interesting, how people -- how, like, it gets feed -- it gets fed back to us, like, these myths of how you are supposed to behave in the corporate sector and then -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you do it and it all backfires on you and you just -- and then your excuse is, well, you know, this is how everyone does it and this really isn't how everyone does it, it's how you are doing it.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and absolute messes it all up.
L:  And I -- I think of that too, like how it affected our company.  Price Waterhouse does our -- does our, um, financial auditing but they also come in and they do contract technical work for us.  Well, we can't -- we can't contract with Price Waterhouse any more on the technical audits.
R:  Right.
L:  Because we have to keep them separate now.
R:  Right.
L:  So that's, you know, definitely a way, you know, another way that it's -- that it's been affected.  But then on the positive side, I look at my company and [COUGH] I look at when all this happened, I think they did all the right things, you know, they immediately said, you know, they -- they -- they, um, disclosed their accounting practices, they separated themselves from, you know, financial and technical audits, um, [COUGH].  One of the things I really like about the company too is they actually do a lot of, um, -- we do a lot of volunteer work around the -- around the Boston area because I live in Boston, um, and I -- I like that.  I wish more companies would do that 'cause I think that would help alleviate some of the -- some of the, um, you know, stuff that we're still seeing, you know, some of the -- 
R:  Right.
L:  You know, that we're still seeing, the negative stuff from -- from all those scandals. I think our --
R:  But I've seen -- 
L:  -- company's more proactive.
R:  Yeah.  What I've seen coming up here, it's -- as they are students are proposing classes on corporate ethics.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  I was in a class full of students who were learning a proposal for, um, corporate ethics and civic responsibility.
L:  Wow.
R:  In --
