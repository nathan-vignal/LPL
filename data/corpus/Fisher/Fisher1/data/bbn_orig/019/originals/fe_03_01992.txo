L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, my name is Maria.
L:  Hi, my name's Susan.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  Good.  
L:  Go ahead, this is my first time I've talked on one of these, is it yours?
R:  Same here.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, well, um, I'm in Hawaii.  Where are you?
R:  I'm Minnesota.
L:  Oh, Minnesota! Wow!
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, well, um, --
R:  Um, could you adjust the topic, and everything?  'Cause I'm not --
L:  Yes, I guess, um, the topic is as I understand it, what corporate, um, misdee- -- meeds -- misdeeds  have done to affect us, right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, well, I guess, I would have to say that it is costing, ah,  us in various ways because of the [inaudible] Enron, and there's, I think there's a whole lot more of that going on than what we even know, 
R:  Mhm.
L:   and, um, we're actually all paying for it probably in higher taxes, 
R:  Yeah, that's one thing I don't like. [LAUGH]
L:  Me either, and, so, what do you think?
R:  Well, um, I guess, pretty much the same stuff, but, um, so, is it basically just, like, what, um,  what are, like, the misdeeds, though?
L:  Well, what they were doing is they were, um, giving, um, like, false information to investors showing that the company was  [MN] it's not just Enron, there's other big corporations are doing the same thing, 
R:  Mhm.
L:   where they're showing, um, false information on their books to make their stock value look higher, 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:   so then the investors bought the stock  bought stock based on information that they were given which was false, and a lot of people have lost their money, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a lot of people are being affected by this because they had their pension money in, um, stock with those corporations that have done some of this, so a lot of people are going to be affected because they're going to have to work longer than they planned, um, 'cause their retirement money is gone, --
R:  Mhm.
L:   so, that's one nother way that it's going to be affected, and, ah, actually, I mean, that's the way, uh, people are going to be affected, 
R:  Yeah.
L:   um, 
R:  Well, what do you think the Government can do?  To fix 
L:  Well, for one thing, I think the Government needs to make an example of those executives that were responsible, 
R:  Mhm.
L:   and I think that they should get really big prison terms and, I think that their assets should be seized so that other executives, um, in other companies, um, are warned that they can't do this and get away with it, 
R:  Mhm.
L:   because a lot of those guys got not only when they were ready to close up, um, they walked out with gigantic big bonuses, 
R:  Right.
L:   like, millions and millions of dollars in bonuses, 
R:  But they really don't deserve it, 
L:  Mhm.  -- that sh- --
R:  Yeah --
L:   no, that should have gone to the stockholders, and to the -- back into that company, 
R:  Mhm.
L:   so, anyway, 
R:  Yeah.  I think they go make tougher laws, so, --
L:  Yes.  Mhm.
R:   you know, I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, yes, yeah, I agree, um, although I don't know, um, if making more laws is going to do it, because what these people did was illegal anyway.
R:  I suppose, doing it all behind their backs and stuff, 
L:  Right, mhm, -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, and, let's see.
R:  Did they get, like, punished or anything, or you don't know?
L:  Well, I don't think, so far, I, um, 
R:  Uh-huh?
L:   uh, they're all under  a lot of these guys are under indictment, and -- but, um, um, what was I going to say, um, there's a l- -- there's a whole lot more [MN] out there [MN] in other big companies that hasn't even come to light, I'm sure, because Enron and these other  companies that have been caught recently, 
R:  Mhm.
L:   um, that went under, um, there's other ones that have been doing the same thing, because there were people on Enron's board of directors that are also on other big gigantic major corporations in the United States, so, 
R:  Mhm.
L:   um, but the main thing is, they want to know why we think that's going to affect people.  Um, what do you think? When big companies go under, because of, um, or big companies do, um, illegal or fraudulent things, how do you think that it affects you?
R:  Well, it, um, well, it doesn't it, like, make us pay more -- well, first of all, tax money and stuff, so we're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we lose our money by doing that, 
L:  Mhm.
R:   and, um, well, I don't really know, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause I'm only in ninth grade and everything, so 
L:  You're in ninth grade?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  I kind of thought so.
R:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] it's kind of --
L:  Um, yeah, um, well, what you, ah, let's see, how can I say, um, what else are we supposed to  there was another topic on there that we were supposed to talk about.  Um, do you remember what it was?
R:  Um, no, not really, well, because, my mom gave it to me. [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, your mom gave it to you?
R:  Yeah, right, but I'm supposed to talk to you.  
L:  Oh, [LAUGH]
R:  Well, she did write something down about this, though.  So, that's all, like, sorry, no, some of this stuff is, she said, well, it said that, um, they could also, like, the Government, --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- they can audit by outside agencies to help honesty, 
L:  Oh, right.  That's a good idea.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  Um, but, um, they had, um, um, big acc- -- they had big accounting firms that also went -- went under, because of this, because they participated and allowed  allowed -- didn't actually present  they knew that the information that they were putting out was -- was -- was fraudulent, 
R:  Mhm.
L:   ah, what was it, Young, I forgot -- I forgot who it was, um, Arthur Young, was it?
R:  I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  Could be, I  I've heard of Enron and stuff, but 
L:  Mhm.
R:   I didn't really keep up much with 
L:   Mhm.
R:   what they do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But 
L:   so, um, you're in Minnesota and you're in the ninth grade?
R:  Yeah.  So 
L:  Oh, 
R:  So, --
L:  Okay.  Um, 
R:  Is it, like, but, wasn't it sort of, like, a computer thing, 
L:  What?
R:   En- -- like, Enron, like, they were 
L:  No, it was a -- they were, I think, they were, like, um, it had something to do with, um, energy.
R:  Oh, I don't know, [inaudible] [LAUGH] 
L:   but, anyway, they're not the only ones that did this, also, 
R:  Mhm.
L:   um, let's see, what else could the Government do, um,  basically, they're going to have to find these people who were in charge and, um, all do prison terms, because otherwise, when they see that they can get away with this kind of stuff, it'll just continue, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, 
R:  I think we should just get rid of all of them.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] somehow, --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I don't know, though.
L:  Yeah, but, um, let's see, so, did they teach  tell you anything about this in school?
R:  Not much,  
L:  No?
R:   well, 'cause, like in history, -- we're learning about geography, so, 
L:   the what?
R:  Geography?
L:  Oh.
R:  So, it's not really on this type of topic, 
L:  Oh, --
R:  -- but 
L:  -- okay, well, when they  when they originally called they had a different topic and then, somehow, they -- they -- it got changed to, ah, corporate, um, um, fraud, and whatever.
R:  Mhm.  That's kind of weird.
L:  Mhm. [inaudible]
R:  But you don't remember what the other topic was?
L:  Well, it had to do with that also, but I can't remember.  I should have wr- --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:   and the recording talks rather fast so I couldn't  um, it wasn't clear to me, 
R:  Mhm.
L:   um, let's see  gee, ten minutes goes  seems like a long time, doesn't it?
R:  I know! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] it does!
L:  Um, 
R:  Especially when you have to stay on, like, this topic, you know?
L:  Y- Yeah.  Um, what time is it there?
R:  It's, um, six twelve.
L:  Oh, it's only one ten here.
R:  Oh, really?  Wow!
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, 
R:  That's kind of 
L:  Um, what was your name again?
R:  Maria.
L:  Maria, I'm Susan, I- I'm sorry, I forgot your name.
R:  That's okay.
L:  It's okay.  So, um, let's see, what else could we say about the fact that  how this is going to affect  well, it affects the stock market, because people are afraid to invest now, 
R:  Yeah.
L:   in addition to the stock market going down, down, down, down, this added to the  to the, um, lack of confidence, 
R:  Mhm.
L:   'cause [MN] --
R:   and I think that, you know, once  like, if they get away with what they're doing now, 
L:  Mhm.
R:   you know, then more people are going to be, like, oh, well, we can do this  like, people, like, my age, and stuff, they're going to be, 
L:   Mhm.
R:   oh, well, we can do this and get
