R:  Hello. 
L:  Hi, there.  My name is Jaime.
R:  I'm Linda.
L:  Hi, there.
R:  I live in the Northwest.  Where are you?
L:  I'm in, ah, central -- I've over in Illinois.  I'm right in the -- smack dab in the -- almost in the middle.
R:  Oh, yeah.  The middle. 
L:  [LAUGH] Pretty much -- 
R:  We're over in Lexington, so.
L:  -- pretty much.
R:  So, the topic is family.
L:  Family.
R:  So tell me about your family.
L:  Mm, I have a very -- I have a relatively large family.  And we all pretty much live pretty close together, there's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the rest -- some of us, because it is pretty large, are spread out.  So there's somebody in basically every time zone.  But most of us live out here, and we see each other quite frequently, and --
R:  Well that's good.
L:  And we're very close.
R:  Are you married?
L:  I, um, live with my boyfriend --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I have a son.  So.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah --
R:  Well, we have five children.
L:  You have how many?
R:  We have five children.
L:  Holy cow. [LAUGH]
R:  And they live, um, hither and yon also.  But most of them at the moment are in Provost, Utah.  They're finishing up at Brigham Young University, and one graduates tomorrow.
L:  Oh.  Well congratulations.
R:  But one's in Denver, and one's in Houston, and one will be moving here next month, which we're very happy about.  
L:  Yeah, that's great.
R:  So.  
L:  So you have a, a large family, soon to be larger? [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, and we now have five grandchildren, which just happened -- it seemed like overnight.
L:  Yeah.
R:  When you've got multiple kids getting married fairly closely --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- then I was kidding them that they were all on the two year baby plan, because it seemed like we babies two years ago, and now we have babies again.
L:  Well congratulations.  That's great.
R:  [LAUGH] So.
L:  So you thought Christmases were expensive before? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, no kidding. [LAUGH] And the going to see all the babies thing.  My goodness.  Now that's expensive, especially when you're talking Denver and Texas, and --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Travelling.
R:  So, yeah.  It's gonna be crazy.  But oh well. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, oh well.  You asked for it, you had five of them. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.  I signed up, so I guess I need to do it, huh.
L:  Well that's great.
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  So you have a large family then too.
R:  Yeah.  But my, ah, my natural family from, you know, just me and my sister, we just had a small family.  My dad passed away and my mom is, ah, quite ill at the moment, so --
L:  Oh.  Sorry to hear that.
R:  -- um, I have a small grown up family, but we, we more than made up for it with the other family.
L:  Yeah.  How about your husband?
R:  Um, he has two brothers, one lives in Texas and one lives in Oregon.  We don't see the one in Texas hardly ever.  His mother was ninety five and died in October, and so the brother stopped in, first time we'd seen him in a long, long long time.  Um, but that was kinda nice, 'cause we hadn't seen him for a while.  Other than that, that's it.
L:  That's it? [LAUGH]
R:  That's the lot of us. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  We have the most, with the children of course, but neither of us had very big families.  So how many are there of you?
L:  Um, well there's -- well, I don't know.  There's actually just me and my sister.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But -- and she's pregnant --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, with her first baby.  And, um, my son is only six months old.
R:  Oh, fun.
L:  So we're just getting started.
R:  They are so cute.
L:  And, um, let's see.  My, my dad -- my family's pretty large because my dad is one of five children --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- my mom is one of three, but they've all got at least two kids apiece. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Two to five apiece, so, yeah.  And two being -- I guess, I guess it's really not that much larger than most people's families, but I think because we're so concentrated. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  We see each other, so at any family get together there's, you know, twenty plus people.
R:  Lots.
L:  Yeah.  So.
R:  I was just counting to mother's day, because my kids are actually all gonna come home, it just happened --
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  -- that like coincidence that three or four of them were going to be this direction, so we called up the others and said, if I pay your ticket will you come?  Well, of course, they said yes.
L:  Of course, yes.
R:  So, we're gonna have over twenty people here for mother's day.  It's gonna be just crazy.
L:  So -- and where are you at again?
R:  In Washington state.
L:  In Washington state.  Huh.
R:  So.
L:  What kind of weather are you guys having up there right now?
R:  Oh, it's been raining the last couple of days, and cooler than normal.  It's been in the sixties -- I mean, the fifties instead of the sixties where it normally is.  Although the last weekend, oh it was glorious.  We went outside, mowed the lawn, fertilized, dug the weeds, you know.  All that kind of stuff --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it was absolutely beautiful.  Just --
L:  Oh good, then hopefully you'll have some good not so rainy weather when mother's day comes around.
R:  I hope so, 'cause with that many people and little kids --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  I mean, we have a good yard for family, we have a trampoline and the hot tub and climby things and, and other stuff, but you know, if it's pouring rain, that's about the last thing you wanna do, is go send the little kids out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and get totally muddy and gross.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So at least now we don't have our -- our family dog died last --
L:  Oh no.
R:  -- year.  But -- and that was hard when, um, it would rain, because she was a Samoyed and she'd go outside and --
L:  You had a Samoyed?
R:  -- because she's so white, she would just get -- I mean, dirty gross when it was raining bad.
L:  Yeah, I have a Samoyed too.
R:  What -- oh, do you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's largely a house dog.
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  So.
L:  And when their fur gets wet it's saturated. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, it is.  And --
L:  She's wet for hours.
R:  -- it stinks. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, it stinks terrible.
R:  Yes, it does.
L:  It stinks worse than any other dog I've ever owned.  When she gets wet anyway.
R:  When I lived in Kansas City we had our first Samoyed and I, I belonged to the, ah, Samoyed club that was there, oh, many years ago --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- thirty years ago now, I guess.  And, ah, that was kinda fun 'cause I learned more about the breed, and there was one lady that took the wool from them and [inaudible] it, and then made it into things.  And I thought, wow --
L:  Oh, really.
R:  I'm not sure I'd want a smelly dog anything, but --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- I was rather amazed that she had done that.  So.
L:  I think I heard something about that, how people were lining their gloves and hats, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- stuff like that with...
R:  Yeah.  So how'd you get, um, hooked up with this, ah, study group?  How'd you hear about them?
L:  Um, on line.
R:  On line.
L:  On line.
R:  A friend of mine called us up and said, hey, you might want to do this.
L:  Yeah.  There's a, there's a woman on line, her name is Angela Smith.  And she runs --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Huh?
R:  Does the Money Network Shoppers thing?
L:  Yeah.  She is -- right.  She's got her hand in a few things, but that would be, I think, her primary --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, thing.  And then -- and I, and I got it through email from her --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then as a matter of fact, once I'd already participated in, ah, a couple of calls, um, another website, um, brought the study to my attention, but at which point I was already, um, you know --
R:  [several inaudible words] yeah.
L:  -- involved, yeah.  But I've seen it a couple of different places.  But.
R:  Yeah, I think I heard from her too, now that I think back on it, it was in an email.
L:  You do the -- you do mystery shopping as well? 
R:  Yep, sometimes.
L:  Yeah, I do too.
R:  In the -- in the summer.  I work in the school system, so I -- I don't do a lot during the school year, but in the summer I, I do.  It's nice to make just some extra spending money, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- now that I'm older, my kids have grown up, I have a little [inaudible] convertible, and so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I love just driving around and enjoying being outside and it's not too hot here in the summer, so I thought mystery shopping was just a fun thing to do, 'cause I could drive some place with a purpose, and --
L:  Right, right.  As opposed to just driving around aimlessly.
R:  -- walk around for a little while, and you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it pays for the gas, and it's kinda fun.
L:  Sure.
R:  Different than anything I normally do, so.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you work?
L:  I -- no, right now I don't.  I did up until I had my son, I --
R:  Uh-huh.  Well good for you.
L:  -- worked the morning I went into labor, but -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- but now, no.  Actually I've been blessed with --
R:  Good for you.  It's best to stay home with the little kids.
L:  -- being able to stay home.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's hard to go back --
R:  They're only little once, and you only get one chance to form them. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  You are exactly right.
R:  So good for you.
L:  You are exactly right.  I just -- I hope that he, ah -- oh, well, I don't know, I hope a whole lot of things for him, but. 
R:  It's, it's amazing, isn't it, when you have your first baby, you immediately kinda see things differently because you have all these hopes and aspirations for your child, and, and you want things really badly to work right for them.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I can't say that, um, how I thought I would feel becoming a parent is so different as that just the, the priorities aren't exactly in line as where I thought they would have been.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It was like, um, seconds after he was born I was like, wow, he's so cute, I don't want him to go to school. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It was like, oh, you know what I mean, I was always like, oh, push him to be independent, ra ra ra, and I --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- was kind of always, before I was kinda like, you know, I believed in the crying out method and that kind of stuff, and then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- once he was born I was like, how cruel.  You know what I mean.  I was like, how could anyone do this?  But, um --
R:  Well, here's my word to the wise, having raised five kids who were all honors students and did well, and whatever --
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  -- make sure you teach them young who's the boss.  Now you don't have to be mean --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- but it's very important while they're little --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as in very little, that they understand that, that --
L:  Establish the chain of command. [LAUGH]
R:  That's right.  That you have the ultimate say.
L:  Right.
R:  So even when they're little and crying, they think -- you've figured that out already, I'm sure, that they, ah, they know who, who's in charge, and boy do you pay for it as a teenage if they didn't learn it young.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.
R:  There's my unsolicited advice.
L:  Thank you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Thank you, yeah.  I would -- I, I'm aware just from some kids that I've babysat, and I'm being -- I'm, with a large family I'm the oldest of sixteen grandchildren --
R:  Oh, yes.
