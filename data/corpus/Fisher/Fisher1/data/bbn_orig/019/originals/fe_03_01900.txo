R:  Hi, my name is Nancy.
L:  Hi, my name is Shula[?].
R:  Shula?
L:  Yes.
R:  Hi Shula, how are you?
L:  I'm fine, how are you?
R:  Fine, thanks.  Ah, talking about family.  Do you want to start, or should I share my --
L:  You can start.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Well my first thought of family is that bonds should not be broken short of something really heinous, that we accept in family that we might not accept, what we wouldn't accept in other people.  And that is really my, my strong belief on it.
L:  Um, for me, family means a bond, you know where you can connect and you can talk about anything with this person.
R:  Um.
L:  And if you, you know it's like a confidante also. 
R:  Um.
L:  And you can depend on that person for anything.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Okay, I, I agree with the depending on them, I think family, I believe family should always be to, be able to depend on each other.  I wish I had the experience of family being confidantes, because I know that in some of my immediate family, my sister, one sister in particular, we're not, we're not confidantes, and we're often at odds.  And another one, I, is a confidante, so I, I don't have that experience unfortunately with every member of my family.  My mother I do, my dad I don't.  So it's, it's a little more neutral when I talk to him.
L:  Oh, um, um, I have a sister's like one year --
R:  Um.
L:  -- older than me.
R:  Um.
L:  And she's my confidant, and, you know, we grew up together.
R:  Um.
L:  I got married before she did.  She got married, she moved to where I live.  [LAUGH]
R:  Um.
L:  You know, 'cause she married someone, you know, where I live.  
R:  Um.
L:  So, you know, we get along great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We don't have an argument or anything.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well I do, I've got one of those sisters too.  It's funny that you said a year, that you're a year apart, I, I remember noticing this when I was, uh, a teenager, one of my dearest friends had a sister a year younger, another good friend had a sister I think a year and a half older, and I, I remember saying to my mom once, I think when siblings are close in age, no more than two years apart, they tend to be really like friends, and in my situation, ah, we're five years apart, so when I think of the sister that I'm close to, she's the oldest one, she's actually a little over eight years older than me.
L:  Um.
R:  But the other one is five years older.  And, so, so the one that I, I've always had a better um, communicating relationship with is the oldest, and I'm the youngest, and it, even, even that we can share and talk about just everything.  Now, now less, but I remember when I was younger, especially when I was a teenager and in my early twenties and that kind of thing.  There's a difference, you know, the eight plus years was different than when you're in your forties and fifties, you know, it's like being fifteen and twenty four miles apart, just miles apart.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well I'm from a huge family [LAUGH] so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, we're pretty close.  And, you know, I'm the youngest girl, I have two younger brothers.
R:  Mm.
L:  And there was thirteen of us, so --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, your mom, your mom was, was a busy lady. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, we didn't, we didn't have that, I mean I've got a, you know it's funny about family, I, I always thought of my family up until I was on my own in my early twenties as a really close family, because um, we did everything together, and so there were three kids in my family, but aunts, uncles and children, everything was together, you know.  Every weekend, every holiday, every, everything, you know Friday night watching TV, it was, it was always a family thing as far as aunts, cousins being there, uncles being there, it was, it was really very centered around the family, and so I always think of it as, as close.  But as, as I got older, especially as I get into my teenage years and my older cousins and my sisters started going off in their directions and married and whatnot, it um, yeah, it definitely changed, especially the sister that I, I was never close to, we just never, we butted heads, you know we just ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We, she, she says dysfunctional and I'll be, you know, I'll agree with her.  Oh, she was, she, I'm, I'm sure that she [LAUGH] she probably wanted to ring my neck a whole lot of times, and she tried, too.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Um, and then the older one was the mediator, she was the, the diplomat.
L:  Well see, because my family's so big, and the years so different, my older sisters usually take, used to take care of us and --
R:  Mm.
L:  So that was like a mother to us too.
R:  Yeah, yeah that was my oldest sister.  Definitely.
L:  So you know, now, family is like, just there, we won't, you know for my mom, my mom and dad has the same birthday, so usually we have them a party, go home for their birthday every year.
R:  Um.  Um.   
L:  And, you know, just everybody comes home.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, and usually if we don't take our husbands with us, all of us just stay at the house.  [LAUGH]
R:  Um.  And it's just as much fun, probably.
L:  Well, yes.
R:  Yeah.  It probably is more fun.  I think the thing, the nice thing about family sat in as, as you get older, you spend less time with your birth family because you've got your own, which is usually created through marriage.
L:  Um.
R:  And so the, the family contact from the childhood and before marriage days, you know, is, is less.  And so that's the sad part.  But then on the other hand, when, when families do get together as we're adults, it, it seems a lot more precious.
L:  Um.
R:  Because of the memory, so, yeah.  That, uh, families, families are an education, I, I --
L:  Yeah.  I'm, I'm learning firsthand.  I'm, I've got an eight month old now, so --
R:  Oh, you do?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  I have no children.  So this is, this is interesting about family, because I have to, I've got to wonder.  I'm, I'm the youngest of three daughters, and they all, no boys in the family, and I'm gonna be forty seven in a week.
L:  Um.
R:  And my two older sisters, no children either.  None of us had children.
L:  Oh, oh, well.
R:  All of us --
L:  This is my first.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And my last.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I, I got to wonder at this point if I, if, if I ah, really had this wonderful family life that I thought I had when I was, when I was a kid, because we've all had a divorce, in the case of my middle sister --
L:  Um.
R:  -- two.  [LIPSMACK] And, none of us had children and it's um, I definitely think about that, what, what happened.
L:  I thought, I thought I had gotten away. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So you have one and, and, and you're, you're done.
L:  I'm done.
R:  You're done.  Okay.
L:  I'm done.  No --
R:  Well --
L:  No more.
R:  That's, that's good.
L:  She, she's, she's a hand, she's a preemie. 
R:  I, and, how old is she?
L:  She's, now she's, she's turned eight months on Saturday.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And she was, um, thirty weeks.  So she weighed a pound and fifteen ounces.
R:  Wow.  Wow.
L:  And --
R:  What, and she's doing okay now? 
L:  She's, she didn't have any problems from day one.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  She had no, you know, didn't have to have oxygen, or --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- you know, only thing she had was like the feeding tube on her.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, the monitors that they put on the fingers.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, she's been busybody day one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, so she keeps me going. [LAUGH]
R:  That's wonderful.  [LAUGH] That's wonderful.  Is all your family still in the same area, like within fifty miles of each other?
L:  Oh, no.
R:  No.
L:  From one, I had my mom and dad is in North Carolina, I still have sisters and brothers in North Carolina.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Then I have sisters in Florida, a sister in Louisiana, a brother in Marylyn[?], a brother in California, and then there, my sister's here, so  --
R:  Mm.  
L:  It's all over.
R:  where are you?
L:  I'm in Pennsylvania, near Philly.
R:  Oh.  Near Philly, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, I um, I'm, I'm the furthest away, I'm in California too.  And everyone else is on the east coast.  My parents are in Florida, one sister's in Florida, and the other is in Rhode Island, and then the rest are overseas, they're in Portugal.
L:  Mm.
R:  Because that's where we all came from.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So these, the family that's in Portugal, my aunts and cousins, they were, they were here, we were all in Rhode Island as I was growing up.  
L:  Mhm.  
R:  And it was only when I was in my twenties when, you know that they went back, because that's where they grew up, and they just came here to work for ten or fifteen years and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and go back.  So it's, one I haven't seen in fourteen years.
L:  Mm.
R:  She's my oldest, well she's, um, well she's eighty five now.  And she's, you know unless I go over there, she's not gonna travel over here, I don't think she, she ever planned to travel from the day she went back.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Just a different, different world.  And, and as her kids got older and started having families, they all went back one by one.  One of my cousins who's just a year older than me, I was close to her when I was a teenager, and, and she's back in Portugal with her kids, her daughter just got married.  
L:  Right.  
R:  Early twenties.  And her son, I believe, I don't even know what her son's doing, but he's around twenty, twenty one.  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  So it's really, we're really spread apart.  Really.  Really.  [LAUGH]
L:  It's, it's fun sometimes to be spread, because that way you can get to travel and, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  
L:  It's an adventure, I think. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah it is.
L:  'Cause I like to go into Florida and I like going to California and, you know --
R:  Where in California is your brother?
L:  Um, they just moved from San Diego to Tuelivista[?].
R:  Oh, okay, they're in southern.  I'm in the Bay Area.
L:  Yeah, they just um, bought a house.
R:  Mm.
L:  In Tuelivista.  
R:  Mhm.  
L:  They have twins.
R:  Nice.
L:  Boy and a girl.  That's the best way to do it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's the way to have a family.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, do it, yeah, get both of them.  I always thought that.  I always thought that if I had kids, I'd rather, I'd rather have two of them at the same time.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean it's a lot harder I think that first --
