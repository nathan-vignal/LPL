R:  My name's Bob.
L:  Hi, Bob, Jay.  How you doing?
R:  Jay, oh good, how are you?
L:  Terrific.
R:  Good.  So, we're supposed to talk about what the word family means to us.
L:  Yeah.  What's it mean to you?
R:  Well, I'd say it basically means my group of, group of people that I'm related to that I live with and, and that we pull together, and, ah, we love one another, basically.
L:  Sounds about right.
R:  So how does it -- what does it mean to you?
L:  Ah, family to me is, ah -- I grew up in an Italian religious family --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so it was, you know, lots of people together every Sunday, some of those people are related to you, a lot of them were, but some of them were just there every week, you could depend on them, count on them, ask them for favors, you know, they cared about what happened to you, you cared about what happened to them.
R:  Yeah, that makes sense.
L:  And that, that was -- and they didn't necessarily have to be related to me, but most of my family was, but now that I'm older, moved on in life, my family lives in other parts of the country and I don't get to see them as I did when I was a child.  To me, ah, they're still my family, but ah, I've also come up with that, that family circle of friends.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And I consider those people family too, like friends that at the drop of the dime, five o'clock in the morning, they were -- needed to go to the hospital or were in a car accident or stranded, that I would just drop what I was doing and go get them.  And I feel that those people feel the same way about me.  It's a selected few, but I consider those people family too.
R:  Yeah, I agree.  I've got some friends that, ah, I would -- well, different ones throughout my life I've considered family, just because they're the ones I could depend on, ah, the people that, ah, you know, I cared about and really wanted to make sure everything went well for them.  That kind of thing.
L:  Absolutely.  Or like the -- like a friend of my mom's, I always called her Aunt Sheila.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  She wasn't my aunt, [LAUGH] you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  But, like, she went to all the weddings, she knew my grandparents, you know, like everybody knew my Aunt Sheila.  My other cousins called her Aunt Sheila.  She's just Aunt Sheila.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Couldn't tell you her last name, 'cause she was Aunt Sheila.
R:  Yeah, she was just --
L:  We weren't even related.
R:  -- Aunt Sheila.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That makes sense.  Now I under -- ah, you know, the stereotype of Italian families is, is a pretty close knit family with lots of people coming over for dinner every week.  Is that kinda how it was for you?
L:  Yeah, well those, those stereotypes, they're based on a lot of truth. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, I don't care what stereotype it is, or who you're referring to.  Like, that stereotype was probably started by Italian people.
R:  I would guess.
L:  [LAUGH] And then, you know, they let the secret out and everybody else found out, so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's about right.  Um, it's a shame because I probably saw the tail end of it, being older.  I'm in my mid thirties.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But like my little sister didn't get to see it as much as --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- like, my older family and the cousins and everybody because right towards, I don't know, I guess when I was nine or ten, if one of your grandparents passed away, usually it didn't make a difference, but my grandparents got remarried --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, like, in our family that was really, like, kind of just -- I don't know.  Made everything different.
R:  Oh, huh.
L:  So -- and again my mom grew up with many brothers, sisters, cousins.  My grandparents grew up with, you know, one of six, one of seven, you know what I mean --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and now I'm like one of three, I'll probably have one kid -- you know what I mean?  Like --
R:  People are having less.
L:  -- so that large family thing's also -- people can't afford to have twelve kids anymore.
R:  Well yeah, that's true.
L:  So that, that's definitely curtailed to it, plus, like my aunt, she's in her nineties, she said, look Jay, she goes, you know, when we lived in Italy, we came to America, there was a lot of problems in the world then, there was, you know, depression, the plague, [LAUGH] you know, like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you still had all kinds of things.  Almost every single family that we knew, almost all of our aunts and uncles, they had all lost a child.  Problems at birth, plague, pneumonia, smallpox, whatever.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  People -- you know, the fatality rate when they were young.  People -- you know, hey look, we gotta have three kids.
R:  Well, that's true.
L:  We may only wind up with one.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Gotta have three.  Gotta have three.  And that's, that's, you know, I guess the beauty of modern technology.  But.
R:  So, do you have one now, or you're planning on it?
L:  No, I just -- I plan on one kid.
R:  Oh.
L:  Maybe two.  But because, ah, I just know my age, I'm a realist, ah, I want to be able to play if I have a boy, you know, softball, throw him to teach a curve, whatever --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- hockey.  And I feel that, you know, third or fourth child down the road I'd be too old to enjoy it.
R:  That makes sense.
L:  And I feel that I'm cheating my child if I do that.
R:  That makes sense.
L:  Just like when I was younger I wasn't financially secure enough to put myself in a position to have a kid, I wouldn't put a child through that.
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Well, I had -- right now I've got four kids.
L:  That's terrific.  Congratulations.
R:  So --
L:  God bless you, man.
R:  -- I like them.  So, you know, but I started that thirteen years ago, so --
L:  Right.  So you're older like me?
R:  Yeah.  I'm, I'm in my mid thirties as well.
L:  Right.
R:  So.
L:  When did -- how old's your oldest?
R:  Ah, he's twelve.
L:  All right.  So you had a kid when you were like in your early twenties.
R:  Yeah, I was what, probably twenty four, something like that.
L:  Were you financially ready when that happened to you, or just --
R:  No, but --
L:  -- you would rather have the kid than worry about the money, right?
R:  Yeah, that and I also had family around, my, you know, my --
L:  Support system.
R:  Yeah.  And they, they helped us out, and --
L:  That's terrific.
R:  -- you know --
L:  You need that, because to do it alone, like I know people, I have friends, they're divorced at like twenty five with a kid --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- somebody's left paying the bills.  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, that's, that's not good.  And, ah, part of the thing about family and marriage is having a commitment --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- you know, and there's, there's a lot of people that, you know, they say, well it's not working out --
L:  We got an escape clause here.
R:  Yeah.  You know, let's --
L:  They leave themselves the escape clause.
R:  -- let's do the divorce thing, and that's, that's just -- sometimes it shouldn't be an option unless there's some sort of an emergency or something, and --
L:  I agree.  Like that's -- it was a big issue when my grandfather -- after my grandmother passed away, just remarrying was like an issue --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- in our family.  Ah, yeah, that was -- that was pretty much the big issue, and you know, it caused like a -- like the big Sunday gatherings at my grandmother's house, well she was gone and my grandfather wasn't having them with his new wife. 
R:  Oh.
L:  Nor were people -- like there's so many other people we wanted to see on a Sunday, then not our grandmother, you know what I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was definitely, ah -- I, I mean, and, and that wasn't a divorce case scenario, it was just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- after the facts.  I definitely agree.  A lot of my friends -- everybody got married when I was twenty four, twenty five.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Everybody I hung out with.  And, and it sucked for me 'cause you stopped talking to those people, they go about and have their, you know --
R:  Their own lives and all.
L:  -- they don't have time to hang out and just, you know, whatever, go watch the game every single night or whatever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So you lose contact with those people, but then you run into them again five years later like, oh, what's up?  Oh, not in this, I remember you had your daughter, whatever, you had another kid on the way, how's everything going?  Got any more kids?  No, I got divorced last summer. 
R:  Oh.
L:  Oh, that's nice.  What about your kids?  Well, I get them every third day.  
R:  Oh boy.
L:  Would you really want that?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like I want my kids -- I want to know they're in the next room. [LAUGH] You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, want them every day.
L:  We get divorced, you're buying the house next to me.
R:  Yep.
L:  That's the only option I'm leaving. 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Like, I don't want to joke around with kids, that's why I haven't had them yet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I wanted to be --
R:  That makes sense.
L:  -- family, exactly.
R:  Did you -- have you gotten married?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  No, I came close, um, the girl I'm with right now, we were together like four years --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and, ah, I'd love to marry her, she's just not ready.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well that happens too, you both have to be ready.
L:  Yeah, she just started her career and everything, so.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  But.  Hey, it works out, more the better, right?
R:  Well, yeah.  Yeah, so.
L:  Because she comes from like, you know, real religious strong family, married, like, you know, like I'd want to be how her parents are, married, happy, did the right thing by their kids, made sure they went to college, yada yada.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's -- I mean, I don't -- why sell yourself short?  Settle for less?  Let me try this, maybe it's the right one, but if it's not I got an escape clause.
R:  Yeah.  I, I don't go for that so much.  So.
L:  Where you from?  What part of the country?
R:  I'm from Utah.  What about you?
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, so -- you can have five wives, you just can't divorce the first one.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm only kidding.  Only kidding --
R:  Not in, not in modern history.
L:  -- just had to throw a stereotype back at you. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Where are you from?
L:  Ah, I'm from the East Coast, Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Philadelphia.  I used to live in Maryland.
L:  Okay, I went to university in Maryland.
R:  Oh, did you?
L:  Yes, I did, College Park.
R:  The turps, was it?
L:  What?
R:  The turps, right?
L:  Damn right. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I even had, ah, some stickers and stuff.  That was when our family was a bit younger.  Not like -- when I was younger, you know.
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  My dad worked for the government, and we --
L:  Well, you hadda be near DC then. [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.  We were there for a little while, and moved a little bit.  But that was, that was fun.  I guess that's another thing in family, being a kid of a family, that's part of the whole thing too.
L:  Yeah, you gotta go where your parents go, don't you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's -- I saw like -- we lived in Florida, we lived in Pennsylvania, we lived in New Jersey, which is basically right over the bridge, but, ah, you know, yeah, you live
