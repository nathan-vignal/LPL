L:  Hi -- 
R:  Hello.
L:  -- this is Jackie. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi, this is Christine.
L:  Hi, Christine. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi.
L:  This is an interesting subject. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  What's you --
R:  I think I can do about forty seconds out of that. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, is that right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.  Um, it really hasn't affected me personally financially, I think, ah, morally it probably affects us all.  What do you think? [LAUGH]
R:  Probably to a small degree, but not directly, you know.  I guess what affects one person kind of affects other people and it spreads, but not directly at all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I -- I don't know that I heard that topic exactly clearly.  Um, they were talking about corporate scandals like Enron, right?
L:  Yeah, yeah. 
R:  So that's gist -- oh, okay, all right.  Then I did get it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I don't, I don't think that that's affected me directly at all.
L:  And then I think the other part of it was what the government should or, or could do to, um, I guess regulate it, or, or control it, or if they should or shouldn't do anything about that.
R:  First off, I think stop taking these campaign contributions.  So they wouldn't have an incentive to not do anything about it.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I, I probably -- I probably agree with that to the effect that I think that a lot of politicians are quote unquote owned by their interest groups --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- um, and I don't think that, I don't think that I'd have an argument with that, that statement at all.  Um, as far as, as that, um, regulating what they will or will -- won't do, I think that that probably has more to do with the general public taking an interest and either allowing them -- not allowing them, as has been the case many times in -- where I'm from in New England, ah, the case of where the worse they are it seems the more they'll let them, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I think if, um, if they didn't have the, the money thing hanging over their heads, then the, the idea of doing what's right could have some sort of prominence in, in their plans.  But you know, they have this money hanging over their head and their career, and if they want to keep going, then they kind of have to go along with the status quo in a way.  I think the public -- even though they take an interest in certain things, politicians BS the public all the time and people just kinda sit back and go for it.  So I don't know how much just the public knowing alone is going to do -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- like, when this whole Enron thing went on, the president's like, we need tougher laws, and da da da da, but in reality if they just enforced the laws that exist already, it wouldn't of happened.
L:  Yeah.  I, I think that's probably true in, in the mainstream of -- well, they're always great at making new laws.
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
L:  But then everything is, ah -- seems to be enforced haphazardly.
R:  Yep.
L:  I.e., it's the little guy that, that bears the repercussion of --
R:  You know --
L:  -- of the laws that are passed, as opposed to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, yep.
R:  The bigger you are the more able to find a loophole you are, I think.
L:  Well, yeah --
R:  Or the better friends you have. [LAUGH]
L:  -- you got the money to spend.  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Buddies --
L:  You got the money to spend to, to find the loopholes, and you got the money to, oh, what's that, ah, when politicians influence people? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Well that's all I have to say on the topic. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, can we go off the topic or do you have to stay on this one particular topic?
L:  I think we're supposed to stay on the topic, I don't know how we can -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah for eight minutes we're supposed to talk about that topic.
L:  Pardon me?
R:  I said, for eight minutes you're supposed to talk about that that topic.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I started reading Michael Moore's book Stupid White Men.  Have you heard of it?
L:  I -- I've heard of it, yeah.  How is it?
R:  It, it's pretty good.  He talks about some of this stuff, and other things as well.  But, but some of the way that, ah, things happen in politics and politicians say, that didn't happen, and people just kind of say, oh, okay.  But they're simple things that go on -- go on right in front of your face that if you really looked to see, you'd see them.  So.  He goes into some of that stuff.
L:  Oh, I, I think that that carries on all the way from, from local law -- law enforcement all the way up, you know.
R:  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
L:  It, it, it, it's who you know, not what the law is.  Um, I know that I've had -- my daughter had a, had a guy that, ah, that she was dating that, that I always told her that he was a little psycho in the head.  Well, um, he came over my house, he was -- I don't know if he was high, he was drunk, he was something, and they were sitting out on the stoop, and it was like midnight, and she had a new baby, and I -- and the baby was in the house.  And he start -- he woke up and started crying.  I went out and get her, told her she needed to come in the house and tend to the baby.  She comes in the house, gets the baby, goes out on the porch. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I said, oh no, no, no, no, no honey, you're not understanding --
R:  Stay in and tend to the baby.
L:  -- and you know, it's midnight, I don't care if it's the middle of summer, bring that baby in the house.  Well, he went off on me, just in a tirade, and um, I ended up -- he wouldn't leave, and then, um, I don't know, my son I guess got involved, and he -- and the guy finally left, and the next day he came back even in more of a rage.  I guess he just simmered on it all night or did whatever he did all night --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and came back early in the morning in more of a rage.  And I called the law.  You wouldn't believe what a fight I had trying to get them --
R:  To come out.
L:  -- to, to, to put a restraining order on him --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- because he holed up when he found out that I called -- was calling the law. 
R:  Mm.
L:  But then the third cop that showed up for it, because, I mean -- then it ended up three weeks later he ended up slitting some guy's throat so now he's sitting in prison.
R:  Gosh.
L:  So --
R:  Could have been you.
L:  You know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You're lucky.  Some people know how to pick them.
L:  Sometimes they just don't take things as seriously as they should, and I think that it -- like I say, it goes all the way from, from little local stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all the way up to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- big stuff that ends up affecting everybody.  You know.
R:  Even little local stuff goes beyond just not taking things seriously.  They -- the whole institution of, of the police system is -- I mean, it's, it's not designed to be corrupted but it's hard to not be.  I mean, just in its nature there's gonna be corruption and there's gonna be loopholes that they get to get through that, you know, they're supposed to be enforcing the law and they're breaking it.  So, I don't know.
L:  I mean, yeah.  How many times have you had a cop go whizzing by you only to see him pulled over at McDonald's or something --
R:  You know, you know.
L:  -- up the road.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know.  Um, and, and -- so, I don't know.  Is it just human nature that --
R:  Drinking and driving.
L:  -- the more power you have the more you have to take advantage of it? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yep.  That's it, that's it.
L:  So how -- so how do you then regulate and how do you -- how do you, um, set up, ah, checks and balances?  I mean, that's supposed to be what the senate and house and all does, set up sets -- checks and balances for each other and for the presidency, but how do you actually effect that?
R:  You have to strip all the possibilities for corruption that you see.  And, you know, in, in politics, basically, like I said, the funding thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, having pub- public meetings, all the meetings should be public and broadcast like they do on C-Span for most of them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, policies, maybe if they made the policies understandable for everybody.  Because a lot of people don't do politics because they don't know what they're talking about.  You know, if they can understand it --
L:  Because it gets so involved that, that your average joe --
R:  It's another language, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Never mind that, but doesn't have the time to spend four days to, to, to listen to arguments --
R:  Try and understand --
L:  -- about, um, why the, the, the pine beetle, ah, the pros and cons of the pine beetle --
R:  [LAUGH] Mhm.
L:  -- and why fourteen million dollars should go into funding more research to find out its breeding habits, you know.
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  So --
R:  I like the news programs that, um, where they kind of break it down.  They say, this is the issue, this is what's going on, and then they'll play a clip of the debate --
L:  Like Frontline or --
R:  Um, I don't know what -- I was listening to something this morning.  I don't know what it was even.  But um, they were talking about, um, partial birth abortion and something else related to that.  I can't remember what the other thing was.  But the guy basically explained his side and what the issue was, and you know, just made it really simple to understand.  And then he played the clip of, of the meeting, or the debate or whatever it was.  So you can kinda understand it a little easier that way.
L:  Mm.
R:  That would be helpful, to make it really accessible to everybody, so they know when people are BSing. [LAUGH]
L:  Which brings me to another thing.  Does the government have -- have too much say so in too much?
R:  Hm.  In some things I think so, but I'd rather -- I -- even though I'm, I'm anti, you know, Big Brother and stuff like that, I think I'd lean more toward them having too much than having too little.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I think it's gone too far at this point, you know, with the whole nine eleven thing and just a lot of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a lot of freedoms being taken without there being a really good reason.  But generally I'd say it's for the government to be involved, because if they're not you'll have lesser hoodlums [LAUGH] taking over things, you know.  If they don't regulate this, that and the other thing, somebody's going to be in there that's going to be corrupt and probably more corrupt, so it's like a lesser of two evils.  Like in industry, meat packing, that kind of stuff.  I don't know.
L:  It is not a perfect world. [LAUGH]
R:  Not at all.  Far from it.
L:  Hm.
R:  Far from it.  So.
L:  So you say -- you say that, that you'd rather see them have, have more power than less power --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where
