R:  Hello, my name is Janet Bolan[?] What's your name?
L:  My name is Barbara Maddocks.  How are you, Janet?
R:  Okay.  How are you?
L:  [LAUGH] Fine.  This is my first call, so -- 
R:  Mine also.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] We're both new to this.
L:  All right, okay.  So we're going to talk about corporate scandals.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All right.  Um, I'm not sure that I'm stung by corporate scandals.  I think that, ah, the nature of capitalism by definition leads to corporate scandals.  I mean, I think the -- I -- I think the, um, the core value of capitalism is to make money at almost any cost.  And, ah, so these -- these people are doing that and -- in a country where you can't have decent housing or decent food or health care or anything unless you have money, um, people then get into a -- a mind set where -- where they will do anything to have money.  Um, and so -- I -- I -- I'm not really surprised, and I think we go through cycles of this.  I mean, I think this has happened before and then there's an outcry and then everybody claims to clean up their act and then five years later or ten years later we go through another outcry and people claim to clean up their act and then, you know, so on and so forth.  What do you think?
R:  Well, I'm kind of in agreement with you.  Um, I used to work as a government contract auditor so I saw a lot of this. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I guess it was an eye opening experience for me because I had really been raised to believe that most people were good and honest and would do the right thing and found out that that's not always the case.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And it's really disappointing.  It's hard to teach your children to be honest and do the right thing when they see the -- the people who don't do that are the ones who have all the outside symbols of success in our society.
L:  Right, right.  Um, you see this -- have you seen this latest thing in the newspaper about the, ah, the guy from American Airlines, um, and how they created a pension fund that would fund a hundred per cent of their pension, these are the top executives.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, meanwhile, you know, all of these airlines are two steps from bankruptcy, um, and in addition that, he was getting some other perks and some other money and so on and, ah, it was really a scandal and, ah, now the -- the most recent thing I saw is that, ah, the -- the unions involved with American Airlines had agreed to concessions bec- -- you know, to try to make it through this difficult time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And once they found out about this executive and the -- and the perks that were being given to them, they've taken back their agreements now.  So it's really -- it's really, um, I -- I agree with you, ah, particularly that it's hard to -- I don't have children myself.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I can imagine it's hard to teach children that honesty and fairness and kindness and all those kind of things are good -- good values to have when the people that they see who are most successful and living the good life don't have those values, you know.
R:  Yeah.  I'm encouraged by the steps that they do take when they catch 'em.  I just don't think that most of it gets caught.
L:  Mm, mm, well -- 
R:  I think there needs to be really strict penalties and instead of slaps on the wrist.
L:  Mm, mm. 
R:  Because a million dollars when you're making ten million a year is really not very much.
L:  Right, exactly.  It doesn't really hurt you very much, and also I saw I think it was today's paper that, um, they're talking about, you know, this, ah, tax credit that poor -- working poor people could get, um.  When they file, they could get some additional moneys back.  Well, they're going to crack down on that and they're going to require all kinds of documentation that you're entitled to it but yet, these people -- these CEOs get away with, you know, economic murder and -- and, ah, particularly under this administration nobody seems to be concerned about that.  I mean, it almost seems like once you get past a certain income level, you can do whatever you want and nobody will question it but as long as you're a part of the working poor or the -- the poor middle class, um, you know, then you've got to justify every single penny that you get back from the government, and it seems to me there's something wrong with that, um, -- with that equation.
R:  Yeah.  I know they're, um, are supposedly reducing their labor costs by shipping everything down to Mexico and yet the prices up here stay the same, so where's the windfall going?  It's not going to our people for -- to put money in their pockets for food on their tables.
L:  I know.  Years ago I used to work for a company where we did some kind of, um, ah, computer carting.  I can't remember exactly what the job was, now, but -- but, it was then that I found out that these companies -- that it's more to their benefit to ship certain work to third world countries where they pay, you know, cents a day --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to the workers and have it sent -- have it, um, flown back than it is to pay American workers to do the job.  Even though it, you know, involves time and so on, it's to their benefit to do that.  So I mean, I think, um, in a sense that's part of these corporate scandals as well.
R:  Yes.  I do think you're right on that and, ah, you know, ethics and business, it's covered in other classes.  I have a degree in accounting and we really should have had a whole class just on ethics.
L:  Yes.
R:  We didn't, but I think that every business major should have to do that.
L:  What school did you go to?  Did --
R:  I want to Ball State in Muncie, Indiana.
L:  Uh-huh, Uh-huh.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I'm from New York.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Not from there, still there. [LAUGH]
R:  Um.
L:  Do you feel that a degree in economics, um, was in a way, um, superficial in the sense that it didn't deal with these other -- these deeper issues of ethics and -- and how corporations behave?
R:  Well, um, my degree wasn't accounting.  
L:  Okay. 
R:  I had a couple of classes in economics but what I feel is that we were given, you know, these are the rules and these are the standards and so on but there was never this class that perhaps would have said, "These are the kinds of things that people might ask you to do" and you know, decide whether it's ethical or not, maybe even have group projects on that and, you know, brainstorm ideas of how to do things to be profitable and still be a, you know, ethical while you're doing it.
L:  A -- a -- which leads me to one of the questions that's been in my mind, what about these accounting firms like PricewaterhouseCoopers and all these others?  I mean -- what, you know, I'm almost dismayed and -- and reluctant to say it but they seem to be part of the problem, you know.  They seem to be whoever pays the bills they'll say whatever they want them to say, um, rather than you -- you are supposed to be getting an objective audit for instance.
R:  Yeah, and they used to be very exclusionary towards women and minorities in their hiring practices and everything else.  And, um, personally that did not surprise me that, you know, in other areas they were less than honest and fair.
L:  Oh, I see because of the way they handled the hiring you -- you felt there was, um, that -- this wouldn't be with -- beyond something they would do, is that what you're saying?
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Um, so, [SIGH] you know, from a personal point of view, it was kind of justice to me to see 'em get caught. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But --
R:  But, um, you know in the big picture, you're right.  We rely as a public, if you're buying a stock, you would like to know that the income statements that you base your decision to buy it on are right, that you can believe what's written there, and any more, you can't.  It's just not worth -- it's not worth the ink it's printed with I'm afraid.
L:  What -- do you have any idea how this can be solved?  I mean, any suggestions as to what can be done to keep these corporations honest?
R:  Well, of course, um, sending the culprits in it to prison -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I like the whistle blower laws.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That, um, and enforcing them, making it so that it is really not worth their hassle to, um, go after a whistle blower and keep them silent.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Really having effective protections in place for those people and maybe honoring them as the heros that they are for doing the right thing even though it might be the most difficult thing.
L:  Mhm, and I'm -- I'm thinking about even in terms of sending these guys to prison.  I mean, number one, like you said, they get slaps on the wrist in terms of fines which don't mean anything.  I mean, I -- I'm not sure what they do as far as taxation but I -- I can imagine them writing any fines off as -- as against their taxes, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
