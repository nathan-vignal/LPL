R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi!
L:  Hi, how are you? 
R:  I'm fine.  My name is Sylvia, what's yours?
L:  Ah, Shamik.
R:  Sharik?
L:  Shamik, Shamik.
R:  Sh- Shamik?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.  Does that have a meaning?
L:  Ah, no, it's just, I don't know, it's an Indian name, I don't know [inaudible] how my parents -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- how my parents got it.
R:  Oh, a family name?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay, well, that's good, we're talking about family.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Um, what exactly -- what does family mean to us?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, you know, go ahead and say what -- say what you think.
R:  Oh, you want me to go first? 
L:  Oh, no, I mean, I can go first if you want.
R:  Go ahead.
L:  Ah, okay, I -- basically, I want to say probably family is the most important thing, personally, I think, I grew up, I was really close with my brother and I was really close with my parents.  So I think anything, if anything, if it came to anything, any problems, I think family, it's easy to talk to -- um, I can talk to anyone in my family and I think that they're pretty close and they're always there for me, and they'll support my decisions no matter what they are, so overall, I'd say, very important, and I don't know what I'd, what I'd do without them, or where I would be. [MN]
R:  That's great.  That's great.  Um, I feel the same way basically, but most of my family is gone now, except for my children.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, my mom's gone, ah, dad's gone, my bro- -- my only brother and sister are gone, it's just me left without immediate family, but I --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- agree with what you said, it's -- you know, especially when they're gone, you realise just how important they are.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, I'm still, I'm only eighteen, so I've never really lost anyone that close to me.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  So, I [inaudible] --
R:  I'm a little older. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I'm sure I could -- you could see that after they're gone, you probably realised even more how much -- what they meant, and all that.
R:  Yeah, you do, 'cause you don't have, um, you know, you make goo- -- you make friends, and all, and you have people that you work with, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they don't have that connection with you, you know.
L:  There's never the same -- exactly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN]
R:  And you know --
L:  I -- 
R:  -- huh?
L:  No, go ahead.
R:  And I understand they may be, they may be concerned, but family will, you know, they'll go all the way to the end with you if you have a situation that needs to be dealt with, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Yeah, of course. That's obvious.  Are you close with your children, or --
R:  Yeah.  Pretty close to them, um, they're, ah, you know, young adults, and --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and, um, they, I, I give them their space to lead their own lives but I talk to them just about every day.
L:  Uh-huh, sounds good, yeah, I still talk to my parents almost every single day.
R:  Mhm, we all live in the same town --
L:  Oh, good.
R:  -- they live on their own.
L:  [MN]
R:  But I talk to them regularly.
L:  Oh, that's good.  Do you see them a lot, or -- 
R:  Yeah, I would say, you know, they're pretty busy, I have a son who's in college, and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, a daughter who's working and, ah, so you know, their schedules are pretty, pretty --
L:  [MN] -- pretty -- 
R:  -- hectic, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they're trying to get their financial base established, and that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- takes a lot of work --
L:  Of course.
R:  -- but they, um, you know, on, during their free time, we, we talk on the phone a lot, we email a lot, or, or we, ah, we'll get together and just hang out.  You know, my daughter and I probably hang out more --
L:  Yeah. [MN]
R:  -- mhm, my son's try to date a lot. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Just trying to enjoy himself.
R:  Huh?
L:  I said, he's just trying to enjoy himself.
R:  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I'm sure he does -- yeah, I don't really get to see my parents, I, I go to school in Texas, I had to go all the way from Georgia so I don't really see my parents at all [inaudible] --
R:  I'm sorry, I missed that.
L:  I'm, I'm from -- I go to school in Texas --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, ah, my parents, we're from, from Atlanta, Georgia.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, I don't really see my parents that much, but -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I try to go home as often as I can.
R:  I'm just three and a half hours away from Atlanta.
L:  Oh, where are you from?
R:  I'm in Tennessee.
L:  Oh, where in Tennessee?  I grew up in Tennessee.
R:  I'm outside of Nashville.
L:  Oh, really?   
R:  You grew up in Tennessee?
L:  I grew up in Chattanooga.
R:  Did you really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, my daughter went to a school up at -- in the eastern part of, ah, Tennessee at eastern Tennessee state university.
L:  Oh, really, yeah, I know, I know a few people that go there.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, it seems like really good fun to actually go there.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  What, what would you say is probably one of the most important things a family member has done for you that made you realise you were --
L:  Ah -- 
R:  -- that, that, that meant a lot to you, that that was so important?
L:  I don't know, I think like, my, like, I wanted to come to school, out of state, and it's, it's pretty expensive, it's like twenty five thousand dollars a year, --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- And I think, like, I knew we could, we could afford it but it'd be, it'd be tough --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and so, my par- -- my dad, like, made me, he said that, I mean, my mom wanted me to take, ah -- they wanted to take financial aid --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, I was -- I really wanted to, just to help them out, but then, they thought -- they talked it over and they didn't want to put that burden on me after I graduated college and for me to repay a loan --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and all that, so, like, they bared down and dipped in to their savings and all that, and they're paying for my college fully and, without even getting a loan, so they're --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- helping me out, really, and obviously I appreciate them so much, because that would put me under a burden for ten, ten years or whatever --
R:  That's great.
L:  -- and I think they're helping me out a lot.  Heaven knows --
R:  Have you picked your major yet?
L:  Yeah, I'm doing business and finance, I'm doing finance and accounting.
R:  Oh, great.  That's solid.
L:  Yeah, so -- I really liked it so far. 
R:  Mhm.  I remember things about my mom, she used to, she used to, ah, sew a lot, you know, and --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- when I was younger --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- she would try to teach me, I would resist it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I wanted, I didn't want to learn how to sew.
L:  Yes.
R:  But she made me learn basic stuff, but sometimes now, when I'm trying to sew something, I sit and I think, boy, I should have paid attention.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible]
R:  And I wish she was here --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- to show me how to do this stitch, you know, so--
L:  Isn't that good?
R:  Yeah, she taught me a lot of different things, so -- she was a good cook, too.
L:  It helps. 
R:  -- and people tell me I'm a good cook.  Huh?
L:  Huh?
R:  I said she was a good cook and people tell that I'm a good cook, so --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, obviously, you learned a lot of things.
R:  Yeah, I did learn a lot, I just didn't learn that sewing like I should have. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Did you always have to do everything? 
R:  Yeah.  So, but, ah, I miss my family.  I'm, you know, I, I find myself, um, wanting to adopt people.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Bring them into my sphere, my -- into my world, you know. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I'm sure.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That'd be hard, to lose everyone.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN]
R:   -- but, um, you know, the good memories sustain me, so that's good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, ah, that always helps. 
R:  Huh?
L:  Did, ah, I was saying, do you have any, like, good memories of the kids, or --
R:  With my kids?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, I have --
L:  From childhood?
R:  From their childhood, or?
L:  Yeah.  You lived in Nashville for a long time?
R:  No, I moved out here in eighty nine.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm. But my kids grew up in Colorado.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Ah, we lived in Denver --
L:  Oh.
R:  And -- ah, yeah, I have, I have really good memories of them growing up, because, well, my daughter was [COUGH] really smart in school and it was just really fun watching her tackle a lot of different projects and stuff, she was real high energy -- 
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- and she'd, she'd try anything, you know, from music to science to maths to dance, I mean, she just -- everything interested her.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, so that was, ah, that was really exciting to watch her do that, and my son, he was, ah, he was an average student but he had such a great attitude, you know, he was real funny --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and, ah, he'd make you laugh a lot.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and I remember those days, you know, it was nice.
L:  That's good.
R:  They were good kids.  They -- I used to think, ah, you know, when I was younger I was kind of, like, in the, in the hippy group, with the hair --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and the clothes and stuff, you know, and --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I said, "Oh, I'm going to be a real cool parent when I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have kids", you know.
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible]
R:  -- but they were so conservative.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Ah, yeah, they were real conservative.  They didn't do anything wild with their hair, nothing wild with their clothes. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  They were kind of boring in that regard. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I did all that, I had earrings and long hair and all that.
R:  Mhm?
L:  So, I, hopefully, when I grow up, my kids enjoy themselves.
R:  Yeah.  It's funny, I think, it probably skips a generation, your grandkids -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- your grandkids will probably put the earrings on, you know.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I can spoil them later on, then.
R:  Yeah. Oh, yeah, you, you will.
L:  That'll be fine.  Any grandkids yet, or --
R:  Huh?
L:  No -- any grandkids yet?
R:  Yeah, I do.  I have five grandchildren.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, do you know, did you know you were talking to a grandmother?  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I couldn't even tell.
R:  Yeah, I have five grandkids.
L:  Oh, -- are they old, or are they really young?
R:  They're young -- they range in age from thirty weeks to fifteen years.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Mhm. There's a --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- and they're very, they're very special to me, there's something special about grandkids.  I mean, you love your children --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but the grand kids touch you in ways that you never imagined.
L:  Yeah, once you get a little bit older --
R:  Huh?
L:  It's -- I said, I can see when I get a little bit older I'll enjoy myself a little more with grandkids 'cause you get more time, and I don't know.
R:  Yeah, you do. You just enjoy them, I mean, they're cute --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're little --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and all that stuff, you know, when you're raising your kids you're, you're so busy and you're rushing and you're trying --
L:  Right.
R:  To get this and that done, but you know, you're just a lot more relaxed with your grandkids.
L:  You get to enjoy them and not to worry about all the bad stuff?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, you just get to enjoy them and their little, ah, personalities and all the little strange things they do, they don't irr- -- none of it irritates you any more.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You, you don't worry about --
L:  Exactly.
R:  Are they going to turn out bad if they do such and such?  No, they'd, they'll be all right.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
