R:  Hi, this is Annette.
L:  Hi Annette, this is Vicky.  How are you?
R:  I'm good.  How are you? 
L:  I'm fine.  Is this your first call or --
R:  Ah, yeah. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I just signed up. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  Well, this is my second call.  I got my first call yesterday.  So -- 
R:  Oh. 
L:  We can just start talking.  I think the topic was, what does family mean to you?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay, [LAUGH] all right.  Um, well, family means not only people that are related to me but also very good friends and, um, some time even coworkers can be considered family.  Ah, when I worked in the, um, telecommunications field, the people that I worked with were part of my extended family --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So it's not only just blood lines, sometimes it's just people that you, um, get to know later in life. 
R:  The people. 
L:  Mhm.  What about you?
R:  The people that you really care about. 
L:  Right. 
R:  Right, but it's kind of outlay with my family too because I have lots of, um, aunts and uncles who aren't really blood related. 
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  But that title fits them best. 
L:  Right. 
R:  I mean, it's -- it's, they're more than just good family friends. 
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  So. 
L:  Yeah, where family it -- it really is, ah, -- it's, ah, like you said it -- it can be just not -- not only people that are blood related but just people that you come to know and love that you miss when you're aware from them, you know, just -- just things like that.  Ah, do you come from a large family?
R:  Um, large in that I have lots of cousins. 
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  I guess average immediate family.  I have, um, two brothers and a younger half sister. 
L:  Oh. 
R:  I'm the oldest. 
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  So. 
L:  Yeah, that's what -- I -- have -- I only have, ah, two brothers and I have one older sister but I never knew her.  She died when she was a baby so I never knew her.  Ah, but I ha- -- I too have lots of cousins that my mom raised as, you know, her own really. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So -- so I really feel like I come from a big family. 
R:  Yeah, I was raised by my grandmother after my parents divorced and --
L:  Oh. 
R:  My cousins were there too. 
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  So one of my aunts is still living at home and --
L:  Okay. 
R:  -- her daughter was there. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And then with my mom. 
L:  Yeah.  And, ah, where is -- 
R:  And my other cousins. 
L:  Where -- where is -- where are you from?
R:  LA. 
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  Los Angeles. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  So they must be matching me up with west coast people.  Yesterday the lady I spoke with was also in California.  She was up -- up above north, um, north of San Francisco she said. 
R:  Oh. 
L:  And I'm in Georgia. 
R:  Yeah, I live in Oregon now but I've only been here four years this past March. 
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  And I still miss California. 
L:  Of course. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] My husband and I sometimes get into it 'cause he's a born and raised Oregonian. 
L:  Oh, Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  So. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But we both agree if we could live in San Diego that's where we would go. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, [LAUGH] okay.  [LAUGH] Yeah, I don't know -- like, I don't where they get the topics from.  Um, yesterday it was about computers and education. 
R:  Oh. 
L:  [LAUGH] And it was my first call and the lady I was talking to, it was her first call so we were, like, "Well, what do we do?"  I said, "Well we just talk". [LAUGH]
R:  Talk. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's it.  [LAUGH] Um, but with the topic being family, um, let's see what else can we talk about about family?  Um, family reunions. [LAUGH]
R:  Are a pain to put together. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes, yes. [LAUGH] I -- I was supposed to attend one last year and I didn't get a chance to, um, but yeah, that's -- that's part of being families, and you have, of course, the good part of your family and the bad part of your family. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm usually the go between between the parts so -- [inaudible] 
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] I know.  You try to keep the peace. [LAUGH] Oh, but I guess that's -- that's what families are all about.  Um, I have a small family, um, of my own.  Only I have a daughter and a son and one granddaughter so my, ah, immediate family is -- is small.  I -- I'm divorced and, ah, and happy. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I'm a -- I think I'm still a newly wed, and it will be two years in July. 
L:  Oh, great. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, [LAUGH] we're still happy.  Like, when my parents call and ask how we're doing, I'm, like, "Well, we're still talking to each other". 
L:  Yeah, that's good.  [LAUGH] Oh. 
R:  Nobody sleeps on the couch on a regular basis so --
L:  Okay, so that's great.  That's great.  I had a long happy marriage.  It lasted twenty six years so ... 
R:  Wow. 
L:  But I guess we just grew apart. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes. 
L:  But, um, now we're -- we're the best of friends so I guess -- so we are still considered family too. [LAUGH]
R:  That's good.  My -- my mother and father refuse to speak to each other. 
L:  Really, oh. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's, like, okay. 
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  So, and one of my brothers doesn't want to speak to my dad but he'll talk to my mom. 
L:  Okay. 
R:  So whenever my dad wants updates on him, I have to call my mom. 
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  She'll give me the updates and then I have to go tell my dad. 
L:  Oh my goodness.  [LAUGH]
R:  So. 
L:  Yeah.  Well, I guess ... 
R:  I have -- we have a daughter who just turned one this past week. 
L:  Oh, okay, oh, a little one. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Is she getting into everything?
R:  Oh, yeah. 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  So she's walking and climbing and --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  Let's see, this past week she started, ah, going downstairs. 
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  So, and she figured out upstairs as soon as she learned how to crawl. 
L:  Okay, they always do, they always do. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So it's like, "You're not walking yet, you're not supposed to go up the stairs". 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I -- I know they always do, as soon as they start crawling they notice the stairs, oh, I can go up there and then they try and they get halfway up and they're like, "Okay, do I go up or down?"
R:  I'm stuck. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  They get stuck.  Are you going to have a larger family?  Are you going to have more kids?
R:  Um, I want more kids.  My husband was raised as an only child. 
L:  Oh, okay?
R:  And didn't grow up around, um, -- he was the youngest. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He was the baby out of everybody so even his cousins were, like, ten to fifteen years older than him. 
L:  Okay. 
R:  So he didn't have any exposure to kids. 
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  Um, even when we met I was a single mom. 
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  So --
L:  Okay, oh, okay. 
R:  That was different for him to be dating a single mom. 
L:  Right, right. [LAUGH] Okay. 
R:  Um, so, but, ah, I want one more 'cause I just think, you know, raising two single -- I think of them as they're going to be single.  My son is going to be nine this week. 
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  And so in a couple of years he's going to be out of the house and I'm going to have this, eight, nine, she'll be ten, ten year old. 
L:  Right, right. 
R:  And it's, like, if we have another one when she's about two -- 
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- then she'll have somebody to play with because otherwise it will be like my son now, "I need somebody to play with". 
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's true, that's true. [LAUGH]
R:  And I just think three -- three to four is a good number. 
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  And he's, like, "No, two is enough". 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We have one of each, that's enough. 
L:  Oh, no. 
R:  Don't need any more. 
L:  Oh. 
R:  So he's kind of fighting a losing battle because all of our friends and his sister think we should have more. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And I want more. 
L:  Right. 
R:  He's just, like, "No, no". 
L:  [LAUGH] He'll lose that battle. [LAUGH]
R:  As I say, you know, we -- we'll give him time to adjust 'cause --
L:  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, by the time she's two, he'll probably be ready for another one then. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah.  That's when I had my two.  They were, ah, twenty months apart, so ... 
R:  Right. 
L:  [LAUGH] So it was like having two babies at one time.  Oh, but it was -- it was good for them because they had each other, you know, to play with. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  You know.  So our granddaughter's an only child.  It looks look she's going to be an only child. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And my son, that's my -- by my daughter.  My -- my son doesn't have any kids so I say, "Well, I guess I'm only going to have one grandchild". [LAUGH] So, but, um, but, anyway, I know they're going to come in and tell us when the ten minutes are up and then we'll have thirty seconds to say good bye to each other. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] But I -- this is real interesting.  I -- I said I, you know, I didn't know it would happen that quick because I signed up yesterday morning. 
R:  Right. 
L:  And got -- and got my first call yesterday afternoon. 
R:  I signed up I think on Monday or Tuesday. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  But they keep calling my cell phone instead of my land line. 
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  So ... 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  I missed my first two calls. 
L:  Oh, goodness, okay. 
R:  But ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But this is the third time they've called me but my first call that I've been able to catch. 
L:  Oh, okay, okay.  Yeah, but it's -- it's real interesting.  I -- I can't wait to see what the topic's going to be tomorrow. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  But, um, let's see, what else can we talk about on the family thing?  Family trees.  Have you ever traced your family tree?
R:  Um, my grandmother and my aunt are doing it and they think I might be the one to do it for this generation because I started doing it for my daughter before she was born. 
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  But I stopped. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay. 
R:  I got full out of time. 
L:  Yes, yes. [LAUGH]
R:  That's going to suggest, ah, people who --
