R:  Hi, I'm Lenora.
L:  Hello, I'm [several inaudible words] how are you, Lenora? 
R:  Good, I'm fine.
L:  Lenora, I didn't hear the topic of the day, what is it? 
R:  What does the word family mean to you? 
L:  Ooh, boy.
R:  That's a -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- wide [LAUGH] topic.
L:  [LAUGH] That's a pretty darn wide broad one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What does the word family mean to you? 
R:  Family means [SIGH] unity, it means, um, -- family means good times and -- and, um, bad times.  I come from a large family and --  
L:  Oh, aren't you lucky -- 
R:  -- we spend a lot of time together.
L:  Do you?  That's nice.
R:  How about you? 
L:  I came from a small family I -- I was an only child of an only child on one side and my mom had one sister --  
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and it wasn't always an easy family, ah, we had a lot of love between us but also I would say, yeah, a fair amount of pain and -- and so I have mixed feelings about the family I was born into, although I love them very much although they are all gone now, I only have one surviving first cousin --  
R:  Wow.
L:  -- other than that they're gone, but family for me is something different in that I have the inevitable position now, ah, on the other hand of being able to choose my family.
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, ah, I have a number of very, very close friends whom I consider family, a number of them I've known for, I hate to tell you how many years [LAUGH] -- 
R:  That's a good thing though.
L:  My -- my sister Rosemary is somebody whom I first got to know in nineteen sixty six -- 
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and -- and I have a few other sisters and brothers who, you know, -- who go back that far and some even farther and -- and some of them were more recent, and --  
R:  So, they mean a lot to you? 
L:  Oh, they sure do.
R:  That's great --  
L:  And I got married last year and so I have a family in the person of a wonderful husband --  
R:  Wow, congratulations. 
L:  Oh, yeah, although his family isn't quite reconciled to me yet.  He's from another country and I think -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they kinda where were -- were hoping to have a family who where were -- who were more -- a little bit more like them than I am. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] Right --  
R:  I have one son and he's an only child but I also have siblings who have only children, so it balances.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] It balances it out and they all happen to be boys. 
L:  Oh.  Now, were they close as kids growing up? 
R:  They -- they are.  My son is only ten years old --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he spends a lot of times with his cousins because, um, they're only children --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- you know -- 
L:  And are they alike in -- in terms of personality and interests? 
R:  Yes, yes.  Well, my mother babysit- -- -sitted them all before they were able to go to school, so they spend a lot of time together at the grandmother's house, um, --  
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- because their close in ages, so --  
L:  You know, it's so strange about -- about real [inaudible] what real families, and my brother and sisters I found that sometimes they have a lot in common --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and other times they really don't.
R:  They don't, no, see [LAUGH] I have one brother and, ah, he's much older than me, so by the time I was growing up he was already out of the [NOISE] house and to college and --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I really didn't know him as a -- as a child so, he's totally like a stranger almost to me --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as opposed --  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- to my sisters that were in the house growing up with me.
L:  How many sisters do you have? 
R:  Three.
L:  Oh, that's a lot.  Now, that must have been fun? 
R:  Yes, I have a set of sisters that are twins and their eighteen months older than me and then I have another sister that's five years older than me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, we have -- we have a close network and all my sisters have one child and they're all boys and everyone said now, four year radius.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  So, we're really close.
L:  And do you all life in the same geographical area? 
R:  Very close, um, you know, [MN] one state over from each other.
L:  Oh -- oh, well that must be nice.  Do you get together very often, do you see --  
R:  Holidays, birthdays, you know, when there's a need we are really close, but sometimes [LAUGH] like you say you can't pick to choose your biological family, but we do have extended families also. 
L:  Well, that's lovely and that's so lucky.  I -- I guess one of the hardest things for me what that, ah, I -- I lost during their lives a number of my family in that they stopped speaking to me, they disagreed with me about a number of important issues and it's -- it's broke my heart, it really did and I tried to re establish contact and they just made it pretty plain that it wasn't in -- in the cards --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, it -- it saddens me, but at the same time I -- I do have the joy of being able, as I said, pick and choose my -- my family. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and so, I have some of the best family any human being could ever -- ever hope to have and that's -- that's one of the great joys of my life.
R:  Do you spend a lot of time with your extended family? 
L:  Um, not necessarily I -- I -- I spent part of my -- my year abroad, so I don't always get to see them when I'm travelling and sometimes we don't see each other for years, but I know they're out there.
R:  If you need 'em? 
L:  Yeah, [MN] --  
R:  That -- that's a comfort.
L:  I have a friend, for example, who lives -- a friend whose a brother, whom I think of as a brother, who lives on an Indian reservation far out in North Dakota and I live in New York City.
R:  [LAUGH] Wow. [LAUGH]  
L:  And I haven't seen Al White Lightning in person in -- in, oh, gosh, phew, in fifteen years and we really got to be close during the Vietnam war when he and I used to write to each other all the time and he'd pass through New York on his way home during home leave --  
R:  Isn't that special? 
L:  -- and yet I -- I wrote to him not long ago and I said, "Allen, you know, to me you're -- you're like a star in the sky, I -- I can look up no matter what part [several inaudible words] and see you twinkling there and I know you're there and a part of me can always each out and touch you". 
R:  Yes, and, you know, email makes it [SIGH] -- it brings us closer to family because --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you don't have to always see them but you can always be in contact.
L:  I know they're there.
R:  Right.
L:  Even if I don't -- you know, even if we don't, you know, talk about what we're having for dinner on Thursday or whatever, you know, I -- I know they're there and that's -- that's a great comfort and -- and a great joy.  I know spiritually they're -- they're there --  
R:  And [NOISE] --  
L:  -- for me and I'm there for them.
R:  That's it, that's really good.  Family, you know, you need somebody in your corner when you need em.
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  And family is who you call on in a time of need.
L:  And I also have my pussy cat, Pretty, and I have my parrot Bia[?] who's sitting here eating his dinner right now --  
R:  That's family also.   
L:  -- so, I'm looking at Bia's -- 
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  -- tail because his face is buried in his dish.   
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] He's eating his peas and his rice and I hate to tell you cause he's a bird, but he loves his chicken.
R:  Wow.
L:  [LAUGH] He's a very happy --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- bird eating his cousin right now. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] So, that's family also.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Even though they can't converse with you. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, he's my grandson.
R:  Oh, all right. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] That's great.  So, you do have family? 
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You have family where you find it.
R:  Where you find it and you make it what you make of it.
L:  Yeah, now, that's what I think -- 
R:  And that's --  
L:  -- what I think.
R:  -- that's great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'm just fortunate enough that my, um, family is so close cause so many people have family so far and in between, but -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- we have all stayed in the area and we do a lot of -- 
L:  Where are you --
R:  -- things together.
L:  -- from, what part of the country are you? 
R:  I'm in Philadelphia actually.
L:  Philadelphia, I'm ninety miles away, that's not far.
R:  Yes, and my family's, most of them are in Jersey.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  So, it's very close, you know, it's over a bridge, left and half an hour ride. 
L:  Yeah, you know, that -- that's nice.
R:  And my mother's actually around the corner.
L:  Mhm.
R:  She's very close.
L:  Do you see a lot of her? 
R:  Oh, every day, I have to physically look at my mother every day, she's a senior --  
L:  Mhm, mhm. 
R:  -- and she has health issues and I'm not comfortable going to bed unless I've physically look at her to make sure that she's all right.  My sister lives with her --  
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- so, somebody's there but it's a comfort to me to actually see her every day and -- 
L:  Re- [NOISE] --
R:  -- I talk to her maybe seven times a day.
L:  My folks died in nineteen ninety, but I -- I -- I confess that I was less than great about physically seeing them every day, even though I did live a block a way --  
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- my father used to get a call from his mom every morning until she died and she was, ah, an old lady when she died and he was not a young man either, um, and -- and my granddad on my mom's side who also lived to a ripe old age was would come to lunch every Saturday afternoon --  
R:  Wow. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- so, I grew up with my grandparents -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- too and I like -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- them very much and I remember the songs they used to sing and my grandfather's terrible jokes.   
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, a sophisticated five year old, I used get so fed up with hearing the same stupid jokes about why the chicken crossed the damn street --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and the fireman wore the red suspenders.
R:  You could almost tell those jokes yourself, right? 
L:  Well, when you were five years old you were way too sophisticated for those jokes, they were for three year olds.
R:  [LAUGH] But you had to laugh anyway? 
L:  "Oh, grandpa --" 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "-- how could you do that to me?" 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] that's how I remember -- that's how I remember my granddad looking exactly like an egg --  
R:  No [LAUGH] --  
L:  He had a bald head and he was round --  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and he looked exactly --
