L:  Hi this is Betsy. 
R:  Hi this is Amy. 
L:  How you doing? 
R:  Good, how are you? 
L:  Good.  Is this your first call? 
R:  Yes. 
L:  Ah, this is my second one.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, what we're supposed to do is -- I gather is -- all we're supposed -- really what we're supposed to do is just like really talk [NOISE] about what family means, and, um, -- like to me it's not just what's blood relative related -- it's, um, everybody that, you know -- friends, as much as any -- and my animals for that matter.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How about you? 
R:  Oh, I agree with you.  I have like -- I have a very close family, but I also -- when I say that I definitely include, um, specific friends that I have that I've had for a very long time, who I know like, love me unconditionally, and --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- um.
L:  That's the whole point of family in my mind. 
R:  And my animals for as well [LAUGH]
L:  Yep, [LAUGH] oh, I can't forget my animals. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They count, and my daughter, you know, she comes after me.
R:  Right
L:  She counts.  [LAUGH]
R:  How old's your daughter? 
L:  She's twenty-one. 
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  Oh, yeah, she's off in college right now. 
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH] Do you have a big family? 
L:  No, I've got a very small family and, uh, -- actually, uh, -- and actually we don't -- none of us really speak to each other -- so that's what I mean by having the extended, [NOISE] sorry, extended family with all of my friends. 
R:  Right. 
L:  Um, I even host on line.  I host backgammon tournaments and --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- to me -- to me they're family. I mean I  even when I greet new players, it's welcome to the family.  Um, to me they're as much family as any body.  I've met -- we took year off, and went all over the United States meeting them and --
R:  Oh, my god. 
L:  -- oh, yeah.  Um, they -- I hurt my back recently, and if I don't go on line it will then -- oh, a day I get more phone calls from people all over the world --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- checking to make sure I'm okay.  Now my family won't do that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but they will, so to me that's as much as family as a real family is.  Cause our family, nobody really got along well with my dad, and when my mum, was alive she kind of held everybody together, and then she passed away and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that kind of dropped every thing apart. 
R:  Right, right. 
L:  You know, and other than my daughter that's about the only one that I really speak to in my immediate family.  Um, so really what I consider my family are my friends -- where my heart is where my family is. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  You know, and, um, I mean I've got my daughter and, um, other than that -- how about?
R:  Is she far away? 
L:  Yeah, she is out in Arizona. 
R:  Oh, wow. 
L:  So if it wasn't for my computer --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I wouldn't of been able to afford to talk to her, cause I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- talk to her constantly -- but if your hear beeping, that's her.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Cause she just got home from school, so she's beeping me like crazy talking to me. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So how about you -- have you got kids? 
R:  No-- no not yet I'm -- I'm twenty five, and I'm in grad school --
L:  Oh, that's great. 
R:  Yeah, so I'm holding off on that part of my life --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for now.
L:  Are you still living at home with your family? 
R:  No, I live -- I don't live with my family, but I am pretty close to them -- my parents are divorced so I have a very big family. 
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  Because I have four parents and lots of stepsiblings and we don't all get along, but you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at different times, different ones of us get along with each other.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's the same way here, you know, um, and my daughter right now is -- is great cause she holds everybody together, and she talks to everybody, so everybody like gets all little bits of information from -- from her.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I don't know -- I mean -- still in my mind it's, you know, where ever -- whoever is with me and gives me unconditional love, that's who I consider family. 
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Whether they're beside me, related to me, or in Australia, or where ever they are in the world. 
R:  Wow.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's kind of neat -- I mean I do have friends all over the world and, um, I know I --
R:  Have you visited the ones outside of the States? 
L:  Some of them yeah. 
R:  Okay. 
L:  Um, and I'm gonna do some more.  I have been invite today go to Australia, New Zealand next, and Denmark.  I got invited to -- I'm moving with a couple friend of my daughter, and mine also, and go to work with my friends wife's company.
R:  Wow. 
L:  And she wants to marry off my daughter to her son.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So we can really be family. 
R:  How does your daughter feel about that? 
L:  She's not so sure about that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But I mean a -- a lot of these people I've grown up -- I mean -- I've known their kids since they were born.
R:  Wow. 
L:  And I talk to their kids and help them with their homework and to me that's family.  Um, I have one friend whose daughter's going through a really rough time, and she can't talk to her mum, but she can talk to me.  She says, "I wanna talk to Aunt Betsy". 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And that's the real they she really feels about me, which is really neat.  I mean I get birthday cards from them, and I send them birthday cards, and you know so to me that's family -- it's whoever is around me, and loving me and of course my animal -- I mean my -- my cat is [NOISE] and I lost custody of my dog to my ex-fiancee, but I still get visitation rights. 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah I don't have my -- I've two dogs that are with my parents, and I have one cat that my best friend has right now, so -- but I get visitation rights too. 
L:  Yeah, yeah. 
R:  [LAUGH] And I still talk about them like they're mine so --
L:  Of course.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean they always will be. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, I mean I treat them like they're my babies, you know.  It's -- it's [LAUGH] people I mean -- people think I'm nuts -- okay my animals are my family but they are.  I mean I live through them. 
R:  Yeah.  I think a lot of people that have pets don't feel that way. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know, so this your first time, hu? This is -- they asked me the same question earlier so this is why I am kind of like -- [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really. 
L:  Yeah.  [inaudible]
R:  That's so weird. 
L:  I know, and I asked them to call between, um, four and eight and they're calling me at eight twenty -- but that's okay. 
R:  That's very odd.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm surprised they would call the same day.  Twice on the same day. 
L:  I am too -- I wasn't expecting it -- especially when I'm losing my voice from the first one.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They called right at four o'clock when they called the first time.
R:  Right. 
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Hu.
L:  I'm kind of surprised they are calling late. 
R:  That is surprising. 
L:  Yeah, cause I had my room mate answer the phone and she's like, "Uh, Betsy, it's for you".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So how often do you get to see your daughter? 
L:  Um, not too often cause she is so far away I got to see her last November.
R:  Okay. 
L:  L- -- last summer, she came and spent the summer out with me, and then, um, this summer she just got herself a new apartment, so -- I'm hopefully going to try is make it out there in the near future. 
R:  Have you ever been to Arizona? 
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  Okay.
L:  We had lived there. 
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  And then she decide that she wanted to go back to school out there, cause uh, -- very good friends of hers, uh, -- her best friend in -- in high school her parents adopted both my daughter, I kind of --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- knowing that my mum, had just passed away and I wasn't getting along with my dad -- they decided that was it -- that we were members of the family. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And [NOISE] moved my daughter in with them, moved me in with them.  I moved on, and they still treat her like she's one of their daughters.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  On vacations i- -- it's easier for her to go down there than is to come out here -- so she goes down to visit them, and you know I get -- I get calls from them all the time letting me know how everything's going.  And [inaudible] yeah a large extended family shall we say.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I have my ex-boyfriends from two times so I've been to -- I've been in Arizona.  [inaudible]
L:  Oh, that's where, that's where we lived. 
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Oh, it's so beautiful. 
L:  [inaudible] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's awfully hot in the summer but I --
R:  Oh, my god, I know.  I was there -- I was there in July I think it was like -- 
L:  Oh, you were the best time there.
R:  Yeah it was ridiculous.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Definitely it was interesting out there, um, you know ah -- my brother was out there so I went to go visit him.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um, then he moved and my brothers best friend who is more of a brother to me than my own brother is -- so he's my so re- -- I mean to me he's my real brother.  He came and moved out to Arizona as I was moving to Florida.  We actually saw each other on the interstate --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and waved to each other and we try today pull over but we missed each other -- and when we got to the other ends we called and we were so -- he was moving to Arizona to be closer to me --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I had moved to Florida cause that's where they -- he and his girlfriend were living and I was --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- moving there to be closer to them.
R:  Oh, my god. 
L:  And we missed [LAUGH] and he's still in Arizona but I moved -- I stayed back east.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. Do you -- which do you like better do you think? 
L:  Um, Florida. 
R:  Okay. 
L:  I'm in Pennsylvania right now, but I like Florida best.  I move a lot.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So [inaudible] families around here. 
R:  Right. 
L:  And you know -- and I don't know, I mean it has always has been ever since I was a kid where ever I've always had so many extended family. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Even when I was a kid, I adopted people that my parents didn't even know.  And they're like, "who's that?" oh, that's uncle so and so -- that's aunt so and so. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  You know, and -- and my daughter's the same way -- I mean it's unbelievable how many people she calls aunt and uncle, and they really consider her part of the family.  So it's kind of neat, I mean --
R:  Yeah that is.
L:  -- coming from a family that never really got along all that well.
R:  Right -- right. 
L:  But, uh, anyway.  So, um, [LAUGH] I don't think we have got to keep talking. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Your turn
