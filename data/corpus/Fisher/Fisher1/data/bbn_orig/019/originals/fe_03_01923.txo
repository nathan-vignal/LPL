L:  I know
R:  -- and, um, unfortunately, you know now I'm -- now I'm more on th- the lower end of the stick, but um, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know I mean family's not all about money. 
L:  Right, right. 
R:  You know kids -- and I have three kids, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- yeah, it's -- 
L:  How old are they? 
R:  I have, um, a thirteen year old, an eight year old, and a six year old boy.  So, um, [LAUGH] basically how about you, are you --you have kids, or --
L:  Oh, no. 
R:  Are you in college? 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  College student.  Yeah
L:  Young 'un.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Still in college, yeah.  I go to College Park actually. 
R:  Oh, that's good. 
L:  Yeah, so I'm tying to get my major going and  -- [LAUGH]
R:  Now are you -- are you far from your family? 
L:  Uh, actually I'm pretty close.  I'm in states. 
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  I applied to places out of state, but you know like financially --
R:  Right.  
L:  Financially, so.
R:  Right I hear you. 
L:  Yeah see how it works out, I don't know like -- right now it depends if I get my major or not.  So I might not actually be moving away. 
R:  Oh. 
L:  My family is fairly close, it's only like a half hour away from me. 
R:  Oh, that's good and you're -- and you keep in touch with them pretty regularly, and they're close to you? 
L:  Kind of --I mean I have a -- I have one older brother and, you know, mother and father, um, -- pretty small family. 
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  We- we're a decent little class, um, -- 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Like I keep, uh, kind of in touch with them when I'm in school -- not really you know.
R:  Right.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Well yeah, I guess when you're in the commune --  I- I've in there so the college life you kinda [LAUGH]
L:  Right. 
R:  It's a little hard to stay close to family, but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know I'll tell you when you -- when one get -- when you get -- like I'm thirty five and when you get to my age like family -- it's like all of a sudden there is -- there is a closeness that you didn't -- that you didn't have like r- -- even though families are close --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- when -- when you're younger, you know you have your little fights -- this and that but, um, like my family all calls my mother and father on Sundays -- like that's our thing.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And so, you know, you usually should hear from someone on Sunday, then she makes the call. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, um, but I have  -- like my sister live in New York, and my two brothers and my parents live in New Jersey, so, um, -- but yes we're still real close, like they come down and visit, or I go up there, and -- and um, you know hey it's only like a short plain ride away, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right. 
R:  So our -- so everybody's close.
L:  That's nice.
R:  But, um, yeah I mean I think it's definitely important, and uh --
L:  Well, uh, where are you all from originally, out of  -- 
R:  Um, New Jersey. 
L:  Oh, out of New Jersey
R:  Yeah, well born in New York, but raised in New Jersey,
L:  Yeah, okay. 
R:  And then [inaudible] my husband was, um, graduate student so that's what took us to Florida, and, um, it seemed like the area in Florida we came to is like really good for -- for families, you know like they have a lot of parks, and a lot of, um, like now my boys are into baseball, so it's really -- really family orientated.  Where when I moved out on my own, and had my family I lived in Pennsylvania, and it was kinda laid back, and --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- and not much to do, and, um, yeah so it really, it actually brought us cl- -- you know everybody closer together than -- than anything.
L:  That's nice.
R:  -- which is cool. 
L:  Which part of Florida are you actually in right now? 
R:  About it's about fifteen minutes -- about north west of Fort Lauderdale.
L:  Okay. [SIGH]
R:  So, probably where all of you guys want to go for --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- spring break.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Get away from my families.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well I haven't been down -- yeah see Florida to you guys would be the opposite. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly. 
R:  Like getting away from families and stuff, but, no it's cool though.  But, um, --
L:  So, uh, would you say like, you know, like are you saying -- you were saying as a child, or whatever -- as an adolescent, like you were really close to your family or whatever, uh 
R:  Um, yeah pretty much you know my father was a doctor, so it was -- it was really hard because you know when your father's not around that much you don't really -- you can't get too close.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, now he's retired, and I'm older an- and it seems like the closeness gets brought in --
L:  I see. 
R:  -- more.  And, um, yeah so it's pretty much -- yeah we were close, I mean sisters and brothers fight all of the time, but we're a lot closer now that we're you know we have families of our own. 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. 
R:  Kinda -- kinda gives you that meaning of, gee now I know what my mother was talking about. 
L:  Right. 
R:  Kind of thing. So --  
L:  Yeah my dad all the time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when you get older you'll understand what I mean.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  [inaudible] And I hate it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I hate it cause I'm like, Oh, my god my dad was right. 
L:  Right.
R:  Or like I'll say something to the kids -- I'll be like, "I sounded like my mum". 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  But --
L:  No good.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You know that's cool.  That's -- that's family.  [LAUGH] You sound like, uh, you end up sounding like somebody.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well as long as it's good things, you know.
R:  Yeah
L:  Then it's okay. 
R:  No yeah, if you come from a good, you know -- good background --
L:  Right.
L:  -- that's the -- that's the key. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And if you don't, I mean my husband didn't, and he's you -- he came from a totally opposite family than I did, and um, still you know it's -- he's like totally different than the way he was raised, cause he saw the wrong things --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- and he chose not to do it that way, and  and, uh, like I said I was raised in family was very important, you know.  They always knew where you were, and even now  know I have my own family; my mum, still knows where I am all the time. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know. 
L:  [LAUGH] Right. 
R:  So, it's, uh, you know it's interesting.
L:  Yeah. Um, my -- actually my parents kind of a interesting [inaudible] I guess like my father was from a you know Chicago, and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- my mum, was actually from Korea.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, cool. 
L:  So, yeah it's kinda like an interracial thing, and it's so funny sometimes just to see them like -- I -- you know sometimes like I semi-language [inaudible] there.
R:  Oh, really. 
L:  And like, you know, just like a little bit -- my mum, understands english, but like --
R:  Right. 
L:  You know my dad --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- doesn't always understand Korean.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So she can say things about him.
L:  [LAUGH] When she gets angry you know.
R:  But that's cool.
L:  Korean words start to fly.  [LAUGH]
R:  That is not a cute --did she raise you to speak both, or -- or you don't understand it either? 
L:  I speak --I speak, uh, a little bit.  Actually --
R:  Oh, really. 
L:  -- yeah, I can understand what I can speak.
R:  Oh, see that's cool -- so you have like a -- like a cultural ch- -- two different cultures.
L:  Right yeah. 
R:  That's cool. 
L:  Like I talk Korean to my mother --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  -- and English to my father.  It's kind of funny yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My friends see me on the phone, they're like what are you doing?  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that is so cool though.
L:  Yeah.  It's kind been like -- I always -- it always like boggled my mind, you know, like how they got together, and it's like -- I don't know.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's s- some interracial -- you know it happens a lot though.  Like if he's in the navy -- one of those -- 
R:  Oh, yeah -- yeah.
L:  -- overseas.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  You know e- [inaudible] meets the love of their life.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, the weirdest thing -- yeah. 
L:  The weirdest, yeah -- and like I just -- I just don't comprehended it at this point I guess, you know.
R:  You will some day. 
L:  [LAUGH] Maybe.
R:  Some day you will --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- understand --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Hey, but it doesn't matter they fell in love, and they had you and your brother.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  So --
L:  That's a good thing.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah that's right [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Sometimes you know whenever they say she's so strict. 
R:  Is she? 
L:  Yeah, it's like --I guess it's just like a tendency like, you know.  Like if you, uh, a few other Asian kids -- especially ones who have like, you know, a mixed parents like -- like the Asian parent is always usually so strict and every thing like that, just cause like --
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  -- of the social structure back, you know, over in Asia -- like --
R:  Right. 
L:  [inaudible]
R:  That must be weird for your father. 
L:  Oh, not actually he's pretty old fashioned too -- 
R:  Oh, really.  
L:  --so it kind of works out.  
R:  Oh, that's cool. 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's cool. 
L:  Kind of a double whammy there.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  But I always get mad at him, because, you know, he was a little bit of a hell raiser when he was a kid. 
R:  Right. 
L:  He's like, "I don't want you doing". [inaudible]
R:  But he won't let you make his mistakes --
L:  Exactly. 
R:  Yeah, but you know what when you're a dad you're going to be the same  way. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  You know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You will. 
L:  [inaudible]
R:  What year are you in, in school? 
L:  Actually, I'm off sophomore right now. 
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  Yeah
R:  That's cool.
L:  Trying to get the business. 
R:  Oh, yeah. 
L:  Just like everybody else.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well, you know, that's where to go. 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Where to go.
L:  But I don't know.  If it happens my GPA is kinda [inaudible] right now. 
R:  Oh, you'll get there. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  You know.
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH]
R:  You'll get there.
L:  As long as I have support from my family.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Right. 
L:  Actually they're -- they're giving me a lot of support right now -- actually cause they're paying for like my tuition, and like --
R:  Oh, good. 
L:  My [inaudible] you know. I have a lot --
R:  Yeah that's big.
L:  -- have a lot of friends who their families won't even pay for you know tuition, even if, you know, they're decently off any ways --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  It's kind of weird
R:  I've seen that -- I've seen that too, and like my uncle, um, ma- you know, like there was a dif- -- I mean even though he's my fathers brother the family life was different, and like these kids had to go to work while they were in school, and it's like my dad was like,  "no, college is your job".  You know, and it's like -- so even in the same -- even in the same --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- family you kind of expect the same kind of people.
L:  Right.
R:  And like their -- they were just totally different -- I was like, you know, thank god I was like able to -- you know, be raised like that where, you know, my job was to -- you know. 
L:  Be a student.
R:  To do the right thing, right.
