R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My name is Karen.
L:  Mine is Marty.
R:  I live in Florida.
L:  I live in Connecticut.
R:  Oh, I just, ah, read a story about Connecticut. [LAUGH]
L:  A family story?
R:  No, wasn't a family story, let's talk about family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  My family lives up in New England, mostly in Massachusetts and, ah, Maine, New Hampshire -- -- 
L:  I have most of my family here, ah, children, [MN] ah, brothers, sisters, I have one who just, ah, oh, yeah, about maybe a year ago moved to, ah, where did he move to?  Lipton[?], [NOISE] oh, Foreman Beach.
R:  Yeah?  
L:  And he loves it down there, but, ah [MN] -- -- 
R:  Oh, great.
L: -- --  yeah, he was just up here 'cause I guess he's taken, ah, his father in law he's decided, [MN] his mother in law passed away so his father in law's, ah, [NOISE] going down there to live with him so he was home for a week to close the house up, and to trailer him down there, but, other than that, what do you have for family?
R:  Well, I've got three sisters, and, um, I'm not all that close to them, 'cause they're up there and I'm in -- -- 
L:  Yeah, they're all up in Mass.?
R: -- --  Florida. Right, well, one's in New Hampshire, and one's in Maine and one's in Massachusetts.  Well, my dad's in Maine, and my other one's actually in Chicago.  My father's in Maine, my, my mother died a while ago.  But, um, yeah, we just stay in touch with e- mail, or the phone once in a while, it's not, we're not really that close but, ah, we, you know, if we need anything we'll give each other a call.
L:  Yeah.  It's surprising, isn't it, it's, you have the distance but I have, ah, a brother and a sister who are definitely within walking distance from me, just a, maybe little bit over considering walking, but -- -- 
R:  So do you meet together a lot?
L:  No.  [LAUGH] you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] you have 'em, [MN] you know, [MN] you're mu- -- states away, and there you are streets away, and it's -- -- 
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] but I mean, [MN] the summer's here so you'll see each other more, you're out and about, or getting together at somebody's house, or just stopping by, the weather is more conducive to it than the winter, we had one of our worst winters, so, it -- --   probably, unless it was a family gathering, or arranged thing, you don't, yeah, you're so close, you still don't see 'em that much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But anyway [MN], it's like you said, you still get the phone calls, someth- -- there's a problem, or something happens in somebody's family, and one, [MN] one brother just announced [MN], his son has got engaged, so, ah, you know -- -- 
R:  Yeah.  My one sister -- -- 
L:  Yeah.  My wife's looking at --  my wife's looking at me like she didn't hear that, so -- -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm [MN] she's getting that Ryan got engaged, the New York one. [MN]
R:  Well, my one sister [MN] -'s husband has family here in Florida down at, ah, Jensen Beach and, ah, they come down almost every year to visit at Christmas or something like that, 'cause his father is real close to his brother who lives down here, and -- --  so they come down, and every time she comes down, I have to go -- --  we, we usually meet in Orlando for a day, anyway.  Sometime I'll stay overnight or whatever, but, ah, you know, we try to get together whenever she comes down here.  I don't, I do not get to go up there very often, I really do not want to, I left the place, I don't want to go back! [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] I, I don't, I don't blame you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I'm surprised  you've, [MN] some of your family doesn't take advantage of you being down there and, ah, -- -- 
R:  You're right, you know, I built, I built a Flor- -- not a Florida room, but I built a guest room in my house when we first ca-  came down here, and it has never been used.
L:  Yeah.  Which is wacky, in some ways, I -- -- 
R:  Right.
L: -- --  [MN] yeah, and then how many times do you offer the, the invitation and you just get tired and say, you know, I'm not gonna beg you?
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  You know, I've asked you, I've asked you and that's that.
R:  Right, they want to come, they come.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, um, we've, we've, we've done that, you know, it's funny [MN], 'cause you say that with the family of, again, a couple of states away, and there's, I have the same situation with, ah, brothers and sisters [MN] close, I mean, I have a nice deck, a good- sized deck, a good- sized pool and everything, and [MN] you know, "You're more than welcome to stop over, feel free, you know, I'm not going to call you and beg you and invite you every weekend", and, you know, they might stop one week in the month, or something, but, you [MN], you know, you tell your friends and, you, I got my, or you, er, or anyone, in conversation, yeah, my brother lives about three streets over, and "Oh, so you must see 'em all the time ?" "No!" [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] you know, so, yeah, do I consider ourselves close?  Yeah.  I think sometimes, you know the wives might not get along, that has a problem, you know, the sister in laws, you know, one doesn't like the other, it's you know, when I get together with my brothers and sisters, when we're all alone, it's, you know, we, ah, laugh, and whatever, it's when you start throwing in the, the, I guess, the, I don't know what to call the, the spouses, or the two parts and then -- --  
R:  Right.
L: -- --  the conflicts and the re-  memories of who said what ten years ago, and [MN] and, you know, that kind of stuff.
R:  I know, it gets a little -- -- 
L:  Yeah.  It does.
R:  My, um, my husband has a brother that lives down in our area, ah, he's about two hours away, and we see him at least once, maybe two or three times a month so I mean we, we get together with him once in a while, but, ah, yeah -- -- 
L:  Children?
R:  Ah, no.
L:  None?
R:  I don't, no -- --  
L:  [MN]
R: -- --  I don't. [LAUGH] I've got nieces and nephews, but I don't have any kids and, and, ah, -- -- 
L:  Oh, ah, -- -- 
R:  My husband's my family, and I teach, so, all the kids I teach [LAUGH] are my f- -- I figure, that's enough family for me.
L:  Yeah, I have, ah, my wife left the room, but my, ah, sister in law's a teacher down there, I'm not sure what school system she's with, or I would tell you, but my wife left the room, so I can't tell you.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] ah, but I got, ah, [inaudible] before, this is  my first call on this thing.   
R:  Me too.
L: -- --  and, ah, I wish I hadn't told the wife about it, I saw it come up, it said the University of Pennsylvania, and it didn't click on me until "What is this ?" and then it, you know, they tell you that the automatic thing, but we were just, before the call came, we have five children, and, ah, you know, [MN] one who's graduated, one who's graduating this year, one who's twenty and trying to find himself -- -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Ah, [LAUGH] -- -- 
R:  Well, I teach high school kids, so I know -- -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, he's, he's twenty, trying to find himself, and came home, came back home hoping to get help then find himself, -- -- 
R:  Yeah.
L: -- --  and, ah, and a sixteen year old daughter, our last one, ah, which, if I could have another guaranteed girl, I have four boys and a daughter, I'd have another one, but since there's no guarantees -- --   she's  been easier than any of the boys put together.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Maybe that'll change, people tell me, in the next couple of years, but, so far, she's been a blessing.  But, ah, well, tell me something.  If it's, [MN], you know, [MN] we were just talking before this phone call came that, you know, it, it seems like they take turns and, we never know which one is going to get the phone call, that I need tires, or I'm thinking, you know, I'm a little short this month, on this, or -- -- 
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it's constant.  But, but, that's what family's all about, I guess, I don't know.
R:  Yeah, help each other out.
L:  Yeah. So [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah, I guess that's the main -- --   The main thing is, ah, I ac- -- I actually called in tonight, because, um, I got a phone, a couple of phone calls, and I, I tend to screen my calls, 'cause we get a lot of, you know, ah, soliciting and stuff like that, and then I -- -- 
L:  Right, right.
R: -- --  told my husband, I said, "ah, maybe it's that phone call thing's calling me, so, I need to, you know, call in and see if I can get on one of them, because, you know, I can't guarantee that I will e-  even pick up the phone -- --" 
L:  Right.
R: -- --   so, um, I figure, it's, well,  if it's important they'll leave a message, I can call right back:
L:  Right.
R:  So, um, so I go well, let me call in, and see, and, ah, I-  I had actually called in earlier today, and I couldn't get through, 'cause I think where  I work, there's a call waiting system, and they said that call waiting would knock you off or whatever -- -- 
L:  Uh- huh.
R: -- --  and I couldn't get through, so -- --  I already knew what the topic was and like "Ah, I guess I can talk a little bit [LAUGH] about the family."  'Cause I got Bob's family and my family, and, you know, just, I don't know.
L:  Yeah, yeah, well, I got lucky, ah, [MN] knock, knock, knock on wood, but when I met my wife, ah, her mother passed away when she was younger, and, ah, she'd ne-  never really had a, the father got re- married and nev- -- there was conflicts there, and so she never really had a continuing relationship with her father after that.  So I practically met a girl who didn't, [MN] I met a girl who didn't have a mother and, did not have a relationship really with her father, so I have no real in- laws.  So I don't have to deal with that end of it, of the holidays and Christmas and all that stuff of, ah, you know, wh-  who's parents are we going to for Thanksgiving, and -- -- 
R:  Well, that's true, but how does she get along with your parents?
L:  Ah, mine, [MN] she did fine, but, ah, they've both passed on since.
R:  Yes.  Right.
L:  And, ah, so we're both, ah, in- law- less [LAUGH] -- -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L: -- --  and, ah, -- -- 
R:  Well, you will be in- laws soon.
L:  Yes, this is true, yeah, yeah, yeah, well, [MN] there's we're worried about one of them. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  The one we, who we'd hoped he, one will meet a girl, and you know, like you said, and it's, you being a teacher, this generation is a whole different world of these kids of, you know, ah, nobody wants commitments in these teenagers and twenty year olds, and I don't know what you see down there, but, ah, as far as our kids it's, you know, this is everybody's friends and, everybody goes out together, and -- --  but this commitment, [MN] we're only gonna see each other and they don't want to know
