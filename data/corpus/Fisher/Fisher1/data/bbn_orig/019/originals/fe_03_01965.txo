R:  Hello, I'm Salina.
L:  Hi, I'm Phyllis.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I don't know, I work for a corporation.  So, um, a large corporation.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, ah, I guess -- I guess, um, what th- what they were talking about, I mean, you got -- you got all that -- that stuff at the top, you know, nobody, like, come down and talks to the Indians.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they make decisions that are I think eco- economically not, um, good for the company because they don't talk to the people that it directly affects.  You know, they say, um, -- I watched a documentary, like, on Walmart one time and it said that that's why he became so successful because he came down and talked to the little people and found out how they would, you know, better run the company.  So, and, ah, 'cause, you know, all the bureaucracy that goes along with it, you know, hiring people because of who they are not because what they can do.  You know, and, ah, pay, you know, the pay office and all that kind of stuff.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But it really goes on I think.  Some people think it's like, just, but it really does go on, so I don't know.  Where do you work?
L:  Oh, I just work at home.
R:  Okay, well, how about your husband?
L:  Ah, he works for an elevator company.
R:  Okay, okay.  So I don't know if he has got the same situation.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, how big the company is.
L:  Uh-huh, yes.  He is about -- you are reminding me of him when you were talking there.  That's the way he would talk, you know, it's -- if he would have had this question put to him, so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He -- he knows a lot more about it than I would and probably you do too, so that's why I'm, [LAUGH] you know, you're inclined to have more to say about it than I would.  But I think you're right about that.  They should have the -- the smaller people, you know, the ones that are not as high up, you know, in some of the decisions.
R:  Right.  I'm in health care, so.
L:  Oh, you are? 
R:  Yeah, I'm with the big hospital.
L:  Oh.
R:  So but I'm -- I'm a little guy.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You -- you know what I'm saying?  And they make all the dec- decisions and, and -- and things and no one, like, no one asked us what will work.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it -- it ends up sometimes making our job harder instead of easier and things like that.  And then, you know, the people that get put in, like, supervisor positions are like pay offs, you know.  Somebody's uncle or, you -- you know, and they're not like so, I -- I just think that the little people should have more input and I'd rather see these big corporations hire from, like, within.  I think they would have more dedication and if somebody has worked for you for years and they prove to be an honest, um, person, and -- and -- and they seem to have the company, you know, first in mind, I think they would be better off giving them the job than some outside person, you know.  And I guess your husband runs into the same thing.  I think it costs us a lot of money, you know, and government wise, you know, 'cause, like, they were saying -- you know, employee theft is like a big thing, you know.  You know, people that work for 'em and taking things and I think in the long run that's why things are so expensive in, you know, ah, and it makes it hard.
L:  Yeah, I know. Where my husband works I know they would fire you if they catch you taking anything.
R:  Right.
L:  So that I guess that cuts down a lot of the little bits.
R:  Yeah.  And then they don't stop and think about the big guys sitting up there at the desk though.  He's -- he's maneuvering the figures around with the thousands, you know.
L:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  To his benefit.
L:  I guess that's truly we're at, huh?  You know. 
R:  Yeah, he's doing it too because they don't have that corporate integrity, you know, filtering down.  You know, they always say it starts at the top, you know, because if you've got integrity at the top, then your employees will be integrity conscious, but if the people at the top aren't, then it doesn't come down, you know.  If he -- if he is -- um, you know, um, cheating on his expense account and doing all these -- these little underhanded things that they do at the top, it -- it filters down.  And I think it just, like, where if they hired -- I think if they were a little more -- sometimes I think they look for too many credentials and they're not looking at the -- they are better off maybe with somebody that doesn't have as many degrees that ha- -- that is, like, more corporate, that's been there a while, that's had some dedication and has some integrity, you know, that that would be a better person to move up, that the workers already respect, you know.  But they don't do that.  I don't know about your husband.  Do they bring people in from the outside who don't know anything, or don't know anything as far as, you know, what you're doing?  They just graduated from -- got an extra degree at college or something.
L:  I'm not sure if they do that, but they may, I'll have to ask him tonight.
R:  Yes.
L:  I know they move them all around to different locations too.
R:  Uh-huh, and that's the biggest complaint we just had a -- an employee survey at the hospital and one of the biggest complaints there is they bring people in from the outside, put 'em in a supervisor position and they don't even know what they are doing.  So, the little guy ends up training their supervisor.  But, see, the people they bring in from the outside got degrees and all.  They may be the girl that has been working there for ten years that knows what she is doing, doesn't have, like, a four year degree from college, maybe she only has a two year or has a high school but she has got more on the ball, you know what I'm saying? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Than the college graduate they just brought in [LAUGH] as far as the job goes.  So that -- that's one of the biggest complaints I know we have because they are always trying to change things for the better but they seem to make it worse, and the morale goes down.  And it's that big corporation thing that goes on.  This is the second one I've worked for and it doesn't change.  It -- it seems, like, you know, go on from one to the other.  I mean, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of -- not in health care anyway, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  My daughter is just studying, she wants to do that type work with the coding and things like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Different training.
R:  Yeah, well she will find the same thing will happen.  You know, her -- she will end up training her boss.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And -- and it's -- it's just not right.
L:  All right.
R:  So.  Well, I don't know.  Um, how many, ah, is she in college or is she taking a class or -- 
L:  Yeah, she's taking a -- she's in a business school.
R:  Yes.
L:  I -- I guess it's a nine month program.  She wants to do medi care forms and I guess it's coding and things like that, you know.
R:  It's all numbers.
L:  Yeah, first yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  She's on that part right now learning that.  She has had [inaudible] a little hard, but she's doing real well.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I hope she can get a good job.
R:  Yeah, the -- the courters get paid pretty good.  It's, um, it's a big job.  I mean, you know, to me, I -- I -- I -- I would probably get bored sitting there doing those numbers all day, so.  I register emergency room patients.
L:  Oh.
R:  In the computer.
L:  Oh, I'd like that. 
R:  Yeah, it's a little more, ah, hectic.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You get to see a lot of, ah, injuries and things.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is that hard to -- sometimes? 
R:  Yeah, and -- and you see -- you see it there too if a certain doctor's patient comes in everybody, like, kind of hops to it and it's a little different than Joe Schmo, you know, so that -- that whole big corporation thing goes on at all levels.
L:  Oh.
R:  We had a lady last night that was on the board of directors and now you know and I know that the nurses and doctors, everybody catered to her.  And is that right?  They should treat everybody like that.
L:  Yeah, that's good.
R:  But they don't.  Guaranteed they didn't let her sit too long.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  And I think that's the kind of thing they're talking about.  Yeah.  I see, and we, you know, the little guys, we're sitting there saying, "Why are they doing that"? You know.  If I was laying there, they wouldn't treat me that good, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But they should.  Everybody should be treated the same.  Mhm.  But if they're on the bored of directors and they're going to go, ah -- report to your boss how you treated them, [LAUGH] --
