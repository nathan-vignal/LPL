L:  Are we getting paid for this?
R:  Uh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  How much are we getting paid?
R:  It's ten dollars a call.
L:  Uh, when does this payment get here?
R:  Um, well, according to the people that, um,  I got this infor- -- reference from, they pay once a month at the end of the month.  
L:  I see.
R:  But actually, since this is the end of the month, hopefully we get paid quick.
L:  Uh, well, yeah.
R:  Anyways.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hope so.  
R:  Uh, my name's Amy.
L:  Cool.  My name is not Amy.  [LAUGH]
R:  I would imagine it's not.
L:  [MN]  What are we talking about?
R:  We're supposed to talk about education and -- oh, no, sorry, that was yesterday.  We're supposed to talk about the family, family.  
L:  Uh.
R:  Do you have any particular, uh, strong feelings about family?
L:  Uh, sure.  Yeah, I'm all about family. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  How about you?
R:  Oh, well I have a son who's a year and a half old, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I'm pretty, yeah, into family --
L:  Right on.
R:  -- that's my main focus these days.
L:  Cool.
R:  Do a lot of family stuff.
L:  Mhm.  Awesome.
R:  Awesome. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  In fact, I spent my day at mom's group today, so, um, 
L:  Really?  What's that like?
R:  It's -- it's nice.  Um, you know, get the kids together so they can play and it gives you a chance to talk to other adults, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's just kind of nice.  I'm a stay at home mum, so 
L:  Yeah, that's cool.  
R:  I spend a lot of time with just a small, little guy.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  So it's good to have other people to talk to.
L:  Excellent.  Yeah, you get tired of talking to one and a half year olds.
R:  It's very fun, but after a while, yeah, it does get a little bit old.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Seeing as he doesn't actually speak a whole lot.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Enjoys the Teletubbies, but you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you enjoy the Teletubbies?
R:  Well, um, I'd rather have the Teletubbies than Barney.
L:  Yeah, this is a good distinction.
R:  Yeah, you know, or you'd have those [inaudible word] tales that's like Christian.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We don't allow that in my house.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I grew up on Sesame Street.
R:  Yeah, we watch a lot of Sesame Street, too.
L:  Well see, Sesame Street these days though, it kind of sold out. [inaudible]
R:  Well if you watch, like, I think it's Nickelodeon, that has the old Sesame Street.  It's just really funny, you can get these ones from the seventies and eighties, and they have all like, you know, really funny clothes on and stuff. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Cool.  Yeah, I don't know, I, um, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  That's all I have to say about that, I guess.
R:  Well yeah, that's, you know all that much to say about Sesame Street.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Although it's definitely better than some of the alternatives out there.  There's some pretty scary kiddy TV on.
L:  Yeah.  I reckon TV is stupid.
R:  Well, TV in general is pretty retarded.
L:  Especially American TV.  American TV is stupid.
R:  Oh.  What kind of TV do you like, other -- from other countries?
L:  Uh, I get a lot of kicks out of watching the international channel, I guess.  You can always turn there for a good laugh.  Have you ever seen those, like, Korean soap operas?  'Cause they're awesome.  [LAUGH]
R:  For a while, my [inaudible] started recording, uh, Mexican soap operas.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't really don't know why.  I can't say I actually particularly watched them, though.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, they're pretty sweet.  But uh, I guess I only appreciate them because I can't understand them that makes it funny.  [several inaudible words]
R:  Maybe.  That could be it.
L:  [MN]  Ten bucks, huh?
R:  Ten bucks.  That's a buck a minute.  
L:  Okay.
R:  Can't really beat it.
L:  Guess not.
R:  It's a good family job, speaking of families.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  Since we're supposed to talk about families, um, you know, 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you could do it anytime, anywhere.
L:  Not bad. 
R:  Apparently, I -- I can't quite understand what the purpose of this study is.  We're supposed to be for linguistics.
L:  Linguistics?
R:  I don't quite understand that, but, hey. --
L:  How --
R:  -- if they want to pay me to talk 
L:  -- how often do they call you?
R:  Hm?
L:  How often do they call you?  
R:  Um, this is the third time they've called me.  It's supposed to be three calls, although some people that I've spoken with have gotten more than that.
L:  Yeah?  That's cool. [MN]  But, um, 
R:  Yeah, you know.
L:  I talked to somebody yesterday about countries that I was afraid of.
R:  They asked you yesterday what country you were afraid of?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I talked to some lady yesterday about education, and computers in education.
L:  Yeah?
R:  She was like, used to be on a school board --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so she actually knew a lot more about computers in education than I did.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  I was like, "Yo, hey, that's how I did all my term papers, on computers.  I don't know what to tell you".
L:  Yeah.
R:  My child, he's -- he likes computers.  He's only a year and a half old, my son, but he always tries to get on the computer already.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Kind of scary --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- actually.  [LAUGH]
L:  Awesome.
R:  It's amazing how quickly kids figure stuff like that out.
L:  Mhm.  We've just been joined by my roommate Sam.  [MN]  Hello.
R:  Hello.  
L:  The topic is families, and how we feel about them.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, really?  Mhm.  Well, how do you guys feel about them?  I feel fine.
R:  We feel pretty good about families.  [LAUGH]
L:  Really?  Uh, yeah, I think my family is a very, ah, productive force in my life.  I've been through some pretty tough times, but, my family's been very supportive of me, and I don't know what I would do without them.
R:  Well that's good, that's what families are supposed to do?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Right?
L:  Exactly.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And, uh, you know, even though I make mistakes in my life, my parents make sure and tell me that they still love me and they're here for me no matter what. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And that's just great.
R:  Well that is great.
L:  If I could change one thing about my -- no, I'll make this a question.  If you guys could change one thing about your families, what would you change, and why?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Hm.
R:  I know, I have a lot of republican relatives in Texas, I don't know, maybe I'd [LAUGH] get -- get rid of them.
L:  My uncle's a fascist.
R:  Oh, or that, or my in-laws are really kind of, not at all pleasant to be around.
L:  Ah, that's too bad.  So uh, you're frustrated with your republican relatives in Texas?
R:  Well, you know, I just try not to talk to them.
L:  Really?  I wish that you had a better relationship with your, with your relatives.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think that's kinda too bad
R:  It's just --
L:  I kind of like it when my relatives aren't -- aren't of a similar political view, because it makes for some interesting conversation and debate.
R:  Yeah, you know, it depends on the relatives.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  I mean, uh, [inaudible] --
R:  They have to have an opinion to be able to debate --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- rather than just be stupid. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, sometimes, ah, people like to wallow in a pool of their own ignorance, like my uncle.
R:  Exactly.  People like that are a little hard to tolerate.
L:  My uncle's a fascist.  Yeah.  My uncle's just a dirt bag.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't even really consider him my family.
R:  Yeah?  I've got some family like that.
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So Sam, if you could change one thing about your family, what would you change, and why?  Well, I would start by going back in time to when I was a rebellious, ah, seventeen eighteen year old, and I would really try and appreciate my parents more --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, uh, you know 'cause sometimes they would do stuff that really pissed me off, but, in retrospect, most of the time it was in my best interest.
R:  Well --
L:  [MN]  That's a -- that's a pretty good answer.
R:  That's pretty interesting.
L:  Yeah.  Than- -- thanks, Sam.  Yeah.  When I originally --
R:  [LAUGH]  Personally -- personally I thought that most of the insane stuff I did as a teenager was a growing experience.  I wouldn't take any of it back.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I mean --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I probably wouldn't either, but uh, you know, I think I gave my parents a lot of unnecessary grief.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And now --
R:  I hear that.
L:  -- I'm coming to that point in my life where I view them not only as parents, but friends as well.  And I can see, uh, a lot of my own stupidity in growing up, and, and I can appreciate their, their love and grace a lot more now.
R:  Sure.
L:  When I originally posed this question, my answer was going to be that I wished that my dad could breath fire --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- 'cause then when people are making me mad, I'd say "Back off, 'cause I'll have my dad come and breath fire on you".
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, you know that would -- that could be handy.
L:  Mhm.  Because then you figure, "If my dad breathes fire, and it's genetic, then I would probably also be able to breath fire".
R:  In all likelihood, you might have to hit puberty or something 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but [LAUGH] then you'd be able to breath fire.
L:  Uh, what? 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I -- I could see that as sort of a coming of age of sorts, when you breath your first fire.  Are you guys trying to suggest that I'm prepubescent?  Uh, well, it was, the [inaudible] --
R:  No, we're talking about, you went back in time to your childhood.  We're not saying you're prepubescent now. 
L:  [several inaudible words].  Yeah, but you posed the breathing fire theoretically --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and you really don't breath fire at this point.  But  yeah, okay.  I concede.  [PAUSE] Yeah.  Mhm.  
R:  Yeah but, um, I don't know, I never actually wanted to breath fire as a child, myself.
L:  What did you want to do?
R:  [SIGH]  Um, what did I want to do as a child?  I don't know.
