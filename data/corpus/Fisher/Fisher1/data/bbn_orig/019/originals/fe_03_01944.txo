R:  Hi, my name's Cricket, I'm from Southern California.
L:  Hi, I'm Mary.  Ah, tell me again your name? 
R:  Cricket.
L:  Cricket? 
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.  Oh, wh--  
R:  Hi, Mary. 
L:  -- hi.  What does family mean to you? 
R:  Well, you know, that's kinda tough one because I've got, ah, dysfunctional family I guess, um, but family to me, ah, you know, a good family would be, ah, loving parents, people that you could communicate with trust, ah, unconditional love is extremely important [NOISE] when it comes to family and family members [NOISE]-- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] um, I am a mother [NOISE] and are a grandmother and [NOISE] my children, grandchildren will always have unconditional love from me, I will be there for them no matter what, even if they're wrong I'll be there to pick them up and try to help them to get their life, um, together and stuff.  I mean family is -- is important to me, I wish I had a lot of it, I don't have a lot --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of family [LAUGH] I'm the --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- matriarch on my mom's side of the family -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- which means I'm the oldest living relative there --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- um, I -- I've had a tough family, um, but I mean personally I would love to have a wonderful, wonderful family and I don't even know if that's [NOISE] possible any more [LAUGH], you know --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the way things are. [NOISE] Um, how about you, what do you think about family? [NOISE]  
L:  Well, I think like you that it's -- it's really important, it's a support system and, ah, place -- kinda a safe haven --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I -- I'm a mother, a single mother and I guess I -- I feel like single parent family is just as important as a two parent family.  Um, I think, you know, there can be various organizations of family but the important thing would be that there is cohesion, that there's caring -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that there's mutual support, um, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- empathy, um, and well, like you, um, there were some problems shall we say with my family when I was growing up --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- some dysfunction and -- but I think that we -- I think that's not that uncommon to tell the truth and -- and I'm just hoping that in my family that I've had with my children it's been less so, although my daughter is sitting right here and I don't know what she would say, but --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- anyway 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  She actually introduce me to this little -- this, ah, study, so.
R:  Oh, right, great, great  
L:  Um, anyway --
R:  I think families today are a whole lot different -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- than families of yesterday, you know --  
L:  Well, that's really true.  There's been such a broadening of definitions -- 
R:  Right -- 
L:  -- of -- of what family is.
R:  And -- and family doesn't necessarily to me have to be, ah, blood family member.  Um, I consider some of my friends because I don't have family, um, my friends are my family, um -- 
L:  Mhm, mhm. 
R:  -- you know, my best friend, ah, she calls me mom and -- and I'm -- she's family to me, I mean there's nothing in the world -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that I wouldn't do for her.  In fact, um, she's more family to me than some of my family is, you know, --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- um, so, like you said there are different, ah, aspects or branches of family and, um, you know, God there's so many different things out there, there's groups of people that call themselves --  
L:  Mhm --  
R:  -- families, you know --  
L:  -- true.
R:  -- cults and things like that --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- in a way, you know, I know how different is it is now.  Some of the things in the olden days it seems like families were a lot closer to each other, um, back in the olden days, um, --  
L:  Mhm  
R:  -- you know, even go back to the covered wagon days or days of the Indians, everybody was always together, ah, they did everything together, they lived together, um, they just -- it just seemed like, ah, there was more of a bond there -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- than, ah, nowadays.  I don't know if it's a baby boom generation or what it's, but, ah, --  
L:  Well -- 
R:  -- the families have grown -- 
L:  -- yeah.   
R:  -- apart and family values don't, ah, seem to mean so much.  Um, even with one of my own children, um, --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- one is really good and one is really bad -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the bad one unfortunately is my daughter and it hurts, it doesn't -- family doesn't seem to mean anything to her except for when --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she needs something, you know --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she talks bad to me, ah, she wants to fight with me, she doesn't want to listen to me, um --  
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- and I -- I wish that things were different that, you know, I could -- I'm -- I'm there for her whether she knows it or not but I wish she could feel that bond more, you know --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, more with me than I don't know who so she's trusting or talking to, I'm sure she's got somebody, you know, but I just -- I wish that I could be that family person, um --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- in my own family my mom, um, she committed suicide when I was to fourteen --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, I lost her --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my dad, I haven't seen him in twenty years, um, he's in another state but he doesn't -- I don't -- he doesn't even know me --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but he doesn't like me because I ride motorcycles and so --  
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- ah, Harley Davidsons and I wear a leather jacket --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- so, he's classified me as, you know, I guess a Hell's Angle or something like that --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- which I have absolutely nothing to do with anybody like that, I'm a great --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- person.
L:  Ahah.  
R:  -- but the family [NOISE] the family values just don't seem to be there any more and, um, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] and I don't know what we can do to change that, um, you know, except for keep trying and love our family, love our friends love people, ah, show respect to everybody and just hope for the best I guess, you know. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, when you were talking earlier I was thinking about, um, you know, in the olden days when families were closer and I really think that the struggle to survive was so intense that people had to really pull together and in more recent years maybe like after post world war two there was a lot more prosperity --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and kids tend to be -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- much more indulged and maybe just don't, you know -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- feel that need so much --  
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- to pull together --  
R:  [NOISE] yeah -- 
R:  -- um, --  
R:  -- [NOISE] I would think, ah, that some of the other countries, I mean even go over there and look at, ah, Iraq and what's going on and --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- how those people [NOISE] and those families how they live, um, that those families are probably a lot closer than our families because --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] like you said, they have the survival [NOISE] thing, you know --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that they bond together [NOISE] because they have to take care of each other [NOISE] and that's all they have and here in the United States there's so much there and so much distractions and, ah, other things, [NOISE] or opportunities or whatever that, um, the kids and people nowadays are so involved in everything else that they don't even worry about their families --  
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- you know, they just don't seem to have the time or the concern for them, um, which is, you know, that's -- that's sad too, but --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's just the way it's [LAUGH] I guess [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, and I think, um, the other thing that I was thinking of when you were talking is that when, um, families have not been really close or maybe have had a lot of strife or -- or pain in them, I think that those -- the people who grew up in those families do reach out more to friends and I know that to me some of my friends have meant more than my -- my sister or brothers certainly --  
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- um, just because my sister and brother just aren't close with me, but --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- some of my friends really are, and [NOISE] --
R:  And that's sad.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- th- that's sad.  I mean but, like I said, it's the way it is, you know, so we have to go to other means for our -- to feel good and have people we can trust and confide in, you know, --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and our families should be able to be there and that's why I'm hoping that, you know, I can be there for my children and my grandchildren and in fact I'm going to try extra hard and that word unconditional, um, means a lot to me, um, --  
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- to love somebody, um, unconditionally no matter what, you know --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you may not like them or like some of the things that they do, but to love them and still be there and support em and pick em up if you need to or whatever, you know, um, I think in each -- every family that's the way people should be with their family members -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- is no matter what, because --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's your family -- 
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- you can't change your family no matter what, you know --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- and -- and you need to be there for em and for each other, um, I don't know, um, I just -- [NOISE] just hope the world gets better and, you know, I hope best for my life and everybody else's -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know.  I don't know if there's -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- anything I with do to help somebody but, um, you know, if I could help a family, ah, I definitely would, you know -- 
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- definitely.
L:  Well, you know, and when you were talking about your daughter I'm kinda wondering if maybe that's just a stage she's going through in her maturation that at some point she may value her ties to you, her relationship with you more than she does right now.  I don't know --  
R:  I hope so -- 
L:  -- how old she is, but [several inaudible words] --  
R:  -- she just lost her child, ah, to protected services --  
L:  Oh, that's sad.
R:  -- and she lives in another state --  
L:  Ahah. 
R:  -- and, ah, she's not doing anything right to try -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and get her son back, which is just killing me -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and there is nothing that they will let me do about it, they're just gonna keep him in custody up there for a while and I mean -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if I could have him and -- 
L:  They won't study you? 
R:  -- they -- no --  
L:  I work in child protection services in Texas and normally, well under Texas law we study --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- family members, family are considered to be the first choice above foster --  
R:  Right, um, --  
L:  -- parents.
R:  -- I've had some, ah, problems in my own life, so --  
L:  Okay, so --  
R:  -- so even though I'm extremely stable now and I'm --  
L:  Right. 
R:  -- married and everything is going great for me it's -- they, as you know, they look at your past --  
L:  Right and they may [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  -- and if there's problems in your past and they're just not gonna allow this little boy to go to anybody that has any kind of a past --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and I guess if you even looked at my -- my family family's past going down the line from my mother -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and her parents were, ah, dysfunctional -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then she was dysfunctional and then my own family is dysfunctional and now my daughter's dysfunctional -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and even though I got my act together it's just -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, it's -- it's a never ending cycle and it's really -- it's sad, it's hard, you know --  
L:  Ahah.  Are they letting you stay in touch with the child? 
R:  Um, I -- I have no way to -- you know, if I want to fly up to Oregon and see him once -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a week in a child services, um, office or something that would be -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the only way -- 
L:  -- which would be pretty hard? 
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He's been there for like three months now, so I'm not quite sure what's going to happen with him --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I guess every is still open there, um, we don't know -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he's probably even going to be to his grandparents down in Arizona --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which at least he'll be with family.  In fact, I --  
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- I was offered to call, um, you know, the parents down there because they didn't know what was going on, the grandparents --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- to say, "Hey, your grandson is in child services I can't get him, can you?" 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and even though we're not -- we don't communicate or know each other hardly at all -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I would rather see my grandson with some kind of family -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- than with no kind of family or no kind of blood because even foster homes and foster families, um, you know, that's not necessarily the best way to grow up, but there are some good ones, you know, I'm sure there's -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- lots of good people out there that would love, um, love to have a little kid that, you know, it's definitely --
