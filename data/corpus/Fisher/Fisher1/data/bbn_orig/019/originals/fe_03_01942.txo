R:  Well, what family means to you.
L:  Okay.  What does family mean to you? 
R:  Well, I guess it means, you know, something different to every person but I just think it means just like a unit --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as a whole and -- and, you know, p- -- not essentially, you know, like the standard mother, father, baby, child, you know, just a unit of people working together towards one goal.

R:  'Cause [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] That sounds like a good one to me. [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean that's what it means to me.
L:  Right, yeah, that -- that's what it is, everybody working together and -- and, ah, pulling together and just making one big unit.
R:  Mhm.  Especially in today's society I mean there's, you know, we don't hear too many people having, you know, the normal, you know, typical family, so --

R:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you'll have to come up to Nashville. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, really, yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] But -- 
L:  I probably will.
R:  -- of course I'm sure your weather is a lot better than it's here.

R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, tonight and, ah, we've had sprinkles off and on and on all day.
R:  Mhm.  So, we have too, that's funny. 
L:  Yeah, I guess it -- it just goes from one place to the other. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] [COUGH] 
R:  I guess they're going to let us know when this ten minutes is up, huh?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Probably, yes.
L:  But I know they said right at the beginning they would let you know when the ten minutes is up.
R:  Yeah, and I was just like, "Oh, okay, well, let's try this out". 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, I -- you know, like I said I c- -- I did it over the phone and then, you know, I gave them my, you know, my email address and I was like, "Okay, well, send some reading" and on my computer --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- I might as well just call and find out what it's all about.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You get on your computer a lot, Sharon?
L:  I used to more than I do now --  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I used to stay on a lot when I use to do these, um, um, -- oh, I can't think of what the name of it is, it was, ah, where you seeing things on the internet and you made money.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I did that for quite a while and I made -- I used to make like twenty dollars a month or so.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But then they stopped it.
R:  Oh.   
R:  So, it's ah -- it's -- it's not as easy to do it any more as it used to -- 
R:  Used to be.
L:  -- yeah, used to.  I used to stay on it all the time but I'm -- I'm not on it as much as I used to.
R:  Ahah.  Do you work?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  I don't know -- what --  
L:  I'm not --
R:  -- Do you do, Sharon? 
L:  I'm, ah, environmental services supervisor at, ah, one of the hospitals here.
R:  Oh.   
R:  At, ah, Hill South.
R:  Ahah.
L:  And, um, it's -- it's a demanding job -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but it's a job [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I was just going to say, it's a job, huh? 
L:  Yeah.  Do you work? 
R:  Yeah, mhm --  
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I work for the sheriff's department.
L:  Ahah.
R:  And I -- I do civil warrants, so.
L:  Ahah.
R:  It's an interesting job to say the --  
L:  Oh, I bet --  
R:  -- least.
L:  -- it is.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It gives keeps you busy, huh? 
R:  Yes, that's true.
L:  Yes.
R:  Well, you with -- I mean, do all your children live close by or they -- 
L:  Yeah, they do --  
R:  Oh, -- 
R:  -- they do --
R:  -- that's wonderful. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you get to spend time with your grandchildren, huh? 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Well, that's great.
L:  I -- I get em -- usually I keep em every other weekend or so I try to keep at least one day out of the weekend.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Yeah, I get to spend some time with them and it's, ah, kinda difficult with three little biddy ones. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- are -- are -- what ar- are they boys, girls, what are they though? 
L:  The two are boys and the baby is a girl --  
R:  Oh, so -- 
L:  -- yeah, she's a year old.
R:  Oh, she's like extra spoilt because she's a --  
L:  Oh, she is --
R:  -- a little girl? 
L:  -- she's [several inaudible words] baby. 
R:  Ahah. [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Well, you could imagine with your four year old and having two younger --  
R:  [MN] 
L:  It's phew.
R:  I -- phew, yeah.
L:  It's a handful.
R:  Wow, yeah, I don't know, ooh, these people that have more than one children -- I mean one child it's like, oh, my gosh, I don't know how -- how they can do -- well, especially nowadays, you know, I mean I have to work, my husband works, so --  
L:  Right -- 
R:  -- you know, I don't know how people can have more than one child.
L:  I know, and it's difficult.  My son had two, um, -- they both work but they were both working days and, um, I guess is this a big topic for family [LAUGH]. 
R:  Mhm [LAUGH].
L:  They, ah, were both working days and they were paying like almost three hundred dollars a week at child care.
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  So, he changed his, um, schedule to evenings.
R:  Ahah.
L:  So, now he stays home during the day with them.
R:  Yeah, but then he doesn't see her though.
L:  Right, right --  
R:  I -- see, you know -- 
L:  -- on the weekend, yeah. 
R:  You know what, it's funny because that's -- that's exactly the way that my husband and I were, um, -- well, my hu- -- son just was in day care like about -- he's only been in day care for like maybe over a year --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, because we waited.  He worked -- I worked first shift and my husband worked second shift, you know, just so we wouldn't -- you know, we couldn't afford day care.
L:  Right.
R:  Day care was just outrageous and -- and then my -- ah, his job switched around and we both had to go to days so it was just, you know, --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's an adjustment, you know --  
L:  It is.
R:  -- so, I understand it's hard.
L:  Yeah.  Well, they -- they don't get the spend all that much time together but, um, just like on the weekends and most of the time he has to work on the weekends to make up for, you know, the hours he missed during the week --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's -- it's really difficult when they do get to spend time together, I guess they enjoy it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, well, and on the bonus side too whenever my husband and I were working, you know, different shifts, we got along really well because, you know, we spent such little time together --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that, you know, you don't want to spend, you know, a little time arguing over little, you know, piddley stuff, so.
L:  Exactly --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- exactly, yeah.  That's how my husband and I [several inaudible words] work, we are a little bit older --  
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- but, um he works nights and I work days and so usually on the weekends the only time we really get to spend time together.
R:  Mhm.  Now, has he always -- has it always been that way between you too working? 
L:  No, not always, um, for -- for probably about ten years we owned our own business together so we was together continuously --  
R:  Oh.
L:  -- twenty four hours a day and that -- that wasn't all that good either.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  [LAUGH] It was like, "Oh, I need to get away from you" --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] So, I don't know which is worse, being together all the time [NOISE] or not being together enough. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, right, I understand. [LAUGH] 
L:  It's -- it's both difficult, you know. 
R:  Ahah.
L:  But I guess there's no in between. 
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  That's true.  Wow.
L:  So, is your baby in bed? 
R:  Yes.
L:  Yes.
R:  Mhm, that's the only time I get a chance to get on the computer and --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and get to do my little fiddling around.
L:  Mhm, yeah.  I always liked that time of evening when I had mine in bed and it was like, all right, I've got a whole hour --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all to myself.
R:  Ahah. [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  I've gotta limit myself because, you know, you get on the computer and then, you know, you're fiddling around and before you know it you're like, "Oh, my gosh I've been on the computer this long?" 
L:  Ahah, yeah.
R:  So, it's like I really have to, you know, keep -- keep an eye on how long I'm on the computer and, you know, ...  
L:  Right.  And it seems like every time you get on the computer nobody calls for hours and hours until you get on the computer and then everybody, "Oh, I tried to call you last night and your phone was busy". [LAUGH]  
R:  Ahah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] It's like, "Yeah, I was on the computer". [LAUGH]  
R:  Ahah, that's the way it always works, I --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's no, ah, happy in between. 
L:  Yeah.  Ah, you working days now? 
R:  Yes, ahah.
L:  You have to get up early, huh? 
R:  Yeah, I -- well, I get up at five.
L:  Yeah, that's what time I get up too.
R:  Oh, do you --? 
L:  -- at five -- yeah.
R:  Now, what time is it there in Pen- -- 
L:  It's -- [NOISE] it's nine something [NOISE]  
R:  Like quarter after nine? 
L:  [NOISE] Yep.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, same time zone.
R:  So, we're on the same time zone -- 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- okay.
