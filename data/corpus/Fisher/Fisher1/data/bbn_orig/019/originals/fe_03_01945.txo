L:  Hello? 
R:  [NOISE] Hi, um, my name's Andrea, how are you? 
L:  Good, my name's Joe.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  So, I guess we're to talk about families.
R:  Um, yeah, actually, um, I'm kinda new at this, so --  
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I guess if you wanted to go first.
L:  I'll go first.  I'm new too but I guess, ah, I'll tell you a little bit about my family.  [LIPSMACK] Um, my family is actually kinda twisted a little bit because I, ah, was growing up and somewhere along the, ah, I was in kindergarten my parents got divorced, ended up going to live with my dad and somewhere after that I ended up living with my aunts and I grew up with them pretty much, ah, you know, until I graduated until I went to college --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so that was kinda interesting so, it's really they played -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the mother role in my, you know, in my life I guess.
R:  So, you're -- you're an only child? 
L:  No, actually I have, um -- I have [MN] -- what do I have, my God -- three sisters and, ah, brother, he passed away though and, um, it's interesting though because when we -- my parents shifted all around like they actually, ah, I grew up with my -- two of my sisters and my brother.  My other sister for some odd reason went to, um, stay with my mother. 
R:  Mm.
L:  So, that's pretty bizarre cause, ah, we -- we actually grew up very differently, like completely different, ah, like goals and, you know, we went to college, she didn't -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- all that kind of stuff --  
R:  [NOISE] So -- 
L:  -- how -- how about your family? 
R:  Ah, well I guess I -- I also have a kinda unique situation too, um, my sister and I were adopted together --  
L:  Oh, really.
R:  -- so, um, we grew up in a really strange -- strange lifestyle --  
L:  Okay.
R:  -- we -- we're from Korea actually and my parents are Jewish --  
L:  Okay, wow.
R:  -- so, [LAUGH] we were, um, kinda thrown into this really weird clash of culture and -- and there's a lot of prejudice as far as in my own family --  
L:  It's --  
R:  -- I have -- I have really strong ideas about what's important and what should be number one priority among families --  
L:  Mm, that's -- 
R:  -- so ... 
L:  -- so, is the prejudice from like just a lot of people, the Jewish faith, um, weren't as open in accepting, or ...? 
R:  Um, I'm -- I'm not sure if the religion had much to --  
L:  Okay.
R:  -- had much of a major role in it, but I -- I remember that a lot of my -- my grandparents, um, -- well, a few from my mom -- mom -- one from my mom's side and both from my father's side were from orthodox --  
L:  Okay, they were very strict --
R:  -- upbringing.   
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  So, and I remember that my grandfather refused to -- refused to take part in certain activities that --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- that my sister and I did because we belonged to the reformed temple and you couldn't convert in the conservative orthodox and he refused to visit or to talk to my dad and they kinda severed all connections, so ... 
L:  Wow. 
L:  That's was [several inaudible words] 
L:  Do you have a big family though, is it, ah, ...? 
R:  Um, it used to be but not any more.  My -- my mom's grandmother -- I'm sorry, my mom's mother had ten brothers and sisters --  
L:  Wow.
R:  -- but they all passed away and they were -- I don't think they married, so I don't have a lot of like -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- second cousins or anything.
L:  Ahah.  Our family is pretty small too, we, um, it seems that, ah, outside of, you know, the immediate family, brother, sisters I don't really keep in touch.  Haven't really met the aunts and uncles, a lot of them are in different states and things like that but -- so, it's kinda weird, the reunions, weddings things like that --  
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- aren't the largest, but, um.
R:  Yeah.  So, do you --  
L:  [MN] Go ahead.
R:  I was going to ask you, I guess do you have friends that are considered family? 
L:  Um, you know, friends that are considered family?
R:  Well, I mean for me I -- I can say that I don't think blood is -- has anything to do with family.
L:  Well, I -- yeah, I mean -- I -- I guess I completely believe that, I mean I, um, I -- I don't -- can't say that I really have that.  I mean like my aunts, for example, um, were like -- you know, taking the part of my mother and I completely think of them in that respect anything that my mother would do or anything like that I'd look to them, you know, if somebody says "Mother" I think of them, so -- 
R:  Mm. 
L:  -- in some respect they weren't really my mothers but they played that role and I think, ah, they did just as well [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] how did, ah, -- did you actually -- did you try to keep in touch with any of the, ah, culture from South Korea or -- do you speak the language or were you exposed to that, or? 
R:  Um, for a time I was on this little crusade trying to find my birth parents --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  And I always used imagine what I would do if I found them and they already had another -- another family and I had brothers and sisters and they didn't want any part of me, would I get angry upset?  Um, I know that I would -- I would be pissed because I'd feel like I -- I was rejected in a way --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- but then I think that -- I think that it -- I was I definitely like living and growing up as a family in the United States than I would have in Korea --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- so ... 
L:  So, you weren't successful in finding out anything? 
R:  No, it got too expensive.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I realized -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that it really -- it -- it wasn't that important --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- to me.
L:  So, you, um, -- did you go away to school or anything, how old are you, are you? 
R:  Oh, I'm twenty three.
L:  Twenty three.  So, are you going to college, or? 
R:  I'm actually in grad school right now.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, do you keep in touch with your family a lot, do you? 
R:  Yes, we're actually very close since, um, we're just an immediate family.  It's --  it's -- it's my guess we're -- we realize that when you have little family it's important to -- 
L:  Yeah, that's -- 
R:  -- to keep them close.
L:  Yeah, that's how I wish my family would think actually.  It's kinda weird because we have a small family but everyone is pretty bad at keeping in touch and, um, it's kinda -- 
R:  So, you -- 
L:  -- bizarre, so -- 
R:  Do you keep in touch with your --  
L:  So, I -- I keep in --
R:  -- aunts? 
L:  -- touch with my aunts the most, but my father, for example, he's not too far away, yet and I feel like he should be taking more of an active role, but he had -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- remarried and, ah, had two other kids and I feel like he played father to them more so than he did with me, um, --  
R:  I see.
L:  -- so, it's kinda weird because it's like I'd like him to be more of a part of my life but I feel -- actually I still don't know if he understands, you know, that, um, you know, that's important or he's just, I don't know, it just seems like --
R:  So do you still have you -- I guess you haven't spoken that often? 
L:  Well, I mean actually, you know, I talk to him a fair amount, or lately anyway because, um, you know, my grandmother has actually been ill so it's his mother and so, he -- that -- that tends to be bringing us together when we're visiting and things like that, um, but at the same time --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, in terms of, you know, picking up the phone calling, saying, "Hi, how are you doing?" and that kinda thing,  those types of things don't happen unless I initiate, and sometimes it's frustrating because, you know, he does it on the other hand to, you know, his kids with his second wife who actually he's divorced with him now too so [LAUGH] --  
R:  Wow, the guy has record.
L:  -- I think he is through with the marriage concept at this point.
R:  [LAUGH] [MN] 
L:  And in some sense that has kinda played with my mind because now that's like very important to me, like I -- you know, I just got married last year --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I'm so --  
R:  Oh, congratulations.
L:  Thank you and, um, you know, it was so important to me to find somebody whose is like kind of a calm, nice that, somebody who I felt would have the values to not want to leave a relationship because I've just seen how much it can hurt a relationship.
R:  Exactly.  My -- my -- my sister just got married last summer --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, just [MN] however many times they've had arguments threatened to leave each other --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it makes me feel that when people get married especially young, young couples --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- they don't really understand that you can't -- can't up and leave --  
L:  Yeah, it seems like --  
R:  -- you have to work things out.
L:  It seems too easy any more, you know, to [NOISE] -- for people to get up and leave which, ah, is kinda sad because you hear so many cases but, you know. 
R:  Yeah, well, I feel that, like, I guess it's not as bad if you don't have children that you need to split up.
L:  Right, I -- 
R:  [MN]  
L:  -- I guess I agree with that, I mean if you're totally miserable and you don't have kids and, you know, it makes sense to -- to not torture yourselves for the rest of your lives but when you have kids, I -- I -- I guess it's the kinda the way I believe too, I mean you really, really -- I mean you have to try in all circumstances but I mean that's just -- the effects it can have on them just are, you know, you can't overlook that.
R:  I'm sure you can understand --
