L:  Hello, my name is Catena.  I'm calling from New York. 
R:  And I'm Marilyn in Florida.
L:  Oh, hi Marilyn.
R:  How are you?
L:  Okay.
R:  I wish -- I wish I could of understood her, I don't understand the subject matter.
L:  Yeah, it means about the economy I think they're saying, like, "How can you -- what do you think, in other words, you should -- someone should do".  The president, I guess, what he's doing is correct in trying to make the economy work, you know, by lowering, I guess, the um, the taxes and everything, does it benefit us, or -- I know it is kind of a weird question basically --
R:  Well, well, I --
L:  -- to ask us, because -- [LAUGH]
R:  -- I -- see I didn't hear -- I didn't hear anything about the economy.  I heard how can government do to curb illegal activity --
L:  Right.  That was part of it.  And then they were talking about the economy, about the economy.  Illegal activity about the economy, ah, you know, --
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  -- everything, basically.  Or the stock market, how to improve it in other words --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and how it has affected us in any way.
R:  Okay.
L:  Ah, [LAUGH] how to curb illegal, um, -- well, basically businesses you could -- we could say are pretty much, um, following, but again they're doing what they're -- there's a lot of illegal companies out there that are not performing correctly and not showing, you know, their accounts during, during accounting, the IR- -- you know, the taxes, they're hiding a lot of -- you know, important information.  They disclose.  And that's why, ah, companies like AOL and things like, I've heard, in the stocks, and therefore they're, they're -- they're finding them that they have a lot of illegal, um, ah, cases where they find -- I don't know if you've heard of that, with AOL.
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  You know, certain things, they're not really showing their taxes in full and, um, how much money they're making.  They're making it -- the amounts bigger than what they are.
R:  So you're, you're talking about illegal tax returns --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- from companies.
L:  But it's -- that's illegal, that's what I believe they mean --
R:  Okay.  And what were they --
L:  -- you know, ah, --
R:  -- talking about the stark -- stock market?
L:  Well, the stocks affect us too, because people that have invested their money in there --
R:  Are they talking about --
L:  -- are pretty much, um --
R:  -- illegal activity like, um, --
L:  Mhm.  Well in businesses --
R:  -- oh, the current --
L:  -- in businesses, basically.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know, you know.
R:  Okay, okay.

L:  And AOL is a business, and a company.  I presume they're -- you know, they're -- any company, basically.  It's -- this is more like a political question for government, I think.  I don't -- [LAUGH]
R:  I, I agree.  
L:  You know, this would be very hard to answer, you know.  I mean, I'm trying to think of what else to talk about --
R:  I know.
L:  -- illegal --
R:  I know.  Um, --
L:  -- the stock market, and businesses and things like that, how can they improve and, and you know, stop the illegality out there.  It's something that it's very hard to do, really.  Unless they produce laws, more stricter laws --
R:  Well that's --
L:  -- in government, and by lowering taxes --
R:  -- I would say stricter monitoring.
L:  Monitoring, yeah.  Yeah.  But lowering taxes, you think they're doing anything? [LAUGH] I mean, he does want to make a budget, Bush, this year over five hundred fifty billion dollars to cut taxes, you know, in order -- I guess 'cause he sees that this will --
R:  Increase spending.
L:  -- increase -- right, spending, and increase, um, you know, therefore the stocks will go higher, and you know, people who have investments that is.  I don't have any investments.
R:  I don't either.
L:  So for me it's not beneficial.  I don't think like everyone has stocks, you know what I'm saying.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  These are benefits to the wealthy, basically.
R:  Well, I --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- but, but I think it's just, um, encouraging an economy even, even for people like you and I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that, um, might replace a washer and dryer, where we wouldn't otherwise.  Um, I just think it increases spending. 
L:  Right.  I agree too.  I don't think it --
R:  At whatever -- at whatever level.
L:  It does at -- but only to the hands of -- I believe, to the people that have.  You know, I mean if -- I don't think for the people in the middle class or the poor class, um, does it do any -- make any difference to them?  Ah, the people, the richer people of course will have more money in their hands.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, --
R:  Well that's -- I --
L:  -- of course those people that never had it won't have it, basically, you know. [LAUGH] I don't know.  I don't agree with that much tax cutting.  I mean, um, they're thinking more jobs, more beneficial for say people that are not working, there's a lot of people not working now.  I'm working, but --
R:  Well, I think that it, it stimulates the economy to a sense, but I don't know what this tax cuts means --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- to the everyday citizen.
L:  Right, right.  I don't think it really does anything for the everyday --
R:  I don't know what they're talking about how much more goes in their pocket --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I believe that at the time of tax returns --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, even a couple of years ago when they had, um, you got so much back.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't remember --
L:  What do you mean, from the taxes you mean, when they lower the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the federal tax?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, but different types of -- that was a different type of tax.  Because their kind of tax -- mostly this is more caters for businesses, which will improve our jobs and things, you know, like things in that sense, but the kind of taxes you're thinking about is salary, fed taxes or state taxes --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- where they lower them, which gives us more in the pocket.  But this won't though.  What is -- Bush is proposing is totally different.  This won't put money in our pockets more.  I don't -- I mean, I haven't seen my pay check difference [LAUGH] yet.  I um, you know, it -- I don't think it's gonna -- you know, and this one that's proposing is basically for businesses, basically.  It's really for businesses, um, to make it -- but I don't believe that by lowering these taxes businesses will hire more people.  I mean, they're looking to save also, and they're looking, you know --
R:  When there are --
L:  -- so with the stock market down and everything, they're not putting their money in there, their investments are low, so they're losing too.  So I don't see --
R:  They're just trying to recover.
L:  They're trying to recover something that's gonna be very difficult after [LAUGH] you know, for companies -- think of all the money they had invested in stocks.
R:  That's true.
L:  That's true, they're losing and hurting too.  This way it's a benefit to them to make them feel they have more money, and -- but they're laying off a lot of people.  They're still gonna lay off a lot of people by cutting more taxes.  What benefit does it do?  I don't, I don't see the benefit of it.
R:  See, I didn't realize that was going primarily to big business.
L:  Yeah.  Because they're mostly doing the illegal, you know, [LAUGH] is that what the -- the question, right.  They --
R:  Well, no, I didn't understand it that way.
L:  I know, the government illegality and -- I -- I don't know which way -- which way did you understand it?
R:  I understood it to mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that how do we feel that our government --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- can, can -- I believe -- believe they used the word curb --
L:  Curb, yeah.
R:  -- illegal, um, operations, illegal --
L:  Mhm, with businesses. 
R:  -- practices.
L:  Right.
R:  But I didn't understand, um, that they meant how it affected our economy.
L:  Right.
R:  I, I thought -- I understood it -- as an example --
L:  Well what is the government -- let's say --
R:  -- the, ah, --
L:  What is the government doing, yeah.
R:  -- some of the stock market scams --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that have gone on, it's what I thought that they were talking about.
L:  That's what I thought so too, because then the second part they said was about stock and how the scams and everything.
R:  Did you have trouble understanding that?
L:  Well, it didn't make -- it wasn't a general one point question.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was, like, too, too many in all, all at once.
R:  Exactly.
L:  With, like, three different questions, she said.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And it's, like, you know, which one should we answer.  That's why we're having trouble here, you know. [LAUGH] But you know, we're trying, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I --
L:  It's a separate --
R:  -- I agree it's better laws, but I just think that it's better monitoring of those laws.
L:  Mhm.  True, yeah.
R:  And, and I don't know if that's done at tax time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I don't know if it's done through audits.
L:  Right.  It is done through audits.  It is done through -- I know.
R:  I would think that it would have to be --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, and that tells me that it's done at tax time, whether they audit --
L:  Right.
R:  -- mid year, I don't know, maybe they need to --
L:  Maybe they should make more stricter rules and more, ah -- right.  Like twice a year auditing to stop, you know, all these scams going on --
R:  Well I, I also --
L:  -- for the companies, that is.
R:  -- think that there's too many loopholes for business.
L:  There is, there is.
R:  Um, --
L:  I agree with that too.
R:  Even -- I mean, I'm more aware of it in small business and in what I see and what people use as write offs --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that sort of thing.
L:  Right, that's true.
R:  But if they do it, then big business does it to.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, they would even do it more.  Well, they get to write off anything, almost anything, whatever they spend, whether it is for themselves, a vacation for themselves, the president of the company, you know, they write off everything.  So they have their benefits to it too, you know.
R:  Well, outside of whistle blowers in a company --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- how do you feel the generally, um, find out that this is being done?
L:  Outside would be, the only way is, I guess, auditing.  That's it.  Because let's say they would have to report their expenses and what they spend, and they have to really investigate on each one, if they do present them bills and things like that, the paperwork --
R:  Then they would have to -- they would have to --
L:  Right, they would have to investigate each --
R:  -- follow paper trails, and --
L:  Right.  And that's the only way.  And sometimes they can't be accurate because someone -- somebody's gonna say, I spent it on this, when necessarily it wasn't on that.  You know, so it -- maybe for themself.  It does happen.
R:  And so we're talking -- we're talking big time expense --
L:  Right.
R:  -- government expense in monitor this.
L:  Yes, yes.  Probably most likely, yeah.  I don't know if, um, you could -- you can, ah, -- you can curb it, not stop it, that's what they mean.  You can curb it.
R:  Well I personally think that the small --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, small business owner is audited more than, than large corporations.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes, I do.
L:  What, they audit it twice a year or something?
R:  No, I just think that there's too many red flags --
L:  On, on smaller companies, yeah, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- compared to bigger companies.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well maybe they should make more, like you said, more stricter, ah, laws for them to be monitored more often.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's like small businesses, you know, um, sometimes, you know what it is
