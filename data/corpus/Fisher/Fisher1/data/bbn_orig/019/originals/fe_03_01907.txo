R:  [LAUGH] So how is your family doing?
L:  Well, I'm -- I'm fixing to be an empty nester and I'm sad.
R:  Oh.
L:  Uh-huh.  One's in college and one's going to college and I don't know what I'm going to do without 'em.
R:  So, that sounds great though.
L:  I guess. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, my daughter's getting ready to go away to the, um, Child Corps, my oldest one.  She's leaving, and my mom, she just died, like, about a week and a half ago.

R:  Um, I'm thinking about Florida.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Sounds wonderful.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Anything warm climate sounds wonderful to me right now.  Did you have a terrible winter too? 
R:  Oh, the winter was really bad, yeah.  [NOISE] It was so much snow in Philadelphia, it's just ridiculous.  We were digging ourself out for days.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, like, where we stay, at up -- it's up near, like, the [inaudible] and everything and, you know, we get more snow than the people in the city do.  You get snow down there?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Do you get lots of snow? 
L:  The we- -- normally it's not too bad.  I'm -- I'm more down state Illinois, closer to St Louis.
R:  Oh.
L:  And normally our weather's not bad but this winter was bad.  It was the worst we've had in twenty years or so.
R:  Ooh.  Yeah, my father in law is from Cicero[?] Illinois.  I have been there a couple of times but I think about going back for a visit again.  [PAUSE]
L:  I don't like Chicago very much, it's too big, too big.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Too big for you, huh? 
L:  Ah, so do you have boys or girls? 
R:  Okay, I have two girls and the boy is the youngest.  He is, like, kind of, like, you know, spoilt.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Thinks he should have everything his way.
L:  [LAUGH] How old is he? 
R:  Oh, he's fourteen.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  They're, like, right behind each other.  One is fourteen, another one is fifteen and another one is sixteen.  Like steps, you know.  [PAUSE] Still got ten -- [LAUGH] 
L:  So what do you? 
R:  I don't know if it's ten or five or whatever.
L:  I'm sorry? 
R:  I say I don't know how many minutes it is.
L:  It goes pretty fast.  Is -- is this the first one you've done?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I did one yesterday, and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  And, ah, I talked to this really sweet college girl in Florida.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And all of a sudden it was just over.  They come on and say, "You've got thirty seconds to say goodbye to your person".
R:  Oh, that's sad. 
L:  And it went real fast.  It was -- it was really kind of fun. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you don't have nobody over in, um, -- in the war, do you?
L:  No, I don't.  Do you? 
R:  No, thank God.  But I do know somebody who's over there, a friend of, um, the family has, um, a girlfriend that's over there.  So -- 
L:  Yeah, that would be terrible.
R:  Yeah, he's really kinda going through changes, he's really depressed and everything.
L:  You mean the person here or the person over there? 
R:  Yeah, the person here.
L:  Oh.
R:  I gotta feel sorry for him.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] But you don't know.
L:  It would be very hard.
R:  You know, you don't know if they're coming back or -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  My brother was in the Marines for a long time and that was kind of a scary feeling too.  And I used to wonder if he was going to come back a lot of days.  [PAUSE] [NOISE]
L:  I just love hearing the background noises there. [LAUGH]
R:  Huh? 
L:  You must be outside or something, huh? 
R:  Yeah, outside right near the beach. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  Looking at the sea gulls and -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  And it is really nice out here.  My mom used to bring us down to the shore every single summer.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, it was really nice, and then some summers we'd go to North Carolina and stay with my grandma and stuff, you know.  My grandma's right now, she's -- my mom's mom, she's still alive.  She's like, ninety eight years old.
L:  Wow.
R:  She's in a nursing home.  She's got one leg.  I'm going to go see her, you know, because as I say she's not doing too good.
L:  Is she near by you? 
R:  Uh-huh, she's all the way in North Carolina, a long little ride from there.  [PAUSE] Well, it refers to the topic of family, I don't know what [LAUGH] family means to me. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Family means a lot to me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think family is very important, very important.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  So you said you was married? 
L:  I have been married thirty years.  How about you? 
R:  That is beautiful.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I was married for ten years.  I got divorced and I got remarried so I have been married for, like, four and a half years now.
L:  Oh, great.
R:  Mhm, yes.  Marriage is, ah, something you got to really work at.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] I agree.
R:  You know.  My mom and dad was married for, like, forty five years before she died so I think they were, um, I think they were pretty happy.
L:  Time just goes so fast, you know.  I feel like I blink my eye and -- 
R:  Ooh.
L:  Doesn't it seem like yesterday your kids were little?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they were just little babies.  Now, they're just all, like, grown. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  They got so many friends and running around, having little get togethers.  Do you have, um, [inaudible] busters up there?
L:  We do, well, St Louis has one.  It's about an hour from me but -- 
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  Why? 
R:  Yeah, my kids love it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They go all the time.
L:  I love it too.

R:  It's a real family place anyway, take everybody.
L:  Yeah.  Something for everybody there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And here the food's very good.
R:  Huh?

L:  Well, you have to go there.
R:  Okay.
L:  That's good.
R:  I will check that out.  How about Old Country Buffet? 
L:  Yes, we have that.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The kids stay in there.  When I get 'em in there, I can't get 'em out of there.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You must be hungry, huh? 
R:  They love eating.  They love it, they like going to the supermarket shopping.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, "Huh, mom, are you going to the supermarket?"  "Yeah, I'm going to go", "Okay I'm going".  I don't ever have to worry about carrying a bag.
L:  Oh, how nice.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So you say you have two kids that are, um, on their way to college?

R:  Do you know what they're majoring in?
L:  Yes, my oldest one is majoring in, ah, mechanical engineering.
R:  That's good.
L:  Yeah.  And I hope so but he's worried about finding a job and everything.
R:  Oh, and the other one is -- 
L:  And the other one is a senior about to graduate from high school.
R:  Okay.
L:  And he's going to go to college in the opposite direction from my other one.

L:  I'm sorry.
R:  Do they know what college they're going to?
L:  Yeah.  One goes to -- ah, in northern Illinois and one's going to go to southern Illinois.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I'll have 'em at both -- both ends of the state and I'm in the middle.
R:  Wow.
