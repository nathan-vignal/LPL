L:  Hey Kathy, my name is Lexi.  How are you?
R:  Hi, good, how are you?
L:  Oh, good.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I am from -- well, originally I'm from Philadelphia, but I live out in California.
R:  Oh gosh, 'cause I'm from Philadelphia.
L:  Oh really? [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  That's so weird.
R:  Isn't that something, yeah.
L:  That's funny.
R:  I did this once before and the woman was from, ah, Indiana.
L:  Huh.
R:  So I know these people are from all over, it's fascinating. [LAUGH]
L:  It is interesting.
R:  It is.
L:  I um, I only -- I was called one other time, I just signed up for this recently --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it was funny, because, um, I got connected to this other woman --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and she really wasn't saying much --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  -- and I was talking to her and talking to her --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and finally she goes, what is this about?  Are you selling something? [LAUGH]
R:  Are you kidding?
L:  [LAUGH] No.
R:  Oh boy.  What --
L:  I was like, you're not part of the project?
R:  Wow.
L:  She's like, no.  I'm like, didn't you have to go through -- I mean --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- accept the call and every- she was like -- 
R:  That's right.  That's really strange.
L:  It was so weird.  So I'm so glad you know what this is about. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I know exactly what it's about, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I was a little nervous.
R:  Yeah, after that experience, yeah, that's a little bit, ah, nerve wracking.
L:  It is.
R:  Yeah, there is -- I hate to say it, but there's some strange people out there.  I mean that -- that's strange, you know.
L:  It really is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  I mean, especially, like, accepting the call, you know -- oh, okay, well this is the thing I signed up for.  Like, wouldn't you -- wouldn't that register just about immediately? [LAUGH]
L:  I, I -- you would think so.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  But I -- I emailed the people, ah, the next day and said, do you randomly call people?  They were like, no, we don't, it must of just been -- I don't know --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- it's strange.
R:  Yeah, that's the only word for it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause the last time what happened was I gave them a certain time, between a certain hour and the robot operator called me --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and this time I decided to call.  I said, gee, you know, I --
L:  Me too, I did the same thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, that's great. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um, are you originally from Philadelphia?
R:  Yes, I've lived here all my life, yeah.
L:  Nice, very nice.
R:  Uh-huh.  Where were you from in Philly, whereabouts?
L:  Well, um, I grew up in Drexel Hill --
R:  Uh-huh, sure.
L:  -- and then I moved, ah, my family moved to Medea when I was, um, in high school.
R:  Oh yeah, Delaware County, yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm in, ah, right now -- I'm originally from East Oak Lane, now I'm in Northeast Philly.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Very nice.
R:  So it's -- I don't know how long you've been out in California?
L:  Ah, pretty recently --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I moved out in October.
R:  Oh.
L:  I was -- I was in New York for a while, and then I moved, ah, I moved out in October.  So --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, how come you moved out there?
L:  Ah, I'm in the, um, trying to be in [LAUGH] the entertainment business.
R:  Oh really?  That's fascinating.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I um --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I work for a show called Crank Yankers.  I don't know if you've ever heard of it before.
R:  Never heard of it -- never heard of that, no.
L:  It's on Comedy Central.
R:  Oh, okay.  That's great.
L:  But ah -- but yeah, so -- it's, it's been fun.  I -- I'm getting a little homesick now, though I mean I have my sister and friends from the area out here, but I miss -- I miss Philly.  Especially in like the spring and summer.  It's so nice.
R:  Oh it is, yeah.  And we had a beautiful -- we had a picture perfect day out here, it was about sixty five degrees --
L:  Oh, that's so nice.
R:  We're long overdue, we've had a lot of miserable weather, like we -- like, ah, what, a few weeks ago it was thirty five degrees and --
L:  Horrible.
R:  Yeah, I know.  So this -- this is long overdue. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] My parents call and they're always like, please, bring us out there, it's miserable --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- I can't stand the snow anymore.
R:  Yeah, it was like the winter that wouldn't die.  Like -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like those old horror movies, you know.
L:  Really. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] The winter that wouldn't --
L:  It happens that way, like you'll have m- a couple of mild winters and then you really get hit with a lot of snow, and it's cold winter for you guys.
R:  I know, I know.  We're on safe ground now, you would think.
L:  Right, right.
R:  The end of -- April here, gosh.
L:  Yeah, I know, I -- 
R:  It's hard to believe.
L:  I hope so. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But um, so are you, are you married, or are you --
R:  Actually I'm -- I've never been married.  I'm forty one, never been married. [LAUGH]
L:  Good for you.
R:  How old are you -- you sound young, you sound a lot younger than me.
L:  I'm twenty six.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's young.
L:  Yeah.  And, ah, and I am not married. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's still -- not that I'm the oldster, but that, that's still young yet, you know.  Looking back when you're forty one you think wow, that -- that is -- you know, you do have time ahead of you for that, you know.
L:  Right.  You have plenty of time ahead of you as well. [LAUGH]
R:  I guess.  I guess so too. [LAUGH] I know, it's true.
L:  You do.  Trust me. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  At this point I don't think I want kids, so it's, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I have to decide pretty fast, but you know.
L:  Right.
R:  But the thing is, it just, ah --
L:  It's a big decision.
R:  It is.  Yeah.
L:  And it's not for everyone.
R:  That's true.  Yeah.  It's just so overwhelming, I guess, you know.  I mean -- and some people I guess really that's all they've ever wanted, you know, and some people, you really have to think long and hard.  You know, some people just really jump into things without deciding.
L:  Without thinking about anything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It amazes me. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.
L:  But, ah, yeah, it's a big responsibility.
R:  Oh, it is.  Absolutely.
L:  Having children.
R:  Very costly and overwhelming, it just takes so much out of you, you know.
L:  It does.  It does.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But um --
R:  The sad thing is so many people after they've had kids, you know, decide, gee, why did I -- now that must really be sad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.  My, um, my mom said when she -- she was like, you know.  She was like, I never particularly was like that eager to have children --
R:  How 'bout that.
L:  -- she said that, um -- I mean, she wasn't against it --
R:  Right, sure.
L:  -- but it was -- she got married when she was -- I guess she was like thirty --
R:  Oh, okay, that's a good age.
L:  Which back in the day was a little bit on the late side.
R:  Oh it was, sure was.
L:  Now it's like normal, but um --
R:  Right, now it's normal, right.
L:  But she said, yeah, I had a great time being single and had a lot of fun --
R:  Oh, that's great, oh, that's great.
L:  -- and I wasn't sure that I even, you know -- I didn't need to have children, like, um, but your father really wanted to --
R:  I'll be darned.
L:  -- and she said, I'm glad I did, you know, but --
R:  Oh, yeah.  And you're glad she did too. [LAUGH]
L:  Me too.  I'm like, yeah, good thing, Mom. [LAUGH] That's a nice conversation we're having.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was, ah -- she was, like, no, I -- I was glad I did.  But --
R:  Sure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So you like it out in California?
L:  I do.  I do.  I, um -- it kinda gets a bad rep out here, especially from people on the east coast --
R:  Yeah, sure.
L:  -- it was like, why you moving out there?  But um, it's funny because most of the people I work with are from the east coast, a lot of people --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  -- from Philadelphia, which is --
R:  No kidding.
L:  -- strange.
R:  I'll be darned.
L:  And, um, and so it doesn't -- and so many people out here, it's so kind of transient that --
R:  Yes, I've heard.
L:  -- it's easy to make friends because everyone is sort of new and just got into town and -- so, it's been fun so far --
R:  That's great.
L:  -- I mean, I don't know if I -- I'm gonna stay out here forever.
R:  Oh, sure.  Especially your family is back there.
L:  Right.
R:  I always ask people when they move that far, that's why I asked you, you know, how come you mo- I, I just ask everyone that's moved that far.
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause I'm a person who's stayed here my whole life, so I guess that's -- you know, I just wonder -- I guess it's a lot of, ah, different reasons for people, some people go to school, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- some people it's job.  That's probably, you know, the big, biggest reasons, I would imagine.
L:  Well, the thing about where we're from too is it's such a nice area, and there's -- there's so much to do.
R:  Oh yeah, that's what I love.
L:  That, I mean, you kinda don't really need to unless you have, like, a goal in mind, like --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- ah, for a job, or -- I don't know.  For a relationship or school or whatever.
R:  Right.
L:  So.  But actually my, my boyfriend lives in Philadelphia. [LAUGH]
R:  Really?
L:  He does.
R:  Oh, that's fascinating.  How was it maintaining a long distance relationship?  That, that subject fascinates me.
L:  You know, well, I was really nervous --
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- but we -- I was living in New York and he was living in Philadelphia, so it was always sort of --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a long distance thing.
R:  Oh, really?  From the beginning.  I'll be darned.
L:  From the beginning.  We, we had known each other, we had met like briefly when we were in high school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We didn't go to the same high school.  Um, and then, ah, we had like a lot of mutual friends.  And we kind of met up again and we started dating, and then I decided that I really just wanted to -- I wanted to try California and I just figured I should go now --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because if I waited longer I wouldn't do it.
R:  That's true, yeah, yeah.
L:  So, I, um, I talked to him about it, and he actually -- he's always wanted to move out here as well --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- so he is trying to -- he's been looking for work out here.
R:  Oh.
L:  So he's thinking about making the move.  I mean, I -- I'm not holding my breath --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because it's a big thing to ask someone.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  It was really hard moving out here, picking up and, and moving out.  But, um --
R:  Oh, it must of been.  See, myself, I can't imagine it, but that's just me, I guess I'm a little set in my ways.
L:  No -- yeah, but it's, it's tough.  Anybody who's done it --
R:  Oh it must be, gosh. 
L:  -- knows that it's, ah, you know, it's not easy.  And you really -- like most of my friends are in Philadelphia.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, and so it's a little bit tough.  But --
R:  Sure.
L:  I'm so glad I'm talking to someone from Philly. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, this is great.  Isn't this something, yeah.  That's funny, you're from here and then you moved out to California.  That, that's really something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So how did you get hooked up with this study?
R:  The, ah, Philadelphia Weekly.
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  Yeah.  So I'm sure you're familiar with that, being from, you know, originally from this area.
L:  I am, yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was leafing through it and I thought, oh, this sounds good.  And, you know, you make a little mon- bit of money, plus it's fun, you know.  I like to talk to people, so I found that fascinating, so I thought oh.  And they're having another study coming up that's I think you'd be -- better be able to do twenty five calls.  This is, I think, up to three.
L:  Right.
R:  And the other --
L:  I read that.
R:  -- is twenty five -- oh, you did too?  Really?  You saw that too?
L:  I, I read that, yeah, I got -- my friend, um, from work sent me, ah, this link, and then they mentioned that.  I don't know, I mean, I signed up for the twenty five calls, but I don't know how they pick that, so.
R:  I don't know.  I told them I was interested, but I don't know -- I don't even know when it's gonna -- I think it's coming up in a couple of months.  I'm not sure though.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  What did you hear, when is it coming up to -- what did you hear?
L:  Um, it was with part of the email I got, and it said, if you're interested in doing
