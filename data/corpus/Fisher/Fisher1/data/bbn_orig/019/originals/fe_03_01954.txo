L:  Hello? 
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Leanne.
R:  Hi, Leanne.  My name is Cindy.
L:  Okay.  This is a very general topic. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Which is better than a specific topic that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you can only talk about for one minute and then you're done, and you're talking about your family --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so I guess, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  You wanna start, or?
R:  Um, sure.  Um, I'm, um, I have four children.  They're all grown and gone.  Um, I just got blessed with my eighth grandchild.
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You have a big family then? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I do. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I'm still real young, so it's a little bit --
L:  How old?
R:  I'm fifty.
L:  Oh, sounds like my parents.
R:  Yeah? [LAUGH]
L:  That's great.  No, that's great.
R:  And I'm, um, raising one of my grandchildren.  I've had her since she was born.
L:  Oh, a young one too, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, she'll be twelve --
L:  Oh my goodness. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I've had her for almost twelve years, so.
L:  So that's like another daughter or something, then. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes, it is.  It's -- yeah.  So how about you?
L:  Um, I'm thirty one --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And my parents are about your age, you know, a little bit older.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But they started young too. [LAUGH] But yeah, I have two daughters, and um, one's in preschool, they're five and six --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and one's in kindergarten, so.
R:  Neat.
L:  I'll be pretty young when mine grow up and move out too. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  What family means to me.  Let's see.  My family's all really close, we all live in the same state --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so, it -- you know, I see them frequently --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, I grew up with also kind of an extended family, friends of the family that we always called grandma and aunt and uncle, so to me family means, you know, anybody that's there for all the important times in your life, and anybody that whenever you have a problem you can call them up and they'll help you, and they're not going to be judgmental.
R:  Right.
L:  So, technically I could say a few of my family members are less like family and more like acquaintances. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, well we all have those, don't we. [LAUGH]
L:  There always are, I think. [LAUGH] So yeah, that's what I consider family.  And I feel really blessed to just have as many people around as I do, and since everybody did start young, my children have met their grandparents, great grandparents and know them well, and we just started to lose some of them recently, but you know, we've been really blessed to have a very big family and, and to meet everybody, you know.  I remember my great grandparents, so.  That's a good thing about starting young, right?
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  You get to know all your grandchildren -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- before you pass away. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it sounds like you don't have, um, like, you have a very connected family, like not many divorces or --
L:  We have no divorces anywhere in our family.  
R:  See I think --
L:  Oh my gosh, I can't even imagine that.  We don't.  I didn't even think about that.  My parents aren't divorced, none of my grandparents are divorced, none of my aunts and uncles have ever been divorced.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  See, that makes a big difference.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because divorce just really splits a family, just splinters it off, you know.
L:  I think it has to.  I mean, I don't know how it couldn't.
R:  Right, and then it --
L:  Unless you just happen to be in one of those situations where the people are just -- get along so sickeningly well, but -- [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Yeah.  And then, you know, there's like stepparents, and then there's --
L:  Yeah, it's hard.
R:  -- more family, and then --
L:  Is that your family? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my gosh.  You know.  I mean, it's, it's like the story of, of generations, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my, my grandmother on my mother's side was married seven times.
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  And my mother is on her fourth marriage -- fourth of fifth, [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  Oh my gosh.  So what does family mean to you then, as far as the step family goes?  Is that just anybody who marries into the family, or -- [LAUGH]
R:  You know, that's just it.  You never really connect, you know.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, I have -- I'm the oldest and I have three brothers.  Um --
L:  Okay.
R:  And my, and my youngest brother is actually a half brother.
L:  Okay.
R:  But, um, I mean, I was there when -- I was eleven when he was born, so I, you know --
L:  You watched him grow up.
R:  -- he's like my brother.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Then, um, my brothers and I are close, we all live in different places, I have one brother here in the same town with me.  Everybody else is scattered.
L:  That's hard.
R:  Yeah, it is really hard.  And so it's hard just to stay in touch, um, then you know, there's all those little family things that happen.  You know, there's the divorce and --
L:  There's the divorce, and --
R:  -- then there's remarriage, and --
L:  Everybody takes their sides, and --
R:  Exactly. 
L:  Right.
R:  And then, and then somebody has a baby and you don't find out about it for a while because everybody's mad -- you know what I'm saying?
L:  Oh my God, yeah.
R:  It's just really -- it's hard, it's disconnected, because I -- because all it takes is that first divorce.
L:  Right.
R:  And, and then things just start going really awry.
L:  You said your mom's married five times, four times?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That would be really hard in itself.
R:  Yeah, it is, and because -- 
L:  To try to have a man walk into the house and take over as a role model over and over again.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it is -- it's tough.  So for me, my family is, um, immediate.
L:  Right.
R:  It's what's immediately --
L:  Who's living in the house or who's just moved out. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  You know, um, my husband and I have been married for seven years, and, and he's, um, sixteen years younger than I --
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  He, he never was married, he's never been married, so he doesn't have any children, so --
L:  He must be a responsible man then. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  He's that much younger than you and he's got it together.
R:  He, he's learned -- he's, [LAUGH] he's --
L:  I think my husband's just about figured it out now.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, we've been together for ten years.  But -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- well, married for ten years, together for sixteen.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We've been together since I was fourteen.  But it's like he's finally growing up now that he's in his thirties. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Well, this one had to learn real quick, because I had the granddaughter.
L:  Well there you go.
R:  You know.  And she was only four when we met.
L:  Oh my God, that's a hard time.
R:  Yeah, and he --
L:  That's a very hard time.
R:  -- had never been around children, you know, he had never had any.
L:  Oh my.
R:  But, um, so what I have built here with my husband and my granddaughter, and now the mother, you know, my daughter --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of this -- of the grandchild that I'm raising --
L:  Right.  Is she's still in the house too?
R:  She -- no, she has just come into the house in the last year --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, it was --
L:  That's hard, yeah.
R:  -- it was like a drug thing, you know, and all that --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and now she's got, now she's gotten herself straightened out and lived here for a year, and she's gotten her first job, and she's -- I'm trying to connect those two, my granddaughter and her back again.
L:  That's so great.
R:  You know, so --
L:  And she's probably old enough to accept -- start accepting that now, probably too.
R:  A little.  There's still a lot of resentment, you know.  It's like, why didn't you want me when you were young?  Why -- why did Grandma raise me and you didn't, you know.
L:  Because honey, you'd probably be a mess. [LAUGH]
R:  That's right.  Or you wouldn't even be part of this family, you know.  
L:  That's right.
R:  She could of ended up in the system, heaven forbid.  You know --
L:  Oh.  My mom works with kids that are in the system, she's a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- behavior classroom teacher --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and you know, it's just terrible.  You know, kids of druggie parents who don't have grandparents that will accept them and take them in.
R:  Right.
L:  It's just a mess.
R:  Well, I was just -- I've been reading a lot on the subject, and there are over thirty thousand grandparents across the United States --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- that are raising --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- grandchildren because --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what's the alternative?
L:  The alternative is to never see your grandchild again, which unfortunately some people don't care, you know.
R:  I know.  I know.
L:  They just say, I don't care, you know.
R:  And see, that's part of me going, now wait a minute --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I know that there should be a core family, and this baby belongs in my family, and that's where that baby's gonna stay, you know.
L:  Oh definitely.
R:  And, and of course I was a single parent when all this happened, and working and, and still had a son at home, you know.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and all of a sudden I have a baby, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Here you go, start again. [LAUGH]
R:  See, that's kind of what family's been like, you know, for me.  I'm trying to break the cycle.  I'm trying to keep my family -- at least my children, you know, and my grandchildren.
L:  Some stable sort of environment for them.
R:  Right.  Trying to give them some kind of stability that, you know, I didn't have, or that --
L:  It sounds like you must be around for them too then.
R:  Oh, I am.  I just --
L:  Because a lot of moms and dads aren't.
R:  I -- actually I quit doing what I was doing -- I was working fifty to sixty hours a week --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- up until last June, and I decided no, I'm not going to do that.  Um, it's not that I could -- I certainly couldn't afford to quit work --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but I decided to start a home, a home type business --
L:  That's where I'm at too.  Gotta do it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Gotta do it.
R:  Where did you hear about the Fisher project?
L:  On line.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  On a -- on a forum?
L:  On a forum.
R:  Me too. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I think it was Your Daily Freebies.
R:  Your Daily Freebies?
L:  YDF, yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think, I think I found out about it on Lila's.
L:  Don't know that one.
R:  Ok, okay.
L:  YDF is a huge board.
R:  Pardon me?
L:  Your Daily Freebies is a huge board.
R:  Oh, is it?
L:  Absolutely huge.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  How many of these calls have you gotten?
L:  This is -- I've gotten several in the last few days and I didn't accept them 'cause my --
R:  Me too. [LAUGH]
L:  -- my kids were still awake, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my husband was here, and I'm like, oh.
R:  It was a bad time for me too.
L:  Yeah.  This is my second one that I've completed now.
R:  Me too, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I've -- I think I turned down the last three.  They come -- they've been coming every night.
L:  That's good, they keep calling back.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I guess --
L:  Hey, I like the extra money I make this way, between that and all the surveys I do, and --
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  -- all the freebies I get and if I don't want them I Ebay them, and. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Oh that's really cool.  I kind of went off in that same direction as you, trying to, um, you know start some kind of home based, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- thing.  So I've been, I've been doing a lot of mystery shopping.  And --
L:  Oh, fun.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I never had -- I haven't had time to do that, but I'm going to this fall when both of my children will be in full time.  One of my daughters is special education, so she requires a lot of time --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- yeah.  And I -- I've done a couple of pizza shops where it's delivery to the door, so I haven't even had to leave the house, so. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh no.  You didn't have to take those awful pictures, did you?
L:  I didn't have to take pictures, no. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, good. [LAUGH]
L:  Would never take pictures of coagulated cheese, no. [LAUGH]
R:  Hm.  Yeah, I've been trying to -- I just started that in November, and I'm, I'm doing about seventy to eighty of them a month right now --
L:  Oh my gosh. 
R:  -- and, um --
L:  What's the best way to get into those, because I haven't found a real solid -- I mean, I looked into it for a little while --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and there was nothing really regular or anywhere to start that I
