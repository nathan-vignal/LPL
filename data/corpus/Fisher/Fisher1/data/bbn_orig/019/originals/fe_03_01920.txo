L:  [NOISE] Hello? 
R:  Hello. Uh, my name is Audrey.
L:  Audrey?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Hi. I'm Adam. 
R:  Hi Adam. 
L:  How are you? 
R:  Uh, uh, I live in New York. [LAUGH]
L:  Good. 
R:  And --
L:  I'm in -- I'm out in near San Francisco, Berkeley. 
R:  Oh, well.  I've been to Berkeley, but many years ago.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's a very casual town. 
L:  Yes.  It is. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, lots of people fly around.  Um, [LIPSMACK] any way the topic is, um, on family 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, uh, what are your thoughts on family? 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I'm for it.  [LAUGH]
R:  You're for it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh.
L:  Pro family, how's that sound? [LAUGH] 
R:  Pro family. Um, how was your family when you grew up? 
L:  It was a -- I -- very good family.  Very functional, unlike most of my friends.  So, I've, uh, my parents, and two sisters, and a brother.  And, uh.
R:  You have a good size family. 
L:  Yeah, and getting bigger.  My, uh, my siblings are all married, and they're all having kids.  So, uh, we got quite an extended family.  Both my --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- both my sisters live in, live in the area, as well do my parents.  All nearby.
R:  Umm, and h- h- have you been married more than one time? 
L:  I have not been married, I'm single.  I don't have any kids myself. 
R:  Oh, you're single, right. [SIGH]  Because I was in California, years ago, and I'd moved from New York, to California.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, people didn't stay in marriages as long in California.  But now that's true in the east coast too. 
L:  Yeah, it seems to be all over. 
R:  Right.  I grew up in a very, uh, stable family structure.  My father was a school teacher, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my mum was a homemaker, uh, until I got to go to college, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, my father never wanted her outside of the home, uh, but when I was in college, um, I went to this place to work and they were so desperate for help they said, "Would your mother like to --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- go in?"  She went in, a- and became shop steward, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and my parents after one year, my mother said, "Listen, Harold, you're gonna have to help around the house, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or otherwise I'm gonna to quit work".  And he liked the money coming in.  
L: Yeah.
R:  So, um, uh, she, uh, their marriage grew better, cause when I was growing up, he didn't know how, um, eh, to find the salt in the kitchen.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  And after she started working, and she said, "you're gonna have to help around here", uh, he became what I would call the casserole king, for us being able to cook.
L:   Cook.  Right. 
R:  Uh, and I've had uh, good relationships, uh, with, with um, people that I would of married, but I miss a lot of men who had been married once before, [LIPSMACK] and they're a little gun shy. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Going -- Uh, the second time cause we have had a lot of pressure put on the family in the last, uh few years. I, I'm with you, I'm very pro family. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I don't feel New York City, is an environment where I'd lived, um, that, uh, is family friendly. 
L:  Right. 
R:  Uh, it doesn't make any difference if you're young, or you're old.  There's certain things I wasn't aware of when I was younger, that I am sensitive to now.  The schools are a disaster.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] And if you have kids you want 'em to be able to go to at least -- why should you have to pay two times, to -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- go to school? 
L:  Absolutely. 
R:  Uh, public, and private schools.  [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  In California, it's strange because some of the schools are really good, but then a few miles away you have schools which are horrible.  So, it's all dependent on the neighbourhood you're --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- in. 
R:  True.  That's very true.  I'm, but I'm in a nice neighbourhood, in Manhattan.
L:  [inaudible] is the schools bad? 
R:  The schools are, um, parent people who pay two times. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  It's okay for children --
L:  Oh, right, I see what you mean.  Yeah. 
R:  -- into, into middle school they're okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, elementary, 'til, um, about sixth grade it starts getting better at seventh. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  High school, um, I would not send my high school students to the public school in my neighbourhood.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, however, if, uh, you know the ropes, and your child can pass the tests, they can get into some better schools, but you can't be assured you are gonna to have a child 
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's gonna get into the better school.  And for a senior citizen, it's not that friendly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, like --
L:  That surprises me, I would think that there would be enough 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of the senior population that it would be --
R:  Uh, there is, is a strong senior population, but they're not listened to.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] And there are certain things that are hostile.  Uh, like I went out to Brooklyn, a couple weeks ago, and, uh, because of the World Trade Centre disaster, uh, there's been a lot of [inaudible] in how to read the transportation maps. 
L:  Right. 
R:  Uh, the phone service so you can plan it in advance -- how to get -- I just wanted to go shopping in Brooklyn, [SIGH] and just to get to Brooklyn, um, I- I had difficulty on the transportation system, but that wasn't the senior most unfriendly thing. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  The most unfriendly thing is, the subway stations didn't have elevators.
L:  Oh, really. 
R:  No, it's okay for me.  But I thought, you know, "What does a senior citizen do?"  And a lot of people like to come into Manhattan. 
L:  Sure. 
R:  The steps are too steep, and that's true even in Manhattan --
L:  I would --
R:  -- you have t-, t- --
L:  I would of thought ADA. would of really taken care of the American with disabilities, and how --
R:  Oh, they paid tonnes of money 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in buildings.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But if you're charging, uh, rent of two thousand a month, that's not senior housing, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- even though it's -- it's -- they, they spent all of the money to make it capable for disabilities, and, um, it's -- it's -- it's a shame because the only people, uh, need --there needs to be planning so that when they go out they know where they can go, to use the -- the bus transportation works very well --
L:  Mhm.
R:  --uh, but the subways no.  So that's okay.  There is something there, cause the buses  
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- lean down, um, --
L:  At least, at least you have public transport, you should try this area.  [LAUGH]
R:  You don't have it? 
L:   Well 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- we have it but it's -- it's pretty sparse, pretty far between.
R:  Oh, okay.  The thing is, [MN] women you know in families who wanna go shopping with their kids, if you don't have elevators, or escalators, it's not a friendly environment to move around and do things with your family.  Um, one thing that I saw within the last week that I thought was so nice.  I went into a supermarket and there was a father 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and his son had a baby shopping carriage, that the market provided 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and he had his own basket full of goods, and he checked out independent of his father, and he had to of been around seven or eight years old. --
L:  That's great. 
R:  -- And I --
L:  Good training. [LAUGH]
R:  -- said to the -- I said to the dad, and I said to the boy -- and said, "You have such a nice father".  I said, "When I grew up, my father never went to the grocery store and did the shopping.  Uh, you're very lucky to have such a nice father", and he just -- the father beamed 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and the son beamed.  And it felt so good.
L:  Yep. 
R:  Um, to see that there are changes coming about, but you need an environment that supports having families, and, uh, it means that economically in tough times, as well as better times, that there's the support systems around.
L:  Right.
R:  And you came from a larger family, so you should have that network.
L:  That's right. 
R:  With -- my family kind of broke apart.  Uh, both my parents died relatively young.  My brother w- -- moved out to California.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  And, uh, I'm in -- in New York -- and I have some friends here who believe it or not, I still stay in touch with friends in California. 
L:  Sure. 
R:  And one of the most, uh, -- the best things I heard, was this friend in, in uh the LA area who's a flight attendant. [LIPSMACK] Um, she has this boyfriend who was the first to getting married if they can -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- go in, and didn't always want to do stuff, uh, because, um, he felt that he had done it all 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when he was married -- and I- I just spoke with her, and I haven't talked to her in a long time.  I talked to her in the last couple of weeks, and she said to me that her mum who is eighty said, "Beverley, when are you going to get married?" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "You know I'm eighty right now ".  And believe it or not, she and her friend, Harry, who'd known each other for years, when he wouldn't budge.  They're now married. 
L:  Oh, that's great. 
R:  And they're building a home in Santa Barbara, and they're happy.  And she'd seen so much more as he 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, and, it's funny 'cause when he was single, she used to complain. 
L:  Mhm
R:  No complaints about him.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, which is nice. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Umm.
L:  Oh, you know I -- it seems to me that a lot of second marriages actually work out pretty well, because I think people know more about it.
