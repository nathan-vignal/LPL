L:  Hi, this is Karen Duncan.
R:  Hi, I'm Anne.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, did you hear the topic?
L:  It said something about the topic was, ah, what the government could do to, um, curb illegal activity in businesses.
R:  Right, right.  How do you feel about that?
L:  [SIGH] How they can curb it, they could slap, ah, heavy duty fines on them.
R:  Right.
L:  And they can throw the CEOs in jail.
R:  Well, they've been doing a lot of that.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, Enron and the -- 
L:  This is true.
R:  Some of the other -- the banks have been, ah, you know, a lot of the bank CEOs -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- have been putting -- are you in, ah, north east?
L:  Ah, yes -- well, I'm in North Carolina.
R:  Oh, okay, because I'm in Maryland and we've had a few banks and the bank CEOs that were arrested, and because of ill -- you know illegal activity.
L:  Right.  We've had that problem in the Research Triangle part, um, with some of the companies, um, and, you know, I guess catching them is the hardest part but, you know, if they could take the money and we've -- we've had problems with them dipping into people's retirement funds.
R:  What do you mean we?
L:  Ah, in this area.
R:  Oh.
L:  Not me personally.
R:  Oh.
L:  But in this area of them taking the retirement money and investing it poorly and then, um -- 
R:  Like the banks?
L:  Getting away with it and the -- and the poor people that they just don't have anything left.
R:  Right.
L:  For retirement, um.  The only thing they -- they can do that -- the government they can publicize when people get in trouble and slap fines on them and send them to jail.
R:  How do you fine the people to begin with? How do you --
L:  Well, that's also a problem because unfortunately sometimes people -- the employees are afraid to speak up because something bad will happen to them.
R:  Right.
L:  And there almost needs to be some type of anonymity to the squealers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or a reward, um, if -- if you do see some bad things or should be maybe get a percentage of whatever amount of money that has been done wrongly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I know IBM a long time ago had, and I'm sure they still do, an incentive program if you've come up with a great idea to save money, you get a percentage of how ever much it is that you save the company.
R:  Yes, that's a good idea.
L:  And they could do the same thing with squealers instead of them feeling fearful is if you find something wrong with your company -- 
R:  Yeah, they probably lose their jobs because -- 
L:  They probably do.
R:  Because they would be reporting, like, their boss, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah.
L:  In the long run there should be some type of reward for those who come forward.  I mean, Erin, um, Broderick out in California or Silkwood a long time ago when those -- I think the ladies unfortunately lost their lives when Cher was in that movie.
R:  Mhm.
L:  There should be some type of reward system for those who, um, tell 'cause that's the only way you're going to find out about it is if someone inside telling what happened.
R:  Right.
L:  Um.
R:  Does this affect you directly, um?
L:  As far as these press things?
R:  These scandals, yeah, these -- 
L:  No, no. 
R:  Me either.
L:  I'm in -- in education.
R:  Uh-huh, are you a teacher?
L:  Although they're -- they're cutting back like crazy and trying to get rid of jobs, yet they say we're screaming we need teachers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You can't scream you need teachers and -- and then lay off almost eight hundred of 'em this year.
R:  Mm.
L:  And, ah, in order to have a budget cut, um, but I think also the government as far as for instance, it -- John Edwards running for government they're look- -- I mean, running for President, they're now saying he's getting --
R:  What's his name?
L:  Ah, John Edwards, the young senator.
R:  Uh-huh, oh, I didn't hear.
L:  He's a Democrat trying to run for, ah, President.
R:  From North Carolina?  
L:  He's in his forties from North Carolina.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And now they're saying he, um, has received some money, um, from large companies illegally.
R:  Mm.
L:  And, you know -- 
R:  Yeah, a lot of that happens in politics too, you know.
L:  Right.  It doesn't stop just in business.  It's got to go on to, ah the government.
R:  Right.
L:  Also when the government does wrong --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  They've got to get in trouble as well as the military.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, the military is bad about spending money wrongfully and they have a better way of hiding things than I think companies and governments.  They're even bigger on hush hush. 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  On keeping their secrets. 
R:  You think so?
L:  I think so.
R:  Mhm.  The military? 
L:  I think so with the female -- 
R:  Like, the Department of Defence you mean?
L:  Um, just military in general.  You know, the way they -- they treat the females or, you know, the hazing that they had down at Saluda in South Carolina.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Doing things that to me are illegal, you know, harassing women, um, making them do things that they should not have to do, um, you know, selling themselves trying to move up.
R:  Right.
L:  There's -- there's just got to be a way for someone to squeal but then it's your word against their word.
R:  Right.
L:  And somehow I guess in a court of law it's the only way they can solve the problem.  Have you ever done these things before? 
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  This is my first time too.
R:  Yeah.  I had -- I looked up the topics 'cause I didn't know what kind of topics, you know, they cover.
L:  Right.
R:  So I wanted to see, and this is not one of the ones that was listed but, um, did you look up the topics? 
L:  I -- I get the email and I printed it out and I have not read -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- all the directions.
R:  Yeah, there are about twenty topics or more -- no, more than twenty, I think there are forty topics actually.
L:  Wow.
R:  They range all, you know, all different kinds of politics and smoking and food and all different kinds of things.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, do they tell you when the time's up?
L:  I have no idea.
R:  [LAUGH] I think -- I think they do, but I'm not sure and then you respond to some -- 
L:  Questions afterwards? 
R:  Yeah.  So, you know, I'm not sure how that works either.  This is my first time.  But, um, you know, this whole thing with the scandals, you know, I mean -- 
L:  Well, just because the, um -- 
R:  I think the higher you get, you know, it's so tempting.
L:  It's very tempting but also it seems like the higher you get in if you're more in the public eye you don't get penalized if you're the common person.  If you're the common person they seem to throw the book at you whereas sometimes when you are on a pedestal, they -- they don't.
R:  Well, they -- they are, you know, like I said, they put a lot of these CEOs, they arrested them.  Um, but, you know, to get where they -- where they are, I mean, they had to have a lot of connections and, you know, to get to their position.
L:  Exactly, and sometimes they start off with a lot of good.
R:  Right.
L:  But then unfortunately sometimes they owe someone a favor.
R:  Right.
L:  Which may not be a good favor.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because they got in a position where they're not supposed to be but the bottom line is you've -- you've got to pay for whatever crime as you commit.
R:  Mhm, and, like, I forgot his name but the one in, um, Maryland where I live.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, as bank CEO, I mean, he meant to do right.
L:  Right.
R:  You now, he was investing people's money but he made a poor choice.
L:  Right.
R:  In investing the money so they, you know, they're saying that he did it, you know, intentionally and that he -- but I mean he really intended to invest people, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- people's money in the right thing.  He made a poor choice and he lost a lot of money for people.  So is that something he should be arrested for?  You know, if he made a poor choice but his intentions were good? 
L:  Right.  Well, actually he's not going to harm society by being on the street.
R:  Right.
L:  But there has to be some type of -- 
R:  But he -- 
L:  Penalty.
R:  Right, but he lost a lot -- I mean, maybe he can just, you know, repay them but how do you repay -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I mean, how do you repay millions of dollars?  So, um, no, a lot of questions, you know. 
L:  Well, I guess if one way to keep things from going sour is usually, and I guess here it is the CEO, you -- you have to have a board that's managing the CEO and -- and questioning and approving whatever it is they do so that the CEO does not get in a position like that.
R:  Right, where he has so much power.
L:  Right, so usually even a -- even a CEO in some companies have a board.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That watch -- I mean, it's like the President.
R:  I was just going to say that, yes.
L:  He can't do anything --
R:  But see the -- 
L:  -- without some approval.
R:  But see, the President, look what he's done with Iraq.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, he didn't really have a lot of -- support and he did it anyway.
L:  This is true.
R:  And that's what a lot of the people are complaining about, you know, that he went ahead without much, you know, he had, like, Colin Powell behind him, you know, but he didn't really have everybody's -- even a majority of support and he went ahead with Iraq.  That's another topic. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, on itself.
R:  Yeah. Anyway --
L:  Who knows -- who knows what hit they're really doing.
R:  I know.
L:  Even though you can see them live and -- and here again even the -- the, um, the media's interpreting things the way they want to see it or want you to see it.
R:  Right.
L:  Versus what maybe is really actually happening.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um.
R:  Well, I think the media has to have a limit in what they can report during time of war 'cause it can be dangerous to report too much.
L:  This is true.
R:  And we have a -- a problem with that -- with we report too much, you know, like and with Afghanistan and with Iraq.
