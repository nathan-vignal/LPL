R:  Hi, my name's Joe. 
L:  Hi, my name's Isabelle.
R:  Hi Isabelle.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are ya? 
L:  Good, how are you? 
R:  I'm good.  So we're t- -- we're suppose to talk about family and what it means to us. 
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  So 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- why don't you tell me what you -- what family means to you.  Just -- I mean quickly you know. 
L:  Um, I guess family means people you can count on.  People, um, that you, um, have secrets with -- have um, traditions with, um, -- basically I -- I think a lot of it has to do with, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- family tradition. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know getting together.
R:  I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think --
L:  So --
R:  -- I think you're right there.  I mean, I think that's good.  [NOISE] You know. [NOISE] I think it's kind of like [NOISE] what you're saying and people have like -- the people you have a close connection with.  That you can't explain to any one else. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Does that make any sense? 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [COUGH] So this is kinda nervous.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  As I am. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's strange.  But um, -- an- -- and I guess it's also just, um, people you share things with, you know. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Um, just your intimate secrets, or quirks, or, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or things like that.
R:  Do you have -- 
L:  People you grow up with.
R:  -- a big family?
L:  Excuse me. 
R:  Do --
L:  Uh.
R:  You have a big family? 
L:  Uh, Yeah. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah, uh, -- we're Hispanic too. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So --
R:  So are you -- are you close? 
L:  Yeah, we're pretty close.  And um, yeah -- even if we live in other -- different states we're probably on the phone like every day. [LAUGH]
R:  Really.  That's cool, cause see my family's not like that.  We're [NOISE] you know -- we're just kinda clannish -- we don't talk like --
L:  Do your own thing? 
R:  Like I don't -- there's one uncle of mine.  We're just don't talk to him, just because -- I don't know -- [LAUGH] you know. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And it's kinda --
L:  Oh, no, there is those, you know distant uncles, aunts, and cousins that you kinda hear about once a year. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [LAUGH] But, um, -- [PAUSE] yeah. [LAUGH] This is strange, how long is it going to record us?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You think --
L:  Um, --
R:  Do you think that families are getting like better, as we're getting along in time -- or do you think they're getting worse? 
L:  God, I think it does, um, -- I don't think there's any better --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or worse, I just think that it it's, um, um, in particular how your family is.  I mean I think it's individual like you can't -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --I think -- I don't think there's a way of stereo typing, or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or any thing like that. 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. 
L:  I just think it's a one on one basis.  You know. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Just, just um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know people usually, um, keep up with their family traditions for the most part, unless they break the cycle. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So.
R:  Well -- 
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- see I, see I was talking about like -- like how -- I think personally a lot of the problems in this world are because of the break down of peoples' family structure, you know. 
L:  I mean I guess now a days people are more likely to -- as the generations go by more likely to get up and go and actually move. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Out of city -- out of the state. 
R:  Yeah.  [inaudible]
L:  Out of country.  Whereas before people really, you know.  My uncle and my -- and his mother -- my grand mother were neighbors for [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know after he was all grown up and married with kids, they were still neighbors. 
R:  My sister lives like two doors away from my parents. 
L:  Yeah.  So I mean there's -- but there's less of that I think. 
R:  Oh, I -- I definitely think so. 
L:  You know, and then with the computer, and the internet, and e-mail and --
R:  And p- -- I think people --
L:  -- telephone.
R:  -- are busier too so they don't have as -- seems like they don't have much time for family. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  You know, like your family if we're gonna do something together we kind of have to like schedule it in advance, and --
L:  Right.  And like just women having children you know --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- having a family, wait later and later cause they want to be -- be educated, and want to be, you know. 
R:  Yeah exactly. 
L:  Early thirties -- where as before, you know, you get married when you're eighteen, and you have a kid nine months later.  [LAUGH]
R:  See I think that's -- I think that's a good thing but that's because my mum, --
L:  I think it is a good thing
R:  My mum, was in her thirties when she had me, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so was my father, and I think they did like -- I think my parents did a good job, so --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But that's because they're older -- like I have an older sister, she's eleven years older 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and with her they kind of didn't know what they were doing and they were young and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then they had me it was like -- oh, we know how to do this.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  And I think that on the most part people are probably having smaller families which is a good thing too.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Um, --
R:  Do you have --
L:  At least in the developed countries -- I am talking about here --
R:  Yeah.
L:  --in the United States, which is a good thing, you know, um, --
R:  Do you have a big family? 
L:  I'm an only child. 
R:  You are. 
L:  I have a big family as far as like first cousins and --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- things like that.  But I'm an only child. 
R:  Really? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  What was that like? 
L:  Um, it's good in a way.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  When you see siblings that don't get along, but when you see siblings that do get along you kind of wish that you had that connection. 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You know.
R:  I kinda -- I kinda know what you're talking about, because -- I mean I'm not on only child, but my sisters so much more older than me -- like eleven -- she was eleven when I was born, so --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- it's kind of like two different worlds, and we're not really that close now. 
L:  Right -- right. 
R:  Because you know when I was -- when I want today play she'd be like wanting to go and date boys, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like to.  She had a different mind --
L:  Right, and at that age you're like girls have cooties. 
R:  Yeah exactly. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So I -- I mean I- I kind of understand what you're talking about. 
L:  Yeah, I get it cause I have a little cousin, um, who all her sisters are in their twenties, an- and she's fourteen, and it's almost like she's really like an only child. 
R:  Yeah.  It's -- that's kind of the way how I feel -- Like my roommate,  him and his brother are real close, and they're like a year apart so they're like --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- you know they are competitive, and they're --
L:  Right. 
R:  [inaudible]
L:  So, when I see that I'm like, yeah I wish I had a sibling. 
R:  Yeah, you kind of feel like you know like wouldn't it be cool to just have like a brother or sister [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Which is horrible, because I have a sister, but we're just not very close. 
L:  Not that close. [inaudible]
R:  We're closer now though because --
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah, [inaudible] age doesn't matter as much. 
R:  Yeah we have more things in common now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- than let's ride bikes, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Uh, is this your first call -- or --
L:  This is. 
R:  It is -- me too. 
L:  Yeah this is my first call. 
R:  Yeah, I signed up earlier this week. 
L:  I signed up yesterday. 
R:  Did you? 
L:  Yes
R:  Wow that was fast.  I think I signed up Tuesday.  This is crazy -- so where do you live? 
L:  I'm, um, currently living in Miami. 
R:  Really? 
L:  Mhm. That's where I grew up.  So I'm with family. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  See my husband's in Iraq, so --
R:  Oh, he is. 
L:  -- I moved to Miami to be close to my family, and his family --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- cause both of our families are from Miami.  So, yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's -- I guess [LAUGH] into your conversation hu? 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I did move here to be closer to family.
R:  There you go. 
L:  So I wouldn't be, you know, going through this all by myself. 
R:  Exactly. 
L:  So --
R:  So family is a good thing we've come up with.
L:  Yeah, it's pretty important. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  You know. 
R:  It is very.  
L:  I just -- I mean I'm not -- we don't have kids or any thing, but I know that whenever we do -- I kinda of wanna be close --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Especially my mum, and --
R:  Yeah, cause --
L:  I don't know -- and like when my cousins have kids --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know to have them grow up together would be important. 
R:  Yeah, definitely. 
L:  Yeah.  So, uh, where do you live? 
R:  I live in Philadelphia. 
L:  Where? 
R:  Philadelphia. 
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  Um, I grew up -- I am actually like in the suburbs now, but I grew up in Philadelphia, then we moved out to the suburbs, and, [SIGH] you know. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I like Philadelphia, but it is a backward city sometimes. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  We don't have a very good image in the media overall.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But --
L:  Well Miami is a little trendy sometimes.  So --
R:  Yeah.  See when I think of Miami I think of like, flamingos, and --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Bikinis.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Cuban's. 
R:  Yep.  [SIGH] Oh, Boy.  I don't feel as nervous now. 
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Do you? 
L:  No.
R:  No.
L:  No, but it sure is long -- you are suppose today talk about family this whole time? 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [LAUGH] Um.
R:  I read a thing and it said, uh, talk for like eight minutes about the subject, and then, I don't know, two minutes to BS I guess. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Hope I didn't run over.  [LAUGH] But we did come up with families a good thing, so --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  So anybody, who's going to be listening to this, we agree. 
L:  We agree. 
R:  Families [inaudible] --
L:  A good thing. 
R:  And we like families.
L:  Be close, and have traditions.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you have any traditions in your family? 
R:  [SIGH] My mum, every, uh, Christmas Eve she burns these candles in the sink --what are they called.  They're, uh, [inaudible] candles. 
L:  Oh.
R:  And supposedly -- like she burns them in the sink so they don't catch any thing on fire, but if you leave them burning overnight, and it gives your whole family good luck for the whole year. 
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  And you know, we're Irish so -- so I guess that's an Irish thing that we brought over [LAUGH] somewhere --
L:  Okay.
R:  And like I don't know at -- when I was a kid I use today make fun of her for -- but now I thing I'm going to start doing it, [LAUGH] you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah you kind of carry little things along. 
R:  Cause there's like -- you don't know if it works, but what if it does? 
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  And even if it doesn't it's kind of something cool to pass on. 
R:  Yeah.  It's traditional, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like your grandma used to do this
L:  Right. 
R:  And grandma's grandma used today do this --
L:  Right
R:  So yeah,
L:  Yeah. 
R:  That is cool about family how you can just hand things down through generations. 
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
