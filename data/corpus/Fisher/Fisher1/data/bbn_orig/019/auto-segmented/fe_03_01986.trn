PERSONALLY JUST BECAUSE OF THE STOCK MARKET AND  (fe_03_01986-A-0021)
YOU KNOW PERSONAL FINANCES THAT ACTUALLY BUT IT HURTS IT HURTS EVERY PERSON BECAUSE  (fe_03_01986-A-0022)
IF YOU'RE IF THEY'RE DOING ILLEGAL THINGS THAT CAUSES THE STOCK MARKET PEOPLE LOSE THEIR JOBS AND DETROIT IS YOU KNOW A PRIME EXAMPLE BECAUSE YOU GUYS HAVE ALL THE AH  (fe_03_01986-A-0023)
AUTO OUT THERE  (fe_03_01986-A-0024)
YEAH SEE WE DON'T HAVE WE DID HAVE U._S. STEEL HERE NOW THE ONLY REALLY BIG EMPLOYER WE HAVE IS U._S. AIR AND THEY'RE PULLING ALL KINDS OF REALLY COOL THINGS WITH YOU KNOW THE BECAUSE OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWO  (fe_03_01986-A-0025)
AND THE WORLD TRADE CENTRE THEY'RE SAYING WELL TRAVEL IS BAD AND WE'RE ONE OF THEIR HUBS THEIR MAJOR HUBS AND ALL THEY WANT TO PULL OUT OF THEIR CONTRACT  (fe_03_01986-A-0026)
WITH THE PITTSBURGH NAT- INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT  (fe_03_01986-A-0027)
NO THEY DON'T NO IT SEEMS LIKE THAT THEY CAN  (fe_03_01986-A-0028)
WE HAVE WESTINGHOUSE HERE AND IT SEEMS LIKE THEY THE PEOPLE THAT ARE THE HEAD OF THIS GO IN TAKE THEIR BONUSES AND LEAVE AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY'RE RAPING THE COUNT- THE COMPANY  (fe_03_01986-A-0029)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01986-A-0030)
THAT'S THAT'S EXACTLY THE WAY IT IS  (fe_03_01986-A-0031)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01986-A-0032)
NO RIGHT YEAH  (fe_03_01986-A-0033)
YEAH  (fe_03_01986-A-0034)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01986-A-0035)
AND THEY'RE NOT AND THERE ISN'T ANY ACCOUNTABILITY  (fe_03_01986-A-0036)
YEAH AND SO AND THEN THEY WALK AWAY AND THEY'RE CLEAR AND FREE AND THEY JUST GO TO ANOTHER COMPANY YEAH  (fe_03_01986-A-0037)
I DON'T THINK SO I THINK NO I THINK BECAUSE I THINK THOSE PEOPLE ARE AT THE SAME LEVEL AND PROBABLY DOING THE SAME TYPE OF THING AND BECAUSE ONE FOR EXAMPLE WESTINGHOUSE WAS MIKE EISNER WHO WAS AH DISNEY  (fe_03_01986-A-0038)
AND SO HE WAS A DISNEY AND THEN HE MOVED TO WESTINGHOUSE AND WESTINGHOUSE THEN WAS BOUGHT OUT BY C._B._S. AND THEN C._B._S. LIKE PULLED OUT OF PITTSBURGH 'CAUSE MY HUSBAND WORKS FOR THEM AND YOU KNOW HE WAS FORCED INTO AN EARLY RETIREMENT  (fe_03_01986-A-0039)
AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT HE WAS ONLY FIFTY FIVE  (fe_03_01986-A-0040)
BUT YOU KNOW WE WERE LUCKY HE'S BEEN GIVEN A VERY SMALL PENSION AND YOU KNOW OUR BENEFITS ARE COVERED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT  (fe_03_01986-A-0041)
BUT YOU KNOW AND HE WAS ABLE TO GET ANOTHER JOB SO WE'RE FINE WE LANDED ON OUR FEET BUT OTHER PEOPLE WEREN'T  (fe_03_01986-A-0042)
YOU KNOW AND SO AND NOW MICHAEL EISNER HAS GONE AND HE'S SOMEWHERE ELSE  (fe_03_01986-A-0043)
AND SO IT YOU KNOW AND HE'LL BE DOING THE SAME THING TO ANOTHER COMPANY  (fe_03_01986-A-0044)
AND I THINK THAT JUST ISN'T  (fe_03_01986-A-0045)
NO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT ETHICAL AND I  (fe_03_01986-A-0046)
I THINK SO  (fe_03_01986-A-0047)
WE HAVE  (fe_03_01986-A-0048)
UM AT WORK WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL  (fe_03_01986-A-0049)
AN ADVISORY BOARD WHICH IS MADE UP OF  (fe_03_01986-A-0050)
BIG EXECUTIVES FROM DIFFERENT COMPANIES  (fe_03_01986-A-0051)
AND THEY COME IN AND SPEND THREE DAYS WITH US  (fe_03_01986-A-0052)
AND THEY GO THROUGH EVERYTHING  (fe_03_01986-A-0053)
THEY GO THROUGH YOUR BOOKS THEY TALK TO EMPLOYEES UM YOU KNOW AND YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH THEM AND THEY LOOK TO SEE HOW MANY MINORITIES YOU'VE HIRED AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR BUDGET IS AND I THINK MAYBE  (fe_03_01986-A-0054)
COMPANIES A LOT OF OTHER COMPANIES SHOULD DO THIS AND THEN THEY GO AND THEY  (fe_03_01986-A-0055)
TAKE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE  (fe_03_01986-A-0056)
AND THEY PUT THIS INTO A REPORT AND THEY TURN THIS OVER TO OUR C._E._O. AND THEY COME IN  (fe_03_01986-A-0057)
ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS  (fe_03_01986-A-0058)
AND SO EVEN THOUGH THREE YEARS IS A LONG TIME BETWEEN  (fe_03_01986-A-0059)
IT KIND OF MAKES THINGS  (fe_03_01986-A-0060)
A LITTLE MORE HONEST  (fe_03_01986-A-0061)
UM NO I DON'T THINK IT IS AND OUR OUR PEOPLE OUR MANAGEMENT PEOPLE ONLY GET A FIVE YEAR CONTRACT  (fe_03_01986-A-0062)
SO AFTER FIVE YEARS THE HEAD OF OUR DEPARTMENT  (fe_03_01986-A-0063)
IS HE CAN RENEW HIS CONTRACT IF OTHER PEOPLE VOTE FOR HIM TO RENEW HIS CONTRACT OTHERWISE HE'S OUT  (fe_03_01986-A-0064)
SO IF HE'S NOT DOING A GOOD JOB IN FIVE YEARS YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01986-A-0065)
THEY HAVE THE OPTION AND I'VE BEEN THERE  (fe_03_01986-A-0066)
TWELVE YEARS FOURTEEN YEARS AND I HAVE BEEN THROUGH ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE DEPARTMENT HEADS  (fe_03_01986-A-0067)
BECAUSE SOME OF THEM HAVE STEPPED ON AND YOU KNOW AND SOME OF THEM THEIR CONTRACTS JUST HAVEN'T BEEN RENEWED  (fe_03_01986-A-0068)
AND SO MAYBE OTHER COMPANIES SHOULD LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU GET A FIVE YEAR CONTRACT THERE ARE NO BONUSES UNLESS  (fe_03_01986-A-0069)
STOCKHOLDERS AND YOU KNOW EMPLOYEES ARE GETTING THEIR  (fe_03_01986-A-0070)
WHAT THEY NEED  (fe_03_01986-A-0071)
MHM  (fe_03_01986-A-0072)
YEAH  (fe_03_01986-A-0073)
OH  (fe_03_01986-A-0074)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01986-A-0075)
RIGHT I THINK SO TOO I MEAN THAT'S WHY THE STEEL INDUSTRY ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THE STEEL INDUSTRY FAILED SO MISERABLY IN PITTSBURGH  (fe_03_01986-A-0076)
BECAUSE I MEAN WE WERE STEEL  (fe_03_01986-A-0077)
AND YOU KNOW IT WAS JUST ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER AND NOW THE LATEST ONE IS AND THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM L._T._V. STEEL JUST SAID WELL OUR RETIREES WE CAN'T AFFORD BENEFITS FOR THEM ANY MORE OH WELL  (fe_03_01986-A-0078)
AND SO NOW ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS IN THE MILL  (fe_03_01986-A-0079)
YOU KNOW NOW HAVE NO  (fe_03_01986-A-0080)

OH YES YEAH THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_01986-A-0082)
THAT'S YEAH YEAH  (fe_03_01986-A-0084)
SO I THINK THERE HAS TO BE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY IN WHETHER IT'S AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL OR A COMPANY  (fe_03_01986-A-0085)
