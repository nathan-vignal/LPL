THAT'S GOOD  (fe_03_01903-A-0079)
MHM  (fe_03_01903-A-0080)
MHM  (fe_03_01903-A-0081)

HI MY NAME IS DEBORAH  (fe_03_01903-B-0001)
HI CINDY  (fe_03_01903-B-0002)
FINE  (fe_03_01903-B-0003)
UM  (fe_03_01903-B-0004)
I GUESS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE WORD FAMILY MEANS TO ME  (fe_03_01903-B-0005)
WELL WHAT IT MEANS TO ME IS SOMEBODY WHO IS GOING TO ACCEPT ME  (fe_03_01903-B-0006)
JUST LIKE I AM WHEN I'M BEING PERFECT OR WHEN I'M BEING IMPERFECT  (fe_03_01903-B-0007)
WHEN I'M BEING  (fe_03_01903-B-0008)
CRAZY AND OBSESSED  (fe_03_01903-B-0009)
OR WHEN I'M BEING  (fe_03_01903-B-0010)
BEAUTIFUL AND RELATED AND SELFLESSLY LOVING [NOISE]  (fe_03_01903-B-0011)
ANOTHER THING THAT FAMILY MEANS TO ME IS SOMEBODY WHO ISN'T GOING TO LEAVE ME  (fe_03_01903-B-0012)
JUST BECAUSE  (fe_03_01903-B-0013)
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT ME THAT THEY DON'T LIKE  (fe_03_01903-B-0014)
IN OTHER WORDS  (fe_03_01903-B-0015)
NOT LIKE A HUSBAND AND UM AND WIFE SOMETIMES FEEL THAT  (fe_03_01903-B-0016)
IF THEY HAVE INCOMPATIBILITY THEY DON'T NEED TO STAY MARRIED AND FULFIL THEIR COMMITMENT TO ME WHAT A FAMILY MEANS  (fe_03_01903-B-0017)
EVEN A HUSBAND AND WIFE  (fe_03_01903-B-0018)
FAMILY  (fe_03_01903-B-0019)
THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF WHAT THE WORD FAMILY MEANS TO ME  (fe_03_01903-B-0020)
HAS TO DO WITH STICKING AROUND EVEN IN THE HARD TIMES BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T STICK AROUND IN THE HARD TIMES HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE THERE TO SEE THE GLORIOUS WONDERFUL TIMES  (fe_03_01903-B-0021)
THAT'S WHAT FAMILY MEANS TO ME  (fe_03_01903-B-0022)
OH  (fe_03_01903-B-0023)
IT'S TRUE  (fe_03_01903-B-0024)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01903-B-0026)
AND CHURCH FAMILY AND THERE'S ALL KINDS OF FAMILIES I GUESS YEAH  (fe_03_01903-B-0028)
IS THERE A COMMONALITY TO WHAT THE WORD FAMILY MEANS TO TO YOU [NOISE] EVEN IF THE FAMILIES LOOK DIFFERENT OR ACT DIFFERENTLY FOR EACH OTHER  (fe_03_01903-B-0029)
MHM  (fe_03_01903-B-0030)
MHM  (fe_03_01903-B-0031)
MHM  (fe_03_01903-B-0032)
SO ACTUALLY WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING IS TWO THINGS  (fe_03_01903-B-0033)
FAMILY MEANS AVAILABILITY  (fe_03_01903-B-0034)
AND FAMILY MEANS  (fe_03_01903-B-0035)
WE MAY NOT TOUCH EACH OTHER'S LIVES IN A DIRECT WAY  (fe_03_01903-B-0036)
UM ON A CERTAIN LEVEL OF INTIMACY ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A PLACE IN MY HEART THAT IS LASTING AND I'LL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR YOU  (fe_03_01903-B-0037)
OH  (fe_03_01903-B-0038)

ONE OF MY CO WORKERS TALKING ABOUT WH- FAMILY AND WHAT FAMILY MEANS [NOISE] HER MO- SHE GETS UM TO LIVE CLOSE TO HER MOM  (fe_03_01903-B-0051)
[NOISE] AND SO THEY MAKE PLANS  (fe_03_01903-B-0052)
AND THEY DO STUFF TOGETHER  (fe_03_01903-B-0053)
I DON'T FIRST OF ALL MY MOM DOESN'T LIVE CLOSE AND SECOND OF ALL I'M NOT SURE THAT I COULD HANDLE  (fe_03_01903-B-0054)
HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS HAVING A WHOLE DAY WITH MY MOM LIKE YOU KNOW CHERYL DOES  (fe_03_01903-B-0055)
[LAUGHTER] SO I JUST REALLY RESPECT AND HONOR AND I JUST APPRECIATE ON HER BEHALF THAT SHE CAN HAVE THAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP  (fe_03_01903-B-0056)
OH  (fe_03_01903-B-0057)
OH  (fe_03_01903-B-0059)

NO NO NOT TWENTY YEARS EIGHTEEN YEAH I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT JUST THE OTHER DAY EIGHTEEN  (fe_03_01903-B-0069)
AND I KNOW  (fe_03_01903-B-0070)
I I WILL NEVER FORGET THE REASON THAT I CHOSE TO MARRY HIM AND IT WAS BECAUSE HE LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE  (fe_03_01903-B-0071)
HE LIVED HE LOVED AND HONORED HIS MOTHER ESPECIALLY AND HE LIKED ALL OF HIS FAMILY HIS FAMILY GETS TOGETHER STILL  (fe_03_01903-B-0072)
FOR EVERY HOLIDAY BIRTHDAYS  (fe_03_01903-B-0073)
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING  (fe_03_01903-B-0074)
AND I HAD NEVER HAD THAT  (fe_03_01903-B-0075)
UM  (fe_03_01903-B-0076)
WELL I NEVER LIVED AT HOME AGAIN AFTER I WAS THIRTEEN  (fe_03_01903-B-0077)
BUT WHAT I REALLY LIKED  (fe_03_01903-B-0078)
ABOUT HIS FAMILY IS THAT THEY JUST IT WAS LIKE THEY HELD OPEN THEIR ARMS TO ME  (fe_03_01903-B-0079)
AND THEY GAVE ME A DIFFERENT UM UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT FAMILY COULD BE FOR ONE ANOTHER  (fe_03_01903-B-0080)
'CAUSE EVEN AFTER HE AND I  (fe_03_01903-B-0081)
SEPARATED AND THEN DIVORCED FIVE YEARS LATER  (fe_03_01903-B-0082)
THEY MADE IT REALLY CLEAR THAT MY DAUGHTER  (fe_03_01903-B-0083)
YOU KNOW OUR DAUGHTER THE ONE THAT WE HAD CREATED TOGETHER AND I WERE ALWAYS WELCOME AND NOT ONLY THAT THEY ALMOST LIKE INSISTED THAT WE CONTINUE TO COME AND BE A PART OF THEIR FAMILY  (fe_03_01903-B-0084)
LIKE FOR FAMILY GATHERINGS AND EVERYTHING  (fe_03_01903-B-0085)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_01903-B-0086)
YEAH  (fe_03_01903-B-0087)
BECAUSE I NEVER HAD THAT EXPERIENCE  (fe_03_01903-B-0088)
UM  (fe_03_01903-B-0089)
[LAUGHTER] IF IT'S IF I KEEP IT REALLY SHORT AND BRIEF [LAUGHTER] AND IT PERTAINS ON A VERY SMALL LEVEL WITH  (fe_03_01903-B-0090)
ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER  (fe_03_01903-B-0091)
NOW THE OTHER THING THAT HE REALLY WILL TALK ABOUT IS WHAT HE'S PASSIONATE ABOUT WHICH IS CARS [NOISE] TAKING CARE OF CARS EVERYTHING ABOUT CARS  (fe_03_01903-B-0092)
SO IF IT'S ABOUT THAT NOW WE COULD HAVE A CONVERSATION  (fe_03_01903-B-0093)
BUT NOTHING PERSONAL  (fe_03_01903-B-0094)
THAT WAS THE ONE WEIRD THING I MEAN HERE IS THIS  (fe_03_01903-B-0095)
HE LOVES AND ADORES HIS FAMILY THEIR FAMILY IS SO WONDERFUL TOGETHER BUT YET THERE'S NO  (fe_03_01903-B-0096)
SOULFUL INTIMACY  (fe_03_01903-B-0097)

BUT  (fe_03_01903-B-0099)
DON'T TOUCH LIKE ON TO SOULFUL  (fe_03_01903-B-0100)
LEVELS OF INTIMACY  (fe_03_01903-B-0101)

FOR FOR HIM TO BE WILLING TO MAKE CHANGES IN HIS LIFE SO THAT HE COULD BE AVAILABLE TO HER AND HAVE A FRIENDSHIP AND HAVE DO THE FATHER THING  (fe_03_01903-B-0104)
AND SHE MOVED DOWN THERE TO LIVE CLOSE TO HIM NOW  (fe_03_01903-B-0105)

MHM  (fe_03_01903-B-0108)

TO HONOR THE CONCEPT THAT I HAD LEARNED ABOUT WHAT FAMILY COULD BE  (fe_03_01903-B-0110)
AND TO NOT CREATE  (fe_03_01903-B-0111)
OR NOT CLOSE ANY DOORS BECAUSE OF  (fe_03_01903-B-0112)
SOMETHING THAT WAS BETWEEN HE AND I AND HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HER  (fe_03_01903-B-0113)
IT ACTUALLY HELPED ME TO FORGIVE IT ACTUALLY TAUGHT ME NOW THAT I'M THINKING ABOUT IT IT ACTUALLY TAUGHT ME A REALLY IMPORTANT LESSON ABOUT  (fe_03_01903-B-0114)
WHAT FAMILY COULD BE TOO  (fe_03_01903-B-0115)
WE COULD TOTALLY NOT EVEN GET ALONG BUT WE CAN FIND A WAY  (fe_03_01903-B-0116)
TO GET ALONG BECAUSE WE HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO BE  (fe_03_01903-B-0117)
