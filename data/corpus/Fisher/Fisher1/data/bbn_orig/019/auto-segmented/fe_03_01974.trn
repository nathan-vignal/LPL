OH OKAY I'M ACTUALLY IN UM GEORGIA  (fe_03_01974-B-0005)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01974-B-0006)
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT AH THE QUESTION  (fe_03_01974-B-0007)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01974-B-0008)
WELL I I THINK THEY MEAN NOT ONLY JUST THE COMPANY THAT YOU WORK FOR BUT  (fe_03_01974-B-0009)
JUST IN THE OVERALL IN THE ENVIRONMENT THE CORPORATE ENVIRONMENT WITHIN THE UNITED STATES  (fe_03_01974-B-0010)
YOU KNOW UM IN LIGHT OF ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED RECENTLY WITH ENRON WITH M._C._I. MARTHA STEWART AND SOME OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN SOME MAJOR CORPORATE SCANDALS I PERSONALLY THINK THAT  (fe_03_01974-B-0011)
YOU KNOW THESE PEOPLE SHOULD BE PROSECUTED I BELIEVE THAT  (fe_03_01974-B-0012)
THEY SHOULD BE AH PUT IN JAIL I THINK THEY KEY SHOULD BE THROWN AWAY AND I HAVE VERY LITTLE TOLERANCE FOR PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF MONEY  (fe_03_01974-B-0013)
AND THEY'RE CLAMORING CONSTANTLY TO GET MORE YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ALREADY WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING TRYING TO PAY THE BILLS TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON OR YOU KNOW TRYING TO AH THESE PEOPLE  (fe_03_01974-B-0014)
STRUGGLING TO MAYBE TO TRY TO STAY IN THEIR MILLION DOLLAR HOMES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR AND THEY'RE NOT EVEN STRUGGLING TO DO THAT BUT  (fe_03_01974-B-0015)
YOU KNOW TO ME IT'S JUST TOTALLY DIFFERENT  (fe_03_01974-B-0016)
THAN IF YOU HAD A SITUATION WHERE MAYBE SAY YOU HAD A A SICK CHILD AND YOU REALLY NEEDED SOME MONEY TO PAY FOR HIS OPERATION TO KEEP THE CHILD ALIVE YOU KNOW TO ME THAT WOULD BE NOT TO SAY THAT IT WOULD BE RIGHT TO STEAL  (fe_03_01974-B-0017)
BUT I COULD UNDERSTAND THAT A LITTLE BIT BETTER  (fe_03_01974-B-0018)
YOU KNOW BUT I JUST HAVE VERY LITTLE TOLERANCE FOR IT AND I THINK THAT IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE LEAST ARE THE ONES WHO ARE PENALIZED THE MOST  (fe_03_01974-B-0019)
FOR DOING CRIMES THAT ARE  (fe_03_01974-B-0020)
MUCH LESS SERIOUS IN MY MIND  (fe_03_01974-B-0021)
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION  (fe_03_01974-B-0022)
AND AND ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT THAT I'VE SEEN AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SEEN AS WELL I'VE CERTAINLY SEEN IT IN THE MEDIA  (fe_03_01974-B-0023)
IS EVERY TIME I I LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPER OR LOOK AT ON THE INTERNET OR WATCH T._V. I HEAR SOMETHING ABOUT CORPORATE EXECUTIVES GETTING THESE HUGE BONUSES  (fe_03_01974-B-0024)
YOU KNOW AH [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01974-B-0025)
I THINK THE MONEY SHOULD BE MORE PERHAPS MORE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED TO THE EMPLOYEES AND THEY SHOULD SHARE IN THE PROFITS AS WELL IF  (fe_03_01974-B-0026)
YEAH IF IF THEY CAN SOMEBODY CAN GO AND SERVE AS SEAT PRESIDENT AND C._E._O. OF A MAJOR CORPORATION FOR TWO YEARS  (fe_03_01974-B-0028)
AND IN ORDER TO GET RID OF HIM OR HER AS THE CASE MAY BE  (fe_03_01974-B-0029)
YOU'VE GOTTA PAY THEM USUALLY THEY EVEN HAVE A CONTRACT OR SOME TYPE OF AGREEMENT WHERE YOU YOU PAY THEM DEARLY  (fe_03_01974-B-0030)
TO LET THEM GO I MEAN SOMEBODY I THINK THE OTHER DAY I WAS READING THAT SOME THERE WERE SOME EXECUTIVES WHO RECEIVE THESE HUGE WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT JUST THE  (fe_03_01974-B-0031)
WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED FROM CORPORATIONS AND YOU THINK ABOUT THAT IN COMPARISON WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE WITH PEOPLE LIKE I'M ASSUMING YOU AND ME YOU KNOW WHO WHO MAYBE WORKING FOR A CORPORATION IF THEY LET US GO THEY MIGHT GIVE YOU  (fe_03_01974-B-0033)
THREE MONTHS' SALARY  (fe_03_01974-B-0034)
YEAH AND  (fe_03_01974-B-0036)
YEAH AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE LET GO UNTIL YOU KNOW PEOPLE SHOW UP FOR WORK YOU KNOW I HAVE A FRIEND THAT WORKS FOR COCA-COLA AND  (fe_03_01974-B-0038)
HE SHOWED UP FOR WORK NOW HE WASN'T LAID OFF BUT HE WAS TELLING ME THAT HE SHOWED UP FOR WORK AND YOU KNOW THE ANNOUNCED THAT THERE WERE GOING TO BE FIVE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL JOBS THAT WERE GONNA BE REDUCED OR SEMINATED  (fe_03_01974-B-0039)
AND HE SHOWED UP FOR WORK ONE DAY AND UM THEY CALLED EVERYBODY AND HE SAID ALL OF HIS THE PEOPLE IN THE DEPARTMENT WHERE HE WORKS  (fe_03_01974-B-0040)
AND EITHER THE PEOPLE  (fe_03_01974-B-0041)
AH REMAINED ON WITH COCA-COLA OR WERE GIVEN RAISES I MEAN OR WERE LET GO RIGHT THERE ON THE SPOT AND THEY WERE TOLD TO GO AND CLEAN OUT THEIR DESK AND THEY WERE DISMISSED AND THEY GOT YOU KNOW MAYBE A COUPLE OF MONTHS' SEVERANCE PAY  (fe_03_01974-B-0042)
UM YOU KNOW JUST A VERY BASIC SEVERANCE PACKAGE  (fe_03_01974-B-0043)
YEAH THAT'S I MEAN THAT THAT'S A QUESTION THAT REMAINS TO BE ANSWERED  (fe_03_01974-B-0046)
OH YEAH  (fe_03_01974-B-0047)
RESURFACE  (fe_03_01974-B-0048)
[LAUGHTER] I THINK THAT'S A GOOD POINT I I THINK THAT MAY BE ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM YOU KNOW ONLY THING IS IF IF GENERALLY IF YOU'RE WORKING AND IF YOU'RE IN MANAGEMENT  (fe_03_01974-B-0049)
TYPICALLY  (fe_03_01974-B-0050)
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO ORGANIZE  (fe_03_01974-B-0051)
A UNION I MEAN THERE ARE NO UNIONS IN MANAGEMENT I MEAN YOU  (fe_03_01974-B-0052)
YOU'RE JUST KIND OF ON YOUR OWN  (fe_03_01974-B-0053)
WELL NO WELL WHAT I MEAN THOUGH WAS THE LOWER MANAGEMENT I WAS SPEAKING OF MORE  (fe_03_01974-B-0054)
YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF LOWER AND MIDDLE MANAGERS WHO ARE NOT REALLY DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THOSE THINGS WHO ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THE SCANDALS LIKE THE I'M  (fe_03_01974-B-0055)
SPEAKING OF  (fe_03_01974-B-0056)
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING ALL THE DIRT ARE GENERALLY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE UPPER UPPER MANAGEMENT  (fe_03_01974-B-0057)
THE RIGHT THE PRESIDENT AND RIGHT UNDER HIM HIS ENTOURAGE  (fe_03_01974-B-0058)
SO  (fe_03_01974-B-0059)
OH YEAH THAT THAT'S TRUE I MEAN YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01974-B-0060)
AND THAT'S KIND OF YOU KNOW PARDON MY SEXISM [LAUGHTER] BUT I MEAN BUT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE OF OF CORPORATE EXECUTIVES IN AMERICA TODAY STILL ARE MALE AND THAT'S WHY  (fe_03_01974-B-0061)
I'M  (fe_03_01974-B-0062)
YEAH BUT YOU KNOW UM WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY THOUGH IS THAT I WHAT WAS THE SECOND QUESTION IT WAS HOW CAN WE  (fe_03_01974-B-0063)
RESOLVE THAT AND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT YOU SUGGESTED IS THE UNIONS I THINK BY SENDING THEM TO JAIL  (fe_03_01974-B-0064)
YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER] BY PROSECUTING AH PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO ARE GUILTY OF BEING INVOLVED IN CORPORATE SCANDALS  (fe_03_01974-B-0065)
