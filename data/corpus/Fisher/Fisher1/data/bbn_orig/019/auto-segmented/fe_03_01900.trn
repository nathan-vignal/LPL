FINE THANKS  (fe_03_01900-B-0004)
AH TALKING ABOUT FAMILY DO YOU WANT TO START OR SHOULD I SHARE MY OKAY WELL MY FIRST THOUGHT OF FAMILY IS THAT BONDS SHOULD NOT BE BROKEN SHORT OF SOMETHING REALLY HEINOUS  (fe_03_01900-B-0005)
THAT WE ACCEPT IN FAMILY THAT WE MIGHT NOT ACCEPT  (fe_03_01900-B-0006)
WHAT WE WOULDN'T ACCEPT IN OTHER PEOPLE  (fe_03_01900-B-0007)
AND  (fe_03_01900-B-0008)
THAT IS REALLY MY MY STRONG BELIEF ON IT  (fe_03_01900-B-0009)
[LIPSMACK] OKAY I I AGREE WITH THE DEPENDING ON THEM I THINK FAMILY I BELIEVE FAMILY SHOULD ALWAYS BE TO BE ABLE TO DEPEND ON EACH OTHER  (fe_03_01900-B-0012)
I WISH I HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF FAMILY BEING CONFIDANTES BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IN SOME OF MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY MY SISTER ONE SISTER IN PARTICULAR WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT CONFIDANTES AND WE'RE  (fe_03_01900-B-0013)

SO WHEN I THINK OF THE SISTER THAT I'M CLOSE TO SHE'S THE OLDEST ONE SHE'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE OVER EIGHT YEARS OLDER THAN ME BUT THE OTHER ONE IS FIVE YEARS OLDER AND  (fe_03_01900-B-0023)

IT EVEN EVEN THAT WE CAN SHARE AND TALK ABOUT JUST EVERYTHING  (fe_03_01900-B-0026)
NOW NOW LESS BUT I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS YOUNGER ESPECIALLY WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER AND IN MY EARLY TWENTIES AND THAT KIND OF THING  (fe_03_01900-B-0027)
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE YOU KNOW THE EIGHT PLUS YEARS WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHEN YOU'RE IN YOUR FORTIES AND FIFTIES YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE BEING FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR MILES APART JUST MILES APART  (fe_03_01900-B-0028)
