AND I DON'T [MN] BELIEVE THAT NOBODY HAD AN INKLING  (fe_03_01958-B-0009)
I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT  (fe_03_01958-B-0010)
OR EVEN IN AH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO REGULATE THEM  (fe_03_01958-B-0011)
AH BECAUSE UM  (fe_03_01958-B-0012)
THEY SO MANY OF THESE CORPORATIONS HAVE TIES TO THE GOVERNMENT  (fe_03_01958-B-0013)
YOU KNOW AND THE VICE PRESIDENT AH WAS DOING THE TRANSITION RIGHT AFTER ELECTION  (fe_03_01958-B-0014)
AND AH HE HAD A GROUP OF AH  (fe_03_01958-B-0015)
PEOPLE COMING IN TO ADVISE HIM ON WHAT ENERGY POLICIES THEY SHOULD PROMULGATE AND WHAT LEGISLATION THEY SHOULD ASK FOR ENRON REPRESENTATIVES WERE SITTING AT THE TABLE AND THEY WERE HELP WRITING THE PROPOSALS  (fe_03_01958-B-0016)
IF THESE CORPORATIONS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO GIVE SO MUCH MONEY TO THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE POLITICAL CANDIDATES  (fe_03_01958-B-0017)
THEY WOULD HAVE MUCH LESS INFLUENCE I THINK THAT'S PART OF IT  (fe_03_01958-B-0018)
YEAH I I REALLY THINK SO AND THE OTHER THING THAT THE SECURITY AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION UM COULD CRACK DOWN UM YOU KNOW NOBODY HAS GONE TO JAIL YET  (fe_03_01958-B-0019)
YEAH YOU KNOW THEY THINK AFTER A WHILE PEOPLE WILL JUST FORGET ALL ABOUT IT AND UM IT'LL BE SWEPT UNDER THE RUG AND THAT'S THAT AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS AND THE  (fe_03_01958-B-0020)
AH WILL GO ON NOW VICE PRESIDENT CHANEY WAS AN OFFICER OF HALLIBURTON BEFORE HE WAS ELECTED  (fe_03_01958-B-0021)

YOU KNOW UM THEY'RE JUST THERE'S JUST NO LINE DRAWN BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATIONS  (fe_03_01958-B-0026)
AND AH THEY'RE IN BED WITH EACH OTHER  (fe_03_01958-B-0027)
THAT'S RIGHT  (fe_03_01958-B-0028)
YEAH WELL YEAH THE HEAD OF THE S._E._C. IS APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT  (fe_03_01958-B-0029)
AND AH AGAIN YOU KNOW THE AH THEY  (fe_03_01958-B-0030)
THEY'RE NOT STRICT THEY LOOK THE OTHER WAY FOR ONE THING THEY DON'T WANT TO ROCK THE MARKET THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE THE STOCKS GO DOWN  (fe_03_01958-B-0031)
AND FOR ANOTHER THING YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALL BUDDIES THEY'RE ALL AH PROFITING AND THEY'RE ALL AH DRINKING FROM THE SAME TROUGH  (fe_03_01958-B-0032)
MHM  (fe_03_01958-B-0033)
OH THERE'S NO WAY YOU WOULD GET ME TO DO THAT  (fe_03_01958-B-0034)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01958-B-0035)
I'M ON A PENSION AND HALF OF IT IS TIED TO THE STOCK MARKET IT'S VARIABLE IN OTHER WORDS IF THE MARKET GOES UP MY PENSION GOES UP  (fe_03_01958-B-0036)
I'VE LOST HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS EVERY MONTH BECAUSE OF THIS  (fe_03_01958-B-0037)
THAT'S RIGHT AT LEAST MY SOCIAL SECURITY IS FIXED YOU KNOW IT'S A FIXED AMOUNT I KNOW I'M GOING TO GET IT I HOPE [LAUGHTER] AND AH THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING TO INVEST IT IN THE STOCK MARKET IT'S JUST TOO UNCERTAIN  (fe_03_01958-B-0038)
WELL YOU KNOW THE GOVERNMENT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE CONTROLLING WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW AND I'M NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL  (fe_03_01958-B-0039)
YOU KNOW I REALLY DON'T TRUST THEM  (fe_03_01958-B-0040)
UM THEY AH PLAY AROUND WITH SOCIAL SECURITY MONEY  (fe_03_01958-B-0041)
AH THEY YOU KNOW INCLUDE IT IN THEIR INCOME WITH THEIR BUDGET AMOUNTS  (fe_03_01958-B-0042)
AND AH SOCIAL SECURITY MONEY IS USED TO AH TO FINANCE GOVERNMENT BONDS AND THEY ONLY PAY SOMETHING LIKE A VERY LOW PERCENTAGE  (fe_03_01958-B-0043)
AH I REALLY THINK THEY'RE CHEATING THE AH SOCIAL SECURITY FUND AND THEY'RE USING IT FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES I JUST DON'T TRUST THE GOVERNMENT AH TO GO ANY FURTHER WITH MY RETIREMENT MONEY I JUST DON'T  (fe_03_01958-B-0044)
I THINK SO I REALLY DO  (fe_03_01958-B-0045)
YES BUT THE CORPORATIONS YOU KNOW AH THEY CONTRIBUTE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS YOU KNOW THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT  (fe_03_01958-B-0046)
AH AND THEIR OFFICERS AND THEY USE RELATIVES AND FRIENDS BUT THE CORPORATIONS ARE NOT REGULATED AS FAR AS CONTRIBUTIONS THE SAME AS AH AS INDIVIDUALS  (fe_03_01958-B-0047)
YES  (fe_03_01958-B-0048)
BUT  (fe_03_01958-B-0049)
YOU KNOW THERE'S ANOTHER PROBLEM A LOT OF THESE CORPORATION EXECUTIVES GET JOBS IN THE GOVERNMENT YOU KNOW THE VICE PRESIDENT CONDOLEEZZA RICE I'M SURE THERE ARE MANY OTHERS  (fe_03_01958-B-0050)
AND THEN A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO LEAVE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND POSITIONS THEN THEY GO AND THEY'RE YOU KNOW DIRECTORS OF CORPORATIONS  (fe_03_01958-B-0051)
SO THERE THERE'S NO SEPARATION THERE HAS TO BE LEGISLATION TO SEPARATE AND ALSO THE LEGISLATION THAT EXISTS RIGHT NOW IS NOT BEING ENFORCED  (fe_03_01958-B-0052)
YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT COMMITTED CRIMINAL ACTS  (fe_03_01958-B-0053)
ARE GETTING AWAY WITH IT AND ORDINARY WORKING PEOPLE HAVE LOST A LOT OF MONEY THEY'VE LOST MONEY IN THEIR RETIREMENT FUNDS AND THEIR SAVINGS YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO DEPENDED ON THEIR STOCK DIVIDENDS TO  (fe_03_01958-B-0054)
FOR THEIR INCOME  (fe_03_01958-B-0055)
OH DEAR  (fe_03_01958-B-0056)
YEAH BUT THE TROUBLE IS THE MONEY DOESN'T GO TO INVESTORS NOW THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO AIRLINES YOU KNOW WHO WERE GOING BANKRUPT  (fe_03_01958-B-0057)
BUT THE INVESTORS AND PEOPLE WHO LOST MONEY ON THE STOCK MARKET INVESTING IN THOSE AIRLINES DIDN'T GET A PENNY  (fe_03_01958-B-0058)
THEY GOT NOTHING  (fe_03_01958-B-0059)
AH IT'S JUST I THINK THE GOVERNMENT IS WORRIED SO MUCH ABOUT PROTECTING CORPORATIONS  (fe_03_01958-B-0060)
AND THEY TRY TO PERSUADE US THAT AH IF THE CORPORATIONS AND BUSINESS IS ALL RIGHT THEN THE LITTLE PEOPLE WILL BE ALL RIGHT TOO BUT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY SO  (fe_03_01958-B-0061)
YEAH  (fe_03_01958-B-0062)
OR AT LEAST SAY WHEN SOMEBODY IS THE HEAD OF A CORPORATION THEY CAN'T GO RIGHT INTO GOVERNMENT  (fe_03_01958-B-0063)
THERE SHOULD BE A TIME LAPSE AND WHEN SOMEBODY LEAVES THE GOVERNMENT I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO IMMEDIATELY TO WORK FOR A CORPORATION  (fe_03_01958-B-0064)
BECAUSE IF THESE DEALS ARE IN THE WORKS YOU KNOW THEY KNOW THAT IF YOU DO WHAT THE CORPORATIONS WANT YOU'RE GONNA GET A NICE JOB AS A A DIRECTOR THE DIRECTORS MAKE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR  (fe_03_01958-B-0065)
OH THE LOBBYISTS OH THAT'S ANOTHER STORY YEAH  (fe_03_01958-B-0066)
