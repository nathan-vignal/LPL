KAREN  (fe_03_01964-A-0001)
I'M IN AH LOUISVILLE KENTUCKY  (fe_03_01964-A-0002)
OH WOW [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01964-A-0003)
YES  (fe_03_01964-A-0005)
I I FEEL THE SAME TOO UM  (fe_03_01964-A-0006)
A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN CORPORATE AMERICA THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS NOT BROUGHT ABOUT UPON AH ESPECIALLY STOCKHOLDERS OR NOT BEING AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON THERE EITHER [NOISE]  (fe_03_01964-A-0007)
GET OUT AND CLOSE THE DOOR I'M SORRY [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01964-A-0008)
[NOISE]  (fe_03_01964-A-0009)
JUST CLOSE THE DOOR  (fe_03_01964-A-0010)
[NOISE] CORPORATE AMERICA IS NOT BEING BROUGHT UP ON WHAT'S GOING ON UM  (fe_03_01964-A-0011)
THE THE STOCKHOLDERS ARE NOT EVEN AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE WHAT THEY PUT IN THEIR YEAR IN PAPERWORK IS WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHAT HAS HAPPENED  (fe_03_01964-A-0012)
AND I THINK THAT REFLECTS INTO THE STOCK MARKET TOO BECAUSE NO ONE TRUSTS ANYTHING ANY MORE  (fe_03_01964-A-0013)
I AGREE  (fe_03_01964-A-0014)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01964-A-0015)
I I LOOK FORWARD TO THINKING THAT ONCE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD TODAY  (fe_03_01964-A-0017)
ONCE THAT ENDS AND WE CAN GET BACK TO WHAT THE HOME PROBLEMS ARE  (fe_03_01964-A-0018)
AH THAT AT THAT POINT THEY CAN GIVE MORE AH ACTUALLY GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS INTO PRIVATE BUSINESSES  (fe_03_01964-A-0019)
EVEN EVEN UM  (fe_03_01964-A-0020)
STOCKHOLDER HELD BUSINESSES THAT THEY CAN GET MORE ACCOUNTING IN THERE  (fe_03_01964-A-0021)
AND INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTING I GUESS WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO PHRASE THAT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE IN HOME ACCOUNTING OR THE HIRED ACCOUNTING CAN EASILY BE SWAYED  (fe_03_01964-A-0022)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_01964-A-0023)
YES THE ACCOUNTING FIRMS NEED TO BE HELD I THINK THEY NEED TO BE HELD MORE ACCOUNTABLE TOO  (fe_03_01964-A-0024)
FOR  (fe_03_01964-A-0025)
WHAT IS BEING DONE  (fe_03_01964-A-0026)
THE IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE ACCOUNTING FIRMS NEED TO BE AUDITED AS WELL AS  (fe_03_01964-A-0027)
UM THE FIRMS THAT THE ACCOUNTING FIRMS ARE AUDITING  (fe_03_01964-A-0028)

THAT'S OKAY  (fe_03_01964-A-0030)
YES  (fe_03_01964-A-0031)
[NOISE]  (fe_03_01964-A-0032)
YES  (fe_03_01964-A-0033)
AND IT'S PROBABLY MUCH MORE ELABORATE  (fe_03_01964-A-0034)
THAN ANYONE COULD EVER IMAGINE IT BEING  (fe_03_01964-A-0035)
AWAY WITH ANYTHING AND THEN YOU TURN AROUND AND LOOK AT THESE COMPANIES THAT ARE GOING BANKRUPT OR CLOSE TO BANKRUPT THAT YET THEY ARE STILL PAYING THEIR C._E._O.'S THESE EXORBITANT AMOUNTS OF BONUSES  (fe_03_01964-A-0037)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01964-A-0039)

YEAH I THINK  (fe_03_01964-A-0042)
YEAH I AGREE WITH YOU I DO EVERYTHING DOES HAPPEN FOR A REASON  (fe_03_01964-A-0043)
I THINK IN A WAY WITH THE STOCK MARKET FALLING AS IT HAS IT'S GIVEN PEOPLE MORE REASON  (fe_03_01964-A-0045)
TO GO AND REEVALUATE THINGS THAT THEY WERE JUST TAKING FOR GRANTED BEFORE WHICH IS HOW A LOT OF THESE C._E._O.S AND AGENCIES GOT AWAY WITH WHAT THEY DID BECAUSE PEOPLE DIDN'T REALLY LOOK  (fe_03_01964-A-0046)
AND QUESTION  (fe_03_01964-A-0047)
WHAT WAS GO GOING ON THEY JUST THOUGHT OH  (fe_03_01964-A-0048)
I'M GETTING THIS MUCH MONEY BACK FROM THIS MUCH STOCK AND I'M DOING THIS AND HEY YOU KNOW I JUST I WANT EVERYTHING GO BECAUSE I'M MAKING MONEY WHICH IN THE LONG RUN SHOULD NOT BE THE WAY THINGS GO MONEY IT'S BECOME A MONEY DRIVEN SOCIETY AND  (fe_03_01964-A-0049)
AND THAT'S WHAT IT HAS COME DOWN TO AND AS LONG AS THESE PEOPLE ARE GETTING MONEY THAT'S ALL REALLY ALL THEY CARED ABOUT AND WHAT THEY'VE GOT THEMSELVES INTO NOW IS THEY HAD EVERYTHING ALL LINED UP AND NOW WITH THE THINGS THAT HAVE GONE ON AT HOME  (fe_03_01964-A-0050)
IN AH THE WORLD EVERYTHING UM  (fe_03_01964-A-0051)
THEN THEY ARE FINALLY STARTING TO SEE HEY WAIT A MINUTE MAYBE I  (fe_03_01964-A-0052)

AT WHAT IS GOING ON HOW HOW IS MY MONEY BEING USED IN THIS AREA AND HOW IS MY MONEY BEING USED IN THAT AREA  (fe_03_01964-A-0054)
AND  (fe_03_01964-A-0055)
REEVALUATE THAT  (fe_03_01964-A-0056)
OH YEAH  (fe_03_01964-A-0057)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_01964-A-0059)
I GUESS IT WOULD GO RIGHT BACK INTO SLAPPING THE HAND THAT FEEDS YOU AT THAT POINT  (fe_03_01964-A-0060)
BECAUSE WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO GO AGAINST THE COMPANY THAT'S GIVING THEM A PAY CHEQUE WHEREAS IF THEY HAD AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR COME IN  (fe_03_01964-A-0061)
THAT HAD NO REAL COST TO THE COMPANY THAT WOULD FEEL FREER TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHEN THERE WAS AH  (fe_03_01964-A-0062)
ERRORS OR MISAPPROPRIATIONS OR WHATEVER THEY FEEL  (fe_03_01964-A-0063)
YES  (fe_03_01964-A-0064)
AND EVEN IF IT AND EVEN IF IT WAS ENDED UP BEING A LEGITIMATE ERROR BUT NO ONE WENT BACK AND FIXED IT  (fe_03_01964-A-0065)
YES  (fe_03_01964-A-0066)
AND THEN THAT TURNS INTO SOMETHING BIGGER AND IT SNOWBALLS AND THEN IT'S OUT OF EVERYBODY'S CONTROL AND ALL THEY CAN DO IS JUST CONTINUALLY TRY TO HIDE WHAT STARTED OUT SMALL AND GREW LARGER AND  (fe_03_01964-A-0067)
WHAT I'M SORRY WHAT WAS THE COMPANY NAME THAT WAS CLOSED  (fe_03_01964-A-0068)
ENRON YEAH THEY  (fe_03_01964-A-0069)

TOTAL  (fe_03_01964-A-0071)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_01964-A-0072)

YEAH  (fe_03_01964-B-0008)
EXACTLY EXACTLY I THINK  (fe_03_01964-B-0009)
MAYBE PART OF THE BUSINESS AH THE PROBLEMS ARE BUSINESSES SO BIG THAT NOBODY KNOWS WHAT ANYBODY ELSE IS DOING SO PEOPLE CAN GET AWAY WITH A LOT OF THINGS  (fe_03_01964-B-0010)
YEAH SO UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS  (fe_03_01964-B-0011)
BUT DEFINITELY MORE MONITORING IS AND I THINK IT'S GOOD THAT THEY ARE STARTING TO CHECK INTO IT AND I HOPE THEY CONTINUE THAT BECAUSE WE NEED MORE CONFIDENCE IN  (fe_03_01964-B-0012)
IN THE BUSINESS PEOPLE  (fe_03_01964-B-0013)
MHM  (fe_03_01964-B-0015)

UM SO YOU KNOW YOU ALMOST HAVE TO HAVE OPEN BOOKS AND AH  (fe_03_01964-B-0018)
PEOPLE LIKE YOU KNOW PEOPLE MORE THAN ONE PERSON THAT CAN CHECK THE BOOKS ON A REGULAR BASIS  (fe_03_01964-B-0019)

ACCOUNTANTS AH OR THE RECORD KEEPING  (fe_03_01964-B-0023)

ANYWAY  (fe_03_01964-B-0028)
AH YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT  (fe_03_01964-B-0029)
I THINK WE NEED TO GET BACK TO TO SOMETHING SMALLER AND I THINK AH THEY NEED MORE MONITORING LIKE I SAID  (fe_03_01964-B-0030)
AH AND I AM I'M ANXIOUS FOR EVERYTHING TO GET BACK TO NORMAL BECAUSE VALUES ARE NOT WHAT THEY SHOULD BE AND I THINK THAT'S REFLECTED IN FAMILY LIFE EVERYWHERE  (fe_03_01964-B-0031)
SO IT OBVIOUSLY SPILLS INTO BUSINESS  (fe_03_01964-B-0032)
UM  (fe_03_01964-B-0033)
SO WE THE PROBLEM IS PROBABLY VERY DEEP  (fe_03_01964-B-0034)
UM MORE THAN IT'S A SYMPTOM I THINK OF OUR SOCIETY PROBABLY AND WE'RE AS MUCH RESPONSIBLE FOR IT AS ANYBODY ELSE I SUPPOSE  (fe_03_01964-B-0035)
YEAH AND MORE COMPLEX AND AH  (fe_03_01964-B-0036)
I GUESS PEOPLE GET TOO BIG AND IT'S JUST LIKE POWER CORRUPTS ALMOST  (fe_03_01964-B-0037)
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TOO FAR FOR THAT YOU CAN START WITH GOVERNMENTS  (fe_03_01964-B-0041)
[LAUGHTER] THEIR RETIREES GET THE PENSIONS THAT NONE OF US WILL EVER GET  (fe_03_01964-B-0042)
SO IT'S AH  (fe_03_01964-B-0043)
WE NEED TO GET BACK TO BASIC PRINCIPLES OF WAY BACK  (fe_03_01964-B-0045)
AND AH I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL EVER HAPPEN I THINK IT MAY BE CRISES ARE NECESSARY TO BRING BACK BALANCE AND MAYBE EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_01964-B-0046)
IS FOR A REASON I MEAN A BIGGER REASON THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT LIKE UP THERE I GUESS I'M A BIT I'M A BIT AH SPIRITUAL ALSO SO THAT'S AFFECTED MY THINKING  (fe_03_01964-B-0047)
AT A AT THE PERFECT TIME IN THAT WE MAY NOT UNDERSTAND IT AND I THINK THINGS WILL AH CHANGE AND SOMETIMES WE NEED SOMETHING TO BE REALLY JOLTED FOR THINGS TO REALLY CHANGE  (fe_03_01964-B-0048)
YES PEOPLE ARE SCARED  (fe_03_01964-B-0049)
MHM  (fe_03_01964-B-0050)

CANNOT KEEP TRACK OF EVERYTHING I MEAN IT'S IMPOSSIBLE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE  (fe_03_01964-B-0058)
SO AH I THINK WE NEED TO DEMERGE INSTEAD OF MERGING [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW BECAUSE LITTLE WHEN THINGS ARE SMALL THEY ARE MORE TRANSPARENT  (fe_03_01964-B-0059)
AH BY VIRTUE OF BEING SMALL AND AH  (fe_03_01964-B-0060)
CONSULTANTS  (fe_03_01964-B-0062)

IF THEIR THEIR TENDENCY IS TO BE THAT THEY AH  (fe_03_01964-B-0066)
THEY GO BIGGER AND BIGGER AND MORE FR- AND MORE FRAUD AND THEY GET AWAY WITH IT LIKE I SAY THEY BECOME INVINCIBLE SO THEY THINK AND THEN IT GETS OUT OF HAND AND THEN YOU HAVE TO CONTINUE I SUPPOSE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01964-B-0067)

AH ACCOUNTING BUT THEY WANT IT YOU KNOW THE CREATIVE BOOKKEEPING TO HIDE THINGS OR TO MISREPRESENT THINGS AND  (fe_03_01964-B-0072)
IT'S TOO BIG I THINK TO BE A LEGITIMATE MAYBE AT THE VERY BEGINNING AND THEN THEY HID IT MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT YOU KNOW LIKE YOU MAKE A MISTAKE AND THEN YOU HIDE IT BECAUSE  (fe_03_01964-B-0073)
ENRON  (fe_03_01964-B-0075)
THAT ONE WAS BAD [LAUGHTER] THAT WAS BAD I WONDER HOW WIDESPREAD IT IS IT'S IT'S YOU KNOW IT AH  (fe_03_01964-B-0076)
IT WOULD BE AH MORE REASSURING IF IT WAS JUST A COUPLE OF COMPANIES BUT IT'S IT HAS BECOME AN ACCEPTED PRACTICE IN THAT  (fe_03_01964-B-0077)
THEN WE ARE HAVING PROBL- YOU KNOW IT'S I THINK IT'S ETHICAL AND IT'S MORALS AND IT GOES LIKE I SAY MUCH DEEPER THAN JUST THE COMPANIES IT'S OBVIOUS PROBABLY A REFLECTION OF OUR SOCIETY AND YOU NEED TO GET DOWN TO BASIC VALUES OF YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01964-B-0078)
