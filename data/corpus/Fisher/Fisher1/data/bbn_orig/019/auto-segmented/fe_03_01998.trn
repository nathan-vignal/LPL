YEAH I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE DEFINITELY RIGHT ABOUT THAT  (fe_03_01998-A-0003)
I THINK THEY CAN FOR ONE THING PUT THE BIG BOYS IN JAIL  (fe_03_01998-A-0004)
THROW AWAY THE KEY I'M SORRY  (fe_03_01998-A-0005)

I'M FR- IN ATLANTA  (fe_03_01998-A-0010)
YEAH  (fe_03_01998-A-0011)
IT REALLY IS [COUGH] SO WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE DONE  (fe_03_01998-A-0012)
TO CURB THIS KIND OF THING  (fe_03_01998-A-0013)
YEAH I AGREE I DON'T I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO BE DONE BUT I THINK THAT'S  (fe_03_01998-A-0014)
PROBABLY ONE THING THAT I THINK EXCUSE ME I THINK ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE TO DISCOURAGE THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOUR IS SIMPLY TO PUNISH PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO ARE PROVEN TO BE GUILTY OF IT  (fe_03_01998-A-0015)
STOP THEM IN THEIR TRACKS AND MAKE EXAMPLES OF THEM OPENLY AND LIKE YOU SAID SEND THEM TO REAL JAIL  (fe_03_01998-A-0016)
YOU KNOW JUST LIKE THEY WOULD ANYBODY ELSE BECAUSE  (fe_03_01998-A-0017)
IF YOU OR I OR ANY I'M ASSUMING YOU KNOW THAT YOU YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THESE PEOPLE WHO WORKS IN YOU KNOW WHO WAS IN TOP LEVEL AT A TOP LEVEL MANAGEMENT POSITION IN A CORPORATION  (fe_03_01998-A-0018)
UM BUT IF YOU'RE IN THAT SITUATION AND AND YOU HAVE ACCESS TO  (fe_03_01998-A-0019)
OR YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOUR  (fe_03_01998-A-0020)
I THINK THAT UM  (fe_03_01998-A-0021)
YOU NEED TO BE STOPPED IN YOUR TRACKS I MEAN SOMETHING LIKE YOU SAY HAS TO BE DONE  (fe_03_01998-A-0022)
TO STOP IT  (fe_03_01998-A-0023)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01998-A-0024)
AND YOU KNOW WHAT IS FUNNY TO ME IS YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO WRITE BAD CHECKS AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT IT'S RIGHT TO WRITE A BAD CHECK TO A MERCHANT OR TO ANYBODY ELSE BUT  (fe_03_01998-A-0025)
YOU CAN GET PRISON TIME IF YOU CAN THINKING OF WRITING BAD CHECKS  (fe_03_01998-A-0026)
AND YET I MEAN I HAVE KNOWN PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOTTEN YOU KNOW MAYBE FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS WHATEVER DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH WAS INVOLVED FOR WRITING A BAD CHECK AND YET THESE PEOPLE CAN STEAL LITERALLY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM PEOPLE  (fe_03_01998-A-0027)
AND ALSO FROM THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND NOTHING HAPPENS  (fe_03_01998-A-0028)
WELL AND THE OTHER WAY THAT THEY'RE AFFECTED TOO IS THE FACT THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME  (fe_03_01998-A-0029)
AH TYPICALLY BECOME MORE AH MORE DISTRUSTING OF CORPORATE AMERICA IN GENERAL I KNOW I'M MORE DISTRUSTING  (fe_03_01998-A-0030)
THAT ALONE WITH THE FACT THAT WE KNOW THAT WELL ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT I WAS READING NOT LONG AGO THAT A LOT OF THE AH THE TOP LEVEL MANAGERS IN CORPORATIONS GET THESE HUGE BONUSES  (fe_03_01998-A-0031)
BESIDES ALREADY BEING PAID REALLY REALLY WELL  (fe_03_01998-A-0032)
IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY GET THESE BIG BIG BIG BONUSES FOR MEETING CERTAIN GOALS  (fe_03_01998-A-0033)
AND EVEN WHEN THEIR WHEN THEIR JOBS ARE ELIMINATED THEY'RE THE FIRST ONES  (fe_03_01998-A-0034)
WHO ARE UM  (fe_03_01998-A-0035)
PROVIDED FOR I MEAN IT'S LIKE SCREW ALL THE REST OF YOU YOU KNOW ALL THE REST OF THE EMPLOYEES  (fe_03_01998-A-0036)
YOU JUST HAVE TO DO THE BEST CAN YOU YOU YOU MIGHT GET YOU KNOW MAYBE A COUPLE OF MONTHS PAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT  (fe_03_01998-A-0037)
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY GET HUGE BONUSES AND THEY'RE TAKEN CARE OF FOR LIFE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01998-A-0038)
YEAH AND PUT IT IN THE STOCK MARKET INSTEAD I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING WITH THE MORE CONSERVATIVE INVESTMENTS LIKE REAL ESTATE  (fe_03_01998-A-0039)
T. BILLS UM BONDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT LIKE I SAID A LOT MORE CONSERVATIVE  (fe_03_01998-A-0040)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01998-A-0041)
RIGHT MORE SECURITY LESS RISK  (fe_03_01998-A-0042)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01998-A-0043)
YEAH THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_01998-A-0044)
THAT'S A PRETTY SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS AND I THINK LIKE YOU SAID SOMETHING MUST BE DONE AND QUICKLY OTHERWISE I GUESS WE ARE ALL KIND OF  (fe_03_01998-A-0045)
OUR PENSIONS WILL GO IN THE HELL IN THE HAND BASKET SO TO SPEAK  (fe_03_01998-A-0046)
YEAH AND SPEAKING OF THAT I MEAN I HAVEN'T BEEN REAL IMPRESSED WITH OUR CURRENT ADMINISTRATION  (fe_03_01998-A-0047)
IN TERMS OF ACTIONS TAKEN  (fe_03_01998-A-0048)
AGAINST PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMMITTED THOSE KINDS OF CRIMES  (fe_03_01998-A-0049)
I DON'T THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE VERY MUCH DONE EITHER BECAUSE I MEAN WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT I MEAN  (fe_03_01998-A-0050)
YOU DON'T CUT OFF  (fe_03_01998-A-0051)
THE SOURCE THAT FEEDS YOU SO TO SPEAK  (fe_03_01998-A-0052)
RIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THIS WAR WITH IRAQ BECAUSE  (fe_03_01998-A-0054)
PEOPLE AREN'T TALKING QUITE AS MUCH AS ABOUT ABOUT THE ECONOMY PEOPLE ARE STILL LOSING JOBS  (fe_03_01998-A-0055)
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE LOSING THEIR LIVES IN THE WAR WITH IRAQ  (fe_03_01998-A-0056)
THAT KIND OF TOOK A BACK SEAT  (fe_03_01998-A-0057)
YEAH SO  (fe_03_01998-A-0058)
YEAH AND EVENTUALLY IT IT WILL COME TO LIGHT  (fe_03_01998-A-0060)
OH YEAH  (fe_03_01998-A-0061)
AND THE THING THAT GETS ME TOO IS THAT  (fe_03_01998-A-0062)
THESE PEOPLE REALLY ARE IN NEED OF THE MONEY MUCH LESS THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON I MEAN THEY'RE ALREADY MAKING  (fe_03_01998-A-0063)
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS I MEAN THEY WOULD MAKE THAT WHETHER THEY STOLE MONEY OR NOT BUT IN ADDITION TO THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE ALREADY GETTING PAID THE SALARIES AND THE BONUSES AND ALL THE OTHER PERKS  (fe_03_01998-A-0064)
THEY CAN'T SETTLE FOR THAT THEY'VE GOT TO STEAL GOT TO SCAM AND SCROUNGE AROUND TO AH TO GET MORE  (fe_03_01998-A-0065)
WELL I THINK IT IT STARTS TO AFFECT LIKE YOU SAY NOT JUST THE INVESTORS OF THE PARTICULAR CORPORATION THAT'S AFFECTED YOU KNOW WHERE THE SCAM TAKES PLACE BUT IT ALSO AFFECTS  (fe_03_01998-A-0066)
PEOPLE'S ATTITUDES TOWARDS CORPORATE AMERICA IN GENERAL WHICH IN TURN AFFECTS OUR NATIONAL ECONOMY  (fe_03_01998-A-0067)
YEAH YOU YOU BETTER BELIEVE THAT  (fe_03_01998-A-0068)
HI I'M LENORA  (fe_03_01998-B-0001)
HI TED I UM THIS IS A BIG BROAD TOPIC TODAY  (fe_03_01998-B-0002)
YES BUT I DO THINK THAT UM THAT THE MAJOR CORPORATIONS AND ALL THE SCANDAL HAS A LOT TO DO WITH OUR ECONOMY TODAY  (fe_03_01998-B-0003)
BECAUSE UM A LOT OF MONEY WAS LOST  (fe_03_01998-B-0004)
THROUGH ENRON AND SOME OF THE OTHER BIG BOYS  (fe_03_01998-B-0005)
AND WHAT DO WE THINK THAT THEY CAN DO TO CURVE IT  (fe_03_01998-B-0006)
AND REAL  (fe_03_01998-B-0007)
REAL JAIL NOT NOT THE LUXURY PRISON  (fe_03_01998-B-0008)
UM NOT THE LUXURY PRISONS WHERE THEY ARE GETTING CAVIAR AND LOBSTER AND HARD TIME  (fe_03_01998-B-0009)
PUT 'EM ON THE CHAIN LINE  (fe_03_01998-B-0010)

SO YEAH SO IT'S JUST THAT YOU KNOW THEY DO THEY DO THE CRIME BUT IT'S BLUE COLLAR SO THEY ACT LIKE IT'S NOTHING MAJOR  (fe_03_01998-B-0015)
BUT IT AFFECTED A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE THEIR PENSIONS AND  (fe_03_01998-B-0016)
JUST IT IT'S AN TUMBLING EFFECT YOU KNOW THEY START AT THE STOP BUT IT COMES DOWN TO THE TO THE CLEANING PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY LOSE PENSIONS AND YOU KNOW THEIR LIVELIHOOD THEY WORK TWENTY YEARS AND THEY THINK THEY HAVE A PENSION IN THERE AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY  (fe_03_01998-B-0017)
IT'S A SAD SAD SITUATION  (fe_03_01998-B-0018)
I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE MORE MONITORING OF THESE MAJOR COMPANIES YOU KNOW BEING THAT THEY DO HAVE THE FINANCIAL STATUS THEY HAVE THEIR OWN ACCOUNTANTS AND ALL THAT  (fe_03_01998-B-0019)
GOVERNMENT NEED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO MONITOR THOSE PEOPLE  (fe_03_01998-B-0020)
BECAUSE IT'S JUST LIKE YOU HAVE CARTE BLANCHE YOU ARE WORKING FOR THE PERSON THAT THE PERSON THAT HAS THE MONEY THAT IS DOING THE SCAM IS PAYING YOU  (fe_03_01998-B-0021)
SO YOU PAD THE BOOKS TO MAKE YOUR UM PERSON LOOK GOOD  (fe_03_01998-B-0022)
THEY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE IT CAN'T CONTINUE ON LIKE CONTINUE ON THE WAY IT IS  (fe_03_01998-B-0023)
OPENLY  (fe_03_01998-B-0024)

RIGHT RIGHT AND THAT YOU KNOW AND IT'S ALL OF US HAVE OUR  (fe_03_01998-B-0045)
A LOT OF US HAVE OUR PENSIONS AND OUR 401KS INVESTED INTO THE STOCK MARKET SO YOU KNOW IF WE'RE NOT RETIRING WITHIN TWENTY YEARS WHAT DO WE LOOK AT YOU KNOW WITH ALL THIS SCANDAL AND ALL THIS  (fe_03_01998-B-0046)
STUFF GOING ON WILL THERE BE ANY MONEY WILL THERE BE ANY SOCIAL SECURITY [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE THEY WANT TO TAKE OUR SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS AND INVEST IT  (fe_03_01998-B-0047)
