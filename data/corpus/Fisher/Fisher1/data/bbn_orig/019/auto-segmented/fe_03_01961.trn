[LAUGHTER] HI CHRISTINE [LAUGHTER] THIS IS AN INTERESTING SUBJECT [LAUGHTER] WHAT'S YOU  (fe_03_01961-A-0002)
[LAUGHTER] OH IS THAT RIGHT  (fe_03_01961-A-0003)

OKAY I I PROBABLY I PROBABLY AGREE WITH THAT TO THE EFFECT THAT I THINK THAT A LOT OF POLITICIANS ARE QUOTE UNQUOTE OWNED BY THEIR INTEREST GROUPS UM AND I DON'T THINK THAT I DON'T THINK THAT I'D HAVE AN ARGUMENT WITH THAT  (fe_03_01961-A-0012)
THAT STATEMENT AT ALL UM  (fe_03_01961-A-0013)
AS FAR AS AS  (fe_03_01961-A-0014)
THAT UM  (fe_03_01961-A-0015)
REGULATING WHAT THEY WILL OR WILL WON'T DO I THINK THAT THAT PROBABLY HAS MORE TO DO WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC TAKING AN INTEREST AND EITHER ALLOWING THEM  (fe_03_01961-A-0016)
NOT ALLOWING THEM AS HAS BEEN THE CASE MANY TIMES IN WHERE I'M FROM IN NEW ENGLAND AH THE CASE OF WHERE THE WORSE THEY ARE IT SEEMS THE MORE THEY'LL LET THEM YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER] [MN]  (fe_03_01961-A-0017)

SO YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01961-A-0042)

I MEAN YEAH HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HAD A COP GO WHIZZING BY YOU ONLY TO SEE HIM PULLED OVER AT MCDONALD'S OR SOMETHING UP THE ROAD YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01961-A-0045)

COULD HAVE SOME SORT OF PROMINENCE IN IN THEIR PLANS BUT YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THIS MONEY HANGING OVER THEIR HEAD AND THEIR CAREER AND IF THEY WANT TO KEEP GOING  (fe_03_01961-B-0015)
THEN THEY KIND OF HAVE TO GO ALONG WITH THE STATUS QUO IN A WAY  (fe_03_01961-B-0016)
I THINK THE PUBLIC  (fe_03_01961-B-0017)
EVEN THOUGH THEY TAKE AN INTEREST IN CERTAIN THINGS POLITICIANS B._S. THE PUBLIC ALL THE TIME AND PEOPLE JUST KINDA SIT BACK AND GO FOR IT  (fe_03_01961-B-0018)
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH  (fe_03_01961-B-0019)

LIKE WHEN THIS WHOLE ENRON THING WENT ON THE PRESIDENT'S LIKE WE NEED TOUGHER LAWS AND DA DA DA DA BUT IN REALITY IF THEY JUST ENFORCED THE LAWS THAT EXIST ALREADY  (fe_03_01961-B-0021)

THAT'S IT  (fe_03_01961-B-0066)
YOU HAVE TO STRIP ALL THE POSSIBILITIES FOR CORRUPTION THAT YOU SEE  (fe_03_01961-B-0067)
AND YOU KNOW IN IN POLITICS BASICALLY LIKE I SAID THE FUNDING THING  (fe_03_01961-B-0068)

HAVING PUB- PUBLIC MEETINGS ALL THE MEETINGS SHOULD BE PUBLIC AND BROADCAST LIKE THEY DO ON C-SPAN FOR MOST OF THEM  (fe_03_01961-B-0070)
UM POLICIES MAYBE IF THEY MADE THE POLICIES UNDERSTANDABLE FOR EVERYBODY  (fe_03_01961-B-0071)
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T DO POLITICS BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW IF THEY CAN UNDERSTAND IT  (fe_03_01961-B-0072)
IT'S ANOTHER LANGUAGE YEAH [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01961-B-0073)

PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION AND SOMETHING ELSE  (fe_03_01961-B-0079)

DEBATE OR WHATEVER IT WAS SO YOU CAN KINDA UNDERSTAND IT A LITTLE EASIER THAT WAY  (fe_03_01961-B-0082)

LESSER HOODLUMS [LAUGHTER] TAKING OVER THINGS YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01961-B-0094)
IF THEY DON'T REGULATE THIS THAT AND THE OTHER THING SOMEBODY'S GOING TO BE IN THERE THAT'S GOING TO BE CORRUPT AND PROBABLY MORE CORRUPT SO IT'S LIKE A LESSER OF TWO EVILS  (fe_03_01961-B-0095)
