NOT UM GOOD FOR THE COMPANY  (fe_03_01965-B-0012)
BECAUSE THEY DON'T TALK TO THE PEOPLE THAT IT DIRECTLY AFFECTS  (fe_03_01965-B-0013)

I WATCHED A DOCUMENTARY LIKE ON WALMART ONE TIME  (fe_03_01965-B-0015)

AND THEY MAKE ALL THE DEC- DECISIONS AND AND AND THINGS AND NO ONE LIKE NO ONE ASKED US WHAT WILL WORK  (fe_03_01965-B-0038)
AND IT IT ENDS UP SOMETIMES MAKING OUR JOB HARDER INSTEAD OF EASIER  (fe_03_01965-B-0039)
AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEN  (fe_03_01965-B-0040)
YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE THAT GET PUT IN LIKE SUPERVISOR POSITIONS ARE LIKE PAY OFFS  (fe_03_01965-B-0041)
YOU KNOW SOMEBODY'S UNCLE OR  (fe_03_01965-B-0042)
YOU YOU KNOW AND THEY'RE NOT LIKE  (fe_03_01965-B-0043)
SO I I JUST THINK THAT THE LITTLE PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE MORE INPUT AND I'D RATHER SEE THESE BIG CORPORATIONS HIRE FROM LIKE WITHIN  (fe_03_01965-B-0044)
I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE MORE DEDICATION  (fe_03_01965-B-0045)
AND IF SOMEBODY HAS WORKED FOR YOU FOR YEARS AND THEY PROVE TO BE AN HONEST  (fe_03_01965-B-0046)
UM PERSON AND AND AND THEY SEEM TO HAVE THE COMPANY YOU KNOW FIRST IN MIND I THINK THEY WOULD BE BETTER OFF GIVING THEM THE JOB THAN SOME OUTSIDE PERSON YOU  (fe_03_01965-B-0047)
KNOW AND I GUESS YOUR HUSBAND RUNS INTO THE SAME THING  (fe_03_01965-B-0048)

AND IT MAKES IT HARD  (fe_03_01965-B-0056)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01965-B-0057)
YEAH AND THEN THEY DON'T STOP AND THINK ABOUT THE BIG GUYS SITTING UP THERE AT THE DESK THOUGH HE'S HE'S MANEUVERING THE FIGURES AROUND WITH THE THOUSANDS YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01965-B-0058)
TO HIS BENEFIT  (fe_03_01965-B-0059)
YEAH HE'S DOING IT TOO  (fe_03_01965-B-0060)
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT CORPORATE INTEGRITY  (fe_03_01965-B-0061)
YOU KNOW FILTERING DOWN  (fe_03_01965-B-0062)
YOU KNOW THEY ALWAYS SAY IT STARTS AT THE TOP  (fe_03_01965-B-0063)
YOU KNOW BECAUSE IF YOU'VE GOT INTEGRITY AT THE TOP THEN YOUR EMPLOYEES WILL BE INTEGRITY CONSCIOUS  (fe_03_01965-B-0064)
BUT IF THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP AREN'T  (fe_03_01965-B-0065)
THEN IT DOESN'T COME DOWN  (fe_03_01965-B-0066)
YOU KNOW IF HE IF HE IS UM  (fe_03_01965-B-0067)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01965-B-0068)
UM CHEATING ON HIS EXPENSE ACCOUNT AND DOING ALL THESE THESE LITTLE UNDERHANDED THINGS THAT THEY DO AT THE TOP IT IT FILTERS DOWN  (fe_03_01965-B-0069)
AND I THINK IT JUST LIKE  (fe_03_01965-B-0070)
WHERE IF THEY HIRED I THINK IF THEY WERE A LITTLE MORE SOMETIMES I THINK THEY LOOK FOR TOO MANY CREDENTIALS  (fe_03_01965-B-0071)
AND THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE THEY ARE BETTER OFF MAYBE WITH SOMEBODY THAT DOESN'T HAVE AS MANY DEGREES THAT HA- THAT IS LIKE MORE CORPORATE  (fe_03_01965-B-0072)
THAT'S BEEN THERE A WHILE THAT'S HAD SOME DEDICATION AND HAS SOME INTEGRITY YOU KNOW THAT THAT WOULD BE A BETTER PERSON TO MOVE UP THAT THE WORKERS ALREADY RESPECT  (fe_03_01965-B-0073)
OR DON'T KNOW ANYTHING AS FAR AS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING  (fe_03_01965-B-0076)
THEY JUST GRADUATED FROM GOT AN EXTRA DEGREE AT COLLEGE OR SOMETHING  (fe_03_01965-B-0077)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_01965-B-0079)
AND THAT'S THE BIGGEST COMPLAINT WE JUST HAD A AN EMPLOYEE SURVEY AT THE HOSPITAL AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPLAINTS THERE IS THEY BRING PEOPLE IN FROM THE OUTSIDE PUT 'EM IN A SUPERVISOR POSITION AND THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING  (fe_03_01965-B-0080)
SO THE LITTLE GUY ENDS UP TRAINING THEIR SUPERVISOR  (fe_03_01965-B-0081)
BUT SEE THE PEOPLE THEY BRING IN FROM THE OUTSIDE GOT DEGREES AND ALL  (fe_03_01965-B-0082)
THEY MAY BE THE GIRL THAT HAS BEEN WORKING THERE FOR TEN YEARS THAT KNOWS WHAT SHE IS DOING  (fe_03_01965-B-0083)
DOESN'T HAVE LIKE A FOUR YEAR DEGREE FROM COLLEGE MAYBE SHE ONLY HAS A TWO YEAR OR HAS A HIGH SCHOOL BUT SHE HAS GOT MORE ON THE BALL  (fe_03_01965-B-0084)
THAN THE COLLEGE GRADUATE THEY JUST BROUGHT IN [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01965-B-0086)
AS FAR AS THE JOB GOES  (fe_03_01965-B-0087)
SO THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPLAINTS I KNOW WE HAVE  (fe_03_01965-B-0088)
CHANGE THINGS FOR THE BETTER BUT THEY SEEM TO MAKE IT WORSE  (fe_03_01965-B-0090)
AND THE MORALE GOES DOWN  (fe_03_01965-B-0091)
AND IT'S THAT BIG CORPORATION THING THAT GOES ON  (fe_03_01965-B-0092)
THIS IS THE SECOND ONE I'VE WORKED FOR  (fe_03_01965-B-0093)
