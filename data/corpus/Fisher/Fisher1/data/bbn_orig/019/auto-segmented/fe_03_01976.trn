AND HOW RIGHT AND HOW HAS IT AFFECT THE CORPORATE GREED HAS IT AFFECT YOU AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAS HOW HAS IT AFFECTED YOU  (fe_03_01976-A-0005)
ACTUALLY AH TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE WE WERE IN THE STOCK MARKET WE'RE RETIRED AND WE WERE IN THE STOCK MARKET AND AS THE STOCK CONTINUALLY KEPT DOWN GOING DOWN  (fe_03_01976-A-0006)
AND THEN WE HEARD ABOUT ENRON AND DIFFERENT OTHER COMPANIES AND HOW THEY'RE AFFECTING THE MARKET WE DECIDED TO GO WITH AN ANNUITY  (fe_03_01976-A-0007)
WHICH  (fe_03_01976-A-0008)
GIVES US A LITTLE MORE SECURITY NOW  (fe_03_01976-A-0009)
WHEN WE WERE DISCUSSING ANNUITY WE WENT TO AH ONE THAT WAS BASED ON THE WHICH IS VARIABLE  (fe_03_01976-A-0010)
WHICH IS STILL BASED ON THE MARKET SO AS THE MARKET FLUCTUATES WE DO HAVE FLUCTUATION ON THIS ANNUITY BUT IT IS GUARANTEED TO THE BASE AMOUNT THAT WE HAVE  (fe_03_01976-A-0011)
THAT IS CORRECT  (fe_03_01976-A-0012)
WELL WITH THE VARIABLE ANNUITY THAT WE HAVE WHICH GIVES US PROTECTION AGAINST ECONOMIC UPS AND DOWNS UM WE ARE COMMITTED FOR A SEVEN YEAR PERIOD  (fe_03_01976-A-0013)
THAT IS A STIPULATION SO IF YOU DECIDE TO LEAVE EARLY  (fe_03_01976-A-0014)
YOU'RE LOOKING AT LIKE UM FIFTEEN TWENTY PER CENT I THINK OURS IS LIKE  (fe_03_01976-A-0015)
TWENTY PER CENT SO WHAT WE WOULD NORMALLY DO IS YEAH WE'VE GOT SOME CHANCES THAT YOU KNOW IF THE MARKET TURNS AROUND WHICH HOPEFULLY IT WOULD  (fe_03_01976-A-0016)
AH NOW THAT WE'RE GETTING MORE GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION THEY'RE LOOKING AT ACCOUNTING PRACTICES MORE WE'RE GONNA WE'RE NOT GONNA BE HURT AS MUCH BUT YEAH WE WERE A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED  (fe_03_01976-A-0017)

OH YEAH WELL YEAH THAT'S TRUE AND THEN YOU KNOW TO AH IF THEY WANT TO STAY IN CONGRESS THEY'VE GOT TO LISTEN TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND BASICALLY UM  (fe_03_01976-A-0026)

YOU KNOW LOOKING AT STRICTER GUIDELINES THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING AT  (fe_03_01976-A-0028)
AH MORE UM OPEN ACCOUNTING PRACTICES AND AH I THINK WHAT THEY DID RECENTLY WITH THE UM EXECUTIVES HAVING TO SIGN  (fe_03_01976-A-0029)
UM  (fe_03_01976-A-0030)
SORT OF A LOYALTY OATH  (fe_03_01976-A-0031)
TO SUGGEST THAT THEY ARE GOING TO AH GOVERN THEMSELVES ACCORDINGLY ETHICALLY ET CETERA  (fe_03_01976-A-0032)
IT'S IMPORTANT BUT YOU'RE STILL GONNA GET SOMEBODY THAT BASICALLY AH SEES THE MARKET AS A PERSONAL GAIN AND AH  (fe_03_01976-A-0033)
WANTS TO AH SEE WHAT HE CAN GET AWAY WITH AND I THINK IT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT NOW BECAUSE CONGRESS IS AWARE OF IT THESE EXECUTIVES WHEN THEY'RE REPORTING  (fe_03_01976-A-0034)
THEIR UM PROFIT AND LOSS STATEMENTS ARE REALLY SIGNING OFF  (fe_03_01976-A-0035)

THESE EXECUTIVES AND I KNOW THEY HAVE A LARGE RESPONSIBILITY BUT JUST HOW THEY SEEM TO GET THEIR BONUSES  (fe_03_01976-A-0048)
THEIR SALARIES THEIR STOCK OPTIONS AND THE MIDDLE CLASS WORKING PERSON STILL HAS TO STRUGGLE SO I THINK WITH CONGRESS HAVING THEM AH  (fe_03_01976-A-0049)
SIGNING OFF  (fe_03_01976-A-0050)
SCRUTINIZING THEM NOW I THINK AH THE  (fe_03_01976-A-0051)
ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO POLICE THEMSELVES MORE AND AH YEAH IT'S AH IT'S A BIG HIT AND A BIG CONCERN BUT I THINK IT'S TURNING OUT TO BE BETTER  (fe_03_01976-A-0052)

CAN  (fe_03_01976-B-0021)
PROBABLY DUE TO GREAT PROTEST FROM THE AMERICAN PUBLIC MOST OF WHOM LOST MONEY  (fe_03_01976-B-0022)
ARE SIGNING OFF ON WHAT WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE TRUTH BUT IT'S TURNED OUT TO BE A COLOSSAL PACK OF LIES EVERYBODY FROM WORLDCOM TO  (fe_03_01976-B-0023)
RIGHT ALL OF US HAVE SEEN THAT  (fe_03_01976-B-0025)
RESIGN  (fe_03_01976-B-0026)

WELL AH IT'S THAT HUMILIATION  (fe_03_01976-B-0028)
IT AH  (fe_03_01976-B-0029)
IF A GENTLEMAN WAS  (fe_03_01976-B-0030)
WILLING TO STAND UP AND MEET  (fe_03_01976-B-0031)
AFTER WORKERS MAKE INCREDIBLE CONCESSIONS  (fe_03_01976-B-0032)
AND THEY PAD THEIR POCKETS WITH COLOSSAL BONUSES TO STAND AND LOOK AT THESE MEN AND WOMEN  (fe_03_01976-B-0033)
THEN HE'S GOT MORE CAHONIES THAN MANY TEXANS I'VE MET AND TEXANS HAVE BIG ONES [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01976-B-0034)
I WAS STATIONED IN TEXAS I DON'T KNOW THEY TREATED ME PRETTY GOOD  (fe_03_01976-B-0035)
WHAT YOU HAVE AH YOU HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF AH OF FAITH ED IN UM  (fe_03_01976-B-0036)

BUT I I'M A  (fe_03_01976-B-0039)
TAD SCEPTICAL HAVING OBSERVED POLITICS [LAUGHTER] FOR MANY YEARS  (fe_03_01976-B-0040)
LACK OF COURAGE  (fe_03_01976-B-0041)
TO BUCK THE CORPORATIONS THAT ARE IN FACT FEEDING FEEDING THE TROUGH AS THEY SAY  (fe_03_01976-B-0042)

THEY ALSO I THINK WOULD HAVE TO USE IN ADDITION TO IT A BIT OF A CARROT  (fe_03_01976-B-0048)
I MEAN ETHICS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO TEACH  (fe_03_01976-B-0049)
AND I'M NOT TOO SURE GRADUATE SCHOOLS AH SUCH AS AH THE ONE WE HAVE HERE IN TOWN AT O._G._S._M. AT VANDERVILLE FOR EXAMPLE  (fe_03_01976-B-0050)
IT IS THEY HAVE RECENTLY STARTED TEACHING ETHICS BUT  (fe_03_01976-B-0051)
I'M NOT TOO SURE THAT YOU CAN LEGISLATE UM BAD BEHAVIOR BUT YOU CAN APPLY  (fe_03_01976-B-0052)
INSTEAD OF THE CARROT THE STICK IN THE SENSE THAT IF ENOUGH PEOPLE WERE LOCKED UP IN PRISONS  (fe_03_01976-B-0053)
RATHER THAN THE TREATMENT THAT IS NORMALLY HANDED OUT TO PEOPLE FROM A CERTAIN ECONOMIC GROUP DARE I SAY CLASS BECAUSE SOMEONE MIGHT SUGGEST THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT CLASS WARFARE UM  (fe_03_01976-B-0054)
BUT BUT I HAVE SEEN THIS I SAW IT AT EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE WHEN I WAS STATIONED THERE THERE WAS A FEDERAL PRISON ON EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE AND YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT I'VE ALSO BEEN AT MAXWELL AIR FORCE BASE IN MONTGOMERY ALABAMA  (fe_03_01976-B-0055)
