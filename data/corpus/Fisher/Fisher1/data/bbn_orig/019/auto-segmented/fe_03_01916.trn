EXACTLY  (fe_03_01916-A-0045)
AND UH YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH I MAKE MISTAKES IN MY LIFE  (fe_03_01916-A-0046)
MY PARENTS MAKE SURE AND TELL ME THAT THEY STILL LOVE ME AND THEY'RE HERE FOR ME NO MATTER WHAT  (fe_03_01916-A-0047)
AND THAT'S JUST GREAT  (fe_03_01916-A-0048)
IF I COULD CHANGE ONE THING ABOUT MY  (fe_03_01916-A-0049)
NO I'LL MAKE THIS A QUESTION IF YOU GUYS COULD CHANGE ONE THING ABOUT YOUR FAMILIES WHAT WOULD YOU CHANGE AND WHY HM  (fe_03_01916-A-0050)
MY UNCLE'S A FASCIST  (fe_03_01916-A-0051)

YOU'RE FRUSTRATED WITH YOUR REPUBLICAN RELATIVES IN TEXAS  (fe_03_01916-A-0053)
REALLY I WISH THAT YOU HAD A BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR WITH YOUR RELATIVES I THINK  (fe_03_01916-A-0054)
THAT'S KINDA TOO BAD I KIND OF LIKE IT WHEN MY RELATIVES AREN'T AREN'T OF A SIMILAR POLITICAL VIEW BECAUSE  (fe_03_01916-A-0055)
IT MAKES FOR SOME INTERESTING CONVERSATION AND DEBATE  (fe_03_01916-A-0056)

I'M SORRY  (fe_03_01916-A-0062)
SO SAM IF YOU COULD CHANGE ONE THING ABOUT YOUR FAMILY WHAT WOULD YOU CHANGE AND WHY  (fe_03_01916-A-0063)
WELL I WOULD START BY GOING BACK IN TIME TO WHEN I WAS A REBELLIOUS AH SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD AND I WOULD REALLY TRY AND APPRECIATE MY PARENTS MORE AND UH  (fe_03_01916-A-0064)
YOU KNOW 'CAUSE SOMETIMES THEY WOULD DO STUFF THAT REALLY PISSED ME OFF BUT IN RETROSPECT  (fe_03_01916-A-0065)
MOST OF THE TIME IT WAS IN MY BEST INTEREST [MN] THAT'S  (fe_03_01916-A-0066)
ORIGINALLY YEAH I MEAN I PROBABLY WOULDN'T EITHER BUT UH  (fe_03_01916-A-0070)
YOU KNOW I THINK I GAVE MY PARENTS A LOT OF UNNECESSARY GRIEF  (fe_03_01916-A-0071)

I'M COMING TO THAT POINT IN MY LIFE WHERE I VIEW THEM NOT ONLY AS PARENTS BUT FRIENDS AS WELL AND I CAN SEE UH  (fe_03_01916-A-0073)
A LOT OF MY OWN STUPIDITY IN GROWING UP AND AND I CAN APPRECIATE THEIR THEIR LOVE AND GRACE A LOT MORE NOW  (fe_03_01916-A-0074)
WHEN I ORIGINALLY POSED THIS QUESTION MY ANSWER WAS GOING TO BE THAT I WISHED THAT MY DAD COULD BREATH  (fe_03_01916-A-0075)
