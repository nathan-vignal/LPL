YES  (fe_03_01988-A-0003)
AND IS THIS YOUR FIRST TIME IN THE STUDY  (fe_03_01988-A-0004)
OH WE HAVE QUITE A TOPIC HERE TODAY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE CORPORATE  (fe_03_01988-A-0005)
ILLEGAL ACTIVITY  (fe_03_01988-A-0006)
WHAT DO YOU THINK OUR GOVERNMENT CAN DO TO HELP POLICE THE CORPORATE ACTIVITY  (fe_03_01988-A-0007)
DO YOU THINK HIGH COLLAR BLUE COLLAR WHITE COLLAR CRIME HAS RISEN IN THE PAST FEW YEARS  (fe_03_01988-A-0008)
HAS IT RISEN  (fe_03_01988-A-0009)
OR HAVE WE JUST BEEN MORE  (fe_03_01988-A-0010)
SO WE'VE JUST BEEN MORE AWARE OF IT NOW  (fe_03_01988-A-0011)
HAS IT AFFECTED YOU PERSONALLY  (fe_03_01988-A-0012)
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK WE AS AS A GENERAL PUBLIC CAN DO  (fe_03_01988-A-0013)
DO YOU DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BOYCOTT CERTAIN COMPANIES THAT HAVE HAD THE PROBLEM  (fe_03_01988-A-0014)
AND IS THAT A RESPONSIBILITY OF OUR GOVERNMENT  (fe_03_01988-A-0015)
[MN] SO I THINK I THINK PERSONALLY THAT IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME IT'S JUST THAT WE'RE MORE AWARE OF IT NOW  (fe_03_01988-A-0016)
AND WE'VE JUST WE'RE JUST BECOMING MORE AWARE OF IT NOW DUE TO THE DIFFERENT MEDIA THAT WASN'T ALWAYS AVAILABLE IN THE PAST  (fe_03_01988-A-0017)
I DEFINITELY FEEL THAT'S AN ISSUE I DON'T THINK THAT I I THINK THAT WE HAVE SEEN PERHAPS RISING COSTS BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE ISSUES  (fe_03_01988-A-0018)
YES  (fe_03_01988-A-0021)
THAT I THINK THAT'S A VERY BIG ISSUE  (fe_03_01988-A-0022)
AND THE COST HAS PASSED DOWN TO US SO WE HAVE SEEN IT FROM THAT END OF IT ALSO  (fe_03_01988-A-0023)
I ALSO THINK PERHAPS THAT  (fe_03_01988-A-0024)
WE DON'T DO ENOUGH  (fe_03_01988-A-0025)
I DON'T KNOW PER SE WHAT WE COULD DO TO CHANGE IT [NOISE] BUT I THINK PERHAPS THAT WE  (fe_03_01988-A-0026)
GENERAL BIG BUSINESS GETS AWAY WITH TOO MUCH  (fe_03_01988-A-0027)
AND I DON'T THINK THEY PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE OF THE TAXES I THINK THAT WE NEED TO MAKE THE GENERAL BUSINESSES AND BIG BUSINESSES MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAIR SHARE OF TAXES RATHER THAN THE BRUNT BEING TO THE WORKING PERSON  (fe_03_01988-A-0028)
SO I'M TRYING TO SEE I I'M NOT SURE  (fe_03_01988-A-0029)
WHERE WE COULD DO THIS BUT IF IF THE TAX PAYS LINE UP  (fe_03_01988-A-0030)
AND THEY WERE HELD MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IN TIME I DON'T THINK THAT NECESSARILY THAT THEY ARE BEING HELD RESPONSIBLE  (fe_03_01988-A-0031)
IT'S ALWAYS BEING PASSED DOWN TO A DIFFERENT PERSON  (fe_03_01988-A-0033)
WHEREAS THE TRUE CULPRIT RESPONSIBLE IS NOT BEING IS NOT BEING GIVEN THE BRUNT OF THE PUNISHMENT  (fe_03_01988-A-0034)
I THINK PERHAPS THAT WE SEE  (fe_03_01988-A-0035)
YES  (fe_03_01988-A-0036)
WELL THAT'S OKAY WE ALL HAVE TO DO OUR DUTY [LAUGHTER] [MN]  (fe_03_01988-A-0038)
YEAH I DON'T KNOW I THINK  (fe_03_01988-A-0039)
I DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW HOW SPECIFIC WE CAN MAKE CHANGES BUT I DO THINK THAT IT IT IS AN ISSUE IN OUR ECONOMY TODAY DO YOU FEEL THAT THE ECONOMY HAS TAKEN A A DOWNWARD TREND BECAUSE OF SOME OF THESE ISSUES  (fe_03_01988-A-0040)
YEAH  (fe_03_01988-A-0041)
YES I DO I THINK THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO UH YOU KNOW PULL THESE PEOPLE OUT BUT AT THE SAME POINT IN TIME I I ALSO THINK THAT THE CORPORATIONS THAT ARE THE WORST OFFENDERS ARE BEING  (fe_03_01988-A-0042)
THEY'RE GIVEN MORE LENIENCY  (fe_03_01988-A-0043)
AND I DON'T THINK IT IT'S NECESSARILY A STRONG DETERRENT FOR THEM  (fe_03_01988-A-0044)
AND I ALSO SEE THAT PERHAPS THEY'RE HAVING EACH CORPORATION IS USING WHAT IS YOU KNOW CALLED A CALLED A SCAPE GOAT WHERE THE TRUE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DECISION MAKING ARE NOT PAYING THE PRICE  (fe_03_01988-A-0045)
NO I DON'T KNOW DO YOU THINK IT CAN STOP  (fe_03_01988-A-0046)
I MEAN IF IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE  (fe_03_01988-A-0047)
AND DO YOU THINK DO YOU HAVE YOU SEEN PUNISHMENTS THAT FIT THE CRIME RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_01988-A-0048)
[NOISE] DO YOU THINK THE PUNISHMENTS WILL BE A STRONG DETERRENT FOR THEM  (fe_03_01988-A-0049)
YEAH I DON'T BELIEVE THEY'RE GOING TO BE A LIST OUT BUT I THINK I MEAN I THINK WE CAN STOP SOME OF IT BUT I DO THINK THAT THE MAJORITY IS UNDER THE TABLE AND THE POCKET BOOKS ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE BIG ENOUGH AND HUMAN NATURE BEING WHAT WE ARE THERE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOMEBODY WILLING TO ACCEPT MONEY FOR  (fe_03_01988-A-0051)
A WRONG DEED  (fe_03_01988-A-0052)
YES AND I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AND AND I MEAN I DON'T THINK THAT WE CAN EVER GET RID OF THAT INNATE GREED THAT PEOPLE HAVE  (fe_03_01988-A-0053)
AND IT'S NOT EVERYONE BUT THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE GENERAL POPULATION THAT'S GOING TO HAVE IT  (fe_03_01988-A-0054)
I THINK WE COULD CUT DOWN ON THAT BUT I I DON'T SEE IT DISAPPEARING AS A WHOLE IN THE FUTURE I THINK IT'S SOMETHING [NOISE] WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO DEAL WITH  (fe_03_01988-A-0055)
STREISAND [NOISE]  (fe_03_01988-A-0056)
OH MARTHA MARTHA YEAH  (fe_03_01988-A-0057)

RIGHT IS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME PROVING [NOISE]  (fe_03_01988-A-0059)
I THINK THAT IS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE IS THAT SOME OF THESE CRIMES ARE GOING TO BE UNPROVABLE  (fe_03_01988-A-0060)
[NOISE]  (fe_03_01988-A-0061)
AND THAT IS AN ISSUE  (fe_03_01988-A-0062)
