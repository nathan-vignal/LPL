I GUESS UH  (fe_03_01911-B-0048)
I GREW UP WITH MOM DAD BROTHER PRETTY STANDARD BUT I MOVED OUT UM WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN AND LIVED WITH ANOTHER FAMILY THAT I'M STILL CLOSER  (fe_03_01911-B-0049)
AND THEN WHEN I KINDA GREW UP A LITTLE UM I MOVED BACK AFTER HIGH SCHOOL  (fe_03_01911-B-0050)
AS AN ADULT AND UM WE WERE ABLE TO KINDA FORGE A RELATIONSHIP AS ADULTS AND WE WORK MUCH BETTER LIKE THAT AND  (fe_03_01911-B-0051)
SO NOW THEY'RE A HUGE SUPPORT FOR ME AND  (fe_03_01911-B-0052)
SO I HAVE A LOT OF FAMILY I HAVE TWO LARGE FAMILIES PLUS I KIND OF CONSIDER  (fe_03_01911-B-0053)
THE PEOPLE THAT I'VE ADOPTED INTO MY LIFE  (fe_03_01911-B-0054)
TO BE MY FAMILY AS WELL SO LOTS OF FRIENDS THAT I'VE HAD THAT I  (fe_03_01911-B-0055)
CONSIDER ALMOST MY BLOOD  (fe_03_01911-B-0056)
SO I HAVE A PRETTY LOOSE DEFINITION OF FAMILY ACTUALLY [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01911-B-0057)

RIGHT UM  (fe_03_01911-B-0060)
YEAH WELL I WOULD SAY THAT UM  (fe_03_01911-B-0061)
NO I MEAN I THINK THAT ECONOMICS DON'T HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH A FAMILY I THINK THAT IF YOU'RE LIVING IN POVERTY YOU HAVE A LOT IT'S A LOT HARDER YOU HAVE A LOT MORE STRESSES  (fe_03_01911-B-0062)
AND SO YOUR FAMILY MIGHT GET  (fe_03_01911-B-0063)
LIKE TRIED MORE OFTEN  (fe_03_01911-B-0064)
BUT I THINK ALSO FOR SOME FAMILIES UM THAT'S WHAT BRINGS THEM CLOSE TOGETHER YOU KNOW THAT SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE IN A REALLY DIFFICULT SITUATION YOU HAVE TO KIND OF BOND TOGETHER WITH THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU  (fe_03_01911-B-0065)
SO I THINK THAT  (fe_03_01911-B-0066)
I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENCES FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN DIFFERENT CLASSES BUT I DON'T THINK  (fe_03_01911-B-0067)
IT NECESSARILY MAKES A BETTER FAMILY OR NOT  (fe_03_01911-B-0068)
THE WEALTHY  (fe_03_01911-B-0069)
I I GUESS I WOULD SAY THE EXACT SAME THING YOU KNOW I THINK THAT UM  (fe_03_01911-B-0070)
MONEY MAKES THINGS LOGISTICALLY EASIER BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN PARENTS ARE GOING TO BE AROUND IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE GONNA SPEND TIME TOGETHER IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE NOT SHIPPING KIDS OUT YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01911-B-0071)
TO THE WITH THE NANNY OR WHATEVER [LAUGHTER] SO UM I  (fe_03_01911-B-0072)
SO HOW ABOUT YOU  (fe_03_01911-B-0074)

YEAH I GUESS YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING SAY YOU KNOW I THINK THAT IN SOME CASES IT'S REALLY TRUE  (fe_03_01911-B-0078)
I MEAN IN OTHER CASES I THINK THAT ONE OF THE REASONS WE PROBABLY THINK THAT IS WE THINK OF LIKE AMERICA AS LIKE THE WE THINK OF LIKE MIDDLE CLASS AS LIKE MAINSTREAM  (fe_03_01911-B-0079)
YOU KNOW AND I JUST TRY I HEARD A STATISTIC RECENTLY THAT UM APPARENTLY ONLY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE FAMILIES  (fe_03_01911-B-0080)
ARE TRADITIONAL FAMILIES IN THE UNITED STATES SO MEANING THAT ONLY SEVEN PERCENT OF ALL FAMILIES ARE A MO- MOTHER FATHER  (fe_03_01911-B-0081)
A MARRIED HETEROSEXUAL UM LIVING TOGETHER NON DIVORCED FAMILY  (fe_03_01911-B-0082)
