GOVERNMENT'S INVOLVEMENT AND PRIVATE CORPORATIONS  (fe_03_01978-A-0016)
TO BALANCE  (fe_03_01978-A-0017)

BECAUSE WE'RE SO TIGHTLY REGULATED WE'RE GETTING AUDITED ALL THE TIME AND YOU KNOW THAT'S ALL BASED ON ON SITUATIONS LIKE ENRON  (fe_03_01978-A-0036)

OTHER AREAS OF MANAGEMENT IN MANAGING THE COMPANY EVEN IF IT IS THE C._F._O.  (fe_03_01978-A-0044)

I THINK IT'S TOO DIFFICULT BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE DAY TO DAY DAILY OPERATIONS IN RUNNING  (fe_03_01978-A-0047)
YOU KNOW THE NUMBERS FOR LAST MONTH I MEAN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT THEMSELVES SO HOW IT'S IT'S TREMENDOUS PRESSURE I THINK ON THEM IF THEY HAVE TO SAY YEAH I GUARANTEE THAT EVERYTHING'S RIGHT EVEN IF IT'S YOU KNOW THAT I MEAN HOW COULD THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN'T  (fe_03_01978-A-0048)

YOU KNOW I MEAN I THINK OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS YOU KNOW THERE ARE FOLKS ON WALL STREET THAT HAVE SORT OF INFLATED EXPECTATIONS ABOUT COMPANIES  (fe_03_01978-B-0012)
AND YOU KNOW THERE WAS A COUPLE OF YEARS THERE WHERE THERE WAS WHERE INVESTMENT BANKERS WERE PRETTY MUCH COMMITTING FRAUD  (fe_03_01978-B-0013)
IN SORT OF THE WAY THEY STRUCTURED DEALS AND AH AND YOU KNOW THAT PUMPED UP THE STOCK MARKET BUT MAYBE THAT A LOT OF THAT WAS JUST SORT OF FAKE VALUE  (fe_03_01978-B-0015)
AND YOU KNOW AND HOPEFULLY THE GOVERNMENT WILL AH  (fe_03_01978-B-0017)
GO AFTER  (fe_03_01978-B-0019)
THE INVESTMENT BANKERS AND C._E._O.S THAT ARE UM COMMITTING ACCOUNTING FRAUD AND ALL THAT STUFF  (fe_03_01978-B-0020)
YEAH I'M AH  (fe_03_01978-B-0022)
I I THINK YOU KNOW THAT'S THE SORT OF AH SCANDALS IN THE SENSE THAT YOU KNOW THEY UM  (fe_03_01978-B-0023)
THAT A LOT OF VALUE WAS LOST AND A LOT OF AH MONEY WAS SORT OF TAKEN AWAY FROM SMALL INVESTORS AND AND AH PUT IN  (fe_03_01978-B-0024)
YOU KNOW INVESTMENT BANKERS' POCKETS  (fe_03_01978-B-0025)
IS IS NOT A GOOD THING YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01978-B-0026)
YEAH  (fe_03_01978-B-0028)
YEAH I THINK A A LOT OF IT IS AH ACCOUNTING ISSUES AND UM YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW THERE  (fe_03_01978-B-0029)
THERE USED TO BE VERY LITTLE GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS YOU KNOW THERE WAS AH THE FEDERAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD OR THE AND THERE WAS  (fe_03_01978-B-0030)
SOME PRIVATE SORT OF INDUSTRY ACCOUNTING BOARDS THAT MONITORED SORT OF HOW  (fe_03_01978-B-0031)
HOW ACCOUNTANTS YOU KNOW HOW SO YOU KNOW WHEN A COMPANY MAKES MAKES A CONTRACT WITH A OR SELLS SOME SERVICES THEY CAN EITHER BOOK IT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01978-B-0032)
I MEAN A LOT OF THIS STUFF CAME FROM THE COMPANIES BOOKING AH PROFITS YOU KNOW NOW WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BOOKED THEM OVER TWENTY YEARS  (fe_03_01978-B-0033)
SO THEIR BALANCE STATEMENTS LOOKED LOOKED A LOT BETTER TO INVESTORS BUT IT THE SO THAT THEIR STOCK PRICE WENT UP AND THEY MADE A LOT MONEY MORE MONEY OFF THEIR STOCK OPTIONS BUT THE REALITY WAS THAT THEY  (fe_03_01978-B-0034)
WERE SORT OF THOSE WERE ARTIFICIAL ACCOUNTING ENTRIES BECAUSE THEY THEY WEREN'T ACTUALLY GOING TO GET THE MONEY FOR YOU KNOW UNLESS IT WAS OVER TWENTY YEARS  (fe_03_01978-B-0035)
AND THE ACCOUNTING INDUSTRY I THINK WAS SORT OF COMPLICIT IN A LOT OF THAT SORT OF  (fe_03_01978-B-0036)
SORT OF LOOSE STANDARDS THAT THAT AH WERE OUT THERE  (fe_03_01978-B-0037)
SO SO RIGHT NOW I GUESS UM  (fe_03_01978-B-0038)
YOU KNOW WITH WITH SARBANES OXLEY WITH LEGISLATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT PASSED AND UM  (fe_03_01978-B-0039)
WITH SARBANES OXLEY THERE'S SORT OF THIS NEW ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD THAT AH  (fe_03_01978-B-0040)
WHICH A FEW PEOPLE WERE JUST APPOINTED TO  (fe_03_01978-B-0041)
WELL I I'M NOT SURE I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S CALLED BUT THERE'S UM THERE IT'S SORT OF PART IT'S SORT OF UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE COMMISSION THERE'S THERE'S THIS ACCOUNTING BOARD THAT'S GONNA THAT'S GONNA HAVE SOME OVERSIGHTS SORT OF OVER  (fe_03_01978-B-0042)
OVER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOW AND THERE'S SO THAT ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS IS WHETHER OR NOT  (fe_03_01978-B-0043)
AH COMPANIES SHOULD  (fe_03_01978-B-0044)
HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR STOCK OPTIONS  (fe_03_01978-B-0045)
LIKE WHEN THEY LIKE WHEN A C._E._O. GETS A HUNDRED MILLION OF STOCK OPTIONS NOW  (fe_03_01978-B-0046)
YOU KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE TO PUT THAT ON THE BALANCE SHEET SO INVESTORS SO INVESTORS DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_01978-B-0047)
YOU KNOW HOW  (fe_03_01978-B-0048)
SO A COMPANY COULD BE MAKING YOU KNOW HAVE TWENTY MILLION IN PROFITS BUT BE PAYING OFF THIRTY MILLION TO C._E._O.S IN THE FORM OF STOCK OPTIONS AND UM SO  (fe_03_01978-B-0049)
RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_01978-B-0051)
RIGHT NOW NOTHING'S HAPPENED ABOUT THAT SO I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM YOU KNOW AH  (fe_03_01978-B-0052)
FORCE THESE COMPANIES TO ACCOUNT FOR STOCK OPTIONS AND BUT I MEAN THERE'S THE CONCERN OF THE GOVERNMENT GETTING TOO INVOLVED YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01978-B-0053)
MHM  (fe_03_01978-B-0057)
YEAH I GUESS SO I MEAN I'VE READ A FEW ARTICLES SAYING THAT SORT OF THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS OF THESE BIG PUBLIC COMPANIES THEIR JOBS ARE ARE LIKE THREE TIMES AS HARD AS THEY WERE BEFORE SARBANES OXLEY 'CAUSE AH  (fe_03_01978-B-0059)
THEY HAVE TO PERSONALLY CERTIFY THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER SORT OF PENALTY OF GOING TO PRISON OR FACING BIG FINES AND THAT WASN'T THE CASE  (fe_03_01978-B-0060)
SORT OF PRIOR TO SARBANES OXLEY SO THEY THEY REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY GET IT RIGHT AND THE PROBLEM IS WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  (fe_03_01978-B-0061)
YOU KNOW PEOPLE THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT ARE SORT OF QUESTIONABLE THERE'S NO ACCOUNTING ISN'T CLEAR AT ALL YOU KNOW BECAUSE BECAUSE UM  (fe_03_01978-B-0062)
ITEMS OF INCOME AND AH ASSETS THAT YOU KNOW ARE  (fe_03_01978-B-0064)
THERE'S SORT OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU CAN VALUE THEM AND SEVERAL OF THEM ARE SORT OF ACCEPTABLE UNDER BUSINESS PRACTICES SO SO SARBANES OXLEY IT'S SORT OF IT'S COME IN THERE BUT IT'S CREATED A LOT OF CONFUSION FOR AH C._F._O.S BECAUSE THEY  (fe_03_01978-B-0065)
YOU KNOW THEY THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE GETTING IT RIGHT BUT IT'S UM IT'S NOT REALLY  (fe_03_01978-B-0066)
YOU KNOW AND A PART OF IT IS ENRON WORLDCOM AND A FEW OTHER COMPANIES ARE SORT OF YOU KNOW THEY'RE BAD ACTORS AND AH  (fe_03_01978-B-0067)
I THINK MOST PEOPLE MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT MOST COMPANIES ARE NOT TRYING TO ENGAGE IN THOSE SORT OF AH  (fe_03_01978-B-0068)
YOU KNOW SCHEMES SO IT'S IT'S A SHAME THAT AH YOU KNOW THAT MORE HONEST FINANCIAL OFFICERS ARE HAVING TO  (fe_03_01978-B-0069)
YOU KNOW DEAL WITH THE FALLOUT FROM ENRON BUT UM  (fe_03_01978-B-0070)
YEAH I I'M GLAD I DON'T I MEAN  (fe_03_01978-B-0072)
A LOT LESS PEOPLE WANT TO BE AH I THINK WANT TO BE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS BECAUSE  (fe_03_01978-B-0073)
JUST BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH I MEAN THERE'S A THAT SORT OF  (fe_03_01978-B-0075)
THEY'RE I GUESS AH I MEAN SOME PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT SORT OF MAYBE A PROGRESSION OVER THE PAST MAYBE YOU KNOW WHAT TEN OR TWENTY YEARS OF AH OF IMPOSING A LOT MORE CRIMINAL LIABILITY ON AH CORPORATIONS  (fe_03_01978-B-0076)
AND THEY'RE SORT OF THE DIRECTION HAS YOU KNOW HAS BEEN TOWARDS MAKING AH MAKING A LOT OF THINGS CRIMES THAT PR- THAT PREVIOUSLY WOULD OF BEEN YOU KNOW YOU WOULD OF WOULD OF BEEN SUBJECT TO DAMAGES AND CIVIL FINES  (fe_03_01978-B-0077)
