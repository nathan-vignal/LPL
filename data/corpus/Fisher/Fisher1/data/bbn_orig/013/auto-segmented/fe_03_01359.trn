I UNDERSTAND  (fe_03_01359-A-0009)
OH YOU DON'T I'M SORRY  (fe_03_01359-A-0010)
TH- THE QUESTION WAS SHOULD PUBLIC SCHOOLS BE ABLE TO CENSOR BOOKS  (fe_03_01359-A-0011)
OKAY I DON'T EITHER  (fe_03_01359-A-0012)
WELL  (fe_03_01359-A-0013)
I DON'T THINK SO BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T THINK  (fe_03_01359-A-0014)
CERTAIN LIKE ADULT MATERIAL OF A BOOK SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO MY CHILD AT SCHOOL EITHER  (fe_03_01359-A-0015)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_01359-A-0016)
EXACTLY AND THEN THERE'S ALWAYS THE DIFFICULT DECISION YOU HAVE SOCIAL MORALITY YOU KNOW BECAUSE WHAT'S PORNOGRAPHIC TO JOE DOWN THE STREET ISN'T NECESSARILY PORNOGRAPHIC TO SOMEONE ELSE  (fe_03_01359-A-0017)
THAT'S RIDICULOUS  (fe_03_01359-A-0018)

YEP I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA IS JUST HAVING THE A CENTRAL  (fe_03_01359-A-0034)
SCHOOL BOARD OR COMMITTEE THAT'S VOTED UPON AND THEY CAN OVERSEE BOOKS THAT ARE IN QUESTION BUT IN GENERAL I THINK IT'S BETTER JUST TO [COUGH] HAVE CENSORSHIP IN THE FAMILY RIGHT I MEAN YOU  (fe_03_01359-A-0035)
[NOISE]  (fe_03_01359-A-0036)

TRUE  (fe_03_01359-A-0038)
YEAH WELL AND I'M SURE SOME INDIVIDUALS FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT CERTAIN BOOKS AND THEY'D NEVER EVER GIVE IN SO THERE NEEDS TO BE AN OUTLET TO YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01359-A-0039)
IF THEY DON'T WANT THEIR CHILD EXPOSED TO THAT THEY SIMPLY NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE THAT THEIR CHILD DOESN'T GET EXPOSED TO THAT YOU KNOW AND THEY I MEAN THERE'S THINGS ALL AROUND LIFE YOUR CHILDREN NEED TO REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T BE GUARDED AWAY FROM EVERYTHING YOU JUST NEED TO LEARN ON YOUR OWN THAT THAT'S APPROPRIATE AND THAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE  (fe_03_01359-A-0040)

UTAH SO THIS IS ALL THE WAY OUT IN UTAH  (fe_03_01359-B-0004)
SO DID YOU CATCH THAT TOPIC  (fe_03_01359-B-0005)
IT WAS ABOUT SCHOOL I COULDN'T QUITE HEAR IT  (fe_03_01359-B-0006)
AH YEAH OKAY I COULDN'T HEAR ALL THE REST OF IT MY FAMILY HAD THE T._V. ON TOO LOUD AND I WAS HEADING FOR ANOTHER ROOM BUT I DIDN'T MAKE IT  (fe_03_01359-B-0007)
NO I DON'T  (fe_03_01359-B-0008)
I DON'T  (fe_03_01359-B-0009)
BOOKS I DON'T THINK SO  (fe_03_01359-B-0010)
I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT AT ALL  (fe_03_01359-B-0011)
WELL THERE IS CERTAIN THINGS LIKE I WOULD SAY LIKE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY PORNOGRAPHIC BOOKS AND CRAP THEY SHOULDN'T BE READING THAT  (fe_03_01359-B-0012)
BUT THEN AGAIN WHO DECIDES WHAT'S PORNOGRAPHIC AND WHAT'S NOT  (fe_03_01359-B-0013)
THAT'S THE PROBLEM  (fe_03_01359-B-0014)
YEAH AND THERE'S PLACES THAT THEY HAD BOOKS LIKE TOM SAWYER BEING BANNED  (fe_03_01359-B-0015)
BECAUSE THEY HAD THE N. WORD IN THEM WELL GOD THAT WAS WRITTEN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO WHAT DO YOU WANT  (fe_03_01359-B-0016)
THAT WOULD BE THE DIFFICULT DECISION I SUPPOSE  (fe_03_01359-B-0017)
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE PRUDES OUT THERE THAT WANT EVERY LITTLE THING AND THEY'RE ONLY GONNA BE READING GOLDI- GOLDILOCKS THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES  (fe_03_01359-B-0018)
AND YOU GOT PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT DON'T CARE WHAT THEY READ AND THEY'RE GONNA BE READING STUFF THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE SEEING  (fe_03_01359-B-0019)
WELL I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU LIVE YOU KNOW I THINK DOWN SOUTH THEY'RE MORE TENDING TO  (fe_03_01359-B-0020)
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY PRUDISHNESS AND THEY'RE GO- THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BLOCK MORE THINGS THAN THEY ARE UP NORTH  (fe_03_01359-B-0021)

I DON'T KNOW PRUDISH [LAUGHTER] I GUESS IT'S THE ONLY GOOD WORD FOR IT  (fe_03_01359-B-0023)
UM  (fe_03_01359-B-0024)
YEAH I GUESS WITHIN REASON BECAUSE I GUESS IF YOU'RE LIVING IN A CERTAIN SECTION OF THE COUNTRY AND THEY REALLY REALLY DESPISE  (fe_03_01359-B-0025)
CERTAIN TYPES OF BOOKS IF THEY ALL VOTE ON IT AND THAT'S THE WAY IT OUGHTA BE I SUPPOSE  (fe_03_01359-B-0026)
BUT THERE SHOULDN'T BE LIKE A I DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD BE LIKE A NATIONAL BOARD OF STANDARDS OR SOMETHING  (fe_03_01359-B-0027)
BECAUSE THEN AGAIN IT'S LIKE YOU'RE DECIDING FOR ONE SECTION OF THE COUNTRY THAT'S GONNA HAVE DIFFERENT VALUES THAN ANOTHER SECTION OF THE COUNTRY AND THERE'S JUST GONNA BE BIG ARGUMENTS OVER IT  (fe_03_01359-B-0028)
YEAH THAT TOO AND I SUPPOSE THERE WOULD BE LIKE IF YOU HAD  (fe_03_01359-B-0029)
A REALLY BACKWARDS SCHOOL SYSTEM WHICH OBVIOUSLY THERE'S GONNA BE A FEW AND THEY WERE VOTING OUT ALL SORTS OF BOOKS RIGHT AND LEFT THERE SHOULD BE LIKE A STATE REVIEW BOARD THAT YOU IF YOU WERE AS A PARENT COULD APPEAL IT TO IF YOU WANTED TO  (fe_03_01359-B-0030)
BECAUSE THERE IS GONNA THAT IS GONNA HAPPEN TOO  (fe_03_01359-B-0031)
THERE'S ALSO UM THE SCHOOLS COULD MAKE ALLOWANCES YOU KNOW READ THIS BOOK OR THIS BOOK  (fe_03_01359-B-0032)
HAVE A COUPLE OF LISTS NOT JUST LIKE WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL IT WAS LIKE READ THIS BOOK WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT  (fe_03_01359-B-0033)
