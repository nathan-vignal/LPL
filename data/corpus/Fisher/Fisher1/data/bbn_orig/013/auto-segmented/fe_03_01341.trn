HI THIS IS STEPHANIE  (fe_03_01341-A-0001)
UM WELL [LAUGHTER] I UM MY FIRST INCLINATION IS TO SAY NO  (fe_03_01341-A-0002)
I DON'T THINK THAT THEY CAN BORROW IT BUT I DON'T THINK THEY CAN ENFORCE IT EITHER I DON'T THINK THEY CAN MAKE SOMEONE READ A BOOK  (fe_03_01341-A-0003)
FOR LIKE RELIGIOUS REASONS OR OTHERWISE  (fe_03_01341-A-0004)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01341-A-0005)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_01341-A-0006)
WELL THEY ALSO DIDN'T SAY IF IT WAS IN CLASS OR IF THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO CHECK A BOOK OUT FROM A LIBRARY  (fe_03_01341-A-0007)
OH REALLY  (fe_03_01341-A-0008)
WHAT IF IT WAS A AH RESEARCH ON THREE OR FOURTEEN YEAR OLD UM AND IT WAS A SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE BOOK AND THEY WOULDN'T ALLOW  (fe_03_01341-A-0009)
THEY BORROWED ALL THOSE BOOKS BECAUSE  (fe_03_01341-A-0010)
THEY SAID THEY CONTAINED  (fe_03_01341-A-0011)
THINGS  (fe_03_01341-A-0013)
WELL I THINK THAT WAS PART OF WELL AT LEAST FROM MY KNOWLEDGE OF UM  (fe_03_01341-A-0014)
WHY THEY DIDN'T WANT 'EM BANNED  (fe_03_01341-A-0015)
ALL MATERIAL FROM THE INTERNET  (fe_03_01341-A-0016)
BECAUSE ALL SEXUAL MATERIAL  (fe_03_01341-A-0017)
BECAUSE THINGS SITES LIKE THAT THAT WERE FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES WOULD BE BANNED AS WELL  (fe_03_01341-A-0018)
SO I'M I'M JUST THINKING THAT COULD BE APPLIED TO SCHOOLS UM  (fe_03_01341-A-0019)
WHAT IF THEY HAD A PARENTAL CONTROL ON WHO CAN CHECK OUT A BOOK  (fe_03_01341-A-0020)
AND SO IF THEY WANTED TO CHECK OUT LIKE HARRY 'CAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR RIGHT IF THEY BAN HARRY POTTER BUT WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE  (fe_03_01341-A-0021)
THIS IS A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD  (fe_03_01341-A-0022)
ELEVEN YEAR OLD  (fe_03_01341-A-0023)
RIGHT BECAUSE SOME  (fe_03_01341-A-0024)
SOME PARENTS MIGHT WANT NOT HARRY POTTER TO BE READ  (fe_03_01341-A-0025)
UM  (fe_03_01341-A-0026)
SO IN THAT SENSE I FEEL LIKE IT PROBABLY SHOULD BE MORE OF A PARENTAL CONTROL BASIS  (fe_03_01341-A-0027)
THAN AS A UM  (fe_03_01341-A-0028)
BAN FOR THE LIBRARIES BUT I ALSO DON'T THINK  (fe_03_01341-A-0029)
I FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW TEACHERS READING IN A CLASSROOM SETTING  (fe_03_01341-A-0030)
THEY I MEAN THEY'RE BASICALLY ALLOWED TO TEACH WHATEVER  (fe_03_01341-A-0031)
THEY FEEL IS NECESSARY MOST WOULDN'T TEACH A BOOK WITH SEXUAL  (fe_03_01341-A-0032)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01341-A-0034)
I'M  (fe_03_01341-A-0035)
NO [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01341-A-0036)
I AM REALLY YOUNG  (fe_03_01341-A-0037)
I'M TWENTY ONE  (fe_03_01341-A-0038)
OKAY  (fe_03_01341-A-0039)
WELL YEAH I'M NOT YOUNG ENOUGH [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01341-A-0040)
TO SAY YES EVERYTHING SHOULD BE ALLOWED BUT  (fe_03_01341-A-0041)
RIGHT AND A LOT OF THOSE PICTURES A LOT OF THOSE CLASSES ARE SCARE TACTICS I THINK WHICH WORK WELL  (fe_03_01341-A-0042)
[LAUGHTER] RIGHT  (fe_03_01341-A-0043)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01341-A-0044)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01341-A-0045)
[LAUGHTER] THANKS  (fe_03_01341-A-0046)
UM WHAT DO YOU THINK IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE FOR PRIVATE OR  (fe_03_01341-A-0047)
UM PUBLIC  (fe_03_01341-A-0048)
MHM  (fe_03_01341-A-0049)
YOU DO  (fe_03_01341-A-0050)
'CAUSE YOU'RE PAYING FOR THEM TO GO THERE  (fe_03_01341-A-0051)
THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE SOME PUBLIC SCHOOLS ACTUALLY HAVE MORE LEEWAY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE AS MANY STATE CONTROLS  (fe_03_01341-A-0053)
I MEAN PRIVATE SCHOOLS THAT'S WHAT I MEAN  (fe_03_01341-A-0054)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01341-A-0055)
BUT THEN  (fe_03_01341-A-0056)
SO LET'S JUST THEORETICALLY SAY THAT YOUR KIDS YOU WERE  (fe_03_01341-A-0057)
UM MUSLIM  (fe_03_01341-A-0058)
AND YOUR KIDS WENT TO A WANTED TO GO TO THAT PRIVATE CHRISTIAN SCHOOL BECAUSE THAT WAS A BETTER EDUCATION  (fe_03_01341-A-0059)
UM  (fe_03_01341-A-0060)
WOULD YOU SAY  (fe_03_01341-A-0061)
AND THEY HAD UM  (fe_03_01341-A-0062)
BIBLE READING IN THE MORNING  (fe_03_01341-A-0063)
WOULD WOULD THAT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU'D I MEAN DO YOU THINK THAT YOU COULD SAY THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT YOUR KIDS TO DO THAT  (fe_03_01341-A-0064)
RIGHT BUT IF IT WAS  (fe_03_01341-A-0065)
IMPOSED BY THE SCHOOL THAT THEY MANDATORILY HAD TO DO THAT  (fe_03_01341-A-0066)
MHM  (fe_03_01341-A-0067)
THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT  (fe_03_01341-A-0068)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01341-A-0069)
I AGREE IF IT'S NOT  (fe_03_01341-A-0070)
IF IT'S NOT MANDATED LIKE IF IT'S NOT YOU HAVE TO DO THAT THEN I FEEL THAT  (fe_03_01341-A-0071)
IF YOU DON'T ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN THEN YOU ARE INFRINGING ON  (fe_03_01341-A-0072)
YES  (fe_03_01341-A-0076)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01341-A-0077)
IN COLLEGE  (fe_03_01341-A-0078)
YEAH WE DO [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01341-A-0079)
REALLY  (fe_03_01341-A-0080)
THE LAST I DID ONE BEFORE AND IT WAS ON UM T._V. SHOWS OR THE  (fe_03_01341-A-0081)
LIKE WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND I DON'T WATCH T._V. SO [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01341-A-0082)
AND NEITHER DID THE LADY I WAS TALKING TO SO IT WAS A REALLY  (fe_03_01341-A-0083)
HI THIS IS CINDY  (fe_03_01341-B-0001)
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE SUBJECT  (fe_03_01341-B-0002)
I AGREE WITH THAT UM I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD BE  (fe_03_01341-B-0003)
CENSORING THINGS COMPLETELY BUT AT THE SAME TIME I WOULDN'T WANT MY NINE YEAR OLD READING A BOOK ABOUT SEX AT SCHOOL  (fe_03_01341-B-0004)
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN  (fe_03_01341-B-0005)
AND THEY DIDN'T SAY YOU KNOW SPECIFICALLY WHAT GRADE LEVEL  (fe_03_01341-B-0006)
SO  (fe_03_01341-B-0007)
YEAH  (fe_03_01341-B-0008)
KIND OF VAGUE THERE BUT UM  (fe_03_01341-B-0009)
I HAVE A NINE YEAR OLD AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD AND A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD AND THEY READ A VARIETY OF BOOKS THEY HAVE A REALLY BIG READING PROGRAM AT SCHOOL AND THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS HAVE BEEN CENSORED  (fe_03_01341-B-0010)
IN THEIR SCHOOL  (fe_03_01341-B-0011)
YEAH AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A BIT MUCH  (fe_03_01341-B-0012)
BEING THAT THEY ARE CHILDREN'S BOOKS  (fe_03_01341-B-0013)
SO I DON'T I DON'T AGREE WITH THE CENSORING THING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW TO THAT EXTENT BUT I GUESS ON ONE LEVEL LIKE I SAID AS FAR AS  (fe_03_01341-B-0014)
THE THINGS CONTAINING SEX IT'S A BIT MUCH  (fe_03_01341-B-0015)
I WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT HAVING A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD AND KIDS BECOMING SEXUALLY ACTIVE AT EARLIER AGES NOW  (fe_03_01341-B-0016)
I THINK IF THEY ARE GOING TO SIT DOWN AND DO RESEARCH ON IT THEN THAT MIGHT HELP THEM TO  (fe_03_01341-B-0017)
BE SAFE AND  (fe_03_01341-B-0018)
NOT END UP WITH SOME SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE I DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD BE CENSORED FROM THEM OR BE BARRED FROM THEM  (fe_03_01341-B-0019)
YEAH  (fe_03_01341-B-0020)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01341-B-0021)
YEAH  (fe_03_01341-B-0022)
RIGHT WELL MY DAUGHTER HAD PARTICIPATED IN A TEEN CHOICE GROUP  (fe_03_01341-B-0023)
AND SOME OF THE MATERIAL THE BOOKS THAT THEY WOULD BE READING AND STUDYING DURING THAT POINT  (fe_03_01341-B-0024)
BASICALLY  (fe_03_01341-B-0025)
THE SUBJECT WAS SEX HOW TO SAY NO YOU KNOW HOW TO AVOID IT HOW TO AVOID PEER PRESSURE AND THAT SORT OF THING AND WE HAD TO SIGN A PERMISSION SLIP TO ALLOW OUR CHILD TO VIEW THE MATERIAL  (fe_03_01341-B-0026)
AH ELEVEN YEAR OLD  (fe_03_01341-B-0027)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_01341-B-0028)
SO I THINK I AGREE WITH THAT IF IT'S PARENTAL CONTROLLED AND HAVE EACH INDIVIDUAL PARENT DECIDE WHETHER  (fe_03_01341-B-0029)
THEIR CHILD CAN VIEW IT OR NOT  (fe_03_01341-B-0030)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01341-B-0031)
I AGREE WITH THAT  (fe_03_01341-B-0032)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01341-B-0033)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01341-B-0034)
NOT IN AN ELEMENTARY SETTING YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID MY DAUGHTER IS ELEVEN SHE IS IN THE FIFTH GRADE AND  (fe_03_01341-B-0035)
THEY SENT A PERMISSION SLIP HOME AND OUT OF TWENTY TWO GIRLS IN THE CLASS THERE WERE ONLY TEN OF 'EM THAT WERE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE  (fe_03_01341-B-0036)
AND SOME OF THE OTHER PARENTS YOU KNOW IT WAS RELIGIOUS REGION- REASONS OR THEY THOUGHT THEIR CHILD WAS TOO YOUNG AND YOU KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO TEACH MY CHILD  (fe_03_01341-B-0037)
TO  (fe_03_01341-B-0038)
ABSTAIN FROM SEXUAL ACTIVITY AT ELEVEN YEARS OLD THEN I'M ALL FOR IT  (fe_03_01341-B-0039)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01341-B-0040)
DO YOU HAVE KIDS  (fe_03_01341-B-0041)
YOU SOUND REALLY YOUNG  (fe_03_01341-B-0042)
HOW OLD ARE YOU  (fe_03_01341-B-0043)
TWEN- I'M THIRTY ONE  (fe_03_01341-B-0044)
SO  (fe_03_01341-B-0045)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01341-B-0046)
WELL SEE THAT'S KINDA WHERE I'M COMING FROM BECAUSE I AT AGED TWENTY ONE ALREADY HAD TWO KIDS  (fe_03_01341-B-0047)
AND I THINK IF THOSE MATERIALS HAD BEEN AVAILABLE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER  (fe_03_01341-B-0048)
THEN I WOULD HAVE KNOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE  (fe_03_01341-B-0049)
DISCUSSING SEXUAL ACTIVITIES WAS NOT ALLOWED IN MY HOME  (fe_03_01341-B-0050)
SO  (fe_03_01341-B-0051)
YEAH YEAH WHEN YOU HAVE A GROUP OF ELEVEN YEAR OLD GIRLS GOING IN AND SAYING YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01341-B-0052)
YOU KISSED THIS BOY AND HE'S KISSED THIS GIRL AND SHE'S KISSED THIS GUY AND THIS GUY'S KISSED YOU KNOW YOU KISS HIM YOU'RE KISSING EVERYBODY ELSE  (fe_03_01341-B-0053)
THEY'VE BEEN KISSING AND MY DAUGHTER WAS LIKE MOM THAT'S GROSS  (fe_03_01341-B-0054)
YOU KNOW NOT TO MENTION  (fe_03_01341-B-0055)
AND THEY EVEN WENT INTO DETAIL ABOUT ABORTION AND ADOPTION AND THINGS LIKE THAT  (fe_03_01341-B-0056)
AND THE MATERIAL THAT THEY WENT OVER THE BOOKS AND THE PAPERWORK AND THINGS LIKE THAT SHE BROUGHT HOME AND WE WENT THROUGH AND DISCUSSED IT TOGETHER AND THEN AT THE END OF IT THEY HAD THE OPTION TO SIGN THE CARD PROMISING TO ABSTAIN FROM SEX UNTIL THEY WERE MARRIED  (fe_03_01341-B-0057)
OR NOT TO AND SHE SIGNED IT SO  (fe_03_01341-B-0058)
I HOPE THIS IS THE PROMISE YOU KNOW THAT SHE'D MAKE TO HERSELF AND TALK WITH HER FRIENDS ABOUT IT AND SHARE MATERIAL ABOUT IT YOU KNOW BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T WANT TO  (fe_03_01341-B-0059)
SHARE ANYTHING THAT ANOTHER PARENT IS GOING TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH  (fe_03_01341-B-0060)
YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF HARD DEALING WITH THAT  (fe_03_01341-B-0061)
SHE HAS ONE FRIEND THAT'S A CATHOLIC  (fe_03_01341-B-0062)
AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN  (fe_03_01341-B-0063)
SO  (fe_03_01341-B-0064)
AND AND I'M PRETTY OPEN WITH MY KIDS  (fe_03_01341-B-0065)
I DON'T WANT 'EM TO GO TO A STRANGER TO FIND OUT SOMETHING I'D RATHER THEY CAME TO ME IF THEY NEEDED HELP OR NEEDED INFORMATION OR WHAT NOT  (fe_03_01341-B-0066)
AND I THINK TO A POINT  (fe_03_01341-B-0067)
LIKE YOU SAID RESEARCH MATERIALS AND THINGS LIKE THAT I THINK IT SHOULD BE ALLOWED  (fe_03_01341-B-0068)
BUT I THINK TOO WITH A CERTAIN AGE GROUP  (fe_03_01341-B-0069)
AND BEYOND THAT I THINK THE PARENTAL CONSENT  (fe_03_01341-B-0070)
YOU'RE A PRETTY SMART COOKIE FOR A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD  (fe_03_01341-B-0071)
PRIVATE SCHOOL OR PUBLIC SCHOOL  (fe_03_01341-B-0072)
YEAH I THINK SO I THINK THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE 'CAUSE I MEAN IN  (fe_03_01341-B-0073)
YEAH AND IN THIS AREA ALL THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE CHRISTIAN SCHOOLS  (fe_03_01341-B-0074)
SO I'M  (fe_03_01341-B-0075)
THEY'VE MADE A BIG DEAL ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW THEIR KIDS' ACADEMIC IS SO MUCH BETTER BECAUSE THERE ARE NO BITS DEALING IN  (fe_03_01341-B-0076)
SEX OR EVIL OR VIOLENCE OR THINGS LIKE THAT  (fe_03_01341-B-0077)
YEAH  (fe_03_01341-B-0079)
WELL THESE I MEAN THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS HERE  (fe_03_01341-B-0080)
YEAH PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE HERE ARE CHRISTIAN BASED SO THAT'S DEALING WITH THE RELIGION  (fe_03_01341-B-0081)
THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE LEEWAY  (fe_03_01341-B-0082)
I DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT THE MUSLIM RELIGION BUT WE'RE PRETTY OPEN AND IF IT WERE SOMETHING THAT MY CHILD CHOSE TO PURSUE I MEAN THAT'S THEIR CHOICE  (fe_03_01341-B-0083)
THEY BELIEVE IN  (fe_03_01341-B-0084)
I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD MANDATORY ANY TYPE OF RELIGION I MEAN WE HAVE A LOT OF PARENTS HERE AT BENARMS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SAY THE  (fe_03_01341-B-0085)
THEY CAN'T PRAY  (fe_03_01341-B-0087)
BEFORE ANY SPORTING EVENTS  (fe_03_01341-B-0088)
BECAUSE IT VIOLATES THE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OF SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE  (fe_03_01341-B-0089)
AND I AGREE WITH THAT ON ONE LEVEL BECAUSE I WOULDN'T WANT SOMEONE OF A DIFFERENT RELIGION IMPOSING ON MINE  (fe_03_01341-B-0090)
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK IF IT'S DONE PRIVATELY AND QUIETLY AND  (fe_03_01341-B-0091)
THEN THEY CAN'T YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01341-B-0092)
YEAH  (fe_03_01341-B-0093)
SO  (fe_03_01341-B-0094)
ARE YOU  (fe_03_01341-B-0095)
ARE YOU IN COLLEGE  (fe_03_01341-B-0096)
YES  (fe_03_01341-B-0097)
WELL THAT'S GOOD  (fe_03_01341-B-0098)
YOU GET ALL KINDS OF RESEARCH MATERIAL HUH  (fe_03_01341-B-0099)
YEAH  (fe_03_01341-B-0100)
[LAUGHTER] THIS IS NEAT THIS IS THE FIRST ONE OF THESE I'VE DONE  (fe_03_01341-B-0101)
YEAH  (fe_03_01341-B-0102)
I DON'T WATCH MUCH EITHER  (fe_03_01341-B-0103)
