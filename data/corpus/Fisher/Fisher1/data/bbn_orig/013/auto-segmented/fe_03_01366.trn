YOU DO LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE I'VE HEARD OF SCHOOLS BANNING LIKE SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE AND SO WHAT SAY THE PARENTS ARE EDUCATING THEM WHAT THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT THE PARENTS STILL MAY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEM READING THAT MAGAZINE OR THAT BOOK DOES  (fe_03_01366-A-0010)
THAT MAKE SENSE  (fe_03_01366-A-0011)
[SIGH] I I DON'T KNOW I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD UM AND OF COURSE YOU WOULD LOVE TO HAVE PARENTS THAT ARE EDUCATED THEMSELVES AND HAVE A  (fe_03_01366-A-0013)
A UH A A BROAD OUT- YOU KNOW AN OUTLOOK ON LIFE OR ON EDUCATION BUT AT THE SAME TIME I I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS WHERE YOU'RE GONNA BE THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE PARENTS THAT ARE IGNORANT OR HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS THAN WHAT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM HAS  (fe_03_01366-A-0014)
SO TH- THAT'S GONNA PLAY A LOT INTO IT  (fe_03_01366-A-0015)
YEAH I THINK THE I THINK THE PERSONALLY I THINK THAT THE PARENTS WOULD HAVE A BIGGER PROBLEM WITH IT THAN A LOT OF THE KIDS AND THEIR PARENTS ARE GONNA BE THE ONE THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO COMPLAIN  (fe_03_01366-A-0016)
AND WHEN THEY COMPLAIN THEN THE SCHOOL'S ARE GONNA BACK DOWN [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01366-A-0017)

YEAH YEAH I AGREE WITH THAT BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW MAYBE A PARENT I DON'T KNOW I MEAN YOU HAVE A LOT OF YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO THINK A LARGE PER- PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION OF YOUR STUDENTS THEIR PARENTS ARE  (fe_03_01366-A-0022)
PROBABLY UNEDUCATED OR UNDER EDUCATED  (fe_03_01366-A-0023)
AND SO THEY MAY HAVE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT VIEW THAN WHAT THE K- YOU KNOW THE KIDS ARE YOU KNOW DAD OR MOM WORKS IN A FACTORY UH YOU KNOW THEY MIGHT NOT SEE THE ATTRIBUTES OF A PIECE OF LITERATURE  (fe_03_01366-A-0024)
THAT THEY UH THE TEACHER DOES OR YOU KNOW OR WHAT THE SCHOOL BELIEVES AT HOW IT COULD BENEFIT  (fe_03_01366-A-0025)
WELL NO  (fe_03_01366-A-0027)
NO AND DEPENDING ON YOUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS THERE ISN'T LIKE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01366-A-0028)
THEY HAVE TO READ JUST I DON'T KNOW NOT EVEN SOME OF THE CLASSICS THEY CAN'T READ SO  (fe_03_01366-A-0029)
[SIGH] NOT BEING A LITERATURE TEACHER I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01366-A-0030)
QUITE A BIT BUT I DON'T KNOW UH CURRENTLY OUR STUDENTS ARE READING GRAPES OF WRATH SO THEY'RE HAVING A BIG PROBLEM WITH THAT  (fe_03_01366-A-0031)
OH WELL IT'S A PRETTY BLAND BOOK THAT AND I.E. TEACHING THIS TO THEIR SCHOOLS SO  (fe_03_01366-A-0032)
THE UH  (fe_03_01366-A-0033)
THEY'RE DOING MORE OF A MOVIE AND LOOKING AT EXCERPTS THAN THEY ARE ACTUALLY READING IT BUT WE DID HAVE PARENTS COMPLAINING WE WERE UH WE HAD SOME STUDENTS READING CATCHER IN THE RYE [SIGH]  (fe_03_01366-A-0034)
AND UH IT'S MORE OF A COMING OF AGE BOOK  (fe_03_01366-A-0035)
AND I THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT ONE  (fe_03_01366-A-0036)
AND UM [SIGH] WE DID HAVE SOME PROBLEMS WITH THAT  (fe_03_01366-A-0037)
UH DIDN'T PULL OUT BUT ISN'T IS MORE OF AN OPTIONAL THAT THEY COULD READ FOR LIKE EXTRA CREDIT AND ONE OR TWO OF THE PARENTS DID NOT WANT THEM READING IT  (fe_03_01366-A-0038)
WELL IT YEAH YES EXACTLY  (fe_03_01366-A-0039)

NO I AGREE WITH YOU [SIGH]  (fe_03_01366-A-0045)
I THINK THE PARENTS SHOULD HAVE A SAY TO A POINT BUT WHEN THEIR CHILDREN REA- REACH A CERTAIN AGE YOU KNOW THEY DON'T SAY WHO THEIR KIDS CAN DATE PROBABLY PER SE OR WHAT THEIR KID CAN DO  (fe_03_01366-A-0046)
UH THE CHILD SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANNA BELIEVE THAT OR NOT IT'S PART OF HELPING THEM TO YOU KNOW UH GET THEIR OWN SENSE OF IDENTITY AND GET THEIR OWN YOU KNOW IDEAS FOR THEMSELVES SO  (fe_03_01366-A-0047)
I I DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE THAT THE PARENTS SHOULD HAVE A SAY ON WHAT COULD BE CENSORED I DON'T KNOW IT'S A IT'S A VERY MIXED TOPIC AND I'M SURE  (fe_03_01366-A-0048)
[SIGH] BUT I THINK IT I AND I THINK IT DIFFERS CENSORSHIP DIFFERS AT DIFFERENT SCHOOLS AS WELL I UH I DO WORK AT A UH A CATHOLIC SCHOOL ALSO  (fe_03_01366-A-0049)
UH DOING SOME TUTORING AND THERE THE CHILDREN ARE MUCH MORE OR THE PARENTS ARE MUCH MORE OPEN TO HIGHER EDUCATION  (fe_03_01366-A-0050)
AND LETTING THEIR CHILDREN READ MORE BOOKS AND WHAT NOT THAT THEY DON'T CENSOR SO  (fe_03_01366-A-0051)
UH NOT NEARLY AS MUCH  (fe_03_01366-A-0052)
YEAH OH DEFINITELY BUT I SEE MORE LEEWAY THERE THAN I DO AT THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  (fe_03_01366-A-0053)
WELL YOU KNOW MOST OF THESE PARENTS HAVE MONEY  (fe_03_01366-A-0054)
YOU KNOW I MEAN WHEN YOU'RE TALKING YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A PARENT PAYING SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR PER KID  (fe_03_01366-A-0055)
MOST OF THEM HAVE GOT LIKE A REALLY GOOD JOB OR SOMETHING AND THEY THEY HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF EDUCATION THAN YOUR PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS  (fe_03_01366-A-0056)
THAT'S WHAT I'M ASSUMING FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN  (fe_03_01366-A-0057)
THEY'RE MORE OPEN TO LETTING THEIR CHILDREN EXPLORE THINGS  (fe_03_01366-A-0058)
THAN I THINK A LOT OF PUBLIC SCHOOL PARENTS  (fe_03_01366-A-0059)
SO AND I COULD BE TOTALLY WRONG THIS COULD JUST BE MY  (fe_03_01366-A-0060)
YEAH  (fe_03_01366-A-0061)
UH WELL I'M SURE YOU CAN BAN CERTAIN UH YOU CAN CENSOR CERTAIN THINGS LIKE UH KANSAS HAS HAD THE PROBLEM WITH UH TEACHING EVOLUTION AND NOT TEACHING IT  (fe_03_01366-A-0063)

WITHIN A SCHOOL DISTRICT AND YOU KNOW THAT'S A REAL TOUCHY K- SUBJECT OF HOW DO YOU WORD IT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01366-A-0066)
RIGHT YOU KNOW SO THEY WANNA HAVE SOMETHING THAT SAYS YOU KNOW A CREATOR OR A GOD NOT GO- YOU KNOW NOT ANY SPECIFIC GOD  (fe_03_01366-A-0067)
COULD'VE CREATED OR HOW DID THEY CALL IT LIKE A DIVINE CREATOR OR A DEVINE  (fe_03_01366-A-0068)
SOMETHING CREATED YOU KNOW LIKE THE MULT- YOU KNOW CELLS OR WHAT NOT SO AND THAT CAN BE CENSORED TOO  (fe_03_01366-A-0069)
SO  (fe_03_01366-A-0070)
UH I DON'T KNOW I MEAN I LIVE IN THE BIBLE BELT SO  (fe_03_01366-A-0071)
THERE ARE A LOT MORE PEOPLE PRO CREATIONISM THAN LET'S SAY PER PER SE EVOLUTIONISM OR EVOLUTION I GUESS THAT'D BE  (fe_03_01366-A-0072)
SO I THEY CAN YOU KNOW CENSOR THAT  (fe_03_01366-A-0073)

[SIGH] I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE BIOLOGY AND WHAT THEY TEACH YOU KNOW THE BIOLOGY SECTION OF THE SCHOOL  (fe_03_01366-A-0075)
UM SO I'M NOT SURE BUT I'M SURE THAT IT IS A IT CAN BE CENSORED ESPECIALLY IF THE PARENTS COME IN I THINK PARENTS PLAY  (fe_03_01366-A-0076)
PLAY A BIGGER PART THAN MOST PEOPLE THINK YOU GOT A PARENT COME IN AND HOO AND HOLLER THERE MIGHT BE A HUNDRED STUDENTS BUT ONE PARENT COMES IN  (fe_03_01366-A-0077)
THE UH FACULTY AND THE UH MAINLY THE ADMINISTRATION ARE GOING TO  (fe_03_01366-A-0078)
CATER MORE TO THAT PARENT BECAUSE THEY'RE RAISING A BIG FUSS  (fe_03_01366-A-0079)
THAT'S RIGHT AND IT SHOULDN'T ALWAYS BE THAT WAY BUT THAT'S HOW IT USUALLY WORKS  (fe_03_01366-A-0080)
SO  (fe_03_01366-A-0081)
YOU KNOW THERE MIGHT BE A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION OF THE YOU KNOW THE PARENTS WITHIN THE SCHOOL BUT [SIGH] THEY'RE MAKING THEIR VOICE HEARD OR [SIGH]  (fe_03_01366-A-0082)
YOU KNOW HEARD LOUDER SO  (fe_03_01366-A-0083)
THEY HAVE A LARGER SAY I THINK  (fe_03_01366-A-0084)
I I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_01366-A-0085)
BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN SO I DON'T KN- I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD THINK ON THAT IF I HAD CHILDREN AND YOU KNOW PER SE WANTING YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT I WANTED THEM TO  (fe_03_01366-A-0086)
UH HEAR SOMETHING OR READ SOMETHING  (fe_03_01366-A-0087)
SO I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_01366-A-0088)
BUT I YOU KNOW NOT BEING IN THAT POSITION  (fe_03_01366-A-0089)
SURE  (fe_03_01366-A-0090)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01366-A-0091)
OKAY  (fe_03_01366-A-0092)
YES YOU WERE PRACTISING YOUR OWN  (fe_03_01366-A-0093)
[LAUGHTER] THAT'S INTERESTING  (fe_03_01366-A-0094)
SHOULD THEY REMOVE THAT THEN SHOULD IT HAVE BEEN REMOVED OTHER THAN YOU REMOVING IT  (fe_03_01366-A-0097)
RIGHT AND WHAT ELSE THEN YOU SAID YOU HAD A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT YOU THINK YOU WOULD CENSOR  (fe_03_01366-A-0098)
THIS IS KRISHA  (fe_03_01366-B-0001)

WELL THAT'S A VERY BROAD SUBJECT UM  (fe_03_01366-B-0005)
OH NO SO YOU REALLY HAVE AN OPINION  (fe_03_01366-B-0006)
NO BUT ONLY BECAUSE UM I THINK IT'S THE PARENTS' RESPONSIBILITY TO UH  (fe_03_01366-B-0010)
I THINK I THINK IF THE PARENTS ARE ARE ARE UM EDUCATING THEIR CHILDREN THAT WHATEVER THEY READ ISN'T GONNA HAVE THE SAME EFFECT  (fe_03_01366-B-0011)
THAT DOES MAKE SENSE  (fe_03_01366-B-0012)
I  (fe_03_01366-B-0013)
SO UH IN OTHER WORDS WE MIGHT NEED SOME CENSORSHIP BECAUSE THE PARENTS JUST AREN'T EDUCATING THEIR CHILDREN OR THEIR PARENTS DON'T WANT THEM TO READ THE BOOK  (fe_03_01366-B-0014)
SO IS THE QUESTION REALLY DOES THE SCHOOL HAVE A RIGHT TO PUT IT F- PUT THE BOOK OUT ANYWAY  (fe_03_01366-B-0016)
NOW I'M THINKING WELL THE PARENTS ARE PAYING FOR THE SCHOOL WITH THEIR TAX DOLLARS SO I GUESS MAYBE THEY SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A SAY IN WHAT BOOKS ARE GOING OUT THERE  (fe_03_01366-B-0017)
AND IF YOU IF YOU WERE CATERING TO EVERY SINGLE PARENT'S UM  (fe_03_01366-B-0019)
OPINION THEN I I CAN'T IMAGINE YOU WOULD HAVE MUCH LEFT IN THE SCHOOLS TO READ  (fe_03_01366-B-0020)
WHY  (fe_03_01366-B-0021)
MHM  (fe_03_01366-B-0022)
DID ANY PARENTS PULL THEIR KID OUT OF THE CLASS OR JUST SAY MY KID'S READ THIS  (fe_03_01366-B-0023)
SO IT WENT FROM BEING AN ASSIGNMENT TO BEING EXTRA CREDIT BECAUSE THE PARENTS OBJECTED  (fe_03_01366-B-0024)
[LAUGHTER] I I'M REALLY ON THE FENCE ON THE ISSUE TOO BECAUSE I I I DON'T WANNA SEE HIS STUFF BANNED I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE BANNED BUT UM  (fe_03_01366-B-0025)
I THINK THE PARENTS SHOULD HAVE A SAY  (fe_03_01366-B-0026)

[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01366-B-0046)
SO I WAS PRACTISING MY OWN CENSORSHIP  (fe_03_01366-B-0047)
IN THE SIXTH GRADE  (fe_03_01366-B-0048)
