WELL  (fe_03_01313-B-0004)
WELL I CAN'T SAY THAT I'M ALL FOR IT BECAUSE IF WE TOTALLY TAKE IT AWAY FROM THEM THEN THE SMOKERS WILL SAY THEY HAVE NO RIGHTS BUT I THINK THAT THERE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE A SMOKING SECTION THAT IS  (fe_03_01313-B-0005)
AWAY FROM THE NON SMOKING SECTION SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH A SMOKING SECTION TO GET TO A NON SMOKING  (fe_03_01313-B-0006)
WELL RIGHT THEY HAVE RIGHTS THAT  (fe_03_01313-B-0007)

OKAY  (fe_03_01313-B-0028)
I THINK IT MAKES AN AWARENESS IN THE YOUNGER GENERATION  (fe_03_01313-B-0030)
WELL WELL IT WAS TALKING ABOUT THE AWARENESS IS IT IS IT M- MINIMIZING  (fe_03_01313-B-0031)
THE SMOKERS IS THE WAY I INTERPRETED THE QUESTION AND I THINK IT'S MAKING AN AWARENESS IN THE YOUNGER GENERATION  (fe_03_01313-B-0032)
UM  (fe_03_01313-B-0033)
THAN BEFORE LIKE LIKE LIKE IN OUR TIME UM  (fe_03_01313-B-0034)
WELL I THINK IT'S A YOU KNOW IT'S A COOLNESS THING AND THEN SOME OF IT'S A LACK OF PARENTAL GUIDANCE TOO  (fe_03_01313-B-0035)
WELL UH BUT THEN SO MANY THAT THAT'S WHERE THE PARENTAL GUIDANCE COMES IN THOUGH BECAUSE PARENTS GIVE 'EM MONEY AND DROP 'EM OFF AT MALLS OR DROP 'EM OFF HERE OR THERE OR WHATEVER  (fe_03_01313-B-0036)
JUST SO THE PARENTS DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH 'EM  (fe_03_01313-B-0037)
SO IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S AND THE KIDS ARE GONNA FIND A WAY SOMEBODY THINKS IT'S COOL AND SO YEAH THEY'LL PICK IT UP FOR YOU AND  (fe_03_01313-B-0038)
YEAH  (fe_03_01313-B-0039)
ALMOST LIKE A A SEGREGATED ISSUE  (fe_03_01313-B-0040)
I THINK FOR THE FOR THE BUSINESSES IT'S A CHEAPER OPTION UM AND AND I THINK IF  (fe_03_01313-B-0043)
I MEAN  (fe_03_01313-B-0044)

RIGHT  (fe_03_01313-B-0053)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01313-B-0054)
WELL AND THEY SAY SECOND HAND SMOKE IS JUST AS DANGEROUS IF NOT WORSE THAN PRIMARY SMOKE  (fe_03_01313-B-0055)
BUT IF THEY'RE GONNA MAKE 'EM GO OUTSIDE MAKE 'EM GO FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM THE BUILDING SO THAT THOSE OF US WHO DO NOT SMOKE DON'T HAVE TO WALK STRAIGHT THROUGH IT  (fe_03_01313-B-0057)
I MEAN WHAT'S THE POINT OF MAKING THEM GO OUTSIDE IF THEY'RE GONNA BE CLAMORED AROUND THE DOOR SO THAT IT EITHER RUSHES TO THE DOORS WHEN THE DOORS OPEN OR YOU WALK THROUGH A PILLOW OF BLUE SMOKE TRYING TO GET IN  (fe_03_01313-B-0058)
IT'S LIKE GOING TO A NIGHTCLUB YOU YOU SMELL THE SAME WAY  (fe_03_01313-B-0059)
WELL I DO TOO I DON'T LIKE THE THE SMOKE  (fe_03_01313-B-0060)
GO FOR IT  (fe_03_01313-B-0061)
AND I THINK THE  (fe_03_01313-B-0063)
THE TOBACCO MAKERS SHOULD BE THE ONES THAT HAVE TO PAY AND I'M SURE THEY ARE BUT I YOU KNOW I'VE NEVER DONE THE RESEARCH FOR ALL OF THE COMMERCIALS ON SMOKING  (fe_03_01313-B-0064)
AND B- YOU KNOW AGAINST THE SMOKING AND STUFF THAT SHOULD NOT COME OUT OF MY MONEY  (fe_03_01313-B-0065)
I MEAN THAT'S A CHOICE I DON'T MAKE SO THEREFORE THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE W- THAT ARE WILLING TO PAY THE THREE OR FOUR DOLLARS HOWEVER MUCH IT IS  (fe_03_01313-B-0066)
THEY CAN PAY TO EDUCATE THEMSELVES ON THEIR RETARDED BEHAVIOR  (fe_03_01313-B-0067)
SO  (fe_03_01313-B-0068)
TAX IT ALL  (fe_03_01313-B-0069)
IF E- EXACTLY YOU KNOW IF IF THEY THINK THEY CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT IF THEY HAVE TO PAY THAT FOUR DOLLARS WELL THEN LET 'EM CHARGE 'EM  (fe_03_01313-B-0070)
IT'S UNHEALTHY  (fe_03_01313-B-0071)
IT'S AN OXYMORON  (fe_03_01313-B-0072)
SO NOW WHERE YOU HAVE THEY TOTALLY BANNED IT IN ALL YOUR RESTAURANTS  (fe_03_01313-B-0073)
NOW I KNOW UM ONE OF OUR TEX MEX RESTAURANTS  (fe_03_01313-B-0074)

RIGHT  (fe_03_01313-B-0079)
I THINK THAT UM [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_01313-B-0080)
ANOTHER THING THAT UNNERVES ME OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO WALK THROUGH  (fe_03_01313-B-0081)
THE SMOKING SECTION TO GET TO THE NON SMOKING  (fe_03_01313-B-0082)
IS THE FACT THAT THEY'RE YOU KNOW NOT SEPARATED ENOUGH  (fe_03_01313-B-0083)
THE VERY NEXT BOOTH IS NON IT'S NON SMOKING SO IT'S LIKE WHAT'S THE POINT  (fe_03_01313-B-0084)
OR YOU WALK IN AND THE SMELL HITS YOU  (fe_03_01313-B-0085)
EVEN OVER THE AROMAS OF THE OF THE RESTAURANT  (fe_03_01313-B-0086)
