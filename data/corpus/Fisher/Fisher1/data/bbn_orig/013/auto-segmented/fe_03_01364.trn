FIRST GRADE AND PRE SCHOOL [LAUGHTER] EVERYBODY TELLS ME IT GETS HARDER YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01364-A-0056)
THAT'S RIGHT  (fe_03_01364-A-0058)
YEAH THAT'S THE ONE THING I TRY TO REALLY DO WITH MY KIDS IS WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME READING THE BIBLE AND WE GO TO CHURCH A LOT AND TRY TO INSTILL THOSE KIND OF VALUES BECAUSE IT'S SO HARD TO FIGHT  (fe_03_01364-A-0059)
THAT'S LIKE JUST OVERWHELMS  (fe_03_01364-A-0060)

YEAH WELL TO ME YOU KNOW AND NOT TO TOTALLY STRAY AT ALL BUT TH- YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF IF YOU BELIEVE IN JESUS  (fe_03_01364-A-0067)
AND THEN IF YOU DO BELIEVE IN JESUS THEN YOU HAVE TO DECIDE TO TRY TO FIND A CHURCH THAT IS AS CLOSE TO HOW HE TAUGHT AS POSSIBLE  (fe_03_01364-A-0068)
YOU KNOW LIKE A LOT OF CHURCHES THEY SAY THEY BELIEVE IN JESUS BUT THEN THEY DO THEIR OWN THING AND STUFF AND THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY THING I COULD REALLY SPEAK INTELLIGENTLY ABOUT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01364-A-0069)
YOU KNOW SO I DON'T KNOW JUST CHECK IT OUT AND YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01364-A-0070)

AND HIS FATHER KINDA GOT A LITTLE UPSET LIKE WELL I DON'T THINK THE SCHOOL WOULD ALLOW TO HAVE A BIBLE IN THERE AND I DON'T KNOW AND YOU KNOW SO IT WAS KIND OF A TOUCHY THING BUT I THINK THAT AS FAR AS CENSORSHIP GOES  (fe_03_01364-A-0078)
IF A STUDENT WANTS TO BRING A BIBLE AND READ IT DURING A FREE TIME OR SOMETHING I DON'T SEE A PROBLEM WITH THAT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01364-A-0079)
WELL YEAH [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01364-A-0080)

THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO DENYING THAT AND FOR THEM TO TRY TO SAY YOU CAN'T SAY GOD IN THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE IN SCHOOL THAT THAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED UNCONSTITUTIONAL IS JUST HORRENDOUS TO ME  (fe_03_01364-A-0083)
YOU KNOW WE ARE ONE NATION UNDER GOD AND THERE MAYBE SOME OF THEM ARE MUSLIM OR WHATEVER BUT WE WERE FOUNDED ON IT AND OUR MONEY EVEN SAYS IN GOD WE TRUST  (fe_03_01364-A-0084)
IT'S TRUE YOU KNOW AND THEN ALL THESE PEOPLE LIKE YOU KNOW FOR INSTANCE ALL THE PEOPLE WITH THE PORNOGRAPHY ON THE INTERNET ARE HIDING BEHIND CENSORSHIP THAT THEY HAVE SOME SORT OF A RIGHT TO SHOVE THIS JUNK DOWN OUR THROATS  (fe_03_01364-A-0086)
YOU KNOW AND ALL THESE POB DOBS AND ALL THIS STUFF AND YOU KNOW I I DON'T KNOW TO ME  (fe_03_01364-A-0087)
WE DO HAVE DRAW A LINE SOMEWHERE BUT I THINK THAT COMMON SENSE IS A GOOD PLACE TO START YOU KNOW NOT A BUNCH OF YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01364-A-0088)
LITIGATION OR WHATEVER OH WELL IF YOU SAY THIS THEN IT APPLIES TO THIS AND THAT I MEAN JUST COMMON SENSE AND NOT MAKING IT TOO COMPLICATED  (fe_03_01364-A-0089)
YEAH WELL  (fe_03_01364-A-0090)
THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOMEBODY STIRRING IT UP I GUESS YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01364-A-0091)
