[NOISE] I GUESS REALLY YOU KIND OF  (fe_03_01335-A-0055)
MAKE SOME TRADE OFFS BY PUBLICIZING YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01335-A-0056)

IN A FORMAL WAY  (fe_03_01335-A-0060)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01335-A-0061)
WHEN THEY PUBLICIZE IT YOU KNOW IT'S JUST KIND OF THE CAMERA AND THE COURT AND LITTLE REVIEWS YOU KNOW SO  (fe_03_01335-A-0062)
IF YOU'RE REALLY INTERESTED IN WHAT'S GOING ON THEY GIVE YOU A LITTLE REVIEW OF WHAT'S GOING YOU KNOW [NOISE] WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND WHERE THEY'RE GOING WITH THE DECISION  (fe_03_01335-A-0063)
AND ALSO SOME PEOPLE KNOW THAT I GUESS IT'S GOOD THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT THE YOU KNOW THAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS REALLY TAKING ON  (fe_03_01335-A-0064)

YOU KNOW I GUESS IT'S WORTH THAT'S WHY WE TALK ABOUT IT FOR TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WE WANT TO GO WITH THIS  (fe_03_01335-A-0079)
[NOISE] IT'S DEFINITELY IT  (fe_03_01335-A-0080)
IS JUST SOMETHING [NOISE]  (fe_03_01335-A-0081)

YEAH THAT'S VERY TRUE [NOISE] AND THEN YOU KNOW THERE'S A BIG DEAL ABOUT TRYING TO CHOOSE AH YOU KNOW THE RIGHT JUDGE WHATEVER THAT'S NOT HASN'T HEARD TOO MUCH ABOUT IT AND SO THERE'S DEFINITELY A NEGATIVE EFFECT RIGHT THERE IN THAT WHEN YOU PUBLICIZE IT  (fe_03_01335-A-0092)
YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHENEVER IT'S HARDER TO FIND JURORS THAT ARE BIASED AND THE JUDGE IS BIASED BECAUSE THEY'VE PROBABLY ALREADY HEARD STUFF  (fe_03_01335-A-0093)
[NOISE] AND SO THEY HAVE PROBABLY ALREADY FORMED OPINIONS ABOUT THINGS YOU KNOW SO IT'S KIND OF HARD TO FIND A VIRGIN A VIRGIN MIND THAT HASN'T BEEN  (fe_03_01335-A-0094)
DECIDED YEA OR NAY YET SO THAT  (fe_03_01335-A-0095)

OH YEAH  (fe_03_01335-B-0014)
YEAH IT'S QUITE A WAYS AWAY YET [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01335-B-0015)
CRIMINAL TRIALS  (fe_03_01335-B-0017)
I HAVE I DON'T EITHER BUT [LAUGHTER] I'VE WATCHED THEM SOMEWHAT  (fe_03_01335-B-0018)
I WATCHED UM I WATCHED AH LITTLE BITS OF SOME SOME TRIALS  (fe_03_01335-B-0019)
YEAH YEAH  (fe_03_01335-B-0020)
WELL YEAH THAT'S THE THING IT AH AH  (fe_03_01335-B-0021)
THE ONLY THING THAT SOMETIMES FOR EXAMPLE WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT IS IT BASKETBALL PLAYER  (fe_03_01335-B-0022)
IT'S INTERESTING BUT UP TO WHAT POINT ONCE YOU START HEARING ABOUT HOW HE'S GETTING MONEY FOR FOR CONTINUING ON  (fe_03_01335-B-0023)
YOU KNOW LIKE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S MORE OF A PUBLICITY TYPE THING  (fe_03_01335-B-0024)
AND SO IT MAKES YOU WONDER HOW MUCH OF IT IS IS IS TELEVISED BECAUSE HE WANTS TO KEEP GETTING MONEY YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01335-B-0025)
AND YET THERE'S OTHER TRIALS THAT UM THAT ARE REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE AH  (fe_03_01335-B-0026)
[COUGH] IT TALKS ABOUT  (fe_03_01335-B-0027)
UM  (fe_03_01335-B-0028)
CRIMINALS THAT HAVE DONE  (fe_03_01335-B-0029)
THINGS [NOISE] AND SO IT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR HOW THEY HOW THEY ARE ABLE TO CATCH HIM  (fe_03_01335-B-0030)
YOU KNOW SO I FIND THAT INTERESTING  (fe_03_01335-B-0031)
MHM  (fe_03_01335-B-0032)
NO NO  (fe_03_01335-B-0033)
MHM THAT'S TRUE A  (fe_03_01335-B-0034)
LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE BEHIND THE SCENES AND ARE HIDDEN FROM THE PUBLIC  (fe_03_01335-B-0035)
MHM MHM  (fe_03_01335-B-0036)
NO NO THAT'S RIGHT  (fe_03_01335-B-0037)
MHM MHM  (fe_03_01335-B-0038)
THAT'S TRUE BECAUSE THEN IT'S IT'S MORE THEN  (fe_03_01335-B-0039)
OF A SPECTACLE AND AND IT'S NOT A GOOD THING TO SHOW THAT ON ON T._V.  (fe_03_01335-B-0040)
THAT'S RIGHT  (fe_03_01335-B-0041)
THAT'S RIGHT  (fe_03_01335-B-0042)
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT A LOT OF IT A LOT [NOISE] OF THE DESENSITIZING THOUGH COMES ALSO FROM WHAT IS GENERALLY LEFT [NOISE] ON THE T._V.  (fe_03_01335-B-0043)
AND SO THERE'S SO MUCH VIOLENCE THAT AH  (fe_03_01335-B-0044)
IT ENDS UP WHERE PEOPLE WELL THEY SEE IT ON THEY SEE THE REAL THING THAT IS SHOWN [NOISE] ON THE NEWS LIKE NOW WITH THE WAR THEY SEE THE REAL THING IN A TRIAL AND IT'S NOT NO BIG DEAL ANY MORE IT DOESN'T REALLY SINK IN  (fe_03_01335-B-0045)
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE  (fe_03_01335-B-0046)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01335-B-0047)
IT DOESN'T SEEM REAL ANY MORE BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT YOU SEE IS NOT REAL AND SO IT ENDS UP  (fe_03_01335-B-0048)
IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE THE SAME EFFECT  (fe_03_01335-B-0049)
AND SO THEN WHAT HAPPENS TOO THAT AH [COUGH] IT COULD BE THAT THESE VERY PUBLIC PEOPLE THAT HAVE THEIR TRIALS AND THEY THEY SHOW THINGS AND SO THEY THEY TRY TO MAKE IT MORE SENSATIONAL SO THAT PEOPLE WILL  (fe_03_01335-B-0050)
WILL PAY MORE ATTENTION BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN  (fe_03_01335-B-0051)
DESENSITIZED TYPE THING  (fe_03_01335-B-0052)
[NOISE] IT COULD BE HAVE AN EFFECT  (fe_03_01335-B-0053)
THEY'LL BE MORE GLUED AND THEN OF COURSE THE THE DIFFERENT  (fe_03_01335-B-0054)
UM STATIONS AND THEY'LL ALL SAY WELL THEY'LL GET THEIR RATINGS UP AND THEY'LL GET THEIR MONEY AND THEN AND THEN THE PUBLIC PERSON THAT HAS GIVEN THEM THE RIGHT TO SHOW IT WELL THEN THEY GET THEIR MONEY AND SO YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS THAT ECONOMIC FACTOR  (fe_03_01335-B-0055)
IN IT  (fe_03_01335-B-0056)
THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_01335-B-0057)
IN ORDER TO SEE IT THERE HAS TO BE THAT THAT PART [NOISE] OF IT THIS HAS ONLY HAVE TO HAVE GIVE THE RIGHT TO BE HAVE IT WATCHED  (fe_03_01335-B-0058)
THAT'S TRUE YEAH NOT NOT SO [NOISE] SENSATIONALIZED  (fe_03_01335-B-0059)
MHM  (fe_03_01335-B-0060)
THAT'S TRUE YEAH  (fe_03_01335-B-0061)
AND I I THOUGHT THAT IDEA OF YOURS WAS GOOD THAT THEY THEY SHOULD FORMALIZE IT MORE FOR EXAMPLE INSTEAD OF GET HAVING UM EACH UM YOU KNOW N._B._C. OR C._B._C. OR WHATEVER  (fe_03_01335-B-0062)
THEY HAVE TRY TO GET THE RIGHTS AND THEY'RE FIGHTING OVER WHO'S GOING TO HAVE IT TELEVISED BUT HAVE THE JUDGE DECIDE AND LET HIM SAY AND SO NOBODY IS GOING TO BE THE WINNER HERE BECAUSE IT'S UM IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S  (fe_03_01335-B-0063)
ONLY [NOISE] FOR PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE  (fe_03_01335-B-0064)
AND NOT SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO BE GAINING OR TRYING TO GET MONEY OUT OF IT  (fe_03_01335-B-0065)
THAT'S RIGHT YEAH EACH ONE HAS TO GET THEIR THEY WANT TO GET THEIR SIDE SO THAT PEOPLE ARE SWAYED YOU KNOW THEY SAY OH THIS YOU KNOW HE'S IN THE RIGHT AND WHEREAS NOBODY EXCEPT THOSE THAT ARE REALLY JUDGING IT KNOW ALL THE FACTS  (fe_03_01335-B-0066)
AND A LOT OF TIMES THAT THAT THAT CAN SWAY  (fe_03_01335-B-0067)
SWAY [NOISE] YOU KNOW SOMEBODY FOR IT AND I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_01335-B-0068)
IT'S A TOUGH QUESTION REALLY  (fe_03_01335-B-0069)
YEAH  (fe_03_01335-B-0071)
THEN OF COURSE IN THE STATES BECAUSE SHH SHH SHH DAISY DAISY BE QUIET  (fe_03_01335-B-0072)
EACH EACH PROVINCE HERE OR EACH STATE THERE IN THE STATES [NOISE] HAS THEIR OWN LITTLE LAWS THEN  (fe_03_01335-B-0074)
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE DONE EVERYWHERE BECAUSE THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WELL WE'LL HAVE THE TRIAL IN THIS OTHER STATE OR THIS OTHER PROVINCE BECAUSE IT WILL BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR US  (fe_03_01335-B-0075)
INSTEAD OF HAVING IT ALL  (fe_03_01335-B-0076)
UM UNIFORM [NOISE] SO THAT IT THE LAWS ARE MORE UNIFORM AND NOT SO  (fe_03_01335-B-0077)
AH DIFFERENT FROM ONE PLACE TO THE OTHER IT SEEMS THAT PEOPLE GET AWAY WITH THINGS BECAUSE THEY CAN JUST SWITCH TO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND SAY WELL GO TO THIS OTHER PLACE BECAUSE THERE THEY CAN'T CATCH ME EVEN THOUGH IT'S THE SAME COUNTRY  (fe_03_01335-B-0078)
THAT'S RIGHT  (fe_03_01335-B-0080)
THEY SEEM TO HAVE SO MUCH INDEPENDENCE NOW THAT THEY'RE ALMOST LIKE LITTLE COUNTRIES  (fe_03_01335-B-0081)
AND SO THEY THAT'S YOU KNOW THESE PEOPLE THEY'RE HIGH PROFILE AND THEY HAVE MONEY AND THEY THEY CAN GET THEIR LAWYERS TO GET THE LOOPHOLES AND THEY KNOW WELL YOU SHOULD GO THERE BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOU WILL PROBABLY GET FREE OR YOU'LL PROBABLY GET THE BEST YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01335-B-0082)
INSTEAD OF HAVING IT THE SAME EVERYWHERE SO THAT THEY CAN'T DO THAT  (fe_03_01335-B-0083)
MHM  (fe_03_01335-B-0084)
MHM THAT'S RIGHT  (fe_03_01335-B-0085)
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S WHY  (fe_03_01335-B-0086)
IT'S SO DIFFICULT  (fe_03_01335-B-0087)
TO GET [COUGH] THEN A A TRULY FAIR TRIAL  (fe_03_01335-B-0088)
