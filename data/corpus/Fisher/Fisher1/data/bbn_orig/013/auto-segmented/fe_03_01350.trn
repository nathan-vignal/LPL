BECAUSE AND I DIDN'T APPRECIATE IT AND SHE NEVER HAD ANY SUCCESS AT AT CONTROLLING WHAT I READ  (fe_03_01350-A-0032)
BECAUSE I JUST WENT TO THE LIBRARY AND READ IT IN INSTALLMENTS  (fe_03_01350-A-0033)
YEAH I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HAS THE RIGHT TO TELL ANYBODYS WHAT THEY SHOULD OR SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT CONSUME BUT AS FAR AS LIKE READING LISTS IN CLASSES BECAUSE THEY WERE GONNA BE ON A TOPIC  (fe_03_01350-A-0034)
AND WE NEED TO HEAR HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THINGS LIKE SAY GOLDING LORD OF THE FLIES THAT'S A CONTROVERSIAL BOOK  (fe_03_01350-A-0035)
I CAN'T DISCUSS THE ROWLING BOOKS WITH YOU BECAUSE I HAVEN'T READ THOSE  (fe_03_01350-A-0036)

IF I HAD CHILDREN  (fe_03_01350-A-0042)
THAT BOOKS WITH  (fe_03_01350-A-0043)
SAY SEXUAL CONTENT WOULD DISTURB ME FOR  (fe_03_01350-A-0044)
CERTAIN AGES I WOULD WONDER WHAT WAS APPROPRIATE BUT AGAIN LIKE I SAID YOU KNOW THEY HAD NO LUCK CONTROLLING WHAT I READ WHEN I WAS A KID  (fe_03_01350-A-0045)
AND WHEN I WAS A LIBRARIAN  (fe_03_01350-A-0046)
I NEVER TRIED TO TELL ANYONE  (fe_03_01350-A-0047)
THAT THEY OUGHTN'T YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD TELL PARENTS AND I DID IN CHILDRENS SERVICES SPECIFICALLY [NOISE] WAS THAT THEY SHOULD READ THE MATERIAL THEMSELVES  (fe_03_01350-A-0048)
AND SEE JUST HOW UNCOMFORTABLE THEY WERE WITH IT  (fe_03_01350-A-0049)
THEY SHOULD READ PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THEIR KIDS READ AND THEN LET THE KID HAVE A CHANCE TO DECIDE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01350-A-0050)
YOU CAN'T CONTROL WHAT'S IN ANOTHER PERSON'S MIND AND THEN PEOPLE READ AND WRITE AND IT'S A WAY THAT WE HAVE OF [NOISE] COMMUNICATING AND UNDERSTANDING ONE ANOTHER  (fe_03_01350-A-0051)
AND EXPERIENCING  (fe_03_01350-A-0052)
IDEAS AND PLACES THAT YOU MIGHT NEVER GET TO GO OR BE OTHERWISE EXCEPT FOR IN THE PAGES OF A BOOK  (fe_03_01350-A-0053)
[NOISE] SO I'M TOTALLY LIKE  (fe_03_01350-A-0054)

[NOISE] REALLY OBJECTIONABLE A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE OBJECT TO THEY SEEM TO BE WHAT WE WOULD MIGHT CONSIDER CLASSICS  (fe_03_01350-A-0060)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01350-A-0061)
OR SOME OF SOME PEOPLE WHO READ WOULD CONSIDER CLASSICS BUT THEN SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST AFRAID OF IDEAS SOME PEOPLE ARE TERRIFIED OF IDEAS  (fe_03_01350-A-0062)
RIGHT EXACTLY  (fe_03_01350-A-0063)
THAT'S THAT'S MORE LIKE A DISCERNMENT ISSUE  (fe_03_01350-A-0064)
YOU KNOW AND THEN KIDS THEY DO GET UM  (fe_03_01350-A-0065)
ABSORBED IN THINGS  (fe_03_01350-A-0066)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01350-A-0067)
IT IS AND I'D PREFER THAT THEY BE ABSORBED IN A BOOK THAN FLICKERING IMAGES ON A SCREEN  (fe_03_01350-A-0068)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01350-A-0069)
BECAUSE AT LEAST THEY'RE DOING THEIR READING SKILLS AND LEARNING NEW WORDS AND STUFF  (fe_03_01350-A-0070)
I'M THINKING WHEN I WAS A CHILD AND I READ THE TOLKIEN SERIES FOR THE FIRST TIME I WAS PRETTY CAPTIVATED AND I STILL ENJOY IT AS AN ADULT  (fe_03_01350-A-0071)
YOU KNOW BUT NOBODY EVER TRIED TO TELL ME I COULDN'T HAVE THAT  (fe_03_01350-A-0072)

AND IF YOU DIDN'T READ THAT THAT HAD THAT WAS PROBABLY ABOUT SEXUAL CONTENT THAT SHE WAS DISTURBED  (fe_03_01350-A-0079)
AND THEN WHEN YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THINGS ABOUT IT [NOISE] ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE READING  (fe_03_01350-A-0080)
AS YOU'RE READING IT  (fe_03_01350-A-0081)
IT DOESN'T DO THAT MUCH HARM [NOISE] I DON'T THINK IT DIDN'T HURT ME I MEAN  (fe_03_01350-A-0082)
WITH THAT BOOK SUMMER OF FORTY TWO  (fe_03_01350-A-0083)
YEAH BUT THESE THINGS WERE NOT REGARDED AS AGE APPROPRIATE  (fe_03_01350-A-0084)
YOU KNOW THAT WAS THAT WAS PROBABLY WHY SHE WAS TRYING TO PROTECT ME FROM THAT  (fe_03_01350-A-0085)
BECAUSE THEY WERE PRETTY MATURE I MEAN GONE WITH THE WIND FOR AN EIGHT YEAR OLD YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01350-A-0086)
SHE HAD SOME ISSUES WITH THAT  (fe_03_01350-A-0087)
BUT I STILL I ST- I WENT AND GOT IT I SLIPPED AND READ IT ANYWAY  (fe_03_01350-A-0088)
AT THE PUBLIC LIBRARY  (fe_03_01350-A-0089)

YOU KNOW AND AND NOBODY DOES TRY ANY MORE OF COURSE YOU KNOW I MEAN I'M IN MY FORTIES AND NOBODY'S GONNA TRY TO TELL ME WHAT TO READ AND WHAT NOT TO READ  (fe_03_01350-A-0092)
BUT IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT TO CONTROL PEOPLE AND WHAT'S IN THEIR MINDS I JUST THINK  (fe_03_01350-A-0093)
HAVING BEEN A LIBRARIAN I GOTTA I GOTTA SAY CENSORSHIP IS NOT THE THING  (fe_03_01350-A-0094)

ETHNIC USAGE YOU KNOW AND THEN MAYBE THEY DON'T READ IT IN CONTEXT AND REALIZE  (fe_03_01350-A-0098)
EXACTLY WHAT MARK TWAIN WAS SAYING ABOUT HOW WRONG HE FELT ABOUT HOW IT WAS TO TREAT OTHER PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE OF THE COLORS OF THEIR SKIN AND EVERYTHING AND HE WAS VERY MUCH AGAINST SLAVERY  (fe_03_01350-A-0099)
BUT PEOPLE THAT HAVE NOT READ HIS WORKS WOULD NOT REALIZE THAT BECAUSE HE USES THE N. WORD ON A RE- REGULAR BASIS BUT  (fe_03_01350-A-0100)
THAT WAS COMMON IN HIS TIME IT WAS IT WAS KIND OF [NOISE] I DON'T LIKE TO SAY APPROPRIATE BUT  (fe_03_01350-A-0101)
IT WAS WHAT HE KNEW [NOISE]  (fe_03_01350-A-0102)
BUT IF YOU EVER READ MORE ABOUT HIM [NOISE] AND HOW HE FELT GROWING UP SEEING PEOPLE FOR SALE HE DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL  (fe_03_01350-A-0103)
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY USED FOR IT  (fe_03_01350-A-0104)
IN THAT DAY IN TIME  (fe_03_01350-A-0105)
YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE WERE PROPERTY WHEN HE WAS BORN PEOPLE WERE PROPERTY  (fe_03_01350-A-0106)
