I HAVE THREE SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN I HAVE A TEN YEAR OLD BOY  (fe_03_01351-A-0032)
AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD BOY AND A TWELVE YEAR OLD GIRL  (fe_03_01351-A-0033)
AND UM THEY DO THEY DO HAVE TO DO A LOT OF READING FOR SCHOOL  (fe_03_01351-A-0034)
AND I'M PROBABLY ON THE VERY CONSERVATIVE SIDE OF PARENTS THEY THEY GO TO PUBLIC SCHOOL  (fe_03_01351-A-0035)
UM BUT WE HAPPEN TO BE CHRISTIANS WE GO TO CHURCH EVERY WEEK AND A LOT OF OUR FRIENDS HAVE KIDS THAT GO TO PRIVATE CHRISTIAN SCHOOL  (fe_03_01351-A-0036)
BUT WE CHOSE TO SEND OUR KIDS TO PUBLIC SCHOOL AND I ACTUALLY DON'T AGREE WITH ONE OF THE BOOKS THAT THEY DID READ  (fe_03_01351-A-0037)
UM THEY HAD TO READ HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS  (fe_03_01351-A-0038)
WHICH IS LIKE ABOUT MYSTICISM AND AND WITCHCRAFT  (fe_03_01351-A-0039)
MAGIC AND AND WE REALLY DON'T BELIEVE IN THAT  (fe_03_01351-A-0040)
YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY UPBRINGING THAT WE'RE GIVING THE CHILDREN HAS MORE INFLUENCE THA- ON THEM THAN ONE BOOK THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO READ FOR SCHOOL  (fe_03_01351-A-0042)
YOU KNOW SO I I DO BELIEVE THE SCHOOLS HAVE THE RIGHT TO CENSOR THE BOOKS BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THEY'RE TOUGH ENOUGH ON WHAT THEY'RE  (fe_03_01351-A-0043)
WHAT THEY'RE ALLOWING THE KIDS TO READ  (fe_03_01351-A-0044)

SO THEY HAVE TO GIVE 'EM THINGS THEY'RE INTERESTED IN  (fe_03_01351-A-0049)
BUT THE ONLY TIME IT CREATES A PROBLEM IS WHEN THE PARENTS DON'T AGREE WITH WHAT THEY'RE MAKING THE CHILDREN READ  (fe_03_01351-A-0050)
BUT I THINK IT'S THE PARENTS YOU KNOW TH- IF I WENT TO ONE OF MY KID'S TEACHERS AND SAID I DON'T WANT MY CHILD TO READ HARRY POTTER SHE WOULD DEFINITELY LET ME PICK AN ALTERNATE BOOK  (fe_03_01351-A-0051)
THAT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM BUT  (fe_03_01351-A-0052)
YOU KNOW FOR A LOT OF PARENTS THEY GET THEIR NOSE BENT OUT OF SH- THEN THEY PULL THEIR KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL AND THEY END UP HOME SCHOOLING THEIR CHILDREN  (fe_03_01351-A-0053)
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT 'EM EXPOSED  (fe_03_01351-A-0054)
