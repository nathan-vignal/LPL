UM FROM NEW JERSEY  (fe_03_01365-A-0003)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01365-A-0004)
UM WELL I THINK THAT THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE UM BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS MAINLY THAT YOU KNOW PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE NOT ABLE TO BE REGULATED BY THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEIR YOU KNOW THE FUNDING COMES FROM THEMSELVES AND [MN]  (fe_03_01365-A-0005)
AND THE FAMILIES WHEREAS YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE FUNDED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THEREFORE UM YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01365-A-0006)
THEY HAVE TO  (fe_03_01365-A-0007)
YOU THINK  (fe_03_01365-A-0009)
WELL NO I MEAN  (fe_03_01365-A-0010)
LIKE THE THE SCHOOLS ARE IN STATE JURISDICTION SO I THINK IT'S REALLY UP TO THE STATE BUT THEY STILL I MEAN AND THE STATE HAS TO UM YOU KNOW OF COURSE PAY  (fe_03_01365-A-0011)
RESPECTS TO THE TO THE LARGER FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND YOU KNOW I THINK THAT UM WHEN THE WHEN AN OUTSIDE FORCE IS REGULATING A SCHOOL THEN UM  (fe_03_01365-A-0012)
[LIPSMACK] WE KINDA HAVE TO PLAY BY THEIR RULES AND YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01365-A-0013)
WE WE'RE GUARANTEED THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND BECAUSE OF THAT YOU KNOW I REALLY I THINK THAT CUTTING THE CENSORSHIP IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS WOULD KIND OF GO AGAINST THE COMPETITION  (fe_03_01365-A-0014)
[LIPSMACK] THAT ARE NOT CERTIFIED  (fe_03_01365-A-0015)
I YEAH I I DON'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT THAT I MEAN UM  (fe_03_01365-A-0017)
MY GRANDMOTHER WAS A TEACHER IN A PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL FOR MANY YEARS AND I MEAN I'VE I'VE NEVER HEARD OF UM A SCHOOL OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS YOU KNOW NOT HIRING CERTIFIED TEACHERS BUT I MEAN IF THAT'S A PROBLEM THEN I THINK THAT CERTAINLY YOU KNOW TEACHERS SHOULD BE CERTIFIED  (fe_03_01365-A-0018)
OH  (fe_03_01365-A-0019)
MHM  (fe_03_01365-A-0020)
WELL I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT YOU KNOW THE BASICS SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN EVERY SCHOOL AND I MEAN I THINK THAT SHOULD DEFINITELY BE PART OF EVERY SCHOOL'S CURRICULUM UM AND I I MEAN I GREW UP IN A IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL AND UM YOU KNOW I THINK THAT I WAS GIVEN A VERY GOOD EDUCATION  (fe_03_01365-A-0022)
AND UM  (fe_03_01365-A-0023)
[LIPSMACK] I THINK THAT I I DON'T THINK YOU COULD SAY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THAT YOU KNOW PUBLIC SCHOOLS DO NOT TEACH THIS OR DO TEACH THIS I THINK THAT YOU KNOW VARIES SLIGHTLY BUT UM IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF CENSORSHIP OF YOU KNOW SPECIFIC BOOKS  (fe_03_01365-A-0024)
IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS UM I JUST THINK THAT IT'S IT'S A VERY DELICATE SITUATION I MEAN IT'S GOING LEAD TO A VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE AND IF YOU SAY WELL IF UM SOME PUPILS PARENTS SAY WELL THIS ONE BOOK  (fe_03_01365-A-0025)
YOU KNOW IT GOES AGAINST OUR OUR ETHICS WE WE DON'T LIKE IT YOU KNOW WE DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE TAUGHT YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT OUR CHILDREN READING THIS THEN WHO'S TO SAY THAT SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01365-A-0026)
THAT MAY NOT BE SO CONTROVERSIAL MIGHT GET BANNED AND YOU KNOW WHO WHO KNOWS WHERE IT'S GONNA STOP AND SOON  (fe_03_01365-A-0027)
YOU KNOW WE'LL END UP IN SITUATION LIKE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR YOU KNOW WHERE UM WHERE THERE'S JUST YOU KNOW THERE'S TOTAL CONTROL OF EVERYTHING AND YOU JUST DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ANYTHING YOU WANNA READ NOT THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAPPEN AND IF YOU IF YOU JUST START BANNING BOOKS  (fe_03_01365-A-0028)
UM JUST YOU KNOW ON THE BASIS OF THAT THEY GO AGAINST WHAT YOU BELIEVE IS CORRECT  (fe_03_01365-A-0029)
WELL YOU MEAN BY CENSORSHIP GIVING A BETTER EDUCATION YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT UM  (fe_03_01365-A-0030)
IF IF YOU WERE CHOOSING BETWEEN SOMETHING LIKE UH I DON'T KNOW OF MICE AND MEN VERSUS THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES  (fe_03_01365-A-0031)
UM YOU WOULD CHOOSE THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES RIGHT  (fe_03_01365-A-0032)
WELL I I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE  (fe_03_01365-A-0033)
THAT THERE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE TO BE A CHOICE I MEAN I THINK THAT YOU CAN ALLOW BOTH IN THE CURRICULUM I THINK WHAT THE QUESTION IS SAYING THOUGH IS THAT UM IF THERE IS A BOOK YOU KNOW SAY SAY OF MICE AND MEN WHICH WAS A BANNED BOOK UM  (fe_03_01365-A-0034)
AND YOU KNOW I HAVE SOME  (fe_03_01365-A-0035)

MHM  (fe_03_01365-A-0038)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01365-A-0039)
RIGHT BUT SOMETIMES CONTROVERSY IS GOOD I MEAN A LOT OF TIMES IF YOU KNOW IF EVERYBODY'S SECURE IN THEIR THINKING AND UM  (fe_03_01365-A-0040)
YOU KNOW NOTHING EVER CHALLENGES THEIR BELIEF SYSTEMS THEN THERE WILL BE NO CHANGE AND I MEAN YOU MIGHT THINK THAT CHANGE IS NOT GOOD BUT I MEAN ESPECIALLY BEING A BLACK AMERICAN  (fe_03_01365-A-0041)
WHAT IF YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01365-A-0042)
LIKE SAY THE AMERICAN SOUTH SAY UM YOU KNOW WE BANNED HUCKLEBERRY FINN SO THERE'D BE A LOT LESS LITERATURE SAYING THAT YOU KNOW BLACK PEOPLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THEIR RIGHTS WOULD YOU BE IN FAVOR OF YOU KNOW KEEPING THE STATUS QUO AND NOT YOU KNOW INTRODUCING ANY CHANGE SOMETIMES CHANGE IS GOOD  (fe_03_01365-A-0043)
SOMETIMES CHANGE IS NECESSARY  (fe_03_01365-A-0044)
RIGHT RIGHT I AGREE BUT I JUST THINK THAT UM CONTROVERSY IS SOMETHING THAT THAT'S NEEDED OTHERWISE WE'RE GOING TO SETTLE INTO OUR NARROW WAY OF THINKING AND THAT THAT'LL JUST BREED IGNORANCE  (fe_03_01365-A-0045)
BUT IT  (fe_03_01365-A-0046)
BUT IT'S KIND OF HARD TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH CONTROVERSY YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING LIKE WHO WHO IS TO DETERMINE I THINK IT'S JUST A IT'S A VALUE JUDGMENT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01365-A-0047)
UM  (fe_03_01365-A-0048)
RIGHT EXACTLY I THINK THAT PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE WELL WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION OF DOING THAT BUT FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS UM I REALLY I I'M JUST NOT SO SURE HOW THAT COULD BE REGULATED YOU KNOW ACROSS THE NATION  (fe_03_01365-A-0049)
MHM  (fe_03_01365-A-0050)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01365-A-0051)
MHM  (fe_03_01365-A-0052)
MHM  (fe_03_01365-A-0053)

SORRY EXTEND THAT TO UM TO THE REST OF THE NATION YOU KNOW SAYING THAT ALL PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE BETTER IN THE CURRICULUM THAN PUBLIC SCHOOLS BECAUSE I KNOW AT LEAST IN MY HOME TOWN  (fe_03_01365-A-0058)
UM OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL IS ACTUALLY IT PRODUCES MORE YOU KNOW LEADERS IN THE COMMUNITY THAN DOES OUR PRIVATE SCHOOL WHICH IS  (fe_03_01365-A-0059)
NO NO I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT OUR REGULAR PUBLIC SCHOOL I MEAN I GREW UP IN NEW JERSEY AND I GREW UP IN A VERY SMALL SUBURBAN TOWN AND WE HAVE A PUBLIC SCHOOL AND WE ALSO HAVE A PRIVATE SCHOOL WITHIN OUR TOWN AND YOU KNOW THE PRIVATE SCHOOL IS SMALLER UM [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_01365-A-0060)
YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT CURRICULUM AND THE STATISTICS SHOW THAT YOU KNOW MORE KIDS  (fe_03_01365-A-0061)
YOU KNOW A HIGHER PERCENT LIKE THE THE RATIO OF KIDS WHO GO ON TO COLLEGE IS HIGHER IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL THAN IT IS IN THE PRIVATE SCHOOL I DON'T THINK YOU CAN  (fe_03_01365-A-0062)
YEAH BUT THAT'S WHY I SAID EXACTLY BUT THAT'S WHY I SAID THE RATIO OF STUDENTS  (fe_03_01365-A-0063)
RIGHT SO I SO THAT'S WHY I'M JUST SAYING THAT YOU CAN'T NECESSARILY SAY THAT OH PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE BETTER THAN PUBLIC SCHOOLS  (fe_03_01365-A-0064)

OH OKAY [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] LISTENING TO THE TOPIC UM W-  (fe_03_01365-B-0003)
WE'RE RETIRED MILITARY AND IT'S LIKE MY CHILDREN AS THEY GREW UP THEY WERE ALWAYS IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND THERE WAS CENSORSHIP  (fe_03_01365-B-0004)
BUT NOW THAT I'VE GOT A CHILD IN PUBLIC SCHOOL  (fe_03_01365-B-0005)
I I REALLY THINK WE SHOULD CONTINUE THE CENSORSHIP BECAUSE RIGHT NOW PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE JUST GETTING EVERYTHING THROWN IN AT 'EM AND IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT GOOD MATERIAL WHAT DO YOU THINK  (fe_03_01365-B-0006)
CORRECT  (fe_03_01365-B-0007)
BUT BUT THEY'RE OUR TAX DOLLARS A-  (fe_03_01365-B-0008)
AND SO IT'S STILL IN A WAY PRIVATE DONATIONS BECAUSE THESE ARE OUR TAX DOLLARS THESE ARE OUR TAX DOLLARS THAT ARE FUNDING THESE SCHOOLS THOUGH SO TO ME IT'S STILL LIKE A PRIVATE DONATION  (fe_03_01365-B-0009)
SO I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE BETTER CONTROL OVER BOTH SECTORS PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS [MN]  (fe_03_01365-B-0010)
BUT WE WE SHOULD ALL IT IT SHOULD BE AN EQUAL BASIS BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AN EQUAL EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM  (fe_03_01365-B-0011)
UM BECAUSE IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS YOU'RE REQUIRING MORE UM OF THE TEACHERS MORE CERTIFICATION BETTER TRAINING AND WE HAVE HAD SO MANY TEACHERS IN  (fe_03_01365-B-0012)
PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT AREN'T EVEN CERTIFIED  (fe_03_01365-B-0013)
SO MAY-  (fe_03_01365-B-0014)
THAT ARE NOT CERTIFIED TEACHING  (fe_03_01365-B-0015)
ESPECIALLY IN THIS AREA  (fe_03_01365-B-0016)
THEY'VE GOT UM PEOPLE COMING IN FROM OTHER UM  (fe_03_01365-B-0017)
UM DEGREED AREAS AND THEY'RE LETTING THEM TEACH WHILE THEY WORK ON THEIR CERTIFICATION THINGS LIKE THAT  (fe_03_01365-B-0018)
IN IN A PRIVATE SCHOOL IT'S MANDATORY BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO GIVE THAT CHILD THE BEST POSSIBLE EDUCATION THERE IS AND CENSORSHIP DOES HELP ON THAT BECAUSE [SIGH]  (fe_03_01365-B-0019)
A LOT OF FACTS IN OUR LITERATURE  (fe_03_01365-B-0020)
YOU KNOW ISN'T COMPLETE  (fe_03_01365-B-0021)
WE WENT THROUGH UH THE MONUMENT TODAY IN D. C. AND READ A LOT OF THE UM  (fe_03_01365-B-0022)

TONS OF HISTORY THINGS I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW EXISTED AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS DO TEACH THAT  (fe_03_01365-B-0025)
PUBLIC SCHOOLS UH THEY LACK SO MUCH SO CENSORSHIP IS GOOD  (fe_03_01365-B-0026)
BECAUSE IT'S GONNA GET THE THE BASIC KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU NEED OUT THERE FIRST  (fe_03_01365-B-0027)
I GUESS BEING MILITARY WE'VE UM FOR TWENTY T- TWENTY SEVEN YEARS EVERYTHING'S BEEN CENSORED FOR US SO IT DOESN'T BOTHER US AS MUCH UM  (fe_03_01365-B-0032)
LIKE WITH THE WAR THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW I THINK WE'RE PUTTING TOO MUCH ON TELEVISION WE'RE TELLING TOO MANY FACTS YOU KNOW GET THE BASICS OUT THERE AND LEAVE THE REST OF IT ALONE YOU KNOW A A CHILD HAS TO HAVE A BASIC PRIMARY EDUCATION  (fe_03_01365-B-0033)
AND THAT'S WHAT CENSORSHIP DOES THAT'S WHAT I'VE SEEN SO FAR WITH WITH MY YOUNGER CHILDREN GOING TO SCHOOL  (fe_03_01365-B-0034)
CORRECT I WOULD  (fe_03_01365-B-0035)
BUT THERE WAS REAS-  (fe_03_01365-B-0036)
THERE WAS A REASON FOR BANNING  (fe_03_01365-B-0037)
THAT BOOK  (fe_03_01365-B-0038)
IT IT'S [SIGH]  (fe_03_01365-B-0039)
[MN] IT'S KIND OF HARD TO EXPLAIN I'M A BLACK AMERICAN  (fe_03_01365-B-0040)
AND IT JUST WENT AGAINST SO MANY BELIEFS THAT WE HAD  (fe_03_01365-B-0041)
IT REALLY DID UM IT BROUGHT TOO MUCH CONTROVERSY  (fe_03_01365-B-0042)
INTO THE SYSTEM  (fe_03_01365-B-0043)
THOSE TYPES OF BOOKS  (fe_03_01365-B-0044)
WELL CORRECT SOMETIMES CHANGE IS GOOD BUT IT'S GOT TO BE GRADUALLY BROUGHT IN  (fe_03_01365-B-0046)
BUT IN SCHOOL TOO MUCH CONTROVERSY IS DISRUPTIVE I THINK WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH CONTROL IN THE SCHOOLS AS IT IS NOW  (fe_03_01365-B-0047)
WELL THAT'S WHAT THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS DO THEY DETERMINE IT AND IT  (fe_03_01365-B-0048)
IN D. C. UM THEY'VE GOT THIS PROGRAM WHERE YOU CAN CHOOSE TO LET YOUR CHILD GO TO PUBLIC OR PRIVATE SCHOOL  (fe_03_01365-B-0049)
AND TH- IT COULD BE FUNDED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CHOOSING THE PRIVATE SECTOR BECAUSE OF THAT BECAUSE THEY FEEL THAT  (fe_03_01365-B-0050)
UM  (fe_03_01365-B-0051)
THE CHILDREN ARE ARE  (fe_03_01365-B-0052)
GETTING VAST MORE INFORMATION FROM THE PRIVATE SEC- UM PRIVATE SECTOR  (fe_03_01365-B-0053)
ALSO DID YOU HEAR A NEWS UM INTERVIEW ABOUT SIX DAYS AGO A CONGRESSMAN CAME ON TELEVISION AND SAID HE WOULD RATHER DROP TWELFTH GRADE AND IN- INTRODUCE PRE K.  (fe_03_01365-B-0054)
INTO THE SYSTEM  (fe_03_01365-B-0055)
SAYING THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GONNA LEARN THE MOST INFORMATION WHEN THE CHILD IS A THE  (fe_03_01365-B-0056)
AT THE YOU KNOW THE VERY TIP OF LIFE LEARNING  (fe_03_01365-B-0057)
WHY SHOULD WE DROP SOMETHING  (fe_03_01365-B-0058)
WE'VE GOT CHILDREN I MEAN JUST PASSING ON IN LIFE THEY CAN'T READ  (fe_03_01365-B-0059)
OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAVE GIVEN UP  (fe_03_01365-B-0060)
THAT UH CENSORSHIP  (fe_03_01365-B-0061)
CHALLENGES A CHILD IT REALLY DOES  (fe_03_01365-B-0062)
I REALLY DO I THINK IT MAKES A CHILD THINK  (fe_03_01365-B-0063)
AND BE MOTIVATED  (fe_03_01365-B-0064)
AND ENCOURAGED TO WANNA LEARN  (fe_03_01365-B-0065)
REPEAT THAT I'M SORRY  (fe_03_01365-B-0066)
I THINK THE PUB- UM THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS WITH THEIR CENSORSHIP THE MATERIALS THAT THEY'RE INTRODUCING TO THE CHILDREN IT ENCOURAGES THE CHILD TO THINK MORE  (fe_03_01365-B-0067)
BE MORE INDEPENDENT AND MORE ACTIVE IN THEIR COMMUNITY  (fe_03_01365-B-0068)
WELL CORRECT  (fe_03_01365-B-0069)
ARE THOSE THE SCHOOLS UM SCHOOLS FOR THE ARTS ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THOSE TYPE SCHOOLS  (fe_03_01365-B-0070)
OKAY  (fe_03_01365-B-0072)
