I BELIEVE YOU KNOW I LEARNED  (fe_03_01380-A-0050)
I THINK I WAS AHEAD WHEN I BECAUSE I WAS IN PRIVATE SCHOOL BUT THAT'S ALSO A LOT OF MONEY AND UH  (fe_03_01380-A-0051)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01380-A-0053)

TRUE BUT IN A SCHOOL YOU KNOW A CLASS OF THIRTY STUDENTS OR YOU KNOW TWENTY STUDENTS ALL THE PARENTS HAVE DIFFERENT DECISIONS SO  (fe_03_01380-A-0060)
HELLO  (fe_03_01380-B-0001)

A CORDLESS PHONE AND I PRESSED THE WRONG ONE [LAUGHTER] I DON'T KNOW IF IT MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE  (fe_03_01380-B-0004)
UM W- I I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION DID YOU HEAR IT CLEARLY MM  (fe_03_01380-B-0005)
THAT'S A GOOD TOPIC  (fe_03_01380-B-0006)
ARE YOU A MOM OR A GRANDMOM OR YOU SOUND TOO YOUNG TO BE A GRANDMOTHER  (fe_03_01380-B-0007)
OH MY GOODNESS OKAY SO IT'S GRANDMA AGAINST YOUTH [LAUGHTER] UM  (fe_03_01380-B-0008)
[LIPSMACK] HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT  (fe_03_01380-B-0009)
UM AS PARENT AND A GRANDMOTHER I DISAGREE  (fe_03_01380-B-0010)
I DON'T THINK THAT A BUNCH OF TEACHERS SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECIDE WHAT YOUR KID READS  (fe_03_01380-B-0011)
UM I THINK THAT A CURRICULUM OUGHT TO BE PRESENTED TO THE PARENTS AHEAD OF TIME SO THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THEIR CHILD IS GONNA READ THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT KIDS ARE READING AND HEARING IN SCHOOL THESE DAYS THAT ARE TOTALLY OPPOSITE OF WHAT THEIR PARENTS WANT  (fe_03_01380-B-0012)
AND I BELIEVE THAT THE PARENTS HAVE PRIORITY  (fe_03_01380-B-0013)
OVER THE TEACHERS I DON'T BELIEVE THAT TEACHERS HAVE BEEN GIVEN OUR S- OUR CHILDREN  (fe_03_01380-B-0014)
YOU KNOW UH MY GRANDCHILDREN ARE ALL IN A PRIVATE SCHOOL  (fe_03_01380-B-0015)
UM SO WE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE READING AND AND UM WHAT THEY'RE HEARING AND  (fe_03_01380-B-0016)
UM I DON'T BELIEVE THAT SOME TEACHER CAN JUST COME UP AND ASSIGN YOUR CHILD SOMETHING THAT COULD BE TOTALLY OUT OF HIS SPHERE THAT HE WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO PLUG IT INTO IT COULD BE A  (fe_03_01380-B-0017)
[LIPSMACK] IMMORAL BOOK I- AND THAT'S ALL RELATIVE ACCORDING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IT COULD UM  (fe_03_01380-B-0018)
UM  (fe_03_01380-B-0019)
IT COULD SET THE STAGE FOR FAMILY  (fe_03_01380-B-0020)
UM DISHARMONY  (fe_03_01380-B-0021)
BECAUSE THEIR THE PARENTS HAVE TAUGHT THEM ONE THING AND THEY'RE LEARNING ANOTHER IN SCHOOL  (fe_03_01380-B-0022)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01380-B-0023)
DO YOU KNOW THERE'S ACTUALLY ASSIGNMENTS IN CLASS WHERE THE KIDS ARE TOLD  (fe_03_01380-B-0024)
PARENTS  (fe_03_01380-B-0028)
AND THOSE CHILDREN ARE JUST LITTLE FRAGILE MINDS INNOCENT NAIVE  (fe_03_01380-B-0031)
AND FOR PEOPLE TO EXPOSE THEM THEY HAVE SEX EDUCATION CLASSES IN KINDERGARTEN  (fe_03_01380-B-0032)
WHERE CERTAIN GROUPS OF PEOPLE ARE COMING IN AND MAKING PRESENTATIONS TO FIVE YEAR OLDS ABOUT SEX WHEN THEY SHOULD BE OUT PLAYING IN A SAND BOX  (fe_03_01380-B-0033)
YEAH THERE'S A LOT GOING ON AND A LOT THERE'S A LOT IN FACT THERE'S A WHOLE GRASS ROOTS MOVEMENT OF PARENTS AND AND GRANDPARENTS AND AND SOME TEACHERS AND  (fe_03_01380-B-0034)
UM PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN PRIVATE IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN FACT THERE IS A HUGE MOVEMENT TO PULL THEM OUT AND PUT THEM IN UH HOME SCHOOLS HOME SCHOOLS ARE GAINING MORE CREDIBILITY ALL THE TIME  (fe_03_01380-B-0035)
YOU KNOW BUT I I STILL BELIEVE THAT THE PARENTS SHOULD HAVE THE FINAL SAY OVER WHAT THE CHILDREN ARE EXPOSED TO WHEN THEY'RE ADULT THEY CAN MAKE WHATEVER ADULT DECISIONS THEY WANT  (fe_03_01380-B-0036)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01380-B-0037)
UM  (fe_03_01380-B-0038)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01380-B-0039)
WE TALK TO MY GRANDCHILDREN YOU KNOW WHEN CERTAIN ISSUES COME UP WE TALK TO THEM  (fe_03_01380-B-0040)
BUT WE PLUG IT INTO SOMETHING THAT GIVES THEM A FOUNDATION WE DON'T JUST THROW A CRAZY IDEA OUT THERE THAT SCARES THEM TO DEATH MY LITTLE THREE YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER IS IN A IN A DAYCARE  (fe_03_01380-B-0041)
AND UH THEY'RE READING BOOKS ABOUT MONSTERS SHE'S NEVER LEARNED ABOUT MONSTERS AT HOME  (fe_03_01380-B-0042)
SHE'S TERRIFIED OF MONSTERS SHE SEES MONSTERS IN CLOSETS MONSTERS IN AN EMPTY DOG KENNEL SHE SEES MONSTERS OUT UNDER HER BED SHE LEARNED THIS IN DAYCARE WHO GAVE THEM THE RIGHT TO BRING UP MONSTERS  (fe_03_01380-B-0043)
WHY AREN'T THEY PLAYING WITH BABY DOLLS AND TEA SETS AND LITTLE TOY TRUCKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT  (fe_03_01380-B-0044)
YEAH I MEAN SHE LOOKS UNDER HER BED FOR SHOES AND THERE'S A MONSTER  (fe_03_01380-B-0045)
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO BE MAKING DECISIONS  (fe_03_01380-B-0046)
BASED UH YOU KNOW AND THAT'S MY DAUGHTER IN LAW'S FAULT YOU KNOW SHE SHOULD BE CHECKING OUT WHAT THEY'RE  (fe_03_01380-B-0047)
UM  (fe_03_01380-B-0048)
MY SON IS A SINGLE PARENT YOU KNOW BUT HIS WI- EX WIFE PUT HER IN THIS DAYCARE  (fe_03_01380-B-0050)
AND SHE DOESN'T CHECK TO SEE WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING THERE  (fe_03_01380-B-0051)
YOU KNOW BUT KATY'S TERRIFIED  (fe_03_01380-B-0052)
AND SO I I BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN BOOKS SHOULD BE CENSORED I BELIEVE THE PARENTS SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO CENSOR THEM  (fe_03_01380-B-0053)
SAYING MY CHILD IS NOT READY FOR THIS OR I DON'T WANT MY CHILD EXPOSED TO THIS  (fe_03_01380-B-0054)
I THINK IT DEPENDS ON YOU KNOW THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS BOOKS THAT MY GRANDCHILDREN SEE IN UH IN THEIR PRIVATE SCHOOL THEY GO TO A CHRISTIAN SCHOOL THAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS WOULDN'T ALLOW  (fe_03_01380-B-0055)
YOU KNOW AND SO CENSORSHIP WHAT'S RIGHT AND WRONG IS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE AUTHORITY  (fe_03_01380-B-0056)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01380-B-0057)
YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT YOU BASE IT ON  (fe_03_01380-B-0058)
THERE'S A REASON WE'VE GOT THEM IN A PRIVATE SCHOOL BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING IN PUBLIC SCHOOL AND NOT LEARNING MY MY SECOND GRADE GRANDCHILD CAN READ AS GOOD AN EIGHTH GRADER BECAUSE SHE'S LEARNING PHONICS  (fe_03_01380-B-0059)
YOU KNOW BUT THEY'RE NOT TEACHING THAT IN PUBLIC SCHOOL SO I REALLY BELIEVE YOU KNOW [MN] THE CONSTITUTION PLACES A CHILD IN THE RI- IN THE HANDS OF THE PARENTS NOT IN THE HANDS OF THE TEACHERS  (fe_03_01380-B-0060)
AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT'S WHERE IT BELONGS AND I BELIEVE THE PARENTS SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO SEE THE CURRICULUM  (fe_03_01380-B-0061)
[LIPSMACK] WHAT BOOKS ARE GONNA BE USED WHAT UH SUBJECT MATTER IS GONNA BE BROUGHT UP  (fe_03_01380-B-0062)
YOU KNOW IF IT'S ANYTHING OTHER THAN READING WRITING AND ARITHMETIC  (fe_03_01380-B-0063)
YOU KNOW BUT I'M COMING FROM SIXTY YEARS OF PARENTING AND GRAND PARENTING  (fe_03_01380-B-0064)
IT IS A LOT OF MONEY BUT YOU HA- YOUR KIDS ARE THAT IMPORTANT BUT YOU KNOW UM IT'S THAT IMPORTANT TO US DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT VALUES IT'S THAT IMPORTANT TO US THERE'S FOUR OF THEM SO YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW EXPENSIVE THAT IS  (fe_03_01380-B-0065)
THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY BUT THERE ARE ALSO AND I HAVE SEEN THESE TOO WHERE THE NATIONAL TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION ACTUALLY HAS A BOOK ON HOW TO HANDLE PARENTS THAT ARE UPSET THAT COME IN PROTESTING ABOUT SOMETHING BEING READ OR DISCUSSED  (fe_03_01380-B-0066)
AND SO THEY PUT THE PARENT OFF A CERTAIN WAY  (fe_03_01380-B-0067)
AND SO THEY THEY CENSOR THE PARENT FROM THE FROM THE CURRICULUM AND SEPARATE THEM FROM WHAT THEIR CHILD IS LEARNING  (fe_03_01380-B-0068)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01380-B-0069)
UM A WHEN I WAS GROWING UP I WAS IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL  (fe_03_01380-B-0070)
THERE WERE NO OPTIONS AND MY PARENTS WOULDN'T HAVE CARED IF THERE WAS AN OPTION I WAS PUT IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL  (fe_03_01380-B-0071)
AND  (fe_03_01380-B-0072)
I LEARNED THINGS AND READ CERTAIN BOOKS  (fe_03_01380-B-0073)
THAT I HAD NEVER BEEN EXPOSED TO AND IT IT SCREWED ME UP YOU KNOW IT IT GAVE ME NIGHTMARES IT IT DID ALL SORTS OF THINGS IT'S LIKE I I WASN'T READY TO TALK ABOUT THESE SUBJECTS  (fe_03_01380-B-0074)
[LIPSMACK] AND UM I UNDERSTAND LITTLE KATY AT THREE [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW THAT'S TERRIFIED OF SHE SEES MONSTERS EVERYWHERE YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY REASSURE HER AND SHE NEVER WAS EXPOSED TO THAT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T READ ABOUT  (fe_03_01380-B-0075)
PRETEND CREATURES THAT WERE GONNA GRAB HER  (fe_03_01380-B-0076)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01380-B-0077)
SO I REALLY UM  (fe_03_01380-B-0078)
[LIPSMACK] I'M CONCERNED YOU KNOW ONE SCHOOL WILL CENSOR  (fe_03_01380-B-0079)
UM YOU KNOW UH  (fe_03_01380-B-0080)
A BOOK YOU KNOW THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO AB- THAT IF IT VAGUELY APPROACHES GOD A PUBLIC SCHOOL WILL  (fe_03_01380-B-0081)
BUT A PRIVATE SCHOOL WILL  (fe_03_01380-B-0082)
CENSOR A BOOK ABOUT  (fe_03_01380-B-0083)
SEXUAL IMMORALITY  (fe_03_01380-B-0084)
YOU KNOW SO I THINK I THINK PRI- UH SCHOOLS SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO  (fe_03_01380-B-0085)
I THINK PARENTS SHOULD HAVE THE ULTIMATE CENSORSHIP RIGHT PERSONALLY  (fe_03_01380-B-0086)
BECAUSE MOST PARENTS ARE GOOD PARENTS AND LOVE THEIR CHILDREN  (fe_03_01380-B-0087)
