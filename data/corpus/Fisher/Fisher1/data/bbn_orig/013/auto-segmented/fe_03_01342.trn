JUST MY OPINION OF COURSE BUT BUT AH I I WAS SORRY WHEN THEY REMOVED THE PRAYER FROM THE SCHOOLS  (fe_03_01342-A-0028)
I THINK IF YOU'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE A CHOICE THEN IT SHOULD BE YOUR CHOICE TO BE ABLE TO PRAY  (fe_03_01342-A-0029)
NOT TO JUST NOT PRAY  (fe_03_01342-A-0030)
THEY REMOVED THE IT SEEMED LIKE TO ME THEY REMOVED THE CHOICE FROM THE PEOPLE THAT WANTED TO PRAY  (fe_03_01342-A-0031)
THEY NO LONGER HAVE CHOICE  (fe_03_01342-A-0032)
IT IT SEEMED LIKE THEY REMOVED THE CHOICE FROM THE PEOPLE THAT WANTED TO HAVE PRAYER  (fe_03_01342-A-0034)
AH THEY NO LONGER HAD A CHOICE IT JUST  (fe_03_01342-A-0035)

I DON'T KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYBODY DOESN'T  (fe_03_01342-A-0045)
A PROTESTANT OR A CATHOLIC AND EVERYBODY DOESN'T SAY THE LORD'S PRAYER BUT  (fe_03_01342-A-0047)
THINK THAT THINGS GOT WORSE IN THE SCHOOL WHEN THEY  (fe_03_01342-A-0049)
STOPPED DOING ALL THAT  (fe_03_01342-A-0050)
IN MY OPINION  (fe_03_01342-A-0051)
BUT MY CHILDREN ARE OLDER AND SO THEY WERE IN SCHOOL WHEN THE PRAYERS WERE STOPPED  (fe_03_01342-A-0052)
SO  (fe_03_01342-A-0053)
SO THERE WAS SOME YEARS OF THEIR SCHOOLING THAT THEY DID SAY THE PRAYER  (fe_03_01342-A-0054)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_01342-A-0056)
YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T APPRECIATE BEING FORCED TO SAY SOMETHING THAT YOU DIDN'T  (fe_03_01342-A-0057)
WELL YOU KNOW IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE I'M A CATHOLIC AND GREW UP CATHOLIC  (fe_03_01342-A-0058)
AND IN THE LORD'S PRAYER WE DON'T SAY THE LAST PART OF IT CATHOLICS  (fe_03_01342-A-0059)
FOR THINE IS THE KINGDOM YOU KNOW THAT PART OF IT AND SO WHEN THE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND ME WOULD BE SAYING THAT I WOULD JUST BE SILENT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01342-A-0060)
AND IT NEVER BOTHERED ME THAT THEY SAID A DIFFERENT PRAYER  (fe_03_01342-A-0061)
THAN I DIDN'T REALLY SAY A DIFFERENT PRAYER I JUST OMITTED THE END OF  (fe_03_01342-A-0062)
