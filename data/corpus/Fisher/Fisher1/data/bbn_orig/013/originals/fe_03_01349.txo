L:  Hi, my name is Lisa.
R:  Hi, I'm Janet and I just had a kid come in.  Go!  I'm on the phone.  [LAUGH]
L:  You what?
R:  Oh, I just had a kid come into the room.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Your name was Lisa?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, I do -- I do daycare in the afternoons.  I have a house full.
L:  Okay.
R:   And I -- I totally forgot about this project.
L:  So did I!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  It's like, "This is who?"  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, the topic i- i- is on --
R:  Is cen- censorship with books.
L:  Right.  And do you believe that the school have a right --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to censor what books the kids read?
R:  Well, they -- they did say private and public.  I think in a private school they do.
L:  Oh, I agree with you a hundred percent there.
R:  Because, you know, it's -- their parents are paying for them to have a very set curriculum and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- very controlled.  But in a public school setting I don't think so.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  I -- I think that should be up to the parents.
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- I agree with you there too.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Uh, there are some books out there that some kids would like to -- I mean, I've even seen a TV show where that was the topic and this kid was getting kicked out of school for reading Huckleberry Finn and -- because it wasn't in the school curriculum -- and -- and I saw nothing wrong with that book, you know, i- i- i- I -- I didn't understand, you know, if it's in the public library   [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I- I'm not sure why they would do that.  There's a lot of racism in that book.
L:  Right.
R:  But +racinism is something that children need to learn about, and --
L:  That's right.
R:  I'd rather them learn about it in a fantasy setting than in real life!  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  And -- and the teachers are there to guide them in the right direction.
R:   Mhm.
L:  A- as far as any racism or something like that.  So 
R:   Right.  I haven't -- I have not run into any problems with that yet, with my -- my kids.  My oldest is only eleven.
L:  Okay.  My -- my only is two and a half!  So I -- I've got a lot way to go.
R:  You got a long ways to go, yeah!  [LAUGH]  But I would have a problem if the school was to tell me [MN] what my children could not read.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I'm --
L:  Exactly.
R:  I'm very involved with their education and I do a lot of research and I choose books for them that I want them to read.  Sometimes based on different concepts that I want them to learn.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I just picked a book called, Island of The Blue Dolphins.
L:  Okay.
R:  Which deals with a- abandonment and survival and living a- alone, a girl who's abandoned by her family.  And I -- I think it's a great -- great book!  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  I read it first and it talked about inner strength --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- and  they did have it -- it was a fantasy setting, they were -- they were, I think, on a tropical island and everybody moved and they like, forgot her!  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh!
R:  And they all moved accidentally without her and left her behind!
L:  Mm.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  But she had to look to herself then to survive, and --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- I thought it had really good  r- really good messages and i- i- it did send my daughter into tears a few times --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because she was crying and said.
L:  Sure.
R:  But, you know, that's -- those emotions too are all part of life and 
L:  Well, that's right.  That's right.  You know, I wouldn't want my, um, the school to have my child reading books about, you know, th- the KKK and, um, white +supremacism and things like that.  You know, I wouldn't mind them banning that kind of reading.  Um, but things like, well, like you're talking about, that -- that would instill a certain message into the child.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, to help them with -- with their growing up a- and the turmoil that they're going to go through.
R:  Right.
L:  Trying to reach --
R:  Well, you still may, at p- some point, may want to have your child read a book on the KKK.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that would open up then an opportunity for you to discuss --
L:  Right.
R:  -- th- those situations and for you to help guide their moral outlook, as opposed to them hearing about it on some talk show or ?
L:  [MN]  Oh, oh, sure, yeah.
R:  Because it's [NOISE] so, you know, it's like -- I -- I would have a problem if their school was to assign a book on the KKK.
L:  Oh, yeah, that's -- basically that's -- that -- that's really -- that's what I --
R:  But --
L:  -- what I'm thinking, yes.
R:  Yeah.  But if i- if I want to -- my children to read it and it'll help open dialogue.  I have problems with the -- i- the homosexuality issues, so I [LAUGH] -- I  have to get books to help me with those!  And [MN] --
L:  Sure.  Sure.
R:  And help me with the dialogue.  And sometimes that -- that just helps!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I -- I think no one should, um, I -- I -- to me it's up to the -- the individual's choice on what they read or listen to or watch.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You can change the channel.  You cannot buy the CD, huh, and you could just not read the book.  You know.  So, I -- I don't think the schools should ban -- the -- the public --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- schools should ban it.
R:  Mm, right, this -- i- it's too sensitive and it crosses too many family barriers and 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Different, you know, like, Huckleberry Finn, I can't imagine why anyone would have a problem with that.
L:  [MN]
R:  That was classical literature.
L:  [MN]
R:  I think I read it in school when I was a kid!
L:  E- exactly.  Exactly. You know.  And it was so funny for -- for me to see a TV show that -- that addressed that book in particular.  And I was like --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- Jeez!  And I'm sure the show was Family Ties.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I saw it on a rerun recently.  And I -- and I was like, wow!  [LAUGH]  I- i- 
R:  Actually, one of my favorite stories is The King and I and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  i- it deals a lot with -- with slavery and polygamy [LAUGH]!  Some guys like fifty wives!  [NOISE]
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Um  I can't really decide what -- what we shouldn't be doing.  It's so hard to think of ten minutes worth of stuff, I'm trying --
L:  I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [COUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  So, do you read to your child now?
L:  Oh, I've been reading to him since before he was born.
R:  Oh, before -- you started before?
L:  And he, um --
R:  Okay, I --
L:  -- he absolutely loves books.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, he -- he's to a point now though, that I'm -- being -- being only two and a half, uh, he has a very large vocabulary already.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Joseph, I mean, he -- he -- he'll read the pictures to me, you know, tell me the story, you know, like, "Tell me the story".  And he'll tell me, you know, what's happening in the pictures.  And sometimes he just gets frustrated and he'll say, "The end" and walk away!  You know, he --
R:  Yeah, I -- I have a one and a half year old too, and her favorite are the counting books.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  She likes counting books.  Counting back and forth!  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  It's -- it's funny --
L:  Great.
R:  -- because she'll put the book in the different directions, the [inaudible] going up and down and, you know, she really enjoys that and ...
L:  Yeah, mine's -- mine's got -- been into books since, God, I can't even remember when.  Always had books.
R:  Yeah.  I started them at -- at birth.  I didn't start at before that!  [LAUGH]  But at birth.  And w- with the children I -- i- I find it really hard but I try to find books that show kids of different ethnic groups and stuff all together.
L:  Oh, sure.  Sure.
R:  I live in California, which is very ethnically diverse.  It's actually hard --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to find books like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's -- it's -- especially ten years ago, with my older one, there was like, none, it was very difficult.  They would -- you could find all the different races but not all together.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Also, I like, um, I have him watching the Disney Channel all the time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you see a lot of the -- the diversity in the races on -- even the Cartoon Scam Ring that's on in the morning.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I -- I think that is fantastic.  Um, because he does have cousins that are -- are inter racial.  And I -- I don't want him grow -- you know, I want him growing up loving all a- and, um, understanding.  So 
R:  Yeah.  That's kinda -- I -- I -- been teaching sorta like that, it's more like accepting, it's that you --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- don't think anything of it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, someone's skin color is not a- any more interesting than having different colored hair.  [LAUGH]
L:  And that's right.  That's right.
R:  And it works!  Using books and programs like that does work.  My children are very accepting and open and -- it took -- my older daughter's got a blind boy in her class now.  And it took me a long time to figure out that he actually was blind.
L:  Really?
R:  [LAUGH]  Because he was just so accepted.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And she thought nothing of it and she talked about him like he was anybody else.  And I had asked her if he was blind and she said, "No".  But he had a braille writer [LAUGH] and all his -- his work has to be translated, so I was trying to figure out what -- what was going on.
L:  Right.
R:  But she -- she just  th- that I knew that he was blind, she didn't really give that much thought at all.
L:  A- at that age they probably don't.
R:  It was just much more -- much more interesting that he had a braille writer!  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  And you've got to teach your kids that there is -- there are people out there that are different.
R:  Mhm.
L:  In -n -n many different ways.
R:  Yeah.  I'm really glad she's getting exposed to someone like that at such a young age and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is so accepting of him and  that he was -- his parents did not segregate him, he's in their with the rest of the kids, doing the same things.
L:  And, in fact, I -- I'm a little nervous that [MN] I won't be able to keep up with him once he starts [LAUGH] school and -- and the homework assignments that he brings home!  Um, I'm -- I'm really fearful that I won't be able to help him with his homework, the way the kids are so much more advanced than I was a child!  [MN]
R:  Well, if you're a stay at home mom you can get involved at school.  So you're right --
L:  Yeah.  Well, see, I work full time.
R:  Ah, oh that makes it harder.
L:  Yes it does.
R:  And it sounds like you may have a bright one though too, so they have a -- the Gate program.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, at least, here in California they have a Gate program, it's for the -- the gifted and talented --
L:  Right.
R:  -- education.  And they challenge the kids more at school, th- their assignments are modified and then they have additional classes.
L:  Right.
R:  That are after school.  That are really fun.  They do things like plays and have science projects --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and stuff.  And it really helps with that.
L:  Yeah, I -- I plan on relying on the school to, you know, broaden his horizons and -- and extend his mind as much as they can.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, getting back to the topic, you know, I -- I really don't agree that they should censor, you know, what he reads.  Um 
R:  What should they censor it based on?
L:  Well, that was the topic, of th- on books.
R:  Mhm.
L:  For tonight.  It was the topic [inaudible] censoring the books that they re-
