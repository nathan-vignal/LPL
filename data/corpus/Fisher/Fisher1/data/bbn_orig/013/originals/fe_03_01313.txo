R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Jackie.  How are you doing?
R:  [LAUGH] Good.  This is Julie.  I'm fine.
L:  Uh, well, Julie, in response to the question, I think it does help.  Um, I am not a smoker and I -- I think it's something that just brings the awareness out of what smoking can do for you.
R:  Yeah, I think it helps minimally.  I am all for the banning of smoking in public places.  I'm not a smoker either, so I am --
L:  Well --
R:  -- all for that.  It [LAUGH] -- it -- we -- we don't like coming home from restaurants smelling like a big cigarette and breathing [inaudible].
L:  Well, I can't say that I'm all for it because if we totally take it away from them, then the smokers will say they have no rights, but I think that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there should definitely be a smoking section that is away from the non smoking section so that you don't have to go through a smoking section to get to a non smoking.
R:  Well, that's a good point, but as for their rights, [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, right, they have rights that --
R:  -- I guess I don't really -- we have rights, too, that we don't have to -- to breathe that in.
L:  Right, we have rights, too, and so many times our rights are not heard or paid attention to.
R:  Exactly.
L:  So, okay.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  Did we answer that question? [LAUGH]
R:  Mr. Computer? [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  I wonder if we should hit pound.
R:  Oh, is that what we're s- -- yeah, maybe so.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, right here. [NOISE] Did you hit it?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Are you still there?  Hm.
L:  Hm.  I wonder if we're supposed to go into a real heated debate about it?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  Where are you from?
L:  I'm from -- well, I live in a little city outside of Shreveport, Louisiana.
R:  Okay.
L:  And you?
R:  [COUGH] I'm up in the Minneapolis area.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  I thought I --
L:  Is --
R:  -- detected a little southern accent there.
L:  Yeah, just a little. [LAUGH]
R:  Um --
L:  Is this your first study with these?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mine too.
R:  Oh, all right.  I wonder how we're doing. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, [LAUGH] I don't know.  Obviously not too good since we can't make Mr. Computer go on. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Maybe we should be quiet for a little bit.
L:  Maybe, okay. [NOISE]
R:  Hm. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Hm.
R:  Okay. [NOISE] Um, let's see.  Do you have your little sheet that it tells --
L:  No, I'm in the car.
R:  When you may receive a call, PIN followed by pound, dit dit dit dit dah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Answer the [inaudible] ... doesn't say anything.  I guess we're supposed to go on for ten minutes. [SIGH] Hm.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  Um, I think -- let's see.  Um, hm.  I think I said what I think.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We ask you to speak on a proposed topic for at least eight minutes.  Oh, okay, so we're supposed to go on.  Um, all right, smoking.  Do you think the advertisements -- is that what it said?  Do you think the advertising and stuff have made a difference?
L:  I think it makes an awareness in the younger generation.
R:  Is -- is that what it said?  Okay, I didn't -- I didn't really --
L:  Well -- well, it was talking about the awareness, is it -- is it m- minimizing the smokers is the way I interpreted the question.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And I think it's making an awareness in the younger generation, um --
R:  You know, I think it is, too, but aren't the, um, the statistics show that there's even more [NOISE] younger aged kids smoking today than -- than, like, in our time?
L:  Than before.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like -- like -- like, in our time.  Um --
R:  So, even with the knowledge, they're still continuing to -- to smoke.  I don't -- I don't get it.  Maybe it's a coolness thing.
L:  Well, I think it's a -- you know, it's a coolness thing and then some of it's a lack of parental guidance, too.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, but then, there again, the cigarettes are what, up to three bucks a pack or something?  Where are they getting the money for this stuff?  I don't understand.  But, um --
L:  Well, uh, but then so many -- that -- that's where the parental guidance comes in, though --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because parents give 'em money and drop 'em off at malls or drop 'em off here or there or whatever, just so the parents don't have to deal with 'em.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So, it's, you know, it's -- and the kids are gonna find a way.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Somebody thinks it's cool and so, yeah, they'll pick it up for you and --
R:  Yeah.  So, you think the restaurants and things should have a separate entrance for sm- -- for non smokers?  Is that kinda what you were saying?
L:  Yeah.  Almost like a -- a segregated issue.
R:  Yeah.  See, I think that would --
L:  Well, you know, I hate to --
R:  I think that would almost cost them more money to -- to, you know, rearrange and configure their restaurants than it would be just to say -- 'cause, like, in California and everywhere that they've already banned it, I think their business is picking up.  I think that that's what has come back on the news, anyway, is that their business is actually increasing, that since they've increased -- or since they've cut out smoking --
L:  Now -- yeah --
R:  So, that's probably the cheaper option for them if you --
L:  I think for the -- for the businesses it's a cheaper option, um, and -- and I think if -- I mean, I'm -- I'm totally against it, I can't stand the smell of it.
R:  I know, [LAUGH] I am, too.
L:  [LAUGH] But at the same --
R:  I feel bad for my kids.  I have young kids and when we go out to eat, they're just -- I even have a little, you know, one year old and he just breathes in all that stuff, and it's just --
L:  Well, my mother smokes and I have a two year old, and, you know, he'll tell her, "Grandma, you stink".
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know --
R:  You know, I've got a -- I've got a friend that he -- she's got a little baby, a little eight month old baby, and he will not even go to his grandma 'cause she smells like cigarettes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He -- he -- yeah.
L:  Well, you know, and they walk in the house and you smell them before you ever see them.
R:  I know, I know.  I just -- I'm --
L:  And this, you know, how can you walk around smelling like a wet ashtray?
R:  I know.  I'm totally --
L:  And then --
R:  -- for the banning.  I -- I -- I don't -- I -- I mean, I understand the rights and everything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but [SIGH] come on, I -- I don't know.  It -- we have rights, too.  If they -- if they wanna kill themselves, I think they should go somewhere else and kill themselves, and I think they can go a whole hour without a cigarette at a restaurant.  I mean, if they can't they're in big trouble. [LAUGH] [COUGH] As I cough. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  As I have the smoker's cough there.  Oh, jeeze.
L:  Well, and they say second hand smoke is just as dangerous if not worse than primary smoke.
R:  Right, 'cause it's not filtered, yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's -- I don't know.  And airports at least are making 'em go outside.  I mean, I think that's -- you know, why can't they say, "Go outside"?
L:  But if they're gonna make 'em go outside, make 'em go far enough away from the building so that those of us who do not smoke don't have to walk straight through it.
R:  Exactly, yeah.  That's a good point, too.
L:  I mean, what's the point of making them go outside if they're gonna be clamored around the door so that it either rushes to the doors when the doors open or you --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- walk through a pillow of blue smoke trying to get in.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  That's --
L:  It's like going to a nightclub.  You -- you smell the same way.
R:  Yeah.  Now, nightclubs, I -- you know, that I guess -- I don't know, that's gonna be really hard to -- to try and ban that.  But restaurants, I don't know.  I just think it's the restaurants are for families to go out and have dinner.  We don't need to breathe in that crap.  I choose not to go to nightclubs because of that reason.  I don't want to breathe the smoke.
L:  Well, I do, too.  I don't like the -- the smoke.
R:  But restaurants, come on, they're for everybody and I -- I -- I -- you know, if they wanna go drink and smoke, go tell 'em to go to a bar and have bar food.  That's what I feel. [LAUGH]
L:  Go for it.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yay.
R:  And I've just recently gotten this bad since I've had kids.  I mean, I -- I didn't really mind it before, but since I've had kids I just [SIGH] -- I -- I just feel sorry for them.  I mean, I've already had my damage done to my lungs, breathing in everybody's smoke, but [LIPSMACK] I don't want them to. [SIGH] So ...
L:  And I think the -- the tobacco makers should be the ones that have to pay -- and I'm sure they are, but I -- you know, I've never done the research -- for all of the commercials on smoking.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And b- -- you know, against the smoking and stuff.  That should not come out of my money.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  I mean, that's a choice I don't make, so therefore those people that are w- -- that are willing to pay the three or four dollars, however much it is --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- they can pay to educate themselves on their retarded behavior.
R:  Exactly.  I'm for that.  I hear ya.  I agree with ya there. [SIGH]
L:  So ...
R:  And as far as them taxing cigarettes, you know, you go for it.  If -- if you --
L:  Tax it all.
R:  Tax it all. [LAUGH] That's fine.  They can afford a four dollar pack of cigarettes, they can afford to pay more taxes and, you know.
L:  If -- e- exactly.  You know, if -- if they think they can't live without it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if they have to pay that four dollars, well, then, let 'em.  Charge 'em.
R:  That's funny you say --
L:  It's unhealthy.
R:  -- they can't live without it.  They can't live with it.  It's just, you know -- it's like how can you --
L:  It's an oxymoron.
R:  I know. [LAUGH] I know it is. [COUGH] Okay.
L:  So ...
R:  Let's see.  So, um, what -- hm.
L:  Now, where you -- have they totally banned it in all your restaurants?
R:  Oh, no, no.  I think just a couple of small towns here have.
L:  Now, I know, um, one of our Tex Mex restaurants has banned it on Sundays.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, really?  You know what?  That's true.  One of our --
L:  During certain -- during lunch hours.
R:  Yeah, one of our pizza places here has banned it on the weekends from, like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- five to midnight, yeah.
L:  And I guess that's more of a family time, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, like, from lunch to, like, seven it's banned.
R:  Yeah, so they're definitely probably hearing complaints and the restaurants are trying to do something about it, I guess, and they're --
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  I think that, um, [LIPSMACK] another --
R:  But it just --
L:  -- thing that unnerves me, other than the fact that you have to walk through the smoking section to get to the non smoking, is the fact that they're, you know, not separated enough.
R:  Oh, I know.  It cracks me up some of these restaurants have smoking like, you know, one table next to you is smoking.
L:  The very next booth is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- non -- it's non smoking.
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  So, it's like, what's the point?
R:  Yeah, exactly.  That is not even --
L:  Or you walk in and the smell hits you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Even over the aromas of the -- of the restaurant.
R:  Yeah, and then they try to put the ceiling fans in to try and, you know, blow it out.  It's like --
L:  Yeah, l- let's lift it up, right.
R:  Yeah, let's -- [LAUGH] yeah, just blow it all over the place. [COUGH]
L:  So ...
R:  I don't know. [LIPSMACK] Has it been eight minutes?
L:  That was an interesting topic.
R:  Very interesting.  And it's something I feel very strongly about, too, so I -- I don't know, I guess ... I don't know if that's what they wanted to hear, but ... [LAUGH] [NOISE] Sorry about that, toy box.
L:  Oh. [inaudible]
R:  [NOISE] Oh.  I just punched --
