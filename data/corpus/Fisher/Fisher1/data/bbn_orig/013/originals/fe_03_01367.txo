R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?  Hi.
R:  Hi.  I'm Lindsey, what's your name?
L:  I'm Ed Diskowski in Durham, North Carolina.
R:  Oh, I'm in Dallas, Texas, so, pretty far down.
L:  I c- I can't -- I -- I'm a little hard of hearing, I can't hear you.
R:  Oh, I'm sorry, I said, I'm in Dallas, Texas.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Uh, so 
L:  I didn't quite get what the subject was, could you tell me?
R:  Um, it's censorship in the schools.  Do you feel that public or private schools have the right to ban books?
L:  Oh.
R:  Or -- no, not the right to ban books but have the right to restrict reading, I think.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You know.
L:  Well, I -- I don't think public schools have a right to restrict reading, but private schools, I guess, can do what they want.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  I guess so.  It depends on -- I guess -- the only thing I would say is that the private schools are receiving funding, like, federal funding, then they need to, you know, keep their -- I don't know -- themselves in line.
L:  Okay, I'll agree with you there.  If -- if they're getting public -- public funding then they should not be able to restrict.  I'm in favor of, more -- the more information you have the better, so we should open, uh --
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  Everything should be --
R:  I agree with that, to the most -- for the most part.  It just seems like they're so  there's so many books out there and I am not a fan of censorship in general, um, but at the same time I think if I were to have children I would be a little bit wary if they came home and were reading something that I -- and I don't know what that would be, particularly, um, that I would find really offensive but I know --
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh yeah, that -- yeah, it has to be appropriate for the children's age of course.  I --
R:  Right.
L:  I agree, I agree with you.
R:  I mean, you know, at Berkley they study the, you know, the poetry of Tupac Shakur, you know, rappers, and I kind of just have to -- that's fine, it's, you know, it's college and I think it should be in a pub- at a private college instead of a public one, but, you know, as long as my kid isn't coming home doing something that I find highly offensive, I think it's good for them to -- to read and also to learn why -- to find out why things are banned.  Because a lot of the times I really have no idea why a book was banned.  Uh, it's like the people that ban the Harry Potter books.  I find that insane.  [LAUGH]  I find that really crazy!
L:  Oh really?  Harry Potter's been banned?  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, a lot of people don't like Harry Pot- a lot of, um, very conservative people don't like Harry Potter because he, um, because it talks about witchcraft and --
L:  Oh, I --
R:  -- sorcery and things like that.  But --
L:  Well  but it's --
R:  Which --
L:  But it's just a fairytale sort of.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, I agree.  And I think that -- I mean, I've read the Harry Potter books, I think they're -- they're very well written and they're good stories and, you know, I'm like you, it's not profane and whatever gets the kids interested in reading, it's a lot better than most -- most of what's on TV, so 
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.  I remember when I was a kid I -- I used to read, uh, fantasy books that weren't necessarily true to life but I enjoyed them.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  I remember reading about Brer Rabbit.
R:  Oh yes!
L:  [LAUGH]  I --
R:  I think actually Brer Rabbit has been banned.
L:  Pardon?
R:  I think that was -- that's been banned.
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  I -- the Uncle Remus -- Uncle Remus has been banned.
L:  Yeah, Uncle Remus, right.
R:  Mhm.  Uncle Remus has been banned because it portrays African Americans in a light that is not appropriate.
L:  Oh, I see, oh, okay.
R:  But I -- yeah, I grew up on them.  I never thought of it that way, I just thought of Uncle Remus as Uncle Remus.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  But I think that sometimes stuff like that makes you more think more about -- makes you think of things in a light that's really not good that you never thought about before.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yu- which is sad.  But 
L:  Yeah, I [MN] --
R:  And, like, yeah.
L:  I think people tend to take things to extreme sometimes.
R:  Oh, I think so too.  I think that most of the time what they talk about is -- are things going to extremes and, but  most- mostly I don't have a problem with it.  If it's -- if it's really  if it's age appropriate I don't have a problem with it.  I wouldn't want --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, ten year old children reading The Catcher In The Rye where he's spouting out this and that every second, but, you know, if you're in high school and you hear that left and right anyway, you know.  I mean, I think that they shouldn't have to read it but I don't think it should be banned.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Okay.
R:  You know.
L:  Well, I pretty much agree with you.
R:  Yeah.  I think most people are kinda like that.  Just, uh, I think it would be interesting to talk to someone who really felt, really one way or the other.  Most people are pretty middle of the road.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would wonder what it would be [MN] so, it'd be interesting to see what people would think.  But at the same time, I don't even have children, so I don't know how that would affect, you know, my point of view.
L:  Yeah, we don't have children either, so it hasn't been a problem for us.
R:  Right.  And I wonder it's -- it's funny, I talked to a lady earlier that had children and -- but she -- she pretty much felt the same way.  She said that one time her kids in high school came home with a permission slip to watch an R. rated movie and she didn't think that that was appropriate for them.
L:  Say it again?
R:  Um, her children came home once with a permission slip to watch an R. rated movie.
L:  Oh, oh, okay.
R:  And she th- she didn't think that that was appropriate and --
L:  Uh huh.
R:  -- you know.  I don't know if I would have had a problem with it or not but I guess it would have [inaudible] the movie!
L:  Well, I guess it would depend on the book.
R:  That as well.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So  but there's so much -- and culturally even.  I mean, we were talking about, there's so much violence in American society that's considered just completely appropriate.  And --
L:  Yeah, I -- I don't like violence, I don't even like watching violence on -- on television.  I won't g- I don't go to violent movies.  But, I think life should be enjoyable and I don't -- I don't get any fun out of watching people get hurt.
R:  Oh, me neither.  It's crazy that that seems so appropriate but yet, you know, coarse language or, you know, sexual situations people have this huge problem with.
L:  Yeah.
R:  When, to me, that's more natural than the violence.
L:  Yeah, I -- I don't object to coarse language since that's -- that's real life.  Uh 
R:  Mhm.
L:  If pe- if that's the way people talk, well, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- why can't we accept it?  But, uh, I don't  enjoy violence just for violence sake.
R:  No.  I don't know, but, I -- I think whenever I do have kids I will still read them Uncle Remus.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Yes, good.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  And I will read -- I will read them -- Little Black Sambo was the other one that was -- that was banned that was for young children.
L:  Oh yeah, I remember about that one, yeah.
R:  I remember Little Black Sambo.  If I can find a copy of Little Black Sambo I will read Little Black Sambo, because I love Little Black Sambo!
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, just so many things that just -- and they will get Harry Potter and they will get the Oz books and the Chronicles of Narnia and just -- all of those.  So, I can't imagine limiting my children that way.
L:  Okay, good.
R:  But, to your expense.  Uh, so, how did you end up doing this survey?
L:  How did I get -- get involved?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, let's see.  I think I saw an ad somewhere in the paper.
R:  Oh, really!
L:  If I remember correctly.
R:  Is this the first time that you've done one?
L:  Pardon?
R:  Is this the first time that you've participated?
L:  No, this is the second -- second time.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  This your first?
R:  It's -- oh, it's my second as well.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  I guess they're calling people all again to see  I don't know!  [LAUGH]  That's funny, I didn't realize they had paper ads for them.
L:  Pardon?
R:  I said, I didn't realize that they -- that they advertised in the paper, but it makes sense, you know.
L:  Well, as I say, I do- I don't remember exactly how I found out about it.
R:  Right.
L:  But I think I  I think I saw it in -- in -- in a -- in a paper somewhere.
R:  Well, that's probably true.
L:  But I'm not sure.
R:  So how's Rowley right now, is it pretty?  Are you in Rowley right now?
L:  Well, I'm in Durham.
R:  You're in Durham, okay.
L:  We're -- which is right near Rowley.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It's -- it's -- we -- we've had a beautiful day today, it was nice and warm and sunny and flowers are blooming all over the place.
R:  Mm.
L:  Most.
R:  I miss it.
L:  Great.
R:  I went and saw a friend of mine and went through Salem, she was graduating from, um, North Carolina School for -- of the Arts.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  In May.
L:  Uh huh.
R:  And, um, I loved it up there, it was so nice.  I really enjoyed it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Pretty area.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, it's a beautiful area.
R:  Mm.  People are really nice.
L:  We -- we -- we have lived here about, I don't know, t- twenty five years before and, uh, moved away to Tennessee for a job and when I retired we decided to come back to Durham, so we moved -- moved back here about three years ago.  And we're very happy here.  Good place to retire to.
R:  [LAUGH]  I would think so.  It, you know, it seems -- everybody seemed really nice and it -- the whole area, it seems very, um, gentile, I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which -- which I liked.  It seemed -- I was afraid that -- I'm from Louisiana and I thought, "Oh, wow, that's really far north!"
L:  Yes!  [LAUGH]
R:  But it's [LAUGH] it's really not and it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's -- I just really had -- there is a lot of charm to the area and I would definitely like to spend more time there, I was only there about a week, so [LIPSMACK] I'd definitely plan on going back some time.
L:  Yeah, well, because of the three universities nearby, the area is, sort of, international, you have restaurants from
