R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, this is --
L:  Hi, my name is Cindy.
R:  My name is Kathy.
L:  Nice to talk with you, Kathy.
R:  Thank you.  Um --
L:  Uh  this is funny, this is the fifth call I've had today on the same subject.
R:  This is the second I've had.
L:  Oh no!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  D- do they pay?
R:  I hope so.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Me too, today's my first day.
R:  Oh [LAUGH] okay.
L:  So 
R:  I haven't y- I haven't gotten a check yet but I -- I imagine they probably do.
L:  Okay.  So, what do you think about this topic?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, I think that censors- censorship is, um, harmful.  I think that, um, and I think that -- that reading can't do anything but help and I feel that in -- in a private or a public setting, as long as parents are involved, it doesn't matter what the kids have.
L:  I agree, a hundred percent.
R:  Mhm.
L:  A hundred percent.  I have three kids and I think that if the parents are okay with it, then I don't think the schools should have anything to do with it.
R:  I don't think so, either.
L:  And if they have any material that some people deem to be questionable, then have it where each individual's parent can maybe sign a permission slip or something to that effect.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So   Do you have children?
R:  I have three.
L:  How old are they?
R:  Well, they're -- they're not children any more, they're all ad- they're all adults at this point.  But it's a matter that I put them all through school and I -- I signed waivers for -- for all of them to be able to go into -- to the next level up because I think children should all stretch.
L:  I do too.
R:  I don't think that you should have to have any child bend to -- to learn, I think they should all h- have everything a little bit out of their reach so they have to stretch to get it.
L:  Right.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, right.
L:  I agree.  I have a child in the third grade --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that reads on an eighth grade level.
R:  Yeah.  That's where my kids are -- are over -- way advanced.
L:  Yeah.  And --
R:  And my son was re- read the, um, the story for head start 'cause I was ill and I couldn't -- couldn't go out and play --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with him, so I taught him how to play poker and how to read, when he was two!  [LAUGH]
L:  That's awesome.
R:  He's -- he's very intelligent.  He was very easy to teach, so [MN].
L:  Yeah, I just -- I think they're trying to get too involved.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  I think they are too.  I think government needs to step back from the family.
L:  Right.  They're --
R:  I think they're --
L:  -- putting in too much and taking away too many 
R:  Too many rights --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for parents.
L:  Right.  Too many rights, too many freedoms.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, I mean, we send our children to school to learn.
R:  [MN]
L:  And  how can they learn everything that they need to learn to face the real world if the government's taking away one of the most important things?  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I wouldn't want a kindgartener reading about sex, but --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- you know.
R:  I feel like -- I feel like, uh, aside from the fact that most kids don't -- wouldn't understand it if they did read it, until they're ready to do it.
L:  Right.
R:  I think that, uh, you know, I think that kids learn on the -- learn at the rate that they're meant to -- to assimilate it.
L:  Right.  Age appropriate.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I agree.
R:  Yeah [MN].
L:  I have a -- a nine year old boy, an eleven year old girl, and a fourteen year old boy.
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  And, you know, kids are starting sexual activities earlier --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- than they were --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- years ago.
R:  Yes.
L:  And, I would rather my children read the material --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and have an idea of --
R:  What's going on.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the sexually transmitted diseases they can catch.
R:  Yeah.
L:  About pregnancy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- adoption, abortion.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, all these things that could happen.  HIV --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and whatnot, than to have them go into it blindly.
R:  Yeah, that's the way I feel too.  I mean, I don't think that -- that foul language is appropriate any place but it's a matter that, you know, if they -- they read it in a book it's not quite s- quite so shocking when it comes up in real life.
L:  Right.
R:  And I -- 'cause you can always shut the book, uh, you can't always shut your ears.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's --
L:  And I don't think it's so much maybe the -- the shocking language, if they would do it in more, I guess you'd say clinical terms.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Use the appropriate terms.
R:  Yes.
L:  And teach them right from wrong from day one.
R:  I think so too.  I just -- I just think that as long as -- as you have people out there that want to take away your rights as a parent, I think that the parents should decide.  I think as long as parents are involved then the kids will probably work out right.  But if they're not involved then the kids are gonna go wrong anyway.
L:  Right, they're left on their own --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- to do whatever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's where you have kids get involved in pornography.
R:  Yes, drugs, pornography, all the other bad things.
L:  Right.  Instead of sex ed- sex education they're getting into pornography and they're not learning --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the right thing.
R:  Th- they're not learning the right stuff.  I mean, my -- I was a foster parent and I had a twelve year old come in and tell my children, with very bad language, just what had happened to her in her household, why she was taken out.
L:  Oh goodness.
R:  And I'm sitting there, I says -- and they says, you know, my daughter comes out with a string of foul language and says, "Is this what really happens?"  I says, "Well" I says, "Number one, we don't use that kind of language to describe anything".  I says, "And number two, that should only happen between a- grown ups, it should never happen between an adult and a child".
L:  Right.
R:  I says, "Now" and I sat her down and told her all the right stuff and then told her all the stuff th- that wasn't supposed to go on and then, you know, and, you know, she was -- she was only like, six.  And, I mean, you really don't --
L:  Goodness.
R:  -- expect to have a six year old learning this stuff from a twelve year old that shouldn't have known it in the first place.
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh, I'm sitting there and then I says, "Well" I says, "You know" I says, "Bad things happened to her".  I says, "This is not her fault, this -- bad things happened to her, but she's got --" you know, I told her that, you know, I took the other child apar- apart and told her that this was not an appropriate thing for her to be saying.  Uh, that if she wanted to talk about that maybe she'd better talk to me first so that we could tell -- find out what she could say to the other kids because they weren't as old as she was.
L:  Right.
R:  And that -- that way, you know, everybody was kind of -- kind of satisfied that way.  Because she wanted to get -- get -- get it out, but she -- I had to -- had to limit what she was saying and how she was saying it, because it was appropriate for her to get it out.
L:  Right.
R:  But it wasn't appropriate to get it out to another child.
L:  Right.
R:  And --
L:  We  read a lot here at home --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I really enjoy the true crime stories.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'm reading one now about a family in Ohio where there were twelve children in the home.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And as each of the daughters turned thirteen the dad married them.
R:  Oh my Lord!
L:  And then, you know, proceeded to have sex with them.
R:  Oh.
L:  And my daughter picked up my book.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she, you know, thumbed through a few pages and -- and she came across a page where one of the -- the girls was describing to social workers about what their dad had done to them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she said, "Mom!"
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I, you know, I told her, I said, "Well, honey, number one, this is why I ask you not to pick up my books".
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, "You have yours and I have mine --"
R:  Mm.
L:  "-- and, you know, things like this happen in the world and it's unfortunate that they happen, you know".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she's been through, uh, teen choice programs --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at school.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where they teach them about abstinence and things like that.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  And i- how to respect themselves and -- and take care of themselves.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I mean, these were the things I had to sign permission slips for.
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  And out of, I think, fifteen, twenty girls in her class, there were only eight or ten of them that were allowed to go.
R:  Oh my goodness, now, see --
L:  And --
R:  -- that to me is something that should be automatic because they should learn about this 'cause I think keeping children blind about things like this just causes -- yeah, I mean, the first thing you know, they're gonna be the ones that are com- coming up pregnant.
L:  Right.
R:  It's kinda like when --
L:  And it's not gonna be such a curiosity thing.
R:  Yeah.  It's like when, you know, all the girls in -- that went to catholic school and it was so regimented.  It was like they got to -- 'cause they didn't have a catholic high school, they went all through -- all through grade eight -- they went to high school and everything, all the knowledge was out there to find, and they were, all of the catholic girls were pregnant.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm sitting here, I says, "Didn't -- didn't you learn about this?"  "No, we didn't have sex education classes, we didn't have this".
L:  Right.
R:  "The nuns just told us we shouldn't do this but they -- they said -- they had -- they -- they stopped us kissing".  So these girls weren't kissing anybody but they were doing everything else!
L:  And with the private schools --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- versus the public schools.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Any of the private schools that we have here in our area are christian schools.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And there is no curriculum about sex education.
R:  I think that's a mistake.
L:  I -- I agree.
R:  Because they have to live in the real world, whether it's christian or not.
L:  Right.  And, um, you know, in a christian family --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you wanna teach your child christian values.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But even the best family with the best intentions, their child can be just as curious as a -- a family who doesn't practice religion.
R:  That's true.
L:  You know, doesn't practice family get together type, sit down --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- "Let's have a conversation, do you have questions?  Is there anything I can answer for you?"
R:  Mhm.
L:  It -- it -- I don't think it has anything to do with a -- a public or a private, it's not allowed in any of 'em.
R:  Yeah.  And that's the way I feel, that it -- everything within reason.  I -- I don't think that they should have Hustler on the school shelves.
L:  Right.
R:  I think, I think that's -- I mean, that shouldn't even be
