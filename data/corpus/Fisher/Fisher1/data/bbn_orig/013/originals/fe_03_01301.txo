L:  [NOISE] Hey, I'm Wendy.
R:  Hi, I'm Jennifer.
L:  Hey.  Hobbies.  Do you have hobbies?
R:  I don't have any common hobbies --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that I do on a regular basis, but, um, I have had some in the past and I would like to pick up another hobby, something that my husband and I can do together outside of work.
L:  Same here.  Right.  Same here.
R:  Do you have hobbies?
L:  Um, none that I do consistently.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, other than my kids. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I'm sure that's a hobby in itself. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  We -- we do some boating and fishing and, you know, things like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but, you know, there's not a lot of time for hobbies.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, I used to have -- before I had two kids, when I only just had one or before I had any, I had a lot of time and, you know, I did crafts and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I cooked a lot and -- and I did a lot of things like that.  But, like, yeah, there's just not a lot of time.
R:  Yeah.  Um, we go -- we go fishing sometimes.  We go camping --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- maybe twice a year.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Um, I -- we like to do outdoors type stuff.  You know, it's -- it's the kind of thing where once you have all the equipment you need --
L:  Then it's easy.
R:  It's not too expensive and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you kinda figure out where to go.  But, uh, you know, we'd like to get involved -- I don't have any kids, but we'd like to get involved in something that we can do more on a -- more a spontaneous basis than a camping trip.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I don't know.  Bowling maybe. [LAUGH]
L:  We -- in the -- in the summer, we swim.  I mean, I guess that's a hobby.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, I say we because wherever I go my kids go. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, we swim and we go to the beach and, um, [NOISE] ...
R:  That's neat.  So, you live close enough to the beach to drive, you know, for a day?
L:  Yeah, I'm in Alabama.  I'm in Alabama.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Nice and hot. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Nice and hot.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, you know, every -- all of our hobbies now are -- are -- consist of whatever the kids are doing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, they're not really my hobbies.
R:  Now, do your kids do any kinda extra curricular activities --
L:  Ah --
R:  -- or are they still young?
L:  Uh, well, both.  But they do dance and choir and geography club, things like that with school, so they have hobbies.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but I don't know, I guess I got away from all the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I didn't realize it until now. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Funny --
L:  Did you do -- did you do more -- did you have more hobbies before you were married? [NOISE]
R:  Um, yeah, I'd say I had -- uh, well, up until all the way through school and up through high school I took dance for several years.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And then didn't really have the time for it through college.  And then after that we got married and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we stay pretty tied up with -- with work.
L:  Work.
R:  So, by the time we --
L:  Yeah, I do --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  By -- you know, by the time you get home from work, who has the energy? [NOISE]
R:  Just wanna -- right, just wanna crash on the couch. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I do love to read but again it's -- now it's magazines as opposed to books because a magazine you can pick up and put down, pick up and put down.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] Um, but before I would read, [NOISE] you know, books, just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just to get away.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I used to read quite a few books once upon a time when, like you said, when I had the time to -- to sit down and really get into it.  But now I just got a couple of magazine subscriptions, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Family Circle and Women's Day. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, the normal. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I do a lot on the computer.  I guess that's a hobby.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Um, so ...
R:  I've been getting pretty involved on the internet and, um, I've been doing -- actually been doing a lot of mystery shopping.
L:  That's what I do, too. [LAUGH]
R:  Lately. [LAUGH]
L:  That's funny.
R:  Well, good, something in common. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  But I don't --
L:  But that --
R:  I don't do it a whole lot to account for, like, an extra salary, but I'll do maybe -- you know, maybe one shop a week.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, no, I do -- I -- I was teaching and I was teaching at preschool and I left there to do mystery shopping because I love it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, is that a hobby or is that a job?  For me, I guess it's both.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  I -- I consider it a hobby because it's something fun.  To me it's something fun to do.
L:  Oh, yeah, it is fun.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's a lot of fun.
R:  What kind of places do you do shops at?
L:  [NOISE] Every place.  Restaurants, retail, um, I had my carpets cleaned last week. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's nice. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Um, [LIPSMACK] gas stations, movie rentals.  I try to do things where -- you know, I do grocery stores --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, you know, I'm going there anyway.
R:  Right.
L:  I need groceries anyway.  You know, gas, hey, I'll -- I'll get reimbursed for gas happily.
R:  Right.  I think that's the key.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  As long as it's something that you would normally do and not just a special case, for the most part.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I have started doing, um, some resort shops.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  And we went to Gatlinburg and we went to [inaudible] and we're going to Disney, um, so that's -- that's been a lot of fun.
R:  That's really neat.
L:  That's -- I mean, that's awesome.  You know, you can't take three vacations inside of a year like that --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- when you have to pay for everything yourself.  You just c- -- I mean, nobody can do that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, maybe somebody can, but I can't. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] But, yeah, I guess that is really my -- my hobby.  Um --
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  -- I was a little reluctant to mention mystery shopping 'cause it's so hush hush.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I'm glad you did.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Where are you from?
R:  I am about an hour outside of Chicago.
L:  Brrr.
R:  So, it's -- yeah, it gets cold --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but it actually warmed up this week.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Got outside and cranked up the grill Sunday night for dinner, so ...
L:  That's nice.  See, that's -- I guess that could be a hobby, [LAUGH] grilling.
R:  Yeah, that's my husband's hobby, grilling.  He got his new grill on Friday.  We had one that broke and then he got the new one Friday and we had it going by Sunday, so he's all excited about that.
L:  Well, good.  Do you ever, um, get on volition dot com?
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  You should go there.  That's -- that's the mystery shopping place.  It's volition, V.O.L.I.T.I.O.N.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Dot com.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And there's a chat room and we go in there every night.  So, that's another hobby, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Um --
R:  Is -- does it cost anything to join or ...?
L:  No, not a -- not a dime.
R:  Yeah?  That's good.
L:  Not at all.
R:  The one I -- the one I get pretty involved with is Trend Source.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  I've just got my first shops with Trend Sou- -- Trend Source.
R:  Oh, did you?
L:  Yes, just this week.
R:  Well, that's good.  I -- I -- once I got a little bit more involved, I got more come along, and I just got a whole bunch of phone shops today which works out really well 'cause I have the, um, the unlimited long distance plan.
L:  Right.  That's what I was doing [LAUGH] when the phone rang. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  So, we're doing the same thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's funny. [SIGH] That's funny.  Um, I don't know, I guess there's probably a lot of mystery shoppers that signed up for this -- this program.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's how I found out about it.
R:  Yeah, so did I, through one of those.  I don't how many websites I'm signed up on --
L:  Yeah, one of 'em.
R:  -- probably fifteen, but one of 'em, right.
L:  Yeah, I think it was -- I got mine from money and shopping, I think, from Angela's.  I don't know if you do that one or not?
R:  Um ...
L:  That's one that I've paid for. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, one --
R:  Do you think that's worthwhile, the one that you paid for?
L:  Um, only for the contacts, not really for the jobs.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, you know, I -- you know, I got this through it.  I've gotten a few through it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But --
R:  [NOISE] Hello? [PAUSE]
