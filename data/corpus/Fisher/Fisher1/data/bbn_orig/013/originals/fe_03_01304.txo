L:  [NOISE] My name --
R:  Hello.  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Denise.  How are you?
L:  Okay.  My name is Guillaume Lourdes.
R:  Hello.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, we're supposed to talk about hobbies today.
L:  Okay.
R:  Do you have any hobbies?
L:  Uh, [NOISE] well, that depends on what -- is watching, uh, sports is a hobby or [inaudible] --
R:  Yes, I think -- I think watching sports would be a hobby.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, I think basketball is, uh, probably a hobby of mine.
R:  Do you like to watch, um, these professional teams or college?
L:  Well, usually I watch the professional team because the college, you know, you have to be able to follow them closely, which I don't have a specific time to and especially the time, you know.  They require a specific time, but for the professional at least, you know, you pick one team or two teams then you follow them, which is easier for me to do.  But I like all the basketball, you know.  If I have a chance, I watch any basketball, even if it's high school or ... even if it's high c- -- high school, college or professional.  What a- --
R:  I agree.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I enjoy going to the games, too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Especially baseball, sitting outside when the weather's nice.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yes.  We're getting a new basketball stadium here in town.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  And it -- it's supposed to hold -- it's for the college.  It's supposed to hold, I think, fourteen thousand people.  I can't -- maybe ten thousand, I can't remember, but it looks like it's gonna be gorgeous.
L:  Yeah.  So, maybe you'll --
R:  Except our -- are -- are you familiar with Fresno State?
L:  Which one?  Which state?
R:  Fresno.  It's Fresno State College.
L:  Oh, uh, no.
R:  Um --
L:  Not really, so I assume you live in California, right?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I am in Florida myself, in West Palm Beach.
R:  Oh, so you must be --
L:  So --
R:  -- having nice weather, too, huh?
L:  Well, we have some kind of nice weather, but sometimes it's even too hot and too humid, too.  But, you know ...
R:  Oh, yes, I know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  It's very humid here, but, you know, we like it.  Since I came from a tropical country and Florida is the closest of weather that I can have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and for the other states where I -- you know, when you watch the weather channel, you can see --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- all these, uh -- all these, you know, like, weather, like, you know, the temperature, low temperature, below zeros or, you know, close to zeros and things like that, which I don't exactly like. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know.
L:  [inaudible].  Yeah.  I only --
R:  Yeah, we're lucky.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We're lucky.  We're in the seventies today, so ...
L:  Y- yeah.  Well, we are in the eighties, which is, you know, kind of very good for us because we were, like, in the nineties a couple of weeks ago.  That's all there was, but --
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  But now we're in the seventies, which is good.
R:  Yes.  We'll be up in the hundreds before soon because we're in the central part of California.
L:  Oh, mhm.
R:  And we get as high as, like, well, one summer when my son was playing baseball, it was a hundred and seventeen for, like, three days in a row.
L:  Well, that should be dangerous, huh?
R:  Yes.
L:  Especially the heat exhaustion and things like that.  Did he, um -- did he --
R:  Yeah.  We made sure they got lots of water and got to rest.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Even at -- at the last game, they didn't even wanna play any more.  They just kinda stood in the outfield and when a ball came it was like, "You get it".  "No, you get it".  "No, you get it".
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Is Fresno close to LA?
R:  Um, Fresno's about three hours north of LA and it's about two and a half hours to the east of San Francisco.
L:  Oh, yeah.  So, yeah, you're --
R:  So --
L:  -- really in the central then.  I -- I --
R:  But we're kinda lucky because we've got a lot of farming[?] around us, so we get a lot of the melons and the tree fruits like peaches and plums.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  The strawberries are growing real well right now.
L:  Yeah, we --
R:  So, we always have fresh fruit.
L:  We had some good farms [inaudible], too, where we have peppers, you know, cucumbers and, uh, tomatoes and, you know, several kind of crops that we really enjoy.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Anyway, uh, about, um, uh -- talking about the hobbies, like, you know, my wife, by the way, kind of, we like Los -- LA, Los Angeles, uh, basketball, the Lakers.
R:  Oh, the Lakers, yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, she -- she follows them closely, which is, uh -- they have [inaudible] disappointing, uh, season so far, but hopefully they can make it to the playoffs and, uh, try to get back to the form they were before.
R:  What do you think of their hairstyles?
L:  Their hairstyle?
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh --
R:  And all their tattoos? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well, [LAUGH] you know, especially let me tell you one thing.  When you have enough money and you get bored, you have to do something.  Uh, you know, you have to do something, uh, dramatic, you know.  What they call?
R:  Yes.
L:   So you can be -- probably sometimes I -- you know, like, if you have money, like yourself, you would say, like, if you're a regular person, "If I have money, I'll do this, I'll do that".
R:  Mhm.
L:  But them, they already have all their money they want and yet they still continue receive free things and, you know, they can travel any place they want.  So that's when there is nothing left, just to do something, you know --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- dramatic.  Like, maybe if you would have money you would have traveled.  And traveling, it's another hobby that if I can do, I wouldn't be -- I would be never tired of it, so ...
R:  Oh, I agree.
L:  [MN]
R:  I just got back from a trip to Russia --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about, oh, fourteen months ago, and it was absolutely fantastic.
L:  Oh, you did -- mhm.
R:  We were -- we were in Siberia.
L:  Oh, you did?
R:  And -- yes.
L:  Oh, so maybe you are comfortable then, if you can travel [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, I do it --
L:  -- outside the country.
R:  Have you heard of Rotary International?
L:  Uh, yes, I heard of -- I heard of it, yeah, mhm.
R:  Yes.  Well, I traveled for Rotary, so --
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  Yeah.  It's, um, it's fun. [LAUGH] I enjoy it.
L:  Oh, that's very good, yeah.
R:  We do special projects over there and, you know, we've got a -- a sister club in Palotka[?].
L:  Well.
R:  So, what we did was we made sure that, um, we had a little bit of money for them, but we wanted to make sure they knew how to do things on their own.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, we weren't just giving them money, we were helping them --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to improve their lifestyle.
L:  And that would be something, you know, I would like to -- like, especially, you know, my country.  Originally, you know, I am from Haiti myself, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, there are a lot of, you know, so many problems we have in our country, and when I see, like, things, you know, that people are throwing food away and all these little things, you know, you wish you could get -- you know, can close your eye and snap your fingers, then all these things can be over there.
R:  Yes.
L:  So people can use it and that's where I kind of -- that's -- that's why I like to travel and see what is the difference between, like, you know, several places.  And I don't know too many countries, but here in the United States I've been going to a few states, and I like -- not only I like traveling, but I like driving to travel, you know.
R:  Yeah, so do I.  I don't really like flying, but I just --
L:  No.
R:  -- love to get in my car --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and just go.
L:  Yeah, you go in no destination or anything, you know --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- where -- wherever you get and you tired then you stop there.
R:  Yes.
L:  Which is a very -- which is a very good way to do it because in that case not only you go where you wanna go, but you see a -- a lot of other things, too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that you wouldn't probably -- like, you know, there are little towns, small towns, that you go to and you see, like, the difference, you know, the way they live and you wonder, you know, would I be able to live like that, a small town like this or a big town, you know, like this so and so?  So, you --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you -- you kind of compare and see which town is cleaner than the others, you know, [LAUGH] things like that.
R:  Yes, and you say, "Oh, gosh, I wonder if I could live on a farm or ...?" [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, if I --
R:  I know -- I wonder if I could live, yeah.
L:  Well, I -- I -- so, I already know I can't live on a farm --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because I've been in [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I don't like it especially when it's raining.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, and the dirt's gotta become the mud and things like that.  I kind of -- I don't like that very much, so I already know, I tried it before, which I know I won't be able to.  But I -- I like small town for the quietness, but then again, you know, I don't like it too small either, you know.  You want all the stores around, even though you're not -- you're not gonna use them --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but you like them around in case when you need them you don't have to travel, you know, too many miles away to go to -- to buy a gallon of milk, you know, things like that.  But ...
R:  Right.  And Fresno's small enough that you can drive down the street or you can go to a restaurant and you'll always run into people you know.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's --
R:  And that's nice.
L:  Yeah.  We -- this is -- California is one of the states that are on our agenda, like, my wife and I, for us to visit sometime.  But since it's so big and we kind of had ideas of so many big, you know, cities they have --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- I -- I think, you know, when we go there we should be able to have, like, a couple of days, you know, to go around.  And we don't know how far away the cities are from each other, but at least we know it's a very large state.
