R:  I guess there could be measures taken if something, you know, had pornography in it or such but there have been a lot of classes -- classics that people have tried to ban from schools in the past and even today, in certain sections of the country, that really have nothing wrong with them.  I don't know if anyone is here or not, speaking with anyone, um, if you could pick up or say something, I'd appreciate it.
L:  Hello, call partner.  Can you hear me? 
R:  Yes, hi, did -- could you hear me earlier?
L:  Ah, I could just hear you on this last -- on this last pitch.
R:  Okay.  Um, my name is Sue, yours?
L:  My name is Tom, Sue, it's nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you too and speak with you.  What is your opinion on the, ah, the book banning?  
L:  On the book banning, I believe that -- I -- I -- I -- I believe that it's a good thing.  I believe the schools -- sometimes we force our schools sometimes to act in loco parentis for the parents and not everything needs to be exposed to the individual at -- at one time.  You get -- you show a little -- you show a little knowledge in some areas, you whet that knowledge and you continue to -- if you plant the seeds of knowledge in one area, it will grow there and from those seeds will sprout other ideas in other areas.
R:  Okay, but -- so you feel that it --  it is okay to ban books from the school systems?
L:  I believe if the -- if the parents won't do it, the school -- somebody has to do it.
R:  Okay, the thing is though, I -- I could see pornographic material, but in the past there have been sections of the country, even Harry Potter books that people think for some reason are evil and are actually innocent, ah, books that, ah, people want to ban them and they've been a lot of classics that have been banned because for some reason people were against them for outlandish reasons and they ended up being classics and on the best seller lists and -- and people could learn from them.
L:  [MN]
R:  So I myself feel that unless it's proven to be pornographic material which we wouldn't any child to be exposed to, I don't think any --  any book should really be -- other than that should be outlawed.
L:  I'll throw a couple of curves your way.
R:  Okay.
L:  The Anarchist's Cook Book for one, books which were written by, say, Abbey Hoffman and Jerry Rubin in the seventies.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Soul on Ice by Eldridge Cleaver.
R:  Right.
L:  There is no -- there is no reason why in my mind why a school would want to use these in a school by definitions of school meaning, ah, grammar, middle, to even -- I would say sophomore in high school to use any of these books.  However, if people wish to read them on their own, they're more than -- more -- more than free to do so.  Do you see where I'm coming from? 
R:  Um, I could see your point in a way but if they had a school library maybe they weren't near a public library, um, I don't know, I mean, maybe they wouldn't have any other chance to get the books.  I haven't read them, I kinda know what their philosophy is and I don't think that if someone reads a book about a certain topic, that that would, ah, change that person into an anarchist.  Just like I don't think if you re- read a book about a drug addict you're going to become a drug addict or a murderer.  I -- I don't believe that just like if I were to see a film on such, I wouldn't be influenced by that to go out and murder someone.
L:  Yes, but do we have to make it mandated that people, young people should have to be exposed to this at an --  at an early age?
R:  How about high school?
L:  Again, I will use the reference of past the sophomore year.
R:  I think, um, usually you're fifteen in sophomore year, that by that point you're -- you should be mature enough and indi- individual to be able to think for yourself and make your own decisions.
L:  Oh, dear lady, I don't know what neighbourhood you live in or where you -- what your background is, but I most heartily disagree.  I have met fifteen year olds, I have met twenty year olds who can't walk and chew gum at the same time.  Maturity isn't defined by a number, maturity is defined by the person themselves.
R:  Sure.  I mean, there's people out there that are fifty, forty, twenty one that are immature and there are some fifteen year olds that are mature as well.  And they are still children under eighteen, they are still children, and as I said before, I wouldn't want to expose them to any pornographic material but I don't think that banning books, like, who's going to make the decision to ban the books?
L:  The parent, that's why we have parents.
R:  So the Harry Potter books could be banned because the parents think that it's a witchcraft book?
L:  Well, eventually -- eventually if someone wishes to read a book long enough, they'll find a way to read a book.  I can only use my experience as a point of reference in this.  I came from a background which although -- although I was a hippie way back -- way back in the day --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  If you'll excuse the expression, that my parents weren't happy when I brought home Jerry Rubin's or Abbey Hoffman's Do It or Eldridge -- or that I wanted to read Eldridge Cleaver Soul on Ice.
R:  Did you read them?
L:  Yes, I did.
R:  And your parents allowed it?
L:  They -- they weren't happy but it was with my money with which I bought these books.
R:  Okay, so you were over eighteen then or -- 
L:  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, I was -- oh, gosh I wish I had a point of reference.  I'll give you a point of reference for my age, I'm forty eight right now.
R:  Okay.
L:  Ah, I read them during my high school -- during my high school year I guess about --
R:  So it's about thirty two years ago.
L:  -- I guess about sophomore, sophomore so as when I turned into a hippie for lack of a better term.
R:  Well, I guess like a rebel for the time.
L:  It's -- I -- I'm ancient, what can I say?
R:  Ah, I wouldn't say that.  It's a number but I'd say every teenage year has a rebellious -- whatever age they grow up, there's some way to rebel.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Like in the past kids had -- the guys had long hair and now they're shaved heads or some kids have dreadlocks or whatever.
L:  [MN]
R:  Anything to be different, piercings, tattoo.
L:  [PAUSE] I wonder how we are doing with this so far.  [PAUSE] Well, let's see, where else can we go on this?  Censorship, I guess we're done.  [PAUSE] Are you still there?  [PAUSE] Hello.  Are you still there?  [PAUSE] Can somebody he- can somebody hear me on this end?  [PAUSE] Can somebody hear me?  Hello? [PAUSE] hello caller.  I'm on -- I'm trying this Fisher linguistic study course, are you into -- are you into that too?  [PAUSE] I'll wait -- I'll wait fifteen more seconds.  If I don't hear an answer from somebody, I'll assume that this call is over.  [PAUSE] I gather it's about ten minutes so I assume this call is over.  If you're monitoring it, have a good --
