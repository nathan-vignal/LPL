R:  Hi, my name's Jane.
L:  Hi, this is Jim.
R:  Hey, Jim.
L:  How you doing?
R:  Pretty good, how are you?
L:  Not too bad.
R:  So, are you into this health and fitness stuff?
L:  Oh, no.
R:  Me either.  I'm a couch potato.
L:  Yeah, well I'm not a couch potato I just -- I like to labor, do labor for work so if I don't get my exercise at work then I usually don't exercise.
R:  Yeah, me either.
L:  I like to walk.
R:  Me too.  That's my favorite thing, just walking.  That's good 'cause you can go anywhere, anytime pretty much.  Don't need to buy a bunch of stuff.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  My chasing my little kids around but that's about all --
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  -- the exercise I get.
L:  Then you don't need to exercise.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, they run me ragged.
L:  Yeah, that'll be enough.
R:  [LAUGH] But, yeah, I'd like to do more.  I'd like to get into something, some kind of routine or yoga or swimming or tennis, I just never seem to find the time.
L:  Oh, no.  I exercised in the army because we had to.  
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But I enjoyed it.  I mean I did -- that was on of the things that I missed once we got out --
R:  I beat.
L:  -- because it was a regular thing and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- had to do it same time every day and --
R:  Uh-huh, keep you fit.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah.  But then I'm one of them people I can eat anything and I never gain weight.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Or --
R:  Must be nice.  I don't know.
L:   -- never gained much weight so, yeah, I really don't have a need to exercise.
R:  That's great.  If I ate --
L:  If I do then I have to eat three times as much and I already eat too much.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well same here --
L:  Or I feel like --
R:  -- if I ate like a normal person I'd probably be really skinny but I -- I eat tons of food.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I eat more than my husband [LAUGH] I'm a piglet.  
L:  Well, I do -- the better it is the more I eat so ...
R:  [LAUGH] and I don't even cook.  I'm constantly going to restaurants.  I, uh, spend breakfast, lunch, and dinner at restaurants it seems like.  Anything to avoid cooking [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, uh, yeah it's important to get healthy, stay healthy. Oh, I've got a kid sitting here nursing.  That's another reason I kinda eat a whole lot more because you burn about five hundred more calories every day by nursing babies so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's what I'm doing at the moment.  I didn't even know I still in on these phone survey things but, uh, I tried to get --
L:  Yeah, I thought maybe that after the first one that that was going to be it.
R:  Yeah, I thought I was only --
L:  It's been probably three weeks.
R:  Yeah, that's what I thought I was only signed up for that first week but I just happened to be home tonight thank goodness.  Someone tried to do it an hour or two ago but the other person couldn't hear me after the introduction and it was a different topic.
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] but I tried to leave 'em a comment at the end. I was like, "Yeah, try me again".  This is pretty neat.  So, where do you live?
L:  Arkansas.
R:  Oh, really.  I'm in North Carolina.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, it's a little warm here.  We're like turning on the air conditioning practically today. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's what it's been like here too.
R:  [LAUGH] I like it because I'm originally from Southern California so I like warm weather.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know, uh, maybe if they had free gyms or something.
R:  What was that?
L:  I said maybe if they had free gyms or something.
R:  Oh, right, I know.
L:  I'd get into it regular.
R:  Yeah.  I want to join the Y 'cause --
L:  Into a regular routine but I'm not going to pay for someone to exercise.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I mean that just --
R:  Mhm that's another reason I love walking 'cause, I mean, not only --
L:  Uh-huh, it's free. I can walk anywhere I want --
R:  -- no equipment but, right, yeah.
L:  -- any time I want.
R:  Exactly.  I love it, yeah.  That is one thing I like to do.  Walking.  You can, uh --
L:  Then, I guess, push ups and sit ups are free to and I won't do those either.
R:  That's true, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] that's too much like work and I'm not getting paid for it so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'd rather relax [LAUGH].
R:  I know what you mean.  [LAUGH] Mhm.  Yeah, I'd like to win a free membership to a gym then I'd go but, yeah, it's so expensive otherwise [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.  No, like I say, I usually always do some kind of labor for work so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I usually get plenty of exercise at work.
R:  Yeah, I used to -- I used to work at US Airways out on the ramp loading bags on the plane and everything and that was pretty strenuous for me.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And stuff like that but not any more [LAUGH] just chasing the kids.
L:  Yeah, when I was running a battery warehouse I used to get calls constantly from the gym people, "Do you want to join our gym"?  "Bud, look at your call list, see who you're calling here.  I work in a battery warehouse, everything I pick up is forty pounds or less, or more, I mean". 
R:  Yeah, right, yeah.
L:  So, I don't need any exercise.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, oh wow, now all of a sudden my phone's doing funny things.  Can you still hear me?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh, okay I thought my phone just got real quiet.  Hm.  Oh gosh, yeah right now my, uh, husband and his cousin -- and they moving a bunch of furniture downstairs because we're getting new carpet tomorrow and I'm like I should be helping 'em move furniture but as I've got the little baby here I can't really help out but I'm probably a weakling compared to all them since I don't really normally lift much any more, besides the kids [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, heck no.  You just doing kids is enough exercise, I think.
R:  That's true, they're heavy.
L:  If they don't wear you out physically, they're wear you out mentally [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah both.  They're all of the above.  [LAUGH] Yeah, they're little tornadoes.  Sleep for a few hours and recharge their batteries and then wear you out again.
L:  Uh-huh.
R: [LAUGH]  Hm.
L:  No, I don't know anybody that exercises actually.
R:  Yeah, I don't kno-
L:  Or anybody that goes to a gym.
R:  [LAUGH] My brother used to do nordic track a lot.  He's an airline pilot and so he was always sitting, you know, in the cockpit and so he's -- he's pretty active.  He's snowboarding or rollerblading or always doing something but I don't know drinks a lot of beer too [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm, well.
R:  He's on the Atkins Diet.
L:  Yeah, you have to, yeah if you sit and drink beer. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That'll put the weight on.
R:  Doesn't do it when he's flying though [LAUGH].
L:  No. 
R:  Of course not, not one of those scandalous, uh, [LAUGH] crazy pilots.
L:  No.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah but no his wife's totally active though, my sister in law she's always doing tennis and aerobics and everything else and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it shows.   She's in great shape for forty something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm forty three so ...
R:  I'm thirty seven but I feel a lot older sometimes [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.  I have been lately we've been laying sod out at the golf course so ...
R:  Very good.  That'd burn off some calories.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh yeah, like I say burn 'em so easy that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I can spend three months gaining ten or fifteen pounds and I can lose it in a week.
R:  Wow!  I want that kind of metabolism but, I think --
L:  Uh-huh, everybody does [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Hopefully you'll keep it that way forever [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  But still, even for people that are just naturally thin like that that exercise is supposed to be real important.  I've read that you should still do it.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah I do I notice the difference.
R:  Mm.
L:  Or if I get a job where I'm not exercising as much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I just -- I don't feel as good.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Get tired easier and --
R:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]
L:  Maybe it's just the years catching up with me [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Little bit.  [LAUGH] Hm, ah, it's just too easy these days with all the technology it's like you don't have to work like --
L:  Oh, I know you don't have to do anything.
R:  -- you did a long time ago.  Yeah, don't have to go out and grow your food or anything [LAUGH].
L:  No.
R:  Yeah, it makes us all kind of lazy sometimes, some of us.  Makes me at least.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, Arkansas, so is it only like -- what, that's where you are, right?  Arkansas?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is it -- are you on central nine thirtyish or ...?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, that's what I thought.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. [MN] Mm, mm.  Yeah, I don't even know what kind of exercises I even like to do [LAUGH] trying to think.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I used to like to water ski but I'm too blind.  I'd be out there without my contacts or glasses and I could barely see the boat [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, uh-huh.  I used to like to ski when we were in Colorado but it's just too pricey.
R:  If you -- yeah, I don't like the cold that much.  I did snuck in like twice downhill and cross country a couple of times and I was always like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- all right, where's the beach?  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I like to swim.
R:  Mm, me to.
L:  But I can't do chlorine in the water.  They always put too much chlorine in the water at pools now.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Just bugs me too bad.
R:  [LAUGH] You gotta get your own pool or something.  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.  Or maybe down here the lakes are warmer.
R:  Oh.
L:  In Colorado the water never got warm enough [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Stay out of the water in Colorado. 
R:  [LAUGH] I don't think I've even been there.  I saw it, I drove thought when I was a kid or something but it sounds like a pretty place.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Big state [LAUGH].  Hm. [NOISE] Trying to move -- move down further south in North Carolina here, near the border and so the weather'll be a little bit nicer but I'm always wanting to move south or back west again just to get away from snow and ice storms in the winter.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, the year before we move down here -- we were going to move down here to get away from the storms and ice and they had like the worst ice storm in the last seventy years or something [LAUGH].
R:  Wow, in Colorado?
L:  No, down here.
R:  Oh, down there, oh okay, wow.
L:  Yeah, we were going to move down here that year and then waited one more year and then that year -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they had the worst ice storm.
R:  Just seems like it'd be easier --
L:  Maybe we're not going to get completely away from it.
R:  Yeah.  The weather's craz-
L:  This year's pretty good.  We had five or six days where it snowed --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and they get two or three inches and they close things down.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah that's -- that's the way it is here in North Carolina.  It's hysterical 'cause they don't have any equipment for it and -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, they think it's all, you know, a big emergency and --
L:  Unless we get two feet you're going to work.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, yeah.  I got a friend out Fort Collins, Colorado, who said just a couple of weeks ago, fairly recently --
L:  Oh yeah they got --
R:  -- they had like two or three feet.
L:  Yeah, they got slammed up there a couple of weeks ago.
R:  It's crazy, yeah.  [LAUGH]
