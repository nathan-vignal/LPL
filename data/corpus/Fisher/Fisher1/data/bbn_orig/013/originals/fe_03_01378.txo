R:  Hello, my name is Toulin[?] Gaskins[?].
L:  Hi.  I'm Maria Conzi[?].
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you too.
R:  [LAUGH] I --
L:  They called me earlier and nobody else was on the other line. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So I hung up, but, uh, I don't [MN] -- how old are your children? 
R:  Um, actually I don't have any children.
L:  Oh, you don't.
R:  Mhm.  I'm a -- I'm a single person.  Um, I'm twenty one.  I'll be twenty two in July. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  But, um, I -- I actually went, ah, and graduated from a private school, um, Christian private school.
L:  Ahah.
R:  Um, -- my feelings on -- on the subject is I think that, um, -- and I -- I have attended public schools before.  Most of my school career was public school.  Um, I feel that the public schools do have the right to censor, um, what books students read -- um, for the simple fact that whatever a person -- it has been proven, um, by studies and even, um, I think you can relate to this, too, even from your own personal experiences, that what you read can influence the way you think and the things that you do.
L:  Yeah.  I totally agree with that.  I have, um, a daughter that's at high school now -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and, um, there's a lot of -- the books that she's reading that I ended up reading, uh, back when I was in high school and that -- I've one that's out of high school, but, yeah, you're right, even so- -- a lot of the magazines it's nothing but trash -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, but unfortunately, you know, those are being sold at the, you know, at the check out stands, so those can't really be censored unless a parent gets hold of them and flips through them and checks them first.
R:  [COUGH] Right.
L:  But as far as the, you know, the books that are going through the school in a certain -- [MN] certain reading material, um, depends -- I guess it really depends on the subject, like they had a -- my daughter, um, she just finished doing a -- a mythology class -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so she was reading a mythology book and it was -- I mean you -- you had to do, you know, three fours of the book and then one part, um, one fourth dictionary just to know what they were talking about -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, but, um, [MN] y- you know, the -- it- it's basically in -- in the English classes where, um, a lot of the teachers, you know, just like throwing books in there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I remember reading Romeo and Juliet -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, what was the other one?  Um, my daughter's now reading To Kill a Mocking Bird --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- you know.  They're really great, they're showing you different ways of establishing the English language -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, but, um, other than that, you know, ah, i- -- ah, it's -- it's really hard, I -- I know it is hard because you ha- -- for the teachers, especially for the schools, you know, to pick a book that would grab everybody -- you know, people's attention -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I know, like, [MN] even Romeo and Juliet, you read the book, you don't really understand the book, you watch the movie at school -- 
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know.  Um, [MN] it -- it now happened -- nowadays, I mean you get a tea- -- you get a child to read a book, you're lucky it hasn't been shown on video.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, but, um, -- 
R:  That was a part of my experience, too, [COUGH] studying language, arts and English.  When we read Shakespeare in high school, I understood a little bit of what, um, was being said.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it, ah, it didn't really come together until, like you said, they showed the movie -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in class, and, um, I think too that, um, you know, kids -- I mean -- and, you know, children in public school, they come from all different types of backgrounds. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And some parents, you know, they are really interested in what their kids are learning and will sit down and explain to them what it is that they're reading and that other parents, they're just not there for them -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or even, you know, the student may not even have parents.  They might be, you know, adopted or foster children -- 
L:   Mhm.
R:  -- of someone, and, um, you know, we -- I -- I think because of, um, the fact that I, you know, not too long ago graduated from high school and it was kind of embarrassing having to read certain types of, ah, reading material that the teacher picked out that was very explicit and, uh, I would go home and I would tell, you know, my folks.  I --  I would be like, you know, "They have us reading this stuff in class" and, ah, and it wasn't the classics, I mean it was stuff that dealt with sex and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- things like that and, um, -- and I think there was just some things that are unappropriate.
L:  Well, see, more so now.  Th- those type of -- i- it's getting I think within the last couple of years, most of that, those books, unless it's a higher grade level are not to be read -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, um, but they're -- they're trying to [inaudible] they're trying to stay away from now, uh, violence. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  But, you know what?  -- an- and it's really strange.  You can't stay away from violence because, like we said, Romeo and Juliet -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's violence in that book.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and it -- it seems like there's violence, there's sex in -- in all the books and, see, when I was growing up, because I come from a -- a service background, um, [MN] half the time I was in public school, the other half I was in private school -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, in -- but in private school, um, I was dealing with a lot more, of, ah, religious materials -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- opposed to, you know, um, there's a log- -- there's a logical, you know, um, books and stuff like that, like, you know, we weren't in -- in private school we weren't allowed to read To Kill a Mocking Bird.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and -- and, uh, public school is yes, um, but it -- it's really hard, you know, um, to say, because I know, you know, the curriculum nowadays is a lot -- is getting to be a lot more strict -- 
R:  Right, and --
L:  -- ah, but they're trying to stay away from the violence -- 
R:  Mhm -- 
L:  -- you know. 
R:  -- and people's standards are different, too.  Um, -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's just like, you know, some -- some families will allow their kids to listen to, you know, violent sounding music for example -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, whereas, you know, other families, you know, they stay away from that completely.
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, you know, it's a lot of -- a lot of issues to look at.  Um, I think when it comes to reading materials, um, in the public school system I think there should be a whole lot more parent teacher, um, communication in regards to things like that, um, --
L:  Ye- yeah.  As far as parent teachers, uh, you know, the- them talking, it's a lot easier to do that -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- when your child is at elementary school -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and junior high, but when you get into the high schools, um, I mean you can talk to the teachers and all that, but as far as really completing as far as the curriculum goes -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's a lot harder -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  -- um, because they've got a lot more to deal with because they're dealing with, um, -- they're getting ki- kids prepped for college -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and if you read a certain book, then what they're gearing towards is if you are reading this book now and if you go to college, more than likely you'll end up reading it again.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, but to me if you're gonna -- if you're gonna read a book and you want, you know, to get the point across, the book needs to at least have some kind of, ah, [LIPSMACK] oh, I don't know, um, enthusiasm in it -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- you know.  Otherwise you can have a child, you know, sit there reading maybe one page a night and falling asleep -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, um, -- but, yeah, like the classics, Romeo and Juliet and the mythology book that she had to read, too, I mean some of the English language in that, it was really hard -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know.  It was -- and, um, -- well, the English language to begin with is hard anyways -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, but, uh, you know, it is, um, -- I feel that, you know, it's a lot easier if they would ask for our opinions on what books through the -- throughout the year -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, um, instead of just, "Here, you're reading this book this semester".
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and you don't have any say so in it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  By that point, you know, all the t- -- other students in, you know, in the whole school district have, uh, you know, on the same curriculum, you know, and so you don't have a way of censoring anything -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and unless a parent -- and some parents, unfortunately, some parents have not read some of the books that the students are reading -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- so they have no way of censoring it unless they read it afterwards, you know, and I feel that if they're going to have a student read a book, at least ask the parent, "Well, have you read this book?  If not, you know, um, you could get a copy here so you could read it along with your student so you can understand" --
