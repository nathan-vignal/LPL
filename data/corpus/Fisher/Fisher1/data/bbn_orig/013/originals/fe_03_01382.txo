R:  This is Janet.
L:  Hi, this is Sharon.
R:  Hi, Sharon.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good.  This is strange, uh, this is the second call this evening I'm doing!  [LAUGH]
L:  I know, me too, it's very weird.
R:  Is that right?  And it's the same topic?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh well, that's fine, this'll be the third call, so then I'll get a check too!  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's good!
R:  I guess so.  Well --
L:  Uh, s- so what do you think?
R:  Well, I think, um, that the schools need to be real careful, uh, what they let the kids, uh, read.  Uh, my daughter, when she was in about third grade, [LIPSMACK] was reading a book, it seemed harm- harmless enough until I started reading it, about a dog who lived on a farm who killed a chicken or something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But the words in the book were, uh, they were words like, uh, "Murder, bloody murder" which the dog would say, and "Blood everywhere" and -- and talking about killing.  Now, it's all fic- you know, fictitional characters but still, to a young child, that can leave an impact and even g- give 'em nightmares.
L:  Right.
R:  And I tried to get that book removed from the school and nobody listens, you know, and -- and, uh, I mean, the kids -- a lot of kids, uh, go home to -- to no parents there, these days.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  Well, that's the last thing they need to be reading is murder and killing, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  There's a lot of other things they can read, like how a little kid helped a poor man or something, you know.
L:  Sure.
R:  Mhm.
L:  No, I know.  You know, it's just so funny because it's such a fine line, I -- I think, like I don't believe in censorship.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I believe that people can do and believe and r- read what they want to.  But, is it really ce- but I don't think it's really censorship if it's like something like in your instance.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, I feel that you have a right as a parent to stop this, you know, your child from reading this book.
R:  Right.  But -- but my complaining and trying to get it off the shelves, had I succeeded, would that have been censorship?
L:  Only -- h- h- hold on a minute!  Russ, get the door, I think they're here!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, go ahead.
R:  Would -- would -- if -- if I had succeeded on getting the book off the shelves, would that have been considered censorship, you know?
L:  [SIGH]  Well, I -- I don't really consider that censorship, I -- I -- I consider that like, a concerned parent!  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  But I like it -- if -- if -- if like, I feel like it's the mayor, or the town or the government of a town has -- you know, has a list of books that the kids can't read --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for political reasons or, you know, like w- the last person I was talking to, we were talking about like, Huck Finn.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, Huck Finn, to me, I mean, I don't think a child should read it, but a high school student can.
R:  Right.
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.  Because, at that age, when they're younger they're a little more, uh, it's easier to influence their minds, you know?
L:  [SIGH]  Yes.
R:  But, uh, when they're older they can make their own decisions.
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh, but, you know, for instance, teachers could lose their jobs over letting students read certain types of literature.
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, that's kind of a touchy subject there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Right.  No, I -- I -- I -- I've -- no, no, no, I know it's -- it's -- it's -- it's a very sticky situation 'cause like, if you really think about what censorship is, like, in all the -- I think it has a lot of different definitions.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  You --
R:  And -- that's right.  And who decides it?
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's my whole thing.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, uh, that -- that's like, it's a very weird thing to me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  To say that.  And, you know, and part of the other question that we gotta talk about was like, private or public schools.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Well, I don't know how different it is.  I sent my daughter to, um, [LIPSMACK] a private school for a few years and she goes to public school for the first time this year.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, I didn't, uh, I don't think I saw any difference, really, in the two, censoring anything.
L:  Do you think that -- d- do you feel like private -- you don't feel like the private school can censor more than a public school or vice versa?
R:  You know what, I bet they could.  I'll bet they could.  Uh, I just don't believe that I saw it done.  In fact, you know, my experiences with private school, uh, were wonderful, um, you know, when I -- if I had a problem, if there was way too much homework or whatnot, it was taken care of immediately, whereas the public schools always blew off my concerns as if --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- it didn't matter, you know.
L:  That's interesting.
R:  Yeah.  It -- it was.  It was, uh, no, her private school was -- was very small, she had in her class, you know, there was one, um, grader -- one class for each grade level.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So it was very a small school, which may have made a difference as well.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I don't know.
L:  Right.  You know, y- you just don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, I don't know, my kids go to a public school.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, I think, you know, from what they've read, it's been okay.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I can tell you like, in third grade my daughter read Roald Dahl books, like -- that's like, Matilda and the -- Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And he's kind of very odd and -- and h- a lot of his books are very anti adults and [LAUGH] very anti parents.
R:  Mhm.  Now which -- and which was that?
L:  Road Dahl.  So like, Matilda.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Do you know -- they also have a video of Matilda.
R:  Yeah, I think my daughter has that book actually.
L:  Yes.  And it's -- 'cause [MN] they had The Twits and J- James and the Giant Peach.  And it's just very interesting because, um, reading that in third grade, I mean, the kids think it's all in fun --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it's like, as an adult reading the book, they really make parents and adults be -- out to be horrible!  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh really?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I think maybe I'd better read that!
L:  Yeah!  I mean, it -- it's just funny because you don't -- like, I wouldn't censor them from reading it because it made them wanna read it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like -- like, that's ch- the k- it made the kids wanna read more and more of these books.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So how can you stop them?
R:  I know.
L:  So, to censor because they're against adults or against parents is really kinda hard to me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because it's encouraging them to read.
R:  Right, right, that's right.
L:  So, you know, it's -- I -- I find it very interesting, like, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  Um, well, you know, like the -- the other lady I was talking to was talking about, for instance, National Geographic.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't think I really want my daughter seeing that, you know, I remember the first time I saw it, you know!  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And I was in shock.  And -- and of course, um, our sex education and health class, I wanna make sure -- they'd -- they'd better ask me for my permission before they teach that to her, you know?
L:  Right, but do you --
R:  Uh --
L:  Right, but do you feel they should?  I mean, would you want someone in -- telling you that you c- they can't?
R:  Um, that they can't --
L:  Teach it.
R:  -- teach it?  Uh, no, I think the parents should be given the choice if they want someone to teach it or if -- or if we should teach it to them.
L:  R- right.
R:  And if -- for instance I don't want her to learn it in school from her -- her grouchy old, you know, ninety year old health teacher who doesn't really care that much.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, she'll be put in another classroom for that time.
L:  Right.
R:  And like I said, right now she's learning about, um, anorexia and bulimia, which I wish I would've been -- to me that's almost teaching them how to do certain things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, it's -- kinda worries them.
L:  Oh --
R:  Uh, they -- there are certain things I think they should ask us if -- if we want our kids to learn that from someone else.
L:  R- right.  And th- they don't do that?
R:  No.  And I think --
L:  Right.  I -- I -- I think like there was t- I think like, guidelines should be sent home to the parents, I agree.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, they --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- they send them home if you're gonna let your kid go on the internet, you know, you have to have permission to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to let them go on the internet at school, but then other things are just assumed it's okay, when sometimes it may not be, you know.
L:  Right.  Like I -- I f- but, see, but I don't call that censorship.
R:  Right.
L:  Do you call that censorship?
R:  No, I don't.  Uh --
L:  I -- I -- I'd -- I'd call that a concerned parent!
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I don't call it censorship.  Uh, I mean, if -- if the school was, uh, refusing to teach it, that would be censors- censorship, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  Um --
L:  Right.  Or if someone else said, "They can't learn this".  Ye-
R:  Right.
L:  Y- y- yes.  But I th- I think a lot of it's up to the parents.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think, you know, I think you're right, I think, you know, if this subject was being taught in school you should've -- you should be made aware of it first.
R:  Mhm, right.
L:  And to see what the curriculum is.
R:  Definitely.
L:  Like, I know in our school in the fourth and fifth grade they teach, you know, uh, fourth grade is puberty.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  And they send home, um, guidelines of what they're gonna teach and then they have a meeting before with the parents --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- to discuss what they're gonna teach.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then you have the option, before and after, whether you want your kid to learn it in school.
R:  Oh.  That's interesting.
L:  And I think that's a good thing.
R:  I do too.
L:  I think that's a really good thing.
R:  Right.
L:  Because it's getting the parents involved and it's giving a parent t- the right to say yes or no.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I don't think that's censorship.
R:  No.  No.  Uh, I mean, you know, if -- if they -- but almost in a way like, all of this war thing and everything could also, in a way, be censorship.  I mean, we're only -- we're only really getting a certain view of what's going on, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  We're not getting the view from -- from some of the other, uh, TV stations or whatever, uh, we're only getting a view of what our government wants us to see.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, in a way, that could be censorship.
L:  Oh yeah, absolutely.
R:  You know.
L:  Yes.
R:  Because I -- I go on this -- the Arab news website, which is an English Arab, uh, En- English Arab newspaper on the internet --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's really interesting, to see their views.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  I mean, and they let the American people or people from all over the other, uh, all over the world speak their minds
