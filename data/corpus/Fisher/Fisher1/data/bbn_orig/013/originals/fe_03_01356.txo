R:  Hi?
L:  Oh, hi!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, I’m Jim from Austin.
R:  I’m Lisa from Michigan, how are you?
L:  Oh, cool.  Just fine.  How’s the weather?
R:  You know what, it was so nice all weekend, in the eighties and everything, and now it’s just cold and windy.  [LAUGH]
L:  I’ve heard that things have been jumping around.  You know, it’s been doing that in Texas, which is silly.
R:  Ha- really?
L:  Yeah, it -- it’s crazy.  One day it, uh, I -- I suppose it’s gotten hot for the -- for the rest of the summer now but it -- it, uh, it has been doing that nice and then cold.
R:  Up and then down.
L:  Yeah, for some reason.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  So, the topic was, uh, uh, do you wanna --
R:  The public or -- should public or private schools be able to force their students to read a -- a certain book, is that what you understood?
L:  I think so, except for I think they said the right to have ‘em, uh, not read certain books.
R:  Oh!  [LAUGH]
L:  I think so.  [LAUGH]  God!  Wha- you can have a loo-
R:  I’m looking at my list of what the questions are and it’s not on there.  Oh!  No, it’s not one of the ones that’s on the Fisher topics, so, I don’t know.
L:  Oh.
R:  I guess we could talk about both.
L:  Yeah, that sounds good.
R:  Oh, wait, here it is!
L:  [MN]
R:  Do you -- do either of you think public or private schools have the right to forbid students to read certain books?
L:  Okay.
R:  That -- you were right.  I would s- my answer is no.  [SIGH]
L:  Well I agree.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, but, you know, it’s always one of these where you’re going, "Well, God, do I really believe that?"  I mean, like, it’s -- but, u- uh, I guess it gets kinda confusing if they bought a book to school --
R:  Right.
L:  -- maybe?  I don’t know, maybe that would be disruptive?  I’m still just trying to search to talk, you know?  Because I --
R:  Yeah, you know what I agree.
L:  -- I don’t think I believe that!
R:  I agree because, um, I don’t think they can forbid them to read certain books but they may forbid certain books to be in the school.  But I think it’s up to the parents to decide whether they’re gonna allow or not allow their child to read any book.  And I can’t -- I have a fourteen year old -- I can’t imagine not -- telling her she can’t read something.  But, I don’t know, if she wanted to read it.  But then she’s -- she’s pretty mature and she’s pretty sophisticated, so [LAUGH], I mean --
L:  I’ve got you.  Well, we went through that.  My daughter is now twenty nine in graduate school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in poetry.
R:  Right.  Oh well, that’s --
L:  And so, uh, uh, she -- gosh, when she was about fourteen we found her with this awful book, a book that I had read [LAUGH] [several inaudible words].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [several inaudible words] and Karen Findlay and all those kind of strange --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, people.  A- and I just hit the roof.  And then [LAUGH] I boiled down and said, “Well, I guess it’s okay” you know?
R:  Mhm.  I r-
L:  You can’t really figure out what they, uh, were doing, you know?  Uh, so …
R:  I remember when I was in [SIGH] it was either second or third grade, let me think … and I was at school and at recess when -- have you ever heard of the book, Go Ask Alice?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You’ve heard of that?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it was pretty racy.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  But she brought that to school, her name was Anna, I still remember that, and she brought it to school and she’d read it at recess.  And I had, I mean, I got the gist of some of the things but some of it I had no idea, um, what they were talking about [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  But I think that was probably an inappropriate book in that grade to have [LAUGH] at school.
L:  I think so.
R:  But I still, you know, I still wouldn’t want someone telling my child what they can and can’t do in school.  I -- I actually -- I got upset when she was called to the office because someone said, you know, she was making fun of them or -- or gonna tell a story about them or something.  I’m just really, um, I don’t know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I’m non censorship I guess.
L:  I -- I, well, I -- I agree.  I agree.
R:  Mm.
L:  And -- and, uh, I think -- so may- wonder if it would be different for us thinking that way if it’s a private school?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, if you sp- put your child in a private school, they’re probably gonna have rules that say -- I guess I wouldn’t put them in if they said, “This is a list of books” or something to that effect, “You’re child can’t read”.
R:  Right.
L:  But if they’re in a private school, does the private school have the right to say, uh … “You can’t read this”?  I -- I still don’t think so.
R:  I don’t -- I s- -- I don’t see how they even could enforce it, unless it’s, “You can’t read this at school or bring this book to school”.  How -- what is to stop a child from reading a book, you know, anywhere else?
L:  Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
R:  And I went -- I grew up in private schools and went to a private Christian college and, um, yeah, I’d stop -- I was never, ever confronted with that.  Now, we have -- I live in a very conservative area of the state of Michigan and every once in a while something’ll come up like, uh, we had in a -- in a city very close to ours, basically a -- a suburb of Grand Rapids, that, um, a father was all upset about a Steinbeck novel, I think it was Of Mice And Men and --
L:  Uh, huh-uh, huh-uh.
R:  -- he thought the racist, um, things were unnecessary and so it, you know, were censored and everything.  And you can’t take a great piece of literature like that and say the whole, you know, class, the whole school can’t read it because one parent finds it offensive.  You know, it’s just not --
L:  Yeah, because you’d never --
R:  It’s not fair.  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  And additionally, it’s -- it’s like you were saying, that particular book, or any of +Steinbook -- -beck’s.  And I guess I’ve been reading the paper, they’ve been banning -- some schools somewhere had been banning, you know, certain books.  I just don’t believe --
R:  Or Harry Potter even.
L:  Yeah, yeah, and I don’t believe that.
R:  They’re also banning Harry Potter.
L:  Oh gosh, yeah, I heard that.  I forgot that.
R:  And I mean, can you imagine, with all the things going on in the world, they’re worried about kids reading Harry Potter.  I mean!  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  It seems like their priorities are kinda messed up or something.  Uh --
R:  Right.  I know -- I don’t know what they’re really trying to achieve with that, but …
L:  Yeah, well.  I’ve heard that, uh, uh, Grand Rapids -- when I was growing up, the guy across the street, I guess they’d all moved from Grand Rapids, he was a furniture maker --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a retired -- yeah --
R:  W-
L:  Which I, you know, there’s a lot around there.
R:  He was --
L:  And they used to -- they used to tell me how conservative it was.  The woman, uh, I guess his daughter, taught voice --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she was also an -- also an actress.
R:  Right.
L:  So she was on doing Damn Yankees and whatever it all was, w- you know!
R:  Mm.
L:  And I think people, they were saying some of the neighbors were --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- upset that she would do that.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I can see that.  I --
L:  Yeah.  But it was funny, where -- where I was living in -- in Houston, that’s where I grew up.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The people were kinda the same way.  They said, “I just can’t believe that person is a -- is a, uh, actress”!  [LAUGH]  You know?
R:  Right.
L:  And you -- you’re like, going, “Wow!”  Kinda like your Harry Potter comment.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  You know, why would you do it, or whatever?
R:  No, we’re very, very conservative here.  When I first came up here to go to college, because I was raised in florida, um, I couldn’t believe, um, you know, how conservative it was around here.  N- and -- and nothing was open on Sunday, and people just did the whole, you know, they stayed [NOISE] home on Sunday.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It -- did you hear a beep?
L:  Uh …
R:  I heard like, a little beep, I hope it’s not my battery in my phone!  [LAUGH]
L:  I didn’t, and mine was starting to warble, uh, we’re new to cellphones -- I’m talking on a cellphone --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it’s -- it just drives me nuts.
R:  Does it?
L:  I just think it should be like the regular phone and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- work all the time and stuff.  And plus you can be places and it just quits.
R:  Oh God!
L:  And you’re going like, you know, so anyway, that’s something.  But I don’t think it was mine, it could’ve been your battery.
R:  It could’ve been because this is the phone that is hooked up to my computer, so I don’t use it that much.
L:  That -- that’s the bane of our existence, all the batteries running down in --
R:  [LAUGH]  I know!
L:  -- in phones.  It’s just -- it’s literally stupid.
R:  I know, it is, you’re right.  Well, how do you like this -- so I -- I’m one of the few people in the world who doesn’t have a cellphone because I really don’t want anyone calling me right now!  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I -- I’m with you.  And it’s kinda dumb because my girlfriend got one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, she’s starting -- she started working kind of across town and she doesn’t like to ever running out of gas or whatever.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, so then, it was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Okay and it was kinda neat to call her if she was at the store or something.  Well then, we had Verizon, it was twenty bucks more and they gave you a free phone.  Twenty bucks more a month.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  And we could share the deal.
R:  Okay.
L:  So I just dropped long distance.
R:  Right.
L:  And, uh, with AT&T, and just use it for long distance.  Plus, she and I call, uh, you know, the odd occasion where we’re separated doing something, you know, whatever --
R:  Mm.
L:  So --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I like it, but it’s also kinda like a ball and chain, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- around you, you know.
R:  She can always get a hold of you!  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh yeah, it’s crazy!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And so her daughter and her mother [LAUGH] they live about a hundred miles from here and they -- I swear to God they talk more than, uh --
R:  Oh my God!
L:  -- they ever did.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just because of that.  And they call her, you know, whatever.  So [LAUGH] …
R:  Oh my God!
L:  I think you’re cool to keep away from the cellphone.  Not that they’re hideously bad but, uh, yeah.
R:  No, no.  But, I mean, everyone’s always talking on ‘em.  And my daughter, well actually she did get one but she ha- she had to pay for it herself, the minutes --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and she didn’t keep it up, but …
L:  Well, I tell you what I’m scared of.  Uh, and I am one of those, I’ve answered it in the car, two or three --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I did hear a beep.  Two or three times.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it, uh, then I’m talking and driving, and I’m not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- good at that.  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, we all get mad at everybody.   And so I hate that, I wish they would make the law --
R:  That you can’t do it?
L:  Yeah, because, uh, it’s done.  You know.
R:  Now, I don’t know if you guys have this in Chicago, these people, I was there the other month[?], you know, it’s -- the people are walking down the street and they have like, this wire with like a sponge on it, around their neck.  Um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and they were just talking, and that was their cellphone, uh, receiver.
L:  Oh wow!  No!
R:  And so they were just walking down the street looking like they’re talking to nobody and they’re talking on their cellphone, so they had -- didn’t have to hold anything, didn’t have to look at anything, didn’t have to, you know, nothing was on their head, it’s just like this wire round their neck with a sponge on it!  [LAUGH]
L:  God!
R:  And it was the funniest thing to see because everyone there just walks around talking on their cellphone [LAUGH] with these little things!  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, when I -- I’ve been, uh, in California recently and it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, there’s a center[?] that’s ridiculous because people are just walking up and down talking to themselves and they’re really doing their cellphones.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I haven’t seen one of those things you’re saying but, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It is, that’s crazy.
R:  It is.
L:  Um, well, I -- I’m -- I’m glad we’re kinda in agreement on that book deal.  I can see -- I can see that schools should have rules.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, like you and I tend to most agree, boy, when they start saying you can’t do -- especially reading --
R:  Right.
