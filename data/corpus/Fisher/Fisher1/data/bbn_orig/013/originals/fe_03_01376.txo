R:  This is Janet.
L:  Hello, my name is Tara.
R:  Hi, Tara.  [LIPSMACK]  So, we're talking about, um, oh, if schools should be able to  uh, censor what our kids read?
L:  Right.
R:  I think so.  I, uh, I recall when my daughter was -- my daughter was in about, um, oh, third grade maybe, and she went to a public school at that time, and they were reading a book about, uh, I think it was a farm dog.  And s- s- certain things -- she brought the book home and -- and certain things in that book, uh, the farm dog would kill the chickens.  However, like, some of the words would be like, um, "Murder, bloody murder" this is how the dog would talk, you know.  And, "Killing" those -- those types of words.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I actually went to the school and told them, what are they doing, letting little third graders read this stuff, you know?  In -- in -- in this neighborhood there's enough little kids that are on their own with -- with crime and whatnot that they don't need to be reading it in school, you know?  Even though it was just a dog and a chicken, but just the -- the words.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know, I think schools should, uh, censor what the kids read.
L:  Oh, I do too, definitely.  And I think not, you know, all the way up, all through high school.  Sometimes some of the stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have children in a private catholic school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they read books with dirty words in 'em!  [LAUGH]
R:  Is that right?
L:  And I'm paying for a catholic education!
R:  Well, y- I sent my daughter to catholic school up until this year and I -- I don't think that I ever found anything like that.  Um --
L:  You know, and -- and this point, the point of the one book they were reading was, they were trying to make it look bad, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they -- they were trying to decimate that character but, I don't know, I think they should and I think public schools too.  Um, private schools probably get by with, um, things in different ways than public schools, you know, it's re- like, regulated on a individual basis, you know --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- each school.  But, um, I don't think they do enough of that sometimes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, or a photograph saying -- even those National Geographic, there's been questions about that.
R:  Uh huh.
L:  You know, just because the photographs in the magazines.
R:  Right.
L:  It's educational.
R:  Uh huh.
L:  And you learn about the natives, but you know what adolescent girls and boys are doing, you know, so 
R:  Right, right.
L:  They look at things differently than you and I do!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  I remember the first time I saw a National Geo- Geographic --
L:  Me too!
R:  -- when I was young.
L:  Me too!
R:  You know, and I was shocked, you know.
L:  Me too!  I remember boys taking it and going into the little reading area and laughing.
R:  Uh huh.  Right, right.
L:  You know.  And -- and that's part of growing up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I don't want my kids exposed to that at school.
R:  Well, no, uh, uh, not, uh, unless I say it's okay.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Yeah, you know, ask me if it's okay.  For instance, when I was in school, um, health class we learned sex education and, um, at that time I don't recall that any note was sent home to the parents or whatnot.
L:  Right, they probably didn't, no.
R:  You know.  And I'm -- I'm forty.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  And, uh, I think these days it's, uh, I think they -- they do, um --
L:  Yeah, they -- our school does--
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where my kids are.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, you know, I know there's certain things they -- they won't -- like, some articles and things they won't allow it, they talk about sexual rituals --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in other countries and things like that.
R:  Oh.
L:  They -- they don't expose kids to stuff like that.  But I think whatever our kids are seeing, if it's not normal conversation or it's not something we would, um, not have a problem with, they should pass it by us first.
R:  I think so too.  Now, my daughter is learning in health about anorexia and, um, and the other one, uh, bulimia.
L:  Bulimia, mhm.
R:  And I -- I almost think that they should've asked me if it's okay that -- that that is, you know, a topic I'd approve of, because in a way I don't.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because she's learning something she never knew about.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  And, um, sometimes I think that it teaches the kids how to do certain things.
L:  Oh, I do too, I do too.
R:  You know.  And, uh --
L:  And different kids would react different ways too.  I don't know, I think you should always --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- know when it's anything 
R:  That's --
L:  That's just my personal opinion.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm hoping, you know, now, let's see, she's in, uh, sixth grade and I'm hoping, you know, when their -- I don't know when their -- their sex education starts, but first of all the health teacher is this old guy and I don't think she'd feel comfortable learning from him anyway.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, give me a choice, because actually I'd rather, uh, inform her of that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'd prefer to do that myself.
L:  Yeah, I prefer that with the sex education too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it's a mandatory program within the -- where I'm in St Louis --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in the catholic archdiocese here.  And it's a good program but I just think I'd rather my kids learn it from me --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- than from some, you know, sixty year old gravelly voiced woman or man!  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, oh, that's a good ex- their first experience [LAUGH] --
R:  Right!
L:  -- hearing about this!  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, and by choice I tend- I tended to go over those particular sections at home first, so that it came from me first, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- even, you know, anything.  If there's something that's gonna come up in a novel or something they're reading for literature, if we know first, we can even put it into a different context at home.
R:  Right.  Mhm.
L:  Or well, you know, "This is how some people are but this is how we're trying to raise you" and you know, so that  you know, they're gonna figure out that stuff's all out there but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I would like my influence being the first influence.
R:  Yeah.  I haven't, uh, discussed that in t- uh, in detail with my daughter [LAUGH] yet.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, but my son is -- is almost nineteen, you know, and -- and I have with him when he was like, seven.  For some reason it just seems harder with my daughter!
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but, uh, my daughter, uh, her little friend, they ha- she has a boyfriend, you know, the -- not my daughter but her little friend -- and the boyfriend and the girlfriend were holding hands at school, and the principal said, you know, "What is this?  Uh, what are you doing holding hands in school?" you know.  And, so, if they're gonna be that, um, aware of what the kids are doing, I do hope that they are going to be conscious about what they're reading, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  When the time comes, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I never did get that book, um, uh, when she was in third grade, taken out of the school or off the library shelves.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, you know, I had a meeting with the -- the principal and -- and sent emails to the school board and whatnot, and everybody just blows it off like it's no big deal.
L:  I know.
R:  And, you know, with -- with the -- the young kids that are home with a single mom, and I'm a single mom, but -- but I work to -- where I can always be with my kids.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But a lot of mothers don't.  So these kids come home from school by themselves, uh, come home and they're exposed to that element out there and plus their reading, "Murder, bloody murder" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- regardless if it's coming from a dog who killed a chicken, you know?  And -- and talking about the blood everywhere.  I mean, that's just not necessary, there's so many other things that they can --
L:  Right.
R:  -- read about.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  You know?  Read about the -- there was a kid who -- who helped the -- the hungry man or something, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, I don't know.  I'm -- I'm surprised I got this call though!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah!
R:  'Cause I haven't had one in a long time and I was just, uh, reading on that, uh, on one of the -- the bulletin boards about this and -- and everybody was saying, "Oh, did you get another call yet? I -- I -- I didn't get one".
L:  Yeah, this is only my second one too.
R:  Yeah, mine too.
L:  And it's been quite a while for me too.
R:  Yes.
L:  And my last one, believe it or not, was on education also.
R:  Oh.
L:  Public versus cath- uh, versus private education, I can't remember exactly, but --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- um, yeah, I haven't --
R:  I prefer a private school.  Uh, I just got into a, you know, a financial state where I could no longer send her there.  Uh, now -- now --
L:  Yeah, well, it -- I don't know where you're at and how much it is, but phew!
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I'm in Texas and I -- it's just -- it's -- the -- the one I sent her to is the closest to my home, uh, it's probably about four hundred a month.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  That's what I'm paying, in St Louis.
R:  Yeah, it goes up every year.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It goes up like, every year, you know.  But now --
L:  I'm paying four hundred a month, is what I'm paying.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And my son's going to high school next year --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- and it's about ten thousand dollars!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So  [MN]
R:  Now, her dad lives in a -- in a little better neighborhood so I just used his address and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she goes to school there and I feel pretty -- pretty secure, but she is learning things there that she didn't learn in private school, um, from the other kids.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  That, I mean, she just -- the other -- the kids in the private school [LAUGH] they didn't -- they just didn't, uh, speak about certain things.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  Um --
L:  And although it's -- I mean, I don't know how -- where private education's going because, I mean, it's gonna be just for elite people.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Normal, you know, working class people aren't gonna be able to do it.
R:  I know, that's right.
L:  I mean, my -- we say it all the time, you know, if I was starting out today I don't know if I'd do it.
R:  Really?
L:  I just don't know if I would.  I'm sure I'd want to.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But w- if I went, you know, I -- my oldest is in eighth grade.  When he started out it was a hundred and, uh, like forty dollars a month.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And now we're up to, you know, it's just -- i- in eight years, nine years, I can't believe how much it's gone up.
R:  I know.  Yeah, it was like a hundred and fifty six a month when I started.
L:  Yeah, it's just ridiculous.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's so far out of the -- and I stay home and my husband's an electrician --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a union electrician.  So, he makes a good living but gee, it's gonna be tough, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And our kids are two years apart, so --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- it's gonna be tough.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know how we're gonna do it.  Well, I know I'll probably be back working --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I'm trying not to do that, but, phew, I don't know.
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  I don't know where it's going.
R:  Yeah.  You know, and i- it's --
L:  Buy you know why you pay it?  It's to keep 'em away from stuff.
R:  That's right.  Exactly.
L:  That's exactly why you pay the money.
R:  That's why you do it.
L:  Keep them away from as much as you can.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the education, I have not found the education to be that much more
