L:  Hi, I'm Ginger Davis and I live in Georgia.
R:  Hi, I'm Sheila and I live in Ohio.
L:  Oh, I used to live in Ohio.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, what city?
L:  Uh, right outside of Columbus.
R:  Oh, gosh, okay, we're in, um, it's Delaware.  I don't -- it's just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- north of Columbus.
L:  Yeah, I remember Delaware.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We lived in Reynoldsburg.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Good.
L:  So, we've gotta talk about health and fitness [LAUGH].
R:  Yes [LAUGH].
L:  I'm on again, off again [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, me too.  In fact we have some of -- this big like -- it's kind of a big like you sit on it and you can kind of row and --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- do the legs and the whole thing but it's in the attic.  So, I just --
L:  Oh, that's not doing you a lot of good.
R:  -- said to my husband, "We gotta get that out again".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you can't do much with it in the attic.
R:  No, no.
L:  Well, we have a weight room at our house but finding --
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  Yeah, but it -- finding time to actually use it is another thing.
R:  Right.  We, um --
L:  But I like to walk.  I'd like to have a, uh, a treadmill in my house.
R:  Yeah, that'd be good.  I actually walk quite a bit, that's probably my best, um, way of exercising.  I have a friend that's in the neighborhood that I walk with.  We used to walk probably about an hour three or four times a week --
L:  Yeah, oh that's great.
R:  -- and I felt like that was great 'cause we would just talk and, you know, we didn't walk real fast but just doing it, I think, was nice.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I used to -- well, I need to get back with doing it.  I lost twenty five pounds.
R:  Oh, wow, that's great!
L:  Over the last year.  Yeah.
R:  I just read -- was starting to read on the Internet some of the Atkins Diet stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause we have another neighbor who lost about -- we have a nine month old and so --
L:  Yeah, I have a two year old.
R:  -- I was on a lot of bedrest and everything with him and so I feel like now that, um, you know, he's nine months I'm really starting to say seriously, "I've really got a get this baby weight off". 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's just hard to -- it seems like finding the time when he's still so little.
L:  It's very hard.  Yeah, I did Weight Watchers.
R:  Oh, did you?
L:  Yeah and --
R:  After kids [COUGH].
L:  -- um, you take it off very slowly and it tends to stay off better.
R:  Huh.
L:  But they do -- you know, they do stress some exercise and I did -- I've all these tapes they're called, "Walk away the pounds".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's a video tape and they last -- average about a half hour.  And, um, it's a good work out, it's a really good workout first thing in the morning.
R:  Huh.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah you get -- about the tape the target and it seemed to be the rage with, um, the people at Weight Watchers.
R:  Huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, was that walk away the pounds?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's a good idea I'll have to check that out.
L:  Yeah.  Lesley Sandson is the lady that's in it.
R:  Oh, that's familiar, yeah okay.
L:  Yeah.  Um, I was really --
R:  So, have you heard -- do you know people on the Atkins?  Have you heard anything about that or...?
L:  I don't know anything -- anybody on it, mhm, I really don't know a whole lot about it.
R:  It's the thing where you, you know, eat all the protein and not the carbohydrates but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think the reason it was appealing is, uh, we had a friend who just lost seventeen pounds in two weeks and it was --
L:  Ooh, that's not good.
R:  Yeah, we'll that's what I wondered.  It just looked appealing --
L:  Ah, she lost a lot of water.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not fat.  
R:  Right.
L:  You need to lose fat.  And in order to lose fat you need to eat less fat.
R:  Right.
L:  And increase your fiber because fiber is like, um, my husband describes it as being, uh, a scrub brush for your insides. 
R:  Huh.
L:  [LAUGH] Helps clean you out.
R:  Yeah, that's good.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I'm still nursing and I think because of that I feel like I can't really focus too much on losing until I'm done nursing.
L:  Well, you can --
R:  I guess I just feel like I don't wanna --
L:  -- but not too much.  You don't wanna lose too much.
R:  Well, yeah, I mean I just -- I-- I -- I notice that I'm -- I feel like I'm always a lot hungrier when I'm nursing and --
L:  Oh yeah, you need to drink plenty.  I'm nursing too.  I've  -- I have six kids so I've nursed five of 'em.
R:  Oh my gosh!  We have four.
L:  Yeah.  Really?
R:  But, yeah --
L:  Wow.
R:  This is our fourth.  I'm thinking this is it though but --
L:  Oh no.
R:  I just -- it's a scrape.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh wow, so six, my goodness.
L:  Yeah.  I nursed five because one's adopted so I couldn't nurse her.  
R:  Oh.
L:  She was eight when we adopted her.
R:  Oh.
L:  But, um --
R:  Well, that's great.
L:  Yeah, and it's hard to exercise too when you've got a nursing baby.
R:  Right, that's the thing with -- that's what I'm finding out just -- it's finding time and with the, um, older ones it seems like there's a lot of driving around and --
L:  Uh-huh, tell me about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My oldest is thirteen so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, and the youngest will be two next month so --
R:  Oh, well that's great.  So, did you guys leave Columbus for, um, Georgia --
L:  Yeah.
R:  What family or just jobs or ...?
L:  Um, we -- we liv- -- we are from South Carolina.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And so we wanted to get back closer to our parents.
R:  Yeah, well that's nice.
L:  And, um, I'd had enough of the cold weather.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] And -- we lived up there for, um, seven years, yeah.
R:  Oh gosh.
L:  Seven years and I just -- I never grew to love it [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I just couldn't get used to the cold weather so I was --
R:  Yeah.
L:   "Please take me back south" it's warm here.
R:  Yeah.  We like -- we like some of the winter sports like in the winter we even -- we go to a cabin in West Virginia every year for a couple of weeks and --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  -- we do a lot of the like cross country skiing and sledding and everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I think we would miss that but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But we always enjoy trying to go down south at least once a year.
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  Florida usually but -- or North Carolina, South Carolina [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I love it here, I really do.  I haven't been back to Ohio since we left.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we left on Valentine's Day nineteen ninety seven.
R:  Oh my gosh.
L:  That was the best Valentine's present [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's good.
L:  Oh yes, we got -- we still have friends there but we've -- we've not gone back. but --
R:  So, are you on the -- are you in Lila's list at all?  Did you find out this about that or --
L:  You know, I did.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, I am too.
L:  That's exactly where I found out.
R:  Yeah, good.  So, do you -- do you do mystery shopping or merchandising?
L:  I do, I both.
R:  Oh gosh.  Me too.
L:  I sure do.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I haven't -- I'm not doing a lot right now because of the baby --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, um, I -- I've a regular merchandising sunglass job that I do.
L:  Oh, now that I would love to get.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Ooh.
R:  Now, I'm like that.  It's Capo, C.A.P.O. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I don't know if they have that in your city but, um --
L:  I don't know.  I'll have to check into that.
R:  -- I got it from, um, Narves[?], I think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I just applied and it's --
L:  Yeah, I get a lot from Narves.
R:  -- nice, it's like thirteen each -- dollars each stop and really I'd say my stops only take like twenty minutes.
L:  Wow.
R:  Basically, just, you know, taking 'em out and restocking and dusting and so that's a nice one.
L:  Uh.
R:  And mystery shopping right now, mainly I just take restaurants so that's kind of  --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, one night out, you know, --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- with the kids, the husband and --
L:  Yeah.  We do -- I do a lot of that.  I love to do that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The big one here is, um -- and I get called for this a lot and I turn it down some but it's Papa John's Pizza.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  And, um, you, uh, you can do car- -- delivery or carry out.  I do delivery so they deliver it, I don't have to leave my house.
R:  Yeah, that's nice.
L:  I have to -- I have to cut it with a, um, knife --
R:  Oh yeah, that --
L:  And then take pictures of it, digital pic- -- with the digital camera and then send 'em to 'em.
R:  Right.
L:  Immediately.  And they pay me for the pizza plus like five dollars.  So, --
R:  Yeah, that's not bad.
L:  -- free pizza and then you get paid.  Yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, I think I've done so- -- I've only done one for that company, Corey[?] but, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think but I've only done one for them but I should start try- -- checking them out and do some more.
L:  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  I enjoy that.
R:  But one company I suggest, I don't know if they have some in your areas, Bestmark[?], have you worked for them at all?
L:  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.
R:  I like the -- they've got really good restaurants.  In Fresno we just got a really good one, um, like fifty five dollars, we're starting to get a hundred dollars for one so in our area they've just got some great ones.
L:  Oh wow!  Oh super!
R:  Yeah, my husband's going to do the hundred dollar one and do it -- take a business person --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but it just seems like we've got some great ones lately with them.
L:  You know, that reminds me, you know what I miss the most about Ohio?  You live in Delaware, guess what I miss?
R:  What?
L:  Der Dutchman.
R:  Oh yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, oh I miss it.  It's so good.
R:  Oh it's funny, I'm going there tomorrow night with a ladies night.
L:  Oh, I'm so mad.
R:  That's funny [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'll eat some food for you there.
L:  Oh, they have the best food.  We used to go there quite often and it was a good, you know, forty minute drive for us but well worth it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, we used to take friends up there -- any time family come we would take them up there.
R:  Yeah, wow.
L:  You know they -- yes, Der Dutchman. Oh.
R:  That's fun.
L:  You'd have to sit out and wait on that porch.
R:  That's neat.  Now, is this your first or second call, or third or -- do you know?
L:  This is my second.
R:  Me too.  So, they must --
L:  They tried to call me several times on my cellphone --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but I'm usually out and I forget to take my pin with me 
R:  Oh.
L:   -- my pin number.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So, I'm like, "I can't take it" 'cause it's not as though I even answer.
R:  That's something they didn't for it, did they ask you?
L:  No.
R:  I think it's new.  I think they set it up in a new way.
L:  Well, I hope so because when they called I'm going, "Oh no, that must --" you know, my husband must of thought I was nuts.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm like, "Oh" you know, it come up on the caller ID, I said, "Oh, I've gotta go now".  I was running out of the bedroom with the phone.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He was probably thinking, "Gosh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- has she lost her mind?"  He probably has no clue what I'm doing.
R:  That's funny.
L:  And I had to go find the pin, which was on the refrigerator and then didn't even need it.
R:  Right, that's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the same with me.  I thought that was weird.  I -- yeah.  But my email is Sheila Hart at AOL dot com so if you ever see me on the list.  I don't post a lot but occasionally.
L:  Sheila Hart.
R:  Right.
