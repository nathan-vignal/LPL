R:  You can work out in the house.  It's called the Ab Swing and they -- it seems pretty good.  I mean, a lotta people are buying it.  [NOISE]
L:  But isn't it expensive and it occupies a lot of space, no?
R:  Um, no, it's small.  It's not that big, it's -- it works out the stomach area.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And it's very small, you can put it right under your bed and, um, it's very small, very small, yeah.
L:  Oh, I see, yeah.  [several inaudible words].  But, once you buy it you've got to use it!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah!  'Cause it's expensive too [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  You have to use it, you're right about that.
L:  Yeah.  I have a gym membership and also I live just across -- across the street from the gym.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, it's very nice for me go there and I plan it but I have time.
R:  Right.
L:  But still I have very busy schedule.
R:  Okay, right.
L:  So 
R:  A very busy schedule?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm -- I'm doing a graduate -- doing graduate studies, so 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, are you?
L:  W- what?
R:  You say graduate studies?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  I- I- I'm a graduate student, so 
R:  Okay.
L:  So it's kind of hard, you know, sometimes.  Especially when the semester is towards the end, uh, in t- towards the end.
R:  Right.
L:  It's very hectic, you know?
R:  Gotta lot of studying.
L:  Yeah, papers to write.
R:  Do you, um, [LIPSMACK] do any of your friends work out?
L:  Well, I don't -- I- I- I -- I will try to work out together with my friend --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it was really hard to, you know, work the schedules together.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Right.
L:  But my friend is also doing her graduate studies.
R:  Right.
L:  So, we tried but we just gave it up.
R:  Ye-
L:  But, whenever, you know, I go to the gym, I always run into my classmates or some acquaintances.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it's not a very uncomfortable feeling, even though I work out on my own in a gym.
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  And a lot of students are working out.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So a lot of acquaintances to say hi to.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's very nice too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and there's no people around.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, especially when you are wearing like, you know, tight pants!
R:  Right, right.
L:  You don't wanna be giving yourself too much --
R:  Right, you're right.
L:  -- to strange people!
R:  You're right, you're right.
L:  Yes, it's very nice.
R:  Um --
L:  -- in that respect.
R:  Yeah, you're right.  [LIPSMACK]  Um, they, um, what was I gonna say as far as working ou- oh, you know what, the one thing -- the reason -- one of the reasons why I'm trying to is because it just builds energy.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, it gives you energy and stamina, you know, so that's one of the reasons why I kinda wanted to start working out and just stay fit.
L:  But it's not -- nothing to -- it's not for like, losing weight or anything like that?
R:  Um, I do wanna tone a little bit and lose maybe a little bit of weight but I would like to tone, yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I would like to tone up a little bit.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  That's another reason, yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's what -- what I'm interested in too.
R:  Toning?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, okay.
L:  I mean, but I never --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Hm.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And how's, I mean, and also healthy eating should be accompanied.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  Should go together with exerci- with regular exercise I heard.
R:  Right.
L:  Have you ever done like, fitness test in a gym or somewhere?
R:  Hm?
L:  Have you done a fitness test?  Like, it -- it just wanna tell you how much bad you've got --

L:  Okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ye- but I -- I just heard it from my friends.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  It doesn't cost that much but it's still interesting, you know.
R:  Oh, okay.  What state do you live in?
L:  Well, did it just measure, you know, your, I don't know, blood test --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and pressure, blood pressure, that kind of stuff, you know.
R:  Oh okay. Yeah, I got my -- I mean, I did do a, um, cholesterol and a blood, um, [LIPSMACK] and a --what is it, a blood sugar test, that was good, I did it, um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Oh.
R:  I did something, another test.  Chole- mm, no, cholesterol, not cholesterol, another test, I can't remember.  But, um, yeah, me and my sister, we just -- w- w- you know, we wanna work out and we probably -- we skate too, so that was one of the things that we were gonna try to do, you know, as a workout little thing, something that we like doing that we know we can work out.  And my fiance, he suggested running.  Do you like running?
L:  Not really!  [LAUGH]
R:  Me neither!  [LAUGH]
L:  Outside?
R:  Yeah, yeah, outside!  [LAUGH]  N-
L:  [LAUGH]  No.
R:  Me -- me neither.  I, um, I've try -- I prefer running on the treadmill.
L:  Yeah, I prefer, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  It's pretty embarrassing too!
R:  Yeah!  [LAUGH]
L:  Because running on the road or on the street --
R:  Yeah!  [LAUGH]  You're right, yeah.
L:  But where does he -- he [inaudible] run?
R:  Where does he run?
L:  Yeah, where?
R:  Outside.  You know, just like everybody.  He likes running, he'll run outside or around the block or so.
L:  I see.  I see.  But do you guys w- play a ga- like a tennis or anything like that, together?
R:  Oh yeah!  Tennis too.  I -- I -- I -- I -- I do do tennis in the summer time and I swim in the summer time, that is one of my activities that I do.
L:  Do you do -- do you do that kind of activities on your own or with your esp- fiance, or ?
R:  Um, sometimes we might play tennis together but he's not really a swimmer like I am.
L:  Oh.
R:  I'll swim, you know, probably by myself or, you know, do a couple of laps or so.
L:  Okay.
R:  But, um, you know, he'll play tennis with me every once in a while.  We, you know, we'll play tennis.
L:  That must be nice, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And to share a time together, and j- why you're doing exercise together.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  That's wonderful.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, for me, I -- I -- I'm single, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't have any spouse or any partner to go to at that, but still, you know, to look for -- I -- I will always thinking that it must be nice to have someone t- to -- to exercise together.
R:  It's like motiva- right, 'cause it's like motivating one another.
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And also like socializing yourself, you know.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Getting to know each other better!
R:  Yeah, yeah.

R:  Right.
L:  Like reading at home or 
R:  That's tru- yeah.  You want somebod- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's why -- yeah, it's sometimes motivating when you have, you know, like, a, you know, like a s- I used to go to Ballys[?].  And, you know, I just liked being around that atmosphere, you know, other people that's working out, it's kinda motivating --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- rather than, uh, you know, working right out in your house --
L:  Yeah.
