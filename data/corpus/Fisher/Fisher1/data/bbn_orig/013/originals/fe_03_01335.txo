R:  Hi, my name is Cindy, nice to meet you.
L:  Hi, my name is Paul.
R:  Hi.
L:  How are you, Cindy?
R:  Oh, not too bad, trying to get the kids to sleep.
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So where are you from?
R:  I'm from Canada. 
L:  Oh, cool, I'm from -- I'm from Georgia originally.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  But I'm in Utah now going to s-- going to college.
R:  Oh, great.
L:  I go to Brigham Young University.
R:  Good.
L:  And, um, I'm -- I'm studying chemical engineering right now.
R:  Oh, well, I'm in the Vancouver area in BC Canada.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Way up north.
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I've never been up that far.
R:  No?
L:  I've been up to the Falls, Niagara Falls, but --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  That's as close as I've gotten.
R:  Yeah, it's quite a ways away yet. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  So, okay, I guess we're supposed to talk about, ah --
R:  Criminal trials.
L:  Yeah, mhm.  Well, let's see, I don't know too much about this but -- 
R:  I have -- I don't either but -- [LAUGH]
L:  Well, let's see, I remember -- 
R:  I've watched them somewhat.
L:  Excuse me?
R:  I watched, um -- I watched, ah, little bits of some, some trials.
L:  Yeah.  I remember watching all the OJ Simpson stuff, you know, years ago.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I remember that and, ah, I thought that was -- I thought it was interesting, you know, to see that and see how it all worked out and just kind of see what went on.
R:  Well, yeah, that's the thing.  It -- ah, ah, the only thing that sometimes, for example, what happened with that, is it, basketball player? 
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  It's interesting but up to what point once you start hearing about how he's getting money for -- for continuing on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, like it seems like it's more of a publicity type thing.  
L:  Yo.
R:  And so it makes you wonder how much of it is -- is -- is televised because he wants to keep getting money, you know.
L:  That's true, that's true, 'cause --
R:  And yet there's other trials that, um -- that are really interesting because, ah, [COUGH] it talks about, um, criminals that have done things [NOISE] and so it's interesting to hear how they -- how they are able to catch him.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  You know, so I find that interesting.
L:  Yeah.  I think, yeah, you're right, you know, there's kind of a negative side to that.  You can get some sort of stuff where they're just doing it for publicity just to get money.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's not good.
R:  No, no.
L:  But, yeah, I think it was, yeah, I guess the only really example of this I've really watched was the OJ Simpson stuff so I guess I kind of liked that just 'cause you got to see just, you know, it kind of lets you in on stuff and what's really going on.
R:  Mhm, that's true.
L:  Because I think there's a lot of things that go on that we don't realize.
R:  A lot of things that are behind the scenes -- 
L:  Yeah, uh-uh. 
R:  -- and are hidden from the public.
L:  Yup, and, you know, I think it's good for us to know about what's going on with the jud- judicial systems and, and, [NOISE] ah, but then, you know, you kind of want to -- but I think there's some stuff that should be censored.  I know that there is some stuff such as the war where they're -- I guess it isn't a public trial I guess but -- or different where -- but they are going to show some gruesome scenes of soldiers.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  And I think that's a good thing not to show.
R:  No, no, that's right.
L:  I think with trials you can have the same thing, you know, it's a murder or something like that. 
R:  Mhm, mhm. 
L:  Um.
R:  That's true because then it's -- it's more then of a spectacle.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and it's not a good thing to show that on -- on TV.
L:  Yep.  And people become desensitized to that, you know.  They just like -- they get so used to it.
R:  That's right.
L:  That the fact that somebody dies or somebody is murdered is not a big deal any more and it's just, like, hey, somebody's life was taken, you know.
R:  That's right.
L:  Need to realize how serious that is.
R:  That's right, that's right.  A lot of it -- a lot [NOISE] of the desensitizing though comes also from what is generally left [NOISE] on the TV.
L:  Yeah, that's true, you're right.
R:  And so there's so much violence that, ah -- 
L:  Yo. 
R:  -- it ends up where people -- well, they see it on -- they see the real thing that is shown [NOISE] on the news like now with the war, they see the real thing in a trial and it's not -- no big deal any more.  It doesn't really sink in.
L:  Uh-uh. 
R:  Because people are, you know, it doesn't seem real any more because everything that you see is not real and so it ends up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It doesn't really have the same effect.
L:  It's kind of this -- it's kind of this other world that's not even real any more.  It's just kind of [NOISE] -- you just -- you see it on your little black screen and that's all, it's true.
R:  And so then what happens too that, ah, [COUGH] it could be that these very public people that have their trials and they -- they show things and so they -- they try to make it more sensational so that people will -- 
L:  Yo.
R:  -- will pay more attention because they have been desensitized type thing. [NOISE]
L:  Yep. 
R:  It could be -- have an effect.
L:  Yeah.  I think that's definitely a negative side of that where they just every time they put more hype and show more shocking material just so that people will, you know, watch it more.
R:  They'll be more glued and then of course the -- the different, um, stations and they'll all say well they'll get their ratings up and they'll get their money and then -- 
L:  Yo.
R:  -- and then the public person that has given them the right to show it, well, then they get their money and so -- 
L:  Yo.
R:  You know, there's always that economic factor.
L:  That's true. [NOISE]
R:  In it.
L:  I guess really you kind of make some trade offs by publicizing, you know, ah, trials of criminals.
R:  That's true.
L:  It's a kind of -- it's kind of a trade off, I guess. 
R:  In order to see it there has to be that -- that part [NOISE] of it, this has only have to have -- give the right to be -- have it watched.
L:  Yeah.  Maybe they should -- you know, maybe they should publicize them [NOISE] but in a -- in a more serious way, you know, in a very formal I guess is a better word.
R:  That's true.  Yeah, not -- 
L:  In a formal way.
R:  -- not so [NOISE] sensationalized.
L:  Right.  When they publicize it, you know, it's just kind of the camera and the court and little reviews, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So if you're really interested in what's going on, they give you a little review of what's going -- you know, [NOISE] what has happened and where they're going with the decision and also some people know that I guess it's good that people know that the -- you know, that the judicial branch is really taking on their duty and their --
R:  That's true, yeah.
L:  They're catching people. [NOISE]
R:  And I -- I thought that idea of yours was good that they -- they should formalize it more, for example, instead of get -- having, um, each, um, you know, NBC or CBC or whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They have -- try to get the rights and they're fighting over who's going to have it televised.
L:  Yo.
R:  But have the judge decide.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And let him say and so nobody is going to be the winner here because it's, um, it's going to be something that's only [NOISE] for public knowledge.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And not something that everybody is going to be gaining or trying to get money out of it.
L:  Mhm, that's very true, and to keep it real -- [NOISE] real biased you know, no -- where they like they put in their little political twist, you know or -- or -- 
R:  That's right, yeah.  Each one has to get their -- they want to get their side so that people are swayed.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, they say, "Oh, this", you know, "He's in the right" and -- whereas nobody except those that are really judging it know all the facts.
L:  Yo.
R:  And a lot of times that that -- that can sway -- sway, [NOISE] you know, somebody for it and I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's a tough question really. [NOISE]
L:  It is, you just kind of -- it's just kind of -- it's something that I guess neither of us has really had a lot of experience with.  It's like, well, kind of making some opinions here -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but as far as a set answer, well, you know, I guess it's worth -- that's why we talk about it for to figure out where we want to go with this. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's definitely -- it is just something -- [NOISE]
R:  Then of course, in the States, because -- shh, shh, shh Daisy, Daisy, be quiet -- because, ah, ah, each -- each province here or each state there in the States -- [NOISE] 
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  -- has their own little laws.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Then it would have to be something that would be done everywhere because then what happens is that, well, we'll have the trial in this other state or this other province because it will be more convenient for us.
L:  That's true.
R:  Instead of having it all -- um, uniform [NOISE] so that it -- the laws are more uniform and not so, ah, different from one place to the other.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It seems that people get away with things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because they can just switch to somewhere else and say, "Well, go to this other place because there they can't catch me" even though it's the same country.
L:  Yeah, you're right.
R:  You know.
L:  You need to make sure that -- on, you know, a -- a federal level and also on state or provincial level.
R:  That's right.
L:  You have, you know --
R:  They seem to have so much independence now that -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're almost like little countries.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  And so they -- that's -- you know, these people, they're high profile and they have money and they -- they can get their lawyers to get the loopholes -- 
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  -- and they know, "Well, you should go there because that's where you will probably get free".
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  "Or you'll probably get the best", you know.
L:  You're right. 
R:  Instead of having it the same everywhere so that they can't do that.
L:  Yeah, that's very true [NOISE] and then, you know, there's a big deal about trying to choose, ah, you know, the right judge whatever that's not -- hasn't heard too much about it, and so there's definitely a negative effect right there in that when you publicize it -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, people -- whenever it's harder to find jurors.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That are biased and the judge is biased -- 
R:  That's right.
L:  -- because they've probably already heard stuff [NOISE] and so they have probably already formed opinions about things, you know, so it's kind of hard to find a virgin -- a virgin mind that hasn't been decided yea or nay yet. 
R:  That's right. 
L:  So that -- 
R:  That's why it's so difficult to get [COUGH] then a -- a truly fair trial.
L:  Yeah, that's true, you know, so I guess in some ways it would probably -- you know, it's like kind of an up for not publicizing it all over the place because then you can get [NOISE] -- you can get anything -- you can pick people out that, you know, there's not public pressure, you know, you just separate the judge's choice and public opinions and pressures and, you know, political idea --
