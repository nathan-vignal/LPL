R:  Hello. 
L:  Hello. 
R:  Hi. 
L:  Hi, my name's Jessica. 
R:  I'm Meredith. 
L:  Nice to talk to you.
R:  Nice to talk to you too.
L:  Um, okay, well, the only trial that I can really think of that I watched was the OJ Simpson of course. 
R:  Yeah, I kind of avoided that one just because there was so much hype going on around it.  Um, I mean, I remember being in high school and, um, what's it called, you're -- do you remember that trial where, like, it was one of the Kennedy cousins I think was --
L:  Yeah, the -- yes. 
R:  What was her name, Susan Smith, or something like that?
L:  Yes, yes, I believe you are right.
R:  And she had a -- she had a blue spot on her face for, like, the whole thing and then they revealed her name afterwards I think.
L:  I don't remember that part of it.  I only remember -- I remember the big hype on it being a Kennedy of course. 
R:  Right, right. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Because it always is when it's one of them.
L:  Yeah.  The only -- I'm trying to think of another trial besides OJ Simpson that was hyped, um, something more recent probably.  Well, the -- the Blake one going on right now will be.
R:  What's that one?
L:  The Blake, the, um, he was in DragNet.  He killed his wife. 
R:  Oh, that guy?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Okay.
L:  Ronald Blake is his name I believe. 
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, he was accused of killing his wife. 
R:  Right.  I think I remember reading about that on the internet but I actually don't watch a whole lot of television these days. 
L:  It's too depressing.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. 
L:  All the trials and everything, it's too depressing.
R:  I used to watch, like, you know, Judge Walkner all the time when I was little. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] yeah, I like Judge Judy.  She just tells it like it is.  She's always yelling at 'em. 
R:  But I think that's more supposed to be like entertainment, than -- than, really, you know, actually watching, um, you know, criminal or civil justice in progress. 
L:  Very true, very true.  She, um, -- I think it's kind of acting, and when it gets to that point, I can't -- maybe there are people that actually do those kind of things [LAUGH] that are on there, but I don't know -- I've never seen it happen before. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I kind of get the impression that it's a very Jerry Springer kind of [LAUGH] -- kind of -- kind of person that, you know, that has their -- that has their disputes settled on television.
L:  Very true, [COUGH] very true.  Um, --
R:  But, so do you think that -- do you think that big trials should be televised? 
L:  Um, [SIGH] I don't know.  I would have to say that I would think that in some trials, I mean, it probably does affect or sway the jury although they're sequestered or whatever, not supposed to see anything, and I just, [NOISE] you know, I mean, I can't imagine that they don't at least hear something. 
R:  Yeah, and it has got to be really hard on the -- on the people that are in the jury. 
L:  Right. 
R:  You know, being separated from pretty much everything. 
L:  Exactly. 
R:  For such a long period of time because these important trials always last a really long time. 
L:  Exactly.  I would -- you know, I mean, if I was to be on one of those, I would think that it would just be easier to keep the cameras out of the TV -- out of -- out of the courtroom, and it would save a lot, you know, of the hassle. 
R:  Right.  I wonder if people really differentiate in their minds between, um, um, you know, between really large trials and smaller things like Judge Judy. 
L:  I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  I mean, I found I watched -- I actually was in school when the whole OJ Simpson thing happened and the teacher was always emphasizing and talking about it and, you know, watching bits and pieces about what's going on, and when -- I -- I have to think that some of the TV and how they actually show it kind of makes you sway your opinion. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I don't -- I mean, I, of course -- I mean, I have my own opinion about him being guilty but -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  At the same time, you know, I mean, I'm sure there's a lot of evidence too that could have maybe persuaded someone to think differently. 
R:  Right.  Yeah, I mean it's hard to say.  I personally think he was guilty too.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But there has to be some reason, I mean, that those -- all those jurors found them not guilty. 
R:  Right, and I don't really know what that would have been. 
L:  I don't either. [LAUGH]
R:  It was also -- it was also a long time ago. 
L:  Right.  Everything I saw on TV [LAUGH] would totally make me think he was guilty --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- but, I mean, I mean, I mean, they could have very well just been more afraid of more riots and stuff like all that other kind of stuff. 
R:  Oh, the [inaudible] like after Rodney King, yeah. 
L:  Oh, the Rodney King one.  There's another one.  [LAUGH] yeah, that -- that was kind of scary.  I don't know where you live but I'm only probably about -- forty minutes from LA. 
R:  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I was in Houston at the time that that happened. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And, yeah, now I'm in Iowa. 
L:  Oh, wow. 
R:  Yeah, far from anything big.  [LAUGH]
L:  Must be nice. 
R:  It gets kind of boring after a while.
L:  [LAUGH] well, I'd -- I'd like a little less excitement. 
R:  [LAUGH] I can understand that.
L:  But --
R:  So were you actually in town when the riots happened? 
L:  No, no.  I was, you know, actually I think I was only, God, what, seventeen when that happened. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  So I -- you know, I wouldn't be down there.  I -- I live about forty minutes -- forty miles north, so you go down there for everything.  I work down there but at the same time, when I was younger I didn't leave town, so I mean, it wasn't a big thing for me except to watch it on TV. 
R:  Okay.  Still it had to be pretty frightening? 
L:  Yeah, because, you know, you kind of all know where they are going to go with that.  You just -- 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  You don't know how far or whoever's going to take it. 
R:  And you have to wonder just how much the media coverage, you know, led to the situation being even more racially charged. 
L:  Oh, I'm sure, very much so, very much so, especially just like what the Rodney King thing then turned into, you know, the big riots there and then that Reginald Dennie guy, the white man that got pulled out of the car. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  You know, then it turns into two separate things and I don't know, just turns into way too much.  But, um -- 
R:  It seems like people are willing to turn just about anything into entertainment today though I mean just look at how CNN has been just non stop war coverage. 
L:  Oh, yeah, everything.  Anything, anything to get people to watch it.  And, I mean, we know -- everybody knows we're going to watch it but, I mean, as far as trials, I don't really find them as, you know, of course right now what's going on in the world is big news but as far as trials, I mean, they don't really affect me so much.  I guess I don't really find too much entertainment value out of them. 
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I guess there are people who find it sort of, you know, interesting the way that watching a car wreck is interesting. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that's very true though. 
R:  You know, look at the horrible things that people can do to people, through Joseph Conrad.   
L:  Yeah, yeah, or even just exactly like you said even like, you know, look, he loses it at traffic and you got to think at -- you know, that's still someone's life. 
R:  Right.
L:  And that's still something that happened to somebody.  Just, you know, I mean -- 
R:  But I wonder if it kind of distances people from the actual, you know, fr- fr- from what really went on.  Like, if we're watching it on TV, then it's kind of like watching a story, something that really didn't happen. 
L:  Oh, yeah, I was -- I mean, in a lot of ways it's like a daily sit com or daily, you know. 
R:  [LAUGH] in a really sick and twisted kind of way.
L:  Yeah, it -- it, well, it is.  You get to find out, oh, this is what happened today and, yeah, you know, the other recent one that was on there, now that I'm thinking about it, is that David Westerfield from San Diego that killed the little girl, um, out here in San Diego.  Oh, gosh, what was her name?  Van Dam, Danielle van Dam. 
R:  I don't think I remember that one. 
L:  Yeah.  That one was on TV -- I don't know if it was on TV everywhere but at least out here because it's so close it was major news. 
R:  Right.  I wonder if they're going to do anything with the guy that kidnapped that little girl in Utah.
L:  The Smart girl?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm curious to see what happens, you know, because it happened so close to when the war started.  It has -- I think it kind of got put on the back burner.   
R:  That's true. 
L:  I think if all this hadn't been going on, it probably wouldn't have been put so much on the back burner.  I'm -- I'm very curious about it 'cause he seems like a very strange man. 
R:  Oh, I know, it's bizarre, and like just -- and the fact that he managed to drag her up into the hills and -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Like, she didn't res-  you know, and he somehow managed to make her not respond when people were calling for her and she could hear them. 
L:  Yeah.  Well, from what I understand from when I at least heard on the news of course and read in the paper, she -- she was his wife supposedly.  They had, you know, these listed vows and that was it.  [LAUGH] She was led to believe she was his wife. 
R:  That's just so weird. 
L:  I know. 
R:  I could -- I could -- I could just never imagine being in a situation like that even if I were the kid. 
L:  Exactly. 
R:  I mean, I would do, like, anything I could to escape. 
L:  Exactly, and at fifteen years old you're old enough to, you know, you're walking all over the place, you run in somewhere. 
R:  Right, right, exactly. 
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I don't understand how that happened either but I'm very curious to see what --
R:  That one will probably end up being a good candidate to end up on television just because it was so bizarre. 
L:  Very much so.  I -- I mean, it is very bizarre. 
R:  I wonder if people, you know, [COUGH] are watching these things to try and, like, understand for themselves the motivation for what makes people commit crimes or something.  I mean -- 
L:  You know, I -- I don't understand the reasoning for having the trial on TV first.  I mean, I just -- it's not entertainment value and the kind of thing --
