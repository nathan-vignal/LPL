L:  Hi.  I'm name's Rae and I'm in Montana.
R:  Yes, hi, my name's Ken Russell.  I'm in Bellingham, Washington.
L:  Washington?
R:  Yeah, so this is -- you're -- you're a real person somewhere else that I interact with, not a computer.
L:  Yeah, I'm a real person [LAUGH].
R:  And are you a linguistics person?
L:  Ah no, actually, um, this is my second call.  The first one was like a month ago so it -- it surprised me when the phone just rang a few minutes ago.  But, um, no --
R:  Oh, I see, the computer hooks us up.
L:  The computer hooks us up --
R:  I see.
L:  -- and then we talk to each other and they --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I think they -- they gather, um, linguistic information from our calls.
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  That's what it's all about but ... [LAUGH].
R:  Well, the -- way I heard about this was a friend of mine is, uh, a graduate in linguistics.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And she emailed me with this information.  So, I thought, "Oh, well that sounds weird, I'll do that".
L:  Yeah, I'm a mystery shopper and it went around our site that this is a way you can, you know, earn thirty bucks if you wanna talk to strangers on the phone.
R:  A mystery shopper?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Interesting.
L:  Yeah, it's a lot of fun [LAUGH].
R:  All right, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, we're supposed to be talking about exercise today, huh?
R:  Yeah, okay.  I can do that.
L:  Ooh [LAUGH].
R:  Um, I don't do much of it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I have this incredible sedimentary job where I sit in front of a computer for eight hours.
L:  Oh joy [LAUGH].
R:  And, um, actually I get my exercise from kind of gardening.  And also I have a sailboat so I work on the sailboat.
L:  Oh, well that sounds great.  Uh, Washington.  I used to live in Vancouver, Washington.
R:  Oh, really?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My -- actually my mother lives in Vancouver, Washington.
L:  My son was born there and then we moved --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um -- my family lives here in Montana and we're actually moving to Florida in a couple of weeks because we have other family there so ...
R:  Oh my god.
L:  So, we just -- we moved out here, um, right after my son was born and my daughter was born here in Montana and --
R:  Nice.
L:  -- I am -- what I'm twenty three years old and I know I should exercise but, um, I even went down and bought a gym membership and my husband, bless his heart, you know I spent seven hundred dollars for a two year gym membership at the twenty four hour fitness --
R:  Ooh!
L:  -- and I went for like three weeks [LAUGH] and, bless his heart, he hasn't said anything about it [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] but, you -- it's -- it's hard, you know, I mean just finding the time to exercise and --
R:  It's true.
L:  -- and getting it all together and then I'm such a impatient person, you know, I mean, I was -- I was doing the treadmill what for thirty, forty five minutes every day, every day, for three weeks straight.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:   And then I was, um, my Pilates and things like that, you know, and bicycling or whatever and I saw no results.  And I'm so impatient that if I don't see any results like right away I get --
R:  Well -- oh, what're the results you're expecting?  Are you expecting to lose weight or  just --
L:  I was expecting to lose weight.
R:  -- be more buff or ...?
L:  I'm expecting to lose weight and have more energy.  Instead I was --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I was actually gaining weight.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I had no energy [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, it was just like, "Ooh!" [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, right.  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Well, you have to put it in perspective, you have to keep everything in balance.  I mean -- I mean it -- it -- you know, you don't want to overdo too much.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I -- I exercised -- actually I'm not exercising now but like two years ago I went through a period where I went to the Y for a year and exercised three times a day and I -- but I had a schedule where I could do it.  I didn't have to start work till noon and so I'd go every morning to the Y and work out.  And, um, it was great.  I did that for -- literally two to three times a week for a year and, um, it made me feel really good and -- and, um, I felt really strong and th- -- the great thing about the Y is that, um, most of the people -- I'm fifty years old and most of the people there were older than me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so like it made me feel really, you know, young, you know.  And, um -- but then when my job changed again it was like I was working eight to five and so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it was like, you know, I'd get home at five and it was like, "Oh no", you know --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- I wanna eat dinner, you know, kind of mellow out and, of course, I'm so far north in the latitude that it's like -- it's dark in the winter.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Same here in Montana.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It -- it's stays light until ten o'clock --
R:  It's -- you know, Montana --
L:  -- in the summer and then in the winter it's five, you know.
R:  Right, exactly.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and actually Montana, my son worked at, uh, Glacier National Park there.
L:  Oh, did he?
R:  Yeah, which --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and he's going back this year.
L:  Oh yeah, it's -- uh, Glacier's great.  I've only been there two or three times, I think.
R:  Beautiful area.
L:  And --
R:  I went and visited him when he was working there last year and, um, it -- it's very spectacular.
L:  I'm scared of bears [LAUGH] so I am not a good person for the outdoorsy kinds of things.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  My parents --
R:  Well, just stick to the main trails, it's not a big deal.
L:  I know but my --
R:  And -- and the [inaudible] are just like.
L:  -- my mo- -- my parent terrified me the first summer that we came up here, right before we moved up here, um, and -- and they just said, "Oh yeah, there are bears here" [inaudible] like what! [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] and that was enough to scare me.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] I've never seen a bear [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We went to Alaska on our honeymoon, um, last year and, um, we -- we took this, uh, train ride up in the middle, like the Klondyke and, um --
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  -- and we were -- we were on the very back car of the train and then it got all the way up and then it came back down but we didn't turn around.  So, then on the way back down we were the very front.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, um, the -- the -- the attendant in our car said, "You know, up here" he said, "We always see bears up here".  And so he radioed ahead, he says,  "Now, I'll order our favorite bear, sit down here and you've got --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He'd eaten berries along the road and stuff.  So, I'm out here and here I am, I'm total, total tourist, I'm sticking -- um, I'm outside on the deck.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There was like, you know, no walls or anything, it's just open air.  I'm like hanging one foot over trying to seeing the stupid bears --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so I could take a picture of it [LAUGH].  And do you think I saw that bear?  No.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And they were like, "Oh yeah, well he was here like five -- five seconds ago, you missed him". [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, too bad.
L:  [LAUGH] I go to Alaska, I can't even see a bear.
R:  Ah, really?  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, I've had my experience -- I actually have my grandparent's tent which, when I was six in Yellowstone Park, a grizzly bear walked through it.  And so I have this tent which has these huge stitch -- stitch marks in it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Which are grizzly bar- bear made when -- you know it went in and it couldn't get out --
L:  Oh no!
R:  -- and so -- yeah, yeah, so -- but that was -- that's about -- I know I've been camping in the High Sierra actually and the same thing, it's like late at night, it's dark, you know you're thirty miles from the nearest road and it's like you know there are bears around.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's like -- but, you know, not too many people suffer.  It's pretty benign.
L:  Ex- exactly.  My -- my dad is a real outdoorsy kind of guy and he loves Montana.  He, you know, goes hunting every -- every season and I mean he just -- he just has a ball -- ball here and it's funny, I compare my father to -- have you ever seen the Crocodile Hunter that -- that guy that --
R:  Yeah, the Crocodile Dundee guy?
L:  No.  The, um, his name's Steve, he's -- he's Australian but, um, he's the guy that you always see like sticking his head in an alligator or something and, I mean, just totally --
R:  Yes, I know who you mean.
L:  Yeah, he is -- he is crazy.  My father is him [LAUGH].  You know, I mean, he reminds me -- he's like -- he goes, "Yeah, but --" what did he say the other day.  He said something silly like, "Oh yeah, but I would -- I would do it, you know, with a bigger animal" or something to that effect, you know, I mean [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He's -- he's -- he's a riot but --
R:  That he must keep -- yeah, he'd be an interesting person, quite amusing.
L:  He -- he is.
R:  And so you're moving to Florida?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Now, see, I'm interested in Florida because I sail and --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- Florida has this incredible sailing.  I mean it's like the Caribbean, it's warm --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the water's wa- -- if you fall in you don't freeze to death like here in the Northwest.
L:  And you know what's really nice about Florida?  It's -- I know Seattle has like so much rain --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and Florida has almost as much rain but the difference is it's warm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You can go out into the middle of -- of -- you don't want to go out in the middle of a thunderstorm but in a typical rain and it's just -- it's a nice feeling.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I grew up in South Florida and I miss the rain.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  I grew up in South Florida, --
R:  Now, see, I --
L:  -- I spent a few years in Washington, [LAUGH].
R:  I -- I -- I wanna visit the Keys.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Have you ever been out on the Keys?
L:  I have not.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I -- I grew up in, um, near, um, -- I grew up near West Palm Beach.
R:  Uh-huh.  I don't even know where that is but ...
L:  That's north of the Keys.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Everything's north of the Keys [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] everything's north of the Keys.  Everything.
L:  [LAUGH] exactly.
R:  In America, yeah.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  But, um, yeah, no, I've seen, you know, a couple Neo- National Geographic specials --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I've read little travel logs for the Keys and I went, "Oh gosh, you know, it's like Caribbean living in the United States" you know.
L:  Yeah, yeah, it is.
R:  Um --
L:  Florida -- Florida's a beautiful place and it's -- it's --
R:  And I have a friend who goes on business there and he says -- well, he hates it because he works in greenhouses --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and he goes, "Oh, it's always a hundred degrees and a hundred percent humidity" he goes, you know.  But, of course, that's -- he just goes in the summer, I suppose, but --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, um, well, like, the way I remember it is -- is usually -- at least in -- we lived in South Florida, we didn't live Miami South Florida but we lived not too far away from there --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a couple of hours drive.  Um, but, um, it wasn't -- it never -- it rarely got up into the three digits.  It usually was early nineties, late eighties.
R:  I see.
L:  And it was a hundred percent humidity.  It is very sticky.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that was the first thing I noticed.  We moved in the dead of winter, when we moved from Florida to Montana and, um, when I was -- I was like about fifteen or something and, uh, the first thing I bought when we got our foot into Montana was chapstick.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because I just -- my mouth just dried out so bad and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, it never dawned on me what humidity was until you left it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so -- the cold I could handle, it was just the dryness that was so different for me and -- and Montana -- Montana's a very -- very dry heat.  We get up -- we get up to a hundred, a hundred and three, you know --
R:  Oh really?  In the summer, huh?
L:  --  is a typical hot summer and it's so dry and icky, you know.  I -- I --
R:  But then in the winter it's dry too.
L:  The winter it's dry too but it's not as hot.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, definitely not, yeah.
L:  And in the winter, Montana they don't let you know this that, um ...
