L:  Hi, this is John.
R:  Hi, this is Tiffany.  [NOISE]
L:  Hey, Tiffany, how's it going?
R:  It's going fine.  Your name please?
L:  [MN]  I'm John.
R:  John, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I didn't catch that, I sort -- I'm sorry.  [NOISE]
L:  That's all right.  So what are we talking about, censorship in schools, huh?
R:  Censorship in schools, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Sh- sh- should private and public schools have the right to tell kids what they can't read -- can and cannot read?
L:  Well, I think to a certain degree, maybe they should, you know?
R:  Right, I do.
L:  You know, obviously kids aren't necessarily equipped to make those kinds of decisions as to what's appropriate, you know?
R:  Yeah, judgment calls there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Definitely.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I mean, you know, within reason of course.  I mean, you probably wouldn't want the schools to tell your kids like, exactly what they can read or exactly like, what they can't, like religion and stuff and things like that, you know.
R:  Right.  Yeah, I think they -- they can to a point tell them what they can and cannot read but most of the input should come from their parents.
L:  Yeah, absolutely.
R:  Yeah, an-
L:  Their parents should definitely be in charge of that.  And then also it depends on their age too, you know, whether you're talking about like, grade school or -- or high school.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, 'cause by the time they're in high school, you know, maybe they should have a little bit more freedom to check out different things that maybe, you know, at a grade school level they shouldn't, you know?
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But then, you know, who's -- who's to say what's appropriate at high school age, you know?
L:  Well now, that's true too.
R:  [LAUGH]  You know --
L:  Isn't that the problem with society, you know, I mean, where do you draw the line?  And you have to draw the line somewhere.
R:  Exactly.  [SIGH]  And a lot of the times you don't get to draw the line.
L:  Yeah.  Do you have any kids in school?
R:  Yep, I have a six year old and an eight year old.
L:  Oh, I got a six year old and a three year old!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  You're -- you just don't have double duty yet, you just wait!
L:  No, huh, does it get worse when they get older?
R:  Well, the homework does.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  At least -- at least here in -- in our state.
L:  Yeah.  What state is that?
R:  Wisconsin.
L:  Oh, Wisconsin?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I think we're straying a little, I don't know if [LAUGH] we get in trouble for that!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't know if we're supposed to say that either!
L:  Yeah.  But --
R:  Um --
L:  I don't know, my kids, um, actually we're pretty fortunate, the school that my kids -- actually, my six year old is in right now is, you know, they're great, they're really like, informative about what the kids are learning and everything and I think they're very appropriate, so 
R:  Right.
L:  I'm sure to a certain degree that they do censor stuff.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, even like the war in Iraq right now, I mean, they've managed to keep that away from my six year olds for the entire war now, you know, which has been great, I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, they only place, uh, my kids hear about it's at home because my husband has to watch it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Me, it's like, well, it's gonna happen whether I watch it or not, so I'm not watching it, wasting my time.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, me neither.  I'm not one of those people that obsess on that stuff, you know?  You know.
R:  I watch -- you know, I watched when the two towers went down and -- and of course then the kids at school knew something had gone on.
L:  Oh yeah, well, I was, I mean, that's kinda different than war in a sense.  I mean, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I think --
L:  I mean, they're both tragic but 
R:  I think on the war subject we're getting a little, um, [LIPSMACK] how shall we say, too up close and personal?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  And that would be a good thing to censor.  See, we're still --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- talking computer.  [LAUGH]  We're still on censorship.
R:  We're talking censorship, yeah.
L:  Yes.
R:  They should not be playing that, but I, you know --
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, as far as books in the schools, you know, [MN] common sense, common logic.
L:  Yeah.  Like, I remember they had, I think, tried to ban Catcher In The Rye.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause there was like, a racy page in it or something.  I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- something like that, I don't necessarily agree with.
R:  Yeah.  Well, Thorn Birds had, what, three pages in it that was that way?
L:  Yeah -- oh, I don't even know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, it's like, you know.  But then again, I mean, there's a difference between something that might be considered classical or decent and then something that might be like, downright pornographic, you know.
R:  Right.  Oh yeah, I'd -- I'm a firm believer in no porno.
L:  Oh yeah, me neither.
R:  None.  No none -- no skin, no nothing!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Exactly.
R:  Be a kid!  [LAUGH]
L:  That's true, you know.  And -- but then again, there is also that point that you have brought up that, where do you draw the line, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  W- where can you say, "Okay, well, is an ankle okay?  Well how about like, a leg?" you know?  And 
R:  Yeah.  And then, how high up o- on a leg, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And mini skirts and the short shorts and, you know.
L:  Yeah.  I don't even have cable in my house for that very reason.  I can't even deal with that stuff and my kids are already starting to get older and I don't need them to be [LIPSMACK] you know.
R:  Influenced.
L:  H- h- America, who's gonna, you know, choose whoever's wife or husband or whatever?  I can't even --
R:  Oh, that is so stupid!
L:  [SIGH]  Tell me about it, you know.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Joe Millionaire?
R:  Yeah.  You could get a life!  [LAUGH]
L:  Like, what -- [LAUGH] I know, totally, what a bunch of junk, you know!
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, definitely.
L:  So I'm pretty glad they don't show that kind of stuff in school you know, as far as 
R:  [MN]  Right.
L:  That sort of media goes, I guess.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Some of the, well, my daughter's so far been pretty good about what kind of books she wants to read and -- and, um, you know, what -- what topics they are, and -- and they're pretty -- pretty much ol- age appropriate.  Some of them are geared more towards pre teen and early teen.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And of course most of her people that she knows are pre teen, early teens, so that's why she, I think, is attracted to those kind of books.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And [SIGH] the teachers -- I should say our classroom teachers for these two have been pretty good on the books that they send home.
L:  Well that's good.
R:  And what not.  Um, yeah.
L:  So I'm w-
R:  So far I'd have to say they've -- they're doing an okay job!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  My kids are so uncomplicated, it's so nice right now, you know?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  First grade and pre school!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Everybody tells me it gets harder, you know.
R:  Yeah, it does.  And everybody keeps telling me it's gonna get harder than what it is and it's like, can it really?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, you know 
R:  Gotta teach 'em firm values now and -- and --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you know, they don't see Mom and Dad reading inappropriate material so then they don't have the urge to read or see inappropriate material.
L:  Yeah.  That's the one thing I try to really do with my kids, is we spend a lot of time reading the bible and we go to church a lot and try to instill those kind of values because it's so hard to fight [inaudible] that's like, just overwhelms, you know?
R:  Yeah, it is.  Yeah.  I am trying to get a firmer grip on, um, religion and church, uh, with my children.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They don't know the stories like I used to, because I went to Sunday school and 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I grew up in a small town about seven hundred people.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  You know.  And now we're living in a town of over three thousand people.   And umpteen different churches to pick from --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and everybody has their own different way of doing 
L:  True.
R:  Church.
L:  Everybody does have their own beliefs, you know.
R:  Yeah, and it's like, I haven't found my belief, or maybe my belief isn't correct.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  -- to me, you know, and not to totally stray at all, but th- you have to ask yourself if you believe in Jesus.
R:  Right.
L:  And then if you do believe in Jesus then you have to decide to try to find a church that is as close to how he taught as possible.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  Like, a lot of churches, they say they believe in Jesus but then they do their own thing and stuff.  And that would be the only thing I could really speak intelligently about, you know?
R:  Yeah!  [LAUGH]  Exactly.
L:  You know.  So, I don't know, just check it out and, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Because then I would get appropriate material there --
L:  Yeah, oh, absolutely.
R:  -- as far as adults giving younger people appropriate material.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, like the other day they learned a nice story and -- and, uh, my daughter wanted to take her daily little -- daily reading bibles to school.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  She wanted Tyler, her sis- her brother, to take it to school for their book read day.  And I really hesitated on sending it to school --
L:  You know --
R:  -- because of all the problems that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- are going on.  And I finally just said, "Take it" you know.
L:  We did the same exact thing with C.J.  He's been wanting to bring his bible to school and -- he's actually my stepson.
R:  Uh huh.
L:  So I was like, "Okay, you know what, you can bring it to school, it's okay because you're not like, distributing materials at school, you know, so you should be allowed to bring your own bible if you want".
R:  Right.
L:  And his father kinda got a little upset like, "Well, I don't think the school would allow to have a bible in there" and "I don't know" and, you know.  So it was kind of a touchy thing.  But I think that as far as censorship goes, if a student wants to bring a bible and read it during a free time or something, I don't see a problem with that, you know?
R:  No, I don't either.  I -- I, um, I would encourage it.
L:  Well, yeah!  [LAUGH]
R:  You know --
L:  You know.
R:  -- they ought to get the bible and -- and God back in there.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  There doesn't have to be one religion or another.
L:  Yeah, well, you've -- you gotta figure -- our country was definitely founded on christians and a belief of God.
R:  Right.
L:  There's absolutely no denying that and for them to try to say, "You can't say God in the pledge of allegiance --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- in school", that that might be considered unconstitutional is just horrendous to me.
R:  Yeah, it is.  [COUGH]
L:  You know, we are --
R:  And then --
L:  -- one nation under God and there maybe some of them are muslim or whatever, but we were founded on it.  And our money even says, "In God we trust".
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  So 
R:  You know, and there -- there for the censorship part of it, um, you know, we wouldn't have the problem with censorship [LAUGH] if they just do it the right way the first time!
L:  It's true, you know, and then all these people like, you know, for instance all the people with the pornography on the internet are hiding behind censorship, that they have some sort of a right to shove this junk down our throats.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  And all these pob[?] dobs[?] and all this stuff.  And, you know, I -- I don't know, to me -- we do have draw a line somewhere but I think that common sense is a good place to start, you know, not a bunch of, you know, litigation or whatever, "Oh, well, if you say this then it applies to this and that" I mean, just common sense and not making it too complicated.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  And then you have someone say, "Well, [LIPSMACK] whose common sense is the right common sense?"
L:  Yeah.  Well 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There's always going to be somebody stirring it up I guess, you know?
R:  Yeah, they -- one of these deta- it takes all kinds to make the world go around.
L:  That's true.
R:  That's what I keep telling my kids!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And it's just -- it's kinda
