R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  My name is Lisa.
L:  Yes, my name is Olive.
R:  Hi, I'm sorry, what is it?
L:  How are you?  Olive?  Like in olive oil.
R:  Oh, Olive, okay.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Have you done this before?
L:  Once.
R:  Oh, this is my first one [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, okay [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  So, we're supposed to talk about if we do, um, [MN].
L:  Our daily exercising?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, well, I'm a student and I don't really have time for formal exercise but I just, um, I walk everywhere and walk all over campus so, I guess, I don't take care of myself as much in that way --
L:  Well, col- --
R:  -- as I used to.
L:   -- college students do do a lot of walking though [LAUGH].  And they're --
R:  Yeah, they do.
L:  -- carrying heavy books.
R:  Yeah, I know but that almost hurts my back sometimes  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh my.
R:  I'm actually going back to school so I'm not like as resilient as I used to be.
L:  Oh, I see what you're saying, yes.
R:  And what about you, do you do like a regular regimen or ...?
L:  I'm trying to get into a -- um, I kinda get a little bit lack in the winter time but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, we -- we just recently got a Y membership and --
R:  Oh good, yeah.
L:  -- um, I'm trying to get a -- I'm trying to figure out a regular time that I can just carve out of my schedule to go and, um, and work out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then I walk with my husband quite a bit, you know, in the --
R:  Is it pretty close to your --
L:  -- in the evening.
R:  -- house, the Y?
L:  Well, I -- I wish it was closer.  It's probably about a -- maybe a twelve minute drive.
R:  Yeah, that -- that --
L:  You know if I could just go around the corner it'd be better -- it'd be different [LAUGH].
R:  Oh yeah.  I used to, before I started school again, I used to have -- there was a fitness club right around the corner from my place and I used to go there all the time and now ...
L:  Yeah, I know.  I have a Bally membership too.
R:  Oh.
L:  But just for myself --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but the Y is for the family and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and the Bally's -- the Bally's membership is -- the club is just -- it really is too far away to pa- 
R:  Yeah.
L:   -- you know to work into the schedule well.
R:  Yeah.  Is that just for women?
L:  No.
R:  That one or ...?
L:  No it's for men too.
R:  Oh, oh.  But the Y is good 'cause it has sports and stuff everything too.
L:  Well, it's just cheaper.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, my fam- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my boys wanted to get it and my husband was willing to pay for it so, um, and I had gotten the ballet membership some time ago so -- and they weren't interested in paying all that.  
R:  Yes.
L:  I -- I got my ballet membership from another person --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I only paid like a couple of hundred dollars for it.
R:  Oh that's good.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah
L:   But, uh, but the Y -- the Y is a lot cheaper.
R:  I think it's good -- does your husband do it with you too?  Does he -- oh, you walk together you said.
L:  Well, we walk together, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But, no, we both need to exercise more than we do there's no question about it.
R:  Oh my gosh, so do I.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My boyfriend and I, uh, that's the thing if he would do it with me I think I would have more -- yeah, I would have more --
L:  More initiative.
R:  -- initiative, yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Yes, I agree.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It helps when you do things together, it really does.
R:  It really does and then you can sort of encourage each other and --
L:   Yeah, yeah.
R:  But, uh, both of us --
L:  That's really true.
R:  -- we're gone all day, you know, I just walk around all day and come home and just -- all I wanna do is sit [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, well and the by the time you study you probably -- you are having to sit.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And it seems like computers have added --
R:  I know.
L:  -- a lot of pounds to Americans.
R:  I think so.  Yeah, definitely.
L:  You just spend so time sitting in front of them.
R:  Yeah.  Do you have any pets or anything that you can take for walks or ...?
L:  You know, um, not now.  We do have a dog but he belongs to a boy that is rooming with us so he's the one that takes him on walks.  I guess I could, I hadn't thought of that actually.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Since it's nice weather now, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh --
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's a good idea.  Actually I should -- I should definitely consider that.
R:  We just have two cats so ... [LAUGH]
L:  The -- the dog would definitely appreciate it [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh --
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:   Do you ever do any kind of sports or anything or have you ever belonged to a team or anything like that?  Have you done any organized sports?
L:  No, not really.
R:  No?
L:  No. When I was in high school I, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I did what they did in gym class and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, you know, when the young people in our church got together, you know, we played volleyball and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- softball sometimes, stuff like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, no, I never really was a big -- a big sports person.
R:  Me either, that's kind of interesting.  Both have the same kind of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- attitude, I think.  [LAUGH] I was on a softball team once and that was enough for me [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- when I was a kid, yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  I used to play soccer and those things but we never --
L:  Well, my daughter did cross country for a year or so but --
R:  Oh yeah?
L:  -- she got tired of it too.
R:  I just wasn't even really raised in a real sports oriented family either so maybe that was part of it, I don't know.
L:  Yeah, that could be.
R:  So, I just don't think I've got a --
L:  Yeah, we don't -- I mean, I have plenty of -- plenty -- I mean I've got five sons and they're all --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- pretty -- pretty active and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, in shape and stuff like that and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they love to rollerblade, that's one thing they do a lot of in the summer --
R:  Oh wow.
L:  -- is they love -- the like to go downtown to Chicago, uh, to the lake front --
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  -- and they rollerblade all over the lake front.
R:  Wow.
L:  But -- and they're pretty fast.  But, uh --
R:  Yeah, that's really good for you.
L:  It's very good for you.  Oh, and I did enjoy ice skating.  I haven't been ice skating --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for several years now but I did really enjoy ice skating when I was younger but -- but as far as keeping up the sports teams and stuff like that, no --
R:  Uh-huh
L:  -- we really don't.
R:  No.
L:  Different one Michael Jordan who was one he would win -- win something then we would pay attention for a few minutes and that was it [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] I guess so, yeah, I mean -- [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, yeah, that was several years ago now so --
R:  Yeah, we do a lot of watching sports here  [LAUGH] in this household [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm, mhm.  We don't even do -- really do much of that --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- actually.  Just, you know, here and there but not --
R:  We watch baseball and hockey, are the big ones so ...
L:  Which one?
R:  Baseball and hockey and then sometimes soccer if we can get it.
L:  Oh, I see.  Where -- where are you from?
R:  I'm from Seattle.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And my boyfriend is from, oh, Czechoslovakia actually.
L:  Oh my!  Oh my, I'm impressed.
R:  Yeah and, um, so he's a big soccer fan and --
L:  Oh, that's neat.
R:  -- hockey fan and all that stuff.  So, he's got me interested in that but not playing though! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, that doesn't really do much for us.
L:  I have a sister from Wolamar[?].
R:  Oh really?
L:  Mhm.  
R:  That's on the other side.
L:  So, I used go out there every --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- every so often and we have a lot of friends at the [inaudible] in Seattle.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'm from Annshevava[?], Chicago.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  So.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, was it rainy today in Seattle?
R:  No, it was beautiful today.
L:  Really?  Oh, that's good.
R:  We've had beautiful weather.  We've had a lot of rain but today was nice, the cherry trees are just moving their petals now and --
L:  Really.
R:  -- there's still a few other flowering trees so --
L:  Wow.
R:  It's getting nicer actually to walk outside so maybe I will be doing some more [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Well now, tell me, are the leaves on the trees yet?
R:  They're just --
L:  Or do they bloom first?
R:  Um, they -- let's see, I never thought of it that way.  I think the blooms come first or maybe the leaves are smaller or something and I don't notice them. 
L:  Mhm, don't notice them.
R:  I never thought of that.  No, but they're just starting to fall now, the petals and --
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  What's it like over there now?  It's sort of --
L:  Well, it's -- we've had some nice days and we've had some cold days and then we had snow and then we had more nice days.
R:  You had snow?  Recently?
L:  Yeah, we did about, um, I don't know, a week or so ago.
R:  Oh, I did think I hear about that on the news.
L:  Amazingly enough.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, we had, I don't know, several inches but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it actually lasted about three days or so.
R:  Has that ever -- ever happened?  Is that often in April in that area?
L:  Yeah, we can get snow in April.
R:  Yeah?
L:  That's not impossible by any means.
R:  Oh my god.
L:  No.  I know. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But now you guys are you more temperate than that?
R:  Yeah, we don't get -- it actually kinda drives some people crazy because it's -- it's just sort of gray and rainy all winter.  And it's not really cold and it's not really hot but it -- I think it makes people kind of --
L:  Depressed.
R:  You know, they get bored, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I was mostly raised here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I'm kinda used to it but, um, when the sun does shine you realize  --
L:  How nice it is.
R:  -- how much you missed it.  Yeah.
L:  Yes.
R:  And so it's -- it's, uh --
L:  Yeah, that's really true.  I really appreciate the sunshine.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  And --
L:  And your -- your spirits are raised immediately.
R:  Definitely.  You feel like you can do much more and you have more energy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Almost -- almost like --
L:  Yeah, you're happier.
R:  Almost wanna go walking every night [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Hey, that's back to the subject here [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] No, I don't even know how much we supposed to stick to the subject or if they're --
L:  I don't think it matters [LAUGH].
R:  -- just trying to give us, uh -- give us a topic to talk about so that we'll talk --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or if it's a topic that they really want us to talk about that particular thing, I don't know.
L:  Yeah, I don't think it matters either.
R:  Oh well, that's good.
L:  But, uh --
R:  Because I can talk.  I can just talk [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  So, actually what they're doing is they're just taking all the participants and matching them up?
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh.
L:  Is that what they're doing?
R:  Yeah, I guess so.  I mean when I -- I got the phone call and the computer asked me if I would want to do it now and I said, "Yes" and then I was on hold for a while while they looked for you, I guess.
L:  I see.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, that happened to me the first time I was on hold for a while.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I was thinking that I was talking to someone who was hired to do this.  But, I guess, what they're doin- -- just doing is having the participants talk among each other --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then among themselves --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then just recording it probably.
R:  Probably.  I'm -- no, they are recording it for sure.
L:  Oh, I would assume so.
R:  Yeah.  How did you find out about it?
L:  On the Internet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I, um -- let's see how did I get this, speech study.  I think -- I'm a mystery shopper too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think it, uh, came through on some of the information about the mystery shopping on some of the message boards.
R:  Oh, well I don't know what that is --
L:  I think that's where it came from.
R:  -- what mystery shopping is.  I don't what that is.
L:  Mystery shopping is basically where you, um, you'll go -- you'll get an assignment like maybe go to a Burger King or go to a, um, a pet store or a clothing store, or whatever, restaurant or something and --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- um, you are a shopper.  You sho- -- you buy--
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then you fill out a form about, you know, what did they say to you and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what was the person wearing and, um, uh, did they try to upsell you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and how clean was the bathroom and that kind of thing.
R:  I know and how that you mention that I have heard of that, yes.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  So, I do that --
R:  So, um --
L:  -- and, I think, that's probably how I heard.  How'd you hear about it?
R:  Oh, I'm in the -- I'm -- my department at school is -- I'm in Linguistics and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- uh, a girl -- a girl in our department, another -- a fellow student of mine, she heard about it through, I'm not sure, maybe even the -- I'm not sure how she heard about it but it is sort of linguistically related, I guess and --
L:  Oh, it would be.  Yeah.
R:  -- with, uh, voice -- maybe voice recognition stuff --
L:  I see.  Interesting
R:  -- and, uh, and she was just saying, "Hey, here's a way you can make ten bucks for a phone call".
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm like, "Hey, I like to talk on the phone" so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I -- it's easy, I mean it's easy money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then they said that some people -- there'd be three for everybody and then some people they would pick to do like twenty -- twenty, twenty five.
R:  Yeah, that's right.  It had the ...
