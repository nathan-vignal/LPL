L:  Hi, my name is Dave Coates.
R:  Hi, I'm Laurie.
L:  Hi, Laurie.
R:  Hi.
L:  [LAUGH] Have you done this before?
R:  Um, I did it once before.  I actually didn't realize that I was calling in to do it.  I -- I thought I was calling in to, ah, to change my, ah, time slot. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  But, um, you know, I figured I'm driving home from work so I might as well just talk.
L:  Yeah.  [COUGH] They just did the same one a little while ago with me.
R:  Oh? 
L:  Same exact survey. 
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  I don't know if they do it three times in a row for the same survey, see if they get different answers or what's going on.  This is -- 
R:  Ah.
L:  -- this is the first time I've ever done this too, so. 
R:  Okay.
L:  Anyway, censorship of books in school, [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  [MN] 
L:  I agree to a point that, ah, some books should be censored, um, but not all.
R:  What -- what -- what instances do you think that they should be censored?  I mean, censored for what reason?
L:  Well, like, ah, pornographic books and -- 
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- you know, there's a lot of that stuff that they have access to in libraries -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that, ah, students shouldn't be allowed to get to.  Um, I don't know too much about, ah, all the books that are out there but, you know, what they're talking about, what kinds. [COUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I -- I don't know.  Um, I mean, just censorship as far as what is on an approved reading list or what they carry in the library? I don't -- I mean -- um, -- 
L:  Well, it sounds like what they're talking about is whatever they feel that they want to censor, they censors.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and I guess that's the question they're asking us, if we feel that they should have that right to censor books at [NOISE] --  at will.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I mean, I guess they, you know, should be able to censor for, you know, like you said, pornographic reasons or -- but then, you know, again, who's to say what's pornographic and what's not? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, what's pornographic and what's a, you know, literary classic, you know, -- 
L:  Well --
R:  -- I don't know, I mean, it seems like, you know, the instances you read in the news where they're trying to censor books always seems for an illogical reason.  I mean, you know, schools that censor things like, you know, Tom Sawyer or Huckleberry Finn -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I never understood that, um. 
L:  I think a lot of it depends on, you know, what age the kids are.
R:  Yeah, um, [PAUSE] yeah, I mean that's -- that's true.  Um, I don't know, I guess, you know, like, public schools should just have public [inaudible] and private, I mean, usually there's just certain books that, you know, just year after year the students are required to read and, um, I don't know ...  I've never, you know, personally had any experience with censorship of books, you know.  I mean, it -- it was never an issue when I was in school as far as, you know, not being allowed to read certain books.
L:  Yeah, I didn't have that problem either, um, that's a whole different generation or two. [COUGH] Um, I don't know, you know, there's a lot of stuff that's too graphic.  I don't really think that young kids should be able to, you know, have access to it, um, actually pornographic material, anything --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's not, ah, appropriate for kids to read.  If you wouldn't let them read it at home, then I don't think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't feel that they should be able to read it.
R:  You wouldn't want them reading it in school, yeah.  [PAUSE]
L:  [MN] Are you still there? 
R:  Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm driving, trying to not to get killed.  Um, yeah, I mean, I -- I agree with that, you know, if you don't -- if a parent wouldn't want them reading it in the home, certainly they wouldn't want them reading it in the school.  Um, [NOISE]  I mean, it -- it -- some of it has just got to be common sense, you know, I mean, what's appropriate for what age group.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I mean, some of it just seems so, you know, common sensical --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  But, um, I don't know.
L:  Yeah, I don't know.  It's, ah, --  it's hard to really know what kind of books they're talking about.  You know, if there was examples, and you've read them yourself, you'd know, "No, I don't want my kid to read that" or, um, "I think that's okay".
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, ah. Um. [PAUSE] [COUGH] 
R:  I don't know.  I mean, it -- it seems like, you know, parents should be able to control what their, you know, kids are reading and, I don't know, maybe, um, you know, at the school, you know, ah, have the parents play a more active role and -- and get their input, you know, maybe it wouldn't be such a problem in some areas.
L:  Yeah.  [COUGH] I don't know.  There's -- [NOISE] I say there's a whole spectrum of books out there that, ah, I'm sure are not appropriate for children.  I still don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- want to -- school has the right, um, to censor them, but I guess what --
R:  Yeah, I mean, I don't know if, you know, well what kind of context they mean.  I mean, censor in -- in respect to you're not having them in the school library or censoring or, you know, not part of a class curriculum.  I mean, I don't -- you know, it's hard to censor a public library, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and in --  in that sense, you know, as far as what books children read from the public library, you know, that's a -- that's the responsibility I think of the parent to, you know, decide what's appropriate for the, you know, the child to be allowed to take out of the library, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, you know, maybe children of a certain age, you know, when they check out a book from the library, they should, you know, need to be accompanied by their parent too, you know, so the parent's aware that they're checking out whatever content book they've chosen.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, my gosh, so, you know, just like they do at the movies, you know, PG rated or whatever, you have to -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- be a certain age to get those books from the library, but, um, I don't know. [NOISE] [PAUSE] You know, it's --  it's a tough one.  Actually you're not there all day long to monitor what they read, um --
R:  Yeah.  I don't know, and in one sense, I mean, at least they're reading, you know, [MN] I mean, it -- it's -- it's an actual book and they're actually reading instead of, like, sitting in front of the TV.  I mean, I know there's a lot of -- you know, garbage out there, you know, and the content of books are bad but, you know -- 
L:  [COUGH] Yeah, it's -- there's a lot of -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it that they can get into. 
R:  Yeah.  But even, you know, I think reading a violent book, you know, better than sitting in front of the TV and watching something violent.  At least you're coming -- using your brain a little more by reading.
L:  Yeah.
R:  At least they're kind of, you know, kind of developing more by, you know, reading than sitting on the couch watching something.  I don't know.  I mean, I'm kind of going on a tangent.
L:  [LAUGH] That's all right.
R:  Ah.
L:  It helps get rid of that ten minutes. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know, I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, you never realize how long ten minutes really is.
L:  Yeah, I know it, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] What part of the world are you in? 
R:  Ah, Chicago. 
L:  Chicago, we're on the other side, in Oregon.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah.  How's the weather in Oregon?
L:  Yeah, it's -- right at this particular moment the sun is shining but it wasn't five minutes ago.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] We had two really beautiful days.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, Monday and Tuesday were, just like uncharacteristically beautiful and now it's cold again.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Anyway, I guess we should talk about these books.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, --
