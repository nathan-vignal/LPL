R:  Tiffany.
L:  Billy. [NOISE] [PAUSE] I don't know what we're supposed to do.
R:  I don't either. [LAUGH] 
L:  Good, that's two of us.  Are we supposed to discuss the topic?
R:  Ah, I guess possibly.  Um. 
L:  Would you like to go first? 
R:  Sure.
L:  Okay.
R:  I -- I feel that the children should be able to read, um, a vast majority of the items that they would like to read, ah, things that are, like, rated -- rated R and -- and items like that I don't believe should be there.  Um, I especially feel that if they want to read the bible in school they should be able to.
L:  Well, do you feel that because about what it sounded like the question was, do you feel like you -- your child, or -- or, if you don't have children, your sister, brother, whoever's children should have to read whatever they put in front of 'em because it sounded like they -- they're asking also the possibility of if we want your children to read, ah, like they were doing up in Carolina said that reading this -- the -- the -- what was it -- the, ah, scriptures of the Muslims -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  The Koran I believe it is.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They were going to make that part of the curriculum and they will have to do it.  Do you feel like that they should be able to tell you what they have to read, especially when they're children or do you think that it should be more the parent in -- I mean, the parent should have some input, should be able to say, "Look, if I don't want my children subjected to this, that should be my right"? 
R:  Exactly.  
L:  Good.
R:  I think the parent should have -- have, more say so over it.
L:  Mhm.  I don't think the parent should be able to go in and get somebody fired because they don't want to do the same thing.  But in the same, ah, same situation, I don't think that the schools or the teachers have the [inaudible] force anybody to do something that they shouldn't -- that they don't want to do.
R:  That's true.
L:  I also kind of feel that, ah, that they don't [inaudible] our people enough input on this.  I mean, because I know when there were kids here, we never got a month, a month criteria of saying what was going to be subjected, what the kids were going to be subjected to -- to, you know, be able to have any input, you know, I mean, I know there's so much to do trying to teach children and so much to try and run a school and a classroom they really don't have the time to put everything on the plate in front of parents, but I think they ought to have some type of gathering other than the PTA where the parents, if they wanted to, could go and find out what their kids were going to have put in front of 'em.
R:  Right, but then what happens when they deviate from the curriculum, you know, for unforeseen circumstances or something?
L:  Well --
R:  You know.
L:  -- I mean, it -- to me it falls back like when I -- I was a kid in school.  If you had a -- a religious preference not to want to cut the frog up, you didn't have to.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You know, I mean, it's -- it's gone from the way out, I mean, 'cause I know age doesn't matter but I'm, um, early forties and, ah, when I -- even back then when I went to school, if you -- if you said that you really didn't want to do it for that reason, you really weren't forced, you weren't penalized for it.  You had to do some other yin yang, whatever, 'cause I know there was a couple of little girls that got out of doing it by that method.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, um, I mean, I don't fault 'em for it.  I mean, and whatever method they wanted to do but, ah, you know, I --  I don't think -- I think there should be some way to make 'em still get the educational values out of it but, you -- you know, I don't know, I just -- I feel like they're trying to -- they're forcing people into, um, exploring avenues that they really don't -- they don't care about.  They have a hard enough time dealing with their every day life with the -- the things that they, you know, need to do and need to take care of. 
R:  Yeah, have to do in school.  Well, how come then so many parents are opting for home schooling?
L:  Well, now, that helps -- that -- the -- I feel like the reason why they're doing that is because of, um, it gives, ah, -- whichever male or female parent that's -- that's getting to stay at home -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it gives them more of a feeling of fulfillment.  I mean, because just being there and running a household, that kind of bites --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But if you're not there, then your child's a latch door or whatever they -- pass key kid.
R:  Latch key.
L:  Yeah, and, ah, then -- then the child doesn't have the supervision during those hours when -- when you can't get away from the job yet or you miss those holidays because of it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- I don't know.  I mean, because I know there was a guy in the neighbourhood right up the street and he worked at IBM and he managed to go ahead and -- and retire from IBM when his little girl started out in kindergarten and, um, he was at the school and acting like a -- a -- a -- God, what did they used to call them?  
R:  [MN] 
L:  Um, I don't know, the parent -- when a parent went out like a teacher's assistant but, ah, he was like that and I thought "Well", you know, "That's got -- that's got to be great", but then when I started hearing about him wanting to impose his ideas and, you know, get the kids to do the way he wanted to, I started thinking to myself, "Wait a minute, now, I think the teacher needs to be there".  You know, because right now it's just like, you know, I mean, if you send your kid over to your neighbor's house to play, you kind of give them the authority to, you know, say, "Look, don't play with my kids, do play with my kid".  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, whatever you do, you have given them that -- that okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Who are these parents walking off the street?  They don't -- they don't go to school to be educators.  They don't have to, you know, they just -- they walk in the door and they go "Hey, look at me.  How do you like the way I'm dressed?  I think I'd like to help out in the classroom, I'd like to help out in the gym, I'd like to help out in the library".  I don't know, it kind of got -- I was like wow.
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  All that kind of worked itself out but nowadays you hear so many, um, things --
R:  Weird things, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  You don't know if -- if, I don't know, you can't -- there can't be enough watchful eyes on children.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Caring, watchful eyes, there can't be.  And, I mean, I just -- I have a hard time when I -- I received questions saying, "Do you believe in, um, ah, conservative values or rebel values"?  And I think to myself, "Well, there are parts that -- there are parts".
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, and -- and there are some things that are just -- that just make sense no matter if you're liberal or conservative and it rolls back to that same thing about the -- about the classrooms and the -- and the teaching.  I mean, as long as they put enough of a twist on it, where they can say, "Look, this can be looked at in two different ways", you -- it's -- it's -- it's up to you to draw out of it what you're going to get.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, but I'm -- I'm worried that, you know, some [NOISE] -- some nut can get in there and -- and say, "Okay, well, we're going to start -- we're going to start studying satan because back during medieval times", you know, like wow, coming across that in your kid's homework.
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] yeah, that's not a -- not a good thing, no.  Um, I [SIGH] feel that a lot of people that -- well, the ones that can afford to do so and have the luxury of it I should say, are opting for home schooling.  I mean, there is a curriculum you have to follow.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  There are tests that have to be submitted.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, it is state governed.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, kids that just can't make it in the school system, you know, for one reason or another, say they're maybe ADHD or, you know, some type of learning disability or the parents don't agree with what the public school is teaching them and that type of thing, you know, what do you do?  You -- you -- [MN] you don't want to keep sending them some place where you know they're not receiving what they need, what you feel they need.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, um, such as reading these books and that book and what not, you know. [MN]
L:  Mhm.
R:  They don't do things like I had back in my school.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I'm mid thirties.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And math, my kids come home with math nowadays and it's like, I haven't a clue. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "Go call your friend", [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Mm, yeah.  These are --  these are preteens. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, it's -- it's an eight year old.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  It's like my husband, he definitely doesn't want to help with homework because he can't, he doesn't understand it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and then Mom has to do it all, but -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  I try.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So my -- my son has challenges and the teachers are saying, you know, that he's just sitting there and not learning and not wanting to do anything.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Well, he's young, you know, give him time. [MN] Forcing him is not going to help him get to doing it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, reading any faster, writing any faster, learning his spelling words, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It just doesn't happen.
L:  Mhm, yeah.  Well, that is where home schooling really would help out a lot because you can -- you can turn it into more of a game and have it on a reward system and, you know, just so many other avenues that you can explore that they can't do in school.  But, um, when it comes to what they're going to study --
