L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Yeah, hi, my name is Ita.
R:  Hi, my name is Rona.
L:  Hi, Rona, how are you?
R:  I am fine thanks, how are you?
L:  I’m doing real good, thank you.  I’m in the middle of making dinner so …  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!  And I’m in the middle of, uh, I’m at home sick today so I’m in the middle of making a cup a tea!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Where are you’ve located?
R:  I’m in Santa Monica, California.
L:  In California.  I’m in Illinois.  Jerry, come on, please.
R:  Oh, very good.
L:  So, um --
R:  Yeah I [several inaudible words].
L:  -- is this your first or second call?
R:  P- uh, this is my second call.  I was -- I was wondering if I was going to get a second call --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because it’s been probably three weeks --
L:  Right, right, same here.
R:  -- since the first call.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, same here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So what do we have to talk about?
R:  I’m -- now, I -- I -- yeah, I didn’t understand the topic.  I -- I --
L:  I think we have to talk about, uh, if sch- first it was about censorship, I think, and then they said, um, “Well, within this topic”.  I had real time getting at odds with, “If the schools should allow or disallow certain books for students to read”.  Is that what you heard?
R:  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Something about that.
L:  Okay.  At least [LAUGH] because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I wasn’t sure either.  It was so fast and so mechanical that I thought, “My God, what did he say?”
R:  Yeah.  That’s a very strange topic too, because I don’t really know, you know, I’ve never really thought about, um, you know, censorship in books and schools.
L:  Yeah.  That doesn’t really matter --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because we can just say whatever we feel about it.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  Right?
R:  -- um, that’s fine, yeah.  Um, well, I don’t know, do you wanna start or do you want me to start?
L:  Well, I don’t care.  Well, I can start if you want to.
R:  Yeah, that’s fine.
L:  Well, I really don’t -- I absolutely do not believe in censorship.  See, I am German and I, uh, still remember times when, you know, my parents telling me what happened during certain times in Germany, like the Third Reich.
R:  Mhm.
L:  When everything was censored and books were burned.  And I’m absolutely against any kind of censorship, wherever it happens, you know, the school or public life or private life.  So I’m absolutely against it.  So this is my take on it.
R:  Oh, very good.  Well, I have to agree with you.  I -- I also don’t believe in censorship.  I think that, um, public schools and private schools, um, you know, schoolchildren have a right to know about everything that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- goes on in the world.  I don’t think --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- that anything should be censored.  Yeah.  And I feel that the media tries to censor a lot.
L:  Yes, I -- I feel that also.
R:  And I, you know … yeah.  So, you know --
L:  Especially in the United States.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They only, um, they only broadcast what they want us to hear.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And [LAUGH] --
L:  I absolutely agree with you, because, you know, I know it from different sides of the, uh, of the Atlantic now, and I know that is true, because the different countries -- our countries handle this differently.  And the United States is one of the countries that really censors the news.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And it censors the schools.  And I don’t believe that -- as, you know, just as you say, children should know everything, they should have access to everything.  It doesn’t mean they have to read it or to like it or -- they -- but they should have the possibility at least.
R:  Right, right.  Well, you know, the -- the --
L:  Do you have children?
R:  Yeah, I have two children.  I have two very young children.  One of them is six and the other one is eight.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, you know they haven’t really started learning about, um, you know, history, yet.
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, when they start to learn about history I want them to learn about not just American history but world history.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I’d like them to learn about, you know, all the horrible things, atrocities, that happened.
L:  Right.  And are still happening, right.
R:  Yeah, and that are still happening.  You know, I don’t think that anything should be, um, kept from them.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I -- I feel that maybe we would be a better world, now, um, you know, if people were made aware --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when they were younger of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, what -- what human beings do to each other.
L:  Right.  I think it’s -- that’s  --
R:  So --
L:  -- the point, the awareness, you know, you have to be aware.  And once you are aware you -- you -- you live your life differently.
R:  That’s right, yeah.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  You definitely do, yeah.  I feel very fortunate to, you know, to have a lot of, um, different, um, different, um, medias, you know, coming through my -- my computer at work.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I -- I sign -- I’ve signed on to a lot of different types of newspapers like, a British newspaper --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- an Australian newspaper, because I like --
L:  I do that also, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I -- I like to see what other countries, um, you know, talk about --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in their --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in their, um, their media.  Yeah.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I -- I’m all against censorship.
L:  What kind of work do you do?
R:  I -- I work for Fedex.  I work [MN] --
L:  Oh, you work for Fedex, okay.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, yeah.  I’ve been with the company for about thirteen years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I actually was with t- you know Flying Tigers?  Have you heard of Flying Tigers?
L:  No, I don’t know them.
R:  Flying Tigers used to be a, um, was a cargo carrier, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it was started during World War -- I think it was world war one, um, or maybe at the end of world war two.
L:  Mm.
R:  And it was started by some American, um, American servicemen.
L:  Oh really?
R:  And it grew.  It was -- it started in Japan, yeah, during the Korean war.
L:  Oh.
R:  And it grew to be the, um, world’s largest cargo carrier and then they -- Fedex purchased us in, um, nineteen eighty nine.
L:  Oh really?  I never heard about that.  Mm.
R:  Yeah.  We used to fly, um, [LIPSMACK] we used to fly -- excuse me, I’m eating an orange.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um -- [LAUGH]
L:  I am making a pizza, I just, you know, I handed the same to my husband when it’s done.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, we, um, used to fly, uh, military troops to --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- different, um, installations and --
L:  You see, I wouldn’t know anything about that, you know?
R:  Mm.
L:  Right.
R:  We used to fly to Germany.   And w- we used to fly orphans from Vietnam, during the Vietnam war we would fly them --
L:  Oh really?
R:  -- to, uh, to the US.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I know about the program, I never heard about Flying Tigers though.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Is it a pri- was it a private, uh, company?
R:  No, it wasn’t.
L:  Or a government company?
R:  No, it was -- it wasn’t a government, it was, um, a publica- publicly, uh, held company.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Um, I think they -- they were on the stock market.  Yeah.  Um --
L:  Mm.
R:  They were based here in Los Angeles --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- yeah, but we had facilities all around the world.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, there’s a book about Flying Tigers.
L:  I have to look that up because now I’m all curious about it.
R:  Yeah, it’s a -- yeah, it’s very, very interesting and it, um, there’s a book and there’s a video.  I don’t know if you remember, John Wayne was in a movie called The Flying Tigers?
L:  I’m -- I know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- John Wayne but I don’t think I ever --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- saw the movie about that, yes.
R:  Yeah, it was the, um, it was about these pilots --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and they flew these very dangerous missions.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And these were the ones that started the company.  And it -- it’s history, it’s a really interesting, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in- interesting part of, uh, the aviation history.
L:  That’s great.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Sounds interesting, yeah.
R:  So -- so what do you do?
L:  I’m a retired criminologist and now I do a --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- lot of market research.
R:  Oh, right, right.
L:  And I do writing, and I do videography.  You know, everything a little bit.
R:  Yeah, oh, very good.
L:  But I retired early though.  I worked for the government and, uh, I could retire really early because once you work there you are, you know, you are on call twenty four seven.  And so your hours --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- add up really fast.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You have a lot of hours while you’re still relatively young and then you can have a whole lifetime in front of you!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  A whole lifetime ahead to do other things, which I really appreciate now.
R:  Yeah.  So I’m just in my early forties and I would love to retire!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I retired when I was in my early forties.  I’m fifty two now.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, well, that’s nice.  You know, I just -- I feel like I’m missing so much, you know, by working full time.
L:  Yeah, with the kids --
R: And not --
L:  -- probably, no?
R:  Yeah.  And not being at home with the children, I do.
L:  Right.
R:  I feel like I really miss out on a lot.  No, because here -- I don’t know what it’s like in Illinois, but here there aren’t any after school programs that you can put your --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- children into without having to pay for them.
L:  Oh yeah, you have to pay for them here too.  I’m sure there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- are some social --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- programs but basically, no, you have to pay for everything here also.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You see, my daughter --
R:  Yeah, see --
L: -- is already twenty seven, so -- and she grew up in Europe, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  I don’t know about this.  But I only know --
R:  Well --
L:  -- what I hear from friends and people here.  They pay dearly.
R:  It is ridiculously expensive.
L:  [COUGH]  Yeah, it is.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  I think we -- we pay close to a thousand dollars a month.
L:  For two kids?
R:  Um, for two kids to be watched after school.
L:  Mm, that’s -- that’s a lot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you know what, that makes me question a -- question if it’s profitable at all for you to work full time, huh, when you think about that?
R:  Yeah, well, you know --
L:  That you pay a thousand dollars.
R:  Yeah.  It -- it is.
L:  It is, yeah.
R:  Because, um, yeah, rents are very high here in California, where I am.  [SIGH]  Everything is a little more expensive here.  In fact --
L:  Yeah, I know, I know that.
R:  -- I have a friend that --
L:  But it’s a great place to be.
R:  Oh it’s -- it’s -- it’s absolutely beautiful here, it really is, I wouldn’t live anywhere else.
L:  Right.
R:  But I have a friend --
L:  I hate it here!  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you?  Well, I have a friend that just moved back --
L:  Really?  [LAUGH]
R:  Um -- they lived in our building --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and she and her husband decided to, um, move back to, uh, Chicago, a place just outside of Chicago, because her parents --
L:  Yeah.  I lived also in Chicago, in the west -- western suburbs.
R:  Well, you know, she sent a picture, um, of a house that they had built.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I couldn’t believe it, what they got for their money.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I think they paid maybe two hundred and twenty five thousand dollars for this house --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for -- for the land, and for the house to be built.  And it’s got five bedrooms, it’s --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- two stories, they’ve got a forest in their backyard and --
L:  Great.
R:  -- you know, and I thought, “My goodness”.
L:  W- w- do you know what the town’s called?
R:  I don’t.  You know, I don’t, I have no idea.
L:  Mm.
R:  I -- I don’t know.  She says it’s about, um, a twenty five minute drive outside of Chicago.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, because --
L:  That could be pretty close to where I live because that’s approximately where I live.  When there’s no traffic.  You know, when there’s traffic it’s about a two and a half to a three hour drive.
R:  Right.
L:  But you know that much better from where you live, there.
R:  Oh, we have horrible traffic here.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You see, I lived --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in Montana before I moved here.  I moved here because of my husband’s job but I really loved Montana.  Before that I lived in Atlanta for six years.  And now I’m this area and I really do not like it much.
R:  Oh.  Now, what is it that you don’t like, is it the weather?
L:  I don’t like the weather, I don’t like the landscape, it’s -- everything’s just flat.  You know, there’s --
R:  Oh God.
L:  -- nothing that’s just -- well, it’s the midwest!  [LAUGH]
R:  It is, yes.
L:  That’s when I think, I’ll go a little bit further west, you have nothing but cornfields and they are flat, you can standing in the middle of the street and all around you’ll see the horizon and the horizon is corn!
R:  Oh god!
L:  Everywhere.  It’s
