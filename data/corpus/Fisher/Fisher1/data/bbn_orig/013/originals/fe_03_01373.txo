R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  Uh, this is Costas[?].
R:  I'm Jesse[?].
L:  Jesse.  How you doing?
R:  Good.  How you doing?
L:  Oh, pretty good.  So, uh, censorship, um, whether or not, um, schools should, ah, what is it, allow or bar students from reading certain books.  Is that what it was? 
R:  [MN] Like forcing students to read certain books.
L:  Oh, forcing them, okay.  Ah, well, um, I think generally, ah, [MN] you know, um, I think parents probably have the right to -- to be involved in the decision, but, ah, you know, I think generally students are, ah, in school to be exposed to, ah, you know, a range of different, ah, ideas, so, you know, um, my feeling is they should be exposed to as much stuff as possible and kind of, you know, let them decide.
R:  It should be dependent on the community standards -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- like what's considered, uh, inappropriate. 
L:  Right.
R:  Like, you know, the definition of obscene is up to the community to set up. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  There's, uh, -- [inaudible] that's definitely a factor but, um, you know, I guess it's always, you know, where do you draw the line.  It's kind of, um, you know, there's a lot of things that -- that are pretty obviously obscene, I think, in -- in most communities, but, uh, you know, when you get to, uh, borrow certain books like, say, Huck Finn or, uh, Catcher in the Rye might be objectionable or obscene and, you know, how do you decide?  Ah, I don't know.  You don't have [inaudible] that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's, you know, it's pretty easy to point out certain things that you probably would never find in a school, anyway, that would be obscene, but it's always, ah, it comes down to the, ah, um, -- it comes down to the -- the grey areas, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Um, well, let's see ... 
R:  So what are you saying, it's unconstitutional to force people to read certain books or ... 
L:  Unconstitutional?  Um, -- well, [several inaudible words] yeah, I'm not sure [several inaudible words] force them to read certain books, but, um, how -- how you define force?  I mean, I guess if it's -- if a student has to read this book or else he doesn't get the grade or he can't get credit for that class, then, yeah, I guess that's forcing him to do it.  Um, on the other hand, though, you gotta, you know, how do you keep a curriculum?  I mean, you can't have students and their parents just kind of picking and choosing which -- what parts of the, you know, the curriculum they want to do, what part they don't, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, -- 
R:  But generally if it's not too offensive, then I don't think parents would object to it, but if it's blatantly, you know, inappropriate, like -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- maybe Harry Potter, some people might say that's objectionable.
L:  Yeah, I've heard that a lot. 
R:  Magic and sorcery.
L:  Um, you know, I mean, yeah, I've heard that a lot from some people who just consider it's, you know, it's -- it's, um, elements ... I -- I -- I've got to admit I've never read it myself.  I have friends who -- who have and their kids who love it but, you know, [inaudible] they say there's elements of, um, you know, non-Christian, uh, uh, values [several inaudible words] having your kids be exposed to ... um, it's, um, you know, that's where the grey area comes in, I mean what --  what do you say.  I guess you can try to filter[?] stuff that's just completely non- -- just completely non-offensive, but how many, you know, how much of that stuff can you -- can you find and, you know, when the kids get to [inaudible] you just start to get into adva- -- more advanced material and [several inaudible words].  I think basically you -- you can't please everybody all the time, you know.
R:  It also depends on the topic of the book, I guess.  Like, if you're reading, like, Kama Sutra to, like, fifth graders, I mean that's inappropriate, but ... 
L:  Well, yeah. 
R:  Well, that's extreme, but, you know what I'm saying.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I do.  Um, common sense, ah, whi- which I know is kind of a -- a minefield [inaudible] put it that way, but I think generally common sense, ah, can take care of a lot of that.  Ah, you know you're not supposed to, ah, ah, expose, ah, kids to -- to, you know, certain things like that, ah, not at an early age, maybe never and [several inaudible words] not specifically the books but I guess this comes into play with like sex -- sex education, it's kind of -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, the same thing there, um, -- 
R:  I think it should be left up -- 
L:  Some people --
R:  -- to their community.  I mean, if you live in a certain community then the chances are you have similar values and if you happen to have differing values, then you should have options available, like you're a vegetarian.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I think, uh, -- I think you've got a point there, you've got a good point there.  Um, ah, I guess it makes more work for the ah, ah, you know, school administrators and teachers and that's --  that's probably how it should be, ah, you know, but, ah, try to accommodate everybody, ah, or at least the, ah, you know, whatever's prevailing in that -- in that certain community.  Ah, maybe the only thing you have to consider is that, ah, ah, in a lot of cases the kids will, um, grow up and, you know, good chance they'll go move to those other parts of the world, other parts of the country and -- and maybe consider that as far as, um, you know, taking into account community standards, but from there kind of maybe expand the scope a little bit.  [PAUSE] 
R:  And you also have to consider -- 
L:  Ah, --
R:  -- like being in a very closed Christian community that's very conservative and let's say you go to college in Los Angeles or something and -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- it's like a culture shock.
L:  Oh, God [inaudible].  I'm sure a lot of people, ah, a lot of kids, ah, you know, go through that right about that age, um, you live in a small town all your life and all of a sudden you, ah, you go to, you know, three thousand miles away and, uh, "Hello", you know.  Um, --  that's why I mean I lean -- my -- my own personal view is -- is I really lean toward as little, um, restrictions as possible, ah, for myself.  I mean that would be my preference, uh, you know, find out all you can about everything and, uh, dispel the mystery from there and, you know, um, ... [MN] I'm -- I'm not sure how.  I guess part of it is because I'm not sure how effective it is to kind of, uh, restrict or keep anything from, uh, from anyone, a kid or anything else.  I mean -- the thing about this, too, I mean [several inaudible words] they don't learn about it in school, I mean, ah, the internet now, um, [MN] other things.  I mean it's --  it's -- it's hard to really, um, [MN] keep someone from being aware of, uh, things like that if [inaudible] -- if they really want to be exposed to it.  Um, at least at school where there's kind of a framework there that, um, uh, that, uh, you know, ah, they're kind of, um, introduced to it in a structured way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ... um, did you ever run into that, like in -- when you were going school, like some book came up that some parents objected to or anything like that?
R:  Not really.  I mean I'm from LA, so -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- not much.
L:  Yeah.  I'm from New York [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- so we didn't really ... uh, I -- I know that I don't remember anything like that and I know a lot of the books that we read, ah, ah, like A Separate Peace or Catcher in the Rye, they were, uh, back then were, um, -- we knew -- we -- I guess I was aware at that time that in, ah, some other parts of the country these were the kind of things that, ah, people were touchy about, but -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, it -- it wasn't an issue where I was.
R:  And it also depends on the time.  I mean, The Awakening was, like, really controversial, I mean feminism.  She c- commits suicide at the end, she leaves her husband and people were like, "Wow, what the heck is this?" -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but a hundred years later it's totally okay.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  [inaudible] there's, a, you know, the mores change, um, especially over, you know, long periods of time but even, you know, ten, twenty years later, ah, things [NOISE] -- things tend to be, uh, uh, people tend to have a different attitude toward, uh, uh, toward some things, uh, so ... yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, it sounds like we're sort of of a like mind, I guess, on this.  Uh, the, uh, [MN] ... I'm not sure what else to add to it, ah, -- 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you know.  Ah, I'm trying to think of, like, a real solid situation where, uh, where it wouldn't be a good idea to, um, -- or, you know, where, you know, banning certain books would be a good idea, but I'm not -- I'm not really think- -- I'm not really coming up with thinking.  Ah, you see things in the news every once in a while, you know -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- relating to this.
