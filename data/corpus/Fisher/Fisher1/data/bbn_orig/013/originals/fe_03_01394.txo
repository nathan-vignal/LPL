L:  Hi, my name's Kelly.
R:  Hi, my name is Ann.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  I'm good, how are you?
L:  Good, thank you.  Well, um, I guess -- I can start if you want?
R:  Okay.
L:  I -- I actually do exercise, um, regularly.  I go to -- I'm a Taekwando student so martial arts.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, so I go like three or four times a week and I exercise for an hour each time and, um, it's a pretty good workout 'cause we do that plus we do like cardio kickboxing kind of thing --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- during the class so it's pretty aerobic.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, um --
R:  Well, I do not exercise regularly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I should but I don't.  Um, I have participated in water aerobics.  I think I am going to start back.  I feel better when I do them.
L:  Oh, yeah, you always feel so much better.  It's like it gives you so much more energy.
R:  It does and it -- that doesn't make any sense.
L:  Yeah, it's kinda --
R:  But it does.
L:  -- weird because you would think that you would get tired.
R:  Mhm.  Well -- Well, I do get tired.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, uh, I know before when I was in water aerobics I found that it makes my stamina so much better.
L:  That's supposed to be really good for you too.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Because it -- with the resistance of the water --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- really helps and it's not, um, stressful to anything.
R:  Well, they -- they tell you that wa- -- just walking --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the water for fifteen minutes is equivalent to walking for an hour.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, that's a pretty -- you know, that's a pretty good trade off, I think.
L:  That's fantastic.  Do you go to a gym for that?
R:  Um, sports com, yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's -- I mean, that's so great.  I've seen that in my gym and I -- they do it most of the time when I'm at work so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I haven't been able to really participate.  But, yeah, I mean, it looks like it's a great workout.
R:  It --
L:  And it's funny 'cause you're thinking, "Oh well, it's just in the pool, how big of a deal could it be?"
R:  Right.  Well, I usually swim after we get through with our class for a little while.  That's the only kinda exercise that I enjoy at all doing.
L: Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] I'm old and set in my ways.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, you know, it -- yes.
R:  But I didn't like exercise when I wasn't old so ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] it's kinda hard to get into, it really is.  I mean, you know, it's funny 'cause sometimes like my class for Taekwando will be half an hour and I'm like, "Oh, do I really wanna go" and since I have to drag myself to get there --
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, you know, it's usually worth it and I usually -- it's a great stress reliever 'cause I'm punching things and kicking things.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, you know, once you get there, get started, it's not so bad.  It's just, "Do I really want to do this?"
L:  Exactly, exactly.  That's -- I mean, yeah, it's just getting myself to go.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But -- like the gym I have a lot of problems because I wouldn't have anybody there waiting for me --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to meet me there, to get me to make sure that I went but, like, with my class if I don't go my friends or the instructors will be all like, "Where were you?"  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  And they'll call me and -- so that's helpful too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just for me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, yeah it's --
R:  Now, where are you from?
L:  I'm in California but, um, I grew up all over the place.  So, I went to school in Massachusetts and -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I have family in Tennessee.
R:  Oh really? Well, I live in Tennessee.
L:  Oh, no kidding?
R:  Mhm.
L:  My family's in Kingsport.
R:  Oh, over in East Tennessee.  I'm in Smirna[?] just south of Nashville.
L:  Okay, okay.  It's -- it's beautiful there.  I love it.
R:  Yes, it i-
L:  My dad lives in a -- well, he lives north of Atlanta.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so, um, it's funny 'cause I talk to him and he's a [inaudible] accent and sometimes I pick it up and it's funny 'cause I'll be out here talking and I'll talk to somebody and they'll be like, "What'd you say?"  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Well, I talked to my dad [LAUGH] I picked it up [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, well I picked up some -- some northern in your -- in your voice.
L:  Yeah, yeah, the Massachusetts comes through every once in a while.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  My school was pretty close to Boston so it picked up a little bit of that [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, every once in a while I say something and, you know, even here and they say, "What are you saying?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, [LAUGH] I mean, you know, let me say it really slowly [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  And enunciate, yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  But how did -- yeah, I mean, I guess let's see more health and exercise questions, I'm trying to think.  Was there another -- another kind of exercise that you'd ever done beside from the water aerobics?
R:  [SIGH] I tried the, uh, hilt club thing.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Many years ago and I just never could get into that.  I just couldn't get the least bit excited about that.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I wa- -- exercise just does not excite me at all.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It never has [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it's -- you know, it's kinda boring.  I -- I had tried the, um, the gym like the machines and stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's just like so boring.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I tried that many, many, many years ago and I just -- it's just not my cup of -- the only thing I really enjoyed about that was going in the, uh, uh, sauna and --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- um, and I did enjoy that part of it.
L:  Yeah, I really miss that.  It --
R:  The things that don't require movement, you know [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You just sit there [LAUGH].
L:  See I like that 'cause you go in there and then you look like you've been exercising 'cause you're all sweaty and, you know, like --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- yeah.
R:  Now I like that part of it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I sound like I am really -- I'm really not nearly as lazy as I sound like [LAUGH].
L:  Oh no, no but I know exactly -- I mean and, you know, it's -- it's hard especially, you know, as you get older it's like the less -- less you wanna go.
R:  Right.
L:  And, you know -- I don't know, it's -- I can't imagine -- I mean, sometimes it's like I'm only thirty and I -- sometimes I find it like really a struggle [LAUGH] to get going so I'm like, "Oh, when I get a little older" like when I hit forty or fifty I wonder, you know, how I'm gonna be able to pull it off [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I think, a lot -- a lot depends on how much you like it when you're younger.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And how much you participate.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, if you're not really into it you'll wake up one morning when you're fifty five or so and you'll see all your sagging parts [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] I'm starting to see that actually already.  It's kinda sad.  I don't know what happened but --
R:  Well, let me tell you, it gets worse.
L:  Somewhere around thirty it is, as soon as I hit thirty I woke up and I thought, "Boy, this changed".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This wasn't like this before [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] How exactly --
R:  Well, it only gets worse unless you do something about it.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  It's I guess like -- it's funny 'cause the Taekwando takes care of some of it but like I remember when I was a kid people used to make fun of the teachers 'cause the arms -- underneath the arms --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- where it would swing?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:   And I was like --
R:  Yes, I have that [LAUGH].
L:  -- "Oh, I'm never gonna have that" I have that now [LAUGH].
R:  Everybody's gonna have that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, gravi- gravity is not real kind [LAUGH].
L:  No, it doesn't seem like it will be [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Everything's just kind of shifting [LAUGH].
R:  Yup, yup, everything just kind of sags and bags, it's just ...  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it's kinda [LAUGH] -- it's more frustrating but, I guess, what can you do.  I mean if everybody's going to go through it.
R:  And, you know, really there's -- there's something that kinda not quite fair about that because the heavier somebody is, as they get older the less the sag and the bag shows.
L:  Isn't that funny how that works?
R:  When you're -- you know, when you're  -- I mean I'm not being vain, I mean, you know, a pencil, by any means, but I'm not grossly overweight or anything like that either.
L:  Right.
R:  And it seems like there's -- you're saggier when there's not as much to sag.
L:  [LAUGH] It's like it shows more.
R:  I think so.
L:  Yeah, it's just [LAUGH] I don't know, it's kinda -- it is it's disheartening [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause you feel it should be the other way around.
R:  But if you keep everything toned up you'll be g- -- you'll be fine.  Uh, I -- I did not keep things toned up [LAUGH].  That requires work. [LAUGH].
L:  Well, some of the girls I work with, you know, are in a gym every day, you know, doing their, like, aerobics and I just -- I can't get motivated to do anything like that.
R:  Nah.
L:  I have just, you know, so much time and I just -- I guess I don't enjoy that [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I do -- when I do -- when I do participate in the water aerobics I go twice a week.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that seems to be enough.  I can --
L:  Yeah, how long is the class?
R:  It's an hour.
L:  Oh, that's a good length.
R:  It -- the class is an hour and then if you want to stay and swim or if you want to go early and swim --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you can do that.  You can stay as long as want to after the class is over.
L:  Oh, wow, that's nice.
R:  'Cause where they have 'em, uh, they have one in the morning, it's like at nine o'clock, which is not bad, and then they have one at six in the evening.
L:  That's pretty good.
R:  Which is not bad.
L:  Yeah.  That's great.  Now, do you stretch before you start doing your exercises in the pool too?
R:  No, we walk first.  
L:  Okay.
R:  We wal- -- the first fifteen minutes of class is just walking back and forth across the pool.
L:  Wow.
R:  And then the, uh, stretching exercises and all this that we do in the water moves every joint in your body.
L:  That's fantastic.  I should -- I should get my, like, relatives involved in something like this ...
