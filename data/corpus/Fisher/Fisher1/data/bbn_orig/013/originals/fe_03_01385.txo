R:  Hello.
L:  Shannon Dougher[?].  Hello?
R:  Hello, my name is Beth.
L:  Beth?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Hi, my name is Shannon.
R:  Nice to meet you.  [LAUGH]
L:  Nice to meet you as well.
R:  Do you exercise regularly?
L:  I actually do.
R:  I actually don't!  [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  I wish I did but I don't.
L:  Why don't you?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, well, my job, I work in theater and, um, my hours are really kinda screwy, I kind of work from about early afternoon until usually about ten or eleven at night.  And then in the mornings, after I, you know, I get home and I wanna stay up and TV and unwind, then when I get up in the mornings I don't feel like it.  So, I  haven't put it into my schedule yet but I do need to.
L:  Do you, um, uh, work the box office or do you work, uh --
R:  I'm actually, um --
L:  -- as an actress or --
R:  No, I'm the production manager, so, um --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- it's, yeah!  [LAUGH]  So I tell everyone what to do and during the rehearsal period I, um, direct and whatnot.  But 
L:  Interesting.
R:  It's a lot of running but it's not really [LAUGH] exercise!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  In a way you could consider that there's some exercise involved with your job, right?
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  I mean, you walk around at a hurried pace and, you know, you're hustling around getting things done.
R:  That's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But the bad thing is, is that I smoke.
L:  Uh!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That'll do ya --
R:  So that kinda cancels out any of that.  So, I gotta quit that and I gotta start doing something, walking or something.
L:  Mm, walking is a good start.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Bicycle's even better.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  My husband rides bikes but I don't.  I used to but then my sister borrowed my bike and got it stolen, so that kinda wound that up.
L:  Yeah!
R:  [LAUGH]  I guess if you could chase a two year old and count that as exercise, and I do that every day so 
L:  That is definitely exercise!
R:  [LAUGH]  Most definitely.
L:  Yeah, two year olds are a handful aren't they?
R:  Oh, that's the truth.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you exercise [LAUGH] I -- I mean --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- what -- what sort of?
L:  -- actually, I do.  Um, twice a week.
R:  I mean, do you exercise every day?  Twice a week?
L:  Mhm.  Um --
R:  Do you go to a gym or do you just work out at home, or ?
L:  No, I go to a studio.  I train, um, [inaudible] Thai, which is, um, Thai boxing.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Thai kick boxing.  Um  m- my instructor has this small gym type place, it's j- it's basically just, um, a couple of punching bags and a big mat in front of a large mirror.
R:  Okay.
L:  But it's a really good workout.  Really s- um, strenuous in the cardiovascular and, uh, muscle conditioning, uh, mental conditioning -- huge on mental conditioning because, you know, w- when you're trying to avoid getting punched in the face and you're trying to punch somebody else in the -- in the ribs, you know, you gotta be completely on point with all that.
R:  Pretty quick, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  Exactly.  So 
R:  I- I'd like to do something like that except for we live in a really small town now, we moved here about a year ago, and really the closest place for any of that would be about an hour away.
L:  Yeah?
R:  We have a really small gym here that's owned by a local person but, I mean, it's -- it's kinda crappy so 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  They kind of just give you a key and you go there and you work out and lock up when you're done, so it's not --
L:  Oh, that's not so bad.
R:  See, I need somebody to show me what to do and what I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- need to do and how long --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that I need to do each thing.  So --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's not really good for a person like me.
L:  Yeah.  Um, do you have mornings available to you?
R:  I do but I usually waste those mornings!  I sit around and not do anything.
L:  Mm.  Well, try going out and, uh, you know, just walking around and seeing stuff.
R:  I need to --
L:  It definitely helps not only your body but definitely your overall mood.  I mean --
R:  Yeah, I think it would help a lot.  I used to skydive but I haven't done that since I got married 'cause my mother in law threatened to kill me [LAUGH] if I did it any more!  So --
L:  Oh, you shouldn't be afraid of anybody, especially your mother in law, if you --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- if you've been able to jump out an airplane before.
R:  That's true.
L:  You know.  I mean, honestly, if you can jump out of an airplane, you can handle a mother in law!
R:  [LAUGH]  That's the truth!  [LAUGH]  Especially after I had my child she was -- said, you know, you know, "Absolutely not!"  [LAUGH]  She's pretty feisty.
L:  Oh.  Yes.
R:  But she -- she lives in Pennsylvania and we live in Georgia so she wouldn't know!
L:  Yeah, exactly.  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What doesn't -- what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
R:  That's right!  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that was pretty much the only exercise that I was doing for a while.  And then, mm, when I was younger I took dance for about eleven years, for about six to eight hours a week, so 
L:  Mhm.
R:  But after that I just -- I stopped!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  Let's see, um, daily exercise helps me to maintain my mood and definitely my confidence in myself, uh, you know, just being able to [inaudible] yourself and know what you really can do in a situation [MN] it's al-- it's always positive!  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I think it would help me feel a lot better because my husband always teases me about my poor diet and [LAUGH] lack of exercise, so 
L:  Well, you should tell him to stop teasing you and start helping you.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, exactly, while he's sitting on the couch smoking cigarettes he's not really [LAUGH] getting a lot of exercise either!
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  So  [LAUGH]
L:  Go tell him what's up!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But he joined the gym in Tallahassee, so when he's down there working he gets to work out, but it's --
L:  Fair enough.
R:  -- just not real convenient for me.
L:  Oh yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Understandable.  How far away from Tallahassee are you?
R:  About sixty miles.
L:  Wow, that's a pretty good distance.
R:  Yeah!  [LAUGH]
L:  Huh.
R:  But, I mean, you know, like I said, there is that one gym here but, I mean, it's crappy so 
L:  You know, even that -- just go in there and just, uh, work yourself until you feel your heart rate accelerate.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, you do that a couple of times a week, you start going in there a little bit longer and trying out different things.  It's not so much like  having somebody there to -- to help you out, like, to show you stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause you could figure it out, all -- all you're really doing is really lifting stuff up and putting it back down.  But the key to all that is just go slowly, you know?
R:  Right, well how long --
L:  And do-
R:  -- do you think I need to at first, when I start out?  I mean --
L:  Try ten or fifteen minutes at the mo- at the least.  I mean, fifteen minutes is a good workout.
R:  Okay.  Well, that's probably why I don't like to then, because I always go and I think that I need to be there an hour or something.
L:  Oh, not even close!
R:  [LAUGH]  And then you get --
L:  Once you start sweating -- once you seriously start sweating and breathing hard, that's when you know that you've reached, um, a line, and that -- that's your -- that's the beginning of your threshold right there.
R:  Okay.
L:  Basically.  And that -- that's when you're starting to really exert yourself, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, if you can maintain that kind of exertion level, that kind of intensity, for at least five or ten minutes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you're really -- you're doing good because you only need to work out maybe fifteen, twenty minutes a day, every day.  You know?
R:  Okay.
L:  Or even just twice, three times a week.  'Cause even that little bit will just stimulate you to wanna go in there more and more, you know?
R:  That's true.  Well, I think I'll start doing that.  I mean, I -- I've been wanting to, I just, you know, have made excuses about, well, I'm busy and  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I -- I've done the exact same thing and then --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I finally just got on it and just -- I haven't looked back, I love it.
R:  Well, how long have --
L:  You know, now --
R:  How long have you been doing it regularly?  I mean --
L:  Um, since December.
R:  -- uh, years or recently, or ?
L:  Well, I've always been really active.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I played soccer for about fifteen or sixteen years of my life.  [LIPSMACK]  And then I, uh, snowboarded about -- it's probably my thirteenth season now and, um, [SIGH] always been into hiking and running around.  I just went to play golf today.
R:  Wow!  Yeah, we have a nice --
L:  Yeah, I keep pretty --
R:  -- golf course, maybe I could do something like that!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, even just walking around the -- the grass for a few hours, you know, is good stuff.  Plus you'd be outside.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  And it's always real warm here.  What state do you live in?
L:  Utah.
R:  Utah, okay.  It's not as warm as it [LAUGH] is here!
L:  It was actually really nice today.
R:  Hm.
L:  Spring time.
R:  Wow, snowboarding.  I [LAUGH] -- I don't think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'd ever be very good at that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I went snow skiing one time, in Pennsylvania, when we went to visit my husband's family and it was not successful at all!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's a hard one.
R:  I thought I would be good at it but then, you know, I'd practise on the little kids' thing where you hold on to the little bar and it pulls you.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then my husband said, "You're ready, you're ready".  And, "This is a baby hill, come on".  And, "You're ready for it".  And --
L:  Baby hill huh!
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, it was not!  I kept making myself sit down just so that I could stop 'cause I thought I was going too fast, and I was afraid I'd roll down the hill or something.  But the snowboarding looks like it would be a lot more fun.
L:  Oh, it definitely is.
R:  Is it easier, or ?
L:  Um, I'd have to say that it's a lot easier to learn.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I can water ski and I can do that little kneeboard or whatever, but  hm, I thought I'd be able
