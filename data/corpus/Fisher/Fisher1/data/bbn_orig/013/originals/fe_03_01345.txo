L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  This is Joe Pinatouski[?].  Who am I speaking to with?
L:  My name is Mark Newell[?]. 
R:  Mark, where are you from?  
L:  Ah, California.
R:  California, I'm in Jersey.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN] So what do you think about this topic, Mark?
L:  What -- what is the topic again? 
R:  [LAUGH] Censorship.
L:  Censorship in priv- -- in public schools? 
R:  Oh, first -- I don't know, first they said censorship and then they [COUGH] said about do you think that private and public schools have the right to tell students what to read.  So I guess -- 
L:  Is that what it was?  
R:  I guess that -- 
L:  What -- what they should read or that -- that there should be censorship of certain books for what schools could ask their students to read?  
R:  I -- 
L:  It seems like a distinction.
R:  Yeah.  I think you're right.
L:  I'm not sure.
R:  I'm not sure myself because -- 
L:  What shall we choose? 
R:  -- first she said censorship and then she went on about public and private schools.  Ah, is this your first day on this line?  
L:  It is.
R:  It is.  Well, [MN] yesterday it was the same topic so [LAUGH] and I spoke with a gentleman out in, ah, Texas, but yesterday just said "Censorship", now they're talking about schools.  I mean -- 
L:  Ha.
R:  Well -- 
L:  So we -- we should just choose one.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  It sounds like.
R:  Yeah.  Well, s- -- so, ah, -- 
L:  So the two options are sh- -- should there be a -- should there be distinction, right? 
R:  Right.
L:  Well, [SIGH] so weird, I've got to tell you. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it sounded like should the -- the, um, school board or what have you have the right to tell students what books to read in the public and private schools.  That's the way I took it.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But of course I could be wrong.
L:  Well, let's go with that one.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, as far -- I don't know if you call that censor -- well, it's a form of censorship I guess, but if you're going to a private school and, ah, your parents are paying, you know, quite a bit of money to send you there, I guess, ah, you have to go along with the program.
L:  What if the parents disagree?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, that's -- that's a good one.  That's true, um, -- 
L:  I mean, I -- I -- I guess I would be in favor of in general the idea that the students have the -- students should -- if they can articulate why they don't want to read it, why it's inappropriate or offensive or --
R:  Right.
L:  Something, then it makes sense and they should propose something else that's somehow equivalent in its nature.
R:  Right, right.  Well, if something pops up in the middle of the semester and, I mean, I remember a few months back they are pulling certain books out of schools now, you know.  I didn't follow it too much, you know, er, like Catcher in the Rye at some schools.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And this -- but I'm not sure if the topic -- well, let's just go on what we are going with. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, ah, -- 
L:  [LAUGH] So that's my feeling is I'm -- I'm -- I guess I'm kind of liberal -- 
R:  Yeah, it should be up to the student, and I guess -- 
L:  [inaudible] Make their choices, they know what they want.
R:  True.
L:  They know what they -- hopefully they know what they need.  There's some sense of responsibility, what's that called, that moral responsibility that you're not just shirking the responsibility of having to stretch yourself to learn to -- to write a paper on something that seems difficult, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  That's the goal of the book, isn't it?  That's the goal of a reading exercise in the school is these are typically well written classics that -- that provide some sense of some place of education or some good stories.  There's relatively a large number of things that could meet that requirement.
R:  That's true.  Well, I would just think more along the lines of, ah, majority would rule, but -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [MN] I don't know what certain, ah, school boards are doing across the country.  I haven't been following that too much.
L:  You know, I get -- I get -- I do get very nervous about any sort of school boards making decisions about what's appropriate and what's not appropriate because you can get communities that might be perhaps more isolated that aren't giving exposure to topics that otherwise could be very valuable to a --  to a student.
R:  Right.  Well, I'm against also -- most forms of censorship I mean, er. Isn't that how the Nazis started out?
L:  Yep.
R:  That and they took away the guns from the people?  And this is where we got.  Well -- 
L:  Yeah.  There are lots of examples of it.  I mean, there's quite a bit of censorship that's still, you know, they -- do you have banned books?  There are a lot of banned books still in the United States.
R:  That's true.
L:  And, ah, the government makes different -- government's involved in some of those.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But not all of 'em, and others are just more state banned some -- some coalition has come together and lobbied the state government to say these books shouldn't be -- matter of fact, I think they even go as far, and I don't have any -- this isn't particularly a topic I've studied, but it seems like there's even text books that get banned because they provide a perspective on history that's not in accordance with a local or state -- 
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- group.
R:  Right.  Well, it seems like the government's in everything today, they're into too many things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I don't know the answer.  I don't know.  It seems like the whole world's getting worse all the time.
L:  So what would be the ideal?  What -- what would be your ideal in this scenario?
R:  [LAUGH] That's a good question.  If I knew exactly what the -- what the topic was but we're going along where we're at, so I would just think, ah, like you had mentioned.  Ah, if this is something the students want, you know, and they can, ah, articulate themselves in a -- in a fashion that, ah, would let the teachers or what have you know where they stand, I think if they're -- they should be able to choose.
L:  Mhm, mm.  That's -- that's -- I'm just trying to think back to when I was in school and how, you know, there were books that were kind of not very interesting for whatever reason, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  That -- that I didn't like reading but often by the time I finished writing the paper -- 
R:  You got interested in it.
L:  I got really into it and there was all this subtle information and very useful and -- I often had these really profound kind of, you know, because there was the last minute the night before --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  --  experiences, where I wanted to write at the bottom of the paper, "Thank you so much for forcing me to read and write about this book, I've --  I've got a lot out of it.  I've learned a lot, thank you".
R:  Well, you have a good point which is true.  You know, a lot of things are boring or don't appeal to you and then once you get in it, it may turn out to be something entirely different.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And something that you enjoy.  So it's a tough one to call.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I went to mostly Catholic schools, you know what I mean, and -- 
L:  Yeah, well, there's an example of probably you were exposed to only material of a certain type.
R:  Yeah, you had religion.  I had to go to church each morning before class, well, that was in the sixties.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm probably older than you, I will be -- well, I'm forty eight.
L:  I'm thirty five.
R:  Uh-huh, but, I mean, go in there at that time you knew, you know, what you were up against and what -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, what's going to be taught and there was never no where ... no where ... I don't know what -- no problem really.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Course back then, you know, they had a paddle, those nuns would whack you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, ah, ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Did you feel like you had a choice?  Could you say "No, I don't want to read this" for whatever reason?
R:  No, no, I didn't, no.  What they gave you to read, you read.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you didn't have much of a choice, no.  Of course, they're bringing -- well, like you had to wear a uniform this and that.  I -- now there's even public schools where they're telling you to wear uniforms.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, that's another one to call, whether you're for it or against it.
L:  It is, it's an interesting one.  I could make arguments probably on both sides.
R:  Yeah, that's the -- that's the thing about it.  I mean, there's two sides.  You could always make points with either side so it's a hard -- hard one to call.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I mean, yes, you lose somewhat of your freedom to express yourself and what have you, but then again, you don't have kids, you know, making fun of other kids because you might be able to dress a little better, you know, every --
