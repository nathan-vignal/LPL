L:  Hey, I'm Lars.
R:  Danine Green.
L:  Hello?
R:  Yes.  Danine Green.
L:  Oh, hi.  How are you? 
R:  Good.  What did you say your name was?
L:  Lars, L.A.R.S.
R:  L.A.R.S.? 
L:  Ahah, and yours is Janine? 
R:  Janine with a D.
L:  Oh, okay.  It's hard to hear on the cell phone.  Nice to meet you.
R:  Okay.
L:  Ah, so, health and fitness.  Boy, what do you do to stay healthy?
R:  Ah, not much unfortunately but I -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but I would like to try.  Um, actually, I would like to try I guess to start out by, like, walking and then maybe doing like, ah, some salsa, milengay[?] lessons with my husband, you know, stuff like that.
L:  Oh, that's good, yeah.
R:  And then -- yeah.  You know, something like that, and then, ah, after that to be able to, ah, I guess [SIGH] get involved in just daily walking, you know what I mean? 
L:  Yes.
R:  That way you do cardiovascular, um, but it's something you enjoy, you know.
L:  Yeah.  I totally agree.
R:  How about you?
L:  Yea, I used to do a lot of swing dancing and, uh -- 
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- and that keeps you in really good shape.
R:  Yeah, because it -- you have to be able to catch your breath.
L:  Yeah.  It's --  it's amazing.  It's nice, though, too, because you're -- since you're having fun, you almost don't notice all the exercise you're getting.
R:  Mhm.  Did you lose weight with it?
L:  Yeah, actually I did.  I was doing it, you know, three or four times a week, you know, and totally lost weight, yeah.
R:  Wow. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow, that sounds good.
L:  Yeah.  Some --
R:  So you had to drink a lot of water.
L:  What's that?
R:  You had to drink a lot of water.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some people even brought changes of shirts, you know, because they get all sweaty and so they'd go and change into another shirt [NOISE] in the middle of it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that was pretty cool.
R:  Wow, [several inaudible words]
L:  So now you've got to convince your husband to learn salsa, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, he -- he -- he actually does want to learn and -- 
L:  Oh. 
R:  -- it's been taking us some time to find a place that actually gives the lessons and now we finally have it, but it's just now a matter of carving out the time to go, um, -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, we've been to a couple of functions where we, um, you know, where they play salsa or milengay music, um, but I know how to do it, my husband doesn't, so it's kind of difficult, you know what I mean -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- because I do it myself and then he's not, but then, ah, we've even tried walking, um, in the evenings, you know, after work and that way it gives us a chance to talk and spend some time, you know, just walking, you know -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- away from the kids or whatever, so -- 
L:  Yeah.  It's hard -- it's hard to find the time to work out when you're working full time, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's like it's, ah, in the mornings I'm too tired and after work I'm not very motivated, so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, ... 
R:  You almost have to do it at lunch time.
L:  Yeah, I try to do that.  I -- I have a gym that I'm a member of and so I make it over there during lunch occasionally -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that works pretty well.
R:  Oh, okay.  That sounds good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But then you're so tired -- I mean you're so hot, it's difficult to go back to work.
L:  Yeah.  I wish they had more showers, like our building doesn't have a shower [NOISE] in it.  Um, otherwise it would be great.  Did you just hear a loud beep?
R:  Yeah, I did.
L:  Yeah.  Huh.
R:  Is that the battery of your phone?
L:  No, it must be something on their end.
R:  Oh, okay.  All right.  But, um, yes.  See, that's the thing, is trying to work out -- but, you know, it's interesting, I was watching the show, um, Oprah Winfrey -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and she is forty nine years old and she's recently just seen the need within the past couple of years to really be in shape because before that she was up and down with her weight -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and she works out in the gym six days a week.
L:  Wow. 
R:  Six days a week -- 
L:  That's a lot. 
R:  -- for two hours.
L:  Wow. 
R:  That's -- but she has a personal trainer and she's been able to get her weight down and keep it down.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But a lot of times people will want to exercise not just for weight loss but just to maintain and just to be healthy -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- because, you know, as people, we eat the wrong foods all the time, anyway -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- foods that are high in cholesterol and things like that, so we have to kind of keep our heart going, um, but they say there's a lot of things that -- that you can do for exercise, too, -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know what I mean? 
L:  Well, another thing I find it hard to do is cook well because, you know, I come home from work, I'm usually really tired and really hungry -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so it's easier to make something fast that's unhealthy than to actually spend the time to cook something good, you know.
R:  Exactly, unless have you a salad already made.
L:  Right.  Exactly. [MN]
R:  Mhm, already made up in the beginning of the week or something like that and then, um, if you get a chance to do that.  Plus, a lot of times, too, I mean we're so busy and there's no more normal nine to five jobs any more.  Now jobs can be ten hours a day.
L:  Yeah.  I know.  It's -- it's -- it's horrible.  I mean, it seems like working hours are getting longer and longer, you know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and companies will offer some perks like, you know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to keep you at work, but I would rather work fewer hours and make less money, to be honest, you know.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  That way you have time to enjoy the money you make.
L:  Exactly.  Right.  
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  It's either -- it's either you have money, it's either you have a job but no time or you don't have a job and you have no money. [LAUGH]
R:  So what do you do, right?
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  Or, you can walk a dog.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know what I mean?  You can run in the park, jog around.  Even some people that, friends of mine, they walk around the park in the evening, you know what I mean? 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Like a bunch of my girlfriends and I may get together and we'll just do a brisk walk, you know --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- I mean, around the park, but then you've got to worry about safety issues.
L:  That's true.  I try to, ah, try to [inaudible] [NOISE] like a lot of my -- ow!  That hurt.  A lot of my friends, you know, they want to -- when they want to socialize they want to go out to eat and, ah, but that gets expensive going to restaurants and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I try and switch them to do things like go to a walk -- go for a walk together and that way you're not eating unhealthy food, you're not spending a lot of money on eating out and you get to spend time with them and exercise at the same time and that works pretty well.
R:  Yes, or even skating.
L:  Skating?
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, I haven't really done that.
R:  Skating is very good exercise.
L:  Oh, like inline skates?
R:  Yeah, or roller skating, ice skating, all of that is excellent, excellent exercise. Yeah, it's very good.  Like, it works like your legs and stuff like that -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- your lower body, plus it helps towards, um,  cardiovascular, um, what's that, skating.  Bowling -- 
L:  Hm. 
R:  You know what I mean?  
L:  Never been bowling.
R:  All those things, yeah, because it helps -- 
L:  Do you, er, do you bike at all?
R:  Do I ride a bike?
L:  Ahah.
R:  I haven't rode a bike in years because I had, um, serious surgery a couple of years ago -- 
L:  Oh. 
R:  So I haven't -- um, I actually want to start doing that again, even if I do like a, um, a stationary bike ... um, I don't think that I'm secure enough yet, stationary enough, to get on a real bike -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and actually be able to go.
L:  Ahah.
R:  But a stationary ba- -- bike, um, would actually be pretty good for me, yeah.
L:  It's a lot easier on your joints than running or anything like that, that's for sure.
R:  Yeah, yeah, because they say jogging is not good for women.
L:  Yeah, I think jogging in general is pretty rough on your body.
R:  Yeah, it's bad on your knees, on your ankles, on your legs, it's just all around can be -- 
L:  I've -- 
R:  Go ahead.
L:  I've tried several times and [LAUGH] I always end up having knee [NOISE] problems.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, man.  Yes, that's pretty bad.
L:  My body's not -- my body's not built for it.  So what part of the country do you live in? 
R:  Uh, United States.  I live in Pennsylvania.
L:  In Pennsylvania? 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So it gets pretty -- does it get too cold to do stuff during there during the winter or -- 
R:  Ah, yeah, it does, um, -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, [COUGH] but now we're unseasonably warm.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  So I don't know if this is going to be an indication of what the summer's going to be like, but, um, [COUGH] so I figured I'd better start, you know, my exercise program now.  At least that's something I can get used to.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, even, you know, doing video tapes at home or just doing, you know, like situps or pushups and things like that can help and that's good exercise as well.
L:  Yes.  
R:  So --
L:  I live in Seattle, so it doesn't get too cold but it rains a lot.
R:  Oh, but you have rain.
L:  Yeah, it rains all the time, so you just have to kind of get used to it and go out in the rain and not care about it, you know. 
R:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yuck.
L:  Otherwise it would be pretty miserable here. [COUGH]
R:  Yes, because there's not much to do there, right?  It's very small.
L:  No, actually Seattle is a really fun city.  I like it a lot.  It's, uh --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- uh, lots of interesting things going on, but, uh, it's very -- 
R:  Do you have ice skating there?  
L:  What's that?
R:  Do you have ice skating there?
L:  Yes, we have ice skating.  There's, ah, canoeing and skiing --
R:  That's good exercise.
L:  -- and kayaking and -- yeah.  Yeah.
R:  That's excellent exercise.
L:  Cross -- I got into cross country skiing this winter.  It's, uh, it's pretty fun.
R:  Yes, that's real good exercise.  
L:  Yeah.  It's cheap, too.  I mean, once you -- once you buy a pair of skis, like a pass for the whole winter is like thirty bucks, so -- 
R:  Really? 
L:  Um, yes.  You can just go any place you want.  It's really nice.  That's, you know, for cross country anyway, it's good.
R:  You mean skiing off the mountain.
L:  Yeah, not -- not downhill skiing.  Downhill skiing is expensive, but cross country is pretty cheap.
R:  Oh, okay.  You're talking about cross country.
L:  Right.
R:  Okay.
L:  Right.
R:  Right.  But that's very good exercise.
L:  Yeah, it's really good exercise.
R:  Yeah, because that's a lot of cardio and you're working your arms and legs and everything.
