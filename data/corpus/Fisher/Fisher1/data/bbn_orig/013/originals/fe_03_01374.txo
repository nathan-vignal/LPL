L:  Hello.
R:  Hello! Uh, what's this about?
L:  I think it said, um, do you think the government has the right to prevent students from reading certain books in school?
R:  Okay.  Um, when I picked up the phone there was a recording already in progress.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, uh --
L:  Did -- did you -- did you --
R:  I -- I -- I don't know whether this is, uh, some sort of polling outfit or -- or what?
L:  Okay.  Well, I knew what was going on because I had signed up for it.  It's a -- it's like a study, a research study type thing, and I think it's to, um, uh, to learn how people, I don't know, communicate or something, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And so they just present a topic and then --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- we're supposed to like, talk about it for ten minutes or something like that.
R:  Oh, that's -- that's okay.  Are -- are they paying you for it?
L:  Yeah.  It's like -- supposed to be ten dollars a call.
R:  Oh.  Um --
L:  Did you not sign up for this?  Or ?
R:  I don't know exactly what's --
L:  Not sure?
R:  -- going on with it but, uh, it's quite possible that someone else here did.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, I'll just go ahead with it.
L:  Okay.
R:  Uh, regarding the -- the, uh, school book issue, uh, I used to be a teacher out in California, so I have a --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- a bit of a bias on that.
L:  Well, you come and -- yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well that's interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So what do you think?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, I think that at the college level --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there should be no censorship whatsoever, you know, you're -- you know, by the time you get to college you're on your own and you -- you make your own choices.
L:  Right.
R:  But for the elementary school and the high school levels, uh, yeah, gradually you have to open it up and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you have to realize that kids are curious about what they're curious about --
L:  Mhm.
R:  --and they should at least be able to get the truth about things.
L:  Mhm.  So do you think any topic is -- is okay as long as it's age appropriate, or do you think there are just some topics that should be prohibited, depending on the age, or ?
R:  Well, I think that some topics are not age appropriate.
L:  Yeah, well, uh, yeah.
R:  But, uh, you know, as far as, you know, as far as for an adult, I would say no censorship whatsoever and I would consider college students to be effectively adults, even though they're [LAUGH] don't really show up much maturity yet.
L:  No, it usually takes a few more years than 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, you know, y- you have to pretty much, uh, say, "Okay, this is where the line is".
L:  Mhm.
R:  You -- you get out of high school, you go into college, you're -- you're an adult for general purposes.  So, uh, the whole point of college is to be able to study anything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And hopefully to find out what the truth about things is.
L:  N- what grade did you teach, or what did you teach?
R:  Uh, I worked as a sub so I covered a lot of grades but I tended to specialize around, uh, uh, twelfth grade, uh, tenth grade, uh, history, civics, things of that nature.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So you dealt with the older kids then?
R:  Yeah.  Um, when you're dealing with the, uh, high school population, you're dealing with people that can actually handle some fairly complex ideas.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, they should be given the opportunity to.  You're also dealing with, uh, quite a few people who are not mature enough to find a floor with their hat!
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]  So, they have to be protected to some extent.  But, uh, I think as far as censorship, that's a bad word.  Um, making available, uh, things, you know, being discreet in what you make available is, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is okay.  Now, you --
L:  Well, do you think it's the government, 'cause that was, I think, the question?  Does the government?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Should they be determining that?  Or do you think that should be someone else's?
R:  [COUGH]  Well, that gets into a very interesting thing because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a local school board is, in essence, part of a government.
L:  Yeah, the local government, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So it's, at what level do you want it to go?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now, I would say that the -- at the federal level they should stay out of it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And at the state level, uh, they should set the curriculum and, you know, the minimum standards for graduation from one grade to the next --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and possibly some standardized testing along those lines.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH]  But as far as what goes in the library and, you know, somebody gets a little wild here and wants to ban Huck Finn or something like that, I think that's ridiculous!
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  You know.
L:  Do you think kind of local communities should decide for their -- for themselves as to what they wanna allow --
R:  [SIGH]  Well --
L:  -- and not allow, or 
R:  -- you know, there's -- there's always gotta be a balance between, uh, local community and national community --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the individual's rights.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, you know, kids basically are learning how to handle their rights, so they're not really competent yet.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now, I wouldn't wanna hand Machiavelli to a third grader.  Uh, he might get some ideas.
L:  [MN]
R:  But he may remember what they are.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'd be a little reluctant to hand it to a middle school kid.
L:  Now, what book are you talking about?
R:  Uh, Nicola Machiavelli, The Prince.  Uh, this is a politics down and dirty from the, uh, Italian, uh, renaissance area.
L:  Oh.
R:  Uh, he's -- he's the guy that advocates the idea that the government, the prince --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- has to be above public morality because he has much more responsibilities.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And he was actually writing for an audience of princes, so he was, you know, telling them what they wanted to hear so they'd pay him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it's a -- it's a classic in political thought.  Now, it's also, uh, amoral, you know, to the point of being, oh, you know, you don't -- you're not too sure you wanna turn this kinda ideal loose on -- on undeveloped minds.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, Carl Marx, uh, has done, in his book on --
L:  That's psychologist isn't it?
R:  Uh, um, no.  Freud was the psychol- psychology guy.
L:  I just remember -- I remember that name sounds familiar from when I had a psychology class.  Marx, or 
R:  Well, he was involved with that too but he was basically in c- in, uh, communism.
L:  Okay.
R:  You know, he did some -- he was a German guy and did some work, uh, beautiful work, in economic theory regarding the uses of capital, money.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then the, uh, the communist party formed using his ideas and -- and Lenin was the more political one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But the ideology was Marxist.  It's like saying American political thought that the ideology is Adam Smith's, um, uh, wealth of nations or something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which is capitalism.  And it -- it -- you know, you pretty much like to contrast 'em.  But, if you turn [SIGH] something like that loose on a high school kid that is against the control elements in his own society --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're liable to hook onto anything that's against what they're against.
L:  And just gonna run with it and 
R:  Yeah and -- yeah.  And this is why --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know -- you get your Russian teenagers would -- would advocate capitalistic ideas just because their --
L:  They're against communism, yeah.
R:  -- parents were communists!  [LAUGH]  You know, it had nothing to do with the rightness or wrongness of the -- of the system.
L:  It just serves their purpose at that time, so 
R:  Yeah, well, you know, kids wanna rebel and they'll rebel against whatever they've got --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to rebel against.  So, you know, you can't really take 'em too seriously.  But this is how they learn to be serious.
L:  Yeah, but also, I guess censorship kinda promotes rebellion too, don't you think?
R:  Well, yeah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- forbidden fruit tastes sweeter and all that stuff.  And if --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you can't, you know, if you can't get good biological information without a lot of +foof around school --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you're gonna wind up doing your research in Playboy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which, uh, you know, for adults is one thing but for -- for kids it's, um, you know too much fantasy and not enough reality!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Don't you find though today, that kids know, I mean, a lot more now at younger ages than what they, you know --
R:  Well, they --
L:  -- used to?
R:  They have access to a lot more.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And their ability to tell the truth from -- from the fantasy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is -- is not well developed.  When you see stuff over and over and over and over again on television --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you start considering it real because you've seen it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  While, in real life you're probably not gonna see it that often.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  Um, I've seen lots of -- lot of crime shows on TV but the -- you know, actually seeing people getting shot on the street, that's pretty rare.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  You know.
L:  Well, I guess some young minds can't discern necessarily, or just 
R:  Yeah.  And, you know, it's -- it's kinda strange because the -- the violence that you have on TV is sanitized and when you run into the real stuff, if all you've known is what's on television --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you don't know what reality is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, you can't cope with it.  [LIPSMACK] You have people go into the military and they take basic training and they get out on the rifle range, they learn how to shoot.  You get 'em in combat and the first time they see actual blood --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- coming out of somebody --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're worthless.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  You know?  I mean, these are guys that can't wring a chicken's neck and cook it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, there is something basically off there because they haven't been taught the reality --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of what life and death is about.
L:  Yeah.  It's kinda --
R:  Most of 'em -- most of 'em learn about morality from their friends being in car wrecks!
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  This is, you know, it's strange.
L:  Another thing with the military, it's kinda been glorified and idealized and 
R:  [SIGH]  Well, it's, uh, it's done for a purpose and the purpose generally boils down to keeping as many of your troops alive as possible and winning.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, what we've seen in the Iraqi situation has been probably the cleanest war we've ever been in, as far as our own casualties are concerned.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, [SIGH] you know, it's -- it's kind of a good feeling that the -- the government now cares that much about the individual troop that they try to protect 'em.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think that comes with, you know, you -- you pay 'em a lot more, you train 'em a lot more, they become more valuable.  You don't just send 'em out there with a gun and say, you know, "If you come back, we'll pay ya", uh, which is the way it was for many years.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, um, I've been monopolizing the conversation, what's your thoughts on it?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's okay, I'm learning stuff here!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I don't know.  I mean, y- you know, a lot of what you said I pretty much, you know, agreed with.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's all kind of -- really, it's all kind of relative.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Each situation is individual and, you know, depending on the age of the child, you know, what grade they're in and -- and really, you know, their level of maturity, I think that just kinda depends.  But I don't think you can really just put a -- a blanket censorship necessarily on, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on things.  I think 
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's why I think it has to somewhat still stay in -- in the hands of the parents or the -- just the local community 'cause you have to take individual --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, situations --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and people into consideration when deciding --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what they need to be exposed to or what needs to be made available to them and stuff.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  There is always a dynamic tension between
