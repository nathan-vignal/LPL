R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  How you doing?
L:  Good.  My name's Melissa.
R:  Mine's Rick.
L:  Rick?  Okay, um, I definitely do not think that five dollars and fifteen cents is appropriate for minimum wage.
R:  Well, I agree.
L:  [NOISE] Um, why?
R:  Well, because, uh, it's not enough to get by on nowadays.
L:  I agree.
R:  I mean, if you've got kids and, you know, any type of life, you got -- you can't afford to live on that.
L:  Uh, well, I live in California and you -- there's no way working two jobs you could pay your rent.
R:  Yeah, I live in Maine, but it's a li- -- probably a little less to live up here, but things, y- you know, we -- things are probably a little more expensive in certain areas but other -- you know, then some things you've got are probably a little cheaper and some things I got are probably a little cheaper, you know.  Just depends.
L:  I don't think California knows the word cheap. [LAUGH]
R:  Huh?
L:  I don't think California knows the word cheap.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  At least not this area.
R:  Are you in the warm part?
L:  Yeah, I'm down in Southern California.
R:  So, you don't have to pay for oil. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's true.  That's true.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But we do have to pay for gas to get everywhere.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  So, which, you know, is another thing with that minimum wage, you can't afford the gas, especially now, to get to your job.
R:  Yeah.  They've --
L:  To try to pay your rent [LAUGH] and feed your kids.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, um --
L:  I mean, I have three kids and there's no way --
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  -- as a single parent.
R:  I got three kids.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  I'm not a single parent, but I got three kids.
L:  Oh.  Right, and see, as a single parent, to go to work I need childcare. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the childcare, uh, is unbelievable, so ... just the whole thing.  There's no way.
R:  Uh, well --
L:  I mean, I think skilled labor out here are paying eight dollars, and I think that's n- -- low for even a -- a minimum wage.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I'm a truck driver so I'm almost double minimum wage, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh.  Long distance?
R:  Huh?
L:  Long distance?
R:  No, um, I've been -- the past three years I've been doing local.
L:  Oh. [NOISE]
R:  But I was long distance before that.
L:  My daughter's father was doing long distance, and then the weather went crazy and they stopped. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... but, uh, let's see, why else isn't that a good minimum wage?  I mean, out here we have so many, uh, migrant workers.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, they'll work for even less than that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  Well, here we got people coming in from Canada.
L:  Uh.
R:  And they take a lot of jobs, you know, so -- 'cause they can do it a lot less.  They take their American money, bring it up there and [inaudible] -- they get a dollar forty on our dollar.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah.  There's this, um --
R:  So, they get a forty percent increase right off the top.
L:  But just five dollars an hour, that's just ridic- -- uh, five fifteen is absolutely ridiculous.  It's -- I can't even imagine trying to live off that.
R:  Well, that's the state minimum wage.  I -- I think ours is a little higher than that, but ...
L:  I thought ours was, too.
R:  I think ours is, like, five eighty five or something like that.
L:  Yeah, that's what I thought.
R:  But --
L:  Something like that, but --
R:  I know it's -- I know it's more than five fifteen, but ...
L:  Still.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know, it's still not hitting the six dollar mark, and if you have to pay for your own healthcare.
R:  Yeah, which I do, yeah.
L:  Yeah, you can't, not on five dollars.
R:  I -- we struggle now and I -- I make -- like I said, I make almost double that, so ... I don't know, some people can do it.
L:  Are you a homeowner?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, see, I bet you're really having a hard time with that. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I also own an apartment house, so that helps, too.
L:  Oh, yeah, well, that would.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That definitely would.
R:  But I mean, that just gives me a lot more bills, too, so ...
L:  Well, that's -- well, I guess. [LAUGH] I wouldn't know, but do you have a problem with people being able to pay the rent?
R:  Um, a little bit once in a while.  Not -- not too often.
L:  See, they're making five fifteen an hour. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Actually there ain't too many people up here that does make minimum wage.  Most of our jobs do pay more, but [SIGH] um --
L:  So, you have a lot of fishing industry up there, don't you?
R:  Um, uh --
L:  Are you not -- not that close --
R:  Not -- not real -- real drastic.  I mean, there is a little bit.  Most is lo- -- most of the fishing's more like lobster.
L:  Oh.
R:  Everybody wants the Maine lobster, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  Not me. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Sorry. [LAUGH] No offence.
R:  [LAUGH] But, um, from what I hear they're not doing so well neither, so ...
L:  No, I don't think anybody is.
R:  Well, this is my first survey, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Me too.  Me too.
R:  I was on hold, like, at least a half hour.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Waiting for them to find somebody else.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, see, they called me a little while ago and --
R:  And you hung up? [LAUGH]
L:  No, actually, um, I wasn't here.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Well, they kept giving me the option of pressing tilde and they might call me back later.  And I was like, "No way". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause I don't wanna answer.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, I mean, the minimum wage does not reflect the economy.  It's that simple.
R:  Yeah, it doesn't.
L:  And then --
R:  And then -- and then we turn around and we support people that we -- we're -- we're gonna bomb.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, it's like, "Oh, why don't we just use the money here instead of there?" you know?
L:  We have so many homeless --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, we have so many street people here.
R:  I've always said that.  I've always said that we should help our own and not send money everywhere else.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you get those people over there that are having, you know, ten, twelve kids, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  And then they -- they can't even afford one.  But I don't know, it's -- I guess that's none of my business what they do, [NOISE] but ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] But I'm against helping other people until we help ourself first.
L:  Right.
R:  Well, and that minimum wage doesn't help us.  It's helping [LAUGH] everybody else, I guess.
L:  Well, I think that they're actually getting more [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- than we would get working at minimum wage, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they just -- I mean, our state just slaughtered our school and, you know, here's the President saying he's gonna give more money to schools, but the state here is saying take it from the schools first.  And they're -- they're thinking about cutting back school hours and school days so they don't go as of- -- as long.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I -- what does that do?
R:  They're talking about adding more to ours. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well, there you go. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, they just --
L:  Well, now I know where ours is going.
R:  Our town just built a brand new school, so our taxes just tripled, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  But ...
L:  Wow.  Well, I guess there you're probably in the same boat then, that people couldn't live off minimum wage.
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't know how they do it, the people that live around here.  Uh, I think most of the minimum wage people up here are, like, teenagers still going to school.
L:  Oh.
R:  I think if, you know, if they're out of school and working and living, I think they're making more than that.  But I think it's the teenage kids that are taking the jobs that are minimum wage.
L:  Well, do you think there's more work there that's higher paying?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or it's about equal?
R:  I think there is.  Um, I don't really hear too many people that are getting paid under six.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ... I mean, our -- our little convenience stores --
L:  Yeah, I -- I think minimum wage --
R:  -- our little convenience stores usually start around six fifteen, seven, you know, somewhere in that area.
L:  It's probably, like, the fast food.
R:  Yeah, like Wendy's, McDonalds, you know, the malls.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The mall type -- you know, younger kids that are part time and stuff like that.  I think they're somewhere around minimum wage.
L:  Well, I guess they could survive, but they would have somebody else supporting them.
R:  Yeah, exactly, yeah.
L:  You know, there's a -- a family.
R:  Contributing to the household, yeah.
L:  But a -- a family couldn't live on it.
R:  Hm.
L:  Even with two parents or two people, I would say, even if they don't have kids.  If they were both making mi- minimum wage, they still wouldn't be able to --
R:  No, I don't -- I don't see it.
L:  -- have a household.
R:  I don't see it. [LAUGH] I mean, if they didn't have kids it would be easier, but who doesn't wanna not have ki- -- you know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, that's just ...
L:  Well, that's my opinion, but ... [LAUGH]
R:  It's like the, um, minimum wage goes up so slow as to where the cost of living for, like, a union goes up, like, three percent a year.  The minimum wage doesn't even come close.
L:  Oh, pshaw.
R:  You know, so it's like the union people are getting a lot more a lot faster.  So, they ought -- I think they oughta set it up so it goes up, you know, with, you know, the cost of living, which I don't think it is.
L:  I think my last minimum wage job was in the mid eighties, and I started, like, three -- I mean, um, five thirty five, I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, so [LAUGH] that shows the minimum wage isn't moving much, even if ours now is, like, five eighty five or something.  I- it still hasn't even gone up a dollar.
R:  Yeah.  See, up here I --
L:  You know, that's ten years.
R:  Up --
L:  That's fifteen years.
R:  Yeah.  I haven't -- I didn't -- I never started a job like that.  When I -- what I did was when I got out of school I did a job -- I got -- I started right into sheet rocking, so I started right off at seven, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I never, you know -- I've never actually had anything under seven, but ...
L:  Oh, well, when -- when I had minimum job -- minimum wage jobs I had three.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I had a young child so he had to come to work with me.
R:  That must have been rough.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] it was.  It was, but that was the only way to survive, so ...
R:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, like I said, we struggle and I -- you know, I don't make -- I don't get paid that bad 'cause I do a lot of overtime --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, which is time and a half, so I couldn't survive if we didn't -- if I didn't do overtime.
L:  Does your partner work?
