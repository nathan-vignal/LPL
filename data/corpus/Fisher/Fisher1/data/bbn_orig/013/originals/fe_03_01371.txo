L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  I'm Ki-
R:  Hi.
L:  Sorry!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Sorry!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, I'm Becky, what's your name?
L:  My name is Tanya.
R:  Tanya, I'm gon- um, um, I'm sorry, I didn't hear the topic.
L:  It's, do you think that public and or private schools --
R:  Private schools.
L:  -- have the right to ban reading a certain book?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, my goodness!
L:  What do you think?
R:  Um, I don't know.  I -- I'm kinda open to it.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I don't --
L:  I don't think the schools should have that much carte blanche.
R:  [MN]
L:  But then again, that's why I home school!  So -- [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, you home school?
L:  Yeah.  I think the parents should -- be -- have the --
R:  B- b-
L:  -- final veto power.
R:  Yeah, they should have the right [LAUGH] to ban certain books!
L:  I mean, just because the school thinks that, you know, the -- the students should or should not read the book doesn't mean the parents' going to agree.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  The parent may want the child to read that book.
R:  Yeah, I think the parents should have the -- more of the say so than the school, also.  Oh, because, uh, I do remember my daughter in the fifth grade brung[?] some books that they were te- uh, teaching the sexual education out of, and that p- particular time we didn't -- we usually -- we usually get a letter, you know, saying, "Is it okay to -- for your child to, you know, get this book?"  Or, "We're teaching this and --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- how do you feel?" or whatever.  But we didn't get it and when, um, she brung it home and I looked at it, I could not believe it.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah.  Um, like -- li-
R:  For her -- because her age group and, you know, I just thought it was a little much.  So 
L:  Well, I don't blame you there.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Luckily I home school.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'll have -- I'll have complete and utter control over what my child reads.
R:  Yes.  I think that -- I think that home schooling is a good -- is a great idea.  And if you can do it, I think that's a good id- that's a blessing.
L:  I think he thinks so too.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  How old is your child that you're home schooling?
L:  He will be six in June.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  All right.
L:  We're going to learn -- speaking of reading, we're going to learn how to do that this summer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, that's good.  Well, you know definitely you'll have control over what he's seeing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Most definitely.
R:  Yeah.  Well  mm, well, I don't know about the school having the -- the right to do that, I think you're right about the parents having the more of the authority.
L:  The final say so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Most definitely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, if it's a book that the school has banned then the parent, you know, should -- should know -- have that list anyway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So if they want them to still read it they can read it at home.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, I do think that the parents should have the final veto.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Especially in the, "You're not allowed to read".  For whatever reason.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  I mean, I know, um, [LIPSMACK] my former sister in law for example --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- does not allow her children to read anything Harry Potter.
R:  Oh, I don't either.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Because of the witchcraft thing.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um 
R:  Uh huh. 
L:  [LIPSMACK]  You know.  So 
R:  I don't either.  I -- I'm -- I -- I know.  I have small ki- well, I have older kids and small kids but I'm -- I really -- but I prefer my kids not to do the Harry Potter thing either.
L:  And see, and what gets me is, she allows 'em to do Power Rangers.
R:  Oh, really!  [LAUGH]
L:  Why one and not the other?
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  I mean, if you're gonna ban f- witchcraft, ban it from morphism too!
R:  Yeah, that's true.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I know I might be there but 
R:  No.
L:  Uh --
R:  And I guess it -- 'cause of that -- yeah, I guess it's something like, you know, the -- the issue about the praying in school and it's, you know, it's up right there with the books -- the books and stuff like -- like that.
L:  Oh, I know.  Well, I take my son up to the school for, um, [LIPSMACK] speech therapy.
R:  Oh yeah?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  And, uh, and the kids there are reading the Harry Potters.  You know, they have 'em there in the public school library.
R:  Oh!
L:  So, um  and they're -- they're -- if I'm not mistaken, they are also on the SARs.
R:  Hm.
L:  You know, that accelerated reading thing?
R:  Uh huh.
L:  They're -- the Harry Potters are listed in there too.  They're like, um, I don't know, ten, fifteen points or something.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah, because they're a chapter book.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause my son is in his -- the seventh grade and he brings the -- well, he -- it's not on his list.
L:  It's in the main list.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I'm -- I'm guessing that they're all the same pretty much, from state to state.
R:  Probably, yeah, pro-
L:  I mean, because SARs have -- have their own website.
R:  Yeah.  What --
L:  Um --
R:  Where are you, uh, located?
L:  Virginia.
R:  Oh, okay, and I'm in Texas.
L:  Mm.  And, um, there were quite a few books on the -- on the SAR that I thought, you know, I mean, well, the school that I take my son to only goes up to the fifth grade.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I would -- I was thinking, you know, Harry Potter was a little  too, um  too advanced for fifth grade.
R:  Yeah, for the -- yeah.  High for --
L:  But apparently not!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, if they have it [LAUGH] out there.
L:  I guess it depends on the fifth grader!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Well, how did you find out about this survey?
L:  Um, I am with Money Shopping Group for, um, secret shoppers.
R:  Oh, okay.  I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I, uh, yeah, I do that too.  I do, um, right now I do the, um, um, apartments.
L:  Uh huh.
R:  [MN]  Right now I -- I'm doing some stores and stuff like that.
L:  I had -- this -- I've done this, um, [LIPSMACK] and a couple of other little survey things, uh, but I live in a real rural area.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  And so, um, a lot of the shops are too far!
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, for me.  I mean, 'cause I'm -- I'm an hour  I'm an hour and a half south of Richmond and an hour and a half north of Rowley.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]  And there's not a whole lot in between.  And then there -- was it last week?  I came across one but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it was that day!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And my day was booked!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And I -- I've got some bank shops too and th- those were pretty good.  'Cause, you see, I'm real close to Houston, I'm outside of Houston.
L:  Uh huh.
R:  And, uh, those bank shops are pretty good 'cause they -- if you do it last minute they pay you forty five dollars a sh- a --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, a shop.  So, it's pretty good.  I've only been -- been doing it for, uh, uh, two months.
L:  I signed up -- let's see, I signed up back in January.  In, um, mid January I think it was, and then things got away from me for a month or so.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Oh.
L:  And I signed up at about a half a dozen, um, different sites.
R:  Yeah, I did the same.
L:  And, um, and a couple of groups.  Well, of course, naturally one for North Carolina and one Virginia.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Um 
R:  Well, i- you should try to find the il- i- the idea lady dot com.
L:  Idea lady dot com?
R:  Mhm.  And she wrote that book, uh, The Mystery Shopper's Manual.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] I went to her seminar, 'cause she's kinda local.
L:  Oh.
R:  She's in, well, not that far from me, and I went to a seminar that she had and it was -- it was pretty good.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, and I was all excited 'cause I got a chance to meet the lady that actually wrote the book [LAUGH] you know!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Anyway, try that -- that website, it -- it has a lot of good information on it.  [NOISE]
L:  It's, uh, it's like, man!  And I keep thinking, you know, well, maybe whenever I go on one of these little trips with my mom or something I'll [LAUGH] --
R:  You'll do 'em.
L:  I'll be able to get one 'cause then you know, of course, we go different places.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- better cities, and I might actually have a chance of -- of finding something that I can do while I'm there.  So 
R:  Well, there's not any appointments or anything close to you?
L:  [SIGH]  No, not with everything.  You see, e- pretty much whatever is really close to me is rural, like I am.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  Um 
R:  So in those big -- [inaudible] stores and that's the [several inaudible words]?  'Cause I mean, I get ema- I get so many emails about different things --
L:  And then the one that was right here in town --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]  I needed a digital camera for!
R:  Oh!
L:  [LAUGH]  -- and I didn't have one!
R:  They send me, uh, those like that and I -- I forgot the name of that, uh, company that wants you to do that.
L:  I know.  They -- they've had a couple and they've had a couple right here in my town, I mean, just ten minutes up the road, you know?
R:  Uh huh.
L:  And of course I don't have a digital camera.  Now, my husband, instead of farting around, I have a feeling he's gonna come home from this road trip with a digital camera.
R:  Oh, that'll be good.
L:  And if he does then, then I will be able to do some of those.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  Well, see, I get a -- a -- a lot of emails with a lot of -- a lot of the farmers but, um, I work and I do that, you know, part time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Know, whenever I get a chance, because when I first started -- signed up for it, it -- uh, a couple of months ago, I wasn't working.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Ah.
R:  And I was just -- and I was just going to do the, you know, the shopping.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But then I --
L:  You know, I am a stay at home mom, who home schools.
R:  Oh, well that -- that is so good.  That's gonna be real good for your kid.
L:  Oh yeah.  He just has himself a blast.
