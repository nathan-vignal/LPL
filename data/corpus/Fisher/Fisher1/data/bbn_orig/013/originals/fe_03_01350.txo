L:  Hi, I’m Cheryl.
R:  I’m Lana.
L:  Lana?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Hi, Lana, nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you too.
L:  What did the thing say, if they had to, um, require students to read certain books?
R:  I think that’s what it said.  I couldn’t really understand it.
L:  No, it sorta talked too fast.  But I guess we could act on that presumption.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  And then, uh, my husband answered it first and he said, uh, it was talking about censorship.
R:  Yes.  [MN]
L:  Okay.  Uh, what did you understand from that, because I didn’t answer it first.  I didn’t --
R:  All it said was just censorship and then …
L:  Okay.
R:  -- about the books.
L:  Okay.  So, um, it wants us to talk about required reading?  And I guess, uh, censorship, it thinks, uh, we should say whether someone should have to read material …  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, well, I guess like, certain books that they make you read -- they would make them read.
L:  Yeah, like a reading list in school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because otherwise how are you gonna know what to read?  I know … think about some things that --
R:   Well, I mean --
L:   -- are controversial that they don’t -- they always complain about like, um --
R:  Harry Potter and …
L:  Well, that --
R:  Like those?
L:  -- for one thing.  Or things like -- older things like To Kill A Mocking Bird.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Whenever that comes up on a list there’s always some people that are like, not wanting people to read it because of the racial things in that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  And then, I personally did nine years in library service.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I don’t think that anybody can tell anybody what not to read.
L:  I agree with that because …
R:  You know?  I mean, even including -- you can ask my mom -- what necessarily your parents -- if you wanna read something -- because she took Gone With The Wind away from me when I was eight, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I didn’t appreciate it and she never had any success at -- at controlling what I read.
R:  Right.
L:  Because I just went to the library and read it in installments.
R:  I mean, it’s better than watching TV, the things that they see on TV anyway.
L:  Yeah, I don’t think anybody has the right to tell +anybodys what they should or should or should not consume.  But as far as like, reading lists in classes because they were gonna be on a topic and we need to hear how you feel about things like, say, Golding, Lord Of The Flies, that’s a controversial book.  I can’t discuss the Rowling books with you because I haven’t read those.
R:  I haven’t either.
L:  You know?
R:  Mm.
L:  But, um, are people against those because they have elements of, uh, say, mysticism or magic or supernatural things?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Those are things that also …
R:  But some kids --
L:   -- incite or excite people.
R:   Right.  But some kids just really -- they enjoy reading things like that.  And --
L:  Well, they sure do.  And, you know, they -- on the one hand people kinda wanna protect ‘em while they think they’re vulnerable and their -- their minds are growing and everything, and they’re afraid of certain topics, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I might be inclined to think, if I had children, that books with say, sexual content --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- would disturb me for certain ages.  I would wonder what was appropriate.  But again, like I said, you know, they had no luck controlling what I read when I was a kid.
R:  Right.
L:  And when I was a librarian, I never tried to tell anyone …
R:  So they can’t read --
L:  That they oughtn’t, you know.  What I would tell parents, and I did in childrens services specifically [NOISE] was that they should read the material themselves and see just how uncomfortable they were with it.
R:  Yeah, I agree with that.  The parents should read it.
L:  They should read pretty much everything their kids read.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then let the kid have a chance to decide.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.
R:  And if they --
L:  You can’t control what’s in another person’s mind.  And then people read and write and it’s a way that we have of [NOISE] communicating and understanding one another.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And experiencing ideas and places that you might never get to go or be otherwise, except for in the pages of a book.  [NOISE]  So I’m totally like, let’s not censor, you know.
R:  I agree with that too.
L:  But I’m not a parent.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Are you?  You -- I hear a baby.
R:  Yeah, I have a baby and a three year old.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So they’re not old enough yet to --
L:  So you wouldn’t -- but -- but you might have some ideas about how you’ll feel later?
R:  Well, I mean, um, I have a degree in early childhood education, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, as far as reading lists, I think … I mean, uh, I don’t really think that most books that are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- offered in a public school library would be …
L:  Really objectionable.  A lot of the things --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that people object to, they seem to be what we would -- might consider classics.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  Or some of -- some people who read would consider classics, but then some people are just afraid of ideas.
R:  Mhm.  Or else it --
L:  Some people are terrified of ideas.
R:  Well, I mean, like, the new, um, Harry Potter things.  If -- I think they think -- you -- as a parent you should talk to your child about it, about what’s real and what’s not.
L:  Right, exactly.  That’s -- that’s more like a discernment issue.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  And then kids, they do get, um, absorbed in things, you know.
R:  But it’s just like television, though.
L:  It is, and I’d prefer that they be absorbed in a book than flickering --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- images on a screen.
R:  Me too.
L:  You know?  Because at least they’re doing their reading skills and learning new words and stuff.
R:  And imaginations.  Their --
L:  I’m thinking, when I was a child and I read the Tolkien series for the first time, I was pretty captivated and I still enjoy it as an adult.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  But nobody ever tried to tell me I couldn’t have that!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?
R:  Mhm.  And that’s a fantasy.  But --
L:  Has anybody ever tried to keep anything from you?  Did your parents --
R:  No.
L:  -- let you read freely?
R:  No, they didn’t keep anything for -- from me.
L:  What part of the country are you in?
R:  Uh, I’m in Arkansas.
L:  Oh, okay, and I’m in Georgia, so we’re kind of in, sort of similar neighborhoods in a way, as far as, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- being in the bible belt.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  I’m not, um, I remember my mom taking Gone With The Wind away from me and then later she tried to take Summer of Forty Two, but I got it back.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And if you didn’t read that, that had -- that was probably about sexual content that she was disturbed.
R:  Hm.
L:  And then when you don’t understand things about it [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- about what you’re reading, as you’re reading it, it doesn’t do that much harm --
R:  Mm.
L:   [NOISE]  -- I don’t think.
R:  No.
L:  It didn’t hurt me, I mean, with that book, Summer of Forty Two.
R:  I mean, as long as it’s age appropriate.
L:  Yeah.  But these things were not regarded as age appropriate.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, that was -- that was probably why she was trying to protect me from that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because they were pretty mature.  I mean, Gone With The Wind for an eight year old, you know?
R: Yeah, true.
L:  She had some issues with that.  But I still -- I st- I went and got it, I slipped and read it anyway.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  At the public library.  Because I couldn’t stand it, I was halfway through it!
R:  Well, yeah, I m- once you get hooked in a book it’s hard to just put it down.
L:  It was really, really hard to keep me from reading.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  And -- and nobody does try any more of course, you know, I mean, I’m in my forties and nobody’s gonna try to tell me what to read and what not to read.
R:  [LAUGH]  Right.
L:  But it’s -- it’s difficult to control people and what’s in their minds.  I just think, having been a librarian I gotta -- I gotta say censorship is not the thing.
R:  Right.  And you know a lotta books.  You -- about a lot of ‘em.
L:  Um, I’ll -- I can say another one that gets on school reading lists, um, Huckleberry Finn.
R:  Mhm.
L:  People have a cow when that book comes up.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because of ethnic usage, you know?  And then maybe they don’t read it in context and realize exactly what Mark Twain was saying about how wrong he felt about how it was to treat other people differently because of the colors of their skin and everything, and he was very much against slavery.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But people that have not read his works would not realize that because he uses the N. word on a re- regular basis.
R:  Right.
L:  But that was common in his time.  It was -- it was kind of [NOISE] -- I don’t like to say appropriate, but it was what he knew.  [NOISE]  But if --
R:  Well, if --
L:  -- you ever read more about him [NOISE] and how he felt growing up seeing people for sale, he didn’t like it at all.
R:  Mhm.  But that’s the word that they used for it.
L:  That is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- exactly what they used for it.
R:  They didn’t change it to like …
L:  In that day in time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, when people were property.  When he was born, people were property.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, they did what they knew how to do then, and when -- when they learned better, they did better.  So, I like the topic of -- of censorship.  The other one I got -- is this your first call?
R:  Yes.
L:  Let’s see.  I got one more before about, um, your sources of news information.  And I had a interesting conversation with a woman from Vancouver.
R:  Mm?
L:  About, you know, different sources, where you gotten most of your news, if it was print or television media, or whatever, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And this was -- this was two and a half weeks ago, I think.  I -- I wrote it down, the date, and I don’t have that paper around me right now.  But the war was just starting to happen then too.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So we were both listening and reading plenty of news.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  Um, it wouldn’t be good for people to censor that kinda information and keep from us, which is like who’s to say they don’t to a degree?
R:  B- yeah, they do.
L:  I mean, I’m sure they have to edit --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what they put out, but it seems to me like we’re getting and awful, awful lotta information.  Does it seem like that to you?
R:  Yes.  More than what we should, I think.
