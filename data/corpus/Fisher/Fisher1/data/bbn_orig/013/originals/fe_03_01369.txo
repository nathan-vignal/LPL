L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  I'm Jessie.
L:  I'm Fred.
R:  Hi.
L:  Ah, so, no, I -- I don't think that they, ah, should be, ah, like made to read certain books, I guess. 
R:  Well, I guess it depends on what kind of book it is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, if it's really controversial, then -- I mean, if it's a public school then I don't think you should, but if it's a private school and there's a level of, mm -- well, yeah, it just depends on the topic of the book.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  I mean, let's say the topic is religion -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and if it's not a parochial school or any other religious institution, then I don't think you should be forced to read a certain book about a certain religion.
L:  Right.  I mean, [MN] yeah, I know -- I know like certain -- certain books are banned from, uh, from schools, you know, that, like, have a lot of, ah, I guess curse words in them or like, ah, -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't even know [LAUGH] actually what books are banned but [NOISE] I do remember in high school there being some books being banned and stuff and, um, [inaudible] it was just, you know, basically it went before some board or something, you know, and for some reason they just decided rather, I guess, oh, um, I don't know, I don't know exactly how they decide but they just decide, you know, to ban that book from [NOISE] -- from the reading list of a school and, I mean, you know, there are a few -- quite a few books that may be considered by, like, you know, conservative school board members to be inappropriate but, you know, that's like a conservative committee, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- who may decide something like that, so ... [NOISE]
R:  I guess it also depends on their community standards.
L:  Ahah.
R:  I mean, if you live somewhere in Kentucky where it's very religious and conservative, then, you know, the majority should be allowed to decide what books should be banned.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, a minority can't rule over the majority.
L:  No, that's true, but I mean ... yeah, I guess -- I guess especially with the reading [NOISE] assignment you, ah, [NOISE] you don't really have a choice as to what you're going to read, whereas if, you know, if you just give the students free rein to read what they like, [NOISE] you know, then -- then I would [NOISE] argue more against, you know, [NOISE] censorship and having a restricted list [NOISE] of what they could read, [NOISE] so ... [NOISE] but, uh, I grew up in, ah, [COUGH] you know, like the east coast, fairly liberal environment, you know, and even -- even so we still had certain books that were not, you know, on the reading list or -- or I guess the other -- the other thing is that, you know, they're also deemed to be not valuable, you know, educationally and whatnot.  Again, that's very subjective.
R:  It also depends if it's higher education.  For example, if you go to university -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and there's a purpose in reading that book for a certain class -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for example like race relations or something, I know there's a book called that N word and people -- it's very controversial. 
L:  Mm.  I haven't heard of that book.
R:  Oh, it's not called the N word, but I'm just saying it's -- 
L:  Oh, oh, oh. [MN] 
R:  -- I know it's the N word.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, I guess I have heard of that, yeah.  Um, yeah, but it's really just the title that's controversial, I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... um, I don't know. 
R:  Well, ten minutes seems a lot.
L:  [LAUGH]  It does, um, hm.  I'm trying to think of, like, books that I've read recently, you know, that could be considered controversial, um -- 
R:  I guess Harry Potter in elementary schools -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- some districts are banning it.
L:  Some -- some schools are banning it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [several inaudible words] because it's, um, -- 
R:  Like magic and sorcery.
L:  Yeah, magic and, uh, like a pagan kind of stuff -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or whatever? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Even, um, I guess, ah, what was that game?  It was popular a while back.
R:  The ouija board?
L:  Uh, no, not ouija.  It was with cards and, ah, -- Dungeons and Dragons.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, I think some schools banned that because, you know, they felt like there were some violent outbreaks or whatever at -- at certain schools related to that, um, [NOISE] so I mean, yeah.  [NOISE] Like, I -- you know, it's easy to say you're, ah, you can just have an open society and stuff like that, but then when you have books that, you know, that instruct people how to make bombs or -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] -- you know, things like that, you have to draw a line somewhere, too. Um, [NOISE] which is, you know, more of a general censorship kind of thing than just in schools [NOISE] and what students should be allowed to read, so ... 
R:  I mean, in an ideal world there should be free speech whatsoever, but -- 
L:  R- -- yeah.
R:  But considering we're not perfect human beings, there should be restrictions. [PAUSE]
L:  Yeah.  I -- I'm just curious as to how, uh, how it's decided, you know, in communities what books are able to be read by students and which ones aren't, or which, you know, are on the reading lists of assigned books if you -- if you have a summer off -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, what -- what books make it on the summer reading list ... um, you know, if it is in fact a community kind of decision, you know, like in Kentucky or wherever, you're talking about, you know, if the members of whatever committee, and I guess it's a committee, you know, that decides this kind of decision.  Maybe it's just, you know, the superintendent of schools, I really don't know, um, you know, how are the people who make that decision elected or, you know, appointed or whatever and it probably varies from place to place.
R:  I also think there should be options available.  I mean, if you are objecting to a certain book, then you should be able to read another book of equal literary merit.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I don't know how practical that is, considering public education and its current status.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, yeah, of course, and just the availability of books probably.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, mm.  Yeah, if you -- if you make, uh, every book or s- several books available, you're going to have to buy, you know, a different copy, many copies of different books.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ... mm.
R:  I mean, I get into arguments like this all the time, like free speech, flag burning -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- like the Nazi parade -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- stuff like that.
L:  You get what, email?
R:  No, I get like arguments -- 
L:  Oh, arguments.
R:  -- with, like, random people.
L:  Oh.  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, I don't really, uh, get into arguments about it with people, but I guess I'm not, uh, that -- that vocal about things either.  I mean, you know, I don't -- I don't think like the -- the KKK should have, you know, like free speech rights or anything, um, -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I know -- 
R:  I mean their --
L:  -- go ahead.  I'm sorry.
R:  Oh, their purpose of existence is like to incite violence and hatred, I mean -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- why should we protect their free speech? 
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, and -- 
R:  -- and flag burning, I mean it's not to that extremity but I mean it stands for a country and, like it or not, you live in this country, so, I mean, why burn it? 
L:  Right.  [PAUSE] Yeah, I don't know.  I think that that's -- I think it's, uh, you know, disrespectful and everything -- 
R:  [inaudible]
L:  But I do see, [NOISE] you know, it in the purpose of like protesting, I guess.
R:  Yeah.  It's one thing to protest and say the government is doing something wrong, but it's another to, like, outlandishly burn a flag.  I mean it represents a country,  it's like our history.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Mm.  So what do people usually argue on the side of? 
R:  That they should be given free speech.
L:  Yeah ... huh ... [MN] I guess there isn't much of a debate here -- uh ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I'm trying to think of -- 
R:  So where are you from?
L:  Uh, New Jersey.
R:  Ah.
