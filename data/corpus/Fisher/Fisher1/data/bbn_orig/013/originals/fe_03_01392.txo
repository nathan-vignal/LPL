L:  -- exercise, because I think exercise is having a part in -- 
R:  Hello?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yes.  Hi. 
L:  Hi. 
R:  And we're supposed to talk about exercise.
L:  Ahah.
R:  Okay.  And you are?
L:  Stephanie.
R:  Naida[?].  Okay.  Now, do you exercise?
L:  Um, I exercise to a, um, certain degree, I do.  
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  Sometimes I do exercise.
R:  Okay. [NOISE] Well, no, I don't, and, um, I did have a membership to a gym for [NOISE] two years --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and went once, and I went one time [NOISE] -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- [NOISE] so as far as exercise is concerned I really don't get a lot of it in, like on daily basis or anything like that, so, um, -- but as far as, um, walking, I do a lot of walking with work and stuff like that, but going to the gym, I don't get a lot of gym workout done.
L:  Right.  Okay.  I do walk.  I'm, I'm maybe -- yeah, I do walk, so walking is a part of exercise, so --
R:  Yeah, I mean it is, but -- 
L:  Walking and [LIPSMACK] maybe, um, just walk.  I do -- I do do a lot of walking, so I could say I do exercise, I do exercise.  [NOISE] Oh, I just say I do walk because it is healthy for you.
R:  Yeah, and the main form of exercise I get is just walking.  Um, I work a part -- a -- just a part time job at a department store and I walk like around, you know, just hanging up clothes and stuff like that, walking back and forth, so I do that.  Then I have a full time job [several inaudible words] in school so walking back and forth with school and stuff like that.  I mean, even when I'm like, say like today, you know, just get out and walk a little bit on my lunch break -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- do stuff like that, but as far as going into a gym and stuff like that, I really don't have time for it, um, but I was saying that even in -- in terms of exercise I would rather do something more like a karate or something that involves like other people.  Instead of like when you go to the gym and you are just like working out by yourself and everything, I would rather do something more interactive, [NOISE] like a karate or kick -- what is it -- the kick boxing course or something like that.
L:  Right.
R:  But, other than that, no.  So, I mean, I don't have time for it, but I would like to get, you know, when I do get the time to do, I would like to go to a gym and work out, um, and then I want to do something or go to a gym where they have like water aerobics because I can't swim and I want to learn how, so even with that, just doing the water aerobics in the water and stuff like that, I think that'll be fine.
L:  Right.  [SIGH] Um, --
R:  Now, what other forms of exercise do you get?  I mean it's just --
L:  Oh, what other form of exercise do I get. [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Hello?  Yes.
L:  I'm sorry, that's my box.  Um, I would just say basically I just -- the only thing I do is just walk, but if I could exercise I would just -- maybe I would just take up, um, [LIPSMACK] um, basketball or something, because basketball is a good exercise to take up, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because you're running, this is [inaudible] sweat, you take on a lot of, um, -- 
R:  I mean basketball is good, like, as far as cardio because it's good for your heart. 
L:  Right.
R:  So that would be good, um. I mean there are a lot of things that can be done and I don't think that, you know, just going into the gym is necessarily going to make someone healthy.  Um, I think it does have its -- have its benefit, but yet -- and still I mean, like, there are people that go to gyms and they have heart attacks, like on tread mills and stuff like that -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- so, just going to a gym does not -- does not necessitate or, ah, -- like -- like health or good health, I mean it doesn't -- you know what I mean -- make someone healthy to go to a gym.  But, um, as far as having all the equipment to work out every part of your body, they have that, but, other than that, I mean, [MN] if you can find something else a- as a more, as opposed to going to a gym, I would rather do that.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I mean, I like it, I like walking, I mean I get a lot of walking in and that's basically what [inaudible] 
L:  Okay.  Walking is the best exercise, so --
R:  Yeah, and I mean -- and I think then y- you can exercise all you want but it depends upon what are you putting into your body --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, so -- but, I mean, I don't eat health food and stuff like that.  I would like to, [NOISE] but I'm always going and I'm always on the run, so I just grab what I can and I'll have that, but, um, I think health foods are -- you know, something that's healthy is like very important because you defeat the whole purpose of, you know, exercising sometimes if you don't put the right things into your body.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I mean, but other than that, I mean that's what I -- I mean that's what I do, so if you were to work out, where would you work out at?
L:  If I was to exercise I would probably, um, I would just walk -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like I generally do walking because I think walking is the best exercise that you can do, because we do exercise, I do exercise.  Why do I walk?  Because it's good exercise and that's the best way to exercise, by walking, because you're stretching everything, your legs, your arms, your muscles, your mind and your body, you know? 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  That's the best exercise that you can do, by walking.
R:  Yeah.  That -- 
L:  Walking helps everything, your heart, your lungs, everything --  
R:  And if -- 
L:  -- in your body. 
R:  It really does.  I mean -- and it's really, you know, it's really good and it's -- 
L:  If you think about it, you don't need any machine or anything, cause basically your body is a machine -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- for you to exercise and walking is the best one -- 
R:  Yeah, walking is the b- --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  I mean, it is the best and, not only that, I mean you could do it with friends and stuff like that, I mean, so you can really get out a- a lot out of walking.  Even though with today being a nice day, just being out, being able to get out and take a walk, I mean is like really refreshing, you know?
L:  It is.
R:  Especially after being, like, in the house all winter long, you're like just [inaudible] because you can't really enjoy it -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and you didn't have -- really have the opportunity to get out and walk like you wanted to.  I mean -- and the only thing, [NOISE] I mean I'm pretty healthy and, you know, I'm like pretty fit or whatever, but the only thing that I would want to do if I had to do anything would be just to tone up my stomach.
L:  Okay.
R:  I mean, but that would be it -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- because I'm like pretty well fit and, I mean, I really don't need -- I mean I -- I feel like I really don't need to do anything right at -- right now.
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] So -- 
L:  If you did exercise every day, why would -- why do you exercise, if you did? 
R:  Why -- if I did, why do I exercise?  
L:  Right.
R:  Why would I?  I guess it would be for, um, -- [MN].  Actually, if I did do it every day, let's see.  I mean, basically I guess for -- for me I guess it would just be personal right now.  I mean I could say health but then I might, right now I might -- 
L:  It would just be for a goal, ah, or just for health reasons or just for -- just to -- 
R:  Probably for -- 
L:  -- have people just say, "Oh, this lady --" 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- exercise all the time".
R:  Yeah, I would say probably for a goal for me -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- at this point.  It would be just be for a goal, I mean now.  It would just be for a goal.  I mean just a personal goal.  I mean it wouldn't be for anybody else.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, of course it would help like with health and all that, but I mean -- and you need that and I'm, like, I'm pretty healthy but it would be for a personal goal, not for, um, you know, not just for somebody else to be like, "Oh, this person works out", you know. 
L:  Right.  Some people do it for men attention, you know.  Why do they, you know? 
R:  Yeah, see, and that's not me.  I'm like, I don't care and it's just like -- so it would just be personally for me.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  Because I feel like this.  What happens after you -- after you have done all that and if it's not for you, anyway, and it's not satisfying to you, it defeats the whole purpose.  I mean because who cares?  I mean they can walk away.  They can have like the perfect body and -- you know what I mean?
L:  Right.  If you're not exercising for yourself, then -- 
R:  Exactly.  
L:  -- what difference does it make? 
R:  Because not something --
L:  But a lot of people don't exercise for their self.  They do it for other people.
R:  Yeah, and it's not -- yeah, and who's to say that they're still going to be satisfied with the body that you get afterwards?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, so it has to be for you, it has to be something personal.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I take it more personal.  I'm like because I don't care.  As long as I'm happy with me, then that's all that matters, you know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I mean I've just always felt like that.  It doesn't matter how anybody else feels about me.  As long as I'm happy with my weight and stuff like that, I can say it doesn't matter.
L:  Yeah.  See, I would -- 
R:  I mean, even though I'm healthy and I'm fit -- 
L:  -- if I did exercise --
R:  -- you know stuff like that -- 
L:  I would exercise -- 
R:  -- I would just tone up my stomach, but it doesn't come from exercise, I guess -- 
L:  -- I'd do -- I would exercise for ga- --
R:  -- it's just because I have a fast metabolism.
L:  Right.  See, I d- -- I burn up a lot and I'm -- I'm a real small person so I -- when I -- if I did exercise, I wo- -- probably would burn off all my body fat because there's really that much not body fat on me, but if I did exercise, run and jog, I probably would sweat a lot and, you know, that is like when I eat, I don't gain no weight or anything, it's just s- -- that my body weight stays the same, so if I exercise it basically would be just for tone, it's not to lose weight, you know.  Some people exercise to lose weight, some people exercise to gain -- I mean like to lose it.  Some people do it to tone their bodies.  [PAUSE] Did we get clicked off?
