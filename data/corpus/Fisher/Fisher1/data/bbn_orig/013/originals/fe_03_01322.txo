R:  Hi, my name is Jacqueline.  I do believe that they should stop banning -- um, sorry, ban smoking from, um, as far as public places, restaurants and stuff like that.  Um, that would help people that -- that do smoke to -- that don't smoke to -- don't have to, um, ventilate all the a- -- um, you know, cigarette smokes and stuff that they do in a restaurant, so --
L:  Well --
R:  -- I think they should.
L:  I agree with you completely.  I'm a non smoker myself.  I'm Sean, by the way.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, uh, being a non smoker, I really don't appreciate having to smell that sometimes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you think, you know, that has got to help you -- that's gotta hinder your health as well just --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- just smelling that.  And I think especially with, uh, young children in place- -- in public places.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That we have to worry about them.  I don't know, what do you think about the -- the hotlines and things like that?
R:  The hotlines?
L:  I'm -- I've seen them here in Utah where they have, like, hotlines.  People who -- they treat it just like an addiction of anything, you know.  You can get, uh -- you can call for help if you have a smoking problem.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I think that's pretty good 'cause it helps, you know, people that are addicted to other types of drugs as well as cigarettes. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, so ...
L:  I mean, I think it's nice that it's now getting more attention as a real drug than it used to.
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  Uh, how --
R:  Are -- you're calling from the state of Utah?
L:  I am.
R:  Wow.  I'm in Georgia.
L:  In Georgia?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I have a roommate from there.  [SIGH] Um, and how -- how are the anti smoking laws in Georgia?
R:  Well, right now they, um, ban you from smoking in public places, so I don't know how the law is in Utah, but they just passed a law where you -- you can't smoke in public places in Georgia.
L:  That -- that's how it is in Utah, I believe.  At least every time I've gone into a restaurant I haven't seen any smoking.
R:  Yeah.  They just passed the law here in Georgia, so I think it's been passed now for about three months, so ...
L:  Was there a lot of opposition to it?
R:  No, not really.
L:  Not really?
R:  'Cause a lot of people opposed, you know, smoking in public places, and I was one of 'em, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's good.  Um ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Trying to think here. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, which places does that affect?  Does it -- uh, is it all public places?  Like, for example, does that affect, um, employ- -- uh, employers?
R:  Well, actually, what -- what happened is the -- the -- the -- the companies won't be, um, fined.  What they're doing now, they're just fining the people that are smoking.  That's what I was told, so ... it was on the news, so basically they've -- you know, they catch you smoking in public places they'll fine you.
L:  So, a public place could also be, like, a company?
R:  Like --
L:  Just like a private company?
R:  Yeah, like offices, um, restaurants and stuff like that.
L:  That's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Then it doesn't make it awkward for employees who don't want that.  They don't have to feel like they're -- they've -- they're -- they were risking their job --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in speaking up against that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  What -- how do you feel about, uh, how -- how effective do you think the -- the programs are for -- that are available for anti smoking, like, to help people stop smoking?
R:  How effective do I think of what now?
L:  Like, in the -- in the little prompt it talked about, uh, what we thought about pr- -- the -- the programs that are out there for -- that help people stop --
R:  Oh, you mean as far as, like, the nicotine patch and all that?  Well, [SIGH] mm, that's a good question.  I'm not a smoker, so I don't know.  Um, [NOISE] I think it's -- it's -- it's probably effective if you probably use it.  It -- you know, if you use it properly.  Um, hm, I haven't really gave it that much thought.  Um ...
L:  Yeah.  It -- th- this isn't something I've even much thought, too, either, being a non smoker.  And it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my family, no one in my family smokes.  Although my grandfather did smoke.
R:  Wow.
L:  He -- he quit but he went to chewing tobacco instead. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know what?  I see a lot of com- commercials -- they have a lot of campaign- campaigns on TV about, um, you know, like, um, like, what -- what can cause, you know, what -- what -- what's the leading cause of cancer, is from smoking and stuff like that.  Have you seen those commercials?
L:  I have.
R:  Yeah.  And they really talk about, you know, like, um, you know, a lot -- um, a lot of the tobacco companies are saying that, um, like, back in the early sixties that that was the main cause of people catching cancer.  And now, like, they did a recent survey with the same company, there's -- they're acting like they don't know what they're talking about as far as, you know, what they said about twenty years ago about tobacco, you know, is a -- is the main cause of cancer.  Have you heard that, um ...?
L:  I heard a little bit of these -- these studies.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, the same ways that you're -- like, through the TV and -- and through newspaper, and I think that's good that it's getting out there and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because it -- I think a lot of people saw s- smoking as it -- it wasn't a very serious thing and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and granted it's not as serious as some of these harder drugs, but I think it needs to be considered.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm -- I'm not talking about, like --
R:  Because some of the ingredients they put in cigarettes, you'd be amazed on what they put in there.  I mean, they were naming some of the stuff.  I can't remember exactly, but they put a lot of harmful stuff in there.  I mean, you know ... [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it sounds -- it's nasty that people are taking this in.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, yeah, it -- I -- I think through these, uh, through the education people are getting through some of these public advertisements, it will be good.
R:  And one thing I'm glad that they don't do any more is, like, um, basically market the cigarette brand.  Like, I used to see the cigarette brand, like, on, um, [LIPSMACK] like, at the -- at the -- at the gas station and stuff, they used to have, like, the -- the Salem -- um, like, the, um, the billboard or whatever.  But I don't see that any more like I used to, so I think that's a good thing as well.  So, they're not marketing it like they used to.  But now what I'm noticing is a lot of young teenagers now are smoking.  Have you noticed that in Utah?
L:  Um, I haven't noticed it so much in Utah.  I'm also --
R:  Okay.
L:  I'm -- I'm from Texas.  I'm going out to sch- -- I'm here at school.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  But I -- I have seen that in -- in Texas, and that's a little disconcerting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it -- it makes me wonder how effective is the -- the advertising campaigns 'cause I think now it's gotten to the point people know.  I mean, maybe in the sixties the -- the people didn't know how harmful it was.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And now it concerns me kids that -- that know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- exactly what they're taking into themselves.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- I guess you can't s- stop the -- the public awareness as saying, "Okay, well, then the commercials aren't doing it".  I think that's good so people know when it's on them this time.  Instead of as before smoking, um, we -- we have all these lawsuits against the cigarette companies saying, "You didn't tell us".  Now it's gonna h- -- people are gonna have to have -- take their own personal responsibility.  If their health gets messed up, they can't say, "No one told me that I was going to get cancer".
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  A- and I think that's a good thing.  We won't have any more of these lawsuits.  I don't -- not that I'm siding with the -- the cigarette companies saying that -- that they shouldn't be sued, because I think what they did was despicable --
R:  Now, have you -- have you ever been told that secondhand smoking is, uh -- is -- is -- is more serious than -- than a person that smokes -- that, you know, actually smokes a cigarette?  Have you ever been told that before or ...?
L:  I haven't.  Why would that be?
R:  Well, I'm not really sure, but I heard that before, that, like, secondhand smoke, if you're, like, inhaling a cigarette, it's more, um, dangerous than a person that's actually smoking the cigarette.
L:  Huh.
R:  Yeah, I heard that a lot of times, so --
L:  That's interesting.
R:  -- I don't know how -- I don't know how it -- how it's -- you know, how they came up with that, but I heard that before.
L:  I remember that -- I -- I -- I actually have heard that, thinking about it now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'm trying to remember the reason, and I can't off the top of my head.  And I think that's why they're passing all these laws.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's a --
R:  And then a lot of, uh -- I see a lot of, like, people smoke while they're pregnant and I think that is so disgusting.  I mean, how can you inhale all that sm- -- and that's -- that's -- that's -- that's -- that's -- I can't -- I can't imagine someone doing that.  I mean, it's like they don't have any consideration.  And it makes a lot of the kids that the parents that do smoke while they're pregnant, the kids have, like, defects and stuff when they're born, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so ...
L:  That's ... um, yeah, that's -- [SIGH] I -- I understand the whole personal choice thing.  I don't agree that people should treat their bodies that way.  I think, you know, our bodies are -- are a special thing and -- and people need to know that -- that what they're doing to themselves is bad, but people should not be allowed to hurt other people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, like they were talking a- about in the prompt, the -- the -- these laws against that, and I -- I'm -- I'm grateful for those. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Targeting a -- the -- the -- targeting that especially.  Getting out there and saying, "You c- -- you can hurt yourself, but you can't hurt other people".
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and what do you do for -- for pregnant women, then?  'Cause that -- you know, that's hurting someone else. [LAUGH]
R:  What can you do for pregnant women?
L:  Yeah.  I wonder what you can do for that, and say -- uh, make it against the law to smoke
