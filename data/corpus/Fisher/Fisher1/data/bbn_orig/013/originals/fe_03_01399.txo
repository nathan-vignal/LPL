L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name is Darlene.
R:  Hi, Darlene, and you're from?
L:  I'm from Georgia.  I'm in Deloof, Georgia.
R:  Oh, I'm -- I am all the way up north in Cleveland, Ohio.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, welcome.  I'm originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yes.
R:  So, you're familiar with the area.
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  How'd you first hear about this study?
L:  Actually I heard, uh, through a, um, shopping, um -- I do mystery shopping.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And there is a website and I heard about it there.
R:  Ah.  My friend in Colorado told me.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, when I got this call this evening I -- I remembered as to what it might be.
L:  Right.
R:  But anyway, um  --
L:  Well, this is my second time I've done this so I'm pretty excited.
R:  Yeah, me too.  I --
L:  Okay, cool.  It's all right.
R:  But anyway, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- exercising regularly.  I'm embarrassed to say that I haven't done it for a while, how about you?
L:  Well, guess what?  Me either.  But it's a very, uh, interesting topic.  I haven't exercised in a long time [LAUGH].
R:  Are you married with children?
L:  I am.  Married with children, I have three girls and a husband who, actually, exercises pretty often.
R:  Mine does too.  I am married with three children --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, one boy and two girls and I use the excuse that I'm too busy taking care of the kids --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to exercise.
L:  Yeah, which is not a good excuse, right?
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And my husband -- my husband exercises and --
L:  Isn't that something.
R:  -- I gained wei- -- I didn't weigh till after I had my third.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, for the last, I'd say -- I didn't gain weight till she was about two so the last five years or so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I've put on some weight that I'd never had before.  And, yes, I would --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like to take it off and get on a regular exercise --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- routine.  How about you?
L:  Mhm.  Oh  yeah, definitely, because as -- I'm forty so as I get older, you know what I mean, I -- I know exercising is very important.  And it's something that I need to start doing.
R:  Well, it doesn't get any easier.  I just turned forty four, my husband just turned forty --
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah.  The body changes, doesn't it?
L:  Yes, it does.  
R:  And my --
L:  I noticed that at forty.
R:  Uh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Abou- -- that -- that -- it doesn't get any easier and I don't -- have you ever tried -- I don't know if you -- if you are at an appropriate weight or not.
L:  No, I'm not.  I am overweight [LAUGH].
R:  I'm slight- -- I'm -- I would say I'm maybe twenty -- twenty or so pounds overweight at this point.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't -- hopefully not get any more but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, it's just the, um -- getting the momentum and finding the time to do it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I suppose if I weren't on the phone [LAUGH] I could probably go, uh, exercise but -- or take a walk or something during the day but, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And we do have exercise equipment at home.  Do you have exercise equipment at home?
L:  Ah, yes.  My husband he has weights, you know, at home --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I could use those.
R:  That's true.
L:  And should use those [LAUGH].
R:  We've got, uh, I think a nordic track?  We've got a nordic track --
L:  Mhm.  
R:  -- and then we got --
L:  Oh, do you really?
R:  -- yeah, and then we got one of those other things that you can do legless and those arms pulls.  It's like a total fitness thing.  So, we have two things, both of which are in our family room.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  We've a small house so there's no place to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- put anything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I guess I don't have any excuse.  We used to belong, before we had kids, we used to belong to the Belly Fitness Center, Fitness Center --
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  -- and would go on a regular basis to exercise.
L:  Right.
R:  Before you had kids did you do the same thing?
L:  Yes, definitely and, you know, I used to run and swim and, you know, do everything.  But, of course, that is no excuse.
R:  No.  I -- I guess it isn't.  Let's see I have -- let's see when I stop exercising?  Uh, I took pregnancy exercise classes.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I did exercise while I was pregnant which made the deliveries easier.
L:  Right.
R:  And after I had the babies I never got back to it.
L:  To it, yeah, I see that.  When I had my third one, I lost a lot of weight too.
R:  Uh, I lost a lot of weight, I lost not only my weight but -- my pregnancy weight but extra weight --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- besides that.  But then I don't know what it was at thirty eight, boom!  I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I started to put on weight and -- and maybe it's the bad eating habits too.  The fast food doesn't help.
L:  No, it doesn't.  And, you know, with having kids that makes it easy to go to fast food places.
R:  Uh, that's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's true.  And th- -- the sad part about it is my kids don't always eat right either.  Their grandparents tend to give 'em junkie food sometimes.
L:  Uh, okay.
R:  Uh, here's candy, here is candy, here's donuts.
L:  Oh yeah, that's true.
R:  Here's cookies and -- 
L:  That's true.
R:  -- and I normally don't carry a lot of that stuff in my house.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Except for the Girl Scout cookies because I got two girl scouts in my house.
L:  Oh, do you?  Good for you.
R:  What -- what about your household?  Do you carry a lot of junk too?
L:  We do, that's -- that's my biggest problem is that we do have a lot of -- my husband's always buying donuts but he exercises [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  But he's always buying donuts and, you know, I eat a lot of the junk -- junk food.
R:  Did he, um -- either of you -- of you make a New Year's resolution to like exercise or lose weight or ...?
L:  No.  Not I and not him either.
R:  Do you bicycle ride or anything?
L:  No [LAUGH].  See I work at home so it makes it kinda difficult.
R:  Uh, I -- yeah, I suppose.  I -- I'm trying to think of an excuse why I shouldn't be doing it but I really can't.  I probably could find some time during the day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But there's always something to do around the house or -- or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or some other work.
L:  Yeah and, you know, that's the thing.  I'm -- I'm trying to figure out why I do make excuses.  To be honest with you, I'm afraid to start exercising, thinking that I'm gonna hurt something [LAUGH].
R:  Uh, that -- that -- for me that would probably be part of it.  My doctor told me the best thing to do was just to start walking.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he said that if I would just walk a couple of miles or walk around the block he said the -- it -- the increase in calories that would get burned lasts for nine hours.
L:  Oh really?
R:  After I would walk.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, um --
L:  That's good to know.
R:  Yeah, maybe I'll do that.  Probably because I never had a weight problem all my life --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I really didn't pay much attention to it.
L:  Right.
R:  And then when I was really, really, really skinny I wasn't happy being real skinny.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I didn't feel good.  
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know about you but I didn't feel good being real thin.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh -- no, I suppose -- I suppose that I should.
L:  You know what?  Maybe that's why we choose not to do it because, you know, I didn't feel good when I was skinny either.
R:  And I didn't -- I wasn't eating ri -- I mean, I just wasn't eating.  I wasn't hungry.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  I didn't -- I have more ener- -- well, I don't have a lot of energy but I have -- I think I get more energy when I exercise.
L:  Mm.
R:  When I do exercise --
L:  Definitely.
R:  Yeah, I think I'm -- maybe my mental well being might be better too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I know they say exercising in the morning is good and I know parents at school who jog real early in the morning.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I can't even imagine it.
L:  Right.
R:  Are you a morning person?
L:  I am a morning person and so that's what I really should get up in the morning and do something, you know, before everybody gets up.  That's why I like to get up early early.  You know, because nobody's up and it's quiet.  You know, maybe I should get up and do something.
R:  When I was in college I used to do that stuff and weightlift, um, and bodybuild, all that stuff.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah, I was into body building for a while.
L:  Oh cool.
R:  And, uh --
L:  That's good for you.
R:  Uh, yeah, I think it prob- -- I never looked so good.  I had put muscle on because I was very thin.  The doctors said it was a way for me to put on some weight.
L:  Okay.
R:  Was to weightlift and body build --
L:   Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- and -- and, uh, I put on a little bit but not a whole lot.  And then it gave me an appetite and I was actually able to eat better.
L:  Okay.
R:  But -- and I felt good not eating chocolate and all the junk anymore.
L:  Right.
R:  And then I didn't want it but then all of a sudden --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and once you start on it [LAUGH].
L:  You get that taste again.
R:  Well, I'm a chocoholic.
L:  Me too.
R:  And my husband's side of the family likes to eat.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I, uh, probably could care less whether I had a meal or not.  And they like to eat out at restaurants.  Good restaurants.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Casual restaurants, uh, they like to eat out all the time.  
L:  Okay.
R:  Do you -- do you eat out a lot?
L:  Yeah, we do, we do.  A lot of fast food places.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You know, instead of home cooked meals, you know.
R:  Mm, yeah.  So, uh --
L:  Well, that's interesting.
R:  -- I suppose I should do some diet cooking but, uh -- did you ever do -- try that?
L:  What is it?
R:  Do you ever try the diet cooking from these weight loss programs or anything?
L:  No.  Like the Nutraslim or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you mean the Nutraystems.
R:  Right, that or --
L:  No.
R:  -- or with the Jenny Craig stuff or --
L:  Right.  No, I've never tried that.  I know my girlfriend tried that and actually she -- she did very well with it.
R:  Yeah, I know people who've been on Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and for some people it's worked and for some people it hasn't.  
L:  Yeah, well.
R:  But I think if you're gonna be exercising or losing weight, I think you have to both eat right and exercise.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or it -- it --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- it doesn't work and I don't -- have you ever tried any of these, uh, diet programs at all?
L:  No, I have not.
R:  Me either.  I've -- I've never tried a single diet program.
L:  Well, other than like Herbal -- Herbalife.
R:  Uh, no, I won't do that. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm not really su- -- with the herbal stuff I'm not sure how it's going to react on me so --
L:  Right.
R:  And did it work for you?
L:  Um, actually, no [LAUGH].  It did not [LAUGH].
R:  Mm.
L:  But I've heard, you know, different things like if you drink slim milk -- skim milk --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or buttermilk, that's supposed to be really good too.
R:  Well, we only have that, uh, what it is it, skim or lactase milk --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, in the house because we have lactose intolerance.
L:  Oh, do ya?
R:  Right, so we have to be careful with that.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, so we're careful with some things and just being budget conscious.  
L:  Absolutely.
R:  I told the kids, "Sorry, we get the main food, there's nothing left over to buy anything else".
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Uh, except for these girl scout cookies which I have to get.
L:  Ooh [LAUGH].
R:  I sold as many as I could and then we're trying to get rid of the rest of 'em and the problem is -- I don't know about you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but being home I'm at my computer a lot doing work and --
L:  Oh yeah, definitely.
R:  -- and stuffing my face, going to the laund- -- you know, doing the laundry, stuffing my face, going back to the computer.
L:  Yeah
