L:  Hi, I'm Nona.
R:  Hello.  I'm Colin.  How are you, Nona?
L:  Hi, Colin.  I'm pretty good.  I -- they tried this with me before and we got cut off.  Uh, I had a partner named Shannon and the line went dead.  So, I'm hoping --
R:  Oh, really?  N- -- I -- I don't -- I don't think I -- that that was me, but, um --
L:  No, no, no, it was c- -- it was Shannon.  It was a girl.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I think you're a boy, aren't you? [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, yes, I am.  Good -- good -- [LAUGH] good guess.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, but, um, no, I've, um --
L:  Yeah, let's stick to the topic.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We've got -- we've got hobbies to talk about, sounds like, huh?
L:  Right.  That's right.  That's right.
R:  What do you do in your spare time for fun, Nona?
L:  Um, well, I got involved with this study.  I saw the notice on all dot pets dot rabbits, an online news group, about it's for people who have pet rabbits, mostly house rabbits.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And [LAUGH] --
R:  And -- and you do?
L:  I do.
R:  How many?
L:  Well, I have two at the moment and there -- there could be more but I've had two basically for about a dozen years.  Not the same two, unfortunately, but --
R:  Oh, I see.  It's --
L:  How -- how did you get involved with this?
R:  Um, I'm -- I'm just a student and, um, I got the -- the, um, advertisement for -- for the study forwarded to me on email.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, you know, college student --
L:  Right.
R:  -- always willing to participate in something that might help him out --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- making a buck, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm just into that.  Plus, you know, I don't know, I -- I haven't really taken any psychology classes or anything like this, but I'm always interested in how stuff like this works, studies and things like that.
L:  Right, yeah, me too.  I was a psychology major, actually, back in college.
R:  Oh.
L:  But, um, so do you have hobbies?
R:  I -- I do.  I -- I have, I don't know, a few -- few different things that kind of keep me occupied.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm, uh, really into music.  I, um --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- have played guitar, I guess --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- for about four years, so I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I started that kind of my -- in the beginning -- in the middle of high school.  And, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's -- that's just something that I've been really into for a while.  It's just kind of like a release for me to kind of come back from classes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, play -- play for half an hour, strum out to the music and stuff like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, it was -- it was just something I've always liked to do.  I actually played piano before that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, so it wasn't too hard for me to pick up.  It wasn't too frustrating.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, I've -- I really like listening to music, too, so being able to, like, listen to the Beatles and then play --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- one of their songs on the guitar is just something that -- that's really cool for me to be able to do, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Stuff like that.  Is it -- is it true, um, what they say about the rabbits?  Do you have trouble keeping them under control or are they --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- always, uh, growing like rabbits, like in the commercials that they have people writing checks and then there's a million rabbits by the end of the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- check writing or something like that?
L:  Um, well, us house ra- rabbit people are very adamant that they should be spayed or neutered.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I see.
L:  So, um, that -- that keeps that aspect [LAUGH] of it under control --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- generally speaking.  Although one of my rabbits is actually the product of a supposedly lesbian relationship.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, because it's very hard to tell what -- whether they're boys or girls when they're -- especially when they're young.
R:  Hm.
L:  So, there are a lot of rabbits who are named Booboo, you know?
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  Um, [MN] but --
R:  It -- it's hard [LAUGH] -- it's hard to tell then, I guess, huh?
L:  Yeah, it's very hard to tell.  I mean, even vets have made mistakes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  If you can believe it.
R:  Really?
L:  Um, yeah.  Um, it's just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, some people claim that they can do it, you know, without feel and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, you know, um, just about everybody who's on this -- on this on- online news group --
R:  [NOISE] Ah.
L:  -- um, well, at least fifty percent of them I -- I would say have had a rabbit that they named, like, Sugar Bell or something --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and it's turned out to be Harry. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] What are you gonna do?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, do you just have the classic white rabbits or --
L:  Um --
R:  -- anything a little variety?
L:  Uh, uh, yeah, my, um, my oldest girl -- I have two girls now and the oldest is called Pinky, for obvious reasons.
R:  Okay.
L:  She's an albino --
R:  I see.
L:  -- with the white eyes and --
R:  I see. [NOISE]
L:  She was a -- a bunny who locked eyes with me in a pet store and I --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, yeah.  I'm not in favor of pet stores selling bunnies now and I've got lots of strong opinions on the subject of rabbits, you know, because there's a lot of in- misinformation out -- out there about them and, um --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, and it's --
R:  As far as domesticated rabbits or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- r- -- oh, okay.
L:  Right, right.  [SIGH] And so, you know, it's sort of treated casually and, um, you know, those of us who are devoted to them [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my God, you know.  Um ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So -- but, um, yeah, so they -- they eat up a lot -- a lot of time, too, actually.  They re- require quite a bit of care, I find.
R:  It -- it's worth it, though.  It sounds like you really enjoy -- enjoying having them around?
L:  Oh, I do.  I do.  I do.  They're really, really sweet.
R:  Huh.
L:  Really funny.  They've got nice little personalities.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They're all -- [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Do they -- do you keep them together, same cage, or separately?
L:  In -- in the past I've always been able to -- we call it bond them.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, they -- b- bunnies are -- form very close attachments with each other, which is one of the sweet things about them.
R:  I see.
L:  'Cause they're like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- show their affection for each other all the time and they lie together and they groom each other and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they just, you know, all -- some are e- even known to share food and stuff --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- um, which is not typical of animals, you know.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  If I -- if any -- if any animal could do it, though, I think it would be rabbits.  They're -- they seem, I don't know, in general, pretty cuddly and pretty easy going.  It seems like they'd be able to make friends.  I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But wild animals are --
L:  There's another --
R:  -- are wild animals.  Maybe that's just a misconception I have.
L:  Yeah.  Well, of course, they're not -- they're not -- they're not wild.  They're actually a different species than the wild --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- uh, bunnies.  Um, [SIGH] but, um, actually they can be very, very fierce and they will fight to the -- often fight to the death when they fight.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  So, and they will -- they're also much fiercer than most people think, you know.
R:  Yeah?
L:  I mean, people -- yeah, some people are, like, afraid of getting -- getting bitten with --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- good reason 'cause when they bite, they bite.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but, you know, they will, like, lunge at you [LAUGH] and -- and growl.
R:  Jeeze.
L:  Yeah, they will.  And it's like, "Huh?"  You know, this little fuzz ball, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it's kind of comical but it's kind of scary, too.  I mean --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- some of them are pretty big.
R:  Is it -- is it true what they say about rabbits' eyes?  Are they really that good?  Eating all the carrots and stuff like that?  Or is that just another stereotype?
L:  Um, they love carrots.  They like the tops better than the -- the roots usually.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um --
R:  Do they see really well?
L:  I --
R:  Is that something you can tell or no?
L:  Well, they see in -- I don't know if you've taken biology, but they see pretty much, like, three hundred and sixty degrees all around their head.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, 'cause they have, like, these slightly bulging eyes that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- look all around.  They can look up, you know, to watch out for the hawks and stuff that are coming --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- down to get them, and they can look in front and back and sides.  [SIGH] But no, I don't think their vision is really that -- that acute, you know.
R:  I see.
L:  Um, I don't know all that much about rabbit vision, but --
R:  Okay.  Huh.
L:  So, um, do you -- you do the guitar just about every day?
R:  Mhm.  Well, I mean, every once in a while, that's just kind of a thing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that I kinda can keep in my room and grab, you know, whenever I'm just feeling like I'm ready for a break but don't really wanna go anywhere else, just kinda wanna do something different.
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, so, you know, I -- I do that a lot and, I don't know, I -- I also am a pretty big current events buff.
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  I'm, you know, always turning on the news.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, especially, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- times like they are, it's something that a lot of people really have to keep in touch with and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- be- being in college, um, like I am right now, it's kind of like h- -- sometimes difficult when you're studying and you're at classes all the time, you kinda feel like you're in your own little world.
L:  Right.
R:  And I just really enjoy reading and, you know, trying to -- to make sure I -- I can have as -- I don't know, as global, I guess, a perspective as possible.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I do that a lot.  I do a lot of reading on the internet and things like that, too, so ... [NOISE]
L:  Are you at U Penn?
R:  I am.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was just curious.
R:  Yeah, I am.
L:  Yeah.  Um, I just -- I -- I might have known this way in the past, but I just recently learned it's, like, a private school.  Is that -- is that true?
R:  Um, I -- you know, I -- I'm not exactly sure how the distinctions work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I -- I think -- hm.  You know, I -- I really -- I don't think I can -- I can say --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- assertively whether it's --
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm not sure what it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- what that -- what being private actually means as far as, you know, how they divide them up, um -- [NOISE]
L:  Right.  Well, not state supported is what I mean, you know.
R:  Oh, is that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I think -- I think then it -- it technically is private.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Um, that would be my guess at least.
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Well, I was told, I guess, by somebody who I would think would know that it was.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  And I was, you know -- and I think I knew way back in the past that it was, but I -- I was surprised, yeah.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And that it's an Ivy League school and all of that.
R:  I see.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  Oh, I'm surprised that you being a student there wouldn't know that, but, um --
R:  Well, yeah, I mean, I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I just -- I'm not exactly sure how they divide them like that.  But --
L:  Hey, Colin, I don't wanna be rude or anything, but do you think they, like, sound a tone?  Have you done these before?  Do they sound a tone when, like, our -- our ten minutes is up or something? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you know, I don't -- I don't know, uh, how long it --
L:  It feels like it's been ten minutes.
