R:  Hi, I'm Alexis.
L:  Hi, I'm Redit[?] 
R:  Um, so the topic is family values?
L:  Yes, I think it's about, ah, increasing divorce rates and -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  Whether we think it's going to -- whether we've changed our minds about marriage because of that.
R:  Mm.
L:  So -- 
R:  Well -- 
L:  I'm personally -- I haven't been married yet, I'm still pretty young so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know -- I know I'm going to get married some time but I don't know when.
R:  Mhm, yeah, me too.  I can wait on it but I haven't really had first hand experience with divorce.
L:  Mhm, okay.
R:  Um, my parents have been together for like for thirty years and, um, -- [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  The kind of thing to --
R:  I didn't really have a lot of friends who, like, went through a divorce or anything like that.
L:  But it is actually -- I mean, there are -- divorces are becoming more common these days.  I mean, marriage --
R:  Yeah, I think people, like, rush into things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Too soon.
L:  Yes.
R:  And then they decide it's really not for them and end up -- that's why I think there's more divorce.
L:  Mm.  I also think it's [NOISE] like due to a change in values as well in terms of, like, it's more okay to have a divorce nowadays than it was, say, maybe, twenty, thirty years ago. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, yeah, it is.
L:  People say [NOISE] -- think it's okay now because I guess, I don't know, maybe because of television and, um, your still family being not so close as it used to be.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause maybe twenty five years ago people would -- I mean, they would say they've just stayed together for the sake of the kids and maybe even tolerate a little more than they would nowadays.
R:  Yeah, and then there are so many people who are just not getting married.
L:  Mhm, yeah, that's -- that's also increasing a lot.
R:  Mhm, that might --
L:  Actually, in my -- I come originally from, um, India where, ah, it's still not that common to have divorce.  It's like a pretty big shock if somebody gets divorced but even that's changing nowadays.
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  Like, ten years ago div- divorce was almost unheard of.
R:  Oh.
L:  But now that's changing as well I guess with television and the internet and people, people becoming more like each other in different parts of the world.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, and, um, I guess it's -- it's a question of tolerances where people have left other interesting things -- nowadays, I mean, a minor thing can just cause people to get a divorce.
R:  Yeah, I think so.
L:  Yeah.  And possibly, I don't know, may be having closing -- closer to your family might help reduce the rates, maybe, like, I guess if your parents set a example then you would follow that I guess.
R:  Yeah.  Then I know people too who are, like, divorced parents and, like, they don't want to be like their parents.  They -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  They want to be with someone who they plan not to divorce.
L:  Okay.  Um, I guess -- I guess, I -- hopefully nobody plans to get divorced.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  
L:  It just happens.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I know.  Um, yeah, and maybe it's also, um, a question of just, ah, working things out sometimes and people, you know, decide that they don't have the patience to do that any more.
R:  Yeah, I think we're kind of like a disposable society.  If you don't like this thing, throw it away and get another one so -- 
L:  And try on something else.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  You know, people, are so quick to, ah, make a change.
L:  Yes, yes, very much so.  It's not a very -- it's not a very pleasant circumstance but sometimes -- I mean, sometimes divorce is a better option than suffering and living in -- living with a lot of tension and some things just don't work out and you have to get out of it.
R:  Mhm, especially if there are children involved.
L:  Yeah, then it gets messy and I guess it shakes their confidence for having relationships later.  I mean, they have the fear that it can always end in a break up if they have seen their parents go through the same thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Right.  But me, when I haven't had too many friends or relatives or people I know who have got divorced but, yeah, it is a really high end of -- I've read somewhere that it's likely even higher in Europe where they -- almost half the marriages end in divorces or something like that.
R:  Oh.
L:  Which is, like, really high.
R:  I know -- I probably know more people whose parents never got married.
L:  Okay.
R:  In the first place so -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  Than, yeah, divorce never came up.  But still they didn't have, you know -- they didn't live in a two parent household.
L:  Okay.  I mean, yeah, but the institution of marriage has less meaning nowadays as in, it's okay to live unmarried and the -- the olden days that they were living in sin and things like that and that's all okay nowadays so, I guess people are waiting longer to get married.
R:  Yeah, I think they take it for granted.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like what it [NOISE] really is supposed to be about.
L:  Yes, mhm.
R:  People shouldn't rush into it.
L:  Mhm, yes, take their time and get to know the person.  [PAUSE]
R:  Otherwise -- [PAUSE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, it doesn't seem like -- I don't think that so many people, like, as far as, like, this new generation of children who are, like, have divorced parents are going to be, like, any worse off than -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  Other kids and -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  Most of the time in two parent families but their -- their lifestyle would be a little different.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, you know, most of the time, they're just -- 
L:  Yeah.  Might I say even make them a little more independent not having people to look after them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, not having two parents, so it might make them a little more -- I mean, they can fend for themselves maybe.  But it is hard sometimes and I guess being a single parent is really hard.  [PAUSE] 
R:  Do you know how long, um, these conversations are supposed to be?
L:  I'm not exactly sure actually. Maybe --
R:  Oh, this is my first time.
L:  Yeah, mine too, [LAUGH] yeah, I don't know maybe when we are done discussing it we just stop I guess, I don't know.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, I think we are pretty much done.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, it was nice talking to you.
L:  Yeah, you too.
R:  Okay, bye bye.
L:  Bye bye.
