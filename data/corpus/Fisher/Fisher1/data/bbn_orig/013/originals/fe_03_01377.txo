R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  My name's Marvin.
L:  Oh, hi.  I'm Carolyn Gilbert.
R:  Hi, Carolyn, how are you?
L:  I'm fine.
R:  What was the, uh, what was the, uh, topic we were supposed to talk about?
L:  Okay, the --  the computer didn't say -- didn't -- we were supposed to be talking about censorship and books in the -- 
R:  In schools, right?
L:  -- in the public school system.
R:  Okay, and whether or not schools have the right to -- 
L:  We -- we should be, uh, have the right to do that, yes.
R:  Okay.  Ah, well, I guess I feel that it -- it kind of depends on the book and what it is.  If it's a classic book like Tom Sawyer I -- I don't think they have the right to -- to censor that.
L:  Okay.  Um, well, it's ironic because I spoke to someone -- the computer called me twice on the same topic. 
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  Yeah.  I just spoke to someone about an hour ago and we were just talking about, um, you know, the, um, the, uh, same subject and we kind of felt that, um, um, it was, um, a sort of a good thing for the, ah, schools to censor the books because a lot of times the, um, students, um, are not exposed to, um, as many, um, areas of life, um, that they could be exposed to by learning, you know, some of the classics and -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and, uh, um, [COUGH] reading about all kinds of topics and understanding, um, um, ah, other cultures and -- and, um, um, you know, understanding some of the things that happen, um, you know, to society and, uh, why society, you know, is the way it is today and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, you know and I kind of felt -- she and I both kind of felt the same way in terms of if they don't know about a lot of things, if the ins- -- if the school does not expose them, then are how they going to ever learn? 
R:  Right.  I -- yes, that's -- that's kind of the way I -- I feel -- feel too.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  If it's, ah, you know, a, uh, classic work -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, there's no -- I don't think there's any reason to censor ideas -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, and even --  and even words, um, depending on -- depending on the context.
L:  Mhm.  Okay, but I thought they were in -- in terms of books.  Are -- are you talking about in terms of th- the -- the -- the things that are written in the books, y- -- uh, the -- the ideas in the -- and, you know, are you just talking about the books themselves in terms of what they -- what they suggest that these students read and learn? 
R:  Um, I don't -- I don't think -- I don't think the ideas should be censored.  I -- I -- I guess I'm not, ah, I think I follow your line of thought that -- that -- that it's -- if, um, given the two choices, I would rather not censor or -- or I would rather err on the side of exposing them to something rather than trying to protect them.
L:  Right.  Right.  And -- and -- and we- -- you know, uh, we -- we both kind of felt that, um, a lot of the students, um, nowadays don't know how to, um, um, interpret a lot of things, don't understand a lot of things, don't know much about any other culture.  All they know is -- is what -- you know, they put more emphasis on music and sports than they do on learning about life and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and learning about -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like I said, other cultures, other civilizations -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, learning about history, where we came, you know, what -- what happened in the past, how can we study the past to -- to learn how to make the future a little better -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  -- if we don't --
R:  Well, yeah.  So much of -- so much of those ideas and -- and -- and concepts like that are -- are -- are also to help them teach -- teach them how to learn and how to accept others and [MN] how to view others -- 
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  
R:  -- and -- and not, um -- argh, what am I -- what am I trying to say?  They're -- they're, like you said, exposing them to different ideas -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- and -- and -- and different vantage points -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it's also -- also, too, it's helping them t- to try to learn that it's okay to form their own thoughts and their own opinions -- 
L:  That's right.  That's right.
R:  -- about things.
L:  And also not to just accept anything that's said, you know.  Some -- in a lot of times we'd be -- we -- just because we -- someone, you know, has a p- -- a particular philosophy about the way a certain thing should be done, that doesn't necessarily mean that you have to agree with it -- 
R:  No.  Right.
L:  -- that you should have your own, formulate your own ideas and your own opinions about a lot of things --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and also, um, question, you know.  You know, uh -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, the lady that I spoke to earlier, she was just saying that, um, some of them have no idea why we -- why we're in this war -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, can't think, can't -- don't, you know, they don't understand anything, don't even know what's going on, um, um, ah, because we don't -- they don't -- they don't really take time to try to read and try to learn as much as they possibly can.
R:  Right.  And -- and -- yeah, like -- like we -- we just said, it's important for them to try to learn that -- that opinions that they form are just as valid as opinions that someone else has written.
L:  Written, that's right, or what someone else has told them -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- in terms of --
R:  Yeah.  Just because somebody can sit at a typewriter and put their thoughts down doesn't mean that their thoughts hold any more water than what a seventeen year old's thoughts are.
L:  Right.  Right.  So, um, -- and -- and we were just thinking in terms of -- of -- of -- of, um, learning about, um, ah, just life in general, work ethics, you know, um, what it really, you know, what -- what it really -- what people really had to go through in terms of working.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We were just thinking in terms of parents giving their kids everything, not understanding what it is to get out there and -- and -- and -- and, um, and really work -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um, and [MN] we're going back to learning about the past.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, you know, and, um, um, because you -- you hear a lot of people s- -- a lot of young people saying, "Oh, I wouldn't do that" or, "I couldn't do that" or, "I'm not going to do that", um, you know, um, or, "I didn't underst- --  I didn't realise that we had to go through this" or, "Did they have to walk five miles to go to school?"
R:  Right.  Yeah. 
L:  You know, they didn't -- they don't -- yeah, if they didn't -- if you don't -- if you don't try to study -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- what has happened, "Oh, I wouldn't dare walk five miles to go to school".
R:  Right.  Well, they just have to under- -- 
L:  "Oh, yes you would have in that, you know, during that time".
R:  Yeah.  People -- they just have to understand that people do what they have to do -- 
L:  Right.  Right, and -- 
R:  -- and -- and -- and they do what they have to do when -- when they have to -- when it has to get done. 
L:  Right.  Right.  And, like, but if they don't understand what -- like, if they don't read about what went on in the past, if they don't, you know, understand some of the -- some of the -- the -- the, [LIPSMACK] um, you know, the pitfalls and the problems and the good things and the bad things and -- and, you know, [MN] you know, ah, [LIPSMACK] -- and, you know -- 
R:  Mhm.  Well, it's -- it's -- what's the old saying?  That, ah, those that don't learn history are -- are -- are doomed to re- re- repeat history.
L:  Right.  That's right, that's right.
R:  So, [MN] you know, there's, [SIGH] you know, other -- other than thoughts and ideas from people that have -- have lived before us, there's also -- we can learn from what -- what they've done right and also from what they've done wrong.
L:  Wrong, that's right, that's right.  So, you know, um, -- and I guess that's one of the reasons why I -- I, you know, I just kind of think that, you know, they, you know, they should censor and -- and should, um, um, you know, [inaudible] help, you know, help --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- students become more exposed -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to as much as they possibly can.
R:  Right.  Well, I mean, yeah.  Even -- even if ideas -- um, even if the -- the ideas written by today's standards are wrong, there's something to be learned about that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about how times have changed even.
L:  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  And we were talking about the fall of the Roman Empire and -- and, um, you know, learning from that civilization which was one of the -- the  -- the greatest civilizations untold -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- and what went wrong there.  Are we -- are we doing some of the same things that they did back in -- 
R:  Hello?
L:  -- in that era.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  [PAUSE] Hello?  Hello?  [PAUSE] Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  [PAUSE]
