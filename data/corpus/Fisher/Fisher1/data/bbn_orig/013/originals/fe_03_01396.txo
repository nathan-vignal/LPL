R:  Hello, this is Bev.
L:  Hi, this is Deneen.
R:  Denise?
L:  Deneen.
R:  Janine?
L:  Deneen.
R:  Duneen?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  I'm fine.
L:  Good, what -- what part of the area are you from?
R:  I'm from Iowa.
L:  Oh, okay, I'm from Philadelphia.
R:  Philadelphia.
L:  Yes.
R:  So, how's the weather in Philadelphia.
L:  Well, it's unseasonably warm at this time.  It's about eighty -- eighty two degrees during the day and about fifty at night.  Um, so it's a little warm for us, for April.
R:  Oh.
L:  How's the weather there?
R:  Well, we had about eighty or ninety on Monday and Tuesday and about forty and fifty today.
L:  Oh no!  It's been like that here too.  Up and down, up and down.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, definitely been up and down.
R:  Well, I guess we're not supposed to talk about the weather --
L:  No.
R:  We'd better talk about fitness and health.
L:  Yeah.  So, what -- what do you do for fitness?
R:  Oh, I -- I'm not doing a whole lot right now.  I do take walks once in a while.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you?
L:  Um, I'm not doing much either [LAUGH] but, um, actually, uh, have taken walks in the past and trying to do a little bit more of that.  I -- I really wanna, um, start doing, uh, like salsa lessons, salsa dancing.
R:  What is that?
L:  Salsa dancing.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, I've been doing that and I finally was able to convince my husband to do some lessons so, um, we actually wanna start doing lessons.  And I know that that's a good way to -- to work out.  It's -- you know, you're required to go as well as, you know, be able to help you lose some weight so --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Uh, that's what I wanna do.  I've been to a couple of functions where I've been able to do that but I wanna actually be able to do it a couple of times a week.  That way, you know, 'cause a regimen is important.  You can't just do it one time and expect it to really work so --
R:  [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  You know, so I'm trying to do a, um, a regimen of that .  And -- and walking is also good because it gives you chance to clear your head a little bit and -- and, um,  do the things that you need to do and --
R:  Yeah, if the weather gets good I'll probably be working outside.  I guess that's exercise, planting the garden and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- working on my raspberries.  Gotta trim those down and it won't be long and we'll have to start the  -- mowing the lawn.
L:  Yeah, yeah how about that.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, you know we haven't had much rain but I'm sure --
R:  Oh we either, we're dry.  In fact we've got a burn band right now.  I've gotta burn my ditches but I can't do it yet.
L:  Really?
R:  Oh yeah.  It was on and then we got just a little -- we had that snow and then, um, then they put it back on aga- -- they took it off and put it back on because there's been so many fires.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So --
L:  Yup, definitely.  So, you know, that's something.  You know, being out in the garden working and exercising like that does something that, um, kinda will work out your arms a little bit, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  If you wanna be able to do something, uh, you know, to work the whole body, you know what I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:   -- as well as clearing your mind too.  So, sometimes that's the hardest thing to be able to --
R:  I do a bicycle too that, uh, has flat tires.  So, hopefully I'll get those --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- taken care of and so I can ride my bike again this summer.
L:  What you do -- you can boost it up in the house and make it a stationery bike.
R:  Oh, well there is one in the house here but it's not handy so I don't use  that very often.
L:  Oh.
R:  But I have grandkids and I know when they bring their bikes over they like me to go bike with them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so, uh, gonna have to get it fixed, I guess.
L:  Yeah, do you have a trail near your home?
R:  A what?
L:  A trail, like a bike trail.
R:  No, I live out in the country.  We just -- we just go on the country roads.  We do have a -- the fairgrounds isn't very far from us so we could go up there and go around it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  Mm.
R:  And, in fact, when we walk sometimes my husband walks up and around the fairgrounds and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I go up and down the road and pick up cans 'cause we've got a five cent deposit here.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, it's sort of a double dose thing. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I get my exercise and then I go down and, you know, out in the ditches and pick up some cans that are nickels. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow, that's pretty good!
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's pretty good.  At least that something that you're still being active with.
R:  Right.
L:  And you know what, the more active you are the younger you are. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah.  Yeah, I was actually probably more active -- you know I used to be an athlete, you know, and everything and it's --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Well, I played -- I played softball up until, mm, probably a couple of years ago.
L:  Wow.  That's great.
R:  But, uh, now it's getting to the point you don't wanna hurt anything [LAUGH].
L:  Do you jog too?
R:  Do I what?
L:  Jog.
R:  Jog?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, I -- I -- a couple of years ago I did and stuff but I have sort of a bad knee and that's sort of hard on that so --
L:  Okay.
R:  So, walking is a little better but I do sometimes and then oh, one of the grandkids goes into some little track meets so sometimes I run with her or walk with her, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- sort of help her out.  So, get a little exercise that way.
L:  Oh, yeah that's always good too.  But they always say that jogging is not good for women.
R:  Yeah, well, I guess.  I don't know.  I just -- you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, about was it two years, three years ago, two years ago, I guess, I even went into the Iowa games.  The, oh, track and field in the Iowa games?
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  We took, uh, we took a couple of the grandkids and -- so my daughter and I we -- we did it too.
L:  You participated?
R:  Yeah, just for the fun of it.
L:  Wow, what'd you do, track and field?
R:  Yeah.  I did the shot and the discus, which I've never done before.
L:  Oh my word!
R:  See we didn't have track when I was at a school.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, uh, and then I did the hundred and the two hundred and then we had to do the fun run with the -- with the grandkids so that was another two hundred.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I found out I wasn't in real good shape [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But there weren't that many participants in my category so I ended up winning [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Oh, that's great!
R:  So, we got, we got medals or ribbons or whatever it was and the kid -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:   -- uh, Ashley, she's the one the does track and she did too and she was all excited about that so -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  So, we -- you know, we've paid Kitreole[?] with the kids and stuff so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that sort of keeps you young too.
L:  Oh, definitely.  Definitely.
R:  You have some grandkids?
L:  No!  Uh-uh, I have a fifteen year old.
R:  Oh.
L:  But, um, he's very active and, uh --
R:  So, you're probably still running around -- does he participate in sports and stuff?
L:  Yeah.  He -- he plays basketball about two or three times a week.  Sometimes more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you know, they kinda keep him busy but I was more active than [MN] you know, a couple of years ago I had, um, very serious brain surgery so that kinda hindered my ability to work out the way that I did before.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I have to kinda be real careful.  That's why I say walking is something that I can do on my own pace, you know what I mean?
R:  Yes, right.
L:  It's not like doing a, an exercise tape or going to, you know, a little old, um, aerobic class, it's nothing like that so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I can kinda do walking on my own pace, you know, kind of thing.
R:  Right.
L:  So, because I have those health issues I have to kinda pace myself and do it whatever way is gonna kind of make me comfortable.  But, you know, I know it's important not only to physically exercise but it's important to eat right too because if you don't, whether you exercise or not, your body'll tell you.
R:  Right. 
L:  So, [inaudible] yourself.
R:  Right, right.  Well, I try to exercise once in a while some- -- sometimes too and I'm just sitting around or something, you know, you will feel but, uh, not as much as I know I should.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But once it gets nice out again and I'm outside and then you see me get enough exercise [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, you can always skate.
R:  Well, you see, we're also on the farm so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- we're out in the country and we have, you know --
L:   A lot of land.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.  Although we do have it rented out because my husband's -- we're both retired.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I -- this is my first year not teaching for thirty two years.
L:  Wow!  Wow, that's great.  That is beautiful.
R:  So --
L:  Ooh.  So, you --
R:  So, I've gotta -- I gotta -- I'm working on some stain glass and that's in the basement so I get my exercise going up and down the steps [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess that's not enough but sometimes the phone rings and I'm up and down and up and down.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh -- oh, I don't know, I -- I guess -- and I usually walk fast whenever I walk just about anywhere --
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I guess that's, uh, a good thing.
L:  Mhm.  Brisk walking.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because it helps you to have cardio.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Mhm.  And do you eat, um, a lot of salads and green vegetables?
R:  Uh, not as many probably as I should but -- [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  'Cause they say like fruits and vegetables and like greens and those kinds of things --
R:  Oh yeah, yeah.
L:  -- are the best diets to have because they help to keep your cholesterol down.
R:  Right.
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so that even if you don't exercise, you know, your cholesterol is not high or you don't have to worry about clogged arteries or anything else like that.
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I know, you know, that's important.  You know, especially 'cause we, as people, nowadays, the things that we eat is not always good for us.  It tastes good but it's not always good for us, you know what I mean?
R:  Right, right.
L:  And we almost end up craving the food that's not good for us.  So, we have to make sure that, you know, let's just say that an apple a day ...
