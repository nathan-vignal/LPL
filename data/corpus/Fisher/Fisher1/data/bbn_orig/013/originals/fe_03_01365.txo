R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, I'm Betty.
L:  Hi, I'm Angelique.
R:  I'm calling from D.C. where are you calling from?
L:  Um, from New Jersey.
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Listening to the topic, um, w- we're retired military and it's like, my children as they grew up, they were always in private schools and there was censorship, but now that I've got a child in public school, I -- I really think we should continue the censorship because right now public schools are just getting everything thrown in at 'em.  And it's -- it's -- it's not good material.  What do you think?
L:  Um, well, I think that there's a big difference, um, between public and private schools, mainly that, you know, private schools are not able to be regulated by the government because their, you know, the funding comes from themselves and --
R:  Correct.
L:  -- [MN] and the families, whereas, you know, the public schools are funded by the government and therefore, um --
R:  But --
L:  -- you know --
R:  But they're our tax dollars.
L:  -- they have to --
R:  A- and so it's still in a way private donations because these are --
L:  Don't you think?
R:  -- our tax dollars.  These are our tax dollars that are funding these schools, though.  So, to me it's still like a private donation.  So I think we should have better control over both sectors, private and public schools.
L:  Well, no, I mean, like the -- the schools are in state jurisdiction, so I think it's really up to the state, but they still -- I mean, and the state has to, um, you know, of course pay respects to the -- to the larger federal government and, you know, I think that, um, when the -- when an outside force is regulating a school then, um, [LIPSMACK] we kinda have to play by their rules.  And, you know, we -- we're guaranteed the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press by the first amendment and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- because of that, you know, I really -- I think that cutting the censorship in public schools would kind of go against the competition.
R:  But we -- we should all -- it -- it should be an equal basis because that's the only way we're going to make an equal educational system.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Um, because in private schools you're requiring more, um, of the teachers.  More certification, better training, and we have had so many teachers in public schools that aren't even certified.  So may-
L:  That are not certified?
R:  That are not certified, teaching.
L:  I -- 
R:  Especially in this area.
L:  I -- yeah, I -- I don't really know about that.  I mean, um, my grandmother was a teacher in a public high school for many years and, I mean, I've -- I've never heard of, um, a school -- of public schools, you know, not hiring certified teachers, but, I mean, if that's a problem then I think that certainly, you know, teachers should be certified.
R:  They've got, um, people coming in from other, um, um, degreed areas and they're letting them teach while they work on their certification, things like that.  In --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- in a private school it's mandatory because you're trying to give that child the best possible education there is.  And censorship does help on that because [SIGH] a lot of facts in our literature, you know, isn't complete.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We went through, uh, the monument today in D.C. and read a lot of the, um, um, the speeches from the presidents and, um, we looked at Martin Luther King's, um, march.  We looked at, uh, I -- I mean, just tons of history.  Things I didn't even know existed.
L:  Did you?
R:  And private schools do teach that.  Public schools, uh, they lack so much.  So, censorship is good because it's gonna get the -- the basic knowledge that you need out there first.
L:  Well, I certainly agree that, you know, the basics should be taught in every school and, I mean, I think that should definitely be part of every school's curriculum.  Um, and I -- I mean, I grew up in a -- in a public school and, um, you know, I think that I was given a very good education.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] I think that -- I -- I don't think you could say one way or another that, you know, public schools do not teach this or do teach this, I think that, you know, varies slightly.  But, um, in terms of -- in terms of censorship of, you know, specific books, in public schools, um, I just think that it's -- it's a very delicate situation.  I mean, it's going lead to a very slippery slope and if you say, well -- if, um, some pupils parents say, "Well, this one book, you know, it goes against our -- our ethics --
R:  [MN]
L:   -- we -- we don't like it, you know, we don't think it should be taught, you know --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- we don't want our children reading this.
R:  Uh huh.
L:  Then who's to say that something else that, you know, that may not be so controversial might get banned and, you know, who -- who knows where it's gonna stop?  And soon, you know, we'll end up in situation like Nineteen Eighty Four, you know, where, um, where there's just, you know, there's total control of everything and you just don't have access to anything you wanna read.  Not that that would happen but --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- it's something that could potentially happen and if you -- if you just start banning books, um, just, you know, on the basis of that they go against what you believe is correct.
R:  I guess being military we've, um, for twenty t- twenty seven years, everything's been censored for us, so it doesn't bother us as much.  Um, like with the war that's going on right now, I think we're putting too much on television.  We're telling too many facts.  You know, get the basics out there and leave the rest of it alone.  You know, a -- a child has to have a basic primary education and that's what censorship does.  That's what I've seen so far, with -- with my younger children going to school.
L:  Well, you mean, by censorship giving a better education you're just saying that, um, if -- if you were choosing between something like, uh, I don't know, Of Mice And Men versus The History of the United States, um, you would choose The History of the United States, right?
R:  Correct, I would.
L:  Well, I -- I don't really think that there should be -- that there doesn't really have to be a choice.  I mean, I think that you can allow both in the curriculum.  I think what the question is saying, though, is that, um, if there is a book, you know, say -- say Of Mice And Men, which was a banned book, um, and you know, I have some --
R:  But there was reas- there was a reason for banning that book.
L:  Right.
R:  It -- it's [SIGH] 
L:  I'm sorry, what did you say?
R:  [MN]  It's kind of hard to explain.  I'm a black American.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it just went against so many beliefs that we had, it really did.  Um --
L:  Right.
R:  It brought too much controversy into the system.  Those types of books.
L:  Right.  But sometimes controversy is good.  I mean, a lot of times if, you know, if everybody's secure in their thinking and, um, you know, nothing ever challenges their belief systems --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- then there will be no change.  And, I mean, you might think that change is not good, but, I mean, especially being a black American.  What if, you know, like, say the American south, say, um, you know, we banned Huckleberry Finn, so there'd be a lot less literature saying that, you know, black people should be given their rights.  Would you be in favor of, you know, keeping the status quo and not, you know, introducing any change?  Sometimes change is good, sometimes change is necessary.
R:  Well, correct, sometimes change is good but it's got to be gradually brought in.
L:  Right, right, I agree, but I just think that, um, controversy is something that -- that's needed otherwise we're going to settle into our narrow way of thinking and that -- that'll just breed ignorance.
R:  But in school, too much controversy is disruptive.  I think --
L:  But it --
R:  -- we don't have enough control in the schools as it is now.
L:  But it's kind of hard to determine how much is too much controversy.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, who -- who is to determine?  I think it's just a -- it's a value judgment, you know?  Um --
R:  Well, that's what the private schools do, they determine it and it --
L:  Right, exactly.  I think that private schools are well within their jurisdiction of doing that, but for public schools, um, I really -- I -- I'm just not so sure how that could be regulated, you know, across the nation.
R:  In D.C. um, they've got this program where you can choose to let your child go to public or private school and th- it could be funded by the government, and a lot of people are choosing the private sector because of that, because they feel that, um, the children are -- are getting vast more information from the private sec- um, private sector.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Also, did you hear a news, um, interview about six days ago, a congressman came on television and said he would rather drop twelfth grade and in- introduce pre K. into the system.  Saying that's where we're gonna learn the most information, when the child is a -- the -- at the, you know, the very tip of life learning.  Why should we drop something?
L:  Right.
R:  We've got children, I mean, just passing on in life, they can't read.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Our public schools have given up.  That, uh, censorship challenges a child, it really does.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I really do.  I think it makes a child think --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- and be motivated and encouraged to wanna learn.
L:  Um, you sorta -- you think censorship does this?
R:  Repeat that, I'm sorry.
L:  Uh, I'm so- uh, my phone is -- I don't have a very good connection, what did you say?  Um, you should discuss --
R:  I think the pub- um, the private schools, with their censorship, the materials that they're introducing to the children, it encourages the child to think more --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- be more independent and more active in their community.
L:  Well, I mean, I -- I don't think you can, you know, um, necessarily exte- extend that -- ex- sorry, extend that to, um, to the rest of the nation, you know, saying that all private schools are better in the curriculum than public schools.  Because I know, at least --
R:  Well, correct.
L:  -- in my home town, um, our public school is actually -- it produces more, you know, leaders in the community than does our private school, which is --
R:  Are those the schools, um, schools for the arts, are you talking about those type schools?
L:  No, no, I'm just talking about our regular public school.  I mean, I grew up in New Jersey and I grew up in a very small suburban town --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- and we have a public school and we also have a private school within our town.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, you know, the private school is smaller, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, it's -- it's a whole different curriculum and the statistics show that, you know, more kids, you know, a higher percent -- like the -- the ratio of kids who go on to college is higher in a public school than it is in the private school.  I don't think you can --
R:  Well, no, no -- back up on that one, you've got to also realize there's more children in public schools than private schools.
L:  Yeah, but that's why I said -- exactly, but that's why I said the ratio of students.
R:  Oh, okay, okay, I didn't hear that part, I'm sorry.  Okay.
L:  Right.  So I -- so that's why I'm just saying that you can't necessarily say that, oh, private schools are better than public schools
