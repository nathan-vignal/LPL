L:  Hello?
R:  Hello, I'm Caroline from California.
L:  Hello, my name is Andrew and I'm in Wisconsin.
R:  In Wisconsin?  So, do you do health and fitness?
L:  Well, it's, uh, it's an interesting question --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because I ride my bicycle regularly but I ride my bicycle for a lot of reasons, fitness being probably not among them.
R:  Yeah.  I used to ride.  Now, I've got a cardioglide and if I can get up to fifteen or twenty --
L:  What is that?
R:  -- pumps I'm glad.
L:  What is a cardioglide?
R:  It's, um, I call it my horse.  It's one of those things where you push and pull with your hands and your feet.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's -- like a bi- -- like a stationery bicycle.
L:  Oh, okay.  All right.
R:  Except it's got the handlebars that you pull against --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- you and then your feet go out.
L:  Wow, so you just sort of  -- arms and legs in mid air.  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  Well, not -- yeah, sort of.
L:  How -- do you do that everyday really?
R:  I just -- I use it for stretching because I have fibromylgia.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, so -- so you had a -- a not directly related reason.
R:  Yeah.  I just -- I do it 'cause I have to. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  If I don't then I get --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- cramped up and my muscles cause me a lot of problems.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that and so --
L:  But it's tangential to fitness per se though, yeah me too.
R:  Pardon?
L:  So, it's sort of tangential to fitness per se.
R:  Yeah, 'cause --
L:  And me too.
R:  -- it's a lot better than medicine.  It works better too.
L:  Yeah, I understand that.
R:  I miss my riding though.  I used to ride.  I was up to thirteen miles but I started having dizzy spells and I got where I was afraid to go.
L:  Oh, yeah I can see where that would be a problem.
R:  You know, I didn't walk or anything.
L:  Yeah?
R:  And I gained forty pounds when I quit and I'm like eee.
L:  What kind of bicycle do you have?
R:  Pardon me?
L:  What kind of bicycle did you have?
R:  I have a mountain bike.
L:  Uh-huh.  Do you recall the brand?
R:  No.
L:  I happen to be in the business.
R:  My friend made it up for me.
L:  I happen to be in the business that's why I ask.
R:  Oh.  He -- he's -- my friend used to buy parts and stuff, you know, in garage sales and put --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- it together and fix 'em up.
L:  That can be really fun.
R:  And he says like this one's like a three hundred dollar bike.
L:  Cool.
R:  And, um, it's a ten speed and it worked really good.  I just wish I had somebody to ride with and I had the energy level now.
L:  Yeah.  And unlike doing your cardio machine, you got to actually see the scenery and you had to go places --
R:  Yeah, it's just like there's something to it.
L:  -- it's simulating, yeah.
R:  I remember when he and I went and rode along the levy by the Sacramento River and the birds and the stream and the deer and the, you know --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- the scenery and the sun and the mosquitoes [LAUGH].  It was fun.
L:  Yeah.  All the things you don't get when you're on an exercise machine.
R:  Mhm?
L:  All the things you don't get when you're on your exercise machine.
R:  Yeah.  I don't have the endurance now though -- I don't -- I couldn't ride a mile.  Maybe round block or two to start with.  But that's how I started and then within three or four months I was riding quite a bit.  I'd ride to the orchards and they have almond orchards out here lots and --
L:  What part of California are you in?
R:  I'm in the Isealous, above Sacramento.
L:  Okay.
R:  About thirty five miles.
L:  Yeah, up in the middle some place.
R:  There's -- there's a lot of almonds and plums and rice in the area.
L:  That sounds interesting.
R:  Yeah, it's beautiful. It [LAUGH] -- it's funny 'cause Yuba City, Yuba city, Maryville, our twin city, is a cross the river --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- from each other and they used to say Yuba City's the armpit of California [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  But it is the most beautiful town.
L:  Are you from there originally?
R:  No, I'm from the bay area.
L:  Oh.
R:  When the bay area was --
L:  I lived there for a little while in nineteen seventy.
R:  Did you?  I did -- I grew up in Velayo and it was the first place they had race riots and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I remember PE there [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  We used to -- I used to have swimming.  That was always fun.  I wish -- I miss having a pool where I can have access to it.  That's how I started getting stronger.  I used to be able -- where I had, when I first got sick I ha- -- it was like chronic fatigue and I was sleeping twenty hours a day.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And I got where I was sitting up more and more and then I got an apartment -- I got an upstairs apartment so I had to walk.
L:  Right.
R:  And then the apartment had a pool and a jacuzzi.
L:  Wow, that's pretty cool.
R:  Mm, so I would go down and I would swim.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I would like do a couple of laps three or four times a day.
L:  That -- that'd would be wonderful to have available.
R: Yeah, it was so good for me.  It was really nice.  And then I'd go out, sometimes at night, and just float in the water.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know and, um -- I don't thin- -- I think they had some fitness equipment or something, I'm not sure.  I don't remember.  I know I wasn't interested in that [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Right.  Yeah, exactly.
R:  I just liked the pool.
L:  Sure.
R:  But I wouldn't have this if it hadn't been given to me but it's a -- a godsend in many ways just, you know, being able to stretch where I can't really exercise.
L:  Sure.
R:  And they have a public pool and the pool is, um, is called Potese Pool.  It's a little place for -- it's for handicapped people.
L:  Right.
R:  But it's only like four feet deep and you can't really swim in it.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's like -- takes the fun out and then everybody goes and they get hot and so they open the doors and I can't stand the cool.  
L:  Sure.
R:  I have to be warm.  And since I can't stay under the water --
L:  Right.
R:  -- my shoulders and stuff and I just quit going.
L:  Oh, that's too bad.  It's sort of a waste of a resource.
R:  I've often thought about it.  Mm?
L:  It's sort of a waste of a resource.  It's sort of a sad story.
R:  Yeah.  It  -- a lot of people --
L:  It could be a comfort to you.
R:  -- utilize it.  People with heart problems and stuff.
L:  Yes.
R:  And, um, mobility -- more mobility than I do but I just --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- can't -- I have to be warm.
L:  But it could be a great comfort to you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if it were just a little different.
R:  Yeah.  As I had my brothers -- we bought a fixer upper home, or we we're  -- we have a lease option and I would put in a, um, if it was large enough -- I would knock the kitchen out and move it around a little bit and where our closet is I'd put the bathroom and put a, uh, one of those hot tub bathrooms, a roman bath --
L:  Yeah, like a jacuzzi.
R:   -- with the spas and stuff in it, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, instead of a regular bathtub have that with a double shower in it.
L:  Those aren't as expensive as they used to.
R:  Yeah, they're about two -- twenty five hundred dollars, I think.
L:  Right, well it's not unattainable.
R:  No.
L:  You know, it's not like tens of thousands of dollars.
R:  No.  I think that's probably what they used to be, huh?
L:  Yeah.  So, you probably could do that if you had to put your mind to it.
R:  No, uh, this place isn't big enough.  It's only nine hundred square feet.
L:  Can't quite squeeze it?
R:  No.  There's room in the back yard but it'd take half the backyard and I like my yard.  Finally have a nice little lawn back there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what do you do?  You -- oh, you do bicycles, huh?
L:  I do.  As a matter of fact I was working when I took this call in.  This is the second call I had tonight and I've never had two in an evening before.
R:  The second tonight?
L:  Yeah.  I've never --
R:  How many have you had?  This is only my second call.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was like forever and I was about ready to call 'em and say, "Am I gonna ever get any more calls?"
L:  Yeah, they're pretty far apart.  That's why I was surprised to have two this evening.
R:  Yeah.  I know -- I'm on this mystery shopping list and everybody told everybody about it and, um, they put down, "Oh, I got a call tonight", you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and trying to figure out if everybody's -- if any -- if we talk to each other at all.  Anybody else on the list and it's actually happening.  There's only like three or four hundred people on the list and it's happened like two or three times where they've ended up talking to somebody they knew from the list.
L:  Oh, that's pretty cool.
R:  Yeah.  It was, it's just neat and others --
L:  I give tech advice about bicycles on the net and I've got a listing through that.
R:  Oh.
L:  But I had a girlfriend who worked on the DARE here in Madison, just like eight blocks from here.  So, I was kinda interested in the subject and that's why I volunteered.
R:  Yeah --
L:  Do you know that?  The Dictionary of American Regional English by Cassidy?
R:  Oh, really.
L:  They started it in nineteen seventy five and I think they're up to "F" right now, "E" or "F".
R:  Oh.  Dictionary of the American Language.
L:  American Regional English.
R:  Regional.  Okay, like --
L:  It's a study of --  It's a study of dialogue.
R:  -- English, Southern English.
L:  It's a study of dialogues.
R:  Yeah, that would be interesting.
L:  It's quite exhaustive and it's a long project.  It'll go more than a lifetime.
R:  You know, one of the girls was saying it was odd, she says, "I wonder if they have fun trying to figure out where I'm from" because she was an air force brat too and moved all over the place and I was --
L:  Yeah, you have a litt- some unusual pronunciations.  That is interesting.  Did you live a lot of places?
R:  Mm.  You're right.  My -- I picked up -- I was in Oklahoma for a while when I was in -- in, um, about ninth or tenth grade.  Just a couple of weeks and I came home with this drawl or something and everybody noticed it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like you sound like you're someone else.
L:  Which is amazing.
R:  [LAUGH] But my grandson he's in Virginia and his parents are from out here and my daughter's trying to teach him to speak right.  You know, to -- to speak not in a drawl, to speak like she -- she's learned how to speak English out here, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  And she's, um -- it's really hard for her.  It's hard for him, I guess.
L:  It's amazing how sometimes it's very quick and sometimes very slow.  I lived in Florida for a little while and I was determined not to speak like those crackers.
