R:  Hello, this is Jason.
L:  Hi, Jason, I'm Marty.
R:  How you doing, Marty?
L:  Okay.  This is interesting, I've -- this is only the second phone call I've got so far.
R:  Oh, this is my third one.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  Yes, I wanna --
L:  Well, I can tell you right now that my a- the question -- my answer to the question is no, nobody should forbid anybody to read any book.
R:  Yeah, I [COUGH] I agree.  And, uh --
L:  And I don't know how we're gonna talk about it for ten minutes.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, I mean  you know, I agree, I always, you know, English was not my most favorite subject.
L:  Yeah, but I mean, based on -- books, I mean, books being censored of any kind 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, I'm gonna be the one doing the censoring for my kid.
R:  Now -- now, there's a -- now, I agree with you to a certain point, though.  Uh, I think age come into play.
L:  Yeah, there I agree.
R:  You know, um, now what age do you think is, uh, that, you know, it should be all open?
L:  All open?  Sixteen.
R:  Sixteen?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  That's what I feel like, high school age.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  That's what I 
L:  But I mean, I remember reading, uh, oh, what was it I was getting off on?  Uh, buh, double oh seven books, when I was like, a pre teen.  And I'm glad no one censored me because I really enjoyed them.
R:  Mm.
L:  They were my, uh, porn!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, there was a lot of good writing, good sexy writing in there and that was my introduction to it.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Rather do that than do other [inaudible] and people get so, so spaced out over Catcher In The Rye.
R:  Oh yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, and I don't know why.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, especially in today's, you know 
L:  Mhm.  Compared to what the kids can read today like, you know, how to make a bomb and how to -- I mean, my daughter is internet -- net- net-
R:  Literate.
L:  Aware she can find anything she wants on there.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And I've taught her to do most of it, so what can I -- I'm just glad she -- she has enough sense to know the crap from the good stuff.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  And she comes to me too.
R:  Yeah, I mean, with all the stuff that they can -- I mean, even in comic books -- I -- I have looked at one of my nephew's comic books and they have sex scenes!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, my daughter's into the Anna May stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they're a little bit more warlike than I like, but still, it's -- it's Josie Johnner, it's Josie Johnner.
R:  Yeah, exactly, [MN], yeah.
L:  And -- and  you know, I just don't believe in censorship of any kind, or book burning or  you know, I think people should censor themselves.  Grown men can't do it so -- half the time.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Or grown women, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  Um, not to be a sexist.  And, uh 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I do --
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  You know, let -- let them write what will be written and let those -- those who want to read it, read it.  And let's just hope no bad ideas come out of it.
R:  Yeah, exactly, 'cause I mean -- you know, I think you sh- this is free country and, you know, that's one of the things that 
L:  Yeah, we go to war for it, you know?  We got to war for our freedoms and yes, if people can wear -- wear the American flag as underwear and, you know [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  And heck, they're doing it with the olympics with their swimsuits and everything.  How ca- how -- how can we complain about books?
R:  Yeah.  Exactly, you know, and we should, you know, enjoy the free choice.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We've been having the choice to --
L:  What part of the country are you in, Jason?
R:  I'm in Atlanta, Georgia.
L:  Oh, I'm up in -- in, um, Allentown, Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh.
L:  About sixty miles north of Philly.
R:  Oh, okay.  That's where you're originally from?
L:  Oh, this area more or less.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Lived in New York for a while after high school, but that got hard.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Moved back to this area.
R:  Oh.
L:  Atlanta must been awfully warm today?
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, it's, uh --
L:  We have had nice -- it's nice and warm here too but  I can't imagine living in the south, I would go nuts.
R:  What do you mean, the weather or --
L:  I mind the heat.
R:  Oh yeah, yeah.  I -- i- really I'm trying to move north, uh, actually.  Uh 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I like the cold weather and stuff.  You know, being from Miami and -- and the Christmas Days was ninety five degrees or so and you get a little tired of it.
L:  On Christmas Day?
R:  Oh yeah.  And --
L:  Wow, I can't believe that.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  I used to be really --
L:  I guess it's good for your bones, if you have achy bones.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah I'm -- but I -- [inaudible] I don't have to worry about that right now, so it's 
L:  No, I guess not.
R:  I'd definitely like to go north so 
L:  Oh.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  It's hard to talk for ten minutes about one subject when we both agree.
R:  Yeah, yeah, when you both agree, uh, it's kinda hard, but ...
L:  Uh.
R:  Now, what are you -- well, I guess we can take it another twist, how about censorship and writing, I guess it's the same thing pretty much?
L:  Well, how can you censor writing?  That's 
R:  Yeah.  Th- that's probably even worst.
L:  Yeah, I mean -- we're talking -- censorship as a whole is, you know, banning books from school, yeah, I mean, by age certainly.  And have age appropriate books in the school.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I can't see any school putting pornography in.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'm not talking about the classics, which them old ladies like to call pornography.
R:  Mm.  You talking --
L:  You know, to me D.H. Lawrence is not pornog- pornography, it's just literature.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, you can't censor writing it's -- or else you won't have any books at all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The -- the editors do that, is what I feel.  Yu- if it's good it's gonna get through.  If it's -- it's not, it's 
R:  Yeah, that's grad-
L:  But, no, kids should be able to read whatever is age appropriate to them and -- and gives them ideas for the new world and just let's hope that, you know, I di- I didn't kill me, it didn't hurt me and I read what I wanted.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Wish I could get my daughter to read more.
R:  Oh, ri-
L:  She's more into magazines and, uh, comic books than she is into, uh 
R:  Novels and stuff.
L:  Novels, yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  But she does read a few good ones for school.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I [COUGH] I must admit, you know, I was -- in school I wasn't a novel fan myself.
L:  No?
R:  But I could read fifty comic books in a day.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I grew out of comic books very young and I did -- I was a bookworm, I was always getting something out of the library.
R:  Mhm.  Mm, okay.  What kind of work do you do?  What k- what's your profession?
L:  Um, I am a merchandiser and secret shopper.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  What do you do?
R:  I'm an accountant.
L:  I w- I did that for a couple of years.
R:  Oh really?
L:  But I -- I can't work full time anymore, I'm disabled.
R:  Oh.
L:  So this is a kind of thing I can do on -- on days when I'm feeling good.
R:  Yes.  Oh, okay.  That's convenient.  Mhm.  So, uh  okay, yeah, well it's kinda hard when ya- we both agree, that's, uh --
L:  Okay, yeah.  So we've gotta talk about it for eight minutes anyway --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or we don't get paid for our phone call!
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah!
L:  I wonder how they do pay us, when we do get paid?
R:  Well, the la- the girl told me after the third call it takes about a month for you to --
L:  Oh, I'm not worried about it.
R:  Yeah, see I'm not --
L:  I'm just glad some that they're keeping me on their list.
R:  Yeah, mm.
L:  It's nice -- it's nice, I guess, to talk to perfect strangers, which you don't get to do very often.
R:  Yeah, but in a --
L:  From different parts of the country.
R:  -- in a controlled setting, you know.
L:  Uh, I wonder why they -- what -- what they are comparing?  I mean, the questions have been so weird, for me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can't remember the first one.
R:  Um 
L:  And this one seems totally off -- off the wall.
R:  Yeah, this is off the wall.  I think the first one's, if -- oh yeah, if you could win a million dollars, um, would you take the million dollars and lose your best friend or just turn down a million dollars?  [MN]
L:  And if you lose your best friend [inaudible] a million dollars, something's wrong.
R:  Yeah.  That -- that was the question for 
L:  I would think of becoming a better friend.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, that was  did you get that question too?
L:  No I didn't.  I don't remember what my first question was.
R:  Mm.  [inaudible].  Yeah, that's pretty good way to get information, you know 
L:  Mhm.  I just wish I knew what this -- the project was for, what they were doing it for.
R:  Oh, in respect of speaking.
L:  Different ways of speaking, you mean?
R:  Yeah.  I guess different  [MN]
L:  Because the last lady I talked to was from California.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Uh huh.
R:  Yeah, well the last person I talked to was in, uh, Florida.
L:  Hm.
R:  And the person before that was in, um, Austin.
L:  Oh, you got quite a -- quite a stretch too then, well?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  She was from Massachusetts.
L:  Oh, but, I wish this study would be less than ten minutes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess we just have to fill it with small talk now.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Something I'm not good at doing.
R:  [LAUGH]  So, uh, yeah, I -- I guess it's kinda hard.
L:  [MN]  You got kids yourself?
R:  No, not yet.  Uh --
L:  Not yet?
R:  I was waiting to do it the right way, getting married first.
L:  That's th- that's a good way to do it, I didn't do it that way.
R:  Mhm.  You only have one daughter?
L:  But I -- I also waited 'til I was thirty seven, which was not
