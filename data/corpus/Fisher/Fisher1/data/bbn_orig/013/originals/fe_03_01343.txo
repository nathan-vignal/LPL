L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  How are you doing? 
R:  I'm doing fine.
L:  My name is Tim.
R:  My name is Shirley.
L:  How are you doing, Shirley? 
R:  I'm doing great.
L:  Did you hear the, ah, topic? 
R:  Ah, um, about censorship on books in schools?
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Okay.  Um, well, I -- I don't feel that they have the -- the -- feels public or private schools have the right to, ah, censor reading.
R:  I don't either.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  We agree on that, huh? [LAUGH] 
L:  Absolutely.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, I just want to discuss why.
R:  Okay.
L:  Do you want to go first?  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I -- I just think that -- that should be parental decisions and not a school's decision.
L:  I absolutely agree with that.  I also -- I also -- I also think that, um, I think you limit the knowledge that a -- a child can achieve.
R:  Yes.
L:  By, um, censoring what they read.
R:  Yes, you do. [PAUSE]
L:  Do you have any kids?
R:  I've got four of them but my baby's thirty six years old.
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I don't have any so I guess that really doesn't affect us right now.
R:  No, no, it doesn't affect what's going on right now but we can still voice our opinions.
L:  Yeah.  [PAUSE] [SIGH] I agree with that. [SIGH] 
R:  I don't think censorship is, ah, censorship is not -- it's -- it's a family thing.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Parent to child, um, spouse to spouse as far as that goes but it's not a government thing and it's not a school thing.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, I guess I -- I definitely agree with you.  I think, um -- unfortunately I think our country, our nation is -- is getting toward, ah, more government involvement in a whole lot of areas that are typically [COUGH] reserved for parents.
R:  That's right.
L:  Such as --
R:  For family.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  For families, yes.
L:  And that's kind of scary, but -- 
R:  Well, you know, we're paying these people to do this.
L:  Yeah, that's, you know -- 
R:  You know.
L:  Censors.
R:  You know, and -- and we're getting government -- government's going to completely rule our life.  It's not -- we're not going to have the freedom.  You know, they're already trying that with guns.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They've been trying that for years with guns.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I live in a hun- in a hunting family.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, ah, handguns, I don't believe there's a, ah -- I don't know, I don't think they need to be as available as they are but if a crook wants them, he's going to get it anyway.
L:  Yeah, I think -- I think the -- the scariest part about the way our government is starting to censor different areas of our lives are --
R:  Mhm.
L:  The way that they tell us that this is what we want.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And for some reason we -- we buy it.
R:  Well, yeah.  Well -- and we don't have -- we don't really have rights.  Where do you live?
L:  I live in Georgia, Atlanta, Georgia right now.
R:  Okay.  I'm in -- well, I'm in Rocks Springs, Wyoming but I do live in Denver, Colorado.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, um, but, um, a few years ago, California, they took a vote so that they could, ah, um, not have to pay for all the immigrants that were coming in.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And the citizens, and -- and once a woman comes in and has a child, then they are a citizen and -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then the whole family can be a citizen.  Well, California voted against that and they appealed it and California lost.  Now, what's the use of having the public vote?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  If it's not going to stand up, what's the use of having it?
L:  I agree.  I -- I -- I mean -- I'm aware of, ah, that they did, um, have a vote.  I didn't -- I didn't follow it to find out what happened.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  That is interesting.
R:  They've voted that -- that, ah, people could not come in and just give birth to a child to make it a citizen, and, by God, the California -- some -- some place took California to court and they had an appeal.
L:  That is -- that is interesting.  I mean, unfortunately I agree with that law and I agree with the fact because that's a feder- that's a federal law not a state law.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I know that state laws can't pa- with -- the states can't pass laws that, ah, -- that, um, go against federal laws.
R:  Yeah, but -- 
L:  That was interesting all -- all. 
R:  That's -- that's true, but how many of us other states have the problem that California does that they have to support all these people?
L:  Mm.
R:  California and Texas and Arizona.
L:  And Florida.
R:  And Florida.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They get all these people that come in and -- and California's hit the worst because they come straight up from Mexico long enough to have a child and then the whole family can move in.
L:  Ah, I'm --
R:  And they're supporting them.
L:  I'm sure they are pregnant when they get here anyway.
R:  Well, well, yeah, they're pregnant.  They're ready to deliver.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They come in at eight months.
L:  Uh-huh, I'm sure.
R:  And, you know, they're not even established, they just come in long enough to have that child.  It's an American citizen.  Then the whole family gets to stay, and California is absolutely -- I mean, it's busting their budgets because they have to pay medical on all these people because they don't have jobs.
L:  Wow, that's interesting.
R:  Yeah, you know.  So -- so where is our freedom?  Our freedoms are being taken away more and more every day.
L:  Mm.  I -- I, like I said, I totally agree.
R:  Yeah, you know. 
L:  It's an interesting situation in California.
R:  Yeah, it is and, I mean, California is a big state, there's no doubt about it, but as you get more people that are not working, than are working, then it's going to affect the whole government.
L:  Mm.
R:  Not just California.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, so anyway, that's just my opinion for what it's worth. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, like I said, I -- I -- I definitely agree, um. 
R:  And what California voted on that for was to try and control it, not let these people come in -- in and in a week have a baby and then take up citizenship.
L:  Yeah, but -- 
R:  We're a free country and anybody has the right to live here, there is no doubt but that's not the way to do it.
L:  Mhm, I agree.  I agree.  That is actual fact, an actual fact.  [PAUSE]
R:  Okay, so what else do we have to do now?   
L:  I think we just have to keep talking about censorship.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, you did bring up -- I mean, you brought up an excellent point with the -- with the guns and -- and -- and the fact that we don't have freedoms.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And -- and, you know, like I say I just want to reiterate the fact that, you know, we're taking -- we're taking the -- the -- the raising of the children from the families.
R:  That's right.
L:  And just putting it in the hands of the government and what -- like, I said, what blows my mind is that they can tell us this is what we want and -- 
R:  That's right.
L:  And almost as if we were in a trance, we -- we -- we, you know, shake our head and agree, yeah, this is what we want and --
R:  And if we don't want it, what do we do to stop it? 
L:  If you talk -- if you talk to people, just, just, you know, people that you come in con- contact on a daily basis and you will see most of them agree with how you feel but yet the country is being ran -- ran in a different way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You -- you kinda of wonder, you know, where are all these people that want the country to be ran the way it's running for them to tell us, you know, this is what the people want.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- 
R:  Make the decisions for us and tell us that's what we've decided.
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yes, something else? 
R:  Yeah, we think -- we think alike.
L:  It's -- it's something else, I tell you.
R:  Yeah, it is.   
L:  [PAUSE] Yeah, and like I said, I -- I just -- it -- it amazes me how -- how -- how slow the learning curve would be or how -- how slow the learning would be itself if we were to censor the, ah, reading material, you know, on the kids in school.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because I mean, you know, do you gather so much knowledge on your own? 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  By reading.
R:  And censorship -- censorship is, ah, -- that should be a family thing.  It should not be a government thing.
L:  Mhm.  And -- and I don't want to say this in the wrong way but I -- I -- I somewhat equate the kids in school with the criminals and the guns.  If the kids want to get material that's censored, they're going to get it.
R:  That's right.
L:  Just like the criminals, if they want to get guns, they're going to get it or whatever, you know, whatever -- 
R:  That's right.
L:  Whatever's outlawed that, you know, it's always going to be a market for it.
R:  That's right, that's right.
L:  So, you know -- 
R:  That's right.
L:  I think it's a waste of time.  It's -- it's -- it's adding more bureaucracy as if we need that.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.
L:  Mhm, that's very interesting. 
R:  Yeah.  [PAUSE]
L:  But, um, [COUGH] like I said, I don't have any kids at this time, so -- 
R:  How old are you?
L:  I'm thirty one. 
R:  Oh, I'm thirty years older.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And there's no rush to have them, huh?  [LAUGH]
L:  No, no rush to have 'em.  I mean, you know, it's -- I've -- I've -- I've wrestled with that decision for a long time. 
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  As far as, you know, do I want to raise a kid and -- and, you know, in this country and this day and age. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I go back and forth, so, um, -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  As far as today, it's no.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No, next week, next month it may be different, but -- 
R:  Yeah, having the right person with you makes the difference.
