R:  Hi, my name is Jackie.
L:  Hi, my name is Gloria and I'm from New York.
R:  Oh, I'm on the other side.  I'm in Washington State [LAUGH].
L:   [LAUGH] Anyway the topic of the day is exercise --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and health fitness.  Well, actually I just started exercising, um, I'm doing the walk at home by Leslie Sandson and -- 'cause I'm like forty pounds overweight.
R:  Oh, I'm about fifty pounds overweight [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] And I go to Weight Watchers and, um, and what else do I do?  And I just bought another interesting tape because I'm into belly dancing also.
R:  Oh really?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's exciting.
L:  And also I just bought another Latin tape which one of my girlfriends recommended, which is good 'cause I'm -- I'm Hispanic so it comes easy.  The dancing comes easy.
R:  Oh.
L:  And you sweat.  I mean you really sweat.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's really worth the ten dollars I paid for it.
R:  Well, that's not very much money.
L:  So, um, --
R:  Yeah, okay.
L:  So, I'm getting there.  What about you?  What are you doing for exercise?
R:  Oh, I have a -- I bought that -- oh, I don't even know what it's called -- a gym thing that you -- it looks like you're gliding.
L:  Oh, okay.  The gazelle?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, I got that and I really like it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's, uh, been pretty cold and rainy here so I don't wanna get out and walk --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I thought, "Well, that's kinda a happy medium".  And, uh, I watch TV at night and I just get on it and away I go.
L:  Ah.
R:  I, uh, I haven't gotten up to my twent- -- you're supposed to do twenty minutes a day --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, twenty minutes like three times a week and I do probably ten minutes a day maybe every day.
L:  Oh, that's good!
R:  Well, I should be doing more.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Stretching -- stretching it a little bit but I just can't, you know, it's -- it's -- but it's -- I like it it's very smooth --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- um, my legs don't hurt, my knees don't hurt.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I like that part of it.  And then I got this silly thing, I don't know what it's called, I stay up late at night and I watch all the stuff on TV --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I'm -- I'm gonna quit doing it.
L:  Ah.
R:  Uh, body flex.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, and it looked really easy on TV and then you get it home and, oh, I did it one day [LAUGH].  I shoved it under the bed.
L:  Yeah.  If you stay up late night you -- you'll buy all those exercise stuff they sell, all the stuff they sell.
R:  Oh yeah, I do. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so I finally -- it's like I -- I just don't watch those channels [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  If I'm flipping through there, if I come to those I don't -- I don't watch 'em.
L:  I -- we  were just talking -- 'cause I just came back from my Mary Kay meeting and we're all on a diet all of us in one way or another [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And some of us are losing inches.  I guess we're all competing against each other.
R:  Oh, well that's good.
L:  Some of us are losing inches and others are getting upset 'cause they haven't lost a lot of weight and I was telling them maybe they're not eating enough 'cause I was just reading an article how if you don't eat enough you're body's like a, like a, gas.  If you don't put fuel in it it's not gonna burn it.
R:  Right, and it holds on to what you have.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  Do you drink a lot of water?
L:  Oh yeah, oh yeah because Weight Watchers recommends that you drink sixty four ounces of water a day.
R:  I'm on Nut- -- I do Nutrisystem.
L:  Oh, okay.  Uh-huh.
R:  But I got laid off in January and since then I sleep until noon, I get up and I take care of my birds and I go sit -- that takes like three or four hours and I go sit back down and I'm done.  I don't eat all day, you know, I don't drink my water and it's like, "Well, this isn't working".  I finally -- I canceled my -- 'cause I was automatically getting my food -- I've got three months worth of food sitting here.
L:  Wow.
R:  Because I don't eat.  I'm not hungry.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'm not losing weight.  I'm not gaining but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I need to get back into it.
L:  To boost up that metabolism.  You need to boost it up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's what the article was saying.  The girl was on Weight Watchers, she had a plateau, which is what happens, and she was still eating those calories and they said to her increase your calories so that your -- your body burns it and you'll lose more weight.  And then she started to lose inches --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- not weight per se but inches.
R:  Yeah.  That's great.
L:  So, you got laid off, you were in Corporate America?
R:  Uh, yup.  It was work to bowling[?].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Twenty four years.
L:  Wow, yes.
R:  And now it's like, you know, my mother keeps saying, "When are you going to get a job?"  It's like I don't wanna get a job [LAUGH].
L:  Well, you know, I got laid off from Corporate America also and I do everything part time.  I work part time as a bookkeeper, I do part time entertaining, I do -- I do part time Mary Kay and I do part time mystery shopping.
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I -- I tried that -- I tried that mystery shopping and they don't have anything in my area.
L:  Rea- I get a lot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I even get where the people call me, you know, the schedulers?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They call me and they double the price if the -- if the place is near my house.
R:  Wow!
L:  Anyway I -- I won't go past ten miles from my house.
R:  Well, good for you.  I --
L:  But I don't go out in the highways and stuff.  I do local driving so ...
R:  Really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, I'm glad it works for somebody.
L:  Yeah.
R:  In fact I've finally wrote and told them to send me my -- my initial money back because --
L:  You don't have to pay for none of them.
R:  No, you had to pay to join.
L:  No, none of them you have to pay.
R:  Well, I did.  I had to pay to join the shopping network thing.
L:  Really?  No, you don't have to pay to join any of the sites that -- that I've joined.
R:  Well, yeah, but you don't get -- you don't get the sites until you pay your money.  You don't -- they don't tell you all these sites.  I had --
L:  No, I had -- actually I had bought a book.  No, but it's on the website.  It's free.  It's called W.W.W. dot volition dot com.
R:  Really.
L:  And you have a lot of sites there that are free.
R:  Oh well, I paid.
L:  Oh no, I didn't pay.  Actually I bought a book because I wanted to.  I didn't know much about mystery shopping --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I bought a book, but I didn't have to pay.  And I've gotten my money back.  I wish -- I've -- I've done, um, interviews at Macy's, um, different places.
R:  Oh good.
L:  And I've gotten free dinners [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, good for you.
L:  And now we're doing the telephone [LAUGH].
R:  I know, yeah.
L:  It's interesting.
R:  Have you done very many of these?
L:  No, this is the second one.
R:  Oh yeah, it's my second one too.
L:  So, I don't know if they monitor it to make sure you're talking about the subject -- I don't know, I don't know how it works 'cause I haven't gotten my ten dollars from the other one.
R:  Yeah, I haven't either and I -- I did one and it was weird because when it was through it said -- you're told about the -- you know, when you hear the beep --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you can say something.  Well, I thought they were going to ask me questions so I just sat there and then it said, "Thank you" and hung up and it's like, "Well, wait a minute, I wanted to say something" [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, you -- you know what happened.  They called me about a half hour ago and they left me waiting like ten minutes and I hung up.  I said, "I'm not gonna ..."  I kept waiting for the person.  I guess they gotta call somebody.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I hung up.  So, that was already ten minutes that they got me [LAUGH].
R:  Oh my gosh.
L:  Yeah, so I'm like -- you know, now they call 'cause I usually do from ten to twelve I go through all my email and stuff and I could take phone calls and -- and answer all my -- all my -- I've gotten a lot of  -- in touch with my old friends through the Internet --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, you know, um, I'm responding to them.  They live in -- in Texas.  One of them lives in Atlanta.
R:  Yeah, isn't email wonderful?
L:  Yes, wonderful.
R:  It is.
L:  It's the best thing they've ever come out with, even for exercise.  I bought another -- I bought a book of Joe Cruise[?] or something, he came out on Oprah, and he says eight minutes every morning, which is weightlifting, he does a lot of weights --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that you could tone up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, so ...
R:  So, how long have you been on Weight Watchers?
L:  Um, I was on Weight Watchers -- I've been on Weight Watchers on and off 'cause I -- I go on it and then I lose it and then I relax and then I gain it back. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I would say for six years on and off.  But I don't go that often as I should -- weekly 'cause you really do need to stay motivated.
R:  Yes, yeah.
L:  You know, so ...
R:  See I don't have anybody around here that is dieting or exercising or anything so --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- I do have a girl at -- my Nutrisystem lady --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  She -- she sends me emails a couple of times a week, "How you doing?" you know and, "If you need help --"
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  And it's like, I don't wanna -- just leave me alone.
L:  Oh, you wanna be left alone.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No, but you don't want her to leave you alone because then you start eating.
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know [LAUGH].
L:  I guess because she gets on your nerve but maybe was a -- if it was a personal friend maybe it would be different.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Like the last lady I spoke to -- actually she was supposed to send me -- she was a coupon collector.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, she used to get -- she said she got all her groceries for free.
R:  Oh my gosh!
L:  So, she gave me her name and her thing and I sent her an email but she hasn't responded.  I don't know if I -- maybe I misspelled it or what.
R:  Oh.
L:  But, yeah, she says she gets up early in the morning, digs her coupons and then goes shopping and everything's free.
R:  Oh my word.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's hard to believe.
L:  Yeah.  She came from -- she was from Virginia.
R:  Huh.
L:  Yeah, but she -- apparently maybe her email was wrong.  Anyway, then I went on and most of the sites you gotta pay and I didn't wanna pay for no -- no coupon --
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  -- collection site [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Oh, I joined so many things and I -- you know, I send my money and -- and now I've been sitting here lately sending them back and saying, "I di- -- I never got whatever it is I was supposed to, send me my money back".  And they're doing it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I just -- I have to just quit doing it because --
L:  Especially since you're not working any more.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean I was looking to get more -- you know, another job of some kind but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- doing it on these get rich quick things on the computer --
L:  No.  They don't work.
R:  No, it doesn't.
L:  The rich schemes don't work.  Actually I would say I -- I come home with like two hundred, three hundred dollars a month in the mystery shopping.
R:  Really.
L:  Which is not bad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not bad.  Um, I try not to do too many like right now they just sent me one at -- at -- at the Roosevelt Mall which is not too bad and pays twenty five dollars.
R:  Huh.
L:  So, that's not bad.
