R:  Hi, this is Leeann.
L:  Hi, Leeann.  My name's Stephen.
R:  Hi.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm doing pretty good.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's actually my brother's name. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, easy to remember.
R:  Very odd.  Um, topic is minimum wage.
L:  Right.
R:  What did he say it was?  Five fifteen, five twenty five?
L:  I guess it's going up to that, yeah.
R:  I don't think that's enough, not for people who are trying to live on it.
L:  No, I -- I totally agree.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, for the teenager that's out there just making spare money, you know, on the weekends, that's plenty, but, uh, I remember when I was making that wage in college and it wasn't enough to even pay for the books, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  But then, on the other hand, I mean, if it goes a lot higher to where someone can support themselves, a lot of the businesses can't afford it.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  It's kinda one of those --
L:  So, it's kind of a catch twenty two.
R:  -- double edged swords there. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Brings all the prices up higher for everybody else, so we can't afford anything either. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  It's one of those hard areas of life where you just say, "Well, I guess you gotta go back to college now". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, you know, it's a terrible --
L:  It's true.  That's true, though.
R:  It's terribly true that you have to go to college now to be the manager of a Blockbuster for the rest of your life, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  It's -- it's really sick, but, you know, unfortunately that's the way it is.  So, I would think going up to five fifteen, hm, I thought it was already higher in this state.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  I guess I'm really out of touch. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I thought it was -- yeah, I thought it was, like --
R:  Six something.
L:  -- closer to six for some reason.
R:  Yeah, I did, too.  I d- -- maybe it's the minimum.  Maybe it's what they're considering the minimum, uh, [SIGH] you know, minimum requirement for -- and then the -- the states can have their own, I guess.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Right.
R:  I think it's higher here, I really do.  I think it's six something.
L:  What state is that?
R:  Oregon.
L:  Oh.
R:  I think it's just over six dollars here, but you know, like I said, I might be out of touch, too.  I haven't --
L:  Oh, really, different states have different minimum wages, huh?
R:  Oh, I think they do, yeah.
L:  Oh, I didn't know that.
R:  Yeah, I think they do.  You know, see how out of touch I am, I have no clue. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Just glad not to be making minimum wage personally. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  Personally glad my husband has a job, but you know ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, some people don't even have that these days.
R:  Well, he was teetering.  He was teetering.  His current company was going out of business and so --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- he had a six months looking for a job before he found, you know, something.  But, uh ...
L:  Oh, that's scary, huh?
R:  Yeah, it is. [LAUGH] [NOISE] But anyway ... [NOISE] ten minutes to talk about minimum wage. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's rou- -- that's rough, huh?
R:  I think mostly they're just looking at our linguistics patterns anyway or something like that.  I don't --
L:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it said it's a language study.  I do- -- so, I don't know how -- how much they're really listening to our topic, they just wanna give us something to talk about. [LAUGH]
L:  They just throw two strangers in the mix and see what happens, huh?
R:  There you go.  There you go.
L:  Kinda weird.
R:  And they say, "Hm, what'll happen?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I'm in Oregon.  Where did you s- -- did you say where you were?
L:  Um, no.  I -- I'm in California.
R:  Oh, well, not too far away.  Somewhere I've actually been in this country. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah --
R:  I haven't been too far, so ...
L:  Yeah, I've been up to Oregon, too.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  It's nice up there except it -- it seems to rain every time I go up there.
R:  Well, that's because it pretty much always rains here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's raining right now.  It's -- there's, like, you know, two weeks total during the whole summer where it doesn't rain.  No, I'm just kidding, it's more like four, but, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, man, doesn't that -- doesn't that get you so depressed?
R:  Not if you've grown up this way.
L:  Oh, you grew up up there?
R:  I mean, I've -- I've kinda grown up with it and -- and so actually for me when it's -- when I was in California it was, like, seventy degrees.  I was, like, hot, you know?
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And when it's, like, a hundred degrees or ninety degrees, you know, everybody thinks they're dying here, so ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's all in your blood stream.  I know people that moved from California to here and they went around wearing jackets most of the year for the first five years, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.
R:  Till they got used to it, but, yeah, yeah, anyway ...  La la la la la la ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Minimum wage, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [inaudible] minimum wage.
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] ten minutes, so ...
R:  Yeah, I mean, I don't own a business, so it wouldn't, you know, affect me directly, but I could see how it would totally, you know -- it would be difficult on the whole economy if you raised it too much at a time and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you can't raise it unfairly compared to how everybody else's wages are raised every year and ...
L:  Yeah.  But depending on where you live.  Like, if you live out here --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you couldn't even pay --
R:  You could spend -- [NOISE]
L:  -- you couldn't even pay a month's rent.
R:  Exactly.
L:  At -- you know.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You'd have --
R:  Yeah.  That's why I'm --
L:  Well, what do you do?
R:  That's why it lends me to think that there is [NOISE] some variation by state, and I'm just wondering if this is, like, the law for this is what your minimum can be for minimum wage or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, your dinner's coming, honey. [LAUGH] Cooking dinner while talking on the phone.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well.
L:  Oh, yeah, what's for dinner?
R:  Yeah, well, it depends on who's eating. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, sounds like over here.
R:  Yeah, we have a child with a lot of allergies, so she has her own little special meals.
L:  Oh.
R:  Mummy can't buy anything for her any more, so ...
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, but -- but the hubby and I, we're having the soft tacos when he gets home -- [NOISE]
L:  Oh, that sounds good.
R:  So, I'm getting everything made up for that. [LAUGH]
L:  Then you get this phone call, huh?
R:  Then I get the -- oh, I don't mind.  [NOISE] I already had -- waited on hold for about twenty minutes earlier and I gave up.  And then they just called back, so ...
L:  Have you done -- have you done this a lot?
R:  I have never done this before.  Have you?
L:  This is the first call I had.
R:  This is my first one, too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's funny.
R:  They actually called me today to set up the account --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- 'cause I just signed up a few days ago, so it was real --
L:  Oh, what --
R:  -- really weird.
L:  Yes.
R:  I didn't wanna give 'em my social security [NOISE] number online, so I didn't com- completely complete my registration.  So, they called me.  They must be desperate or something. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that is kinda scary, give that out.
R:  Yeah.  I don't feel comfortable with it, so I just -- and she said, "Oh, don't worry about it.  We don't need it".  "Oh?  Okay". [LAUGH] You better pay me, though. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] All right.
R:  We'll see.  We'll see.  If I don't see a check, I'll know why.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I've got their phone number, so ... [SIGH] anyway.  So, whereabouts in California?
L:  Uh, it's a town called Bulzura[?].
R:  North, south? [NOISE]
L:  It's, like, uh -- it's by San Diego.
R:  Oh, beautiful down there.
L:  Oh, man.
R:  Really beautiful down there.
L:  Yeah, it's the San Di- -- yeah, just inside of San Diego county.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I have --
L:  We get so spoiled with the weather down here.  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I have family that -- that, uh, live [inaudible] more distant family, but I've been there and it's just beautiful down there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just beautiful.  Very lucky.  Yeah, I live in Portland, so ...
L:  Well, you don't have to.  It's a free country. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  But, uh -- and my -- my, uh -- one child's actually in California right now doing Disneyland for the week for spring break, so ...
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  She's having fun.
L:  That's quite a nice trip.
R:  Yeah, they actually took the car, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  What, is it like a school thing or they just went on their own?
R:  Uh, no, she went with grandma and grandpa.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  Out there at all those restaurants, supporting the minimum wage workers. [LAUGH]
L:  That's right. [LAUGH] You're doing your part.
R:  Yes, we're doing our part to, uh, re- revitalize the economy. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Or -- or they are, at least.  I'm not. [LAUGH] I'm trying my hardest not to spend money. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, I know how you feel.
R:  Personally.  I have everything going on lately. [SIGH] Anyway ... la la la ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] How many minutes has that been?
L:  About half an hour, hasn't it? [LAUGH]
R:  Let me look at my -- my -- my phone here.  It's been nine and fourteen seconds, so we're --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- we're almost done.
L:  There we go.
R:  We're doing good.
L:  I wish we'd had a better topic.
R:  Yeah, yeah --
L:  Minimum wage, that's a rough one.
R:  -- 'cause minimum wage is, like, you either agree or you don't agree and --
L:  We agreed on it. [LAUGH]
R:  -- there's really not -- we could talk about the war.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, we'd be out here for, like, an hour at least, you know?
L:  I know.
R:  And then we could turn on the TV and talk for another hour, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, maybe there'll be a better topic next time.
R:  Yeah, there you go.  There you go.  I don't think they really care about the topic anyway, but --
L:  Probably not.
R:  -- we'll see.
L:  So, there's some scientist type listening to us right now, huh?
R:  Right.  Right.  So, do you do lots of surveys and interactive groups and stuff like that or ...?
L:  Just -- I just kinda, you know, found out about all this stuff, so ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  This -- how 'bout -- not -- not me.  How 'bout you?
R:  Um, as far as the surveys and things like that go, yeah, I've been doing them for about two years now.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, doing the contests and things like that, just getting a little extra on the side, you know.
L:  You find that stuff on the net or something?
R:  Yeah, on the Internet, yeah.  I just won a trip to New York last month.
L:  Congratulations.
R:  Yeah, I haven't gone yet, but that's the furthest I've ever been, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What was that on?
R:  What was that on?  It was on, um -- it was sponsored by Disney and it was on this check making site where they make your checks and they'll print little pretty pictures on 'em.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I just went and signed up for it, so we get a trip for two and a Broadway show and accommodations for four nights and a city tour --
L:  Man, that's --
R:  Yeah, a city tour and --
L:  That's a decent prize.  Holy.
R:  -- a gift certificate.  It's, like, five thousand five hundred dollars.
L:  Yeah, that's not cheap.  Wow.
R:  It's really exciting 'cause, you know, we wanted to go see ground zero and all that, so ...
L:  Right.
R:  So, yeah, that's my big highlight of the year.
L:  Wow, yeah, that's good.
R:  It's a little consolation prize for having to move and scale back in life, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  For the new job. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Yeah, sometimes that happens.
R:  Is the economy affecting you any at all? [NOISE]
L:  Um ...
R:  Got your job still, doing good? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, it's affected us a little bit, but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, doing -- we're doing okay over here.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Well, that's good.  That's good.  [SIGH] It's gotta be over ten minutes now.
L:  I know.
R:  Hm.
L:  So, do you have DSL on your computer?
R:  I sure do, yeah.
L:  Does seem to make it a lot faster, huh?
R:  Oh, my gosh.  My, uh, [NOISE] dial up used to quit on me all the time, you know.  They would get overloaded and -- and it would bump me off of whatever I was doing and -- oh, my gosh, it was just -- the first time I used it I was in shock, and then I was addicted.  But, you know, [LAUGH] it's like, oh, my gosh, I can open twenty windows at one time, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Not that you'd ever need to.
L:  But [inaudible].
R:  Well, actually, I do sometimes, but, you know. [LAUGH]
