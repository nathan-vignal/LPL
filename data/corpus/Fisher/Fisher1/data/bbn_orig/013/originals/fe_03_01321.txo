L:  Bayliss Lee[?].
R:  Uh, Pat Greg.  And no, I don't -- I think publicly owned places can ban smoking, certainly, but I don't think privately owned public places, uh, the government should make that decision for them.
L:  I agree.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We don't have a lot to talk about, do we? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Are you a smoker?
L:  No.  My husband is, though.
R:  Are you a former smoker?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm a former smoker.
L:  You -- are you?
R:  Yes.  And it's been a number of years and I quit cold turkey and I'll never do it again.
L:  Well, that's great.
R:  Uh, however, I do think those people that want to have the right to do it if they choose to.
L:  I do, too.  But then I think, too, that, you know, um, I had a, um, friend who, um, got lung cancer from secondhand smoke.
R:  And never smoked a day in -- in --
L:  And never smoked, mhm.
R:  Yeah.  So, I mean, how do you -- how do people rationalize that?
L:  I don't know because, you know, you think it's so unfair but then again I think everybody from the First Amendment have their rights, you know.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, now, we can definitely -- because, you know, y- years and years ago people could smoke at their desk --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- because we had, you know, 'cause I remember in the workplace they could smoke at their desk if they had ashtrays.  You know, they -- they weren't --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- didn't have to go outside or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- go into a restricted area just to smoke.  Only until I think the legislature and people got behind it that -- you know, did they actually start to make, you know, rules for -- and I -- I sometimes feel sorry for the smokers in the wintertime having to have to go outside to smoke. [LAUGH] Or in the rain. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, because if that's the choice, you know, I think they should have at least an area for them, you -- like, at the airport.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, my husband and I was going through the airport in Atlanta and they have a designated room.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Now, [MN] of course, the ventilation was absolutely horrible in there 'cause I walked in there, but I couldn't --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- take it too much, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I just had to leave him in that room and get -- and get out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because it just was too bad.
R:  Yes.  I don't -- I don't allow anyone to smoke in my house or my car.
L:  Right.  Now, I don't --
R:  And it's --
L:  -- like 'em smoking in my car, but in my house I -- I -- I don't really, um, push the issue if they smoke because my husband smokes and he pays the mortgage, and he told me that if he paid the mortgage he was gonna smoke [LAUGH] in his house.  I said --
R:  Well, but, I mean, you live with him and you knew that he was, so --
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's different, mhm.
R:  -- you know, you kind of have to pay the price.  But, I mean, if I choose to go to -- if -- if a restaurant --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- makes its own decision that they want to be a non smoking restaurant --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, there are certainly a ton of us that are gonna go there.
L:  Right.
R:  If the food's horrid, I'm not gonna go there regardless.
L:  That's exactly right, you know.
R:  Um --
L:  Whether people smoke or not, [MN] you know --
R:  Whether people smoke or not.
L:  Mhm.  I agree.
R:  So, I don't feel -- I don't know.  My sister is the only one left in our family that smokes.
L:  I'm trying to get my husband to stop so badly because he -- he's -- he's, um, he's overweight.  Not overweight overweight, you know, but overweight for our -- our age now, you know.  Um, well, I guess you'd say he -- he's about six -- six one but he weighs about two thirty.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, that's not too bad, but -- but it -- I guess we were so much smaller twenty years ago [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- when we got married.  And I guess it's just that, um, he's been smoking the whole time so I wish that he would, you know, stop.
R:  Stop.  Does he -- does money impress him?
L:  I beg your pardon?
R:  D- does money -- does the money issue get to him?
L:  Um, no, mhm.
R:  Because that's one of the things that I say to people is, you know, if you smoke --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- three packs of cigarettes a week, that is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, ten dollars.
L:  [NOISE] Okay, it's -- uh, yeah, because they're, like, three ninety nine a pack.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  And --
R:  -- if you're talking, like, eleven dollars a week times fifty two --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, that's five hundred and seventy two dollars.  You can take a vacation.
L:  Yeah, you could.
R:  For that. [LAUGH]
L:  Really could.  And I think he probably -- um, maybe cl- -- if he's not a pack a day he's close to a pack a day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and, uh, and like I said --
R:  I think I did that wrong.
L:  -- and high blood pressure run in his family and, you know, those kinds of things, and he drinks and, you know, those kinds of things I wished he, you know, because of all of that I wish he would stop smoking.
R:  Okay, he's -- I did that.  I did that calculation incorrectly.  If you smoke a pack a day and it costs four dollars for a pack --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's about -- it's almost fifteen hundred dollars a year.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  That's a lot -- that's almost an IRA.
L:  It is.  It really is.
R:  You know, and it -- that exponentially is gonna increase in value. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, it sure is.  And it just keep going up and up and up.
R:  That's a lot of money.
L:  It sure is a lot.
R:  So, yeah, I'm too cheap.  I wouldn't be able to do that. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  But he -- he has -- he has no problem about that.
R:  Yeah, huh.
L:  He has no problem with paying that.
R:  So, do you work?
L:  Yes.  Mhm.
R:  And where you work, are they allowed to smoke?
L:  Uh, outside, only on the patio, like a little patio area.
R:  Yeah.  Are those your kids?
L:  No.  Um, I work in a school but it's a proprietary school.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Okay.  But, um, that -- they smoke outside.  You know, they have to smoke outside.  It's a non smok- -- the building is non smoking.
R:  Yeah.  Ah, isn't that interesting.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you're at work right now?
L:  No, I'm at home.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I hear lots of noise in the background.
L:  That's because we have the, um -- we rented a -- this DVD, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or bought it, rather.  It was, uh -- what is it?  After -- Friday [inaudible], yeah, that's it.
R:  Oh, okay.  Never heard of it.
L:  And my husband happen to have the TV always has it so loud.
R:  Oh, is he -- has he -- does smoking affect his hearing? [LAUGH]
L:  No, he just -- for some reason it's because he got that, um, that bowls entertainment center, you know --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- in the -- in the house and so he likes to be in -- like he's in a theater or something. [LAUGH]
R:  Surround sound.  Surround sound.
L:  Right, that's it, surround sound.  That's it.  I'm going like --
R:  Well, do you go -- I used to bowl and I would come home and wash everything.  I mean, I wouldn't even wear a coat in because I knew I was gonna come home smelling like cigarette smoke.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And, um, and I'm not so sure that's where I didn't really get asthma --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- or that it wasn't complicated by that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then, um -- but it's, uh, anybody that knows me knows that, uh, they cannot smoke in my house or my car.
L:  Right.
R:  But if they wanna go someplace with me and they smoke --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm happy to stop as many times as I need to.
L:  Okay, yeah.
R:  But that means -- that means we need to leave an hour earlier.
L:  Right.
R:  So, if we need to be there by eight in the morning, we have to leave at seven.
L:  Oh, okay.  I see.  I see.
R:  So ... and -- and I think that's fair for me.
L:  It is.
R:  It is, and I would rather drive because if we go in their car then --
L:  Car then you can't -- you don't have a choice if --
R:  I don't have a choice.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, some people, like my girlfriend, um, my husband smokes and she doesn't and she -- and she doesn't allow it in her house, so he smokes out on the patio when we go visit her.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But if she's in our car, he's gonna smoke and she's gonna fuss and [LAUGH] that's gonna be a back and forth thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and so if we go in hers then he can't smoke, and so he'd rather go in his and he said he'll never go any more without his car [LAUGH], you know, so ...
R:  Well, and I can understand his point.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, I don't understand people's point in airplanes because people --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- the people who don't smoke don't have any place to go.
L:  No, they don't.  And you remember when airplanes did have that, you know.  Airplanes, um, you know, they -- they, uh, at one time --
R:  Had smoking areas.
L:  -- it was in the back of -- in the back of the plane was, uh, the smoking area.
R:  Right.  But all it -- I mean, even then I said, you know, all we're doing is recirculating the same air.
L:  Right.
R:  How can this be?
L:  That's exactly right.
R:  This is, uh -- this is not a viable thing we're doing here.
L:  No, uh-uh.  But so they just stopped all of the -- stopped all of that smoking.  So, really it doesn't bother me now.  My husband and I take a flight, [SIGH] you better believe he can't wait till he gets off that plane [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and goes to that -- that little room. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  To suck a cigarette.
R:  Well --
L:  I guess it's addictive, though.
R:  It is very addictive.  It's very a- -- and I always thought that [NOISE] I was more addicted because I not only smoked, but I smoked menthol.
L:  Right, yeah, he smokes menthols, too.
R:  But I never smoked till I got to my office.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Now, my sister, when her feet hit the floor --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the morning, she's got a cigarette.
L:  W- -- oh, okay.  Well, if --
R:  So, I think she's -- I think there's an addictive level that I have no knowledge of.
L:  Oh, okay, because believe me, the first thing in the morning, he picks up his cigarettes. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I just think that there's something -- something happened there that is so much more addictive than what I knew.
L:  Right.
R:  And I wish -- I wish somebody could come up with -- I mean, I know my sister wants to quit.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I also know that --
L:  And I know my husband does, too, but he just -- he does not have the willpower or the stamina to stop.  And believe me, my h- -- my daughter has been -- she's been trying to get her dad to quit smoking.  We only have one child, and [LAUGH] he tried and believe me, before the week was out we wanted to go buy him a carton of cigarettes ourselves.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  God, he was a bear.  I thought -- I told her, I said, "Kalanza[?]", I said, "Let's just go get him a pack of cigarettes because we're gonna kill him. [LAUGH] He is going to be dead".
R:  He needs to, like, go in the -- go in the service or something and be away for six months.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And quit while he's gone. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Ain't that the truth.  I mean, he was a bear.  I was like, "Oh, if cigarette smoking make you act like this, then you just don't need to give it up.  You just need to go on and smoke --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- because you're about to drive us crazy". [LAUGH]
R:  Is this your first call like this?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  It is mine, too, so I have --
L:  Is it?
R:  I have no expectation as to what's going to happen.
L:  Oh, I don't either.  I just did it for a survey part.  I was like, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and plus I like to talk anyway, so no big deal.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And my --
R:  Well, I -- I didn't know whether you
