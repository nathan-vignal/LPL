R:  Oh, this is Jason.
L:  Hi, Jason, this is Ellen.  How are you today?
R:  All right, how you doing?
L:  Good.  Where do you live?
R:  I live in Atlanta, Georgia.
L:  Well, I’m in -- down here in Bradenton, Florida.
R:  Oh, okay.  I’m originally from Miami.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, I just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I’m really from Hawaii and I just moved here in September and I’m still, you know, checking it out.  I don’t know, I might go back to Hawaii, I don’t know yet.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So anyway, I guess we’re not supposed to talk about that, we’re supposed to talk about censorship.
R:  Censorship.  Um --
L:  D- d- did they tell you, did you hear it -- about it?
R:  Yes, yes, I heard, uh-huh.
L:  And, um, I happen to be a teacher and it said something about, “What do you think about censoring books in the schools?”
R:  Right, um, does private schools, um, have the right to, um, decide what’s books students read?  That’s what -- I think that’s what I heard, right?
L:  Yeah.  I think I might have heard public or private but I don’t think it makes any difference --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because, well, I’ll just say that I don’t agree with it.  I don’t agree with censorship.  I’m not saying I wanna bunch of swear words in there for my kids, but, um, I mean, I’m talking about my students now, I don’t have my own kids, but, um, [LIPSMACK] I think censorship is wrong --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because for one, you know, well, okay, some of these people like, with Harry Potter, they think that that’s like, the devil or sorcery or something.
R:  [LAUGH]  Right.
L:  But, you know, it just depends how you take it, there’s value in everything, right?
R:  Right.
L:  So I don’t know, that’s my opinion.
R:  Now, can I ask you, what -- what -- what -- what are the ages of your students?
L:  Well, um --
R:  I mean, what grade or rather -- rather?
L:  I’ve taught all grades actually, but mostly like, sixth grade and then also third grade and also first grade.
R:  Oh.  Because the reason why I ask you, because, you know, I think, I -- I’m against censorship as well, um, because I think that if it should matters -- it should matter only, you know, in the way that the writers can best express themselves.  Um, and if a writer feels more comfortable using, uh, the -- society’s, you know, um --
L:  Vernacular or whatever the word is.
R:  Vulgar -- vulgar words or whatever you wanna say.  You know, I mean, if it makes it -- that’s the way he feels, you know, I think --
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  -- I think that he should have the right to use it and I think students who, uh, feel, you know, more comfortable reading, you know, a book that’s more open-minded --
L:  Well --
R:  -- like [inaudible].
L:  And if we were being like, teachers like -- what do you do?
R:  I’m an accountant.
L:  Okay.  Well, pretend you’re a teacher for a minute.  I think -- and I just got off the phone with some principals and stuff here -- that what we need to do is decide what -- what grade level it would be.  So, you know, if we agreed -- I think we do, we sound like we’re kind of of the same mind that like, high school kids are gonna swear among themselves anyway and it’s --
R:  Right.
L:  -- their choice like, after sixteen to either swear or not swear, even though, you know, it’s not appropriate in the classroom.  But, if they choose to read a book like what you’re talking about, I would say, “Okay”.  And yet the idiots at fourteen [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- don’t let me taint that at all with that word, idiot, but let’s just say they’re not able to discern the difference between, “Well, this book had a bunch of swear words so I’m gonna go and swear at you, the teacher, and all these kids around me”.  You know what I’m saying?
R:  Right, right.
L:  So it -- it definitely has --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- to do with the age, yeah?
R:  Yeah.  I -- I agree.  Um, you know, I -- I -- I think when I -- I didn’t -- like, I wrote that way in college and, uh --
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that’s the reason why I asked, you know, how old your students were.  But, you know, it wasn’t like every other word was a curse word, you know, or whatever.  But it was just --
L:  Right.  Well even in poetry like sometimes you have to, you know, get more colorful.  But -- and it --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- but sometimes it’s not effective like --
R:  Exactly, exactly.  I mean, if I was writing a book on, uh, I don’t know, religion or something, of course I wouldn’t use, you know, s- a lot of those words.  But, you know, certain other topics I think that it definitely gives a creative edge.
L:  See, you know what I think they’re getting at?
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  I think they’re talking about like, that religious issue, like that creationism thing or whatever it is, that some of these religions -- and I’m talking more like, I don’t know what, I don’t think it’s Jehovah’s Witness that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- believes that, but those kids, if they’re in my class the parents like, tell you up front, that they can’t celebrate their birthday, they can’t go to a dance, they can’t celebrate Christmas --
R:  Oh yeah, yeah.
L:  -- they can’t do any of this stuff, okay?  Now, I’m not sure if they’re the ones but somebody out there --
R:  Yeah, that’s -- that’s it, yeah, that’s it.
L:  You know, they’re saying, I mean, i- i- I don’t even know about like, Islam and all those people, what they think about this.  I’m still trying to figure out all those religions, I’m just --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- working with the ones around America here.  But they -- they have these movements and -- and they tell the school -- and this girl I heard about through my mom, from my high school, turned into a big holy roller and she’s been fighting the school board like, this, um, I don’t know, some book that normally is no problem, like, Stuart Little or something, and they say, “Yes, but Stuart Little” -- are you still there?
R:  Yeah, I’m here.
L:  Okay.  Like, “That really is about, um, heaven and hell and, um, in that -- in that God didn’t create” you know, whatever.  You know, that’s -- that -- that --
R:  Yeah, they --
L:  What do you call it?
R:  They, you know, they come from these fanatical views, you know, you know, but totally off the wall, you know.  But, yeah, I -- I’ve heard all kinds of different interpretations of different things, you know, like Harry Potter for instance, it’s a perfect example.  Um --
L:  Yeah.  That they think it’s like the devil or something.
R:  Witchcraft, yeah.
L:  And so they would be like, yep, dead set against that.  And okay, that’s banned, and so -- I mean, as a teacher, of course I would respect that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That I’m not gonna force them.  I would have an alternate choice because, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- our thing is to be more sensitive to everybody.  You wouldn’t force them to read it, whereas when -- I don’t know how old you are, but you sound like more my age, like forty something?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Are you younger?
R:  Uh, I’m -- I’m younger, I’m thirty, thirty one.
L:  Oh, you’re a youngun.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  But -- but anyway, like, thinking back a couple of years, you know, like when I was in high school, I mean --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they made you read the stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You had to read that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Whatever it was.
R:  So let me ask you a question then.  Do you think if you seen a student who wrote that way or, you know, wanted to read a book or whatever --
L:  Well, I would say, “I can’t accept it” because I teach elementary school, so I can’t have any swear words.
R:  I mean, let’s say if you were a high school teacher.
L:  High school?
R:  Uh, [several inaudible words].
L:  I would have to see what my staff was telling me.  They might have a policy which, of course, I would adhere to the school’s policy because if you don’t have a policy the place is a shambles.  Now, let’s say they’re really hip and to a point that, you know, Catcher In The Rye and some of these stories where they throw in a little bad word here and there for effect and they’re -- they’re hip to that.  I would say, “Okay”.  But I’m not gonna like -- I’ve learned over the years, you don’t wanna butt the principal and make some kind of stand, “Well, I demand that my kids are allowed to swear in their creative writing” you know?
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Because it’s not worth it.
R:  Yes.
L:  It’s like, to me that is so small at this time.  The bigger idea is such -- more, you know, it’s so much more important.
R:  That’s true.  That’s true.
L:  But -- see, if you censor something, let’s say it is high school and it’s like, world, uh, history and then you’re talking about different religions and -- and you have to -- you’re not allowed to teach anything, this could even be happening today and we don’t even know it.  Like -- like, say you’re not allowed to teach anything about Islam or, you know, this whole part of the world where we’re at war and all these religions.
R:  Mm.
L:  So how are they ever gonna know?
R:  Right.
L:  You know what I mean?  They block off what exactly would help them to come to a better comprehension of what it’s all about.
R:  Right.  They are given a choice to choose, you know, what -- what they feel comfortable with.  It’s just here it’s, “Take this” and that’s it, “Get outta here” you know, sorta like a communist country, you know, but --
L:  Exactly.  That’s exactly what I think of with censorship.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because look at --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we’re so lucky in America and that came up during the whole --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- thing with Iraq, I kept reminding the kids, you know, “We are so lucky, look at the freedoms we have compared with so many other countries”.
R:  That’s true.  That’s true.
L:  And -- and, you know, if you don’t like it, I mean, some people -- I’m not gonna say, “If you don’t like it, get out” --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I’m like, “If -- if you’re saying you don’t understand what kind of freedoms you have in this country, let me tell you about a few other countries”.
R:  Yeah.
L:  “And what they do to their people like, in China”.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, they put you in jail for, you know, saying anything bad against the Pres- the leader or anything against their ideas, or  -- or maybe even in front of a gun squad, you know?
L:  Yeah, I was just gonna say, “Or worse” besides the imprisonment.
R:  You know?  So, I mean, yeah, that’s what I -- I was in the military and I definitely don’t take my freedoms of democracy for granted.
L:  There you go.  What were you in with?
R:  Navy.
L:  Oh, right.
R:  Yeah, I was actually in prison
