R:  Hey, I'm Lars.
L:  Hi, this is Neil.
R:  Hey, Neil!  How's it going?
L:  Doing good.  Uh, where you from?
R:  Uh, Seattle.  You?
L:  Oh, from, uh, Texas but I'm actually in California, I'm just going to school in Texas.
R:  Oh, cool!  So, uh, the topic of conversation is, uh, censorship in schools.  What do you think?
L:  Uh, I think things should be censored, but I mean, but like, they're selling books now that certainly should not be allowed to be read in class.  I mean, I -- I agree with that.
R:  Like, uh, what sort of books?
L:  I mean like, if there's a -- s- say like there's a total anti-black book out there, you know, or -- or a racially stereotype book and I -- I -- I mean, obviously you can't read it in class 'cause then all the African American citizens would be offended by it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So  but I --
R:  What -- um, do you think there's some value in reading books like that, like for example, um, you know, one thing that I could see it being positive is that, uh, it could make people aware of just how racist other people can be, right?  So, you know, being -- I'm trying to think of some -- some things that I've read in the past where, you know, if you read someone who has like a really messed up point of view --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it makes you realize like, um --
L:  Yeah, how people are -- because they're [several inaudible words] in the world.
R:  Right, exactly.  How bad -- how bad people can think.  And then, you know, I'm ok- I'm okay with people reading books like that, as long as they read it in the right context, right?  You know.
L:  Mm.  That's true, but I mean, but like, there's like some books out there like, that have no value at all educationally, you know?  And like, but like, the thing that I'm against is like -- like, Huck Finn they use the word that -- they use the N. word in there a few times.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so I heard like, some schools are thinking of -- of banning reading Huck Finn.  But I mean, like, Huck Finn is a classic book that shouldn't -- that shouldn't be banned just because of a few words, because the -- back in the days, I mean, that -- that's how it was, you know, it develops cultural context of the -- of the text.  So, banning a book like that would -- would -- would offend me.
R:  Uh huh.
L:  Like, it would bother me.  But like, banning other books probably wouldn't bother me like, you know, like say -- I -- I -- I really like some books how valuable -- like, books to have a view or value.  I agree with them not being read in class.  Well, I mean, [LIPSMACK] it should be up to -- or it should be left up to the schools to decide 'cause there -- there might be some schools who are -- you know, has more value than other schools.  Just depending on the region of where you are.
R:  So, um, what, uh, like, what do you mean in terms of banning?  Are you -- are you talking about banning in terms of, um, school including them in the -- their curriculum, banning in terms of schools not having 'em in the library, like, um, or banning people from like --
L:  Probably not in -- not -- probably not including them in the curriculum.  I'm sure like, if you, if people are interested in just like, researching it then, I mean, by all means have it in the library but, yeah, I just think -- I guess not having in it the curriculum.  Or if -- if someone was just reading it at school then it's their own free will to read it wherever they want to, but I mean, let's like, not keep it as part of the curriculum.
R:  Yeah.  Good [inaudible], that sounds totally reasonable to me.  Um, how about, uh, let's see, uh, I don't know, are there any other types of books you think should be kept out of, uh, the school system or ?
L:  Well, when I went to school mostly all we read was just classics and like, a few new books, like Catch Twenty Two, I guess, was like one of the newer books that we read.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But e- even that was fifty years old.  So like, through my experience, because I -- I'm a sophomore in, uh, college so, uh, I -- I almost just graduated high school a few years ago, so I mean, there weren't even that really -- that many charge books.  I mean, the -- the only I remember is Huck Finn, that -- that's 'cause it used the N. word in there.
R:  Right, right.
L:  So  and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, every other book -- I mean, most books I read are just classics.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So 
R:  So, what do you think, I just heard, uh, on the radio the other day that, uh, somebody wrote a book, uh, basically claiming that you don't have to pay your income taxes.  He said like, if you actually look at the laws there's no --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- nothing in the constitution and --
L:  I heard about that, I heard about that.
R:  And they just -- they just put an injunction on that book, so it's illegal to sell it and buy it.  Huh.  It's pretty mess-
L:  I mean, uh, I think that's the -- I think it's not so good that they stopped writing, um, because if it's free, I mean, even though like, have you heard of The Anarchist Cook Book before?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like -- it's where it teaches you how to make bombs and stuff.  Like, if you go to a bookstore you can still buy that book.  But I st- I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- don't see why you shouldn't -- you shouldn't be allowed to buy this book as well.
R:  Right.
L:  Just because like, it's about the government this time, they're -- they're all getting -- they're getting upset about it.
R:  Right, I agree.  I mean, I think it's good to have information out there, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, there's the whole thing too about, uh, the government now requiring that bookstores share their information --
L:  Yeah, I [several inaudible words] that.
R:  -- with the Department of Homeland Security with what books you're buying, which I think is really messed up.
L:  Yeah.  Like, if -- like, even if you -- you go to the library and check out a book sometimes like, you know, like there's some libraries that say like, we, you know, uh, "We're sorry but we have to comply with this like, every -- you know, you might be being watched whatever book you check out".  I think that's totally messed up because, I mean, it's up to -- it's up to someone that -- they might be used for innocent research and then -- and they'll probably get tagged because they're reading this book.
R:  Right, exactly.  Well, well, this debates kind of, uh, [LAUGH] I think it's just not a lot to talk about 'cause we agree on it!  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  And all it does is you debate, 'cause, I mean, like, we agree on most of these things, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, it's kinda hard to   So I guess --
L:  I'm so pretty much against most of this, uh, national -- national security stuff 'cause all it is just nonsense that they're just -- they're just trying to like, make you feel secure about, it just creates more of a hassle than anything else.
R:  Yeah, completely.
L:  It just -- it makes you -- it just makes people think they're safe when actually they're -- they are not even, I mean, it's actually less safe because they're -- they're -- they're thinking, "Oh, there's so much to be able to protect me so I'm not gonna need to keep my -- my -- my defenses up".  And then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that could end up getting even more -- more dangerous because the people aren't really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- watching around what's going on.
R:  I totally agree.  I'm -- I'm totally think our civil liberties have been completely, uh, you know, attacked for the last twenty years.  I'm, uh, like, my, uh -- m-
L:  Especially these last few years.
R:  Yeah, I know.  It's really -- it's really quite -- quite -- quite scary.  Um, are you familiar with like, the Rave Act at all?
L:  No.  What now?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  It's called The Rave Act.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, sort of been nicknamed.  It's a -- it's a law that just got passed last week.  They've been trying to pass it for two years now.  And basically what it says is that anyone that throws a social event, so that could be like, a party --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- a dance, an art thing, you know, whatever it might be, anyone that sols- a -- throws a public event, um, if they ha- if they could reasonably believe that somebody at the event might be using illegal drugs, the person that threw the event is responsible.
L:  Yes, they could be [inaudible] for it.
R:  Yeah, is responsible for prison time and like, up to half a million dollar fine or something, which is just ridiculous 'cause --
L:  Yeah.  The -- but like, doesn't look like, the same thing with like, Napster.  Like, Napster's just a indexing service and then -- like, people use it to trade music and so they -- they're going after Napster [inaudible] um, because of Napster that it's happening.  It's almost like a similar thing, you know.  They're only after the main person instead of attacking the individuals, in a way.
R:  Right.
L:  Like, did you ha- did you happen like, I think it was like, I think it was like, three or four days ago, some college student, they -- they indexed the college network was the monthly, I mean, the most college students don't have his music and movies on the computers, right?
R:  Uh huh.
L:  So they created like a -- a program so they could, uh, search all the computers on the network.  And so what happened was that MR -- MIA sued them for ninety eight billion dollars.
R:  You're kidding!
L:  I think every song was a hundred and fifty thousand dollar copyright violation.  Even though --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- a- all they did -- all they did was make a indexing service that -- that had nothing to do with music.  So, I mean, if you search for the word music, you'll get music.  But all they made was the indexing.  And -- but they -- --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- they still got sued for ninety eight billion dollars.
R:  It's ridiculous.
L:  Ridiculous.  Like --
R:  It seem -- it seems like the -- the, uh, record industry is really short sighted, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They should have started doing subscription based model years ago and, you know, they're -- they're like, living with old technology and, you know, even if I go out and buy a CD, the first thing I do is rip it to MP3 because it's more convenient to use that way, you know.
L:  Exactly, yeah.  Like, uh --
R:  Um 
L:  I just -- I just bought the Linkin Park CD but I -- I couldn't read -- I -- I -- I made a copy of it because I don't want the original to get damaged, you know?
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  Like -- and like -- like there's some CDs now that have copy, like -- like, you can't copy 'em even if you buy it.  I mean, I'm like, it's my own property, I can do whatever I want with it, you know, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you've got to have some [inaudible] some things.
R:  It's ridiculous.  You should be able to make a back up copy and stuff like that under, uh, their use.  But, yeah.  So, um, have you been doing this phone thing before or is it your first time?
L:  It's my first time, it's my first call actually.  I was in the shower and I got a call and they called back.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They're like, "Yeah, this is Fisher".  I was like, oh, like, what shall I do?  It was like, oh, they'll probably call again.  So then they just called like, three or four minutes later.
R:  Oh, yeah.  It's pretty funny, this is my first time too.
L:  This is your -- this is your first call too?
R:  Yeah, it's my first call too.
L:  Are you a college student?
R:  Uh, no, I, uh, I work at the university but I finished college a long time ago.
L:  Uh, w- what -- what university do -- do you work at?
R:  Uh, University of Washington.
L:  Oh, not bad.  Uh, yeah, I -- I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I go to UT Texas, a law student right now.
R:  Oh, cool, that's great!  I've been to, uh, UT Austin a number of times, I've some friends that went there.
L:  Oh, [inaudible] yeah.  It's a really good [inaudible] --
R:  Austin was, um --
L:  Yeah, it's a lot of music.
R:  What's that?
L:  Yeah, it's a lot of music, like, uh, um, I'm sure you went to [inaudible] Street right?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Night time there.  Whole bunch of bars and all those kinds of things.
R:  Cool.  Have you heard of a festival out there called the Flipside?
L:  No, I've never heard of Flipside before, no.
R:  It's a really good -- it's, uh, like a, like, music festival type thing that's out there, it's really good.  Memorial Day weekend.  Just check it out.
L:  Yeah.  Just recently had Southway South West, um, have you heard of that?
R:  Uh, no, I haven't heard of that.
L:  Yeah, it's actually like one of the bigger movie festivals in America or something I've heard.  They're like, you know, like, all these like, the white stripes and the strokes are all -- they all got discovered at the Southway South West.
R:  Wow!  That's really cool.  Sweet.  Well, so, I'm a --
L:  I'm gonna --  Mm?
R:  Sorry, go ahead.
L:  Yeah.  I'll see what this phone thing, like, the [inaudible] said like, you can get up to like, twenty five calls from them, do you -- do you anything about that?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, yeah, I thought it looked like they -- they ha-- you did three calls and then they would select certain people that could do up to twenty five calls or something like that.  Um --
L:  That'd be awesome, that's two hundred and fifty dollars!
R:  Yeah, I know!  [LAUGH]  'Cause I could definitely use it!  I have a friend of mine does linguistic research and she sent this email out saying, "Hey, you should sign on
