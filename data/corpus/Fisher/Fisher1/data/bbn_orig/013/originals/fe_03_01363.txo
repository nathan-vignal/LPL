R:  Hi, my name is Sue.
L:  Hi, I'm Ann.
R:  Hi, Ann.
L:  Hi, how are ya?
R:  Good, how you doing this evening?
L:  Good -- good, thank you.  Thank you.  I just got off the phone about an hour ago doing this one.
R:  So did I, I don't know what's going on.
L:  Oh, interesting.
R:  They said three calls but I thought it was three Wednesday's apart, but maybe I'm wrong.
L:  Oh!  [LAUGH]  Well, you got one more to go then yet, ay?  [LIPSMACK]  Yes, so you probably discussed this with somebody else as well, so you've got some 
R:  Yeah, I, um, myself, feel that censorship is very dangerous because, um, there have been a lot of books that are classics that have been censored and for whatever reason because people in a certain area or, um, parents were alarmed.  Like the Harry Potter books, uh, I don't think there is anything wrong with them and it gets children to read, which is a great thing.
L:  Right.
R:  And you discover a whole new world from reading and --
L:  You --
R:  -- it doesn't mean that a child's gonna become a witch --
L:  No!  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because they read a book about Harry Potter.  It's fantasy, just like --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- The Wizard of Oz and 
L:  Yeah, like --
R:  Bewitched and all kind of things, um -- 
L:  Yeah, let your imagination go.
R:  I'm trying to think -- right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Nancy Drew books.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Um, you know, there's plenty of books that are great and that doesn't mean that a child is going to be influenced if they read about murder, to go out and murder someone.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I think a worse -- the worse thing is the violence on TV and [LIPSMACK] and such.
L:  Y-
R:  I mean, kids can learn a lot from reading about whole different worlds, other cultures.
L:  Oh, I agree, I agree totally, yeah.  Like, a- and how are they going to find out if they don't read?
R:  Right.
L:  You know, like if it -- they're listening to a parent or -- or, um, [LIPSMACK] or whatever, even a teacher, uh, who isn't supposed to be biased but usually there is some bias in -- in whereas a book -- they've got the option to read different books and -- and get a true picture.  So, no, I totally agree that, uh, it should not be censored, but, it happens!
R:  Oh, I know.  And it's interesting, the last person I spoke to was a gentleman and he, um, was for censorship and he said that -- he actually brought up the thing with anarchists.  He m- mentioned like, um, I don't know, Jerry Ruben, a- Eldridge Cleaver.  He said he was a child of the sixties and he actually went out and bought these books.  And he said, "My parents didn't like it but they allowed[?] me to it!"  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So I'm like, "Why would you be against it?" but then the phone went dead and so I --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- didn't get to h- hear his answer.  I'm like, they let him discover for himself that, you know, of what these people's thoughts and opinions were and he changed and I guess he learned what they thought and that didn't mean that he became an anarchist trying to overthrow the government or whatever --
L:  Mm.
R:  But he said that, um, he, you know, "In my hippy days" he said.  It was -- it was interesting.  But I didn't get to ask him why he felt that it was okay that his parents --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- didn't, uh, stop it.
L:  [SIGH]  Yet he --
R:  And now he's totally against it.
L:  Interesting, yeah.  It must -- it must have, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, been interesting to find out what his answer might have been.  But, yeah, it -- it seems to be, um, like in the sixties or whatever, the seventies whatever, they -- there was less -- less worry about this kinda stuff and it seems to be, um, more so now, which I'm not sure why that is, that, it, uh, they say there was as much crime and goings on then as there is now but I guess it wasn't so sophisticated, I'm not sure.
R:  I -- I don't -- I just don't understand why people would ban books.  I mean, I could see if something is totally pornographic that it would be harmful to a child, that of course I could see, banning that.
L:  [SIGH]  Yes.  Yes.
R:  But I wouldn't wanna see, um, a young child exposed to pornography.  But then on the other hand all they have to do is turn on their television sets, MTV, and they get a lot of, uh --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK]  No, it's true.  It's true.  Like, the last call that I was on too, she asked me how, uh, w- what I thought about, you know, the books on how to build bombs and -- and all this stuff, right?  So, I mean, it -- i- it was a tough question because, you know, like, they should be banned from certain people but how do you -- who makes that call?
R:  Hm.
L:  You know.  And -- and -- and, I mean, if somebody's -- if -- if there is a will there's a way, people will get the information whether the book's banned or not.
R:  Uh, yeah, I -- yeah, I totally agree.  I mean --
L:  If they're so inclined, right?
R:  Right.  I mean, I don't think -- I'm sure it's available out there but I wouldn't myself even go to the trouble to --
L:  No, because --
R:  -- locate something like that.
L:  No, no.  But [LIPSMACK] no, and -- and I know -- I -- I'm -- I know you're from the southern states, I can tell by your accent!  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, actually, I'm from Philadelphia!
L:  Oh, are you!
R:  Born and raised.
L:  Oh no, I can hear an accent!
R:  You're -- you're the -- not the first person that's said that.
L:  Oh well.  Yeah, 'cause --
R:  I've gotten that, um, at my place of work.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  [LAUGH]
R:  That's interesting.  Are you from Philly too?
L:  No, I'm from Canada, from Vancouver.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Near B.C.  So  yeah, and I just was gonna say like, uh, one of our school districts here has, uh, there's been a big going on and on battle with, uh, banning, um, [LIPSMACK] books on +homosexuality, you know, like -- like the lesbian -- the books -- I guess some parents have, uh, obviously there is parents out there, there's children out there that are, but, um, they've, th- for whatever reasons the school board has thought that -- that the children shouldn't be allowed to read these books, right?  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Is it grade school or high school or ?
L:  Grade school.
R:  Mm.
L:  Elementary, yeah.  The lower grades.
R:  And, uh, does it talk about actual, uh, I mean, se- sexual things?
L:  No, no, it's just like -- like, it's like a -- like a -- a grade three four little reader, you know, like it's -- and it's I've Got Two Moms, or I've Got Two Dads and 
R:  Oh, and 
L:  This kind of thing.  And -- and it's, um, it's a -- it's quite a bit of controversy here because -- because some people -- like, when either you really believe o- or you really believe whichever way, right?  Like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it's -- and it's getting -- the school board is, um, and then it becomes political, right?  Like -- 
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- like the way to get voted in again and all this stuff, so 
R:  Yeah, whenever politics gets into it, it's just --
L:  Yeah, like it's --
R:  -- crooked.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Around here anyway.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I'm sure it's all over.  But -- but, uh, it -- it's -- it's hard to -- you sit and listen, right?  And just 'cause it doesn't -- doesn't affect you personally doesn't -- I mean, at the moment it doesn't affect you personally.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Right?  Like -- like, uh, but -- but it -- it's -- it's interesting how, um, somebody gets their mind set on something and it just -- they go with it, and -- and, uh, sometimes they win.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because these books have been banned, which, I think, how are the kids gonna find out if it -- if -- if -- if, uh, there's biased parents that want it banned, then -- then they're gonna give th- their children a biased opinion, and -- and the kids will never know the truth.
R:  They're -- they're bringing their children up in such a narrow world.
L:  I belie- yeah, yes, it's a --
R:  And everything's not one way.
L:  No.
R:  There is two sides to every situation --
L:  To everything.
R:  -- and --
L:  Yes, yeah.
R:  It just, uh, reading, I think, expands your mind, and it just teaches you so much.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh --
R:  I don't know if you've, um, ever participated in any book clubs but it's really interesting how, you know, uh, h- I don't know, five, ten people in a book group can read one book and everyone comes together and -- and has a different opinion on it.
L:  Yes.  I -- I haven't belonged but I've, uh, I've seen -- well, there's -- there's the odd movie or whatever where there's been a book club and I've seen that happen, and I didn't -- I didn't know it happened in real life.
R:  It really -- it really does, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  I mean, everyone gets something out of it and it's just -- it's interesting how everyone gets something different --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and how they can just say that  you know, ban it completely --
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- unless it's pornographic material, uh, for a young child.  I just feel that, how can they -- there's been so many classics that they've tried to ban and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or political books that they've tried to ban and i- it's just -- it's insane.
L:  And they just turn out to -- yeah, yeah, it's -- yeah, it doesn't happen.  I n- I remember I went to a private school in grade twelve and -- and, um, th- the -- one of the girls that my classmate said was a resident [inaudible] and she was reading Catcher In The Rye .  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, I think that might have been one that --
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, like --
R:  -- would've been banned years ago.
L:  Yeah, like, they took it away from her!  And I remember my grandmother reading Peyton Place, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And, uh, and she had to cover it to read it [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because she didn't want anybody to know she was reading it!  You know, but I mean, this -- I -- this is a bit off topic but it was, [LIPSMACK] it's how ideas [LIPSMACK] happen.
R:  It's funny you say that i- because when I was a child I loved to read as well and my mom was reading Rosemary's Baby --
L:  Oh!  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I -- sh- I'd snuck it because I was- it was supposed to be, you know --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- scary and she didn't want me to read it, and so that whole thing about putting a ban on it, I s- s- snuck it and read it.
L:  Yeah!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you think you're missing something so you go -- [LAUGH]!
R:  Sure, yeah!
L:  You go outta your way to try to find out what it is!
R:  And I think the kids would do that too.  They prob-
L:  I -- I believe so, you know, like, w- like, "What are they trying to hide?"
R:  Right.  It's just -- to me it doesn't make sense, especially with the Harry Potter books because it's -- so many kids love them.
L:  Oh, I mean
