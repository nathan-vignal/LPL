L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name is Kevin, how are you?
R:  My name’s Jenny
L:  Jenny, where are you from, Jenny?
R:  Pavilion, New York.  Where are you from?
L:  I am, uh, I’m from Portland, Oregon, but I’m going to school in Provo, Utah.
R:  Utah, so this is all the way out in Utah?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, did you catch that topic?
L:  Yes, I think we’re supposed to talk a-
R:  It was about school, I couldn’t quite hear it.
L:  I think we’re supposed to talk about, should public schools have the right to censor certain books.
R:  Ah, yeah, okay.  I couldn’t hear all the rest of it.  My --
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  -- family had the TV on too loud and I was heading for another room but I didn’t make it.
L:  I understand.
R:  No, I don’t.
L:  Oh, you don’t, I’m sorry.
R:  I don’t --
L:  Th- the question was, should public schools be able to censor books?
R:  Books.  I don’t think so.
L:  Okay.  I don’t either.  Well --
R:  I don’t think it’s right at all.
L:  -- I don’t think so but at the same time I don’t think certain like, adult material of a book should be available to my child at school, either.
R:  Well, there is certain things, like, I would say like, you know, obviously pornographic books and crap, they shouldn’t be reading that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, then again, who decides what’s pornographic and what’s not?
L:  Exactly.  And then there’s always --
R:  That’s the problem.
L:  -- the difficult decision you have, social morality, you know, because what’s pornographic to Joe down the street isn’t necessarily pornographic to someone else.
R:  Yeah.  And there’s places that they had books like Tom Sawyer being banned.
L:  That’s ridiculous.
R:  Because they had the N. word in them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, God, that was written a hundred and fifty years ago, what do you want?
L:  [LAUGH].  Well, I -- I completely agree with that, so I guess the real question lies in how you decide which books to be, you know, are not appropriate.
R:  That would be the difficult decision I suppose.
L:  Yeah.  How would you --
R:  Because you’re gonna have prudes out there that want every little thing --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they’re only gonna be reading Goldi- Goldilocks throughout their lives.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And you got people out there that don’t care what they read and they’re gonna be reading stuff that they shouldn’t be seeing.
L:  Yep.  Oh, I agree.  Well, [LIPSMACK] so what do they do [LAUGH] I guess?
R:  Well, I guess it depends on where you live.  You know, I think down south they’re more tending to, I guess you could say prudishness --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they’re go- they are more likely to block more things than they are up north.
L:  That’s true.  That’s true.
R:  Because the northern people don’t seem quite as … I don’t know, prudish, [LAUGH] I guess it’s the only good word for it.
L:  Do you think, uh, a parent -- you know how they have the school board committee which is elected, do you think an elected committee for that would work at all?
R:  Um, yeah, I guess, within reason.  Because I guess if you’re living in a certain section of the country and they really, really despise certain types of books, if they all vote on it and -- that’s the way it oughta be, I suppose.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But there shouldn’t be like, a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don’t think there should be like a national board of standards or something.
L:  No, I’m -- I’m completely against having some central committee.
R:  Because then, again, it’s like you’re deciding for one section of the country that’s gonna have different values than another section of the country.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And there’s just gonna be big arguments over it.
L:  Yep.  I think that’s a great idea, is just having the -- a central school board or committee that’s voted upon, and they can oversee books that are in question.  But in general I think it’s better just to [COUGH] have censorship in the family, right?  I mean, you --
R:  Yeah, that too.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I suppose there would be like, if you had … a really backwards school system, which obviously there’s gonna be a few.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they were voting out all sorts of books right and left, there should be like a state review board that you -- if you were, as a parent, could appeal it to if you wanted to.
L:  True.
R:  Because there is gonna -- that is gonna happen too.
L:  Yeah.  Well, and I’m sure some individuals feel very strongly about certain books and they’d never, ever give in, so there needs to be an outlet to, you know, if they don’t want their child exposed to that they simply need to be responsible that their child doesn’t get exposed to that, you know, and they -- I mean, there’s things all around life, your children need to realize that, you know, you can’t be guarded away from everything, you just need to learn on your own that that’s appropriate and that’s not appropriate.
R:  There’s also, um, the schools could make allowances, you know, “Read this book or this book”.
L:  Uh-huh.  That’s a good point, [MN].
R:  Have a couple of lists.
L:  Yeah, I like the alternative.
R:  Not just like when I was in school it was like, “Read this book whether you like it or not”.
L:  Yeah.  No, I’d say that’s a good book, uh, that’s a good point, is having the alternative.  In fact, when I was at school, they had that, they had a, “You can read this and if your parents deem that it’s not appropriate then you read this one”.
R:  No, we didn’t have that, everybody read the same book, no matter how boring it was!
L:  [LAUGH]  Where’d you grow up?
R:  Um, New York, western New York.
L:  Okay.
R:  But, I -- I like reading, a read a lot of books.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, uh, some of the books they used to make you read in school, like Shakespeare I found intolerably boring.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  And that other guy that wrote The Pearl and stuff like that, oh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that was terrible too.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  But, they make you read that stuff.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did your parents ever have any say in it at all?
R:  No, no.  It was just, these were assigned books and you read ‘em, that was it.
L:  Yeah, it’s the whole, the state knows better, idea.
R:  But they never picked anything bad.  Like I said, it was like, Shakespeare and, uh --
L:  The classics.
R:  -- Hemingway and stuff like that.
L:  Okay.  Well, interesting.  So you think that, uh, public universities would have the same level as, uh, a K. through twelve kind of censorship thing?
R:  No, I think public universities, the kids are old enough, they should read what they wanna read.
L:  Yep, I agree too.
R:  They’re gonna anyways.
L:  Yep!  [LAUGH]  Yeah, good luck making a college kid --
R:  Yeah, good luck making a college kids, “Oh, no you can’t read this book”.  That’ll make ‘em all read it.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I guess that would be a good way to get ‘em to read it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ban it and then, uh, they’ll all be out there on the internet getting bootleg copies of it!
L:  [LAUGH]  Just put censored on everything, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That’s a good point.
R:  They would too.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  I’m actually graduating, I’m a masters student right now at, uh, Brigaman[?] University.
R:  Oh really?  Cool.  What do you take?
L:  Uh, management information systems.  It’s a business degree with an emphasis in information systems.
R:  I thought about going back to school and getting a -- I only got an associates degree, I’m a registered nurse.
L:  Oh yeah, well, my wife’s a nurse.
R:  Well, I’ve thought about going back because, uh, they treat registered nurses differently.  If you’re an associates degree or you’re a bachelors degree, you both have to take the exact same state board exam --
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.
R:  -- but you’re not treated the same.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You see, my wife came out, she -- she got her associates, worked for six months and then went on to get her BSN.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then she was able to go and she did management in the home health agency, and so she never really had the whole hospital with a BSN.
R:  I’ve never worked in a hospital either, I do home health care too.
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  But, now lately I have been considering going to a hospital.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, well, that’s interesting.
R:  Just because, uh, kim- home healthcare can be a bit of a butt pain.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, you get, uh, too involved with the patients’ families and, uh, then they, uh, you know, they want things --they want you to do things their way and it’s like, "Well, I’m sorry but I have to follow the doctor’s orders".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they don’t wanna hear it.
L:  Oh.  Well, yeah, I mean, right now is a great time to go back to school, I mean, there’s a lot of incentives.  In Texas, even some hospitals, I’ve heard, that’ll pay for you to go back -- to come back and work for them.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.  Well, when we --
R:  Yeah, we got some tuition reimbursement stuff up here if you wanna go to the big city but that’s like, an hour’s drive and I -- I don’t know about it.
L:  And where are you from again?
R:  Um, halfway between Rochester and Buffalo.
L:  Oh, okay.  We -- my wife and I were out there just a year and a half ago.  We were out towards, uh, well, we went through, uh, Rochester and we went down through Palmilla[?] and kinda over towards Ohio after that.
R:  Mhm, yeah.  Yeah, my brother in law goes that way every week.  He’s a truck driver.  He goes to Kansas City.
L:  It’s a beautiful, beautiful area you live in.
R:  Yes, it’s very nice.
L:  Especially in --
R:  I was out in Utah once.
L:  Really?  Where, which part?
R:  I used to take my grandma to Las Vegas.
L:  Oh really?
R:  And every year we’d go and every year we’d pick a different state to drive through --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from Las Vegas.
L:  Well that’s a good idea.
R:  Just to look around, you know.  We went up --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we made it up to -- into Utah and looked around some state park that was there and then drove back.
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, yeah, southern Utah’s got some beautiful state parks, really are.
R:  This one was pretty cool.  It had this hanging valley on the side of some mountain, it was really neat.
L:  Huh.  Well that’s kinda cool.
R:  On the bottom corner, I think, you know, near Las Vegas, it couldn’t be hard to find.
L:  Yeah.  It might be Zions[?] or, uh, Arches, or one of those two.  Well neat, well, I don’t know if there’s anything else we gotta talk about?
R:  Well, you have to talk until they tell you to stop.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And it’s been almost eight minutes, so it shouldn’t be too much longer.  I’ve --
L:  Well, do you have any chil- and what -- what’s your name again?
R:  Jennifer.
L:  Jennifer.  Do you have any children?
R:  Nope, nope, I have twelve nieces and nephews, I think[?].
L:  Oh hey, well that’s great.
R:  You wanna kid to spoil, you borrow one of them, spoil ‘em rotten and give ‘em back!
L:  [LAUGH]  Actually, that’s the way to go, because my son, if I spoil him, he just cries and cries and I have nothing else to -- I mean, you wanna give him back to.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So …
R:  Well I -- my sister does home schooling, so she doesn’t have the problem with, uh, schools banning books or anything like that.
L:  Yeah.  What do you think about home schooling?  That’s an a -- an issue I’m --
R:  It’s a good idea, really.
L:  It’s a good idea?
R:  I think so because, um, my niece -- according to my niece, she’s fifteen, and she says she was talking to her friends up in school the other day, and her -- according to her friends, she is not the only one that is not on drugs or alcohol.
L:  Wow.
R:  In the entire class.
L:  Wow.
R:  And this is a semi rural school.  Avon, New York.
L:  That’s amazing.
R:  It’s not the big city.
L:  Ugh.
R:  And they seem to think that everybody in that class is either taking drugs or drinking alcohol.
L:  That’s horrible.
R:  And Becca is home schooled, so she has no access to any of that stuff.
L:  Yeah.  My only concern with home school is, I had a -- a friend who’s fairly intelligent, he and I went through school and then he left in eighth grade, went to home schooling.  [NOISE]  He didn’t have the self-discipline to kinda do the homework and I don’t think his mother, who was home schooling him, really pushed it as much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so he got behind.  And then he was also -- socially he’s kinda outta whack.  When he came back, his senior year, to kinda try to do catch up, he -- he didn’t know how to handle certain situations with people because he’d been sheltered at home for so long.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I guess there’s -- you have the flip side for both of it.  I’d love to guard my children from all the junk that’s out there, but at the same time they need --
R:  Well, there’s also home school groups.  Like, she takes the kids to home school group every Thursday --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- where they have like, a gym class, an art class and a music class.
L:  Oh, that’s good.
R:  So they do get to interact with other kids.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But they don’t have the, uh, you know, problems with being alone up at the school all day and …
L:  Exactly.
R:  Stuff like that.
L:  Well, I’m sure she’d be a
