R:  Hello?
L:  Hey, how are you doing?
R:  All right.
L:  Um, my name is Aladdin.
R:  My name is Tammy.
L:  Hi, how are you doing?
R:  All right.
L:  So, the topic is public school and private schools.
R:  I guess -- is this censorship, um --
L:  What's that?
R:  Um, I -- it says censorship --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but I -- I'm trying to figure out what the lady just said a while ago, something about in schools, something being talked about in schools?
L:  Yeah.  In schools and, um, about books -- certain books that, ah, students read.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And whether, I think, it's good for them or not.
R:  You mean, as far as exclusive books?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  Okay.  So, what do you think about it?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I mean, it's okay.  I think, to me it's okay for the -- the older teenagers, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like they're in high school --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- ah, but not for the younger children because I have two daughters, nine and five and I wouldn't want them to go in the library in the -- in the --
L:  Uh-huh.
R: -- you know, in their school and pick up something and then, you know, uh-uh, they -- I -- I just don't -- I don't agree with that.
L:  That's not appropriate for them, yeah.
R:  No, it's not.
L:  Yeah.  But, well, yeah, I think so, too.  But, you know, reading and, um, you know, um, improving the skill of reading and all of that is good, but it has to be like, ah, a teacher, ah, looking up all the topics of the books the students read.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just, you know, I mean, like I say, [inaudible] it might not be appropriate for the older teenagers, you know, because everything's so explicit now, you know, lyrics to songs and all the, you know, rap groups and stuff, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that is explicit words, you know, they're, you know, listening to that and, you know, I don't -- uh -- know to a certain point, I don't think that it's good for them at all --
L:  That's right --
R:  -- you know --
L:  -- it's found everywhere.
R:  -- and in another sense, so, you know, it's really not good for none of them.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Um.  But, you know --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you -- if they're going to do it, you know, if you tell them not to, that's how soon they're going to sneak behind your back and -- and -- and, you know, either read it or listen to it --
L:  Definitely --
R:  -- so --
L:  -- so you got to like encourage them into reading some [inaudible] books and you've got to be there for that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That's right.  That's right.
R:  Yeah.  But then again, you can't watch them for twenty four hours [LAUGH].
L:  Well, you ca- -- exactly, exactly --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- but you got to know --
R:  -- because you can't --
L:  -- like, you got to do that with the teachers so you would know what your kids are doing at school and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- ah, what kind of books they read and what's hottest to have and all of that.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I think private schools, um, are much better than public schools because, um, they like, um, it's -- their focusing is more concentrating and they take care of the kids --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- much better, I guess.
R:  Yeah.  That -- I think that with the pub- -- ah, for the private schools, I think they have smaller amount of, ah, children in the classroom --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, they can give them more individual attention --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and keep a closer eye on them, but, you know, public school, there's no way.
L:  That's right.
R:  You know, because there's -- there's too many, you know, the public schools now are overcrowded, so --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- um, you know, they can't keep a eye on, ah, who's doing what and where, you know --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- um [COUGH].
L:  That's right.  There's no much attention for that --
R:  No.
L:  -- so, you wouldn't know the type of books they read and --
R:  No, you wouldn't --
L:  -- and who was taking care of that.
R:  -- unless you went up there [LAUGH].
L:  You wouldn't even trust the teacher, you'd need to, like, be there every time.
R:  True.
L:  That's right.  
R:  Yeah, because --
L:  So, where are you from?
R:  Ah, Atlanta.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yes, it's pretty hot down here today --
L:  Oh, yeah, it's --
R:  Yeah, it's eighty one degrees, so --
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, my God, it's [inaudible].
R:  Well, it's -- it's good compared to the, you know, rain we've been having, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but, um --
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  I had called earlier and they couldn't find nobody, d- -- you know, because you can call in and do it now.
L:  That's right, yeah.
R:  You know, and I didn't know about that.  So, ah, I just called in where I could go ahead and get my three calls over with because this is, you know, if you wait for the computer to do it, you might be waiting forever.
L:  That's right.  But I think we still have to be, like, talking at the topic for --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- like straight ten minutes, and, you know --
R:  Well --
L:  -- still, well --
R:  -- I mean, you know --
L:  [inaudible] I don't know, I don't have anything in mind, but, um, well, I'm not into reading so much, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I don't really enjoy reading and --
R:  I read occasionally.  Ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, you know, I have to -- I watch what my daughters and them read --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- um, you know, and I watch -- I kind of keep an eye out on, ah, the cable channels that they watch --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because my daughter, um, both my daughters are into the videos and, um, you know, one of them likes rap and one don't and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, it's like, okay, it's explicit.  You know, some of it's explicit and I'm like, uh-uh --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- ah, just like the books and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, you want --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you know, they want to get hold of the books and I'm like, no, but, um, what they need to do is I would think is just go age appropriate and maybe, ah, breakdown, you know, the categories of books for the proper ages --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know and -- and if there is any explicit books in the -- in the school inside the library --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they need to, you know, get rid of them.
L:  That's right.  That's right.
R:  Um, I can't think of really nothing else that they could do, I mean, you can't guard a child twenty four hours --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you know, ah --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- I know I can't.  And if they're not at school and they're not with you and they're somewhere else, it's like, okay, how do you know what they're doing?
L:  [NOISE] Exactly [NOISE].
R:  You know, but you -- that's where you have to have trust in your children --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and know that they'll make, um, a pretty proper decision --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I mean, a -- a -- a right decision on what not to do and what to do, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um --
L:  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  I think, yeah.
R:  I don't know, because when I was growing up in -- in my school, um, you know, I graduated in eighty three, so I -- when I was in school in, you know, from s- -- sixty fi- -- I mean, well, si- -- about sixty seven, sixty eight --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, when I went in my library in the school, you know, we didn't what explicit was --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, we didn't have no books like that --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and -- and we didn't have to worry about, um, you know, not watching something on TV that was bad for us, or -- or listening to this type of music or anything or reading any kind of books out of the library because all of it, you know, was o- -- -- it was okay --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, so, but you never know these days.
L:  Besides, it wasn't that open, you know, saying that it was like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, everything was under control and now --
R:  Right.
L:  -- everybody wants to know everything and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so you end --
R:  Yeah, because, you know, th- -- with everything's going on with all these children --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they're, um, you know, you didn't -- I didn't know what molest -- [MN], you know, being molested was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, back then and, you know, all these children being abused and molested and stuff and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- so --
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  -- it's -- it's a lot going on --
L:  Exactly and --
R:  -- um, you know, I c- --
L:  -- they read stuff that makes them curious to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do what's in the book --
R:  To try --
L:  -- so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's right.  That's right.  That's --
R:  Yeah.  There -- there's a lot of books --
L:  -- terrible stuff --
R:  -- that, you know, tell you how to do this and tell you how to do that.
L:  That's right.  That's right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And unfortunately, you probably will find these books in like [MN] school libraries, so I think they have to like control this and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, see what the kids are reading and all of that --
R:  I just think, you know --
L:  -- and always report this to their --
R:  -- like if they're in the library --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they're reading a book --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that, um, you know, either the librarian or the teacher said, you know, ever so often, you know, come by on me and kind of acknowledge the kind of book they're reading --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and what it's about --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and stuff, you know, and see if it is explicit --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, you know, kind of keep a mon- -- monitor them.
L:  That's right.
R:  Um --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- that's the only way that I could see that they could do that, so --
L:  That's right.  That's right.  Well, I don't know.  [LAUGH] I guess the [inaudible] I don't know, there's nothing else to talk about in this --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- subject [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I mean, there's only so much, um, you can talk about censorship --
L:  What's that?
R:  I said, there's only so much censorship you can talk about [LAUGH].
L:  That's right, yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you know, maybe they could get together and pass a law, I don't know, that, you know, them kind of books are not allowed in the school system --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah, you know, ban the books from there, I don't know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I doubt they would do that, though, um, because they got a lot of people that put out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- books like that, but they're mainly for the older crowd --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, so I don't --
L:  Well [inaudible]-- 
R:  -- know.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  I don't even read books like that, so --
L:  Oh, me too.  I mean, I don't really enjoy it.
R:  Yeah.  I don't -- I don't read, you know, that much and when I do, it's -- it's not nothing like that, so --
L:  Well, like, novels or ...?
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like stories, yeah.  So, I don't know --
R:  But.
L:  -- kids are getting curious these days.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They want to know everything about this things that --
R:  Yeah and then curiosity killed the cat, you know --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- the curious you go and -- and try to do it.
L:  That's right.  That's right.
R:  You know.  Instead of -- you know, and they're not going to come to mother and father and say, "Well, ah" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- "I read this, you know, um, you know, what is this?", you know, they're not going to do that, they're just going to go because the- -- they're feeling peer pressure --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- from their friends and they're going -- you know, go along with them because they're trying it --
L:  Yeah.  That's right.
R:  -- you know, and that's where they get in trouble.
L:  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  You've got to always watch what they read, what they watch --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and the friends they're hanging out with --
R:  Yeah.  And then some of the other children's parents, you know, really is not paying attention to them and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really don't care what they're reading.
L:  It feels like they don't care.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, I know.  I know.  Well, you know [NOISE], um, so are --
R:  And I don't --
L:  -- your kids in public schools or --
R:  Yeah, they're in public school --
L:  -- private school.  Okay.
R:  -- and I'm -- I'm -- I don't like that because see private school is -- is more expensive
