L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name is Frankie, how are you?
R:  Hi, and my name is Carolyn.
L:  Good.  What part of the country do you live in?
R:  I live in, um, Okerry[?], North Carolina, right outside of Rowley.
L:  Oh, okay, great.  I'm in -- I'm in k- I am in Maine.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, just to give us an idea of -- of location.
R:  Yeah, okay.
L:  Um, yes, I think schools should be able to tell them what books to read, if it's, uh, part of the academic course.
R:  I agree with you.  Yes, okay.
L:  Yes.  Uh, and I know sometimes some of the sch- some of the parents have been, at least from what I've read in some places, because my kids are all grown and gone now, uh, some of the parents have been upset but I th- over some of the books, but I think those are the parents that also don't, uh, realize the, uh, educational benefit of them being well rounded readers under a supervision.
R:  Right.  I -- I -- I definitely agree.  My son is, um, grown --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, he's twenty seven and, you know, um, [LIPSMACK] I never really had that -- I never had that problem or never, you know, have spoken to anyone who had a problem with, um, you know, the selection of the books.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Um 
L:  But I think that it's better for them to read stuff and get questions answered by someone who can answer it rather than just having read stuff and not understanding or taking it out of context too.  I think that's -- that's part of the educational system.  I really believe that the stuff that they've asked them to read -- I mean, some of the stuff is classic stuff.  I mean, we didn't take it as being, uh, perverted or anything like that when we were growing up and reading it.
R:  Or infringing on your -- or infringing on your -- on your --
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  -- your choices.  Infringing on your choices or, you know, um --
L:  You know, I have a catholic education and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I -- I think it's -- it's some of the greatest that anybody could ever have because they do, uh, go into depth with some of the things and explain, "Well, this is, you know, this was the custom" or "This was this" and, I don't know, j- I think today they're -- they're just looking for so many things, they read stuff into stuff that isn't even there.
R:  Yeah, I agree with you there.  Plus, um, [LIPSMACK] like you said, being a rel- a well rounded person --
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and understanding, [SIGH] um, in other words being exposed to things that you wouldn't normally think of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, from someone who has experience and background, [SIGH] someone who is a little -- little older in terms of, you know, [SIGH] trying to give you the experiences and, um, sharing their knowledge and -- and, um, you know, and I -- I look at it l- you know, like that, because I've actually had young people tell me, [SIGH] "Oh, you know, I didn't know anything about that particular subject or that particular topic --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- I'm glad you, you know, explained some things to me because I've never really thought of that".
L:  Right.
R:  So, um, I agree with you, um, one hundred percent.
L:  Yeah, I think they're letter education just get out of hand, I mean, uh --
R:  I think so too, I think so too.
L:  The woman across the street from me has a fourteen year old and I look at the stuff that they're doing and learning in school and I'm thinking, you know, these kids are not going to be ready for anything.
R:  That's right, that's right.
L:  You know, they don't know how to balance a check book, they don't know how to make a budget or a shopping list, I mean, and those things are all important, they're just as important as -- as anything else.  The big emphasis today seems to be on sports.
R:  Yes, that's right.  And -- and, well, not only, um, um, the work ethic is not there any more.  [SIGH]  Um --
L:  Oh, you know, I hear this all the time because I -- I'm an independent consultant --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'll tell ya, I go into stores and the people, they're griping and groaning about the --
R:  Well, that's right.
L:  -- help and this and that.  And those are things that only come with a well rounded education --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and knowing that, yes, you have to do this in order to get this.
R:  That's right.  Exposure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A lot of them, you know, and [SIGH] I agree with you there, they just don't have the exposure, [SIGH] I think that they need to understand what it takes to really, um, [LIPSMACK] get out here and become --
L:  And make a living and survive.
R:  Make a living.  And to be -- and to be -- to become a productive citizen.
L:  Yeah, well, a lot of it I blame on some of the parents, they just hand their kids everything, they don't have to work.  I don't know about you, but when I was growing up as a kid, I had a paper route.  All right, guaranteed now that may not be a safe thing --
R:  Right.
L:  To have a paper route.
R:  Right.
L:  But in your immediate neighborhood, if you can't know your neighbors -- I mean, I sold candy, I made pot holders, I used to shovel snow.  Can't get the kid across the street, he won't even shovel his mother's own walk.
R:  That's right.  That's right.
L:  He says one day, "How much you gonna pay me?" I almost picked up my hand and smacked him side the head!
R:  [LAUGH]  That's right.  I -- I --
L:  I mean, the [SIGH] [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, so 
L:  You know, to me they don't have the family values, um, or the sense of helping.  And both parents work.
R:  That's right.  That's right.
L:  You know?  And [SIGH] I don't know, maybe because I raised my kids from the time they could toddle they had chores, even if they weren't perfect.  I mean, put the toys in the toy basket and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- pull up the sheets on your bed, you know, I never looked for perfection --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because they're children.
R:  Right.  But at least --
L:  But these kids today don't have to do that.
R:  Right.  Re-
L:  And it's a shame.
R:  Re- responsibility.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  And they learn that by reading.
R:  That's right.  That's right.  And reading and -- and -- and really -- and reading a little bit of everything.
L:  Yes.
R:  And -- and -- and putting themselves in --
L:  I mean, even the classic- even Heidi, for instance.
R:  That's right, that's right.
L:  I mean, [SIGH] there were chores.
R:  Mhm.
L:  There were responsibilities.
R:  Mhm.  And -- and -- and people don't realize that [SIGH] with that kind of exposure -- in other words you're opening up a person's mind to say --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- "Hey, life isn't just this way.  Life is, you know, um, I'm looking at it through other -- through another person's eyes --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- and really trying to ex- experience some of the things that go on.  Not just only in our culture but in all cultures".
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  You know?
L:  I -- I heartily agree and I think that was one of the best things, uh, with a catholic education, the books that you read exposed you to that --
R:  That's right.
L:  And then you talked about it.
R:  That's right.
L:  And that -- that's part of -- of -- that's the biggest part of any education system, is to teach and to -- to get that point across and they don't do this.  I mean 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I agree.
L:  It's horrendous.
R:  Yeah, my girlfriend is a school teacher [SIGH] and every -- she -- she retired but she went back --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And every year she's gonna retire again.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  And, you know, and it's -- it's happened a lot.  She -- she teaches history.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  And, um, which she loves.  And, um, she also teaches, um, [LIPSMACK] um, well, I guess it's called government -- I don't -- we used to call it civics.
L:  Oh p- yeah, oh, P.O.D.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, problems of democracy, right.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and -- and -- and to try to get them to understand, uh, [LIPSMACK] um, you know, uh, government and history and to have an appreciation of --
L:  Of what we have in this country, right.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And then they -- then there wouldn't be all these people saying, "Well, we shouldn't be in this war that we're in".
R:  Right, right.
L:  Because most of 'em, they have no clue what they're fighting for, they don't understand how oppressed these people have been, because they don't -- they haven't read.
R:  Right, right.  That's right.
L:  You know.
R:  That [LIPSMACK] --
L:  They only hear the bad stuff, they don't hear about the good people of -- that are -- that are in a situation.  I mean, today they were talking about some of the looting.  Yeah, they're looting food for the most part.
R:  Right.
L:  Out of this one warehouse.  I mean  but there again, history repeats itself and if --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they read and they -- and they would read the classics 
R:  Right.  That's right.
L:  There is so much --
R:  And understand.  That's right.  I -- I agree with you, because my girlfriend always would say, you know, "If you study history --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- not just our students but our elected officials and everyone else".
L:  Right.
R:  "If you study history, find out what, you know, some of the problems that other societies have had.  You can -- you can try to improve your society".
L:  Right.  And you can see how the government works.  I mean --
R:  Mm.
L:  You've read any of -- any of Shakespeare's stuff and you can almost take the same situations and apply it to the -- to -- with our everyday characters.
R:  That's right.
L:  In fact, they have made, um, a couple of the Shakespeare stories and -- and updated them and made a movie.  Um, I'm trying to think, was it Hamlet or Macbeth?  One of the t- Hamlet I think it was.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Um, they just brought it -- the whole thing into New York and into a company.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  I think that's the one that I -- I saw one night.  I -- I just caught part of it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I mean, you can take so much of that and, you know, when we were kids, I mean, that was the last thing I wanted to be reading and really studying it, but I really learned a lot.
R:  Mhm, mhm, that's right.
L:  And how people actually thought then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and how, I don't know, the whole -- the whole thing.  You have to have a basis.  I mean, now --
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  -- when you watch comedy, if you don't have a background in some of their stuff you have no clue what they're talking about.
R:  That's right.  That's right.  [SIGH]  And even when, [SIGH] you know, if you, um, you know, what's happening to me was when I went to Rome --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- a couple of years ago.
L:  Oh, that must be fantastic.
R:  And -- and -- and -- and I was just thinking -- the whole time I was there I was thinking about the fall of the Roman Empire.
L:  Right.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  And, uh, you know, most -- the fall of the Roman Empire!  They didn't even know anything about the Roman empire!  You know.  And these were some of the things that we had to --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- t- t- t-
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Right.  I mean, we --
L:  I mean, I've been out of school way too many years, I mean, I graduated --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- high school in sixty two --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I've been out, what, forty years?
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I mean, you forget some of that stuff.  But, you know, I can vividly remember --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, remem- going through the Caesars and --
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  -- who did this --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- and that.
R:  That's right.  And to understand what went wrong with burning -- to understand civilization because Rome had one of the greatest civilizations.
L:  That's right.
R:  You know.
L:  But they went to excess and s- in everything.
R:  That's right.  And that's what my girlfriend always say that you have to read, you have to study history, you have to find out w-
