R:  Hello, I'm Naida[?].
L:  Hi, I -- my name's Mark.
R:  Hi, Mark.  Um, no, I don't work out personally, um, I guess I should.  I would like to work out one day but I really don't have the time right now, so no, I don't work out.  Do you work out?
L:  Well, I try to.  I get to the gym three or four times a week and I try to walk quite a bit when I don't get to the gym.
R:  Okay.
L:  But, uh, do you do --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- other kinds of things besides, you know, uh, formal exercise, like, um, you know, walking a lot or doing a lot of, [COUGH] uh, work around the house or doing an active kind of job?
R:  No.  Well, what -- yeah, I do have an active job and, um, actually it's gonna get more intense because I'm getting ready to get a new job in sales, so I'll be walking like, a whole lot.  But for right now, I do walk a lot up and down steps, I'm still in s- well, I go to school and I work a full time job.  And I was working, like, part time at a department store, so I was walking around putting the clothes back on the racks.  So I get a lot of walking in.  But as far --
L:  Well, you know, that probably amounts to at least as much exercise as you do in an hour at the gym.
R:  Really?  I'm --
L:  I think so, that's what they tell me.
R:  Oh, really?  But, see, that's the only exercise that I get in.  I mean, just basically walking.  Just like school and work and stuff like that.  But other than that, no.  So, um, how -- well, I did have a gym membership and I went one time.  And I had this membership for two years and I went once!
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]  So [COUGH] no --
L:  Well, I do try to go because it, uh, I have more of a sedentary job, I -- y- I could spend a whole lotta time just, uh, sitting down.  And so --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so if I don't find reasons to get out and do things, uh, I don't get much exercise.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah.  But even on a day like today, it's, you know, it was a nice day, I got out, I took a walk, just like, on my lunch break.  You know, and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah, that's great.  I think that's [COUGH] --
R:  Yeah, because it was nice.
L:  -- I think that's great.  I mean, I -- I had to do some shopping today so instead of taking the car I walked --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- because it was such a beautiful day.
R:  Yeah, it was really nice.  So, um, but other than that, no.  But I would like to actually get into another gym.  Um, but basically more than just like to exercise on the machines, I would rather do stuff like, um, the aerobics class or something like that, or even taking up like, a karate course or something like that.  I don't think -- I don't know, I just don't wanna get on a treadmill, I don't wanna do that.  I mean, I just wanna --
L:  Those things are kinda boring.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I do have to say that the classes are more fun except, uh, um, uh, the gym that I belong to is almost all college students and --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- the ones who participate in the classes are mostly young women.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, as I'm older and a guy, I feel kinda outta place in those classes, so .
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  [COUGH]  But, I mean, but then when I do go to the gym I went to Lucile Roberts, like, the one time and it was like, for all women.  I mean, it was okay but, mm, I g- I don't think I really liked it too much.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, and then I will like to do water aerobics [MN] I wanna learn how to swim because I can't swim, to get some form of exercise and, but, um, [LIPSMACK] I haven't even found a gym that I could really do that, that's like really close to where I'm working.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So 
L:  Well, um --
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  Uh, have you done karate for a long time?
R:  No, I haven't done karate, that's something I would want to --
L:  Oh, I see, that's something you were thinking about doing?
R:  Yeah, as a form of exercise.  I think that --
L:  Well, I have a seven year old son who started --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- doing it about a year ago and he really --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- likes it, it's meant a great deal to him.  Um, mo- less as a form of exercise and more because it gives him a certain kind of discipline and social group of other kids that are interested in it and stuff like that.  He really responded well to it.
R:  Oh really, that's good!  Well, maybe I'll look into it.  [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah.  I -- I haven't tried it myself but it's certainly been good for him.
R:  Yeah, I mean, because I've -- I've felt like, okay, you're -- you're still doing -- getting your heart rate up.  You know, you're moving your body around, you can still get --
L:  Well, I -- I'll tell you, f- um, for him, for the kids his age, it's really like dance for boys.
R:  Really?
L:  That's what it is, I think!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It -- it -- or like ballet for, you know, or modern dance or something, for guys, because, uh, they don't really do any fighting, they just do these pattern movements.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Um --
R:  [COUGH]  -- sometimes in unison or sometimes individually, so in a way it's a lot like an aerobics class.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Kinda like aerobic dancing or something.
R:  Oh okay, well, that's not bad at all.  That's really not bad.  I -- I mean, I don't like it.  I mean, just something when you can interact.  See, I like the interaction part, like, if you go to the gym, I mean, you're just like, basically by yourself, you're working out, you know.  And I like to meet people and get out and talk to people and different things like that.  So I wanna do something like, that's more interactive, I mean, like, karate, okay it's interactive, you can meet other people and you're not just like at [inaudible] table, then we do karate or then we move to this, then we move to that.  Somewhere how --
L:  Did you ever do any team sports?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Mm, out of high school, no.
L:  W- when I was younger, when I was, uh, in the army, and after I got out of the army --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I did, uh, uh, you know, basketball in leagues.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I always enjoyed that but then my knees started to give out and I had to give it up.
R:  Yeah.  See, I mean, and I really don't have like, um, a weight problem, so the only thing that I would rally wanna do, if I wanted to lose anything, would be like just to tone up and like, tone up my stomach.  But that would be the only thing.  I mean, I -- I don't have a weight problem.  But yet, and still, I mean, even just being healthy, you know, you need to work out and it's good for your heart and all that.
L:  Yeah, well I think especially as to get older to keep your heart in good shape and stuff like that, it's good to get into the habit.
R:  Yeah.  It's good to get into the habit.  I mean, like, right now I'm just tw- I'm twenty eight, I'll be twenty nine in September, so, um, I don't know, I guess maybe I'm not as concerned as I should be because I'm not like, older?  I don't know.
L:  Yeah, well, you -- you're lucky, you're in -- in good shape and you have a pretty active life it sounds like.
R:  Yeah, I do.  So, I mean, as far as getting a lot of walking in, I do.  I mean, just working at the department store, I mean, part time.  Four hours you're on your feet, I mean, that's part time, like after my regular job.  Four hours you're on your feet, you're not sitting down, you're constantly moving around.  So, I mean, you think about that.  I mean, in itself that is a lot of exercise.
L:  Th- that's quite a lot of exercise actually.
R:  Yeah, I mean, that really is.  And you're constantly walking and moving and you're helping people and you're constantly moving and going and you're picking stuff up off the floor and putting it back up and, you know, I mean, so it's just like, it's somewhat of -- yeah, somewhat of [MN] exercise.  But, um, I mean, that's just about it, and I'm like, by the time I get home from there I am tired.  [COUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, I found -- somebody tol- you know, somebody pointed out to me that there are a lot of activities of everyday life that really are pretty good exercise and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the good thing about taking that attitude is that there's all kinds of things you need to do, like, you know, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- mop the floor and take out the trash and stuff like that!
R:  Right.
L:  And if you, uh, view it as something positive not just something that has to be done but something that actually does you some good as well as doing your environment some good, um, it, uh, helps make your life better.  That's what I've found.
R:  So, do you think that people can be healthy without exercise?
L:  Well, [MN] it's a question of what kind of exercise, after all, right?  So --
R:  Yeah, I'll go with that.
L:  -- if you're -- if you're living an active life, if you're doing all kinds of physical work, uh, walking a lot, you know, doing cleaning around the house, doing, you know, building things, fixing things, whatever, if you have a job that involves a lotta movement and lifting and going from place to place, you're probably pretty healthy, that's what I think.
R:  Yeah.  Um, my doctor says that I'm pretty healthy but, um, I mean, I was just wondering, I'm like, do you think there are people, you know, because I mean there are some people who don't do exercise that I think are healthy, then there are some people who, um, do exercise.  I mean, and there have been people that worked out at the gym and had heart attacks, you know?
L:  Yeah, well, it certainly --
R:  Even if you have a heart attack at the gym.
L:  -- it comes to everybody sooner or later, I guess!  [LAUGH]  But -- but I --
R:  I don't know, I guess --
L:  I think a completely sedentary life is just not too good for you, and I can say that as somebody who has lived a sedentary life some of his life.
R:  Yeah, you're right.  And I guess, you know what, along with the exercise I guess you have to really like, eat healthy and stuff like that, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think that means a lot and it has a lot to do with it.  The thing is, if you're not putting the right things in your body it really doesn't matter what you're doing.  You know?
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  So I think it's important to put the right things in your body as well.  So, I mean, as far as health foods and stuff like that, are you like, health conscious as far as foods are concerned?
L:  Do you, uh, make most of your own food, do you eat out a lot?
R:  No, I eat out a lot.  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, so that's not healthy.
L:  Well, I guess it depends on where you go, but it actually is pretty hard to find healthy food eating out.
R:  Well, you know what, I think they do have like a couple of health food places, I mean, that are [inaudible] in [inaudible] City, Philadelphia.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, are either like in Ballerkinlet[?] I think there's a place up there in, um, [LIPSMACK] like a little vegetarian place, but I mean, I haven't tried it yet but I would like to.  As far as just being healthy, you know, overall.  It's just like --
L:  [MN]  Excuse me?
R:  Just like, as far as being healthy overall like, the entire body, you know?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So [NOISE]  I don't know -- so, um, what other forms of exercise do you do except for working out at the gym?
L:  Well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I wind up walking three or four miles a day --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, because I, uh, you know, live in the city in a situation where I really don't need to use the car very often.
R:  [NOISE]  Okay.  [NOISE]
L:  And so when I go to the grocery store I walk and that's about a mile back and forth.  And, uh
