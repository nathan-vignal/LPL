L:  Hi, my name is Andy.
R:  Hi, uh, my name's Moxy[?], how are you?
L:  I'm doing well, thank you.  I hope you are?
R:  Oh, real good thank you.
L:  Yeah.  I couldn't quite hear what the -- I know it's about censorship, did you have -- and -- and public and private schools but I didn't --
R:  Yes, I --
L:  -- hear the whole thing.
R:  Uh, if you, uh, were for or against or had any ideas about it, from what I understand?
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Okay?  Um --
L:  About certain books in --
R:  Being banned.
L:  -- in schools?
R:  Right.  It -- i-
L:  No, I'm -- I'm not for censorship at all.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, I do agree that -- I mean, it's just my position -- I agree there are books that I'd rather not have, you know, my children --
R:  Personally, uh huh.
L:  -- read.  But I -- I ha- I feel like I need to defend their right to read them, at a certain point in their life.
R:  Right.  Well, I guess for a start, and as long as they're -- in my opinion -- as long as it would be age appropriate too, because for younger kids of course, you know, you wouldn't want certain kids -- children that are too young, to be reading books that are for older children too that, you know, won't be really what they need to read at an early age.
L:  Yes.  I -- I --
R:  That would be --
L:  -- agree with you, that's a very good point, that it be age appropriate.  But, um, I -- I certainly don't like, you know, there are so many people that do things in the name of freedom of speech.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, that I don't agree with the things that they're doing, but I do agree that this country gives them the right to do what they do.  But, as far as in public schools and private schools, I think private schools probably have a little more to say over --
R:  I w-
L:  -- what kind of books come in.
R:  Right.  I -- I would think it -- I think that they do.  That-- that's one advantage, I guess, about, um, private schools, they could be able to be a little bit more selective.  Um, public schools, you know, my daughter goes to public school and, I mean, so far I have had no problem with anything that they have been reading and I think it's all been -- been real good.  I guess some, you know, I -- I think the schools themselves censor what -- what goes in there, um, I mean, the board must approve of certain things, I guess, that they'd be reading.
L:  Well, I thi- I do think they have, um, quite a -- a say in it but I also think they give the teachers, you know  some credit for selecting the right book.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, I know there's been controversy in the past, even with books that have been allowed to be read, by parents that were totally against it.  So, it could be a family by family issue more than just a whole censorship type thing.
R:  Correct.
L:  And, um, uh, my children went to private school just for the first couple of years, to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I just felt like they needed more one on one type teaching.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then from there they have been in public school all this time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I've been -- I've been very satisfied, uh, I've been sort of disappointed that budget cuts in schools is taking out a lotta the arts and, um, things like that, they're proposing that it will.  But I -- I --
R:  Right.
L:  I think they'll always have books in schools and certainly in libraries, um --
R:  Well --
L:  But as far as -- as far as censorship per se, I -- I'm not a -- a big proponent of censoring anybody.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Even though I may not agree with what they say or what they write.
R:  Right.  I'm the same way.  I pretty much think that, you know, things are well the way they are right now as far as the public schools go, um, you know, I have no problem at all.  I think it varies from area to area, it seems state to state --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, how, you know, how much censorship that they receive.  We're in Pennsylvania and, uh, there isn't really an incredible amount, more than, you know, just age appropriate material, from what I understand.  Somebody may oppose of something and, you know, ha- is entitled to voice their opinion about certain things and I believe the school board probably reviews those, uh, people's requests, but, um, as a rule I'm pretty much open.  Like you said, w- with public libraries, they're a -- they're a fantastic, uh, asset that we have in our community and I -- I think it's the, you know, the same with the schools too --
L:  [SIGH] [MN]
R:  -- um, they should not receive any, uh --
L:  I live in -- I live in the south, the bible belt.  But, I -- I really think that, uh, the people in the south -- I'm not originally from the south but I've lived down here now for over thirty years and -- and I think sometimes that people in the south get a really bad rap for being, um, very austere in --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- in how they think of -- of censorship and things.  And I tend to find that most parents are parents everywhere, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  You're gonna have a certain group that just, you know, uh, they just have to --
R:  I know!  I-
L:  -- have something going on!
R:  I -- it does seem to be --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, yeah, you can't please all the people all the time and that's definitely true.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Right.  No matter where.
L:  But -- but for the most part, you know, other parents are just like I am, you know, they -- they feel that, yeah, there's some things that they don't like, but as far as in the schools down here, um  we haven't had any problems about censorship in the public schools.
R:  Mm.  No, nothing here, really, locally.  I -- I -- I recall some time ago on the news, um, something, a parent was complaining about a book or something that -- a magazine that was in the school that was pertaining to witchcraft, and I don't really know what became of that, you know, if they took it out or what may have happened, but I -- I think in my mind that they had taken it out.  It was just some- something that was right in the school, like, that they could go --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to the, uh, library and look at it, but I think it had been removed.  But it wasn't here locally, very locally.  It may have been in Pennsylvania, I don't quite recall.  But, um 
L:  Well 
R:  A -- a complete censorship definitely would not, you know, that would not be good.  Our -- our country is founded in, you know, the rights that we do have and it ma- that's what makes it great.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  It's for all the people.
L:  Well, I feel the same way.  I think, uh, you know, there are some things in our country that can be improved upon but there is no place else I'd rather live on earth --
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  -- than America.
R:  Right.
L:  I think we -- I think, you know, a lot of times that people are -- who are griping about living here, if they would live in some of these third world countries --
R:  I know.
L:  -- I think they would appreciate what they have a whole lot more.
R:  Exactly.  W- we are just so blessed here.  And, I mean, censorship is one of the -- the things that, you know, the openness that we have and the ability to make our own choices is what really makes our country great.
L:  Exactly, yeah.  Uh, I don't know how long we're supposed to talk about this issue, I think it was something like eight or ten minutes --
R:  Ten minutes, I think.
L:  -- am I right?
R:  Right, yes.  So it should be pretty soon.
L:  I haven't ever been on one of these before.
R:  This is the second.
L:  Have you done one of these?
R:  This is the second one I've done.
L:  Uh huh.
R:  It's very interesting, the other one --
L:  It really -- it is.
R:  Uh huh.  It is.  I mean, censorship, I mean, I -- I had heard last night that they were going to be talking about it and I was contemplating whether I wanted to get involved with it but you know, it seems like a really good subject because there -- there's all different kinds of aspects that you could look at, you know, religious wise, uh, you know, the age -- I guess the age appropriate, schools normally do investigate and make sure that the material that their children do receive is age appropriate.  And a lot of people I have heard complain about sex education in schools.  But, you know, as long as it's age appropriate I don't have a problem with my daughter learning anything, you know, in, um, school as she gets older.
L:  Exactly.  Uh, I've always just told mine that, you know, "You're gonna -- you are gonna be --" you know, when it came time for her to be talking and learning about that --
R:  Right.  We're gonna be talking.  [MN]
L:  I said, "But I still w- you know, you and I will be talking and "
R:  Right.  It's our responsibility to, you know, teach these things to our children too.  And, you know, we have influence, uh, on, uh, what they --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- think and --
L:  And I, you know, you want to know what they're being taught so that you can, you know, if it's not the way that your family views certain issues, that you can put, uh, input into that as well as what they're getting from school.
R:  Right.  [MN]
L:  Uh, not just because, uh, they're being taught sex education that means, "Okay, now I can go out and find out w- all about everything!"
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?
R:  That's the problem, you know, lack of communication in par- with parents and children, you know, I think that we a- you know, as parents need to take a lot of responsibility as far as teaching our children things, too.  And, um, you know, I don't have any problem as far as my daughter getting access to information from school because the school that, um, she g- attends is a -- is a really good school and, um, you know, I -- I have yet to see any- anybody complain in the local area about any problems or any literature that they didn't want in there.
L:  Yeah.  This school here is, uh, rated like, the best in like, three different southern states, so --
R:  Is that right?  What --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, state is it?
L:  It's South Carolina.
R:  Oh, how nice!
L:  Yeah.
R:  You're so lucky!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I'm --
L:  So we're -- we're very fortunate to have a really good school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and some very wonderful teachers that, uh, go above and beyond and, um, and Engl- you know, English literature that -- that she's reading and talking to me about, I mean, I have not been against any of it, it's all age appropriate and things that, um, I think will enrich her.  Now, there is times she's like, "Oh, I don't feel like reading this".
R:  Uh huh.
L:  But I say, "Well, you know, there'll come a time that you look back on it and say, "Yeah, I read that in school".
R:  Right, I know.  At some time in your life --
L:  And she said, "But --" -- they don't -- it's the good with the bad.
R:  Right.  And then, you know, at some point in your life, if you can't use it now you, you know, it'll come up, like you said, later on, and you'll, you know, be glad that you did learn, and, uh, read it.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Um, I think that, you know, it's a good thing, as I said, for the kids to get a general idea what's out in the world, you know --
L:  It's --
R:  -- because when they get out of school they're gonna be making their own choices too and, you know, like we were saying, if they -- if we have a rapport with our kids and talk about, uh, things with them while they're still young, you know, when they get out there it won't be so difficult for them too.
L:  That's right.  That's why I really do not agree with censorship, because even -- you gotta
