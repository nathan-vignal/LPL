R:  Hey, this is Ramel[?].
L:  Hey, this is Kronjit[?] Singh.
R:  Hello.
L:  Yes.
R:  Hey, what -- what the topic was?
L:  Uh, if we think sm- -- uh, banning smoking in public places is a good idea.  I think it's a good idea.
R:  [LAUGH] In public places, I don't know.  I don't know if I really think it's a good idea.  I mean -- I mean, actually, yeah, because I can't stand the smoke, but -- no, actually, I'm with you. [LAUGH] Now that I really think about it, because I -- you try to start to say they can't smoke anywhere, but where will they smoke?  I guess they should smoke in their own private areas, you know what I'm saying?  Like, 'cause smoking is bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Secondhand and everything.
L:  It's pretty bad.  I agree with the same thing.
R:  Yeah, that is true, so I wonder why they haven't done that yet.
L:  Do you think, uh -- they also asked if you think those quit line and all those things work.
R:  Quick line?
L:  Like, um, those campaigns they have on TV like true dot com.
R:  Oh, true, that it -- they -- they asked if it -- does -- do they work?
L:  Yeah.  Or if -- if that's a good idea.
R:  I think it's a real good idea.  I think they're a great idea.  I'm glad they're doing them because now it makes people really think, you know what I'm saying?  It really makes people be like, "Okay, wow, is this really happening?"  You know?  And it's like it really is happening.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  I think it gives, uh, good information to people that they don't know, you know, like true gives all those facts that are, like -- that take you, like, off your feet and it's pretty cool that they do that.
R:  Yeah, like the babies.  Like, you really don't know -- like, you really didn't know about the babies, um, saying like, "Okay, secondhand smoke makes your baby smaller" or something like that, how they had smaller ones and bigger ones, and how people they -- they were saying that, um, people are -- what did they say?  Oh, the -- how the government was hiding a lot of things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I mean, that -- that -- that really makes a significant difference, man, in putting that out there.  I mean, it's just little things that people might not know.  Now, the marijuana commercials, I don't know. [LAUGH] I think those may be a little extreme.
L:  I -- I haven't --
R:  What do you think?
L:  I don't remember them.  Oh, yeah, the marijuana commercials.  I -- yeah, but I don't think that was related to true or smoking, so ...
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, th- those were kind of like -- but they were -- they were still effective, I think, in that, like, you know, it really caught me by surprise.
R:  Yeah, it definitely did, did catch my attention.
L:  And it -- it lo- -- it left, like, a shocking image in your mind, so it was pretty cool.
R:  Yeah.  Well, what else are we supposed to talk about?  That's it?
L:  I think so.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's a bad -- that's a topic that you can't really talk too much about, especially if two people agree on it.  But, I mean, I think really, though, that smoking, um, yeah, we -- I mean, smoking's just bad.  I mean, [inaudible] have it bars and all that stuff and -- and how they have it in, um, restaurants and stuff, like, how they -- you know, even on planes, how they sep- separate people and say, "Okay, smoking section, non smoking section".
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, cut it out period because that smoke still travels over to us anyway, you know.
L:  It definitely does.  Do you smoke?  No, right?
R:  No, no, no, no, no.
L:  Obviously not. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.  And it travels over to us and it -- it gets in your hair, it gets in your clothes.  That's not cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it's definitely bad.  So, how long are we supp- -- we supposed to sit here and talk and then hang up or ...?
L:  I -- I have no idea. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Is this your first time doing this one?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, okay.  Mine too. [LAUGH] All the other ones I haven't been able to do, so ... and I -- I didn't really get to hear the topic, man.  I heard it, but I didn't really get to hear it.  So, by my clock here, it looks like I got five more minutes we're supposed to keep talking on here. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, man.
R:  Okay, um, if they were to have some smoking places, where would we have it?
L:  Like, you mean -- I -- I was confused.  Like, do they mean, like, ban smoking in public areas or -- or [inaudible], like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- ban 'em in, like -- in, like, stadiums and stuff, you know?
R:  I think if --
L:  And, like, subway stations and ...
R:  If you let me -- if you let me speak my mind, I would definitely say -- if they asked for my opinion, let me speak it, I would definitely say that, yeah, ban it everywhere.  I mean, for real.  Restaurants, public places, bathrooms, I mean, all that stuff, planes.  Make smoking -- like, you know what I think the only place that'd be good is airports like where they have -- you know, have you ever seen the airports where they have those suctions --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it sucks it up?  That's the only place that they -- stuff like that.  Unless you have, like, a place like that, but even outside, like, outside --
L:  I know.
R:  -- walking, that bothers me.  You walk by and you're sitting at a -- at a corner just across the street, and somebody's smoking, it's like, "Ugh" you know.  But that is free space, but --
L:  Yeah, I don't know how that's gonna settle well with the general public.
R:  I don't know either.
L:  I mean, I'm -- I'm -- I'd rather see smoking banned in public places, but, like, it might be too much of, like, a socialist movement [LAUGH] if we did that.
R:  Oh, how you figure?
L:  Uh, just 'cause, like -- I don't know, like, we shouldn't -- I don't think the government should, like, intrude on everyone's privacy like th- -- to that extent that they can't smoke outside of, like, a building, you know.
R:  I mean, they do it with other things.  They do that with, uh, marijuana.  They do that and they -- they claim it as being legal, but some people say it's not, so people do it in hidden terms.  You know what I'm saying?  Same thing with drinking.  I mean, drink is actually put out there, but people still drinking it in their own home.  So, if it's something bad and they know it's something -- I think the government basically realizes that smoking is bad.
L:  Mm.
R:  And people are starting to realize that it's bad.  So, you realize it's bad but you know that it's such a strong instinct and part of America and you can't really just say, "Okay, everybody get rid of it or we're about to charge, you know, more".  I mean, that's what they gotta do, either make a tax for it, a special tax for it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or make a higher fee for it now or something.  But, I mean, that's -- really you can't -- you can't, um -- I mean, there -- you actually can, I figure, you know, do that because why not?  I mean, should they -- I mean, we -- we're able to have drinks everywhere, we're able to do other things in hidden places as well as being out on the scene, so it's, like, I say go ahead and, um, ban it, you know what I'm saying? [LAUGH] For real.  If it's possible, ban it.  I mean, people are going to --
L:  If it's possible, though, but ...
R:  Yeah, people are always gonna speak and have their opinions and say, "Oh, yeah, we shouldn't do this and we shouldn't do that" but, I mean -- I mean, [inaudible].
L:  I know, but, uh, th- th- there's such a huge public -- like, there's such a huge portion of the US public like that --
R:  That smokes.
L:  -- that smokes, so I don't know how that's gonna settle well.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I agree, too, but I don't know if I wanna go that far as saying, like, they should ban it like they have marijuana.
R:  I think so.  I mean, not ban it but just stop it, though.  I mean, it's like -- it's a drug, you know.  It's a drug that's no use, no positive use. [LAUGH] Tell me the positive -- I mean, besides having people that are addicted to it cope with it.  I mean, it's -- it's no use for it.
L:  That's true.
R:  So, I mean, if -- if it's no use for it, then, I mean, why are we, uh -- we do we have it?
L:  So, you --
R:  It's an addiction.
L:  You're saying make it illegal or make, uh --
R:  I mean, I don't -- I -- I guess that I don't wanna say, "Make it illegal" but I don't know, it's kinda like drinking.  Like, I really -- people like to drink.  I drink, but still, drinking's a drug.  You know, look how many problems it's caused.  A lot of people die and stuff like that.  It's like, make it -- make it, like, harder to use or harder to get or harder to, you know, um, [MN] uh -- [inaudible] my microwave.  Uh, make it harder to have access, you know what I'm saying?  Accessibility to it, you know, or something.  Tax it, make people who really want it pay for it, that's what I mean.  You know what I mean?
L:  O- okay.  So, you, like -- you wanna limit it as much as possible pretty much?
R:  Yeah, basically.  If you try to limit it at least, I mean, just exactly -- it would be great if you could just limit it, you know, but, um, you know that's -- that's the problem right there, limiting, so ...
L:  I think it's very difficult to monitor something like smoking ban- -- banning smoking in, like, public areas is, like -- be like a park --
R:  It'd make people be a black market, yeah.
L:  Yeah, like a park, you know, if you can't just -- if somebody goes in the corner and starts smoking, like, it -- it'd be hard to monitor that anyways.
R:  You said if someone goes to a park and what?
L:  Well, like, if someone smokes, like, at the corner of a building, like, you know, who's gonna monitor it and who's gonna, like, charge them with doing something wrong, you know?  Just can't have, like, police everywhere.
R:  Yeah, that is true.  I mean, that's -- I think that's what it would turn into.  It would turn into, like, a big, um, black underground market [LAUGH] of cigarettes.  Got some cigarettes, got some cigarettes for you.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  And people already do that now.  Think about a bus -- I just -- matter of fact, just today I walked by downtown and, um, and by some bus stations, and they -- the guy was, like, "I got two Newports for, I think, fifty cents" or something like that, two for a dollar or something.  I was like, "What?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Newports?  I mean, cigarettes?  I was like, "Come on, man".  And that's what it could be.  There's people who just ask, like, "Have you got -- can I bum a cigarette?" you know, or, "You got a cigarette?" and it'd be just like that, too, man.  But the thing is, it -- [inaudible] I mean, I guess if they just had -- well, then, it's -- that -- that'd be real hard, but if it was probable, I'd say make it hard to get -- you know, have access to 'em, man, for real. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I think it's --
R:  Someone's -- huh?
L:  What were you saying?
R:  No, go ahead, go ahead, you.
L:  I was gonna say, I think we've done ten minutes. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm at --
L:  But --
R:  Mine's just now hit ten minutes.  And what I was just about to say, it's hard to talk on this topic for ten minutes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what I was just about to say.  On this one.  I'm a -- I'm a person that talks, but this one here is kinda hard to talk about that topic, so, yeah, looks like it's ten minutes, so if it's not I guess they can call us back, I guess, so ...
L:  So, like, do we hang up?
R:  You ready to go?
L:  Do we stay on or do we ...?
R:  I don't know, dude.  I really don't know.  Actually, it's been ten minutes, twenty two seconds, twenty three seconds, [NOISE] twenty four --
L:  Since we started talking or ...?
R:  Since -- no, since they -- I answered the phone, so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I don't know, yeah, if -- I don't know if we're supposed to --
L:  Well, maybe we just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- wanna wait for, like, a minute and a half or something?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Right.  So, you never smoked in your life?
R:  Uh, I have. [LAUGH] My father smokes, actually, and I think my father smoking, that's a really -- I mean, I used to always be like, man, yeah, I can smoke, and the crazy thing is that, like, that smoke has something to do with us, you know what I mean?  It's secondhand.  You're making my life bad because you have a habit, you know?
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Ain't that messed up, though, you know what I mean?
L:  I think so, too. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, that's not cool.  So, it's like, thinking about that, it's like the same thing for people who are sitting in a restaurant, who are sitting there smoking and the smoke comes over to my side anyway, and they're like, okay, um -- you know, I'm not try- -- I'm handling my addiction and my -- my habit, but it's coming to you.
L:  Yeah, especially at, like, bars and clubs when you go in, 'cause they don't even have, like, smoking, non
