L:  Hel- -- hel- -- 
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi. 
R:  Hi.  I'm Lindsay Wiltshire.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  I'm sorry, I said I'm Lindsay.  What's your name?
L:  I'm Deborah.
R:  Deborah.  Hi.
L:  [LAUGH] Don't you love these calls? 
R:  I know, they're funny.  Um, what do you think?
L:  Whether or not public schools should [NOISE] -- I didn't catch the last of it.  Was it --
R:  Oh, I -- I think they said do you think that public schools should, um, allow, um, books, allow cer- allow books to be read, like all books, or do you think they should be able to ban certain books -- 
L:  I think they should -- 
R:  -- public and private schools.
L:  I think they should be able to restrict.
R:  Yeah, that's kind of how I felt. [NOISE] 
L:  I mean banning is a bit too ridiculous unless it's so outrageous it could, um, [LIPSMACK] and be an adverse effect on the students.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Um, there are a lot of things that aren't age appropriate. 
R:  Mm, I think it depends on the age and -- and the level of -- of the student and the maturity -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- of them, but, yeah, I agree with [several inaudible words].  Well, [SIGH] I don't even know if restricted is the right word.  Of course, so far as [inaudible] back to you, you know, as a parent you should be able to kind of have more of a say in what your kids should read and what they shouldn't read.  Now, I think required reading is a completely different story but, you know, as far as banned books I really have a problem with, people really banning them, because there really -- it seems like it just really shouldn't be an issue if the parents and other people, you know, kind of did their jobs, then it wouldn't be a problem.
L:  True, but, um, like is it, like [MN] banning is I don't think the answer to anything, but a parent should have the option to opt out their student -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if they have any objections.
R:  Oh, definitely.  Definitely.  I feel that way.
L:  And have something alternate available.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I think -- what -- what brought to mind, um, the sort of question was some schools, the parents in them tying to attempt to ban the Harry Potter books.
R:  Yeah, um, I have a, you know -- but some people think [several inaudible words] I don't know, it just seems like that would -- it seems so extreme to me, but at the same time, I mean people have a right to their opinion and if they don't want their kids -- again, you know, if you have -- if there's a book that's offensive to you for any, you know, and your parents can say, "This is offensive", you know, "I don't want my child reading this, can you please read something else", you know, that seems, you know, appropriate, but --
L:  Right.  Uh, I think -- my kids are all out of school now, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when my youngest was in high school just a few years ago, uh, they sent home permission slips for the kids to watch an R rated movie in school.
R:  And how old were they? 
L:  An R rated movie and I said, "No!" 
R:  How old -- how old were the kids whenever they were given this permission?
L:  Juniors in high school.
R:  Juniors in high school.
L:  Right, but --
R:  Yeah.  Still, if it's not appropriate for the MPAA you shouldn't be showing it in school.
L:  Exactly, exactly.  So, um, but others -- I mean there's been big deals over all kinds of books, some that don't really seem that terribly inappropriate.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I mean same here.  Well, even [several inaudible words] school, and, um, they -- whenever I was in high school they would offer -- they would have times where they would let you read, not necessarily a banned book, but you could pick the books that you wanted to read that weren't on the normal reading list -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and, um, you know, even if they were, you know, like Catcher in the Rye or something like that, books that are, you know, generally not -- they -- they won't make -- they're not school sponsored readings but at the same time they're good books that happen to have some different, you know, content to it that is considered inappropriate for some.
L:  For some, mhm. 
R:  And it was kind of nice that -- they kind of gave us, everybody, an out that way so that if they wanted to read it, they could, they could kind of explore, they could do what they wanted to do with it -- 
L:  Well, that's more appropriate.
R:   -- and that was nice and of course, you know, this is when I was a senior in high school and, you know, Catcher in the Rye was nothing compared to some of the other things that were out there so it was -- I really liked it, I really liked it that they did that at the time because it, you know -- at the same time once you get to that age it seems like you're either going to think like an adult or you're going to think like a child and, [SIGH] I don't know, it just -- 
L:  Well, they were books -- 
R:  I have a hard time.  I'm sorry?
L:  I'm sorry.  They're books that I would, uh, recommend are okay for a senior in high school that I wouldn't for a freshman.
R:  Oh, definitely.  Oh, yeah.  I mean -- and even [several inaudible words] get into books, it's like there are movies and things that we [several inaudible words].  That was one of the things is, you know, I taught French and [several inaudible words] that's my first day, not to [several inaudible words] ahead of time because a French movie is -- they just don't go by normal readings.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  European -- European movies in general have a different standard.
R:  Oh, [NOISE] yeah.
L:  They -- we lived in Europe for eleven and a half years -- 
R:  Oh, wow. 
L:  -- and things that we consider not at all appropriate, uh, they despise, er, violence -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but full sex is, you know, day time television. [NOISE] 
R:  [several inaudible words] I mean completely different. [several inaudible words] 
L:  I think I'm losing you.  Are you on a cell phone?
R:  I am.  [LAUGH] I would switch but I don't think I can.
L:  Hello?
R:  Um, right. [several inaudible words] 
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?  Hello, hello hello?  Hello?
L:  Was that ten minutes? 
R:  Hello?  Hello, hello, hello.  Hello.  I'll try and go outside.
L:  Hello, are you still there? 
R:  Hello?  Okay, I'm outside.  Can you hear me?  No, because I have voice [inaudible].
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [PAUSE] Hello?
