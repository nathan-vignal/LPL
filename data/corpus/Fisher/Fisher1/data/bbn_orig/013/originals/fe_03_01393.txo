L:  Hi.  I'm Nicole from Deep Springs. 
R:  Hi.  I'm Rachel.  [PAUSE] Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Oh, hi.
L:  I'm sorry.  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, [NOISE] I don't know -- I haven't had -- done these -- one of these calls before, so -- 
L:  I never did either. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  I'm like, "Okay".
R:  I guess we're just supposed to talk about exercise right now. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, -- 
L:  How often do you exercise?
R:  Um, probably about twice a week, when I have time. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm, like, once a week.
R:  What do you do?
L:  I just do, like, -- sometimes obviously lift arm weights and stuff -- 
R:  Mhm.  Uh, --
L:  -- because I'm pregnant, so I don't want to do too much right now.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] I do a little bit but, like, when I wasn't pregnant I just liked doing like exercise videos and stuff.
R:  Mhm.  Do you go to the gym?
L:  No.
R:  No.  I --
L:  I used to.
R:  I used to, too, but I'm in school, so -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't have a lot of time.
L:  I used to go all the time.  I used to be there, like, five days a week at least.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  Um, -- 
L:  I like doing, um, -- do you ever go to Bally's? 
R:  We don't have them around here.  
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I'm from Kentucky. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, when I go to the gym it's like the YMCA type thing, community gym. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I always go to, um, the Bally's have, like, a regular part of the gym -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they have a top floor where you can just go, like, to be alone just with the women.
R:  Oh.
L:  Like so, you know, you don't have to do like your thigh master and stuff. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  [inaudible] [LAUGH], you know. 
R:  That would be nice.
L:  And they have a really nice track on the top floor.
R:  Oh.
L:  And you just, like, you can run or walk or whatever you want to do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's cool.  Do you do exercise videos? [NOISE] 
R:  Um, I've tried the Tai-Bo one --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I just, I -- I just don't like that type of thing.  I mostly -- I have a, um, ten speed bike that I go out bike riding a couple of miles when I do go, just ride over -- all over town type of thing.
L:  Yeah.  I, like, um, I do, like, the Kathy Ireland videos.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I like them, like, some of them -- 
R:  Have you tried the --
L:  -- they have, like, the one that you can do, like, not yoga but stretches -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, it's real nice for doing, like, right before you go to bed or when you wake up.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I like stretching.
R:  Have you ever tried yoga?  I've tried it once.
L:  No, I haven't tried it.  It just looks funny [inaudible] to me. [LAUGH]
R:  It's a lot harder than what it looks like.  You wouldn't think --
L:  Yeah, you have to be really flexible.
R:  Mhm.  You wouldn't think to stand in a position would be that hard, but I mean you're like, "Okay, time to go another one, [LAUGH] this is too hard".
L:  [LAUGH].  No, but, um, [MN] I like doing, like, sit ups and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I like that and I -- 
R:  Did you -- 
L:  -- I want to get a, um, mini stepper.
R:  What are -- are those like the stair stepper type thing?
L:  They're like the stair things but they have, like, not, like, a big, huge machine that you can, like, tuck it under a couch or -- 
R:  Oh, ahah.
L:  -- a bed or stuff.  It's real small.
R:  Oh.
L:  It doesn't have, like, the whole arm thing, it's just the bottom part with the steppers.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And I want to do that because that would be cool for doing it, like, while you're watching TV.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I like roller skating.
R:  Oh, I do the, um, -- I like -- I do roller blading a lot when I have a chance.
L:  Yes.  I used to roller blade but I -- I got scared when I was going down the hill. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I did that once.  I wiped out.
L:  I used -- I used to like -- I'd roller blade around the neighbourhood but I just got real -- when you go down the hills it was all scary. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Around here we have a, um, they call it a green belt, which is a trail they have built around the town.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just for roller blading and bicycling, so I do that a lot.  That way you don't have to mess with sidewalks and curbs and -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- cars and all that.
L:  Well, I'm in an apartment, so I don't like too much outside stuff, you know? 
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, I want to get, like, a stationary bike.  That would be cool.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, so you still get to do it, you just [inaudible] [LAUGH] [several inaudible words]
R:  Yeah.  When I do go to the gym that's what I usually -- the -- the stationary bikes that you can program going up the hill and all that kind of stuff.
L:  Yeah, and then I go in the steam room.
R:  Mm.
L:  At the -- at the gym they have a steam room.  I like that.
R:  Mm.  Mine has a pool, but -- 
L:  Yeah, I go to, like, swim, too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's too -- it just started getting nice out here so hopefully I will be able to do something again soon.
R:  Yeah.  We just finally had warm weather here as well.
L:  Yeah.  It's nice to be able to get out and everything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think, like, when it's warmer you feel, like, you have more energy to exercise, anyway.
R:  Mhm.  Yes.
L:  Like, when it's cold out, like in the winter, I don't really feel, like, doing much.
R:  Mhm.  Well, in here w- we move the time forward so there's -- you have more time in the evening, it doesn't get dark like at five at night [LAUGH] so -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so you actually have time to go exercise.
L:  Mm, I just like the -- I think I like the videos because it feels like other people are doing them with you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They're not, like, watching you look stupid or something. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  I'm too tempted to hit the pause button though, you know, when I get tired. 
L:  It's, like, you feel, like, you're not alone because, you know, they talk the whole time, but -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but they're not there to watch you, like, "Oh, you look so stupid doin' it". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's the sort of thing at my gym.  They have all the equipment around the outside of the room -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so when you're exercising you're, like, staring at everybody else [LAUGH] and I just --
L:  [LAUGH] I like aerobics.  I like aerobics a lot.  
R:  Wha- -- 
L:  I don't like the step thing, though, you know like the aerobics stuff? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't like that too much.  I like just the regular floor aerobics.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like that.  I like them.
R:  Have you ever tried spinning?
L:  No.
R:  I haven't -- I haven't worked up the nerve to do that yet. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It looks really hard.
L:  And sometimes, like, you know, that magazine, fitness magazine? 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, sometimes I'll do some of the things that are in there -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- because sometimes they have, like, a page of just the exercises that you can try to do for whatever, you know, your legs -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or your stomach or whatever.
R:  Mm.
L:  Sometimes I like them.  I like to, like, make my own routine and I just like put on the music sometimes -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then I'll do my own thing, like, with the bicep curls or, you know? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the calf raises.
R:  The what?
L:  You ever do them, the calf raises?  You can do them just, like, around your house, like, you don't have to have a machine or anything.
R:  Ahah.
L:  And you can just, like, hold onto, like, if you have a tall dresser or whatever -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or the back of a chair and you just, like, lift up on your toes.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.  
L:  You know what I'm talking about?
R:  I know what you're talking about now --  
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- ahah.
L:  But you can feel them after like ten min.  You're like, "Whoa". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And the one I said, it's, like, "Do, like, eighty of them" and I'm, like, "Oh, my God".
R:  Golly.
L:  But I do them to, like, music, so -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [inaudible] -- like, the time passes by real fast.
R:  Mhm.
L:  See, I have to work on my legs, that's what I want to work on and my stomach, but not until after the baby.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You can't really do anything, [NOISE] I don't think, when you're [inaudible].
R:  No.  I -- I know the --
L:  I won't even try it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, I know the limit.
L:  You know, like, I'll do -- I'll do like bicep curls or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I don't want to try anything with my stomach.
R:  Some of our friends that are pregnant go to the water aerobics.
L:  Oh, yeah, I heard of those.  That's just -- that's just really cool because then you don't even feel pregnant -- [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because you're, like, weightless.
R:  Mhm.  They say by the time you're done it's -- you're pretty much like you're playing around in the water, but when you're done, you're actually tired -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you actually work the muscles, so ...
L:  Yeah.  I like to swim a lot --
R:  I'm not a big swimmer. [LAUGH]
L:  -- just, like, laps and stuff.  I just like laps and stuff like that.
R:  Mhm.  Um, my favorite is just the bike. [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I feel, like, I'm getting something accomplished going from one point to the other. [MN]
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  Like I told you, I really want to do -- I like the step- -- the stepper.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think that's really neat.
R:  The one I like, it's kind of like between a stepper and a bike.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You just kind of pedal but you're standing up.  I don't know what it's called, but --
L:  I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] That one you set hills and everything, too, so it's like you're running up hills type of thing, but -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but it's not a treadmill.  I -- I can't stand the treadmills. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I haven't been [inaudible] gym in a while, a couple of years, I think.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I used to be there, I told you, all the time -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and now I'm, like, deprived of all kinds of new contraptions. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, [LAUGH] like spinning.  I never even like -- what is that?  You just run -- spin around?
R:  Um, it's a bike but it's got, um, -- 
L:  Oh, okay, I thought they was like a class. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- the -- oh, no.
L:  Like, I always hear about it, like, on the radio. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, they do a class.  There's, like, an -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- an instructor that's in the front of the room -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and there's exercises somehow with the bike, like, you bike different speeds, backwards, forwards and there's a whole exercise routine -- 
L:  Oh, wow. 
R:  -- like, the whole time you're bicycling.
L:  I want to try that now. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I want to try that now.  It didn't sound, like, it was just like spinning and I'm like ... [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  It's, um, from when I talk to people, they always say you have to exercise a little bit before you work your way into that class -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because you sometimes --
L:  You can't just do it as a beginner.
R:  Yeah, sometimes the instructors --
L:  Like, start out with a routine at the gym and then work your way up [inaudible] it. 
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, they -- because it exercises your arms and your legs.  They say you have to kind of get used to -- kind of be a little coordinated, too, [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to keep up with all the different exercises.
L:  That sounds fun, though.
R:  Mhm.  There's some people at the gym I go to, they're -- I mean they're older, like in their sixties, and they're doing the spinning.  It's -- and I'm thinking, "I can't even do that". [LAUGH] [inaudible]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you run or anything?
L:  No, I -- I never was much of a runner.  Like, I was running [inaudible].  I don't like -- I'm not -- like I told you, because I'm in an apartment -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't just, like, -- there's not, like, a neighborhood neighborhood to run out, like, 'cause there's, like, a busy street right there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, like, ... I wouldn't mind if I had, like, a treadmill -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, then I would probably run.  Like, again, if it was in my house, that would be easier [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know? 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Do you run?
R:  Um, not really.  I -- I'd ra- -- I like to roller blade instead.  Um, I had -- when I was in high school I played tennis and I hurt one of my ankles, so running's a lot harder on it, so I try to not do that, not hurt it, and so I guess with the roller blades because you've got the ankle support it doesn't hurt as much, so ... 
L:  Yeah.  I used to play soccer for, like, five years.
R:  Oh! 
L:  I liked that and I was a cheer leader so you got into all the gymnastic stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I like that stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It didn't even feel, like, you were really exercising because you were just, like, hanging out with everyone [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  You know. [LAUGH]
R:  I played tennis for four years and that -- that was about the same because you -- you'd only play one --
