R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, this is, uh, Pineep[?].
L:  This is Sarah.
R:  Okay.  Hey, Sarah.  Okay, uh, I guess we have to talk about smoking?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  Um, well, you wanna start?
L:  Are you a smoker?
R:  Oh, no, no, I'm not.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Are you? [LAUGH]
L:  No.
R:  Okay.  Uh, have you ever tried smoking?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, me too.  Um --
L:  I'm a bar smoker.
R:  Oh.
L:  That's what I would call myself.
R:  Okay.  So, like, whenever you go out you'll maybe have a couple of cigarettes?
L:  Yeah.
R:  All right.  That -- I guess that's -- yeah.  I've done that a couple of times, but I kinda stopped because, uh, didn't make me feel too good.  I kinda got sick.  But that might have been 'cause excessive alcohol, but anyways, um ... so, uh, we had to talk about smoking prevention programs and whatnot?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  So, uh --
L:  [SIGH] And in public places, so --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Okay, so, like, yeah, what do you think [LAUGH] about stuff like that?
L:  Well, actually where I live, they have banned smoking in most of the restaurants.  Um, and -- unless they serve X amount -- I live in a college town.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Unless they serve X amount of liquor sales or whatever.  So --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- basically, what has happened is, um, quite a few businesses have just discontinued the food.  So, since they banned the smoking, um, I know of at least four businesses that have either closed or just quit serving food.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Um --
R:  I didn't know that, so --
L:  Because of the smoking, at least here where I live.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, you know, I used to think that, oh, it's no big deal.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But on the other hand --
R:  I guess it's affecting small business --
L:  -- I used to go to two of the restaurants that are now closed.
R:  Oh, okay, wow, yeah.  So, it's personally affected you?
L:  Yeah, I would say so.
R:  Okay.  Oh, uh, yeah, um, actually, like, um, my parents own a restaurant, uh, back home and, um, like, we don't have any laws on smoking in Texas.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, like --
L:  But do they allow smokers in the restaurant?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  We have a separate smoking section and everything, but, I mean, it hasn't ever been, like, a problem or anything.  But, uh, I think, like, these type of programs would, I think, hurt a lot of small businesses in the end.  And, I mean --
L:  Yeah, because if your parents --
R:  -- you've personally been affected --
L:  -- if -- if none of those smokers went in there any more --
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, and a lot of people do request that separate smoking section, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  So, um, I guess it's a -- I -- I -- I would kinda be against the smoking in public places program 'cause it does hurt a lot of small businesses.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's what I would say.  I mean, I just think that it -- it [SIGH] -- I don't know.  I mean, smokers will say that it's getting harder to smoke anywhere, so ...
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I -- I would --
L:  And it's still legal --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, you know.
R:  I didn't -- yeah.  I mean, I don't advocate smoking at all because I know what it can do to people and I've seen a lot of people go through, uh, tremendous illnesses and -- and I guess, like, these type of programs are meant to prevent people from getting [LAUGH] -- [MN] it's meant to deter smoking more and more, right?
L:  Right, and to -- and to reduce your exposure to second hand smoke 'cause --
R:  Yeah, and I guess that's, uh --
L:  Well, at least the -- the smoking prevention ads that they play here are, like, "If you work in a bar, you're exposed to five cigarettes an hour".  It's like smoking five cigarettes an hour or something like that.
R:  Oh, wow.  I -- I've never seen an ad like that.
L:  Some -- yeah.
R:  Oh, that's a -- but those are, like, scary statistics, right, that a lot of people would just, like, try to --
L:  Yeah, I don't know if they'd believe 'em or not.
R:  Yeah.  And I guess they're just scare tactics that people wanna use to prevent more people from [NOISE] taking up smoking or from -- or maybe support the, uh, the program to, uh, ban it in public places and whatnot.
L:  I think the best -- my personal feeling is that the best preventative, it's not -- I haven't really seen too many people successfully quit smoking.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I think the easiest thing is to keep people from smoking.
R:  Oh, okay.  'Cause once you start --
L:  So --
R:  -- it's hard to quit.
L:  Once you start you can't seem to quit.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, if you just don't start, you know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm not sure how effective these -- these cheesy ad campaigns are.  I mean, I would -- I don't know what they're doing with smoking prevention in the schools, but I'm -- you know, I mean for the younger kids, but that's where I would rather see them use the ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'd rather see 'em use the money towards, you know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  My husband's parents, he's -- he's forty and his parents quit smoking because he came home from school every day for months --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on end going, "Cigarettes are bad and you need to quit smoking or you're gonna kill yourself".
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  You know.
R:  So, like, okay.
L:  And they quit smoking --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- because he was just harping on 'em all the time.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.  Um --
L:  And he's never been a smoker.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Even -- not even socially.  I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, whatever they did at his school sunk in.
R:  Yeah, I imagine.  Also, like, nowadays they have all those, uh, truth commercials.  I don't know if you've seen them?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just eliminate lies.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And, uh, I think those are really effective.  Like, uh, they always get me thinking about, like, what kind of, uh, tactics the big tobacco companies are using and, like, things like how -- how bad smoking is for you, how bad smoking is actually for you, you know.  Like --
L:  Right, in what they've covered up and --
R:  And those are, like, mainly targeted towards teenagers 'cause teenagers are in the ads and I think those -- that's where I think smoking actually starts, right.  Like, mostly in your teenage years.
L:  If not, junior high, yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Young teen.  I mean, I know some people that were young teenagers.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, like twelve, thirteen, fourteen.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah.
L:  So, yeah, that -- that makes sense.
R:  Yeah, those are -- and they always come on during, like, shows which are, like, directed at teens.
L:  Teeny bopper shows.
R:  Or not even teeny bop- -- like, uh, I -- I remember I used to watch wrestling when I -- a few years ago [LAUGH] when I --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And so, like, always I saw truth commercials during that time and, uh, I guess it just made sense because of the audience, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  [COUGH] But I don't know how much the government, like, itself is actually doing to, like -- or the federal government is doing to prevent more -- prevent kids from smoking, you know.
L:  Right.  I mean, 'cause don't -- I mean, I can't remember but one of my friends is Canadian, and he said in Canada cigarettes are, like, five or six dollars a pack.  So, a lot of people don't smoke because it's too expensive.
R:  Yeah.  But, like --
L:  I mean --
R:  I've -- I know, like, that the -- like, I've -- I've seen studies that, like, show that, like, the, uh, like, elasticity of demand for smoker -- smokers, like, who already, like, are smoking, they would pay, like, a premium [NOISE] on that, like, because of the taxes and everything with all the taxes, like, it's hard to -- because of, like, the difficulty in quitting, they would pay that extra price, you know.
L:  Right.  But maybe it would deter people from starting.
R:  Yeah, maybe.
L:  I mean, like, how many thirteen year olds wanna blow six bucks?
R:  Yeah, I know, I know, 'cause they would, uh, rather be spending on something else.
L:  Yeah.  Like, you know, video games or something.  I mean, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, probably --
L:  I mean --
R:  Probably something they would like a little more, you know.  But, like, obviously there's, like, uh, peer pressure and whatnot to [inaudible].
L:  Well, right, and then I think more -- I think more people that are -- if your parents smoke, you have easier access to cigarettes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so there's more of a chance that you could start smoking.
R:  Yeah, yeah, probably.  I -- I would definitely see that.
L:  You know, because, I mean, my mom, who died of lung cancer, smoked three, four, five packs a day.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  I mean, so there were cigarettes, ashtrays, everywhere.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You know, so --
R:  So, you had a -- very easy access to --
L:  Oh, yes.  Yes, I mean --
R:  But did you, like, was that an affecting factor why you started smoking?  Or did you ever, like, smoke, like, regularly?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  Okay.
L:  There's four kids in my family, and only --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- only, um, one of us smokes.  I mean, and she's hardcore smoker and the other three of us never have really smoked and probably never will.
R:  Oh, okay. [NOISE]
L:  Um, I mean, other than the social --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Actually, one of us, I don't think she's ever probably even lit a cigarette.
R:  Oh, okay. [NOISE]
L:  Um, well, I know that, um, I guess because my mom was such a heavy smoker --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- she had real obvious, you know, like, the hacking cough from about forty on and stuff like that --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- that I -- I can remember, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so I think that did kinda --
R:  Was that a deterrence?  Yeah, I can imagine that -- that kind of like --
L:  I mean, that was kinda of a deterrent, yeah.
R:  -- really prevalent, uh, effect would deter people from -- or teens most --
