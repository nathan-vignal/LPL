R:  Catherine.
L:  Michael. [NOISE] You knew about this? [NOISE] How did you know the PIN? [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] You too, huh?
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, okay, I don't think it's gonna be sufficient.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It might be depending on what area somebody's in, but for the most part across the United States I don't think that's gonna be a sufficient amount [PAUSE] of money to make.
L:  No.
R:  [NOISE] And then if --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, if they raise the minimum wage then, of course, that's only two hundred dollars a week at forty hours. [SIGH] But then again, if they raise minimum wage then, of course, your lower [SIGH] -- your more menial jobs, they'll have to raise that.  And then, of course, the prices are gonna go up --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, accordingly. [COUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Have you done this before?
L:  I'm sorry, I -- I just got on.  My husband had gotten the phone call. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's okay.  Have you done this before?
L:  Uh, one time.
R:  One time?
L:  Yeah.
R:  This is my first time.
L:  Ah. [LAUGH]
R:  So, and it's minimum wage is the topic.
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, do we think it should be increased to five dollars?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  How do we feel about that?
L:  Um ... yes, I -- I think it should just for some -- to some degree and other things no. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, like I said, it's two hundred dollars a week, you know, before taxes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And if they raise it to five dollars an hour for the more menial jobs, then, of course, the prices are -- prices of everything are gonna increase accordingly.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's really not enough to take somebody off of a -- if they're on, uh, employment --
L:  Right, that's --
R:  -- and had lost a better job, or if they're on welfare and they lose their benefits when they start to work, it's really not [PAUSE] -- it's not enough to -- it's not enough to take 'em off of it.
L:  Exactly.
R:  To give them enough incentive because they're gonna lose so much more by going off.
L:  Right.
R:  If that makes sense.
L:  Right.  I agree with you. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And they're gonna listen to this.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  This is gonna be interesting.
L:  I know.
R:  But, um --
L:  I think what -- last week I had talked to somebody and it was about, um, [NOISE] the, like, hiring by race and age and stuff like that, fulfilling quotas and stuff, and I'm like, "Oh". [LAUGH]
R:  What do you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, and the other thing I said was five dollars might be sufficient in some parts of the country --
L:  Exactly.
R:  But in others, it's -- it's just not gonna be.
L:  Oh, I know.  I -- I have in- -- well, sister in law and brother in law who had lived in Texas, and there I think it probably would have been fine, the cost of living was ch- -- much cheaper, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where I am, it would never fly around here. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, [LIPSMACK] before I moved -- I'm in Kentucky, and before I moved to Kentucky I lived in Charleston.  And -- South Carolina, I'm sorry.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in Charleston, South Carolina, by myself I probably brought home between thirty five and forty, and I was married.  And so, you know, with a combined income, that was decent money for the area.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then I got divorced and moved to Kentucky.  Well, my eyes got opened real wide because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the job market here is not anything like it was in Charleston.  The pay is very low --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it took a little while to get everything adjusted because the cost of living here is a lot lower also.  But the bills I had made, you know, credit card bills or car payments --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I had made on Charleston money.
L:  Right.
R:  So, it took a little bit of adjusting to get it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to get it straight here.  And I -- I don't think if -- if I had found a minimum wage job I couldn't have afforded to -- to live.
L:  Yeah, I don't think I would either.  I -- I live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- area and, [NOISE] you know, everything is just so much more expensive here than, you know, some other places.
R:  Well, like, our average light bill is, like, forty four dollars a month.
L:  Your average what bill?
R:  Light bill.
L:  Mm.
R:  And in Charleston it was nothing to have a light bill over three hundred.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  You know, because, well, you run an air conditioner so much.
L:  Right.
R:  But, I mean, even at -- even at, you know, minimum wage at five dollars an hour --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you figure by the time they get done taking out your taxes and everything, you're bringing home maybe one twenty five.
L:  Right.
R:  And one twenty five four times a month --
L:  Right.
R:  Like, four -- six hundred dollars a month, how could you -- I mean, you couldn't afford to have a car.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN] So, I -- I think if --
L:  And let alone if you have children or anything.
R:  Yeah, yeah, then you're out even more if you've got kids.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, shoot, you would never get a new pair of shoes.
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  But, uh, [LAUGH] well, daycare alone, even if -- if you were bringing home minimum wage at five dollars an hour, of course --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and bringing home that money, daycare -- most daycare is a hundred and twenty five dollars a week.
L:  That's cheap. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, for a child.  I mean, I've seen it --
L:  Yeah, I -- I have a seven month old, and if he was in daycare I'd probably be paying about a hundred and seventy five to two hundred dollars a week for him.
R:  So, you would have to have a job making, what -- a- at the minimum you figure after gas and, of course, the meals you're gonna have to eat out --
L:  Right.
R:  And the different things that you're gonna have to buy for the house because you're working and you don't have time to do it --
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, at a minimum you'd have to make fifteen to, what, twenty dollars an hour.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, fifteen minimum.
L:  [NOISE] Exactly.
R:  So ... I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know what to think.  I don't even know what minimum wage is now.
L:  [NOISE] What is minimum wage? [NOISE] Yeah, my husband said it's five twenty five or five fifty, something like that. [NOISE]
R:  Well, then, why are they talking about only raising it to five dollars?
L:  I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  That is just weird.
L:  [LAUGH] It is.
R:  That doesn't make much sense.  I don't know.
L:  I don't know.
R:  How long do we -- how long do we discuss the topic?
L:  I'm not sure.  For some reason, like, ten minutes sticks in my --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- mind, so ... [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  What?
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] [NOISE] Kentucky. [LAUGH]
R:  So, you don't work?
L:  I do work.  I'm a nurse, but I don't -- I work weekends.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  So, in my working weekends I make more than I was working -- when I was working fulltime, so ...
R:  And go figure.  Well, nobody wants to work weekends.
L:  Right.  No one wants to work weekends and it works out with having a baby that I'm home during the week then, so ...
R:  Mhm.  I -- I'm a dispatcher, so ...
L:  Oh, okay. [COUGH]
R:  Th- that's always -- well, police nine one one.
L:  Ah.
R:  So, that's always -- it's interesting.
L:  Yes, I'm sure that is. [LAUGH]
R:  And we don't make -- I mean, believe it or not, we don't make much above minimum wage.  When you first start out --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- you don't make -- I think I make, like, seven sixty nine an hour right now.
L:  Oh, jeeze.
R:  For this area, though, that's good.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  But, I mean, for the overall scheme of things --
L:  Right, when you have all the bills and stuff. [LAUGH]
R:  -- no, it's not.  Huh?
L:  When you have all your bills and stuff and it all adds up. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well, now, I mean, now things are -- it's different.  You know, we've got vehicles paid off and, you know, don't use credit cards because the places just aren't here. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  So, but it -- so it's different, so we're making it now whereas if we'd have done -- if -- if I'd, you know, done the move maybe seven, eight years ago, there would've been no way.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No way.  But it just goes to show the differences that they pay.
L:  Right.
R:  In -- well, 'cause here, you know, the amount you make here and then in Charleston, you're making twenty three dollars an hour.
L:  [NOISE] Wow. [LAUGH]
R:  So ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's a big cut.  It makes you just swallow [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- before you walk in.
L:  [LAUGH] I know just in, like, looking at nursing jobs around the country, you know, it seems like down in the southern states the pay rate is considerably less than it is here and, you know, I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if we had to move and took all our bills with us, I think we'd be in trouble. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, mhm.  Do you, um -- well, then again it depends on what area of the south you get into.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Uh, Charleston was a lot more expensive than it is here.  But if you get into some of your poorer states or some of your poorer towns --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then -- then, of course, it -- it goes accordingly.  I mean, 'cause, like, here, I mean, we have a lot of unemployment, we have a lot of welfare --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it -- it's really amazing how much there is and how much people don't have.  And in Charleston, I mean, there was unemployment --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I'm sure there was welfare.  But I don't think you saw it as much, if that makes sense.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My son's giving his opinion. [LAUGH]
R:  I hear him.  You said he's seven months old?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, congratulations.
L:  Thanks.
R:  How -- can I -- can I ask how old you are?
L:  I'm twenty nine.
R:  Oh, okay.
