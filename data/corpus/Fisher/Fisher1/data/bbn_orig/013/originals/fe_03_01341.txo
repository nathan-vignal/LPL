R:  Hi, this is Cindy.
L:  Hi, this is Stephanie.
R:  So what do you think about the subject?
L:  Um, well [LAUGH], I, um, -- my first inclination is to say no.  I don't think that they can borrow it, but I don't think they can enforce it either.  I don't think they can make someone read a book for, like, religious reasons or otherwise. 
R:  I agree with that.  Um, I don't think they should be censoring things completely but at the same time I wouldn't want my nine year old reading a book about sex at school.  You know, what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  And they didn't say, you know, specifically what grade level.
L:  Exactly.
R:  So -- 
L:  Well, they also didn't say if it was in class or if they weren't allowed to check a book out from a library.
R:  Yeah.  Kind of vague there but, um, I have a nine year old, an eleven year old and a fourteen year old and they read a variety of books.  They have a really big reading program at school and the Harry Potter books have been censored in their school.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, and I think that's -- that's a bit much being that they are children's books.  So I don't -- I don't agree with the censoring thing like that, you know, to that extent but I guess on one level like I said as far as the things containing sex, it's a bit much.
L:  What if it was a, ah, research on three or fourteen year old, um, and it was a sexually transmitted disease book and they wouldn't allow -- they borrowed all those books because they said they contained sexual things?
R:  I would have a problem with that having a fourteen year old and kids becoming sexually active at earlier ages now.  I think if they are going to sit down and do research on it then that might help them to be safe and not end up with some sexually transmitted disease.  I don't think that should be censored from them or be barred from them.
L:  Well, I think that was part of -- well, at least from my knowledge of, um, why they didn't want 'em banned, all material from the internet because all sexual material -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because things -- sites like that that were for medical purposes would be banned as well.
R:  Right.
L:  So I'm -- I'm just thinking that could be applied to schools.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, what if they had a parental control on who can check out a book?  And so if they wanted to check out, like, Harry -- 'cause I don't think it's fair, right, if they ban Harry Potter but where do you draw the line?
R:  Right.  Well, my daughter had participated in a teen choice group, and some of the material -- the books that they would be reading and studying during that point -- basically, the subject was sex.  How to say no, you know, how to avoid it, how to avoid peer pressure and that sort of thing and we had to sign a permission slip to allow our child to view the material.
L:  This is a fourteen year old?
R:  Ah, eleven year old.
L:  Eleven year old? 
R:  Uh-huh, so I think -- I agree with that if it's parental controlled and have each individual parent decide whether their child can view it or not.
L:  Right, because some -- some parents might want not Harry Potter to be read.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, so in that sense I feel like it probably should be more of a parental control basis.
R:  I agree with that.
L:  Than as a, um, ban for the libraries but I also don't think -- I feel like, you know, teachers reading in a classroom setting they -- I mean, they're basically allowed to teach whatever --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they feel is necessary.  Most wouldn't teach a book with sexual -- 
R:  Right, not in an elementary setting, you know. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like I said, my daughter is eleven.  She is in the fifth grade and they sent a permission slip home.  And out of twenty two girls in the class, there were only ten of 'em that were allowed to participate and some of the other parents, you know, it was religious region- reasons or they thought their child was too young and, you know, if it's going to teach my child to abstain from sexual activity at eleven years old, then I'm all for it.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  Do you have kids?
L:  I'm -- no. [LAUGH] 
R:  You sound really young. 
L:  I am really young.
R:  How old are you?
L:  I'm twenty one.
R:  Twen- I'm thirty one.
L:  Okay. 
R:  So.
L:  Well, yeah, I'm not young enough [LAUGH] to say yes everything should be allowed but -- 
R:  Right.  Well, see that's kinda where I'm coming from because I at aged twenty one already had two kids and I think if those materials had been available when I was younger, then I would have known a little bit more because discussing sexual activities was not allowed in my home, so -- 
L:  Right.  And a lot of those pictures -- a lot of those classes are scare tactics I think which work well.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  When you have a group of eleven year old girls going in and saying, you know "You kissed this boy and he's kissed this girl and she's kissed this guy and this guy's kissed", you know, "You kiss him, you're kissing everybody else", they've been kissing and my daughter was like, "Mom, that's gross".
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  You know, not to mention and they even went into detail about abortion and adoption and things like that and the material that they went over, the books and the paperwork and things like that, she brought home and we went through and discussed it together and then at the end of it, they had the option to sign the card promising to abstain from sex until they were married or not to, and she signed it.  So I hope this is the promise, you know, that she'd make to herself and talk with her friends about it and share material about it, you know, but at the same time I don't want to share anything that another parent is going to have a problem with.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, it's kind of hard dealing with that.  She has one friend that's a Catholic and it's absolutely forbidden, so -- and -- and I'm pretty open with my kids.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't want 'em to go to a stranger to find out something I'd rather they came to me if they needed help or needed information or what not, and I think to a point, like you said, research materials and things like that, I think it should be allowed, but I think too with a certain age group and beyond that, I think the parental consent.  You're a pretty smart cookie for a twenty one year old.
L:  [LAUGH] Thanks.  Um, what -- do you think it makes a difference for private or, um, public?
R:  Private school or public school?
L:  Mhm? 
R:  Yeah, I think so.
L:  You do? 
R:  I think there's a huge difference 'cause, I mean, in -- 
L:  'Cause you're paying for them to go there?
R:  Yeah, and in this area all the private schools are Christian schools.  So -- I'm -- they've made a big deal about, you know, how their kids' academic is so much better because there are no bits dealing in sex or evil or violence or things like that.
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  Yes.
L:  That's interesting because some public schools actually have more leeway. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because they don't have as many state controls.
R:  Well, these -- I mean, the private schools, the private schools here -- 
L:  I mean, private schools, that's what I mean. 
R:  Yeah, private schools are -- here are Christian based.  So that's dealing with the religion.
L:  Right.
R:  The public schools have a little bit more leeway.
L:  But then -- so let's just theoretically say that your kids -- you were, um, Muslim and your kids went to a -- wanted to go to that private Christian school because that was a better education, um, would you say -- and they had, um, bible reading in the morning, would -- would that be something that you'd -- I mean, do you think that you could say that you didn't want your kids to do that?
R:  I don't know that much about the Muslim religion but we're pretty open, and if it were something that my child chose to pursue, I mean, that's their choice.
L:  Right, but if it was -- 
R:  They believe in.
L:  -- imposed by the school that they mandatorily had to do that?
R:  I don't think they should mandatory any type of religion.  I mean, we have a lot of parents here at Benarms[?] because they can't say the, ah, -- they can't pray before any sporting events.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because it violates the religious beliefs of so many other people.
L:  The First Amendment, right.
R:  And I agree with that on one level because I wouldn't want someone of a different religion imposing on mine.
L:  Right.
R:  But at the same time I think if it's done privately and quietly and -- 
L:  I agree if it's not -- 
R:  Then they can't, you know.
L:  If it's not mandated.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, if it's not, you have to do that, then I feel that if you don't allow it to happen then you are infringing on others.
R:  So -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  Are you --
L:  Sorry? 
R:  Are you in college?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yes, well, that's good.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You get all kinds of research material, huh?
L:  In college?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, we do. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] This is neat.  This is the first one of these I've done.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  The last -- I did one before and it was on, um, TV shows or the -- like Who Wants to be a Millionaire and things like that and I don't watch TV so -- [LAUGH]
R:  I don't watch much either.
L:  And neither did the lady I was talking to so it was a really --
