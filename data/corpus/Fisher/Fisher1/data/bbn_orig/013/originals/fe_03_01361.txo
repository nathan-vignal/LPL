L:  Hello, my name is Wanda Kindell, I’m in South Carolina.
R:  Well, hello, Wanda.  My name is Wanda Woody!  [LAUGH]
L:  How about that!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  And I am in Kaluakona[?], Hawaii.
L:  Woah!  We’re a long ways apart!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yes we are.  How are you doing?
L:  Just fine, it’s beautiful weather here today.
R:  And here too.
L:  It should always be there!
R:  It usually is.
L:  Well, we had -- we had snow two weeks ago.
R:  Oh, did you?
L:  Yes!  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh my goodness!
L:  Big change.
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.  Now, censorship in schools.  Well, when you’re training your children for the future, they need to have a resource of what to base their thoughts and beliefs on, so I think they should be taught just about everything.
R:  I agree with that, because they need to be able to think for themselves.
L:  Right.
R:  And they can’t be taught what to think, what to believe, they’ve got to be able to have a basis for their choice.
L:  Correct.
R:  And it has to be their decision, but it should be guided by the parents, although they should have all avenues explored to them through the schools, the churches, whatever their, you know, their public range is.  But then they should always have their guidance from mom and dad.
L:  That’s right.  It’s -- i-
R:  Including television!  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh yes!  [LAUGH]  But certain things on TV you have to censor for morality, uh, you don’t want your children watching some stuff.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  That’s a totally different issue.  But this is books, yeah.
R:  Right.  A- and even if they do, though, you know, it’s, uh, a, you know, if they come home and they say watched something at someone else’s house.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Then you need to be able to sit down as a parent and talk to your child about, you know, “How did you feel about that?  What are your thoughts about, you know, what you saw?”  And, you know, “Did it bother you?” or, you know, whatever, so that they’ve got that avenue of conversation open with that child to give them some guidelines to make a decision on, you know, what they saw and whether it was right or wrong maybe.
L:  Do you remember the books about Tarzan?
R:  Yes.
L:  Have you ever read those?  Back in the sixties, when I was in high school, in the town that I live in, the books about Tarzan were censored by the local libraries.  They were taken off the library shelves because they said, “Tarzan and Jane were not married”.
R:  Oh my word!
L:  Now that was a censorship of a literary work that didn’t have a thing to do with teaching ‘em anything, it was just a book to read and enjoy.  It was a fiction.
R:  And those were movies as well!
L:  And that’s carrying it too far.  Because it was a lot of fun to watch.  And really, as a child, growing up watching Johnny Wasmalla[?] and Jane on the movies, I never even once thought about them not being married.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Until I became an adult and they brought it to the forefront!  It never even entered my mind as a child!
R:  Oh my gosh!
L:  And -- and the censorship itself brought it to the forefront.  The kids are not gonna think about it if you’re not told about it.
R:  No.  No.  They’re not -- i- it -- it isn’t going to dawn on them, especially the younger ones.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, unless you point it out to ‘em.  It’s like prejudice or anything else --
L:  That’s right.
R:  -- if you -- if you point it out to ‘em and make it obvious, then they will be aware of it, they may even believe it, but here again, they should be able to be given the choice, that decision.
L:  The people made such an uproar over that censorship that the, uh, person who was over at the libraries here were fired.  And the books were reinstated.  And at that time the actors who were starring in the Tarzan movies, pro- skinny fella, I can’t remember his name now, a big muscular, it was after Johnny Wasmalla, uh, he came to --
R:  George …
L:  No.
R:  Um …
L:  I can’t think of his name to save me.
R:  Well, there was another Johnny, I think, too, and I don’t remember who that was.
L:  He was tall and had sandy hair.
R:  I don’t remember all of the Tarzans but --
L:  But, he came to town.
R:  Mm.
L:  And he visited the libraries and actually signed books [LAUGH] for people, autographed them.
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  It became a big event here because of that censorship.  And I just thought it was so stupid.
R:  Well, it was a good thing they had the books back then.
L:  Yeah!  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh my goodness!
L:  Well, I -- I’ve got a copy of it myself.
R:  No, I know there are a lot of schools who will even, uh, try to censor, uh, you know, things such as, uh, you know, Catcher In The Rye and, uh, even the, uh, y- you know, Mark Twain books.
L:  That’s ridiculous.  You know, Tom Sawyer was a lot of fun.
R:  You know, Huck Finn and -- yeah.
L:  That’s all it was, it was a fiction, you knew it was a fiction because nobody lived like that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it was just fun to read.
R:  But it wa- you know, it’s because of the language and things like that.  And I don’t believe that it should be, I think children should be taught that, uh, you know, I had a -- a -- a sister in law who said, “Hey, you know, words are just a string a letters”.
L:  That’s right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That’s it.  That’s exactly right.
R:  And i- as long as that’s all it is, it should not be censored.
L:  Right.  My daughter home schools her kids, she’s got six children.
R:  Mm.
L:  And she has got them reading just exactly what they have to read and nothing else.  They’re not allowed to watch anything on TV by Disney because of Disney’s, uh, backing the gays, and that’s her +sporm of censorship there.  But she won’t let 'em read Disney books either.  And I -- to me, that’s depriving those children of a part of their childhood --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that is fun.
R:  Well --
L:  And she just will not listen to me when I tell her that, you know, “You’re depriving your children of an aspect of their lives they may regret later and hate you for”.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, I did do daycare before I moved over here, I lived in Kansas and I did daycare in my home.  And they did tell me what I could and could not allow the children to watch on TV, which I could appreciate.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Because, you know, I was a form of their -- you know, so I had kids show up and they’d say, “Well, my folks let me watch Power Rangers” and I’d say, “You know, that’s great, when you’re at home you can watch Power Rangers”.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I said, “Unfortunately” --
L:  It’s rather violent.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- “When you come over here, I am not allowed to let you watch that”.  So, it gave me an out so that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if I didn’t approve of something, I didn’t have to let ‘em watch it.
L:  Right.
R:  So I said, “Over here” I said, “We get the educational channel and Disney” [LAUGH] and I said, “That’s about it”.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But --
L:  Well, so you watch Disney.  She won’t even let ‘em watch Disney.
R:  Yeah.  You know, I mean, a- as long as it was a G. rated thing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I would let the kids watch it because I had young children.
L:  Right.
R:  Very young.  And I let them watch that kind of thing.  But it was up to the parents to censor at home what they didn’t want them to watch.
L:  Well, since they have gotten a little older, I have, uh, bought them books myself and given ‘em to them.  And it’s books their mother had as a child.  Identical books, like the Nancy Drew series.
R:  I loved those!  I grew un on those things!
L:  Oh yeah!  I’ve got that -- that set.  The old ones that were my daughter’s, I’ve still got ‘em.  And I bought some --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- for my grandkids.  And I told ‘em, “Read these”.  You know, “It’s all fiction” --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- “But it’s an adventure for your mind” --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- “It makes you think.  It gives you an outlet to go into another world and forget about your everyday cares”.  And that’s what children need.
R:  Well, it gives them creativity.
L:  Yeah, it makes them think.  And see, if they don’t sit and think and learn, they’re just -- they’re just gonna be kids, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  When they get older they won’t have any knowledge.  They won’t be able to, uh, distinguish thoughts.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I read voraciously when I was growing up.  I had so many books around here it was unreal.  Now, I listen to books, my eyes ain’t that great!  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, but I think children should have, you know, the opportunity to hear and to read and to see, you know, within reason.
L:  Right.
R:  Anything and everything that is available to them that is appropriate for their, you know, age.
L:  Correct.
R:  And then --
L:  You have some guidelines, you can’t give ‘em access to everything across the board.  You gotta --
R:  Right, but then, you know --
L:  -- you have some commonsense.
R:  But then mom and dad can always come back and say, you know, “Now, those are alternatives but we believe this”.  And that’s the foundation for the religion, that’s the foundation for politics, that’s a foundation for anything else.  You’re not telling them, “Your friends are wrong because they go to a different church”.
L:  That’s correct.
R:  “Your friends are wrong because they believe anything else”.
L:  That’s right.
R:  “This is what we believe, those are just alternatives”.
L:  Well, the United States is a melting pot of everybody and you have to have an open mind.  And that goes with books and literature and everything else too.
R:  I agree.
L:  And no two people are gonna think alike.  If they did, this would be a very boring world.
R:  Oh, wouldn’t it though
