R:  This is Krisha.
L:  Hi, this is Travis.  How are you?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  Good, good.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I haven't done this yet, so this is my first time.
R:  I know, me either!  I didn't know there were gonna be two of us.
L:  Yes, yeah.  So 
R:  Well that's a very broad subject, um 
L:  Very broad.  I'm a teacher, so 
R:  Oh no!  So you really have an opinion!
L:  No, not really.  But --
R:  Oh, okay!  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, yeah.  So what do you think?
R:  Um  I'm gonna say no, but only because, um, I think it's the parents' responsibility to, uh --
L:  Yeah, I 
R:  I think -- I think if the parents are -- are -- are, um, educating their children, that whatever they read isn't gonna have the same effect.
L:  I -- I agree with that.  Uh, except for at the same time you might have parents, irregardless of whether or not let's say you do -- let's say, for example I've heard of schools banning like, Slaughterhouse Five and so what say the parents are educating them, what the problem is, is that the parents still may have a problem with them reading that magazine or that book.  Does that make sense?
R:  That does make sense.  I --
L:  So, um, [SIGH] I -- I don't know.  I don't think you should, um, and of course you would love to have parents that are educated themselves and have a -- a, uh, a -- a broad out- you know, an outlook on life or on education, but at the same time, I -- I don't think it matters where you're gonna be, that you're gonna have parents that are ignorant or have different views than what the school system has.  So th- that's gonna play a lot into it.
R:  So, uh, in other words we might need some censorship because the parents just aren't educating their children or their parents don't want them to read the book?
L:  Yeah.  I think the -- I think the -- personally I think that the parents would have a bigger problem with it than a lot of the kids and their parents are gonna be the one that, you know, they're going to complain.
R:  Yes.
L:  And when they complain then, the school's are gonna back down.  [LAUGH]  There's no if, ands or buts, the schools will back down and [SIGH] say, "Okay, your kid doesn't have to read that [inaudible]".  So 
R:  So is the question really, does the school have a right to put it f- put the book out anyway?
L:  I -- I don't -- yeah, I -- I guess, I don't know.  I don't -- I don't know what I would think of [MN] --
R:  Now I'm thinking, well, the parents are paying for the school with their tax dollars.
L:  Sure.
R:  So I guess maybe they should have a little bit of a say in what books are going out there.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I agree with that.  But at the same time, you know, maybe a parent -- I don't know, I mean, you have a lot of, you know, you have to think a large per- percentage of the population of your students, their parents are probably uneducated or under educated.
R:  Yes.
L:  And so they may have a totally different view than what the k- you know, the kids are.  You know, dad or mom works in a factory, uh, you know, they might not see the attributes of a piece of literature that they, uh, the teacher does or, you know, or what the school believes at how it could benefit.  [SIGH]  So 
R:  And if you -- if you were catering to every single parent's, um, opinion, then I -- I can't imagine you would have much left --
L:  Well, no.
R:  -- in the schools to read?
L:  No.  And depending on your school systems, there isn't.  Like, you know, they have to read just, I don't know, not even some of the classics they can't read, so [SIGH]  Not being a literature teacher I don't know, you know, quite a bit, but, I don't know.  Uh, currently our students are reading Grapes of Wrath, so they're having a big problem with that.
R:  Why?
L:  Oh, well, it's a pretty bland book, that and i.e. teaching this to their schools, so the, uh, they're doing more of a movie and looking at excerpts than they are actually reading it.  But we did have parents complaining we were, uh, we had some students reading Catcher In The Rye.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH]  And, uh, it's more of a coming of age book and -- I think that's the right one -- and, um, [SIGH] we did have some problems with that.
R:  Did any parents pull their kid out of the class or just say, "My kid's read this"?
L:  Uh, didn't pull out, but isn't -- is more of an optional that they could read for like, extra credit, and one or two of the parents did not want them reading it.
R:  So it went from being an assignment to being extra credit because the parents objected?
L:  Well, it -- yeah, yes, exactly.  So  it went to being, you know, more extra credit.  But, uh, I don't know.  And who knows that the kids, the children, are going to get the analogies in there or what not?  You know, they might read Shakespeare [SIGH] and there's just some, you know, there's some, uh, lewd language in there if you actually understand it, so should -- I don't know, I guess we might -- we som- we're somewhat getting off track I suppose but 
R:  [LAUGH]  I -- I'm really on the fence on the issue too because I -- I -- I don't wanna see his stuff banned, I don't think it should be banned.  But, um --
L:  No, I agree with you.
R:  -- I think the parents should have a say.
L:  [SIGH]  I think the parents should have a say to a point but when their children rea- reach a certain age, you know, they don't say who their kids can date, probably, per se, or what their kid can do.  Uh, the child should have a right of whether or not they wanna believe that or not.  It's part of helping them to, you know, uh, get their own sense of identity and get their own, you know, ideas for themselves, so 
R:  Exactly.
L:  I -- I don't necessarily believe that the parents should have a say on what could be censored.  I don't know, it's a -- it's a very mixed topic and I'm sure [SIGH] but I think it -- I -- and I think it differs -- censorship differs at different schools as well.  I, uh, I do work at a, uh, a catholic school also, uh, doing some tutoring, and there the children are much more -- or the parents are much more open to higher education and letting their children read more books and what not, that they don't censor.  So 
R:  They don't censor?
L:  Uh, not nearly as much.
R:  Gee, that -- that's the environment where they can, it's a private school, right?
L:  Yeah, oh definitely.
R:  [MN]
L:  But I see more leeway there than I do at the public schools.
R:  I am really surprised.
L:  Well, you know, most of these parents have money, you know?  I mean, when you're talking -- you're -- you're talking about a parent paying seventy five hundred dollars a year per kid --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Most of them have got like a really good job or something and they -- they have a higher level of education --
R:  Oh, so they're more --
L:  -- than your public school students.
R:  They're more open to the literature?
L:  That's what I'm assuming, from what I've seen.  They're more open to letting their children explore things than I think a lot of public school parents.  So 
R:  [MN]
L:  And I could be totally wrong, this could just be my --
R:  No, that's a good theory.  That's a good theory.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  So  I don't know.
R:  I'm trying to think if there's anything else you can ban besides books.
L:  Uh, well, I'm sure you can ban certain, uh, you can censor certain things like, uh, Kansas has had the problem with, uh, teaching evolution and not teaching it.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  In the [SIGH] -- in their school system.  So, you can have that as well.  You know, what do you wanna teach?  And I -- I w- I was reading the other day, I forget where at, but, um, you know, they wanna teach creation as, you know, creationism, within a school district and, you know, that's a real touchy k- subject of how do you word it, you know?
R:  And doesn't that cross over church and state?
L:  Right.  You know, so they wanna have something that says, you know, a creator or a god, not go- you know, not any specific god could've created or-- how did they call it, like a divine creator or a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- devine something created, you know, like the mult- you know, cells or what not.  So, and that can be censored too.  So, uh, I don't know.  I mean, I live in the bible belt, so there are a lot more people pro creationism than let's say per -- per se evolutionism or evolution I guess that'd be.  So, I -- they can, you know, censor that.
R:  Does that community have anything in sp- anything specifically that they censor more than others?
L:  Uh, no, not re- not that I've seen, no.  There may be but, uh, [SIGH] I'm not familiar with the biology and what they teach, you know, the biology section of the school.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, so I'm not sure.  But I'm sure that it is a -- it can be censored, especially if the parents come in.  I think parents play -- play a bigger part than most people think.  You got a parent come in and hoo and holler, there might be a hundred students but one parent comes in, the, uh, faculty and the, uh, mainly the administration, are going to cater more to that parent because they're raising a big fuss.
R:  Because they made the most noise.
L:  That's right.  And it shouldn't always be that way but that's how it usually works.  So, you know, there might be a small percentage of the population of the, you know, the parents within the school but [SIGH] they're making their voice heard or [SIGH] you know, heard louder, so they have a larger say, I think.  I -- I don't know.  But I don't have any children so --
R:  Yeah, me either.
L:  -- I don't kn- I don't know --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- what I would think on that if I had children and, you know, per se wanting -- you know, whether or not I wanted them to, uh, hear something or read something, so, I don't know.  But I, you know, not being in that position.
R:  I think there's maybe a few things I wouldn't want my kids exposed to.  I once, uh, worked in a -- in the library in junior high and found a book on hunting, and I didn't think that was appropriate!  [LAUGH]
L:  Sure.
R:  Th- the kids my age, what was I, sixth grade, learn how to kill animals.  So I removed the book from the library!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay!
R:  So I was practising my own censorship.
L:  Yes, you were practising your own.
R:  In the sixth grade.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's interesting.
R:  But, you know --
L:  So, so-
R:  [MN]
L:  Should, you know, should they remove that then, should it have been removed?  Other than you removing it?
R:  I, uh  I think so.
L:  Right.  And what else then?  You said you had a couple of things that you think you would censor?
R:  Oh, uh
