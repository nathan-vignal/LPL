L:  Hi, my name is Bree.
R:  I'm Orville.
L:  Was that Marville?
R:  Orville.
L:  Hi, how you doing?
R:  Oh, I'm fine.
L:  [COUGH] And, uh, do you agree with this topic?
R:  I -- you know, uh, somewhat I do.
L:  I -- I believe that it shouldn't be televised due to the fact that I know in most cases it's not true, but these people are presumed innocent.  And if they are innocent there's actually someone out there that's guilty and they're getting to see all the information we have about them.
R:  Yeah, that's right, too.
L:  And, um, you know, it -- there's things that only the person that did it would know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's information they're releasing possibly out there to someone.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Do you agree with that?
R:  I agree.
L:  Good.  And how old are you?
R:  I am sixty three.
L:  Sixty three.  I'm twenty six.
R:  Way out[?].
L:  [LAUGH] I'm in Oklahoma and, um, we recently -- not recently, but in the past years, I can remember we, um, you know, we had the Oklahoma City memorial bombing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, we -- the high profile of Timothy McVeigh, and they showed a lot of information on there, you know, everything was televised and everybody knew everything, and that's just not safe because at that point they didn't know if he had done it by himself or if there were other people out there.
R:  That's true.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  And I watched the O.J. Simpson trial, too.
L:  That was another big one, yeah.
R:  Yes.
L:  But then again, you know, it -- it may be a good thing because you -- you get to learn information about these type of people --
R:  The court system and all that.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh, and might not otherwise learn some of the information that they give out.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And what part of the country are you located in?
R:  Oh, I'm in S- Springfield, Illinois.
L:  Illinois.
R:  Lincoln's -- Abe Lincoln's hometown.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I've -- I've never been out that way before.
R:  And it's snowing today.
L:  Oh, no. [LAUGH] We're wearing shorts. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] [COUGH]
R:  It was seventy last Monday.
L:  Oh, wow.  Crazy weather, huh?
R:  Yes.
L:  Is this the -- the first, um, study that you've done?
R:  Yes.
L:  Me too. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, uh, what other -- what other, um, ideas do you have about being for or against the trials?
R:  Oh, I -- you know, I'm kind of doing -- kind of one way and two the other.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause we --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think they make kind of a big to do out of some of the stuff.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The media does.
L:  Yes. [PAUSE] [inaudible].  Well, there's not a whole lot to say on this topic. [LAUGH]
R:  No.  Okay.
L:  Um, have you ever been called for jury duty?
R:  No, I have not.
L:  Would you?  If you were called would you?
R:  I probably would go.
L:  I think that that would be interesting.
R:  I wouldn't have a choice.
L:  Yeah, I guess, yeah.  Once -- once they call you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, I've -- I've never been called, but I think it would be something really interesting to see.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, I don't know how this works.  Does it just cut off in ten minutes?
R:  I don't know either.
L:  You don't know either?
R:  No.
L:  You're new like me. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, we're new -- we're both new.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, I've -- I've had a couple of calls and I haven't accepted 'em yet 'cause I was too nervous. [LAUGH] But I finally did today.
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  [COUGH] But being -- being, um, fairly young, I -- I haven't seen a lot or been involved a lot in -- in anything like that, trials or had to go to anything like that.
R:  No, see, another thing from the -- about these trials, my nephew was in Iowa, and he was brutally stabbed.  He was twenty one years old.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  They stabbed him forty times --
L:  [MN]
R:  Forced him to open the safe in the convenience store and all that --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and, uh, that's why I kind of -- and they never did catch the guy.
L:  Never even caught him.
R:  No, but two of the prime suspects committed suicide.
L:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH]
R:  But they will get him in the end.
L:  Yeah.  That's scary.
R:  If not here, up -- up above.
L:  Yeah.  Well, you know, I know a -- a lot of people like to see this, maybe they're not family --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just, you know, some way associated with it but can't be there, would like to see it, you know, televised on TV, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that may be -- maybe they should have certain closed circuit, you know, where if you go through --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- a certain process, you can watch it.  But another thing is they show that on just a regular channel.  I know here we've got a -- a channel where you can always go and watch some kind of trial.  And my children could turn to that, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have two young children that flip through the cartoons all the time.
R:  How old are they?
L:  And at any point they could stop and, you know, hear 'em talking about murder and sex and rape and crime and ...
R:  How old are your kids?
L:  They are two and a half and six.
R:  Oh, the good age. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know.  I think every age has its perks, but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] They all have their downs, too.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] No, they -- they are at a really good age, but they are at an age where they ask a lot of questions and they're --
R:  Yes, that's right.
L:  -- very observant as to what's going on.  You know, especially, like, all the war that's going on right now.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think they televise way too much, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Let us know what's going on.  Let us be aware and prepared for what we need to be, but don't show us every single thing about every person that's been killed, and it causes a lot of depression for people and stuff.  They -- they -- they really should be a lot -- a lot more censored in a lot of things.  Not just trials, but war and criminal on the news.
R:  Yeah, the war.
L:  [LAUGH] [COUGH]
R:  I hope this -- you know, talking about war, I hope that they get Saddam this time and end this one over in Iraq.
L:  Oh, yes.  I --
R:  Not have another one like we did twelve years ago.
L:  Yeah.  I was in junior high --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when that happened, and I remember it plain and I -- and now that I'm old enough to understand and realize I said, "Why didn't they get him the first time?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "Why are we doing this again?"  Did -- let me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] You know, what's -- something's wrong in this situation. [LAUGH] [COUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have a -- a brother in the military, and we're just waiting and sitting every day just knowing he's gonna get called.
R:  Yeah.  Just hopefully he don't get -- get called.  But if he does, he's for his -- it's for his country.
L:  Yeah.  Like, my mom says, "He knew what he was getting into when he signed up". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... [COUGH] Well, they -- um ...
R:  I think we've  said our ten minutes, haven't we?
L:  [LAUGH] La la la la la. [LAUGH] I -- I've, um, had some interesting topics.  I had -- had one on smoking and something else, but I was -- I was just not so sure if you can talk on something for ten minutes.  You may think, "Oh, that's not very long". [LAUGH] When you get to talking and say --
R:  Yeah, I know. [NOISE]
L:  -- everything you have to say -- was that a beep?
R:  No, that's -- I got a police scanner.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] So, do you, uh, do you do secret shopping, too?
R:  No, I don't.
L:  You don't?
R:  I read email quite a bit.
L:  Oh, I see.  Well, I do --
R:  But there's not much money in that.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I -- I do these kind of things to stay home with my children, so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  It gets me through that. [LAUGH]
R:  Do you get paid good for ea- -- for secret shopping?
L:  Um, yes.  A lot of them can be good.  A lot of times you get, um, dinners, free dinners, free movies, you know.  Um, [COUGH] I go to retail stores all the time and just check out the cleanliness and stuff and get paid for it.
R:  And then you get the money back, huh?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh.
L:  And it -- it can start -- I mean, it's anywhere from eight to thirty, forty, fifty dollars, you know, for something that may take you ten minutes to an hour at the most.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Can't beat that.  Plus I get to take my kids with me, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH] Do you have children?
R:  No, I -- I live with my sister.  We're -- I'm on disability and she won't let me live alone because I have a heart that takes off and beats a little bit fast.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  I blacked out three times in one month.
L:  Oh, wow, that sounds dangerous.
R:  But now I've -- I've got it settled down, so I've got a pacemaker defibrillator put in and ...
L:  Mm. [COUGH]
R:  But I still have to take it easy. [PAUSE] Are you there? [PAUSE] Huh.
L:  Hello?  Can you hear me?
R:  They cut me off. [PAUSE]
L:  I guess the ten minutes is over.  Thank you.
