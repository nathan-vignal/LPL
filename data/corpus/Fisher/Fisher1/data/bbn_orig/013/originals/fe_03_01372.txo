L:  Hi.  This is Tammy.
R:  Hi, I'm Tom.
L:  Tom?
R:  Yes.  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  [MN] Er, who am I speaking with?
L:  This is Tammy.
R:  Oh, Pa- Pammy?
L:  No, Tammy.  T.A.M.M.Y.
R:  Pam- -- okay, P.A.M.M.Y., Pammy.  Okay, um, I guess -- okay, I guess our topic is wha- whether they can read, whether [several inaudible words] books should be censored and not allowed to read certain books -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- in schools.
L:  Yeah. [COUGH]
R:  So I -- so I guess, uh -- yeah, I mean, it's, um, -- I mean I think certain, I mean [inaudible] [NOISE] for the, uh, younger grades, you know, I feel strongly that there are certain books that aren't appropriate, you know, for kids.  It's, uh, hard to say who, um, you know, who should do the censoring, you know.  [SIGH] I mean --
L:  Yes, it does.  I do have two kids and -- and it's hard sometimes when you go over there and some topics I don't think should be for kids in elementary, not yet, you know.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  But it -- but it's hard, you know, your opinions sometimes you go and tell them and then [MN] I don't think they agree with that, but I think a lot -- a lot of the books I agree that they are fine.
R:  Ahah.
L:  My boys usually come home with a book and, you know, some of the books -- and like one was like Lord of the Flies.  I didn't even like the book myself -- 
R:  Ahah. [COUGH]
L:  -- but my son was supposed to read that book.
R:  Ahah.
L:  I don't know if you ever heard of that book.  It's --
R:  Um, yeah, I've heard of it, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Tha- tha- tha- and there's, um, you know, the -- a lot of these Harry Potter books people, um, ah, [several inaudible words] that kind of stuff.
L:  Yeah.  I did read the books before I let my son, my oldest one read it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  I usually do that, to a point. 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think.  Yeah, I think that's important, yeah, because it's, um, [several inaudible words] I mean, they are very [several inaudible words] you know, television shows, you know, where there's a lot of stuff that, uh -- 
L:  Yes, that's true.
R:  -- you know, I -- I don't think they should be watching.  You know, I won't even -- I won't even have [NOISE] cable, you know, in the house just 'cause, you know, I have young kids and, uh, you know, I just -- you know, even with just the three networks or four networks now, you know and [NOISE] I'm, uh -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I agree --  
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  I agree with that because I -- I went to the point that even buying one of those TVs that have a V. chip -- 
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- because some of the stuff they are on TV is unbelievable.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You know.  I got niece over here and I was watching the cartoon and it's all about their behinds. 
R:  Ahah. [NOISE]
L:  [several inaudible words] you know, me about that and, uh, to the point that I just make sure that I know what time it is [COUGH] -- excuse me -- so she's now watching that, you know.  It's just -- it's -- it's scary what kids get their hands into.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know, at this point and it's just like, you know, nobody pay attention.
R:  Yeah.  [inaudible]
L:  I was -- 
R:  Yeah.  You know, I mean -- well, I'll tell you what worries me the most, though, you know, is like, um, like the internet stuff, you know. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean I'm -- I'm constantly, you know, putting in, you know, putting in, uh, you know, something, searching for just anything, you know, on the internet.  [NOISE] Usually you get these, ah, pornographic sites, you know, that come up and stuff and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it just worries me to pieces, you know, that my [NOISE] my daughters use that. [NOISE] 
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, [NOISE] [several inaudible words] one of those sites, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Yes, that's true.  
R:  So -- 
L:  I -- my -- my two boys have computers and they get to go to the internet but I, uh, we, uh -- my husband and I are computer programmers so we put software in there so we know where they're at. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we can tell, we can go in through my computer and I can tell exactly where he's going and what he's saying and if it's unappropriate what he -- where he is or where he's gone, he's out of it.
R:  Ahah.
L:  You know, I take the cord and I, "Sorry, you can just play with your computer, you can't go up to the internet because where you do, what you -- where you went, knowingly that you went there, it's unappropriate".
R:  Ahah.  Yes.
L:  And, you know, and if he mess up with the computer, try to get my software out, then he's out of the, you know, the internet for a while, because, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you have to trust them, but they -- if they don't follow what you say, then they lose it.
R:  Yeah.  [several inaudible words]
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  Yeah.  Well, my kids are young enough now that they're [several inaudible words] [NOISE] research and stuff, you know.  That will happen in the next few years, though, but right now I'm just a little afraid that accidentally, you know, accidentally she's going to [NOISE] click on something, you know, and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [several inaudible words] spam email they send out now.  I mean, I got an email the other day, you know, and I clicked on it and, uh, it had -- it had pictures in it -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, pornographic pictures and that just came in right in an email, you know.
L:  Yes.
R:  -- yeah, but she's [several inaudible words] protected account that's through AOL that's not supposed to -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, be able to have that.
L:  I get a lot of those, a lot of those, [MN] to the point that now, you know, I -- if I don't know who it is, I don't even click on it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because I have found that, you know, a lot of these sites are just unbelievable, like, you know, like, I -- you know, "I'm your friend", you know, "I haven't talked to you for a while" and -- and you start thinking, "Really?" Is there somebody that haven't talked and you click and it's some kind of site that --  and then it pop up all over the place.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You try to close it [LAUGH] you can't do anything.
R:  [inaudible] Yeah.
L:  So it's just unbelievable.  I ended up even sometimes, ah, last week I -- I, uh, deleted some -- some of those emails on the e- -- I deleted things that I shouldn't have deleted, they were mine, you know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because I was so frustrated that I just started deleting everything without even reading it, it's like, great.
R:  Ahah.  [NOISE] Yeah, well, yeah.  I mean, it's, um, [NOISE] I mean it's a real problem, you know, and yeah, like, um, ah, [NOISE] and viruses, you know, [NOISE] that come around now that, uh, you know, people, [LAUGH] you know, they, uh -- you know, the viruses are smart enough to pick up email accounts, you know, and just prol- proliferate all over the place, you know, and send out [inaudible] so, yeah, you're afraid to even open them sometimes.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, it- it's so unbelievable of what you have to go through just to keep your kids safe for what -- you know, different stuff, what they read, what they see, so they don't, you know -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get into that pattern.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, my boy sometimes -- 
R:  Yeah.  I try to be -- I try to be very, uh, you know, very involved in on what they're -- what they're reading, you know.  I try to -- try to know what they are doing [NOISE] because, uh, yeah, I mean that's very -- very worried[?] to me now and then, uh, you get worried about, uh -- you know, I mean, it's not -- they're -- well, they -- well, according to the commercials on TV I guess they're not even too young to talk about drugs and we do, you know, talk about it and, you know, try not -- try to let them know, you know, that that's not okay and [MN].  I mean, they're -- I -- I think a little -- I mean they're too young, uh, I think to, uh, y- you know, really be real interested in it but I want to make sure that they at least have negative feelings about it ahead of time, you know.
L:  Yeah, it is [inaudible].  I like that.  My parents did not talk to me.  I didn't went that route, anyway, but it still, you know, I -- I -- I feel that they should have, they should have told me --
R:  Ahah.
L:  You know, so now with my boys I try to make sure that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the things that were not told to me are told -- told to him, you know, to them, in a certain time in their, you know, level of maturity.  I talk to them about drugs to a point, you know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and other stuff because they, you know, now they are teenagers, so they will [NOISE] find it out there, they will see it out there and I would rather tell them myself than them find out by themself what is out there.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, mine are pre-teenagers, yeah.  I don't have [several inaudible words] stuff, so, [NOISE] you know, it's a -- I've got a [NOISE] little while, you know, maybe before [inaudible] too much of that stuff but, you know, I'm still, uh, yeah, still very, uh, very [inaudible], you know, and trying to make sure that, uh, you know, they're not getting into things they are not supposed.
L:  Yeah, and sometimes my youngest one's like, "Well, my friends' parents are", you know, "They do this and they do that" and I said, "Well, that's their choice, but in my house it's different" -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, "You can't, just because your friends get to go and see this disgusting movie, you know, I'm not going to do the same thing, because I feel that that is not appropriate for a child your age".
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, so I [inaudible] get that and he -- you know, my oldest one, because he's seventeen, he gets to [MN] see --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- different movies sometimes, uh, you know, than my youngest one and he complains about that and I said, "Well, when [inaudible] when you get older then you get the same as he did, little by little you get a bit of more stuff that you can see and you can read and, you know, appropriate to your age --" 
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- but at this time, no".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- a little bit of a fight, but [SIGH] somebody has to do it, I guess, you know, better be me.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, well -- [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I help in -- I help in, uh, [COUGH] in the library sometimes so I get to see, like, the books that they have in there and what book they rejected and, you know, I'm -- I do- --  I ask the librarian in my kids' school to give me a list of what books they need for the library -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I kind of have an idea, you know -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what books they take into the school because I buy some of the books --
R:  [NOISE]
L:   -- to donate to the library, so that's a -- kind of
