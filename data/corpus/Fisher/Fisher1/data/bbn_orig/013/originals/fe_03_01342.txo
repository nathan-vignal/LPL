R:  Hi, I'm Zohrab.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Um, my name is Terry.
R:  Sorry, what's --
L:  Ah, did you hear what the topic was?
R:  Yes, censorship.
L:  Ah, yeah, and then she said, ah, something about, ah, something in the public schools.  
R:  Oh, right. 
L:  Do we think they have the right to do something.
R:  Um.
L:  Did you hear what that was? [LAUGH]
R:  No, I -- I -- I actually didn't because I've got lots of things going on here at the same time right now.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Okay, what's your name again? 
R:  Zohrab.
L:  Doug?
R:  Zohrab.
L:  Can you spell it? 
R:  Yes, Z.O.H.R.A.B. [PAUSE]
L:  Okay, well -- 
R:  What's your name?
L:  My name is Terry, T.E.R.R.Y.
R:  Terry, nice to meet you, Terry.
L:  Same here.
R:  So what, um -- 
L:  I don't know.  What we talk -- I guess we talk about, ah, ah, censorship in the public schools.  I guess I would be talking about, ah, dress or prayer or, ah, I wish I'd heard 'em.
R:  Yeah, I mean -- what I guess -- 
L:  There was no way to, ah, -- 
R:  To hear them again? 
L:  To get them again, to ask 'em what it -- what it was.
R:  No, I'm not sure, this is my first, ah, call, so I don't really know much about it.
L:  Yeah, yeah, this is my first one too.  They -- ah, actually, ah, I didn't know they had accepted me.
R:  Right.
L:  Did you?
R:  No.
L:  Okay, okay.  [LAUGH] Well, somebody fell down there, didn't they? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I guess.
L:  Okay.  What do you think about censorship in public schools?  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, well, I -- I have two different thoughts on it I guess.  That's -- um, depends on what, ah, the topic is, ah, but I have mixed feelings on whether religion should be censored or versus, I guess, science, and then there's also fiction and, um, depending on content, but I also have feelings on -- on, what, um -- who gets to decide what's censored.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I do too.
R:  Yeah, so -- 
L:  Ah, personally, ah, ah, just my opinion of course but --
R:  Yes.
L:  But, ah, I -- I was sorry when they removed the prayer from the schools.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think if you're allowed to have a choice then it should be your choice to be able to pray, not to just not pray. 
R:  Right.
L:  They removed the -- it seemed like to me they removed the choice from the people that wanted to pray.  They no longer have choice. 
R:  They no longer have what?
L:  You know, it -- it seemed like they removed the choice from the people that wanted to have prayer.  Ah, they no longer had a choice.  It just -- 
R:  Right.
L:  No prayer.
R:  What was the -- and what prayer do you mean, the morning prayer?
L:  Yeah.  You know, I -- I understand that, that, ah, different cultures have different, ah, religions in different -- ah, well, I can't think of a word there -- ah, object that they pray to.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And maybe they could just have, ah, a couple of minutes of silent time.  You could either say to yourself what you wanted to or not say what you wanted to. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  I understand that everybody doesn't -- isn't, ah, a protestant or a Catholic and everybody doesn't say the Lord's Prayer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I think that things got worse in the school when they stopped doing all that.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  In my opinion.
R:  Yeah, I'm not sure.  Um, well, as I guess --
L:  But my children are older and so they were in school when the prayers were stopped so -- 
R:  Right.
L:  So there was some years of their schooling that they did say the prayer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- 
R:  Well, I -- I grew up in school in saying the prayer, um, every day but I -- um, but I'm not Christian and so it didn't really make sense to me.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I was saying this prayer that I didn't know about, anything about and so and -- 
L:  You probably didn't appreciate being forced to say something that you didn't --
R:  Yeah, I didn't -- I was pretty young so I didn't really know that I was being forced and if I -- I mean, if I -- if I didn't want to, I wouldn't participate.  I would just stand there and say nothing, but I didn't really know what it meant.
L:  Well, you know, it's funny because I'm a Catholic and grew up Catholic and in the Lord's Prayer, we don't say the last part of it, Catholics, "For thine is the kingdom", you know, that part of it? 
R:  Right.
L:  And so when the other people around me would be saying that, I would just be silent. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it never bothered me that they said a different prayer than -- I didn't really say a different prayer, I just omitted the end of it.
R:  Right, but by keeping -- by keeping that prayer in there -- 
L:  I'm like you.
R:  -- they are kind of not really -- they're only catering to the Christians.
L:  Yeah, they were only catering to Protestants and I didn't raise [inaudible] about it, you know.
R:  But, I mean, but, I mean, you had the option of not saying the last bit, but for me none of it made sense to me.  So -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know, to me it makes more sense for them to take it out because, you know, there may be a lot of people that are not Christian or whatever and they don't or they don't believe in any religion or they don't say -- they don't say prayers so, um, maybe they should have a moment of silence for everybody or maybe they should have a, ah, -- maybe they should have a -- everyone gets a headset and gets to pick your own prayer or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Give them a choice.  I don't know.  But, ah, it makes -- it doesn't make sense to me that they can have -- choose one prayer for everybody.
L:  Well, yeah, that's true.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, of course, back when I was going to school, it was a long time ago and -- and we didn't really consider, ah, a lot of rights of other people. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Including -- including this is our prayer so you're going to say it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, yeah, you -- you make a valid point there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, I just -- to me it just -- you know, I just -- I just really hated for 'em to take it out.  It -- it seemed like, well, I just don't know if --
R:  So, um, you seem to agree to -- agree with me when you say that it doesn't make sense for them to have the prayer in there because it doesn't make -- it doesn't pertain to everybody.
L:  Yeah, it doesn't pertain to everybody.
R:  But you also want -- you didn't -- you seemed -- you're saying it's a shame that they took it out?  So you'd like to have a different option that they --
L:  I'm kind of divided, yeah.  I'd like to have -- like I said earlier, maybe, ah, an option where everybody would get together, I don't -- I don't know how it was in your school, but in mine we all gathered in the auditorium.
R:  Right.
L:  And, ah, they said the Pledge of Allegiance and the morning prayer. 
R:  Right.
L:  And, ah, maybe they could just gather -- all gather in there and just have a couple of moments of, ah, silence.
R:  Right.
L:  And, ah, reflect upon peace or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Instead of a prayer, maybe peace or -- or, ah, caring about one another.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  That's a good idea, yeah, respecting each other.  I mean, that would be -- that would go a long way.
L:  Yeah, yeah, it would. 
R:  Yeah.  So, um, yeah, I guess for us it was, ah, -- we were just in our -- in our classrooms in the morning and it would be announced over the PA system the prayer, so, ah, -- 
L:  Yeah, my children, ah, when they were, ah, going to school I think that's how they did it.
R:  Right.
L:  Just in -- in the classroom.
R:  Ahah, so what part of, ah, -- what, ah, -- where are you calling from or where are you connected from? 
L:  Houston, ah, Houston, Texas.
R:  Houston, oh, yeah.
L:  Where are you? 
R:  I'm in, ah, in Canada, in Toronto.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Cool. 
R:  Yeah.  So, ah, um, I guess, ah, what other kind of censorships are there?  I mean, there's -- for me, I'm -- I can think of, um, when I -- when I think of the word censorship I think of, ah, you know, some large companies like Indigo or Chapters or large book companies that are, um, censoring things because they decide not to carry something and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the big come -- the big book stores that they -- that they get to, you know, they -- they, ah, wipe out a lot of the small companies and then the small companies would have been around to serve the smaller markets where they, you know, those books are not -- where those, you know, where those books are, people need those books but then if Chapters is taking over for all those small companies [NOISE] and they're cornering more of the market then they get to decide who gets what, and pretty soon, you know, they'll be -- they'll be deciding what books we read, and I'm sure it translates to the school too, they won't, ah, -- if they don't, ah, -- they don't like something, to censor -- 
L:  They've been doing -- they've been doing that for years, censoring books in schools.
R:  Sorry?
L:  Weren't -- weren't they in your school? 
R:  Weren't they doing what?
