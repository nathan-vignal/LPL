R:  Hello. 
L:  This is Jay.
R:  Hi Jade, this is Laura.
L:  Hi, Laura, how's it going?
R:  Good.  Is this your first call?
L:  Uh, yes, it is.
R:  Ooh.  This is my second one [LAUGH], so --
L:  Did they ask you to put in a code?
R:  Ah, you know, I -- my husband answered it and I, ah, -- so I'm guessing they may have asked the code but he didn't put it in, if they asked for it.
L:  Right.  I didn't put in a code either.  I was just wondering.  Well, the topic of the day is --
R:  Do we exercise.
L:  Well -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] That's something that's on -- been on my to do list for about a year -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, you know, when I was in the military, you know, I was used to, you know, working out all the time, of course, but once I got out of the military I just kind of slacked off, but I always tell myself I'm going to get -- I'm -- I'm starting back running or I'm, you know, I'm going to the gym.  I need to, you know, [several inaudible words] muscles, you know, but I haven't got around to doing it and, I don't know. [MN]
R:  I always say that I'm going to, but, you know, it's, like, I go to the gym about, oh, three or four times and then that's about it and something -- you know, it's, like, life just interferes with -- with -- you know, working out.
L:  Yeah, I mean -- 
R:  Every time I go to the doctor and they say, "Do you work out?"  and I say, "Well, I --  I have small children.  Does that count?" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] No, but -- yeah, I guess you can count that.  My, um, fiance is going through that right now with my little girl [LAUGH] and she -- that's the workout.
R:  It is.  Chasing those kids --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- up and down stairs and everything else.  I still keep saying that I'm going to join a gym, but, um, but my husband doesn't want me to join it because he knows that it will be a waste of money.
L:  [LAUGH]. Well, you can prove him wrong. [several inaudible words] 
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I guess that'll make you do it, too.
R:  Yeah, that's o- -- well, let's see.  I bought a treadmill because I thought, well, if I don't have to go to the gym, I found a treadmill for sale at a garage sale for, like, forty bucks [LAUGH] and so I -- I bought that, but I still didn't exercise, even with the treadmill in the same house --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- as I did.
L:  Okay, so you've -- you've proven that you buy stuff and don't use it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yes. [LAUGH]  Oh, yes.  Mhm.
L:  Well, I guess we're all guilty of that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- but, yeah, I need to -- I want to -- I've got -- I'm developing a little tummy so I need -- of course I need to do some crunches and sit ups.  You know, that's something that you can do on your own, you know, at home.  You really don't need to join no club or -- it's just a -- it's a matter of doing it.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  Well, and it's -- it's hard to find time, you know.  By the time the end of the day gets here, it's like you're tired.
L:  Right.  You don't want to do nothing.
R:  I just want to sit in front of the TV and veg -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know.  It's like, "Oh, man", once eight o'clock comes I'm like, "That's it, I'm off duty". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You're clocking off [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's it, I'm clocking out at eight o'clock.  I mean, man, don't want to hear the word "Mom" or anything any more after that. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  But, um, bu- -- um, to be honest with you, after she had our baby, um, she went on a diet and she lost, you know, she looks good now, she lost all her weight, you know, her, um, you know, weight from her pregnancy, she lost all that -- 
R:  Oh, wow! 
L:  -- and she [several inaudible words] and, um, a -- a diet where I think the diet she couldn't eat any, um [LIPSMACK] -- eat -- I -- I forgot what her diet was all about, but, anyway, she did a good job whatever she did.  She got that weight off because that's all she was worried about was, you know, being able -- being able to fit back into her old clothes.
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  She got the [several inaudible words].  I did it with her one night and, man, that [inaudible] was no joke.
R:  That looks hard.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't think I could do that.  I couldn't -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't -- I don't have the stamina for that.
L:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK]
R:  Not at all. I always think I would like to take up swimming.  I think that would be a good --
L:  Swimming?
R:  Yeah, a good exercise, ah, but I'm also a big wimp so the pool has to be heated -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because I'm not swimming if it's cold.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I don't swim in the ocean and so it's like, yeah, that's probably never going to happen either.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Well -- 
R:  They say that, uh, like, you know, even horseback riding is good exercise, so sometimes I try and get out and do that, bu --
L:  Who?
R:  I think if you just -- if you don't do something on a regular basis, just doing it once in a while, I guess it doesn't really help at all.
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I guess you either need to do it, you know, or not do it, but -- and so mostly I don't do it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, how old is the baby?
L:  Um, the baby is eight months.  She'll be nine months on the thirty first.
R:  Oh, okay.  Boy, that's pretty good.  It took me -- it took me a number of months to lose my -- my baby weight and get back in my jeans. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, so [MN] that's what I was saying.  She did good, she was committed.  That was all she was worried about, got to get this weight off.
R:  Oh.
L:  She was committed to doing that and she did it.  Now, if I could commit myself to, uh, losing my little tummy and gaining a little muscle, a little buff -- buffness. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  I know -- it's like I could  -- I could use to, you know, tone up a little bit.  I don't necessarily need to lose weight, but I certainly could use some toning. [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  I- I've hit forty and I've noticed that I'm not near as toned as I used to be.  Used to be I didn't have to work out and I stayed, you know, fairly toned -- 
L:  [NOISE] Right.  Right.
R:  -- but not any more.  My big problem is it's just the commitment, is just making the commitment.
L:  Right.
R:  They say if you can do it like thirty days in a row, then it becomes a habit, but, um, I, ah, I've never done it for thirty days in a row. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I've done it for thirty days in a row and it wasn't a habit for me.  That's like [MN] when I was in the military I was, you know, always working out -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- but now, you know, got a job, living out in the suburbs, you know, and like you say, after you get home you just want to relax. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you know, and then it's like, you know, by the time you mow the lawn and do -- it's like, "That's it, that's all the workout, you know, I can stand".  I'm trying to think what else I've done to try to get myself to, you know, at least be committed to some sort of exercise, because I'm sure that I've tried a number of things, but I'm not coordinated enough for any of those aerobics or step classes.  I, like, trip over my own feet.
L:  I've done that before but the place -- I was doing it at this place they called Running Shoe and they have all these basketball courts, but in the mornings they have like aerobics, so I was going with a co-worker of mine out there and, um, it was too far, you know, way out of the way for me to go out there in the mornings, you know, five thirty and -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- get up, go out there, then you have to drive all the way to work, you know.  I have to take a shower, of course, afterwards, so it was just too much.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I probably could have found something else closer to work.  I guess I -- always when I was going out there was because my co-worker invited me out there.
R:  My husband -- now, y- -- you mentioned basketball.  Now, my, husband he tries to get out like with the guys, you know, and at least play some basketball and stuff like that to at least help keep in shape.  That's always a good thing.
L:  That's one of my, uh, favorite sports to play, the basketball.
R:  Is it?  Well, that's good exercise, then.
L:  Yes, but -- but, like you say, it's a matter of doing it. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah, ahah.  Yeah, doing it once every six months doesn't really count as, you know, [LAUGH] as an exercise regime.
L:  Right.
R:  We- -- of course, you know, they used to say if you just did something three days a week.  Now -- I -- I was reading that now they're saying it's like if you really want to be healthy, you're supposed to exercise five days a week.  I'm like, "Oh, man, I could never exercise five days a week.  
L:  [MN]
R:  That's just way too much for me".  I mean I could remotely maybe get one or two days, but I could never get five days.  So, I just run up and down the stairs in my house chasing after kids and dogs and anything else that works its way inside. 
L:  [MN]
R:  And I call that my exercise. 
L:  [LAUGH] I heard that, yeah, we all need to go for that.
R:  Yeah, I know.  I figure I got a three story house, it takes me a while to run up and down stairs.  [LAUGH] I'm like, "Oh, got to go to the basement.  Okay, I'll run down the stairs".  You know, they say, too, that what you should do is, like, when you go grocery shopping or go to the mall -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- you should, instead of parking closest, park the furtherest away so that that way you at least get a little bit of, you know, exercise walking through the parking lot to go to the mall or [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or whatever.
L:  [MN] Yes, [NOISE] it sounds logical.
R:  Yeah.  I had a girlfriend who did that.  I mean, she took every -- you know, it's like she didn't necessarily get to the gym a lot --
