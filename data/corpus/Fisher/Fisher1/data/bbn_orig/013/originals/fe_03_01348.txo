L:  My name is Tracey.
R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, hi, my name is Lisa.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  What are we supposed to do [LAUGH]?
R:  Um, we are supposed to talk about, I think they said whether, um --
L:  [NOISE] About --
R:  -- whether sc- --
L:  -- private schools can --
R:  -- school can require children to read certain books.
L:  Right.
R:  Right.
L:  If they can censor them.  Is that what it was?
R:  Oh, I thought it was whether they can require them to read certain ones.
L:  Oh.  We can do both [LAUGH].
R:  Okay [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That sounds good to me.  What do you think?
L:  Um, I mean, I think required reading is a good way to get them to read.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and as long as it's, you know, an- -- as long as they're just like the classics or just, you know, things that are going to further their education, I don't have any kind of problem with that, however, um, censoring I don't think that they have the right to do that, I think that, you know, if we've got freedom of speech, they should have freedom to read whatever's been written.
R:  I agree.  I agree.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I think that, um, it ties into --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, the whole separating the church and the state --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and, um, you know, even if it's a private school, I think you just have to have faith in the educational system that you've elected for your children to be a part of and sort of trust those educators that they are picking material that's educational and informative, um, you know, because they're -- because some people go uh just real far with the censorship stuff.
L:  I agree.
R:  So [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  So, we agree on that [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  No, I'm not one to censor anything, so, um, I think they gave us like ten minutes to talk about this, so I don't know --
R:  I know.
L:  -- what else there is to talk about.
R:  No, I to- -- no, I totally agree.  I, um, and I believe in -- in, you know, freedom of speech and I think you're right, it ties into that and, um, [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah, I don't believe in any of the book burnings or -- you know, and they feel like Tom Sawyer is, you know, not good or whatever, it's you know, what, w- -- everyone has rea- -- you know, it's all been read in the past and the kids are exposed to so much more these days that you know what they're going to find in some of these books is not going to [LAUGH] be the worst of it.
R:  Oh absolut- -- oh, absolutely.  Oh, my gosh, that's so true.  I mean, they are exposed to so much more, so much younger and some places I think, um, censor Harry Potter.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that actually I, um, have a teacher friend who [SIGH] ah, one of the pare- -- she was reading it to the class and one of the parents had a problem with it because of some of the --
R:  Imagery.
L:  -- some of the things, you know, the wizardry, yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  And I was like, give me a break, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- these kids are just reading it for enjoyment, they're not going to, you know --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So ... um --
R:  W- -- I -- how old are y- -- are your children?
L:  I just have a one year old.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But mine's not even in school [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, okay [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, well, um, you know, it's -- it's interesting because having said all that, I do -- I have a thirteen year old and an eleven year old --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, um, my thirteen is at an age, they both have always liked to read, but my thirteen year old's at an age --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- being thirteen, being, you know, pre adolescent where he just, you know, has his own little set of ideas --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and reading is not cool right now --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but -- but yet --
L:  But he'll still read Harry Potter.
R:  -- Harry -- well, but that's the only thing that he'll read.
L:  Right.  So, you're not going to discourage that because he's reading.
R:  No.  Not at all.  I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I wouldn't discourage it anyway, but, you know, what if -- what if it hadn't been allowed or --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Um, um -- but I will say, um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- there's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that -- that I feel like I should have some control over what my kids read, um, in fact this past weekend my daughter's been [inaudible] library and she wanted to read the Lovely Bones --
L:  Oh, no, I don't know that.
R:  -- and that's an adult book -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that's, ah --
L:  But it was in the library?
R:  -- um, yeah, well, no, not the school library.
L:  Was it in the school?  Not the school library?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  This was actually a public library.
L:  Well, yeah, that I agree, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, in fifth grade I -- I remember, you know, we were all like, oh, let's read that Forever book by Judy Bloom, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because it had like, it talked about sex and what not and, you know, that w- -- I think that was in the school library --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I was in fifth grade.  Now, that, you know, but you know what, if you're curious and it's like you better -- you kind of want them to know rather than, ah, stumble upon, you know, you -- I don't know, or you'd rather them ask you, I guess --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- any questions like that.  But.
R:  But sometimes, um --
L:  But, yeah, I believe parents do have the right to say --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- "You know what, you're not old enough yet" but not say, you know, I don't think that they should say, yes, but this is bad because it's going to, you know, it's wizardry and it's, you know, they're going to -- the Devil, or whatever it is.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And that I don't agree with.  But I -- I mean, yes, every parent's got the right to, you know, rule over --
R:  Choose on their own.
L:  -- their children until they're eighteen.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  No --
L:  So.
R:  -- I -- I so agree and -- and honestly, just -- just about, I mean with exceptions on adult topics for certain kids who just aren't ready to handle it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, anytime you can get a child to read anything, it's just -- and especially if -- if, you know, you read it with them, like I'm sure you're doing right now with your one year old --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, but that just continues -- it opens up an avenue for discussion, you know --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- if you -- if you read it together.  Or even if you don't read it together, if you kind of know what's going on in the book and it brings up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- things that they'll talk to you about --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, it doesn't really matter to me what level it's at because I'd rather them hear anything and everything from me first --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and if there is a topic in a book that --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- you know, I may be uncomfortable with, I'd still rather they bring it up with me --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- than anybody else, so --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- um, anyway [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  So, now, does someone like read this -- someone listen to our conversation and then use that to --
R:  I don't know -- I have no idea --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- this is the first one I've done.  Have you done --
L:  Me too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  This is the first one I've done.
R:  Yeah.  And did you find out for it a while ago?
L:  Yes.  And I -- it was funny, I was just thinking, "Gosh, you know, I never got anything about that" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- "I never got a call" --
R:  No, ah, because I remember I signed up for it, um, during my kids' spring break, which was actually like a month ago --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, and I thought, well, I guess I just missed it [LAUGH] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but, um, I don't know what happens from here.
L:  Yeah, no, and I guess -- it said something about ten minutes, so I guess after ten -- let me see what my phone says --
R:  I wonder if they, um --
L:  Oh, it's only been, it's not even eight minutes yet since I answered the phone --
R:  It's not even eight minutes?
L:  Not since I even answered --
R:  Well, I wonder if, um, um, I wonder if they try to match people from different areas of [MN] --
L:  Well, when I -- I -- you know, they asked me a bunch of questions and I punched in and they said let's find another participant, so maybe, or that was just what kind of phone am I on.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had that, too.  But, um --
L:  So --
R:  -- because I live --
L:  -- I don't know if they come back on or you're just supposed to -- I don't know.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Be done with it [LAUGH].
R:  I don't know.  I guess we'll wait for ten minutes and see.
L:  Right.  So, where do you live?
R:  Well, I live in Texas.
L:  So do I.
R:  You do?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, I bet that, um, this is more of an issue in Texas [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, you're right.  Where are you?
R:  I'm in Dallas.
L:  Oh, so am I.  In [inaudible].
R:  Oh, you are?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  Well, I'm -- I'm in University Park.
L:  Okay [LAUGH].
R:  Well, that's interesting.  I would have thought that --
L:  It is interesting.
R:  -- they might have gotten people from different parts of the country because, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there -- there might be some discrepancy --
L:  Yeah, I mean, I can understand that here, you know, just being in the midst of the bible belt and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and [inaudible] now --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- it's definitely a bigger issue probably here than like up north where they're just, you know, it's more liberal.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Um.  You know, as the -- as the general thing, you know, I feel like I'm kind of liberal, but, you know, I'm sure that I'm probably in the minority here for that.
R:  Well, I think when it comes to people's rights, I'm definitely more on the liberal side, too and [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  So, you're --
R:  -- and you know what, this -- this definitely is the bible belt and we had people that our elementary school, we had to stop calling it halloween parties, we had --
L:  Oh [SIGH].
R:  -- had to call it like fall parties because --
L:  Well, the [inaudible] schools don't even allow them to celebrate halloween.
R:  Isn't that silly?
L:  It's so si- -- I mean, it's, you know, it's taking away all the -- the freedom and the fun -- you know, it's just -- the kids aren't the no -- All Hallow's Eve, who cares, they're just going to dress up and get some candy.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I think it's --
R:  It's totally blown out of proportion and --
L:  I agree -- I -- 
R:  -- it's just an extension of the book thing and, um, you know, I'm one of those little rebels who quite honestly if they censored a book I'd probably just go out and buy it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it would make me [LAUGH] just like my teenager, it would make me want to go out and buy it --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and read it.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And say, well what is it in here that, you know, they don't want me to see. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, anyway --
L:  Are your kids in private school here?
R:  No.  Uh-uh.  
L:  [inaudible]
R:  We're in the public schools.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  If -- yeah.
R:  I mean, there's Harry Potters all over the place in our library --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, um, I remember at our -- at again at elementary school level our, ah, librarian who has since retired, um, there was a series of books called the Bailey School Kids and the- -- it was kind of like, [MN] werewolf don't like something and I -- I mean it was kind of like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- a little bit scary and my son just loved them.  I mean, they're like mysteries --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you could -- he'd sit down, little paperbacks and read them, cover to cover, it'd take him about an hour and this is in like second grade and so after we were done, I mean, you know, he was done, I took him to the library to donate them and she's like, oh, I don't know if we should have these here --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and I thought, oh.  I mean, there's -- they're a mystery.
