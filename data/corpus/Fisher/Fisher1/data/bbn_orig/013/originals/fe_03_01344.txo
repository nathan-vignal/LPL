L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Yes.  My name is Bob.
R:  My name is Angelie.
L:  And wh- -- where are you located?
R:  I'm in Philadelphia.
L:  Oh.  I'm in Astoria, Oregon.
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We're supposed to be talking about private schools and books not being allowed?
R:  Ah, books not being ah censorship in books?
L:  Right.
R:  Okay.
L:  What do you --
R:  Um --
L:  What -- what --
R:  I'm -- I'm very liberal, so I'm not in favor of any kind of censorship, um, I think that just banning books will -- will foster people's, um, attention and then it will just have the opposite effect, so they'll make people more interested in that which they can't have.
L:  Well, I don't --
R:  What do you think?
L:  -- I don't know if I'm liberal or not, but I -- I -- I don't think that people should be able to -- to not, ah, be allowed to read what they'd like to read --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I -- I don't understand why even now there are some books that are -- that are a- [MN] that are not allowed, ah, to be read in, you know, certain grades or whatever and -- and I'm not sure I understand that.  You said, being liberal you think that allows -- or that -- that because you are that means that you don't think there should be any censorship at all?
R:  Well, um, n- -- for the most part, I mean, I -- I believe that, you know, the First Amendment was created to so that we would be able to read what we like and to have access to any kind of material that we would like, um, and to be able to say what we want, read what we want.  I think that's basically the essence of the First Amendment.  And, um, I mean, I -- I understand how some literature could be considered harmful to people who are --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- especially at a young age where they're more impressionable, but, um --
L:  Well, what [MN] --what about, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- getting off of books for just a second, what about movies and things like that, do you think they should be allowed to be seen by a- -- I mean, a -- a -- age appropriate is what I'm getting at, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, do you think that's okay?
R:  Um, well, I think that it -- it's good that they're -- that, um, you know, that guidance is -- is encouraged, I mean, if you -- if you're under the age of, um, thirteen, you know, you shouldn't -- you should be able to see a PG thirteen movie, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with the supervision of somebody else, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't think that necessarily you should have access to any -- any rated movie at any age, you know --
L:  Let me ask you -- have you seen or ever heard of the move the Song of the South?
R:  Oh, what's it called?
L:  Song of the South.  It's an old cartoon type movie with, ah, the -- song zippedy dooh dah came from.
R:  No, I don't think I've ever heard of that.
L:  Oh.  Well, that's too bad [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because I wanted [LAUGH] -- what -- well, all right.  Let's took about the -- a book of Mice and Men -- have you --
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  -- have you read that?
R:  Yes, I have.
L:  [MN] What -- why do you think that's banned some places?
R:  Um, I wasn't aware that it was banned.  I know books like, um, Huckleberry Finn or, you know, Mark, ah, you know, books by Mark Twain have been banned before, um --
L:  W- -- why?
R:  -- I think -- I think it's just because some of the ideas presented at the time were very controversial and, um, you know, they might, I guess some of the ideas are maybe a little bit too -- too liberal for [inaudible] places, I guess, especially in the South, like the idea of, um, you know, a -- of black people having any kind of, um, any rights [several inaudible words] of their culture at the time, so because they didn't want --
L:  So, do you think it was --
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  So, you think it was all right to have them banned?
R:  No, I -- I don't, but I'm just trying to, ah, you know, offer a reason as to why they might have been banned at the time, I don't agree with them being banned at all.
L:  Oh, good.  Because I don't -- I don't, you know, I'm -- I'm a big Mark Twain fan, actually, I've been through Hannibal quite a few times and -- and I -- I just don't understand why -- it sounds li- -- it sounds like politically correctness to me -- political correctness.
R:  Yeah.  Definitely.  I think people are just kind of scared also if anything challenges their belief system, if you live in a stable community where everybody kind of things the same, anything that might change that is a threat, you know.  So, um, that would be an unwelcome kind of thing if you're happy with your current situation, you -- you wouldn't welcome any kind of change.
L:  Yeah, but I -- I don't know that I agree with that.  I think changes are -- at least, a -- the -- the accessibility to change should -- should be looked at positively by everybody.
R:  I agree.  I mean, I think change is very healthy and I think that to be settled into one kind of mindset is very, you know, it's in a way, um, you know, people are kind of ignorant if they're so narrow minded, so I think that change is good and, um, you know, they should welcome any kind of different viewpoint, but unfortunately a lot of people, um, don't have that kind of mindset, you know --
L:  Well, you know --
R:  -- anybody who thinks differently than they do, um, they just want to get rid of or silence.
L:  I find it interesting that you began by -- by saying that you were a liberal and -- and this way and -- and I don't think of myself as a liberal, but I am listening to you and -- and talking to you and you to me and -- and it seems like we both [LAUGH] agree on a lot of things and yet we --
R:  Right.
L:  -- say we're the opposite, so, maybe that's good.
R:  Well, do you think that you're a conservative?
L:  No.  I don't know that I'm a conservative so much as that I -- I -- I don't [SIGH] I don't know, I -- I -- I -- I'm -- I guess I l- -- look at what people call a u- -- would you consider yourself on the left, then, well -- quote I hate terms, but I [MN] that's what -- liberals seems to claim to be on the left, is that how you'd look at yourself?
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I -- I don't think I'm unreasonably to the left, I'm not an extremist, but, um, I do agree with a lot of the, you know, left wing agendas, I always vote to democratic, so, um --
L:  Well, now, see, now -- now -- see that -- that's where I think I have a problem about vote -- wh- -- why when you say you always vote democratic -- I -- I'm a registered independent and I have been for a while and -- but I vote for -- I [MN] always think that I should vote for the person, not because they're republican or democrat, but because the majority of what they think is the way I think, [MN] even though if some of them, some things aren't that -- you -- I -- I've never found anybody that agreed everything the way I thought it should be --
R:  Well, that's the way, I mean, I don't think you can find somebody who will see eye to eye on every single issue that, you know, that you do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, um, I mean, I -- usually I do look at the person, you know, I -- I -- I have certain issues that I feel most strongly about and as long as the person, you know, um, would vote the same way that I would on, ah, those -- those main issues then I would -- I would vote for them and in most -- in most cases the democrat candidate usually does, you know, they're in support of what I'm support of.
L:  Well, what if one person had everything that you liked about him, but he didn't want certain books read in -- in the classroom?  Would that still be okay to vote for him, then?
R:  Well, um, I mean, would it be his personal opinion or would it be something that he would try to make into law?  You know.
L:  [NOISE] Something that he would try to do.
R:  Well, I don't know if I could support him, then, you know, because first of all I -- I don't -- I kind of think that would inconsistent, like, if he -- if he agreed with everything else that I agreed with, then I think that that -- that would be a little inconsistent with his other views.  You know.
L:  [NOISE] Well, I -- I -- I'm not -- I don't know about that.  I -- ah, hm.  My daughter I- I- is -- is -- is, a Catholic, but yet she --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- isn't -- she is more pro --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- life than pro -- I mean, pro choice than pro life.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Do you think that's -- I mean, so, I -- and so I think people can be directed in one -- in one direction and -- and still, ah, have certain things that they are vehemently opposed to.
R:  Really.  Well, I think a lot of factors go into it.  I mean, maybe just the fact that she's a female could play a large part in her decision about abortion.  You know, um, not necessarily just because, you know, of your religion you're going to think, you know, the same way as most people in that religion, you know.  Um, I think a lot of factors go into, um, like a lot of factors influence the way you think about different things, you know, um [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm Jewish, so I would support somebody who -- who would be a Jewish candidate, probably, I wouldn't support anybody who, you know, is, um, anti Semitic, definitely, like that's -- that's very important to me.
L:  How -- how do you feel about the current, ah, war situation, I mean, put it that way?
R:  Um, well, you know, I -- I try not to involve myself too much in, um, in -- in political affairs and [inaudible] I try not to read the newspaper, I try not to watch TV because I find it very depressing.  You know, I -- I don't -- I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I feel that Saddam Hussein is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is a very evil person and what he's done to his people is just atrocious and I do believe, you know, that something should be done about that.  I just don't know if we've necessarily tried, you know, alternate means aside -- besides war, you know, I don't know if we've necessarily explored all the different alternatives.  Then again, I -- I really don't know.  I haven't [NOISE] you know, I've purposely tried not to know.
L:  [NOISE]
