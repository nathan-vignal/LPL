I DON'T EVEN THINK THE COMMITMENT HAS TO BE SPOKEN I THINK TWO PEOPLE CAN TELL IF THAT COMMITMENT'S THERE  (fe_03_00214-A-0028)
I NEVER CONSIDER CHILDREN TO BE A LIFETIME PARTNER IN FACT I CONSIDER CHILDREN MORE LIKE UM  (fe_03_00214-A-0030)

[NOISE] [NOISE] [NOISE]  (fe_03_00214-A-0034)
I THINK THAT THAT'S THE SAME THING AS A LIFETIME COMMITMENT A LIFETIME PARTNER  (fe_03_00214-A-0035)
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SO MANY PEOPLE ARE SO THREATENED BY IT OTHER THAN  (fe_03_00214-A-0036)
THAT USUALLY GETS INTO A RELIGIOUS ARENA  (fe_03_00214-A-0037)
AND EVEN AND EVEN THEN IT'S LIKE IF ONE PROCLAIMS TO BE A CHRISTIAN  (fe_03_00214-A-0038)
YOU KNOW JESUS NEVER MARRIED AND JESUS WENT AROUND WITH A BUNCH OF GUYS  (fe_03_00214-A-0039)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00214-A-0040)
[LAUGHTER] WELL AND WE ALL YOU KNOW WE KNOW JUST FROM HISTORY THAT UM  (fe_03_00214-A-0042)
BISEXUALITY WAS MUCH MORE ACCEPTED LIKE IN THE TIMES OF THE GREEKS YOU KNOW SO  (fe_03_00214-A-0043)

WHO WAS MARRIED WHAT  (fe_03_00214-A-0045)
OH YEAH MARRIED HIS UH THIRTEEN YEAR OLD COUSIN  (fe_03_00214-A-0046)
WELL YOU KNOW AGAIN IT'S JUST A SOCIET- SOC- SOCIETAL NORMS CHANGE THERE WAS A TIME WHEN IT IT WAS NOT CONSIDERED OU- OUT OF THE ORDINARY TO BE MARRIED AT THAT AGE AND I THINK IT WAS YOU KNOW PROBABLY DURING THE GROWTH OF OUR COUNTRY WHEN PEOPLE WERE MOVING WESTWARD  (fe_03_00214-A-0047)
I DON'T THINK THEY WAITED TILL THEY WERE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_00214-A-0048)
DEFINITELY DIDN'T WAIT TILL THEY WERE LIKE TWENTY FIVE THEY'RE GETTING MARRIED THEY WEREN'T EVEN FINISHING HIGH SCHOOL AND THEY WERE GETTING MARRIED MOST PEOPLE ONLY HAD AN EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION IF THAT  (fe_03_00214-A-0049)
SO I AGAIN I THINK IT'S KIND OF A SOCIETAL THING AND THE AND THE TIMES AND YOU KNOW WHO KNOWS BIBLICALLY SPEAKING WHEN THEY SAY CERTAIN PEOPLE LIVED TO BE HUNDREDS OF YEARS OLD YOU KNOW WE DON'T WE AREN'T SURE IF THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME KIND OF YEAR AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND  (fe_03_00214-A-0050)

BUT MY FRIENDS HAVE TOLD ME THAT THEIR DAUGHTERS STARTED MENSTRUATING LIKE IN FOURTH GRADE  (fe_03_00214-A-0054)
AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE ONLY LIKE ELEVEN YEARS OLD AT THAT POINT SO BIOLOGICALLY OR PHYSICALLY ONE IS READY TO BE MARRIED AT THAT AGE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_00214-A-0055)
E- ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO CONTEND THAT THE POINT OF MARRIAGE IS PROCREATION  (fe_03_00214-A-0056)
YEAH BUT WHAT WHAT MAKES IT WHAT  (fe_03_00214-A-0057)
