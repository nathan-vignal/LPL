[LIPSMACK] MHM LIKE YEAH SHE JUST SEES  (fe_03_00201-B-0068)
THESE MORALS OF UM LIKE RATIONALISM AND EQUALITY AND AND SHE SEES THEM AS AS COMING FROM THE THE PROTESTANT RELIGION  (fe_03_00201-B-0070)
UM WHICH KIND OF CAUSED A A LOT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE IN JUDAISM TO GET RID OF A LOT OF THE TRADITIONAL PRACTICES AND RITUALS  (fe_03_00201-B-0071)
JUST IN FAVOR OF FITTING IN WITH THE NEW WITH THE NEW IDEAS AND THE NEW THE NEW VIEW VIEW THAT EVERYBODY'S EQUAL AND AND REASON CAN FIGURE OUT SOLUTIONS TO EVERYTHING  (fe_03_00201-B-0072)

THEY THE CHURCH SHOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN RID OF THE LATIN MASS BECAUSE I GUESS IT USED TO BE A REALLY CENTRAL FOCUS TO  (fe_03_00201-B-0082)
CATHOLICISM WHERE WHERE YEAH  (fe_03_00201-B-0083)
