UM THAT THE COCKPIT AND THE PAST THE COCKPIT HAS NEVER BEEN LOCKED  (fe_03_00290-A-0014)

OVER MY LIFETIME I HAVEN'T FLOWN PROBABLY NEARLY AS MUCH AS MOST PEOPLE UM  (fe_03_00290-A-0030)
AND OF COURSE BEFORE SEPTEMBER ELEVEN A LOT OF THIS AIRLINE SECURITY WAS JUST KIND OF YOU KNOW THE THE ROUTINE STUFF THAT IN FACT I  (fe_03_00290-A-0031)
USED TO REALLY WONDER ABOUT IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU WOULD GO TO THE TICKET COUNTER AND THEY WOULD SAY ARE YOU CARRYING ANY GUNS ARE YOU CARRYING ANY EXPLOSIVES YOU KNOW YOU'D SAY NO AND THEY'D SAY OKAY AND IT'S LIKE WELL WHY EVEN ASK THAT QUESTION IT'S ABSURD  (fe_03_00290-A-0032)
[LAUGHTER] YOU REALLY THINK THAT THEY'D NEED PERJURY IF THEY CATCH YOU WITH A GUN ON AN AIRPLANE  (fe_03_00290-A-0033)
OH BECAUSE OTHER THAN THAT THERE IS NO REASON BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE WHO IS CARRYING A GUN WON'T SAY SO  (fe_03_00290-A-0034)
YEAH  (fe_03_00290-A-0035)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00290-A-0036)
OH  (fe_03_00290-A-0037)
YEAH  (fe_03_00290-A-0038)

YEAH OKAY YEAH  (fe_03_00290-A-0040)
MHM  (fe_03_00290-A-0042)
OH REALLY  (fe_03_00290-A-0043)
HUH  (fe_03_00290-A-0044)
YEAH  (fe_03_00290-A-0045)
AND NOW THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE CONSIDERED VERY ODD  (fe_03_00290-A-0046)
VERY ODD IF YOU EVEN THOUGHT OF TAKING IT ON A PLANE AT ALL MUCH LESS ON A CARRY YOU KNOW  (fe_03_00290-A-0047)

MHM  (fe_03_00290-A-0052)
WELL YOU KNOW GETTING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION I THINK THAT I THINK THAT I WOULD PROBABLY FEEL  (fe_03_00290-A-0053)
THAT THE HEIGHTENED SECURITY GIVEN ALL  (fe_03_00290-A-0054)
GIVEN ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVE GONE ON IN THIS COUNTRY AND AND ALL THE  (fe_03_00290-A-0055)
MISTAKES THAT THE F._B._I. AND C._I._A. HAVE BEEN MADING MAKING AND EVERYTHING I I DON'T FEEL ESPECIALLY CONVINCED THAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS REALLY GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF DIFFERENCE I I SORT OF FEEL MORE LIKE IF SOMEONE WANTS TO HIJACK A PLANE  (fe_03_00290-A-0056)
THEY'RE GOING TO GET IT THEY'RE GOING TO FIND A WAY TO DO IT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_00290-A-0057)
YEAH WELL AS YOU KNOW THEY USED YOU KNOW  (fe_03_00290-A-0058)
BOX CUTTERS FOR  (fe_03_00290-A-0059)
WEAPONS ON THAT OTHER PLANE WHICH DIDN'T GET DETECTED SO UM  (fe_03_00290-A-0060)
MHM  (fe_03_00290-A-0061)
YEAH AND YOU ALSO MAY BE ABLE TO SOMEHOW EITHER YOURSELF OR GET SOMEONE ELSE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE  (fe_03_00290-A-0062)
AIRPLANE AND AND YOU KNOW  (fe_03_00290-A-0063)
DO SOMETHING TO IT SO THAT WHEN IT WAS IN FLIGHT IT WAS GOING TO CRASH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT  (fe_03_00290-A-0064)
YEAH  (fe_03_00290-A-0065)
EXACTLY AND  (fe_03_00290-A-0066)
WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY SINCE NOW THEY'VE SORT OF GOT ALL THE FOCUS ON AIRLINES AND AND THINGS AND SO THEY'RE GOING TO GO OKAY WELL WHILE THEY'RE BUSY WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE QUIETLY DEVELOPING A NEW  (fe_03_00290-A-0067)
METHOD YOU KNOW  (fe_03_00290-A-0068)
NO  (fe_03_00290-A-0069)
THERE'S SO MANY OPTIONS  (fe_03_00290-A-0070)
MHM  (fe_03_00290-A-0071)
YEAH YEAH AND THERE AND THEREIN LIES THAT'S THE CRUX OF THE MATTER IS THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THAT YOU CAN PROTECT YOURSELF FROM ANY EVENTUALITY IN THE WORLD YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST NO WAY IT'S LIKE SOMEONE  (fe_03_00290-A-0072)
UM  (fe_03_00290-A-0073)
I WAS I WAS TALKING TO A FRIEND ONCE WHO SAID THAT SOMEONE HAD SUED  (fe_03_00290-A-0074)
A CAR COMPANY BECAUSE THEIR SEATBELT HAD BROKEN OR SOMETHING AND UM  (fe_03_00290-A-0075)
AND HE SAID YOU KNOW  (fe_03_00290-A-0076)
YOU JUST CAN'T YOU CAN'T PROTECT YOURSELF FROM EVERYTHING YOU KNOW THE WORLD IS FRAUGHT WITH DANGER I MEAN [LAUGHTER] THAT'S THE WAY IT IS YOU KNOW  (fe_03_00290-A-0077)
AND UNFORTUNATELY IT'S GETTING MORE AND MORE THAT WAY IT SEEMS  (fe_03_00290-A-0078)
SO THAT WHEN YOU KNOW RAISING CHILDREN IS YOU CAN NO LONGER FEEL SAFE IN TELLING THEM YEAH YOU'RE SAFE I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU NOTHING BAD WILL EVER HAPPEN  (fe_03_00290-A-0079)
MHM  (fe_03_00290-A-0080)

WELL DOES THAT ACTUALLY HAPPEN I'VE NEVER HEARD ABOUT THAT HAPPENING  (fe_03_00290-A-0087)
WHOA  (fe_03_00290-A-0088)
YEAH  (fe_03_00290-A-0090)
YES EXACTLY  (fe_03_00290-A-0092)
YEAH  (fe_03_00290-A-0094)
MHM  (fe_03_00290-A-0095)
MHM  (fe_03_00290-A-0096)
YEAH YEAH AND WHILE THE WITH AN AIRPLANE ALSO MAYBE YOU DON'T FEEL THIS WAY BECAUSE YOU FLY FREQUENTLY BUT  (fe_03_00290-A-0097)
I I THINK THAT PEOPLE  (fe_03_00290-A-0098)
TEND TO I TEND TO THINK OF IT AS OKAY YOU'RE UP THERE YOU'RE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_00290-A-0099)
YOU'RE MI- YOU'RE A MILE ABOVE THE EARTH TRAPPED IN THIS AIRPLANE AND IF SOMETHING HAPPENS YOU'RE YOU'RE A GONNER YOU KNOW  (fe_03_00290-A-0100)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_00290-A-0101)
YEAH  (fe_03_00290-A-0103)
RIGHT I THINK YOU ALSO IF IF YOU'RE LIKE ME YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL IF YOU'RE THE ONE DRIVING THE CAR THAN A  (fe_03_00290-A-0104)
YOU YOU HAVE YOUR OWN SELF TO BLAME OR SOMETHING BUT  (fe_03_00290-A-0105)
YEAH  (fe_03_00290-A-0106)
HELLO THIS IS DOUG  (fe_03_00290-B-0001)
WELL I'VE DONE A LOT OF FLYING SINCE SINCE SEPTEMBER ELEVEN  (fe_03_00290-B-0002)
AND I'VE SEEN  (fe_03_00290-B-0003)
AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE'S TOENAIL CLIPPERS CONFISCATED  (fe_03_00290-B-0004)
BUT  (fe_03_00290-B-0006)
I ALSO SUSPECT THAT THE BIGGEST CHANGE  (fe_03_00290-B-0007)
ISN'T A RESULT OF HEIGHTENED SECURITY THE BIGGEST CHANGE IS A RESULT OF A CHANGE IN PASSENGER EXPECTATIONS  (fe_03_00290-B-0008)
AH IN THE OLD DAYS  (fe_03_00290-B-0009)
AFTER THE RASH OF HIJACKINGS IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE EXPECTATION WAS THAT IF THERE W- IF SOMEONE HIJACKED YOUR AIRPLANE  (fe_03_00290-B-0011)
YOU WERE A HOSTAGE AND THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE YOU TO SOME AIRPORT OTHER THAN YOUR DESTINATION AND THEN THERE WOULD BE SOME NEGOTIATIONS THAT MIGHT TAKE A WHILE BUT IF EVERYONE BEHAVED NICELY THEY'D ALL BE RELEASED  (fe_03_00290-B-0012)
AND NOW IF SOMEONE WERE TO START ACTING LIKE A HIJACKER  (fe_03_00290-B-0013)
AH PEOPLE WOULD FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES AND DO DESPERATE THINGS AND AH I THINK IT'S THAT DOING DESPERATE THINGS ON THE PART OF ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE PASSENGERS THAT WOULD  (fe_03_00290-B-0014)
MAKE THAT APPROACH TO TERRORISM PRETTY MUCH A FAILURE  (fe_03_00290-B-0015)
WELL I [MN] SINCE SEPTEMBER ELEVEN I THINK MORE AND MORE EVERYTHING HAS BEEN PROPERLY LOCKED UP UP FRONT DURING THE FLIGHT ONCE THEY LAND THEY OPEN THE COCKPIT DOOR AND THE PILOT SMILES AT EVERYBODY  (fe_03_00290-B-0017)
BUT AH BUT DURING THE FLIGHT THINGS HAVE BEEN PRETTY LOCKED UP AND I I ONE TIME THAT I  (fe_03_00290-B-0018)
THAT I FLEW I'M PRETTY SURE MY SEAT MATE WAS A FEDERAL AIR MARSHALL AH HE DIDN'T SAY SO BUT  (fe_03_00290-B-0019)
OH WE'D FALL INTO CONVERSATION AND HE'D BEEN FLYING A LOT AND I'D BEEN FLYING A LOT AND ALL IT WAS ONLY LATER THAT I REALISED THAT HIS PATTERN OF FLYING A LOT  (fe_03_00290-B-0020)
GOING OUT AND BACK IN ONE DAY FROM FROM FROM O'HARE  (fe_03_00290-B-0021)
DIDN'T REALLY MATCH  (fe_03_00290-B-0022)
WELL I MEAN THERE IS A ONE CAN IMAGINE CERTAIN GOVERNMENT PEOPLE DOING THAT TO FOR A BRIEF MEETING SAY AT THE PENTAGON OR SOMETHING  (fe_03_00290-B-0023)
BUT IN MOST CASES PEOPLE GET OVERNIGHTS AH AND AND THE IDEA THAT THAT HE WAS SPENDING ESSENTIALLY ALL DAY ON THE AIRPLANE IT JUST STRUCK ME THAT THE HE WAS PROBABLY AN AIR MARSHALL  (fe_03_00290-B-0024)
AND W- WE WERE IN THE FRONT SEAT I'VE FREQUENTLY BEEN ASSIGNED TO FRONT SEATS  (fe_03_00290-B-0025)
AH NOT NORMALLY BUT THE LAST TWO YEARS I HAVE  (fe_03_00290-B-0027)
YEAH  (fe_03_00290-B-0029)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00290-B-0030)
AH I KNOW WHY THEY ASK THAT QUESTION AND THE ANSWER IS THAT IF YOU SAY NO AND THEN THEY CATCH YOU WITH A GUN THEY'VE GOT YOU FOR PERJURY AS WELL AS A WEAPONS CHARGE  (fe_03_00290-B-0031)
I THINK IT IT'S REALLY HELPFUL TO HAVE ADDITIONAL THINGS TO CHARGE SOMEONE WITH  (fe_03_00290-B-0032)
YEAH  (fe_03_00290-B-0033)
IT'S ALSO TO REMIND PEOPLE I MEAN IF YOU THE IT'S AMAZING THE THINGS PEOPLE CARRY WITH THEM CARELESSLY THERE'S THIS GUY WHO VERY SHORTLY AFTER SEPTEMBER ELEVEN WAS F- HE WAS A CHEF AND HE WAS FLYING WITH ALL OF HIS CHEF'S KNIVES  (fe_03_00290-B-0034)
AND HE THOUGHT THEY WEREN'T WEAPONS WELL TO HIM THEY WERE THE TOOLS OF HIS TRADE BUT BUT  (fe_03_00290-B-0035)
THIS IS A WHOLE  (fe_03_00290-B-0036)
A WHOLE CARRY ON BAG FULL OF OF OF CUTLERY THEY  (fe_03_00290-B-0037)
HAVE TO CHECK THEM  (fe_03_00290-B-0038)
BUT THE THE JUST LIKE FIREARMS ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IF YOU'RE TAKING A RIFLE WITH YOU IS CHECK IT AND THERE'S A LOT OF TOURIST TRADE WITH HUNTERS  (fe_03_00290-B-0039)
WHERE  (fe_03_00290-B-0040)
IN FACT I REMEMBER IN THE IN THE LATE SIXTIES FLYING  (fe_03_00290-B-0041)
FLYING HOME FOR THANKSGIVING BREAK FLYING TO MICHIGAN FROM PITTSBURGH  (fe_03_00290-B-0042)
AND I WAS A STUDENT  (fe_03_00290-B-0043)
AND I WOULD FREQUENTLY FIND MYSELF SITTING IN FRONT OF OR BEHIND A PAIR OF HUNTERS WHO AH  (fe_03_00290-B-0044)
WHO'D BEEN DEER WHO WERE GOING TO MICHIGAN FOR FOR HUNTING SEASON  (fe_03_00290-B-0045)
AND BACK THEN THIS IS BEFORE THE FIRE BEFORE THE HIJACKING ISSUE IT WAS PERFECTLY REASONABLE FOR THEM TO TAKE THEIR GUNS AS CARRY ON BAGGAGE  (fe_03_00290-B-0046)
PUT IT IN THE OVERHEAD BIN  (fe_03_00290-B-0047)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00290-B-0048)
YEAH DEER RIFLES YES WELL NO ACTUALLY I AH PEOPLE STILL CHECK THAT KIND OF THING ALTHOUGH THEY CAN'T TAKE AMMUNITION  (fe_03_00290-B-0049)
BUT THEY CAN CHECK FIREARMS AND AND AND CONSIDERING THE TRADE IN HUNTERS AH AS A MAJOR PART OF THE INCOME DURING DEER SEASON FOR EXAMPLE FOR A NUMBER OF STATES  (fe_03_00290-B-0050)
MICHIGAN AND MINNESOTA  (fe_03_00290-B-0051)
AND AND AH YOU KNOW THEY'D LOVE TO ATTRACT DEER HUNTERS FORM AH  (fe_03_00290-B-0052)
FROM STATES THAT DON'T HAVE DEER AH THEY SEE IT AS A MAJOR SOURCE OF TOURIST INCOME SO  (fe_03_00290-B-0053)
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF HUNTERS WHO WHO TAKE WEAPONS  (fe_03_00290-B-0054)
YEAH  (fe_03_00290-B-0055)
YEAH BUT AND ALSO IF SOMEONE WANTS TO BE A TERRORIST THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO TERRORIZE  (fe_03_00290-B-0056)
YEAH  (fe_03_00290-B-0057)
RIGHT AND AND IF I WANTED TO AH IF I WANTED  (fe_03_00290-B-0058)
TO AH TO TO COMMIT SOME NEW ACT OF TERRORISM I MEAN AH  (fe_03_00290-B-0059)
AH SMALL BOMBS IN CROWDED PLACES  (fe_03_00290-B-0060)
WOULD BE JUST AS EFFECTIVE AS SOURCES OF TERROR  (fe_03_00290-B-0061)
WELL BUT BUT THOSE ARE THOSE ARE SECURE NOW THOSE ARE SECURE TARGETS AND THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER THINGS WHERE IF I WANTED TO TERRORIZE A SOCIETY I'D SIMPLY  (fe_03_00290-B-0063)
I'D SIMPLY PICK SOME DIFFERENT THING  (fe_03_00290-B-0064)
SHOPPING MALL OR A OR A OR A FOOTBALL STADIUM WITH A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN IT AH  (fe_03_00290-B-0065)
YEAH  (fe_03_00290-B-0066)
A NEW  (fe_03_00290-B-0067)
RIGHT AND IT IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH INTELLIGENCE TO PICK NEW METHODS THERE'S SO MANY I MEAN ANY ANY COMPLEX ADVANCED CIVILIZATION HAS  (fe_03_00290-B-0068)
TREMENDOUS POINTS OF VULNERABILITY AND WE WE WHAT IS IT WE RELY ON AH  (fe_03_00290-B-0069)
WE RELY ON ON ON THE FACT THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE PLAY BY THE RULES THAT'S WHAT MAKES OUR SOCIETY WORK AND AND WHEN SOMEONE DECIDES TO GO BIZARRELY AGAINST THE RULES THINGS BREAK  (fe_03_00290-B-0070)
RIGHT RIGHT  (fe_03_00290-B-0071)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00290-B-0072)
THAT'S IS IS THAT JUST EXAGGERATED SENSE OF RISK I MEAN THERE WAS A  (fe_03_00290-B-0073)
THERE WAS A PIECE OF AH OF EMAIL I SAW RECENTLY FROM SOMEONE IN ISRAEL RESPONDING TO PEOPLE FROM FROM OUTSIDE OF ISRAEL AND HE SAID HOW CAN YOU STAND TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE THINGS ARE JUST SO VIOLENT AND SO AWFUL  (fe_03_00290-B-0074)
AND THEY POINTED OUT THAT THE AH THE THE DEATH RATE FROM TRAFFIC FATALITIES IN ISRAEL IS TWICE THE DEATH RATE FROM AH FROM VIOLENCE  (fe_03_00290-B-0075)
YEAH AND SO AND THE DEATH RATE OF TRAFFIC FATALITIES YOU KNOW PEOPLE DON'T STOP DRIVING BECAUSE OF THAT  (fe_03_00290-B-0076)
AND IT'S A QUESTION OF PUTTING RISKS IN PERSPECTIVE THAT THAT WE FREQUENTLY BECAUSE SOME RISK GETS A LOT OF PUBLICITY WE EXAGGERATE IT ALL OUT OF PROPORTION  (fe_03_00290-B-0077)
AND IF YOU PUT THE RISKS IN PERSPECTIVE YOU DISCOVER THAT A LOT OF COMMON EVERYDAY THINGS ARE ARE MORE DANGEROUS  (fe_03_00290-B-0078)
IF YOU IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT EXPLOSION RISKS THAT YOU ARE LIKELY TO BE FACED WITH  (fe_03_00290-B-0079)
THE AH GASOLINE TANK TRUCKS IN THE HIGHWAY ARE THE SINGLE GREATEST SOURCE OF OF OF MASSIVE CATASTROPHIC FIRES IN THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_00290-B-0080)
OH THERE WAS A CASE THAT I REMEMBER IN THE  (fe_03_00290-B-0081)
IN THE SEVENTIES I WAS IN COLORADO AT THE TIME A TANKER TRUCK HA- WAS INVOLVED IN A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT AND CAUGHT FIRE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FREEWAY INTERCHANGE IN DENVER  (fe_03_00290-B-0082)
AND IT WAS JUST AN INCREDIBLE MESS THOSE GASOLINE TANKER TRUCKS ARE REALLY HAZARDOUS  (fe_03_00290-B-0083)
AND FORTUNATELY THE ACCIDENT RATE IS LOW BUT IT'S NOT ZERO AND WHEN THEY DO HAVE ACCIDENTS IT'S NOT TOO HARD TO IGNITE THE FUEL  (fe_03_00290-B-0084)
AND IT'S BE- BUT BECAUSE IT'S A COMMON THING WE KNOW THOSE TANKER TRUCKS ARE EVERYWHERE WE KNOW TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS ARE EVERYWHERE SURE ONCE IN A WHILE ONE OF THEM WILL BLOW UP IT'S NOT EXCITING NEWS EXCEPT LOCALLY  (fe_03_00290-B-0085)
UM  (fe_03_00290-B-0086)
AND IT'S QUICKLY FORGOTTEN BECAUSE IT'S A FAMILIAR RISK NOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT DANGEROUS JUST BECAUSE IT'S FAMILIAR WHEREAS THE SAME AMOUNT OF CHAOS CAUSED BY BY A A A  (fe_03_00290-B-0087)
SOME OTHER LESS COMMON THING AH THAT THAT THE  (fe_03_00290-B-0088)
THE TRUCKLOAD OF OF OF SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL THAT HAS A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT AND NO ONE GETS INJURED  (fe_03_00290-B-0089)
AND THE FUEL CONTAINERS DON'T LEAK THAT'LL BE A FRONT PAGE NEWS STORY  (fe_03_00290-B-0090)
BECAUSE IT INVOLVES AN UNFAMILIAR RISK  (fe_03_00290-B-0091)
YEAH  (fe_03_00290-B-0092)
NOW THAT'S THAT'S THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AIRPLANES AND DRIVING AND DRIVING MOST ACCIDENTS ARE SURVIVABLE  (fe_03_00290-B-0093)
AND AIRPLANES MOST ACCIDENTS ARE NOT SURVIVABLE ON THE OTHER HAND DRIVING ACCIDENTS ARE SO COMMON THAT IT'S AN AWFULLY GOOD THING MOST OF THEM ARE SURVIVABLE BECAUSE OVERALL THE DEATH RATE ON THE ON IN CARS IS HIGHER  (fe_03_00290-B-0094)
AH  (fe_03_00290-B-0095)
YEAH IT'S YOUR FAULT  (fe_03_00290-B-0096)
YEAH WHEREAS WITH WITH AN AIRPLANE ACCIDENT YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE AN INNOC- YOU'RE AN INNOCENT VICTIM OF AIRPLANE  (fe_03_00290-B-0097)
