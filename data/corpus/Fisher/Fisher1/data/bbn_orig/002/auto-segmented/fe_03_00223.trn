FUNDAMENTAL BASICS I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN PUT THE FINGER LIKE THAT ON ON ONE THING BUT JUST SAYING THAT I DON'T KNOW SOMETHING SORT OF REALLY IMPORTANT TO YOU THAT  (fe_03_00223-A-0006)

UM BUILDING FROM THAT ESPECIALLY IF THAT'S ESSENTIAL FOR ME DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE  (fe_03_00223-A-0011)
SO I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT IF YOU'RE SO SO DIFFERENT BUT I MEAN WHO KNOWS DIFFERENT PEOPLE VALUE DIFFERENT THINGS AND SOME PEOPLE APPRECIATE SOME THINGS MORE THAN OTHERS SO YOU KNOW I THINK IT DEPENDS  (fe_03_00223-A-0012)

SHE IS LIKE I COULDN'T LIVE WITH SOMEONE THAT COMES AND PUTS LIKE THIS LITTLE BOWL THING HERE WHEN IT WAS THERE THAT'S WHY SHE SAYS SHE'S NEVER GONNA GET MARRIED I MEAN SHE WANTS TO HAVE I GUESS A LOVER OR SOMETHING BUT SHE COULD NEVER SHARE  (fe_03_00223-A-0034)
BECAUSE HER SPACE HAS TO BE ORATED IN SUCH A WAY AND I DON'T KNOW I SEE I FIND THAT REALLY ODD BUT SHE'S SERIOUS ABOUT IT THOUGH SHE IS LIKE I CAN'T DO IT YOU KNOW IF YOU COME AND MOVE MY THINGS AROUND I JUST I'M NOT HAPPY ANY MORE SO WELL OKAY [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00223-A-0035)
