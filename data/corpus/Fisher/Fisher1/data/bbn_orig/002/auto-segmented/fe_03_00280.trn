HI I'M I'M CORRINE  (fe_03_00280-A-0002)
HI HEATHER  (fe_03_00280-A-0003)
GOOD TO MEET YOU  (fe_03_00280-A-0004)
SO WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT UM  (fe_03_00280-A-0005)
THE SECURITY AND THE EFFECT ON WHAT DO WE THINK THAT THERE'S A  (fe_03_00280-A-0006)
UM THAT WE'RE SAFER BECAUSE OF THE SECURITY IF THERE'S A A DECREASED CHANCE OF ATTACKS YEAH  (fe_03_00280-A-0007)
WELL I'M NOT TOO IMPRESSED WITH THE SECURITY FOLKS THAT I'VE SEEN SO AH THE WAY IT'S CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED I DON'T I WOULD SAY NO I DON'T THINK THAT THERE I DON'T FEEL ANY SAFER  (fe_03_00280-A-0008)
UM IT SEEMS THAT PEOPLE DON'T REALLY CARE MUCH WHEN THEY'RE CHECKING I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE FLOWN A LOT SINCE  (fe_03_00280-A-0009)
IN THE LAST YEAR BUT UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO YOU THINK  (fe_03_00280-A-0010)
MHM [NOISE]  (fe_03_00280-A-0011)
I THINK SO TOO RIGHT  (fe_03_00280-A-0012)
YEAH LIKE WE'RE DOING SOMETHING YEAH  (fe_03_00280-A-0013)
JUST DOING SOMETHING  (fe_03_00280-A-0014)
YEAH NO I I THINK SO TOO BUT I DON'T THINK IT REALLY MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE MAYBE IT MAKES US FEEL BETTER BUT I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT IT MAKES US ANY SAFER BUT  (fe_03_00280-A-0015)
BUT I GUESS IT IS GOOD TO FEEL LIKE SOMETHING IS BEING DONE INSTEAD OF NOTHING BECAUSE ONE OF THE MOST FRUSTRATING FEELINGS IS THAT IF YOU THINK JUST NOTHING IS BEING DONE  (fe_03_00280-A-0016)
YOU MEAN ALL THE THE AIRPORT UM SECURITY OFFICERS THAT WE SEE STANDING AROUND A LOT OF THE TIME  (fe_03_00280-A-0017)
FOR SOMETHING ELSE YEAH  (fe_03_00280-A-0018)
I THINK SO  (fe_03_00280-A-0019)
I THINK FOR INSTANCE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BOTHERS ME IS WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE SITTING ON THE PLANE AND YOU SEE THESE UM  (fe_03_00280-A-0020)
UM YEAH TRUCKS COMING AND GOING PUTTING THE FOOD ON AND EVERYTHING I WONDER IF THOSE ARE WELL CHECKED OR NOT BECAUSE  (fe_03_00280-A-0021)
THE PEOPLE UM CARRYING THE BAGGAGE AROUND UM AND BRINGING FOOD AND DIFFERENT THINGS TO SERVICE THE AIRCRAFT  (fe_03_00280-A-0022)
WELL OR EMPLOYEES OF THE AIRPORT OR EMPLOYEES OF THE GAS COMPANIES  (fe_03_00280-A-0023)
YOU KNOW I WONDER IF ANYTHING IS DONE TO CHECK THEM MAYBE IT IS BUT IT DOESN'T UH SEEM SO OBVIOUS TO ME WHEN I'M SITTING THERE ON THE PLANE  (fe_03_00280-A-0024)
YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF AIRPORTS YOU COULD EASILY GET ON TO THE THE RUNWAYS AND THE UM  (fe_03_00280-A-0025)
UM THE GATE AREAS ON THE GROUND FROM OUTSIDE THERE NOT SECURE AT LEAST WHERE I'VE BEEN YOU COULD EASILY GET ONTO ANY OF THE RUNWAYS JUST PUT ON SOME CLOTHES THAT MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE WORKING FOR THE AIRLINES  (fe_03_00280-A-0026)
AND YOU COULD COME ACROSS WITH ANYTHING IN YOUR BAG AND STICK ANYTHING WITH THE LUGGAGE  (fe_03_00280-A-0027)
I WOULD HOPE SO I STILL THINK THAT IT'S VERY LIKE THAT THEY COULD GET ON WITH THINGS AND CAUSE AS MUCH TROUBLE AS THE PEOPLE DID ON SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T  (fe_03_00280-A-0028)
HAVE ANY GUNS FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THEY JUST HAD KNIVES  (fe_03_00280-A-0029)
BUT I I I THINK PEOPLE CAN STILL GET ON WITH THINGS LIKE THAT SO THAT WORRIES ME NO DOUBT  (fe_03_00280-A-0030)
YEAH I HOPE SO [NOISE]  (fe_03_00280-A-0031)
YEAH  (fe_03_00280-A-0032)
YEAH I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO BUT A- AND STILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO FLY AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO FLY OR  (fe_03_00280-A-0033)
THE ECONOMY'S GOING TO BE EVEN WORSE AFFECTED SO  (fe_03_00280-A-0034)
AND I FLY I MEAN I THINK IT WE'RE NOT TOO SECURE BUT I THINK THAT UM THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS THAT PEOPLE CAN CAUSE TROUBLE IN THIS COUNTRY  (fe_03_00280-A-0035)
WITHOUT UM JUST SOMETHING ABOUT THE AIRLINES AND I WOULD BE SHOCKED IF THEY WHOEVER IS TRYING TO CAUSE TROUBLE TRIES TO DO THE SAME THING TWICE SO I DON'T THINK THAT  (fe_03_00280-A-0036)
I DON'T THINK IT MAKES THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE WITH THE CHECKING OF THE AIRLINES NOW BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT'S GO- WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE UM  (fe_03_00280-A-0037)
