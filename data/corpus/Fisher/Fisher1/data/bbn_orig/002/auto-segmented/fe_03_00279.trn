MHM  (fe_03_00279-A-0007)

UM  (fe_03_00279-A-0010)

HM  (fe_03_00279-A-0022)
HOW AND ON THE OTHER HAND HOW GOOD IS ALL THIS SECURITY  (fe_03_00279-A-0023)
ATTACKERS ARE GOING TO BE LET INTO THE SYSTEM  (fe_03_00279-A-0025)
VIA DIFFERENT A ROUTE FOR EXAMPLE IF WHEN YOU MENTION YOU KNOW BAGGAGE HANDLERS  (fe_03_00279-A-0026)
UM YOU KNOW THERE'S A RUMOR THAT AH THERE WERE INSIDE PEOPLE THAT WAS INVOLVED UM IN THE AH  (fe_03_00279-A-0027)
THE HIJACKING UM  (fe_03_00279-A-0028)
IF PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED THAT ARE ARE  (fe_03_00279-A-0029)
ARE POTENTIAL TERRORISTS UM THEN N- NO MATTER HOW MUCH SECURITY THAT THAT HAS BEEN PUT INTO PLACE SINCE SEPTEMBER ELEVEN  (fe_03_00279-A-0030)

DID YOU FEEL ANY MORE SECURE BECAUSE OF THE CHANGES DID YOU FLY BEFORE  (fe_03_00279-A-0045)
SEPTEMBER ELEVEN  (fe_03_00279-A-0046)
BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN REALLY ANSWER THE QUESTION I JUST ASKED IF YOU UM HAVE SOME PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE  (fe_03_00279-A-0047)
MHM  (fe_03_00279-A-0048)
MHM  (fe_03_00279-A-0049)

CERTAINLY ENJOY TRAVEL UH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONALLY UM  (fe_03_00279-A-0051)
AND I HAVE AH FLOWN  (fe_03_00279-A-0052)
TO FLORIDA SINCE SEPTEMBER OF ELEVEN AND UM  (fe_03_00279-A-0053)
IT WAS A VERY EARLY FLIGHT  (fe_03_00279-A-0054)
AND I AH FOUND THAT IT WAS VERY  (fe_03_00279-A-0055)
AH SIMPLE TO GET PROCESSED IN FACT I WAS RUNNING LATE AND THAT WAS VERY SILLY OF ME  (fe_03_00279-A-0056)
BUT I WAS REALLY LUCKY BECAUSE THE GUY JUST CHECKED ME IN FROM OUTSIDE WHERE I UNDERSTAND HE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE OR HE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO  (fe_03_00279-A-0057)
AH WITHIN AN HOUR OF TIME FOR THE PLANE TO LEAVE BUT I HAD ONLY MINUTES SO IT WAS REALLY NICE BUT I WAS REALLY AH CUTTING IT CLOSE  (fe_03_00279-A-0058)
UM  (fe_03_00279-A-0059)
SO THEN YOU HAVE SECURITY WHERE SITUATIONS LIKE THAT UH YOU KNOW UM  (fe_03_00279-A-0060)
I'M NOT A TERRORIST BUT AH HERE IS THIS WOMAN WHO AH RUNNING LATE AND WHY CAN'T A TERRORIST AH  (fe_03_00279-A-0061)
PLAY A ROLE LIKE THAT AND THERE GOES THAT BAG RIGHT THROUGH AH THE DOOR BECAUSE SOME HELPFUL PERSON SO  (fe_03_00279-A-0062)
THAT'S AH ANOTHER UM ELEMENT OF THE SYSTEM THAT YOU KNOW IS GOING TO BREAK DOWN I DON'T AH I DON'T KNOW IF I FEEL MORE SECURE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ARE AH ASKING  (fe_03_00279-A-0063)
AH OTHERS OR MYSELF TO TAKE OFF MY SHOES BEFORE BOARDING THE PLANE AH ESPECIALLY WHEN I KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE UM NOT AS CAUTIOUS AS AS THOSE PEOPLE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_00279-A-0064)
I DIDN'T SEE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE EXCEPT FOR LONGER LINES  (fe_03_00279-A-0065)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00279-A-0066)
YEAH I PROBABLY HAD LIKE  (fe_03_00279-A-0067)
MAYBE FIFTEEN MINUTES TO GET ON BOARD IT WAS REALLY BAD OF ME I JUST UM  (fe_03_00279-A-0068)
IT WAS VERY EARLY FLIGHT AND I JUST I THOUGHT TAKING A EARLIER FLIGHT WOULD HELP ME TO AVOID THE LONG LINES BUT I OVERSLEPT AND YOU KNOW YADA YADA YADA YADA UM  (fe_03_00279-A-0069)
MHM [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00279-A-0070)
AND THE THING THAT [COUGH] INTERESTS ME IS THIS GENTLEMAN WAS MORE INTERESTED OR OR  (fe_03_00279-A-0071)

HELLO  (fe_03_00279-B-0001)
I'M ALVIN  (fe_03_00279-B-0002)
UM I THE TOPIC IS AIRPORT SECURITY I GUESS THE QUESTION WAS  (fe_03_00279-B-0003)
DO WE THINK THAT HEIGHTENED SECURITY  (fe_03_00279-B-0004)
LESSENS THE CHANCE OF TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE AIR  (fe_03_00279-B-0005)
UM  (fe_03_00279-B-0006)
I CERTAINLY THINK THAT THE  (fe_03_00279-B-0007)
CHANCE OF OF THAT IS FAR LOWER  (fe_03_00279-B-0008)
NOW THAN IT WAS BEFORE SEPTEMBER ELEVEN  (fe_03_00279-B-0009)
UM  (fe_03_00279-B-0010)
UM  (fe_03_00279-B-0011)
MOSTLY BECAUSE  (fe_03_00279-B-0012)
WE IMMEDIATELY CHANGED THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT AH AS IT WERE ON ON ON DEALING WI- WITH WITH HIJACKERS UM  (fe_03_00279-B-0013)
UM AND SO  (fe_03_00279-B-0014)
I THINK THE NEXT  (fe_03_00279-B-0015)
BIG TERRORIST ATTACK WILL BE PLANNED FOR AS BY TO BE DONE BY SOME OTHER MEANS AND THE CHANCE OF WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE UM I- IS GREATLY LESSENED  (fe_03_00279-B-0016)
WHAT DO YOU THINK  (fe_03_00279-B-0017)
S-  (fe_03_00279-B-0018)
SO I'M  (fe_03_00279-B-0019)
IN SOME SENSE  (fe_03_00279-B-0020)
THEY HAVE HEIGHTENED SECURITY I AM GLAD THEY'RE FORTIFYING COCKPIT DOORS  (fe_03_00279-B-0021)
AND  (fe_03_00279-B-0022)
BASICALLY SAYING THAT  (fe_03_00279-B-0023)
THAT HIJACKERS WILL  (fe_03_00279-B-0024)
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO  (fe_03_00279-B-0025)
ACCESS PILOTS AND WILL NOT BE ABLE TO  (fe_03_00279-B-0026)
GET IN THE COCKPITS AND WILL  (fe_03_00279-B-0027)
THEREFORE HAVE LITTLE INCENTIVE TO TO  (fe_03_00279-B-0028)
TO TRY THAT UM  (fe_03_00279-B-0029)
SKY MARSHALLS  (fe_03_00279-B-0030)
UM YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF  (fe_03_00279-B-0031)
JUST WHAT PERCENTAGE OF FLIGHTS HAVE SKY MARSHALLS ON THEM UM THEY'D BE RATHER SWAMPED  (fe_03_00279-B-0032)
WELL IT'S GOOD YOU DON'T THE THE POTENTIAL HIJACKERS DON'T KNOW WHICH FLIGHTS THEY'RE ON  (fe_03_00279-B-0033)
UM  (fe_03_00279-B-0034)
BUT  (fe_03_00279-B-0035)
I GUESS WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH  (fe_03_00279-B-0036)
GOOD OTHER  (fe_03_00279-B-0037)
SECURITY MEASURES ARE DOING WITH  (fe_03_00279-B-0038)
WITH  (fe_03_00279-B-0039)
THIS LIKE RANDOMLY DECIDING WHICH PASSENGERS TO  (fe_03_00279-B-0040)
SEARCH OR WHATEVER I SUPPOSE THAT  (fe_03_00279-B-0041)
THE IMMEDIATE MEASURES TAKEN THAT THE THREAT OF HIJACKING AND USING THE THE COMMERCIAL AIRLINERS AS UM PROJECTILES  (fe_03_00279-B-0043)
UM  (fe_03_00279-B-0044)
THAT  (fe_03_00279-B-0046)
THE BIGGER  (fe_03_00279-B-0047)
ISSUE BECOMES UM  (fe_03_00279-B-0048)
UM EXPLOSIVES AND BEING STORED IN IN IN IN BAGGAGE AND UM  (fe_03_00279-B-0049)
OTHER MEASURES ARE  (fe_03_00279-B-0050)
BEING PUT IN PLACE TO  (fe_03_00279-B-0051)
TO ADDRESS THOSE UM  (fe_03_00279-B-0052)
UM I DON'T KNOW HOW  (fe_03_00279-B-0053)
WELL THAT'S PROCEEDING OR HOW  (fe_03_00279-B-0054)
WHAT DEGREE OF SECURITY IT'S IT'S PROVIDING [NOISE]  (fe_03_00279-B-0055)
YEAH WELL WELL YEAH PART PART OF THE NEW SECURITY IS UM  (fe_03_00279-B-0056)

AH INVESTIGATING THE THE THE PEOPLE WHO WILL WHO ARE EMPLOYED IN  (fe_03_00279-B-0058)
AH VARIOUS ASPECTS OF AIRPORT OPERATIONS AH AND INDEED THE THE  (fe_03_00279-B-0059)
PART THAT'S BEEN FEDERALIZED WITH THE NEW TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION CERTAINLY THERE HAVE BEEN LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE  (fe_03_00279-B-0060)
UM DISMISSED AS AS AIRPORT EMPLOYEES AT SOME OF THE MAJOR AIRPORTS  (fe_03_00279-B-0061)
UM  (fe_03_00279-B-0062)
MOSTLY FOR FOR  (fe_03_00279-B-0063)
IMMIGRATION VIOLATIONS RATHER THAN  (fe_03_00279-B-0064)
BEING A A SPECIFIC AH  (fe_03_00279-B-0065)
AH SECURITY THREAT BUT THAT'S  (fe_03_00279-B-0066)
AH  (fe_03_00279-B-0067)
IMPORT- RELEVANT ASPECT UM  (fe_03_00279-B-0068)
I GUESS  (fe_03_00279-B-0069)
I MEAN OF NOT ONLY ABOUT BAGGAGE BUT ABOUT THE THE DANGER OF SABOTAGE OF SOME TYPE  (fe_03_00279-B-0070)
AH TO AIRCRAFT  (fe_03_00279-B-0071)
UM  (fe_03_00279-B-0072)
I REMEMBER THAT FROM THAT THE THE NOVEMBER CRASH IN NEW YORK THERE SEEMED TO BE SOME SOME CHANCE OF THAT BAGGAGE THAT DID NOT TURN OUT TO BE THE  (fe_03_00279-B-0073)
BE THE CASE BUT UM  (fe_03_00279-B-0074)
BUT  (fe_03_00279-B-0075)
YES ANYONE WHO HAS ACCESS TO SECURE AREAS OF AIRPORTS AH IS  (fe_03_00279-B-0076)
SOMEONE  (fe_03_00279-B-0077)
THAT LIKE SECURITY SYSTEM NEEDS TO ADDRESS IN TERMS OF OF UH  (fe_03_00279-B-0078)
ASSURING THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT PEOPLE WHO WHO WOULD  (fe_03_00279-B-0079)

TWO ROUND TRIPS TO CALIFORNIA SINCE THEN  (fe_03_00279-B-0082)

ON MY OWN  (fe_03_00279-B-0085)
UM  (fe_03_00279-B-0086)
I MEAN I'M  (fe_03_00279-B-0087)
PROBABLY LESS ANXIOUS TO FLY THAN BEFORE MORE  (fe_03_00279-B-0088)
BECAUSE OF THE HASSLE FACTOR THAN BECAUSE OF UH  (fe_03_00279-B-0089)
AH SECURITY CONCERN  (fe_03_00279-B-0090)
GOING COAST TO COAST AH  (fe_03_00279-B-0092)
AH THERE'S MUCH CHOICE ABOUT WHAT MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION AH TO TO TO USE  (fe_03_00279-B-0093)
SO UM  (fe_03_00279-B-0094)
IT PROBABLY  (fe_03_00279-B-0095)
MA- THE SITUATION MAKES ME LESS ANXIOUS TO FLY FOR PLEASURE IF I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC PLACE TO GO TO WHEN I'M  (fe_03_00279-B-0096)
PLANNING A VACATION I'M  (fe_03_00279-B-0097)

IN THAT SENSE I DIDN'T  (fe_03_00279-B-0108)
I DIDN'T WORRY AIR TRAVEL TRAFFIC UH  (fe_03_00279-B-0109)
IS BASICALLY UH UH SAFER THAN THE HIJACKING THREAT AND IN FACT  (fe_03_00279-B-0110)
THE HIJACKING THREAT MAY BE LESSER NOW THAN THAN THAN EVER BEFORE THAT IS WE DON'T THESE DAYS HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE HIJACKING PLANES FOR FOR MONEY AND THAT SORT OF THING  (fe_03_00279-B-0111)
