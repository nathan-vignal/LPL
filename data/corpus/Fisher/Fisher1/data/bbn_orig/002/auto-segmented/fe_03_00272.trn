YEAH  (fe_03_00272-A-0022)
THIS IS UH  (fe_03_00272-A-0024)
YEAH YEAH UH WE WORK WE WERE ACTUALLY ON THE STREET AND UH WHEN WE HEARD ABOUT IT  (fe_03_00272-A-0025)
UM WE JUST RUSHED TO HOME AND UH WE WERE ACTUALLY EXACTLY IN THE STREET GOING TO A DOCTOR FOR A DOCTOR VISIT  (fe_03_00272-A-0026)
AND IN THE DOCTOR IT WAS VERY CROWDED AND VERY THERE BECAUSE THEY UH THEY WANT TO FINISH EVERYBODY AND SEND EVERYBODY HOME SO  (fe_03_00272-A-0027)
UH IT WAS REALLY A VERY TERRIBLE AND EVERYBODY WAS SCARED AND NOBODY IS UH CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING YEAH  (fe_03_00272-A-0028)
SO DO YOU CONSIDER IT AH AH LIKE TOURISM  (fe_03_00272-A-0029)
YEAH YEAH YEAH DEFINITELY AND IT'S  (fe_03_00272-A-0030)
I DIDN'T KNOW THOUGH WHAT THE MEANING OF TERRORISM UNTIL THIS MOMENT YOU KNOW UNTIL THE SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH SO UH IT'S IT'S UH IT'S  (fe_03_00272-A-0032)
I'VE I THINK MANY PEOPLE AFTER SEPTEMBER ELEVEN UH KNOW AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THE MEANING OF TERRORISM  (fe_03_00272-A-0033)
YEAH EXACTLY BEFORE SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH THERE WAS LOTS OF CONFUSION ABOUT UH THE MEANING AND THE DEFINITION OF TERRORISM  (fe_03_00272-A-0034)
YEAH  (fe_03_00272-A-0035)
UH UH I MEAN UH IN GENERAL BEFORE SEPTEMBER ELEVEN MANY PEOPLE HAD UH PROBLEMS WITH THE DEFINITION OF SEPTEMBER ELEVEN  (fe_03_00272-A-0036)
OR WHAT EXACTLY SEPTEMBER ELEVEN BUT AFTER AFTER SEPTEMBER ELEVEN MANY PEOPLE UH LEARN  (fe_03_00272-A-0037)
YEAH THIS IS THE THE POINT  (fe_03_00272-A-0039)
OH OH OKAY IN OKLAHOMA CITY MHM  (fe_03_00272-A-0040)
YEAH  (fe_03_00272-A-0041)
YEAH THAT'S BACK IN  (fe_03_00272-A-0042)
YEAH YEAH YEAH  (fe_03_00272-A-0043)
YEAH  (fe_03_00272-A-0044)
YEAH YEAH  (fe_03_00272-A-0045)
YEAH EVEN THOUGH IT'S VERY BIG IN NEW YORK CITY  (fe_03_00272-A-0046)
UH THE BOMBING IN NEW YORK CITY WAS REALLY VERY BIG ONE  (fe_03_00272-A-0047)
YEAH BUT UH IT IT DIDN'T TAKE YOU KNOW THAT UH MUCH UH ATTENTION FROM THE PEOPLE AND THAT MUCH ATTENTION FROM THE MEDIA LIKE AS COMPARISON  (fe_03_00272-A-0048)
YEAH  (fe_03_00272-A-0049)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_00272-A-0050)
UH YES EXACTLY UH MAYBE UH PEOPLE AND OR PEOPLE OF OKLAHOMA CITY IS MORE TRAINED ON TERRORISM THAN YEAH AND NOW I THINK PEOPLE OF NEW YORK CITY AS MUCH MORE TRAINED ON TERRORISM  (fe_03_00272-A-0051)
SO THIS IS ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OR ONE OF THE GOOD FEATURES OF TERRORISM IS IT MAKES THE PEOPLE MORE PREPARED AND MORE TRAINED ON HOW TO HANDLE THE TERRORISM AND HOW TO PREVENT IT BEFORE IT OCCURS  (fe_03_00272-A-0052)
AND  (fe_03_00272-A-0054)
YEAH AND I THINK NOW OUR COUNTRY IS MUCH MORE PREPARED AND MUCH MORE UM UH TRAINED ON THIS AND PEOPLE ARE MORE PREPARED AND MORE AWARE OF TERRORISM SO NOW I THINK THERE'S UH  (fe_03_00272-A-0055)
LESS LIKELY THAT ANOTHER TERRORISM ACT WILL OCCUR  (fe_03_00272-A-0056)
YES BECAUSE NOW THEY ARE MUCH MORE STANDARD AND MAJOR STAKE AND TO PREVENT AND  (fe_03_00272-A-0057)
TO AVOID UH TERRORISM  (fe_03_00272-A-0058)
YEAH  (fe_03_00272-A-0059)
HOW 'BOUT YOU  (fe_03_00272-A-0062)
OH OKAY  (fe_03_00272-A-0063)
ALL RIGHT  (fe_03_00272-A-0064)
OH SO WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL  (fe_03_00272-A-0065)
UH ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S LESS THAN TEN MINUTES  (fe_03_00272-A-0066)
SO YEAH YEAH  (fe_03_00272-A-0067)
SO I THINK ANOTHER POINT HERE IS THAT UM THE SEPTEMBER ELEVEN WHAT MAKES IT UH SO BIG IS THAT UH THERE ARE ACTUALLY FOUR ACCIDENTS AT THE SAME TIME IT'S NOT JUST ONE  (fe_03_00272-A-0069)
IT'S UH WORLD TRADE CENTER AND YOU KNOW THE PENTAGON  (fe_03_00272-A-0070)
YEAH AND UH  (fe_03_00272-A-0071)
AH THE OTHER TWO UH PLACES SO UH [COUGH] SO THAT'S WHY IT AND THEY ALL AT THE SAME TIME  (fe_03_00272-A-0072)

HELLO  (fe_03_00272-A-0074)

YES UM I THINK THE REAS- THE MAIN REASON I EITHER MENTIONED OR ONE OF THE REASONS WHY SEPTEMBER ELEVEN IS SO BIG BECAUSE UM  (fe_03_00272-A-0076)
THERE ARE FOUR UH ACCIDENTS OR FOUR INCIDENTS AT THE SAME TIME THIS IS ONE THING THE OTHER THING IS THAT  (fe_03_00272-A-0077)
UH WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT BIG TERRORISM FOR A LONG TIME YOU KNOW SINCE UH  (fe_03_00272-A-0078)
YEAH SINCE OKLAHOMA CITY UH WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TERRORISM OR THAT MUCH ACCIDENT EX- EXCEPT SOME AH SCHOOL SHOOTING HERE AND THERE ONLY VERY SMALL  (fe_03_00272-A-0079)
BUT UH LIKE ALL OF A SUDDEN WE HAVE THIS BIG ACCIDENT IN FOUR PLACES THAT'S WAS A SHOCK FOR EVERYONE  (fe_03_00272-A-0080)
YEAH  (fe_03_00272-A-0081)
SO UH WHY DO YOU THINK THAT DO YOU THINK THAT SEPTEMBER ELEVEN HAS UH UH TAKEN A MUCH MORE ATTENTION THAN IT DESERVE OR  (fe_03_00272-A-0082)
UH BECAUSE ACTUALLY UM IT SEEMS THAT IT'S AH IT'S LIKE A WORLD WAR YOU KNOW LIKE WORLD WAR I._I. OR WORLD WAR WAR SO ALL THAT ATTENTION IS UH IT'S A BIG EVENT IT'S  (fe_03_00272-A-0084)
