L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, I'm Cal.
R:  Hi [LAUGH] my name's Bill.
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH] Do you really wanna talk about the problem they put out there today?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Say it again?
R:  I'm sorry, I didn't understand what you said.
L:  Did you want to talk about the topic, September eleventh or did you want to talk about something else?
R:  Oh, I don't care, um ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I honestly ... uh ... I don't think that I've changed really anything about my life since September eleventh so I don't really know how to answer the question.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I haven't either.  I mean, you know ... 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I really don't know how to answer either.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Um, do you remember, like, uh, where you were and everything when you heard uh -- heard about the, uh, attacks?
L:  Oh, ye- oh, yeah, I definitely remember.  I guess it's gonna be like one of those Kennedy things for our generation.  Like, how people always say, "Do you remember where you were when Kennedy got shot?" [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I remember exactly.  I was, uh -- I was in my car on my way to my client's office ... and, uh ... I remember [NOISE] -- actually what I first heard was that a plane had crashed into the World Trade Center.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I thought it was, like, you know, some kind of accident that maybe somebody had knocked the antenna off of the top of it or something.
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  and so I was like, "Damn, that's really messed up.  They just got finished this in this place after that bombing incident".
R:  Right, uh-huh.
L:  And I didn't think anything of it 'cause I was listening to my car radio.  So, then ... I go up to my client's office and nobody's in there.  It's like deserted.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And they left me this note saying, "Oh, we went to, um ... the other --" like, they left me a note saying that they went to one of the other offices because, uh, there was a T.V. there and there was something going on in New [NOISE] to watch.  [MN] So, I was like, okay, fine so decided to walk over there 'cause it wasn't too far from where I work --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they had this little black and white T.V. and everybody was glued to the black and white.  I was, like, what's going on?  They're like ... "The World Trade Center was just attacked!".  I was like, "What?  Oh, baby, are you sure?"  I just heard it was a plane and they were like no [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think it was there that I -- I actually saw the second plane.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- I saw when that happened, so I was like, "Oh, shit!"
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  It's like, this is really happening.  What the hell and it was -- oh ... I remember that.  I remember hearing about it on the car radio and then walking in.  That -- that sucks.
R:  Yeah, that's crazy. 
L:  I know.
R:  I didn't even -- I didn't really even hear about it until after the second plane had, uh ... had hit and I was like [NOISE] -- I was in my office and, um, I got some -- I got some email from one of my friends.  It was like the World Trade Center's on fire and so ... [LIPSMACK] I went and, uh ... I tried to like look online like at C.N.N. or something about the -- the news was and, um ... and I think -- I think I managed to get the story up.  It took forever to connect because everybody must have been connecting --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like trying to read the news or something, and, um ... [LIPSMACK] and then I -- I think I just read that there were two planes crashed and that -- and that the President thought that it was terrorist attack and I was like, "This can't be".  I mean, this can't be right.  It must just be an accident or something like that.
L:  Right.
R:  And then, uh ... and then I went over into the next office and the people there had heard more about it and they had told me about how the ... um, something had crashed into the Pentagon, and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how like the result is panic everywhere and then I was starting to get a little bit ... [LAUGH] freaked out and then one of the people that I shared an office with was on the phone with his wife and she was watching the T.V. and she told us when the, um ... [LIPSMACK] when the towers started to collapse ...
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  And it was like, when I heard that they collapsed, that was like sort of when I -- I don't know, it sort of hit me because I had been in New York like just ... a -- like six months before that at the World Trade -- like, I was at a -- a -- I was at a conference and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it was being held in that Marriott Hotel that was right there at the World Trade Center so I was hanging out there --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for like ... several days ... just a few months before that and I -- I remember like there was one -- this one day when we were -- like, right after we got there, we went outside and we were right next to the towers, you know, and we stood -- you could stand like right next to the base of the tower and look all the way up to the top and I just remember thinking how huge it was, you know, and everything.  And then, when I heard that they had ... collapsed you know, and that it was like irreversible 'cause I -- when I -- when I knew they were on fire and the planes crashed, I thought, "Well, you know, they'll put the fires out and it'll be okay" but then when the buildings fell down I was like, I don't know.  It just kinda hit me and then -- then I was kinda scared 'cause it -- I live in Pittsburgh and they talk about how there was a plane near Pittsburgh --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know and everything.  So ... so, yeah, it was kinda frightening, but ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I remem- I remember trying to call because I have lots of friends who live in the city and I have a cousin who works like ... uh ... I forget who he works for but it was in the World Trade Center --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- and he -- he did not go to work because he wasn't feeling well and also had an aunt who worked in the World Trade Center and she was going late.
R:  Oh.
L:  She had taken a half day and was gonna go in late.
R:  Wow.
L:  But, you know, I didn't know that so I did a -- first I got on my phone because I -- I was at my client's office so I always used their phone first.  So, I quickly dialed the phone and I kept getting the all circuits are busy message.  So, I was like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  "You know what, I'm gonna try my cell phone" so I then get on the cell phone and try and ... I kept getting the same thing.  I was like, oh my God --
R:  Yeah.
L:  What if my family's there.  You know, I have friends who live like in different parts of the city.  Like, they live in the Bronx and in Queens and in Brooklyn and in ... Staten Island and stuff but they're in the city all the time so I was like, oh my God, did they maybe go downtown today?  Who knows?  Like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- one of my girlfriends is an attorney so she's always downtown for whatever reason. 
R:  Right.
L:  So, I was just like --
R: Yeah. 
L:  -- oh my god and it just took forever to even get through.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I -- I do remember that.  That was just sucky.  That was a yucky day.
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] definitely. [NOISE]
L:  And like --
R:  I actually --
L:  -- everything closed.  It was just a pain.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, another thing that kinda freaked me out was that, um ... my sister ... like, um ... her boyfriend's step-dad was actually on the plane that crashed into the Pentagon and so ... 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- like, just having sort of like -- even though I never met the guy, you know, I -- I know my sister's boyfriend but I never met his step-dad or anything like that.
L:  Right.
R:  But still, like, having that personal connection to somebody who was, like, you know ... who was like there you know and ...
L:  That sucks.
R:  Who it -- who it happened to was kinda ... it -- it was pretty scary.
L:  [NOISE] You know what the really sucky thing, not just the crash themselves, but then, like, every day afterwards where they were just giving all these stories about the various people that were on the planes?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And that just fuck because every channel you turned to was you had another family talking about, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about somebody else that died and they had this one particular story was so horrible.  It was like these two best friends ... that had both gotten on each of the one of the planes that were ... that had crashed into the World Trade Center. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They were going on vacation separately and they had taken their children with them.  So, they were --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- both headed to California on two different planes and so -- it so happened that each one of them was on one of those planes.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  And they were each on their -- well, like their first born daughter and they were like, you know, trying to take -- trying to go on vacation together with their daughters so their daughters could grow up to be best friends together like they were.  They were like on their way somewhere to California whatever.
R:  That's so crazy.
L:  I was like, that sucks!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Oh, man.
L:  That just -- then there was like, you know, there was a kid like from a Bronx public school or something that, um, like this was his first plane ride ever and he had won some kind of award or something --
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, he was headed to California also for like the awards ceremony or whatever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then they just showed like the classroom and all his -- all his friends have brought in wreathes and stuff and put it in his chair 'cause of his empty chair in the classroom.
R:  Oh, man.
L:  I was like, that is so fucked up!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like, so bad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like I hate saying it like that but it really is.
R:  Jeez, yeah.
L:  Like, God, this really, really sucks, and it was like you just kept seeing it ... every single minute of the day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like, I'm depressed.  I can't watch this.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  So, do you think -- I thought of one thing like about something to change.  Do you think that you became more patriotic or anything after that happened?
L:  I definitely did.  I actually got to a point where I thought about joining the military.
R:  Oh, really?  Wow.
L:  Yes, I did.  I -- as much as I hate the idea of what the military involves but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I thought about joining the military but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then I decided against it because I -- I really don't want to dedicate my life like that for this country.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I did decide that I am gonna apply to the F.B.I. um ...
R:  Oh, really?  Oh, that's cool.
L:  Yeah, I'm graduating from school this year.  I'm a senior at Draxwell University.
R:  Oh.
L:  I major in computer science, and -- and I'm bilingual so I'm hoping I have a pretty good chance of getting in, but yeah, I -- I figure I'd do them when they're like ... go against terrorism in some kind of way.
R:  Right.
L:  So, uh, yeah, I did decide I am gonna apply to the F.B.I. or get into kin- some kind of computer security field.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Especially the computer forensics.  That's what I'm really interested in, but ...
R:  Well, that's cool.
L:  [inaudible] 'cause I -- I just feel like that's like a calling.  Like, I already -- I already been interested in law enforcement but once this happened ...
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, and then other things keep happening, you know, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how they keep finding out how people are laundering money through this country --
R:  Yeah.
L:  How people are, you know, getting fake IDs and passports and you know, they're creating whole fake lives just 'cause they can get in and cause havoc in here.
R:  Right.
L:  But you know what?  This is craziness.  You know, people need to step up and do something about this.  I mean, we can only do so much as citizens.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I was like -- I definitely became more -- you know, patriotic ambassador so that I wanted to help, you know, protect the country against future ... attacks --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and invasions and stuff like that.  But --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- yeah, I got to the point where I was ready to sign up, like to go to the Navy or something.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I really do and I had a lot of friends that were like that too.  Like friends with families --
R:  Wow.
L:  They were like, yeah, you know -- 'cause I was talking about what a friend I hadn't seen in a few years this past weekend and he was like, he has a wife and three kids and he was like, "You know what?   I really was about to join the military".
R:  Wow.
L:  He was like you have no idea.  He was like -- 'cause all I kept thinking about was what if they come attack my town?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or what if they blow up my kids' school, or you know, a bridge that my wife is riding on or something.  He was like, "I'd go crazy".  I was like, man, I understand.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  It would be a big -- yeah.  That'd be like a pretty big sacrifice so -- if you have a family and like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have to go away.
L:  Yeah.  But I think that's just -- you know, like, that's how strongly some people felt about it because this was like ... as -- whatever problems you may have with the way this country is run ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because, you know, a lot of people do.  You know, people don't like the politics, they don't like the law, they don't like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the people making the laws.  But it's still a great country.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It has -- it has a nasty history.  It has a -- you know, some good parts of its history.  It has good and nasty people but, oh no, it's a great -- it's the best -- it's the greatest country the world's ever seen.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, at least this world's ever seen.  So, it's like, I want --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- us to stay this way as long as possible.  Or at least for my lifetime.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, like -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I mean, yeah.
L:  basically every great, you know, empire does meet its end, you know, but ... the United States has been going what?  About four or five hundred years now or whatever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they're still going pretty strong so I mean, I -- I think it will eventually have a downfall like every other great empire but ... not in our lifetime.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I would hope not, and I -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And when all that stuff happens and then you see like the other news reports about how -- like you know how Bin Laden keeps sending these stupid video tapes everywhere.
R:  Right.
L:  I'm like why don't you capture that?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, find the guy who's handing over these video tapes and make him tell you.  I'm sure the U.S. has a way to make people tell them, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I don't know where they get those videotapes.  I mean, how do they -- do they just arrive in the mail or what?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  [LAUGH]
L:  That's what I wanna know.  I'm just like, what the hell's going on?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm like, somebody has to know -- you know, somebody has to know what the common link is.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  So, maybe it's like if they got spies or something, you know, they can't -- I don't know.  I don't know --
