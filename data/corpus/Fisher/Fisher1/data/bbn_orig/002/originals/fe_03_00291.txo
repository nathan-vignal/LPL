R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  My name's John.
L:  Hi.  M- -- my name's Mike.
R:  Hi, nice to meet ya.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh --
L:  W-- where you calling from?
R:  New York City.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yourself?
L:  Um, down near Philadelphia, ah, near Valley Fort, sort of out in the suburbs.
R:  Oh, okay.  Everybody I've talked to seems to be from that neighborhood.  I guess there's a lot of peop- -- you -- you affiliated with, ah, U Penn?
L:  No.
R:  Oh.
L:  I -- actually but that would be, ah, that would be appropriate since U Penn's down there, but, ah, no, I work for Unisys.  Ah ...
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I don't know if you've heard of them before.
R:  The computer company?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  How'd you get involved with this?
L:  Well, we do speech recognition here, um --
R:  Oh.
L:  I'm in their communications, ah, group and, um, they, ah, they built, um, mainframe based telephone answering systems for telephone companies --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- and, you know, so, part of that these days is speech recognition. So, yeah, we got hooked up with, ah, with the, um, um, with linguistic, ah, consortium --
R:  The LDC --
L:  -- LDC, ah, you know, in -- in getting, um, [inaudible] for, ah, you know, for testing speech recognition engines and stuff like that.
R:  Neat.
L:  So, now we're making 'em [LAUGH].
R:  So --
L:  That's cool.
R:  -- you're making, what?
L:  Well, what -- now you and I are creating that database.
R:  Oh.  Exactly.
L:  Yeah, that's cool.
R:  Oh, so you guys are creating the stuff that allows me to say, "I want the number for Joe's Pizzeria" and a computer can listen to that?
L:  Right.  Or, if you -- if you, ah, logon to American Airlines, I think they have, ah, a voice based, um, system for getting information on flights.
R:  On the web?
L:  Oh, no, not on the web.
R:  Oh, just if you call, right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  If you call in.  It's all phone based stuff.
R:  And I say, "I want to go to Chicago"?
L:  Right.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, that's neat.  I -- I hadn't ever thought of there being an overlap between, ah, the linguistic people and the computer people, but of course there are.
L:  Oh, yeah.  In fact, Microsoft has a, ah, has a speech based browser for -- you can -- you can download a plug in to your browser and you can write, um, you can write XML that has speech recognition, ah, tags in it --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- so, you know, once you have this e- -- free plug in for your browser --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- it loads a speech recognition engine and a, um, text to speech engine on your -- on your PC --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  --which you can see in your, ah, you know, you configure it in your, um [MN], ah control panel and it loads a, ah, it installs a, um, ah, a whatever you need to recognize these new speech recognition tags where, you know, it'll be a voice XML tag, instead of displaying something in a certain font, it says, "Here, say this to the user" and it comes out over your speakers and then you say, "Now, let the user say one of these things" and then when you say that, if you have a microphone --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that goes to your sound card and tries to listen to the microphone, you know, if it hears you say one of those things, it'll trigger that then, then you go display on a web page or, you know --
R:  That's really cool.
L:  -- go -- go do some function.  So, it's neat.
R:  How far a- away are we from an era without keyboards?  I mean, we'll always have them, but --
L:  I think we'll always have keyboards, yeah.
R: -- but in terms of we won't really need them as much, ah --
L:  Yeah, well, well, um, I think where it's really going to take off is -- is in, um, the handheld devices --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- where it's really a nuisance to use a keyboard, you know.  You know, a mouse is pretty easy to use --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and speech recognition always has the problem of, you know, if somebody's in your office talking or something like that, there's background noise, that kind of thing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, you know, if you really want to, ah, really want to definitely, you know, tell your computer, do this --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- pointing and clicking is easier, but -- but with a handheld device, if you want to enter then, you know, enter the name "Boston" as your destination, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, ah, it'd be a lot faster to speak it if, ah, if you're in the right environment to do that.
R:  That's intriguing.  I -- most of the technology stuff I -- I don't keep up with that much just cause I -- I find it's hard to keep up with --
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  -- as -- as a layperson and I'm -- I'm annoyed by it when it changes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah for change's sake, rather than for everybody's convenience --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, you know, I just upgraded my computer system, ah, and it d- -- you know, performs marginally better, but mostly it's just different.  [MN]
L:  It's a hassle, um, upgrading, I mean, man, it seems like everytime you upgrade your computer something breaks.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Something doesn't work that used to work.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Or you have to upgrade something else.
L:  Well, what I've learned at least from my home computer is, you know, don't ever upgrade the operating system, whatever it came with is what it'll work best with --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and when you upgrade you'll always, you know, you'll lose a few -- some functionality and it'll always run slower --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that kind of thing, so ... you know, I try to just live as long as I can with what it came with, you know --
R:  Right.
L: -- and not mess around with that.
R:  Yeah, no, I -- I have a computer I've had since nineteen ninety four and I just upgraded it to, um, Mac O.S. nine one --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which is still, you know, two generations back, um, but I -- I resent the idea of having to replace the whole thing, which I'm going to have to do at some point soon, ah, just cause every -- you know, the world is -- is traveling too fast.  But, ah --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  My -- both my son and my daughter, ah, are Mac fans --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  Um, my, um, my daughter's in, ah, she- -- she's in New York, she's, ah, at Pride Institute --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  Do you know that?  You know it?
R:  Yeah, I -- yeah, sure.
L:  And, ah, so she's there.
R:  Uh huh.
L:  She's in architecture, so she uses a lot of drawing and graphic stuff --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and then -- and my son is, ah, he's interested in, um, you know, video production and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that kind of stuff, so he got -- [MN] they have terrific Mac tools for that, you know, for -- for moviemaker and, you know, taking video clips and editing them and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- special effects and, you know, mixing and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- matching and merging all the -- all this --
R:  And Mac is -- is particularly good for that kind of stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm surprised about you -- your daughter, though, because I have architects who are, ah, friends and they work entirely in PC just because --
L:  Cause of Autocad?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Well, there's a couple of, um, you know, of Mac, ah, drawing programs, too, but y- -- you're right, you're right.  There is -- there's, you know, the- -- there's two camps of -- of architecture people [MN] if you get, you know, if you work in a -- in an office where they've -- they've got the Mac, you know, the Mac Suite, then, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- whatever it's called, I don't know, then, uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- they're in good shape.  But -- but she likes the Mac a lot better.  She uses a -- she's also taken some photography courses --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- you know, and sh- -- you know, they -- photography these days, you know, they -- they still have the wet labs and they do all the work in there, but they also digitize it and mess around with it and --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- and do a lot of sp- -- you know, effects on the computer, too --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, ah, you know, they, um, they -- she -- she prefers a Mac for that.
R:  Yeah.  Now, we -- we haven't spoken one word about the topic --
L:  Oh, shame on us.
R:  -- that was suggested.  Well, let me ask, since you're the computer guy, um, I -- I assume that it doesn't actually matter that the -- the topics are -- are nice to have, but they're really just to direct conversation and that the aim of this --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- study is to create a database of -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- or a volume of words.
L:  Right.  I think so, too.
R:  So, so that we could be -- as long as they're English and they're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- complete sentences or incomplete sentences --
L:  So, some poor sap's got to sit down and translate this?
R:  Well -- well, are they --
L:  Yeah, or transcribe this.
R:  -- or are they going to use a computer to do it?  Is -- is --
L:  Um, well, you know, you can use a computer to do it, but -- but then it's going be only as accurate as the computer is --
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  -- your -- then -- then your database is corrupted and your -- you're telling another computer, "Hey, when you hear this, it means whatever the computer thought it meant the first time it heard it", so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- no, they really, no, I think the databases are -- are hand transcribed --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and th- -- then they become the masters for -- for new work.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, so it's got to be correct.  If it's got bugs in it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or, you know, then -- then -- then it's -- it's -- you're just counterproductive, so, yeah, because --
R:  So, this -- this is how mistakes get institutionalized, right?  They use --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the computer to analyze our speech and then the b- -- for the purpose of using computers to analyze --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- speech [LAUGH].
L:  So, uh, so [inaudible] saying, Hello, to the person who's transcribing this [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Well, it would make his day a little more interesting to know that he's not, ah, working, you know, like the Wizard of Oz, he's not --
L:  I wonder what they're getting paid to do that.
R:  Probably ten bucks an hour.
L:  Probably.
R:  Right?  I mean, they'd get college kids, I would assume.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Our job's easier.
R:  Yeah, right [LAUGH].
L:  So, where -- where do you work?
R:  I work at home.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  Ah.
L:  And -- and you're in -- you're in the city?
R:  Yeah.  Ah, my wife and I both work out of our house and, ah, I do a lot of, ah, English as a second language textbooks.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  And so I -- I had a piece in the Times magazine over the summer about, um, the, um, the national corporates, ah, so that's how I got involved in this.  Um, and, ah, so, yeah, I have a -- a vested int- -- not a vested interest, but a -- an amateur interest in seeing this, ah, done.  I assume that this is part of the ANC is that to your knowledge?
L:  ANC?
R:  American National Corpus?
L:  Maybe.  I don't know.
R:  I think that's what this -- maybe it's not, maybe it's just another corpus, but --
L:  Yeah.  We've always joined the, um, ah, LDC, um, just to get access to their -- their CDs and --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- and data.  So, um, to put --
R:  My understanding of the American National Corpus was the first really broadbased corpus --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- of language in that the -- the LDC was -- was undertaking it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah and what they had done -- some of it's out, but it's all the written, it's like the first ten million words of a hundred million word corpus.
L:  Wow.
R:  But it's all the written stuff and they hadn't done any of the spoken language --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, when -- as soon as I got the email, I forwarded it to all my, ah, friends who -- whose English I respected and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, spoke correctly and things like that.
L:  Cool.
R:  Um, so, I thought it was really interesting.  Um, today's topic, though, sounds just like yesterday's topic.  Ah ...
L:  [inaudible] yesterday as well as I wasn't near my desk, I didn't take any calls, but --
R:  It was like --
L:  -- got some messages about it.
R:  -- basically the same thing.  It was like, ah, has anything changed since September eleven?
L:  Oh.  Okay.  Yeah, September eleventh.  I don't know.  Um, I -- I think they'll find another way [LAUGH] to, ah --
R:  To couch the same --
L:  Yeah.  I mean, as far as blowing up things with airplanes, you know, I think they'll try something else next.  As far as keeping, you know, controlling people and knowing who's going, I think, yeah, I -- I think -- I think they're going to -- they have a lot of plans, in fact Unisys has some contracts in that area --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- you know, I mean, they can do iris scans and face scans and hand and fingerprint scans and -- and that -- you know, I think they'll improve security [inaudible] so they know who's going in and the turnstile and who's getting on the plane.
R:  Should we be afraid of that?
L:  Um, I don't know.  I -- I -- I think they'll -- they'll probably use it make, ah, you know, I wouldn't be afraid of that anymore than the fact that I swipe my credit card in all kinds of slots, in the foodstore and every bank machine [MN] all -- everywhere I go, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, you know, they know who you are and where you are, so what -- what's the difference between that and an iris scan, it's like, okay, it's this person and now that he's here, he's just went in through the door.
R:  Um, because the government can have it.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.
R:  That's what I don't like.
L:  That's true.
R:  Ah, like I won't pay -- I won't use the EZ-pass --
L:  Uh huh.
R:  Because I don't really like the government knowing where I'm going.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, and like you can -- here in the city, you can pay for your, um, your subway card with a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with a credit card --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but again, I won't -- I won't do that because I don't really want the city knowing exactly what my movements are at all times.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and things like iris scans scare the crap out of me, because, you know, they can use their powers for evil, too.
