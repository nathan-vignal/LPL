L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  I'm Debbie.
R:  I'm Kelly.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  Nice to meet you.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Nice to meet you.  Um, I don't know who wants to start.
R:  Oh, it doesn't matter to me.
L:  Um.
R:  Um, where are you from, by the way?
L:  I'm from Wisconsin.  Where are you from?
R:  Okay.  I'm from Texas.
L:  Okay.  Um, have you traveled since September eleventh?
R:  I travel a lot, I'm a college student here in -- in Boston --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- ah, so I travel back and forth from Texas quite a bit [SIGH].
L:  Okay.  Um, I actually haven't traveled, um, since September eleventh --
R:  Really?
L:  -- but prior to that I traveled a lot and a lot internationally.  So, I'm familiar with how other countries, um, dealt with security issues --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and what it was like before September eleventh and the comparison --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so --
R:  Um, d- -- have you -- d- -- are you not traveling anymore because of September eleventh --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- or that -- is that just --
L:  No.  It's just, um, I've got married, got a purp- -- full time job [LAUGH] --
R:  I see.
L:  -- my life has just changed, so I'm not --
R:  I understand.
L:  Yeah.  When I was in college I traveled a lot more and now I've settled down a bit, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, let's see.  Do you think it helps since you've traveled since, do you --
R:  Yeah, I -- I think -- I think it helps quite a bit.  Um, it's a bit more intimidating to go through security and I -- I -- I bet that's some sort of a deterrent, but, ah, I -- I don't know.  I just recently flew home for Thanksgiving and, um, I got to the airport two or three hours early and I got through security just fine in probably less than five minutes.  So --
L:  Do -- do you think --
R:  -- I think it really depends.  It varies.
L:  Do you think that you could have hidden anything and maybe it wouldn't have been found?
R:  Well, u- um, actually, to tell you the truth, I was carrying my backpack and I had a pair of fingernail clippers in my backpack and they didn't find them.
L:  They didn't?
R:  I didn't realise that until -- it wasn't like I was trying to sneak it on, but I didn't realise I had those until I got on the plane and it w- -- they wouldn't have been difficult to find, they're in a little small pocket all by themselves --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, um, yeah, I -- I -- I- that sort of makes me uncomfortable since they're looking for that kind of thing and they didn't find it.
L:  And I would think that the metal detector would have set that off --
R:  Right.  
L:  -- that it would have--
R:  Right.  I put it through the scanner and everything and they didn't find it.  So --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or they didn't decide to take it.  I don't know.
L:  Do they give, like, lists of things that you're not allowed to bring with you in that --
R:  You can find lists some places, more like around the check in area --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- when you go to check in your bags and stuff, they'll have a list -- or, they used to, anyway, ah, have a list of things that you can bring on the plane --
L:  And -- and --
R:  -- and, ah, they -- they used to ask.  They haven't -- they haven't asked me recently, ah, but they used to ask if you had any of those things to put them in your checked luggage.
L:  And fingernail clippers were one of those?
R:  Fingernail clippers, fingernail files --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, any sort of aerosol can.  I found, ah,  mostly when I -- when I traveled to Mexico last year, um, they wouldn't let me bring my hairspray --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- because it's in an aerosol can.  Even if I put in my checked luggage.  So, I don't know.  It -- it -- it tends to vary from airport to airport, I think.
L:  Yeah.  Well, now that you've said Mexico, how silly of me, I forgot, I went to Mexico in March.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  So -- so, I have traveled since September eleventh.  I forgot about the trip to Mexico.
R:  Where did you go?
L:  Um, I flew into Mexico City, so we -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- we flew from O'Hare, from Chicago to Atlanta --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- and then from Atlanta to Mexico City.
R:  Yeah.  I was actually in Mexico in March, too.  
L:  Oh.
R:  So, that's interesting [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  And then we went to, um, [inaudible].
R:  Okay.  I was in Porto Viata[?] pretty much --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- the whole time.  So, that's pretty cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but, yeah, coming back it was pretty -- it was easy getting there, but coming back --
L:  Coming -- yeah.
R:  -- they went through everything.
L:  I, um, I have a friend who was six months pregnant at the time --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and they were doing routine checks --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and she just happened to be one of the people who she -- who got checked --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they made me take off my shoes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, i- -- they had a female security person pad me down --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and opened all my bags, so now that I think about it, now that you reminded me of Mexico --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it -- it was -- although from like to Chi- -- from Chicago to Atlanta --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- I didn't feel that that was any big deal --
R:  Right.
L:  -- really.
R:  A- actually, um, I'm not sure if -- if you know this, but -- or if they had it where you were, they, ah, they've set up a security check right before you get on the airplane, so even once you get through the original --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- security check gates, you could be randomly selected, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, I got -- I -- I got randomly selected, um, going -- coming back up here to Boston for the rest of the school semester.  Um, I got selected in Dallas, I guess it was, and they pulled me aside and they went through all my backpack and they made me take off my shoes and they did the little --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- pat me down thing with the metal detector thing --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and, um, it's -- it -- it was really interesting and I don't know, I'd never been picked to do that before, that was the first time I'd ever been pulled aside for that I -- I've traveled quite a bit --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I've seen a lot of other people get pulled aside.  But it's also sort of predictable who they're going to pull out of the line.
L:  See, I wasn't able to predict it.  I'd -- I kind of thought that they were doing like every fifth person, or a numerical order.
R:  Right.  Well, I-- I'm not saying like they would select certain types of people, really --
L:  Yeah.  Oh --
R:  -- but it w- -- it was more like if they were finishing up with somebody at the table, then they were going to pick somebody pretty soon.
L:  I mean -- yeah.
R:  You know --
L:  So --
R:  -- whenever -- whenever the table was empty, the next person had to go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I don't -- but that's the method I've seen.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I felt -- I feel pretty comfortable.  I mean, I've always felt pretty comfortable on the planes before, um --
L:  Yeah.  I had never been nervous, [inaudible] even going to Mexico --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I really wasn't, um, the heightened security makes me feel safer and I think what you said about people just, you know, maybe not trying something --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because it's more difficult now --
R:  Right.
L:  -- than it was before, um, but I don't know.  I still -- there's a part of me that thinks if someone wants to do something, they'll find a way.
R:  Exactly.  I -- I really think that's true.  And I've -- I've seen, you know, how the people get their shoes scanned [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they'll scan it and it'll beep and stuff, but they'll just assume that the shoe has a metal toe or something.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, I -- I don't know.  After that shoe bombing thing, that doesn't make me too --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I mean, they're scanning the shoe, fine, but, I mean, it doesn't make me feel comfortable as to think that they're really finding anything.  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I, a- -- I agree with you, I think if somebody really wanted to get something on the plane, they probably could.
L:  Yeah.  And at this point I would think that i- it's -- if they're going to do something, it's not going to do as -- be as predictable --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they're not going to do something similar to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what happened on September eleventh.
R:  I agree.
L:  And so they're looking for something that people know they're looking for.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I'm -- I'm -- I'm not completely uncomfortable because I -- I just don't feel that the majority of people are going to try to do something and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and yet in the same token, I think that, yeah, if someone wants to get away with something, they'll find a way.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  So, I don't know, I -- I still fly quite a bit, actually probably more just out of circumstance, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- since September eleventh, flying back and forth to home and what not.  Um, and I actually fly out of Logan, which is, you know, where it all --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- started, but, um, they've -- they've been really intense with airport security up here.  I think it's probably one of the most security intense airports --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I've been to --
L:  I'm sure it is.
R:  -- since September eleventh.
L:  Well, I was in, um, I was in London back in nineteen, I think it was eighty nine --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- after the Lockerbee plane --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  --after that situation and London, the airport was just so secure.  It was -- it was scary to me because I was eighteen and -- 
R:  Wow.
L:  -- they were so intense --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and being cautious and here I am, this young American eighteen year old and they were tearing apart my bags and they were taking lenses off my camera and --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  -- yeah, they were being just very, um, watchful.  But I -- I guess that same situation, the airport --
R:  Right.
L:  -- where it originated from, that's going to be the place that needs to be the most cautious.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  I flew to Italy this summer and spent some time there and I didn't find any trouble going -- getting in and out of that airport.  I think that prob- -- the Rome airport would probably be, I'd say it's probably one of the easiest ways to get -- get away with --
L:  Oh, really.
R:  -- um, sneaking stuff on.  But, um, I don't know, maybe they had people watching and what not, but i- -- it was probably one of the -- the easiest ways to get through security I've seen --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and customs and what not.  So --
L:  Hm.  Interesting the differences --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.
L:  [SIGH] Well, I don't know how long --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- did they give a time limit for this?
R:  Well, how -- how's the weather in Wisconsin?
L:  Um, actually it was forty five degrees today.
R:  Oh, really?  That's really nice.
L:  It has been almost too nice because Christmas is so close and I'm used to snow on Christmas time --
R:  Right.  Definitely.
L:  -- at Christmas time.  So, I'm getting a little bit worried that we're not going to have any --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for Christmas.  How's the weather in Boston?
R:  We've had quite a bit of snow and rain and sleet and what not.  Today was really nice.  Um, actually it got up to about forty eight --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, but tomorrow it -- we kind of have a breather as today and tomorrow it's going to get sleety and snowy and rainy and what not --
L:  Yeah.  Is this --
R:  -- so --
L:  -- is this your first year there?
R:  Actually, it's my second.
L:  Your second.
R:  So, ah -- but this is really the first cold winter we've had.  I mean, last winter was really, really mild.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a difference going from Texas.
R:  [inaudible] it's -- it's been really interesting, I really like it [inaudible].
L:  Are you still there?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think we're getting cut off.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  [NOISE]  Hello?
