R:  [NOISE] Good intro.  Hello. [LAUGH]
L:  Kulud Kelarney[?].
R:  What was your name?
L:  Kulud Kelarney.
R:  Oh, right.  I'm Jennifer. 
L:  Hi.  How are you?
R:  I am good.  How are you?
L:  I am good.  We are supposed to talk about, uh, uh, September eleventh today?
R:  Yes, yes, and so --
L:  And --
R:  Did you know anyone in it?
L:  Um, no.  [MN] How 'bout you?
R:  No, and so I was in Oklahoma.  I didn't know anyone from there.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, uh, can you tell me how, uh, this, uh, the attack of September eleven, uh, changed or affected your life?
R:  [LAUGH] I don't kn- I don't know.  Like, it made me more aware of terrorism [SIGH] and so I'd never been aware of it.  I live in a little town and nothing bad ever happens and it made me feel that things could happen and [MN] [LIPSMACK] things like happen to normal people and you wouldn't expect it and I want to live in New York and that just really scares me.  That something like that could happen 'cause I fly a lot.  And so, how 'bout you?
L:  Yeah, it also, uh, scared me a lot.  Uh, I was here in Houston and, uh, I heard about it from the people and, um, uh, first I, uh, didn't think that it is that big and, uh, later on, uh, when you see, uh, after the -- we have seen that it's really very big.  It's not, uh, something small.  Maybe the biggest thing, uh, that we have seen in our life.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.  Did you see the pictures of it?
L:  Uh, yes, on the TV and in the internet.
R:  Yes.  [NOISE] Right, and so have you ever been there before?
L:  Uh, never.  Uh, we've been, uh, to New York, me and my husband, uh, been, uh, in New York, uh, but not in, uh -- in Manhattan, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, in upstate New York.
R:  Oh, and so yeah, I've been, um, actually to the World Trade Center and ...
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, I wen- um, about three years before it happened.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [MN] So, yeah, I was really interesting.  Went to see how it happened --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- and what happened to it.
L:  Oh, okay --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and when did you first hear about it?
R:  Um, I was at school and -- and we -- our class just got cancelled.  [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And [inaudible] home, and so -- because they were, um -- closed all of [inaudible] air force base and so they sent everyone home in case something happened.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so, um, yeah, and I went home and my roommate and I watched it but after the bay on TV.
L:  Yes.
R:  And so --
L:  This is, uh --
R:  -- were you at work or at school or ...?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, uh, we work -- we were actually on the street and, uh, when we heard about it, um, we just rushed to home and, uh, we were actually exactly in the street going to a doctor for a doctor visit --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and in the doctor, it was very crowded and very [inaudible] there because they, uh ... they want to finish everybody and send everybody home so, uh, it was really a very terrible and everybody was scared and nobody is, uh -- can figure out what's happening.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  So, do you consider it, ah, ah, like tourism?
R:  Oh, yes, definitely.  What about you?
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.  And it's [COUGH] -- I didn't know though what the meaning of terrorism until this moment, you know?  Until the September eleventh so, uh, it's -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's, uh -- it's -- I've -- I think many people after September eleven, uh, know and figure out what the meaning of terrorism.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Before September eleventh there was lots of confusion about, uh, the meaning and the definition of terrorism.
R:  Yes, and so what's your definition?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What is it?
L:  Uh, uh, I mean, uh, in general ... before September eleven, many --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people had, uh, problems with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the definition of September eleven or what exactly September eleven, but after -- after September eleven, many people, uh, learn ... what is, uh, terrorism.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, this is the -- the point.
R:  Yeah, it is and I don't really [several inaudible words] what it is 'cause I never really experienced it or feel it and -- well, actually, I take that back.  I live in Oklahoma so, um, we had a bombing here.
L:  Oh, oh, okay.  In Oklahoma city?
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so I was like by there and so I was like, how did it affect me, but y- it was a ... you know, it was within the nation and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- it wasn't as scary, just thinking of it --
L:  Yeah, that's back in --
R:  -- one -- one little group of people had something out against us.  That's not too scary, but when a whole country, you know ...?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- has something against you, it's kinda frightening and so it hit me -- really big -- there was a really big difference between what happened in Oklahoma and in New York city.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And so -- like, New York -- I mean, I knew people in the Oklahoma city bombing but it was not as big as in New York city.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, even though it's very big in New York city, uh, the bombing in New York city was really very big one.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, but uh, it -- it didn't take, you know, that, uh, much, uh, attention from the people and that much attention from the media, like as comparison.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  And I don't know, like, I think that people learned more from the September eleventh [inaudible] you know, like they became more aware of terrorism and they became more cautious and security got tighter and I think it was a good lesson --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, on terrorism.
L:  Exactly.  Uh, yes, exactly.  Uh, maybe, uh, people and -- or people of Oklahoma city is more trained on terrorism than --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  And now I think people of New York city as much more trained on terrorism.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, this is one of the advantages or one of the good features of terrorism is it makes the people more prepared and more trained on how to handle the terrorism and how to prevent it before it occurs.
R:  Right.  And so I agree with that totally.
L:  Yes.
R:  So, as scary as it was --
L:  And --
R:  -- we were [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, and I think now our country is much more prepared and much more, um ... uh, trained on this and people are more prepared and more aware of terrorism.  So, now I think there's, uh, less likely that another terrorism act will occur.
R:  Do you think so?
L:  Yes, because now they are much more standard and major stake and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to prevent and to avoid, uh, terrorism.
R:  [MN] Right.  And so, yes, I think we'll be much better prepared for it next time around.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that, um ... not that that's a good thing necessarily but we have to learn the hard way but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at least we'll be prepared [LAUGH] if it happens again.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so [LAUGH] ...
L:  Okay.
R:  Do you have any other questions?  I can't really think of anything else?
L:  Ah, no.  How 'bout you?
R:  Um, no, not really.
L:  Oh, okay.  All right.
R:  It's, uh -- well, don't we have to wait 'til it tells us to ... you know, our time is up; the recording has stopped?
L:  Oh, so we have to wait until ...?
R:  Yeah, it tells you.  It's like [SIGH] ten minutes or something.  Do you know how long we've been talking?
L:  Uh, actually I think it's less than ten minutes so ...
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Okay.  I -- I get nervous so yesterday, but [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah.  So, I think another point here is that, um, the September eleven, what makes it, uh, so big is that, uh, there are actually four accidents at the same time.  It's not just one --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [several inaudible words].  It's, uh, World Trade Center and, you know, the Pentagon, yeah, and, uh ... ah, the other two, uh, places so, uh [COUGH], so that's why it -- and they all at the same time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, they all -- all of a sudden so nobody have sort of a [inaudible].  I mean, for a long time, you know, since Oklahoma city there was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [several inaudible words].  Hello?
R:  [NOISE] Are you there?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, I'm sorry.  My phone cut out [COUGH] and so I couldn't hear you for a second.
L:  Yes.  Um, I think the reas- the main reason I either mentioned, or one of the reasons why September eleven is so big, because, um, there are four, uh, accidents, or four incidents at the same time.  This is one thing.  The other thing is that ... uh, we didn't have that big terrorism for a long time, you know?  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Since, uh -- yeah, since Oklahoma city, uh, we didn't have that much terrorism or that much accident.  Ex- except some, ah, school shooting here and there, only very small, but, uh, like all of a sudden we have this --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- big accident --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in four places.  That's was a shock for everyone.
R:  Yes.  And so it got this trail.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, uh, why do you think that -- do you think that September eleven has, uh -- uh, taken a much more attention than it deserve or ...?
R:  Oh, definitely, yeah.  And so do you?
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  Why do you think that?
L:  Uh, because actually, um, it seems that it's -- ah, it's like a world war, you know?  Like World War II or World War -- war --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so all that attention is, uh -- it's a big event.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's very big.
R:  That's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it shouldn't have been that big.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.  They got too much attention from it.
L:  Yeah.  Uh, let me ask you, are you sure that we have to wait until, uh, the robot prompts us to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hang up?
R:  Yeah, and so it'll say ... and so I don't know when.  Maybe not.  It sounds like it's been longer.
L:  Yeah.  So, it this your first time doing this, uh, study?
R:  No.  It's my second.
L:  Oh, oh, so you, uh ... okay.  Yeah.
R:  And so I don't -- I don't know where it should have said that already.
L:  Yeah.  I think now we are, uh, over ten minutes.
R:  Oh, okay.  And so about time, so, uh it -- this was interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Mm.
L:  So, uh, we have to wait until, uh ... we get the, uh ... signal from ...?
R:  Um, I guess not.
L:  Uh.
R:  And so I thought so but it's been a long time.
L:  Oh, okay.  A long time.
R:  I don't know and so we don't have to and so we can end it.
L:  Eh, but, uh, you haven't participated in this, uh, particular study in this Fisher study?
R:  No.
L:  It's first time?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay, because I didn't read anywhere that we have to ...
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- continue so I can -- maybe we have -- we can hang up.
R:  Okay, that's fine.
L:  Okay?
R:  Uh-huh.  Bye.
L:  Okay, nice talking with you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Bye.
R:  [NOISE]
