R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, this is Dave.
L:  I'm Christina.
R:  Hi.  Um, how are you?
L:  I'm good.  How are you?
R:  Good.  Have you done these before?
L:  No.
R:  Oh --
L:  I haven't.
R:  -- I did one yesterday.  So, we're supposed to talk about what we're looking for in life partners.
L:  Right.
R:  Okay, um, I guess what I would look for in a life partner is just compatibility, somebody you get along with and somebody who can make me laugh, I guess.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think that I would like someone that is reliable --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and funny.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like you said.  Uh [LAUGH].  I know, do they want the whole list? [LAUGH]
R:  I guess we gotta talk for ten minutes about this.  [LAUGH]
L:  We have to talk for ten minutes?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a ten minute thing.
L:  About the one question?
R:  Well, yesterday it kind of got off topic but I think so, yeah.  I think we're supposed to talk -- they ask, please stay on the subject.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um ...
L:  Life partners.
R:  Mhm, it's kind of a weird topic --
L:  It's very weird.
R:  -- to talk to a stranger about, but [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Um ...
R:  Where are you calling from?
L:  I'm in New York.
R:  Uh-huh.  Manhattan?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Where are you?
R:  In, uh -- outside of Boston --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- in Lexington.
L:  Oh.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I know people from around there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um [COUGH], I don't really know what to say about life partners.
R:  Um ...
L:  It's a tough subject.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it is.  Um, I don't know.  I'm divorced myself so ...
L:  Oh.
R:  Uh, uh ...
L:  I've never been married.
R:  Uh-huh.  Um, so I guess I'm back looking, but I haven't been looking that hard.
L:  [LAUGH] How long have you been divorced?
R:  Uh ... three years.
L:  Mm.  Yeah, that's tough.
R:  [MN] Had a couple of kids.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Do your kids live in Boston?
R:  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, they live in the same town as I do --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- so ... least I see them ... [MN] regularly.
L:  That's good.
R:  Uh ... there's -- sorry?
L:  Yeah?
R:  There's, um [LIPSMACK] -- there are all these, uh, online dating services now and lots of ... uh, ways to meet people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that weren't available, even ten years ago.
L:  Yeah.  I actual- I can't believe I'm admitting this, but I've -- I actually do one of those.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's all right.
R:  Yeah?
L:  I mean, I think it's -- you have to think of it as sort of the same sampling of people that you might meet randomly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- sort of out in the world.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And if you look at it that way, then I guess it's not a big deal.  Like, if you just don't take it that seriously --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and kind of ... [COUGH] don't have it be the focus of your life.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and just sort of one thing that you do on the side in addition to all the normal --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- things you do anyway.
R:  Right.
L:  I think it's not bad.
R:  Have you met people through it?
L:  I have.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I've met, like, a bunch of people actually but ... no one that I really -- I never, um, went out with any of 'em again actually except for one.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So ...
R:  Uh-huh.  And how long have you been a member of that service?
L:  I joined it in, um, like, I think May or June.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But there have been like stretches of time where I haven't done it at all for like a month or two because I was too busy doin' other stuff.
R:  And you -- you rate -- what do you rate your interests and what you're looking for and ...?
L:  Yeah, you ra- they basically find out every -- you know, everything about you like your age, your height, your -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- hair color, like, your religion, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  There's this whole list of things.  You don't have to answer if you don't want to but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- everybody --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- pretty much does --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then you can either post your picture or not.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't have mine up just 'cause I don't like having my picture on the internet.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um -- and then there's two sections like you write about yourself and then you write about what you're looking for.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And then once you're in it, you can search like the whole database.  Supposedly there's like, you know, like two hundred thousand people or you know they're supposed to -- or maybe more than that --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- like in it.
R:  Is it a national --
L:  It's match --
R:  -- or is it --
L:  It's match dot com.
R:  Match dot com?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is there a cost to that one?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's like seventeen dollars a month.
R:  A month?  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.  Is that about right?  Is that about the going rate --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- for those things?
L:  It's the only thing I've ever ... done.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  So ...
R:  There're all kinds of 'em now, every -- like, the Boston Globe --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- has one.  There's all kinds of --
L:  I would recommend Match --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because I think it's the one that most people know about which is good because you'd think that -- that they would maybe be that many more people on it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it's not sort of like a self selected bunch of people that -- you know, it's like more popular.
R:  Right.  And -- and -- so, it -- it's a national thing, right?  Sort of, the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- database is --
L:  It's international actually.
R:  International?
L:  Yeah, you can search like anywhere you're interested in looking --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like any -- you can search by like basically any criteria you want.  Like, someone's height, where they live, how old they are ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Pick anything.
R:  Oh, cool.  Look into that.
L:  But I -- I would recommend it but just like sort of take it with a grain of salt you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I think.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's better than nothing.  I live in, uh -- in a suburban community where it's kinda hard to meet single people so ...
L:  I can imagine.
R:  -- something like that.  I mean, Manhattan is ... it's a great place.  Must be a great place to be single.  Must be a lotta ...
L:  Oh.  I think it's overrated.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Actually, I think it's really hard to be single here.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Everyone always thinks because there are so many people here --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that it must be great, but it's like ... it's a tough place.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, yeah. [LIPSMACK].
L:  Are you from Boston?  In that area?
R:  Um, yeah, yeah.  I'm from this area.
L:  Oh, you don't have an accent. 
R:  Uh, no, I don't. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I avoided it somehow.
L:  [LAUGH] How did you do that?
R:  My parents -- my parents for one weren't from Boston so they didn't grow up with Boston accents and so you know growing up with them, I didn't pick it up from them and ... I don't know, I guess I just never got influenced by friends of mine who did have one. [LAUGH]
L:  That's funny.
R:  Yeah.  I went --
L:  I actually went out with someone for six years that was from Boston --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  -- and he had -- like, when he gets with his friends or when he'd go out with his friends and his family, he had a crazy accent.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  And so did his whole family.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It was funny.
R:  Uh-huh.  Like, have you ever -- do you ever watch Saturday Night Live?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know that Boston accent --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- kid --
L:  So funny.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  With Ben Affleck?
R:  Um ...
L:  When they do like Matt Damon and Ben Affleck --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- come on, they like put them in that skit.
R:  Right.  Yeah, it's Jimmy Falon --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- who does that.
L:  I love that --
R:  Actually, it's from --
L:  -- and they go to the sleep --
R:  -- Lexington.
L:  -- center.
R:  Yeah, and they love --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- no ma.
L:  No ma.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And the Brewans.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's really funny.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah ... but yeah, I -- I also went to school where -- I didn't go to -- I went to a private school so they weren't -- there were kids from all over ... and so they didn't all have ... you know, I didn't go to school with a bunch of kids that had Boston accents.
L:  You went to a private school in Boston?
R:  Um, well, in the town I lived in.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  Uh-huh.  [LIPSMACK] Are you originally from Manhattan?
L:  No, I grew up on Long Island.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, but I've lived in Manhattan for ... a few years now.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I know.  I went to school in, um, upstate New York so there were a lot of people from Manhattan and from Long Island at -- at my school
L:  Where did you go to school?
R:  Hamilton College.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH] How old are you?
R:  I'm forty two.
L:  Oh, okay.  I know -- um, I'm twenty eight.  I know several people that went there, like around my age.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's a good school.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I was just back earlier ... uh, this year ... and it's changed a lot sin- in twenty years but still ... still pretty much the same. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um ...
L:  This is funny.  [LAUGH] I thought that this thing was gonna be the -- the robot like asking questions.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like a bunch of questions.  Like if they record these discussions and ... study them.
R:  Um, yeah.  I don't know what they're studying for.  I -- I don't know if it's like language identification or -- or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or, um, like, um, you know recognizing words.
L:  I think it's a voice identification.
R:  Uh-huh.  Are you -- how did you hear about it?
L:  Actually my office mate's sister is like one of the researchers.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, that's how I [LAUGH] found out about it.
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  They called right away.  [LAUGH] I signed up for it like this afternoon.
R:  Yeah, yeah, they do.  I -- I signed up yesterday afternoon and I got a call --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- within an hour.
L:  That's so funny.
R:  And then I didn't hear from 'em the rest of the day.  And then today they've called three times.
L:  Really?
R:  I wasn't here the first two times they called.
L:  How many times do they call, like, total?
R:  I think they can -- I read that they can call up to twenty five.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, I think there was -- well --
L:  So, basically, it's just talking to like strangers from around the country?
R:  Yeah.
L:  For ten minutes?
R:  Yeah, about ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, any random ...
L:  [LAUGH] Any random --
R:  Randoms.  Well, there is a --
L:  Life partners, sorry. 
R:  There is a, uh -- there is a list of topics --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on the, um -- on their web page, so you can -- I think there are like thirty or forty different topics and they just randomly choose one --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for that day.  'Cause this life partners, that's been the topic all day 'cause they left messages on my answering machine --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the robot did --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- saying, you know, "Will you talk about life partners?"
L:  That's really a tough topic [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, it's so personal and --
L:  -- could they pick something else?
R:  -- you know, talking to strangers is a little awkward.
L:  I know.
R:  Uh, yesterday it was what's your favorite holiday, and if you could create a holiday, what would it be?
L:  Hm.
R:  So, that wasn't -- that wasn't much easier.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's not -- well, I think I could think of stuff for that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but this is like ... I'm not really sure what to say.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, it's hard to find one?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's true.  It's hard to find one and it's kind of a ... uh, you know, random ... you don't know how things are going to work out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh ...
L:  How long were you married?
R:  Uh, twelve --
