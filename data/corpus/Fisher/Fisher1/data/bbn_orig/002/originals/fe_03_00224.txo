R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, hi, how are -- my name's Trucilla.  Hello?
L:  Your name's what?
R:  Trucilla.
L:  Trucilla?
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's very nice.  My name is Holly.
R:  Hi, nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, how're you today?
L:  Good and how're you?
R:  I'm all right.  [LAUGH]
L:  Good, good.
R:  Yeah, I was just going out for dinner then I got a -- I got this phone call.  I said, "All right then.  I'll take this" so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible] go with dinner.
L:  Yeah, [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, so ... what's the topic for today?  It's like life partner?
L:  Life ... partners so --
R:  Right.
L:  So ... it's how we feel or what's the most important thing ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in a life partner, I guess?
R:  Yeah.  Well, mm, if I have to pick a quality, I guess I would say, um, he must be caring.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, since like it's a life partner, I guess that caring is pretty important, at least to me.  Uh, what about you?
L:  Oh, um, well, I think that, um, I think the most -- that would be really hard to say.  The most important -- but one of the most important things would be, um, for someone to be very understanding --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and, um, just to have really great communication --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- between the two of, you know, I mean, that's kind of like something that each partner means, but you know someone who is understanding knows --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that patience --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is really important, so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think -- think that --
R:  Yeah, this mor- I mean, like when I think about it sometimes I must think if my partner has the same interests with me would be good since we can do things together.  I mean, the things we still interested together and --
L:  Right.
R:  But then, like, it seems like if he -- he has like -- that that person has some --some other interests it would be also fun that I could try new things.  So --
L:  Right.
R:  So that -- that makes me feel like that's not going to be the most important so, yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mm.
L:  And so you said the most important thing would be if they're ...
R:  Caring, just kinda like understanding, caring, that kinda thing.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, that's very important.  Care for you when you need it.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.
R:  Yeah.  I think because of the phase of question like life partner, I don't think anyone will ever really pick like appearances.  Do you think so?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I would hope not.
R: [LAUGH] Yeah, I mean -- 
L:  I mean, that -- that's a pretty big plus --
R:  I know.  [LAUGH]
L:  But it's not the most important.
R:  Well, true.
L:  Really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I wouldn't imagine a life partner would last for a lifetime if it was based on just looks, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  True.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Well, what else?  I mean, do you think we can pick another one or just one thing?  One most important thing?
L:  I don't know.  This is the first one that I have actually gotten to do.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Have you done more?
R:  No, I just try one.  I think yesterday or the day before, I'm not su- I don't remember because, like, the oth- the other day, like, they asked me like a very weird question.  I don't even know what to say so I didn't do it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Basically, I think they mentioned something like you rock or something, so I was like, no.  I don't know that topic.
L:  Where?
R:  So, I don't want to do it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Oh, yeah, huh.
R:  It was stressful.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] Uh ...
L:  Yeah, I think, like marriages in general nowadays are just like people give up too easy because it's -- it is really easy to say, "It's not working.  Let's just ..."
R:  I know.
L:  "... stop".  You know, but I mean, like, my parents are divorced but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I like totally don't want that --
R:  Uh-huh
L:  -- for myself obviously.
R:  Yeah, of course.  I mean, true.  Well, I guess, like finding a really like -- like a partner that you would like to spend your whole life with -- with him, it's tough.  [LAUGH] It's no easy task.
L:  Yes, I know.  Like I have -- I'm actually engaged right now, but --
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  -- I have like a lot of friends who -- who are still, you know they're my age and they're dating --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, I never really got to do the whole dating thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, uh, just because of the schools I went to and stuff, it was just kind of -- it wasn't like officially going out and going -- and like finding me a guy --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or not, but, um, they're just really sick of it.  You know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they're like, "I just want to find the one" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I was saying, like, you know, I found my fiance with --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when I stopped looking.  I was, like, okay, I don't want a boyfriend in my life.  
R:  Right.
L:  I don't want anyone, and then, there he was --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and it -- I guess it's always, you know, when you -- you hear about ... stories like this.  They always -- you know, you always hear that.  It's when they stop looking that I found the person so ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, I don't know.  I guess, like when you've really feel like you -- you have to come with yourself to your partner to -- so -- it's like sometimes like things -- I don't [inaudible] both partners have to compromise for each other somehow --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know to keep a smooth and good relationship.
L:  Yes, absolutely.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And I've -- yeah, and I've learnt so much from my fiance, you know.  He's taught --
R:  Mhm.
L:  He's in the mental health field --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so he is really good at communicating.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I -- and I wasn't at first.  I was, like, oh ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was like, "I don't wanna talk" and -- but now, you know, it's like, you know, if I feel bad or, you know, I feel like I'm taking what he's saying --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in the wrong way and he just wants to have a good day, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- all -- all we have to do is, you know, he'll ask ... I don't even know.  He'll ask, like a question and I'll just like tell him how I feel.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then, you know, I'll like apologize if I did something wrong or, you know like -- 'cause like it's so easy to just be a really selfish and --
R:  Yeah, true.
L:  -- just like not even consider their feelings.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, it's so easy, but then I -- it is real- just almost -- well, it depends on the person, but I -- to me it's pretty easy to apologize for --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for doing that.  And then, you know, it's just so much better once you do that, you know and you -- you say, "Oh, I'm sorry, you know, I'll try and consider your feelings more today" or whatnot --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then it's just like all good again. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Are you --
L:  So --
R:  [inaudible] like nice thing.  I'd be like people sometimes will say, like, "Oh, they don't wanna apologize" or something and they just screw things up even more [inaudible] things just get worse.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Sometimes it's like -- feels like a simple thing, "I'm sorry" just makes the other feel better.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think so.
R:  True.  Well, then I feel kinda bad.  I always like shout at my boyfriend somehow.  I was like, "Oh, come on ove-" I don't know I -- oh, I don't think I do apologize often.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Sometimes I like -- I made the mistake, I don't wanna admit it.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Rub it in and you feel kinda like pants between us and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- after a while and I was like, "All right, I'm sorry" then we just start, like, chatting again, so ...
L:  Right.
R:  Oh, yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  I was -- I remember -- it was hard, you know, because it's like you're giving up control.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Another skill that you need to have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, but it -- it -- it's just the long run it's just so much better.  This would be like ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, just to apologize right then and there, 'cause that's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, after that, the making up and, you know, being good again, that's what's really important.
R:  Yeah, true.  I guess like in the long run it would be a good thing to be considered.  I mean, yeah, considerate.  True.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, and to have the same -- pretty much the same, like, goals as you do in life, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And as well, like, have similar interests.  I mean, you're not gonna have like exactly the same interests which makes it interesting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, like, my partner he, uh -- he never skied and I -- I've skied all my life.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, actually, like last year I took him skiing for the first time --
R:  Oh, and he --
L:  He was -- he was --
R:  -- likes it? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, he was pretty good.  He only fell, like, twice I think --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it was real eas- fall.
R:  Oh, that's -- that's pretty good.  He's like a beginner.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  So, I think he did excellent and, um, you know, I'm -- I -- obviously he doesn't have the same desire to, like, go skiing every year that I do, but ... it's nice to -- even if --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you don't want to, then like try something new and ...
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- for the [inaudible] of your partner.
R:  Yeah.  He might want to accommodate you.  That's why he give it a try.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] You must be good at it.  You've been skiing for so many years.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's -- it's just so much fun but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think -- well, that's something that's important in our relationship is to try new things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He loves trying new things.  Just like, in general.  Like, his friends bou- brought, um -- but he was in New Jersey [MN] and he brought him for the holiday season --
R:  Mhm.
L:  He brought his this, like, special Cola that they had when they went to, um, oh where was it?  Panama?
R:  Mhm.
L:  It was like, it was called Cola Champagne, and --
R:  Mm.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I didn't think I'd like it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- from like the smell and stuff.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  But I tried it anyway and it was okay.  It was kinda like, I don't know, it was -- it was kinda weird and ...
R:  Mm.
L:  And -- but he really appreciated the fact that I -- you know, I would try something that he wanted --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to share with me.
R:  Mm.
L:  So ... you know, I think -- I think that's important too as well.
R:  Yeah.  I did the same thing here because, like, my boyfriend just -- he just loves cars and he keeps talking about his car more than ever --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, I don't -- I don't know what you're talking about.  I mean, I don't -- I don't care.  But I don't like -- I'll go along with it.  All right, all right then.  I try and now sometimes if cars [inaudible] I just slip around with those, like, come back and look at, okay, what's the latest car whatever is so [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] But I don't know, guys is like cars.  They're so strange. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's so awesome.
R:  Yeah, so I now know a little bit more about cars.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Wheth- whether you want to or not, right?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I was like -- he was like, "Come on, I want to look at these car and go to the dealership and dealer and then look at all these new Camaros".  I was, like, [several inaudible words].  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  And he's just like so obsess -- and then one day --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- he told me that.  You know what?  I'm met someone and he left car and then we got so crazy we talk for like more than like two hours and something.  I was like, "What?  Two hours just on cars?"  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well ...
L:  Wow.
R:  I don't know, but I guess --
L:  Sorry.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] No, I -- that's all right, I guess.  I gotta like +respect his interest and, yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yes, same thing.  I like painting but he doesn't care about anything about art.  I was like, all right then.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It's hard.  You have to have equal understanding.
R:  Yeah, true.  Yeah.
L:  But, yeah.  Yeah, I think -- I found that it's just easier li- you know, if he's interested in some-
