L:  Hello?
R:  Hi there.
L:  How're you?
R:  I'm doing fine.
L:  Cool.  My name's Bett.
R:  Hi.  I'm Jennifer.
L:  Cool.
R:  Where're you from?
L:  Um, Columbus, Ohio.
R:  Oh, okay.  I have friends from that area.  I'm down in Atlanta right now.
L:  Oh, really?  I've got --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- friends in that area too.  [MN]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Very cool.
R:  So, airport security.
L:  Yep.
R:  Um ...
L:  When's the last time you flew?
R:  What do you -- uh ... I -- I have flown a lot.  Probably ... it's been a couple of months now.
L:  I'm trying to remember the last time I took a plane.  'Cause, let's see, I haven't done any traveling this past year.  Don't have any -- no, no, 'cause I have done some traveling this past year.  Yeah, I flew to Salt Lake City this, uh, summer.
R:  Okay.
L:  What else?  Did I fly ... did I fly to Canada?  I don't remember.  My -- my girlfriend's ... uh, Canadian, so ...
R:  Okay.
L:  -- she and I are always back and forth and ...
R:  Oh, right.
L:  As far as I can see, airport security's are gon- well, not so much airport security, but customs are really a big pain in the ass.  May be big pain in the ass.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And not terribly effective.  Um --
R:  [MN] Do you think it's not?
L:  No.  Um, the -- the thing is that the things they search for -- I mean, still don't really work all that terribly well and, I mean ... pe- people still bring handguns and things into airports and knives and ah, you can still sneak stuff on very easily.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just that people think that stuff is more secure.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I just saw on the news last night that the Atlanta airport is, I think within the next month or so, is getting the bomb machines in, so everything coming in to the terminal is going to have to be streamed through those so ... that, I guess, will catch a little bit more ...
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  -- of what we're looking for.
L:  -- the question is, what are they looking for?  Because I -- I mean ... as ... as dangerous as bombs are, I mean, when was the last time somebody bombed a plane?
R:  Well, the shoe bomber guy.
L:  Oh, that's true.
R:  At least he didn't bomb it but ...
L:  Well, yeah, let's see.  They -- they do seem to be searching for nitrates.  Th- that's one of the things we had to go through for, uh ... going through Salt Lake City coming back, um --
R:  Okay.
L:  They -- they swabbed down, um ... all -- I mean, our hands as well as our, uh ... the handles for our suitcases and things like that --
R:  Really?
L:  -- to check for nitrates, yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Which is a prime ingredient, uh, uh, dynamite.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um ...
R:  Well, that's interesting.
L:  But the thing is, like, as far as I can tell, I mean, you should be able to circumvent all these things if they're smart enough.  [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh ... there's a good -- well, I guess, having a ...
R:  But have you done much international, like, European ... air travel?
L:  Um ... I've only been to Europe twice.  Been to China a couple of times but --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I -- I mean I -- I've --
R:  Because China is probably about the same thing.  I think one of the biggest things that has impacted me in going to foreign airports was ... I -- I felt like they were much more in control about who was coming and going.  Just the mere fact of seeing soldiers walking around with AK-47 and stuff --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I felt like I didn't want to get out of line for any reason [LAUGH] and I just kind of -- I felt like it was a little bit safer and then you come in American airports and you could go all the way to the gates and, I don't -- I felt like we didn't have a whole lot of control ...
L:  Hm.
R:  -- over what was going on.
L:  Well ... [SIGH] yes, 'cause at Hong Kong airport has men walking around with automatic rifles and I mean, the US -- I mean, the National Guard, for instance, has been a couple -- I mean, let's see, I flew to Manchester, New Hampshire and they had, uh, National Guards posted there.  I've seen National Guards --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- posted in Columbus ... um ...
R:  Are you military though, and so ...
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  -- know where you're kind of, like [LAUGH] what -- who's in the National Guard a lot of the time.  [LAUGH] And I don't really feel safe.  In fact, I feel less safe knowing they have weapons in their hands.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But -- but I guess I'd rather they had the weapons in their hands than some of the people that I see checking things at the security check points so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, it's kind of a toss up there but ... I don't -- but what --
L:  Really?
R:  -- you had said before, you know, if you're smart enough, you can get by, um, and you can find ways around things.  And I think that's what we're coming up against now is seeing that yes, in fact, there is a major threat out there, um, and then how are we going to -- how are we going to brainstorm what they could possibly do --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I think that ... that that part --
L:  Interactive instead of reactive?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, I mean, that -- that was the thing with the -- the shoe ... bomber, how ... as soon as the shoe bomber thing happened, they started checking everybody's shoes but, you know, it's probably unlikely that somebody's going to try that particular tactic again.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, we should check out for it, and I mean, eventually what's going to happen is, I mean, we could keep on going on like that and we're going to build up this gigantic bureaucracy of stuff. 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  And [LAUGH] I mean, then it said it takes three hours for one person to get through the, uh, airport security --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, uh ... uh, it's just going to be a nightmare.
R:  But traveling overseas, you expected that that kind of wait time was what you were going to come up against and you expected stricter security and all the different xraying of, not only carry ons but of suitcases and everything before you checked in.
L:  Right.
R:  And so, I think we've just kind of been spoiled --
L:  Right.
R:  -- by the lackadaisical system and now the fact that, you know, that we can't just show up forty five minutes early -- that it has to be a couple of hours -- that just traumatizes us because --
L:  Well --
R:  -- it cuts into our McDonald's drive through mentality --
L:  Yeah, th- --
R:  -- that everything should be quick.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  No, actually, um [LIPSMACK] Columbus had -- i- is still rather quick. I mean, I -- I've taken --
R:  Right.
L:  -- my -- my girlfriend to the airport and, uh ... we got there, like, you know, probably fifteen minutes ahead of time and she just went up, got her ticket.  There's nobody in the security line for the international lane of -- since she was flying to Toronto, international lane of, uh ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- of, uh, Columbus international and, uh, um ... she just went to the checkpoint and ended up waiting for like twenty minutes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I mean --
R:  I guess I have run into that sometimes, and it's done a lot better but I remember standing in line ... [MN] um, when was it?  End of October, so just a month after the September eleventh stuff --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- in Boston --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- for five and a half hours, just in the lobby of the airport waiting to check in at my desk.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was crazy, and I tried to be smiley and happy but it was really hard.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It was one of times when I'm like, "So, [inaudible] with the gun.  Just let me sit down". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, no.  The -- um, see, that's interesting.  People get really stressed out about airports and I don't actually, like -- waiting for trips and things like that, it's not a big deal.  Like, I've missed my flight before and airlines have put me on the next flight and I was just like, "Cool".
R:  Right.
L:  Works for me, but, um ... there's -- I mean, I'm like really laid back about air travel.  I've never had a problem really and the worst thing they ever really have to deal with are, you know, like people that kind of [inaudible].  Um, otherwise, I mean, people always freak -- I mean, I have a friend who freaks out anytime she goes on a trip.  She has to have everything planned out and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it -- it -- it's kind of -- it's interesting in a way because she -- um, she really stresses out if she doesn't know exactly what's going on and everything is like set out perfectly.  But then, like -- and so, like, trips with her are always interesting because I'm just kinda like, eh, whatever.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And --
R:  And you're like my friend from Columbus 'cause he and I don't travel well together. 
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Because I am the anal planner and I would much rather -- as much as I say, "Oh, yeah, I'll just get there" I would much rather get there two and a half hours early and then just sit somewhere and people watch, than be stressed out about being late.
L:  Right, right.  Well [LAUGH] --
R:  My dad's [LAUGH] like you and he's, you know, "I'll show up.  If I miss it, they're gonna put me on another one".  Argh! [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  That's something I try not to do terribly often [LAUGH] so being --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- being late for planes is one of those things that -- that isn't a terribly [inaudible] but it -- otherwise, I mean --
R:  Now, are you in school or are you ...?
L:  -- traveling's not a big thing.  Yeah, I am.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, I -- I go to OCU.
R:  Okay.  I'm in grad school down at Georgia Tech.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  But I find that students traveling too, have little different, and I am ten years out of college coming back for grad school --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh -- and students have much different attitudes than adults because we're -- well, I say we as in when I was an undergrad.  Now, I'm a little more anal about it but, yeah, we're like, "Oh, yeah, bump us off a flight at Christmas so we get a free ticket" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and now I'm like, "I've got a timeline, I've got a rental car, I have to get to a wedding rehearsal, ra, ra, ra" [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  -- and I find that I'm much less flexible.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but -- yeah, I -- I -- I'm trying to be more responsible with, uh, quite a bit of this stuff and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- take care of a bunch of junk.  So, I -- I'm kinda curious.  What do you do for the military?
R:  I'm a helicopter pilot.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yep.
L:  That's cool so I mean --
R:  So --
L:  -- air security is sort of something directly related to what you do?
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, so I'm sensitive to items that come on aircraft and -- and what's inside of them and -- and all that kind of stuff.
L:  Huh.
R:  I -- as far as my passengers, I mean, I'm ... flying passengers with weapons on them.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  I'm usually carrying one myself if I'm in that kind of situation so, uh ...
L:  Can I ask what sort of aircraft?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Ah, Black Hawks.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's -- that's really neat.  Hm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I've a friend who's, ah, ah -- who just got out of, uh, airborne school.
R:  Okay.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, I never did that.  I've had some knee problems off and on through the years so I --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- figured I don't wanna tempt it by forcing them into the ground like that.  We'll just fly the things.  Someone else can jump out.
L:  [LAUGH] Yep.  Which is probably a good -- good strategy, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- apparently willing.
R:  It works for me so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  My girl- one of my, uh, girlfriend's cousins actually is in, um, Canadian Air Force.
R:  Oh, cool
L:  But it's all the way up north in one of their bases, in one of their ... [LAUGH] flies their F fifteens or whatever they have.  Ah, maybe --
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  -- I don't know.  Yeah, apparently they have a very -- very small, uh ... uh, well, navy as well as air force. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  Yep.
L:  My girlfriend actually was in the Canadian, uh, uh, armed forces for a little while.
R:  Okay.  Do they have a mandatory conscription kind of thing or ...?
L:  No, they don't.
R:  Okay.
L:  They have, uh, just a -- a standing army.  That's why draft dodgers fled up there.
R:  Okay.
L:  But, um ... yeah.  So, actually she -- she got ... after September eleventh, which actually sucked 'cause this was on my birthday that, um, that year --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- she got shipped off to an undisclosed location ...
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- which I wasn't terribly happy about --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, like, freaking out for about three days after that.  So, I don't know, this -- this whole, like, vaguely relates to, uh, terrorism and things like that, and I -- I don't ... the thing that gets me is, I mean, there's so much stuff with -- and people concerned about the -- the airlines and things like that, that -- I mean, there's so many other ways to blow things up.  You don't need a plane.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's kind of disturbing in that way and it's interesting to see, you know, everybody talking about how, uh, the terrorists were, you know, taking flying lessons and things like that, and actually, um --
