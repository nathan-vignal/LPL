L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.  This is Doug.
L:  Hi, this is Linda.  Um, boy that's a hard question for me because, um, I actually have no clue whether it does or doesn't.
R:  Well, I've done a lot of flying since -- since September eleven.
L:  You have?
R:  And I've seen an awful lot of people's toenail clippers confiscated --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, but I also suspect that the biggest change isn't a result of heightened security, the biggest change is a result of a change in passenger expectations.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, in the old days, ah, after the rash of hijackings in the nineteen seventies, the expectation was that if there w- -- if someone hijacked your airplane you were a hostage and they were going to take you to some airport other than your destination and then there would be some negotiations that might take a while, but if everyone behaved nicely, they'd all be released.
L:  Yes, exactly.  And now, that's totally the opposite, yeah.
R:  And now, if someone were to start acting like a hijacker, ah, people would fear for their lives and do desperate things --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, ah, I think it's that doing desperate things on the part of essentially all of the passengers that would make that approach to terrorism pretty much a failure --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah --
L:  I think that one -- one thing that I think is strange is that, um, only now and maybe not even on every airplane, um, that the cockpit and the -- past the cockpit has never been locked and sometimes the doors weren't even closed.
R:  Well, I [MN] -- since September eleven I think more and more everything has been properly locked up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- up front during the flight --
L:  Yeah.  Probably.
R:  -- once they land they open the cockpit door and the pilot smiles at everybody --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, ah, but during the flight things have been pretty locked up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I -- I -- one time that I -- that I flew I'm pretty sure my seat mate was a federal air marshall --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- ah, he didn't say so, but --
L:  Yeah.  But you -- if you could tell, that's interesting, probably a lot of other people could tell as well.
R:  Oh, we'd fall into conversation and he'd been flying a lot and I'd been flying a lot and all -- it was only later that I realised that his pattern of flying a lot, going out and back in one day from -- from -- from O'Hare --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- didn't really match --
L:  [LAUGH] The typical business customer --
R:  Well, I mean, there is a -- one can imagine certain government people doing that to -- for a brief meeting say at the Pentagon or something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But in most cases, people get overnights, ah, and -- and the idea that -- that he was spending essentially all day on the airplane, it just struck me that the -- he was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- probably an air marshall.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And w- -- we were in the front seat.  I've frequently been assigned to front seats, ah --
L:  Hmm.  Do you fly a lot for your work?
R:  Ah, not normally, but the last two years I have.
L:  Yeah.  I have flown -- I haven't flown at all since September eleventh and as a matter of fact over my lifetime I haven't flown probably nearly as much as most people.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um and of course before September eleven a lot of this airline security was just kind of, you know, the -- the routine stuff that in fact I used to really wonder about it because you know, you would go to the ticket counter --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they would say, are you carrying any guns, are you carrying any explosives --
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  You'd say, "No" and they'd say, "Okay" and it's like, well, why even ask that question?  It's absurd.
R:  Ah.  I know why they ask that question, and the answer is that if you say no and then they catch you with a gun, they've got you for perjury as well as a weapons charge.
L:  [LAUGH] You really think that they'd need perjury if they catch you with a gun on an airplane?
R:  I think it -- it's really helpful to have additional things to charge someone with.
L:  Oh.  Because other than that, there is no reason, because obviously someone who is carrying a gun won't say so.
R:  Yeah.  It's also to remind people, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  --  if you -- the -- it's amazing the things people carry with them carelessly --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there's this guy who very shortly after September eleven was f- -- he was a chef and he was flying with all of his chef's knives and he thought they weren't weapons --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- well, to him they were the tools of his trade, but -- but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- this is a whole -- a whole carry on bag full of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of -- of cutlery.
L:  Well, then the question arises, you know, how do people like that get their things where they need them to go?  They have to ship them separately?
R:  They have to check them.
L:  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.
R:  But the -- the -- just like firearms, all you have to do if you're taking a rifle with you is check it.
L:  Mm.
R:  And there's a lot of tourist trade with hunters where in fact I remember in the -- in the late sixties flying -- flying home for Thanksgiving break, flying to Michigan --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- from Pittsburgh and I was a student and I would frequently find myself sitting in front of or behind a pair of hunters who, ah, who'd been deer -- who were going to Michigan for -- for hunting season --
L:  Oh, really.
R:  -- and back then, this is before the fire -- before the hijacking issue, it was perfectly reasonable for them to take their guns as carry on baggage.
L:  Huh.  Yeah.
R:  Put it in the overhead bin.
L:  And now that would probably be considered very odd.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Very odd if you even thought of taking it on a plane at all, much less on a carry, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Deer rifles.  Yes.  Well, no, actually I, ah, people still check that kind of thing --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- although they can't take ammunition.
L:  Right, okay, yeah.
R:  But they can check firearms and -- and -- and considering the trade in hunters, ah, as a major part of the income during deer season for example, for a number of States, Michigan and Minnesota and -- and -- ah, you know, they'd love to attract deer hunters form, ah, from States that don't have deer, ah, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they see it as a major source of tourist income, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, there are a lot of hunters who -- who take weapons.
L:  Mhm.  Well, you know, getting back to the original question --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think that -- I think that I would probably feel that the heightened security, given all -- given all the things that have gone on in this country and -- and all the mistakes that the FBI and CIA have been mading -- making and everything, I -- I don't feel especially convinced that what they're doing is really going to make a lot of difference.  I -- I sort of feel more like if someone wants to hijack a plane, they're going to get it, they're going to find a way to do it.  You know.
R:  Yeah.  But, and also, if someone wants to be a terrorist, there are other ways to terrorize.
L:  Yeah.  Well, as you know, they used, you know, box cutters for --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- weapons on that other plane which didn't get detected.  So, um --
R:  Right.  And -- and if I wanted to, ah, if I wanted to, ah, to -- to commit some new act of terrorism, I mean, ah, ah, small bombs in crowded places --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- would be just as effective as sources of terror, ah --
L:  Yeah.  And you also may be able to somehow, either yourself or get someone else to have access to the airplane and -- and, you know, do something to it so that when it was in flight it was going to crash, or something like that.
R:  Well, but -- but those are -- those are secure -- now those are secure targets and there are so many other things where if I wanted to terrorize a society -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'd simply -- I'd simply pick some different thing.
L:  Exactly.  And --
R:  Shopping mall, or a -- or a -- or a football stadium with a hundred thousand people in it --
L:  With lots of people.
R:  -- ah --
L:  Especially since now they've sort of got all the focus on airlines --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and things and so they're going to go, okay, well, while they're busy with that, we're going to be quietly developing a new method, you know.
R:  A new -- right.  And it -- it doesn't take much intelligence to pick new methods --
L:  No.
R:  -- there's so many --
L:  There's so many options --
R:  -- I mean, any -- any complex advanced civilization has tremendous points of vulnerability and we -- we -- what is it, we rely on, ah, we rely on -- on -- on the fact that the vast majority of people play by the rules.  That's what makes our society work --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and when someone decides to go bizarrely against the rules, things break.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And there -- and therein lies, that's the crux of the matter, is that there is absolutely no way that you can protect yourself from any eventuality in the world --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, there's just no way, it's like someone, um, I was -- I was talking to a friend once who said that someone had sued a car company because their seatbelt had broken or something and, um -- and he said, "You know, you just can't -- you can't protect yourself from everything, you know" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the world is fraught with danger, I mean [LAUGH] that's the way it is, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  And unfortunately it's getting more and more that way, it seems, so that when, you know, raising children is -- you can no longer feel safe in telling them, "Yeah, you're safe, I'll take care of you, nothing bad will ever happen".
R:  That's -- is -- is that just exaggerated sense of risk, I mean, there was a -- there was a piece of, ah, of email I saw recently from someone in Israel responding to people from -- from outside of Israel and he said how can you stand to live in a country where things are just so violent and so awful --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they pointed out that the, ah, the -- the death rate from traffic fatalities in Israel is twice the death rate from, ah, from violence.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  And so, and the death rate of traffic fatalities, you know, people don't stop driving because of that --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's a question of putting risks in perspective, that -- that we frequently, because some risk gets a lot of publicity, we exaggerate it all out of proportion.
L:  Yes.  That's very true.  Yeah.
R:  And if you put the risks in perspective, you discover that a lot of common, everyday things are -- are more dangerous.
L:  Yeah.  Like smoking cigarettes, or [LAUGH].
R:  If you -- if you're worried about explosion risks that you are likely to be faced with, the, ah, gasoline tank trucks in the highway --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- are the single greatest source of -- of -- of massive catastrophic fires in the country right now.
L:  Really?  Well, does that actually happen?  I've never heard about that happening.
R:  Oh, there was a case that I remember in the -- in the seventies, I was in Colorado at the time, a tanker truck ha- -- was involved in a traffic accident and caught fire in the middle of a freeway interchange in Denver.
L:  Whoa.
R:  And it was just an incredible mess.
L:  Mm.
R:  Those gasoline tanker trucks are really hazardous.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And fortunately the accident rate is low, but it's not zero and when they do have --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- accidents it's not too hard to ignite the fuel.
L:  Yes, exactly. 
R:  And it's -- be- -- but because it's a common thing, we know those tanker trucks are everywhere, we know traffic accidents are everywhere.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Sure, once in a while one of them will blow up.  It's not exciting news, except locally.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and it's quickly forgotten because it's a familiar risk.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Not because it's not dangerous, just because it's familiar.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Whereas the same amount of chaos caused by -- by a -- a -- a -- some other less common thing, ah, that -- that the -- the truckload of -- of -- of spent nuclear fuel that has a traffic accident and no one gets injured and the fuel containers don't leak, that'll be a front page news story --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because it involves an unfamiliar risk.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And while the -- with an airplane, also, maybe you don't feel this way because you fly frequently, but I -- I think that people tend to -- I tend to think of it as, okay, you're up there, you're, you know, you're mi- -- you're a mile above the earth, trapped in this airplane --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and if something happens, you're -- you're a gonner.  You know.
R:  Now, that's -- that's the big difference between airplanes and driving and driving most accidents are survivable --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and airplanes, most accidents are not survivable.
L:  Yeah.
R:  On the other hand, driving accidents are so common that it's an awfully good thing most of them are survivable because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- overall the death rate on the -- on -- in cars is higher.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah --
L:  I think you also -- if -- if you're like me you feel like you have more control if you're the one driving the car than a--
R:  Yeah, it's your fault.
L:  You -- you have your own self to blame or something, but --
R:  Yeah, whereas with -- with an airplane accident, you're -- you're -- you're an innoc- -- you're an innocent victim of airplane --
L:  Yeah.
