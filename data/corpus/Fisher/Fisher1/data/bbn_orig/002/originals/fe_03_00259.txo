R:  Hey.
L:  Hello?
R:  Hey, who's this?
L:  Uh, I'm Ben.
R:  Hey, I'm Matt.
L:  Mm, good to meet you.
R:  Yeah, you too.  So, how -- how did your life change since September eleventh?
L:  How has it changed?  Um ... [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  Uh, not in very significant ways.
R:  Yeah.  What -- what's your profession anyway?
L:  I'm a graduate student.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  You?
R:  Oh, I'm an undergrad student actually.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, yeah.  Um ...
R:  Yeah, I'm down -- down in California, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I'm from California.  That's where I was when, uh, when it happened but --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I've moved to the east coast since.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, uh ... yeah, I don't know.  It's not, uh ... in California it seems I think like significantly less of a threat, you know --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- than it, uh ... does on the east coast.
R:  Yeah.  Here's it's -- uh, yeah.  I -- I'm not too worried about it.  The -- the only ... [MN] reason I worry at all about it is ... or even think about it, was when I fly, but my dad's a pilot and so I grew up flying my whole life so flying just seems so normal that, you know, it doesn't really ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  It seemed that big of a deal when [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  Even ...
L:  So, but now you find it scarier?
R:  Oh, no, no.  I -- I -- I'm saying that ... I'm saying that I'll think about it but flying seems normal anyway so I -- I could see for someone who feels uncomfortable flying anyway that they might ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- see that as something ... something else added to it, but yeah, I -- I don't really think about it much.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um ... I -- I guess only -- I guess only ... thing where it's intensified in my life is ... um, it's ... just got me thinking a little more politically which I think [SIGH] I think pretty politically anyway, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, what has it made you think politically?
R:  [NOISE] Oh, probably ... um ...
L:  Like, how has it changed your political views?
R:  Yeah, uh, it's just -- it's actually presented more of a dialectic than anything, you know.  Bef- um ... before, uh ... yeah, I guess, kinda before September eleventh there was just kinda ... it was just kinda -- it was -- it was just kinda ... um ... you know the -- the -- these countries hate America, [LAUGH] you know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh ... and, uh, these countries hate America and, uh, you know, we fight against 'em, things like that, and then -- but it's -- it's caused me to look into things like you know, the -- the way we support Israel and [LAUGH] ...
L:  Right.
R:  And all the implications it has on them, you know?  Israel's sitting there with ... you know, a whole lot of military technology and they're -- they're ... and pushing around the Palestinians too, you know, and [LAUGH] ...
L:  Right.
R:  So ... it -- it's caused me, I guess, to sympathize a little more b- but, you know, not -- not agree with the methods.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  But maybe to look at sort of some of the root causes of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what happened, yeah.
R:  Yeah, what about you?
L:  Um ... yeah, I don't know.  It -- um ... I guess it hasn't gotten me, like, involved politically or anything like that.  Um ...
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  [MN] But, uh, yeah, it's ... you know, something -- something that, yeah, seems like it -- probably it should have been expected ... [SIGH] you know, given, uh ... given the ... you know, way the sentiment about the United States in the Arab world, you know?
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK] So ... yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  Terrible trag- tragedy though ... for sure [LIPSMACK].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] the Arab -- the Arab world's definitely blackballed in international negotiations and all that too so ... [LAUGH] I mean ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, no, it's not, uh ... not a good situation.  I mean, I remember there were -- there was more discussion I think right after it happened about, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, why -- why did this happen ... um, than there is now.
R:  Mm.
L:  I think all that sort of discussion went away pretty fast, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but right away there were, you know, people ... saying that we really need to look into ... the United States', uh, Arab policy and, uh ...
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  -- that's not so much on the TV anymore.  [SIGH] But, uh ... so, but what you're saying is that you weren't -- weren't really quite so aware of, um, what was going on politically?
R:  Well, I -- I think I was -- I think I was aware of it, but I -- I kinda chose to remain a little bit ignorant, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Not -- not really look into it.  It's like, oh that's a huge mess, you know [LAUGH] but ...
L:  Right.
R:  But no.
L:  Have you gotten like more politically active since -- 
R:  Oh ...
L:  -- since then or ...?
R:  More -- more in terms of keeping myself informed.  Um, I'm ... I'm ... actually ... let's say politically active, um ... I'm a student and I work right now [LAUGH] so it's kinda --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- hard to get active or not in a lot of areas, but, um ...
L:  How do you keep yourself informed?
R:  Oh, usual -- usually newspapers, uh ... news- news- newspapers, internet and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, just the standard ways, but not -- not anything huge.  I -- I've ... I've read a little bit of stuff on, you know, Jewish background and, um ... and background of the Israeli state but no- nothing that big.  Um ... when I say informed, I'm not talking about ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- anything too deep --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but ... yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  No, it -- I -- I understand.   Um ... you, uh ... what have you read about, uh, about Israel?
R:  Oh, um [SIGH] ... in -- in general?  Well, okay, I -- I've done -- I've done -- done a whole lot of Holocaust reading but that's not ... um [SIGH] well, I guess it pertains to this, but yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I've -- I've done a lot -- a lot of Holocaust reading and I've read a little bit of, um ... of how Israel -- Israel came into the regions due different times -- during different times, you know, when, uh ... before they were the Israeli state.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, my dad's really big into this and so ... you know so- sometimes he'll, you know, sh- show me a lot -- show me some historical things to read out of books and all that stuff, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is there anyone in particular who you -- who you like, like as far as historians or, um ... I mean, commentators or anything else?
R:  [SIGH] You know, I'm not -- I'm not too familiar with historians and commentators.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Um, yeah, the -- the -- it -- for Holocaust stuff, I've done a lot -- I've ... I've read a lot of ... I've read a lot about Primo Levi[?], he wrote ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- he wrote quite a few Holocaust books, and then I -- I'm -- ah, he also -- I also read, uh, a few, uh Elli Vizo[?] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- books too so ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, he's -- he's very good.
R:  Yeah, but I guess those guys aren't historians but ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, but they --
L:  I mean, in some sense they are, right?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Um ... but yeah.
R:  Are -- are you a history major or something or ...?
L:  No.
R:  What are you --
L:  No, no, I mean, I've taken some history but, uh ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  No, I, uh, study linguistics.
R:  Oh, linguistics.  Oh, I wanna get into linguistics actually.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah.  That's interesting
L:  What do you study now?
R:  I'm an English major right now.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, um -- actually I -- I'm really hating English, like all the literature stuff.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I guess we're getting off topic but ... [LAUGH]
L:  I think that's okay.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH] Yeah, I -- I'd like to get into, uh, um ... but my -- my biggest hobby and biggest area of study that I enjoy is Russian right now ... and I'm taking a couple lingui- linguistics classes so -- I'm taking phonology next semester so ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, well, that's great.
R:  Yeah, my -- I really want to get into that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, it's a cool -- a cool field.
R:  Yeah, we had to do a language study this semester for a project and I did Ar- Armenian ... uh ...
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, it wasn't anything h- it wasn't a huge project but it was just, you know, going through the basic steps of mor- morphology, phonology, you know, minimal pairs and all that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Hm.
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's, uh, interesting stuff.
R:  [NOISE] That's cool.  Yeah, so what -- what -- what do you wanna do when you get into linguistics?
L:  Well, I don't know.  Research, I guess.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Yes, there aren't, uh ... there aren't a ton a jobs outside of academia in linguistics, you know?
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- well, I -- probably governmental jobs but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um ...
L:  Yeah, that's true.  That's a possibility.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, actually, uh [LAUGH] ... yeah, but by, uh -- actually I'm a Christian and so there's also bible translation for that.  That's a huge field for linguistics right now so ...
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, yeah, the ... but ... how 'bout -- the other, since September eleventh, I guess, going back to the topic, but -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I don't know.  It's, uh, no- nothing has see- changed too much.  I mean, you heard all this stuff about how nothing'll ever be the same again [LAUGH] but ...
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, no, I think it'll, um [SIGH] ... people in some ways made too big a deal about it and -- and others made a too -- too small of a deal.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um [SIGH] ... yeah, I dunno.  I, uh ... [LIPSMACK] I, uh, I think it's -- you know, it's -- it's weird because there are -- there are posters all over the place that say, um, you know, we will never forget and stuff like that, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which is obvious, you know.  Of course, [LAUGH] I'll -- of course nobody's gonna forget, you know!
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  One of those major historical events in, you know, in America ever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ... but, uh ... yeah, it's, uh ... it -- it doesn't seem to have changed many people's day to day lives very much which is, I don't know -- I don't know if that's good or bad.
R:  It's fu- it's funny when you go to the airport because ... you know, the -- the lines are like twenty -- are twenty times longer but it doesn't seem like they're doing too much extra. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I actually haven't been slowed down very much at the airports.  Like, I'm always a little surprised by how, um, how lax the security is.  So ... I mean, I -- I've only flown three or four times since it happened but, uh, yeah, I don't know.  I've -- and I've been a little ... a little, uh, anxious, you know, when -- like, when waiting for the plane to take off and stuff like that, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  I mean, [SIGH] I know it's probably silly, you know, because there is such extensive security, but, uh ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I'm a little anxious.
R:  Well, and plus all the passenger- I mean, no one -- no one's ever going to be able to take over a plane with a box knife again.  I mean -- [LAUGH]
L:  What's that?
R:  No one will ever be able to take over a plane with a box knife again.  [LAUGH] Passengers won't take it, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So ... 
L:  Yeah, that only -- I guess it only probably happened in the first place because, uh ... because people only -- well, just sort of wanted to, uh ... you know, try to -- try to make it through it.  They didn't realize that ... you know, what was -- what -- you know, what -- that it was possible that the plane could be, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- used as a weapon or whatever.
R:  Yeah, it's true.  It's never been do- never been done before but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  One thing I have been noticing is, you know, it seemed like every week we hear something like, oh, Al -- Al -- Al Qaeda's threatening to, uh, you know, saying ka- more attacks are coming and then nothing's happened.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] I mean, I don't know how much of that is due to good CIA investigation and all that but ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, no, it seems like the public's sort of in the dark about a lot of stuff.  I mean ... you know, on -- on, uh ...
