L:  Good evening.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hey, how're you?  My name is Charles Liggins.
R:  Good.  Okay, my name is Rachel.
L:  Rachel?
R:  Yes.
L:  Same as my wife's.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  [COUGH]
L:  How are you today?
R:  Pretty good.  How are you?
L:  Good thank you.
R:  Good.
L:  So, we're here to discuss the topic of how, uh, you've changed your life since the September eleventh terrorist attacks?
R:  Yes, that sounds right.
L:  Yes.
R:  So ... [SIGH] well, did you have, like, any family or anything that was affected by it?
L:  Um, no family members directly affected by it.  Um, in a business wise, I'm in a business myself of -- of commercial aviation.
R:  Okay.
L:  So ... you know, I -- I've -- I've, um ... through people -- I know people -- people who were affected and ... and, uh, just the job market itself, how it has changed.
R:  Yeah, tremendously, I think.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, I had one of, um, my friends from home, her ex boyfriend's brother was actually working there and it -- the plane actually hit the floor that he was working on, so ... it was ... pretty upsetting but ... yeah.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, so, I feel like everybody could do -- like, everyone, you know, was affected in a different way.
L:  Well, I'm sure.  You know, I mean, it's, uh ... obviously you couldn't be an American or not American and not be affected by ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- by the date itself.
R:  Yeah.  So, have you done anything differently?  Like, since then?  Like in -- in your life?  Round your residence and everything?
L:  You know, actually ... I can say that I don't think I've done anything differently.  That I've done -- you know, prior to, as opposed to after ... the attacks.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Um ...
R:  I don't think I really have either because, um, like, I know some people are like they're hesitant to like, um, travel and stuff, but I don't know, I went with my family a while ago to, um, Europe and I didn't feel anything, you know.  There is no difference or anything like that so --
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, on -- on that front, I mean, if you allow ... something to change your life ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- every time an event occurs, you know, you're always -- you're always adjusting what you do ... um ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to an extremes to just to suit the -- the, uh, the time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and the time is always transient.  It's never the same.  So, you're never really stable yourself, so you really have to be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you have to be strong and say what you do from day to day just to ... to, um ... just not be willing to change, I guess.
R:  Yeah, I definitely think so.  Yeah.
L:  You -- you could do things smarter, of course.  That's always ... that's always a good option, but just to change ... in terms of, uh, not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- doing something is -- I don't think it's -- it's good for your personal being.
R:  No, I don't think it is either --
L:  No.
R:  -- because if you let someone like -- or if you let something like that, like, rule your life then, like, you're obviously not gonna have one because ...
L:  Right.
R:  Bad things happen all the time.  I mean, I'm not saying, like, it's like ... like, what happened wasn't horrible, but you know what I'm saying?
L:  Yes.
R:  Like, you can't ... [LIPSMACK] you have to move on and ... [SIGH] it's not easy.
L:  That is definitely true.  Are you in the Philadelphia area?
R:  Um ... ye- um, with what area?
L:  Do you live in the Philadelphia area?  I live in the Philadelphia area.
R:  Oh, no, no, no, no.  I live in Illinois.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So ... yeah.  Well, my brother works a lot.  He -- well, he works in Boston so ...
L:  In Boston?
R:  Yeah.  Well, actually it's ... like an hour or two away from Boston.  It's in Maramara[?], New Hampshire.  I don't know if you know.
L:  No, I'm not familiar.
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, [SIGH] but yeah, I don't know how it sort of affected me.  [LAUGH] Honestly, I don't think ... I really haven't made that big of a change but ...
L:  Do you find it the --
R:  I thought it was pretty cool about like how people in New York City were a lot better.  I mean, there are more family on the streets and whatnot so ...
L:  Mm.
R:  'Cause I went there last summer and ... I didn't find that it was horribly rude like everyone had told me, but --
L:  Yes.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Well, it --
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  You know, it's unfortunate I think we have a, uh, a short memory.
R:  Yes.
L:  So ... you know, it doesn't take people long to get back to their normal ways.
R:  [LAUGH] That's very true.
L:  You know, it changed soon after September eleventh and a month later they're back to themselves which, you know, I kinda ... am not in agreement with how they were before.  You think they'd be changed for the better but some people just don't.  I -- I don't know if it's human nature or -- or what it might be but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ... I'm sure it had -- the -- the event has changed a lot of people's life.
R:  Yeah, I think so.
L:  Um, permanently and hopefully for the better.
R:  Yeah.  Yes, definitely in that -- I mean, I think that maybe people are a little more like hesitant to fly and stuff.  I mean, maybe like right after that, but ... my feeling is that ... it's only pr- it's probably ten times safer now than it ever was.
L:  That -- that's true.
R:  You know what I mean?  I think it's ridiculous to not fly.  I mean, I -- personally would think like I would rather fly now than I -- you know?  So ...
L:  You would think it would be safer now?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  That's true.
R:  Definitely.
L:  Well, being in the business, you know, I mean, I get those reports, uh ...
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- and really the travel numbers are -- are -- are back to pre September eleventh.
R:  Good.
L:  Of course there was a drop off immediately after but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  People are -- people are back and traveling ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- more so than they were before.
R:  As they should, you know?
L:  Right.  I mean, why ...?
R:  Yeah.  Why worry about something you can't really control?
L:  -- why totally change?  True.
R:  Yes, exactly.
L:  That's so true.
R:  So ... I don't know.  Well, [LIPSMACK] how long do we talk for, do you know?
L:  Um, I think it's about ten minutes.
R:  About ten minutes?  Okay [LIPSMACK], what else could we [LAUGH]?
L:  [LAUGH] And I didn't get my watch so I'm not sure how far along we're into it.
R:  I don't either.  [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible].
R:  Um ...
L:  So, what do you do out in Illinois?
R:  I'm actually a student.
L:  Okay, and where?
R:  So, um, University of Illinois.
L:  And -- and what was the capmus -- campus atmosphere after ... after, uh, September eleventh?
R:  Um, I th- you know, it was ... really like there were a lot of people all of a sudden like everyone was like -- it almost felt like there were tons of people that had relatives there or, um ... well, maybe not directly related but, like, you know, their relative was -- I don't know, their friend was working in there or something like that and I think --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- it made everyone ... a lot of people went home that week and, um, actually classes were cancelled the next day so -- which was really weird because they never have, um, classes cancelled for, like, any reason --
L:  Right.
R:  -- at the university, but ... yeah, um, there was ... that and ... I don't know.
L:  Did you find the other student bodies would be -- to be more warming?
R:  Um [LIPSMACK] yeah.  I feel --
L:  Or does it seem like there -- or did it seem like it was more removed 'cause of the distance, the physical distance from ...?
R:  I think that there was probably more of a distance than -- we -- they sent out mass emails to all the students and it was just, you know, saying that you need to, like, have respect for, um, like Arabs and people are, um -- you know whatever --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because it's not their fault --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of what happened and you don't need to like make comments to them on, you know -- regarding these 'cause they had nothing to do with it.  You know what I mean?  Which was totally --
L:  Well, did you notice that at all?  Did you -- did you notice a change in the student body in ter- towards the, uh, Ara- Arab population?  I'm not sure what it is there if it all -- exists at all.  I'd imagine --
R:  Um --
L:  -- that you'd have some.
R:  You know, yeah, we -- we had quite a few but I don't think ... I -- I didn't notice a lot of discrimination or anything of that sort, but ... I mean, maybe I just wasn't paying attention.  I'm sure there are numbers and whatnot --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I'm sure there were some cases of it, but ... as an overall, I think people realize -- I mean, obviously we're all at school.  You have to be smart to get in so you're educated and you're not going to take it out on someone who is -- has nothing to do with the situation.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just because it's their, you know ... [LIPSMACK] nationality, doesn't mean that -- I mean --
L:  They're responsible --
R:  -- we've done horrible, you know?
L:  -- right.  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, I just think ... people are pretty ... pretty, you know, nice about the whole situation and didn't really ... foster any problems but ...
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, so ... I don't know.
L:  Did you feel the, uh, student body was ... was pro military after it or kinda just still neutral or -- or just --
R:  Um, no --
L:  -- still held their same stance or --
R:  I would ... you know, I definitely think that they had ... um, a better, like, sense of pride maybe here --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know, for everything.  Um ... I -- I would probably say pro military if I had to make a decision because, um, I know one of my friends was in the army and he was all ready to go and, you know ... and maybe that's because he was all ready, you know, proud ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or whatever before it happened and then this just made him more, you know, vocal about his opinions, but ... [LIPSMACK] I think that ... yeah there was definitely a great sense of support for any decision really that they made.  I mean, you know, I think sometimes ... I don't know ... [LIPSMACK] but it was good.  I -- there were some people that were obviously against, you know, the wa- like, going to war --
L:  Right.
R:  -- doing anything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But ... for the most part, I would say they were ... pro military, but yeah ...
L:  Oh.
R:  How was it at work?  Was it different ... very different atmosphere?  Were there more, you know, worries or anything like that or ...?
L:  Um ... th- there were.  I mean, there were some people concerned.  I know ... um ... there -- we had some flight attendants who actually did not -- did not work, or choose not -- chose not to work after it because they were afraid.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um ... within a pilot group, uh, I -- I didn't notice or hear of any hesitancy ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- towards going back to work.  It was, you know, pretty much you know business as usual.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and it's almost ... it was almost under my frame of, if it happened once, you would never expect it to happen again.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, this whole [inaudible] and ignorant, but still, it's always the case.  Especially something to that magnitude, you know.  It's almost -- almost like you fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They would just never expect it to happen again a second time.
R:  That's true.
L:  [SIGH] So ...
R:  Very true.
L:  -- it's -- it ... but, um ... I don't know, you just ... you kinda seeing people just be more aware, I guess, of the surroundings.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... not really hesitant, but I guess ... maybe -- maybe a little more cautious.
R:  Yeah.
L:  A little more cautious.
R:  Very true.  What, um -- what was I going to ask you?  There's something ... oh, did you have to do any other training or anything after that happened -- uh, after it happened?
L:  No.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, we did not.  We did not.
R:  The -- the flight attendants or anything?
L:  N- no, they did not, but they were -- from what I understand, some changes they are implementing will affect the flight attendants ... um ... you know, at post -- post nine eleven, kinda like a lessons learned, what to do and I'm not sure what they are to -- to -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or where things are to be implemented, but things will be changed.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ... I'm not sure if they think there's a [inaudible] been put out yet so, as we're not really speaking on -- there's nothing major but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there will be some changes.  And -- and as far as a pod group is concerned, there's -- I mean, out- outside of arming the pilots, there has been no ... there has been no changes made tow- towards it by training.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um ... you know, one of the kingpins --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- has always been is may take a show of the aircraft which is always --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a primary thing.  I guess ... one thing that should be done I guess is just how you handle it.  How you handle terrorism.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause they never really considered it happening domestically, you know?  It's always been international case, where you kinda just give in to ... what they want, you know?  If -- if hostages are ... are --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- are laid on the table, then it's kinda like, "Well, what can we do to save them?"
R:  Yeah, that's very true.
L:  Uh, it's just been a shock to ... how do you handle domestically because it really does change the picture whereas opposed to --
