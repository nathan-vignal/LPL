L:  Geez.  Uh, hi, my name's Anne.
R:  Hi.  My name is Farima.
L:  How are you?
R:  Okay, Anne.  How are you?
L:  Okay.  Where do you live?
R:  I live in Philadelphia.  And you?
L:  Oh.  Okay.  I'm -- I live in Mont Clair, New Jersey.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  You're not very far.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] no.
R:  Which airport do you use?  [LAUGH]
L:  Newark.
R:  Oh, okay.  Have you -- have you been travelling since, um --
L:  Since September eleventh?
R:  September eleventh, yeah?
L:  Yes.  I went to Europe --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And did you have any problems with the security and all --
L:  No.  I didn't.  Have you travelled?
R:  Yes.  I have travelled.  Yeah.  It's very interesting because I -- I'm not a native of this country --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I come from a -- a very suspicious country [LAUGH] Iran, which has lately has been --
L:  Yes.  Oh, evil -- the axis of evil --
R:  -- identified as the axis of evil.
L:  Right, yes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  Well, um, yeah, I have -- I haven't had much, mm, I haven't had any trouble with them, any problems because I didn't make -- I didn't make it difficult for them to, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- search me, you know, but, um, you know, not at that airport, but when I went to Canada, the Canadian people on the, you know, s- -- the -- uh, border they were -- they were very, very polite.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But on my way back, you know, the Americans under -- under the border, they were -- somehow I felt like they were provoking, they --
L:  Really?
R:  Yes.  And that's very --
L:  I hear the Israelis do that on their border, too.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it's a very bad thing, because --
L:  Yes.
R:  It's a very bad thing because, you know, ah, to make somebody --
L:  Yeah, I think -- I think that, um, well, it's -- yeah, it is a bad thing and -- and I think it does not help security to be like that.
R:  No.
L:  You know, it doesn't help our safety at all --
R:  No.
L:  -- to antagonize people and, ah, you know, if you -- if you're looking for terrorists, find them and then, you know, arrest them.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] yeah, not that easy to find terrorists, I know, but this is also very bad, it's bad for America --
L:  Very.
R:  It's very bad for America.
L:  I apologize.
R:  I'm not -- I'm American now.
L:  No.
R:  So, I have to apologize to myself about the, you know, for -- to the foreigners.
L:  But people are -- ah, America's just not used to being in danger.  I mean, t- -- so many people in Iran have suffered --
R:  Yes --
L:  -- I mean, if they want to --
R:  Look, look, um, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- these -- these Islamic people have killed my husband, they have killed my brother, so I'm also -- I've been, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I went to -- into deep depression for eight years.
L:  Yeah.  And -- and we have --
R:  I don't deserve people to be, uh, nasty to me and [LAUGH].
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Uh, I think probably if they had better airport security like Israel has --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  -- with guards on every plane, and, you know, they really, really are serious --
R:  Yes.  The best, the best is in Israel.
L:  -- that would be -- that would help us, that -- 
R:  Sure.
L:  -- that would be good.  But we'll never spend the money on that.
R:  It's very strange that [LAUGH] American planes they didn't have it before --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, even Iran --
L:  Even doors [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- doors to the cockpit.  They didn't have.  I mean, you know --
R:  And now, they're going to arm the -- the pilot in the cockpit?  H-
L:  I mean, they didn't -- they couldn't lock the door of the -- of the --
R:  Yeah, they couldn't lock the door, but now they are arming the -- the -- the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- pilot.  I mean, how can the pilot be -- be flying the plane and taking care of terrorists at the same time?
L:  And how can he shoot a gun in a plane that's twenty thousand feet if -- if the bullet goes through the side of the plane, the -- it'll depressurize and everybody will die [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm, mhm.  Yeah.
L:  You know, I think that's just --
R:  No, the Israelis are the best for security.  They really are.  They trained -- they trained -- the time before the revolution, the time of the Shah --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They trained our security system --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and from then onwards we always had in every section of the plane, even now, they have an armed person who doesn't -- who doesn't -- who looks like ordinary, but he's armed and he's sitting there --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Among the passengers.  So, nobody can -- can, you know, sort of, uh, hijack a plane or ...
L:  Right.  Yeah.  Well, I -- I was sort of proud of the uh, of the, um, passengers on the plane that -- that fought against the, uh, hijackers.
R:  Yes, yes, yes, sure.
L:  Although it appears the hijackers on another plane --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, so they couldn't -- they couldn't react --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so maybe that was why they didn't protest.  But who would think such a thing would happen anyway?
R:  No.  No.  Well, you know, planes have been hijacked so many times in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- since, I mean, for the last twenty or maybe twenty five years --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, you know, to think that one country is an exception, except also to -- look, America is the richest country and the most, um, super power, how --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how can you can imagine they won't -- they won't do that?  
L:  I know.
R:  Of course they will do it.  So, you have to be --
L:  I'm afraid this whole crisis is showing what is to -- in my opinion, the very worst of American character, dependent on guns, ah, hatred of people who are not like you, you know, a certain number of people in the country and, ah, this, ah, feeling of superiority that they are not -- you can't touch them, that they're invincible, arrogance, it's -- it's not been, ah, it's not showing America at its best, really.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean, the day itself showed America at its best, I think, when people helped each other so much with no reaction.
R:  Mm.  Well, [inaudible] I came to America because I found Americans are friendliest people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to me, [LAUGH] I mean, they were the friendliest people.  You know, I lived in --
L:  Yeah.  Do you think they're friendlier than people in the Arab countries?
R:  Uh, Arab?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well --
L:  Because I found the people in the countries to be so friendly and hospitable --
R:  Well, you know, I -- I haven't been to many Arab countries and Iran is not an Arab country.
L:  No, I know.
R:  And -- but, um, you know, um, well, since the revolution, in the -- during the revolution people -- people were terrible.  I mean, people -- that was such anarchy there, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, ah, you know, although personally nobody [MN] nobody wanted to harm me, but -- but -- but my --
L:  The atmosphere was bad.
R:  -- but my family were -- were harmed.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Anyway, but, um, ah -- a- -- Italians also are very friendly.
L:  Oh, I love Italy.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Well, in fact, I was in Italy, in Rome --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I had just left the Rome airport.  It must have been, like, nineteen seventy or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- back then sometime --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I heard a noise behind me and there -- a bomb went off in --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- the airport.
R:  Wow!
L:  So, ah, that's as close as I've gotten to any kind of -- 
R:  [MN] [LAUGH]
L:  -- I could --
R:  How far from you?
L:  Oh, it was -- I was, [MN] -- I was quite far from the terminal, I mean, I -- I didn't -- I just heard a noise --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I heard -- and I found out the next day what it was, I didn't know at the time --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- what it was.
R:  Mm.
L:  But, um, you know, people have been bombing airports and then you can do it, you can always do it.
R:  Yes.
L:  And, uh, the best protection is, um, not to -- not to make those people mad [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, well, well, if they -- they are -- they plan to do something, they will do it for [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, the security is very important.  Security is very im-
L:  Oh, I agree -- I agree.  I -- I think they should do that, but they should do it right, you know, they should have properly trained people instead of taking people that they're trying to pay the basic wage and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, do it right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have well trained people, well trained guards and do it right.
R:  Do you think it's going to cost them a lot that they don't do it?
L:  Yeah.  They -- they're employing people and paying them the lowest amount that they can pay them.  And --
R:  And, yes, that --
L:  -- well, what are they going to get, they're not going to get the best employees, of course not.  There'll be a lot of turnover, people will leave --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- these are the people who inspect your bags at the airport.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  So, we're -- we're not doing -- we're not serious about it.  I think if we were it would -- it would help.
R:  [MN] mm
L:  But we're just playing games.
R:  Yeah.  I was very, very shocked about the way I was treated at the border, not at the airport --
L:  You should be.
R:  -- at the border I was -- I was going back from Toronto.
L:  Yeah.  You've had a green card or ...?
R:  Oh, I'm a citizen, now.
L:  You're a citizen?
R:  Er, but, you know, it tells, in my -- in my passport, it tells you where I was born, so they knew --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- now, but it -- they treated not only me, but the -- you know, the way they spoke to people, to o- -- other Americans that were born in America.
L:  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.
R:  They way they -- uh, they -- they spoke, it was very, very impolite.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] you know.  You don't need to be impolite when you're talking to, you know, just asking questions --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you can do it politely.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It gives a very --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- bad image of Americans.
L:  It made you angry, right?
R:  Well, I -- I thought, well, these people maybe they have -- maybe they are not educated [LAUGH].
L:  They're afraid, I guess.
R:  [LAUGH] yeah --
L:  Not of you.
R:  -- look, I'm a sixty two year old woman [LAUGH], I mean, how could -- yeah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean [LAUGH].
L:  I know, it's funny.  I -- it is, it is funny.  Well, ah, I don't know, you -- you just can't -- you can't be paranoid, you have to carry on.
R:  Mhm.  Mm.  I -- I -- I was just sad about the, you know, giving a ba- -- bad image of this country when I chose this country because of people being so friendly to me and I have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- friends in America than I have in Iran.
L:  Mhm.  How often --
R:  I mean, American friends, not I- -- American.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My daughter lived in California with an Iranian College Professor last summer.  She rented a room in her house and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  She learned a lot about Iran and how to cook some food -- food and --
R:  Yes [LAUGH].  Yeah, Iranians are very much into cooking [LAUGH].
L:  Yes.  She en- -- she enjoyed it very much.
R:  And it takes ages.  A long time to took cook -- too cook [LAUGH] a Persian dish [LAUGH].
L:  [MN]
R:  Yes.
L:  When you go back to Iran --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- how are you treated there, as an American citizen?
R:  Well, ah, you know, people n- -- they don't n- they won't ask me if I'm -- 'cause I speak, you know --
L:  Yeah, I see.
R:  -- I was native of Iran.  They won't ask me, um, if I'm a citizen, where -- what country of citizenship [LAUGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but if I tell them, they don't mind.
L:  No.
R:  Of course, I'm not going to go and tell Amollah[?] that I am [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that I am --
L:  You have to wear the -- the, um --
R:  Oh, everybody has to.  Everybody has to.
L:  Not a burka, what do they call it in Iran?
R:  They -- they call it a scarf.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  We -- we just wear a scarf --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, -- it d- -- you know, it's not a -- some -- some
