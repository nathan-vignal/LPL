R:  Hello, my name's Matthew.
L:  Hi, Matthew, I'm Susan.
R:  Susan, nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you too.
R:  Um, I'm happily married and, uh, I -- I guess what I would look for ... in a life partner would be, um ... just similarities between the two of us.
L:  Mhm. What kinds of similarities?
R:  Uh, similarities like, um, maybe religion and education.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and ... you know, sometimes I think after a couple of dates you kinda know what they want out of life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you know if it coincides with what you want out of life.
L:  So, kind of similar values and priorities?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I know -- I know there's a lot of other things that are involved, but I think that's one of the most ... the -- the -- one of the 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the biggest things that people think about.
L:  Well, I would definitely agree with that.  I think ... [SIGH] to have a -- a good [SIGH] long term or lifelong relationship it's important to share similar values.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I'm -- I'm not married but the -- the kinds of things that [SIGH] I think, um, [LIPSMACK] are important, you know, along with values and priorities, like -- like you were saying, um [SIGH] ... are things like integrity and ...
R:  Definitely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just to -- just know that they're on the same ... playing field as you are.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  So to speak.
L:  And ... I guess that -- that probably is high on my list cause that's something I've, um [SIGH] ... had a -- bad experiences with in the past [LAUGH].
R:  Oh!  [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  So, you definitely want a guy who's got his head down where it belongs?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly in that --
R:  Feet on the ground.
L:  Yeah but, you know, is what he says he is and ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Represents himself ... accurately and [SIGH] you know, is willing to compromise when necessary and ... in --
R:  Well, and like it says, if a life partner -- I always think that before you get ... married or before you really devote yourself to a relationship, you should think, "Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  Is the vows that my wife and I made were, uh, we considered to be to God, you know, and to one another that we were going to be ... uh, you know, we were going to honor them and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- cherish them until death do us part.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, you know, I -- I know it's so often --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- now people get divorced.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But ... we seem real happy.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  We've been married for ... going on four years now.
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  And, um, we st- we don't have children yet but we're -- we're working on that.  We -- as soon as I get out of school, my wife has already finished her education and she's a mortician.  She got her bachelors at the University of Minnesota --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'm working on my bachelors here in Oklahoma.  We moved to Oklahoma and I wanna be a school teacher so I've got about two years left before I'm done and then we'll -- we'll start having -- hopefully having kids.  [LAUGH]
L:  That sounds great.  S- so it sounds like you've both kind of helped each other out as you've been going through school and --
R:  Definitely, yeah.  Yeah, you know she's -- if it wasn't for my wife, there's no way I could have made it 'cause ... you know, with -- with, uh ... I had a house before and I had debt and, there was no way I could do school and work the same, you know, the same -- do -- do them both.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so she helped me out a lot being able to, you know, afford going to school and giving me the courage to go, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, a partner just like that can ... be really helpful. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Invaluable, I think.
R:  I think it's, uh, good for a person in general just to be with somebody.
L:  Mhm.  I agree.
R:  Rather than to be alone.
L:  [LAUGH] I agree with that.  I, um [LIPSMACK] -- the guy that I'm dating right now who probably I will end up marrying, we'll see --
R:  Well good.
L:  -- is a -- he's a writer.
R:  Wow.
L:  And [SIGH] is, uh ... still working on getting published so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, we end up kind of helping each other out and ... encouraging each other so ...
R:  Wow.
L:  I think that's important.
R:  Oh, very important.  Always wanted to write a book.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I always thought that would just be the most fun.  Has -- has it rubbed off on you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or you're gonna try writing perhaps?
L:  [NOISE] No.  I -- well ... not, uh ... not fiction I don't think.  I'm not nearly as creative so ...
R:  Yeah.  Well, my wife and I both love to read.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh ... she loves to read more than I do, but we both enjoy it and, uh, she reads anything.  She -- most of the time was -- doesn't read fiction all that often, uh, but any more -- what else -- what is there but fiction, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  All the -- everything is pretty much but, uh, I guess I would say she doesn't read a whole lot of the space stuff and, uh, a lot of the far fetched fiction but she reads, uh ... like, lately she's been reading these stories about, um ... older women who help each other out.
L:   Mhm, wow.
R:  Who are either living together as friends, trying to cope with life and stuff and so she's been telling me some good stories about what she's been reading.
L:  And they're ... fiction or nonfiction?
R:  They're fiction.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, I guess right now she -- she's reading one about, uh, the same concept except they're -- it's set back during the civil war.  So, that one's kinda got a little bit of, uh, hi- history in it a- as well as fiction.
L:  That sounds great.  [SIGH] Well, you --
R:  So, how long have you been dating?
L:  Um, let's see.  About ten months now.
R:  Wow, okay.
L:  Yeah, and actually I was married before.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, so I was kind of interested about what you said about divorce because I have some similar feelings about that, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um [SIGH] ...
R:  It's just -- I don't know.  My wife and I talk about it 'cause we've had our secretary at the funeral home -- uh, she just started  an- and we really like her and, uh ... she got a divorce just like about two weeks ago --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and we went on vacation and everything was fine when we left for vacation but as soon as we got back ... she said everything had gone wrong and they're ge- they were filing for a divorce.  And we were -- and they're --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and some of the things I've heard about this guy or what he did to her and what he's doing and how he's abandoning his child and his wife is just ... you wonder what is he thinking, you know?
L:  [NOISE] So, it -- it sounds like it wasn't stuff that just came up all of a sudden but perhaps there were things that you didn't really see?
R:  Yeah, a lot of things that we hadn't known about, you know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, uh, it's just -- it's a sad deal for everybody.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That- that's part of the reason why I want to be a teacher is, uh, especially the elementary teachers I've -- I'm hearing people tell me almost every time I get a -- a chance to talk to folks around the school, that they --
L:   Mhm.
R:  -- that they, uh, they say that they -- they really are happy that I'm going into the field because children don't have the male role models anymore.  A lot of them, they're single -- you know, single parents and the mother's usually the parent.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The fathers -- they don't know where they are [LAUGH] you know?  And, uh, so I'm kinda -- I kinda feel like hopefully I'm doing my part if I could at least be a positive male role model I'll be doing my part.
L:  Yeah, so you wanna teach elementary school?
R:  Yes, yeah.
L:  That's great.
R:  I think I'd really like to teach second or first actually.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just because they seem so [SIGH] eager to learn and so happy to be at school.  And I know I was at that grade and as soon as I got into junior high and ... wa- you know, middle school and high school you just started thinking it was a drag, you know?  And so, I kinda wanted to be around where they were still happy, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, maybe you can encourage them to continue to enjoy school.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Well, let's see, I guess my wife and I dated for, um, [SIGH] ... right out about over a year before we got married.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  So, we're kind- we were kind of sa- you know, taking the same timeline as what you are.
L:  Yeah.  So, how old were you when you got married?
R:  I was, uh, twenty one when I got married.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And my wife, she was twenty two, going on twenty three.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, you know ... I think that was a little young but for some reason it seems to be working.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you know, it often does for many people.  I think -- and I think it -- it -- it's really depends on -- on the individual.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I agree with you one hundred percent there.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  I mean, it just -- some people are ready.
L:  -- I got married really young --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, so -- well, about a [LAUGH] -- I was twenty one but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- for me I -- I'd just -- you know, I wasn't ready.  I -- I hadn't really thought through what I wanted and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I got married for reasons that I don't think are really good reasons and ... and didn't really ... think about what I was doing clearly so ... I think there was just a lot of, um, pressure --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- from a lot of different sources so ...
R:  That sure is true.  There is a lot of pressure from family and from peers sometimes.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, there really can be, but I'm glad it's working out well for you.  That's good.
R:  Yeah, I -- like you said, I think some people at a young age are just m- maybe ready, more so than others and then ... you know, I th- I -- who knows what all that entails as far as why they're that way but I think both of us -- she's a little bit older than I am and, uh, we just seem to've ... been at the right points in our life ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for it, but like I said --
L:  That's important.
R:  -- I --I'm just so thankful to have somebody here with me every day --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because ... you know, I -- I -- as a guy, guys do crazy things sometimes and -- and if I was alone all the time ... [LAUGH] you know, if I was a bachelor, uh, heaven help me, you know ... 'cause -- sometimes, you know, you need that person there to keep your life safe.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Kinda keep you -- keep you in order.  But ...
L:  Well, it sounds like you really value her a lot too.
R:  Yes, I do and vice versa.  I mean, and you know, that's one thing I think you should look into as far as you were talking about, uh ... uh ... the -- well, I guess like their conduct.  How they ...
L:  Yeah.  How 'bout integrity?
R:  Uh, integrity, that's right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, that would be, you know, if -- whether or not they would value you as a person.  How much they, you know -- how much do they appreciate other people ... you know, and ... I knew right off, like, after the second date that she really did appreciate people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she appreciated the things that I would do for her and, you know, I certainly appreciated the things that she did for me.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, I think and for me, integrity really is, uh, at the top of my list.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There are a bunch of other things that I look for too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That, um ... kinda like you said, you know, common values and priorities and ... and the ability to -- to communicate and [SIGH] ... you know.  But I think at least for me, integrity is really right up there at the top of my list.
R:  Well, I would have to agree with you again.  Integrity, you know -- you know if somebody ... has that quality that they can't be all bad.  [LAUGH] If they -- you know, they're not gonna surprise ya. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hopefully ... anyway.
L:  Yeah, I would agree with that.
R:  It sounds like you ha- have a dog?
L:  Yes, I do.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I've got three cats.
