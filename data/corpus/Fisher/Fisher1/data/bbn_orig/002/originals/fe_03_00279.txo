R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  I'm Pat and you are?
R:  I'm Alvin.
L:  Hi, Alvin.  Ah, so what do you think about the topic?
R:  Um, I -- the topic is airport security.  I guess the question was, do we think that heightened security lessens the chance of terrorist attacks in the air?  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I certainly think that the chance of -- of that is far lower --
L: [NOISE]
R: -- now than it was before September eleven --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, um, mostly because we immediately changed the rules of engagement, ah, as it were, on -- on -- on dealing wi- -- with -- with hijackers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um.  Um.  And so, I think the next big terrorist attack will be planned for as -- by -- to be done by some other means -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and the chance of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what happened before, um, i- -- is greatly lessened.
L:  Mhm. [SIGH]
R:  What do you think?
L:  I agree. I, um, definitely think, ah, the increase of security will, ah, decrease the, ah, chances of terrorist attacks, um, ah.
R:  S- -- so, I'm in some sense they have heightened security, I am glad they're fortifying cockpit doors and basically saying that -- that hijackers will -- will not be able to access pilots and will not be able to get in the cockpits and will therefore have little incentive to -- to -- to try that, um.
L:  Not only doors, they're also adding, ah, undercover, um --
R:  Sky marshalls.
L:  -- marshalls and on the planes, um, in case anything occurs, then they would, um, react.
R:  Um, you know, I don't have a good sense of just what percentage of flights have sky marshalls on them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, they'd be rather swamped.
L:  That's probably a good thing.
R:  Well, it's good, you don't -- the -- the potential hijackers don't know which flights 
L:  Exactly.
R: -- they're on.  Um, but I guess -- well, I don't know how much good other security measures are doing with -- with this, like, randomly deciding which passengers to search or whatever.  I suppose that with the immediate measures taken that the threat of hijacking and using the -- the commercial airliners as, um, projectiles, um, has been greatly diminished, that the bigger issue becomes, um, um, explosives and -- being stored in -- in -- in -- in baggage and, um, other measures are being put in place to -- to address those, um, um, I don't know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- how well that's proceeding or how -- what degree of security it's -- it's providing.
L:  Mhm.  Right.  Um, hm.  How -- and on the other hand, how good is all this security if, um, attackers are going to be let into the system via different a route, for example if when you mention, you know, baggage handlers, um, you know there's a rumor that, ah, there were inside people that was involved, um, in the, ah, the hijacking, um, if people are employed that are -- are -- are potential terrorists, um, then n- -- no matter how much security that -- that has been put into place since September eleven, ah, they still have a way in to, ah, attack and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's through, um, being employed, um, what do you think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of that?
R:  Well -- well, yeah, part -- part of the new security is, um, ah, ah, investigating the -- the -- the people who will -- who are employed in, ah, various aspects --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of airport operations, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, indeed, the -- the part that's been federalized with the new transportation security administration certainly there have been large numbers of people, um, dismissed as -- as airport employees at some of the major airports, um, mostly for -- for immigration violations rather than being a -- a specific, ah, ah, security threat, but that's, ah, import- -- relevant aspect, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  --I guess.  I mean, of not only about baggage, but about the -- the danger of sabotage of some type, ah, to aircraft.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I remember that -- from that -- the -- the November crash in New York, there seemed to be some -- some chance of that baggage that did not turn out to be the -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- be the case, but, um, but, yes, anyone who has access to secure areas of airports, ah, is someone --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that -- like security system needs to address in terms of -- of, uh, assuring that they're -- they're -- they're not people who -- who would do harm.
L:  Right.  And, uh, do you currently or, ah, use the airport, um, do you like using the airport?  Uh, have you used the airport since September eleven?
R:  I've made, ah, two round trips to California since then, um, once --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for work and once on my own, um, I mean, I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- probably less anxious to fly than before more because of the hassle factor than because of, uh, ah, security concern, but, ah, if you're going coast to coast, ah, ah, there's much choice about what means of transportation, ah, to -- to -- to use --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, um, it probably ma- -- the situation makes me less anxious to fly for pleasure if I don't have a specific place to go to.  When I'm planning a vacation, I'm --
L:  I see.
R:  -- likely to choose, um, something closer.
L:  Did you feel any more secure because of the changes?  Did you fly before September eleven?
R:  Um.  Yes, um, um, sure.
L:  Because the only way you can really answer the question I just asked if you, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have some previous experience.
R:  Yeah.  I've flown mostly for work on -- on occasion I've gone -- I've made a trip actually to Greece for -- the summer of two thousand and one --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, so, I mean, rightly or wrongly I didn't worry about security be- -- before.  Afterwards, well, I was aware of it as an issue, but -- but -- but felt pretty -- pretty secure, um, um, so in -- in that sense I didn't -- I didn't worry.  Air travel -- traffic, uh, is basically, uh, uh, safer than the hijacking threat and in fact the hijacking threat may be lesser now than -- than -- than ever before, that is we don't these days have people who are hijacking planes for -- for money and that sort of thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, so, security as such doesn't worry me, but, uh, probably traveling by airplane, waiting in airports has become -- become rather less pleasant.  Um, what about you, do you -- you -- you get to fly much?
L:  Yes.  I -- I, um, certainly enjoy travel, uh, national and internationally, um, and I have, ah, flown to Florida since September of, eleven and, um, it was a very early flight --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I, ah, found that it was very, ah, simple to get processed, in fact I was running late and that was very silly of me, but I was really lucky because the guy just checked me in from outside, where I understand he shouldn't have done, or he wasn't supposed to do, ah, within an hour of time for the plane to leave, but I had only minutes.  So, it was really nice --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but I was really, ah, cutting it close.  Um, so then you have security where situations like that, uh, you know, um, I'm not a terrorist, but, ah, here is this woman who, ah, running late and why can't a terrorist, ah, play a role like that and there goes that bag right through, ah, the door because some helpful person, so, that's ah, another --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- um, element of the system that, you know, is going to break down, I don't, ah, I don't know if I feel more secure because people are -- are, ah, asking, ah, others or myself to take off my shoes before boarding the plane, ah, especially when I know that there are other people who are, um, not as cautious as -- as those people.  You know, I didn't see much of a difference except for longer lines. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  The lines are -- are longer generally, people are having to the come to the airport earlier so there are more people at the airport at any given point, ah, anything's [inaudible] but thi- -- this, so that you were allowed to do a curbside baggage check in less than an hour before your flight?
L:  Yeah.  I probably had, like, maybe fifteen minutes to get on board.  It was really bad of me, I just, um, it was very early flight and I just -- I thought taking a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- earlier flight would help me to avoid the long lines, but I overslept and, you know, yada, yada, yada, yada. Um --
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I know the concerns.  My inclination used to be to get early morning flights, but then when -- I remember planning my trip to California last summer thinking, "Well, if it's a six thirty, seven o'clock flight then I've got to be at the airport at four thirty, five o'clock, so I've got to be up, three thirty or something and I don't know --
L:  Mhm [LAUGH]
R:  -- if I want to do this".
L:  And the thing that [COUGH] interests me is this gentleman was more interested, or -- or, yeah, he was more interested in the tip that I would give him for being such a good man and helping me than --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, you know, um, my bags, you know, looking, um, [NOISE] -- you know, I don't know, I just didn't feel as i-
