R:  Heather Holmes.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  I'm -- I'm Corrine.
R:  Hi, Corrine.  This is Heather Holmes.
L:  Hi, Heather.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Good to meet you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, we're going to talk about, um, the security and the effect on what do we think, that there's a -- um, that we're safer because of the security, if there's a --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a decreased chance of --
R:  Terrorist attacks.
L:  -- attacks.  Yeah.
R:  What do you think?
L:  Well, I'm not too impressed with the security folks that I've seen --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so, ah, the way it's currently implemented, I don't -- I would say, no, I don't think that there -- I don't feel any safer, um, it seems that people don't really care much when they're checking -- I don't know if you've flown a lot --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- since -- in the last year, but, um --
R:  I actually --
L:  -- I don't know, what do you think?
R:  Yeah, I have flown a lot and I'm -- it's very inconsistent, um, I'll get stopped for even my jewelry on -- in one direction and when I'm coming back the other way I won't get stopped for things in my bag, you know what I mean and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it just -- it doesn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I'm not sure how effective it actually is.  I think that, um, it may be a -- somewhat symbolic, you know if --
L:  I think so, too, right.
R:  -- if people are feeling safer, you know, that may be part of the point, like what they, sobriety checkpoints?
L:  Yeah.  Like, we're doing something.
R:  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- talking about, yeah, like that sort of thing.
L:  Just doing something.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, no, I -- I think so, too.  But I don't think it really makes any difference, maybe it makes us feel better, but I don't really think that it makes us any safer, but --
R:  Right.
L:  But I guess it is good to feel like something is being done instead of nothing, because one of the most frustrating feelings is that if you think just nothing is being done --
R:  Right.  But, I guess I would ask them what is the role of law enforcement, then, you know what I mean, like, a- are they supposed to be there symbolically, are they supposed to be spending their time actually doing something that's going to -- 
L:  You mean all the -- the airport, um --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- security officers that we see standing around --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a lot of the time?
R:  Right.  Right.  I mean, could those resources be better used elsewhere --
L:  For something else?  Yeah.
R:  Or is that --
L:  I think so.  I think, for instance, one of the things that bothers me is when you -- when you're sitting on the plane and you see these, um, um, yeah, trucks coming and going putting the food on and everything, I wonder if those are well checked or not because --
R:  Which, which, I'm sorry, which bags?
L:  The people, um, carrying the baggage around, um, and bringing food and different things to service the aircraft.
R:  Oh, oh, you mean employees of the airline?
L:  Well, [inaudible] or employees of the airport or employees of the gas companies, you know, I wonder --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if anything is done to check them.  Maybe it is, but it doesn't, uh, seem so obvious to me when I'm sitting there on the plane.
R:  That's true.  Although --
L:  You know, it seems like a lot of airports you could easily get on to the -- the runways and the, um, um, the gate areas on the ground --
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  -- from outside, there not secure, at least where I've been you could easily get onto any of the runways --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just put on some clothes that make you look like you're working for the airlines and you could come across with anything in your bag and stick anything with the luggage.
R:  Mm.  I never thought about that.  I don't -- [LAUGH] it never occurred to me.  Um, I -- I was thinking about actually the fact that I -- I am glad that they do have security checks, I don't know that they do anything for terrorism or not, but I'm glad that people can't get on planes with guns, you know, I think that they would notice something like that.
L:  I would hope so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I still think that it's very like that they could get on with things and cause as much trouble as the people did on September eleventh because they didn't have any guns, from what I understand --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they just had knives.
R:  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely, but --
L:  But I -- I -- I think people can still get on with things like that, so that worries me, no doubt.
R:  Well, it's a deterrent, though.
L:  Yeah, I hope so.
R:  At least.  I don't know.  I mean, I would be more hesitant, knowing that there's a possibility that they might find it, to try to go through --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- security with something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that I'm not supposed to have.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know what else to do, but -- a- and still make it possible for people to fly and it seems like it is important for people to fly or the economy's going to be even worse affected, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I fly, I mean, I think it -- we're not too secure, but I think that, um, there are a lot of ways that people can cause trouble in this country without, um, just something about the airlines.
R:  Right.
L:  And I would be shocked if they -- whoever is trying to cause trouble tries to do the same thing twice, so I don't think that -- I don't think it makes that much difference with the checking of the airlines now because I don't think that's what's go- -- what's going to be the, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the sensitive point next time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  Do you continue to fly and do you worry about it?
R:  Do -- I actually fly more than I did before.  Um --
L:  On purpose, or ...?
R:  Oh, well not for that reason, but -- but just because, like, the situations in my life have made it so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that I actually fly more than before.  I guess I've probably flown about six or seven times in the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- last year.  I guess --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's probably about right.  And it usually --
L:  I think I have, too, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I'm usually -- I go back and forth, um, between two cities.  I'm not really --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- flying anywhere far.  But, um, I do notice the inconsistencies of security checks.  It's just --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I've --
L:  It's -- just you, personally, or to the other people around you, to, do you -- does that -- or can you tell --
R:  Well, I'm always flying alone --
L:  -- if it's inconsistent?  Yeah.
R:  -- so, I'm not sure what you mean by consistency, with what?
L:  Well, I mean, are there some airports that you fly through, or do you only through two, it may be hard to tell --
R:  Right.
L:  -- well you feel that people, um, that there's very little done to check flyers in other airports where you feel like, uh, there are a lot of, um, security staff around and, um, a very what appears to be -- they're all sort of checking the people getting on the planes?
R:  Right.  Well, I think, actually what's -- I've noticed is that it varies by time of day.
L:  Oh, interesting.
R:  It would --
L:  I haven't noticed that --
R:  Um.
L:  I think my part it definitely varies because I fly into several different airports, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  That --
L:  But at what time of day difference do you notice?
R:  Well, I usually fly either on Thursday, Friday and then come back on Monday and Tuesday, or, I'm sorry, Sunday and Monday and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- early, early in the morning, like six thirty, the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the days are some heavy checks, you know what I mean, like they're going through --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they're scanning everybody, you know what I mean, just -- it's the lines are a little bit slower at that time.  Um, about Sunday night it goes a little quicker.  [LAUGH] You know.
L:  Interesting.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I mean, it's --
L:  Well, in --
R:  -- just from my experience, you know.  But I don't, you know, it just occurred to me, but --
L:  Do you feel less safe then, Sunday night, or do you think it's all about the same anyway?
R:  No, but it's funny when I'm taking a re- -- weekend trip and I get stopped on the way there --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they check through my bags and everything because something went off but then on the way back it doesn't even beep.
L:  And it's exactly the same --
R:  And it's all the same stuff that I took with me and brought back.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And [LAUGH], you know, it happens --
L:  Well, that's a little strange.
R:  Right.  It happens a lot.  Actually.
L:  Interesting.
R:  I would say that -- I'm used to that, you know, happening and usually I'll -- I just expect it to go off --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  when I walk through because of my earrings and sometimes it won't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it just doesn't.  But it goes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it goes off in one direction and doesn't in the other.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So ...  That is my faith in the --
L:  You must have quite some -- some earrings, some heavy metal earrings [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, no, not at all.  Not at all.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Not at all.  Small silver hoops, my -- you know, they'll go off.  Where, you know --
L:  Wow.
R:  But only in one direction.  Or my hairclips --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess.  That's probably it.
L:  Oh.  Yeah, um, my husband, um, when -- when we're flying together, I notice that the buckle on his belt often sets things -- he almost always just has to take it off and hand it to people --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  It so often sets things off.
R:  Yeah.  In all directions, or just sometimes?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  But I had -- maybe we always fly at the same time.  I hadn't noticed this difference about the time.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, you'll -- you'll see.  You know how when you get on at the beginning of your shift, you're very energetic 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about what you're doing and then, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  by the end you're just not so much.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  But --
L:  Does it bother you if -- I mean, either way, does it make you irritated because you're in a hurry, or does it bother you if they're -- if you think they're not doing a good job?
R:  Um, what was the first part of that, I'm sorry?
L:  Does it bother you if you think that they're being very, very careful and you're in a hurry, or does it, I mean, does the security issue bother you a lot compared to what it used to --
R:  Um.
L:  In either direction?
R:  I actually didn't fly often at all over a year and a half ag --
L:  Uh-huh.
R: -- I almost never.  So, this has actually been mostly in the last year, so I don't notice a difference, only 'cause I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really have much to compare it to.  Um, but I usually -- I'll get there probably between and hour and an hour and a half before my flight and have no problem getting in --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- no matter what time of day it is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I just -- I haven't noticed a difference.  I mean, it's major city airports, too.  So ...
L:  The only time I notice a really, really slow process was th- the first month or so after September eleventh last year --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and it was -- it was quite noticeable, I thought, how long it took and I felt, "Well, you know, of course, they have to do this" but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, it was, um, difficult because you had to get to the airport so long in advance and I noticed what was inconsistent to me was at one time, um, it took about two hours to get through one airport --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so that I felt, "Am I ever going to make it or not?" and there was this long, long, long, long lines and then the, um, the next airport that I was flying through was on that same trip, again they were still saying that you had to be there three hours in advance --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- even for a domestic flight and there was almost nothing and we just zipped right through and --
R:  Sat at the airport for two hours.
L:  -- so we ended up sitting there for two hours.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know, it's hard to tell.  I'm -- actually I err on the side of caution and I show up earlier just in case because, you know, with all the changes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and the flights and what's going on with a lot --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- of the airlines, you know, you can't miss your flight or there's nothing you can do about it, you know.
L:  Right, right --
R:  So.
L:  Because it is your fault if you're not there at the right amount of time before.
R:  Right.  Right.  So --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I have a -- I think it's -- it's actually a pretty inconsistent, I think the security lines.  Some weekends it'll be busier than others, so I haven't figured out exactly what that perfect amount of time is to get there.
L:  Yeah.  I guess what they say now in some airports, an hour and a half and some airports an hour.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um --
R:  I don't know.  I usually -- I try to about that amount of time is what I usually --
L:  Have you --
R:  -- leave myself.
L:  Have you had any problem, ah, making a flight, ever, or are you always there in plenty of time?
R:  Only when it snows, but, no.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but that's not really the --
R:  Not really.
L:  -- security's --
R:  That doesn't count.
L:  -- fault.  Yeah.
R:  That doesn't count [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  But, no, I haven't -- I haven't had any problems making flights --
L:  Yeah, I haven't had any problems since that very first month, um, we flew somewhere, I think it was even in October, like just about a month after, and that was tough.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But then after that, it really hasn't been a problem.
R:  Were you there two hours early, or less than that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or ...?
L:  Yeah, like three hours early and still --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- we ended up fifth in line, um, we were just moved back and forth and back and forth and there were just, um, they were just, uh, being very caref- -- being very thorough --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, understandably and it just took a very long time to get through.
R:  How different is it now than it was a year and a half ago?
L:  Def- -- I think it's a lot faster now.  They're saying at some --
R:  Well, I mean, like over the summer --
L: -- airports it's just an hour.
R:  -- a year ago, not --
L:  Um ...
R:  -- not since September eleventh, but beforehand.
L:  Oh, before September eleventh?
R:  Yeah, how was it compared to how --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it is right now?
L:  Oh.  You could show up, you know, almost within ten minutes before the absolute deadline when the airline has the right to cancel your ticket and you could still walk on and --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and you could just dash right through security and, you know, just say, "I'm late, I have a flight to catch" and they would really
