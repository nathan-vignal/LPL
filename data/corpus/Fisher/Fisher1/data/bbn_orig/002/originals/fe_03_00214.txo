L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Anne.
R:  My name is Denise.  Can you hear me?
L:  Yes, I can.  Can you hear me?
R:  I'm on the speaker phone 'cause I'm trying to do two things at once. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  Getting a little dinner ready.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  Um, in New Jersey.
L:  Oh, so do I. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  And I'm -- I'm hoping that this, uh, rain turns into the ice they're promising.
L:  Oh, you hope it does?
R:  Yeah.  Most people don't hope, I know, but I have a nighttime class so I'm waiting to see if it's cancelled. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, I -- I just had the TV news on and although a lot of the public schools, um, have either said they're gonna close early or, um, adult classes are cancelled for the evening, I'm going to Mont Clare State and I -- so far they haven't cancelled classes.
L:  I go to Mont Clare State, too.
R:  Oh, that's probably how we've got the same, uh, uh, information about this project.
L:  Okay.  Well, let's talk about life partners.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] Instead of -- instead of, uh, Mont Clare State because we're not supposed to know each other, right?
R:  Right.  I guess, because they said, yeah, they wanted -- course, what they say may not be what they're actually studying anyway.
L:  Do you have a life partner?
R:  I believe I do.
L:  I don't.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I did.
R:  [NOISE] That -- that -- that was gonna be my next question, was there a time when you thought you did?
L:  Yes.  I've -- I've had two life partners. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I could top that.
L:  I wonder -- I wonder -- uh, you've had more than two?
R:  Yes.
L:  How many have you had?
R:  Well, I would say I've had three definite and maybe a fourth maybe that I thought were gonna be lifetime partners.
L:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH]
R:  Yup, yup.
L:  Well, to be a lifetime partner, do you have to take a vow -- the vow of marriage and declare --
R:  No. [NOISE]
L:  -- "I am your partner for life"?
R:  No. [NOISE]
L:  You don't think so?
R:  No, I think --
L:  That --
R:  I think it's just a matter of, um, I don't even think the commitment has to be spoken.  I think two people can tell if that commitment's there.
L:  [MN] Well, yeah.  I -- I would say you have to -- in order to say you're a lifetime partner, you have to actually declare it.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  That's why I say I've had two.  Of course, I have children also.  They're lifetime partners, aren't they?
R:  I never consider children to be a lifetime partner.  In fact, I consider children more like, um, something on loan to us until we, y- you know, give them the, um, essentials they need to be off on their own.  And then they're off on their own.
L:  Yes, well, that's -- that's true, isn't it?  Yeah.  So, what about, um, if you say --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that, um, that people could be gay and married, then how open --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- could it be to be -- if you were gonna say you had to be official --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what do you think about gay marriage?
R:  I think that that's the same thing as a lifetime commitment, a lifetime partner.
L:  Yeah, I think so, too.
R:  And I don't understand why so many people are so threatened by it other than that usually gets into a religious arena.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And even -- and even then it's, like, if one proclaims to be a Christian, you know, Jesus never married --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and Jesus went around with a bunch of guys.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  God knows what happened --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- in that olive grove. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, and we all -- you know, we know just from history that, um, bisexuality was much more accepted, like, in the times of the Greeks.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  So, well, yeah, I -- I -- you know, I think a lot -- I think gay couples can have lifelong commitments also.  I -- I don't think there's any reason not to.
L:  I think it's kind of a privacy issue.  Do what you wanna do.  But what about then polygamy?  Or, um, [LIPSMACK] um, like, Jerry Lee Lewis married somebody who was thirteen years old.  Is that okay?
R:  Who was married what?
L:  Jerry Lee Lewis, the rock music --
R:  Oh, yeah, married his, uh, thirteen year old cousin.
L:  Married his cousin who was, like, thirteen years old.  Is that okay?
R:  Well, you know, again it's just a societ- -- soc- societal norms change.  There was a time when it -- it was not considered ou- out of the ordinary to be married at that age.
L:  Right.
R:  And I think it was, you know, probably during the growth of our country, when people were moving westward, I don't think they waited till they were, you know -- definitely didn't wait till they were, like, twenty five.  They're getting married -- they weren't even finishing high school and they were getting married.  Most people only had an eighth grade education, if that.
L:  Yeah.  And women --
R:  So, I -- again I think it's kind of a societal thing and the -- and the times and, you know, who knows biblically speaking when they say certain people lived to be hundreds of years old, you know, we don't -- we aren't sure if they're talking about the same kind of year as we're talking about and ... you know, because we aren't living that long, so how could these people have lived that long?  So, maybe the whole concept of time was different.  And --
L:  Um --
R:  And, you know, and maturation.  [NOISE] This is, um -- I'm -- I only have two sons and they're both grown and on their own, but my friends have told me that their daughters started menstruating, like, in fourth grade.
L:  Wow.
R:  And, you know, they're only, like, eleven years old at that point.  So, biologically or physically one is ready to be married at that age, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  E- especially for those people who contend that the point of marriage is procreation.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible] like that, though. [LAUGH]
R:  But what -- what makes it -- what -- what are the qualities for a lifelong commitment or a lifelong partner?  How does -- how -- you know.  Now, you said you've had two and were -- were they ended, um --
L:  They were both -- well, to make a long story short, they were both mentally ill.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Unable to function.
R:  I had one that was mentally ill.
L:  Yeah.  What kind of --
R:  So -- so you kinda had to end it rather than letting nature end it?
L:  Uh, yes, absolutely.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Because they were a danger to me and the children.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, right.
L:  Uh --
R:  And so when you -- obviously when we go into these relationships we think they're gonna be lifelong.
L:  You know, I was talking with a guy the other day who said a scary thing to me.  He said, "You know, men get their meaning through their relationships with women".  And I thought, "Oh, my God, what a tremendous burden to put on a woman".
R:  Men get their meaning?
L:  That's right.  So --
R:  See, I would think most men get their meaning from their jobs.
L:  Yeah.  Well, this is what -- this is what he said.  'Cause he has a good job, but he's feeling very sad 'cause he broke up with somebody, feeling like he has no -- no meaning in his life.
R:  Right, right.  Well ...
L:  Uh, well, what -- and so, what you were asking, what is the -- what are the qualities --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in a lifelong partner?  Well, [MN] when I heard that, I thought, "Well, that's certainly not a quality".  A person has to find their meaning within their own self.
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  That's so --
R:  And that was one of the problems with the, uh, relationship I had where the person was a little mentally out of it.  Because, I mean, he literally told me I was his life and that -- at the beginning it was, like, "Oh, isn't this flattering?" until I realized he really meant it a hundred percent. [LAUGH]
L:  "How can I, uh, get away from him?"  Um, but, so if you -- if you take away that, uh, meaning, then you get to having somebody -- and right now I think I would just like somebody to kind of be there.
R:  Mhm.  I think that's what it usually does boil down to, that you want somebody who you -- who you know you can count on through thick and thin.
L:  That's right.
R:  You know, you want somebody who can be there for the ordinary times.
L:  Who you can have fun with, too.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  Where when he's there he's at least interesting [LAUGH] [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's right.  That's awfully right.  And, um, and that, you know, then it becomes difficult because, you know, that sounds like the definition or the description of a friend and yet most of us want more than just a friend in our lifelong commitment.
L:  Right.
R:  We want someone, you know, who -- where there's some kind of -- you know, we want some kind of physical sexual at- attraction also.
L:  But that kinda takes care of itself if you get along really well.
R:  You think so?
L:  Yeah, I think -- I think, um -- I think, uh, seduction beg- -- is -- is, like, a twenty four hour thing.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Uh, I mean, guys -- sometimes they'll call you up in the morning [inaudible] then when you see them in the evening and you're all, "Okay, yeah, I'll look forward to seeing you tonight" and then you see them tonight and they're in a bad mood or they wanna watch football or something like that.  Then the next time they call you at ten o'clock in the morning and say, "Gee, I'd love to see you" you go, "Oh, screw that". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Well -- well, that -- you're right because then if you're -- if you're already with someone, you're with them all day or a good portion of the day, so --
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  -- it's not just that, um, calling up and thinking they wanna be with you and then when they see you, yeah, it could be a different story.  Right.
L:  Well, you -- you were talking about dependability, perseverance, being there, st- -- you know, not changing all the time.
R:  Right.
L:  Making a real commitment to it.
R:  Right.  And -- and -- and -- and just enjoying each other's company.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  And it doesn't have to be anything extravagant.  That's why I said the ordinary times are also, you know, just really important.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, and I -- and I guess there must be people out there who are like that. [NOISE]
L:  I -- I hear --
R:  Right, and, um --
L:  Then you meet some of these people who supposedly have these fabulous relationships and you get to know them a little better and, yeah, it's not really all it was cracked up to be. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  But then I look at -- I look at older generation often and I think, you know, I think a lot of those people, like let's take my grandparents' generation, skip a generation, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they seem to -- I know, my grandparents married rel- relatively young [LIPSMACK] and they stayed together, you know, like, fifty years.  And I'm thinking to myself, did they love each other or, again, was it almost like --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- um, you just stick together because that's expected --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- of you at the time.  That's again your societal norm in which you're living.
L:  I don't -- I think they just didn't ever -- it just didn't ever occur to them to do anything else.  I -- they wouldn't have dreamt of getting divorced.
R:  Right.  And even if they weren't happy or fulfilled or satisfied, they just stayed together.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is that a lifelong commitment?  Is that a lifelong partner?
L:  Well, I admire long term marriages that have somehow managed to stick together.  I -- I really -- they give me satisfaction just seeing them. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, mhm, I agree.
L:  My brother -- my brother and his wife have been married almost -- well, like, for forty -- thirty five years, something like --
R:  Wow.
L:  And I know what they've been through to get there, you know.
R:  Exactly.  In other words, you know it wasn't all smooth sailing?
L:  That's right.
R:  Right, right.
L:  I -- I really admire that.
R:  Exactly.  I do, too.
L:  They both can be a real pain in the ass.
R:  What can?
L:  They both.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Well, we solved this problem, didn't we?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, we know what it -- we know what it takes.  We just have to find the person, you know, [LAUGH] who has -- actually, I think I have found that person again, so I'm very fortunate.
L:  I have a candidate.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  But a- actually I've been completely on my own for ten years 'cause this was just too much trouble.  I felt like too much -- it was too expensive to me.
R:  Ah.
L:  Trying to find a life part- -- uh, expensive emotionally.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Mentally time wise, energy wise, I would just rather be on my own, eat what I want, nobody's saying, "What?  You're having oatmeal for dinner?"
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  Or anything like -- I just couldn't have stood it.  I would've just screamed --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and thrown the damn bowl of oatmeal at him.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But now -- now I'm thinking, "Well, you know, maybe it'd be nice".
R:  Well, that's the whole thing.  We all have to be ready and -- and then you have to, you know, run into the right person at the right time.  I have a friend --
L:  Don't you -- don't you think no matter how old --
R:  -- who's been on her own for over ten years.
L:  Don't you think no matter how old you are, you repeat the same patterns [LAUGH] you repeated when you were a teenager?
R:  You know, that's interesting because when I was in a -- in a rather down feeling period between relationships, I thought to myself, "Now, why can't I just go out there and make a relationship hap-
