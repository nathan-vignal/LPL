R:  Hi, I'm Susan.
L:  Hi.  I'm Varsha.
R:  How are you today?
L:  I'm fine.  How're you?
R:  I'm all right.
L:  Uh-huh.  So ... are you married?
R:  Um, no, I'm not.  I have a girlfriend actually.
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH] So ... yeah.  So, what do you think about marriage? [SIGH]
R:  Well, I ... I think that their using the term life partner --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, is really kinda neat because, um, as you know, gays aren't allowed to get married in the United States and -- and, um, I think that -- that, um, to encourage monogamy and encourage, you know, stable relationships then --
L:  Uh huh.
R:  -- uh ... [LIPSMACK] it would be nice to have more, you know, civil unions or life partnerships or something like that to --
L:  Uh -- uh-huh --
R:  -- to -- to have.
L:  So, it's allowed here in United States, right?
R:  No.
L:  No?
R:  Um, between gays?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And lesbians?  No.
L:  Oh?
R:  Only Vermont actually has a civil union ceremony --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, but there -- um, it's not legally recognized in any other state.
L:  Oh.  I didn't know that.  Actually we are from India.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So -- yeah, in our country it's not ... [MN] considered to be a good thing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I was thinking, like, if you're [SIGH] legal and ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [MN] [inaudible] so what do you feel like?  Is it important to have a ... opposite sex life partner or just depends like ... it shou- the partner should be understanding and --
R:  Well, I think, like, the most -- probably -- I was trying to think while, you know, he was -- he was on there, um ... I think compatibility ...
L:  Hm.
R:  And ... and understanding --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, allowing for, you know, not -- not sweating the small stuff, not, um, getting upset over little things and keeping the bigger picture in mind.
L:  Yeah, right.  So, you mainly believe that it doesn't matter whether it's a male or a female, like ...?
R:  Right.  No, not at all.
L:  The facts -- the sex ... doesn't ... count in that?
R:  No, right.  Not at all.  And I know that, um [LIPSMACK] in America, it -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it used to be more common, but my ... one of my aunts and uncles --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, who are brother and sister --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- still live together and have never married and ... um, and then somebody actually who's my age who's about thirty five --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] lives with her brother and neither one of them are married, and, you know, I don't think that that's really what they mean by life partner but obviously that's something that works for them.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  And ...
L:  So, they get along well and --
R:  Right, right. 
L:  They haven't found each other --
R:  And I'm sure they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  When they do find somebody I'm sure they'll ...
L:  Yeah, they'll ...
R:  Get married and move out or whatever.
L:  But, uh, being in a blood relation doesn't come in between, like ... [SIGH] I don't know, like, being a brother or a sister and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, don't -- you don't think it -- it matters, like, if you are related?
R:  Well, I think that the -- the concept that, you know, keeps them together or that makes it work is that they're both -- that they're compatible with each other.
L:  Uh-huh.
R: Um ... [LIPSMACK] that --
L:  So, isn't it like ... more challenging if you have somebody you haven't known since your childhood and ...
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, definitely, definitely.  Now, are you married?
L:  Yeah, I'm married --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I have two kids.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So --
R:  And do you think, like, what -- what keeps you and your husband together?
L:  Um [SIGH], like, free -- uh, in India we generally don't have love marriages --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it's all arranged by our families and --
R:  Right.
L:  So, um [SIGH] actually, when we get married --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so that's where the love starts and [SIGH] I don't know, it's kind of [inaudible] which gets us together and because we don't know each other before marriage --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so we try to understand each other after marriage --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and we try to change accordingly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- our partners and try to [LAUGH] adjust.  And in, like, our culture, it's not just, uh, two people marrying each other, it's the families are also involved.
R:  Mhm, mhm.  So --
L:  So, any decisions like our ... family believes then everything is --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, basically it's [SIGH] from every side and once you have kids, you are bound and more.
R:  Right.
L:  And divorce and getting separate it's -- it's not much in our culture so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  --we try to -- if it's not working out very well --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we try to ... try to get it [MN] like ... [LAUGH] -- try to adjust, mainly, um, I should say it's not good, it's not fair, but i- in our culture, mainly ladies ... have to adjust a little more --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and ... But if she gets ... faithfully hurt, like, honestly she gets her, whatever [inaudible] doesn't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- share from her husband ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she is satisfied and she'll give everything what they like and --
R:  Right.
L:  It's just a little bit of caring --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and understanding.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, uh --
R:  And it sounds like there's a commitment by the families --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and by you in -- in -- in just entering into ...
L:  Yeah, that's [inaudible].
R:  -- the arranged marriage that you know that you have to make it work.
L:  That's true.  That's true.  That's also one point to, like [SIGH] -- um, because we don't have divorces and separations so much because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, the families always try to ... bring us back if we --
R:  Right.
L:  -- have -- are having some problems.
R:  Yeah, and I --
L:  So, there's a force from our family also.
R:  Mhm
L:  And because it's a big pain --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- regretting from each other [SIGH] so --
R:  Mhm.  And that -- that's something that probably isn't as strong in America.  I don't think we --
L:  Yeah, here I think it's more of goes and -- like, partners, uh, decision what you are -- you want to marry or --
R:   Mhm.
L:  -- you want to get separated.  What I have come to know, like, I have been here for two years now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and what I have seen, I guess, think if the families are not all that involved and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, I think maybe ... um, people don't care about that much --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of their family or -- I don't know.  Like, if -- if they just think after they are ... ideal person then they have the full right of their own ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- life.  [LAUGH] I don't know, it's ... 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, may be I have a wrong opinion but ...
R:  No, I -- I agree that I think people, when they get married they -- they're not looking at the long term and they -- they're not necessarily getting the support from their parents that -- that you might get in your culture.
L:  Mhm.  So, um, like, um ... [MN] some couples, they go on for their whole a -- whole of their life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with one partner --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, what do you think, like, works in that ... relationship than, like, people get divorced and get married two or three times and ...?
R:  [SIGH] Well --
L:  What is the difference?  Well, what does that making them stay together --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for ... what do you think is there, like, in your culture?
R:  [LIPSMACK] I -- you know, I ... [LIPSMACK] can't really go by any of my, um, relatives because my -- my grandparents are dead --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and my mom and dad are together.  They've been together for forty years --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- but I wouldn't say that they have a great relationship.
L:  No?
R:  Um, they ... you know they still are married and they live in the same house and they have dinner together and ... but they're not -- I -- I think as close as ... as people that, you know, some couples that you see on T.V. or ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um ...
L:  But, still they are together for forty years now?
R:  Yeah, they're still together and, um, and maybe for them it's just, you know, "What else is there?" you know?  "It's too late for us to get divorced".
L:  Oh.
R:  "It's not worth it to get divorced".
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um ... [LIPSMACK] the people that -- that I see who are older who enjoy each other --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- have the same interests and have ... have more in common --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I think --
L:  So, um, what do --
R:  Share the same hobbies or something like that.
L:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I just dropped you.  [LAUGH]
R:  No, it's okay.
L:  But, like, what do you think the separation reasons are here?  Like, they don't get along?  Because first they are in love with each other ...l
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they have a good relation and they'll continue for four years, five years --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and as soon as they get married --
R:  Mhm.
L:  What is like ... [LAUGH] why do you think it's just ... 
R:  [LAUGH] Mm, I think --
L:  [inaudible] all over.
R:  Yeah, it's ... I think, again, it goes back to that commitment that they -- that they're not necessarily seeing in the long run what they have to do to make it work.  They just -- they look at the immediate ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, they say, "Oh, let's get married" but they forget that after the weeding then there's the rest of their lives.
L:  Yeah, right, but ... like, I have seen some lesbian partners are not married --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but still like they're having a good time and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, having kids together --
R:  Mhm, true.
L:  -- and they're running a family very nicely and as soon as they get married ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- bang it's gone.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, what just a marriage thing makes it worse or ... I don't [LAUGH] -- I don't understand because if you can stay with that person for ... five, six years without --
R:  Right.
L:  -- getting married --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and live happily and have kids and everything.
R:  Yeah.  It might be money in that case because I know that -- that I think money problems and fights o- about money seem to be --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- at the root of a lot of, um [SIGH] you know, unhappy people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And maybe because the ... the families that we come from are so small now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, there's only one or two kids in a family --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Maybe three --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they're not used to sharing, they're not used to, you know, giving up things that they want in order to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- make other people happy.
L:  Happy, yeah, right.  That makes sense.
R:  So ...
L:  [LAUGH] Because, yeah, mainly in our culture, the girls are being brought up in a way where they are being taught that they have to give --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because while they're married they are connected to the boy's family.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  And they have to -- the -- th- that is the main family she is bel- she belongs to now.
R:  Right.
L:  So, her parents are like just -- she can go and visit them and ... stay there with them for a few days or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But mainly ... it's her husband's family so she is being brought up in way where she is being taught how to adjust and how to take care of the family and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I think that also makes [MN] -- though it's -- I won't say that --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- we don't have problems in our family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We do have lots of problems --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in mainly like, f- if, uh, mother in law and [LAUGH] daughter in law just staying together --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they have clashes and they'll --
R:  Sure
L:  -- just disagree to each other on each and every point and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it does make a difference but there's a commitment as you said that we have to stay together, whether they are fighting, whether they --
R:  Mhm.
