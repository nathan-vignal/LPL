L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  My name is Jordan.
R:  My name's Tim.  How're you doing?
L:  I'm good, Tim.  Where are you from?
R:  I'm in, uh, upstate New York.
L:  Okay, I'm at University of Illinois in -- in Illinois.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Go figure.
R:  Yep.  [LAUGH]
L:  All right.  Have you done this before?
R:  Uh, yeah.
L:  Okay, the last one I had was the first time.  It was both of our first time so I didn't know if you --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- knew what -- what the deal is so ...
R:  Well, [inaudible] ...
L:  Cool.
R:  I'm still not positive.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, uh, prt- pretty -- I guess you just talk about what you're supposed to be ... and that's it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and I didn't quite -- didn't quite get what the subject said it was about.
R:  It was, uh, September eleventh, what changes have you made in your life --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- uh, because of terrorists or ...
L:  Okay, since the terrorist attacks?
R:  In response, yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  You can go ahead if you want.  [LAUGH]
L:  Um ... 
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Well, I definitely say that I can appreciate my time at home with my family a little more.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, my dad ... fortunately wasn't in New York at the time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but he was supposed to go the next day.  So -- and, uh, he was actually going [LIPSMACK] to the ... you know, um, to the towers so --
R:  Right.
L:  Really very excited that he wasn't there.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, it was really unfortunate for [inaudible] him though because he lost, uh ... some people that he knew.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, clients and things like that, so he was ... he was pretty shooken up and it was -- it was weird to see my, uh -- my dad cry [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?  It -- I mean, it definitely hit everybody a lot and, um ... [LIPSMACK] I went out and ... you know, bought a flag like everybody else.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, I realized too, not only the importance of the flag, but after that, um, a big article in the paper came out saying, you know, there are veterans all the time that have these flags from like a zillion years ago --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and that's awesome, but you also have to make sure that you're respecting the flag --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- in a way that ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that you're not flying a -- a tattered flag, you know, that kind of thing.
R:  Right.
L:  So ... so that's that kinda thing.  [MN]
R:  Yeah, it definitely, uh ... [LAUGH]
L:  What about you?
R:  Um ... [LIPSMACK] I wouldn't say I really made any changes to my life.  Um ... I think I was conscious about the mail for a while.  I thought that was ... [LAUGH]
L:  You what?
R:  I was conscious about the mail.
L:  Oh, yeah!
R:  Because of that -- the anthrax.  Um -- 
L:  Yeah.  I kinda was too.
R:  Yeah, but I didn't really do anything different with it.  I just was kinda [LAUGH] --
L:  Kinda looked at it a little longer before you opened it up?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I did and ... I -- I wondered if I -- I should be doing something but that kinda ... uh ... faded away.
L:  Yeah, I don't know, um ... I'm a college student so I ... I was real cautious about my email.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I, uh ... switched email accounts and things like that because there were a lot of viruses and things going along.
R:  Yeah.
L:  With all of that.  So, I switched my email accounts ... and I was really --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- careful who I gave my phone number and things out to.  Like, I used to have it posted up as like the signature on my emails so everybody --
R:  Right.
L:  -- who got an email from me would have my phone number and I was like, "Oh, maybe that's not such a good idea anymore" --
R:  Oh, that's interesting.
L:  -- that kinda thing, you know?  And, uh ... I -- I kinda feel like you do.  I don't know if I've made any drastically significant changes but I think I'm able to appreciate things a little more.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah, I can -- I, uh ... definitely -- I -- I'm sure as everyone did, I ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- did a lot of thinking about a lot of different things, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm in New York State but ... I'm like three hours away so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] And I'm in a pretty small town really.  A small city so ... 
L:  [inaudible].
R:  -- I think I still, even though [LAUGH] I was- I'm not that far away, I've ... felt far away from the real ... the real incident.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I didn't really feel like --
L:  Have you been in to see the memorial or anything of that part?
R:  Um, not really.  Um, I've been there.  My brother lives in Brooklyn --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I went to visit him but, um, I didn't wanna ask him to, like, go there 'cause I didn't know how he felt about it.  [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible] yeah.
R:  Yeah, so ...
L:  Yeah, I feel like --
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  -- sometimes ... kind of like when you talk to ... people of older generation about the World War, you know? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I feel like that's kinda one of these topics now or ... where people either --
R:  Yeah, [several inaudible words].
L:  -- [inaudible] want you to know about it or they don't wanna talk about it at all.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Um ... [LIPSMACK] but I have to tell you, I have heard this really strange thing on the radio the other day.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um ... [LIPSMACK] you know, it was just one of those kind of ... listen to this article, this is weird.  They had run it in the newspaper that day where some lady ... um, in New York, who was a landlord --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and ... she ... um ... there was a lady who had rented out an apartment from her who died like on September eleventh.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, they'll -- the tenant's family wanted to go back and claim some of her belongings --
R:  Right.
L:  -- out of her ... apartment.  Well, the landlord wouldn't let them in --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because supposedly the tenant didn't sign ...
R:  Oh.
L:  -- a permission form to say that they could come in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- before she, like, died.  I mean, is that the stupidest thing or what?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  She prob- she probably had to worry about ... uh [NOISE] um, the legal issues involved, you know, because --
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  -- you know, she lets them in --
L:  But still, can you imagine --
R:  -- [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- being -- being that family and not being able to --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- go in?
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know.  That would've really upset me.
R:  Sure ... but she probably was worried about being sued or taken to court over it.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I also ... [SIGH] have to say that ... um [LIPSMACK] ... oh, I was gonna tell you something and I forgot!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um [LIPSMACK] ... oh, I used to travel a lot --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I don't travel as ... much anymore, just because I don't have to.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I do like to travel.  I definitely find myself being a lot more patient.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, going through ... and, um --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I went ... out of town on Chr- about Christmas after September eleventh.  You know, the security at the airports were just -- it was just tremendous --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I have to tell you ... I flew [LIPSMACK] from Chicago to Atlanta to Florida, [inaudible] back to --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- Atlanta ... and back to Chicago.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And not once did I get searched.
R:  Right.
L:  And I was, like, okay [LAUGH] you know, little old me, but still ... I could have done ... who knows what, you know?
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  But then my dad traveled the day after I did and he got searched every single place he went.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I was, like, huh, they should, like, tag you once they've searched you that you're fine.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  So --
R:  I -- yeah, I was curious about that myself, like, how they select the people because ... um, I haven't flown in a while now but, um, I did fly this past summer, I think, and I wa- I didn't think it was weird that it seemed like, yeah, they were searching some people, and maybe more than in the past, but really, not a whole lot.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and they were --
R:  And --
L:  -- it was mostly they would kinda like ... "Oh, all right, you're fine" you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm like, "All right, so I've got, you know, a nail file in my pocket" you -- I don't know.
R:  Yeah, you never know.
L:  And I -- that same trip it was kind of odd.  I was flying with a bunch of guys from the naval academy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- who were friends of mine, and they're all, you know, in their naval dress.  
R:  Oh.
L:  I mean, "Look, oh, there go all the navy boys" you know?
R:  Right.
L:  And of course ... out of all the people to search, they search [LAUGH] maybe the like top ranking people that were there, and he's like, "What the heck?" you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  "I'm in the Navy!  I work for you people.  Why are you searching me?" [LAUGH] but it --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I don't know how they determine it.  If, like, the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- computer randomly picks and says, "Search this person".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because, um ... uh, when I flew, it's funny, uh, I saw a priest get searched on the way out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and one got searched on the way back which ...
L:  Oh.
R:  -- yeah, anyone could disguise themself as a priest but [LAUGH] ... 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- still I thought it was funny that out of all the people ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it was very -- very ironic.
R:  Yeah.  I have a [LAUGH] funny dentist story about a ... [LIPSMACK] plane -- them searching ... um, baggage and stuff is that before September eleventh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I had went to Jamaica and on my way back, I had [LAUGH], um, an empty beer bottle in a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- luggage 'cause I was --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I just wanted to bring it back as a souvenir --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they found it and they told me I couldn't take it on the plane.  That you can't take an empty beer bottle on the plane, only a full one which [LAUGH] I don't know what the reasoning is --
L:  I tell you, what's the difference?
R:  Right, [LAUGH] but, um, but I still am kinda amazed because I'm like, how come the Jamaican security could find an empty beer bottle in my luggage, and like, they couldn't find, like, the weapons these guys had and still people like are bringing [LAUGH] guns and stuff -- 
L:  Yeah, no kidding.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No kidding.
R:  It's kind of, uh, weird to me.  I don't -- I don't get that exactly.
L:  Yeah, and you always hear too -- I think this is so funny -- I'm sure there's like millions of reasons why they can't do it, but the little black box in the airplanes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, like, why don't they make the whole airplane out of the black box stuff?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know?  People always say that and, I mean, I'm sure there's billions of reasons --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- why you can't but ...
R:  Well, it wouldn't fly.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you think about it.  I mean, come on!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ...
R:  Um --
L:  I don't know.
R:  From what I understand --
L:  But, uh --
R:  -- that black box always doesn't -- doesn't always make it either.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's true.
R:  But, uh, I always [LAUGH] --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- I always used to have this idea of why don't they make 'em out of like, uh, inflatable ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  [LAUGH] 'Cause I -- um, I don't know if you've ever seen 'em but they usually fill like inflatable airplanes like at a fair or a carnival or something.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I always used to think, "Oh, why don't they make real planes out of this?"
L:  [LAUGH] Ah, that would be funny.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh ... I do have to say though that -- that time during Christmas and I was telling you I flew ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I consider myself to be a pretty open minded person and, you know, I'm friends with all kinds of different people, but, uh ... when the one guy on the whole airplane came on in a turban and robes ...
R:  You --
L:  -- and he didn't speak English, I was like, "Okay!"
R:  It didn't make you nervous?  Yeah.
L:  But of course he -- he sat right down beside me and I was like ... "Hi".  If at all I was gonna be nice to this guy [LAUGH] so ... you know, if anything happened, he'd be nice to me.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] So ... but then he pulled out these books in a completely different language and I was kinda like ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- okay!  Luckily that was the flight that wasn't so full so I went to the bathroom and kinda sat down in a -- in a different part of the plane.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  I mean, it really -- it really changed my perspective on things and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I hated that because I hate to be that kind of person, but ... I felt uncomfortable, you know?  I really did.
R:  Definitely.  I had the same experience, and it -- that's pretty awful because it's basically like racial profiling [LAUGH] but ... you're like --
L:  I see, but how can you help yourself, you know?
R:  You can't 'cause you're the person on the plane and you're like, well, you know it's not like you say anything or do anything but you're kinda just more aware of what that person's doing --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- because you're just --
L:  But I did feel better though because he was the very last person on the plane --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- which I knew it was a holdup because he had gotten searched --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so that made me feel a little bit better.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So -- and I got home safe.  I [LAUGH] mean, it was late ... so, I don't know --
R:  Yeah, that would be one thing I'd say --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- has changed is when I flew.  Like, I was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just more suspicious of everyone in general and ...
L:  Mhm.
R: -- just, uh ... more observant.  But in my day to day life ... um, obviously because I don't live in a area that -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is really a possible threat for terrorism -- well, not likely, so ... I just --
L:  Yeah, well, I have to say though --
R:  -- [inaudible] tough but --
L:  -- even those people ... you know, even the people that were there, sure they think about it every day but it's not gonna be on their mind twenty four hours a day either ...
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  -- you know?  Like, even when something bad happens to me in my life ... I kinda get past it, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'm sure ... you know --
