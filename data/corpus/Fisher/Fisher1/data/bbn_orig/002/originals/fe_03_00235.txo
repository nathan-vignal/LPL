R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  I'm Jenny.
R:  I'm Abba.
L:  Hello, glad to meet you.  [LAUGH]
R:  Nice to meet you too.  This is my first time doing this.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, this is my second time so I'm experienced, right?
R:  Well, you start then.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  The topic is life partners, correct?
R:  Correct.
L:  Um ... like, what do we ... desire in our life partner.
R:  I think so.
L:  Um ... well, I for one ... think honesty is one of the most important things.
R:  I was gonna say the same thing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And definitely a sense of humor.
R:  Oh, I haven't given much thought.  Honesty --
L:  [several inaudible words] --
R:  -- and, um, commitment.
L:  Yeah, that's very good too.  Uh ... and of course, it always helps if the person has a good faith.  It doesn't necessarily have to be the same faith as mine, but he has to have some type of belief in God.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, I mean, that's just my thoughts.  [LAUGH] What are your thoughts?
R:  Okay [SIGH] a life partner ... [SIGH] Um, well, gosh, commitment really is -- covers the whole thing.  You know, if he says something ... he has to stick to it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, uh, doing things together --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as well as allowing one to do things apart.
L:  Correct.
R:  Trusting each other.
L:  Correct.
R:  That's it.
L:  Well, that's ... that says a lot. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It, um ... [LIPSMACK] there are so many different kinds of people out there that ... in order to find that one person that has all of these qualities, [LIPSMACK] it's kinda hard to do.  Um ...
R:  Well, if you're lucky ... it happens.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right.  Luck plays a lot into it but then also I think sometimes when you have the same general ... oh, what do I say?  Um [LIPSMACK] type of things to do ...
R:  Things in common?
L:  Yeah, right.  That that always helps I think.
R:  That's where it all starts.
L:  Mhm.  [MN] So ... oh, let's see, what else do we like in our men?  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I think you just ... ah, well, you just grow together and the longer you stay together, the easier it is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, the more attached you become the longer you stay together, if it's a life partner.
L:  That's correct.  Well, it, uh ... uh, in this day and age, there is so much ... oh, how do I say it ... fastness about things.  Yet some people don't ... put their ... [SIGH] whole commitment in working things out and, um, toughing it out if -- if you go through a bad time.
R:  That's right.
L:  Um ...
R:  So, like they say, it takes two to tango.
L:  That's right.  That's right.  So ... um ... other than that, I'm trying to think what else.  [LAUGH]
R:  What was the question again?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Just life partners ... [LAUGH] but I'm sure we can talk about something else if we want too because we have given our general idea.
R:  Okay.  How -- how long are we supposed to do this?
L:  Uh, they will ... they will let us know about a minute before the time is up.  It's usually about ten minutes.
R:  Okay, how long have you been with your life partner?
L:  Uh, actually we were married thirty eight years.
R:  We've been thirty three.
L:  Oh, right.
R:  Got a good match here.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, good.  Well, mine passed away so ...
R:  Oh, I'm sorry. 
L:  That's all right.  It, um ... I've got wonderful memories and that means a lot.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um ... and --
R:  Wow.  And my mother was married thirty eight years when my dad died.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then she remarried for twelve years.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
R:  Her -- her, uh -- my dad's brother.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, how interesting.
R:  Yes.
L:  Well ... you know, sometimes it is the closeness among ... you see these people, you know ... more often than, um ... and you get comfortable with them and whatever.
R:  That's right.
L:  I think that's one of the hardest things ... I'm finding out is to be comfortable with another ... person other than my ... husband, you know?  Because it's like you say, you've gotten used to each other's ways.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, you can almost finish their sentences ...
R:  That's right.
L:  Um, it's just a whole different ballgame.
R:  I could not imagine finding another life partner.
L:  Yeah.  That's the way I feel now too.  Uh, he passed away two years ago and, um, I know some people that ... have remarried --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- sooner than this, but right now it just does not ... appeal at all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know what I'm saying?
R:  Mhm.
L:  You need a life partner.
R:  Right.
L:  [several inaudible words].  You don't need someone just ... [SIGH] to say you're married.
R:  No.
L:  You know? 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, uh ... well, I think we did pretty good if we ... both got one for thirty years, that's wonderful.
R:  That's right.  That's right.  And it keeps getting better.
L:  Well, wonderful.  Yeah.
R:  We're both retired and we just enjoy even more time together and we enjoy a lot of time apart.
L:  Oh, wow.  So, do you do some traveling then too or --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yes, we travel in a motor home and we've ... both like golf and ... I go and ... play volleyball and he goes and plays poker and ... [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.
R:  -- you know, we just go our own way and we ... and we've -- and we're together a lot.
L:  Right, yeah, I see -- I know what you're saying.  You can be together but you have to each have your own little separate things too.
R:  You have to.
L:  Yeah, right.  It, um ... especially if you're both retired.
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  You can't both be together the whole time, it would just gnaw on each other, you know, and it would drive a wedge between you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um ... [MN] ...
R:  I mean, there's a lot of things that are so different.  We don't like the same television shows ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we don't like the same food ...
L:  Right.
R:  -- but we compromise a lot.
L:  Why sure.  That -- that's part of it.  Yeah, that's, uh --
R:  And that's the trouble with a lot of kids today is, uh, the compromising.
L:  Mhm, I agree with you.
R:  They're selfish.
L:  Yeah.
R:  As the generation.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think we brought them up that way [LAUGH] maybe perhaps.
L:  Well ... I tell you, to be truthful about it, I really worry about the future for the children and grandchildren. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I'm sure our parents did the same thing when we were growing up.
R:  Yeah.  But I'm like, my kids, you know, I think they're -- they're more taken -- the more they mature, they're more, you know, like -- like us.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, you know, they're treating their children, I think, like we treated ours.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um ... that's not bad.
L:  But there's always the scary thing that they could get into the wrong crowd.
R:  They've done that, been there, done that and -- and passed it --
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's hard.
R:  -- and then came out ahead.
L:  Yeah, that's hard.
R:  And was thankful for it.
L:  Right.  But, uh, there again ... having the right partner I think helps.
R:  Right.
L:  You've got that base.
R:  And you've got backup.
L:  Uh-huh.  Right.  So ... so where do you like to travel?  Just all over or ...?
R:  All over the countr- all over the United States and Canada.
L:  Oh, my goodness, how wonderful.  Where was your favorite?  Was Canada the -- your favorite?
R:  I was born there.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh!  Well, no wonder!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I still have family there.
L:  Well, my, uh --
R:  We're going there, um ... next year for a reunion.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, we -- we're just gonna take about two months and go up there and go round the northeast and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- around.
L:  It's interesting because my daughter's in college and one of her room mates is from Canada.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, uh ... I thought that was ... and she says she's, um, she was telling me about their -- your Thanksgiving.  That's a different time?
R:  Right.
L:  And I had never heard that before and she thought -- she thinks that's just wonderful that she gets to have thanksgiving twice.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, uh ... well ...
R:  When you were talking about two different faiths, you know, my husband is -- is, uh, Baptist and I'm Jewish, so we celebrate Hanukkah and Christmas so ... 
L:  Well, there you go.
R:  [LAUGH] We get to have two holidays also.
L:  Uh, right.  And it -- and it's, like I say, it's your uniqueness to each other ... that ... helps build your marriage even though you have different faiths, you have different ideas, but th- you know that you love each other --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, as you say, he's your life partner and you work it out; you compromise.
R:  That's right.  I just -- you know, I just want this life -- I know -- I know I'm [LIPSMACK] I feel bad that your husband passed away.  I just want this life to last ...
L:  Forever, right?
R:  -- forever.  We promised when we got married that we would just try it out for a hundred years and see if it worked.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That was what we decided back then.  [LAUGH] And then we'd -- then we'd discuss.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, uh, we've got a long way to go and, you know I just want to -- I just want it to be, you know, another ...
L:  As many years as it can be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, yes.  I know what you're saying.  It, uh ...
R:  I mean, I just treasure every moment that we're together.  I treasure it.
L:  Well, you're one of the lucky ones to recognize that.  Um ... so many people take ... love for granted ... and they don't -- they don't thank God for it, you know.  They just kinda go from day to day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But now, see, you -- you understand what's going on and, um ... I think God has blessed you in that respect.
R:  Mhm.  And I thank him ...
L:  Yes.
R:  -- so much.
L:  Wonderful.  So, what other hobbies do you have?
R:  Oh, besides sport?  Oh, I'm into, um, video editing, uh -- yeah, I -- I do a lot on the computer.  I'm, um -- I edit video and ... put it back on CDs or ...
L:  Oh.
R:  I've done, you know, lots of hobbies.  Like, you know, like I did a wedding last week and my husb- my husband's high school reunion.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I don't ask to be paid for it.  I just ...
L:  You enjoy doing it?
R:  I just enjoy doing it.
L:  Uh-huh, well, that's great.  Huh. 
R:  And -- and, you know, family, genealogy and ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um ... I -- I've been ... I've got fifty nine family members that I send a family newsletter to.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my.
R:  Emailing.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  That's a lot of fun.
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  I mean, that's from my great grandparents to children.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's the reunion we're going to.
L:  Okay.  Now, what will the weather be like then when you go?
R:  In August?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It'll be ... probably in the seventies.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Seventies, eighties maybe.
L:  Hm.  Well ... uh ... one of my hobbies is, I love to bowl.
R:  Oh.
L:  I love to do that.
R:  What's your average?
L:  Oh, it's about a hundred and sixty.
R:  Oh, that's wonderful. 
L:  Well, it's not too bad for an old lady.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
