R:  Hello?
L:  Hi [LAUGH] who is this?
R:  [LAUGH] Um ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My name is Steve.
L:  [LAUGH] You're -- I'm sorry?
R:  [LAUGH] My name is Steve.
L:  [LAUGH] Your name is Steve?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, no, not really.
L:  [LAUGH] Ok- your name is Dave, I'm sorry.
R:  [LAUGH] My name is Joshua.  What's your name?
L:  [LAUGH] My nam- my name is Jennifer.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, hi, Jennifer.
L:  [LAUGH] Hi, Joshua.  So ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- what was the topic?  Life partners, right?
R:  Yeah, what -- what do you think is the most important thing to look for in a partner or something?
L:  [LAUGH] I mean [LAUGH] it's very important that people have compatible schedules.
R:  Do you?
L:  I do.
R:  Wow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's not, uh ... have you had some problem with incompatible schedules?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Haven't you ever noticed that, like, nature tends to pair larks with -- it's like pe- morning people end up with like night people and night people fall in love with morning people and it's all very sad.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's sort of a major form of birth control.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Maybe.
L:  Hm.
R:  I used to work -- I used to work nights and the people I used to work with on the night shift had, uh ... had spouses who worked on the day shift and it worked out perfectly because when they had kids then one could take care of the kids during the day and one could take care of the kids at night.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, that's --
R:  You're saying you're not sure how they have the kids in the first place?
L:  That's right!  [LAUGH] That is what I'm saying.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That is what I'm saying and -- and you see, and this -- this keeps a lot of the population down in the world.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ... what are some other things that I think would be important in a life partner?
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Be good if ... well, I don't cook so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you know, me personally, like, it'd be a great thing if I could meet somebody who could cook.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know ... so.
R:  Yeah.   I don't know.  I can cook and I never think about that.
L:  No?
R:  I don't know.  I guess, uh, maybe you just look for the things that you don't already have.
L:  No, that's not necessarily true.  I mean, sometimes there're things you -- you have and you are and you want more of them.  You know, like people who are outdoorsy ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like ... and athletic for example, often like to be with people who are athletic and outdoorsy.
R:  That's true.
L:  So ... 
R:  Good point.
L:  -- do you consider yourself athletic and outdoorsy?
R:  Um, not that much.
L:  [LAUGH] No?  You're an indoorsy person?
R:  I don't think so.  Yeah.  I -- uh ... not -- not indoorsy as much as ... well, I don't know.  I don't go out of my way to do, uh ... outdoorsy kinds of things.  Not that I don't like them.
L:  Hm.  So, what are some outdoorsy things you like?
R:  [SIGH] Uh ... [MN] what I want to do that I haven't done since I was a teenager is kayaking.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  I'd like to do that and I haven't had a chance to in ... ages.
L:  You used to go kayaking when you were a teenager?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Did you do that a lot?
R:  Yeah.  My family was --
L:  Do you know how to flip the kayak back over?
R:  -- into it for a while.  I'm sorry?
L:  Do you know how to flip a kayak back over once you're upside down?
R:  No, we didn't try to do that.
L:  Well, then -- then it's ... basically canoeing with a skirt, right?
R:  It's kind of.
L:  [LAUGH] I mean --
R:  Hey, you're not required to flip it over.
L:  No, I [LAUGH] I guess you're not supposed to flip it over --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but the whole idea is like, you know, the difference between a kayak and a canoe is you can get the kayak back over once you've gone upside down, right?
R:  Yeah.  That's true.  So --
L:  So ...
R:  -- does this pertain to life partners?  Does it matter?  Were we required to stay on topic?
L:  Um, no, I think we're allowed to drift a little bit but --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- but, uh ... you know, but you see the thing is you can have somebody who is like a kayak fanatic, right?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You wouldn't want to pair them with ... uh, like, a -- a -- a librarian --
R:  Hydrophobic person?
L:  Well, yeah, like a librarian.
R:  A hydrophobic librarian.
L:  A hydrophobic librarian who's a l- got -- what's the -- the word, when going out in the sun makes you break out?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  When you become, um ... not photosensitive but -- but, uh, yeah --
R:  I have a friend who has that.
L:  -- has like a sun allergy.  Really?  Do --
R:  I have a friend who has that.  She has to stay inside.  She gets ... attacks of it and has to stay inside all the time.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that's awful.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I mean, because you -- you'd basically have to wear like total body sunscreen and that includes like your scalp, you know, so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's, uh, it's not any fun when that happens.
R:  Yeah, well, she -- yeah, I don't know.  She just stays inside.  She -- she doesn't go out.  Last time she had -- she had -- she says she had it for like a year at a time and she basically has to stay in and, uh -- especially during the day.
L:  Wow.
R:  And she just went home to her parents' house last time it happened and stayed there for six months.
L:  Oh!
R:  Yeah, it doesn't sound fun.
L:  No.
R:  So .... I don't know if I'd --
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, I don't know how I'd react if I had a partner who was like that.
L:  It had to be --
R:  I suppose I had one [inaudible].
L:  -- outta the sun?
R:  Yeah.  It was just, um, that limited.
L:  Yeah.  You sh- so what were you saying, I'm sorry?  You suppose you --
R:  Yeah, I suppose I had one who was kinda like that.  She just refused to go out most of the time.
L:  Mm.
R:  There was always a reason why, usually allergies or something like that.  "I can't go out; I have allergies.  I can't go out for this reason or that reason".
L:  Allergies?  Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said alligators!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Usually it's the alligators, you know!  [LAUGH]
R:  Also a good reason.
L:  Well, you know, if you're in Florida, I mean, I don't know where you are but ... you know --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- if you're in Florida or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, 'cause of the alligators so ...
R:  I just saw a movie about Florida --
L:  In which case you should like move to Minnesota.  You just saw a movie about Florida?
R:  Yeah.  It wasn't about Florida.  The -- the characters show up in Florida at some point and they were wandering through the swamps and there were alligators around so ...
L:  What movie did you see?  Did you go see Adaptation?
R:  Adap- yeah, Adaptation.
L:  Oh, was it good?
R:  How did you know that?
L:  Because they go in swamps in Adaptation.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  They go in Florida.  That's where they go hunt the orcas.
R:  Yeah, I didn't realize.  Right.  I didn't realize about that.
L:  Yeah.  No, yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, it was fairly good.
L:  Well, see, that's another thing.  Like, if you have somebody who really loves movies you should pair them with somebody who doesn't see the point of going out to movies.
R:  Yeah, or somebody who wants to see the next Paulie Shaw movie or something, or Rob Schneider movie.
L:  No, no, there's some people who love movies who want to see the next Paulie Shaw or Rob Schneider movies!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I'll have you know!
R:  I don't know about that.
L:  I -- I could be going to see a ... you know, I saw the trailer for "The Hot Chick" last night.
R:  Right, but do you want to put that person together with ... uh, uh, Mr. Merchant Ivory?
L:  Yo- you know, the thing is I think that happens a lot more than you think.
R:  Really?
L:  And gen- well, come on, have we not all seen pairings of Paulie Shaw guy with Merchant Ivory girl?  Uh, yeah!
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Yeah!  Yeah!  They both dismiss because she just says, "Oh, he's just being a guy" and he's like, "Oh, she's just being a girl".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it's like no!  You are Paulie Shaw people and Merchant Ivory people ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L: -- you know? 
R:  Right.
L:  Although, um ... [LAUGH] I did see a -- a write up of Maid in Manhattan where they said it doesn't bode well for Ralph Fiennes that, uh, already this -- this -- this person was writing that in the subways, uh, in the -- in the New York city subways where they have the, um, signs up for the new movie, "Maid in Manhattan" with him and -- and, uh, Jennifer Lopez --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that -- that they had -- that -- that this auth- this, uh, critic was saying she'd already seen graffiti that -- that had the words, "How gay am I" coming out of Ralph Fiennes' mouth? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Is he?
L:  Oh, no!  No, no, no.
R:  I don't know.  No?  Okay. [SIGH]
L:  Oh, hell no!
R:  I'm in New York actually.
L:  What?
R:  I'm -- I'm calling from New York actually.
L:  Oh, you're calling from -- so, have you seen this sign?
R:  I have -- I've -- no, I've seen the posters for the movie but I haven't seen that written on there.
L:  You haven't seen that written on that yet right?
R:  No.  Yeah.
L:  You just probably need to -- you'll probably like go about your way and -- and tomorrow you'll see that particular sign.
R:  Yeah, I'll keep my eyes open.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, and then -- you know, there're like the ... the rock'n'roll guys and the show tune girls and things like that.
L:  Oh ... well.
R:  I don't know -- I don't know how that works.
L:  I don't know how that works either.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you know, you see, this is the thing is that people can like rock'n'roll and like show tunes.  I love both.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, like, I -- I -- you know it's sort of like ... I can appreciate, you know, uh ... I can appreciate them -- I'm trying to think, like, uh, you know, a little bit of, um [LIPSMACK] ... um ... you know, Rogers and Hammerstein and a little bit of Sid Vicious.
R:  Right.
L:  It's all -- it's all -- it's all --
R:  What did Rogers and Hammerstein write?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um ... Oklahoma which apparently underwent --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- you know, there's -- there's like a new revival of Oklahoma.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, it was actually revived on the West End in London a couple of seasons ago and, um [LIPSMACK] it was -- that was supposed to be a really incredible production.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sort of, like -- there -- there's a lot of darkness in a lot of these, uh, Rogers and Hammerstein, uh, musicals actually.
R:  You know what?  I work in the, uh -- I work right around the theatre district and I walk past the theatre posters, the Broadway posters --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- every day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I -- I'm thinking when I see Oklahoma and some of the others, especially Our Town, somebody's doing Our Town right now, I'm thinking they should just keep a list of which plays have been performed at every high school in America and nobody's allowed to put them on Broadway anymore.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's my new theory.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, um --
R:  I saw Our Town go up -- I saw Our Town go up and I just thought, "You know, it's -- it's officially over now.  They don't need to do it on  Broadway any more.  Everyone's seen it in their local high school and that should do it".
L:  Yeah, but the ironic thing is from all the reviews that I've been seeing, like, uh, because there's so many of these Broadway productions that are star driven ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and the stars are generally like stars in another medium, primarily film --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and so ... um, the funny thing about this production of Our Town, I've been reading the reviews of it, is that ... Paul Newman's been getting pretty uniformly great reviews.
R:  He's in it?
L:  And then it's everybody else ...
R:  I didn't even know he was in it.
L:  -- in the production.  Paul Newman is the narrator in this production --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and he's been getting fantastic reviews and then there's other people -- it's -- it's not like the rest of the cast is a bunch of slops or anything, like Jane Curtain's another one of the members of the cast.  But the -- the -- I -- just uniformly they just say Newman is really great.  It's the first time he's been --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on -- back on a Broadway stage in decades, but they say he's just fantastic, and then the rest of the production is really, really flat and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's -- there's just way too much set preparation and -- for, you know, for our -- Our Town and, uh ... so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, yeah.
R:  Now, there's an example.  Paul Newman and -- and what's her name?
L:  Jane Curtain?
R:  No, not Jane Curtain.  The one he's married to.  He's been married to --
L:  Oh, Joanne Woodward?
R:  -- forever.
L:  Oh, Joanne Woodward.  Oh, well --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- did you ever hear about his remark about steak?  He got in big trouble for that.
R:  No, what?
L:  They -- they asked him, you know, whether or not basically he ever had any interest in, you know, other women or was, you know, ever was tempted to go outside of his marriage --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And he said, "Why would I when I [LIPSMACK] you know, have basically come home and have steak every night?" or something like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, and she -- she apparently -- and I mean, he meant this in -- in the best possible way, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, she kinda was like, you know, I am not a side of beef, thank you very much.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, he -- and -- and -- and I saw an interview --
