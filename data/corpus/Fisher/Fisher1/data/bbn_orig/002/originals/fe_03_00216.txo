R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  Uh, my name is Shona.
L:  Oh, my name's Brenda.
R:  Hi, Brenda.
L:  Nice to meet you, Shona.
R:  Uh, goodness, what do you look for in a life partner?
L:  [LAUGH] Um, [COUGH] excuse me.  I think the first thing for me that comes up --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is the ability to communicate together.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  Um, to be able to talk about things, 'cause differences come up from time to time and so some ability to be able to sort through things verbally at times is necessary.  And to negotiate differences together.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, that sounds like a good one.  Shoot, what am I gonna come up with now? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, hm.  [SIGH] I'd have to say that they care.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That they're -- they're trying in the relationship. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think as long as two people are serious about trying [LAUGH] --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- um, they can probably overcome just about anything else that's not going well. [LAUGH]
L:  I agree.  They have to be willing to work, both -- both people.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, once -- as long as you've got two people who are committed to working --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in the relationship, it should work.
R:  Yeah.  As soon as one of them makes it a conditional thing or a "if I like it" kind of thing or [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, they're waiting for it to just happen and work right, you know, without any effort, then you're both sunk. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  You're right. [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  So, I don't know.  It's -- I think it's a good question 'cause people seem to have a lot of trouble with that today.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Picking the right life partner.
R:  Yeah.  Um, [LAUGH] see, I have been married for almost eleven years.
L:  Is that right?
R:  Yep.  What about you?
L:  I am single right now, but I was married for almost eleven years before my marriage ended.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I have three children, but, um, I decided not to -- to remarry.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I've been single, oh, my goodness, maybe about fourteen years now.
R:  Wow, raising three by yourself is gotta be tough.
L:  You know, at times it was, but, um, my sons are -- are grown now, and my daughter's sixteen.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, it's just been a real pleasure.
R:  Oh, wonderful.  I've got three myself, and I can't imagine doing it solo. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's hard work. [LAUGH] I know that there -- people can married and raise a family together for a reason. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Makes things much simpler.
R:  Yeah, I -- I can only imagine. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] How old are your children?
R:  Um, eight and five and three, all boys.
L:  Oh, very young.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All boys?
R:  All boys.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yep, boy number three is snuggling into my lap right now.
L:  Wow. [LAUGH]
R:  With his blankie.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's neat.  What, uh, area of the c- country are you from?
R:  Illinois.
L:  Illinois.  I'm in Wisconsin.
R:  No way.  What part of Wisconsin?  Or should I --
L:  Milwaukee.
R:  Milwaukee?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  No way.  We used to live in Milwaukee.
L:  Did you really?
R:  We lived on, um, South Fifty Sixth Street.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  Right by West Dallas.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, I know where that is.  I'm in the River West area.
R:  Hm, okay.  We were only there a year, so I didn't get really good at knowing where anything was. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Okay.  Funny, I mean, so far I've talked with someone in Quebec and New York.  This is the closest. [LAUGH]
R:  [inaudible].
L:  All right.
R:  [SIGH] So, is there anything else to say about life partners? [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know, um ... [LAUGH]
R:  Having one's handy.
L:  Having one is definitely handy.  It's a good thing.  And, um, I don't know.  I think pr- probably what we said is what they're -- what needs to be said.  You have to have two people who are willing to work at it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If they're both invested, [LIPSMACK] they can negotiate their way through -- through the things that come up.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yes, we've recently worked out a -- an agreement where my husband takes care of all animals that are dead or should be.
L:  [LAUGH] Is that right?
R:  And I take care of breastfeeding.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  That's how I bullied him into taking care of all the dead mice and things like that.
L:  [LAUGH] Did you really?
R:  Yep.  "Hey, man, I breastfeed.  You take care of dead animals".
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's funny.
R:  What's he gonna say?  "Oh, I'll trade jobs with you"?
L:  No. [LAUGH] Like, I don't think so.
R:  "You're stuck, honey".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "Now, get that mouse out of here, please". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's important to have someone to do that, isn't it? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I could do it, but, you know, I don't want to. [LAUGH]
L:  No, me neither. [LAUGH] Certainly sounds like somebody else's job to me. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it works. [LAUGH] Oh, my little guy's gotta go over to the window.  He hears a motorcycle far off in the distance. [LAUGH]
L:  And how old was the little guy again? [inaudible]
R:  Three.
L:  Three years old.  Oh, so he's exploring, huh?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  He goes to preschool in the morning and he's supposed to take a nap, but he's not taking a nap. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He's trying to give it up, but I'm lobbying against it.
L:  Sometimes it's like that, really hard to get them to do what you need them to do. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, tell me about it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] They have another plan.
R:  Yeah.  All my kids have special needs, so they --
L:  Is that right?
R:  Yeah.  They are.  A handful.
L:  Mm.  And it is all the more important to have a partner in that.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I end up spending a lot of time taking care of all of their stuff, so it's handy that I'm able to be home with them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know how people not only do it being single but do it while being -- while working full time outside the home.  Oh, my. [LAUGH]
L:  It's a handful.  Um, [SIGH] at times when I was raising my children by myself, I was working two jobs and going to school.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  I -- I, um, actually even went all the way through graduate school with my kids.
R:  Wow.
L:  But, you know, it paid off.  To me it paid off in that, um, my sons are very goal oriented now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They've, um, you know, are busy pursuing their own goals and being successful at that and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's kept them out of trouble having focused on goals. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's good.
L:  So, there was a time when I was in graduate school when I -- when I worried for a moment, like, what if, you know, my being so busy all the time has a detrimental effect, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- before I started going to school, back to school myself, my -- my sons never did too well in school 'cause they always thought it was about social [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then once I started going to college and bringing home my work --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- boy, did that make a change in their lives.
R:  And how old were they?
L:  They were [MN] when I first started, uh, just, like, fifth and sixth grade.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And in junior high school my son, um, my oldest son, became an honor roll student and -- and an honor society [MN] member.
R:  Wow.
L:  I mean, he had a total turnaround and he is right now has just finished his bachelor's degree and is starting his master's degree, been promoted twice at his job.  Um, he is just on his way.  And then my other son started college --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Then after a year he got this job that has promoted him and promoted him and has now moved him to, uh, Florida --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- where he -- he's, uh, um, making more money than I -- than I do after going all through school. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  It's so funny. [LAUGH]
R:  What field?
L:  He's in -- uh, he's in sales.  He's head -- he's a territory manager.  Actually, I think they don't call them that any more.  Some kind of, um, account manager.  But basically what he does is his company sells supplies to these large companies like Bernards[?] and Ace[?].
R:  Yeah.
L:  And he just goes traveling around to his different accounts, you know, and -- and, um, taking 'em out to lunch or dinner and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and putting in a new order.  I mean, he travels and he has so much fun, it's just incredible to me.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  And he's really successful at it.  He -- he's so successful at it that he, uh, he recently wrote a letter to his employers telling them why he thought he should make thirteen thousand dollars more --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and they gave it to him.
R:  Wow.
L:  Because, I mean, his letter was just full of the evidence.  This is how much --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I made for you last year. I consistently exceed all your goals, yada yada yada.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He put the facts and the figures and they gave it to him.
R:  Wow.  That's neat.
L:  Yeah.  It's been kind of the fun side of parenting.  I -- I laugh with my sons and tell them I remember -- I can still remember just when they were in high school wondering what they would do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, what would they be when they grew up or what would they do?  And then, all of a sudden, I never had to wonder about it any more.  It's nice.
R:  Yeah.  I look at my little guys and I carry my three year old up the stairs to his nap and I tell 'em, "You know what?  Some day in probably, oh, fifteen years, you're gonna have hair all over your face just like dad".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And there's these soft little cheeks.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I look at all of 'em and say, "What are you gonna be when you grow up?"  My eight year old is a science junkie.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  He reads Discover magazine and, um, just all things science.
L:  Oh.
R:  And my five year old wanted to be a doctor who opens people up and fixes what's wrong inside.  I told him, "That's a surgeon, honey".  So --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- on TV they had a -- one of those, I don't know, Discovery Channel or the Learning Channel where they had a live surgery [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I showed him.  He looked at it for two seconds and says, "That's gross.  I'm not going to be a doctor who opens people up".
L:  [LAUGH] Changed his mind in a hurry, huh?
R:  Like, yeah, two seconds changed his career plans.
L:  That's funny. [LAUGH]
R:  That was pretty funny.  So, he's trying to figure out how he can be a doctor while he's still a kid.  I told him the outlook wasn't too good.
L:  [LAUGH] No.
R:  He said, "Well, maybe I could be an assistant".  "Hm, I don't know, sweetie".
L:  Not too much of a market for that, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] A five year old doctor's assistant.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  That would be funny.  Hm.
R:  Told him, "You only need to go to school for, what, twenty one years".  "Oh, okay". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "How can I do that now, though?" [LAUGH] "Sorry, honey, I don't think it's gonna work right now, but you can work at it". [LAUGH]
