R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, uh, I'm Aida.
L:  I'm Mike.
R:  Hi, um, where're you calling from?
L:  I'm in Boston.
R:  Okay, I'm, uh, in Washington, D.C.  Actually in Vienna, Virginia.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, okay, so, um, who's gonna start?  [LAUGH]
L:  Either way.  Uh, I -- I guess, I actually don't feel that my life has changed that much specifically.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, like, I'm a student and, uh, I've been in Boston for the past several years, um, I'm getting a masters right now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, since -- I mean, obviously right around the time, you know, a year ago or a year and a couple a months back the attacks occurred, um, you know, things sort of -- you know, everybody ... changed then and sort of, you know, was a little on guard and there were --
R:  Right.
L:  -- all that.  But I wasn't -- I'm not a really big traveler I guess, and, uh ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so .... I didn't have to make any adjustment sort of in that respect.  I remember there was one time there was a scare about, you know, maybe potential terrorism in Boston ... uh, you know, some people said, "Don't go downtown on this day because there might be an attack of some kind" ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, so ... but other than that, like, major changes [SIGH] made, like I -- I don't feel that I actually have so much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  How 'bout for you?
R:  Um ... I feel like, um ... I'm -- I've probably made more changes than I think.  I'm aware of -- of couple, uh, for sure.  Uh, I actually, um [LIPSMACK] was living ... right next to the Pentagon complex, uh, on September eleventh --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- and so I was able to -- to see, uh, the attack and the explosion and hear the plane fly over my building, so, um [LIPSMACK] I was pretty, um, traumatized I should say, um [LIPSMACK] from the whole experience and for me ... uh, this was, um ... this felt like a cont- continuation of stuff that I experienced in my home- home country.  I'm, um [LIPSMACK] originally from Bosnia.
L:  Okay.
R:  And so I basically came over to the United States, um, fleeing the war that was going on in -- in my country [LIPSMACK] and that was affecting me and my family to a large extend.  Um, so to me, I guess coming to the United States I felt like I was, um [LIPSMACK] you know, away from a lot of the trauma that I was experiencing at -- at home, and so, uh, to be, uh, a witness to, um, you know, to this attack was really ... you know, to me felt like a continuation of -- of a lot of things that I already experienced, and so, um ... [LIPSMACK] I couldn't really ... you know, ignore the fact [LAUGH] that it happened.  I mean, even if I hadn't had this ... you know, this experience at home, I'm sure that I would have had a pretty strong reaction and traumatic reaction to what I'd seen happening here.  Just, you know -- you know, from -- you know how -- you know how many people's lives were lost and what kinds of destruction I was able to ... to see right outside of my ... well, my home in the Un- in the United States.  So, um, I made, uh, a couple of ... adjustments right away which was basically I couldn't concentrate.  I'm also in school.  I'm a graduate student, and, um, and I found that I couldn't concentrate on any of my work right after the attack and so I moved out of the old apartment where I was living [LIPSMACK] and moved to the suburbs, um, of Washington D.C. [LIPSMACK] where I felt that, um, you know, I wasn't ... you know, near the airport.  That's much -- I didn't hear the planes.  My biggest issue then was that I was always hearing the planes for -- even the military planes or any other kinds of plane flying, you know, above my head and that just was really not helping me [LIPSMACK] you know, deal with what I -- you know, what I've experienced.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I think that was the major change that I consciously made, uh, you know, in order to be able to continue with my own work.  Um [LIPSMACK] in terms of my behavior, um, I might say that, um ... in -- in those first months I was probably more vigilant than now.  Uh, probably ... um ... [LIPSMACK] you know, again, it's hard for me to separate, you know, my experience at home and what happened here.  Like, how much of my behavior was basically just [SIGH] you know, implants by this earlier experience and whether --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I was just ... do you see what I mean?  Like, I cannot tell --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that I was responding just to September eleventh.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, and also, um ... lot's see, but in terms of like flying and so forth, I definitely flew from then on and, um ... and I wasn't -- I mean, I -- I might have thoughts ... you know, about, you know, possible accidents or, you know, hijacking or some -- something, but you know, I always was secure enough when I entered a plane that it doesn't even cross my mind that something like this could, you know, happen ... [LIPSMACK] again.
L:  Yeah, I guess ... uh, I actually -- I flew for the first time since, uh, a couple of months ago.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I -- I took a trip -- a road trip to California with a friend of mine --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I knew -- I got -- I only had a short amount of time to go so we drove out there and then I flew back a couple of days later.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I didn't, uh ... actually, I mean, I think that it seems that, you know, with all the precautions that have been taken, it seems like it's probably safer now to fly than it was before.  I mean, if not only because people are being ... much more watchful and much more strict about, you know, checking people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and letting people on planes with, you know, certain amounts of things and ... um, so I guess, that wasn't a big change, but one other thing that I remembered is I guess, uh, this isn't necessarily something that ... [MN] I actively felt like a change of what I've done, but I think in my attitude I guess, I just -- I never ... I've never been one to really closely follow, like, news and world events --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and political appearances, um, but this was definitely made it difficult to avoid doing that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, I feel that since [SIGH] that time, uh, I at least, uh -- I more keep up with, uh, with what is going on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  At least in that situation or in, like, you know, the war on terrorism that we have now --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- or, um ... so, it's just that -- it's sort of altered, you know, my mindset, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- basically like -- I actually got a job, um, an internship after, um -- which happened to be like in November last year ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, where some of the things that we were doing, um, involved reading, uh, news articles so that helped me keep up as well until I got much more involved just with what, uh, with what was going on and so again, it's not necessarily a direct result of -- of the attacks --
R:  Sure.
L:  But, uh, but indirectly ... um, obviously every, like [SIGH] anyone who found out, anybody who is, you know, anywhere near [MN] or knew anybody -- like, I have a lot of friends, uh, who -- I'm originally from New Jersey so I have a lot of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- friends in that area.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and I have like, you know, relatives and friends in New York city, um ... [LIPSMACK] and I guess -- I mean, obviously I'm not there now so they would probably be more affected than me, but even --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I guess the people that I know there, um, like my mother and my grandmother ... they, uh -- you know, nobody I know, um, was ... you know, was hurt or ...
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- worse.  Um, but -- and I -- I don't think anyone [SIGH] -- anyone that I know has really taken any ... extreme action, you know, to alter their lives --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think.
R:  Right.
L:  Everyone that I know is pretty much ... just going -- you know, going about their business like because on the level that we ... can do anything, you know, all we can do is, you know, I guess, you know move to a safer place --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- or, you know, somewhere that we think is more out of harm's way.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  But other than that, we're not, uh ... or, you know, flying less or doing -- you know, doing -- go --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- going places that we don't think -- Paris, I'm not gonna go or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or -- or target, but other than that, there's not a whole lot that we as, you know, common people I think, but can ultimately do other than, you know, be aware and alert and these are --
R:  Yeah, I -- I --
L:  -- and pay attention.
R:  -- totally agree with it.  I think, when you mentioned the point about, like, whether you watch the news more or less as opposed to before, I think that, you know, I've had, like two phases.  Like, right after the attacks I was constantly listening to the news and watching and, you know -- you know, trying to hear new information, but at this point, I'm actually the opposite.  Like, I tried to read as little as possible.  Um, I mean, I read, for example, the local ... you know, Washington Post and -- and whatnot and read the major news but, um, once you know, I realized that all these T.V. houses are make -- you know, basically ... [SIGH] all they're doing in many ways, you know, in their reports and in what kinds of, um, how should I say, fears they try to instigate in -- in you know, people.  And considering that I, you know, might be somebody who -- who can  be affected by, you know, that pretty easily, you know, then I decided that I'm not gonna [LAUGH] -- I'm not gonna listen to everything and I'm not gonna read anything [LAUGH] like I used to do before.  Um, and --
L:  Yeah, makes sense.
R:  -- reading The Post I feel that, okay, if there is something important that I need to find out, you know, I will -- I will read it and I [LAUGH] -- even from The Post.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that -- that makes a lot of sense.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You don't need to know everything.  Just the major points.
R:  Yeah, I -- it all depends on like what kind of reader you are and so forth, and I find that, um, sometimes, I guess because I wasn't even, um, brought up in this culture and so forth like, you know, I tend to trust, you know, the news and, you know, I just take it as a fast safe way that, you know, people will be ... you know, writing to the advantage of the readership but they usually don't.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  So, do you know, uh ... do they -- uh, this is my first one of these that I've -- that I've gotten to the -- I feel like we've been talking -- I've timed it for ten minutes, um ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  If it comes on and tells you to stop or ...
R:  Yes.  Um, I -- I did it yesterday and, um, the -- the program -- yeah, the -- the robot says, "You have, like thirty seconds and you should ... greet each other I mean say goodbye to each other" --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and, um, and then, I guess, um ... they ask you to give feedback, but yesterday didn't work in my case.
L:  Okay.
R:  I was on the line but it just got -- got disconnected so ...
L:  I see.
R:  -- hopefully the robot knows [LAUGH] will come up soon because I also don't know what else to say about September eleventh.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Um ... I guess, we've just, uh ... pretty much said most of, like, you know, keeping more, like -- at least I'm more aware of, you know, the major players in the -- you know, in this ongoing -- in the political system, like -- sort of, like, I guess I'd never really, you know, knew who Osama Bin Laden was or I didn't know much about the Taliban and ... what was going on in Afghanistan and everything.  Like, maybe you had more of a -- more insight because you -- when did you -- when did you come from there?
R:  I came in ninety four.  Um ... and so I've been -- I've been back to the region a couple of times, um, but I've been here all these years.
L:  I see.  So ... mm ... what are you studying in school?
R:  Um, I study, uh, linguistics and my area --
