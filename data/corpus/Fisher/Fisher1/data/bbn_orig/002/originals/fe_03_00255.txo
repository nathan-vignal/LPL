R: Hello? 
L:  Hi, this is Steve.
R:  This is Irene.
L:  Irene, hi.  Where are you located?
R:  I'm Florida.
L:  You're in Florida?  Okay, that's pretty different.  I'm up in Montana.
R:  Mont- oh, that must be cold?
L:  [LAUGH] Well, it's, um -- it's about freezing ... which, uh, seems pretty warm to, um [LIPSMACK] uh, to me at the moment but, uh, yeah it's, uh ... definitely colder than, uh, where you are.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Right.  Sure.
L:  Uh -- I was thinking that might have, uh ... you know, a bearing on what kind of, uh, impact, um ... you know, uh, people have felt from September eleventh.  You're -- at least over towards the east coast you're still far away from New York City.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know, um ...
R:  Have -- have you had any ...?
L:  Well, you know, we ...
R:  -- ill effects?
L:  -- um, I mean, I don't feel like I've made any changes in my life, um ...
R:  Yeah, I haven't either.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- really as a result of September eleventh.  Um, you know, at first it just, uh [LIPSMACK] seemed really far away and we were just ... kinda drawn to it, uh, paying attention in the news and so on --
R:  Yeah.  Who would attack Montana, right?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] well ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, you know there -- there are so many fewer people in our whole state than, you know, in New York City or something like that although of course we did notice that in terms of increased airport security --
R:  Mum.
L:  -- and things like that, and -- and actually we became aware that, um ... you know, I mean, obviously there are connections and things happened, like, um -- like, my company -- I work at a software company -- started ... you know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- receiving fewer orders and so on and other companies, um, you know, there was the whole downturn in the economy which, um, was connected with that, you know ... I don't think you could say that September eleventh caused that but it definitely had an economic impact that was felt here.
R:  Right.
L:  Um ... that must be true there too.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I have to say, I haven't done anything really differently.  I was actually quite annoyed with all the ... all the media stuff ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Even -- even like this ... this last, um, September I thought this was re- 'cause I wasn't in --
L:  The anniversary?
R:  -- the country when it happened and ...
L:  So, where were you?
R:  I was in Germany.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I was there for eight months.  I was studying and stuff so ... it -- it really ... I didn't really know what was going on.  I didn't pay attention to the news too much [LAUGH] 'cause everything was in German and my German was so bad so ...
L:  Yeah, weren't people like, uh, constantly asking you ... um, you know, people who knew you were an American there ...
R:  Actually, I'm not an American.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh!  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm from Finland.
L:  May I ask what -- oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, so ... but I mean --
L:  So, right.
R:  -- the actual people that still -- 'cause I've lived in America for so long now so ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- people that kind -- I mean, they didn't really ask me 'cause people usually know I -- I'm not from her originally so ...
L:  Mhm, are you a graduate student there in Florida or ...?
R:  I'm an undergraduate student.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, studying something in -- linguistics related or ...?
R:  No, actually my mom [LAUGH] is a --
L:  Put you on to this?
R:  -- linguistics professor.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And --
L:  Um, yeah, well, that's interesting.  I mean, one thing that I did do, um, starting from September eleventh, I mean, I'd actually done this before then, but I really started paying attention to how things were reported in the international media, not just in the U.S. media --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and there's so many different perspective ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, that you would have, um, from ... reporting in Europe than ... [MN] you know, we Americans had a [LAUGH] -- a big tendency to overdramatize it and ...
R:  Yeah, I mean, nothing's really happened in America, like ... of this dimension --
L:  No, that's --
R:  -- and so ...
L:  Yeah, that's really true although --
R:  -- it was quite a shock.
L:  -- on the other hand, there are others -- things like the fact that, you know, um ... you know, ten or twenty times as many people die annually in car accidents or, uh, you know that sort of thing so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, that provides a certain kind of perspective but that's obviously a very different, um ... sort of event.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, one of the interesting things on this topic that, um [LIPSMACK] that I guess I heard on the radio recently but, um, somebody was analyzing what was, uh, said and reported in the media, um, and what people were saying after September eleventh and just about everybody ... um, sort of drew a lesson from ... you know, the fact that the U.S. had been attacked and, uh, -- uh, and the nature of attack and -- and where it, uh, seemed to have come from, you know, even before we had um, better evidence and -- and everybody, um, had their own interpretation and these could be completely different, you know ... even opposite interpretations, you know, like, this proves that, uh, the Islamic world will never be able to, um ... you know, to, uh, sort of ... uh [COUGH] get along with, um -- with western countries or whatever.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And other people would say that, uh, you know, this is proof that, um, the Islamic world is just, you know, struggling to integrate itself into, uh -- uh, you know, the ... international scene or whatever.  I mean, everybody took their own ... uh, view and took September eleventh as proof that they were right.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Basically.
R:  I mean, I -- I have kind of a hard time understanding that this is, like, a religious, um ... out of religious reasons [MN] people did this.  I mean, I -- I immediately think that because they don't want western ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- western forces to, you know [LAUGH] take all their stuff to their countries and say, "Here, buy this".
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I mean -- and I can understand that, that people don't want this commercialism.
L:  Sure, absolutely.  Yeah.
R:  And I -- I mean -- it's kinda people ... often ... wonder why people would attack America, but I -- I think there's pretty much a concrete reason.
L:  I -- I find that so easy to believe.  I mean, the -- in retrospect, it's -- you know, the amazing thing is that nothing ... of this nature happened earlier.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ... [LIPSMACK] you know, and in fact we had had, um, you might not have been aware, not being here, but, um, you know, we had some -- some significant terrorist attacks before the -- um, actually --
R:  Right.
L:  -- turned out to be by Americans.  There's Oklahoma City bombing.
R:  Right.  Yeah, I remember this, yeah.
L:  I don't know if you know about that.  Were you in the U.S. at that time or ...?
R:  Yeah, I was -- I was quite young though.  I remember [LAUGH] not much of it.
L:  Uh-huh, right. 
R:  So ...
L:  Well, I remember ... um, when that first happened, um, you know, like the immediate reaction was, "This is probably some foreign terrorist ... um, action".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, of course, it turned out to be ... um, as far as we know, this ... um ... [LIPSMACK] American ...
R:  Yeah, and also --
L:  -- person.
R:  -- with -- I -- I guess ... well, I don't know if this is terrorism or not, but with what happened in Wacko --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it's kinda religious ... thing.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Well, that's another ... uh, interesting aspect of it.  I mean, I think where religion comes in is not ... not the sense -- um, you know, that it's not a directly religious ... conflict --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but people's religion, um, colors the way they perceive ...
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, other social or economic, um ...
R:  Exactly, yeah.
L:  -- [MN] things and so ... you know, we have, um, a lot of fundamentalist groups in the U.S. as well, that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in some ways are, you know, just as closed minded, just as capable of ... you know, of taking actions -- you know, I don't wanna say that we have groups that would go out and bomb somewhere, but -- but would wholeheartedly support, you know, military actions that would --
R:  Close to that.
L:  -- have similar effects.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um, so religion does come into it in that sense.  I mean, I don't ...
R:  Yeah, people get really intense when ... I guess when religion is taken into it.  Or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- from when they -- when they look from ... from -- look at things from a religious perspective.
L:  Yeah.  That sounds like, uh -- that you don't?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] No, I don't really.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't really have too much of any religion so ...
L:  Well, I guess I'm in a similar situation, but, uh, yeah, for some people that's very close to their ... personal ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, world view and -- and view of themselves --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so ... it's all kinda tied up in ...
R:  Yeah, so ... you're in, um -- did you say software?
L:  Yeah, I am so I'm doing some ... uh, software related to linguistic type processing and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so that's how I got connected with this, um ... this study.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and I'd be happy to, um, talk about that a little bit but I guess you're not in that field yourself then?
R:  Mm, no [LAUGH] not really.
L:  What -- what are you studying?
R:  Um, I'm just -- I'm actually doing my associates degree right now and I'm planning on transferring to the University of Florida and I'm so- um, sociology is my major, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, it's sort of -- but my --
L:  So, this topic is closer to your ... um ...
R:  Mm, yeah, more or less.  [LAUGH]  Um, my mom is ... um, she does, uh, research in bilingualism.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, she's always kind of ... I mean, well, I've alw- I have always been around linguistics --
L:  I see.
R:  -- most of my life so ...
L:  How -- how much of your life have you lived in the U.S. then?
R:  I've been here thirteen years.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm twenty.
L:  Okay, so ... you must be at least bilingual?  Probably three or four or five ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- languages?
R:  I -- I fully speak English and Finnish.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I speak some German.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ...
L:  Was -- was that a sociology program that you were in Germany for?
R:  No.  I was actually at this, uh, Shore International University and I was ... then I was majoring in [LAUGH] international relations actually.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, and I did, like a German language course.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ... but I would like to go back there one day and try to learn more German.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you'll probably have a chance some time.  Actually, there's, um, some of the software I'm working, um, with or trying to develop, uh, is something --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I've, um, looked into applying in different areas which ... uh, not exactly sociology at this point, although, um, I'm on a mailing list with a lot of other ... um, people who are doing sociology and it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, they're using a technique called content analysis to try and, um, basically study people's perceptions as -- as expressed in ... you know, for example, the media or in whatever kind of, um, materials they might have, you know, typically written materials, um.  Uh, but eventually it could be speech too, you know, for ... uh, if you have good enough speech analysis but, um, basically going through, uh, massive amounts of text and trying to categorize ... um ... uh, those texts into, um ... you know, in some way that could be related to the -- the kind of words people use or the kind of, um --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, presence of certain kind of key words.  Either, you know, uh, emotional words of some kind or relate into certain issues or whatever, and so, um, a lot of people are using techniques like that to try and study, um, sociology issues and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ...
R:  It's -- I mean, I ... I can see where that would [LAUGH] ... have a great impact.
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH] So ... what else?  I suppose we should say a few more words about September eleventh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um ...
R:  Mm.
L:  -- while we're still being recorded here.
R:  [LAUGH] I think this is gonna be one of those, um, things that people will later on ask, like, "What were you doing --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- when you heard about this?"  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right.  Are you in an office where you have, uh, someone else listening to you talk and ... [LAUGH] they're wondering what the heck you're talking about?
R:  [LAUGH] Mm.
L:  Right.  Huh.
R:  So ... [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I think, um ... [LIPSMACK] you know it -- it -- there's -- there's been an interesting, uh, you know, sociological phenomenon really in -- just within the U.S. too.  I mean, I think there's kind of a -- a backlash of certain people in a -- in a way in that, uh, there was so much ... attention paid, um ... you know, immediately after the event and ... uh, and a lot of the results of that have kind of faded, um ... [SIGH] you know, within the last year.  I think ... you know, it's still something that's still ... very much a part of our consciousness but it seems like most people who weren't directly connected, you know, um ... you know, by living in New York or maybe by --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- having, um ... [LIPSMACK] you know, some, uh, relative lost or something like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's pretty much gone --
