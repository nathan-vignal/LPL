L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, um, I'm Laura.
L:  Hi, Laura.  I'm Shona.
R:  Hi, how're you doing?
L:  I'm doing okay.  We're gonna see if we can make this work.  I've got kids roaming around.  I told 'em they need to go play.  We'll see if it works.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Okay.  Hang -- hang -- hang on just one sec, I'm sorry.  [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Okay, I'm sorry.  Wh- so, what were we saying before?
L:  Oh, I've got kids roaming around, so I -- I'll see if I can make this work.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH] All right, uh ... you wanna start?
L:  Um, sure.  Let's see [SIGH], um, I have to say that not a lot in my life has changed ... um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- post September eleventh.
R:  [LAUGH] Um, right.
L:  Oh, not much in my life has changed, post September eleventh.
R:  Not at all?
L:  Um, I'm trying to think of anything.  Uh, I haven't flown in ten years anyway so --
R:  Mm.
L:  That's not an -- and I have [LAUGH] no prospect of flying in the near future, so that wasn't an issue.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, I live in central Illinois so it's -- and, uh ... more or less in the sticks, so it's not like I was worried about ... big buildings.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ... I've always kinda ... tried to live my life ... in a way that if I died tomorrow I wouldn't really have any regrets so it didn't change my life that way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um [SIGH] ... I don't have ... [MN] uh, problems with ethnic issues so it's not like I ... suddenly became terrified of ... all Arabic looking people around here.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um [MN] they're fine with me.  Um, I'd have to say it really hasn't changed ... me much.  Um ... I mean, I've followed the events and I've felt for the people who were involved but it didn't change my life.
R:  Mm.  Yeah, I kinda felt the same way actually.  Like, I don't know, it didn't -- it didn't really affect me that much.  I remem- yeah, I remember being kind of surprised that but that was like about it ... you know?  Like, I -- I -- I mean, I can't -- I can't imagine like anybody made any, like, day to day changes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in my -- in my life.  I'm -- I'm a college student so I probably hear about it -- I probably hear about it a lot more because I'm on college campus ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and you know, like there's sort of like that like political kind of atmosphere, you know? 
L:  Sure.
R:  [MN] But, um [LIPSMACK] aside from that, like ... no, it didn't really affect me any way ... odd- oddly enough.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, um, and I -- I don't really -- I don't travel that much either.  [LAUGH] I haven't left the country either probably in about time in about ten years since I've flown as well so ... um, the security issues didn't really -- didn't really affect me at all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Maybe I was a little nervous.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] It was kind -- kind of unnerving but aside from that, no.  I -- really it didn't, um ... mm, it didn't really have any -- any impact, you know?  [LIPSMACK] Um ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I feel almost unpatriotic for us but ... [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's the thing.  I -- I ... to me, like, I didn't feel so much like -- like that -- that didn't bother you -- bother you so much.  It was the fact that like ... I felt ... maybe I ... should be doing something different.  I don't know.  Not -- not -- not in terms of like for my country but just, um ... [LIPSMACK] I don't know because obviously something like -- something that's going wrong with the world, you know, like something's messed up and so I feel --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like maybe at least some help, but I don't know.  It feels like -- like ... I don't know, the wheels are in motion like a -- like a -- kind of a [inaudible] process so I can't really control, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.  I mean ...
R:  I'm sorry, just -- I'm sorry, just a second.  [PAUSE] Okay, I'm sorry.  What -- what were you gonna say?
L:  Oh ... um, I mean, it's occurred to me that ... in some way I ought to be doing something to promote peace.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm not sure how an at home mom in the 'burbs, um ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- uh, in Puria[?], Illinois, does that beyond ... uh ... being a basically good citizen and being a ... an as a -- I want to make that a good neighbor but, um ... [NOISE] um ... just --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] work and play well with others, you know?  Whoever I meet, regardless of ... um ... of what group they might or might not represent -- [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  But that's a pretty weenie kinda thing to do.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's not gonna do much on the face of things.
R:  Yeah, but I mean, like -- I thi- I don't know.  I think ... I don't know, I think if you can't like -- if you can't, you know, get along with the people just you see -- meet every day, I could understand how -- you know, we're -- it's supposed to work [inaudible] a little so I don't know.  I think that's -- if I needed to have the [inaudible] what else are we really supposed to do I mean?  We can't go on a personal peace mission to Iraq or something like that, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, yeah, I don't know.  That -- that makes sense to me.  Yeah, I think that's -- I mean, it's the most important thing really, you know?  [LIPSMACK] Um ... I'm trying to think of ... like what else? 
L:  Um ...
R:  Maybe we should talk about -- [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, it's occurred to me sometimes that maybe ... somebody needs to organize ... not exactly a petition but just like a -- a letter from the people of America to the people of Iraq saying basically, "Our governments might have a -- a problem with each other, but we don't have a problem with you".
R:  Yeah.  I -- I wished like -- I wished there was some simple way of doing that, you know.  It's occurred to me too.  But it's -- ah, it seems like really easy but it's really not like an easy thing to do ... at all.  And I mean, it's so much harder to communicate like that than -- than you would hope.  It's actually the hardest thing in the world to do.  And -- and the thing is, like, [inaudible] I don't know, the wheels set in motion [LIPSMACK] of war, whatever, there's nothing much you can do about it, you know?  Have you -- have you like ... a -- I don't know how you feel about like what's going on with Iraq, like ...
L:  Man, I don't know what to think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ... I mean the ... [SIGH] the world would be much better as far as I can tell if Saddam wasn't in it ...
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, I don't know what the best course of action there is though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have a problem with the idea of thinking that we can just around murdering people --
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  [NOISE] -- because we don't think that they're nice.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Um, you know -- oh, my three year old's barking.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Handy.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, [MN] uh, 'cause what gives us the right.  Why -- why shouldn't other companies -- or other countries decide that ... [SIGH] you know, maybe -- maybe Bush isn't good for the world and take off and murder him ... you know?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Who do we think we are?
R:  Exactly, yeah.
L:  Um, but ... I wouldn't be upset if he up and died.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I'm sure that there's millions of millions of -- maybe billions of people who would agree.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mm, Bush?
L:  Pardon me?
R:  Are -- are you talking about [inaudible] Bush?
L:  Oh, no, I'm talking about Hussein.
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH] [inaudible].
L:  No, um ...
R:  Yeah, yeah, person -- a lot of the Iraqi people too.
L:  Um ... I don't -- I don't know what the best course of action is but I do know it's a bad situation.
R:  Yeah, it really is.  Um [LIPSMACK] I don't know [LIPSMACK].  I -- I mean, I kinda disagree with what's going on.  I don't -- I don't really feel like ... I mean I -- I don't feel that this is the best course of action at all, you know.  I mean --
L:  Now, which part of it?
R:  The -- uh, invading Iraq.  [SIGH] Ah --
L:  Have we done anything to invade them so far?
R:  Um, no, not thus far.  No, I don't know -- no, I'm not talking about like the arms inspections.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm talking about like the -- like the plan said to, you know, inv- um, involve ourselves, you know, with military if, um, if the arms inspections don't go well or according to how we want them to go, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, the -- you know, I don't think we've done anything invasive yet but, um -- but yeah, but I -- I don't really feel comfortable with the idea of -- of going in with some sort of military action, you know.  So, I -- I guess -- I guess in that way, like, maybe ... September eleventh had maybe paid more attention to, um, dealing with that.  Like -- like with how we treat the Middle East and ... how -- how we interact with the Middle East, you know, where -- where foreign policy is there.  I think -- I think it definitely made me more aware of that sort of thing so I guess that's -- I guess it's one change.  [inaudible] changes have been, like a lot more, like, subconscious and like really a lot more subtle than, like ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know, building a bomb shelter in my backyard or something, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ... [LIPSMACK]
L:  Well, okay, you're right.  That does bring to mind -- I have started to pay more attention to, um, the attitudes of the rest of the world toward --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- America ... which I never really --
R:  I think a lot of people --
L:  -- gave much thought 'cause they're there --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I'm here and I can't change that so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I -- I think -- I think a lot of Americans did, yeah, 'cause it was kind of -- I mean I think we're kinda isolated.  It seems like ... it seems like in Europe there's a lot more, like, [inaudible] change of ideas and -- and things like that about what's going on with the rest of the world.  You know, there's more infiltration of news from -- from other parts of the world.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then you get really isolated because you know, I mean -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm here in Ohio.  You know, I'm living in the mid west --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [inaudible] I don't know.  I -- I think I feel like living like -- even if you are living like a major -- major apartment center like New York or something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think -- I think you just feel -- I don't know, you don't feel [several inaudible words] like the world ever touches you.
L:  Oh, I've got a relevant joke for you.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, what do you call someone who speaks three languages?
R:  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Trilingual.  What do you all someone who speaks two languages?
R:  I don't know.  Oh --
L:  Bilingual.
R:  -- bilingual, okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  What do you call someone who speaks only one language?
R:  An American?
L:  American.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I told that one to one of my neighbors, um, the other day and she's from India and she speaks like five languages.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  She thought that was funny.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, yeah, I see exactly what you're saying.
R:  Yeah, yeah, it's -- yeah, that's exactly what we're talking about, yeah, exactly.  That's funny.  [LAUGH] Um, how -- how long are we supposed to talk?  Do you know how long we're supposed to talk?
L:  Ten minutes.
R:  Oh, ten minutes?
L:  We're supposed to talk.
R:  Oh, okay.  I -- see, I couldn't remember really. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] Um [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  Is there anything else, like ...?
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- we're supposed to put into our conversation?
L:  Well, let me see, world affairs.  Yeah, my -- my mom and dad and my sister just came back from visiting Europe.  They went to England and, um ... uh, Slovenia --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they brought back different languages of newspapers for my kids.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I was surprised because they brought back, um, Chinese and Arabic.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Um, so they must be -- I mean, maybe it's just that they were in major cities but they must be more tuned in to ... [LAUGH] the rest of the world because ... um, I sure wasn't expecting to see those.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I can -- I can imagine that.  I mean, I don't know.  It seems like ... [SIGH] on the continent, maybe they, I don't know, are sort of more [inaudible] to those sorts of things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Maybe I -- I don't -- I mean, it seems really strange though 'cause we have -- we have like [inaudible] populations from --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [inaudible] countries but I -- I really -- I really feel -- I really feel like, um [MN] like, you know, newspapers are -- uh, uh, kind of print media, you know, from responsible.  I think -- I think it would in New York or -- or places like that.  It's possibly because they're like in larger cities, you know.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  But here if -- I think -- it seems like if you're not, like, on either coast or something, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if you're in -- in the middle [LAUGH] it's like ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know it's kind of the big wasteland.  I mean, I like the mid west, I like it here, but it's like, I don't know ... you feel -- you feel like you're on an island.  I've -- like, you don't feel like you're being touched very much by things that go on the outside world, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Yeah, I especially felt that -- I mean, I grew up in a -- um, a rural area --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, really in the sticks.  Um ... [MN] and I have brown hair and I was considered the different dark one.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, 'cause everybody was blonde, blue eyed Germans.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, you know, just going to a [inaudible] university and then living in Milwaukee and Puria, I've met lots of different people with lots of different viewpoints and ethnicities and ... races and ... um, that's been a big change.  And then I think how much different it would be if you lived in, say, New York.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, like, wow!  Boy, how isolated am I?  [LAUGH]
