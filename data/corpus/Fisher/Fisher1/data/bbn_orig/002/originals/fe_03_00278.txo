R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um, my name's Dave Pallet.  I work at Newst[?] in Gattersberg[?], Maryland.  Who are you?
L:  Uh, my name is Jennifer.
R:  Huh?
L:  I work actually at the University of Pennsylvania where this study's being done. 
R:  Well, how about that.
L:  So, how --
R:  It's a small world.
L:   -- how'd you find out about the study?  Where are they recruiting?
R:  Oh, I'm in the ... in the club.
L:  You're in the club?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, NIST had a role in, uh, the ears program for which this data's being collected.
L:  Do you to what purpose this data is being used?  People have asked me about that because I've been telling my friends to enroll for the study.
R:  Yeah, it's being used to develop models for conversational speech recognition. 
L:  That's what I thought and so, you know, they -- they're wanting samples where, for example, we talk over each other, correct?
R:  Well, not necessarily.
L:  I mean, and -- and -- and -- no, but I mean, uh, to see if like a conversational sort of speech recognition software would be able to handle those sort of real life events, correct?
R:  Well, I think one of the other things that's interesting is, uh, the -- the study of disfluencies.  You notice I stuttered a little bit there an- and that will be --
L:  Oh, right, right.
R:  -- that'll be annotated [LAUGH] by your colleagues.
L:  Oh.
R:  Anyway --
L:  So --
R:  -- airport security.
L:  Well, listen, I'm not -- no, they're not actually my colleagues.  I mean, I work at the University but I don't have anything to do with the linguistic data [inaudible].
R:  Oh.  Well, they collect data and transcribe it and annotate it, and distribute it to, um, linguistic data consortium members.
L:  I see.  There's actually a person transcribing all of this?
R:  Oh, my, there's a -- a covey of them.
L:  I would imagine it would take covey, goodn- --
R:  Yeah, 'cause --
L:  'Cause this would take a coven.  It would take, like, you know, Samantha --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- twinkling her nose --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and saying, "Okay, [inaudible] transcribe now.  Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah" you know?
R:  Yeah.  Airport security.
L:  Airport security.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Yeah, I --
L:  I don't know.  I'm due to fly in a week.  How 'bout you?
R:  Uh, I'm not gonna fly, uh, I guess for another month or so.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I'll tell you, I was in Europe at the time of, uh, nine eleven --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and, uh, was visiting relatives in Norway ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh [SIGH] --
L:  Wofta[?].
R:  Sorry?
L:  Wofta.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, lofta ... uh, oofta[?].  I was, uh, out seeing some, I don't know, historic stuff and we came back to the farm where my relatives live and somebody came out and said, "Have you heard about the -- the airport crash or the ... you know, air crash into the --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- World Trade Center?" and I said, "No" and they said, "Well, it's happened" you know, and described it briefly.  And I said, "Oh, I really miss not being able to see CNN" because my hosts didn't have CNN.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he said, "Well, we have it" [LAUGH].  He was in an adjoining farm ... and so I spent about two days, maybe three days, watching CNN and just --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- being, uh, appalled and astonished.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And then I tried to get back to the States.
L:  Oh.
R:  It was, um ... it was, uh, an adventure.  I went from Oslo to -- to, uh ... Copenhagen --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, which I'd been scheduled to do.  Uh, I did it a couple of days later than had been scheduled, and then when I got to Copenhagen, they said, "Well, we n- we're not sure we can get you back to the United States, but we can probably get you as far as London". 
L:  Mhm
R:  [LAUGH] So, I went to London and, uh ... uh, I missed my connection.  I --
L:  Aye.
R:  I was told, uh ... that was at Heathrow.  I was told that they could, uh, get me on a flight back to the States in a week.  No sooner than a week.
L:  Wow, and so you were stuck in London for a week?
R:  Yes, what a hardship.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Actually, I called my office and explained the circumstance and they said, "Well, uh, don't worry about the expense or anything, uh, just get back safely".
L:  Wow.
R:  And, uh, so, ah, the -- I went to a hotel that the ... uh, airline had sent me to, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as it turns out, I got the airline's rate which was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think forty nine pounds, uh --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- which is less than a hundred dollars a night.
L:  Right.  That's very cheap for London.  I was just there this summer, no.
R:  Yeah.  So, I had a nice -- a nice visit in London.
L:  And, uh, yeah, all things considered, right?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I think the -- the -- thinking about the issues though, I think the probability of, um ... there being, uh, an air ... problem that any one is personally involved with, is -- is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- not much greater than it was before.
L:  Sure.
R:  Maybe a little less because of all the heightened security. 
L:  Yeah, I think the heightened security, a lot of it is, you know, show and no go.  I mean, it's really -- they still haven't started xraying all luggage for example.
R:  Oh.
L:  I mean, um, yeah.  They -- they -- they -- they don't xray all checked luggage yet.  They still don't.
R:  Well, I tell you they did when I came back from London.
L:  So ... yeah, um --
R:  Uh ...
L:  -- but you know, they -- I mean, a sort of domestic air flights now, just -- they don't.
R:  Oh.
L:  They don't.  They -- they're -- they're -- they're not equipped to do this and, um [SIGH] and it's -- it's not -- I -- I read a great quote in The New York Times yesterday morning because apparently someone in [LIPSMACK] uh, had placed little boxes throughout the Union Square [inaudible] station, um.  They were tiny black boxes with the words beer inscribed on them, and they were -- there were -- there were several of them, there were probably about a dozen of them and they were just placed in locations throughout the Union Square subway station, and they were affixed on walls, and kind of up in corners and stuff like that.  And so, finally someone pointed out to the transit authorities these were there and -- and to the police and then they went in and they evacuated the station and everything.  And there was a comment from someone who was a graduate student in New York who was from Israel and he basically said something to the effect of, you know ... you people have an awful lot to learn.  Like, if this had happened in Tel Aviv, ah, we would have had a robot go in there and take care of it in five minutes.  Either it would have detonated it or, you know, found out it was nothing and gotten it outta there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The robot would have done it, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know if they would have done it in five minutes though.  The -- the problem is, uh, one of scale.  Um, if -- if you attack many ... you know, places at once, ah ... gee whiz.  Uh, one of them might go off.
L:  Yeah.  Well, you know, when I was in London ... um ... I remember actually going to Westminster Abbey and, uh ... having, uh, had a sandwich I was trying to look for some place to dispose of a sandwich wrapper --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and I couldn't find any.  There was none in Westminster Station, I looked around, and then I looked around in the ... all the street corners surrounding the station and when I got up above ground there were none, and ...
R:  Oh, that's right.
L:  -- I walked over past the Houses of Parliament and there were no [LAUGH] ... and then I finally walked into Westminster Abbey and I walked to the information desk and I said, "I'm really sorry but, uh, is there some place I could find a trash can?" and they promptly informed me that ... uh, there was one rubbish -- rubbish bin outside the door but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, if -- but that if -- but that -- 'cause I said, "Honestly, I really have been trying, uh, to look for about twenty minutes for some place to, uh -- discard this and I haven't been able to find any".  "Oh, no, there are no rubbish bins in the station" and then they said --
R:  Well, I had that in London.
L:  -- "It's a perfect place to place an IRA bomb".
R:  Yeah, it's an IRA thing.
L:  Oh, totally.
R:  Their -- their ... their security is heightened by the Irish terrorism.
L:  Right.  Oh, well, their se- you know, our security just is laughable compared to theirs, you know?  And they still have bombs going off so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, I mean, if somebody really wanted to do it, and what American's don't understand [LAUGH] I think, is that, uh ... okay, you make it more difficult but ... it's sort of like, these sorts of ... uh ... plans take a lot of patience and also a lot of persistence and, sort of like, "Okay, well now ... you know, you're just gonna have to be more careful to do something like this" but if -- if -- if we're not actually screening all the luggage, okay.  As you say, just send in, you know, eighteen in- incendiary devices in the luggage and if, oh, five of them happened to be caught by random ... thirteen of 'em still go off.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just, yeah, no, I don't particularly think of airport security as all that great, you know.  On the other hand, it's sort of like, what really are the odds ... of, uh, you know, you're buying it and you get in a vehicle off the lot, it's a lot greater if you get into a car than if you get in a plane.  That's still statistically true.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ... I mean, i- it remains, you know, quite statistically true so ... um, [MN] no, but I don't think airport security's really terribly good, um ... still and, uh, I think that, um ... think it's just people being inconvenienced now but, uh ... I -- I'm not really sure ...
R:  Well, I think what's desirable is --
L:  -- how much better security is.
R:  -- to have ... some security measures that do provide some deterrent and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and yet that people will accept.
L:  Right but --
R:  And we're just ridiculously ... uh, free and open about travel and --
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know, I was at, um ... McDonald's yesterday morning f- to get some breakfast stuff.  I don't normally --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- do that, but ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we didn't have electric power in our house so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, uh, there's a woman ahead of me in line with two children, uh ...
L:  Mhm
R:  -- that was ordering her breakfast, and it came to ten dollars and fifty six cents if I remember.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, she looked at the money she had and she had said, "I only have nine dollars".
L:  Mhm.
R:  A- and, uh, the man, uh, ahead of me ... just reached in his wallet and han- handed her two dollars.
L:  Mhm.
R: We're just, I mean, a generous society.
L:  Yeah, we're an open society, basically.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um ... and the paradox that people don't understand is that we're an open society within our -- with our -- within our own borders, but that part of the reason, I think, why this has been happening is because ... um, the way that things happen here ... is not the way that America handles our affairs in -- on the world stage.  I mean, America is known in many corners of the world as being incredibly, uh ... repressive and -- and incredibly brutal.  Um, and we do that in the name of preserving that kind of openness --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- within our own shores.  But we don't know what it looks like to other people.  We -- we -- we don't see that, um, and -- and it's -- when you start to live and travel abroad, uh, I think you get a much better sense of that, and that's the only America that a lot of -- that the -- that most people in the world know, most people who are not us.
R:  Mhm
L:  Um, and, uh, it's -- it's this enormous paradox that we're willing to go to very extreme lengths of -- of, um, our -- our government certainly --
R:  You were born in the United States?
L:  I was.  I was.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, ah --
R:  And you've traveled abroad though?
L:  Yeah, and I've lived abroad as well, but our government is -- is willing to go to, um, enormous, uh, lengths in defensive, um, [LIPSMACK] what we decide are American interests, um, abroad. 
R:  How would you feel about going to a third world country, like --
L:  I did live in a third world country.
R:  -- uh, one of the African states?
L:  No, not one of the African states.
R:  Asian?
L:  In Asia, yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, uh, you know, and -- and so it's -- it's very hard for us to understand, I think, a lot how -- what this -- what this looks like to other people.  You know, [LIPSMACK] when you explain to American's, like, remember the popular kid in high school, you know?  [LAUGH] Remember the popular kids who seemed to have it all going on and, you know, seemed to always get what they wanted and --
