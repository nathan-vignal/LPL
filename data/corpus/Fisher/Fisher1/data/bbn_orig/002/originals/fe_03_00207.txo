R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Elena.
L:  I'm Virginia.
R:  Virginia?  Hi, nice to talk to you.
L:  Hi, nice to talk to you. [SIGH] Ah ...
R:  What is -- so, what is your favorite holiday?
L:  Um, probably now, Christmastime.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I really love Christmastime.  I just finished finals and, um, I got back to my parents' house yesterday and I was helping decorate the tree tonight and I put all the lights on.
R:  Oh.
L:  Dug through the attic for all the decorations and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just making the house look all pretty.  And then my three year old niece comes over and her eyes just light up when she sees Christmas and I think that's why it's my favorite holiday, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause it's -- it's just pretty and [SIGH] I don't know.
R:  Oh, yeah, that's nice.
L:  Nice time of year.  Nice to be home.  Nice to see family, you know, so ...
R:  Mm.
L:  What's your favorite holiday?
R:  Oh, it was -- it's always been Christmastime and lately, um, well, I grew up in New England so Christmas sort of comes naturally to -- with the snow and, you know, the environment --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there.
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, I live in a desert now so it -- it -- it seems strange.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It does- -- it seems contrived. [LAUGH] Um, but lately more and more my favorite holiday has been Thanksgiving, which I was always bored with when I was young, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, it didn't excite me and, you know, it wasn't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- necessarily anything [SIGH] very special.  But now I -- I look forward to it so much now that I'm cooking my own meals and --
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, you mean -- oh, I thought you meant Thanksgiving meals.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I -- I -- I do 'cause I -- I don't --
L:  Oh, you do cook Thanksgiving, okay.
R:  Yeah, I don't live near my family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I usually get together with a group of good friends and, um, and we all contribute something, but I -- I appreciate it a lot more when I see what's going into it and maintaining little details that I never thought of as much tradition, you know, just having cranberries or having, you know, pecan pie makes such a big difference when [MN] -- when you're trying to put something together and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's just -- it's a -- it's a low pressure holiday.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because it's only revolving around just sitting around and eating and relaxing and --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  There isn't too much preparation put into it.  It's two free days of vacation and it's great.
L:  Right, right, right, right, yeah.  Good point.
R:  But, I mean, I didn't used to appreciate it as much as -- as I do now --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that I live away from my family.  And I still do love all of the -- everything that goes into preparing Christmas, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I started appreciating -- I still have a Thanksgiving screensaver on my computer. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah. [SIGH] I haven't had Thanksgiving for -- since ninety eight I think was my last Thanksgiving until this year.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I forgot how much I love Thanksgiving as well.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I have lived in Europe for a couple of years and, um, last year we had, like, [MN] a typical Dutch dinner for Thanksgiving dinner.  I was living with Americans and we're like, "We have to celebrate Thanksgiving", you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then we had, like, sausages and mashed potato with, like, a spinach kind of stuff in 'em.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I don't remember what they called that stuff.  It was called [inaudible] cabbage maybe was in 'em, cabbage and mashed potatoes.
R:  Ah.
L:  And, uh, yeah, so it really wasn't Thanksgiving at all, but ...
R:  Oh, that's interesting, yeah.
L:  But to come home this year and have Thanksgiving was really nice.
R:  Yeah, it's really great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Also as, um, to talk about another holiday, when I was little I never celebrated Halloween 'cause my mother thought it was dangerous.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And -- and so I never went trick or treating and, you know --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, no.
R:  I never -- rarely dressed up in costumes.  And I didn't really care 'cause I didn't -- I didn't know what I was missing.
L:  Oh, right.
R:  Lived in a pretty rural area so it wasn't like all the other kids are walking by and I'm looking -- you know, not in the middle of the woods --
L:  So ... yeah.
R:  But so now I do it up, you know.  My boyfriend and I will -- crazy elaborate costumes and, you know --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- as an adult it's so much more fun.
L:  What were you this year?
R:  This year my boyfriend and I were a dead bride and groom.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I bought a wedding dress.
L:  Mhm.
R:  An old one --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but I bought a wedding dress. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And he bought an old suit and we [SIGH] did, um, some really good dead makeup --
L:  [LAUGH] That's great.
R:  -- and had a dead bouquet of flowers and dead, uh, boutonniere.
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH] I don't --
R:  And scared the living daylights out of everyone.
L:  Yeah, Halloween's one of those that I don't celebrate at all.  In fact, my mother [MN] we always used to, uh, go trick or treating when we were kids, and I remember my mom one year made us, um, what do you -- what do you call -- oh, it's -- oh, like a -- a -- a mac and tuna casserole, like macaroni and cheese and canned tuna mixed up together.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Served, like, all stuck together.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I just -- I never liked canned tuna.  I thought it was really gross.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And my mom wouldn't let us go out trick or treating until we all finished.  And my brothers didn't really care.
R:  Jeeze.
L:  But I was just like, "Oh, this is terrible".  Like, "Mom, how can you do this?"  You know, I'm like, "It's trick or treating" and I was so ho mad and I'll never forget that she did that to us.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Horrible.  Horrible.
R:  I still call my mup- mom up and give her a hard time for not, um, letting me trick or treat.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I feel like I have this, like, excessive sweet tooth now as a result of --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- of not having been able to gorge myself one time a year for [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] But I'm over it just --
L:  So, did she pass out candy?
R:  Yeah.  Well, raisins. [LAUGH] And, like, little books and stuff.
L:  So, she'd give stuff out but she wouldn't let you go out and --
R:  Right.  Well, we lived literally -- I mean, we lived in a really rural area so maybe we would get one kid per year.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, it was, you know --
L:  Oh, right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- like, a half a mile between houses so people --
L:  Oh, goodness.
R:  -- weren't really coming out to my neighborhood to go trick or treating.  So, I think that was also part of it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It was a major effort for her to take us, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  All right.
R:  And she wasn't willing to, uh ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- go through with that, I don't know.
L:  That's funny.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Okay.
R:  So, did they -- I think the other part of the question was if you would create your own holiday.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  But I -- I'm not inspired by that.
L:  I'm not inspired by that either.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm -- I'm glad -- I'm glad you put it that way because I -- I would have put it that my brain doesn't function that way and I can't -- I -- I can't -- I don't know.  My boyfriend's the one that has the imagination that just runs wild and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my -- I don't really have that much of an imagination.  He's left handed, I'm right handed, and you give me a question like that and I just --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I -- I just come up blank.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I -- I -- when, um, they posed the question, though, I re- -- I, uh, thought of Seinfeld when George's dad with the --
R:  I thought of the same thing.
L:  [LAUGH] Did you? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I totally thought of the same thing.  That's hysterical.  Which was pretty -- that was a pretty brilliant moment, actually.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And so then I was trying to think, like, really fast on my feet, like, well, what would I come up with?  I don't --
L:  No, I couldn't come up with anything.
R:  But -- but I -- well, actually one time I did come up with -- I -- I declared a certain day my day worldwide.  Like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because I was looking at the calendar and there was some random holiday written on there.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And I thought, "Well, just because it's on the calendar, that means that, like, suddenly -- I don't have to observe it, of course, but, you know" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Just because someone somewhere says that today is whatever --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like Australian flag day or something --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- then, you know, it is.  That's the day, whether I celebrate it or not, you know.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Christmas is Christmas whether people celebrate it or not.  So, I said, "Well, why not declare myself a day?"  So, I declared, you know, some -- I don't even remember what day it was.  I think it was, like, November seventh.  I wish I could remember, it'd be great.
L:  Hm.
R:  But I said, "This is, you know, my day and people in Australia, even though they don't -- aren't observing it, you know, they're existing in my day".
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  And I was very fired up about that for a while.  But, um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- no one really caught on to it [LAUGH] so nothing happened.
L:  You make yourself queen of the world and make everybody take off and pay homage --
R:  Yeah, I definitely didn't get any presents or money, so ...
L:  -- on November seventh.
R:  And no likenesses of my image were erected anywhere, so I just [LAUGH] -- that's why. [LAUGH] But that's the only --
L:  I had --
R:  -- time I've ever come to creating a holiday.
L:  Oh.  My -- I had, uh, friends that would always have parties.  They wouldn't have parties for Halloween or for Christmas or for anything like that, but pick, like, a random celestial event in the year and they would have a party for it.  Like, winter solstice begins, they'd have a party for that.
R:  There you go.
L:  And I always thought that that was really cool.  Like, they're celebrating something just a little more off the wall.
R:  Right.
L:  And use it as an excuse.
R:  But yet it's still like a theme.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  That's really cool.
L:  And use it as an excuse to have a party.  And so never mind Christmas parties, never mind any of that, they had those parties, and I always thought that that was so neat.  They were always a lot of fun.
R:  My cousin has an Oscar party.
L:  Oh, really?  Oh, that's --
R:  Like a -- like a charity party or something.  Like, people have to actually pay to come to her party, but it's for charity.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But they have to dress like somebody at the Oscars.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I've never been to it.  It's a total show she does in San Francisco.  She's over the top.  But, like, it's become this big event in her neighborhood.
L:  Huh.
R:  Sounds really fun.
L:  I wonder if anybody comes as Oscar.  I bet there's at least a token one every year.
R:  Sure there's somebody.  Well, she's in San Francisco, so, you know, she's got all these flamboyant friends.  And one of her guy friends --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- came as J. Lo or as -- I guess she was Jennifer Lopez at the time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in that green dress, the controversial green dress.
L:  I don't remember ... is that from --
R:  It's like a scarf. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  The whole dress is like a scarf.
L:  I don't think I saw that.
R:  It's -- it was -- like, there was a big, like, deal about it, you know, was it even a dress and all this stuff 'cause it was practically like -- it was all sheer --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and then just like a scarf.  But this guy came dressed as that and it was hysterical.
L:  Oh, that's really funny.
R:  Yeah.  I love anything where you have to dress up 'cause I just have such a good time with that.
L:  Yeah, Halloween, right, right.
R:  Outdo everyone, and I'm an actress, I like to dress up. [LAUGH]
L:  I -- [LAUGH] I thought that if I went to a Halloween party, um, not this Halloween but the one before, that I would go as, um, [LAUGH] Kylie Minogue in the -- in the "Can't get you out of my head" video [LAUGH] because --
R:  Mm.
L:  Do you know that outfit?
R:  Yeah.
L:  The white one.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  Because it looks -- it looks kind of like a ghost outfit but I think it'd be pretty scary. [LAUGH]
R:  That's funny.  One of the scariest things I -- my boyfriend and I last year dressed up as, um, old people.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Just old people, like an old -- like, grandma and gran- -- ma and pop.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it was so subtle, but we did all the details, that people just thought we were old.
L:  Wow.
R:  And we got out on the dance floor and we started dancing and people were like, "Those old people can move".  "They're not old people.  Ha ah ah ah".  It was really funny.
L:  [LAUGH] You're like out there break dancing and stuff.
R:  We were -- yeah, we were just busting [inaudible].  But it was, um, it was really good.
L:  [LAUGH] I'm picturing, like, the church lady, [LAUGH] you know, like, out there dancing.
R:  Yeah.  And I mean, and the costume was real 'cause I just went to the thrift shop and got old man pants and, you know, like, old lady skirt.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, you know, did a little -- couple of makeup lines, I got myself a wig, and that was it.  It was really easy.
L:  Mm.
R:  Cheapest costume you'll --
