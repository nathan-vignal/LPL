R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  How are you?
L:  Okay. This is Alice.
R:  I'm Raquel.
L:  Hi, Raquel.
R:  How are you today?
L:  I'm just wonderful, thank you.
R:  Good.  Good.  Good.  So, do you really want to talk about this airport security topic or do you want to talk about something else?
L:  Ah, it doesn't matter to me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  So, we could talk airport security.
R:  Sure.  I think what -- the question was, do you feel make -- does it make travel any safer or something like that, with the heightened security.  What do you think?
L:  Yes.  I do.
R:  You do?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  I don't think it does.
L:  Why's that?
R:  [inaudible] all those recent little incidents that keep popping up, like those people who were getting -- gotten busted taking coi- -- ah, knives on to the planes and, how, you know, people are just able to get around from plane to plane without identification.  How about one guy, I think it was like he didn't have the [inaudible] to scare his wife, he like snuck some box cutters onto a plane --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- not too long ago.  And that stuff is still happening.  I don't know.
L:  Well, I -- I have heard of isolated cases where people have taken things onto a plane, inadvertently, uh -- nothing that was, you know, meant to -- I mean, just innocent people who realised afterward they had certain things on their possession --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I still think overall that it's much safer flying now than it was a year and a half ago because, I mean, it's been my experience in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my travel over the last couple of months that, um, it -- everyone is scrutinized much more severely than they've ever been in the US and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, I mean, I just think everyone's more alert and everybody's paying attention and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the people they have in place now, at least in the airports that I've flown in or out of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, are much more professional and are much more on their toes than --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the folks that were in place a year ago.
R:  Yeah, I do notice that, because I -- I've been traveling too and I have noticed that they do seem, I [inaudible] -- I don't know, maybe, but they seem to [inaudible] concerned, but they are paying a little bit more attention to the detailed stuff.  So, I have noticed that as well.
L:  I mean, my bags have been torn apart every time I travel.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have not.
L:  I must -- I must have that look or something.  I don't know.
R:  Oh, no.  I -- it's weird, because that hasn't happened to me.  I've been -- I've flown maybe about four times since then and that hasn't happened to me yet --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I'm -- and it's funny, because I do run into people who tell me that every time they get stopped.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I traveled from the US to Europe and, um, all the airports in Europe tore my bags apart and in the US they tore them apart --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and I flew one -- one, ah, on the way back from one trip a couple of weeks ago they did not check my bags.  But that --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, the other times that I flew they did.  So, I --
R:  Yeah.  I -- I've run into people who fly [inaudible] certain parts of the country, for instance, like Texas or Florida --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it -- they get their bags checked a lot, well coming back from Texas or Florida or California --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like LA or San Antonio or Miami, because they're all like, you know, near coasts --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like near the border --
L:  Right.
R:  They get [inaudible] all the time.  All the time.  But like, I don't know, because I, like, the last two times I've been flying I've flown to Chicago and, ah, can't remember where else I went, but I [inaudible] I was like flying inland and not near any major borders, so I guess maybe that's why, I'm not sure.
L:  How about Philadelphia?  Did you fly in or out of Philly?
R:  I was flying out of Philly.
L:  Yeah, because, I mean, a- -- they ripped everything apart in Philly --
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know [LAUGH] I mean I --
R:  That's weird.
L:  -- had to take my sh-
R:  They must -- they must be targeting certain are- -- you know, certain, I guess popular areas too, I guess, for smugglers or whatever.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I think, you know, a lot of it is just random checking, but my husband set off, um, the alarm the last time we traveled and so I don't know whether they pulled me aside too just because they pulled him aside.
R:  Actually, I did get pulled aside once, but not my bags.
L:  Mhm.
R:  When I walked the metal detector and it was because some metal in my bra set off the alarm.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  And I was like, "Oh my god, I was so embarrassed" and the lady like waved the wand near my chest, she was like, "Oh, miss, it's your bra, I'm sorry".
L:  Hey, did you hear about that lad- -- that French lady?
R:  Wh-
L:  She -- she was getting totally pissed off because, um, it was her bra that was setting off the, um, the security, um, you know, the wand and everything she --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- did, it set off the alarm.  And it was her bra and she finally got really pissed off and took her blouse and her bra off and said, "Okay, now try it" --
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  Yeah.  She was -- and they arrested her for indecent exposure.
R:  Ah, for nudity?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I thought it was pretty funny.
R:  That is funny.  That is funny.  I -- I hadn't heard that.
L:  It's called the height of -- the height of frustration [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know those French, they don't care anyway, that's no big deal.
R:  That's true.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They love showing of the body, they're very comfortable with it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they don't care.  I can't believe that.  That's funny.
L:  Yeah.  I would love to have been there.  I bet that was a scene.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Funny.  And that was in US airport?
L:  Ah, you know, I don't really remember.  This was about -- probably about six weeks ago, or maybe even two months ago.  And I don't remember if it was in the US -- she was from France, I know that, but I don't remember if it was a French --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't remember if it was in Europe or if it was in the US.
R:  [NOISE] [MN]
L:  It probably wasn't in France, though, because they -- I don't think they'd arrest her for indecent exposure --
R:  Nah, probably not.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]  Amazing.  Amazing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I can't believe it.
L:  Got to love it.
R:  [MN] Well, I just hope it gets better because I do plan on traveling again soon and next summer and I just don't know.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  On the s- -- I -- I like to fly -- I don't have a problem with flying, but sometimes I do wonder, you know, like, is my flight going to be the next flight?  You know.
L:  Well, a- I think that, it's a concern, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like everything else in life, I mean, you never know what's going to happen and you can't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- live your life around, you know, worrying about those sort of things.  You use your best judgment and you -- you -- you're aware and -- and think about what you're doing, but, I mean, there's not a whole lot you can do if -- if, ah, you're careful and you do everything right and something happens.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, I'm not going to stop flying because of these idiots.
R:  Oh, yeah, that's r- -- that's true.  I mean.
L:  You know.
R:  Look, the -- like, two weeks after that happened, I was in a wedding in Houston [LAUGH] and, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- the rest of the part- -- wedding party and myself, including the -- the ma- -- you know, the groom and the bride, lived here in Philadelphia --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and we -- we had no -- we had -- I mean, we had no choice at that point because we'd already paid for our tickets --
L:  Yeah, that, I mean, I think right after nine eleven, flying was very difficult and, I mean, the airports in the US were always lax, I mean, really we -- we've never done a good job of, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of, you know, security in the airports, I mean, ah, I can't think of one US airport that I've ever flown through that I felt was really -- Miami probably more so than any of the other ones, but we've never done a good job, I mean, it's totally different in other parts of the world, they have security much more, um, together than we -- we have had in the past.  But I do think we're getting there.  I mean, I see a huge improvement over a year ago. [NOISE]  Are you there, Raquel?  Hello?  Hello? [NOISE]  Hi, this is Alice Johnston, I was on a phone call with Raquel, ah, for the, ah, Fisher Project and I have no idea how I got you, but all of a s- [NOISE] my phone number is eight five six seven eight -- oh [NOISE].
