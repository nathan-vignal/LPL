L:  Hi, how are you? [LAUGH]
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My name's Amy.
L:  My name's Kristin.
R:  Hi, Kristin.
L:  [LAUGH] Nice to meet you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, we're gonna talk about holidays?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I was just thinking about holidays because, um, I heard that that was the topic and it's, uh -- I was thinking about how much I always love Christmas even though the -- [LAUGH] the hype surrounding it in -- just in terms of shopping is so ridiculous, but then --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- as I was waiting this really cheesy holiday music came on and kept repeating. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I was just thinking, "Well, it's not exactly perfect, but ..." [SIGH]
R:  Well, I have to say I -- I've -- I'm coming to the conclusion I think there should actually be a -- a law that you can't start celebrating Christmas before Thanksgiving.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, because the -- the cheesy holiday music in the hall -- in the malls and such wears on you after a while and then when Christmas actually runs arou- -- rolls around, you're sick of it. [LAUGH]
L:  That's true.  Yeah, I've been in school for a couple of years now and, um, that's actually a really good way to go because you end up being so busy that you don't have time to shop until the last week anyway.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And so I get really sick of the Christmas music for, like, one day and then it's already Christmas. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, you ha- -- did you think of any holiday that you would wanna create?
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like -- well, it's like when they said that I started thinking.  I'm like, "Jeeze, I don't know".  I kind of -- I mean --
L:  Can -- yeah.  That's -- that's --
R:  I -- I mean, and what -- what we haven't created through our culture Hallmark has managed to create for us through, uh, their greeting card industry, so [LAUGH] yeah, we now have --
L:  True.
R:  -- Grandparents' Day and -- and, um -- 'cause what is it?  We did, um [LIPSMACK] -- I had a friend who did some research around Mother's Day and discovered that it really was started by the greeting card industry 'cause they wanted -- they needed --
L:  Oh, I heard that, yeah.
R:  -- they needed a reason to -- for people to send cards. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, actually in -- I don't know.  I -- actually I -- I probably have one idea of a holiday to create just to -- I w- -- I just had to g- -- the assignment for school to go to this Jewish service just to be a witness basically.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, everybody -- I -- I had no idea that basically everyone would -- everyone prays in Hebrew together and some of the time everyone was just whispering together and -- in Hebrew.  And so, of course, I -- I couldn't understand anything, but it was really powerful just to have a group of people in a room, um, and -- and not -- to have silence as well in -- a- actually, if I could create any holiday, I would probably create a -- like, a communal, like, silence, day of silence [LAUGH] where people would come together and sit and, uh, not be allowed to say anything. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's interesting.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um --
L:  'Cause it -- it might be a really beautiful thing.  There's not really -- there aren't really many spaces where people can -- can just kind of be together without a whole lot of noise and distraction or the need to really say a whole lot. [SIGH]
R:  True.  And we frequently are uncomfortable with silence.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That --
L:  Particularly on the phone 'cause that's like the one --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- medium [LAUGH] that you have of communicating, so it's hard to interpret silence, I guess.
R:  True, espec- -- and actually probably it's harder on the phone because you can't see the person to read body language.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Whereas if you're face to face with a person and they're silent, you can still get some indication from them through body language as to whether they're happy or sad or --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- you know, what they're feeling.
L:  Yeah, and it's funny to see that people on the phone usually actually do have a lot of body language that's even more pronounced, like they're trying to convey something. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yes.  I remember, um, when my -- well, especially my daughter was younger and, you know, we put her on the phone, she'd go to -- to talk a- and somebody -- you know, grandma would say, "Oh, yeah, you know, do we -- did you like school today?" or whatever, and she'd nod her head.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's like, "You have to talk.  You -- you -- they can't see you doing that". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] yeah.  I can remember a time when I was little and my -- my dad did the same thing.  I was -- I was nodding and nodding [LAUGH] and he was like, "I don't think you realize that your niece is, like, [LAUGH] answering you really". [LAUGH]
R:  But, yeah, that's -- I don't know.  Maybe -- 
L:  So --
R:  Maybe videophones will take care of that, who knows?
L:  [LAUGH] Well then, what is, uh -- what's your favorite holiday?
R:  [MN] Probably Christmas.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I guess it is Christmas.  Um, I just like all the -- I like decorating and we have lots of family traditions that we -- you know, we do lots of family stuff together, and that's -- I like that, so, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  With -- it's neat to, er -- growing up, you know, past traditions from my husband's family and my family we've blended into our family, so, you know, we'll keep passing those on to our kids and that's kind of neat.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  And I love Christmas music, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Though -- though there's a rule in my house that you can't play it till December first.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's good. [LAUGH] But --
R:  [LAUGH] So, 'cause my son would play it all year round if we let him. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, there's a whole industry now of, like, different kinds of Christmas carols and having -- you know, having them played in different ways and different instrumental backgrounds, and I actually really love that.  It -- it feels -- it always feels to me that there's th- -- only -- the only culture we have is, you know, comes across [LAUGH] through Christmas music --
R:  True.
L:  -- because everybody knows it and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and can build upon it and add these creative improvisations or interpretations.  And, yeah, I find it really beautiful and it's -- it's funny that it -- that that's the one -- one medium [LAUGH] where it's really clear there's some kind of culture that's developed, like, even in the United States.
R:  Right, and it's true.  It's -- it's -- we are -- I mean, as -- as -- it's a melting pot country that's another pl- -- it's -- it's one place where everything could melt together because everyone can share their Christmas carols.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it was [inaudible] everyone has the different flavor and it just -- yeah, it blended and then so we sing Oh Tanenbaum and Silent Night from, you know, that are German and --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Except [LAUGH] I heard once on public radio that they were saying that the United States is actually more like a tossed salad [LAUGH] than a melting pot.
R:  [LAUGH] Than a melting -- yeah, that's probably true.
L:  [LAUGH] Because I think it was pretty much tossed together but there isn't a lot of immigration or assimilation, not that there should be, but still.
R:  Right.  You can still take out each individual thing.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.  And I -- I'm singing in this choir this weekend.  We had a performance and it -- I mean, it was just so obvious that we had one token Jewish song and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [inaudible] and, uh, it just -- it's -- it's almost like [LAUGH] just embarrassing that [LAUGH] ...
R:  Well, yeah, actually my -- my daughter's Christmas concert was tonight, and they did a -- a little program was called December Nights, December Lights where they -- they had, like, a theme song of December lights and lights in December and, you know, aren't they pretty and all that stuff, um, but that they also -- that the lights bring us together as friends and family and community.  And then they -- what they -- the program discussed was, um, Hanukkah and, um, a Spanish tradition of the -- the luminaries and how Mary and Joseph go -- you know, go from house to -- I can't remember the name of the feast.  They go from house to house and they're -- they're turned away at every door --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- until they get to the house with the luminaries in it and then they're invited in.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I think it's Los Posados[?], that might be it.  But it was -- so they had, you know, two, you know, Jewish and Spanish cultures represented, but we didn't talk about anything else. [LAUGH]
L:  Sure, [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  It was -- like, I mean, it's -- it's good, but they were precious.
L:  Yeah, it's true.  It's funny to hear different people's reactions to that kind of thing, though, because I -- I'm in this class about Judaism right now, and the teacher just gets really irate about the whole -- the whole preach -- preachy universalism, like we -- we all can go together and we all can kind of fit together when -- and -- and on the one hand it's really good, but I guess she just feels she's only a voice to stand up against just ironing out all the differences that -- that do actually exist and -- and that are hard to reconcile. [LIPSMACK]
R:  Hm.
L:  Mhm.  Like, yeah, she just sees these -- these morals of, um, like, rationalism and equality and -- and she sees them as -- as coming from the -- the Protestant religion, um, which kind of caused a -- a lot of -- a lot of people in Judaism to get rid of a lot of the traditional practices and rituals.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just in favor of fitting in with the new -- with the new ideas and the new -- the new view -- view that everybody's equal and -- and reason can figure out solutions to everything.  Which, it's not as though -- it's not as though that's bad [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to ha- -- to have those views, but, yeah.
R:  Hm.
L:  [LAUGH] So ...
R:  That's funny 'cause it -- actually I find some of the Jewish traditions to be the most beautiful.  Um, like, I mean where I was, um, someplace and they were -- we celebrated a seder supper and that's just ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, it's neat, the -- the prayers they say and the -- and the, you know, the ritual lighting of the candle and the -- they explain the symbolism of -- of everything that's -- you know, so that just a passing on that things have meaning --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as opposed to they're just there.  You know, it's not material -- it's not -- they're not only material, they have a deeper meaning 'cause they -- you know, they symbolize something else that we remember and we value, um, in a -- as a, um, [PAUSE] you know, as a -- as a Catholic we don't have.  We don't have a whole lot of things like that.  I know there's a crucifix or whatever, but it's not the -- the ritual that goes with it.
L:  Oh, that's a --
R:  You know, C- Catholics just go to -- we only go to church on Sunday and that's it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's [LAUGH] -- that's interesting 'cause I had a teacher who I guess he grew up Catholic and he had decided not to stick with the -- with the church, but he was always really adamant about the fact that they -- the church should never have gotten rid of the Latin mass.
R:  [MN] Ah.
L:  Because I guess it used to be a really central focus to Catholicism where -- where --
R:  Right, where you had to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You had to learn -- you had to learn the responses in Latin otherwise you couldn't participate.
L:  Yeah.  And at the same time I wonder how much of that was really understood as far as the meaning of the words. [SIGH] Um ...
R:  Right, right.  Well, actually, I mean, the -- it wasn't, because that's why they ultimately changed it. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, right, yeah.  And, like, on the other hand it makes it -- it seems as though maybe just not understanding was really powerful or could be very powerful.
R:  Because it -- it's the -- yeah, it's more the -- it's the ritual of the -- the ch- -- you know, it's more chanting.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because, you know, they were shorter things to m-
