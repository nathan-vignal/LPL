L:  Hi, my name's Tico.
R:  Hi, I'm Julie.  What's your name?
L:  Tico.  T.I.C.O.
R:  Oh, okay.  How are you?
L:  I'm good, how are you?
R:  Good.  So, what are your thoughts on airport security?
L:  Um, I guess it's better now than it used to be.  I mean, it used to be that I could, you know, like get a knife into a -- an airplane without much of a problem, you know, like even, like the reasonably big one I keep on my keychain, you know, it's -- it's bigger than the, than a box cutter and I used to, you know, I used to travel with it pretty frequently.
R:  I still think I could get on with a knife, though.  I think they only profile certain people.  It's what makes the new standards kind of wrong.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I get -- I mean, they're profiling like -- it's semi-legitimate, you know, like it is because I mean --
R:  Right, why wouldn't I bring a knife onto a plane?
L:  I don't know.  Would you?  I mean --
R:  I mean, I don't feel  see why anyone would [LAUGH] so, like, it -- I mean, I don't see how you can profile a certain type of person.
L:  Well, I mean, empirically, like, all the terrorists have been Arabs, right, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- why would it, you know, doesn't it make sense to, you know, identify like, oh, Arabs are more likely than not to be terrorists?
R:  But I think it's unfair to those Arabs who are not terrorists.
L:  Yeah, no, it's somewhat unfair but, like, you know, if they're -- if they're not terrorists, like, you know, I mean right now they -- they still like every third person gets a -- has to take their shoes off and stuff.  So, you know, like it shouldn't be a huge issue.
R:  I know they say every third person, but I really feel like the people I seem them doing it to are definitely who meet certain profiles.  Do you know what I'm saying?  Like even --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- thought it's supposedly random --
L:  Yeah.
R:  , I don't actually observe it to be so.
L:  I don't know.  I flew a lot this summer and I only got -- um, I'm Indian, so I look sort of Arab, you know, so -- I -- I only got, you know, I only got pulled over once.  And there are a lot of people like that.  I remember once there was old white lady was really mad because she got pulled over, like had to take her shoes off and stuff --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I heard her talking at the -- the terminal later about how that Arab and she pointed at me got to walk right through 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- while she had -- she had to take her shoes off and stuff.  She was really angry about that.
R:  [NOISE] Well, it's so interesting because, like, for me I've had like the opposite experience, like all the times that I've flown this summer I've seen them target like only Arab people --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- or people who were like tall and had beards and things like that.
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm like, whenever I was traveling with people, like me and my friends always went through on our --
L:  Oh, that's strange.
R:  -- own.
L:  I -- I was really worried about that because I got -- I spent three months in [inaudible] and when I got back --
R:  This was where?
L:  I spent three months in Alaska this summer and when I got back like I hadn't shaved in three months, like I hadn't cut my hair in three months so I was -- I was looking pretty ragged --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I was just like prepared for like all sorts of trouble going through -- through the -- the airports and I really didn't have any.  I'm kind of worried about, like, you know, like anti like, um, profiling, like airport security getting scared that, oh, we don't want to appear racist, so we'll let, you know, these people through, even if they do appear suspicious.
R:  I actually, like I don't even notice that there's been much security, like the last time I went on a trip I went to Texas --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I forgot to bring ID --
L:  Really?  And they let you on a plane?
R:  -- to the airport.
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I got on.
L:  Wow.  That's strange.
R:  I mean, I was with other people and they all had IDs, so maybe that was okay --
L:  Yeah
R:  -- but, I mean, I myself didn't have any ID, I just had my ticket and I got on.
L:  They wouldn't let me -- uh, they wouldn't let me pick up my girlfriend's ticket for her even though I -- I had her driver's licence on me --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  They said, "No, she has to be here".
R:  Wow.
L:  So, it's strange.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um ...
R:  So, you think there has been, like, a good increase in security?
L:  Yeah.  Well, the lines are longer, if nothing else.  I mean, it seems to be harder, like when I -- when I pick up friends at the airport, I can't get into the, uh, I can't like meet them at the gate --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because they, uh, [inaudible] you have to stay outside the gate which I think is pretty annoying, actually, but I guess it's better.
R:  Yeah, [inaudible] yeah, it's more annoying than I think it is safe.  But --
L:  Yeah.  I mean, realistically, I don't have any business near the airplanes, so like there's no reason I should be able to walk up near them.
R:  Yeah.  I think it's sad that we have to worry about things like that.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's different [inaudible] really, it's strange.  But I guess, I mean, like you can't even -- used to be, I mean, airplanes used to be like -- it feels like more fun, you know, you could smoke cigarettes and, you know, like drinks for free and now they're really like -- and I don't think -- I'm -- I'm [inaudible].
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  Like, I think, like only international only on some airlines.  Um.  Which I guess makes sense, but ...  Um ...
R:  Where do you -- do you fly to India a lot, is that where you ...?
L:  Um, just occasionally.  I haven't actually gone in several years.  But --
R:  No, I was just wondering if maybe it was just -- the difference between international flight security and domestic.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Actually, international, like, they're really like -- when you do fly them, then they're like -- they're really strict, like you have to show several forms of ID, all these things.
R:  Because I've never flown internationally, so maybe, you know, my experiences are different from yours for that reason.
L:  Yeah.  That could be it.  It's been a while.  Yeah.
R:  I've only flown four times since September eleventh, so ...
L:  I -- I stay from [inaudible] I like to drive anyway.  But, yeah, I stayed away from airplanes for a while.
R:  Really?
L:  After that.
R:  Because you were scared?
L:  I -- I was, yeah, I was thinking, "Well, I could fly, but, you know, I might as well drive" because, like, I -- I wasn't scared of, uh, getting bombs, but, you know, it was just like, like the wait was longer, you know, like there's a hassle and like it's the kind of stress I don't need because you never really know, like, you know, what plane is going to be targeted.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Anything -- I -- I had a friend who was on a -- he was on -- he was flying to Washington and somebody stood up and that like thirty minutes -- thirty minutes outside of, uh, DC you're not allowed to stand up and suddenly this -- this old guy he sort of just got up and went to the bathroom and they had to re route the plane to a different airport.
R:  Why?
L:  It's -- it's like a standard procedure when flying into Reagan International now [inaudible].
R:  That's ridiculous.
L:  Yeah.  If you're flying, like, out of Reagan you can't stand up for thirty minutes until -- [MN] for the first three minutes or when you're flying in you can't stand up once you're thirty minutes outside the airport.
R:  So, they had to re route the plane for that?
L:  Yeah.  They -- they put it into BWI.
R:  Wow.
L:  And then, like, you know, he was at the wrong airport, so he had to take a train and that cab from BWI out to Reagan to get his luggage and stuff.  So, I guess like, I mean in some instances, like, that was like a little severe.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  But I guess they're trying to make, like regulations that people can follow rather than --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ask people to make decisions.
R:  Wow.
L:  What do you feel about the, uh, the pilots being armed?
R:  Um, I haven't heard about that, actually.
L:  I don't think they passed some resolution.
R:  Is that -- is that a new issue?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  About having like -- not like, not allowing them to be armed, but like regulating that pilots carry, uh, handguns.  
R:  I mean, I suppose it's fine unless, like, the -- I mean, I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess, I mean if policemen are allowed to, then I don't see why --
L:  Yeah.  The problem --
R:  -- other authority figures shouldn't be allowed to.
L:  It feels strange because, I mean like, it's kind of like there's going to be a gun on the plane, now, you know, and like in the ideal situation there's no gun on the plane, but if pilots have guns, then somebody's got a gun.
R:  I guess it's better that they have one in case one of the passengers does.  But like ...
L:  Yeah. And the other thing that worries me is, like, maybe someone getting the gun away from the pilot, it might happen, instead of like a guy with a box cutter, you've got a guy with a handgun.
R:  Yeah.  No, actually, that's very like statistically true.  That in general the people who carry weapons for self defence end up having them used against them.  So, I guess that'll be something to keep in mind.
L:  Mm.
R:  Hello?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, sorry.  But, I don't know, I think a lot of the measures that have been taken as a result of the September eleventh are kind of silly.  Just because I don't think anything -- like, I don't really think the risk has changed since then.
L:  I think -- I think a lot of it is just to make people feel better --
R:  Yeah
L:  Like there's -- kind of like visible, like, okay, like security's better now, you know, go ahead and fly.  Because I think, like the airline industry is already, like, in trouble in general because people aren't flying as much as they used to.
R:  I know.  That's why I think, I don't know, I just think it's a little silly that people are scared all of a sudden when, like, there's always, you know, when plane crashes, it doesn't even have to be a terrorist, there's always been, like, risks involved.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I don't know.
L:  I never -- I never really liked flying, period because, like --
R:  What?
L:  I really never fly- -- liked flying like period just because like, you -- you have like zero control over what's happening --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you're kind of in like a precarious position, you know.  As much as statistically it's safe, like, you're -- you know, thirty thousand feet in the air, you know, things go wrong, you don't really have much of a chance.
R:  Well, it's a whole lot easier than, like, many other forms of travel.
L:  Yeah, it is.  It's fast, too.
R:  Even to like, go to Boston, or something. It -- it's cheaper to fly than to take Amtrak from where I am.
L:  Yeah.  Amtrak's just expensive, for some reason.  It's like a -- it's like an eighty dollar ride to Boston from Philly, isn't it?
R:  Where are you?
L:  I'm in Philly, Philadelphia.
R:  Okay.  Me, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you go to Penn?
L:  Yep.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  Do you?
R:  What?
L:  Do you?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh.
R:  Are you an undergraduate?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But.
L:  Yeah, I'm just -- how about you?  Are you?
R:  I'm a sophomore.
L:  Oh, okay.  How are finals going for you?
R:  Pretty good.  No, I haven't really had any yet --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- so, I start next Tuesday.  So, I should probably start studying at some point.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How about you?
L:  I've -- I've just got -- I got one final on Wednesday, but I'm just kind of writing papers nonstop.  So [inaudible].
R:  What year are you?
L:  Ah, I'm in senior, actually.
R:  What's your major?
L:  Um, linguistics.
R:  Okay.  So, that's why you're in the study.
L:  Yeah, well, yeah, I worked for the LDC[?] briefly, so I got their newsletter and I got this.
R:  Oh, okay.  Have you experienced any like problems in terms of like being profiled for looking Arab?
L:  I don't think so.  I don't know.  I'm kind of like, this like non descript brown person, I don't look [inaudible] I definitely don't look Indian and I don't really look like super Arab, either.
R:  Mm.
L:  I tell people I'm Mexican a lot.  This kind of thing.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  It's entertaining, because I don't really have an accent.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, yeah, I can't really think of much.
R:  And where have you flown to in the all the times you've been traveling this summer?
L:  Um, mostly out West.  Um, I've got a lot of friends in San Francisco and Denver, so it's really easy to find a cheap place out there now.  They've got a -- they've got a hundred dollar round trip to, uh, to Denver.
R:  Wow.
L:  [inaudible] yeah, it's crazy, I couldn't believe it.
R:  On what airline?
L:  Um, I think it was US Air.
R:  Wow.
L:  I pricelined it, I was kind of like, I got on board, I'll priceline like a ridiculously cheap, you know, flight.  So, by now I don't have any --
R:  I've never used priceline.
L:  Oh, it's awesome. Like sometimes, like, a lot of times they're like, you know, you don't get anything, but like when you hit, you just like hit big.
R:  So, if you do priceline, do you have to be prepared to like, spontaneously travel?
L:  No, you -- you can say like I want to travel on this -- this date and I want to get back on this date, this is what I've got -- what I'll pay.
R:  Mm.
L:  [inaudible] the probabilities, like you've got a ten percent chance of that
