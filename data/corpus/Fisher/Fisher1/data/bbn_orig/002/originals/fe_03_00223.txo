L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name's Brent.
R:  Oh, hi, my name's Martin.
L:  Hi, okay.
R:  So --
L:  So --
R:  You start.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH] Uh ... what do I look for in a life partner, huh?
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Well, I think one important thing is probably a sense of humor.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's important to me, um, because life has a way of, um, dealing its -- I mean, you have your ups and downs but there are a lot of downs sometimes and I think you need a sen- sense of humor to get through some of those challenges.
R:  Well, that's true.  I -- I think though that one of the most important things would be that you agree on fundamental basics.  I don't know if I can put the finger like that on -- on one thing, but just saying that, I don't know, something sort of really important to you that --
L:  Kinda like world value maybe or something like that?
R:  Probably something like --
L:  Or views?
R:  Right.  I- In some things that definitely -- I mean, of course, anything can be argued, but some things that you to have some common ground and ... I think the major rights and wrongs of things that, you know, allow you to ... uh, build from there.  I think that it would be really difficult for me to be with someone that is completely the opposite from me.
L:  Right, right, right.  So, you don't believe in, uh -- in, uh, um, the maxim that opposites attract and, uh ... [LAUGH]
R:  I don't think so.  I think that applies to some degree, but I don't know, if there's something -- if there's some things that I hold really dearly, and you're exactly against all that, I think a har- pretty hard time, um, building from that, especially if that's essential for me.  Does that make any sense?
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.  I think I understand what you're saying.
R:  So, I don't know, I think it would be a little bit more difficult if you're so -- so different.  But, I mean, who knows?  Different people value different things and some people appreciate some things more than others so you know, I think it depends.
L:  That's true.  Um, I think one -- one thing that's important too is the, um ... how to say this, in -- ab- ability to compromise perhaps is, um, a way of saying that, um -- 'cause if --
R:  Yeah, I -- yeah, I think that's [LAUGH] actually a really important [LAUGH] ...
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, 'cause you know, we're -- you're never going to agree a hundred percent, I know, on everything and ...
R:  That's true.
L:  Yeah, in fact I knew -- I had -- I -- I had a friend once who, um ...he's -- it's funny.  I -- I- it seemed unnatural to me but he often, with his spouse, they would -- they would make decisions and he would say, "Well, you know, my feeling on a scale from one to ten is seven" --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And she'd say, "Well, I feel like it's -- you know, it's a four" and then [LAUGH] -- and then they'd make a decision on whether or not to --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to proceed with that and to me it was really strange but it seemed to work with them.
R:  I don't know.  It's kinda cool though because you've got an empirical value there, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so you can like say, "Well, others [inaudible].  If it's more than five we'll go for it".  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, exactly.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's actually -- that's really interesting.  I never thought about it in those terms.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah it just sounded -- it just -- when they went through it, it just was so strange to me but -- but, yeah, I think I agree with you that, I mean, it worked, but it just -- to me it just sounded unnatural to do that.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, you know, but I think that's the key, you know?  It could [several inaudible words] as long as it works for you, you know, who knows?
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's all I can say.
L:  Right.
R:  And so, I don't know, some people get some strange things going, but if you're happy, I mean, hell, you know, who are we to say?
L:  Right, exactly.  I know.  I know what you mean.  It's hard for us to be the judges, isn't it?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it is, although it's kind of easy sometimes to get into that mode but --
L:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
R:  But I think we all have lots of opinion [COUGH] -- opinions when it comes to many things, you know.  But I don't know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's kind of wise to, um, put those on hold sometimes and -- and see and hear what other people think, where they're coming from and, sometimes you learn a lot more than you thought you would, you know.  It's just -- you can contemplate things in a completely different way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you know, you entertain different possibilities.  I think that's -- that's actually really important.
L:  Yes, I agree.  I -- I was thinking of another example, um ... I had this question asked of me once and -- in a group and someone said that they thought that the most important quality from a life partner would be that he or she, um, squeezes the toothpaste tube from the -- from the end instead of the middle.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, uh, the funny thing was was that, uh, I had another friend who -- who was trying to get out of a -- of a serious relationship and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and he used that excuse.  He said, "Well, I, you know, I'm -- I'm not organized and I squeeze the tube in the middle" ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, the -- the -- his significant other said, "Well, that's okay, you know, we can -- we can still live together.  We can just buy the pump.  The pump --" 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you see, I don't know.  That's a great example of how you can work around a -- a difficult problem of just squeezing the toothpaste from the wrong -- from the wrong end.  I don't know.
L:  Ri- right.
R:  That can be pretty significant for some people I guess.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I mean, these two got married so ... [LAUGH]
R:  We- if they got married then the topped work.  I mean, yeah, there we go again, who are we to say, you know?
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
R:  But I have a friend actually that she is ... um, she talks a lot about like lit- for me are little things like that, that are really important for her, how organized people are, but when it comes to, um, amalgamation poetry, that's why I thought of it, it's like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they racing for the race in the bathroom.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  She is really anal about that.
L:  Oh, right, right.
R:  She is like, "I couldn't live with someone that comes and puts like this little bowl thing here when it was there".  That's why she says she's never gonna get married.  I mean, she wants to have, I guess, a lover or something, but she could never share --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because her space has to be orated in such a way, and I don't know, I see -- I find that really odd.
L:  That -- yeah, definitely.
R:  But she's serious about it though.  She is like, "I can't do it.  You know, if you come and move my things around I just -- I'm not happy any more" so, well, okay ... [LAUGH]
L:  She needs to meet some- maybe meet someone who is rich and can have -- they could have two bathrooms, you know, so they wouldn't have to ... [LAUGH]
R:  But act- actually, you know I like that.  That -- that's a good way to put it.  It's like you can have your own bathroom --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and they can have their own bathroom so you don't have to worry about toiletries being misplaced.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You see there's always a solution.  That's the bottom line.
L:  Su- Sure.
R:  There's always a solution somewhere.  [LAUGH] The key is to find it.
L:  I agree.  Right, I agree, I agree.  Someone once said that, um, the source of all, um, problems with -- with life partners is the, um -- is selfishness, and you know, I -- I tend to agree.  That this was -- this was told to me by a therapist who had spent years --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- working with -- with partners and -- and helping them work through problems.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he said when he first hard that, he thought, "No" he thought, "That's not it.  There's, you know, there's more to it than all of that" but ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  But then after all that -- those years of experience, he pretty much could reduce it to -- to -- to simply that, that it was selfishness, and I -- I've always thought about that and wondered, um, if that -- if that is really ... what it is.
R:  Do you think that's -- that's what it is?
L:  Uh, you know from my exp- it just seems that, yeah, it seems like people -- well, I don't know.  Think of the example of your -- of your friend with the toiletries.  You know, is that -- is she being selfish?  I don't know.  I don't know if that -- if we would ... if you could say that, I don't know.
R:  You know, I think so.  I think so.  I think that we're all selfish to some degree.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think it's where -- you know, where you draw the line and how far you can go, but I think you're right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I suppose you could umbrella terms to say it's totally selfishness in the end because I think we are pretty particular, right?
L:  Yeah, I think so.
R:  And you don't want some boundary stepped upon and ... I think that's when you have like the whole selfish come into play and say, you know, "This is my limit.  From here on --"
L:  Right.
R:  "... this just can't happen" and, yeah.  I never thought of it in those terms though --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I think that's -- that's very true.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's kinda scary though at the same time to think that selfishness is the cause of that, right?
L:  Is it the cause of all?  But, yeah, yeah. 
R:  [LAUGH] It's the cause of all evil.
L:  [LAUGH] That may be true.
R:  To some degree but I think it's right.  I think you're probably right.  I mean, well, your friend has a pretty interesting theory of what's going on there.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Well, I know -- well, I'm -- I'm married actually --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and -- and, um, I know that when I was ... single --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I was old- I was older -- I was real- really old, but, um, I felt like I was getting old and I was concerned that I wasn't going to find my life partner and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, what kinda scared me was is that -- that I could go -- I could do things -- it got to be that I could do things by myself --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and be comfortable with it.  You know, I could go to a movie 'cause -- when I was growing up, I couldn't do that when I was in my younger ages I couldn't go to a movie by myself.  I had to go with my friends, you know.  I felt uncomfortable --
R:  Right.
L:  -- being alone, but as I was going along, I became more and more comfortable an- and kind of ... um, how would I say, um -- well, comfortable doing -- doing things by myself.
R:  Mhm.
L:  A- and -- and it used to worry me because I thought, "Wow, if I -- you know, if I really begin to feel this way all the time, then maybe I won't have a desire to -- to find --"
R:  To have a life partner?
L:  Yeah, life partner so ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But what about now?  Do you do things on your own or ...?
L:  Yeah.  No, now -- well, now ... yeah, I do -- I do so much but, you know, my life is -- is -- I can -- I -- I feel like my life is so much fuller now --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that -- that I have a partner and I have some -- I have a few children --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and there are things that I could never experience -- have experienced or felt, you know, emotions and other things --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that never could come if I were to not have, um, a life partner so ...
R:  But I see what you're describing though.  I think it's a pretty common feeling.  Uh, it's something that most of us don't talk about --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I think that that's pretty common and I think I felt exactly the same way.  And now, I'm not married but I'm in a long term relationship and I live with this person --
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  And I think of it and now doing things on my own, it just seemed a strange feeling, you know.  My I became a we -- 
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  -- and we do things and we do that and we do like, you know, like this and we don't like that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I just can't think of going back to that point where I just didn't have to share those things so everything was just my decision.  It just seems so odd.
L:  Right.
R:  But I think it's an asset, like you were saying, that you can do things on your own and ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and be independent to some degree because that -- I think that's always really important, but for me I think it went the other way.  You know, as time went by, I think I became more and more dependent and now I think, "So, wow, what would my life be like if I were alone"
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] It's so odd because I don't know what it would be like to be so different --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that I don't even really want to think about it. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.  I'm the same way, yeah.
R:  It's just scary.
L:  It is scary to think, you know, and life is -- is quite fragile, you know?  I mean, we ... we like to think that we are, uh, invincible and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, that act- things aren't going to happen to us, but --
R:  Right.  Those things happen always to other people but it's so true --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- you know, you never know what -- what's in store for you.
L:  Exactly.
R:  The more ready you are to deal with those things is like -- like I say, you know, we all have a bag of tricks --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and the more tricks you have in that bag, the better prepared you are to deal with life --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and sometimes it can be rather challenging, you know?
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  One day you're living one way and the following morning life change completely --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it just slapped you in the face and it's up to you now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What are you gonna do?
L:  Yeah, and I think at those points -- those kind of important junctures in your life you've -- you often ... reevaluate kind of what your priorities are as --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I mean, what -- you think, "Wow, wow.  You know what -- what have I been spending my time doing?"
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know? And, you kinda think, "Wow, maybe I shouldn't have been doing that.  I should have been focusing on things that were more important" but -- so unfortunately it takes those --
