L:  Hi, I'm Carrie.
R:  Hello, I'm Alina.
L:  Hi, um ... that's September eleventh.  I guess I've been, um ... um, more, um, keeping in touch with my family and stuff like that.  That --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- really made me -- 'cause I don't like, um, close to home so it really made me think about ... [SIGH] you know, everything that could have happened had I lived at home.
R:  Yeah.  [inaudible] --
L:  How 'bout for you?
R:  Well ... [LIPSMACK] I'm not from the States but I was -- I was actually in Canada when it happened --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and we couldn't get back into the States for a while.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh yeah?
R:  And so there was a very immediate concern right there and you know, you sort of felt at a distance.  We were in Toronto which is not so far geographically speaking, but you know, we're in a different country so ... [LIPSMACK] and then, as a foreigner in the US, it's also made a big difference because things have been tightened a lot for us.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, absolutely.
R:  So, you know, I have to report now to the INS if I ever move and, you know, you -- you ... feel more vulnerable which -- I mean, I think it's a good thing because if you were here for legitimate reasons, as I am, then there's no problem with being -- providing this information --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [inaudible] and it's the only way, or it's one way to -- to try and keep better tabs on people that come into the country so ... [LIPSMACK] but it's -- it would be in that category.  I mean, somehow I'm sort of in the category of foreigners that could be bad people so ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, do you -- I mean, have you ever -- have you ha- um, sensed any repercussions since the eleventh?  Like, have you had any, um ... any, uh, hate acts towards you or do you see -- notice anybody like looking at you differently or anything like that?
R:  No, I mean, I'm --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I'm white.  I'm from -- I'm from northern Europe --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- so, no other country, yeah, but I have friends from, uh, some of the Arab world --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and even though I mean, we're sort of in higher education all of us and people are in general very tolerant, but there's small things like I remember I went to the post office to buy some stamps and I didn't want the ones with the flag on it because I didn't feel prepared to sort of ... send that out as the message --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and -- and I remember ... the -- I sailed a little thing there and this was right after which -- which made it even more sensitive.  Like, sort of, "Well, if you don't want it, why are you here?" 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Really?
R:  It's only thing --
L:  Wow, yeah, I wouldn't even think of som- something like that but ...
R:  But I can see how it's difficult because ... if you're not a citizen, which I'm not, then it's harder to criticize --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because it's like you're not a contributing member.  I mean, I do pay taxes, but you know, I'm not a citizen, I don't have rights, I don't have representatives and so I tried to keep myself informed but I can't really ... I could -- I mean, I guess I can express myself, but I don't have -- it's -- it's -- I feel more uneasy --
L:  Right.
R:  -- than I do about it in Denmark.  I mean, in Denmark I can vote and so on and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I feel confident doing that, but not here.  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, it made me think about that.  That I would like to live in a country where I can be a citizen some day, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Where are -- wh- what are you a citizen of?  I'm sorry.
R:  Um, Denmark.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, so a very small country so even though I can vote there, it doesn't feel so ... important because I'm so far away from it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know, the -- it's -- I mean, if you live in Denmark, what happens in the US matters.  If you live in the US, what happens in Denmark doesn't really matter because of the scale, right?
L:  Huh.
R:  So, every- everybody suspected that would happen.
L:  Yeah.
R:  September eleventh.  You know, of course, my family was actually visiting here in the States.  They were in Los Angeles --
L:  Oh, they were?
R:  Yeah, they were also -- I mean, I was in Toronto and they were in Los Angeles and [LAUGH] we were trying to get together so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And it worked out.  It worked out, yeah.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  So, I'm glad they didn't cancel.  They got here on the ninth I think.
L:  Wow.
R:  And so they were very confused what to do ...
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- because you know, nobody knew whether to go ahead with the trip and so on, but they did in the end and they had a good trip.   They were on the west coast all the time so --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- it didn't feel so close to it.
L:  Yeah, actually, um, I'm in the military and --
R:  Yes?
L:  -- um ... in -- in -- that's why I'm not at home.  I'm actually from the east coast and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um ... it -- I mean, it really made me think, "Oh, my gosh, you know, I could've ..." you know, I have friends or family that live there.  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know, it was just very --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and now I have, you know, many friends that are deployed ...
R:  Yes.
L:  -- um, and just to tighten security and just -- I -- I guess I was completely taken aback.  Um, some of my friends in the military said, "Oh, you know, we definitely know, you know, that this is, you know, terrorist".  I -- I -- that was, like, the last thing on my mind.  I saw it happen on TV ...
R:  Right.
L:  -- and that was the last thing on my mind.  I thought --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that, you know ... [LIPSMACK] it was nothing like that.
R:  It's interesting because that day when I was in Toronto to stay with my partner because he's from there and my friend from when I lived in Edinburgh was flying in to visit and he's originally from Pakistan -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and she arrived that day and she was one of the last -- I mean, apparently her flight -- she came from London I think, was too far gone to recall it.
L:  Yes.
R:  And so first they were told they would -- could maybe go down in Montreal, but then they were eventually allowed to land in Toronto, and so we were there to pick her up and they had only been told on the flight that something had happened in the States which is, of course, is very unsettling thing to be told, but just since she got off the plane, she was just asking us, "What has happened?" you know and --
L:  Oh, I can't even imagine being on a plane.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, until it -- I guess it's why they didn't tell them, but they had to tell them something because they were making -- changing plans all the time about whether they were turning back or going to --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- Montreal or going to Toronto so all the passengers knew that something was up.
L:  Wow.
R:  Plus when they got to the airport there was hardly any people there and it's a big airport, so it was kinda strange.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But I remember we went back and ha- and had dinner and you know, very shortly she said, because you know, being from Pakistan she knows the politics of that area, and she said, this is -- she said, "Osama Bin Laden.  This is what's gonna happen.  This is what the, you know, first hypothesis is going to be and this is what Pakistan's role is gonna be in it" --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I remember thinking, "Hey, wait a minute.  Let's see what happens" but she was right on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about all of it.  So, that was very ... strange thing because sh- I mean ... she comes from a very different background and she knows the whole ties between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Moslem link and everything and even though she's -- I mean, she's lived all her life in -- in Scotland but she has that insight into it and she --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- made a very clear analysis on the first day.
L:  Wow.
R:  So ... I mean she was --
L:  And --
R:  She was certainly shocked by what had happened but somehow, you know, she also had this sort of I guess, political --
L:  Oh, that's -- and same with -- and some of -- same with some of my peers.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, they knew instantly --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I ... um, and I actually deal with, um, aircraft in a certain way and I just thought, you know, it was a mistake in that an aircraft control measure.  I don't know, it was just a very -- very odd.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who alerted you to it?  Were you actually watching TV --
L:  I was actually watching TV --
R:  -- when it came on?
L:  -- and saw the airplanes hit -- both of them -- and still I continued on my day because I thought it was, um, [LIPSMACK] I thought it was a mistake, like an air- air- airspace control measures.
R:  Right.
L:  Like, there're certain, um ... pathways that you must follow and certain heights --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I thought that somebody misread them, put them in the planes wrong --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- and they were flying at too low of an altitude.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it wasn't until, um, the Pentagon got hit and then of course it was, like, "Oh, my gosh".
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know, pure pani- --
R:  That was very different for us because we were told, kind of, in the country we were told somebody's attacking New York.  I think that was how it was put to us.
L:  Wow!
R:  I was sitting on the computer -- it was crazy, I was doing -- I mean, I'm in academia and I was doing something to do with a conference, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- submitting an aspect or something totally abstract from everything else.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the people we were staying with come up and said, you know, "Bad stuff is happening in New York.  They're -- they're attacking New York" and you know, we rushed downstairs to the TV ... [LIPSMACK] so I definitely came into it with that feeling that -- that it was a malicious attack, yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Wow.  See, yeah.  How 'bout -- is there anything else besides, um, having a more stricter control?  Um, I guess, is it -- are you on a visa?  Are you on work visa?  Is that --
R:  I'm on a student visa so it hasn't affected that.  I mean, it could affect my chance of staying here.
L:  Ah.
R:  It's not clear yet and there's been some ... I'm in California and, uh, one of our senators proposed a kind of tracking system for us.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But it hasn't been approved and I don't think there's much, I mean, likelihood of that.
L:  Huh.
R:  But it's kind of a way of tracking us.  You know, you have to report every --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so often and so on.  I mean, it ... it made me, of course, think about ... [LIPSMACK] I mean, it is kind of easy to get into the United States.  That's true.  I mean, if you get --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- accepted to a school, all the paperwork --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- runs smoothly and, you know, when I come int- if I go away and I come back into the country, I present my paperwork from the school and it -- it's fine.
L:  Right.
R:  But, uh -- but as I said, I mean, you know, being white and being -- sort of looking middle class, I never have any problems but I think a lot of it -- I mean, there's that kind of profiling that I think is even worse now, based on how you look.
L:  Well, actually -- and it's funny that you say that because -- and I -- I certain- I'm -- I'm absolutely certain that there is profiling going on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and to tell you the truth, a week after it happened, I was very nervous and -- but every time I go to the airport, and I am a ... female -- I'm a Caucasian female --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in the military, I always present my military ID --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I always get searched.  Always!
R:  [COUGH]
L:  So, I don't know if they're necessarily doing profiling --
R:  No.
L:  -- as far as like the passengers that get on the planes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but yeah, I do -- I do think that people, um, definitely are looking ...
R:  One of the few sort of positive things I remember, or you know, uplifting things was, you know, how everybody else -- the chaos that there was afterwards, like [MN] you know how flights were cancelled for getting back into the States and you have to -- they did these emergency things because the airline we were flying with didn't have an office in Toronto, I think, so they set it up at some hotel and you just had to go and line up and we were there for hours --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and hours for us.  And there was no -- it wasn't clear when ... we were gonna get to talk to anybody but people were just ... so respectful and you just waited in line and I think they gave us some donuts or something, you know, but this ... amazing [LIPSMACK] respectfulness and politeness and, you know, letting people that were there with kids or elderly people go in front, and everybody had this ... [SIGH] it just felt --
L:  Humanity?
R:  Exactly!  It just came out in a way that, you know -- particularly in airports, you don't see it and people waiting in line --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they go through the worst thing is to try and, you know, jump the line or something and --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- that felt kind of special in the middle of it.  I think it's gone now.  I haven't flown much since then, but [LAUGH] I think it's probably gone now.
L:  Isn't that what they were saying about in the streets of New York also?  Before and -- my sister used to live there so when I would visit --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- n- you couldn't look at anybody in the eye.  You never spoke to anybody you didn't know.
R:  Right, right.
L:  But that, you know, month or definitely the days following it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- everybody was talking to everybody else.  Everybody was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- helping somebody else.
R:  Yeah.  When something big happens, yeah.  It's -- I actually did -- I went to New York for the first time in October two thousand and one so that was very weird.
L:  Oh wow!
R:  [inaudible] in a way it wasn't.  I was going for a conference and it had been planned for a long time and the conference organizers decided to go ahead with it on that -- I forget whether it was the mayor that came out and said, you know, "Try and do business as usual".
L:  Yeah.
R:  "Don't cancel things.  Try and keep things going" and so they did and ... [MN] since I never had been to New York before I didn't have anything to compare with.
L:  Uh.
R:  But my -- my colleague that I went with actually lived there 'cause he went to NYU and so he was sort of feeling that things were different, whereas I wasn't really.  So, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  And that -- my family was very worried about me going there, you know, that -- 
L:  I can only imagine.
R:  Yeah, but I just ... I didn't feel scared of going there and I fe- you know, I guess in that sort of, you know, try and ... make things happen; don't -- don't ... let New York down or don't withdraw or whatever, you know, whatever little thing you can do to make things go back to normal, but ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  [MN] So, I think we did all the normal things.  Like he showed me the ... part of the city that he knew and liked the best and we went to the theatre and went to Central Park and all those ... all those things, and I guess NYU is close to th- it's in the Village so it's -- you know, it's on fourth street or something?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ... we were down there but didn't ... I didn't see or feel anything directly from it.  Like, any smell or anything like that.
L:  Wow.
R:  Have you been back there since?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I have not actually.  Um, I was thinking about going back on New Year --
