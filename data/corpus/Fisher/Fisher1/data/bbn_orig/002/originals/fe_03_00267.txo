L:  Hi, my name is, uh, Levan Lou.  I'm, uh, here in Washington DC.  I'm a journalist here.
R:  Ah, hello, my name is Mary Tafford[?].  I'm in Syracuse, New York.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I used to, uh ... live in New York City.
R:  Oh, yeah, that's pretty far away from here.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Which means, you're probably a lot closer to the, uh, to the September eleventh that they're talking about than I was.
L:  Uh, but I left New York City for Washington DC in nineteen ninety nine, so was, um [LIPSMACK] before the September eleventh.  But, um [MN] you wanted to begin first?
R:  Excuse me?
L:  I mean, do you want to ... um [LIPSMACK] talk about the, uh, the changes that September eleventh has made to your life --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or do you want to start first or ...?
R:  Um, sure.  I -- I -- I honestly don't know that it's made any ... changes to my life in terms of, you know, routine in terms of, like, what I do.  Uh, well ... okay, actually ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I have to step back -- I have to step back from it for a minute.  [MN] For me as an individual ... um, separate from society, um, it hasn't -- I don't think it's really made that many changes although I must admit I'm probably a little -- a little more hesitant about plane travel than I used to be.  Um, but it has made a bit difference in my work.
L:  Oh, how?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like, what do you do?
R:  [LAUGH] Uh, I'm a graduate student, um ... yeah, working with natural language processing, um, and some of the clients that we sup- support, are the intelligence agencies.
L:  Right.  Oh, so I can imagine Arabic --
R:  [LAUGH] Ye- ye- well, actually, tha- tha- that topic has come up but -- but more than anything else, wha- what we were being asked to do right now is look at data and process data and come up with things like names of terrorists and stuff like that.
L:  Oh, wow.  Wow.
R:  And try to find connections between, you know, different -- different people ... um, and [LIPSMACK] different gr- you know, like terrorist groups and -- and members of terrorist groups.  And, I mean, I -- I'm -- I'm not actually ... you know, working on that directly myself but the people around me, you know, some of them have been involved in -- in processing documents for that very purpose.
L:  Hm.
R:  So, it -- it has affected me in that way.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Um, I guess, I -- I, uh ... I kind of -- I agree, uh, with you ... that, um [LIPSMACK] uh, individually speaking I -- other than ... traveling ... um, I -- there isn't really much change since September eleventh.  Of course, um ... [LIPSMACK] it has some -- I mean, I guess, uh ... made some changes to my work.  I'm working for the, uh ... [SIGH] uh, a government broadcasting agency.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, so I mean, it's -- I mean, it's not really directly change to my work.  I still pretty much do the same thing because, um ... [LIPSMACK] yeah, it's just I have to still broadcast and write stories about what is going on.  It's always so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- assume -- I originally -- you might not know, I originally came from China so a lot of, uh, my reports are related with China.  
R:  Mm.
L:  But, um, to the agency that I'm working with, um ... has changed a lot.  Like, we have established new ... uh, uh, like Middle Eastern radio network which is total new.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um ...
R:  Yeah, so -- so you get -- you get like different sources of news --
L:  Exactly, so the resources --
R:  -- now than you used to?
L:  -- and, uh, botches, kind of ... you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- go to different places now so ... so in that sense, it's different, yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, kind of similar to your situation I guess.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, sorry, it's -- it's had a more or less direct impact on my work and certainly the amount of work ... or certainly the amount of government funding available for the kind of work that I do.  Um, [LIPSMACK] but all -- you know, for me as an individual, as a person ... [SIGH] uh, I think it -- I think it's had less of an impact, however, um [LAUGH] I do have a fifteen year old son, uh, and I recently heard that they, um -- that the military -- no, let -- let me back up.  That high schools have started supplying military with names, addresses and, like, phone numbers of high school students to remind them to, like, sign up for selective service and, you know, I hope it doesn't come down to, you know ... service isn't selective any more.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Wow, hm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I certainly wouldn't -- wouldn't wanna have to deal with that.
L:  Right, um ... [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] most of thinking ... [SIGH] personally, um [LIPSMACK] or it might have changed.  Well, recently there have been -- like, lately, uh, the Bush, uh ... administration is talking about, um [LIPSMACK] uh ... um, giving the, uh, smallpox vaccinations --
R:  Oh, right, to the -- the military?
L:  -- to -- to the people on -- to the military, to the -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to those selective, uh ...
R:  Yeah, my husband thinks that's an absolutely ludicrous idea.
L:  You think?  Um ...
R:  Yeah, yeah.  My husband, um ... uh, has training as a microbiologist and an immunologist ... and he says that, um [SIGH] [LIPSMACK], I guess the smallpox vaccine has a certain failure rate ...
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  So, [LAUGH] and it's like, you know, why would you want to purposefully ... you know, uh, weaken your forces now?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's, um ... yesterday, I think, um, the Sixty Minutes, they did a rather long story on this, uh, about the dangers of having this vaccination versus the -- the benefits of having it so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I -- I -- its personal concern for me is that, um, you know, I have a ... almost two year old son.  He's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- living now in China.
R:  Ah.
L:  Um, but he has eczema an- and the story from Sixty Minutes says that, um, for people who -- with skin conditions, is like eczema and there was approximate women shouldn't, um, get the vaccination at all.  And I was thinking, you know, it's kind of -- I mean, kind of, uh, complicated.  I mean, I was thinking about a post September eleventh environment.  Uh, do you have ... you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- do you have more worries and concerns about what might happen, uh, you know, uh, to me, to the people [inaudible] and to my family members.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, now, um, were you ... now, living -- living in DC you -- you obviously must be ... you know, in the environment of, like, the Pentagon?
L:  Exactly, you know -- 
R:  Or --
L:  -- uh, absolutely.  We -- the place I live in is pretty close to both the Pentagon and to Capitol Hill.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's like kind of in between, uh, you know, so my husband who -- who commutes, like, every week [several inaudible words] he's, uh, working at, uh, University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia so he comes here to DC to visit me every weekend and ... immediately after Sept- September eleventh, he always had this, [LIPSMACK] you know, fear.  I -- I wouldn't say --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- probably it's not even a fear.  It's like, um [LIPSMACK] um, kind of -- it's not a sen- I don't know how you would call it.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's -- it's --
L:  It's like he --
R:  It's something -- something -- something --
L:  What kind of outlook imagination.
R:  Something important and worrisome but maybe slightly less ... bothersome than what you would really call a fear.
L:  Um, he --
R:  Just some --
L:  Like he would- he, like, in his mind there would -- you know, there would appear inside a kind of scenario that, uh, the Washington DC area has been, uh, attacked, either by nuclear weapons or by biological or chemical weapons so he kind -- you know ... he had that kind of, um, real, kind of, uh, imaginative picture --
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  You know?  It's like ... uh, for a moment we were talking about -- oh, maybe I really shouldn't work in the Washington DC area -- lived here, you know.  It's just too close and you never know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um ...
R:  Now, do, um -- did the closing of the Washington airport, did that make it hard for you to -- to travel?  I mean ...
L:  Uh --
R:  I don't -- I don't know if a broadcast journalist travels in the work that they do.  [LAUGH]
L:  We -- we do travel, um ... but last time I had to travel to New York city to cover something, and I chose, um ... Amtrak.  I -- I -- even though ... Amtrak is much more expensive than --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, going by plane.
R:  And it takes a lot longer.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but ... yeah, a lot longer, but -- but I just feel more comfortable, um, with the, uh -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, then the area -- Regan National Airport was closed for a while but then reopened, uh ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, so, I guess -- I mean, at that time, I'm sure it has affected a lot of people with -- with regard to the schedules and their, you know.  But -- but, um, I think now it's not a problem.
R:  Have they -- have they changed any of the, like, entrance procedures of the building you work in?
L:  Oh, sure, yeah.  Now, we have, um ... I guess all the government agencies have, uh, this kind of, um, [LIPSMACK] screening xray, the metal detectors, you know, that we're definitely -- definitely seeing more, um, security people in -- in and around the building.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and ... since our office building is just like one block away from the Capitol Hill, and, uh, we can see from those -- the crossroads near the congressional buildings there -- I think it's permanent, but that you have a police car and some policemen --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- stationed there, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all day long.  I don't know about night, but, uh ... so the security --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- has definitely, uh ... heightened.
R:  Well, that's -- that's definitely an effect on  your daily life even though you may not ... [LAUGH]
L:  Um --
R:  -- may not think of it in that light.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, wow, exactly.  And, yeah, you can say that maybe it's -- it's a change, um, but, uh, on the other side -- on the other hand, uh, doesn't really, um ... affect my routine because I still, like, I -- I would still go to the places and, uh --
R:  Yeah, just might take a little longer.
L:  -- I could see those people there.  Uh, no, it doesn't, uh, really.
R:  It doesn't take longer?
L:  No.  They just -- they're just stationed there, like, ah, stay at a corner, uh -- I guess some roads are -- are closed because of that, but it doesn't affect -- directly affect me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, it's not, um, you know, um ... [LIPSMACK] um, on my way of -- to -- to somewhere, I guess.
R:  Mm.
L:  It's not like the, uh, thoroughfare like the really, uh, heavily tra- traveled, uh, roads, but some ... you know, back roads or, you know, places like that so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I mean, it -- it is a change, uh ... uh, but not much of a -- of, you know ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, effect ... on my daily life.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... have you traveled to New York City after September eleventh?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, New York City is not typically a place that I would travel to.  [LAUGH]
L:  Why not?
R:  Um, uh, well, it -- it's funny 'cause I -- uh, the -- the very -- or not -- not the first time, but one of the few times that I've ever been to New -- New York City, was in two thousand one in ... like, April, something like that.  Right around Passover --
