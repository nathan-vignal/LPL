L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  Good.  What's your favorite holiday? [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Well, I have to say right now, being that it's the season that it is, [LAUGH] Christmas.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  You know what I mean?  I mean --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- how can you not say that right now?
R:  I know.  I know.  And everyone's in the Christmas spirit.
L:  I know.  I mean, I -- like, we -- I mean, I'm in my second year of college, and last year we totally didn't do this 'cause I only had one roommate and she definitely wasn't Christian, [LAUGH] but this year --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, all my roommates and I, we got a tree, we got fake pine scent to spray into the air. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's so fun. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know. [LAUGH]
R:  That's really --
L:  But --
R:  -- fun that you have a tree while you're in college 'cause --
L:  I know.  It's really weird. [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm actually --
L:  Basically, one of my roommates had one.
R:  Yeah, it's nice.  Yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I -- I actually -- I'm a second year grad student and so I'm also moving away from home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we've been discussing whether my roommates and I are going to get a tree and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't think we really are, but it would be fun if we did. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  My roommate, like, had -- it's fake.  She had one and I was, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  "Okay, well, put it up" [LAUGH].
R:  Well, that works.  That's perfect then. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Um --
R:  I think -- I think Christmas is probably my favorite holiday just in general anyway, I think.  Um, yeah, you get together with lots of different people and, you know, it seems like it's just a really -- just a really nice time.
L:  Yeah, I -- I, um, definitely really like Christmas because, I mean, I know all of the commercialized things have --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, happened and made it very commercialized, all that stuff, but, ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it really [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- all the carols and just seeing people being happy.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  And in a giving mood.
R:  It's true.  People do -- they are in so much of a giving mood this time of year.  Like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- some of my friends and I, we did this thing called Operation Christmas Child.
L:  Mm.
R:  I don't know if you've ever heard of that, but you make boxes and you put all kinds of little toys and little candies in there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then you ma- -- they mail them to, um, kids in Third World countries who don't even really have anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it is, like, you know -- 'cause normally we don't take the time to do that sort of thing, you know?  I mean, it's alw- always good to do that, but you don't even necessarily think about it unless --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, someone reminds you.  And when you get close to Christmas, you know, you're like, "Oh, I ..."  People are, they're much more giving, I think.
L:  Yeah.  Like, I just always remember [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when I was in church when I -- like, in Sunday School and stuff.
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  Um, they'd give us, instead of, like, you know, the Advent calendars with the chocolate in and stuff?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They'd give us -- they'd give us ones at church that were, like, you put a quarter in for every day --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then you'd hand them in on Christmas Eve, you know.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um, and you'd -- they'd give them to, uh, some charity.  It was one -- one specific charity.  I can't remember which.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, I remember just around Christmas I'd be so excited and every day I'd, like, try and find a quarter or, like, find one in my change box and always wanna put it in. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  So, it was just like even then I just wanted to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, do stuff like that.  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was like, "Wow, I'm gonna -- with a quarter I can make all this money with this one sheet and all these days" --
R:  I know.
L:  "And give it to people". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's funny. [LAUGH] Well, I remember -- I can't remember was it for Christmas or I think this one might be for Easter, but we used to get, like, the rice bowls at my church that you would take home and the same type of thing, like, you would put your dimes and your quarters in there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you felt like you were helping so much, and I think that they even had statistics on the side, like [MN] one dollar --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- will feed a family of four for a month or, you know, something ridiculous, and you're like, "How is that possible?"
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  That, you know, my spare change can really do all -- so much for someone.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Anyway ...
L:  Um, I don't know.  I always liked also before, like, Thanksgiving [LAUGH] because, um, [LIPSMACK] they l- -- because it -- I don't know, it's always -- it always seems like you can get together with, like -- I mean, get together with my family and then friends.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we, um, we always -- and but since there's no gifts and no pressure to get gifts, it's always --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a different kind of spirit, too.
R:  Yes.
L:  And then it leads into the Christmas spirit. [LIPSMACK]
R:  That's true.
L:  That's -- that's cool, too. [LAUGH]
R:  That is nice.  It's nice --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Yeah, 'cause there's not so much pressure.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, with Christmas it just gets crazy.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] It's a different type of thing. [LAUGH]
R:  It is, it is, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And Christmas lasts so long.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It seems like every year the celebrations start earlier.
L:  Yes.
R:  And, like, I just had a Christmas party last week, I think, and we still have, what, almost a month before Christmas, three weeks at least?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, yeah, people are crazy like that. [LIPSMACK] And then, of course, it sometimes is touchy because, like you were saying, not everyone is Christian and so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you can't always say that it's a Christmas party.  It might have to be a holiday party or something like that, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And that is something that's nice at Thanksgiving, is that you can put, like -- you know everyone is going to be celebrating Thanksgiving in --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in this country.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And, I mean, even if -- like, my -- my, um, parents aren't from this country and, like, and the reason we visit, um, our family and friends every year is because, like, all my relatives live in England and all theirs do, too, and it's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- just a different kind of family and it's, um --
R:  Right.
L:  And even if you're not from here originally, you can get into the spirit because it's giving thanks --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- or getting together and just, you know, using --
R:  [MN] Absolutely.
L:  -- like, giving thanks for what you've got and stuff like that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  One of my roommates is, uh, from Canada.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they have Thanksgiving also, but they do it in October.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A- and I really think it's kinda funny because they don't really have a -- the story, like, with the Pilgrims and everything.  I mean, I -- I guess that's why they started celebrating Thanksgiving.  It's probably the same reason that we do, but it's just different because we put a lot of emphasis, I think, on the history behind it and everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And she doesn't even really know the history behind Canadian Thanksgiving, you know, it's just kind of a nice time to give thanks and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, eat turkey and, [LAUGH] you know, that type of thing.  So, it is kinda nice because even if you don't have the actual history you can still -- everyone can give thanks, you know.  That's something that's very [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, it's -- that's very true.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yes.
L:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK]
R:  So, if you could invent a new holiday, what holiday would you invent?
L:  Um, [SIGH] I don't know.  It's hard.  I mean ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think it would be more along the lines of a Thanksgiving holiday --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as opposed to a -- a let's get presents for everyone we know and do something like that.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But I'm not sure what I would call it or anything. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Mm.  Maybe it could be some time other than the winter.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because it seems like in the winter there's so many holidays.
L:  Yes.
R:  I mean, you know, you have Christmas, which is huge, and then Thanksgiving, which is so close to Christmas.
L:  Yeah, it's true.  I think maybe a spring holiday because I -- I -- there's stuff like, uh, what is there?  May Day and stuff like that for, like, the celebration of spring.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But to me spring's really nice, and it would be nice to celebrate it coming along, you know.
R:  That's true.  That's true.
L:  So ...
R:  'Cause there's Easter, but then once again not everybody celebrates Easter.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And it varies, too, depending on, you know, what year it is.  Sometimes it's so early --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- that it's snowing on Easter. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Depending on where you are, I guess, but ...
L:  And depending on which, uh, if you -- [MN] which kind of, like, Christianity you pr- practice, too, if you do.
R:  Right.
L:  Pick different Easters. [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.  That's true.  I've never actually met anyone who -- I -- I -- is it, like, the Greek Orthodox or something?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where they celebrate it on a different day.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, yeah, that could be -- that could get complicated. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, actually, um, my, uh, dad works with a couple of people who are, I think, Greek Orthodox, and so they kinda want Easter time off at a different time sometimes, and stuff like that.
R:  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, I feel sorry for people like that, yeah.
L:  Different.
R:  -- Or like people who are Jewish and then in September with Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, that's always when classes are s- -- just getting going and, yeah, you're really getting into the mainstream, you know, you might have tests and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But -- and, you know, there's no holiday for Christians anymore around there.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, so it's -- I think it's probably really hard on them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if they're away from their families and they can't celebrate and that sort of thing.
L:  Yeah.  Actually, I -- I remember in, um, [MN] when I was in elementary school, my --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- when I was in third grade, they actually started, um [MN] -- we were k- -- we have a som- -- medium Jewish population in my town, so they started giving us Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur off.
R:  Oh.
L:  And it was really interesting.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I -- I had always known about Hanukkah --
R:  Right.
L:  But I'd -- but I'd never known that that was kind of secondary in that these two holidays were much more important.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, kind of when they started giving them off, it was something that, um, I realized and that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I saw, but -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that was just one of my [LAUGH] ...
R:  Yeah.  Well, whenever, um -- the school where I went to undergrad, there were also quite a few Jewish people, and we didn't get class off on those days, but there was a rule that, um, professors couldn't give tests on those days.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So that that way if people did wanna leave or go home or, say, go celebrate somewhere, you know, at least they wouldn't be missing a test.  They could just, you know, get the notes from someone or whatever, which I thought that was a really reasonable rule because then, you know, it doesn't shut down the whole campus for just a few people.
L:  Right.
R:  But at the same time, you know, if you wanna leave --
L:  It --
R:  -- it's totally not a problem at all.
L:  Yeah, it's -- as long as they respect, like, the holidays that are important, I think it's -- that's a good thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think we -- I think -- I don't know if we can't give tests, if professors can't give tests, but I know they're definitely excused absences --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if that's the case, if that matters, or if, you know, stuff like that.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Mm. [NOISE]
R:  It was kinda funny for me this past year around Easter because, um, [LIPSMACK] we- -- I guess at -- I guess at my college there were a lot of -- they were very considerate of people's religions or something because we got the Jewish holidays where you wouldn't necessarily have to take tests, and then for -- we also got Good Friday off, right before Easter, and I think we even got Holy Thursday off.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, so that was really, really great, so everyone would always just go home for Easter or whatever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then now, um, I'm at a different school and we don't get any time off at all for Easter.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I remember I had class, like, on Good Friday, and I was thinking, you know, "I really don't wanna go to class".  Like, I -- and I'm sure I probably could've gotten out of it and it probably wouldn't have been a big deal at all, but I ended up going after all just 'cause, you know, it's kind of a pain if you have to miss and especially that late in the semester.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would've gotten behind.  It was a math class, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, it was kinda difficult, but, like, it almost made --
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  Yeah, it almost made me feel like, you know, 'cause normally Christians are not the ones in that position.  You know, usually it's like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a Jewish person or someone more a minority.
L:  Yeah.  I -- last year actually we, um, didn't officially get Good Friday off and [SIGH] -- but it just so happened that it was our spring break.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but this year I don't think we get it off, and it's really weird.  I mean, I've never had school in my life on Good Friday.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've always gone to at least a service on Thursday night or Friday --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- day --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's really weird.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not that you can't do that, but, yeah --
R:  It's different, though.
L:  -- it's -- it's interesting, I mean, 'cause usually, as you said, we're not -- uh, Christians are not, like, in that position, and it's a taste of a different thing. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  It really is.  It's funny how that works.
L:  Yeah.  But ...
R:  [LIPSMACK] When I went --
L:  I mean, and then there's other holidays.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like --
