R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, I'm Theresa.
R:  Uh, I'm Yang.  Nice to meet you.  [LAUGH] So, did you -- did you get a topic of today?
L:  Yes, it's the changes we've made in our lives since nine eleven.
R:  Okay, okay.  Ca- ca- can I have the name again?  [LAUGH]  I'm sorry.
L:  Theresa.
R:  Theresa?  Okay [LAUGH].  My name's Y-A-N-G, Yang.  I'm a Chinese student.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH] So, so do you think that your life has been -- has been ... to some extent changed since nine one one event?
L:  Yes.  Actually I can say that it has [PAUSE] -- dramatically.
R:  Oh, in dramatic way?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  So -- yeah, so why is that?  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, because I had -- I had a business ...
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- and ... and since nine eleven, I have lost many customers because they were out of New York city.
R:  Oh, oh, because they just -- they -- because of the event, they -- they changed their address or they just ... they just ... gone away?
L:  They -- they reduced their business --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and there was a -- a period that it was difficult to -- to communicate with them.
R:  Oh, yeah, right, right, so ... do -- oh, so th- th- that's why your life has been, you know, specifically, you know, influenced by -- by nine one one?
L:  It -- definitely because I -- I was a graphic designer and ...
R:  Really?  Wow.
L:  -- they -- it's really reduced my business to the point that I decided to go back to school.
R:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I changed careers.
R:  Oh, that's so dramatic change because of nine one one.
L:  Definitely.
R:  Oh.  Do you think that if you haven't -- you hadn't, uh, been having a business or you were a student in time of nine one one event, do you think that your life is still going to be changed a lot, because of event?
L:  I don't know if it would be that dramatic of a change, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm sure in some way it would be affected, only because I lived in New York --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I was very familiar with the surroundings.
R:  Oh.
L:  When I went to visit, it was very sad and that's -- that really triggers memories.
R:  Mm.  Do you think that this kind of effect will have a long lasting, you know ... where, you know, this event ... you know, obviously it has already influenced your life, your career, but do you think this effect is going to last, you know, for the coming many years or it's just a temporary effect?
L:  I think -- I think over time ... it'll be reduced.
R:  Right, right.
L:  'Cause I think that's how memory works.  You kinda forget the bad stuff.
R:  Right.  So, may- maybe, I think those people who like New York, maybe most of them or at least some of them has -- have already, you know, gone back to New York city so [LAUGH] you can pick up your own -- own business.  [LAUGH]
L: [LAUGH] Thanks. [LAUGH] 
R:  Sometime you just do about your business when you are a student, right?
L:  I do actually.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I do.  Fortunately because I don't have a whole lot of time to work and it's really great to be able to work out of my own house.
R:  So, who, uh -- basically, who are your customers?  Are they, uh, companies or groups or organizations or just individuals or --
L:  I -- I -- I have found that, oddly enough, most of my clients' a- a- are non profit organizations.
R:  Oh, wow.  That's great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] But are you still stud- studying, mm, graphic design right now?
L:  No, no.  I've actually ... that was my first degree.  Um, that was, like, fifteen years ago.  I'm now --
R:  Right.
L:  -- studying nursing.
R:  Wow.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Cha- you -- you made a very, you know, different division.  [LAUGH]
L:  The other side of the brain.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, do you think it's there.  Actually, actually, I'm an international student so for me, obviously when -- when nine one one happened, it does have -- it did have a big influence of -- of ... you know, on me, and also of my fellow students here because I -- I still remember very clearly that on that specific morning, one of my classmates, she was late for class.  We had a very early class at nine o'clock and then she came pretty late and the first sentence she said is, "Oh, my God.  Do you already know what happened?" [LAUGH] and, uh, everyone --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- including the professor, we did know about the event yet so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it was really interesting.
R:  Such a big shock.
L:  I was -- I was working at this one job and I was listening to the radio on the way in and I think I pretty much just parked in the parking lot when they announced that --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- there -- something happened.  And ...
R:  Yeah.  Were you in the city?
L:  I was, um ... no, I was in the suburbs.  
R:  Oh.
L:  I was in Philadelphia but in the suburbs.
R:  Oh.
L:  And then, um, strangely enough, the boss that I was working for, just remained oblivious to the whole fact and we're listening to the radio ... in horror.
R:  Right.
L:  And he ig- he ignored the entire situation and made us work all day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was very bizarre.
R:  Right and, uh ... I remember that school had -- had been cancelled for two days in our [inaudible].
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, and, uh, there are many students -- there were many students who went for -- for some -- some walk out ... you know, and we --
L:  Oh, I'm sure.
R:  -- had -- we did have a sleepless night.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and a lot of -- I had a lot of my friends live up in New York so for days afterwards I heard all sorts of horror stories.
R:  Yeah.
L:  A friend of mine lived in New Jersey and he ran down to the river and basically watched the towers collapsed.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Even -- yeah, right.  Even though many students they do not have any relatives or family members who -- it's likely, you know, they influenced the [inaudible] event, but I can see that every -- everyone is very sad, particularly during --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- those days.
L:  Yes.  Yeah, and then when I went to visit ... um, I think it was about two months after it happened, it was very somber in the area.  I- it was just very heavy energy and everyone was really quiet --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and standing around --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but you could just feel the thickness in the air.  It was unbelievable.
R:  Right, right.  Is any of your friends or relatives, you know, who was in- injured by the -- by the --
L:  No, fortunately not.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I actually heard of one person that I sort of knew, an acquaintant who had died, but I -- it wasn't confirmed and, um, mostly otherwise it was just second hand stories.
R:  Okay, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so fortunately, I didn't lose anyone personally.
R:  Yeah, but your career has been directly, you know, changed or influenced by this event?
L:  Definitely, definitely.
R:  So, do you think that your -- how ... but [LAUGH] it's -- you actually you made a very quick decision, right?
L:  I did.
R:  So ... I -- I -- you had a -- a company of your own, right?  So you --
L:  I did.
R:  -- you was not -- you were not working for some other people, so that's why --
L:  No.
R:  -- you -- you have a --
L:  Right.
R:  You made a very quick response.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, 'cause I didn't -- I just didn't want to be struggling moving forward and so I figured that I needed to make a change that was very balanced and steady and something that I've always been interested in.
R:  Yeah, but actually I'm kinda wondering that why do a considerable number of people who moved out of New York city just because of the event, because -- I think they -- they can ... they are, you know -- maybe they are worr- worrying about it, there's going to be another bombing or ... because I just cannot see the reason why they should move away immediately after the event.
L:  It -- the event may have just acted as a catalyst to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- pr- -- you know, to promote people to start thinking.  It's -- I just know from my own personal experience.  I'm from Philadelphia and I moved to New York after I graduated.  I had a career --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- there and a lot of my -- it seems like the population in New York goes through cycles.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, a lot of my friends actually had moved away from the city and I had been there for a long period of time that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you just basically get your fill and then you leave, so it's not --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- necessarily that they -- the -- the event may have promoted the decision ...
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  -- or -- or -- or sped it up.
R:  Okay --
L:  That would be my opinion.
R:  Okay, okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, and, um, actually because, uh, I -- I think I see that my fellow students -- my fellow American fe- fellow students -- they, uh -- they were very united during those days.  I think this is a critical time where something happened where some tragedy happened that they knew have a -- you know, have a strong -- very strong feeling that it -- it kind of make -- make you fear that you are American at this time, right?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  It was like everybody on my block all went out and bought flags and you couldn't even buy them because they were all sold out in the stores.  It really promoted --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- a patriotic feeling.
R:  Yeah.  I'm an international student but I still feel very sad at that time because I -- because I can see that I -- I'm living on campus so I see that most of the local people are very friendly and nice and most of my -- all of my, you know, fellow students, they are so, so lovely people.  So, I don't really want to see their lives or -- or their relatives, their friends lives be influenced by such a tragedy, so I also feel very sad about this event so --
L:  Yeah, you bring up a good point.  It's like as much as I'm affected in a negative way, I'm also affected --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in a positive way --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because it does force you to open up to people ...
R:  Right.
L:  -- to be kinder, to realize the person next to you is just a person and --
R:  Right.  Yes, exactly, you know.  Pers- a person is just a person.  They are human beings so they have their ... you know, love and sadness and everything, you know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Mm [LIPSMACK] like ... [LAUGH] I think, because I saw some reports, um, in newspapers in China, I think -- actually I called my friend in China because they were very concerned about how I feel at that time --
L:  Oh, I'm sure.
R:  -- and I told them ... I -- I told them that actually I feel very sad, uh, because if I -- if I was there, you know, in China, then I may be out of play because I really do not have the, you know, personal feeling.  I do not con- have a interaction with local people; with American ... with American friend or -- so maybe I will feel kind of, you know -- you know, indifferent because I do not have the personal contact with -- with American friends so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but since I'm here I do have lots of American friends so I feel very sad about this.  So, that's really different, I think. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yes.  Yeah, it's interesting to see your perspective, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] So, um, actually are you -- are you -- which university are you in right now?  [LAUGH]
L:  University of Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, wow.  That's a great university.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You're not living in New York city any more?
L:  No.
R:  I just -- are you thinking of moving back?
