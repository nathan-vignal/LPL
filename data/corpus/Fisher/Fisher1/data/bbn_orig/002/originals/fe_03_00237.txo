R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name is Amy.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I'm Yaelle.
L:  [LIPSMACK] That's an unusual name.
R:  [LAUGH] It's Hebrew.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, good.
R:  [SIGH] Um [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] so ...
L:  We're supposed to talk about life partners.
R:  Yes.  Yes, that's kinda scary.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's -- or should -- I -- I have one so I'm not ... [LAUGH]
R:  I'm twenty years old --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and not really where I'm at.  [LAUGH] But, all right, so ... what do you think is the most important thing to look for?
L:  They need to be your best friend.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.  Yeah, that sounds good to me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um ... I don't really know.  I mean, um ... I'm still in collage, um ... and I have a boyfriend but we've been together, like, six months.  I'm not even, like ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- considering getting like married any time soon.  But, um [LIPSMACK] I actually have a cousin who got married [LIPSMACK] um, just in October.  He's twenty one and I think he's crazy ... but, um, they're real, real religious and ... [MN] so I like -- I kinda talked to my boyfriend about it and ... I think you just gotta be with someone you can talk to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know?
L:  Right.  That's -- that's the key, 'cause if you'd al- care -- tell them when you're angry or sad or scared, um ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then all of those feelings stay bottled up inside and that's when ... hurt feelings come around.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.  I mean, like I said, that's really like ... far off for me right now.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I hope ... but, um --
L:  But that's good.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I know, I mean I need to figure myself out first before I know ... who I'm gonna be happy with for the rest of my life, you know?
L:  [LIPSMACK] And I have to say I thought that too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  At -- when I was your age exactly.  I had decided that pretty much I -- certainly didn't, um -- 'cause lots of prob- friends which I don't know if you -- if the two of you know that it's like you get in your upper years of college and you're supposed to have -- have found, you know, the man of dreams ...
R:  I know!
L:  -- um [LAUGH] and I hadn't at that point, and, um ... so if you don't -- I don't need to.  I need to just be me and find out what I want and where I'm going --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um ... and then about six months later I met my ... future husband so, uh --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- you know, you never know what life throws you.
R:  This -- how long -- how long were you together before you decided to get married?
L:  Um, actually about eight months.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, and it was just -- and we were both young but we -- it was -- it was right and it has been right for fifteen years now.
R:  Wow.
L:  So ...
R:  That's nice.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It worked!
R:  Yeah, apparently.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Apparently.  I just --
L:  But it wasn't -- I wasn't lookin' and maybe --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's why ... we found each other 'cause neither one of us was.
R:  I don't think you ca- it's not like something you're gonna go out shopping for, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like ... you just kinda ...
L:  But I think that's how some people approach it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, like I said, I mean, I know my cousin just got married and they-- they're very, very religious [LIPSMACK] so, um ... he -- any -- every -- but my mother because he's ... on my mother's side of the family he's the oldest grandchild and I'm second.  So, everyone was asking my mother, "Oh, so you're daughter's next."
L:  So, you're next.  [LAUGH]
R:  "When's she getting married?  When's she getting married?"
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  And, um ... God forbid they found out my boyfriend was only half Jewish.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] Um, and you know, I guess that'd be important too, um, if I get married any time soon, he'd have to be Jewish. [LIPSMACK]
L:  In -- well, and that's something that you have to know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um ...
R:  Yeah, if I were to marry a non Jew I wouldn't be able to do it while my grandparents were alive.
L:  What if -- what if they were willing to -- to still follow your religion?
R:  If he converted for me ... it might be okay.  My parents would be okay with it as long as their grandchildren were raised Jewish --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Exclusively.  Like, they couldn't ... I know -- I know a lot of people who were brought up in mixed marriages who ... you know, they celebrate both and that would not be okay.  Um ...
L:  Because I -- I have a girlfriend who's ... her husband is Jewish --
R: Mhm. 
L:  -- and she was ... Catholic ... um, but they ... and they kinda -- they kinda do the both thing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, -- but my cousin ... married a Jewish girl and converted.
R:  Really?
L:  Um ... that, you know, 'cause that's what -- and that's actually what -- it wasn't -- it wasn't because she asked him to or she wanted him to, but it was some- you know, he ... in going to church with her and he decided that he preferred that.
R:  Really?  I actually -- I mean, that's how my boyfriend's family is.  His mother isn't Jewish so technically, like, Judaism is half found through the mother --
L:  Mhm, right.
R:  -- but, um, I mean, he was raised going to synagogue.  He had a Bar Mitzvah.  They celebrate Christmas too but, I mean, he considers himself ... to be a Jew.  But, um [LIPSMACK] I -- we have a -- one of my mother's closest friends who actually had a Barmitzva with her --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because my mother -- like I said, our families are religious.  They don't believe in that, um, like having a Bar Mitzvah for a girl.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, um [LIPSMACK] she had her Bar Mitzvah when I was like ... twelve years old ... and one of the women she had her Bar Mitzvah with -- there was like a group of older women at the shoal -- not older, but like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, grown women at the shoal who did it together, and one of them was a woman who had converted when she got married, and they had three daughters and she's divorced now and she still, I mean, is very active in the synagogue.  She ... you know, had her Bar Mitzvah ... so ... I -- I mean, she, I guess, converted because she really believed.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Not, like, just ...
L:  Be- because it was the --
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know, nice thing to do.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, um ... I mean, normally my parents ... want their grandchildren to be Jewish and ... I would want ... I mean ... I -- I've grown up always celebrating the holidays.  It's important to me; I'd want my husband to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- be part of that.  [LIPSMACK] So ...
L:  And -- well, I think, and that's ... when you're finding a partner, that's what you have to be willing to do is to keep ...
R:  I know.
L:  You know, do things that make the other one happy and not just because you're making them happy because by making them happy you're happy too.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, we have in our ... you know ... you have -- you know what my family did for Christmas and the holidays and whatever, and what his family did for Christmas and the holidays and all that stuff and now what we do with our -- our own family is a mix of the two and some of our own stuff.
R:  [MN] That's nice.
L:  You know, that -- that we found a blend because we're not --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- either one of our parents.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, we're our own thing in yet there's parts of that that we want to carry on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ... [MN] we've developed our own tradition and, um, also ... you know, carry on some of our own, or some of our families.
R:  That's -- see, that's really nice.  Most of our, like ... holidays that we spend with my family are -- well, they're -- I mean, they're all with my dad's family ... um ... my mother's family is all in France so ... we don't see them very often.
L:  Hm.
R:  But ... [MN] [LIPSMACK] I mean, I -- I don't know what I'd do, like ... I guess you'd have to, like, you know, ma- figure out because ... like, with holidays --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to spend with whose family and ...l
L:  Yeah.  That's a -- that's a tussle sometimes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, actually once ... we -- we had children, it -- well, the -- the whole Christmas thing became pretty easy because we said we'd spend Christmas at home.  You're welcome to join us [LAUGH] --
R:  That's nice.
L:  But we need to be at home on Christmas morning --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when our kids are little.
R:  How --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How many kids do you have?
L:  I have two.
R:  How old are they?
L:  Ah, almost fifteen, and nine.
R:  Oh.  That's -- yeah, my brother and I are six years -- almost six years apart.
L:  Yeah, it -- it's -- it's interesting because there are two different places but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, it's -- my niece and nephew are like sixteen months apart so they're -- with everything kind of together.
R:  Right.
L:  And, uh ... that has its advantages and disadvantages.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] You know, they -- they squabble and fight more than -- than my children do because they're -- they're not ... after the same things.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, and yet they're also -- they share friends and things that ... my kids don't because they're in two different ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- age brackets ... so ...
R:  Yes, it's ... it's a trade off.  I mean, I -- I liked having the difference between me and my brother.  I wou- like, I babysat for all his friends.  I ... you know, I drove car pools and did all that stuff.
L:  [LAUGH] Yup.
R:  But, um ...
L:  See, I was the youngest so I -- I never had that ... opportunity.  [LAUGH]
R:  How many siblings did you have?
L:  I have a brother and a sister.
R:  That's nice.
L:  Yeah.  But ...
R:  Yeah, I have -- I mean, it's just me and my brother and he's fourteen now so ... [SIGH] but, um ...
L:  So, just starting high school?
R:  Yes, yeah, he's a freshman.   Um, it's weird.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's definitely weird, even when he was born.  But ... it's nice.  I mean ... I used to wish I had like more brothers and sisters, when we weren't fighting, and then I wished I didn't have any.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But ...
L:  Right, and then you wished he wasn't around? [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  But, um ... my dad's family is very small.  My mother's is huge!  Um ... I mean, she doesn't have any sisters.  She has four brothers, but my grandparents on that side, my grandmother's one of twelve kids and my grandfather's one of fourteen.
L:  Wow!
R:  So ... it's huge!  [LIPSMACK] Um ...
L:  It's -- and it's -- um, like I have a cousin who I'm close with, and actually she's actually the same age as my brother and ... she's an only child.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she got married ... two years ago and the ... the man that she married is one of five.
R:  Wow.
L:  And also had lots of cousins and -- and things like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so their ... she got ... pulled into this -- this fa- huge family and --
R:  Oh, my God you -- you don't know what you're getting into when you do that.
L:  [LAUGH] I know!
R:  Like, you really don't.
L:  And it was just like ... 'cause -- it was -- she says to me, "Amy!  There's a whole lot of nieces and nephews and cousins and ..." [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] I said, "Yeah, that's ... family!"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, but -- you know we ... you know she -- it was different.
R:  You just don't know what to do with them.
L:  Right that's -- she's like, that -- it was just ... you know, we were ... most of my mom's family was kinda near -- like, within an hour or so that we -- we'd get together --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on Thanksgiving and Christmas and ...
R:  Right.
L:  But it still wasn't -- it was still -- still pretty -- pretty tame.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Whereas she was -- and, uh, um, so that was -- that's a whole new experience for her.  She's --
R:  Yeah.  No, it's ... a huge difference.  You don't realize until like ... you actually see it but ... I mean, I grew up with the perception that my father's family is tiny [LIPSMACK] because compared to mother's family it is!
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, he has two sisters --
