R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Theresa.
L:  Hi, Theresa.  My name's Jackie.
R:  Jackie, hi, how are you?
L:  I'm doin' pretty good.
R:  Yeah, okay, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Have you done these yet?
R:  I've done one.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  How 'bout you?  Yeah.
L:  No, this is the first one.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH] It's -- it was a little befuddling but ... um, it was hard keeping to the -- to the given topic last time, but this should be easier.  The topic's more interesting.
L:  It sounds -- sounds fairly simple.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Life partner, that's -- that's pretty, uh ... pretty straightforward there.
R:  Cut and dried.
L:  Oh.  Hm?
R:  Yeah, so what do you think ... is the most important thing?
L:  Um ... I think being able to talk to them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, being able to ... to feel comfortable talking to them about anything and be able to just ... uh, talk about anything and nothing and just ... be comfortable with them and enjoy talking with them.
R:  Yeah, I agree.
L:  And spending time with them, you know?
R:  Yeah.  So, have you -- have you had that or have -- do you have it?  [LAUGH]
L:  Ye- ye- not ... well, sort of.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh ... I had, in high school, I had a relationship like that and it was actually three and a half years long.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, and the two of us ... got along great.  He was my best friend before we started dating.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But ... so it was like we -- we got along great, we could talk about anything and nothing, we'd talk almost every night --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and saw each other all the time and it was great.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Until we went away to college and we ended up going to different colleges --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we just grew apart --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- because it was a -- it was a distance relationship and in college you go through changes and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- new friends and different fields and just ...
R:  Right.
L:  -- grew apart and we're not the same people we were in high school so ...
R:  Right.  I think that's also very important too is to find someone that you can like grow together with, you know?  Because I think a lot of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- relationships or marriages and ... like, you know, like the years down the road they could say they've evolved on different paths, yeah.
L:  Yeah, end up going in different ways.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What -- what about you?  Have you had anything like that?
R:  Um ... uh ... I guess -- I guess not completely.  Like, I don't think I've ever had a relationship where I've been, like -- I've been totally honest with that person.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- actually I don't know if that's ... that's -- if that's actually good if you're like totally honest because a lot of times you feel things, um, that are sort of transient and if you express them at the moment you're feeling them then it might do more harm than good.
L:  Mhm.
R:  What do you think?  [LAUGH]
L:  I could see that.  I -- yeah, especially like really intense emotions like if you're really angry about something and then, you know, the next day you sit back and you go, "Oh, that wasn't that big a deal.  I was just in a bad mood".
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  I think -- I could see that.
R:  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  I think it would be really hard --
R:  What would?
L:  -- to always be honest and tell everything.
R:  Yeah ...
L:  It's not so much that you're deceptive.  It's you just don't always ... say what's on your mind, you know?
R:  And plus for me, a lot of times I have trouble figuring out what I'm feeling [LAUGH] for myself ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so expressing that is like another step behind -- beyond -- beyond that so, yeah.
L:  Mhm.  I think  it -- I think it's hard sometimes.  I mean ... it's easy to sit back and think about other people's problems 'cause it's -- you've gone at a distance from it.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  When you have to sit and figure out how you feel about something and like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's more complex.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it is.
L:  There're lots of feelings and you could go all this -- this side of it and there's that side, and I don't know ...
R:  It's very murky.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK] So ... I don't know.  So, do you think those two things are enough maybe?  Like, being able to talk, you know, really freely ... and sort of having the similar ... goals I guess?
L:  I don't think that's enough.  I think that's the most important.
R:  Mm.
L:  I think trust is definitely important.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you don't trust 'em, then it makes it a lot harder to talk to 'em and to feel comfortable around 'em.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  How about if you have all that but you're not like physically attracted?
L:  I think that that can grow.
R:  You think?
L:  I think it's -- to a point.  I think that if you really care about someone --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you begin to see the attractive points of them, like, "Oh, they have beautiful eyes" or, "I love their smile" ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or ... uh ... or you know, they have a great voice, and it's like ... even if you're not immediately attracted to them ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I do know people where it's like ... a person grows on them.
R:  [LAUGH] I guess so.
L:  You know ... like mould!
R:  I guess if you really --
L:  No.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I guess if you ... if you start to like the person as -- for their personality more then they become more attractive because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I was in this relationship for like -- I don't know, like two and a half years, and ... I wasn't all that -- I mean, he was attractively -- you know, pretty attractive physically, but I wasn't personally attracted to him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it was like, "Oh, you know, it'll just come" you know, but then it just never did [LAUGH] and like ...
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and I don't know if that was because ... I had issues with him as a person or what but, yeah.  That was kinda disappointing.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I don't know.  'Cause I dated a guy for a while that I didn't think was attractive at first but then I started to really think -- really find him attractive after a while.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I've known other people that are like that too.  Like, [MN] my best friend is engaged to a guy who, when she first saw him, she compared him to an ogre --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and now she thinks [LAUGH] -- yeah, now she thinks he's ... just gorgeous, you know?  It's like --
R:  Oh, that's great. [LAUGH]
L:  It's just one of those things where it's like -- and -- and she won't admit -- so I'd act- she's like, "I know he -- he may not be the most attractive peop- guy to some people" but ... 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But she's really attrac- but she personally is really attracted to him now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  She's -- he's just grown on her.
R:  That's great, yeah.
L:  He kind of cleaned himself up a bit too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, did he?  [LAUGH]  That helps.
L:  Yeah, always helps [LAUGH] when they're willing to clean up a bit.
R:  Did you -- did she tell him ... what she thought of him initially?  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I don't know.
R:  Yeah?  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm not sure.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I think he knows she didn't ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- find him all that physically attractive at first.  I think he does know that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know that she's ever told him, you know, "I thought you were an ogre but --" [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] That would be one of those things that you keep to yourself.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I don't think that quite came up, no.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Oh.  So, how about the other way around.  Like, have you -- have you known people or have you dated someone that you initially thought was just really attractive and then ... you know, as you got to know them ... they became not so?  [LAUGH]
L:  Well ... I -- I've found a lot of sense that someone that is really attractive tends to know it.
R:   Mhm, yeah.
L:  So, right away ... people that are really attractive often have personalities I'm not particularly interested in.
R:  Mm.
L:  Uh ... but the- there have been some guys that I've thought were really attractive and turned out to have nice personalities but usually those are taken.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Like ... [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's tough.  [LAUGH]
L:  If they're attractive, either they're taken or have really bad personalities.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Or they're gay.
R:  Or they're gay.  [LAUGH]
L:  One of them was gay.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Whoops!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You didn't know initially? [LAUGH]
L:  Mm-mm.
R:  Really?  Did he know?
L:  Well, I didn't date him.  I didn't date him.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  He just ... that was just somebody that I knew that was attractive and had a good personality and was like --
R:  Oh.
L:  "Oh, I'm gay".  "Oh!  Oh, okay".
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I see.  That -- that's fine.  That's cool.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I've got nice friends.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  [SIGH] What else?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] How about funny?  Being funny's a big one.
R:  Yeah, a similar sense of humor.  Definitely.
L:  Yeah.  Some- somebody who can make you laugh.
R:  Yeah.  How 'bout similar tastes?  Like, aesthetic value?  [LAUGH] I think it's really important too.  [LAUGH]  Well, maybe not -- it's not one of the most important things but it helps.
L:  I don't know. 
R:  Really?
L:  Well ... okay, I'm -- I'm gonna put a -- a ... what's the word?  A something on that.  Similar taste is good ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but not necessarily similar opinion.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like --
R:  That's boring.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, see if you're with somebody who likes everything you do and is the same as you, that's just dull because you sit there going, "Yeah, I -- I agree.  I agree".
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Unless you have a really inflated sense of ego, then you're like, "Yeah!"  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But if you can get somebody who has a similar taste ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but a different perspective ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's great.  Like, you see a movie and you watch it and you're like, "Oh, my god, I love that for this, this and that" and they're like, "Well, I liked it but --" you know and they turn -- tell you a completely different side of things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, or you have ... similar religious views but for completely different reasons, you know [LAUGH].  It's just ...
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's true.
L:  That kinda thing I find really interesting.
R:  I agree, yeah.  That's another thing.  How 'bout religion?  Do you think that's important?
L:  Um ... yeah.  I think it depends --
R:  I think if you're religious -- yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I think in terms of how religious you are --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I mean, it's one of those with like, I'm not overly religious because my parents were.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh really?  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  It really, really turned me off [LAUGH] on religion.
R:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
L:  So -- so at this point, I'm sort of like ... well, I prefer a Christian because that's how I was raised but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm not ... dead set on that and ... [LAUGH]
R:  How 'bout -- would you date someone who's really, really ... you know, Christian?  Really religiously?
L:  Don't think I could.
R:  No, okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  I have ... I have a few friends who are that way --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they're ... uh, like ... I have a friend.  He's attractive, he's sweet, he's wonderful, but he is god boring in nutshell.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Would never date him.  
R:  Really?
L:  Never.  It would drive me nuts.  Too much like my father.  No.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know [inaudible] --
L:  That happened -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] you end up with people like your mom and your dad.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  It's one of those sorts like, eh, no!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Oh.  Well, you might change so that'd be nice.
L:  Ah, it could be.  What about you?
R:  Um, yeah, I'm sort of similar.  Well, my parents weren't religious but, um, like in college I was with a group that were --
L:  Mhm
R:  -- and they just totally turned me off towards people like them so ...
L:  What kinda group?
R:  Um, it was -- it was a -- whatever Christian, sort of, evangelical ... they were very into dogma.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was just wondering because I know that a friend of mine tried to get me into, um, I.V.C.F.
R:  Oh, yeah, that was -- yeah, some people were in that too.
L:  Yeah, which is a Christian fellowship which --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I tried for about a year and it just -- nah, no!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it was just too ... I don't know.  It wasn't my cuppa tea!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, not really.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, but one of my, um, actually closest friends from college, she was sort of in that group and then, um, she started dating this guy who -- who wasn't Christian at all and so that was like a big issue for her.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I guess, she's not actually th- that religious after all because, you know, she's still with him after, like, a year.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I think that ... I think sometimes people don't ... don't realize, you know, what's going to be important or not?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They could be -- because other things more overshadow it --
R:  Right.
L:  Like ... like, one of my friends that got me involved in this -- in this I.V. group --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Extremely religious.  She was raised in a religious family and ... the -- and she was a small group leader for I.V. --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she always said, one of the most --
