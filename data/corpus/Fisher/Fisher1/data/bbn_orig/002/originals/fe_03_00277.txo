L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Genie.
L:  Hi, I'm Alexis.
R:  So, what was the question?  [LAUGH]
L:  The question was, um, airport security and whether we think that it lessened the chances of terrorist attacks.
R:  There you go.
L:  Ah ... my feeling is ... probably.  Um, I think that, you know, I'm kind of surprised that airport security hasn't been tight anyway, but I guess if there're people there who are, you know, looking around and ... um, watching what's going on, there's less of a chance of ... bad things going on.
R:  Well, that's true and I -- I guess I think if we're gonna have it, we should have it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Good security.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, clearly.
R:  Why call it security if ... you don't really have it?  People are just kinda sitting there watching stuff go by.
L:  Yeah.  I always -- traveling, um, during holidays and things like that, I always felt like it was kind of strange.  They -- back in, ah -- I mean, back pre-September eleventh I guess, and pre all of these changes, they didn't pay those people well and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- really, they were just, you know, your average guy off the street checking through bags.  What do they care?
R:  Right.  Big [inaudible] overweight.  [LAUGH]
L:  I always thought that was really strange, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  That they would have that as their system.
R:  Yep, so [SIGH] I agree.  I do think it makes it a little hard.  Like, I know my husband travels a lot and he was gonna be coming home from, I forget where, but he's been gone for a while.  I said, "Well, I could actually park and come in and get you" and he goes, "You can't do that anyways". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it doesn't work out.
R:  Because -- yeah, usually I just drop him off at the ... um, at the entrance and pick him up at the entrance.  [LAUGH]
L:  You don't really have any choice now.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But since I've always done that, I didn't really know that -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, right.
R:  -- I couldn't, you know, go all the way to the gate and wave goodbye through the window.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know, the good old days.  Uh ...
L:  I guess that is a difference.  Um, my mom can't come and meet me at the gate anymore and that's kind of a downer, you know?  
R:  I know.
L:  You get off the plane and you feel like a little lost traveler as opposed to [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you're like you're going home --
R:  Right, being enveloped by the ...
L:  It's not as -- 
R:  -- arms when you get there.
L:  -- not as friendly, I guess, but ...
R:  Right, right.  But ...
L:  Process the plane.
R:  Yeah, so ... as well as -- as regards whether it actually reduces terrorism, I'm sure they could find other ways --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to do it, you know?  Everything's been in the news recently, you know.  People started watching the -- you know, the big, uh, trucks that go across country, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They've got a lot of fuel too so ... um ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess to some extent I figure where there's a will there's a way.
L:  Yeah, and that's a relatively unsettling, just in terms of, you know, your general comfort.  I, um -- we generally tend to drive a lot more than we fly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just anyway.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, not for any reason other than it's just more convenient, but, ah, there are a lot of tr- big trucks and they look pretty scary.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They could do a lot of damage.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it's probably, you know, driving a regular car is probably the most dangerous thing you can do.  [LAUGH]
L:  True.
R:  I know when we [SIGH] -- back in eighty seven, we flew over to Israel and even then, you know, there's just been some attack on ... oh, I forget exactly what it was.  [SIGH] I think it was a -- a cruise ship or something and ... um, you know, some people were kind of bantering about the whole terrorist part, and they gave out a little pamphlet called living with, uh, terrorism.  And it said that more people --
L:  Really?
R:  -- die in their bathtubs every year --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- than are killed by terrorist attacks.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow! [LAUGH]
R:  So, you have to think, "Well, I take a shower every day". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's a wakeup call.  [LAUGH]
R:  You -- you know, and -- and the people who, you know, slip and, you know, wham their head on their lovely cast iron and kill themselves, like, don't they get into the headlines worldwide? [LAUGH]
L:  It's true.
R:  You know, whereas the terrorist attacks do.
L:  I guess that gives you a better perspective.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  You know, or you -- I think we went to an aquarium once and they were talking about shark attacks and you know more people are killed by pigs than by sharks.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I went, oh, wow, I don't run around -- -round saying, "Oh, my gosh, I'm scared of pigs".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um ...
L:  Oh, dear, that's kinda funny.
R:  So ... y- you know, it's kind of a ... you kind of have to walk the middle of the road saying, you know, "I'm gonna live my life, kinda take ... you know, some general precautions but, you know, you just have to keep on going".
L:  Yes.
R:  Because you never know where the problem's gonna lie.
L:  It's true.  It's very true.
R:  So, it's kind of -- you know, if you really look at it, it's kind of odd, you know?  Now that [SIGH] September eleventh really pointed out the flaw in the airport security --
L:  Mhm
R:  -- now that's been all beefed up, tightened up, like, that's the only way that people can do terrorism.
L:  It's a very limited view of --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the way the world works.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, so now we feel very safe.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, if -- I guess if terrorists were smart then they would look for another ... area that is kind of as lax as airport security used to be.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um ... [SIGH]
L:  And I'm sure there's something.  You know, I'm sure it's there somewhere.
R:  Right, right.
L:  It's probably any number of things.
R:  But, you know, perhaps we should be looking a little more at, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, real foreign relations.  [LAUGH] So we get along.
L:  That's -- that's always been my point [LAUGH] you know?
R:  How our country pisses other countries off.
L:  Why would it be that they would be angry?  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my gosh, you think?
L:  Is it justified at all?
R:  Right, right, and you know, can we work something out?  Can we be a global community?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um ... [SIGH] somehow.  You know, everybody compromising a little bit so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we don't all have to go ...
L:  I agree with you wholeheartedly. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And now, all we have to do is work on the people who are in charge.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] There you go.  Well, we try, you know, we try to vote.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, it's true.  It's true.
R:  Oh, well, that's -- that's another discussion.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, we probably shouldn't ...
R:  [several inaudible words] in Calif- in Florida, yeah.
L:  We should probably stay on topic.  Yeah.  Um, so, one thing that has struck me about the enforc- the reinforcing security and making everything all tight is the people who are just so impatient with the process, and you know that those are the same people who are screaming and yelling about not feeling safe on airplanes, and they just cannot stand the fact that they have to stand in line for twenty minutes to have their bags checked.  That just sickened me last Christmas.  It was -- it was really awful.  This one girl was -- said something about how it was absolutely insane that she should have her ... whatever, her bag checked again because she had already been on a plane and she would have just blown up the last one if she was going to blow up any plane.  I'm, like, "Oh, dear, don't say things like that in line at the airport anymore".
R:  Oh, I know, really.
L:  This really, really ... just really not smart.  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  So, I don't know.  I don't understand these people that just can't, you know, you get there earlier, you know?  
R:  Well, you know, it's just one of those --
L:  You wait in line.
R:  It's not me, obviously.  How come they don't know that?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I don't get it.
R:  They need to take care of all the bad people.  I wouldn't be one of those people.
L:  Yeah, that's just really strange to me.
R:  Now, my husband kinda had the opposite view, 'cause he was one of the people kinda picked out of line --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who the, whatever, search more carefully.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he took, um -- I think he took three flights that day and he was picked out of a line on all three flights, and he goes --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- oh, there must be a certain profile --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for today and I'm it.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I guess so.  
R:  [LAUGH] And he says, "You know, if that's true and that gets out there, and if you go on your first flight and you're not picked out of the line, you know, then you could --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- you know, pick up something" you know, pick up a pair of box cutters and throw it in 'cause we won't get picked out in the line.
L:  Right.
R:  Um ... you know, so your friend's like, "Oh, well, I would have blown up --" well, you can -- you can get stuff at the -- the next airport.
L:  Yeah, I guess.
R:  You know, so they can't really [SIGH] um, you know, if -- if we want tightened security then we all have to deal with it.
L:  You just have to be patient.  You can't ...
R:  Right.
L:  -- your know, freak out about things.
R:  Right.
L:  Know it, you -- maybe you're not a terrorist but ... I don't know.
R:  Well, obviously they didn't think the people who were, were either.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  [LAUGH] Exactly.  I don't know.  Long lines at the airport.  Generally when I fly it's all crowded anyway so it's not really a ...
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- a big difference or a big surprise.  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  The first time my husband got there, he went, like, three hours early, you know, and boom!
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He's through the line, nothing to do.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, dear.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, he had to wait for like two hours sitting reading the newspaper or something.
L:  Wow.
R:  Um, but, you know, we're not [SIGH] -- we're up in upstate New York where, um ... yeah, it's an international airport but I don't think there're many international flights [LAUGH] picked up out of it.
L:  Right.  I'm in Philadelphia so there -- I mean, it's a big airport --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and there're a lot of people going through that and ... it really -- it honestly, the first time we flew after, um, September eleventh, it literally took us about ninety minutes --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- to get through the line.
R:  Wow.
L:  Absolutely crazy.  The airport was just m- mayhem.  [LAUGH] It was like --
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I remember before --
L:  -- absolutely out of hand.
R:  -- this was probably about four years ago, I flew to Dallas --
L:  Mhm
R:  -- and here was this huge airport. 
L:  Yeah, Dallas is enormous.
R:  And you could enter it at fifty million points of entry --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, rather than going in one gate and then walking down these long concourses with no entry onto the outside, you just, you know, got left off, walked in, went through a little ... you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- airport security thing and, boom, you're at the gate.  And I'm like --
L:  I'm actually from Dallas and it's still like that.  They have --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, there's security at every door ... but really, there're a lot of ways.  I mean, if you have your ticket, you can get in, really, really easily.  It's not far.
R:  Right and you don't have to, like, walk down these, like gargantuan hallways.  [LAUGH]
L:   Mhm.  It's just, I guess, the way their airport is designed and --
R:  That must be.
L:  -- and frankly it's -- it's pretty good actually with the new system and the new security because you have a lot more options.  Um, so the lines that I've seen, haven't been as backed up and, you know, the -- yeah, maybe that's more people to watch in terms of the security, but in terms of the, you know, end users experience, I must say [LAUGH] I like that airport better.
R:  Well, you know, it maybe -- it maybe that the security person's job is easier than --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because they're not dealing with such highly frustrated people --
L:  Truly, yeah.
R:  -- you know?  They waited in a little line, they understand what you're doing but the line moves, as opposed to if you know, two checkers are doing, like, fifteen gates worth of people.  
L:  Yes.
R:  By the time you get through, you know, you're yelling at the security guard and it's not their fault.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, so ...
L:  One thing I feel a little sorry for, um, the Philadelphia airport was just redesigned, um, like all the inside and all the stores and this and that and the other.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, so they have some, you know, pretty interesting stores and lots of themes and the idea, I guess, was that while you wait for people to arrive, you can go and do all this shopping.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  Now, these stores are on the other side of security.  There's no shopping going on and I think they just are all suffering seriously from this.  Um, just, uh ...
R:  I can imagine, 'cause it seemed to me the people that are st- you know, are layovers [LAUGH] are the ones that do the shopping.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  And do -- do they really want to go through security just to go shop and then have to come through again.
L:  Yeah, so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's -- it's a shame [LAUGH] for those people.
R:  Yep, I can see how that would be.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Well [SIGH] um ... hmm. [LAUGH]
R:  What else can we talk about?  [LAUGH]
L:  I was gonna say, it's hard to fill up ten minutes, um ...
R:  I know.  You think ten minutes goes by so quickly.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's harder --
