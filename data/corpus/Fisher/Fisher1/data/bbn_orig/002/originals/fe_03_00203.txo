L:  Hi.  My name is -- hi, my name's Tina.
R:  Hi.  I'm Stan.  Nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Um, so I guess we're talking about holidays.
L:  Sounds like it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] What's your favorite?
L:  Christmas.
R:  Really?  Oh, so you've gotta be happy.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's right around the corner.
L:  I'm happy until I come home at night and see my bills. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah.  What -- what do you like about it?
L:  Hm, everybody's in the spirit of love.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  It's not one that I have a lot of experience with.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm ac- -- I'm actually Jewish.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, but I guess, yeah, it's a nice time of the year.  I like how everything lights up.  It's always nice.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  See, I really like, um, Passover, actually.
L:  Mm.
R:  Do you know anything -- do you know anything about that?
L:  Yes.  Well, that's really -- you know, I l- -- I love Christmas more so for the meaning of Christmas, too.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I think we could identify on that level. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I definitely think so.  But what I really like about Passover is, um, th- there's a lot of tradition surrounding it and then there's a lot of tradition, um, family tradition.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And all of that's really important to me.  I like the idea of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  do- doing the same thing every year with my family and having us all gathered together --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in one place for something.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I j- -- yeah.  [NOISE] That, um, that's really nice for me personally.
L:  Mhm.
R:  To be able to do that. [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, did he say something about creating a holiday?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Oy.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Um, I'm not so much into that. [LAUGH]
L:  I like the idea, but I think [LAUGH] -- I think the holiday should be like Thanksgiving, a sort of Thanksgiving --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- every day, so people are, like, aware of -- of others rather than just aware of themselves. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  But at the same time, if you extend something to have it every day, then it sort of loses its meaning.
L:  No, but that's exactly why it would be terrific, because then people wouldn't think it has to be, like, that there has to be a certain set of behaviors on one given day.
R:  Every day is earth day.
L:  That every day is -- is a day to give thanks.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  To appreciate what you have.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  And what you get.
R:  That's true.  That would be nice ... [NOISE] but I'm not sure if we could [NOISE] ... I don't know if people would then just sort of forget all about it because they wouldn't ... [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  I think that holidays aren't limited to only the holiday because there's always time beforehand and time afterward when it's on everyone's mind.
L:  Oh, I think everyone should have to be, like, working in a soup kitchen or, like, freezing outside for, [LAUGH] like, a day or a night and -- to understand, like, be -- like, some people might need more severe examples of --
R:  Yeah, that's true.  I mean --
L:  There's -- it's actually the --
R:  I really --
L:  I'm getting -- I'm getting another call from the same ...
R:  How bizarre.
L:  -- thing.  Yeah, it's been calling me [PAUSE] a million times every night.  It's driving me absolutely nuts. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's b- -- it's just been once a night for me, every weeknight.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, yeah, that's -- um, Yom Kippur is actually the holiest day on the -- on the calendar.
L:  Mm.
R:  [MN] And it's sort of a day to -- to think about how you're gonna change the way you live --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for the next year.  It comes a week after the Jewish New Year.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and -- but one of the things that you do is that you don't eat or drink --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- from sundown to sundown.
L:  Right.
R:  So ... it's all about remembering what it's like to be really hungry.
L:  Mhm.  Well, I mean, so --
R:  Which I guess is the same thing.
L:  -- you were saying that -- right, you were saying --
R:  Although it doesn't -- it doesn't help other people.
L:  -- you may not feel that identifies -- that's the same -- but I think you were thinking that maybe Jewish traditions really start from Christian tradition, even though, like, the first Christians were Jewish and the whole idea of Lent is the same thing, when people do stuff like that, or -- or holy days.
R:  Oh, right.  Well, no, I'm -- I'm not -- I'm not -- I'm not saying that they're different.  I was just saying that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think there are some holidays.  It's not quite like making people work in a soup kitchen --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it is making people think about what it would be like --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- to be live -- to be someone who had to go to soup kitchens.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Um, no -- yeah, and I know that -- that, you know, you don't eat meat for Lent --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and all sorts of other things for a much longer period.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, you like holidays where the idea is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to get people thinking about a larger world?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.  Um, do you think there are any holidays that can be for personal introspection?
L:  I think every day.  I think -- but I think I've come to realize that that's also, I guess, not everybody has that inner awareness, so we can't necessarily expect --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- everybody to really be the people who have the inner awareness. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  But [COUGH] -- but, I mean, there are days when you say, "Okay, everybody, you know, take a day and really think about where you fit into the world".
L:  [NOISE].
R:  But then I think that there are other types of holidays that say take a d- -- um, take a day or a week or whatever and really think about [NOISE] what you're like as a person --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- right now.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Because I think that that's something that people don't do all too often.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, but I think the way holidays are at least in the U.S., like, they're not so extended that people have, like -- I don't know.  I mean, I don't even know if Americans were given a long period of time whether they would delve deep enough, like, into that kind of stuff.  Like, I think [MN] -- I think sometimes you need a lot of time and you need to get away from whatever you're doing and the routine, like the European idea of holidays, much --
R:  Right.
L:  -- much more like that where you, like, have six weeks to, like, vanish and do something totally different.
R:  Yeah.  I'm not so fond of the going and lying on a beach --
L:  No, me neither.
R:  -- type of vacation.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, [NOISE] it's just sort of changing gears.  Um, you don't stop working, you just work at something different.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And give whatever part of your mind you've been using too much a break.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  Um ...
L:  So, are you working for this study at Penn?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, uh, working for them?
L:  Uh, are you on some [NOISE] -- are you part of the study at University of Pennsylvania? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just another subject.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [COUGH] yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [COUGH] Sorry, I have something caught in my throat. [SIGH] I'm just trying to --
L:  Oh, so you're not actually, like, part of -- so, they're just connecting -- this is the first call I've taken.
R:  They're just connect- -- yeah, they're just connecting to random people.  I'm not sitting here with a clipboard.
L:  No, that's what I was wondering, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, no.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I'm getting another call from this line.  It's crazy.
R:  That --
L:  They're -- it's just really neurotic.
R:  Well, that's --
L:  I don't think they realize it's [inaudible].
R:  Bizarre.  No, I haven't had that happen to me yet.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, so do you think holidays are different elsewhere?
L:  Well, I -- I mean, I work with a lot of Europeans and I tend to think that Europeans actually take more time to really think about their place in the world and, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause there's always that inner awareness and ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know if it has something to do with how society is structured outside of the U.S.
R:  Mhm.  Have you spent time living overseas?
L:  No.  I've traveled a lot but I haven't really lived overseas.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Hm. [NOISE]
R:  So, what do you think about stuff like Halloween?
L:  I don't like Halloween. [LAUGH]
R:  No?
L:  To me it's evil.  You know the whole premise behind Halloween? [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, I've heard lots of different stories.  What's yours?
L:  Well, there are actually, like, still, like -- well, first of all, it's, like, it follows All Saints Day which is, like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- one of the holiest days [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in Christian life.  And, uh, like, people -- so, there's still cults that, like, sacrifice.  It's actually still the day with the most sacrifices of babies and, like, of human beings, like, all year round, and I think it's totally disgusting. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  But as -- okay, as an American phenomenon.
L:  [MN] Well, sad to say, but, you know, the whole world is sorta structured on, like, premises of fear because of all the people who do odd things and because there are people, like, out there who actually might, like, hurt children or, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- put things in their candy or whatnot, like, I think -- I mean, all that stuff just places a lot of fear in people's hearts and minds.
R:  [MN] Yeah.  I've also -- a- another origin story, and I'm not sure how credible this is, um, as I recall it was from a pretty credible source, was that, um, the tradition of trick or treating particularly was, um, [MN] that the day after All Saints Day, uh, the lords would go out and, um, give gifts to their, um, serfs to help them get through the winter --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that was approaching.
L:  Interesting.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, I'm just trying to think ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I think that that -- that's part of maybe the idea that, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- holidays are given a specific day, but the spirit of whatever particular holiday sort of pervades the weeks --
L:  Yeah, well, that's what bugs me about Halloween, though, is that --
R:  -- the weeks become --
L:  -- like, there actually are, like, [NOISE] a lot of devil worshippers out there, like, that still exist.  Like, I have a friend who teaches at a junior high school where I live, and his students, like in junior high school, whose parents are training them to worship the devil.  I mean, this doesn't sit well with me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, do they do anything wrong?
L:  Yeah.  Well, they, like, bury things, like, in the school yard because, I don't know, they think -- they hold, like, all these weird superstitions about, like, I don't know, things that are good versus evil and that aren't based on any sound [LAUGH] sense. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  [NOISE] Hm.
L:  [NOISE] [inaudible]
R:  That's right.
L:  So, what are we supposed to be doing on these phone calls?  I have no idea.
R:  We just talk about holidays.
L:  And people are recording us? [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  I -- uh, the last one I did was arms inspections in Iraq and --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- it was considerably more heated.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well --
R:  This is -- this is sort of more laid back, I think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what do you think about greeting card holidays, then?  I mean, do you think that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- getting people to take a day to appreciate what their secretaries do for them --
