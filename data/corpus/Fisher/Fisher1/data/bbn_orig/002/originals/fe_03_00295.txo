L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?  Hi.  My name's Sven.
L:  Hi, my name is Danya.  How are you?
R:  Hi.  I'm good.
L:  All right.  So, we're supposed to talk about, um, if we think that airport security is pu- um, what does it [inaudible], what is it?  What was it?
R:  Um, just like, ah, whether improvements like terrorism, I guess, is that the idea?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um.  Do you want to go first?
R:  Yeah, sure.  Um, I think like just based on all those studies right after nine eleven, um, about like how much stuff you could get past security --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I mean, this is like, this was when it was, like, security was at it's most, like, way highest, you know, like a lot of stuff has, like, become a lot more lax since then, like, I think just based on those studies, I don't think they're really effective because people got like, you know, knives and like explosives and all kinds of shit across like that, wasn't, like, supposed to, so, just basically --
L:  I don't know if they, um, I felt like maybe, like, from when I hear- -- I heard about the studies and I heard that they came through with like um, maybe like knives and stuff like that.  I didn't know about explosives [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, it's -- ah, I'm pretty sure like I heard about, ah, you know what, it -- that's kind of like, I guess, the sort of thing that might have gotten like, exaggerated as time went on.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, maybe it wasn't exactly explosives.  Yeah, but there were certainly like, definitely weapons that got past.  And I'm almost certain that I heard about guns or, you know, [inaudible] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that kind of thing getting past, so.  Um --.
L:  Well, you know, like, I don't understand like, I thought, like, they take so much precaution into, like, protecting people's safety and doing so many, like, charts and going through the -- the detectors and all that.  I don't understand how people can still go inside -- go inside a airplane with, ah, harmful object.  I don't -- I don't -- I still don't understand that.  Like --
R:  Yeah, that's true, like, just from your own personal experience, right, like going to the airport and going through all those checks and stuff --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, I'm not really sure.  Like, you wonder if they somehow bypass the security through, like, some kind of, like, you know, they somehow get past the guard without having to go through metal detectors, or they actually get through the metal detectors without -- I mean, I guess there -- there will be like ways that you could just conceal it so they couldn't see it in an the x rays somehow.  
L:  Mm.
R:  If they like camouflage or something.  I don't know.  I'm not really sure.  But --
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think like, well, you know, it makes people -- I guess it makes people feel a lot safer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- still, like doing the checks, you know, I think me- -- I don't -- I don't think everyone d- -- wants to get through with, um, you know, with a harmful object will be able to because I know like, um, they when they were doing the studies they, um, they didn't get through with it all of the time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just some of the time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I guess, like, [inaudible] turn out, like some people who care, who, um, you know, [inaudible] turn out people who do have, um, guns and stuff --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- with, um, like people, I mean, like I'm trying to say like O'Hare.  People, um, I guess, like, not everyone can get -- you can't luckily you can't fool them all the time, but like --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- some of the time they can, you know, be caught.
R:  Right.  Like the shoe bomber, for example.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Basically.  Um, I don't know, I think like, I think it's -- I -- I don't know, I -- I feel very safer -- I'd feel safer if, um, you know, we do do -- people complain a lot how the air- -- the lines are [inaudible] so long and all these --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, like, precautions.  Like, I just feel like a lot safer, you know.
R:  Uh huh.
L:  And, um, you just -- I -- I just -- I just feel -- I just feel better about it.  And people were complaining like the lady couldn't even take a comb like cause it was awfully sharp --
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  I thought that was funny.  She was complaining about that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I -- I'm sure they go -- they like, when the first -- the first -- September eleven first happened --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm sure like they were really, like really, really harsher than like nothing, like, you're not even allowed a sharp pen [inaudible] but I'm sure, like, maybe, and I don't know, I haven't traveled lately, I'm sure now they're a little bit more lax, or something.
R:  Yeah.  Like they, um, I was just at the airport a few days ago.  They, um, they brought, like, you know, the curb check in and stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that's supposed to be one of like the first things that really should have gone because, like, it's a lot less safe to do that instead of --
L:  The what?
R:  Ah, the curb check ins.
L:  Curb check ins?
R:  Where, ah, like, ah, I [inaudible] it's for like sidewalk check in or whatever.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  As soon as you got there they take your luggage --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and apparently they don't check those as well as, ah, if you actually bring it up to the counter.  
L:  Mm.
R:  So -- and that's supposed to be pretty unsafe.  But [inaudible].
L:  They've got to actually go through your bags, right?
R:  Do they go through your ba- -- do -- do they go through all the bags?
L:  No, I mean, they have random checks of the ba- bags, right?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think so.  I guess.  [inaudible] so.  Um --
L:  I think -- I thought I heard that they did because, um, I don't know, I just thought like randomly they would just, you know, check people's bags and --
R:  Uh huh.  Yeah, that wouldn't surprise me.  But, um, I -- I guess like, to really answer the question, like, I know this sounds kind of vague, but it almost seems like if someone wanted to really do it, if someone got around to organize such a thing for years --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like they could get past security.
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  Yeah.  So, that's like, that's kind of like, I -- I mean, if someone who is kind of an amateur, maybe, like a shoe bomber, for example, you know, could get caught easily, but I mean, if you have like twelve people supported by like a massive terrorist organisation, it seems almost unstoppable, like mere airport security, it's like that's the kind of thing that troubles me.
L:  Yeah.  Ah, yeah, it's true, like people will, um, if they want to -- really want to do it, like, they could.  I mean, like they did have airport security before Sep- -- September eleven and look what happened.  You know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But I guess like they just heightened it up, you know, a little bit --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- or, whatever, to -- just have a little, people -- pe- -- put people's minds at ease or something.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And I think, um, I just fr- -- for me, I just feel, I feel safer, just like, the, um, airport security is -- even though it's a pain [LAUGH].
R:  Uh huh.
L:  Waiting in line all that time  --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- I just feel better.
R:  Yeah.  It's okay, like, I usually get there like two hours early anyway, regardless.  So, I mean, if I have to wait a little more for security, it's not such a big deal, I guess.
L:  Do you travel a lot?
R:  Um, I travel, ah, well, I'm in college right now.
L:  Me too.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Are we all college students?  I'm not sure, in this [inaudible].
L:  I don't know.  What school do you go to?
R:  Um, I go to Harvard.
L:  Okay.  I go to University of Maryland.
R:  Okay.  And where do you live, like?
L:  In [inaudible] [LAUGH] Maryland.
R:  Oh, okay.  So --
L:  So, it's [inaudible] on campus.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Do you live on campus?
R:  Ah, yeah.  But, like, is that where you -- is that where you normally -- like where you lived at high school?
L:  Yeah.  I live in Maryland.
R:  Okay.  Cool.
L:  Where do you normally live?
R:  Um, I normally live North of Chicago.
L:  Oh. 
R:  So, I flew back for Thanksgiving and I'm flying back next Wednesday, too.
L:  Oh, for Christmas break.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm, like, exams are next week.  I'm going crazy right now [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That's all.  What's your major?
R:  Um, I think I'm going to do English
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I'm also going to do pre-med, so ...
L:  Pre-med to English is a big change.
R:  Oh, no, er -- I'm going to do both.
L:  Are you going to do both?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  Oh, so, like, I mean, I know I want to be a doctor, but I'm also real interested in English.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I think I want to just like make the most out of college by taking those courses.
L:  That's excellent.
R:  Yeah.  How about you?
L:  Well, my, um, my major's, um, hearing and speech.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I want to get, like, my, um, my doctorate in it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and maybe a professor and do research.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  Cool.
L:  And my -- um, I have a minor science, technology and society.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I'm actually a first year, so it's kind of all up in the air right now.
L:  Oh, you're a first year?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I'm -- this is my third year.
R:  Third?  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  So you've got a lot of room to change your mind [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [inaudible] like three times, I was like information systems, computer science, I'm like, "No".
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Now, it's business, I was like, "No, I don't want to help corporate -- corporate America" [LAUGH] --
R:  No.  Yeah.  Okay.
L:  -- I'd rather help individuals.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But anyway, we're really getting off the topic. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I don't -- well, like, what do we -- we can't talk about this for like twenty minutes, I mean --
L:  Is it?  I thought it was ten minutes.
R:  Oh, is it ten minutes?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't -- I wonder how much can we talk about airport secur- I mean, they just want to like, hear, like stuff about, like, how we talk, right, basically?
L:  I have no clue.
R:  I -- I thought the idea was like we talk about a different -- [inaudible] they observe our dialogues and how we talk and -- okay.
L:  Oh, you think it's about dialogue?
R:  Oh, we're not di- -- yeah, maybe it's just about like, that.
L:  Maybe.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  I don't know.
R:  Because they ask a lot of race questions and stuff and where we're from, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Okay, well, I guess we can talk more about airport security.  Um, do -- do you think ah another attack will come soon?
L:  Um, I don't think so.  I don't know.  I don't know why it feels like [inaudible] that you can't be too over confident.  It's not that I'm over confident, I just feel like, even I- -- I don't -- I don't -- I don't know, I just don't feel like, it's going -- if it's going to come, I don't think it's going to come any time soon.
R:  Okay.
L:  I really don't.  And, um, I was thinking about Bin Laden and, um, what's his -- what's his name?  Hussein.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Getting together --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] and I was thinking, well, then, like, they'll be, like -- that'll be pretty weird.  That'll be pretty weird.
R:  Uh huh.
L:  But, it's like, maybe they're friends.  Maybe they have coffee together or something.
R:  [LAUGH]  Coffee.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  American buy coffee.  Right.
L:  Do -- do you think another attack is going to come soon?
R:  Oh, gosh.  Come -- I don't like, okay, I just read like I don't know, there's all these like whatever studies [inaudible] to predict they'll come like the next month or something.  Um, I don't -- I don't think it will be at least for another year or so, but, I mean, it just seems like they want to -- they -- they're very eager to do something again and now like the pressure's kind off El Qaida because, I mean, I don't really know how true that is in terms of like actual government work, um, but like it seems like the focus is so much Iraq now that like, ah, Bin Laden might seize this as an opportunity to, you know like try to get our attention again.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, like, I don't [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, that's true.  That's very true.
R:  Like, he tried something in Singapore, that kind of didn't work.  So, I mean, I don't know what he was doing there, but like I think he -- he likes being in the spotlight and he hasn't really said anything lately, probably because he wants to make us think that he's dead or something.
L:  I don't think he's dead for real.  I really don't think he's dead.
R:  Oh, no.  He's -- yeah, he's definite -- because, um, yeah, they just released some evidence that he's alive.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  Like some tapes, um, yeah.
L:  I think I heard of them, but I wasn't sure if it was really valid or not.
R:  Uh huh.  Um, I think -- yeah, I read like a Times article, it seemed pretty valid, um, [inaudible] and that sort of stuff.  So --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um --
L:  Yeah, I -- I really didn't, like, as much as I would like, I mean, I mean, I'm not a cruel person --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  --  but I feel as though that he shouldn't die so easily [LAUGH].
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  I mean, I think it --
R:  You should like --
L:  -- I believe in cruel and unusual punishment for him [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, man.
L:  You know, I'm -- I'm really serious.  Like he's should like be burnt alive or something.
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  I know that's kind of -- that's kind of heinous, but --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- like, he did like terrible things, so I'm just --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I'm not amused by him.
R:  Okay.  Well, I'm n- -- I'm not really a proponent for the death penalty, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if we just like left him in a jail for a while or forever --
L:  You want -- you want to leave him in a jail?
R:  Yeah, sure.  I mean, I'm sure the guards will torture him a little bit.
L:  They should.  I mean, like even if he doesn't die --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- I think he should be tortured.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, definitely.  He really should be tortured.
R:  Oh.  Um, yeah, so, I don't know.  What do you think the chances are that Saddam will do something like that?  I think it [inaudible] right?
L:  Um --
R:  I mean, that's just like way beyond anything that, like, any civility that's -- I mean, that would just be asking for all out war, so ...
L:  Yeah.  I -- I don't know.  I don't -- I think Saddam -- I feel like he has a lot of, like, he has a lot of [inaudible] like a lot of --  I don't think he's a man of like action like that.  I mean, he is but I don't feel like he'll -- I don't think he'll risk it.
R:  Uh huh.
L:  Um, with the [inaudible] get in war with us.  I don't -- I really don't think he'll like he'll risk it because he has, you know, he has a lot to lose, everything.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Yeah.  Um.
L:  So, I really, like he just should give us his, um, what is it, his, ah, nuclear weapons.  I guess they are like -- he is allowing the, um, with allowing UN to go in and --
R: Oh, yeah.
