R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Samara, um ...
L:  Hi, I'm Shaun.
R:  Hi- how are you?
L:  Good.
R:  [LAUGH] Um, any thoughts on the topic?
L:  [LAUGH] Um ... gee, if I knew.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Go on forever.  Um ... uh ... I could give all the cynical lines and, uh, money but, um --
R:  They're relevant.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it is actually.  Um ... I don't know, common interests.
R:  That's good.
L:  Yeah.  What do you think?
R:  Uh, I don't know.  It used to be the simple things like, you know, if you're lo- in love and you're meant for each other and honesty and all that good stuff but I think the older I get the more you just want people that are independent and not crazy.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's a good one.  Lack of insanity, yes.
R:  Mhm.  And it's -- oh, I get like minded isn't very, very, very important because I think at some point a lot of, um -- well, you know, just a lot of the things that drive you at first to get together, attraction and things like that, wear off and if your politics and other things aren't in some way --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- compatible, then you've got nothing to talk about and a lot of arguments ahead of you.
L:  Yeah, I hear you on that one.
R:  [LAUGH]  Can't think of much else.  Are you married?
L:  Uh, no.
R:  Yeah, me neither.  Too young.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I -- I don't know.  I'd -- I think I would just ... just at now be happy with -- with those things.  A -- a strong and, uh, compassionate person with, um, you know, a strong career, I think.  Not nec-
L:  Right.
R:  I'm not looking for somebody to support me at all [LAUGH] but, um ... that sort of thing.
L:  No, but it's a good sign of, um, responsibility.
R:  Yes.  You know, that you don't live with your mother anymore --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- that kind of thing. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's disturbing when you get older and you find out that that's not just a joke on the TV, that you will encounter a lot of people that --
L:  That people do do that, yes.
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH] So ...
L:  I know.  Um ... yeah.  Uh, well, I -- I don't know if you mentioned religion or not, but yeah, that is kind of ...
R:  Oh, yeah, well, spirituality is important.
L:  I dated somebody for two years.  I'm a Catholic, she was agnostic and then she turned, uh ... she turned pagan and dumped me for a Wiccan. 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh.
L:  So ... yeah, that's important.
R:  My father broke up with a woman because she became pagan, because she insisted -- he insisted she was a witch.  It was hysterical.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was, like, no, well ... you know --[LAUGH]
L:  So ...
R:  I don't think that that's what was going on.  She might be putting spells on you now but ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't think so.  Um, see I wasn't raised, um ... any particular religion so I've never encountered problems with that, but, um, I think that a lot of -- I'm only twenty three.  A lot of people aren't particularly excited in their faith, um ...
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  So, it's never been a conflict for me but I could imagine that being one.  I just -- it seems like, um, I've only ever -- I've dated people that were doubtful Christians [LAUGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- in a way.  Um, yeah, I can -- I -- I -- I work a -- many, many diverse cultures and I hear a lot of that, um, sort of thing where you never date someone outside of a particular religion or culture or ... things like that, but I've just never been -- I -- I never want to close it off like that.
L:  Yeah, I hate being that way myself, but there -- you know, after -- after my one ... after that one experience, um, you know, it's hard to deny.
R:  Yeah, I couldn't just --
L:  Well, and it depends on the person of course --
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  -- how important it is for him or her, but, um ...
R:  And who you're dating with and -- and who you're raising children with are very, very different.  It's like, I see religion being very difficult to maneuver if you're very different, with children.
L:  Yeah, it -- yeah, it can be.  I guess some people can but ... um, and I -- and I -- and I -- yeah, and idealistically [COUGH] try- excuse me, try to believe, uh, it wouldn't be that big of a problem but evidently it did so ...
R:  Oh, that's unfortunate. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, I mean, for her.  I -- you know ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Actually, no -- yeah, and eventually it was like I -- I should have listened to my gut instinct and said, "Nah, this is ..." [LAUGH]
R:  I understand that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, anyway.
R:  I -- It's strange.  I go -- I didn't -- to think about it in that sense, because I guess I don't really think about it that much.  Like, thinking where -- where -- where am I going to be when I settle down and decide to have a family.  I was more raised to not, um, put that in any of your planning.  Like, don't bank on anyone and -- you know, child of multiple divorces, like ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- parents that divorced and remarried and divorced and remarried [LAUGH] because you will --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You get to -- to learn, especially as a woman, that that's not the way I was supposed to raise myself so it was more get your career, get settled and then if you want to some day have children and, you know, adopt or ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Or do it on your on, so it was -- I was never thinking that way.  I've been in a relationship for four years on and off now and ...
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that issue keeps kind of coming up here and there.  Not as something directly.  Just as like, "Well, we've been together this long and been through this much, um, it just seems like we might as well get married" but it just seems like the wrong reason to ... [LAUGH] to do that.  Just like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- well, might as well.  So ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that does seem bad -- a bit, um, I won't say cheesy, no.
R:  It's just -- it's --
L:  It's just not a good reason.
R:  Yeah, and I'm just 'cause you see a lot of these commercials are at Christmas are getting, like, the sales catalogue and things like that, doesn't -- it's not my idea --
L:  Oh, yeah, the diamond ones.
R:  Yeah, not my idea of -- I hate those so much 'cause it seems to push this -- this old ideal on people that just isn't around any more.
L:  Well, that they can be bribed, you know what I mean?
R:  Well, yeah.  And [LAUGH] ...
L:  Well, it's like bribery anyway.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I just, uh, had a bizarre experience with that, um -- I have a class where the teacher  used the amortization of a loan on the diamond ring he bought for his wife ...
L:  Right.
R:  -- as the, like, this great example.  He was -- it was ... weird 'cause he was kinda bragging about the size of the diamond and the -- the amount that he was in debt for and like, "Well, if I drive a Lexus, I have to buy her this kind of ring, you know, from Tiffany's" and he's going off for an hour and, you know, it was applicable in that we did -- learned -- we'd learned the formulas to, you know, multiply out your loan and things like that.
L:  Right.
R:  Then at the end of the class I go outside and I'm -- I'm, you know, waiting for my boyfriend to pick me up and we're talking like we always do but he wasn't out front at the time 'cause -- and he's my teacher.  And he starts to -- to -- to, uh, try to get me to go to dinner with him.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  After he just spend, you know, this hour talking about his wife and the ring and the -- getting engaged and being married and how great he was and [LAUGH] all this stuff.  It was -- it was awful.  [LAUGH]
L:  Sounds more like a lecture just about having stopped.
R:  Yeah, and I was like you know, but you have to wait to axe like a big jerk like this until after you put my grade in, you know?  You can't -- like, this kind of, you know, exited as quickly as I could without, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- answering him.  Like, "Oh, I don't know.  I'm not really hungry.  I gotta go.  I gotta go".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But it's not so -- my idea of partnering for life is just -- it's like it's something that aliens do or people on the television.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, I don't know.  I did -- it seems like for some people it works though.  Like, I have my grandparents were a wonderful example of when you -- when you meet the right person and you --
L:  Right.
R:  -- see them through thick and thin and all that stuff, but they also came out of it a different set where that was what you did and that was standard, you know. 
L:  No, I hear you.
R:  So, I don't know.  Anything other than I don't want to be with anyone that I argue with.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And ... sounds like a worn out pot.  Think I don't know.
L:  Yeah ... [LAUGH]
R:  Are you from the area?  [inaudible]
L:  Which area?  No, actually, I'm in Portland, Oregon.
R:  Yeah?  Wow, that's awesome.  I've been talking to people in the University of Pennsylvania area.
L:  Yeah, I ran across, um -- it was a funny situation, uh, from hav- I had to take a -- an internal linguistics class --
R: Oh, wow. 
L:  -- at Portland State University.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and it was ... it was for a German major.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, during that class I wound up on the -- on the, um, e- on the mailing list, uh, for the -- for the department of linguistics.
R:  Oh, and -- yeah.
L:  And I never bothered to get off of it 'til I find this email about this whole thing.
R:  Mhm.  I actually work for -- for the linguistics group that is running this study, so, um, I guess I'm probably one of the ones that, uh, you know about this.
L:  Could be.
R:  Probably.
L:  Um, yeah, until I found out about the porn service exam and stuff like that.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Are you, um -- are you looking to go into linguistics or ...?
L:  I have no idea. 
R:  No.
L:  Um ... I have no idea.  I -- it's the, um -- it's one of those degrees I almost wish I hadn't gotten.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, well, there's, uh ... what is it?  You take econ or some- I don't know, the ... [SIGH] There could have been a lot, uh, more practical things.  I took it because I knew I -- I just wanted to get a degree finally.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I'm bit of a label owner and --
R:  [LAUGH] Me too.
L:  -- I just wanted to have a bachelors to my name and then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at that time it didn't matter what.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but I knew this was gonna happen, so ...
R:  [LAUGH] Well, it's all right.  You can get -- you get to take classes after you're finished and add onto your degree.
L:  Yeah, post back stuff --
R:  That's what I'm trying too.
L:  -- work towards a masters or -- yeah, that's what I'm fearing, um, but I'd like to earn some money now.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I would like to also.  I'm working a on women's studies and sociology degree [inaudible] for mastery and theology.  Neither of them seem to have too many prospects as far as a career --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I'm only half way through going part time [COUGH] and sort of my like seventh year or something like that so, you know, if I work -- if I take like six more classes ... through the fall and summer while I work full time, I have, um, more than one job so this -- this would be a part time thing --
L:  Oh, well --
R:  -- then I might be a junior [LAUGH] by the end of the year.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I'm thinking that I'll be in my thirties before I get anywhere and it was always, um, fun to talk about being a student long term forever, but now it's just getting ridiculous and I just have no idea --
L:  Yeah, it does.
R:  -- what I want to do, um ... other than I would want -- I wanted to -- to go into something political or -- or in education, but just not -- I don't want to be a politician and I don't want a desk job, so I don't know.  I don't know if that's ever going to come true [LAUGH] so ...
L:  I'm not -- I'm not the kind that gets interested in, you know, a career.  I just want to make the money.
R:  Mm.
L:  And then enjoy my own free time.
R:  Yeah.  Well, you can go into --
L:  It's entirely idealistic I realize but ...
R:  Well, there -- there's things you can do.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Seems like -- from what I know, a lot of people get all kinds of crazy degrees and when they end up in business they make lots of money with humanities degrees buying them.  That's what you do.  Who you know and how -- what -- where you get into --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the kinds of certification that you get while you're there rather than what you did for your undergraduate work.
L:  Yeah, that- that's true.  I hear that a lot.
R:  Hm.
L:  And some -- I -- you know, I keep an eye out for that but ...
R:  'Cause I don't know anybody that, um, is working in what they got a degree in now which is disturbing.  Um, like, twenty people that have finished or from -- from  -- I went to St. Joseph's University --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- for my first two years and then I switched to Temple ... [MN] because I had to leave to work for a while and then, um ... you know, the people that I know, all -- oh, were like, "Well, I was a philosophy major" "I was an English major"  "I was a psychology major" and they're all doing generic desk work at places that are totally unrelated to their fields --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they're so unhappy and it just --
