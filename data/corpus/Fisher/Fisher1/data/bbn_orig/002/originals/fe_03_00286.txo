R:  Hi, this --
L:  Hi -- hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Uh, this is Denise Best.
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Kristen Asplin.
R:  So, what do you think about --
L:  To talk about --
R:  -- the security of, uh --
L:  Um, I think that probably it will only help, um, with the less intelligent people, like the shoe bomber guy.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't really think it will do much for other things.
R:  Well, I think it's almost like a security blanket, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it doesn't really accomplish -- I think it's creating more problems really, to tell you the truth, though, the sense of -- a false sense of security because it --
L:  Very visible.
R:  Right.  It's visible, um, it's expensive --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's time -- not only financially expensive, but time consuming, personally I have not been to an airport since nine eleven --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I haven't been on an airplane, but I work with professors that are -- I do the travel for them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they are constantly flying, international, domestic flights --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and there's a -- a marketable difference in just the -- the time frame that they to -- the amount of time that they have to devote to traveling --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the amount of, like I said, the false securities of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I've had several professors that were evacuated off planes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because of the security not -- not being up to par.
L:  Oh.
R:  So ...
L:  I've had -- I've actually flown a lot myself, I flew on the twenty ninth of September --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- um, to a wedding --
R:  Brave you [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] And, uh, I think the amount of extra time it's taking has gone down considerably.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The only time it was a real inconvenience was one time the plane had a maintenance and I had to switch plane carriers, but with the bag matching system that means I had to go and pick up my bag and go back to the ticket counter to go and re check in my bag, so I went through the whole airport thing twice.
R:  Wow.  Mm.  That really is disappointing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I mean, what is the alternative?  I mean, they have to -- there has to be a solution.  You know, it's not a matter that you can, you know, ignore the problem, there's definitely a problem, it's a high risk area.
L:  Yeah, high risk.  Yeah.  I -- I think that what they're doing is fine, I don't -- I don't see anything wrong with that, I'm, you know, I think a lot of the country was surprised that they weren't screening everybody like that.
R:  Exactly.  You know, we were, um, we were lucky that it hasn't happened before --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that's where, I mean they were looking, the terrorists were looking for areas that were easy attack areas --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, personally I think it -- they're going to, you know, you see in the back of your mind what's going to happen, you know, hindsight is everything, right --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  But I think well the problem is, um, the terrorists, they're bent on -- on -- if they're -- if they're crazy enough to kill themselves, then they'll do anything, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  So, it really, I don't know how you're going to prevent such a -- a --
L:  Israel has had tons of security measures put in for everything --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  -- and they can't prevent suicide bombers, so it doesn't seem to be --
R:  It's a scary thought that we -- that there's another -- there are human beings on this earth that act this way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But ...
L:  But most criminals are dumb.
R:  Well, that's true.
L:  And unorganized, working by themselves and if we let what hap- -- I mean, admittedly three thousand people dying is not a small thing --
R:  No.
L:  -- there are two hundred and fifty million people in this country, however and I -- I talk to people who say that, "Oh, my God, I can't fly" and I say there were four thousand airplanes in the air while nine eleven was happening, so even if you happen to be flying at the exact same time, you had a one in one thousand chance of being on one of the four airplanes.
R:  That's true.
L:  Mm.  And, you know, I knew a lot of people who were actually flying that day, one person was going to Japan overseas, a couple of people were going to Canada and they never even got on a plane because it happened so early in the day and [COUGH].
R:  The --
L:  Whatever.
R:  -- the thing that was really scary for us is we actually had people from our lab --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- traveling from Dallas and DWI going to California.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, it was breathtaking during that day --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  -- we couldn't, you know, I mean, we were holding our --
L:  There was somebody from -- I was at the University of Massachusetts at the time and there was somebody from the University of Massachusetts who was on the -- the flight from Boston that ended up in New York.  Um, but I didn't know them.
R:  That's unfortunate for us, too, we had an alumnus that lost not only his life but his whole family's lives --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  On the plane that hit the Pentagon.  
L:  Mm.
R:  So, there a couple and it's hard, you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, I think most people will say, "Let's do what it takes to make us safe" but are we using our resources in the best possible way, that's the thing?
L:  Right.  Yeah, I'm not sure that -- that there's a whole lot, I mean, I think making sure that people with guns and knives don't get on airplanes is good --
R:  Oh, well, that's a definite.
L:  That's important.  But, um, I don't think we need to go too much further than we already have considering that, you know, there's a lot of other ways that you can die.  So ...
R:  That's true.  That's true.  I think I -- I'm -- I'm [LAUGH] more worried about, you know, the maintenance man that puts scotch tape on a wing [LAUGH].
L:  Uh huh.
R:  Than I am someone with a bomb in their shoe.
L:  I had a friend who was on an airplane and she was looking out the window and she watched the baggage cart drive into the bottom of the airplane and put a hole in it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  And so they had to get everybody out the airplane and get a new airplane.
R:  That's -- that's -- I think is the critical part that they forget --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  -- uh, you know, who are the maintenance crew that are working --
L:  Right.
R:  -- on this airplane?  How many -- how many, um, how many drinks has the pilot had?
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  You know [LAUGH] these are really simple clues that, you know, maybe I shouldn't fly today.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  I think -- I think we need to go back to basics and use some commonsense.  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Use the technology that we can without breaking the bank.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  And I -- I think --
L:  Yeah.  And -- and people are, like I said, people are freaking out about flying on airlines, but, you know, you're much more likely to get hit by a drunk driver.
R:  Right.
L:  There's way many more people who are drinking in cars than there are drinking pilots, you know, stuff like that [COUGH].
R:  Well, I mean, I think the media has a lot to play on that, too --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm not sure if the -- I heard a -- a robot come in or not because I heard a couple, like a echo.  The --
L:  I don't think so.
R:  [MN]
L:  Oh, yeah, there is something coming in there, but I don't think that's our official time yet.
R:  Yeah.  So, have you -- have you actually gone through any of the new mechanisms that are due?  I know -- I think there's an airport in Florida that already has the new baggage, um, x ray machine.
L:  No, I haven't done the new baggage x rays.  I have -- I mean, I've gone through airports since they switched over to federal --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, employees --
R:  Do you see a, um, a marketable difference between --
L:  There's a lot more of them.  There's just a lot more of them and -- and it was very efficient and quick.  I had no problems at all.
R:  Oh, wow.  Not even for international flights?
L:  The only -- I haven't been international in a couple of years, so I don't know.
R:  Mm.
L:  But, [COUGH] um, the only, I mean, I think it was actually worse when they were doing so much more screening with the same old people who hadn't been trained on anything, you know what I mean?
R:  Oh, I mean, it would help --
L:  You know, everything got bogged down because they didn't know what they're doing and then they hadn't hired any more staff and all that kind of stuff.
R:  Oh and let's -- how many were not even supposed to be in this country?
L:  Right.
R:  They were, you know, illegal aliens doing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- our --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- security checks, which is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, what's wrong with this picture?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah, their friends could be the ones who, ah, yeah.
R:  Exactly.  Well, I -- I -- I think that part of it really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, eases my mind that they actually have accountability about who is working there.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So --
L:  Definitely.
R:  I- -- it's, I would imagine, very important to m- to [inaudible] that the person --
L:  Yeah, it -- it -- it always amazes because nobody wants to do these [inaudible] security jobs, nobody wants to be the night watchman, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- all that kind of stuff and w- -- and so people are always shocked when they find out who is the night watchman because nobody wanted that job so they had to find somebody.  So ...
R:  Because they -- they really didn't make a big deal about, um, you know, other than that it was, um, part of the homeland security --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that it was federal, these workers were federal workers now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they didn't make a big deal about how they -- how did they entice people to do such a job?
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  Did they automatically -- you didn't have a choice if you were a federal worker in the justice department.
L:  Well, my guess is the economy was going down, so it probably wasn't too difficult for it [inaudible].
R:  Oh, that's true [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  All -- all the dotcomers are now --
L:  Right, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Screening bags for their, 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, the friends who did -- whose dotcoms didn't fail --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and are going off to other -- to California for some reason.  That's a funny thought.  I like that one.
R:  Uh.  It's -- I think it was, what, um, what is the new AOL? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  The Time Warner thing.
R:  Yeah, right [LAUGH].  Welcome to our x ray machine [LAUGH]
L:  There you go [LAUGH].  Oh, no.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  I think we've done more than ten minutes, but I don't think the robot is getting through correctly.  Because --
L:  Well, I don't think we've been ten minutes.
R:  No?
L:  I can't remember.
R:  I thought we did.  I thought we started at three.
L:  I know the first time I -- the first time, I've only done three of these calls, the first time we both thought that it had been ten minutes and so we hung and then the next time, the second time, the robot came in and I'm like, oh, there's a robot that's telling me what time it's done.  Oops.
R:  The first one we never heard.  The second one I heard and now this one, I ca- -- I don't know.
L:  It could just be interference on the line, though, that it could not have any --
R:  Yeah, we have bad weather in Washington DC right now.
L:  Yeah.  We have really, drippy rainy stuff here, too, we're in, um, -- I'm in, ah, near Pittsburgh, so ...
R:  Oh, you're right around the corner.  I'm in Maryland, actually.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, yes, it -- so, do you fly out of what airport?
L:  Um, now I fly out of Pittsburgh, I just moved from Massachusetts, so I was flying out of Hartford.
R:  Hartford.
L:  I don't fly out of Logan.
R:  Uh huh.  Nobody --
L:  In Boston.
R:  -- wants -- that's like going JF- -- JFK.
L:  Although I did just fly to Logan in, um, this fall in October --
R:  Uh huh.
L:  Because, um, I had a conference in Boston, but if you're just going to the airport and taking a taxi to the conference, then it's not the same.  Because getting to Logan, Logan is in the middle of the city on the water --
R:  Oh.  You don't have a choice.
L:  Yeah.  So, you have to go through all the downtown traffic and everything horrible to get out.  Which is --
R:  That's almost like, um, what's called Reagan National now, used to be the Washington International Airport.
L:  Yes.  Yeah.
R:  That's impossible to get out of.  
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  That's why most people -- I'm surprised it's still open.  It's open because of the senators and congressmen --
L:  Yes.
R:  --that's the only reason  really, to tell you the truth.
L:  They've talked about closing it a bunch of times, especially after that guy drove into the White House --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- with the airplane.
R:  So -- so, um, most of the people, well
