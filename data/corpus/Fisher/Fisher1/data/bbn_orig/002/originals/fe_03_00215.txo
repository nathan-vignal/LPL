L:  Hi.  My name's Eugene.
R:  Hey, I'm Jamal.
L:  Hi, nice to meet you.
R:  How you doing?
L:  Okay.  Uh, how are you?
R:  I'm doing quite well.  Um, the question again is, um, um, what do you look for in a partner?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  How long do we have -- do we have to talk about this?
L:  Um, I think fifteen minutes.
R:  Fifteen minutes?
L:  Or something like that.
R:  Oh, my God. [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible].  Um, well, I -- I guess I could start off.  And I -- I -- I got married about a year and a half ago, so it's kinda still fresh in my mind, this whole thing.
R:  Oh, that's nice, so I -- I can -- I can learn from you then, okay?
L:  [LAUGH] Are you -- you still -- you're still not married?
R:  No, still not married.
L:  Okay.  Where -- where are you from?
R:  Oh, Maryland.
L:  Maryland?  Okay, I'm in, uh, New York.
R:  Oh, New York?  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh, so you got married about a year ago, okay?
L:  Sorry?
R:  How long have you known -- how -- known your wife for?
L:  Before -- before I got married, um, we dated for about six, seven months, something like that.
R:  Uh-huh, that's great.
L:  Actually, it was kinda funny, yeah.  It's -- it's like one of those things like when you know it's the right person you kinda know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, you know, so far things have worked out, so, yeah, so we met and, like, kind of hit it off and basically decided to get married, like, a few months later.
R:  Have you b- been married before?
L:  No, no, this is my first time.
R:  Oh, okay.  How old are you?
L:  I'm twenty six.
R:  Twenty six, okay.  Uh, that's about --
L:  Yeah, so I was twenty five, something, when --
R:  Yeah, so that's -- that's, uh -- that's, uh --
L:  It's like average, right.
R:  So, y- you guys were not friends before or anything like that?
L:  No, no, we just -- it was a blind date.  I mean, our friends set us up, so, like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they kind of knew, you know, both of us, so it worked out.
R:  All right, well, that's good, that's good.  So, w- what -- again, this -- I'm trying to stick -- to stick to the subject.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What, um, what did you look for be- -- what did you, uh, look for, um, in a wife --
L:  Well --
R:  -- so to speak, and what did you see in her?
L:  Sure.  Um, well, uh, let's see.  So, I -- so, I'm -- I'm P.C. student, right, so I'm hav- -- gonna be eventually, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I'm in school, so I -- I was looking for some- somebody -- you know, for somebody in the same kind of social station also, like, a student or going into school or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So that, you know, we could kind of be in the same stage in life, you know?
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  And, um, you know, do, like, kind of share my, um, like, religious beliefs and, you know, my kind of, you know -- probably like -- m- more like, you know, like, interests, like sports and -- and, um, you know, movies and books and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, but that was kind of less important than, you know, looks.  Looks made a difference. [LAUGH] I mean, if you can't be attracted to someone then --
R:  Mhm, yeah.  Mhm.
L:  -- it's kind of -- kinda -- you know, there's no point in -- in -- in pursuing.
R:  So, one thing that -- that was a -- an important factor was that you pretty much had to --
L:  It was- -- it wasn't necessarily a precondition, right?  So, like, if -- if I didn't see myself being, you know, interested in a person -- I mean, there's -- there's two things, right, interested in a person as -- as a person, you know, to talk to and also as a person to, you know, to be my future wife.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I just didn't wanna -- you know, there was no point in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in -- in pursuing the relationship.
R:  And so, um --
L:  Beyond, like, you know, just getting together.
R:  Hm.  So, if you met -- if I understand you correctly, um, it was important that you both be in the same, um -- going through the same thing, so to speak?
L:  Yeah, more or less.
R:  Than have --
L:  Right, right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I- I- it's funny, actually, 'cause she -- she's a little older than me, a couple of years older.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I -- I didn't know that.  You know, I didn't --
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  -- realize it when I -- when I -- when I -- we just first met.  I mean, it came out a few -- a few --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a few days later.  But, you know, it was actually kind of funny, like, um, how things worked out.
R:  Hm.
L:  But, yeah, I was -- it -- it -- it's like, um -- so, I -- like, I've -- I've dated women that they were, like, you know, in the professional world, you know?
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Like doing, you know, working for a few years and stuff.  And that just -- you know, it just had different kind of schedules --
R:  Priorities, so to speak, yeah.
L:  Priorities, exactly, yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  How 'bout yourself?  Are you, like -- are you in- involved in, like, a long term thing or ...?
R:  [SIGH] Ah, yeah.  Um, it's actually, um, one of my good friends, um, we've been friends for about two years now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so, uh, I think we're beginning to -- beginning to really click and stuff.
L:  Cool.
R:  And so, um, [MN] let's see, I don't -- s- still haven't reached the stage where we're gonna explore anything, or at least not yet.
L:  I see.
R:  But, uh, we're mak- -- maybe my guess that I'm taking my time, we're taking our time because we don't wanna mess it up, if you will, at the m- -- bef- --
L:  Sure.  H- h- how -- how old are you?  How old are you, if, uh, you don't mind?
R:  I'm thirty two.
L:  Cool, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  S- so, w- w- what are you looking for or were you looking for?
R:  Well, um, [SIGH] uh, it's really difficult to say, but I do look -- look for, um, uh, certain things, and one -- one thing that you -- you, uh, um -- I'm looking for someone that's pretty much in the -- living the same type of lifestyle.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, and going through pretty much the same l- -- we can say going through same difficulties or -- or enjoying the same -- same things.
L:  Sure.
R:  That way it's easier, um, like you said, um, if you have a regular job and, uh, your -- your -- your wife is -- is student or a -- a -- a medical --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- student or a doctor.  Otherwise it's -- it's too different.  And, um, the lifestyle is obviously very different.  I can always, uh, try and work things out but it's going to be, um, extremely hard and it's not going to be an easy thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I also try and, uh, and find someone, um -- let's put it not exactly, um, same religion as I am --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but something -- something that -- somewhere -- place where we're not going to clash.
L:  I see.
R:  Uh, yeah, or be -- if not --
L:  Sort of, like, backgrounds?
R:  -- if -- exactly.  If not -- if not us per se, but maybe our families, our friends and this -- and this and that.  Some relig- -- um, religions obviously don't get along for whatever reason.
L:  Sure.
R:  But we -- you know, I -- I would rather just avoid this -- this, uh -- this kind of situation because no one wins that way.  [SIGH] Um ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, I obviously look for someone definitely, um, educated and someone -- someone that's kind of mellow that can work things out.  Things are not going to be always, uh, great and nice --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and what have you, but someone who's gonna -- who understands that and will be willing to, uh, you know, to, uh, um, uh, try and work out th- through the rough times, you know.
L:  I see.  Yeah, you sound like a wise man. [LAUGH] It, uh, it's like --
R:  As -- as -- [LAUGH] as opposed to when things are rough.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know, it's -- you know, have to go separate ways.  I mean, if -- if it comes down to it, fine, but I want -- I need someone that's gonna -- that I'm gonna make sure that we have exhausted every -- every possibility before we could [NOISE] --
L:  I understand.
R:  -- we could -- we could do that.
L:  That sounds -- that sounds [inaudible] 'cause, uh, like, I can remember when it -- planning the wedding, that's, like, really stressful, so that -- that -- that really was, like, a big test.  Like, it's one over -- you know, it was a test of -- of, you know -- 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- 'cause, uh, things just -- because the families, you know, clashing and everything and it's just --
R:  But one thing I -- I will do.  You date -- and I think this is a matter of, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- style or -- or maybe a matter of conviction, uh, six months wouldn't be enough time for me, but I'm not saying that --
L:  I see.
R:  -- you know, it may be enough time for -- for, uh, uh, um, [MN] I think just like you said, it's just how you feel about the person.
L:  Actually, I think it was more like nine months, but, uh, now that I think about it.
R:  Okay.
L:  We -- we met in January.  We got married in September, so ...
R:  Okay.  Well, nine months, yeah, okay.  Okay.
L:  So, it's still -- it's still not that long, and --
R:  Right.  But I think it -- but I think it -- I don't think it's so much the time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that -- that -- that -- that's the deciding factor, but rather the experiences, you know.
L:  Sure.
R:  If you've known someone for two years, you haven't done much together, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- you could of known someone for only six months and you've gone through quite a bit and that's -- that's -- that's usually -- er, by then you've had enough to go with.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, in -- in terms of, uh, marriage and things like that.  So, um, so once again the whole, uh, um, time thing is really subject to what you have done together during that time.
L:  Sure.  Yeah, it's funny how they do those -- you know those, like, shows like Blind Date and, like, Who Wants to Marry, like, a Millionaire?  Like, a bachelor or something?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's -- it's kinda funny to watch, right?  I mean, like this -- and -- and, like, what do you think those people are looking for?
R:  What --
L:  You know, on those -- on those, like, Blind Date shows and stuff?
R:  Oh, Blind -- I'm sorry --
L:  I mean, have you ever seen any -- any of them?
R:  Ah, every now and then.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And what was the question again?
L:  Uh, I don't -- the question -- my -- my question was that it -- uh, just it was more of a comment that it's like, um, it's really funny to see people on TV t- trying to --
R:  Oh, oh.  Well, I think most of th- -- most of those people are just there for fun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They don't care.  They're -- I highly doubt any of them wants to --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- uh, pursue anything seriously from going there.
L:  Sure.
R:  Just wanna go have fun, chill and then I think that's -- that's exactly what happens usually.  So, you rarely see anything materialize out of that, out of these kinda shows.  And so, uh, but hey, as long as they're having fun, you know, let them -- you know, let them be.  And, um --
L:  Sure.
R:  So, have you -- have you talked -- how important is it, um, when it comes to kids?  How important is it to talk about that before marriage?
L:  Um, I think it's very important and we did discuss it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, at some -- when we started getting serious.  And, um, you know, we both kinda had a similar idea, wanted, you know, two or three kids at some point and, uh, um, and, yeah, we definitely wanted kids, like, relatively soon and ...
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, my father teasing me, uh, like, uh, five.  No, five's too many. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like, I -- so, I just celebrated my birthday and so one of the wishes -- a few wishes were, you know, getting married, so especially at thirty two everybody's on my back now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I wish you were, uh, this and that and five kids.  And hey, hey, I ain't training -- coaching no basketball team right now, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  Which, um -- like, high school or ...?
R:  Pardon?
L:  High school or ...?
R:  What high school?
L:  I mean, one that you're coaching?  Your basketball team?
R:  Oh, no, no, no, no.  My friends telling me they wish me have five kids.
L:  I see.
R:  When I get married.
L:  Oh, so you could coach -- I see.
R:  I said, "Look, I'm not trying to coach basketball team here" so ...
L:  Oh, I see.  That's funny.  Okay.
R:  So, it's okay, uh, two, maybe three, let's see, we'll see.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, uh, in due time, though.
L:  Yeah.  This is -- this is something that, like -- I -- I mean it's definitely important but, um, you know, and once -- th- this is something that I think comes after, you know -- I mean, in my opinion, um, we're -- we're planning to wait, you know, maybe a year or two more, like we'll, you know --
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  -- we work out all our differences first before we get kids involved.
R:  Not only that, plus you get a rhythm, so to speak.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Also get a rhythm for marriage, so to speak, and --
L:  Right, right.  It's -- it's very different, you know, when we were d- --
R:  Get used to each other and --
L:  Yeah.  Because --
R:  You know, come to terms with the fact that you will be together, you know, for --
L:  Right, see, because, I mean, things are some -- you know, were kind of a little stressful with the first few months as it was, right.
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  You know what I mean?  Like, when --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  So, it's -- it -- we just, you know, [MN] it -- it's like -- and -- and also you don't wanna, like, put potentially, you know, children in a situation of where, you know, you know, if things go terribly wrong and we end up, you know, splitting up, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you don't wanna get the kids in the picture, so --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  We wanna be, like, you know, totally, like, work out everything, you know, conceivable, you know, but --
R:  A probation period, so to speak. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  So, yeah, so we're almost -- you know, we have, like, what, a little over a year left, um.  Well, actually a little under a year left in our probation period, so [LAUGH] okay.
R:  Oh, that's good.  That's good.  And so how long have you been married right now, you said?
L:  About a year now.
R:  About a year.  Okay, that's good.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  How was -- how was the first year so far?
L:  Um, the first few months were rough, but now things are getting better.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, things are -- things are good.  And it's, like, we've never lived together and, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- we have all our idio- -- you know, our little idiosyncrasies and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, but, um, like, for example, I tend to work very late, you know, until, like, three, four, five in the morning, and --
R:  Whoa.
L:  -- my wife didn't like that so much, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  What, are you -- what, are you in the computer business or something?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Okay. [NOISE]
L:  So, I've -- so we've just spent some time trying to work out, you know, our schedules and everything, so ...
R:  Mhm, mm.  You [inaudible] -- you write code, is that what you do?
L:  Yeah.
