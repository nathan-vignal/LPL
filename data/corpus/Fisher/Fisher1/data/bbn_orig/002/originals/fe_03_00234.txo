L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  This is Sarah.  Who's this?
L:  This is Jennifer.  [LAUGH]
R:  What's your name?
L:  Jennifer.
R:  Hi, Jennifer.  Uh, nice to talk to you.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I've been waitin' on the phone for a while to see if I could --
L:  Oh, I didn't even know what it was when it rang.
R:  Yeah.  So, what are we supposed to talk about?  Life partners?
L:  Yes, and so what you --
R:  It's -- this is kinda weird.
L:  -- look for.
R:  Yeah, I guess so.  So, um, are you in a serious relationship or anything?
L:  No, I'm -- are you?
R:  No, I'm not, no.  I have a -- you know, there's pos- there's a possible prospect, but not really so --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Where -- where're you from or where are you?
L:  Oklahoma.
R:  Oklaho- [LAUGH] I'm in New York.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh [LAUGH] wow!
R:  This is kinda funny.  So, um, okay, well, uh, what do you look for in your life partner?
L:  Uh [LAUGH] someone that, um, I don't know, responsible ... tough really.  So, what about you?
R:  Mm [LIPSMACK].  I would say -- I would say those two things and, um [LIPSMACK] I would say well, they have -- they have to be able to match me, and so I have, um, I have really good role models as far as life partners go, because my parents have been married for thirty two years --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so ... I would like to find someone that I would, you know, for a life partner, you know, like some- [inaudible] like someone I would get married with but also that I would have like -- that after a long time, you know, they would still be good.  So, I'd like to have someone that's ... [SIGH] you know, like you have a potential to just really love for a really long time and they're very open ... and, um, communicative and, uh ... yeah, I think that would probably be some of it.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  [LAUGH] Sorry, [several inaudible words] in a room with friends.  I couldn't hear you.
R:  What did you say?
L:  [LAUGH] I just couldn't hear you.  I was in my room with some friends.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH] And so, um -- no.  Yes, those are things I look for.  My parents were divorced when I was fifteen and so I want someone who is very trustful and that --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- relates to me.  [SIGH] And so -- but I want to be older when I get married 'cause they were young.
R:  Really.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, my -- my par- my mother was twenty one and my dad was, uh -- my dad was, um, thirty five.
L:  Oh, my god!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and they're still married after thirty- thirty three years, thirty two years.
L:  That's amazing and so that's what I want, and so -- 'cause they were about eighteen --
R:  Ah, but if you're --
L:  They were together a long time but ... I want someone that I can trust and that's -- that's a lot like me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so -- because I want someone who is like back and we have our own lives but we have a life together.
R:  That's a good -- how old are you?
L:  I'm twenty.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm --
L:  So, how old are you?
R:  I'm -- I'm twenty- twenty four.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so how long were we supposed to talk about this?
R:  I have no idea.
L:  I don't either.  [LAUGH]
R:  I have no idea.  But I think this -- well, the whole study is like talking about how people ... like deal in conversation where they don't know.  So, I guess they're kind of trying to study how people -- like the equivalent of like how people meet each other or how they start conversations or, you know, like a ... um, I don't know.  You know, I guess it would be like -- like, uh, how people, um [LIPSMACK] you know, like if a guy is gonna hit on a girl or a girl's gonna hit on a guy, they have to start somewhere.  You know, so maybe they're kind of starting that.
L:  That's true.
R:  That kinda of [several inaudible words] --
L:  And so, see I didn't even know what it was about.  My psychology adviser ... um [LAUGH] sent it to me and was like, "Sign up for this" and so ... I thought it would be a good thing and so I --
R:  Yeah, you get paid money -- we get paid money for it so ...
L:  I know!  That's what I thought was so interesting.
R:  I know.  It's like, I'll sit here and wait --
L:  For not doing very much.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I went in with a thousand dollars, but we should [inaudible] --
L:  Oh, I know!  [LAUGH] I was [inaudible]
R:  [inaudible] [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  That's exciting.  So, how did you find out about it?
R:  Um, my friends -- my -- one of my other graduate student friends sent me an email.
L:  Ah, are you a psychology graduate student?
R:  Yes.  Yes, I am.
L:  Oh, okay.  And so -- yeah, I would like to be.  [LAUGH]
R:  You would like to be?
L:  I would like to be out if I could find undergraduate work.
R:  Yeah, it's pretty great.  I like it a lot.
L:  Really?  And where in New York do you live?
R:  I live ... um, women -- I live -- you know, I go to N.Y.U. so I --
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  Yes.
L:  I almost went to undergraduate school there.
R:  You -- you almost went there for undergraduate?
L:  Yes, and so, um ... [MN] I was actually going to major in public relations before I went and so ... I ended up changing my mind and coming to Oklahoma and so ...
R:  And where are you from originally?
L:  Oh, I'm from Texas --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and so, I'm going to probably go to ... Boston or New York when I graduate next year.  Do you like it there?
R:  I do.  I really love it.  I'm from California and I went to school in northern California.  I grew up in southern California so ...
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  I really like it.
L:  I was -- I really want to move there ... and so, I think it'd be very interesting and so -- so what are -- is every time we make a call it's gonna be a different subject?
R:  Yeah, I think so.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, every time -- every time I talk --
L:  Oh, interesting.
R:  Yeah.  So, if -- let's see if I can think of anything else for us --
L:  What else?  [several inaudible words]
R:  [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] I don't want them to get this and be like, "Oh, great.  They just sit there and talk about themselves a little bit or whatever".
L:  I know.  [LAUGH] So, are you gonna --
R:  Um --
L:  Um, are you -- do you want to be married soon or would you rather be older?
R:  Oh, I mean, I wanna be married soon.  Like, I would definitely like to have -- is it -- I like to have the security of having like that person, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- kind of like done and met and accounted for.  And I could -- you know, I could go for having an extended engagement or something like that.  But, um, I really, you know, like ... I, um, I'm -- I'm set on having a family and a career and, um, I'm gonna really try and balance them.  And so, of course, you know, what I would -- one of the things I would look for in a life partner would be ... like, flexibility to let me do that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and like support and everything and, uh [SIGH] and so ... but I don't wanna wait too long, you know --
L:  Would you want him to take care of your children?
R:  Oh, no, no, no.  I'd want us both to take care of --
L:  You want him both too?
R:  Yeah, you know, a joint effort.  And, um ... [LIPSMACK] and so [several inaudible words] because I'm als- because an intelligent female, I'd have to -- I would have to -- what I would look for in a life partner would be someone who is not threatened by that.
L:  Yes --
R:  And, uh, you know, it's like you get your PhD and -- and you just wait, you'll figure it out even more as you rise in the -- in the intellectual circles, you're like -- you meet guys and just like they're not ... like, they -- some people -- they're really nice guys but they just have trouble with really smart gir- you know [SIGH] so ...
L:  Right, I understand that.  See, I want someone who is intelligent also, that doesn't want children because I want us to both have our own careers.
R:  So, you don't wanna have kids?
L:  I do not, no.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  And I want someone who doesn't either.  Like, maybe when I'm older I might want to adopt one ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but not 'til I'm old.  [LAUGH]
R:  Why don't you want to have kids?
L:  I -- I wanna work.  And I don't -- I don't wanna have a nanny ... fulltime and I really like to travel and ... [LIPSMACK] I just felt --
R:  What if you just [several inaudible words].
L:  I don't see -- I don't think I'd want them when I was older either.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.  [LIPSMACK] My parents waited ten years until they had kids.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, they were married for ten years before they had kids.  I think that's a good path to take a little bit -- you know?
L:  Yeah.  I just don't wanna marry someone who like really wants them because if I don't ever change my mind then ... I just want to be flexible with the idea.  If we have 'em we have 'em, if we don't, then we don't.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't want it to be a ... [SIGH] a bit thing, you know?  If one of us decides we want to that the other one will be open to the idea, but I don't want it to be, like, "Oh, we're getting married, we're having kids" you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that -- I don't want it to be like that and I want to live in a big city and I wouldn't want to raise kids in a big city so ...
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I live in some really small town and I think -- I don't know.  I wanna marry someone from a small town but I want us to live together in a big city.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'm sor- I just don't want kids and so --
R:  I was -- I was raised in a medium sized town --
L:  Really?
R:  And, uh, yeah -- and I live -- I live in a big town right now ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I'm not, like ... but I can't -- like, Manhattan is like really intense and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I actually live in Brooklyn and I love like -- one of the boroughs.  I love going home very night to, like, Brooklyn for there's, like, real streets and ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and like families and all that kinda stuff, and so, um ... yeah, I could never raise my kids in actual, like, Manhattan, but, um, I really like Brooklyn.
L:  No, I li- but I'd just live in an apartment in the middle of Manhattan.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, do you wanna live ...? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] And so with no children and with someone who works all the time and will have ... [MN] work for -- work things to go to and social things to go to and just no children to worry about.
R:  Mm.
L:  And so I just want someone who works a lot.
R:  [LAUGH] But has time for you.
L:  [LAUGH] Yes, but has time for me, exactly.
R:  Hm.
L:  And so -- and so [MN] yes, is there any other questions you have about it or ...?
R:  [SIGH] Um ...
L:  [inaudible] talk about?
R:  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, I don't really know.  I mean, I want, uh ... I guess all the other thi- the other thing I would say is that how people ... like, um, [MN] what I would want in a life partner is someone who was ... like ready and willing to try really hard --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because, like as much as my parents have been together for thirty two years, and like, everything is great with them, you -- you know that, like, love is no piece of cake as it is in the movies ... and that you have to like really work your butt off to make it work, and so I'd want someone who was dedicated and willing to, like ... you know, [SIGH] make sure everything ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- pans out basically.
L:  Mm-mm.  I want someone who gets along with my friends.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's always really important to me because all my life, mm, the people I have been with have been friends --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I want my husband and my life partner to be a friend, you know, and have been friends with my friends and ... because I mean, if they should pass away, then I still wanna have my friends to fall back on and ... you know, not just my husband.  Like, my grandparents, like, they have no friends.  They just have each other.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, like, when one of them dies, the other one's not gonna have anything to do and I --
R:  Yeah, that -- that's --
L:  -- and I don't want it to be like that.
R:  -- that's -- that's close to my parents in some respects, but in other respects it's not so ...
L:  Right.
R:  But, yeah, I -- I definitely want -- I definitely want my significant other to be my best friend.
L:  Oh, yes.  Me too and so -- but I just want us to be able to have like a larger social group outside of just the two of us.
R:  That's healthy.
L:  Yeah, and so ...
R:  That's definitely healthy.
L:  -- I don't know.  I don't want it to be like my parents though where they never ever saw each other and they both have their own friends and that was it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  And so, I just want it to be in between.
R:  [LAUGH] I have a hard time fathom- like, fathoming like what it must have been like --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- because I know so many people that have had their parents' divorce, so I'm just like, I have no idea.
L:  Right.
R:  I have like a Bill Cosby kind of like "Leave it to Beaver" family.
L:  [LAUGH] It must be nice.
R:  Not quite, I'm being -- I'm exaggerating but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm exaggerating.
L:  [LAUGH] No.
R:  Sometimes it feels like that.
L:  Oh, that would be nice and so, no, I don't really want that family and I don't really want the family that I grew up in.  I just want somewhere in between.  And so -- with no children.
R:  That sounds pretty good.  [LAUGH] And with no children.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  One of my best friends [inaudible] too.  She doesn't want to have any kids and she's like and her -- and her boyfriend that she was with for a really long time, really wanted to and so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's one of the reasons they broke up.
L:  See, I -- I don't think I would date someone seriously that would not want children -- I mean, that did want children --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I wouldn't want it to come down to that, whether we were going to be together or not.
R:  My -- my brother's going through the same thing because he's been with his girlfriend for, like, oh god, ten years -- over ten years.
L:  Oh, Lord.
R:  And I think the reason -- and they, like, they bought a house together and all that kind so they're committed but I think one of the reasons that they're not actually married is that ... he kinda wants to have kids and she's absolutely against it.
L:  Right.  See, I don't want that to come between me and someone.  I want it to just be an option but if we don't then it's not gonna break us up.
R:  But -- well, I think he would like it to be an option too, but it's not even an option [LAUGH] so ...
L:  Oh, it's not?
R:  Right.
L:  Um --
R:  She was, like, "No" and I think it's for other reasons, like, besides, like, you know, like, having trouble, um ... it's not like she had a horrible childhood, whereas my friend [inaudible] didn't have the greatest childhood and kind of, uh, I think that's one of the reasons, but Annette doesn't want to like disfigure herself.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  She wants to like stay beautiful, so I'm, like, "Oh, my god" ...
L:  I used to be in that --
