L:  Hi, my name's Amina.
R:  Hi, my name is Judy.
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh ... so ... what is the most important thing about finding a life partner?  Um ...
R:  That's a hard one, isn't it?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Some things are obvious, uh ... I guess good with kids, good with, uh -- good at communicating and ...
R:  Right, good at communication.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Understanding.
L:  Yeah, um ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, let's see ...
R:  [SIGH] Okay, there's gotta be a lot of it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause this is a pretty broad topic.
L:  I guess -- I guess, uh, faithful or at least willing to ... sort of ... come to an agreement and stick with it.
R:  Right.  I would imagine, having a sense of humor, being fun.
L:  Yes.
R:  If you enjoy being around the person.
L:  And -- and interesting, I guess.
R:  And interesting, right.  Although interesting -- I guess interesting is different to different people, right?
L:  Of course, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Huh.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  Let's see, um ...
R:  I guess, um, how -- how important do you think it is to have ... common interests or ... common, I don't know, common factors --
L:  Um --
R:  -- like religion or -- or interests -- political interests?
L:  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, I -- I would say that it's pretty important but I've seen some, uh, some funny couples, I guess, that seem to have pretty opposite ... uh ... I mean, I don't know how well that -- [LAUGH] what that always works or not, but I mean, I've seen people with ... very different religions and ... different political views so ...
R:  Mhm.  But in that case you said it would be important to be very tolerant?
L:  Yeah, I mean -- yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Wouldn't want to be with somebody who's, uh ...
R:  Uh ... [LAUGH]
L:  -- always imaging that you're going out or something like that.
R:  That's true.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, let's see ... [LIPSMACK] Hm ...
R:  I'm trying to think what else.
L:  [several inaudible words] you said.
R:  I know.  This is ... this is [LAUGH] a little difficult.
L:  [LAUGH] This feels like a brainstorming session.  Ah, well ... um ... hm ... [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I don't know.  Poss- I mean --
R:  How -- how important do you think age would be?
L:  Um, like being a similar age?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, it's probably pretty important although again ... probably exceptions as well.
R:  Right.
L:  Um ... I mean for some people money is very important also but I don't ... I don't necessarily think that's the most important thing.
R:  Well, I think it's very hard.  I mean, it'd be hard for -- for me to say what's important be- I mean, what's important to me --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but it depends so much a- and my ideas change all the time.
L:  Yeah.  I- yeah, this is -- this is true also.  Um ...
R:  Um, I -- and it depends ability [LAUGH].  Sometimes it depends on my mood.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I --
L:  Yeah, yeah, or, uh ...
R:  So, it -- it just changes.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I'm widowed so ... and I -- and I'm -- I mean, I have friends [LAUGH] but I don't have a life partner right now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've been with him for a while, but -- so it -- so I think that what was important to me at one point is not so important now.  Depends on how lonely I am.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  In terms of what I would be willing to accept.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I mean this is true also ... or what people are looking for are different --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ways.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] [LAUGH] Yeah, since -- yeah, I'm -- I'm sort of on and off dating.  I was just ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it depends who I've just broken up with basically.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words]
L:  Uh ...
R:  Then you're probably more familiar with what you don't want.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible] easier question to answer.  Mm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah, I'm trying to think what else.  I guess geographical prox- well ...
L:  Then again, there are exceptions but ...
R:  We meet somebody -- I'm sorry?
L:  Yeah, it's meeting somebody or -- I mean, I think it's hard to maintain some things in a long period of time over ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, for a while I can work I think.
R:  [SIGH] Or people do that too.  [LAUGH]
L:  It's true.  There are exceptions to every rule, I guess.
R:  There are and there're some people who even -- I -- I mean, I've heard people on television or whatever who've said that -- that they should beat the longevity of the relationship to [LAUGH] whether or not they're together.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I can -- I can buy that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I ca- [LAUGH].  Yeah.  No, I mean, I guess everybody has a different -- different set of things that they want from a relationship so ...
R:  Mm.
L:  And of course, some people don't even want a life partnership at all so ...
R:  Right.
L:  One if ...
R:  And it's interesting that they're using that term.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I guess they're trying to be ... as inclusive as possible with them.
R:  Right.  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, it's interesting.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There's something else.  Somebody who's of the same sexual orientation as you are is ...
R:  Right, okay that's ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That would be important, wouldn't it?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess, have the same goals ... although you can change your goals, yo- and goals change.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I guess flexibility is also important I guess.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think that's very important.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If you were to rank them, how would you rank them?
L:  How would I rank them?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess sort of impor- communication is pretty important and I guess flexibility as well because --
R:  Mm.
L:  I think that ... like we were saying, people change in what they want and need over time so ... you just have to be able to [inaudible] the things and ... I mean, lots of different things happen to people so ...
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, but you're -- I think you're right in terms of negotiation and ... openness.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Being able to listen to somebody else, hear other people's ideas.  That's tolerance too.
L:  Yeah, I mean, it's ... yeah, it's really I guess important too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh ... [LAUGH]
R:  I know.
L:  Just trying to, uh ... uh ... yeah, I don't know.
R:  Trying to think.
L:  I guess this would be easier if, you know, one of us had very like ... [SIGH] there must be a, you know ... there must be at least a multimillionaire to be suitable and then we could argue about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it's much more interesting.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, um [LIPSMACK] try to think what else.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Oh, was it -- and this sounds strange, but I know somebody who met someone and they didn't speak the language.  [LAUGH]
L:  That was actually the situation with my parents when they first met.  [LAUGH]
R:  Was it?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but, um, they kind of learnt a little bit.
R:  But they worked it out, huh?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  But, th- [LAUGH] But that could end up being -- I mean, that could end up being an impediment.
L:  Yeah.  Definitely.  [LAUGH]
R:  Especially if you don't wanna work on that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And also if it's culturally an impediment if -- again ...
L:  Yeah, and I mean there are all kinds of cultural --
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, maybe the religious thing sometimes more is a problem as not between the two people who are in love but, uh ... the social and cultural expectations of the people around them.
R:  Right.
L:  So ... things can be difficult --
R:  Mm.
L:  But of course ... I'm sure we all know people who [LAUGH] have dealt with that stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um ... hm ... [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] I'm trying to think what else.  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess people who are ... sort of together and you know, not drug out addicts or alcoholics --
R:  Right.
L: -- or things like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible].  Yeah, again [LAUGH] I have a clear idea of things I don't want in a ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh ... well ... [LIPSMACK] huh ...
R:  It's -- in -- I -- I find that -- that, um [LIPSMACK] having the same political belief, I find that to be a real obstacle if you don't.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  I ... I mean, I've never ... been with somebody that has had very radically different bel- I mean, slightly different but not very ...
R:  Mm.
L:  But I guess -- I guess that that's true but I have sometimes have har- I can -- I can talk to people of different political beliefs but it kind of gets of my nerves of time so ...
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- yeah, I guess that ... [SIGH]
R:  No, I just recently met somebody who is much more conservative than I am --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I find that really difficult because, um, he expresses himself in ways that I'm not comfortable.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And -- and just in general, I mean, about people, about life.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's kinda --
R:  Not everything but it -- it's really, um, strange to relate to that.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I found it hard to relate to it.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I would find that and -- and I guess that goes back to the sort of ... tolerance thing [inaudible] as well.
R:  Mm.  [LIPSMACK] Right, and it depends on how important it is.  I mean ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] I mean, these are political times so I guess it's --
L:  Yeah, exactly.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- these times feel very political.  [LAUGH] [inaudible].
L:  If you could spend your life with somebody who's [inaudible] but you just have to spend some time apart during the election season or whatever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, um ... that reminded me of something but I can't remember what it was.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Huh.  Gotta have somebody -- I mean, this is -- this is just me, this isn't in general, but you gotta have somebody who, uh, likes cats because otherwise ... I come with a cat so ...
R:  Oh [LAUGH].  I have a friend who's going through that, that's why I'm laughing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He -- he's just met somebody and he -- he doesn't like her cat --
L:  Oh no!  [LAUGH]
R:  And she's feeling very upset by [LAUGH].  She really is.  No, seriously she is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, uh -- he -- if she had to make a decision between her cat and him ... she might choose the cat.
L:  Yeah, I mean, it's -- it's tough not -- and especially when you've just met somebody too.  It's kind of like ... I'm not sure.  I've been with the cat for, you know, ten years and, hm ... [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] You can count on a cat!  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.  So, I guess you have to have those types of interest too, and it's -- it's helpful to have those types of interests.
L:  Yeah.  And I guess some people are just ... I mean, I find some people are just in general easy going and some people are in general more ...
R:  Mm.
L:  -- uptight.  They like to have things a particular way, a particular, you know ...
R:  Mm.
L:  Everything in a -- I think it's easier to be with somebody who's ... again, flexibility.
R:  Yeah.  But it -- I think that's when ... if somebody's more like -- if you're like each other --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's easier -- uh, oh, it's easier to understand each other.
L:  Yeah, and easier to be flexible but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, everybody's flexible within a certain range so ... [SIGH] it's just that you're closer to the ... [SIGH] hm.
R:  Yeah.  But then -- then again ... it could also have, uh [LIPSMACK] if you have something negative that you have in common.  My -- my husband was really messy and I'm really messy and that was --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- a great thing to have in common.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] yeah.
R:  So, we had a very messy house.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [several inaudible words].  We were real comfortable with it.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Other people weren't.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Yeah, I guess that's true as well. 
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Again, I mean, it -- it seems so individual what -- what each person needs or ... or wants.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's hard to make ...
R:  Yeah, what -- what [LIPSMACK] ... again, in terms of priority, what are you willing to give --
