OTHER IMPORTANT THING ABOUT GOING OUT TO EAT IS MAKING (fe_03_02169-B-0020)
SURE IT'S IN YOUR PRICE RANGE (fe_03_02169-B-0021)

SO I'M LIKE (fe_03_02169-B-0043)
USUALLY STUFFED SO I THINK THAT OVERALL GOING TO A NORMAL (fe_03_02169-B-0044)
RESTAURANT WHERE YOU COULD JUST GET ONE MEAL (fe_03_02169-B-0045)
IS BETTER FOR ME BECAUSE I I JUST (fe_03_02169-B-0046)
GET ONE PORTION INSTEAD OF LIKE THREE (fe_03_02169-B-0047)
OR FOUR (fe_03_02169-B-0048)
SO THAT'S JUST (fe_03_02169-B-0049)
MY OWN (fe_03_02169-B-0050)
PERSONAL (fe_03_02169-B-0051)
