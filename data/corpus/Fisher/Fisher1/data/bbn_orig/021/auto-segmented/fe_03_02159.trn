EATING SOMEONE ELSE'S FOOD  (fe_03_02159-B-0006)

YEAH  (fe_03_02159-B-0010)
YEAH I'VE UH UH I'VE GONE THAT ROAD BUT IT'S IT'S PROBABLY RARE AND AND ONLY BECAUSE  (fe_03_02159-B-0012)
NOT HAVING CHILDREN  (fe_03_02159-B-0013)
ONE MEAL  (fe_03_02159-B-0015)
UH WHICH I YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW NEVER HAVING CHILDREN I UH  (fe_03_02159-B-0016)
I MEAN I'VE NEVER COOKED FOR THEM  (fe_03_02159-B-0017)
WELL  (fe_03_02159-B-0019)
YEAH I EXPECT THERE WOULD BE SOME OF THAT HOWEVER  (fe_03_02159-B-0020)
I DON'T KNOW WHY I THINK IT WOULD BE ANY DIFFERENT I SUPPOSE IT WOULD DEPEND UPON THE AGE OF THE CHILD  (fe_03_02159-B-0022)
UH MAYBE IF I HAD CHILDREN MAYBE I'D ORDER OUT MORE I DON'T KNOW I'D PROBABLY STILL COOK AT HOME BECAUSE THAT'S THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT I DO  (fe_03_02159-B-0023)
UM  (fe_03_02159-B-0024)
OH YEAH I MEAN JUST THE SURE JUST THE IDEA OF OF HAVING CHILDREN  (fe_03_02159-B-0025)
AND THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY IT TAKES NOT ONLY TO COOK FOR THEM BUT  (fe_03_02159-B-0026)
UH [COUGH] JUST TO CARE FOR THEM YOU KNOW IS IS PRETTY TAXING  (fe_03_02159-B-0027)
UH BUT IT'S IT'S JUST A PREFERENCE THAT I HAVE I KNOW AN AWFUL LOT OF MEN DON'T DON'T COOK  (fe_03_02159-B-0028)
AND THERE ARE SOME WOMEN WHO DON'T COOK  (fe_03_02159-B-0029)
[LAUGHTER] SO I GUESS THEY HAVE TO RELY UPON SOMEONE ELSE TO DO IT AND UH  (fe_03_02159-B-0030)
AS A CHILD I WANTED TO COOK MY FATHER WAS A COOK SO  (fe_03_02159-B-0031)
YOU KNOW AS A YOUNGSTER I WANTED TO EMULATE HIM AND HUNG AROUND THE KITCHEN AND THE FIRST THING HE TAUGHT ME WAS  (fe_03_02159-B-0032)
CLEAN UP  (fe_03_02159-B-0033)
ABSOLUTELY THAT WAS THE FIRST LESSON HE TAUGHT ME AND  (fe_03_02159-B-0034)
I  (fe_03_02159-B-0035)
[LAUGHTER] NO NOT IN MY CIRCUMSTANCES I  (fe_03_02159-B-0036)
DON'T DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE THAT LUXURY SO TO ME CLEANING UP IS PART OF THE COOKING PROCESS  (fe_03_02159-B-0037)
AND IT GOES ALONG WITH IT IT'S IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I GUESS THAT DISTINGUISHES EATING OUT FROM DOING IT AT HOME IS IF SOMEONE ELSE  (fe_03_02159-B-0038)
HAS THE BURDEN OF DOING ALL THE CLEANING  (fe_03_02159-B-0039)
BUT UH TO ME CLEANING AND COOKING ARE SIMULTANEOUS THEY YOU KNOW THEY  (fe_03_02159-B-0040)

YAH AND THEN THERE'S THE ISSUE OF OF UM  (fe_03_02159-B-0042)

PEOPLE GO TO RESTAURANTS AND THEY DISCOVER [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02159-B-0046)
THINGS THAT ARE THAT YOU WOULDN'T WANT IN YOUR OWN KITCHEN  (fe_03_02159-B-0047)
AND THERE IS I THINK A HEALTH ISSUE WHICH IS ALSO UH  (fe_03_02159-B-0048)
UH NOT A PRIMARY [SIGH] MOTIVATION BUT PROBABLY A SECONDARY MOTIVATION FOR COOKING AT HOME  (fe_03_02159-B-0049)
ABSOLUTELY BRENDA I I I MEAN I DON'T KNOW RIGHT RIGHT I DON'T HAVE A CLUE  (fe_03_02159-B-0050)
AND WE'VE SEEN THESE STORIES TOO UH [COUGH]  (fe_03_02159-B-0051)

THE RECIPIENT  (fe_03_02159-B-0054)
OF THEIR PARTICULAR ANGER OR THEIR JOKES OR THEIR  (fe_03_02159-B-0055)
JUST PLAIN NASTINESS  (fe_03_02159-B-0056)
AND YOU DON'T REALLY [LAUGHTER] KNOW WHAT'S IN THAT SALAD I MEAN  (fe_03_02159-B-0057)
SO  (fe_03_02159-B-0058)
YEAH  (fe_03_02159-B-0059)
THAT IS CORRECT I DON'T KNOW AND NOT THAT I KNOW EVERYTHING THAT I BUY SAY AT FARMERS MARKET OR THE GROCERY STORE TO COOK AT HOME BUT  (fe_03_02159-B-0060)

I I WAS A WORKING HUSBAND AND STILL DID ALL THE COOKING MY MY WIFE IS NOT A COOK  (fe_03_02159-B-0066)
BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU UH THAT AFTER WORKING TWELVE HOUR DAYS WHICH IS WHAT I USED TO DO  (fe_03_02159-B-0067)

SO  (fe_03_02159-B-0072)
AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE STILL WOMEN OUT THERE WHO UH BECAUSE HISTORICALLY I THINK WOMEN HAVE BEEN RELEGATED MORE INTO THE KITCHEN  (fe_03_02159-B-0073)
MEN WHO  (fe_03_02159-B-0074)
THINK THAT A WOMAN'S JOB IS OFTEN MORE OF A HOBBY [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02159-B-0075)
AND THEY THINK OH WELL SHE CAN COME HOME AND COOK FOR ME AND ONE OR TWO CHILDREN AND BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A JOB YOU KNOW AND  (fe_03_02159-B-0076)
UM THIS THIS ATTITUDE WHILE I DON'T THINK IT'S AS UH PERVASIVE AS IT USED TO BE IS STILL PRETTY  (fe_03_02159-B-0077)
IT'S STILL OUT THERE THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT BECAUSE I  (fe_03_02159-B-0078)
I KNOW WHEN I DO GO TO THE GROCERY STORE TO SHOP UH UH I FIND THAT UH I DON'T TALK TO WOMEN  (fe_03_02159-B-0079)
OR MEN  (fe_03_02159-B-0080)
UNLESS THEY LOOK PARTICULARLY KEEN UNDER THE AGE OF FORTY BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING  (fe_03_02159-B-0081)
