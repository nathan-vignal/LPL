UH CLOSE TO HUNTSVILLE IT'S IN NORTHERN ALABAMA  (fe_03_02185-A-0007)
SO THE TOPIC OF TODAY IS FOOD [SIGH] AND WHETHER I'D PREFER TO EAT OUT OR EAT AT HOME SEE THAT THAT'S KINDA A TRICKY QUESTION 'CAUSE I LOVE TO COOK MYSELF  (fe_03_02185-A-0008)
SO I LOVE TO EAT AT HOME BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I JUST WANT TO GO OUT TO EAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S ALWAYS FUN TO EAT IN A LIKE A A NEWER ATMOSPHERE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW LIKE  (fe_03_02185-A-0009)
YOU YOU CAN'T GO TO I I DON'T HAVE A MEXICAN THEME IN MY HOUSE SO YOU KNOW I CAN MAKE PAHITAS HERE AND THEY'RE GOOD  (fe_03_02185-A-0010)
YOU KNOW BUT YEAH SO I LIKE TO GO OUT TO EAT [SIGH] BUT I CAN'T AFFORD TO GO OUT TO EAT ALL THE TIME  (fe_03_02185-A-0011)
SO I LIKE THE I LIKE THE ATMOSPHERE OF GOING OUT TO EAT AND I BUT I ALSO LOVE TO COOK I MEAN LOVE TO COOK BUT IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME I COOK I ALWAYS END UP TRYING TO MAKE SOME KIND OF PASTA  (fe_03_02185-A-0012)
BECAUSE ITALIAN FOOD IS REALLY HARD TO COOK [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02185-A-0013)
AND IT IT'S GOOD [SIGH] BUT IT IT ALWAYS ENDS UP BEING MORE OF A MESS TO HAVE TO CLEAN UP SO  (fe_03_02185-A-0014)
I WOULD WAGER TO SAY THAT I THINK I LIKE EATING OUT MORE THAN I DO EATING AT HOME 'CAUSE THEN AT LEAST I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT CLEANING IT ALL UP AND YOU KNOW AND I STILL GET THE GOOD MEAL  (fe_03_02185-A-0015)
HOWEVER YOU KNOW TO COOK THAT SAME TYPE MEAL I CAN MAKE IT AND I'LL HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT IT FOR TWO TO THREE DAYS BUT YOU KNOW I'LL END UP SPENDING ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT AS I WOULD IF I WENT OUT TO EAT  (fe_03_02185-A-0016)

FIVE POUNDS WORTH OF SWEDISH MEAT BALLS SO WE CAN EAT IT FOR LIKE FOUR OR FIVE DAYS BETWEEN ME MY WIFE AND OUT SON  (fe_03_02185-A-0018)
YOU KNOW THAT WAY IT'S CHEAPER TO BUY IN BULK THAN IT IS TO JUST BUY LIKE ONE POUND OF MEAT WHEN YOU CAN BUY A BIG FIVE POUND THING AND GET THE DISCOUNT SO  (fe_03_02185-A-0019)
SO WE END UP JUST USUALLY BUYING IN BULK I'LL END UP COOKING THIS BIG GRAND MEAL FOR US ALL WE'LL EAT IT FOR LIKE TWO OR THREE DAYS UNTIL WE'RE SICK OF EATING THE SAME THING EVEN THOUGH IT IS GOOD FOOD  (fe_03_02185-A-0020)
BUT ON AT THE SAME NOTE YOU KNOW WHENEVER YOU GO OUT TO A RESTAURANT YOU SEE THE THING IS I ALWAYS GET ON TO MY WIFE BECAUSE WE'LL GO OUT TO EAT AND SHE'LL ALWAYS ORDER THE EXACT SAME THING OFF THE MENU EVERY TIME [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02185-A-0021)
YEAH  (fe_03_02185-A-0022)
WELL NO IT'S JUST LIKE YOU KNOW WE'LL SAY WE GO TO OLIVE GARDEN SHE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT SHE LIKES THERE SO RATHER THAN EXPERIMENTING AND GETTING SOMETHING DIFFERENT SHE'LL JUST GET THE SAME THING SHE ALWAYS GETS FROM OLIVE GARDEN  (fe_03_02185-A-0023)
UH YOU KNOW I'M THAT WAY WITH MEXICAN 'CAUSE YOU KNOW IF WE GO OUT TO EAT NO MATTER WHERE WE GO FOR MEXICAN I'M GONNA GET PAHITAS  (fe_03_02185-A-0024)
YOU KNOW BUT WHENEVER I GO SOMEWHERE I GENERALLY TRY AND GET SOMETHING NEW EVERY TIME THAT WAY I CAN EXPERIMENT BROADEN MY HORIZONS SEE IF I LIKE SOMETHING MORE THAN I I THOUGHT I DID  (fe_03_02185-A-0025)

CHANCES ARE IF YOU'RE THROWING SOMETHING TOGE- AH TOGETHER AT WORK IT'S SOMETHING REAL QUICK THAT YOU CAN CHANCES ARE JUST NUKE  (fe_03_02185-A-0030)
AND YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT REALLY THE SAME THING I MEAN IN A WAY IT'S THE SAME THING BUT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THE SAME THING AS SITTING DOWN AND COOKING FOR LIKE THREE HOURS TRYING TO FLAP TOGETHER THIS MEAL WITH ALL THE SIDES AND ALL THAT STUFF  (fe_03_02185-A-0031)
I JUST RECENTLY STARTED TO DO IT SINCE ME AND MY WIFE GOT TOGETHER 'CAUSE YOU KNOW I USED TO COULD NOT COOK TO SAVE MY LIFE I WOULD LIKE  (fe_03_02185-A-0032)

I'M NOT SURE WHETHER IT WOULD YOU KNOW IT'S SUCH A AN HONEST DEBATE IN MY HEAD WHETHER I LIKE TO COOK MORE AT HOME BECAUSE I ENJOY YOU KNOW LEARNING HOW TO COOK ALL THIS STUFF  (fe_03_02185-A-0037)
BUT I END UP TRYING TO COOK BASICALLY THE SAME THING USUALLY SOME FORM OF CHICKEN  (fe_03_02185-A-0038)
HUH  (fe_03_02185-A-0039)

I LIKE THE WAY ONION FLAVOR IS LIKE IF YOU COOK IT WITH SOMETHING BUT I DON'T LIKE THE TEXTURE OF ONIONS UNLESS LIKE YOU CAN COOK AN ONION ENOUGH TO WHERE IT'S LIKE  (fe_03_02185-A-0045)
YOU YOU KNOW ALMOST HAS NO TEXTURE IT'S JUST REAL CHEWY YOU KNOW AND YOU CAN'T TASTE IT USUALLY IF IT'S BOILED IN SOMETHING  (fe_03_02185-A-0046)
[LIPSMACK] THAT'S ABOUT THE ONLY WAY I'LL GET I'LL GET MY ONIONS YOU KNOW  (fe_03_02185-A-0047)
AND USUALLY THAT'S IN SOMETHING LIKE CHILI  (fe_03_02185-A-0048)
