I THINK SO  (fe_03_02181-A-0003)
UM I ACTUALLY UM I PREFER TO EAT IN A RESTAURANT PART OF THE TIME BECAUSE I LIKE TO EAT THINGS THAT I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO MAKE MYSELF BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO COMPLICATED OR  (fe_03_02181-A-0004)
UM TOO ELABORATE TO PREPARE EASILY AT HOME  (fe_03_02181-A-0005)
BUT I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE TO COOK SO I ALSO REALLY LIKE TO EAT AT HOME AS WELL SO IT'S KIND OF A TOSS UP FOR ME  (fe_03_02181-A-0006)

OR I GUESS LIKE CHINESE RESTAURANTS  (fe_03_02181-A-0008)
THEY CAN GET THE THE WOK SO HOT L- ON A PROFESSIONAL STOVE MUCH HOTTER THAN YOU CAN GET IT AT HOME SO YOU CAN'T MAKE IT TASTE THE SAME AT HOME  (fe_03_02181-A-0009)
EXACTLY OR THE SAME WITH LIKE A PROFESSIONAL PIZZA OVEN [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] I WOULD LOVE A PROFESSIONAL PIZZA OVEN IN MY HOUSE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02181-A-0010)
YEAH THAT'S TRUE AND I MEAN DEFINITELY UM SOME THINGS I THINK ARE BETTER AT HOME LIKE I DON'T LIKE PIE CRUST IN RESTAURANTS  (fe_03_02181-A-0012)
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT IT NEVER  (fe_03_02181-A-0013)

SO 'CAUSE AGAIN  (fe_03_02181-A-0059)
FRENCH FOOD I- IT'S JUST SO HARD TO RECREATE AT HOME WHERE YOU KNOW GOOD LIKE AMERICAN STYLE FAMILY STYLE FOOD BARBEQUE  (fe_03_02181-A-0060)
I CAN COME PRETTY CLOSE AT HOME TO CREATING  (fe_03_02181-A-0061)
YOU KNOW ALMOST ANYTHING I CAN EAT OUT LIKE THAT  (fe_03_02181-A-0062)
YEAH M- NOT MOIST AND I LOVE CHICKEN AND DUMPLINGS  (fe_03_02181-A-0063)

AH SURE I PREFER WELL IT'S IT'S A MIX BUT I PREFER TO EAT OUT IN A RESTAURANT  (fe_03_02181-B-0003)
BECAUSE THEY SERVE YOU  (fe_03_02181-B-0004)
AND UM I'M ALWAYS ON THE GO AND I RARELY GET A CHANCE TO COOK FOR MYSELF  (fe_03_02181-B-0005)
IS THAT WHAT THE QUESTION WAS  (fe_03_02181-B-0006)
OKAY  (fe_03_02181-B-0007)
RIGHT  (fe_03_02181-B-0008)
SURE [SIGH] I DO TOO IT'S IT'S A VERY TOUGH QUESTION TO ASK BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE LIKE BOTH BUT IF I HAD TO MAKE THE CHOICE SINCE I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME USUALLY I WOULD LIKE EVEN THOUGH I EAT AT HOME MOST OF THE TIMES  (fe_03_02181-B-0009)
I WOULDN'T MIND A GOOD COOKED MEAL  (fe_03_02181-B-0010)
AND THAT YOU COULD USUALLY FIND IN A RESTAURANT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02181-B-0011)
TO DO IT  (fe_03_02181-B-0012)
SOMETIMES I JUST DON'T EVEN HAVE THE TALENT TOO LIKE G- GOOD MEXICAN FOOD  (fe_03_02181-B-0013)
I'D RATHER GET OUT THAN MAKE MYSELF  (fe_03_02181-B-0014)

I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY THERE'S NO WAY I CAN MAKE AS WELL AS I CAN MAKE A STIR FRY I CAN'T MAKE IT TASTE THE SAME AS I CAN GET FROM A CHINESE RESTAURANT [SIGH]  (fe_03_02181-B-0016)
WELL THAT'S TRUE [SIGH] TRUE  (fe_03_02181-B-0017)
[LAUGHTER] BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IF IT'S OTHER ITALIAN FOODS SINCE I'M ITALIAN I REALLY RARELY WILL EAT OUT  (fe_03_02181-B-0018)
BESIDES PIZZA YOU HAVE TO HAVE PIZZA OUT UM BECAUSE JUST THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME TASTE TO ME  (fe_03_02181-B-0019)
IT DEPENDS YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO FIND A REALLY REALLY GOOD ITALIAN RESTAURANT AND THEN USUALLY YOU'RE PAYING  (fe_03_02181-B-0020)
THE MONEY FOR IT WHEN YOU COULD JUST MAKE IT AT HOME  (fe_03_02181-B-0021)
TASTES THE SAME  (fe_03_02181-B-0022)
BUT SEE IF YOU CAN IF YOU CAN MAKE A GOOD PIE CRUST  (fe_03_02181-B-0023)
I I DON'T THINK I CAN I HAVEN'T HAD MUCH LUCK WITH THAT  (fe_03_02181-B-0024)
