WHICH ONE WE LIKE EATING BETTER AT A RESTAURANT OR AT HOME AND OUR PERFECT MEAL  (fe_03_02197-A-0004)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02197-A-0005)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02197-A-0006)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02197-A-0007)
YOU WOULD  (fe_03_02197-A-0008)
IF IT WERE- IF YOU HAD THE MONEY YOU'D PREFER TO EAT OUT ALL THE TIME  (fe_03_02197-A-0009)
EVEN BREAKFAST AND LUNCH  (fe_03_02197-A-0010)

[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02197-A-0013)
DO YOU WORK  (fe_03_02197-A-0014)
SO TI- IS TIME A FACTOR IN THAT DECISION TO PREFER TO EAT OUT  (fe_03_02197-A-0015)
IF YOU HAD MORE TIME YOU COULD PROBABLY COOK MORE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02197-A-0016)
SURE  (fe_03_02197-A-0017)
WELL I'M I'M I'M KINDA TORN ON THIS QUESTION BECAUSE I LOVE TO COOK I GREW UP WITH AN ITALIAN MOTHER YOU KNOW AND SHE MADE EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH  (fe_03_02197-A-0018)
AND THEN MY FAMILY OWNED A RESTAURANT IN IN A IN A RESORT AND I I GREW UP WORKING AND PLAYING IN THE RESTAURANT  (fe_03_02197-A-0019)
YOU KNOW AND SO I YOU KNOW AND I ATE A LOT OF MEALS AT HOME  (fe_03_02197-A-0020)
WITH YOU KNOW AND LEARNED HOW TO COOK FROM SCRATCH  (fe_03_02197-A-0021)
AND THEN I ATE A LOT OF MEALS AT THE RESTAURANT AND MY PARENTS IDEA OF LIKE TAKING US OUT FOR A GREAT BIRTHDAY OR A SPECIAL OCCASION WAS TO GO TO A RESTAURANT SO I LINK THAT IN MY MIND TO  (fe_03_02197-A-0022)
IT'S SPECIAL WHEN YOU GO TO A RESTAURANT SO I LOVE GOING TO RESTAURANTS BUT I ALSO LOVE TO COOK THE KIND OF FOOD THAT I WANT TO EAT AT HOME  (fe_03_02197-A-0023)
SO  (fe_03_02197-A-0024)
IF I HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN ONE AND THE OTHER  (fe_03_02197-A-0025)
I'D PROBABLY CHOOSE  (fe_03_02197-A-0026)
COOKING AT HOME 'CAUSE I'D DEFINITELY AS LONG AS I HAD ENOUGH TIME AND INGREDIENTS  (fe_03_02197-A-0027)
YOU KNOW AND MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE HELP [LAUGHTER] I YOU KNOW I WOULD PREFER THAT BECAUSE THEN I COULD MAKE IT EXACTLY THE WAY I WANT IT  (fe_03_02197-A-0028)
TRUE TRUE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE COOKS YOU KNOW KEEP A CLEAN KITCHEN OR IF YOU KNOW IF THERE'S ANY E. COLI HANGING OUT AND YOU KNOW IF THEY REFRIGERATED THE INGREDIENTS PROPERLY AND  (fe_03_02197-A-0029)
RIGHT WELL SEE I GREW UP WITH FOOD ALLERGIES  (fe_03_02197-A-0030)
IN FACT I WAS PROBABLY ALLERGIC TO MORE FOODS THAN THAN NOT SO I HAD TO REALLY KIND OF YOU KNOW EITHER PUT UP WITH AH THE SKIN PROBLEMS THAT IT CAUSED OR JUST YOU KNOW LEARN TO PICK AND CHOOSE AND ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS WHEN I WENT OUT  (fe_03_02197-A-0031)
SO THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT  (fe_03_02197-A-0032)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02197-A-0033)
YOU KNOW IN FACT IN FACT I I DECIDED TO OPEN A RESTAURANT WHEN I WAS YOU KNOW IN MY EARLY THIRTIES AND I OWNED MY OWN RESTAURANT FOR A WHILE AND IT WAS ALL NATURAL FOODS  (fe_03_02197-A-0034)
