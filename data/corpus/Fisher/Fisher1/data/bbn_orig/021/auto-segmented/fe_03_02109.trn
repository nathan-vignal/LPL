AND THEY HAVE VERY FEW COUPLE FRIENDS TO GO OUT TO DINNER WITH OR GO SOCIAL YOU KNOW TO SOCIAL OUTINGS WITH  (fe_03_02109-B-0026)

I THINK IT'S HARD I I MOVED HERE AND KNEW JUST MY BEST FRIEND AND MY BOYFRIEND AT THE TIME AND BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN HERE FOR A YEAR I MET ALL THEIR FRIENDS  (fe_03_02109-B-0038)
BUT I THINK IF I MOVED HERE BY MYSELF I WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO SHY PROBABLY TO GO OUT  (fe_03_02109-B-0039)

BUT IT'S STILL HARD  (fe_03_02109-B-0041)
BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE THAT CONSTANT COMPANIONSHIP AND YOU SEE 'EM ALL THE TIME 'CAUSE MY ORGANIZATIONS THAT I'VE TRIED TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS WITH  (fe_03_02109-B-0042)

WELL ANOTHER ASPECT OF FRIENDS UH IS UM OBVIOUSLY SINCE I'M A TEACHER I CAN TALK ABOUT MY STUDENTS AND WHO I SEE AS FRIENDLY AND THOSE WHO ARE NOT  (fe_03_02109-B-0049)
AND OBVIOUSLY IN THE FRIEND CIRCLE OF YOUNG CHILDREN THERE ARE THE BULLIES WHO CHILDREN ARE FRIENDS WITH THEM 'CAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID OF THEM  (fe_03_02109-B-0050)
AND THEN THERE'S THE SHY CHILDREN WHO HAVE NO FRIENDS 'CAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY SOCIAL  (fe_03_02109-B-0051)
SKILLS I GUESS MAY BE WHY  (fe_03_02109-B-0052)
BUT IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO SEE THE MIXTURE OF MY CLASSROOMS AND SEE WHO IS FRIENDS WITH WHO AND WHO'S SINGLED OUT  (fe_03_02109-B-0053)
IT'S KIND OF SAD I DON'T KNOW IF Y'ALL HAVE ANY CHILDREN  (fe_03_02109-B-0054)
