OUR OUR TOPIC IS FOOD AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT  (fe_03_02165-A-0038)
WHETHER WE PREFER TO EAT IN A RESTAURANT OR AT HOME AND WHY  (fe_03_02165-A-0039)
YEAH AND MY WHY FOR THE RESTAURANT IS BECAUSE MY FAMILY JUST DOESN'T APPRECIATE IT  (fe_03_02165-A-0040)
AS MUCH  (fe_03_02165-A-0041)
BECAUSE THEY'RE FUSSY AND  (fe_03_02165-A-0042)
THAT YOU KNOW AND THAT'S WHY  (fe_03_02165-A-0043)
THEY'RE FUSSY AND THEY JUST I MEAN  (fe_03_02165-A-0044)
IT YOU KNOW HOW WHEN YOU H- HAVE GUESTS YEAH IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO COOK YOU APPRECIATE THE FOOD A LOT MORE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02165-A-0045)

MHM  (fe_03_02165-A-0049)
WELL THERE'S SEVERAL GOOD REASONS TO GO TO A RESTAURANT RATHER THAN TO COOK  (fe_03_02165-A-0050)
AND TO ME THAT WOULD BE  (fe_03_02165-A-0051)
LIKE I SAID THE CHOICE EVERYBODY CAN GET SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND THEY CAN GET IT THE WAY THEY WANT IT  (fe_03_02165-A-0052)
ANOTHER THING IS IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO COOK  (fe_03_02165-A-0053)
AND YOU DON'T HAVE CLEAN UP  (fe_03_02165-A-0054)
WHEN YOU'RE DONE EATING YOU SIMPLY PAY THE BILL AND YOU LEAVE IT'S AWESOME [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_02165-A-0055)
WHERE WITH AT HOME YOU HAVE TO SHOP FOR IT YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO PREPARE IT YOU HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP YOU KNOW AFTER YOU SERVE IT AND  (fe_03_02165-A-0056)
AND TO TRY TO ACCOMMODATE FUSSY EATERS IS  (fe_03_02165-A-0057)
NOT SO FUN  (fe_03_02165-A-0058)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_02165-A-0059)
