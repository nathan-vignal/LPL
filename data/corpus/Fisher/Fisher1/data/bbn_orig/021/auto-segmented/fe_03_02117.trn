KINDA DIFFERENT I HAVE A LOT OF ACQUAINTANCES I EVEN PEOPLE THAT I'VE KNOWN FOR  (fe_03_02117-A-0019)
A LONG TIME I REALLY DON'T CONSIDER THEM FRIENDS UNLESS I SHARE LIKE A REALLY CLOSE BOND WITH THEM SOMEHOW  (fe_03_02117-A-0020)
UM I ONLY HAVE A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE THAT I ACTUALLY CONSIDER FRIENDS UM I THINK THAT IT'S CHANGED AS I'VE GOTTEN OLDER ALSO BECAUSE I REALIZE THAT UM FR- BEING IN A FRIENDSHIP ISN'T IS YOU KNOW ALSO BIG TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP  (fe_03_02117-A-0021)
AND WHEN YOU JUST CALL EVERYBODY YOUR FRIENDS I THINK IT'S LIKE SPREADING IT A LITTLE BIT TOO THIN SO THAT'S WHY I LIKE CALLING UM JUST A A COUPLE OF PEOPLE FRIENDS INSTEAD OF JUST YOU KNOW  (fe_03_02117-A-0022)
YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF JUST TELLING EVERYBODY OH THIS IS MY FRIEND BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT THIS PERSON'S MY FRIEND BUT LIKE REALLY HOW MANY PEOPLE TRULY ARE SO  (fe_03_02117-A-0023)

BUT UM I WAS SAYING WELL IT'S EASIER TO TO CALL PEOPLE FRIENDS WHEN YOU MET SO MANY PEOPLE WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL BECAUSE YOU WERE FORCED TO INTERACT WITH THEM ON A DAILY BASIS SO I THINK THAT'S ALSO WHERE IT COME  (fe_03_02117-A-0030)
COMES FROM BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND US WHEN WE'RE GOING TO SCHOOL  (fe_03_02117-A-0031)
AND WE'RE WITH THEM SO MUCH WE MIGHT AS WELL CALL THEM OUR FRIENDS EVEN WHEN WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT AND I THINK THAT'S ALSO IT LEADS TO WHY THERE'S SO MANY UM RUMORS IN HIGH SCHOOL BECAUSE WE CONSIDER EVERYBODY OUR FRIENDS BUT WE BOTH KNOW THAT WE  (fe_03_02117-A-0032)
TALK ABOUT PEOPLE BEHIND THEIR BACKS JUST BECAUSE [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER] THEY'RE THERE WE KNOW A BUNCH ABOUT THEM  (fe_03_02117-A-0033)
SO BUT WHEN YOU'RE OLDER AND YOU YOU'RE STARTING TO HAVE FAMILIES AND WHEN YOU'RE YOU KNOW HAVING A CAREER AND STUFF LIKE THAT YOU CAN'T SOCIALLY INTERACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND I THINK THAT'S WHY WE'VE STOPPED CALLING PEOPLE  (fe_03_02117-A-0034)
