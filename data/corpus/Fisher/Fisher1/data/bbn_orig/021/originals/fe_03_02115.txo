L:  Hi, um, my name's Felicia.  How are you?
R:  Hi, I'm Mary.  I'm good.
L:  Have you done this before?
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I haven't either. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  We're supposed to talk about friends, uh, and --
R:  Yeah, um, I have just a few close acquaintances, I guess.
L:  Um, I think I have a large -- a large group of friends and acquaintances.  
R:  Where do you meet your friends?
L:  Probably -- I go to Temple so a lot of them at school, from high school, from previous places I worked and stuff like that.  What about you?
R:  Um, at work I have, um, a couple of close friends and I ride in a motorcycle club so I have some close friends there as well.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, uh -- are these lifelong friends or just friends that you've met recently?
L:  Um, more like -- I think some could be called lifelong friends but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's some that I know that I'm just really going to lose touch with and probably won't speak to after I graduate.
R:  Uh, you're in college now, you said?
L:  Yeah, I'm graduating, like, in May, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I guess around this time right now is exactly, you know -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- the time where the people I keep in touch with might decrease. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I have some, uh -- a couple of friends from college, one that I keep in touch with, like, on a regular basis, there's a couple of others that I do.
L:  I mean, do you have more friends that you are closer with from high school or from, like, college?
R:  None from high school, really.  I moved away to go to college and, um --
L:  Oh yeah, me, too.
R:  Yeah, I never really kept in touch with anyone.  I just went back for my ten year high school reunion last year.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, and I -- I mean, I recognized everyone but I wouldn't call any of 'em, like, a friend, like, hang out -- you know, I mean, they were when we were in high school.
L:  Mm.  Where did you go to school?
R:  Up in Ohio.
L:  Oh, okay and you're from Pennsylvania?
R:  No, I'm from, um, Ohio and now I live in Dallas.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But I went to --
L:  Oh, [inaudible] from Dallas.
R:  Yeah, I, um -- [LIPSMACK] I found out about this through an email.
L:  Oh yeah, me too, actually.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um --
R:  Do you go to University of Pennsylvania?
L:  Um, no, I go to Temple University which is in Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, you said that, okay.
L:  Yeah, but I'm from Connecticut.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, so, yeah I -- I've got more friends from college, I guess, just 'cause it was more recent.  I graduated six years ago.  But I would say most of my close friends live down here in Dallas.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, definitely, I think, there are a lot of people that I, um, basically met through work and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they've become like one of my best friends, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  Like, one -- people that I hang out with a lot.  So, I'm sure when I get, like, a real, like, full time job and I'm out of school that it'll be different.
R:  What do you and your friends do?
L:  Um --
R:  Just hang out or do you go --
L:  Yeah, just, like, go out, um, a lot of different things.  Like I have different friends, I think, for different -- like, I have friends --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that I just go out with all the time.
R:  Right.
L:  Then I have friends that, like, come over and we just hang out and we occasionally go out 'cause you know it's different, depending on --
R:  Who the friend is.
L:  -- who has boyfriends --
R:  Right.
L:  -- who don't, you know, what they do, stuff like that, so --
R:  Yeah, I'm the same way.  I've got one girlfriend that's pretty much good for everyday lunch. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, like, you want to go to lunch and, like, "Oh, I know so and so will be available" so, yeah, I've got different friends for -- one girlfriend that I go to church with and, you know, just a different friend for a different topic, I guess.
L:  Yeah, yeah, me, too.  I wonder how long this is supposed to be. [LAUGH]
R:  Ten minutes she said, it said.
L:  Oh.  Do you know anyone's that participated in this?
R:  No, I don't.
L:  Right.
R:  No.
L:  Well, one of my friends did, that's how I -- like, it wasn't through really email, it was through, like, an instant message thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  My friend was telling me and I was like, "Oh, okay".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um [LIPSMACK] yep, friends. [LAUGH]
R:  I know, I'm trying to think.  Mm.
L:  Um, yeah, so ...
R:  So do you think, uh, after you graduate you'll -- you'll get more of a closer knit of friends rather than fringe people?
L:  I think so 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, I actually, like -- one of my best friends that I know that's like, oh, an absolute lifelong friend, we talk a lot and we talk about the people that we think we're going to keep in touch with.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The people that you just almost kinda know that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you're not going to but, uh --
R:  You know, my -- my best friend from college, you know, you -- you know you're going to keep in touch with your very closest friend.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But she ended up moving to California and I moved to Texas and then we joined back up and lived in California for a while and --
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  -- and she moved to France.  Yeah, she's living in France right now.
L:  Wow.
R:  I've gone and visited her twice there but --
L:  I was just in France, actually. [LAUGH]
R:  Were you really?
L:  Not so long ago.  Yeah, 'cause I was doing an internship in England, um --
R:  Oh, that's awesome.
L:  For a whole semester but -- yeah --
R:  I wish I'd have done something like that.
L:  [several inaudible words] summer school. [LAUGH]
R:  I bet you met a lot of people over there.
L:  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  I mean, um, it was different 'cause I'd been on the Study Abroad Program before.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I went to Rome and actually today, um, I hung out with probably the only person that I've kept in touch with from that trip.
R:  Okay.
L:  Like, I've kept in touch with, I've hung out with and stuff so ...
R:  Fun.
L:  That's cool but, uh --
R:  That would be -- yeah, there were some girls, um, doing a semester abroad that are friends with my friend living in France.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah --
R:  And I was like, "How cool" and they don't even speak French.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  I wish I'd done [LAUGH] something like that.  How cool.
L:  Yeah, I didn't speak Italian at all, I took a class and that's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- about all.
R:  Yeah, they said it was all English speaking in class.
L:  Yeah, it was -- my class, it wasn't really that difficult and, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh -- yep, so I met a lot of good friends through there and then when I just came back from interning over in England --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I met a lot of people that, I guess you'd classify as, like, work friends that you --
R:  Right.
L:  -- met through work 'cause it wasn't a Study Abroad Program at all, so it was really just kind of, like, fending for yourself and --
R:  Do you keep in touch with any of those people or do you think you would?
L:  It's hard because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- some of the people at work I really didn't go out with at all but then there's some people -- I mean, it was a really unique situation.  I think, um, the one -- it's actually one person that I've -- I've still really kept in contact with, like, emailed and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  I never keep in touch with anybody. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Maybe that's why I don't have a big group of friends. [LAUGH]
L:  No, it's hard, though, it's really hard --
R:  It's hard, yeah.
L:  -- I think, to keep in with, um, -- I mean, I -- like, especially when people have different schedules going on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, just different things going on, it's -- it's just hard.
R:  My boyfriend and I went on a cruise and we met this couple and they were so nice and I sent them one email and they sent me back an email and we haven't talked since, and that was, like, October.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] it's just really hard, especially, like, to -- I think to meet, like, really good friends is really hard because --
R:  Oh, absolutely
L:  [inaudible]
R:  It gets harder, too, when you get -- I mean, as you get away from college it's going to be even harder to meet people.
L:  Oh.
R:  Specially guys, I mean [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- meeting guys is not as easy as it was in college. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, actually, um, the girl I lived with in England, I remember her telling me that, um -- she was, like, twenty five but she didn't have a boyfriend.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And she was like, oh, she was like, "I really wish that, you know, I could meet, like, more guys", she was, like, "'Cause in college they're like everywhere".
R:  Yeah, oh, yeah.
L:  But --
R:  You never have a problem.
L:  She was like, right, she's a teacher
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- And she was, like, there was, like, only a few guys that even worked there, you know, and --
R:  And who wants to work with somebody that you're dating --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- in case it breaks up.
L:  'Cause then it makes it so uncomfortable in work situations.
R:  Yeah, I would never date somebody that I work with, it's just weird.  Actually I met a guy at my high school reunion that I'm dating now.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, it's funny --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- because we didn't even really know each other in high school. [LAUGH]
L:  Did you go to a big -- did -- did you go to a big school?
R:  Yeah, there was, like, twelve hundred of us graduating.
L:  Wow!
R:  I mean, I knew of him, like, I recognized the name but we never hung out or anything.
L:  Oh, wow, I can't even --
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause, um, I was actually talking -- I still -- I think I still keep in touch with, like, four people I was at high school with --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so a couple of times we've talked but, um, they have this thing online called, like, Classmates that --
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, I'd never been on it but, um, I was really bored one day and it kept popping up so I said, "Yeah, let me see what this is about.  I'm probably going to be the only person from my, you know, high school".  It turned out, like, all these people were on it.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I mean, I -- 'cause I went to a very small high school --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like, I graduated with, like, two hundred people, so --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  You know, like, I basically knew everyone in my -- in my grade but, yeah, I think it -- I think it'll be interesting to go to my --
R:  Definitely, yeah, I hope so.
L:  -- class reunion.
R:  Yeah, I helped to put the reunion together so we went on Classmates and got a lot of the information from there.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How old are you?
R:  I'm twenty nine.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I just turned twenty nine. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't feel that old. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't think that's old at all.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean --
R:  Wait till you get there.
L:  -- my boyfriend, like -- [LAUGH] I'm only twenty one but my boyfriend's --
R:  Oh, my goodness. [LAUGH]
L:  -- twenty eight but he doesn't lo-  -- I mean, he doesn't look like he -- but --
R:  Right, it's not like he's so much more mature than you. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it -- no, yeah, it's not like he's, like, so, like, much older than me or whatever but, um --
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  Yeah, it's just --
R:  Where'd you meet him?
L:  Um, actually through friends, um, the summer -- the first summer that I moved into an apartment off campus --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- during my junior year in the summer, um, I basically hung out with these people --
