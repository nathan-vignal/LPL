R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, my name is Anne.
R:  My name is Jenny.
L:  Hi Jenny.  Do you want to go first?
R:  Ah, sure, I prefer -- well, it's -- it's a mix -- but I prefer to eat out in a restaurant, because they serve you, and, um, I'm always on the go and I rarely get a chance to cook for myself.  Is that what the question was?
L:  I think so.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I actually, um, I prefer to eat in a restaurant part of the time, because I like to eat things that I wouldn't be able to make myself --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because they're too complicated, or, um, too elaborate to --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- prepare easily at home, but I actually really like to cook, so I also really like to eat at home as well, so it's kind of a toss up for me.
R:  [SIGH] I do too.  It's -- it's a very tough question to ask because most people like both.  But if I had to make the choice, since I don't have a lot of time usually, I would like -- even though I eat at home most of the times, I wouldn't mind a good cooked meal -- and that, you could usually find in a restaurant [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I mean, I really like French food, so I en- enjoy things that have sauces that take, like, seven or eight hours to make [SIGH], but, you know, I've tried at home a couple of times and just don't have the patience or -- 
R:  To do it.
L:  -- fortitude [LAUGH] to actually --
R:  Sometimes I just don't even have the talent too, like g- good Mexican food -- I'd rather get out than make myself.
L:  Or, I guess, like Chinese restaurants --
R:  Also this --
L:  -- they can get the -- the wok so hot, l- on a professional stove, much hotter than you can get it at home, so you can't make it taste the same at home --
R:  I was just going to say, there's no way I can make -- as well as I can make a stir fry I can't make it taste the same as I can get from a Chinese restaurant.
L:  Exactly, or the same with, like, a professional pizza oven. [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] Well that's true [SIGH] true.
L:  [LAUGH] I would love a professional pizza oven in my house [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But on the other hand, if it's other Italian foods, since I'm Italian, I really rarely will eat out.  Besides pizza, you have to have pizza out.  Um -- because just -- they don't have the same taste to me.  It depends -- you know, you have to find a really, really good Italian restaurant and then usually you're paying the money for it --
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  -- when you could just make it at home.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  And, I mean, definitely, um, some things, I think, are better at home, like -- I don't like pie crust in restaurants.  I don't know what it is, but it never --
R:  Tastes the same?
L:  -- tastes, like, the same as home made to me.
R:  But, see -- if you can -- if you can make a good pie crust -- I -- I don't think I can.  I haven't had much luck with that.
L:  Yeah, I lo- -- I love to make pie.
R:  Oh, so you're a baker?
L:  Yeah, I love to bake.  So -- and I think, you know, people usually like my crusts and it ta- -- like, somehow it gets flakier to me.  The ones in restaurants all taste like --
R:  Do they have --
L:  I don't know -- like, like the Pilfery[?] frozen crusts that you buy.
R:  Yeah.  I was going [inaudible] -- they have more -- does it seem like they have more lard in them or ...?
L:  I don't know if it's even --
R:  They seem heavier for some reason.
L:  It -- yeah, it's definitely heavier.  It's thicker, and it's more, like, cookie like than pastry like to me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, mine is -- I mean, it's not like puff pastry, but it's kind of got more that flaky puff pastry --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- feel to it.
R:  Now --
L:  Which I really like. [LAUGH]
R:  Now, there are cert- -- you know, it all depends on the restaurant you go to or it depends on the bakery you go to -- that you can make your preferences, but if it was any old restaurant -- you know, it depends on -- you know, the question that --
L:  Right.  In general I would rather eat at home, but if I could pick, like, a great restaurant, it would be out, definitely. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  If I had time to cook the things that I like to cook, then it would be in home, but if I have to, you know, if I want a good meal and I don't have the time, it would have to be the restaurant.
L:  Also, I have a baby, so it's kind of hard to take a baby out --
R:  Out --
L:  -- to eat a lot, where [LAUGH] it's much easier at home --
R:  And I really --
L:  to keep her occupied.
R:  Yeah, I really trying to stay away from fast food, so it would have to be a restaurant restaurant.  [SIGH] But we do like to go for breakfast a lot.
L:  Ooh, breakfast is my favorite meal.  I like to eat breakfast for dinner, too.
R:  Yeah, so do I.  If I had a choice, I'd ra- -- I usually get it at lunchtime, you know, or later in the day.  But, um, we have twenty four hour restaurants by us and that's what we usually do -- is go for breakfast, at any time of the day.
L:  Oh that's great.  Breakfast, like, late at night, after you've been out, is the best, too.
R:  Yeah, sometimes we go, like, two, three in the morning -- we'll go to a late show then we'll go to an all night restaurant and eat breakfast. [LAUGH]
L:  We never get to do that anymore. [LAUGH]
R:  I bet you don't.  How old is your child?
L:  She's eighteen months old.
R:  Eighteen months old, how sweet.  Now I have --
L:  Yes.  So, she's wonderful, but yes, no -- no more super late nights out for me. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, they'll come again.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I have fifteen nieces and nephews and, um, my sisters -- that's who I usually go with, so --
L:  Wow.
R:  They find -- they find time, you know, t- take turns or the husbands watch them.  That's why it's usually late night 'cause once the kids are asleep, then we can go out --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and so you definitely want -- and after a long day, you definitely want someone to serve you coffee.  That's another reason why I like restaurants -- 'cause I like coffee and they just keep pouring it in and pouring it in [LAUGH] or --
L:  I like coffee, but I don't drink very much of it.  For me it's, like, a little treat.  I'll get myself a Starbuck's.  Like, when I'm out and I need a pick me up, but I don't drink coffee every day.
R:  Oh, mine's daily, it's morning, noon and night.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's -- it's like, relaxes me for some reason. [LAUGH]
L:  But, yeah, there's something about coffee -- like, Starbuck's coffee, or good coffee out, that's so much better than coffee you can make at home.
R:  Yeah, I -- I --
L:  Well, I don't have any --
R:  -- spent a lot of money out.
L:  I don't have an espresso maker, so I'm sure that would make part of the difference, but even so --
R:  But then again, it's a hassle -- it's so much easier to go in and give a couple of dollars and you get what you want, than to have to try to make it where -- especially in an espresso maker, where like, you can get the right flavor and everything.
L:  Yeah, it's so good. [LAUGH] Ooh, now I want coffee. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, you're going to have to make yourself one, or go out. 
L:  I guess so.  My baby's napping, so I'll have to wait 'til she wakes up. [SIGH]
R:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] just trying to think about restaurants again.
L:  What other ki- -- what kind of foods do you not like to eat out, besides Italian?
R:  Ah, I -- you know, I'm pretty much open for anything.  I have never been to, like, a sushi bar or anything like that.  I'm not like -- I have cousins that try every kind of restaurant there is.  I've tried like, Thai food and different, you know, Indian foods.  Greek food is -- you know, they're all -- those are all okay -- they're an occasional thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um -- so I wouldn't choose a restaurant if it was like, ethnic in that way, but any family restaurant -- I do like and like I said, Mexican, Chinese.
L:  You should go try Japanese food.  You can get things other than sushi.  Some Japanese food is so amazing.
R:  Is it really good?
L:  Yes.  It's really, really good.
R:  You know, if I have someone to go -- like, if I have someone daring or someone says, "Oh I know this restaurant", or they're having this festival, then I usually will go and try something.
L:  Sometimes we go to, um, Japanese restaurants that have what they call the teppan[?] tables where they cook the food --
R:  Cook it right in front of you?
L:  -- in front of you.
R:  I always wanted to do that.
L:  And that is so fun and it tastes -- again that's something you can --
R:  That got to be kinda like a --
L:  -- never ever, ever make it taste that way at home.
R:  Right.
L:  My husband loves that kind of food, and we'll go -- and --
R:  That's what I was going to say -- gotta -- kinda gotta be like a special night, or a date night kind of a thing.
L:  Exactly.  We --
R:  Where you can really enjoy it.
L:  We last went there on New Year's Eve, with some friends.  And we like, rolled out of there because we ate so much, but it's so good and again, you just cannot match that flavor.
R:  What area are you in?
L:  Um, I'm in Southern California.
R:  Southern California.  I'm in Chicago.
L:  Ah, b- I'm sure they have teppan restaurants in Chicago.
R:  Yeah, I'm sure they do.
L:  I'm sure they have, like, a Benny Honner[?] which is the big chain that has that.
R:  They definitely do.  They -- actually, I almost had a chance to take a -- I'm a teacher -- I had a chance to take a group of students, but I let someone else take them -- go with them.
L:  You should go some night, because it's really mainstream, it's not -- it's not scary, it's not sushi, it's not raw.  If you like, like, Thai food, you will like it.
R:  Yeah, I -- I think I would.
L:  Um, Chicago has -- [LAUGH]
R:  I just gave up my one opportunity. [LAUGH] Maybe my other opportunity will come.
L:  Well, you have to go on a date or something.
R:  Yeah, it has to be something like that, where it's a special night.
L:  Or somebody's birthday, or --
R:  Right, where you're going to take them out, but that's always why f- you'd -- I'd rather like -- for s- -- for birthdays we always go out to eat.  We just -- you know, it's kinda go choose a restaurant -- the -- whoever the person's favorite restaurant, and try to do that.  It seems like, more special than -- because we do cook at home all the time.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, so that makes it more special, so -- for special occasions, when you're, you know, things are quick or you want to meet somebody -- eating out is always my preference.  Then you don't have to clean the house, too, to have guests over. [LAUGH]
L:  That's absolutely true [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, we -- we usually end up with a couple of special occasion restaurants that we go to, ah, for things.  Usually -- usually like, they're either Japanese or French, usually.  So -- 'cause again, French food i- it's just so hard to recreate at home.
R:  Right.
L:  Where, you know, good like, American style, family style food, barbeque, I can come pretty close, at home, to creating, you know --
R:  There -- you know it's --
L:  -- almost anything I can eat out, like that.
R:  That's to say, I think there's certain like, regular American type foods or things that you can't get out.  Like, I make like, chicken and dumplings and everyone's like, they'll never order it out because it's like, you know, the old country buffet might have it, but it's not like, really -- real food.
L:  Yeah, m- -- not moist and -- I love chicken and dumplings.
R:  Yeah.  It's like the home made and you can't beat the home made.
L:  Well, like, I made --
R:  Certain things you can't beat home made, you know.
L:  Yeah.  I made --
R:  But it's more American.
L:  -- pot roast last night and that's kind of one that I wouldn't ever order pot roast out --
R:  You wouldn't order out, yes.  And I -- I can make a really good roast.  We have a -- I have a recipe where you put, like, a consume in there and a can of beer and, um, these hot peppers and that's when it's cooking -- it just like, gets all the flavor in there.  And it's like --
L:  That sounds good. 
R:  And you can't -- no -- it's -- you ca- -- I would never order that out either.  So there are certain things that you have to have home cooked.  But, again [SIGH] -- I do like those restaurants.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh yeah.  Do you have a favorite restaurant?
