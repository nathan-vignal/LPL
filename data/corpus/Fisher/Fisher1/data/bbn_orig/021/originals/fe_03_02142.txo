L:  Hello.
R:  Hello. [SIGH]
L:  Hello.
R:  [LAUGH] Hi.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, [SIGH] I'm not sure what I'm doing. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] No, me either. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, okay, [SIGH] so, wh- -- I can't really -- for some reason my phone is a little choppy so, um -- [NOISE] okay, what was the topic?
R:  Ah, we're supposed to talk about eating food.
L:  Okay, food. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I guess at home or in a restaurant?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  I live in New York City.
L:  Okay, me too so ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is so funny, this is the first time I am doing this so I have no idea. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, me too. [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Okay.  Um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] okay, so I guess I'm -- I would rather go to a restaurant.
R:  Why?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Um, because like, you know, my apartment is really small, and by the time I go get groceries and [SIGH] etcetera it's -- it's very exhausting.  Also, um, you know, going out to eat in New York is kind of, you know, like a really social thing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] to do.  And, um, it's where you meet up with people and you spend time and catch up.  [SIGH] Y- you know, while you can't really do that in someone's apartment because most people's apartments are really small.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I hope you agree. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] I agree with that.  Mm.
L:  My God.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My phone.  I'm trying to find like a -- a space -- I'm like walking around.  Um ...  Oh, I'm sorry.
R:  That's all right.
L:  Gees.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] Um, so I guess you agree with that?
R:  [SIGH] Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Mostly I like to cook --
L:  [MN] One minute, hold on, I'm sorry.
R:  Okay.
L:  I can't h- -- I'm really trying to find a space.  I don't know why it's not wor- -- okay, there.  I'll just stand right here, it goes. 
R:  [LAUGH] I like to cook, um -- I like going out to restaurants better than cooking when the restaurant cooks better than I do.
L:  Right.
R:  So -- which isn't always.  So it depends on that.  But when the restaurant is good then I like that better.
L:  Right.  [SIGH] The thing --
R:  That way you don't have to wash --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- dishes too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But also though, [SIGH] um, I mean you really have to have all the ingredients to cook.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's why I really don't like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] 'Cause when I do cook and I do buy groceries I'll be eating the same thing for like five days in a row --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because, [SIGH] you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- then I have to go out and get like every little spice and it's just ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  So that's why I -- and sometimes -- you know the city, like it's cheaper -- just the same price to go get takeout [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:   -- um, than to cook something, and it's faster.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Granted it's just -- it's n- -- cooking is always, you know, better --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- cheaper, and it's healthier, but sometimes the -- the convenience factor of going out to eat is --
R:  Yeah.  That's --
L:  [MN] a lot better.  So ...
R:  -- that's true. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So what else can we talk about, this topic? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um --
L:  Do you go out to eat a lot, I guess, or ...?
R:  I don't actually that much because I -- my income does not exactly [LAUGH] fit with the prices of going out so --
L:  Right.
R:   -- incredibly well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  I totally understand.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm kind of like in the same -- definitely the same boat.  Um, [SIGH] but I have, um, I guess when I do go out to eat, um, and it's with a group.  If I'm with my boyfriend I'll kinda make him pay, so that way --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, [LAUGH] so that way going out to eat is, you know ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, the problem with going out to eat also that I find that's really annoying, [SIGH] um, is especially -- if it's -- if it's with a group of close friends I don't mind going out, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If someone orders a little more food or a few more drinks, that's nothing, you could split the bill.  [SIGH] But when you go out with a group of people you really aren't friendlier with and they order fifteen drinks, [SIGH] and you order like, [MN] you know, one, and then you have to split the bill.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's really annoying too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, that's my -- that's -- that's when I hate going out to eat --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I'd prefer to eat at home. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because I mean it's not worth paying one hundred dollars for a meal that you didn't really get anything out of, I guess.
R:  Right.  And the drinks are like much [NOISE] cheaper at home.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, completely.  [SIGH] But -- oh my God, I'm sorry, my phone.  Um, but the thing is, um, I don't know about your apartment, but my apartment is so small that I can't really have a lot of people over for like [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- dinner party.  You know, kind of [MN] --
R:  Yeah, I meet you there.
L:  [NOISE] Like there's not enough room to even have people come over to eat.  Like it's just me and my room mates, that's it. [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, definite -- there isn't -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I can -- I can fit like four people.
L:  We -- oh, my God, I -- I don't know why my cell phone is doing this.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think it's -- I think it's -- it's every time you talk [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it does this.  [LAUGH]:  
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Okay, I'm gonna stand still again, sorry, so ...
R:  That's okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Is your apartment big?
R:  No it's -- it's not.  Um, I have a table that like sits four people but that's -- that's it.  I can -- that's about how many people I can feed sitting down.
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  If -- if there were people like standing up and eating, I could probably fit more, but that's not that much fun --
L:  What about your --
R:  -- you know.
L:  What about your kitchen is it big enough to like --
R:  M- --
L:  -- m- --
R:  Well I can cook in it but it's not big enough for anyone to really help me.  Which means --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- that it's harder if you're cooking --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- for a lot of people. [SIGH]
L:  True.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No, I know, my kitchen's like a w- -- literally a wall unit. [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ...  Where do you live?
R:  I live near Union Square.
L:  Oh, okay. [MN] I live in the West Village.  Like, that's also why, because our apartments are [SIGH] more downtown, so I feel --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like they're probably smaller.  Do you --
R:  And the groceries are actually more expensive --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there too I've noticed.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  'Cause I have some friends --
L:  Where are they cheap?
R:  The -- the --
L:  Oh my God.
R:  -- groceries in the West Village are more expensive than the groceries here and it's like not that far.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes.
L:  I should -- see, but then, like, that's the problem, I'm not going to lug my groceries --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  from like the -- the upper east side down to, ah, [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the Village.
R:  But it's really bizarre, like the food -- there's like a Food Emporium on Sixth Avenue.  It co- -- the prices there are more than the Food Emporium that's like right by Union Square.
L:  Huh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Interesting.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And now that I know that -- yeah, that's why I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- basically don't cook.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean it's like -- oh my God, that's why I go out to eat a lot more.  Oh my God, my phone.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Sorry.  So does this s- stop?  Like how does it work?
R:  I -- I think it tells us.  Like it --
L:  Okay, hold on.
R:  -- comes back on when ten minutes --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- are up.
L:  -- okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] I don't understand why my phone is like this.  It's really weird.  It never happens like this. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, [SIGH] um ...
R:  [SIGH]
L:  So [LAUGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- how many times a week do you go out to eat?  I guess, do you usually go out on the weekends or weekday or just ...?
R:  [SIGH] Um ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] I usually go out probably like once a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- week for lunch, um, and like once or twice for dinner.
L:  Right. [SIGH]  So for l- lunch do you -- are you -- do you work?
R:  Um, I'm a graduate student. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, you're a graduate student.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  So that -- [SIGH] do you -- oh, so you -- okay I can [NOISE] --
R:  So I go out like when I'm gonna be at school around lunch time.
L:  Got you.
R:  Which is, this current semester, not very often. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right, right.  I see. [SIGH] Yeah, there's just so many good restaurants in New York.  It's really hard --
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  -- to not want to go out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to eat.
R:  I do want to go out all the time, but ...
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, it's -- it's hard, so ...
R:  And then the other challenge is always like going out to some place you haven't been before, or going back to some place you like.
L:  [SIGH] Oh my God --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- you are so right.  'Cause like although you like that place, you're like, "Oh, but there's a thousand more restaurants --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- in New York to go to".
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] So that's why whenever someone asks me, "What's your favorite restaurant?" I can't ever come up with something because I go to so many different ones.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] So ...
R:  And then when people come to visit from out of the city and they're like, "Pick some place".
L:  I know, 'cause you want to pick a place that like you've never been to, but they want you to pick a place that's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, geeze.
R:  Like you, ah, want to narrow it down a little bit?  Tell me like what you want to eat [SIGH] first.
L:  Oh. [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Oh my God, my phone.  I'm sorry.  It's --
R:  It's okay.
L:  -- so annoying for me.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Do you hear it?  You hear the sound like, right?
R:  No, I can hear you fine. [LAUGH]
L:  See, when you talk --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or sometimes it just -- it'll make this really bad static noise and I just can't hear you.
R:  That's really strange, but --
L:  It never happens, it's so bizarre.
R:  -- they do that.  The phones do that --
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH]
R:  -- sometimes.  I don't know why.
L:  Um, so how long you been living in the city?
R:  Um, two years, about.
L:  Two years.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay. [SIGH] Oh ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm like [LAUGH] trying to think of something. [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Like what else can we talk [LAUGH] about?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um ... mm ... 
R:  Mm.
L:  [MN] Mm.  [LIPSMACK] I also don't eat at home because [NOISE] um, I can't carry groceries back and forth, and I refuse to go the grocery store every day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So that's like another tidbit. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Like it's -- like it's definitely really annoying. [LAUGH] very fast.
L:  But I -- I seem to visit my like local deli more than like my grocery store, sometimes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know why.  [NOISE] So, although it seems kind of sketchy.
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  So ...  I don't know. [SIGH]
R:  But, yeah, I think those work out better sometimes, anyway.  They just have like what you need right there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So ...  So is our ten minutes up? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I -- I think -- I think it comes -- it will probably come on like, you know, when you're using a phone card?  And it --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- comes on and says like, "Your time's up now".  [SIGH] I think it'll --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- probably do that.  Probably.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's probably [LAUGH] -- mm.
L:  Oh my God.  So what are you in graduate school for?  Although we're getting off the subject completely, maybe we shouldn't.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I get nervous.  Um --
R:  Sociology.
L:  Oh, great.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  I'm like, ah.  Sorry, I really can't hear you.  It's like having issues[?] on my phone.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, let's see, what else can we talk about?  So --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- okay, what's your favorite kind of food [NOISE] to go out [LAUGH] to eat? [NOISE]
R:  Um, well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm vegetarian, so I like to go to vegetarian restaurants the best. [NOISE]
L:  Oh.  I've been Vegetarian Paradise in -- I don't know if you --
R:  Yeah, that's good.
L:  On West -- it's like -- do you go to NYU?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay that's -- it's kind of around that area, that's why --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] [MN] I really like that place.
R:  Yeah, it's really good.
L:  They have that -- that mango chicken thing.  Oh, that's so good. [MN].
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Um, [SIGH] well, okay.
R:  What --
L:  Um ...
R:  What places -- what kind of places do you like?
L:  [SIGH] I don't know.  I'm pretty like open to anything --
R:  That's --
L:  Really.  I don't really Mex- --
R:  That's really good.
L:  I don't really like Mexican food that much though.
R:  No, me either. [LAUGH]
L:  So that's kind of something I [MN] kind of don't like going to. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but I'm fairly open to everything.
R:  That -- that's --
L:  Um ...
R:  -- always convenient.  I like going out --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to eat with people like that because it makes it much easier to choose a place.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Also, I'm not also keen on like steak kinda houses --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because [NOISE] I mean I'll ha- -- I'll have steak but I don't realy need like a whole thing of steak.  So --
