L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  This is the shop [inaudible].  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  This is Carla.
L:  Hi, Carla.
R:  Where do you live?
L:  Ah, I guess we supposed not to ask this kind of question.
R:  Oh, really?  We always tell each other what state we're from. [LAUGH]
L:  You are? [LAUGH] Oh, cool.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Well, I um, my state is Kansas.  Which ah, state --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- are you from?
R:  Pennsylvania.
L:  Pennsyl- -- oh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how's the weather there? [LAUGH]
R:  Beautiful today.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, as a matter of fact --
L:  We had good weather too.
R:  Yeah, as a matter of fact, our topic's food and we had our first cook out tonight, so --
L:  Oh, did you really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, so do you prefer e- -- e- -- eating out or barbecuing in?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] I always prefer eating out.  I just can't afford to eat out.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah that's exactly it.  I always say that I like to eat out, but, ah, as you say it's expensive and it's sometimes not good for your health.
R:  Mm.  That's the truth too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Actually I -- I -- if I had to eat out all the time, I wouldn't like it.
L:  That's -- that's true also, yeah.  Ah, but sometimes it's convenient, isn't it?
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Sometimes it's good to buy food and, ah, bring it in and um, ah, you know, eat --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and enjoy it in the -- in family, um, and ah, um, all these kind of things that you can do with your family inside.
R:  That's true.
L:  What type of food do you like the best?
R:  [MN] al- almost anything. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My problem is eating too much, not too little. [LAUGH]
L:  That's true, yes.
R:  I like -- like just about anything.  I'm -- I really love seafood, but I like just about --
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  -- anything.  How about you?
L:  -- that's another thing that I like.  Seafood.  Yeah, I like seafood too.
R:  Yeah.  We don't get much here in Pennsylvania fresh, so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Is tha- -- oh, that's right, you're far.  In Kansas, we don't get very much, ah, fresh seafood either --
R:  No.
L:  -- but when I used to live in California, boy --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you could go and get very fresh -- the first -- the you know, same day ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, ah, salmon --
R:  Ooh, yeah.
L:  Salmon is not that pop- popular in California, ah, or at least when I was there.
R:  Really?
L:  And, ah, well, I guess it is.  Ah, we -- we were not looking for heal- -- that healthy --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and our cholesterol wasn't -- not that high.
R:  That's right.  And -- and the good fish oils and all that that you're supposed to eat now ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  S- -- and they say salmon is good but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't -- it tastes good too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's more close to chicken, don't you think so?
R:  Yeah.  How do you cook it?
L:  [MN] I just ah, put it in the oven, and a little bit of, ah, fresh, ah, lemon juice --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or lime juice or just regular lime -- ah, lemon juice.  And that's it.
R:  Oh, well that's easy.
L:  The w- -- ah -- sometimes I, ah, add ah, little bit of chopped onion and then the fresh onion.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  How do you cook it?
R:  Well, I've started poaching it and I found I really like that --
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, I've been poaching it in wine --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I mean that's about as easy as it gets. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, it's --
R:  You just bring a little wine to a boil and [SIGH] --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- throw in the fish and ten minutes later it's done.  And it really gives it a nice flavor.  And I generally add a little lemon juice to the -- to the wine too.
L:  Good, yeah, yes.  Ahah.  And, ah, is this how they cook it in the restaurant too?  Which is very tasty.
R:  Sometimes.  Um, actually that was the first place I had it.  When I started on my health food kick, the first time I ever ordered salmon it was poached.
L:  Ahah.
R:  And I loved it.  I said, "Oh, my gosh, th- -- "and I had never thought to make it that way it's just --
L:  Really?  That's --
R:  It's so simple.
L:  That's the first time I'm hearing poaching, ah, --
R:  It's very good that way.
L:  I -- I'm wonder if you can do with any other, ah, fish also.
R:  Yeah, you can, but salmon's about the best, and, ah, you know why?  One thing it does is, you know, salmon's kind of fatty?
L:  Ahah.
R:  It -- it sort of takes a little bit of the fat out of it too.
L:  Oh, discard it.  That's true, yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's true, yes, yes.
R:  But it -- it really gives it a nice -- I -- I like the flavor of fish anyway, you know --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- I'm a -- I am -- I really do enjoy fish, but --
L:  Yes, ahah.
R:  -- that gives it a little bit -- you know, it's a nice mild flavor --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and you don't really taste the wine.  It just give the fish a -- a very nice flavor.
L:  The fish is a little bit -- yeah, when you cook the wine you -- it goes away --
R:  Right.
L:  The alcohol goes away.
R:  Right, and you're boiling it --
L:  Yes, that's --
R:  -- so all it does is really give you the liquid.
L:  Give's a different flavor, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, ah, when you go to the restaurant, what do you order?  You order seaf- food, or -- you order --
R:  Yes, if I think it'll be good.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Ahah.  You like it --
R:  Yeah, well like I said, it's hard to get good seafood around here.
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  But we do have a couple of restaurants that are -- are very, you know, good with seafood and -- yeah, that's probably my preference.  And I'll or- -- [MN] yeah I'll actually -- I went out last weekend and I had prime rib --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I very seldom eat beef at home.
L:  Oh.
R:  So that was just kind of a splurge.
L:  Ahah.  Yeah, I l- -- I was just going to say, I like a steak too, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, ah -- oh, prime rib?  I thought you said --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a steak.  No, a prime rib is another one.
R:  Well, prime rib is, yeah, like steak.
L:  Yeah, that's -- oh, steak too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I like to eat the steak out especially, because, ah, for some reason taste ver- better and when they put like, a steak sauce --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or a like, um --
R:  Different seasonings.
L:  Yes, different seasonings.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Mushroom sauce on top of it.
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  Oh, yes.  Sounds good. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm going to have to go eat dinner again [LAUGH] after this conversation.
L:  [LAUGH] There you go. Yes.
R:  Now, are you a fast food eater?  Do you go to fast food, like McDonalds and Burger King and that?
L:  We go once -- yeah, we go ah, more often now that we have younger, ah, child, but ah --
R:  Ah.
L:  I really don't enjoy that much fast food.
R:  No.
L:  If I go, um, I just go to eat, you see what I'm saying, you know --
R:  Quickly.  Right.
L:  Quickly, yes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, I rather to go to a good restaurant and, ah, not a buffet, and get waited on --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and get feed you food.
R:  Well, yeah, if you've got young children --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you're -- you're -- you must cook every night, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, we do.  Oh, yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, yes, yeah.  I cook every night and it's a break when I go out and, ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I enjoy the time when I go out.
R:  That's true.  I had three kids --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I said I cooked three meals a day for thirty years --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- and now all my kids -- well, I have a grand daughter that's here a lot of the time --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and -- but I don't have to cook every night any more --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and it's wonderful.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  I -- I'm really tired of cooking.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I enjoyed it when my kids were home.
L:  Tell me about it.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well you enjoy it, ah, sometime and you, ah -- I -- I like cooking but, you know, sometimes --
R:  I used to. [LAUGH]
L:  -- you get ti- -- tired of it too.  Yes, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] And don't you think we just have so many choices that -- I mean, how many times do you stand in the grocery store and say, "Oh, what am I gonna make for dinner tonight?", you know?
L:  For dinner, yeah.
R:  And we're just surrounded by, you know, so much food, it's -- I think we're so spoiled sometimes.
L:  Sometimes, yes we are.  Yeah, that's true.  But I wish they could take, ah, um, too much grease out of the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, restaurants.  Even, ah, you see it in ah, fairly good ah, restaurant, as much as we can afford to go to, but still they're greasy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and ah --
R:  It's not like home cooking.
L:  No, no, it's, um, -- but you know, for -- the convenience is good.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I like -- 
R:  And you don't have to clean up. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Tell me about that.
R:  That's my favorite part. [LAUGH]
L:  Cleaning th- -- yeah.  Cleaning the, ah, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- oven.  Cleaning --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- the stove, cleaning the --
R:  Doing the dishes. [LAUGH]
L:  -- dishes.  Oh, oh, yes, ah --
R:  Yeah, I think I would still enjoy cooking if somebody would clean up after me. [LAUGH] But --
L:  That would be another choice, also, but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- ah, as you said, eating out is ah, the benefit of not --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- cleaning and everything and -- yeah, it's -- I kind of like this kind of calls, I enjoy talking to --
R:  I do too. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, you doing this for a long time?
R:  Ah, no.  This is my third one, I think.
L:  Oh, there you go.  It seems that everybody's new here. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I -- I think you can only do four, if I understand it correctly, but I'm not sure.
L:  Four a day?
R:  No, four altogether, I think.
L:  That's all?
R:  I think so.  Have you done more than that?
L:  No, no --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I haven't.  I didn't know that.  Oh.
R:  That was what I understood from the email, but I may be wrong.
L:  Ahah.
R:  [LAUGH] You know.
L:  No, no, you're probably right.  I didn't read it correctly.
R:  I just zipped through it very quickly, so ...
L:  Yeah.  But anyway, yeah, eating in the restaurant is really enjoyable, and um, I um, order -- do you or- -- or- -- like salad too?
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ahah.
R:  Yeah, and salads always taste better in a restaurant too, don't they?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Have you noticed that?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Like, mine are so dull at home. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And sometimes when we go pizza -- for a pizza I --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I order a salad and th- -- and their dressing, I like the blue cheese --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- u- um, dressing and, ah --
R:  Oh, I've gone to low fat, low cal dressings, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  I've tried those, but --
R:  [SIGH] Ah.
L:  -- still I gained weight --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on nothing, yeah. [SIGH] Then --
R:  I think everybody's fights their weight anymore.
L:  Mhm.  Do you like dessert?
R:  Oh, yes, that's --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- my downfall, right there. [LAUGH]
L:  Ahah, ahah.  Yes, me --
R:  Yes, pastries, any kind of pastries --
L:  Pastries, yeah, yeah.
R:  Cakes, cookies, pies -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  What's your favorite pie?
R:  Oh my favorite pie.  Probably strawberry rhubarb.
L:  Oh, that's a good one too, but --
R:  Yeah, we have --
L:  -- I still enjoy um, old fashioned, ah, ah, apple pie --
R:  Apple?  Yeah.
L:  -- with -- with, ah, some ice cream --
R:  Ice cream. [LAUGH]
L:  -- on top of it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I think everybody likes that too.
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  But I've -- I'd haven't -- I couldn't tell you the last time I baked a pie.  I've, um, there again, since my kids aren't home I don't bake much either.
L:  Ahah.  And, ah --
R:  I just buy.
L:  You --
