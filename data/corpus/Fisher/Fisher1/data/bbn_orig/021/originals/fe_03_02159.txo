L:  Hi, I'm Brenda.
R:  Yeah, hi, Brenda.  I'm Wayne.  How do --
L:  Hi, Wayne.
R:  -- you do?
L:  Fine.  How are you?
R:  Very good.  Uh, as far as eating at a restaurant or home goes, uh, I'm a cook [LAUGH].
L:  Ah.
R:  Yeah.  So [COUGH], uh, not -- not that I don't enjoy eating someone else's food --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but, uh, I -- I have greater faith in my own [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what's in it that way, right?
R:  Ah, yes, yes exactly --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- an- and I guess as a result my -- my preference is to remain at home.
L:  I see.  Well, I cook --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I have two daughters and a husband, so I -- I really have to cook, and we, mm, probably eighty percent of the time we'll eat at home, occasionally go out to a restaurant [LIPSMACK], or, uh, instead of going out to a restaurant, have pizza delivered so I don't have to cook.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I've, uh, uh, I've gone that road, but it's -- it's probably rare and -- and only because not having children --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that's [COUGH] one meal, uh, which I -- you know, I don't know, never having children, I, uh -- I mean, I've never cooked for them.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And -- but --
L:  Well, it- it's kind of like if you don't cook then everybody sits around and, "Okay, what are we going to eat? What are we going to eat?".
R:  Well --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I expect there would be some of that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- however, uh, I don't know why I think it would be any different.  I suppose it would depend upon the age of the child.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, maybe if I had children, maybe I'd order out more, I don't know.  I'd probably still cook at home because that's -- that seems to be what I do.
L:  Right.
R:  Um --
L:  It's less expensive that way --
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  -- also, as opposed to going out.
R:  -- I mean, just the -- sure, just the idea of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of having children and the amount of energy it takes, not only to cook for them, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh [COUGH] just to care for them, you know, is -- is pretty taxing.
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh, but it's -- it's just a preference that I have.  I know an awful lot of men don't -- don't cook.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And there are some women who don't cook [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  That's true.
R:  So, I guess they have to rely upon someone else to do it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh, as a child I wanted to cook.  My father was a cook, so --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- you know, as a youngster I wanted to emulate him, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- hung around the kitchen, and the first thing he taught me was clean up.
L:  [LAUGH] You have to know that if you're going to cook.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Yep.
R:  That was the first lesson he taught me and --
L:  Unless you have someone else that will do it for you --
R:  I --
L:  -- which is not real likely [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] No, not in my circumstances --
L:  [LAUGH] Uh-huh.
R:  -- I don't -- don't happen to have that luxury.  So, to me, cleaning up is part of the cooking process.
L:  Exactly.  Right.
R:  And it goes along with it.  It's -- it's one of the things, I guess, that distinguishes eating out from doing it at home, is if --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- someone else has the burden of doing all the cleaning.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, to me, cleaning and cooking are simultaneous.  They --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they --
L:  Yeah.  Both have to happen.
R:  Yeah, they do.
L:  Or if one happens, you have to do the other.
R:  Yah, and then there's the issue of -- of, um -- I guess all of us have probably seen, uh, things on television, if nothing else, where people go to restaurants and they discover [LAUGH] things that are --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- that you wouldn't want in your own kitchen.
L:  Yes.
R:  And there is, I think a health issue, which is also, uh, uh --
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  -- not a primary [SIGH] motivation, but probably a secondary motivation --
L:  Right --
R:  -- for cooking at home --
L:  -- something that's always in the back of your mind because you don't know how clean --
R:  Absolutely, Brenda, I --
L:  -- the place is and --
R:  I -- I mean, I don't know, right.
L:  Right.
R:  Right.  I don't have a clue.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we've seen these stories too, uh [COUGH] where, uh, people who are employed by restaurants as acts of either -- well, it's malice --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, it may not be directed toward you specifically, but you could be the -- the recipient 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of their particular anger or their jokes, or their just plain nastiness.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you don't really [LAUGH] know what's in that salad.  I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah, that's scary.  You don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what you're going to be eating.
R:  That is correct.  I don't know, and not that I know everything that I buy, say at Farmers Market or the grocery store to cook at home, but at least I can wash it and clean it and know --
L:  The best that -- yeah, best that you can --
R:  Ah, right --
L:  -- get everything off --
R:  -- as best -- sure, sure -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as much --
L:  I feel a lot of people nowadays also, more people probably eat out because of the husband and wife both working.
R:  This is exactly right.
L:  You know, and -- and if I was the working -- a working wife, I wouldn't want to come home and cook and clean up.  Y- you're just --
R:  Well, that --
L:  -- too tired and --
R:  I -- I was a working husband and still did all the cooking.
L:  Mhm.
R:  My -- my wife is not a cook --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I can assure you, uh, that after working twelve hour days --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- which is what I used to do --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I wasn't as anxious to cook.
L:  No [LAUGH].  I would think not.
R:  Coming home at six o'clock in the evening --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as I was when I -- you know, on my days off.
L:  Mhm, exactly.
R:  So -- and, you know, there are still women out there who, uh, because historically, I think, women have been relegated more into the kitchen, men who think that a woman's job is often more of a hobby [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they think, "Oh, well, she can come home and cook for me and one or two --"
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  "-- children, and because she doesn't really have a job" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and --
L:  Right.
R:  Um, this -- this attitude, while I don't think it's as, uh, pervasive as it used to be --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is still pretty --
L:  Yeah, not as much as it used to be, but it's still there.
R:  It's still out there.
L:  Yep.
R:  That's right.  That's right, because I -- I know when I do go to the grocery store to shop, uh, uh, I find that, uh, I don't talk to women or men unless they look particularly keen, under the age of forty --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because they don't know anything.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And if I see a women who is, say, seventy or eighty --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that's where I get my advice --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on things to [COUGH] look for and things to do, so I can take the food home and maybe do a little bit better job on it.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  But --
L:  Yeah, the young -- young ones don't -- they just get the -- the fast food or the easy --
R:  [COUGH].
L:  -- microwave or in the oven type foods.  Something quick and easy.
R:  Well, this -- this is another thing with which you have experience and I don't.
L:  Mm, yes.
R:  If I had children, you know, it's -- it's very easy for people who don't have children --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to say, oh, well, I would blah, blah, blah, blah, blah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, you don't have a clue, I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Pe- --
L:  It's a different world [LAUGH].
R:  It is a totally different world --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and people like me who don't have them, don't really know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what I would do if I had to, you know, say, for example, two children coming home in an hour --
L:  Mhm.  Actually I had one just come home [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, and y- -- and they are hungry.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- i- if they are nothing else --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- if they're awake --
L:  They're hungry.
R:  -- they're hungry.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And, you've got to prepare your food unless you happen to have a -- a great deal of money and e- --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, even though their preference may be for eating out --
L:  R- -- oh, yeah.
R:  -- my God --
L:  But they don't pay for it.
R:  Well, not only --
L:  So, that's not how it happens [LAUGH] usually.
R:  That's true.  They may not pay for it economically, but they may pay for it in other ways --
L:  Yes, that's true.
R:  -- because of the --
L:  Weight gain for one.
R:  -- you know, the amount of -- yeah, the weight gain, the  ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  The quality of the food when you eat out to me is not, in some places, for sure --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, is not as nutritious nor as good as -- and I think once a child develops certain habits, and again I'm an expert on raising children, having raised none of them --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] uh, that, you know, that -- that it can't be healthy, some of that stuff.
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  So, yeah, and at -- at least at home, as a parent, you would have a certain amount of control and possibly teach them to develop better, safer, healthier eating habits --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than say, going to a place that is, uh, not as healthy.
L:  Right.  I hope I'm doing that.
R:  Well, yeah --
L:  I think --
R:  -- it's -- it's not as if parents don't have enough responsibility.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH], yeah.
R:  I mean, you know, but, i- it's -- it's difficult and -- and it -- it places a greater burden I guess --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on the --
L:  That's funny that cooking is the topic now, because I have no power.  I have no electricity, so I don't know what we're having for dinner tonight [LAUGH].
R:  Uh, without electricity --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that can be a real problem --
L:  -- and my --
R:  I'm very fortunate in that I ha-  I, uh cook with gas.
L:  Ah, my whole house is electric, so ...
R:  Yeah, and even if -- if my, you know -- if my electricity did go off, you -- you know --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- which it does --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if there's a storm or something --
L:  Right.
R:  -- sometime.
L:  That's what happened here.  You'd still be set, you could still eat.
R:  I can still cook at home --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because of the fact I have gas, and, um, at least I can boil water [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, uh ...
L:  You could have soup that way.
R:  Well, I -- I also trust gas more than I do electricity.  I think it's f- ...
