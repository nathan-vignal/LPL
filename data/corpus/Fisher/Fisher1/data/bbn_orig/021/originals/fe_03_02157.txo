L:  Hi, this is Irvine[?].
R:  Oh, hi.  This is Laurie.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good, um, w- -- I'm from Atlanta.
L:  Oh, okay, I'm in New York.
R:  Oh, okay, that's great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um ...
L:  So, uh, so -- so, I guess this is for restaurant or, uh, at home.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, what do you prefer?
R:  Um, I always like to go to restaurants, um, I mean, it's really more expensive and I, you know, I realize that, but if I had, um, you know, the -- as much money as I wanted to spend, I would eat out every single night.  I really would [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah?
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  Uh, actually, I'd rather, um, [SIGH] eat at home, because you know what's in the food [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  You know, I -- you know exactly what you put in and exactly how much fat or whatever that you, uh, you know, put in [SIGH], but, um, if you go to a restaurant, I don't know what they put in, so, uh, that's kind of like -- actually I have a very good example, the other day -- over the weekend I, uh, went to a restaurant, I ate out, and [SIGH] my stomach bothered me all night [SIGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so, that -- so, I don't know what was in that --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- thing.  Uh, they don't give you the full detail in a restaurant --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- of what- whatever, you know, spices or whatever they put in.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you know, I like to cook at home, and eat -- of course I love cooking, so that may be, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just me, but, uh [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  You know, so ...
R:  Well, you're right about that 'cause you really don't know what they're putting in it, and actually you don't know who's cooking it, if they're, you know -- they could have a cold or something worse, but yeah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's [LAUGH] -- but you know, um, I -- I mean, I guess what I try to do is go to places that have been good in the past and so I tend to, you know, have a good expectation of those places but, [SIGH] um -- but you're right, I've had experiences like that too occasionally, and then you're hear the really bad stories sometimes in the newspaper [SIGH], somebody really getting a food poisoning experience, so, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there's definite advantages to eating at home.  I agree with you [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But also -- I mean, one of the things I don't like to clean up that much, and once you kind of get that into a rhythm, it's not so bad, but that's the worst part for me.  If I could have somebody clean it all up, I could get real creative in the kitchen, so ...
L:  Right, right.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, that -- yeah, that -- I like cl- -- I -- I hate cleaning when I'm done with cooking too [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- but I -- I li- I love the cooking part, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, to do that, uh, I -- I have to, you know, sacrifice [SIGH] cleaning and then I -- I, you know, I just clean after I have done cooking [SIGH] so, uh, you know, I like to cook.  That's why, [SIGH] you know, i- it doesn't [SIGH] seem much of a hassle after, you know, you're done.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, the cleaning part is not -- it doesn't --
R:  Well, that's --
L:  -- not so ...
R:  -- good.  You've got a good attitude.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  No, really, 'cause that's part of the -- that's my block, you know, is that I'll say, "Oh, I just don't want to deal with this" and I'll, you know, I'll even kind of rationalize it by saying, "Well, you know, I know this costs a lot of money to go out to eat --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but if I was heating the stove, and I was running the water, all this would cost some more" and it's really not true, 'cause it's like three times the price --"
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  -- to go out, you know.
L:  -- sometimes even more, if, you know -- it depends where you go, so ...
R:  Yeah, I'm talking about just your moderate priced places like, you know --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- Red Lobster [LAUGH].
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Um, but that's the hardest thing for me, is just getting it all together and cleaning it up and, you know, I don't know, I need to start doing it again, but I guess what's happened is, I've been to some of the really nicest restaurants in Atlanta and you can get spoiled.  I mean, um, you know, where it's like every course is really -- it's more like the presentation than the food --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so you think, you know, "Wow" and that's really part of it, the whole psychological experience of the room and the waiters and the whole thing, and you can really get very into that.  I mean, it's more about that than the food, so that's kind of the secret, and the really nice restaurants realize that's what brings you back [SIGH], so ...
L:  Right.
R:  -- yeah, I think that was the second question.  They asked, "What was your -- what's like a perfect meal?" and I guess that would be, uh, like at one of those really, really, upscale four star restaurants [LAUGH], you know, just to have everything really -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- not -- I don't like quantity, like some of these restaurants now give you too much food, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's just in small beautiful arranged kind of, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- proportions, and I like seafood, which is not something I cook a lot at home, so it would probably be something like in a seafood plate.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I like -- I like a nice, um  -- my perfect would be like a nice juicy, uh, steak or something [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with potatoes or whatever [SIGH] but, uh, yeah, that's 'bout it, but that's occasionally -- that -- you know, otherwise -- you can't eat that every day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  It's like --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- killing yourself --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- but, uh -- [LAUGH]
R:  That's right [LAUGH].
L:  You know, but now these days are coming up with steamed stuff like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- steamed vegetables or, uh -- for healthy cooking so, uh, I don't know how often you eat out.
R:  Um, well, let me think [LAUGH].  Almost every day for lunch I eat out, so ...
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, and sometimes breakfast too, but I've kind of cut back on that and tried -- but I don't eat m- -- I try to eat my main meal at lunch --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and have something light at home for dinner if I even eat that.  Um, I don't -- I didn't come from that kind of background, but I think it's the most -- but, you know, normal thing to do is to have your main meal in the middle, but I came from a family who -- they were like regimented and wanted to eat at six thirty every night.  By then I was already [SIGH] just famished, you know, I -- and it wasn't a good way to -- to remember my childhood, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I don't do that to myself now that I'm grown up.  I try to eat just, you know, when I'm hungry, usually before -- way before six thirty [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But yeah, so ...
L:  Yeah, that's a good idea.  That's what I like to do.  I like to, like, eat a big lunch and then very small dinner.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you know, you -- you know, you usually you don't like go[?] -- after dinner y- you, uh, you know, uh, stay home and then you go to sleep after that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so it doesn't [SIGH] uh, dissolve[?] -- after l- -- for lunch it is, you- you're still working --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then you're still moving around, so that -- you get, uh, you know, you get that lunch, uh, pretty, uh, um, uh, get into your, uh, system.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you don't have to worry about that but, uh, for dinner, if you eat a very heavy dinner then you go to sleep and then it stays there and then you --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, you get sick or whatever.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, you know, that's a good thing to do, is to eat big lunch and then a small dinner.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's what I think.
R:  Yeah, I think so too.
L:  You know.
R:  Um, well, you know, I live in the south and there's still a lot of that fried southern cooking here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I've tried to avoid that because it gets into you, you know, you could start eating that all the time.  For a while I went vegetarian, but that hasn't worked out real well 'cause I just seem to need more protein, so I just wasn't getting enough.  I just couldn't do it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, you know, I said I tried to eat -- um, I really have sworn off the fried -- 'cause everything is like -- I go -- yeah, chicken sandwiches are just so big here and they're always fried.  Well, they have some grilled, but most of it's fried and it's -- it's awful.  And eating out, you know, some of it is just terrible, the look -- I don't know, Wendy's is really bad and, uh, [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah, Burger King, McDonalds --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and all that.
R:  I've done it though.  I've gotten desperate enough to actually get that stuff.
L:  Yeah, oh yeah.  That --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stuff is very bad.
R:  Gross.  It's, uh -- I'm not doing it any more.  I just swore off of it, and I don't know if you -- well, you probably have, uh, it's a place called Schlotzky's.  Is that in New York?
L:  Um, it sounds familiar, but I'm not sure.
R:  Okay.  It's kind of a -- I mean it's not a real deli.  They call themselves a deli, but it's a chain --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's just -- I couldn't believe it.  I ordered something there, it was like child size, it was so tiny [SIGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and it was so expensive and I'm still mad about it, so --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- I mean, it's either like you get these huge amounts or you get nothing.  It doesn't make any sense.
L:  Right.
R:  So, it's hard.  But I eat a lot at Chinese restaurants because, you know, I feel like it's a good balance, and different ethnic kind of restaurants because at least I feel like it's sauteed and it's a little bit less of fat.
L:  Do you have, uh, Subways in Atlanta?
R:  Do I have what?
L:  Subway.  Subway restaurants.
R:  Um, what's it called?
L:  Subway.
R:  Oh yeah.  Yeah, we do.  We do.
L:  Yeah, that's, uh, I think that's now a new kind of, uh, healthy cooking.  They have, uh, you know, different stuff, but it's supposed to be -- supposedly, uh, very healthy stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it's like alternative to McDonalds or, uh, Burger King or Wendy's or something, you know.
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, that -- I like that.  Sometimes I get that, and, uh, so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, instead of going to get that fried burger or something.
R:  [LAUGH] I know.  They even have that guy Gerard on TV.  He lost all that weight from Subway and that's --
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  -- I believe he could -- you know, 'cause if you just keep your portions to a certain amount --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and at least their bread at Subway is better 'cause it's better --
L:  Right, that's, uh, fresh bread and, uh, you know, if you go to McDonalds, it's like, uh, like they are frying everything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh ...
