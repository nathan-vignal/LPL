R:  Hi, my name is Nick.
L:  Hello, how you doing?  My name is Mark.  How you doing today?
R:  I'm doing well.  How are you?
L:  Also doing well.  Thank you.
R:  Good.  Where are you from?
L:  I live in um, Richwood, New Jersey --
R:  Oh, that's -- I'm --
L:  -- are you familiar with that area?
R:  Yeah, I'm from ah, Cleveland, Ohio.
L:  Oh, Cleveland, Ohio?  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  So, ah --
L:  But you think you're familiar with this area, though?
R:  Excuse me?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I've -- I've been to New Jersey.  I -- I'm not--
L:  Okay, cool.
R:  -- maybe I'm not completely familiar with the area.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well no, how nice.  All right, so we're talking about um --
R:  Food, I guess.
L:  Food, well -- well, yeah.  What we like, better um, eating in ah, restaurants or eating at home.
R:  Right.  Well, I --
L:  So what do --
R:  For me, I don't know.  It depends on the um, on the restaurant, but ah, I'm -- I'm seventeen, so ah, --
L:  Oh, really?  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I mean, I -- I -- I'm a young one, but, yeah -- but both my parents cook very well, and, ah, I mean, they cook -- eat like -- they kinda alternate nights for which to cook.  And -- but -- but, yeah, I've been -- I mean, there's always good restaurants to go to.  What do you think?
L:  That's nice.  Um.  I'm twenty one.  I like to ah -- my -- I live at home still and actually, my parents cook a lot of food for me which is really great.
R:  Right.
L:  Ah, you can't beat free food.  Especially --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- when you're trying to save some money.
R:  If you're strapped for cash, yeah.
L:  I mean -- yeah.  Um, but yeah, I -- I eat a lot at home.  I like eating out.  I eat out probably maybe once or twice every two weeks, or -- you know, maybe a couple of times a month, or whatever.
R:  Right.
L:  And, ah, I love ah, I love Chinese food, going to the Chinese buffet.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's good stuff.
R:  That's good stuff.  But, you know, there's good Chinese and there's bad Chinese.  But even when it's bad --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Chinese, it's still pretty good.
L:  Yeah, I know, yeah.  But there's American Chinese and there's --
R:  Chinese Chinese.
L:  Chinese Chinese.  Yeah, I've actually never been to a, um, [NOISE] like a, you know, probably what would be considered a good Chinese restaurant.
R:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Um, I want to go, because I -- I hear the um, like I hear the sushi's really good at those places.
R:  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  A -- the, ah, sushi's ah, Japanese though.
L:  Oh, is it?  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  But, you know.  Similar foods though.
L:  Yeah, sure.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Very similar.
R:  Lot of rice.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Things like that.
L:  Yeah.  Lot a rice and -- and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- chick -- like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but mostly rice.
R:  Mhm.  Have you ha- --
L:  Um.
R:  Go on.
L:  Yeah, so for the most part I eat -- eat a lot of um -- eat a lot at home, like I'll eat all kinds of, ah, you know, proteins, bananas, I mean, not bananas um, bananas with peanut butter on 'em.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Steak.  I have like, at least three eggs a day.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] and, ah, just -- just a lot of -- lot of meat.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I eat a lot of meat.  And try to -- try to eat healthy and try to eat lots of vegetables and stuff like that too.
R:  Right.  Yeah, b- -- ah, my parents tend to cook like, a lot of, ah -- I ah, I guess you wouldn't call it like, exotic, but not really like, I mean -- my -- my dad cooks a lot of like, kinda elaborate stir fries and stuff.
L:  Oh, really, okay --
R:  Things like that.
L:  -- that's cool.
R:  But they're, you know, it's really good.  And, you know, every now and then they'll make pretty basic things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then me, the only thing I can really make is popcorn, but you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, I mean, I -- I -- I'd like to get interested in like, cooking stuff, for myself, but, ah --
L:  Yeah.  That's cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I have a friend who just loves to cook, and he's probably -- sounds -- sounds like the same kind of thing, he just loves to stir fry things, put --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all different combinations of, you know, vegetables, green peppers, yellow peppers, all kinds of stuff, in a -- in a pan and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and make a sauce and -- and just -- just -- it's out of this world.
R:  Yeah, can't beat it.  It's good --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- good stuff.
L:  Have a little stir fry.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How 'bout fast food.  Do you do fast food?
R:  Um, kind of.  Not really.  I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I try not to.  'Cause I mean, like, the more you know about it, the less you want to eat there.
L:  Right, yeah.  It --
R:  One of those things, you know.
L:  -- it's -- it's -- it's really bad, yeah.
R:  Yeah, especially like, Taco Bell.  Like, once you find out about Taco Bell, you just -- you never want to eat there again. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, yeah.  I just -- I just refuse to eat at any of the ah -- any of the fast food places, just -- it's unbelievable how bad they are.
R:  Yeah, that's good.  Like I -- I -- I try not to, and every now and then I -- I will.  But --
L:  Yeah, I mean, if there's -- if I'm starving and there's no food except for a McDonalds hamburger, then I guess I'll eat it, but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Likewise.  But, yeah, um, I -- I've just heard horror stories about, you know, fast food --
L:  Yeah it --
R:  -- restaurants.  How everything's --
L:  -- it's crazy.
R:  -- like, instant and ugh -- just ...
L:  It's amazing how many McDonalds there are up and everything like that.  McDonalds actually, it's really interesting, I don't know if you knew this -- they're actually the largest, um -- not the largest -- one of the largest landowners in the world.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  As far as real estate goes, yeah.
R:  Wow.  That -- that --
L:  Because what -- what they do is they buy the property --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then they rent it out to um, you know, the -- whoever runs the franchise of McDonalds.
R:  Mhm.  I -- I heard somewhere that McDonalds owns like, one percent of all the beef in the United States.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And like, I mean, one percent isn't really that much, but when you think about it, I mean, gee that's a lot for one company.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  Yes, it's just -- yeah.
L:  It's -- it's a lot of cow.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  But like, all -- all of my ah, relatives like, under the age of thirty, are thirties -- -- cousins and ah, an older brother are -- are vegetarians, and they're always trying to convince me to go vegetarian.  And I guess there's a lot of you know, good reasons for it, but I'm just, you know, ah, a natural meat eater so --
L:  Yeah um --
R:  -- I can't -- I can't really switch.
L:  A lot of people -- I know a couple of people that -- that were vegetarians or are or -- or are, you know, are kind of vegetarians.
R:  Right.
L:  And I know like, some people that are um, you know, the vegan style vegetarian, where you don't eat, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You need to -- 
R:  That'd be so hard to --
L:  -- control.
R:  -- be vegan.
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I think -- I actually, I mean, every- -- ah my- -- the research that I've done, shows that you're actually healthier if you eat, you know, some meat.
R:  Right.
L:  Because you -- you need like, you need some vitamins like iron, I think is one of the things that --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that you get a lot from -- from eating meat.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you know, I mean like, you can probably get it some -- some other way, but --
R:  Yeah.  You see, a -- a friend of mine is like um, he's a vegetarian, but the rea- -- the reason being not really for animal rights reasons -- well, it is now, but he, ah, like, he never tried meat like, he just refused to eat meat from like, an early age for some reason or another.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's just so weird, I just can't picture ever like, not trying meat.  I mean, I'm sure he's tried it like, accidentally sometime, but like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he -- he's -- like, his body's so like, set on not eating meat that now if he probably even had just a little bit it would probably make him sick.
L:  Yeah, um, but your body would just reject it.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  But, I don't know.  That's so weird and like, he's -- he's sick a lot, so maybe like, not eating meat does something to your immune system, or something.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it probably does, yep.  'Cause he --
R:  Protein deficiencies.
L:  -- get it, yeah.
R:  And he's really weak, so ...
L:  Yeah, you don't get a lot of that stuff when you ...
R:  What's that?
L:  You know, you don't get a lot of things that you -- I mean we're meant to eat meat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, maybe -- maybe not as much as we eat now --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Especially Americans.  We eat so much meat.
L:  I- it's really crazy.
R:  Yeah, I mean compared to other cultures, I mean, they eat, you know, just -- just basic foods, you know, beans, rice --
L:  Right.
R:  -- things like that.  That -- I mean that's just their staple, like meat is just like, a staple in out diet.
L:  It's like the -- the American diet is so crazy like, I was um -- I was in my room the other day, and I had like, this cup in my room.  Ah, I just had like, water -- I drink a lot of water, so I had some water in it --
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  And, ah -- so -- but I was looking at the cup, and it was like, a cup that, um, I'd gotten at like, a -- I think it was like a Mc- -- you know, a McDonalds or maybe it was a baseball game or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But the cup was so big --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that it was ridic- -- and it was a soda cup.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So like, the -- the -- you know, you would never go to another country and find like, you know, a um -- it had to be like, a t- -- you know, twenty four ounce --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- cup.  Like, that's ridiculous!
R:  Yeah.
L:  You don't need to drink that much soda.
R:  Yeah.  The super sized nation.
L:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] We're getting --
R:  I -- I -- yeah, at seven -- at seven eleven and stuff.
L:  -- super sized hips and everything.
R:  Excuse me?
L:  We're getting super sized hips and --
R:  Oh, I know.  It's just -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  I mean, just -- the -- the obesity rate too, is just, you know. [several inaudible words] I've heard that like I -- I -- don't quote me on this, but it's like, one in four people are like severely over- -- sev- -- severely overweight.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or something like that.  That's just -- oh, jeeze.
L:  Yeah, that -- I mean, there's really -- it's only -- and the -- and there -- there's only like, one percent -- oh, not one percent, excuse me, one fourth -- I heard the same thing, I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  One fourth of people who actually are at a healthy weight.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then, some people are, you know, like a- -- another fourth is really, you know, unhealthy and obese and then the other people are just, you know, not at the right weight, like they could, you know, lose weight, or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm, yeah, like, I -- I'd probably actually be considered overweight --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, only, not because I'm out of shape.  I'm actually -- I work out every day for -- for like, and hour or more --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and ah --
R:  'Cause ah --
L:  -- I just weight more than I should, like I --
R:  Yeah, muscle weighs more than fat, though.
L:  Yeah, so I -- but for my height and everything, I'm probably like, about twenty or twenty five pounds over weight.
R:  Right.
L:  Which -- I don't know if that's, you know, terribly unhealthy or not but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible] the most part just aren't at the right, you know --
R:  Yeah.  I don't know about where you live, but Cleveland's, you know, a big fat city.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- there's just fat people everywhere.  A f- -- a friend of mine's ah, ah, grandma, who lives in the Netherlands, comes over and visit and that's something she always comments on, "Wow, there's a lot of fat people here".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, 'cause -- 'cause if you go to Europe and stuff, I mean there's just not nearly as many fat people as there --
L:  Right.
R:  -- are in the States, you know.  But --
L:  Yeah, I -- it just -- the way we look at um, eating is just a lot different than --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the rest of the world.
R:  I -- I mean -- I mean ... yeah, I mean I -- I think in Europe and stuff they view eating as kind of like, a -- a -- a -- an art, but, I mean, they don't overdo it.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we have like -- like -- you just think about it like, you go to -- you -- I mean, some are so different.  You go to McDonalds now, and you order like, a number two.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'll have the number two. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And just -- it's really funny, when you think about it, I guess --
R:  Right -- right -- right.  And it's just --
L:  Um.
R:  Yeah, it --
L:  Then --
R:  Excuse me?
L:  Go on.  I'm sorry.
R:  Oh, it's -- I didn't have anything to say.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  Um, yeah, like I -- I -- I mean, I like to go out and eat like -- and wh- -- the restaurants I go to, like I said would be, um, Chinese on buffet, I like to go to um, I don't know if you have 'em around in Cleveland, Applebee's?
R:  Applebee's?  Ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  We have those.
L:  Applebee's and um, I guess you ah, [MN] a Mexican restaurant, um --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- what's it called?  Um ... not Chi Chi's, I go to Chi Chi's sometimes.  You have those down there?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're pretty big, Chi Chi's, then.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  And Don Pablo's.  Do you have Don Pablo's?
R:  Um, I've heard of 'em, I think we might, but I've never been to one.
L:  They're really good.
R:  That's cool.  Ah --
L:  I go in there because they have, um -- when you sit down they just feed you um, free um, free chips all the time, with salsa.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  It's like --
R:  Oh, actually I have been there once
