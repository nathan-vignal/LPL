R:  Uh, I'm Gwen.  [LAUGH]  I don't really know what to say.
L:  [LAUGH] And I'm Audrey.  Uh, I don't either, this is my [LAUGH] first time but it said something about talk about your friends [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.  Uh, yeah -- they -- they just called me and I was like, "Okay".  Um, talk about my friends.  Well, I have close friends and, like, acquaintances, I guess.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um [LIPSMACK] I don't know I have, like, I guess a lot more close friends than I do just, like, acquaintances so, like, just not knowing people. [LAUGH] I like to know 'em and talk to 'em and, like, hang out with 'em and have, like, different variety of friends.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] yeah.  What, Mom?  Okay, sorry.
L:  That's okay.
R:  Um --
L:  I have -- I -- I'm more of -- I'm not very good at meeting people [LAUGH] as you can tell by this conversation.
R:  Oh.
L:  So I have a very -- a few close friends.  Um, I have a lot of acquaintances, people that I work with but I consider a friend someone who I can depend on, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- regardless of what the situation is.  If I call them -- I have a problem, then I'd call one of my friends because I know that they're going to be there to -- to help me with the situation, um --
R:  Mhm, right.
L:  And like I said, I -- I'm not real good at -- at meeting new people or -- I'm a friendly person, I'm just not good at meeting people in the beginning.
R:  [MN] Yeah.  Uh, I'm ex- -- I'm outgoing and all that.  People kinda think I'm a little crazy but I just -- I'm just who I am and I don't really care [LAUGH] what other people think.  Um, I'm sixteen, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, I don't know if that has something to do with it [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'd say, you know, as you get older, 'cause I'm older, [LAUGH] that --
R:  [LAUGH] Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  -- that things change but I think I was like this when I was sixteen.  I had a lot of, you know -- I had my close knit friends.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I knew a lot of people when I was in high school but there was a certain group of us that hung together and, um, I would consider them my friends, even to this day.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  These people are still considered my friends.
R:  Wow.
L:  And you make these, you know, lasting relationships, even though you've gone your separate ways and you may not see each other for quite a while but it -- it's good that when you do get back together you can just pick up where you left off --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and continue on with your friendship.
R:  Wow, that would be really ni- -- I hope I still have my friends that I have now when I get older, that'd be nice.
L:  Yeah and so that's why, pick your friends now wisely [LAUGH] 'cause they may be ones that you have to depend on, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- at a later date.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I guess I haven't m- -- some of my friends, I guess, they can depend more upon me than I can on them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, hello, that's -- I guess that's just how it goes.  Sometimes, they're just -- whatever.  I'd be there for 'em if they needed something and I guess they'd try to be there for me.  Some of 'em can't drive so that's kind of hard.
L:  Yes.  Do you -- do you drive?
R:  Yes, I drive.
L:  Do -- and do you have a car that you can drive? [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, [LAUGH] I do.
L:  [LAUGH] So I guess that makes it easier on your friends though [LAUGH] that you make because you do have a car.
R:  Exactly.  It's more beneficial for them --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, you know, "Come pick me up" and I'm like, "Great, fun".  Um, yeah, talk about my friends, okay.  Well, I used to go to a private school so I have more girlfriends --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than I do guy friends but now I go to a public school so I've kind of started getting more guy friends and --
L:  So, how was that transition for you from going from -- and I take it you went to an all girl private school?
R:  Yes.
L:  To now a mixed --
R:  It was really hard. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I didn't think it was going to be that hard but it was pretty hard because I -- it was a total change.  I was in culture shock, extreme.  It was just really bad.  Um, I'm going back to my [LAUGH] private school because I just -- 'cause public school's too different for me, I guess, and I just -- I miss my friends at my -- my other school and, yeah -- I don't --
L:  So, you're sixteen.  Are you a sophomore?
R:  Yes.
L:  And did you go to private school all this time?
R:  I we- -- pretty much for nine years I went to a private school so that's where [LAUGH] I've grown up and that's where everyone I know is --
L:  That --
R:  -- there.
L:  It would make a difference, then, if that's what you were used to and now going out and entering out into the public school realm.  I asked that question -- my daughter is in private school right now --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And, um -- but not an all girls school, it -- it is mixed but even she -- the thought of her going to a public school is like, "Ooh, I don't want to go to public school". [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  And I, you know --
R:  I did -- yeah --
L:  I --
R:  It takes --
L:  Go ahead --
R:  -- a certain type of person.
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  No, oh, okay.
L:  [MN]
R:  I'm sorry.
L:  That's okay.
R:  It takes a certain type of person to, like, be able to go to a private school and then to change over to a public school it's just hard.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Too hard.
L:  Well, I guess, my husband and I, we think it's kinda funny 'cause both of us grew up in public schools, that was all we knew.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, so, um, to us public school is like okay, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's all right but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to her it's a horror [LAUGH] you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's a nightmare waiting to happen to her.
R:  [LAUGH] Yes.
L:  So, um, so now I guess I'll be a little more understanding since I've talked to somebody else. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly [LAUGH].
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Um, shoot, okay, more about my friends, friends, friends ...  There's not a lot to say about my friends for ten minutes, about my friends.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um --
L:  Well, the -- the most important thing I can say is, you know, do pick them wisely now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, you know, one because it'll keep you out of trouble, too, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  But then --
R:  That's my problem.
L:  -- you are talking about, you know, possibly some lasting friendships --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um -- so you want to choose your friends wisely, the ones that you're going to know when you're forty or forty five.
R:  Right.
L:  You know [LAUGH] and you -- you're looking for a group to go out and go cruising with or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on a cruise ship, so you -- you want to just pick your friends wisely.
R:  Wow, I don't know if I could stand some of my friends for a whole cruise.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'd probably end up killing some of them.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's because they're sixteen now, too, right [LAUGH] so --
R:  Exactly [LAUGH].
L:  -- wait until they get a little bit older [LAUGH] okay, and maybe they'll change.
R:  [LAUGH] Hopefully.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they would need to change [LAUGH] a lot.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I think we all do.  We all do some growing up, we all do some maturing and, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and -- and actually, when you get out in the workforce it's going to be similar to the way it is in school.  The only difference is in the workforce you're doing it for your livelihood.  In school you're just doing it for convenience, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to have a social life but, um, it's basically the same thing.  Just like in school you find, you know, good people to hang out with and then there's some bad people that hang out -- to hang out with and there's those that like you and do- -- and those that don't.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And when you enter the workforce it'll be the same way.  There's some good people in the office to hang out with and there's some not [LAUGH] so good people and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so, um -- I -- I think it all equals out in the end.
R:  Mhm, uh-huh.  Yeah, wow, I'd never really thought [LAUGH] about it like that.  I mean, I guess I did but I didn't really -- I didn't think about working, I guess.  I don't really think about that a lot, the work.
L:  And then, too, when you're sixteen there's a lot of things as far as life goes that, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we just take for granted that it's going to happen and, you know, eventually one day I'll graduate from high school with these friends and some of those friends may go off to college with you and they may even influence [LAUGH] the college that you choose to go to.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, 'cause you want to take some of your friends with you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And some of them you're going to go, "Oh, no, I -- I want to get as far away from them [LAUGH] as possible" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] And then you'll go down and you'll meet some new friends and then some of your old friends -- and I have an older daughter, too, so -- [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yes.
L:   -- this ki- -- this kind of boils into it -- you find out that, you know, even if you do go off to college with some of your friends, that once you get down there, they may change because now they're in a different environment, they're away --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- from their parents, you know, and a lot of things that they couldn't do when they were at home and they had some restrictions and some constraints, they no longer have now.
R:  Right.
L:  And people change so you just have to be careful.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  My friends -- oh goodness, that'd be bad.  My friends [LAUGH] without any restraints on them, I don't --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Scared what they might do.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, hopefully they've -- they've had some good upbringing and they'll all be good. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] Um, I don't really have a varying in age with my friends, I don't think.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're mostly, like, my age and, like, maybe seniors would be, like, the oldest friends I have.  Um, do you have any older friends?
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  But see what happens is after -- [LAUGH] after you become an adult [LAUGH] and actually --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- get out here and get older, age changes.  Age isn't looked at the same way it is when you're younger.  Um, you know, it's like right now you -- you're a junior, right?
R:  A sophomore, sophomore.
L:  I'm sorry, a sophomore, okay.  So you wouldn't imagine hanging out with someone who was maybe in the seventh or eighth grade.
R:  Right, [LAUGH] no way.
L:  You know spending [LAUGH] -- spending the weekend at the mall or whatever and, when you think about it, age wise they may be only three years younger th- --
