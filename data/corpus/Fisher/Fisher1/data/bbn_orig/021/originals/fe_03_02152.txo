R:  Hi, my name is Cathy.
L:  Hey, Cathy, how're you doing?  My name's Monty.
R:  Hi.  Um, I like to eat both places.
L:  [LAUGH] At home and at a restaurant?
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Well, I -- I agree with you there, I mean, 'cause I enjoy cooking, but, uh, restaurants are good because you don't have no mess to clean up [LAUGH].
R:  Right, yeah.  Yeah, I like to cook too.  I like to experiment, but you know, once in a while it's really nice and relaxing to go out into a restaurant and eat.
L:  Yeah, this is true.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Now, what kind of places do you like to go to?
R:  Um, well, we have a lot of -- I live i- in an area where we have a lot of little Italian restaurants, uh, practically --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- every other street corner, and they're pretty good, so I like to do that, um, what about you?
L:  Mm, well, I like just about everything really, I mean, just depends on my mood.  I mean, there's not too many foods I don't like [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I know, like, I like Chinese too, and, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Mexican.
L:  There you go.
R:  Yeah, so, uh, it's not too hard to find a restaurant that I like [LAUGH].
L:  Uh, and where are you going to these restaurants at?  What city are you in?
R:  Yeah, I'm in Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  Where are you?
L:  Uh, I'm in Murf[?]- -- I'm in Murfreesboro[?], Tennessee.
R:  Oh, well.
L:  But, uh, I agree with you though on the Mexican and Chinese.  That's probably the two I do the most, um ...
R:  Yeah, and, uh, like, what's your favorite type of meal -- that you can co- -- that you cook?
L:  That I cook?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm, [LIPSMACK] I don't know about that now, that I cook?  I don't know, shoo, [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  That's a tough one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't cook too much any more --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm more into the eating out, but, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, I don't know, I'd probably have to go with, uh, like a barbeque thing, like fried chicken or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- maybe barbeque ribs, and some kind of baked beans --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- coleslaw, rolls, you know.
R:  Oh, that sounds good.
L:  There you go, but ...
R:  Um, I cook a variety of things --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- I -- I can get into Chinese some times.  I -- we're Italian, so I do cook mostly Italian, but I -- I've done some Chinese things.  I do some Mexican things, so, uh, you know, I have got like six grand kids, so we don't get too fancy with them.
L:  There you go.  How many kids did you say?
R:  I have three children and six grandchildren.
L:  Phew --
R:  And, uh --
L:  Mercy [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, and --
L:  Can't go out too often with that many, can you?
R:  No, uh-uh.  Uh, the grand kids like the Italian, and they -- and they like buffets, so when we got out to eat,  the- they like a buffet.  So, we have a couple of them around here that they like to go to.
L:  There you go.  I -- I --
R:  They do Chinese or just a -- like a an American buffet they like.
L:  Yeah, buffets are good, it's -- I don't eat them too much 'cause, well, I don't eat as much as I used to, so ...
R:  Right.
L:  But, I agree with that, you know, Chin- -- especially Chinese buffet --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Now, those are good.
R:  Yeah, we have a few of them around here that are pretty good, and they're really reasonable, so it's good to take the kids there for the sake of them, you know, they can always find something because they have other things that aren't, um, Chinese, but they do like a lot of the Chinese stuff, but at least they can find -- like, 'cause they'll have chicken, and they'll have wings and things like that, so they can always find something to eat there.
L:  Mhm.  So, are they -- er, up there do they have like, uh, uh, see let me try to think of some the items, uh, General Tao's chicken, or ...?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's one of my favorite there.
R:  Yeah --
L:  You know --
R:  Uh-uh, yeah.
L:  That one, and, uh --
R:  Uh --
L:  Crab ragoon, they have those?
R:  Uh-huh, yeah, uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, I love them too, now those are good.
R:  Yeah.  And I like their vegetables, their -- their string beans, th- they make them, um ...
L:  Uh, Chinese I don't usually think of vegetables [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, yeah, well they have --
L:  -- other than like broccoli --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- and beef and broccoli --
R:  Yeah, right, yeah --
L:  -- and I like that.
R:  Well, they have like string beans here, an- and they have cabbage, and they do it like with a little bit of soy sauce and some garlic and i- it's really tasty.
L:  The cabbage is like that?
R:  Not together.  Yeah, but like separately, you know, but --
L:  Ha.
R:  -- yeah, yeah, it's ta- --
L:  That'd be pretty good, I bet?
R:  Yeah, it's tasty.
L:  'Cause I like cabbage now.
R:  Yeah, it's really tasty.
L:  Huh.
R:  And then they have the snow peas, you know, which are pretty much Chinese around here --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- anyway.
L:  What about the egg roll?  Do they have meat in them or ...?
R:  Yeah, they've got the -- uh, well, they have the shrimp and they have the pork.
L:  Yeah, a lot of places down here, they don't have any meat in them at all.  It's just --
R:  Oh, really --
L:  -- all vegetable --
R:  -- just a vegetable?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  It can be all right depending on which place you're at --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Yeah.  But, um, they have a couple of different kinds of soups on the weekends, uh, especially at night.  They have like crab legs, and, um, shrimp, which you know, which are good.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  The kids like that.  But, uh ...
L:  Eh, so what was your favorite meal, or what was the favorite one you like to cook, or ...?
R:  Uh, I usually make, um, [SIGH] is they are called stuffed rigatoni, which I buy, but then we make our own sauce and make meatballs, and something called braciole.  Did you ever hear that?
L:  What is it?
R:  Braciole.  It's a very thin steak, and you stuff it with like a bread stuffing and garlic and seasoning, and then you roll it out and you put it in your -- your sauce.
L:  Hm --
R:  Braciole --
L:  -- now that sounds really good.  Now --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't think I ever had that.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- we make that a lot --
L:  Is that --
R:  And sausage -- Italian sausage in the gravy and ...
L:  There you go.  I like all that now.  I said there's not too many things I don't like [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  So ...
R:  Do you, uh -- do you t- -- um, you go out a lot --
L:  What's th- --
R:  -- now you say?
L:  Do -- what's that now?
R:  You g- -- you go out more than you cook at home now?
L:  Pretty much these days really, yeah [SIGH].  If I do stay home, it's mostly like sandwiches.  I don't cook too much these days.
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  Well, you know, I don't h- -- I'm by myself, don't have family so, you know --
R:  Yeah, me too.  So -- so you don't like to cook for one person.
L:  Nah, it's hard to anyway [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, but when they come over, it's you know, we kind of have a big meal [SIGH], like, uh, on the holidays, um, the Italians have this [inaudible] seven fish on Christmas Eve --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and you have to make seven different kind of fishes, and, uh, we have like -- did you ever hear of stromboli?
L:  Yeah, and now, I -- I was going to tell you, my parents were from Pennsylvania --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I miss -- I miss, like stromboli --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, pizza up there --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, northern pizza's just different than --
R:  Oh yeah, uh-huh.
L:  -- than down here, and --
R:  Yeah, we have --
L:  -- you know, it's --
R:  -- things like that on Christmas Eve.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, yeah --
L:  Hm.
R:  It's a big thing.
L:  That's pretty wild.  I'm trying to think of the other one.  What was that other one now?  Calzone or ...?
R:  Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.
L:  It's been so long.  I haven't been up there forever, so --
R:  Well -- yeah, we have a lot --
L:  But, yeah,  I miss all that northern -- and most of it  is Italian, you know -- Italian cooking.
R:  Yeah, and your Philly steak sandwiches.
L:  Yeah, there you go.
R:  Cheese steak.
L:  A real one though, a real one
R:  Yeah, cheese steak.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But, uh ...
L:  See I- I'm getting hungry talking about --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- all this [LAUGH].
R:  I know, I know.  I just got home from work, and -- and I had a -- I'm trying to lose some weight, so I had like a fruit salad --a tossed  salad, and you know, it's [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Yeah, I just --
R:  -- not so great. [LAUGH]
L:  I just came in before -- I was doing -- I was doing laundry.  I work at night, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, I just ate a bagel [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I know --
L:  Something quick and easy.
R:  Yeah, I know.  It's hard when you're alone t- to cook.
L:  Yep.  
R:  But, um, yeah, so, um, I don't know how much we --
L:  So, you live right in the city or ...?
R:  Yeah, I live right in the city, yeah.
L:  Well, there's probably a lot of choices of restaurants there --
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  -- then, you know --
R:  We have a lot of restaurants that you can go around here, and, uh -- but, uh, we have a really nice one in town where if you go with four people or more, it's, um, family style, and they give you so much stuff, like you could pick two entre- -- two appetizers, two entrees, two salads and two desserts.  But they give you so much that y- you have to take it home.
L:  Uh-huh.  Now, that sounds good to me [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  A lot of choices they give you too.
L:  Well, that's back to why I said I don't hardly do buffet, 'cause a lot of times now I'm -- I'm full on one plate --
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  -- so, you know, why do a buffet, you know --
R:  Right, because you can't eat --
L:  You might as well order exactly what you want, and ...
R:  Right, uh-huh, yeah.  Buf- buffets are good 'cause the kids can always find something when we take them.
L:  There you go.
R:  The kids could be fussy sometimes [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I understand that.
R:  Yeah, and, uh, jeeze, I don't know how much we could talk about food, really.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  We can go back to the pizza now, all right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I said I missed them northern pizzas, um --
R:  Yeah, mind you we just --
L:  Well, I don't think you told me the meal you cook, did you?
R:  Yeah, I said the stuffed rigatoni and --
L:  Oh yeah, okay.
R:  Yeah, and then we boil some sausage and braciole, um, what else?  Ah, yeah --
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  Yeah, yesterday I made a roast pork that was really good.
L:  Uh-huh, I haven't had that in a while either [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, my kids got me one of those rotisseries, which really makes a good roast.
L:  [LAUGH] I might have to cook when this is over [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, right [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] That's terrible.
R:  Oh, jeeze.  Oh, I don't know.
L:  Any way, it's back to the pizza and that.  I'm sure you all go out for pizza or make your own, or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think you said that too, didn't you?
R:  Yeah, but I make my own stromboli and, um, we order piz- -- we usually order pizza.  In fact we had it Saturday night, um, I had a pizza here.
L:  Is it like a local place or is it a chain?
R:  Oh, God, we've got s- -- no, locals- -- they have a lot of like local r- pizza places around here, um, there's about three or four of them that are really good.  Uh, you can --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- get all kind of toppings like, uh, chicken and broccoli, and just plain tomato and, um, it --
L:  Anything but anchovies for me.
R:  Oh, really?  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I like the hot pepper.  We have one called pizzazz and it's, um -- it's different kind of cheeses and sliced tomato and hot peppers, and it's really good.
L:  That sounds good to me.
R:  If you like hot -- if you like hot stuff.  I like spicy stuff.
L:  Well, I do too, but my body doesn't like it any more.
R:  Yeah, right [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] I still eat it on occasion though.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I like, uh -- I always put like crushed red pepper on my pizza.
L:  Yeah, I -- I love that now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What, in them shakers?  Just shake it on there as much as you want?  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's good.
R:  Yeah, and, uh, what else?
L:  Sounds real good to me.
R:  Yeah, and then I -- and I love my desserts too, which --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- I haven't been indulging in, you know, for about three months now, so I've been pretty good.
L:  And what kind of desserts do you like when you have them?
R:  Anything with chocolate.
