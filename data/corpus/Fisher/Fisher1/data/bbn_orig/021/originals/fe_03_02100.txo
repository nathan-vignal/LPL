L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm Denise White.
R:  Uh, I'm Nanish[?] Wood.
L:  Okay.  All right, the topic is friends, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, do you have a lots of friends?
L:  Ah, I guess you could say so.  Yeah, friends, a lot of friends.  And yourself?
R:  Um, I -- since I'm a foreigner it takes a -- you know, a little -- a while for me to develop friendships, so to speak.
L:  Oh.
R:  So it's kind of harder and, um, I've been in this country for over five years --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but I think it's easier to make friends when you are younger and -- maybe because you're more naive and you kind of forget little things.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Than when you're getting older and it's getting harder and harder.
L:  It gets harder and harder.  Right, right.
R:  So --
L:  Well, in your other country, um, you -- you had friends there, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, and do you still keep in contact with those friends?
R:  I'm trying to but, uh, the country's too far away so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, everybody gets busy.
L:  Okay.
R:  But I think it's -- for me, it's, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- easy to kind of, you know, make an acquaintance but then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's -- it's hard to be a close friend --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- as I understand, you know, to be a friend is just, you know, everything pretty much.
L:  Everything, sometimes --
R:  And you can -- yeah, you can trust with everything and you can go with, um, any trouble you have [NOISE] so that's much harder.
L:  Ooh.  Well, you say friends.  Friends, acquaintances, good, best friend [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  A -- a best friend is, like you say, is kind of hard.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, you feel, uh, uh, uh, uh -- how would you say, violated, I guess, a lot, when -- when you say best friends.
R:  Uh --
L:  You -- you know, friends sometimes violate your con- +confidentiality.
R:  Yes.
L:  You understand what I'm saying?
R:  Yes.
L:  So, is that why it may be hard for you to --
R:  Maybe.
L:  -- connect and make friends here --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- here, in this country?
R:  I think, uh, you know, prior I had some -- I've -- I've been burned a few times so --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- now it's very difficult to --
L:  [MN]
R:  To just say, "Okay, I'm going to trust this person again" --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- because you're thinking, "Okay".
L:  Yeah.
R:  "That happened before" so --
L:  Yeah, I mean, but on a general, uh, friend. [LAUGH] They're, I guess -- they're good to have, you know, because you -- you'll always need somebody to talk to, I guess, you know, you --
R:  Oh yeah, absolutely.
L:  You know, so -- I don't know if you would categorize that as a friend or -- or, um -- well, what would you say? [NOISE] Yes?
R:  So I would agree with you.
L:  Okay, you're absolutely right.  Oh, my.
R:  Are you, um -- do you have a lot of friends that you, kind of, uh, kept from your childhood or, um, not?  Like from high school or something like that?
L:  You know, at this point in my life I am -- I'm -- I -- I'm looking for, I say, a change of career.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, my -- my idea with the change of career, I'll -- I'll surround myself around a whole new setting of people to obtain better friendships that I've had -- haven't had.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  Okay, well, that -- that will be nice.  I hope you will be able to achieve your, um, result --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so to speak.
L:  Right, right, right, right.  Yeah, because, uh, high school friends, everybody, you know, goes their own ways and, you know, you -- you -- you -- you grow apart --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so I don't know you try to find somebody that's on the higher level and, you know, aim towards the ty- -- same type goals and stuff that you set, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So that you won't get burnt.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, exactly, so --
R:  Well, you've got to be careful but then on the other hand friendship takes a little bit of, um, sacrifice from yourself so to speak because you gotta -- you gotta open up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because if you don't you'll -- you'll never become a friend of that person.  You'll just, you know, meet each other and say hi and that's it.
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  So, I don't know.  I guess, um, I -- I -- I do have, um, a few close friends in this country so that helps because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if I, um -- you know, if I do need to talk to somebody I can always give them a call and I know they will listen to me.
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  So, do you have this kind of friends?
L:  Um --
R:  That you can trust?
L:  Actually, no, I don't -- I don't -- I don't find that. [LAUGH] No, no, no, 'cause, like you say, I guess I'm still stuck on the burntness part of -- of -- of situation.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know.
R:  Okay.
L:  You -- you -- you -- you -- you -- you -- you shut off a lot of that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I have plenty of friends but then [NOISE] you just -- you don't take it personal.
R:  Okay.
L:  There's more on a hi, bye level, you know, you don't want to involve your -- your feelings and all that old gooky stuff, you know what I mean?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because -- no.
R:  What about, uh, relatives?  Do you, um, keep a close contact with relatives?
L:  Well, I have children, I have children.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I constantly tell them, "I'm not your friend, I'm your mother but on the next note I am your friend".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So that's mainly more where my attention is focused --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- towards the children and watching them, uh, with their friends and -- you know.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, so that's --
R:  They probably get burned quite a bit and then they'll run to you and say, "Oh, my goodness, what did you do to me?".
L:  They're just -- they're just actually starting to reach that point, yes.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, what the twins are eight, or whatever, so, uh, they're just -- just starting to reach that point, so I'm -- I'm more sort of focused on, "Who's your friend and what are you doing with your friends?" you know, type thing, so -- yeah, I guess that's another reason why I don't focus too much on my friends per se, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, because I'm so much involved into the things that their -- their friends -- 
R:  Oh well, that's good.
L:  Friendships and stuff, you know.
R:  At least I would hope that you would know who their friends are --
L:  Exactly, yeah.
R:  -- because it's very important to stay out of trouble if, um -- [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, exactly.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Their friends mothers call me to ask me have I seen their children.
R:  Oh [NOISE]. Oh, that's good.
L:  Oh gosh, you know, so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yep, yep, yep.  So, um, this is your first time with the conversation for friends and everything?
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Okay, okay.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, but, um, I guess it's, um -- it's not your first time, is it?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Actually it is, actually it is, yeah.  This is the first time so it's a new topic but today is friends and we're supposed [LAUGH] to stay focused on friends, right? [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, well, maybe you can meet a friend like that too, while talking, you never know, yeah.
L:  Right, right, right, right, right, yeah, so --
R:  Well, have you moved a -- um, a lot around the country because if you move a lot it's also, um, very easy to lose friends?
L:  Actually, no, no, I've lived in the same city here all my life.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  So I guess that isn't easier for you.
L:  So,  my -- I would love to be able to move [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  To find, you know, maybe some new friends [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, you know, that's -- that's -- that's definitely a go but as for, you know, I need stability so --
R:  Okay.
L:  The children and their friends and -- yeah, baby, you know, so -- I have a houseful of friends is waiting on me now and [LAUGH] I hope my -- they don't  -- my children's friends don't eat all my dinner.  I gotta check, well how much longer do we have?
R:  Oh, I think we have maybe, uh, um, another minute and a half.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.
R:  Well, maybe you can still check on your dinner.  That's fine.
L:  Well, actually, I'm on this, um, phone where I have to stay stationary.
R:  Oh.
L:  I can't travel with it.
R:  Okay.
L:  I don't have a cordless or anything so --
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, um -- what did I want to say?
L:  Mhm.
R:  The, um -- I just hope that then your friends since you keep a cl- -- not friends, your children since you keep a very close eye on them, will not, um, get burned and maybe it will be better for them if you do stay in the same town --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because if they start develop their shi- -- friendship and do find very good friends --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if they move then they lose it.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  That's a bad part about it.
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  Um.
L:  They're, um, getting ready to start a new school so I'm getting ready to open up the door for a whole bunch of new friends. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's nice as well.
L:  And they're constantly bringing home a new friend.  I have my -- my youngest daughter, oh, friends, friends, friends, friends.  She's very friendly.  She'll talk to anybody, anytime, anything, overly friendly.  I have to watch her, type thing.
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  Yeah, mhm, so --
R:  Well, um, that sounds lots of -- like lots of fun --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- since they're going into a new school and you're looking for a new career so --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- hopefully, you know, with so many new changes in your life you will, um, get close to somebody.
L:  Right, right, right.  Actually, that's not [LAUGH] my focus at this time.  I've had enough of closeness friends. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] Enough of that there, you know.  Oh, my, my, my, so -- I mean, but I do enjoy people, being around people, you know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Seeing happy people, people making new friends and stuff like that, so --
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  Yeah but, um, that's not a major topic in my life at this time [MN].  So --
R:  Okay.
L:  Yep, yep, yep.
R:  Well, I think we're getting to our ten minutes.
L:  Does -- does it beep off or -- or -- or -- how --
R:  I think so.  I think it said that it's going to beep and then we will be able to leave our comments about the conversation.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, how're you going -- friends.
R:  Well, that's -- that's all right.
L:  Mm, well, I know -- I know they say you have to stay th- --
