R:  Hello, I'm Jill.
L:  Hi, I'm [several inaudible words].  How are you?
R:  I'm fine, thank you.
L:  Well, I guess the topic is, uh, restaurant and f- -- eating food at the restaurant or at home.
R:  Yes, ma'am.
L:  What do you prefer?
R:  Um, [LAUGH] since I have a sixteen month old little boy, I prefer at home because it seems like when we go out, he bothers some of [LAUGH] the people that are in the restaurant. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, how old is your son?
R:  He's sixteen months and --
L:  He's so little, little --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I -- I've gone through that.  I know -- when, uh, my son was little, we, yeah, didn't, we didn't expose him to these fast, uh, food restaurants.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, but, uh, if you want my opinion about eating o- out, it's sometimes better, but as you said, [SIGH] uh, we prefer, er, home eating also. [NOISE] My husband likes, uh, vegetables and salads, this kind of thing, so he [NOISE] rather, uh, eat at home --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for the, uh, you know, being healthy and this kind of thing.
R:  And also you can control what you put in it, unlike --
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  -- at -- going to a restaurant and having to order what they have.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] But, you know, sometime like steak, and some of the things that -- like Chinese restaurants, this kind of thing, we go -- go out on occasions too, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so we -- if you go out, what do you like to eat?  I- --
R:  I j- --
L:  -- do you like at all going out?
R:  Uh, just about anything.  It really doesn't matter to me, Chinese, pizza --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, pizza.  Oh --
R:  Yeah, I love pizza.
L:  -- that's my favorite too, yeah.
R:  I also like, do you know, go out and get the food, and bring it home and eat it.
L:  Oh, that's another option --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we do too.  That's -- that's, uh, but, yes, uh, like Chinese food, like at the -- I don't know if we can name a [NOISE] place, but anyway, supermarkets [NOISE], this places, [NOISE] they have Chinese, uh, kitchen th- -- so they call.  We buy from them and, uh, we bring home and th- -- enjoy it at our, uh, you know, home and, uh, sometimes we have movie and watch it and, uh -- but, do you cook at home at all?
R:  Yes, I do.
L:  Well, obvio- obviously you do --
R:  Yes, I do --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- yeah.  I'm -- I'm a stay at home mother, and I keep another child just for extra income, so, um, most time I cook a big supper at night --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so, I can spend more time with them during the day, and not have to, you know, recook something again --
L:  Uh-huh.
R: -- a large meal.
L:  Oh, that's a great idea.  Yeah, sometimes w- -- I have left overs too.  In fact, this evening we -- me and my son are going to have left overs [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- from yesterday -- I cooked a lot.  [SIGH] Yeah, um, I am same way, I'm a stay at home mom too, so, I guess we are on a right boat and, uh [NOISE], yeah, we save as much as we can.
R:  Right.
L:  In fact, that's why I got in this program.
R:  Yes, me too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, and, uh, how long have you been with them?
R:  Um, this is actually my first phone call.
L:  Oh, is it?  This is my [LAUGH] second.
R:  Your second?
L:  Isn't it fun doing that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- well, [NOISE] anyway, um, I think that's a good thing.  We get to talk --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, and, uh, give our opinion, which, uh, I think, uh, it's nice, like, you know, I like a steak.  Sometimes there's steak sauce they have outside is uh, uh, interesting [NOISE], and I like it better, yeah --
R:  Are you from a -- a bigger community?  You have a lot of restaurants?
L:  Uh, yeah, well --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- not very big, but yet fairly[?] in varieties.  You -- [NOISE] are you -- are you coming -- oh, uh, talking from a smaller one?
R:  Yes, um -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- we have like McDonalds and stuff like that --
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  -- but most of the restaurants we have are, you know, Mom and Pop operations --
L:  Yeah, uh. [NOISE]
R:  -- that you go to.
L:  Well, I lived in smaller town -- th- then people are friendlier.
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  People are friendlier.  They probably go on the picnic more often, and, uh, uh, this kind of thing.  Like, you know, when I say steak, like, um, it's hard for me.  I like steak sauce, like, um, uh, uh, mushroom steak sauce, those sauce.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  You know, sometimes it's ha- [NOISE] -- it takes long time to make that kind of thing.
R:  Right.
L:  It's good when you go out to order this kind of thing.  I try to order some of the things, if we go out, uh, that we don't eat at home, or it's hard to cook at home. [NOISE]
R:  And a lot of times it'll taste better when you go out, 'cause you --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- don't have to cook it. [LAUGH]
L:  You bet -- there's lot of -- lot's of, uh -- I call it nutrition, but actually it's, uh, lots of [several inaudible words], you know, cholesterol sometimes [several inaudible words] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, uh, that's nice, so, um, er, you prefer to go, if you go out, to the fast food, or you go to restaurant?
R:  Um, h- -- it really just depends on the mood that my son is in.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  If -- if we can go down and ha- -- go out and have a sit down dinner and sit there for an hour or so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- then I love to do that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but a lot of times it's french fries and hamburgers, just to make him happy.
L:  Ye- -- oh, that for him, yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's true.  That's true.  At that age they're just, um, you know, they don't have that much patience, and --
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  -- uh, for a while we have to stay home and, uh, feed them at home.  However, wait until they get older, then they go to school and learn it from their people, or their students who are [LAUGH] there, and they come and they want something that you probably never heard of it either, or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, you think that's not healthy.
R:  Right.
L:  Well, uh, let's see.  If you cook at home, um [NOISE], uh, what would you cook more, or you guys like to cook?
R:  Well, tonight we're having grilled chicken, um, stained carrots, broccoli --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- or spinach.  I haven't decided yet.
L:  So, you guys are vegetable people also?  We like ve- --
R:  Love vegetables. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yes, yes.  Uh, do you like raw vegetable or, uh, do you eat -- do you cook it or like you say, you grill it, or ...?
R:  Um, I like it stained.  Most the time I like it where it's -- it's still crunchy, not --
L:  Uh-huh.  Not too cooked, yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  The same here.  It seems that my stomach takes it better, but my husband likes it raw.
R:  Right.
L:  So, it's a little bit hard.  Sometimes I'm cooking three dishes.
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  Yeah, three or four dishes to satisfy everybody around the house.
R:  I couldn't imagine having to do that.  It's like I said, I have a sixteen month old, but I'm seven months pregnant.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I get real tired [LAUGH] real fast --
L:  Oh, I know --
R:  -- when it comes to doing stuff like that.
L:  -- so, good luck.  Yeah, you need lots of nutrition.
R:  Yes.
L:  And -- and probably better to eat at home.
R:  Right.
L:  They -- they say we can find really nutritional, um, or places that are not really greasy, but as much as I go out, still I see the best place still, you know, they want to make the food tasty --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, they have lots of grease to make it tasty.
R:  Most the times when you go out to a buffet --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- is where you see more vegetables --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- then -- when you do go to a buffet, it's canned stuff.
L:  Exactly.  Yes, I was just going to say, that -- this -- we have a place that, uh, is just, uh, soup and salad here, and, uh, uh, they just, uh, you know, canned, you know, or if it's fresh, [SIGH] well, you eat a lot, that's, you know, because it's a buffet [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- sometime you eat a lot.  That's why we -- yeah, I like sometimes go to places, if I go out, that I can order there.
R:  We have a Chinese food buffet place here, like you were saying.  They have more along the lines of the fresh vegetables.
L:  They don't have fresh ones?
R:  They do.  They have m- --
L:  They do, yes.
R:  -- more fresh vegetables than ...
L:  Yeah, I know that, uh, oriental stores, that, or, I mean the restaurants, they have, uh, uh, more fresh -- they use fresh, uh, items [NOISE] better -- more than, uh, uh, frozen or canned ones.
R:  Right.
L:  I know that, uh, or Mediterranean stor- -- or, I mean, uh, uh,  I keep saying stores, uh, I mean restaurants.
R:  Our local restaurants, sometimes you can go in there, and they'll be sitting there, you know, shelling out the peas or doing whatever they're going to do for the night 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so you know it's fresh.
L:  [NOISE] That's true, yes. [NOISE] That's true.
R:  So, I -- I really like that, to be able to see --
L:  Yeah, yeah --
R:  -- what they're putting in it.
L:  We like Chinese, uh, food also because of that reason, because they have, uh, uh -- and besides, uh, they use soy sauce and tofu sometimes --
R:  Right.
L:  -- which is really good for you. [NOISE] Especially -- oh, when I was pregnant, I was really showing.  I went to this, uh, uh, place to buy, uh, you know, supply for home to -- fish[?] in fact I was going -- this was a Vietnamese, uh, uh, uh, place, uh, store, and she, er, couldn't speak very well English, but she, um, pointed to her stomach, then I understood that, uh, she's asking me if I'm pregnant --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or saying something about my pregnancy, and she finally pointed to tofu.  She said that this is very good.  Later on, you know, through an interpreter, she was older lady -- she said tofu is very nutritious for, uh, you know, er, kids, uh, uh, I mean pregnant ladies.
R:  [NOISE] I've been told that --
L: [NOISE]
R:  -- but I've never tried it.
L:  You haven't tried it?
R:  No.
L:  You know, what you can do is, um, buy it, because tofu has no ...
