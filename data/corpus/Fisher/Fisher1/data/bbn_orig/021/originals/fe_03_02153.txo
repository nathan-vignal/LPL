L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My name's Lesley.  How are you?
L:  M- -- fine, my name is Marilyn.  How are you?
R:  Great.  A- -- well, actually I prefer to eat out, if I have my choice, just because it's easier for me.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I would say my perfect meal if I were eating out, dinner would be [SIGH] to go to [SIGH] a restaurant, be seated immediately, and I would say, I like more traditional type food.  I would like, um, my bread served warm, um, a fresh salad, and probably chicken and potatoes, followed up by a dessert.  That would probably be one of my most perfect meals.
L:  Well, that sounds good.  Wh- what kind of dessert do you like?
R:  Usually something chocolate.
L:  Oh, yeah, that sounds good.
R:  Chocolate --
L:  I actually --
R:  -- maybe some ice cream [LAUGH].
L:  Uh, oh, can't beat that.  I, uh -- I think actually would prefer to eat at home.  Um, I do like to go out, but, uh, home is more comfortable, and, um ...
R:  I can understand that.
L:  Th- the only thing is, somebody else should do the cooking [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So I could just sit back and relax, an- and with the company, and I think it would be a -- a nice big turkey dinner --
R:  Oh, yum.
L:  -- with all the fixes, yeah.  Just like you'd have on Thanksgiving or something with turkey and gravy and mashed potatoes and the green bean casserole dish [LAUGH].
R:  Yum.
L:  Yum.  An- -- oh, and there's got to be a nice sage stuffing with raisins, so, um --
R:  Now, that sounds delicious.
L:  Yeah, um, and then if you're eating at home, you get to keep all the leftovers.  That's the best part.
R:  Now, there you go.  Now, see, that's a good point, and those -- and the turkey can last a few days.
L:  Right, and, uh --
R:  And turkey sandwiches are good too.
L:  Oh, aren't they?  Hm, hot turkey sandwiches or cold, or just to eat pieces of it, to pick it off of the carcass [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Sounds good to me.
R:  That sounds excellent.
L:  And I -- I'm not much of dessert person.  If I have my choice I'd rather have more turkey rather than have a dessert.  But if I'm gonna --
R:  But you can have a --
L:  Uh, sorry, go ahead.
R:  I was going to say, do y- -- do you prefer the pecan pie or the fruit pies?
L:  Not pecan pie.  That's too sweet, um --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but I think pumpkin pie would be good, um --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- or ch- -- or if -- if -- I'm thinking of like Baker's Square, they have, uh, French[?] [inaudible] pie.  That's pretty good [LAUGH].  Oh, dear.  It's making me hungry just talking about it [LAUGH].
R:  I know, this was a tough subj- -- that said food, and I haven't eaten lunch yet, so ...
L:  Oh, me neither.
R:  I'm going to go in there and want to eat a turkey sandwich.
L:  Oh.
R:  I like my turkey sandwiches.  I like them -- if I'm eating the real turkey that, you know, has been prepared after Thanksgiving --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I like my turkey thick on my sandwich with mayonnaise.
L:  Oh, yes.  Do you use mayonnaise or miracle whip?
R:  Um, I use mayonnaise.
L:  Oh, yeah.  We always used to buy miracle whip, but --
R:  Yeah, I like --
L:  -- I don't know --
R:  -- the real stuff --
L:  -- it just sounds pretty good [LAUGH].
R:  It does, it sounds very good [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.
R:  With a glass of cold milk.
L:  Which, um -- which restaurants there do you like?
R:  The res- -- my -- my favorite restaurants -- I've got a couple that I really like, and one of them is kind of a -- it's called Bobby Valentines.  It's more of a casual dining.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's real casual.  Everybody there just dresses real casual.  It's real laid back.  It's a real family orientated business.
L:  Mm.
R:  And they've got a -- quite a diff- -- few different things on their menu.  Like my husband usually gets -- he always gets like the nachos or the appetizer platters.
L:  Ah, that sounds good.
R:  Mhm.  I always get my standard.  I like my salad.  I love my salad and I like the meat and a potato [LAUGH].
L:  I know, traditional -- that's true for me too, yeah.  I -- I like traditional.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  What state are you in?
R:  I'm in Texas.
L:  Texas.  And I'm in Minnesota, so ...
R:  See, you probably eat -- I eat a lot of Mexican food.  A lot.
L:  Mm, yeah, I -- I would guess, yeah, being down there.
R:  And it's -- and it's, uh, actually another one of my favorites.
L:  Mm.  I'd rather have Italian [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, yeah, and cheesy.  
L:  Yes.
R:  I l- -- I like Italian too.
L:  Yeah, Italian's good.
R:  Do you have a lot of seafood there?
L:  Um, well, we do, but it's not one of my favorite things.  I guess --
R:  I see.
L:  -- the Red Lobster's the only one that really comes to mind, the Red Lobster chain of restaurants.
R:  Yeah, see we don't have [several inaudible words].
L:  Oh.  Hello.  
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Are you there?
R:  I can hear you.
L:  Oh, okay.  I- --
R:  Can you hear me?
L:  Yeah, now I can, you were kind of fading out.
R:  I faded out?  I'm on a cell phone.  Are you?
L:  Uh, no, I'm on a handheld, yeah.
R:  Okay.  I'm on the cell phone because the minutes don't add up.
L:  I see.  [SIGH] So, let's see what else can we say about dining in or eating out, or whatever?
R:  Dining in.  Dining in is also good.  I agree with you, if somebody else is helping, at least cook and clean.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I've got two teenagers and a husband and they think they eat out every time they eat at home.
L:  Mhm [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They wait for it to come to the table, they eat it, they leave.
L:  Yeah, yeah, real -- real -- real rough, isn't it?  Yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I said --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- I can handle this.
L:  I live alone so if I don't cook it, i- -- I don't eat, so [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] --
L:  But, uh --
R:  You've got to cook it --
L:  -- even so, I'd rather, you know, just be at home, and do it at my leisure and whatever.
R:  Yeah, and not have to get dressed and all that.
L:  Right.  However, takeout's good, because I could go somewhere, pick it up and bring it home.  That would be okay.
R:  And, you know, the number of things that you can get on a takeout basis, or even delivered --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- delivered especially, is very slim, I mean, why do you get stuck with pizza?
L:  Yeah, yeah, I know [SIGH].  I like pizza but I wouldn't want it every day.
R:  Uh-uh.  But if they could deliver something else, that would be real nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mo- most everything else you have to go pick up, or pay a real high delivery fee.
L:  That's true [SIGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh --
R:  [SIGH].
L:  -- excuse me, I'm yawning [MN], oh.  I, um --
R:  So, what time is it there?
L:  It is, uh, two ten.
R:  Two ten, yeah, it's one o'clock here.
L:  Yeah.  Not too much difference.
R:  This is actually my first phone call that I've had.
L:  Mine too.
R:  Oh, okay --
L:  First one .
R:  -- so, we've both just got started.
L:  Yeah, right.  But ten minutes to talk about this is a long time [LAUGH].
R:  It is --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  -- um ...
L:  Let's see.  What else could we say about --
R:  I'm tryin- -- I'm trying to think about it, dining in or eating in?  I guess when eating in, uh, uh, if you prepare meals frequently -- I mean, what would be your favorite that you w- -- that you'd prepare, you know, not like the Th- Thanksgiving dinner, but what would be the other?
L:  Yeah.  Mostly c- -- anything comfort food, I think, mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, all the fatty foods [LAUGH].
R:  All the good foods.
L:  Yeah, right, yeah.
R:  Do you ever use a crock pot?
L:  No, I don't even own one.
R:  See, those are really great, that you can throw everything in there.  If you like the comfort foods like I do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You can throw stuff in there, put it on to set for six hours, and when you come home, or whatever, it's done.  You can do pork chops and stuffing, you can do all kinds of stuff.  You can do barbeque chicken, throw it in there and you come home and it's done.
L:  Yeah, I've often thought that I might like to try one of those, but just ...
R:  They're really nice and they're fairly cheap.
L:  -- just never got around to it, I guess.  I'll have to reconsider that.
R:  Yeah, you'll have to think about that, because it makes it easy.
L:  Anything that makes it easy would be great .
R:  Yeah, clean up, as in one pot [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, pl- plus if I don't go out to eat, I don't have to get dressed up.
R:  See, yeah, and you don't have to tip somebody else [LAUGH].
L:  True.
R:  [LAUGH] You get to keep your money.
L:  We don't have any restaurants called Bobby Valentines.  Isn't that the place you said you liked?
R:  That is a great place.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I like it.  I like it, just --
L:  I like a -- I like just, um, casual places like, oh, like, say Baker's Square.  Do you have Baker's Square down there?
R:  We don't have one.  I've never heard of that.
L:  Mm, okay.  It's kind of like a -- it's -- they have this great pie [LAUGH].
R:  Mm.
L:  But, you know, basically, it's just your sandwiches, regular, you know, just regular --
R:  More like deli like?
L:  Yeah, run -- no, it's not really a deli.  It's a sit down restaurant, but -- but, uh, it just has basics, you know.
R:  That's a --
L:  Nothing fancy.
R:  That sounds good though too.  I like those too.  You can run in there, and -- the casual restaurants sure appeal to me more because that's just my lifestyle.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  I mean, if I've got a special something coming up, every now and then we'll go to a nice place, but, for the price --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's, you know, it's just not worth it to me.
L:  Well, I figure if you don't have to spend fifty dollars on a fancy meal, then you can eat out more often [LAUGH].
R:  That's right [LAUGH], you've got fifty more dollars you can spend on yourself.
L:  [LAUGH] Right, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I'd rather eat out more often than just once for a really expensive meal [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, it's just not --
L:  Although, I live in the twin cities, the Minneapolis St Paul area --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and there are a lot of very fancy restaurants around here.
R:  There are a lot of famous restaurants out in that area.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's ...
