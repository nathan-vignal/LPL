R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Michael Whitecliffe.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi, Steven?
L:  Hey, what's up? [NOISE]
R:  Hi, Michael Whitecliffe.  [NOISE] Um, [MN] so do you like to eat out?  [NOISE] Or do you --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  -- prefer to eat in?
L:  I generally like to eat restaurant food better --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because, um, [SIGH].  I just -- you know, I'm not a very good cook.  So, when I go out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's, ah, much better for me to -- [SIGH] you know, especially if it's like a nice restaurant and stuff. [NOISE]
R:  How do you know it's a nice restaurant?
L:  [NOISE] Ah, you -- well, you see I don't really exp- -- I know the nice restaurants around LA, so I pretty much just -- [SIGH]
R:  Are you in LA?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, I'm in Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Cool.  [SIGH] Did, ah, y- --
R:  It's a great restaurant --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- town.
L:  What's that?
R:  It's a great restaurant town.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah it is.  [NOISE] There's, um, there's [NOISE] a lot of good ones.  [NOISE] And I kinda have my favorites --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] so, [NOISE] you know, [MN] I just -- I just go out.  And usually when I go out I like have sushi or whatever.  I --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  I -- I rare -- it -- it's a money thing, you know, if I --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  -- go out and, um, [SIGH] ah, I'm gonna go out, you know, it -- it's gonna be like a -- a nice restaurant.
R:  Well, do you have an expense account?
L:  [NOISE] No. [LAUGH]  I wish I did. [NOISE]  Do you?
R:  Oh, you sa- -- said it's a money thing.  No, no I don't.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I prefer to eat in. [NOISE]  Ah, ah, one good thing to check out in the restaurant is to go to the men's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- room, [NOISE] assuming you're a man, and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- see the condition and the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cleanliness of it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  There was a -- a tip [NOISE] in New York [NOISE] Magazine, ah, a year or so ago, [NOISE] about, you know, if -- if the restrooms are not really clean, immaculate, imagine what the kitchen's like. [NOISE]
L:  Mm.
R:  Too often I find, ah, when I'm eating a good meal in a good restaurant that it's pretty much home cooking. [NOISE]  Um, [NOISE] and I'm not like a cordon bleu ch- chef but [NOISE] I -- I think the greatest gift --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you can give yourself is a good meal. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, by that I mean, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- prepare it yourself.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  So, I [MN] I -- I -- I'm not personally comparing, but I -- I've had meals in restaurants where I've though, "This is not as good --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- as what I would have done myself".
L:  Well, you must be a pretty good cook then.
R:  Well y- [MN] --
L:  Either that or the restaurants you go to -- [LAUGH] either that or --
R:  Well, no there's --
L:  -- the [LAUGH] restaurants in Philadelphia -- [NOISE] [SIGH]
R:  No, no, there's -- you know--
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like I -- you know, I go to quote unquote good restaurants, and I've had some really good meals and I -- and -- and some restaurants [NOISE] I keep going back to.  Sometimes to have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the -- the same meal --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- again because it's so good.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  But, um, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I, ah -- I prefer actually to -- to -- to eat at home [NOISE] and prepare my own meal.  And it's sort of a money thing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because, ah, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- often times, ah, w- what I'll pay for a meal I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, "Okay they've got to pay the help [NOISE] and they gotta pay [NOISE] the chef and they gotta pay the staff.  [NOISE] [SIGH] But I could knock this meal together for a fraction of what I just paid for it".  But then, it -- it's the pleasure of being with the people you're having the meal with [NOISE] and --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- the occasion -- the occasion that, you know, gets you there in [NOISE] first place. [NOISE] [LIPSMACK]
L:  Right.
R:  And being waited on etcetera.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]  Ah, so, ah, [MN] are you -- you actually in LA proper?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm in LA proper.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Where are you [NOISE] in Philadelphia?
L:  I'm in centre city.  [NOISE] [SIGH] I'm actually in Rittenhouse Square right now.  I'm surprised that [NOISE] this call [NOISE] came in just now [NOISE] because I'm walking along. --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I found a shady spot to stand in, it's [NOISE] really sunny here today. [NOISE]  Ah, and finally [NOISE] beginning to warm up.  But, ah, what's the sort of diversity of restaurants you have to choose from? [NOISE]  And -- and [NOISE] --
L:  Well, we've got everything.
R:  -- [NOISE] what -- what would you --
L:  We've got absolutely everything.
R:  [NOISE] What would you make -- what would you make [NOISE] for yourself [NOISE] if you were gonna eat in? [NOISE]  Would you open a can of beans, or [NOISE] ...?
L:  [NOISE] Um, [NOISE] No, I would, um, I would probably make some s- -- I usually make salmon burgers or ...
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Or, you know, like, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- tofu -- you know, tofu curry or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- something like --
R:  Are you a vegetarian? [NOISE]
L:  Um, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like generally --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when I eat meat --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I eat it [NOISE]--
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I eat meat [NOISE]--
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when I eat out.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  The only thing I eat home really is -- is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- fish. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Okay. [NOISE]
L:  So, um, I'm not like a -- I'm not like a practising [NOISE] vegetarian but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] I do stay away from -- I try to stay away from, ah, red meat [NOISE] as much as possible.
R:  Yeah, well that's fair enough.  I -- I eat a good looking steak about once a month. [MN] Ah, I eat a lot of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fish, I eat a lot of chicken, [NOISE] a lot of grains, a lot of fruits, a lot of vegetables [NOISE].  Um, do you eat -- do you eat pasta?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, but I know it's -- it's not very good for me. [LAUGH]  It -- it -- it's a lot of carbs.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I try to keep that down.
R:  Yeah.  It depends what diet you're on though. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you know, I'm LA. [NOISE]
R:  It like changes every month --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, it's like, ah.  But Marcella Hazan, you know, [NOISE] if you picked up one of her books --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and just browsed through one in -- in a bookstore or ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  She's an outstanding chef.  [NOISE] And, [NOISE] ah, to -- to -- to make a good --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- meal doesn't take a lot of time --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- really. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Um ...
L:  I think the main [NOISE] thing -- [NOISE] I mean -- I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I would love [NOISE] to learn how cook --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I just haven't -- I haven't had [NOISE] the time lately, so I think when [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when I get the time and [NOISE] -- and the more expendable [NOISE]--
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- income --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'll take --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a cooking class or something --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- [NOISE] and do it that way.
R:  Well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean just -- just [NOISE] a really good book.  Ah, ah, again just browsing through it [NOISE] and seeing [NOISE] if what [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what the person is writing about sound like [NOISE] what you'd [NOISE] like to eat [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's almost a fair [NOISE] indication.  But --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah [NOISE] --
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, I mean convenience [NOISE] is definitely [NOISE] a factor, there's no doubt --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about it. [NOISE]  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] and I think maybe [NOISE] -- I don't know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, two of the [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- four meals I have out are on expenses.  But, ah ...
L:  [MN] Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, well that [NOISE] eases [NOISE] some of the pain. [NOISE] Um, [NOISE] and -- [NOISE] and -- and [NOISE] the food [NOISE] is generally good. [NOISE]  Um --
L:  What -- what do you do for a living?
R:  [NOISE] Ah, I scout locations, ah, for -- ah, currently for a TV show. [NOISE]
L:  Wow. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] But like com- commercials and [NOISE] -- and movies, that type of thing.
L:  That's great.
R:  And, ah -- yeah.  You know it's -- it's -- it's never boring.  Um, but as a consequence I have to learn, if I'm gonna eat out and I'm on -- [NOISE] I'm working. [NOISE]  So I get a [NOISE]--
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I get a [inaudible] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for lunch.  Ah, or I can get something that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I know it's gonna be good --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, ah, it isn't gonna slow me down.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  'Cause invariably you want to relax [NOISE] after you eat and I try to -- I invariably eat [NOISE] on the run or, you know, [NOISE] between runs, so to speak. [NOISE]
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  [MN] But, ah [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, I don't know if we're gonna use up [NOISE] ten minutes here actually. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Why don't you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- why don't you tell me [NOISE] -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what Rittenhouse --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Square is like? [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Um, well, it's ah almost at ground zero, it's very green.  [NOISE]  It's sort of like a mini Central Park.  Ah, if you've ever been to Philadelphia, William Penn --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I injured myself in Philadelphia very badly. [LAUGH]  Actually.
R:  Oh, doing what?
L:  [SIGH] I was Ro- -- I had a friend who was a Rocky fanatic and, ah, we ran up the stairs, and I ran --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- up [NOISE] the stairs in dress shoes [SIGH] and, ah --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- tore -- tore [NOISE] ah, my, ah, my meniscus.
R:  In the knee?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So it [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- never really healed [NOISE] correctly, so ...
R:  Oh.--
L:  [NOISE]
R:  How long ago was that?
L:  [SIGH] That [NOISE] was, ah -- oh God, that was, ah, four years ago. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, give it another five. [NOISE]  Ah, I twisted an ank- -- an ankle and it took nine years for that ankle to come back. [MN]
L:  [NOISE] Really.
R:  Ah, yeah, with the -- with good varying levels of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- -- sensitivity.  Now, it's pretty much --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- okay.  But, ah, yeah, --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] I mean that's, ah, that's interesting.  [MN] Everybody -- well, not everybody but a lot of people do what you just did -- ah, said you did, but [NOISE] it's -- it's, ah, i- in certain times of the year, ah, rowing crews and, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- football --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, teams, when they're out, before they're working out in the morning they run up and down those stairs, [NOISE] ah, like at about five o'clock in the morning.  [MN]  Ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the proper footware for the most part, but, ah [SIGH], yeah, it's interesting there.  But, ah -- so how long were you here, when you were here?
L:  [SIGH] Oh, just for a -- like a -- a night basically.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We just basically ran up the Rocky stairs and went home.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That was it. [NOISE]
R:  Okay, limping. [SIGH] 
L:  I mean I was --
R:  Yeah, okay.
L:  -- [NOISE] my friend, [NOISE] just like I said [NOISE] was a Rocky --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- fanatic [NOISE] and I had to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- get back to school.
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH] You know? [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH] S- --
R:  You still in school? [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Um, no [NOISE] I graduated a coup --
R:  Uh-huh, okay.
L:  -- ah, about a year and a half ago.
R:  All right.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  Well, it's -- [MN] William Penn hated London and he set out Philadelphia on a grid.  Ah, so there's -- there's very few curving streets, ah, everything's a straight line and, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] Rittenhouse Square is one of about four squares that's [MN] at various --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- p- parts of the city.  And they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the big focus, everybody's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- out in the square today.  It's, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think a lot of people have taken lunch off -- they're [LAUGH] -- they're all taking the day off.
L:  [MN] Right.
R:  Um, there's just a lot of people here, and there's dogs, walkers and a couple of cops [inaudible], and, um ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, it's a really beautiful day, [NOISE] and some people are eating lunch right now. [NOISE]  So --
L:  So why, ah -- 
R:  -- a late lunch.
L:  Why did you decide to live in Philadelphia?  Why -- if you're a location manager why not --
R:  Well [SIGH] --
L:  -- you know, move to LA? [NOISE]
R:  Well, because there's no work in LA right now, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it -- it's probably the most European city in America.  I -- I did public relations for seven years and I went to forty two --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of the -- of the states.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Possibly with the exception of New Orleans, which is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- more funky than it is European.  Philadelphia really is European.  There's a --
L:  [NOISE] More so --
R:  -- a lot --
L:  -- than New York? [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, absolutely, yeah.  Um, I've got a love hate thing with New York, ah   But, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there's a lot of French here, there's a lot of Chinese, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there's a lot of Japanese.  It's a very academic town, there's about four or five universities, there's a lot of pharmaceuticals --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there's a lot of medical schools.  So, um, yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the -- the, um, the basic --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- make up is pretty cosmopolitan.  Plus the roots --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, large Irish neighborhoods, Lithuanian neighborhoods, ah --
L:  Italian.
R:  -- etcetera, etcetera.  Italian, definitely, yeah. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, but, [NOISE] um, you can get almost anywhere on foot [NOISE] and, ah, public transportation is good, you don't need a car.  I rent cars.  And you there's actually work here.  You -- you're close enough to New York to get --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- work that might have to come down, or wants to come down, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for various reasons. [NOISE]  And, ah ...
L:  So you make a good living at it?
R:  I make an okay living.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean the economy sucks right now, ah --
L:  Of course.
R:  It's, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where just everything is -- is really off.  That's one of the reasons there's almost --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- no work in LA, it's, ah, [NOISE] -- a lot of the production's going --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to Canada.
L:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] And out of the country.  Ah, wherever --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- else.  But, ah ...
L:  [NOISE]
