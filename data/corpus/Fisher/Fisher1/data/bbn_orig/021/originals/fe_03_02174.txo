L:  Hello.  This is Crystal.
R:  Hi.  This is Joy.
L:  Hi. [SIGH] Um, so, I guess we're, um -- we're going to be talking about food, so, I guess, um, [SIGH] if you want me to start, or do you want to start?
R:  It doesn't matter either way.  Why don't you go ahead and start foods[?]. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Um, I guess we're supposed to describe what our, um, favorite meals --
R:  Favorite meals.  That's what I heard.
L:  Yeah, favorite meal, and then [SIGH] if we prefer to eat at a restaurant or at home.
R:  That's my understanding too [NOISE].
L:  Oh, okay. [SIGH] Um, usually we pretty much eat at home for different reasons, um, we have a few little kids, so, it's a little difficult to e- --
R:  I understand --
L:  [LAUGH] --
R:  -- in fact, I have a one year old toddler --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- at home who's now napping, and I understand exactly how that is.
L:  Yes.
R:  She's a great kid, but she's got a baby's attention span.  Taking her into a nice restaurant's kind of hard with other babies. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, it is.  And it's -- and they start throwing food all over the floor, and --
R:  It's awful. [LAUGH]
L:  -- oh, it -- it's pretty bad.  We have a -- a -- a four year old, a two year --
R:  Oh, you do?
L:  -- old, and then a f- four month old, so --
R:  So, you understand how it is? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yes.  I understand perfectly, and it's -- it's more cost effective for us to, um -- to eat at home.  Um, sometimes it's -- i- it's a little more healthy for us anyway.
R:  I say the same thing, but unfortunately, a lot of us tend to overeat when we go out, although I do enjoy dining out once in a while.
L:  Oh, it's -- it's a lot of fun to dine out.  It's a treat for my husband and I to be able to go out.
R:  Oh, likewise.  But, for us to do that, we have to hire a babysitter and they're expensive, and I know what you mean.  And there's not always time to do it.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  It's -- it's -- you know, with us being tight and stuff, it's -- it's easier to just eat at home, but it's kind of, uh, fun.
R:  I definitely understand.  As far as my favorite type of meal, I love salad, especially steak and chicken salad.
L:  Oh, yummy.  Yeah, we like to [SIGH] -- I don't know, I think we, um -- uh, I guess a perfectly meal would be, if my husband and I went to -- we like -- do you go to the Olive Garden at all?  Sometimes we go to the Olive --
R:  Oh, you know what?  I love the Olive Garden.  I love Italian food.  Now, that would be my perfect treat.
L:  Yes.
R:  In fact I'm trying to ask --
L:  Oh, it's --
R:  -- a certain husband of mine to take me there for Mother's Day. [LAUGH]
L:  Ooh, yeah.  The Olive Garden is wonderful.  Er, they have that salad dressing that goes on that salad.  Oh, you can eat --
R:  Do you know what?  It's so good, and i- it's --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- all you can eat too.  It's great.
L:  Yes, and they have that soup and salad, all you can eat, and that's what we like to go and do, is the soup and salad.
R:  It's really great, and you know what?  And you can find coupons in the paper occasionally, if, you know, when they're unaffordable.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Like three dollars offer or something for an entree, and --
R:  Definitely.  It's really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- nice.  
L:  Yeah, I know --
R:  And they have the best soup over there too.
L:  But, yeah.  Mhm.  They have like a -- I think -- usually they offer like three different kinds of soups, like minestrone, and --
R:  Wedding soup sometimes.
L:  What -- what soup?
R:  Wedding soup sometimes.
L:  Oh.
R:  That's where you have little meatballs and little pasta in the soup.
L:  Oh.  Yeah, my husband likes to get the soup.  Now, what kind of meals do you cook at home?  Do you just like to ...?
R:  I cook a variety of different meals, 'cause I like to make sure that we're eating nutritionally balanced.  For example, I cook a lot of chicken --
L:  Oh, mhm.  So do we --
R:  -- and it's --
L:  -- we cook a lot of chicken.
R:  -- occasionally I make steak, but the red meat that we eat here is  -- I mean, I try to rotate what we eat, to eat balanced.
L:  Oh, yah.
R:  I like to make, like salad, that's very good for me.  We do a lot of grilling outside.  It's kind of nice with the warmer weather.
L:  Oh, grilling?  Mhm.
R:  Yes, like shrimp[?].  You can grill anything, vegetables --
L:  Oh, yum.  Wow.  Now, you're pretty health conscience about -- conscious --
R:  I try to be, but we're not perfect.
L:  Yeah, s- same with us.  I mean, [SIGH] sometimes I -- I make -- I've been trying to make my own bread lately with my little bread machine, and --
R:  Mm, that sounds yummy.  What kind of breads do you like?
L:  Um, we- well, I've been doing whole wheat lately, just the whole wheat, and my husband loves --
R:  Yum.
L:  -- it with like tomatoes and like chicken breast and stuff.
R:  That sounds really good.
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] so, we like to eat that, but --
R:  I haven't baked --
L:  -- it's like you --
R:  -- in a long time, but I like banana bread and cranberry bread.
L:  Oh, yeah, banana bread.  I do that too.
R:  Yum.
L:  So ...
R:  And it's really good for you too.
L:  Yes, it has a lot of potassium in the --
R:  In it --
L:  -- bananas.
R:  -- definitely, and that's important, and magnesium too.
L:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  How about you?  What type of meals do you like to make at home?
L:  Um, we do a lot of chicken too.  Um, a lot of the chicken breasts that we get, like at Cosc- or Sam's Club, and --
R:  Oh, that's good --
L:  -- um --
R:  -- you know what?  Sam's Club is great for being cost effective and having really good food --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- well at least the one near us.
L:  And, so, we never actually pay full prices for, you know, a lot of, uh, the bulk of the, you know, the grocery bill.
R:  Likewise.  They save us -- it's off topic -- a lot of money with a lot of things.  They've got really good phone cards, so, if you ever need to call somebody to invite them over to dinner. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  We do that too.
R:  They do have good deals on that too.
L:  Yeah, we do that.  And then [SIGH] we get, um, our milk there and stuff.  So, basically, we -- [SIGH] we get a lot of our, um, meal stuff from Sam's Club, so, I can prepare --
R:  We do too --
L:  -- some good meals.
R:  -- we get a lot of things in general from them.
L:  What's that?
R:  So, we get a lot of things in general from them.  They have very good deals.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They've got really good meat.  You can get some ground beef.  If you have Memorial Day coming up, and you want to make some hamburgers, that's really good.
L:  Oh, yah.  That's hamburgers and, um [LIPSMACK] -- s- -- uh, do you do -- do you cook a lot of hamburgers at home?
R:  Occasionally.  Like I said, I try to steer away from that, to more nutritional things, but we do have troops[?] here.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.  We like to -- [SIGH] we do -- we don't do a lot of red meat, um --
R:  We don't either --
L:  -- with meals.
R:  -- but I just do that for health reasons.
L:  Yeah.  So, like -- like I said, like the chicken, [SIGH] and then, um, sometimes we do a lot of breakfast meals for dinner.  We do, like the scrambled eggs and pancakes sometimes.
R:  That sounds really good.  Did you know that in the older days, that's what people used to eat for dinner?
L:  Oh, did they?  Wow.
R:  I live in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, and we have something called the Heinz Museum.  They make ketchup, and their headquarters is in Pittsburg.  You go through the museum and they've got the old advertisements that they used to advertise Heinz ketchup and scrambled eggs for dinner back in the forties and fifties.  Can you imagine that?
L:  Oh.  Wow.  Oh, then I'm not too odd.  I'm right along with them.
R:  No, you're not.  In fact, that's what people -- a good source of protein.
L:  Yeah, it is.  The eggs and, um, you know, if you put a -- like a strip of bacon with that, and that a- adds a little bit of flavor.  Um -- if we have --
R:  Yum.
L:  -- pancakes too much, my husband starts complaining about it. [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but, um, he doesn't mind really.  And, um, also, we can do like a bl- blueberry syrup over the pancakes and stuff.
R:  That sounds really yummy.  Do you make your --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- own, or do you buy it from the store?
L:  Um, well, actually my mom has a -- some blueberry plants, and so, we --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- pick the blueberries, and [SIGH] we use that over the, uh, crepes or whatever, and so -- and especially --
R:  I make pancakes when we're having a treat and I make my own waffles, that's really good.
L:  Ooh, yummy.  Waffles are good too, for a breakfast dinner, [SIGH] but, um -- what else do we do?  I don't know.  There's a -- there's a lot of produce -- like in the summer, sometimes, uh, my mom actually does, [SIGH] um, [SIGH] like garden meals.  She gets to dig --
R:  Really?
L:  -- digs the potatoes and the corn off the cob and stuff.  That's really good during the summer.
R:  Yeah, and you know what's good too?  If you take a really big portabella mushroom, and you grill it.  If you're trying to save some[?] calories, but still want something good --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- marinate it in a red wine, and you could make, uh, equivalent of a mushroom hamburger out of it.  It's good.
L:  Oh, is that with mushrooms?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh.  My husband --
R:  Sam's Club has --
L:  -- loves mushrooms.
R:  -- them really cheap and really good beefsteak tomatoes and portabella mushrooms, and in the summer time that's really good.
L:  Oh, wow. [SIGH] Yeah, like sometimes -- I think I've done it once or twice -- I don't prefer mushrooms, my husband loves mushrooms, so, you kind of fry it up and saute it, and he absolutely --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- loves it, so [SIGH].
R:  We all have different tastes, that's respected.
L:  Yeah, yeah. [SIGH] But, let's see what else.  We do a --
R:  I'm picky about the ones I eat, 'cause the kind of ones you find in the store, they never taste good [several inaudible words].
L:  Now, do you, um -- do you have a -- your own little garden or ...?
R:  I have a very small one because we're in an apartment.
L:  Oh, okay, yeah.
R:  We have, uh, like a small backyard area that's ours.  It's -- but we don't have a lot here.  We don't really have a home[?].  Do you?
L:  Um, no, not our own garden, but, um, at my parents' house, they have a big garden, so she likes --
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  -- to do a lot of garden meals and stuff with the [SIGH] -- with the food from the garden, and it's pretty healthy, and we're in Washington State, so, it's, um --
R:  Really?
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  So, we get a lot of rain and stuff, so, [SIGH] it grows pretty good over here for the garden meals and stuff.
R:  Even though I'm not in Washington State, Pennsylvania, especially in the Pittsburg area, seems to get a lot of rain too.
L:  Oh, mhm.
R:  So, probably like yourself, we see a lot of apples growing around here, and a lot of grapes.
L:  Oh.  
R:  And those are really good.  Out of season, but really good. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Yeah. [SIGH]
R:  Do you have any trees growing around your area[?], or at your parents house?
L:  Um, they have, um, some fruit trees I think, like apples and stuff, but, um, not -- not a whole lot.  I mean, not a whole lot.
R:  I've always liked cooking different foods with ap- ...
