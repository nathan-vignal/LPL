R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Maree. [NOISE]
R:  Hi, I'm Lisa.
L:  [NOISE] Hi.
R:  I've never done this before. [LAUGH]
L:  Neither have I. [LAUGH]  [SIGH] We're just supposed to talk about food for eight minutes. [SIGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I live in New York and they want to know --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- if I prefer eating out or pref- -- +prefer cooking.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I love to cook.
L:  Do you?
R:  But I -- I can't do it seven days a week.
L:  I hate to cook.  I live in Pennsylvania.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My husband does most of the cooking. [SIGH]
R:  What kind of food do you like?
L:  Ah, [COUGH] I like to go out because you don't have the mess to clean up.  [SIGH] And it's not really, I guess, that I don't like cooking, it's that I don't know a lot of how to, because my mother always gave us frozen entrees. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So [NOISE], I'm, ah, [SIGH] probably an experimental cooker, I guess you could say.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  [COUGH] And they eat anything just [NOISE] about, except fish.
R:  Your family?
L:  Yes, [NOISE] two kids and my husband and myself.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  How about you?
R:  Um, I'm a vegan --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- don't eat any meat or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- anything that comes from animal.
L:  So isn't it hard to [NOISE] --
R:  It's --
L:  -- prepare things?
R:  -- kind of -- it forced --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- experimental --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like yourself.
L:  Especially if you're going out.
R:  [MN] Well, there's actually a lot of places to choose from in New York that cater to vegetarian and vegans --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and like healthy lifestyles, so it is actually fairly easy to eat out.
L:  What's the difference between that and vegetarian? [NOISE]
R:  Just no animal products, no dairy, no cheese --
L:  So no butter or anything? [NOISE]
R:  -- no milk, no butter.  Mhm.
L:  [MN] Well, for milk then [NOISE] what do you do?
R:  [MN] I don't drink it.  Either that or I use soy milk. 
L:  Okay. [NOISE]
R:  It comes from beans and, [SIGH] it's just as good.  Um, so I enjoy eating out because --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- the places that are really [NOISE] healthy create these amazing creative dishes --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that, ah, introduce y- -- like my mouth to new flavors beside your meat and potato [NOISE] type dishes.
L:  Right. [MN]
R:  So when I go out and eat, because I like cooking, then I'll go [NOISE] home and try to cook it and make it better.
L:  Oh.  Okay. [SIGH] [MN]  Plus when you eat at home you save --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- more money --
R:  That's true. [NOISE]
L:  -- than going out. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Especially nowadays everything seems to be on a tight budget for everybody.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] Is there a lot of areas to eat in your -- [SIGH] where you live?  Do you live right in the city?
R:  I live in Brooklyn, so it's a couple of stops --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- into the city.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But Brooklyn is actually the biggest borough, so we have a lot of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- selection as far as restaurants go from --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, your cheap fast food to inexpensive --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- lunches to fifty dollar steaks.
L:  [MN] Oh.
R:  So, whatever you want you can find it here, and it's pretty much all deliverable until four in the morning.
L:  Wow.
R:  [MN] So, if you are a night owl or you work strange hours or just have cravings --
L:  Right.
R:  -- first thing in the morning or late at night, after a night of drinking, you can --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- eat whatever you want, you know.
L:  And see, round here [SIGH] everything closes by nine or ten, so if you're travelling through and you're hungry --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you're out of luck.
R:  [LAUGH] That's no good.
L:  No.
R:  [SIGH] That's why it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- always hard to leave New York because I crave those staples that I'm used to having --
L:  Right. [SIGH]
R:  -- all the time, you know.
L:  Right. [MN] Gee. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, my parents [NOISE] live in the Mid West, so every time I go there I -- it's all family -- or it's all, um, [LIPSMACK] what are they called?  Ah, like Chili's and Applebee's --
L:  Right. [SIGH]
R:  -- and those types of places.  Where here I like to support the independent stores --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and the boutiques.  The people that --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it's a family owned business.
L:  Right. [SIGH]
R:  You know you are actually getting like Roman Italian food.
L:  Exactly. [NOISE]
R:  And they are going to make it good because that's their business.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They have to do this well to survive or they're not going to survive and they'll have to go back to their own country --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- or whatever.
L:  Right. [NOISE]  I agree.
R:  So, I like the diversity.
L:  I agree. [SIGH]  How about pasta, do you eat that?
R:  [MN] Rarely.  It's funny, because my room mate last night was commenting about the healthy way that I eat.  She's like, "You --"
L:  [SIGH]
R:  "-- eat pretty much anything but pasta".  And I'm like, "Well --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- it doesn't really do much for me".  But every once in a while I really like a good bowl of pasta --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- with some eggplant, homemade tomato sauce, but just like the spaghetti.
L:  That's a lot of work.
R:  Maybe like once a month. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Homemade sauce.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE]
R:  But I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like to do that and then, you know, you make a big bowl and then you can eat it a couple of times that week.
L:  Right.
R:  But it's difficult to cook all the time and work.
L:  It is. [SIGH]
R:  So now I'm working at home --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and freelancing I have time to actually cook --
L:  Ah, that's nice.
R:  -- two or three meals a day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  Great.
R:  So it makes a big difference.  I can feel -- m- -- I feel more energized.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  And I get kinda bummed out if I go out and spend like ten --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- dollars on lunch and it sucks.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, you could have s- saved it.
R:  And you did it because of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- convenience, you know.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That -- that's probably [SIGH] -- we're on the go a lot so, that's why [NOISE] sometimes we feel like we [MN] are living in the car: run to soccer; run to dancing; run to cheering; run to [NOISE] music lessons.
R:  Sure.
L:  [SIGH] We're running every day of the week except Sunday. [SIGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  So [NOISE] sometimes we can't avoid going.  We have [NOISE] to go out.  You know, unless I [SIGH] -- which I do, sometimes put something in the car.  You know, throw together [SIGH] vegetables in a bag or fruit in a bag and, "Here, f- f- -- just until after your soccer game and then, you know, we'll go home and eat". [MN]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's true.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  Like, even like, we're so busy, my boyfriend and I, that sometimes we only eat two meals a day.  [SIGH] Because by the time --
L:  You just don't have time for that third one.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Right.
R:  It's like right now we're getting ready to go into the city, and then we'll go out tonight --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and we won't get home until probably two in the morning.
L:  Mhm. [SIGH]
R:  So we'll eat now and maybe have a snack later, and that's it.
L:  Yeah.  You're forced --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- to sometimes.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  But it's --yeah.
L:  But it's nice to work from home, like you said, then you have it right there.
R:  You have no excuse.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  So, I wonder what else they want us to talk about.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How -- how many minutes did we use up?
R:  Um, let me see ... two -- six or seven so far.
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And then do they get back on? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, they'll tell us at like the eight minute --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- mark that we've talked enough.
L:  Oh.
R:  What kind of restaurants --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do you like?
L:  [MN] Um, [SIGH] ones that aren't really expensive.  Like we don't do the sixty dollar steak --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- definitely --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ever. [SIGH]  Um, probably middle of the line, you know, not --n- not a greasy place, but I -- I like, like you said, independent people that [SIGH] are trying to make a go of it and trying to make it a family business and [SIGH] keep customers coming back, that type of thing. [MN]
R:  Do you f- --
L:  We do have all those Applebee, all those Garden Chili places around here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But we don't go to them [SIGH].  Um ...
R:  That's good.
L:  I'm not saying I --
R:  Because I feel like if you support those places then eventually all we are going to have --
L:  Is that.
R:  -- is like Chili's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and Starbucks and Applebee's --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- and nothing else.
L:  I -- I -- [NOISE] I think so too. [SIGH]
R:  It's a little upsetting because a lot of those places are starting to pop up in New York.  We just like a T- -- another T.G.I.F., you know, the fiftieth Starbucks.  And it's like do we really need that?
L:  [SIGH] Do we need that?  That's the other thing I think too. [NOISE] [SIGH]  Sooner or later --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I just feel there's nothing going to be left except houses in America and [SIGH] we always have to trade oil and food and this and that.  W- what about farming in our own [NOISE] country.  Every farm that is around here where I live [SIGH] has almost been sold to a developer. [SIGH]  And maybe they only grew corn, or maybe they only grew wheat, or maybe they only grew -- I don't know, grapes, apples, whatever.  [SIGH] But, [SIGH] now where are we getting the stuff that they used to grow?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And if we just keep turning all of our land into condos -- [SIGH] I -- I think people should have to buy.
R:  We're not going to be self sufficient --
L:  No.  We're not --
R:  -- anymore.
L:  -- we're not.  And -- and I really fell that we aren't [SIGH] because nothing [MN] hardly is American made, nothing is -- I'm not saying nothing is American grown, there still are a lot of farmers but [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] -- we -- we live in a city, so we live in a row home, and that's like an apartment or a townhouse [NOISE], probably similar to [NOISE] New York City, you know.  It's a [NOISE] smaller city, but [SIGH] it's a high crime area.  So we get away on the weekends, we have a trailer, and it's in the mountains. [NOISE]  [SIGH] And I love going there because every single weekend [NOISE] we get to go the farmers' market and get the freshest [SIGH] [NOISE] tomatoes and the freshest apples.  And -- and [NOISE] it's [NOISE] all grown on their farm. [NOISE]  And the taste is just so much better. [MN]
R:  No, I totally agree.  We have farmers' markets here and I try to support those, [NOISE] or the people p- pushing the carts with the fruit --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on the corners, [SIGH] versus going to the supermarket.
L:  Yeah.  I mean sometimes you have to go to the supermarket, but [SIGH] I just [NOISE] taste -- I don't know, maybe it's just [NOISE] me, I taste the difference in the product [NOISE].
R:  Mhm.
L:  I do.  I -- [NOISE] I just think their apples are so much crispier and -- and juicer.
R:  Sure.
L:  And, I don't know.
R:  They're not waxed and --
L:  We don't know where they're coming from when they're in the grocery store.
R:  -- sprayed with preservatives.
L:  I know where they're coming from when I buy it from the farmers' market.  I know it's fresh.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I know that that money is going to them and not -- [SIGH] who knows who?
R:  Right.  [SIGH] No.  I agree with you and sometimes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- now that men are making animals and crossbreeding --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- different kinds [NOISE] of fruit and making them without growing them on trees anymore.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  [MN] They're not -- the FDA does not require them to put any kinds of stickers f- fruit and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- produce like that.
L:  I didn't know that.
R:  So you don't even know where your produce is coming from when you buy it at the grocery store.
L:  I didn't know that. [SIGH]
R:  Sometimes if I see like really large grapefruits --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm like, "This isn't possible, this is not physically or humanly [LAUGH] possible.  Where did this thing come from?"  But you just don't know.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] We have an orchard that's about seven miles away.  [SIGH] And their apples are really, really expensive, but they're the biggest apples that you ever saw.  And [SIGH] the place, if you've ever heard of Mrs Prindable's[?] Apples?
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  They're chocolate dipped, they're like twenty one dollars for one apple.  And I said, "Who would pay twenty one dollars for one apple?" "Well, did you ever have one of her apples?" I said, "No.  I'm diabetic, I really shouldn't have chocolate".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Taste one of their apples without it". [MN]  It was the best apple I ever had.
R:  Wow.
L:  And that, I found out, because [NOISE] I researched it, that it comes from right here, nine -- nine miles away at the orchard.  And I don't know how they get their apples that big, but ... [SIGH] They had it gated in so people aren't going to [NOISE] the orchard at night to pick apples. [NOISE] You know, it's gated in, and the trees have been there forever and you can [NOISE] see the apples growing and ... [SIGH] Not as big as a grapefruit, but bigger than a regular apple.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And just, really a good taste.  So, whenever we can [NOISE] a- afford that luxury we'll go get apples from there. [SIGH]
R:  Oh, that's neat.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  They're really a good apple.
R:  Wow.
L:  [MN] But other than that I see to think thank most of the farms are [NOISE] -- I don't know about your area or if you ever drive through, you know, fields
