R:  Hello.
L:  Hey.  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  I'm good.  My name is Debbie.
L:  Hi.  I'm Tracey.
R:  And I'm calling from -- I'm from Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, yeah.  So am I.
R:  What part?
L:  [LAUGH] Mount Aries[?].
R:  Oh, no.  I'm up here --
L:  That where you are?
R:  I'm up here in Moscow.
L:  Oh, yeah?  Oh, okay.
R:  But --
L:  I ain't home right now though.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, I'm down at the shore.
R:  Oh, in Jersey?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, ah, our topic today is food. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  Try -- I'll to stick to the subject. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay. [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH] Um, they say d- do you like eating in a restaurant or out, and my opinion, I would rather cook my own meals.  I don't really like eating out that much any more.
R:  Right, right.  I have to agree with you.  I do like to cook, I have a family and I do like to cook and eat home.  We eat home a lot.  [SIGH] But my husband -- we enjoy chinese food, and that's one, [SIGH] ah, ethnic food that I can't cook. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] So, we do like to go out for that.  And n- now with the buffets that they have all over the place, you know, it's [SIGH] really good, you know, we l- we like to do that. [SIGH]  That's basically --
L:  Yeah.  Chinese food is good.  I mean, I like it too, but I -- I can't really cook it either.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH] Yeah.  I -- I tried but it -- it, you know, doesn't -- it's not the same.
L:  Mm mm.
R:  And if you get any kind of mix or whatever that they sell in the supermarket it doesn't come out the same. [SIGH]  So, that's one thing, like we -- we usually go like every other week.  There's a nice Chinese restaurant over here that we go to.  But otherwise we eat home, and I cook.  I enjoy cooking, you know, I enjoy cooking for holidays and having family over and friends.  [SIGH] You know, it's never bothered me.
L:  That's great.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, my mom likes that too.
R:  And I have children so, you know, you're always making -- preparing something.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  [NOISE] And you got kids.  How many children [NOISE] do you have?
R:  I have two girls.
L:  How old are they?
R:  Ah, w- my youngest is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- four, and she's gonna be five next week.  And then my [SIGH] older one is eight and gonna be nine next -- in [inaudible].
L:  Oh, you just -- you all just starting.  How long you all been married?
R:  Oh, I've been married [LAUGH] a long time. [SIGH]
L:  A long time?
R:  [SIGH] Ah, let's see, ah [SIGH] I was married for -- for eighteen years in May.
L:  Wow!
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] The lady I talked to the other day she was married for like thirty some years.
R:  Oh.  [SIGH] That's a long time.
L:  You all really have got it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Got some kinda magic going on there.
R:  No, it's just [LAUGH] -- I don't know if it's magic but --
L:  Hey, it may be the food. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, right. [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] That's what they say, the quickest way --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to a man's heart is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- through his stomach.
R:  That's true, and my husband loves to eat. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So ...  He's Italian and he loves to eat.
L:  Oh, you husband's Italian?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh wow!
R:  So ...
L:  I could imagine.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, you don't make a lot of, um, Italian, um, dishes for him?
R:  Sure.  Sure.  So, that's why when we're eating out -- you know what it is, ah, ah, my feeling about eating out?  Is if I can prep- can prepare at home, I feel I can cook it better than if I eat out. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Especially with Italian food, like in -- in -- in Pennsylvania.  I'm originally from -- from Brooklyn.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, in New York it's a different story with restaurants, you know, you could always find, you know, something that's appetizing.  But I find up here, in the mountains, it's very different.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And their -- their, you know, idea of pizza, even -- even the simplest thing of the pizza is very different than New York pizza. [SIGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  So, you know [MN] with Italian food, that I definitely -- I cook home, we do not eat that out at all.
L:  I don't blame you.  Its like --
R:  I guess the only -- they eat --
L:  The Alavar[?], um, Garden, you ever went there?
R:  Yes, I was there once.
L:  Did you like it?
R:  It was okay.
L:  'Cause I hear a lot of people -- I was gonna go there and lot of people kept saying, "Oh, that place is awful.  The food sucks." and everything.  I said, "Well, maybe I shouldn't go there".
R:  [NOISE] You know what?  It -- I -- I had this conversation with someone recently.  And, you know, when I can't remember what I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ordered and ate.  That means that it wasn't that great. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, I know they had -- the salad was very good, and it was all you can eat salad.  [SIGH] And I think was bread stick.  I don't remember how the bread -- the salad was delicious. [SIGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I remember also is that we had ordered like a few appetizers, and I think my husband had a glass of wine.  And before you know it the bill was up to seventy dollars.
L:  What?
R:  Yeah.
L:  In that Ala- Garden?
R:  Yep.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  And if you don't stick to like just your entree or whatever you're ordering [SIGH] the bill really gets up there really quick.  [SIGH] So, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when we got the bill we were like, "Oh, my God" because he had had like a piece of cheesecake, he had a glass of wine, and I think we had like two appetizers and the bill was --
L:  That's terrible.
R:  It was over seventy dollars.  We never went back, we only went once.
L:  Now that's terrible.  A lot of people told me they only went one time.
R:  Yeah.  I wasn't happy.  It's like a -- it's like a glorified fast food restaurant I feel.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know.
L:  Well, they say the Spaghetti House is good.  You ever been down there?
R:  I never heard of it.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, you never heard of it.
R:  Where is that?
L:  That's actually down like near South Philly in Philadelphia.
R:  Oh no.  I'm not familiar with that.  I've only gone to Sesame Place down there.  [LAUGH] That's all.
L:  Ses- oh, yeah, you been to Sesame Place, uh-huh.
R:  A couple of times. [SIGH]
L:  Okay, you haven't been here to --
R:  So, no, I'm not familiar with that.
L:  That's Lowenhome[?] theater.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah, it's nice up there.
R:  Very nice.
L:  Mhm.
R: [SIGH] But, um ... mm, I think we have to stay on the phone for ten minutes right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I don't know what else to say about food, but ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I like to eat it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH]
R:  And it shows. [LAUGH]
L:  How about baking?  Do you do a lot of baking too, or are you just ...?
R:  No, I'm not a very good baker.  I can't even -- a box cake doesn't even come out right for me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I just -- you know what it is?  I don't have the patience to measure --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] and be so precise with baking.  But with like with cooking you just throw in your spices, whatever you do it -- you know.  [SIGH] I do usually do everything by eye, so every time I try to bake it never comes out right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How about yourself?
L:  Well, um, [NOISE] I think 'cause my parents were from south, um, I learned how to do it.  A- at first I couldn't do it at all.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And as I got to my [NOISE] adulthood I -- I learned how to [NOISE] do it.  Now it -- it's nothing to me.
R:  What do you like baking?
L:  Um, I like baking [NOISE] cakes and pies and cookies. [NOISE]
R:  Oh.
L:  Stuff like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I wasn't -- I wasn't the family cook, my sister was.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [SIGH] She was the -- [SIGH] the big one.  Everybody said, "Oh, she can cook so good.  Now you -- you're the cleaner though".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But it turned out that, um, I can do -- I could do both.
R:  So, you're from the south originally?
L:  Well, my parents are from North Carolina.
R:  Oh.  So, how do you make fried -- good fried chicken? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  It takes a lot of recip- lot of spices, herbs and spices.  Like, um, just like, um, KFC.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They use a lot of 'em.
R:  And what do y- like I tried, but mine never comes out that great.
L:  Wh -- what are the spices you need to put it?
R:  [NOISE] Do you know what?  Maybe it's be- -- how are you preparing when you first -- do you like batter -- when you batter up, do you like roll it in --
L:  I just flour it.  I -- I put all my spices in my flour.  [NOISE]
R:  And then --
L:  [NOISE] Okay.  What about [NOISE] ah, sometimes you gotta like put a -- take a egg --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and break the egg up mix it up into like with the chicken.
R:  Okay.
L:  Well, make sure you rinse your meat in cold water first.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then do the egg thing.  [NOISE] And then you can put a little milk in there if you want to, with it.
R:  Okay.
L:  Some people do the milk or the egg, but sometimes I do both.
R:  Okay.
L:  And then [NOISE] you can use your flour or you [NOISE] can use breadcrumbs.
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  Either one. [NOISE]  And then like you add all your different spices, like you might want to add -- um, [NOISE] of course you've got your pepper your garlic.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, um, ah, onion, um, things like that.  Oregano, parsley, all of that stuff.
R:  Okay.  I'm gonna try that.
L:  You know, whatever you feel that makes it [NOISE] taste, you know, [NOISE] your taste buds up [NOISE] mix it in there.
R:  Yeah.  I never, you know, egged it or put any milk in it.  And I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  I'm gonna try --
L:  Try egg first, because apparently what it does is it kinda -- what it does is it kinda gets the meat ready.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know and when that pan's really hot and the grease mix, oh it's delicious.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Do you usually bake in regular oil or olive oil?
R:  Usually, ah, regular oil.
L:  Yeah, olive oil -- I mean, 'cause you've got an Italian husband you -- olive oil is ideal for baking chicken.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Try that. [NOISE]
R:  All right.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, it should come out nice. [NOISE]
R:  Thanks for the tips. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] You're welcome.
R:  I hear you got a bird in the background, huh?
L:  These are these seagulls down here and they're eating --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- actually they're eating chicken now.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  What part of Jersey are you in?
L:  Huh?
R:  W-
L:  Oh, Atlantic City.
R:  Oh, how nice.
L:  Yeah, they got those, um, those huge birds out here and they [NOISE] keep --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- getting bigger and bigger.
R:  Yeah.  What do you go down to gamble? [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH] Sometimes to gamble.  Sometimes [NOISE] just to hang out. [NOISE]  I- I didn't --
R:  That's a hike to go down there from Mount Aries.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, it is.
R:  [NOISE] You know I haven't been down in Atlantic City in many years.
L:  Well, you ain't missing anything. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah I -- well, you know what it is?  Like we used -- seem funny we're on the topic of food.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  We used to go down there for the buffet --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [SIGH] in the, um, Trump Castle.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  My husband used to love the buffet that they had there.  [LAUGH] So we used to -- when we lived in Brooklyn we used to take a ride there, because it was only like a little over two and a half hours.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So we used to drive there and we used to go the buffet in the Trump and usually see a show.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And yeah, do a little gambling, but I'm not much for gambling.
L:  Yeah.  I'm not a really big gambler.  But, um, my, um, husband [NOISE] he is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He's the one that can gamble and can win.  I can't win anything. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I usually take like one hundred dollars --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with me and then what happens, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I lose like fifty and I'm like, okay --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's enough. [LAUGH] [NOISE] I've had enough.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I can't stand losing so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's probably what it is. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  But, ah y-
L:  But the food -- the buffets are -- that's funny you mentioned that.  The buffets down here, they say the Show Bull, I think, has got the top buffet right now.
R:  Yeah, well I don't even think that hotel was there when I -- or -- or -- or we never went to that hotel when I was -- last time I was there.
L:  Oh, you've never been?
R:  [COUGH] The last time I was there was in nineteen ninety, when the Taj Mahal opened up.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.  Oh, okay. [NOISE]
R:  That's a long time ago.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I can't say.
R:  We were there like right -- like they had been only open for a couple of months.
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
R:  And we had gone to see the Taj Mahal.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  And I think we had eaten in the, ah -- it was Merv Griffin's hotel, I don't remember what the name of it was.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they had had a buffet there but it -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- wasn't very good.
L:  [NOISE] The boardwalk food is not that [NOISE] good either.  They got buffets on the boardwalk and it is terrible. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think their as good -- their chicken is half way, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Argh.
R:  Yeah, I remember it was the Trump Castle we used to go to.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  We -- at -- at that time, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, in the eighties that was very popular, that hotel.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  And ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like I said, they used to have a great -- great buffet.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] That was then.
L:  I think a lot of people come down here because they give away like, y- ah, a buffet.
R:  Right, or r-
L:  And a room with it.
R:  Mm hm.
L:  You know.  And everybody says, "Okay, I'll take that".
R:  Yeah, I've never had that kind of luck. [SIGH]
L:  You never got one of those?
R:  No.  Because I don't really gamble much.  We -- you know, you -- you gotta like be spending a little money there for them to give you that.
L:  Yeah.  You gotta lose [NOISE] in order for them to invite you. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's the same thing.
R:  See they don't want me back down there.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They'd lose money on me.
L:  They love when you lose though.
R:   Oh, yeah.
L:  They just love it because they -- they -- that's [NOISE] why they probably keep sending for me.
