R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Zoe.
L:  Hi, I'm Lynn.
R:  Hi, Lynn.
L:  Uh, this is funny because this -- I -- I've only done this once.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But that was what my call was last time.
R:  Oh no, you have the same thing?
L:  Really -- yeah.
R:  That's funny.
L:  So I don't know if I'm supposed to do it again.  I -- I'll just do it again.  It's --
R:  Oh, do it again. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, um, you go first, since I've already done this. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] Well, it's funny 'cause when the first part of the question said do you have lots of friends and acquaintances or do you only -- I -- I guess I -- I kind of -- have split between.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like I have a lot of friends who I'll kind of keep updated about, like, the major things in my life.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um [LIPSMACK] but I've -- I'm young and I've moved a couple of times since college so there's --
L:  How old are you?
R:  -- sort of like a couple of different groups of friends in different places.
L:  Uh-huh, right.
R:  And I keep in touch with them to varying degrees but there's like really two or three friends who I just, no matter where I go, I really, sort of, stay in touch and every time I talk to them feel very close and connected with them and, um, and then, whenever I move, the people who -- the people who, like, you know, are in my neighborhood or -- or who I hung out with, um, where I was living, I don't necessarily keep in total touch with them once I leave.
L:  Right.
R:  So I guess -- so I guess I have, you know, a bunch of people who, you know, I know pretty well and if I'm there, living in the same place [LAUGH] as them a lot, I'll -- I'll see them a lot and they'll know what's going on in my life but then, you know, something changes and shifts and I don't necessarily keep in touch with them afterwards.
L:  Hm.
R:  So that's, sort of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what I -- what I'm like.
L:  Um, I am -- I'm a little bit older than you obviously but I, um, I've lived in this same area for my whole life.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So I like have -- I have the most wonderful friends in the whole world and people I've been friends for -- for a long time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, my -- my son is a senior in high school this year.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  And he is actually -- one of his friends is the son of one of my friends from high school.
R:  Oh wow, that's incredible.
L:  And so, I mean -- and I have actually -- and my best friend from high school just lives not far from me.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And we actually lost touch for a few years but what was so weird was when we -- when we finally did talk, it was like we never missed a beat.
R:  Right.
L:  So the -- the people [SIGH] -- I mean, I have a lot of different degrees of friends but I feel very blessed in that department.  It was interesting that they would pick that subject for me because --
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, I -- I always tell people I have the best friends in the whole world.  Not just people that, like, are acquaintances that [SIGH] you know, you -- I mean, I'm talking deep serious friends --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- that would do anything in the world for me and have.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and the same with me so I feel -- but then I have, you know, casual acquaint -- work people, work acquaintances.
R:  Right, right.
L:  But it seems like every time that I've changed jobs, um -- and I'm forty one --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so I've had several jobs, but it's like I carry at least one friend --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Huh.
L:  -- that I still talk to so I'm -- I'm a very talkative, chatty person --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I usually seem to make friends but I think being -- uh, the last lady I talked to said -- she said, "I think it's 'cause you've lived in the same area for so long" 'cause it's easier to keep -- you know --
R:  Keep -- keep in touch, yeah.
L:  -- you run into people -- yeah, you even run into people.  But like now I was trying to think when you were talking about moving.
R:  Right.
L:  If I moved now, I , you know, I still have a tremendous amount of friends that I feel like I would keep in, you know, pretty close contact with --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and would still know.  But it's hard, you know, if you move around and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, then -- and then when you have kids, too, you know, you bond more with the parents and --
R:  That's true, yeah.
L:  --it just happens to be cool that it's girl -- a girl that I went to school with, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you know --
R:  That's really neat.
L:  Yeah, that is pretty cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  I live in Philadelphia.
L:  Oh wow!
R:  Where do you live?
L:  I live in Texas.
R:  Texas?
L:  Yeah, 'cause you pr- --
R:  I was figuring so but --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I figured you could probably tell.
R:  I don't -- I don't know, I haven't been -- I've never been really south of Washington DC so I -- I can't tell by people's accents what part of the country they're from at all. [LAUGH]
L:  Really?  Most -- most of the time Texas is a dead giveaway. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  You know, other than that, you know --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I guess, I just knew you were somewhere different than Texas. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right, right, right, right, yeah.
L:  Well, so, you -- did you just sign up to do this?  Have you -- this is a kind of a new thing.  I'm -- I was just thinking, "Okay, I can do this". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well some friends of mine -- some friends of mine, you know, work at U Penn which is where the study's being done.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So they, sort of, hear about the studies whenever there's a study --
L:  And they let you know?
R:  -- and so some -- one of my friends just emailed me about it, yeah.
L:  See, and now I -- I was unemployed at one point and -- it's been over two years ago, and a girl used to send me these.  She said, "Well, this'd be something that you could do that, you know, give you extra cash in the meantime" and I don't do very many but when I got this one I was like, "Okay, I can talk to people".
R:  Exactly.
L:  "This is cool" and I hang up and I go inside, "I just made ten bucks".
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Okay, this is great, you know.
R:  Yeah, it's fun, yeah.
L:  So it's kind of neat --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to talk to people in different places.
R:  Right.  It was interesting to hear you talking about your friend from high school because I've actually spoke to my best friend from high school this afternoon and -- I, like, grew up in Boston [LIPSMACK] and --
L:  Oh, you did?  See, I worked for Fidelity in our corporate offices here.
R:  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
L:  Yeah, do you know anybody that works for Fidelity?
R:  No, I don't, no, I don't but I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I grew up in that area and then my best friend moved.  When she went to college, she went to Canada, she went to Toronto.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  And when I went to college I went to Philadelphia and we -- so, you know, it was ha- -- it was pre- -- kind of hard to keep in touch.  We kept in touch pretty well during college but not that well.
L:  Right.
R:  And these days we try and ta- -- you know, she -- you know, we on- -- we're not -- we're not -- neither of us are that great at keeping in touch but we'll talk every, you know, couple of months at least.
L:  Well, see, yeah, my -- my best friend from high school that I was telling you, we lived by each other -- we lived near each other, uh, for several years but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it wasn't until our reunion that we kind of got back in contact.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then it was just like we ne- -- and it was like, "Oh my gosh we've lived this close for all this long".
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause her kids are a little bit younger,
R:  Uh-huh
L:  I just have one son and --
R:  Uh-huh
L:  -- she's got three girls and so, you know, you -- you know, when you're doing the parent thing you kinda get involved with the parents --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of your age group of kids more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  More like but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I could call her today and we'd talk for hours and it would be like, "Yeah, remember in -- you know, from high school?" and you're like, "Yeah, yeah" you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  The same energy's still there.
L:  And that's -- that's really cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And even, you know -- [SIGH] I'm very blessed and I almost think I'm bragging but I do really have wonderful friends but --
R:  That's great.
L:  -- I think even if you have just one person --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- that you can do that with --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that you're still -- you're just as blessed.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I have --
L:  Because some people don't connect with -- you know --
R:  That's true, mhm.
L:  -- they just don't seem to -- you know, you've got to have one --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you've got to have somebody, somewhere.  I don't care if they're on the other side of the world, that you can just totally be you.
R:  That's right, that's right.
L:  And -- and you should always have that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Everybody [LAUGH] should.
R:  I feel -- I feel lucky that I do -- I have people like that.  It's funny because in -- you know, both times that I've moved and started, you know [MN] meeting new people I, you know, just -- it's -- it's incredible how you meet the right people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It just sort of happens, you know.
L:  Yes, well it's like you just attract --
R:  And, uh --
L:  The chemistry.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like -- it's like meeting, uh, you know, a guy.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  It's like -- it's still -- it's a chemistry thing.
R:  Right, right.  Yeah, so I -- so it's -- and it's kind of fun, too, when I'm in a new -- when I've, you know -- I've been living where I'm living right now for two years now but I'm still search -- figuring out who are the people that I really want to get to know better.  But it's really neat to no- -- to notice that when I first, you know, meet somebody for the first time, like, you know, I can kind of really tell.
L:  Yeah, right off.
R:  Okay, like here's somebody that I really want to, you know, try and connect with more.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  But it's so interesting because, you know, some -- when -- when you move -- somebody who move -- you know, who's new to this area, some of -- some of the folks who [LIPSMACK] I want to get to know, um, have been living in this neighborhood for a while.  When they went to college they were living in this neighborhood or whatever and all their friends they know from school and, um -- so it's sort of interesting to see how new friends -- how certain people are open to new friends in their lives, more than others.
L:  And other people aren't yeah.
R:  Yeah, or just, you know --
L:  Yeah, some people are very private.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I mean, like to me it would panic me to move to a new place just because I've lived here all my life.
R:  Sure.
L:  But I can tell you that it wouldn't take me long to meet people just because of, you know, I just seem to meet people very easy.
R:  Right.
L:  But, you know, I -- I have friends even, that you know, are just -- they're more private than our -- than I am, you know.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And I always say -- and they're okay with that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You see I -- I think my sec- -- part of my security is my friends [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, surely.
L:  I have to have my friends, you know, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Are you --
L:  Well, I'll -- I'll tell you this for a quick, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When they cut you off, they just cut you off.
R:  I know, I know.
L:  I mean, I didn't even get to say bye.
R:  This is my third call, too.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] I was go -- I was --
R:  I know, isn't it funny?
L:  I felt bad.  I was like, I didn't get to say bye.
R:  Right, right.
L:  It was just, like, you know, okay, you're done, er -- [LAUGH].
R:  Right, right.
L:  [LAUGH] Gee.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But do you know if we're supposed to do anything 'cause I just signed up for this, like, Friday.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Have to do any kind of report or --
R:  I don't think so, no.
L:  So, I mean --
R:  No.
L:  They just keep track of it?
R:  Yep.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- 'cause I was like I don't know if I was supposed to email somebody or --
R:  Well did you -- did you -- did you sign up on the web and you gave them all --
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, that's all the information they need, I think, yeah, and they keep track of how many calls you've made and stuff like that.
L:  [NOISE] Maybe this is just the call of the day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The friend thing. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, probably. [LAUGH]
L:  You haven't had a repeat call, I mean the same subject?
R:  No, I haven't, no.
L:  That's weird.  It's like -- maybe they didn't register that they got me. [LAUGH]
R:  I guess -- I guess not.  Did, um -- are you friends with mostly men, with mostly women, or do you have men friends, too?
L:  No, no, I have -- I'm actually -- I've got a lot of women friends but I also have, um -- I'm friends with most of my ex boyfriends. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, good. [LAUGH] Great.
L:  They're like some of my -- they're some of my best friends, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, again, um, I mean I -- my first boyfriend, after I got divorced.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, to this day he -- I -- if I was stranded at two in the morning he's who I would call.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I was --
