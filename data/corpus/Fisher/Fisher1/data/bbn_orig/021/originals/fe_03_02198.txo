L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, this is Genevieve.
R:  Hi, my name's Diana.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Not too bad.  How are you?
L:  I'm okay.  Um, well, uh, I like -- I prefer eating in restaurants, myself, as opposed to having to cook at home. [SIGH]
R:  Um, I prefer to cook at home, 'cause I -- I love cooking.
L:  Oh, that's good. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Though, once in a while in a restaurant is not too bad --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- as a special treat, but I do prefer at home, 'cause I always know what goes into the dish.
L:  Mhm.  That's true.
R:  Yeah.  Are you in the states?
L:  I'm in New York City.
R:  Oh, you're in New York City.  Oh, I'm in Montreal, Canada.
L:  Oh, okay, wow. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So [several inaudible words].
L:  Well, see here, I guess if -- when you're in -- well, in New York City, it's always so much of a choice.  And so many different -- different um, kinds of --
R:  Well, that's what I was going to say, the restaurants are really great in New York City.
L:  Yeah, I mean there's -- yeah, and they're always open very late too, which is another thing, and in New York, one of the -- the things that you kinda lose when you get apartments, is kitchen space.  So for me --
R:  Yes. [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't really have a -- I -- I like to cook, myself -- actually I love to, but I don't really have the room to do it.  Or the very best refrigerator at that, so it's kinda hard.  So I really -- if -- when I look at it that way, I do prefer to go out.  It's easier to have somebody clean up and it's just easier than having to make a mess in a tiny kitchen where there's really no place to move around, you know.
R:  I would probably feel the same way as you.  I'd like to go out more if my kitchen was small.
L:  Right.
R:  I would [inaudible] 'cause I like to cook but I lot -- I like a lot of space --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to cook, and ah, keep it -- [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I think, I -- you know, sometimes I see beautiful kitchens inside these magazines, you know, with the --
R:  Yeah.  'Spec- --
L:  -- the islands to cook -- cut up your food, sub zero fridge, the stainless steel -- you know, like, ovens --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think, "Wow, if I had that, I'd love to stay home and cook, too".  I mean it would be great.  But, uh, you know, unfortunately, [LAUGH] I have a tiny little counter space, ah, the fridge is not tiny, but it's not the biggest -- once you get inside, it doesn't go in deep, so you gotta be careful how much food you buy, 'cause you don't want the stuff to go bad, because you know, the door was open, or the freezer door was open, so --
R:  What are the --
L:  -- that's why --
R:  -- like, ah, in New York City, I guess, you guys have really good, ah, markets?
L:  Yeah, we do actually, we have um, ah, New ah, Gristiti's[?].  I don't know if you're aware of the Gristiti's chains?
R:  No.
L:  A big megastore just opened up a couple of blocks from me and they have all different types of food.  They have a big bakery, fresh bread, seafood, um, a whole big cold cut area ... I mean, it's -- it's huge.  And we actually --
R:  Does it have pre prepared stuff?
L:  Hm?
R:  Do they have pre prepared stuff?  Like, if you -- if you didn't want to cook --
L:  You --
R:  -- but you wanted to pick up a meal.
L:  Yes.  You mean like the ones at -- yeah, they have like -- let's say you wanted to get um, they have a pre prepared, cooked ah, roast chickens, but they have the meals that also come with like, mashed potatoes and stuff, and vegetable sides, and all that.  And it's fresh.  It's not like a um [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Then they're [several inaudible words].
L:  It's not like a microwaveable, where it's frozen.
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  It's pre -- pre made, but it's still fresh and they keep it like, in a cool area. [NOISE]
R:  Oh right.
L:  And um, it's really good, though.  I mean, we -- we -- I've gotten some of their, um, meals there, like if I don't want to cook that night, I just want something quick, I was hungry, I just wanted to go home and just eat.  I picked up that type of stuff, and it's nice.  It's -- and it's good.  I've never had a complaint about it.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  But I d- -- I do agree with you say about um -- it's always good too, to know what you're actually cooking, 'cause sometimes you're not sure of some places cleanliness --
R:  Yeah, in restaurant -- especially if you're watching, like, what you're eating.  Like, with a special diet.  Like, if you have --
L:  I'm a vegetarian, myself.
R:  Oh, you're a vegetarian?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, so then the logistics of going out to eat is -- is probably -- that's it -- you'd want to know what's -- what it's prepared with, no?
L:  Yeah, well, a lot of times I will frequent like, a -- some Thai restaurants.  I usually um --
R:  Oh, Thai.  I love Thai food.
L:  Right, 'cause there's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a lot of those types of restaurants, they --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- they primarily have a -- a menu with vegetarian meals.  Where you can actually find out whatever's in it.  You can question everyone.  But I like restaurants like that.  That you can ask about what's this, what's that or that, indicated on the menu.  But this is vegetarian, I mean ... even -- I mean I normally go to restaurants that even more -- you know, they don't cook the food, with the meat, as some places will see.
R:  Are you ovolacto[?]?
L:  Hm?
R:  Are you an ovolacto, ah, vegetarian?  Are you t- -- have eggs and ah, milk?
L:  N- -- um, no I don't eat eggs.  I do eat dairy.  I used to be a vegan, but I had a baby, um, in November. And when I --
R:  Oh, you did?
L:  -- became pregnant -- yes.  When I became preg- --
R:  Oh, what's it like for a -- did you breastfeed?
L:  Yes, I did actually, for the first couple of months.  But it became very hard, because I wasn't producing enough milk.  But I did it as long as I could.
R:  Oh, I had the same problem.
L:  Hm?
R:  I had the same problem.
L:  Yeah, really?  Yeah, I -- it was -- it --
R:  I toughed it about five months.
L:  Yeah, for me it was even -- it was shorter.  It was like, a couple of months and I tried getting help, but um, you know, it would -- I kept getting well, you know, "Maybe they're not latching on right", and blah, blah, bl- -- 
R:  Yeah, same here.
L:  -- you know the same old -- same old stories, but I'd do it and I'd know I was feeling the crunch in my -- on my uterus.  I was -- I was knowing that the baby was sucking, but she would say, "Hungry, hungry, hungry" all the time.  So, I started supplementing with formula and completely switched over.  And I had to -- I started taking dairy again when I was pregnant, 'cause I knew it was very important.
R:  Mm.
L:  For the developing baby, so that's why I stopped being a vegan, 'cause it was just too strict while I was pregnant.  I didn't think it was -- it was good.  [LIPSMACK] So that's why I became just vegetarian.  Um, how does -- you have a child, then, yeah?
R:  Yeah, a year and a half.
L:  Wow. [LAUGH] Congratulations to you.
R:  And congratulations to you too. [LAUGH]
L:  Thank you. [LAUGH]
R:  So that means, yours is like November, ah, December, January, February, March, April -- so five months?
L:  Yeah!
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  She's about five and a half months now, 'cause she'll be six months on the eleventh of May.
R:  So, she's on solids?
L:  Hm?
R:  She's starting to eat solids?
L:  I just started introducing cereals to her --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and I'm going to introduce like, solid foods around -- when she turns six months.  Like, ah, eating broccoli and start some vegetables, and fruits.  [LIPSMACK] But, um, you know, it's -- it's going good with her and I guess the same -- I mean, who knows what she might like, when she get's a little older?  Probably -- see, I was thinking about -- as far as food's concerned for her -- making them fresh.  Um, getting the broccoli myself, and chopping it up and feeding it to her.  Um, and see how that works too, because I -- I have a little mixer here in the house where I can chop it up and mix it and make it, you know, mushy so they can eat it.
R:  Oh, the best thing's a hand held.  You know the --
L:  Hand held --
R:  -- hand held mixers like a -- um, I think, um, Moulinex has one.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's the best.  'Cause I made all my -- ah, my own ah -- I used um, [LIPSMACK] what do you call it in English, it's -- organic?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, and I fed him only organic vegetables.  So I --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- prepared everything myself.  Um, it's the best.
L:  That's great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If you're -- if you're looking -- and you use a hand held ah, mixer --
L:  Mhm.
R:  A hop, skip and a jump and it's done.
L:  Yeah, and -- and I know that too.  It's another thing.  It's also economic, too.
R:  Oh, yeah, exactly.  But you also --
L:  You buy --
R:  -- the same thing, you know what they're getting.  Because if you --
L:  Exa- --
R:  -- [inaudible] the ingredients.
L:  Right.
R:  On the --
L:  And there's all kind of preservatives and stuff in there.
R:  Yeah, and you just freeze it.  You put it in wi- -- ice cube trays. [MN]
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, yeah, it's -- it [several inaudible words].
L:  Well, that's a good idea.
R:  Oh, no.  Great.  You just stick in a couple -- they usually eat one or two --
L:  That's a really good idea.
R:  -- veggies.  Yeah, and then you can start mixing like, peas and carrots and stuff like that.
L:  Right.
R:  But ah, no, it's -- it's the best.  You'll see.  Try it.
L:  Yeah, that -- no, definitely, I will.  That's great.  Thanks for [LAUGH] the information.  I was --
R:  I know p- -- [LAUGH] no problem!
L:  I always take um, any kind of information, I want -- and any advice that you give me, 'cause I'm -- new to this, you know, and I'm [inaudible] baby, but I mean I love it --
R:  Right.
L:  But it -- it can --
R:  Same here, it's like --
L:  -- it's overwhelming.
R:  Yeah.  No, and sometime it's nice to have like, ah, feedback from other moms.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And ah --
L:  That is great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, babies on line, if you ever go on the internet, they have a great forum, where you can talk.  All different types of forums.
R:  Well, we're having one around here -- like, a -- a French one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause it's also -- 'cause the problem with the ones in the States -- like I ha- -- I ah -- I go on the parents pages and stuff like that, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, to get information, ah, it doesn't apply to us Canadians.
L:  Oh, that's true.
R:  There's a lot of stuff like coupons, and stuff like that --
L:  Right.
R:  It's all sold in the US.  And there's a lot of cool stuff that you guys have, I can't get here.
L:  Right.  Because it -- like, contests and stuff.  Because i- if you win a prize, they don't send -- send it overseas, or whatever.
R:  No, that's it, and ah --
L:  Or they don't send it um, if they consider another crun- -- country, they don't want to pay the shipping and handling prices and --
R:  Yeah, the international fees and stuff like that.
L:  Right.
R:  But it's even just accessing -- getting stuff, like ah, at the stores.  Like, you know, you see something, "Oh, that's interesting", ah, but I can't -- I can't go -- well, th- -- though far from the States, I'm like, fifteen, twenty minutes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I could cross over.  But with the -- the borders and stuff like that, it --
L:  Right.  Red tape, basically.
R:  Yeah, it's a little bit more complicated.
L:  Well, hm, have you taken um, your son to a restaurant yet?
R:  Ah, yep.
L:  Yeah.  I took my daughter --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and [LAUGH] I had gotten a little bit of um, [LIPSMACK] what do you call it, the, ah [SIGH] the -- the fruit -- it's not ice cream, it's a sorbet.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And um, I was giving her little bits on her mouth and she was just -- loved it.  And she was freaking out.  It was like, one of the first restaurants I took her to, and -- it's just a problem sometimes, when you go to some of the restaurants that don't have like -- they're not baby friendly.  They don't have um [LIPSMACK] --
R:  No, the ones I've taken him to --
L:  -- diaper changing and --
R:  Yeah, the ones I've taken him to are -- are, ah, kid friendly.
L:  Right.
R:  Like we have a -- a few restaurants who have like a -- a separate little room, where there is a -- a video that plays.
L:  Mhm, oh that's great.
R:  And they have all types of toys and stuff, so when you're eating dinner like, you're near the room and it's all glass, so you can see him.  So --
L:  Oh.  That's great.
R:  Oh, it's -- yeah, it's really great.  If you can find like, a couple of restaurants like that?
L:  Uh-huh, that's really cool.  What's the name of that one?
R:  Ah, it's here in Quebec.  It's ah, Saint Hubert.
L:  Saint Hubert?
R:  It's like a chick- -- it's ah, yeah.  It's like, a chicken place.
L:  Well, I always find that there's a lot of good things in other places besides New York.  Uh, you know, a lot of times it's -- they only have such great restaurants, which they do.  But they don't have -- always have those options, though.  Those added options, like if you have children, or anything like that.
R:  Yeah, New York's probably not big on kid friendly restaurants, because it's more of an adult ah, ah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to the city.
L:  And then
