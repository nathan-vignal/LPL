L:  Natalie.
R:  Hi.  This is Suzie.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you?
L:  Good. [LAUGH] How are you?
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, pretty good.  So, I guess the topic is about --
L:  Friends.
R:  -- ah, friends.
L:  Yep. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I'm in Seattle.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And where are you?
L:  [MN] Um, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, I always wanted to go to Seattle. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, it's beautiful out here --
L:  I know, that's what I hear.
R:  -- but I shouldn't tell you that because too many people are moving out here. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I- everybody wan- likes it out there, I've heard.
R:  Yes, yes, it's really nice.  [NOISE] It's --
L:  It's a pretty city.
R:  It's very pretty and you're right on the water and the mountains are not that far --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- away.  It's just a really good mix.
L:  Yeah, it's neat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I'll --
R:  So, um, we're supposed to talk about the different friends that we have?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think that she was asking, um, are we the type of person to have a lot of friends, just a few close friends?  Um, what about you?
L:  [MN] Well, I just have a few close friends.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because, um, right now I just got out of college.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] most of my friends they moved out of the area to find jobs.
R:  Mm.
L:  And so, it's been really hard to meet people.  I'm -- I -- Pittsburgh is just not -- [MN] It's hard to meet -- there's not a l- lot of younger people here.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.  It's just most of the young people leave because they just have a negative, um, [LIPSMACK] I guess there's -- th- there's a, you know, a negative com- there's negative comments and negative -- all these bad things being said about Pittsburgh.  So, when kids go here -- they leave.
R:  Oh really.  I -- [NOISE]
L:  I -- I've lived here all my life, but, um, I do have a couple of friends.  My -- my best -- I have one goo- really good friend.  She -- we go to like a -- we work out three times a week.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We go to, um, Bally's Health Club.
R:  Oh okay, yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Do you have Bally's?
R:  We do have them out here, yeah.
L:  W- w- well, I took her [MN] -- she's older than me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  She's forty and I'm twenty f- twenty six.  She's forty two.  So -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I have friends that are older than me.  I have a couple of close friends.  I don't have a whole bunch of friends.  But I have -- like, I have her and I have a couple of other friends from -- from where I work at.
R:  Mhm, okay.
L:  But ...
R:  A- and where do you work?
L:  I work at, um -- I'm a temporary at ALCOA.  Did you ever hear of ALCOA?
R:  ALCOA ...
L:  The Aluminum Company of America? [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, okay, that's --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- what it stands for.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  All I could think of was, "ALCOA can't wait for tomorrow", that little ditty that -- that I hear on the radio.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  There used to be a song that I used to hear in their advertising.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  And that's all I could think of, but I couldn't remember what they actually do and what ALCOA do.
L:  Well, they -- they -- they manufacture, like, a lot of products.  They do like Reynolds Wrap too, like Reynolds, like, um, aluminum foil, they do that.
R:  [MN] Oh, okay.
L:  Reynolds and different things.  I'm a temporary there.  I've been there for [LIPSMACK] seven months now.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But they don't -- they don't want to hire anybody, because well [LIPSMACK] -- I guess because of the economy and their stock's dropped and the company -- I guess just because of the -- mainly the economy --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because it's not doing that good.
R:  Right.
L:  But, I've been -- I've been hoping that I get something pretty soon. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Because it's --
R:  Yeah, you know, the -- the economy is just in the toilet right now.
L:  That's horrible, I mean, I've been trying for -- for, um, oh, so long.  I graduated from school in two thousand and one and I've been trying [SIGH] so --
R:  Mm. [NOISE]
L:  -- so many times to find a permanent job and it's so hard.
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I- it's true, there are -- are hardly any jobs out there. [MN]
L:  I know.  
R: 'Cause --
L:  I have this temp job.  I'm -- I'm happy to have it, it's better than nothing.
R:  Mm. [LIPSMACK]
L:  That's they way I figure -- it's better than --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- better than nothing right now and ... [LIPSMACK]
R:  Mhm.
L:  You're so easy to talk to.  I had this guy yesterday from -- I don't what the heck, he was from a different country and I could not get in a word in edgewise. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh no. [LAUGH]  So you heard all about his opinion on the topic. [LAUGH]
L:  We didn't even get to the topic.
R:  Oh, no. [LAUGH]
L:  I told him -- I +said, "We didn't get to the topic".
R:  Oh, boy.  Well, I guess I should stay on -- on track.  I guess I should say that --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- um, I would say I have quite a few friends.  And I think a lot of people -- i- it's interesting to hear your perspective about people moving out of the Pittsburgh area --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because around here -- I was born right in this area, I have lived here my entire life, I have -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm still in contact with the girl I grew up next door to -- we've been --
L:  Really?
R:  -- friends for thirty five years now.  And I have several long time friends, sixteen, seventeen years.  Um, but it seems that people, at least the people I know, don't move out of this area.
L:  Really.  They stay?
R:  Yeah, they stay.  And I went through, you know, school with all the same people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and went to the University of Washington, and I still stay in contact with people I've known my whole life.  And then I'm continuing to make new friends, because we have a three year old, so that always opens up --
L:  Ooh. [LAUGH]
R:  -- a lot of opportunities to meet other parents and other moms.
L:  [MN]
R:  Especially being a stay at home mom --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I have a lot of time to go to the park and do lots of stuff with her, so we meet a lot of other stay at home moms.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I would say I have, um -- it's kinda hard really to -- to keep up with everybody, and that's why Mark, my husband, and I were talking the other night saying, "We should have a big party and have everybody here [NOISE] because --"
L:  Yeah, for the summer.
R:  -- we -- yeah, exactly because it's really starting to get nice outside.  That way, we could see at least everybody --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all in one place.  Because, if we just pick one couple a weekend, then we are going to see people maybe twice over the course of the whole summer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, yeah, I guess I -- I -- I feel fortunate to live in this area even though --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the economy is so bad right now.  Especially in the Seattle area.
L:  Really?  Seattle has been bad?
R:  [NOISE] [MN] Yeah, be- [NOISE] oh, people are -- there's a lot of dotcom companies that were out here.
L:  I know -- I kn-
R:  [MN]
L:  I -- I actually know somebody that works at Microsoft.
R:  Oh yeah?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]  My mum's --
R:  There's a billion of them out here.
L:  Yeah, my best friend -- my mom's best friend's son works there, he moved out there and he loves it.
R:  Oh, okay. [NOISE]
L:  But, I know -- I know like all the dotcoms went out of business.  I think that's what hurt me, because I was in computers.
R:  Oh, were you?
L:  An- I'm in computers, that's what I went to school for.
R:  Oh, what is your degree in?
L:  Information science.
R:  Oh, good for you.
L:  Like MIS, Management Information Science.  I went to Robert Morris College, it's in Pittsburgh, but they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- changed it into -- they're a University now.
R:  Oh, okay. [NOISE]
L:  The Robert Uni- Morris University, and I went there.  Um, it's just been hard for a lot of people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like I went to school with a couple of -- a lot of them they moved, and it's still bad.  I mean, in different areas.  I didn't -- I didn't know Seattle -- I guess everybody is doing bad. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh yeah.  Seattle is one of --
L:  Because of the war.
R:  The war, the economy, it -- it -- Seattle has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country.
L:  Really.
R:  Yeah, because there's so many --
L:  I think it's because of those dotcoms. [LAUGH]
R:  I now, it is, because there were so -- there's a lot of very wealthy people out here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And there's a lot of dotcom companies.  A lot of people have computer science or computer information or information system --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- degrees and so, so many people were laid off when the dotcoms went under, including several of my friends, and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- some of them are still unemployed and cannot get a job in the computer industry because they're n- nobody's hiring.
L:  No, they're not.  I have a contract job.  I have a temporary job, I mean -- and I'm not even doing computer work, I'm doing accounting.
R:  Okay.
L:  Accounting.  I'm doing accounts payable work.  It's -- it's, um, basically just using -- it's data entry, it's like using Oracle and it's better than nothing. [LAUGH]
R:  That's true, yeah.
L:  'Cause --
R:  I'm glad that you have a job.
L:  'Cause -- yeah, I'm happy to have a job.  I mean I have unemployment, but here they make you go to work.  I mean, if you're on unemployment you'll get a job.  If they see that you're on unemployment --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you'll get calls from people offering you a job.  And it might pay less than you made, but you have to take it.
R:  Ah. [NOISE]
L:  And if it was the same kind of thing that you did, like using a computer --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  As long as it is using a computer you have to take [LAUGH] it.
R:  How amazing. [NOISE]
L:  They have dumb rules here, and I pay -- I just took it because maybe I -- maybe I may get something permanent.
R:  [MN]
L:  One day I might get like a permanent position --
R:  Right.
L:  -- with good benefits.  Because ALCOA actually gives really good benefits.  They pay for your whole health insurance.  They pay like -- you don't have to contribute anything towards like --
R:  [NOISE] [MN]
L:  -- anything. [LAUGH]
R:  Really, that's great. [NOISE]
L:  And if you want to go back to school they'll pay, they'll -- they'll foot the bill, like the whole thing.
R:  No kidding. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, and I do --
R:  Boy, those benefits are worth a lot.
L:  Yeah.  And that's -- I guess, that's maybe why they don't want to hire [LAUGH] anybody.
R:  Ah.
L:  Because there -- we -- there's a lot of temporary people there, and we're just all frustrated because they won't hire us.
R:  So, you're like a -- like an, um, independent contractor, or just a temporary employee? [NOISE]
L:  No, I work for a -- no, I work for a temporary agency.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  I work for +Ajilon -- +Ajilon, they're called +Ajilon.  I don't know if they -- they have an office by you.
R:  No. [NOISE]
L:  They're like Adecco, but they're a division of them.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  They're national, they're all over -- ov- all over the country, I think.  But I signed up with them because -- I signed up with them like a long time ago.  And I guess they saw I was on unemployment, so they called me. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  So ...
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  It seems -- I don't know why, Pennsylvania just -- I guess they don't want a lot of people on unemployment --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I found out.
