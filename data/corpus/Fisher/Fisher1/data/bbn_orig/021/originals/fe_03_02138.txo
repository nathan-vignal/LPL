L:  [SIGH] Hello, this is Rachel.
R:  Hi, Rachel, I'm Olga.
L:  Hi, Olga. [NOISE]
R:  How are you?
L:  Good. [SIGH]
R:  Good.
L:  So do you like eating in a restaurant --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or do you like eating at home?
R:  Um, [NOISE] I like both.  I mean, I think eating --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- at a restaurant is easier, 'cause you just kinda go and sit and they [LAUGH] bring you food.
L:  Yeah.  I will eat anywhere where I don't have to cook it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  [SIGH] But I like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cooking too.  I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's fun like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as an activity and stuff. --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] But it's definitely much [NOISE] more [NOISE] of a production.
L:  Oh. [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Well, I -- I don't mind cooking, it's the cleaning I don't p- particularly --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- care for.
R:  [NOISE] It's the cleaning --
L:  You know.
R:  -- [NOISE] and all the m- -- yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] And then you gotta do the dishes and you --
R:  And [NOISE] the dishes. [NOISE]
L:  -- gotta clean the table and blah, blah, blah. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  So it's definitely nicer to go -- just to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- go to a restaurant --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] and not a fast food restaurant but, you know --
R:  N- no, but nice.
L:  -- one where you can sit down --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and just order your meal and have them bring it to you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Um ...
R:  And [NOISE] have a glass of wine with it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, you know, we've got two small ones here so it's not too often that we actually [SIGH] could have a glass of wine.  And it's not too often that we have a quiet meal with just, ah, [SIGH] my husband and myself; we usually have to bring the kids with us.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  So a perfect meal --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- would probably have to be, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- one without the kids, where we could, you know, actually hear ourselves talk and --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- not, ah, [SIGH] not be yelling at -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- back and forth, "Sit down.  Don't touch that.  Use your fork". [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Get back in your chair." [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That kinda thing.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  But, um ...
R:  [MN]
L:  [MN] We do go out to eat [NOISE] a couple of nights a week, um, [NOISE] because I really just [NOISE] d- d-
R:  Well, I can imagine with the kids you don't have much time left for cooking [LAUGH] --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  -- and all that.
L:  Yeah.  I mean e- well, even if I do cook then, [SIGH] you know, there's a whole +another hour's worth of cleaning that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is involved, you know.  So, [SIGH] --
R:  Yes.
L:  It definitely is easier if we can, um, go out.  So, I mean, sometimes we will go out to a restaurant where we can actually sit down and sometimes it's just, you know, sandwiches somewhere. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um ...  But, ah ...
R:  But it is definitely easier.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We definitely, ah, definitely like to go out to eat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] And, ah, especially in the weekends.  Um, [SIGH] [MN] you know, in the weekends I really don't like to do much of anything. [SIGH]
R:  [MN] No. [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
L:  And, ah ... [SIGH]
R:  It's, ah, [LAUGH] interesting.
L:  So if I c- -- if I can get away without cooking I will. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um ...
R:  Yeah.  Cooking is nice when you have like lots of time [NOISE] and you can [SIGH] get in- involved in it, and you can do, [NOISE] you know, a little --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- bit of experimenting and --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] -- and stuff like that.  But, yeah, when you don't have [NOISE] time, it's just not fun. [SIGH]
L:  Well, it's a chore.  I mean, you know, I -- I -- and I don't know that my husband actually sees it that way. [SIGH]  I mean, you know, he -- he --
R:  No.  He thinks it just magically appears. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  You know, "What are we having for dinner?"  "Well, [LAUGH] --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- ah, you know, it's three o'clock, I don't know, I haven't had a chance to think --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- about it" you know.  [SIGH] I mean he doesn't realise that, you know, it actually takes [SIGH] almost all day to get a meal on the table at dinner.
R:  It does, yeah, it does take all day.
L:  You know, especially when you have two kids because you have to -- first in the morning you have to decide what you're gonna have. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  And then you have to shop.
L:  And then you've got to figure out the -- ah, yeah.  And then, well, if you don't -- even if you don't have to shop.  If you have to take something out of the freezer then you've got to wait for it to thaw and all that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] But then you [SIGH] y- 
R:  [SIGH] Oh, and then trying to like plan a full meal.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That always befuddles me.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  'Cause I can make one thing.  I mean I can, like, put something together and I can spend a couple of hours doing that and that's fun. [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  But there's always got to be side dishes.
R:  But trying to plan like a main course and side dishes and [SIGH] like soup or salad and then dessert.  And I'm like, oh my God, wh- you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- need like a week to just [LAUGH] do all that. [SIGH]
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, my husband just thinks -- you know, I don't know whether he thinks it's just like a- a little -- a few minutes to get something on the table.  I don't think he realizes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that it-- it --
R:  You think you just turn the oven on and throw it in. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That it literally takes all day --
R:  [SIGH]  It does.
L:  -- you know, to do something.
R:  It does.
L:  And -- and he'll say to me, "Well, you know, it's not like you have to stand over the stove and stir it for three hours".
R:  And you're like, "Yes I --"
L:  No.  But you -- no, but you have to be --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- close by.
R:  And you do.
L:  I mean --
R:  It's like you literally d- -- you can't walk away from it, because the minute you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- walk away from it it'll burn.
L:  It'll burn, it'll boil over.
R:  [MN]
L:  It'll -- you know --
R:  All of that.
L:  -- s- something.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  So you -- you've gotta be pretty handy and you really can't be involved in anything else.
R:  No.  It's --
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  So, you're -- you're cooking and you're cleaning and you're chopping and you're --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, doing all this stuff.
R:  Mhm.  And you're pretty much trapped in the kitchen for all those hours.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You can't like --
L:  And it's very difficult.
R:  -- can't like go off somewhere.
L:  Very difficult when you have two small ones because they command --
R:  How -- [NOISE]
L:  -- so much attention. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah, absolutely. [NOISE]
L:  You know, so ...
R:  How old are you kids?
L:  Um, [NOISE] um, I have a three year old and a five year old.
R:  Oh my God, yeah.  That's like constant attention.
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] so, y-
R:  You can't leave them [LAUGH] alone.
L:  Yeah, so definitely --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, a restaurant. [NOISE]  No one has to ask me twice, you know.
R:  Yeah, it's much easier.
L:  I mean -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So it's not too often that, ah, I -- I s- -- I can't remember ever saying, "No, let's stay home, I wanna cook".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't, ah ... [SIGH]
R:  No.  I -- [LAUGH] I think cooking is like for people who don't -- who have lots of time and don't really have --
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] See my husband's --
R:  -- you know, much else going on.
L:   -- m- -- see my husb- m- -- see, I spoilt him.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Because when we first got married --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I mean, I had an older daughter -- I have an older daughter, but she's -- you know, [NOISE] she's gonna be seventeen.
R:  Mm.  So, she's on her own.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] So --
R:  Kind of doing her own thing.
L:  -- I mean I -- you know, I don't cook for her and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, when [SIGH] -- when my husband and first got married she was already nine or ten.  So, it's not like I had to spend every minute with her. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, see that's fine.
L:  So I could literally spend all day cooking a meal.
R:  [NOISE] Sure.
L:  So he came home every night and there was a -- you know, nice meal on the table.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  And then we have two little ones come along and he doesn't understand why --
R:  That changes everything.
L:  -- I can't get that dinner on the table anymore.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  You tell him get you a nanny and then you'll cook. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it's funny because he just said to me, "What are we having for dinner?"
R:  Mhm.
L:  I said we're having h- hamburgers and hot dogs on the grill. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Okay. [LAUGH] 'Cause I thought ahead [NOISE] and took the hamburgers out of the freezer.  That's why we're having that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, 'cause this way, ah, there's no planning, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean I'll open up [NOISE]-- actually I -- I, you know, have some like [NOISE] frozen vegetables.  You know.  And what I do is I get f- frozen vegetables and I either cut them up myself or I'll get them, you know, already mixed or whatever.  [SIGH] And I'll put them in tinfoil pans with tinfoil covers.
R:  Oh, and then they can go on the grill.
L:  I can throw them right on the grill. [MN]
R:  Yeah, that's perfect.
L:  And then there's no cleanup, there's no -- you know, I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I'll throw some spices on them and throw some butter in it and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just toss 'em right on the grill, even though they're frozen.
R:  Yeah, no, that's great.
L:  [SIGH] You know, because they only take a couple of minutes.
R:  Yeah.  They're quick.
L:  And that's it, you know.  So then I can get a decent meal on the table.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  But summer is definitely--
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --the better time [NOISE] to get a meal on the table.
R:  Well, yeah, 'cause you can use your outside. [LAUGH]
L:  C- well, yeah.  'Cause you can use your grill you don't have to cleanup [SIGH] afterwards.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean we still ha- we still use dishes.  I mean we don't use paper plates or anything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] But -- but at least you don't have pots and pans and all of that.  [SIGH] And at least --
R:  Well, that's what takes the most time.
L:  Right:
R:  I mean the plates and the silverware [NOISE] doesn't take that much time to clean up.
L:  Yes.  And if the kids are outside they don't command as much attention from you --
R:  Well it's easier --
L:  -- if they're outside.
R:  -- to keep an eye on them too.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause they're -- they're in their sandbox.  It's not like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they need you to help them with the video game or turn the computer on, or [SIGH] change the video in -- in -- on the TV.
R:  Yeah, and it's not you've got to constantly come --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in from another room to watch [NOISE] them.
L:  Yes.  I mean, if they're out- yes, if they're outside riding their bike in the driveway you don't [NOISE] need to be on them every second.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they're not coming to see you every five seconds, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, because we have an enclosed yard so they can ride their bikes, they can play on the swing.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  You know, they can play in -- in the sand, you know.  And they do, ah, you know, they've got a trampoline, we -- you know in the summer we've got a pool, and of course then I'll have to watch them.  But, [SIGH] I mean, normally I don't have to be on them every five seconds, so I can get a meal on the table.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] And thank God with the grill you can get a decent meal on the table with a -- a meat and a couple of side dishes.  [SIGH] You know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, in the winter when everybody is stuck in the house ...
R:  Yeah.  Then that's [LAUGH] definitely more --
L:  There's just --
R:  -- comp- well everything just takes longer in the winter --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- too.  [NOISE] Because [NOISE] just to go [NOISE] to the store's like a huge production.
L:  Oh, please, yes.  It's just -- well, when you have --
R:  You can't just put everybody in the car and run out.  You have to bun- bundle up and then driving is a big deal, and ... [NOISE]
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  My husband doesn't realise that to go grocery shopping with the two little ones --
R:  Oh, God.
L:  -- takes me, you know, an hour and a half.
R:  Oh, at least.
L:  If I'm going to go alone I'll be back in twenty minutes. [NOISE]
R:  Sure. [NOISE]
L:  You know.  I mean, [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- big deal.  And he doesn't -- he -- you know he just -- he just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- doesn't grasp it.
R:  No.  No.
L:  And ... [LAUGH]
R:  Well because he doesn't do it. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You just let him do it for a week he'll -- he'll [NOISE] know what's going on. [LAUGH]
L:  But see, even -- even then he doesn't, because when men do it, it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Men don't take care of their children, they babysit [SIGH].
R:  Oh.
L:  You know.  So, I mean, they're not doing the laundry --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they're not doing the house cleaning.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They're watching the kids.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  That's all they're doing.
R:  Yeah.  No, that's not the same thing.
L:  See they don't have to do everything that goes with it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] See?
R:  No.  You gotta make 'em --
L:  So I -- I mean, I went away when I -- I went away for three or four days.  You know, I come back, yeah, the kids are taken care of.  But --
R:  But your house isn't [LAUGH] --
L:  Nobody did the laundry.  Nobody washed the floor.  Nobody, you know, vacuumed.
R:  [SIGH] Ooh, that's it.
L:  You know, I mean, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, it's not like -- you know, so they can't understand, you know, why it -- you know, why is it so difficult to get a meal on the table?
R:  Mm.  Well, yeah.
L:  You know, well [MN] because I've got twelve things going at once, okay?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  An- and they're thinking, "Well, I can watch the kids [NOISE] I could certainly throw a meal on the table".  No, you can't.
R:  Well, you try to do both [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  No, you can't.
R:  -- and see what happens.
L:  You're gonna go to Burger King, is what you're gonna do.  You know.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Or you're gonna take something out of the freezer that I put in and you're gonna toss it in the microwave, you know.
R:  [SIGH] Sure.
L:  Or you're gonna make sandwiches, you're not gonna cook a meal, you know.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean, yesterday he cooked a- a- the one and only thing h- that he can cook, [SIGH] which is a bean soup. [SIGH] and, you know, he cook it -- he cooks it in a crock pot.
R:  Mhm.
