L:  Hi, my name is Jessica.
R:  [PAUSE] Hello?
L:  Hello?  Can --
R:  Yeah.  Hey, hey.
L:  Can you hear me?
R:  Yeah, I can hear you.
L:  Hi, I'm Jessica.
R:  Hi, I'm Vicki Leatherman.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm good.
L:  So, I guess we're discussing food. [LAUGH]
R:  I guess so.  This is the first time I've done this, so I'm not re- --
L:  Me too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I don't -- okay, well, good.  I guess we're -- [SIGH] they only start counting though, once we talk about food. [LAUGH]
R:  So what do we do?  We just talk to each other about food?
L:  Yeah.  Did they give you, um -- did they give you a question?
R:  Well, it just said, um, "Do I like eating at home or would I rather, um ...?"
L:  Right.  That's what they said -- well, I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it depends.  I -- I enjoy going out --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I hate going out --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if I have to spend money on something that turns out to be unenjoyable. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but -- yeah, normally it's nice to have someone else cook, and -- and wait on me.  But I also -- sometimes I enjoy -- if I ha- -- like if I have friends over, then I don't mind eating in and cooking at home.
R:  Yeah.  We've always ah, we've -- we used to go out a lot to eat.  A lot.  And now, we just pretty much stay at home.  We moved out of town, and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- now we just stay at home and eat and it seems so much cheaper --
L:  It is.
R:  -- to do it at home.
L:  It's amazing how much it -- it adds up if, when you go out ...  Do you live in a m- -- a more rural area now?
R:  Well, it's probably pretty much the same.  It's just about a hundred --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- miles different from where I did live, but --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And it -- and it's a little different 'cause they don't have as many restaurants around here.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And um, I was -- I used to work at Ruby Tuesday's, so --
L:  Ah, I love that place.
R:  Yeah, oh they have, ah, the best food.
L:  Did you find when you were working in a restaurant -- did you eat -- like did you enjoy eating there, or did it kind of turn you off to it, being around the food all the time?
R:  It -- it kinda turned me off.  I didn't eat there very much.  I mean, even though we got a big discount, I didn't eat there very much.
L:  Right.
R:  It was kind of like going back to work, after you've left --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- kind of thing, so ... 
L:  Well, what -- do you have a favorite sort of food?
R:  Well, I mean, my favorite type of restaurant would be like, Olive Garden.  I really enjoy eating in Olive Garden.
L:  Like Italian, pasta kind --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of stuff.  Right.
R:  But I don't too much like Mexican.  Mexican is not me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I like Taco Bell.  Taco Bell's good, but Mexican ...
L:  [LAUGH] That's my brother's favorite place.  Even when he was really young and he wouldn't -- he was the pickiest eater, and he was very skinny.  He wouldn't eat much of anything, anyways.  But he would go [LAUGH] and he would get like, six soft shell Tacos and four of the regular ones ... 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He just loved that place.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know, I'm trying to think if there's anything I don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- particularly like to eat.  Um ... [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Spaghetti gets old fast.  It gets real old fast.
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  But -- ah, there's so much you can do with --
L:  That's what I was going to say, kinda change the sauce, and put different stuff in it.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Um ...
R:  I actually just made some Italian pasta.  It's pretty good.
L:  Oh, good.  Good for you.  Actu- -- yeah, well, after just talking about how expensive it gets to eat out, I have to admit I -- I picked up Chinese on the way home. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We -- here, this is the perfect example.  I had this kind of a bad day and so I was really looking forward to get -- just getting something nice to eat.  And it wa- -- it wasn't the way they usually make it.  So that -- I hate that feeling when I go out and I spend money on food, and then it, you know, it's not good, and so that was -- that's my example for today.
R:  Yeah, I hate that too.  That -- that's not very much fun to eat it, and pay for it and it not be enjoyable.
L:  Exactly. [SIGH]  Hm.  Well [LAUGH] this is -- I wonder if they're going to tell us if we've done ten minutes --
R:  Yeah, if we passed, or whatever.  That's a --
L:  Or we're going to be talking and talking.  How 'bout -- well, do you eat breakfast?  Are you a breakfast person?
R:  [NOISE] Oh, I love breakfast. [NOISE]
L:  Really? [LIPSMACK]
R:  I love breakfast but I don't eat breakfast as much.  It seems like I get up so late.
L:  Yeah.  See that's me t- -- I always loved breakfast and I noticed like, as I went through college and I started eating it less and now I just -- I never make the time for it.  But it's my favorite group of foods.  I mean, I love all the breakfast foods.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Eggs and cheese put on top of eggs, and --
L:  I kn- -- [LAUGH] exactly.  Cheese is always good.
R:  I sometimes make like, um, [LIPSMACK] a breakfast dinner.  You know?  That's fun.
L:  Yeah, that -- this is so funny that you mention that because literally two days ago, I, um -- 'cause I -- usually I don't do that, but I did have omelets for dinner.  It was really nice.
R:  Did you make 'em yourself?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  What do you put inside of it?
L:  I put -- in this one, I put feta cheese and tomato.
R:  Oh, that sounds good.
L:  It was really good.  Yeah, I don't usually -- usually just do the regular old American cheese, but I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- had some feta cheese.  It was really nice.  You should try it.
R:  That sounds really good.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm not crazy about tomatoes but -- [LAUGH]
L:  Really?  Oh I love tomatoes.  Well then what do you put on your -- what do you put on your spaghetti sauce?
R:  Well, I just put just regular spaghetti sauce.  I don't add any -- I don't get the like, stewed tomatoes --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and make it myself.  I just get regular spaghetti sauce and --
L:  It's like a tomato taste you don't like?
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- no, I like that.  I just don't like the whole tomato deal.
L:  Gotcha. [LIPSMACK]
R:  Whole tomatoes aren't very good.  It's the seeds and all that gooey in the middle. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, sure.  Ca- -- it's kind of a pain when you cook with them and you have to get all that stuff out.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Hm.
R:  But I pretty much like everything else, other than tomatoes. [NOISE] Tomatoes are just not very good for me.
L:  Yeah.  They're -- they're -- I -- I love vegetables.  I think --
R:  Mm.  I do too, like cabbage and lima beans and things like that.
L:  Do you?
R:  I --
L:  I love lima beans.
R:  Oh.
L:  I real- --
R:  Lima beans are so good.
L:  Lima beans and brussel spr- -- do you like brussel sprouts?
R:  Oh, yeah.  So good.
L:  Me too.  Well.
R:  Oh, it's delicious.  My mother in law, she's actually on this Aitken's diet --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and um, we had um, Easter at her house and she -- she cooked like, all this hu- -- huge meal for everyone, and she couldn't eat any of it so she made her own little thing of stuff that she could eat, and she made, um, it's a mock potato cake which -- she made it with cauliflower --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it turned out to taste just like regular potato cakes that you would make, yet -- and it's really good.  And she just grounded up the cauliflower and --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- fried it in a pan and it was so good.
L:  That sounds really good.
R:  And I would have -- I mean I don't even care too much for cauliflower, 'cause it, to me, doesn't have that --
L:  Exactly, that's what I was thinking.
R:  -- it don't really have a taste to it, but goodness, that what she made was so good.
L:  Mm, that sounds good.
R:  I was thinking, "I might have to try some more of this stuff." [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so did she -- that must be hard then, making a whole meal and then not being able to eat any of it.
R:  Oh, it was really hard, very hard for her.  I felt kind of bad for her.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause she's a big potato eater, you know?
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, they're great.
R:  And that's, ah, against the rules.
L:  Yeah, is -- now the Aitken's diet.  Is that the one where you can't have carbohydrates?
R:  Yeah, you can have all the fat you want, but no carbohydrates.
L:  Okay.  Yeah.  Pretty much all I eat is carbohydrates. [LAUGH]
R:  That's pretty much all I eat, too. [NOISE]
L:  That would be hard.
R:  Pasta's and things like that, [NOISE] but ...
L:  Yeah, right
R:  I don't -- I couldn't do it.  I have another friend who's trying to do that diet now, and she can't even make it past -- 'cause she's a big potato eating person too.
L:  [LAUGH] Now, wh- --
R:  She wants everything.
L:  Oh.  I wonder ... I mean, I wonder how well they work.  It just seems like so much of it must depend on your, you know, you're own biology and --
R:  Yeah, I think so too.
L:  [MN]
R:  But, I don't know.  It -- she seems to lost a lot of weight on doing that so ...
L:  Really?
R:  I think it's just changing your eating habits.  Um, being able to change your eating habits, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like, um, even with ah, just eating the fat stuff --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then being able to go -- you know, just go to eating just directly fats and all that.  I don't really know. [SIGH] [NOISE]
L:  What is the one where you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on- -- you're only supposed to eat, or you're supposed to eat a lot of fat?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Isn't there one like that?
R:  [NOISE] Um.
L:  That you're supposed to -- a lot of fatty meat and stuff?
R:  I think that is the Aitken's diet.  Well that's the majority of what you eat is fat.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry that's right --
R:  [NOISE] Instead of -- [NOISE]
L:  -- and you cut out the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  That's okay. [NOISE] Yeah, you cut out all the carbohydrates so your body's not burning your carbohydrates, [NOISE] it's burning all the fat.
L:  Okay.
R:  So.  And that's really weird, [NOISE] 'cause ... I don't know how that works and how someone could come up with that.  Just by changing their eating [NOISE] habits and deciding that I'm going to eat all fat. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.
R:  But I could do that diet, because I love bacon.  I love --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- any type of meat.  I love meat.  Absolutely love meat, but there are things that -- like [NOISE] bread and things like that, I have to have, that just are full of carbohydrates.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN] But um, like, bacon.  I -- me and my little boy could eat a -- like a whole thing of bacon daily, you know?
L:  It's funny.  I actually about a year --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and a half ago --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- became a vegetarian.
R:  Really.
L:   'Cause -- but I -- I'm -- I used to love meat, and it's funny 'cause the things I crave the most -- it's bacon and sausage and all those like, really fragrant fried breakfast meats.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like that's -- oh, feel to this day, whenever I smell it.  It smells so good.
R:  What made you decide to be a vegetarian?
L:  Um, I guess there is -- there is a variety of reasons.  It was partly for health reasons, um, partly -- I initially -- I started just buying -- I was concerned about a lot of the pro- -- the stuff that was going into the meats.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I started just trying to buy free range and organic stuff and then, um, I eventually just cut it out completely.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  But, it's strange, your body r- -- really seems to adapt.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, I was thinking, back to -- when we were talking about those diets and sometimes it -- it seems like it would be so hard --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but it's -- after a while, if you give something up --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- your body just seems to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- adjust to it, like you don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- crave it as much anymore.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Except for bacon, of course. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  I never got over that. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, bacon is the best.
L:  Oh.  I heard -- was that your little boy in the background earlier?
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Yeah, he was coming in with a little girl -- gave him a dollar.  I was like, "Hold on, [NOISE] wait a minute". [SIGH]
L:  Okay.  What, he got a dollar?
R:  Some little girl gave him a dollar, down the road.
L:  Wow, lucky guy.
R:  He's a cutie pie. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, is he a picky eater?
R:  Oh, my goodness.  He is the pickiest eater in this world.  I --
L:  Really?
R:  -- I've never [NOISE] met anyone as picky as him.
L:  Oh.
R:  I mean --
L:  That's really hard for you.
R:  -- he doesn't eat hardly anything. [NOISE] He eats chicken nuggets, um, [NOISE] fish sticks, macaroni and cheese, ramans[?] and things like that, [NOISE] hot dogs, hamburgers and all the, [NOISE] you know, the pizza and things like that.
L:  Right.
