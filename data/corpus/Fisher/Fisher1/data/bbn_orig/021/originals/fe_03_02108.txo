R:  Hi, I'm Linda.
L:  Hi, Linda, it's Angela.
R:  Hi, I'm glad --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I got a female finally [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Are you the one I talked to earlier today?
R:  No.
L:  Okay, I talked to a Linda earlier today, also.
R:  Oh, did you?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  How funny.
R:  That is strange.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's a common name so --
L:  Yeah, that's pretty funny.
R:  Well, do you have a lot of friends or just a few close?
L:  Well, I have, um -- I guess I would say I have a lot of acquaintances and I have a few close friends and one best friend but --
R:  Yeah, I feel the same way.
L:  I've got a lot of people that, you know, I -- I could call friend but they're not somebody I would confide in or anything like that.  I've only got a handful of those.
R:  [COUGH] I think that's the best way to be [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  You don't want to spread yourself too thin.
L:  [LAUGH] That's very true.  That is very true.  We all did that as teenagers, it's time to grow up, right? [LAUGH]
R:  I would hope so at this stage in the game.
L:  How funny.  Yeah, I've actually got one best friend that's right next door.  We are together all the time and do all of our running round together and yard work together and all of that kind of stuff, so --
R:  Are you around the same age?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, she's a -- we're six years difference.
R:  Oh well, that's not bad.
L:  No.  We're --
R:  How long have you been best friends?
L:  Uh, about, let's see, probably four years.  We've been in the, uh -- we've been living next door to each other five and a half years and, um, we hooked up about a year after that.  Uh, we -- the first year -- we lived in -- live in a neighborhood that was newly built and so the first year was really, really busy for both of us getting organized and, you know, fixing our yards up and stuff like that, and about a year after that we started walking together and have been together ever since.
R:  Super.
L:  So -- and our husbands get along so it's easy for us to, you know, get together as groups and get -- and do things.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So --
R:  That makes it nice.
L:  Yeah, it does, it does.  So, do you have a best friend or ...?
R:  I have a best friend that I've had for almost twenty two years now.
L:  Wow, wow, that's great.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, uh, needless to say we're each other's confidante.
L:  Oh yeah, imagine.  You know, like, uh, we've been that way, too, quite a bit.  I mean, anytime one of us needs to talk we say, "Okay, it's time to walk" [LAUGH] even if we've already done it.
R:  Yeah and you can say anything.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  I trust her with anything that I had to say and vice versa so --
R:  Yeah, you don't have to worry about any repercussions.
L:  Exactly, exactly.  And even though, you know, we are friends as couples also, we can still, you know, go to each other and complain about our spouses without worrying about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That makes it real nice.
R:  Yeah, you've got to have somebody that you can sort of bounce things off of.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I feel, anyway.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You don't want to go round forever, you know, with things pent up.
L:  It --
R:  I have a --
L:  -- makes it a lot healthier. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well I have a room mate situation and I've known her for about fifteen years and, um, thank god she spends six months in Florida.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm actually renting a room in her house --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I get the whole house for six months.
L:  Wow.
R:  She's due back the fifteenth of May.
L:  Wow.
R:  With her three dogs and two cats.
L:  Yeah.
R:  To go along with my one dog, one cat and two prairie dogs so --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  But we --
L:  Y'all got a houseful of animals. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  And we're good friends but we're --
L:  Right.
R:  It's funny we can live under the same roof, um, for six months out of the year but we're not best friends.
L:  Right.
R:  We're not bosom buddies, you know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  It -- it's really strange.  I can't tell her everything.
L:  Right.
R:  I just don't feel comfortable doing that.
L:  Right.
R:  And we live together.
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  I did the same thing.  There was one girl that lived with me for a while right after I bought my first house and, um, we were better friends when we were not living together.  We did more things together when we weren't living together than when we were living together because we worked together and lived together and it -- I guess it just became where we were together too much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so we ended up kinda growing apart because of that and, um, you know it -- it seems to be easier to be able to walk away, at the same time, you know, have a best friend that you don't have to be around twenty four hours a day or whatever.
R:  Yeah, it's true. [MN]
L:  So --
R:  I do do more with her now that I, sort of, live with her.
L:  Mhm.
R:  When she's home.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, it's terrible.  I love to cook and show it and she hates to cook.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that works out good then, right?
R:  [COUGH] Well, in a way, except she likes to eat out.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I can't afford to eat out.
L:  Right.
R:  But that -- that's her thing.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, she still wants half the refrigerator.  She's now on Weight Watchers --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- and she's counting points.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So she says, "Remember, I'm coming home soon".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "So when you go shopping remember, half the freezer's mine and half the refrigerator's mine."
L:  How funny.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it does take a lot of space to do that Weight Watchers.
R:  [MN]
L:  'Cause I've done that.
R:  Oh!
L:  And it does.  If you want to stick to your points, you -- you've got to have the right foods and everything to do it.  It's hard to do it --
R:  Well, she takes up an entire shelf with nothing but water.
L:  Yeah.
R:  These flavored fruity two Os --
L:  Oh, she does --
R:  -- and H two Os.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I use plain tap water.  She's got a well out here.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  See, this is her house and that water is ice ice cold --
L:  I bet it's wonderful.
R:  -- even on the hottest days.
L:  Oh, how great.
R:  It is awesome.
L:  That's neat.
R:  But, uh, I said, "I take water right out of the tap" [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Yeah, see I do, too.  That's how I am.  I'd rather have it than flavored.
R:  I have to have it iced.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I -- I take bottles that used to have water in them --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and put 'em in the fridge, in the freezer.
L:  Right.  I came across a half gallon, um, bottle that looks like those big, um, bottles that sit on top of the container thing.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And it's a half gallon one and it has a little handle and that's what I carry my water in and so it doesn't take up a lot of space in the fridge
R:  Wow, that's three and half pounds.
L:  Huh?
R:  That's three and a half pounds.
L:  To ca- -- yeah, but I carry it, like, to work and put it on my desk --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- or carry it when I go, like -- I don't carry it, like, if I'm going shopping or anything but, like -- or I'll keep it in the car.
R:  I was picturing you running, doing your little walkies and --
L:  Oh, no, no, no, no.  No, not when we're walking or anything but, um, but like if I go to the park or anything like that, you know, that's what I carry it in so --
R:  Well, I take mine and put 'em in the freezer half filled with water and, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then when I'm ready to use them I take them out of the freezer and add the rest water.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they last a good long time.  I've got some insulating jackets for a couple of them but not for all of them.
L:  Yeah, that's a good idea for when you're walking and stuff.
R:  Yeah, and you can --
L:  Yeah.
R:  They've got them now that come with little, uh, carabiners on them so you can clip 'em right to your belt.  I said well you got to get at least two, so you're even. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So [LAUGH] so you're not lopsided while you're walking. [LAUGH] That'd be kind of difficult. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Specially if you tried to jog or anything. [LAUGH] Yeah --
R:  But, uh --
L:  My friend and I we take the dogs walking and we both have a -- I have a chow and she has a -- she's part -- I don't know, she's a mix but she's, um -- we go walking.  They're about the same size.
R:  I have an akita.
L:  Ah, what's that?  Is that a small dog?
R:  No.
L:  It's a big one?
R:  Yeah.  They're the national dog of Japan.  They're the largest.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  They have -- have three dogs, the shiba, the shiba inu and the akita.  The akita's the largest.
L:  Wow.
R:  They sort of look like [LIPSMACK] a mix between a husky and, um, a malamute type thing.
L:  Oh neat.
R:  They've got longish hair but not real real long.
L:  Right.
R:  In fact, it's the O.J. Simpson dog.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  If you remember ba- -- back that far.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, uh --
L:  How cute.
R:  And she has a lab that's, uh, into agility, obedience and, uh, tracking and --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- a miniature poodle which -- I hate little dogs, they drive me nuts  --
L:  [LAUGH] Specially their little bark.
R:  -- but I -- I'm in love with this one.
L:  How sweet.
R:  And then she has a mixed cocker --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- that doesn't do anything but sit. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow [LAUGH] how funny.
R:  And my dog doesn't get along with any of hers.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  No, she's an alpha bitch and she would attack any other dog.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  She's fine with the cats, just don't get her near another dog.
L:  How funny, how fun --
R:  So we play musical dogs when she's here.
L:  Yeah, I imagine.
R:  Some in the dog house and some in the kennel and some outside.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It -- it's fun.
L:  How interesting.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Y'all stay busy, don't you? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Forget about work or anything. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well that's wishful thinking.
L:  [LAUGH] Goodness.
R:  But I'm down to three days a week now.  I'm considering between retiring and disability.
L:  Oh, goodness.
R:  I was a teacher for twenty some years.
L:  Wow.
R:  And then I switched careers and I'm in the health field now and I do one on one.  I'm a C.R.M.A.
L:  Oh, neat.
R:  Which is a registered medical assistant. 
L:  How neat.
R:  I figured that -- that sort of followed suit being that I taught biology.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But, um --
L:  Well, did you enjoy teaching?
R:  I loved it.  It was a life's dream but when it got to the point where they wouldn't give me combat pay and we had to frisk 'em for guns and knives and shit --
L:  Right.
R:  Um, no thank you.
L:  Yeah, it is getting bad isn't it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Seems to get worse -- a little bit worse every year.
R:  And it breaks my heart 'cause I really, really, really loved it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, I -- I'm not going to -- I'm there to teach --
L:  Not worth putting your life at risk.
R:  -- not -- not chaperone and babysit.
L:  Right.
R:  And I don't have time to worry about whether they're going to pull a gun or a knife --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- on me or somebody else.
