R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Hi.
L:  Hello, hi.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Are you there?
R:  Yes. [NOISE]
L:  Wow, I've never done this before, I'm brand new.  My name's Mike.
R:  I'm Mark. [NOISE]
L:  Mark, I'm calling from Cleveland, Ohio.
R:  Oh, I'm in Boston. [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] In Boston, all right. [SIGH] So, ah, the question today is do we prefer eating at home or at -- or out?
R:  Right.
L:  And you know what?  I guess, ah [LAUGH] I -- t- the truth is I like both.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mea- -- I mean I don't know.  What do you -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  What do you? [LAUGH]  I go through times I -- I've eaten -- there have been times in my life when I've eaten out, ah, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot, I mean just like O- -- OD'd [NOISE] on it, es- es- especially when I was, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- single, before I got married. [SIGH]  And I just said, [NOISE] you know I just so -- I got so tired of it, you know.  But there's other times and I'm, ah -- work [NOISE] a lot and, ah, you know I'm to tired to fix anything, ah, and I would prefer --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- somebody to feed me, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH] I guess, ah -- [MN] I guess I'm the same way in some ways.  [SIGH] Um, I -- I like -- eating out can be, ah -- it can be a treat because there is no cleanup.  I, ah -- there is, ah, my wife and two kids in the family and so, [SIGH] um, going out means, ah, no preparation, no cleanup and so on.  But I also find that, [MN], ah, especially when I travel [SIGH] and then I'm kinda eating out every night, you know, o- one night after the other and maybe even including breakfast and lunch, [SIGH] is that you get -- I -- I get tired of it.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, yeah, huh.
R:  Ah, the, ah, the novelty wears off --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] ah, pretty -- pretty quickly.
L:  [SIGH] Well, the other thing -- the other thing about, I guess, you know, eating at home is I kinda like [NOISE] -- you know, I'm married, I have two kids too. [SIGH]  And, ah, I -- I look forward to that evening meal.  I mean, kinda, I don't know, it's like fifties television or something.
R:  [MN]
L:  But I mean just -- [SIGH] there's something solid, there's something [NOISE] comforting about [SIGH] the [NOISE] -- the sitting down, [NOISE] [MN], ah, you know, ah, for a meal as a family.  You know, the four of us and, "How was your days?" and, [SIGH] you just kinda, [NOISE] you're catching up with each other.  I mean this is 'cause we all go here there and yon and [SIGH] what goes on.  I think [NOISE] you can't get that in a restaurant.  I mean it's not -- there's something [NOISE] about, ah, [NOISE] you know, eating at home [NOISE] that -- that does it, and a meal that you [NOISE] prepared yourself is kind of aesthetically pleasing, [NOISE] I think.
R:  Mm. [MN]
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] yeah.  Yeah.  That -- that's, ah -- that's true.  Although [SIGH] it can be hard in our family sometimes to -- to, [SIGH] ah, be creative enough to, ah --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [MN] prepare lots of different kinds of meals and yet find things that everybody likes.  [SIGH] And that's --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I know.
R:  -- I guess that's an advantage --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to going out, isn't it?
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  I mean we -- we do the same thing, you know, we kind of eat at --
L:  How old are you kids?
R:  Ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ten and thirteen, so ...
L:  Ten and thirteen, oh.
R:  Yeah, we're eating dinner every night at -- at six o'clock more or less, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, and, um, but, you know, things come and then, ah, your kids have activities or whatever, I have to work late, so that doesn't always happen.  But that's -- that's the goal. [SIGH]  Um, ah, and generally they're -- they're not picky eaters but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, you know, but -- but also it's -- it's kind of fun to go out and where everybody can really, ah, get exactly, ah, what -- what he or she wants.  Of course then we have the problem of finding a restaurant that everybody likes.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  And that's a -- yeah, I can't tell you how many times -- and you kinda almost get in the car and not even sure where we're going.  And -- and that, ah, that even in itself is difficult. [MN]
L:  Oh I -- oh, I know. [SIGH] Oh, who does the cooking at your house?
R:  [SIGH] Um, mm, ah, well in early days my wife and I split it, but, ah, now she does the --
L:  You're gone a lot, I think you said.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  She -- she does most of the, ah -- of the cooking.  [SIGH] So, um, [SIGH] ah, yeah, we'll have typically kind of a meat related meal maybe, y- you know, for dinner, maybe once or twice a week, and then the other nights we're trying to eat, you know, kinda vegetarian, dairy --
L:  Oh, good for you.  Wow.
R:  -- kinds of things.  Just to -- to -- 
L:  You w- -- how do you define vegetarian?
R:  Ah ....
L:  Is it like fish vegetarian, or ...?
R:  Vegetarian for me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, just means k- -- I guess I should say non meat.  That would be --
L:  Non meat, okay. [NOISE]
R:  That would be a better way to describe it.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  Which we kind of think of as being somewhat more healthy.  So, fish or pasta --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or -- or things -- things like that.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] Um, and it -- it's kinda interesting that, you know, we -- w- -- you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- after years of doing that, you know, we know how to make lots of things like that.  But the reality also is that -- that in our family we all seem to be carnivores and we really kinda crave those, ah --
L:  I know.
R:  -- those meals --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where it's, ah -- where it's some kinda meat.  That's kinda interesting that way. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I know.  I know. [SIGH]  Ah, you said something that struck me.  I don't know.  I guess -- oh, I do the cooki- -- you know, I'm home from -- I get off work at two t- -- I'm a teacher.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] I work at a school where I'm home --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- early.  [SIGH] And so, it's kinda up to me to cook the meal.  I guess I kinda like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- put the meal together.--
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but I don't like the cleaning.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- So I [LAUGH] -- but I do -- I guess I, ah, you know.  If you put a gun to my head and said, "What do you prefer, eating out or eating at home?" I would have to say eating at home because I [NOISE] -- I -- I do like to cook.  My, um -- you know, and I don't like to clean.  And so I kind of have the [SIGH] -- you know, [MN] kinda under -- [MN] kind of an implied rule in our house that the person who puts the meal together doesn't have to clean it up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or whatever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] And so, yeah, we're kind of a -- a Galtherian[?] like that.
R:  How old are you kids?
L:  Huh?
R:  How old are you kids?
L:  Ah, sixtee- -- soon to be seventeen and fifteen.  They're juniors and freshmen in highschool --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- both boys.
R:  Are they home for dinner, ah, most nights?
L:  Well [SIGH] ...  [LIPSMACK] It's hard to say -- th- th- th- [SIGH] -- not lately 'cause they're in plays and stuff, you know, and we k- -- I do miss that.  I mean the -- you know, and they're both in like theater things at school, school related things.  They're doing that kind of thing.  [NOISE] And so it -- I, ah, miss it when I don't -- we don't have evening meals together, you now.
R:  Mm.
L:  And so, um .... [NOISE]  But no, they're -- they're pretty good about cleaning up, you know, they don't complain too much.  Well, they're [NOISE] teenagers, but I mean --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  --you know. [SIGH]  But, um, [MN] -- no, but I guess, ah, my wife and I -- guess we both -- when we were dating we had a long courtship and we both [NOISE] loved to put meals together. [NOISE]  I think that was, ah, [MN] part of our attraction [NOISE] to each other.  We both [NOISE] kind of -- that was a big thing [NOISE] for [SIGH] four years, we, you know, didn't live together before we got married and we just sort of [SIGH] enjoyed getting together on the weekends and putting a meal together, you know.  So, it's part of our -- part of our background, part of our, ah, [SIGH] culture as it occurred, or, ah, history as a, ah -- as a [NOISE] -- as a couple, you know to do that sort of ...
R:  Yeah, so what's a -- what's a perfect meal to you?
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I don't know.  Good question.  Um, [MN] ah, I don't have one.  I don't know if I have a perfect meal.  I mean just something that's -- [SIGH] something that's put together with another person and, you know, sort of a teamwork kind of an effort sort of a thing and, [SIGH] I would guess I -- ah, but in terms of what -- what it would, I don't know.  Yeah, we're carnivores [NOISE] but I mean I -- [SIGH] some of our -- I think [NOISE] you can be just as creative, [NOISE] or more creative vege- -- cooking non meat -- ah, cooking meatless, I think.  And so, ah ...  You know, but you can't get -- some of the meat -- I mean, there's -- let's face it, I mean there's Chinese and Pizza and stuff like that [NOISE] I can't -- I mean I'm a good cook but I can't [NOISE]-- it's not as good as you can --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- get it out too -- either, you know, I can't cook. [SIGH]  Or Mexican, a lot of [NOISE] things, you know.  [NOISE] It's just not as good cooked at home.  I mean I'm not that accomplished a cook. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.  Yeah.  When we go out we try to eat, [SIGH] ah, kinda ethnic foods, you know, Mexican, Chinese, we have, ah, Cambodian, Indian --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- lot -- lots of that stuff around here.  [SIGH] And, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it -- it's -- again for some of the same reasons.  We can do Chinese okay at -- at home, but --
L:  -- [NOISE]
R:  -- there's a lot of things we just don't know how to do.  Or as you say, you know, we don't have -- maybe we don't have the right equipment.  It's a combination of factors, so, y- you know, anything that we can -- that we can make at home we wouldn't -- we wouldn't go out of our way to -- t- to eat outside.
L:  Right.  You don't sound like you're from Boston. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, I -- I was born in Chicago.
L:  Oh, that's 'cau- -- yeah, okay, you have a Mid -- more of a Mid Western.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You don't sound Boston. [LAUGH] 
R:  No.  I've, ah, been here --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  Well, I'm from Missouris, I'm from Kansas City.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I don't sound like a [SIGH] Clevelander either.
R:  I see.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I see.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  So what, ah -- what kinds of, ah -- when you go out, what kinds of restaurants would you go to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then?
L:  Oh, [SIGH] -- oh just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it varies.  I mean I think, ah, we have a favorite piz- -- we have a pizza night, you know. [NOISE] [SIGH]  That's sort of wherever --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we live.  We lived in Africa for a while and, ah, [MN] we -- we had a great pizza place.  And wherever we've lived we've had kind of a -- you know, a -- a f- -- favorite pizza place that we could go to all the time.  We don't -- you know, we find one that we like and we stick with it.  [SIGH] Ah, there's a great Cambodian Vietnamese restaurant, ah, ah, near here we go to.  Um, [SIGH] yeah, just stuff we can't fix at home.  And then --
R:  Have you ever tried to make sushi at home?
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  No.  [SIGH] No.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Neither of us, I don't think, are much into that.
R:  Oh, you're not sushi eaters?
L:  No.
R:  'Cause there's something that you might think that you can only do outside, but that -- we've been to somebody's house where they made it at home and it was actually quite good.
L:  Quite good?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah but, ah, if you don't like, ah -- if you don't like it to start with it's not, ah ....
L:  Well, see I'm the only one in this family that likes fish.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, and that's -- that's a thing -- you know, that's a thing.  I mean that's one of the things.  I'll go out and I'll get [NOISE] fish and everybody else -- ah, you know, that's the only time I ever get fish.  I don't know why they don't like fish, but [SIGH] I'm the only one that ever -- that ever gets it, you know.
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Mm.
L:  [SIGH] So anyway, ah, what are you doing home in the middle of the day?
R:  Oh, I'm not home, I'm at the office.
L:  Oh, you're -- oh good for you.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm at -- I'm at the office.
L:  I was gonna call [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE] How about yourself?  Are you on spring break?
L:  [SIGH] No --
R:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ours was just over.  You know, ours was just -- ours was last week, this was the first day back today. [NOISE]
R:  Oh.  You already -- you already back now?
L:  So, what I did was.  I'll tell you another reason I like to cook at home is 'cause [SIGH] you can do -- like yesterday [NOISE] I made two [NOISE] things, ah, kind of like two -- every -- I had some time yesterday afternoon.  I just sort of [NOISE] turned on some music and drank -- had a couple of beers and just [NOISE] in -- in the kitchen enjoyed cooking, and I got [SIGH] like [NOISE] two days -- two -- three days worth of meals ready.  All you have to do [NOISE] is, you now, put them in the microwave for people, tonight.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, tonight, tomorrow night, and maybe [SIGH] another [NOISE] night this week.  And so ...
R:  What'd you cook?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What were the -- what was the stuff?
L:  Well, are you ready for this?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay. [NOISE]  We had a ham for Easter. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, [NOISE] what do you do for leftovers?  We made ham and -- I made ham and beans, cooked the -- the bone and you know just -- [SIGH] and ah, with some beans, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so ham and beans.  There was a -- [NOISE]  How's that for a good Mid Western meal?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Good.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And then, ah -- oh, I made -- I found a recipe.  We had some mangoes, somebody gave us some mangoes.  [SIGH] And I found a recipe that had, um -- it called for mangoes, and then we had a bunch of pork chops in the -- ah, pork loin in the freezer that was taking up a lot of space and was gonna -- been there for [SIGH] about a month or so, you need to use.  [SIGH] And so I, you know, [NOISE] went to epicurious dotcom and, [SIGH] ah, found a recipe for, ah, these pork chops with mango [SIGH] ah, and pineapple.  And, ah, [NOISE] we had part of it last night -- I made a whole bunch of it and --
