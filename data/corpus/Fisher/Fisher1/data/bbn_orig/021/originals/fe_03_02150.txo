L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hi, this is Dee in Florida.
L:  Yes, uh, this is, uh, Bob in Florida.
R:  You are?  Where are you in Florida?
L:  Uh, in Pompano Beach.
R:  I'm in Ocala.
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay.
L:  Food.  Okay.  I'd much prefer to eat in a restaurant.  How 'bout you? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, no, I'll take the other side of the issue.  I'd rather, uh, eat at home.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes.
L:  Why?
R:  Well, uh, because I feel the food will be better prepared.  Uh, nowadays, most everything is done on a fast food basis, even in a restaurant.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, I'm more interested in nutrition, uh, than I am in, um, the taste of the food.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, the selection as far as nutritional value is better if you cook at home, and I, you know -- but as far as sanitary, I mean, you can -- restaurants are pretty strict as far as, you know, sanitary conditions.
L:  Yeah, except now with this, uh, this SARS situation, I wouldn't want somebody coughing over the food or anything like that, and, um, uh, having, uh, owned a commissary, um, it was very difficult always to, uh, um, get the people to wash their hands after any number of activities.  Uh, for example, something slips on the floor and somebody picks it up, uh, now at home, um, I was always taught that you immediately went and washed your hands thoroughly, uh, before you would touch an- any other object in the kitchen, or at the dinner table.
R:  Right.
L:  So, uh, I'm not sure that everybody obeys that, so therefore I'm, uh, more conscious of that, having also, uh, owned the commissary, um, in Florida, like you, I know what the, uh, uh, the -- it's a restaurant and hotel commission, they come in and they -- they do, uh, um, examine and, uh, inspect constantly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, but their rules are -- are still pretty liberal, and, uh, I know, uh, having run a commissary, um, that there are ways to get around, uh, some of those issues, and I know in a restaurant, um, business, when people are in a hurry, and, uh, they're working on tips and so forth like that, I would imagine, um, haste i- is -- is more of their mind than it would be to, uh, uh, stop and wash their hands, uh, so on and so forth.
R:   Mhm.  That's probably right.  I do wonder too about, you know, like on buffets, there's things under light, you know, I think there's some sort of rule as to how long you can keep food under lights and I wonder, you know, if they really follow that pretty rigidly?
L:  Well, uh, yes.  I've always had a problem, i- if, I -- uh, at church, we have a buffet, and if it's during the flu season, two or three days later I will have some minor, uh, uh, symptom of the -- of th- the flu --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- whether, and I know that it's just because people have, uh, touched the food, maybe touched their nose or shaken hands with somebody else, and then, touched, uh, something that -- that has to do with the preparation of the food.  Now, out in a restaurant where there's a buffet, you notice that they do have the -- the glass shield --
R:  Right.
L:  -- at an angle over the food, so that people can't, uh, inadvertently sneeze or cough, or -- or something, uh, so that the food is better prep- er -- stays more sanitary, but it's still a problem, isn't it?
R:  Right.  Yeah, well, how 'bout, um, food that -- like hot food, like fried chicken underneath those lights, I mean, chicken is a big source of --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like salmonella, you know.
L:  Absolutely, yeah.
R:  And how long can you, you know -- are they under restriction as to how long they can keep that food out?
L:  I don't think so, but of course the longer they keep it out under the heat, the less the salmonella, I -- I -- I would imagine, because I'm not -- no, I'm not sure of my statement on that.  I don't know whether salmonella incubates under -- after some -- well, see, supposedly the premise would be, it would be thoroughly co- cooked to begin with, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that the salmonella wouldn't be there when you, uh, put the heat lamp on, but --
R:  And is the heat sufficient enough though, to, you know ...?
L:  But you see nowadays, we realize -- science realizes that anything that's heated over a hundred and eighteen degrees, I believe it is --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- oh see boiling point is, er, one twelve, no I'm wrong, it's a hundred and eight degrees.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, under, er, see, wat- -- water boils at -- no, no, water boils at two hundred and twelve degrees, doesn't it?
R:  Right.
L:  Yep.
R:  Right.
L:  I'm totally wrong.  It is a hundred and eighteen degrees, all right.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  Anything over a hundred and eighteen degrees, you begin to lose all the -- the real nutrient value in the food --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- because the enzymes in the food are the things that make it, um, oh, being very simple about it -- nutritious to the body --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, and it's just like taking vitamins and minerals, which I take by the handful, but science says that if it isn't in its natural form with the -- with the enzymes, you probably aren't going to absorb it, oh, and if you do, er, it's not going to be, um, of a nutritious nature.  So --
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, it's --
R:  You mean an adequate amount of it?
L:  I eat two meals a day where I don't cook.
R:  Oh.
L:  Uh, but on the third meal, I succumb to tradition and -- and palate, er, perhaps, and then, uh, w- will cook, but I try.  Now, I live in a small apartment and, uh, for a while the only thing I had was a microwave.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, uh, I realize now that, uh, [LAUGH] like -- like in England they're all concerned about the DNA and the irradiated food, well of course a microwave, uh, is a very dangerous piece of equipment wi- ra- -- that irradiates, and of course, the newer ones are supposedly have a better, um, window -- uh, no, what's the word I want?  Opening, yeah.  What do you call that thing that opens and closes on a microwave?
R:  The door, you mean?
L:  The door, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  A better door, uh, so that the radiation doesn't come through, so, uh -- but what is happening to the food?  It's all the enzymes and all the aspects of it are under this microwave --
R:  Mm
L:  And there again, [SIGH] we're changing the substance of the food, the molecular action -- molecular restructure of the food, and -- and what it -- whether there's any nutrition in it -- oh, it's cooked, but then again, um, when you're out in a restaurant, how do you know how much of it is microwaved?
R:  Well, that's true too.  I guess, you know, the word sterilize really [LAUGH] would m- mean stripped of everything [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  And, of course, you being -- you being a woman, uh, you- you've cooked all your life, and so to you being able to go out and have somebody --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, um --
R:  Wait on me is a luxury, right.
L:  Yeah, it's an absolute positively, uh, -tival[?] luxury, right.  And, uh, I understand that, and I'm -- being a bachelor, and cooking, uh, for myself, um, I guess I would have the same desire, but then again, um, when I look at what we're getting nowadays when we're out, um -- and I'm more interested in good health.  See, being aged seventy one and still exercising twice a day and still, you know ...
R:  Wonderful.
L:  Yeah.  So, therefore I've realized that food is [LAUGH] more than just the, uh, the opportunity to have somebody else prepare it.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, yes, I would like to have a maid [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But I'm sure she'd -- she'd want to cook it her way, and -- and, uh, we'd have a breakdown in -- in, um, relationship [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH].
L: -- very quickly [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I -- I guess the bottom line is -- is just going out to eat is just a luxury.  It's really not the most nutritional or healthy way to go, because --
L:  But you can't --
R:  It's all loaded with fat, you know that?
L:  Yeah, fat makes something sweet and -- and very palatable and -- and tasteful, and -- and of course now science has realized that, uh, there are good fats and bad fats, and uh --
R:  Right.  Now, blooming onion is definitely not a good fat [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  So, uh, and -- and most the time when you go to these restaurants, um, the whole menu is predicated on how quickly they can serve it and get it to you, so it's a pretty fast food entry.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, remember the old days, the old fashioned restaurants, uh, where it was like a home cooked meal?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And uh -- and uh, my goodness, a roast -- a roast lamb or something like that, it -- it takes only a very high caliber restaurant today that would do something like that.
R:  Would even tackle something like that, you know.
L:  Right, and, uh, so ...
R:  And when they cooked your eggs right in front of you and [LAUGH] things like that.
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  You know.
L:  And eggs now, eggs are very healthy.  They've come --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, a hundred and eighty degrees on that.  Eggs are uh --
R:  Isn't that the truth? [LAUGH].
L:  Ya.  Butter -- butter is -- is very good for you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, of course, um, then, of course, the olive oil.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And other safflower oil and the, uh, even the coconut oil.  Um, the reason that coconut oil was labelled so -- got such a bad reputation is when they ...
