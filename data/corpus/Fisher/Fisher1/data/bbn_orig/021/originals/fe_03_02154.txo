L:  Howdy.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Rocky Winns[?] [LAUGH].
R:  Hi, I, uh -- my name is Guy.  I live in, uh, the twin cities, in Minnesota.  Where are you from?
L:  I'm in Madison, Wisconsin.
R:  Okay, cool --
L:  Not that f- --
R:  -- so, it's so far --
L:  -- long a distance from you.
R:  Yep.  So, uh, I guess the topic of the day is food [LAUGH].
L:  Yep.
R:  So, uh, let's see.  What d- -- do you prefer eating in a restaurant or at a, uh -- or at home?
L:  Well, i- if somebody else is paying, I'd greatly prefer eating in a restaurant [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.  What, uh -- what's your favorite restaurant?
L:  Oh, at the moment it's probably Out Back.
R:  Out Back Steak House?  That's cool.
L:  Yeah, Out Back Steak House.
R:  Do you like their seafood?
L:  Their seafood.  I don't think I've had their seafood, I don't think.
R:  Yeh, I had their, uh -- I had their shrimp, um, one time in -- and I, uh, I thought it was over spiced -- 
L:  Huh.
R:  -- but, uh, but who knows.  Yeah, I, uh -- I like, uh, Romano's Macaroni Grill.  Have you ever eaten there?
L:  No, I've never eaten at Romano's.
R:  Okay.  It's like a -- it's a Tuscan, um -- it's like a Tuscan style Italian restaurant.  I think that's, uh -- it's probably my idea of the perfect meal.  They -- they serve, uh -- they serve bread, um, to you -- uh, some focaccia bread, and -- and, uh, my, uh, favorite is called, uh, Penne Rustica, and it's, uh, it's sort of  a penne dish with a garlic sauce, and, um, it has a combination of shrimp, chicken and ham, uh, baked into it.  It's pretty good.
L:  Yeah, sounds good. 
R:  Yep, so, uh --
L:  Particularly with the garlic sauce, you can hardly go wrong with that.
R:  -- what's that?
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, garlic, uh [LAUGH], garlic is definitely good.  Garlic's definitely good.  So, are you a student, uh, in Madison, or, uh ...?
L:  [LAUGH] I suppose everybody who lives in Madison just asked that question.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Uh, no.  I'm, uh, forty nine years old, and, uh, have been out of the universities for a long time.
R:  Oh, okay.  That's a -- well, actually, yeah, I'm getting ready to be a student here in, uh, in the Minneapolis area.
L:  Oh, really?
R:   So, yeah.  What, uh -- what, uh, brought you to this, uh, study here?  See it in a newspaper ad or ...?
L:  I'm sorry, what was that?
R:  Oh, I said, uh, did you -- did you, uh, see an -- an ad for the study, or, uh ...?
L:  Oh, um, oh, what did I -- I -- I think I was doing an internet search, uh, on something else, and actually ran across the site.
R:  Huh, that's interesting.  Okay.
L:  I think that's how I found it [LAUGH].  I -- I do --
R:  -- I suppose, uh --
L:  -- so much surfing on the net, it's ridiculous, um, sometimes I forget.
R:  Okay.  So, I suppose we should stay on task here, with the -- so --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- wh- what do, uh, what do you prefer to eat at home [LAUGH]?
L:  Oh, um, well, I prefer simple stuff.  
R:  Okay.
L:  Don't have to spend a lot of time making it, that kind of thing.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Um, so, various kinds of sandwiches, uh, spaghetti [LAUGH], stuff like that.
R:  That's cool.  Do y- -- do you -- do you eat a lot of, uh, box dinners at all?
L:  Um, used to.  I don't that much any more.  But once in a while, yeah.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, I'm a big, uh -- I'm a big pot pie fan actually myself.
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  I find it's the, uh [LAUGH].
L:  When I was your age, I was a big pot pie fan also.
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, it's, uh, it's a little bit of effort for, uh, for a good amount of food, and it's cheap [LAUGH], and so ...
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I'm actually big into pasties now instead of pot pies.
R:  Okay.  Oh, uh, pasties, ar- -- okay, is that -- that's spelled P.A.S.T.I.E.S., right?
L:  Oh, yeah, and the singular is with a Y.
R:  You say it like pasties, pasties?  Yeah, what are those?  Are those like hot pockets, or, uh ...?
L:  Um, they are a -- a type of food that was brought over from Europe, uh, by the miners who came to Wisconsin and --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- it came to other places too for that matter.  Um, and basically it is, uh, meat and potatoes, uh --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and a little bit of sauce, that kind of thing, uh, nothing really fancy, and it's all enclosed in a, uh, a crust.
R:  Wow.
L:  The crust goes all the way round, there's no pan.
R:  Huh.  So, do you, uh, do you make these yourself, or ...?
L:  Well, you can, but no, I just buy them frozen [LAUGH].
R:  Okay, huh.  I'll have to check those out.  Wh- what kind of sauce, uh -- what kind of sauce comes in those?
L:  Uh, it's very simple.  I think pretty much it's just the, uh, uh, juices run together.
R:  Oh, wow.  Huh.
L:  Yeah, and so you --
R:  Wh- what brand --
L:  -- provide your own, uh, ketchup whatever, you know.
R:  I see.  So, do you -- do you -- so, do you eat them with, uh -- with a condiment then, you --
L:  Yeah, you tend to.
R:  -- you prefer to put --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, they're pretty bland then by themselves?
L:  Yeah.  There is a place here in Madison that also makes them, and they do, uh, a number of different flavors of them, so they put in spices, but generally --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- the ones you buy in the store are not spiced.
R:  Right, so it's just, uh, what is it?  Ham or beef or ...?
L:  Um, it's usually beef.
R:  Okay.
L:  Once in a while it's turkey --
R:  It's kind of a necessary [LAUGH].  That's cool.  Well, I'll have to -- I'll have to look in, uh -- I'll have to look and see about that pasties, pasties.  So, is that the +correct -- uh, the correct pronunciation, is pasties?
L:  Um, there is a great deal of controversy about that, and it can be pronounced both ways.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Huh.  Which is the, uh, wh- which school of thought are you at -- are you currently in?  I guess the pasty  --
L:  Oh, I -- I use the short A myself [LAUGH].
R:  Okay [LAUGH], interesting [LAUGH], interesting.  That's why --  I, um, I think my, uh, my favorite type of dinner like that would be a, uh, a Recounter's[?] pot pie.  It -- it's a more sophisticated pot pie.  The, um ...
L:  A sophisticated pot pie?
R:  Yes.  I would say so.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I would say that it's -- it's quite sophisticated [LAUGH].  But, uh, it's, uh -- it's, um -- well, you know, your typical, uh, Swanson pot pie is, uh, you know, it- it's pretty short.  It's like an inch high.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, not a lot of -- not a lot of substance to it.  Th- the crust is made out of some pretty cheap stuff, um, but the Recounter's version, they cost, uh -- they cost about three bucks, um, and they use some very good ingredients, fresh vegetables, um, you can, you know you can actually crunch if there's broccoli in it.  Y- you can crunch the broccoli or the carrots.  It's pretty good.  
L:  Oh [NOISE].
R:  And, um, actually they used to use, uh, sherry in their sauce, um, which was pretty cool, but I think they stopped doing that, uh, for some reason or another.  Probably, uh [LAUGH] -- probably due to economic restrictions of some type.
L:  Yeah, I suppose.
R:  Yeah, I've been eating those, uh -- eating those since I was a tyke.  But, uh, what about, uh, international food then?
L:  Uh, what about international food?
R:  Yeah, what, uh -- what type of, uh, international food to you like there?
L:  [LAUGH] Well, when I was in Zambia last June, um, I really did like their, uh, meat dishes there.
R:  Okay.
L:  Now, mind you, the normal Zambian doesn't get to eat meat a lot [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  They eat nsima over there, and that is --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- just, um, ground up corn, basically corn meal, that's been boiled with water until it's so stiff you can't stir it any more.
R:  Really?
L:  That's when they know it's done [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.
L:  And that's used as your spoon.
R:  Really?
L:  Believe it or not [LAUGH].
R:  Huh.
L:  And so --
R:  And then --
L:  -- you have the nsima and some kind of sauce, or something to dip it in because nsima itself doesn't taste like hardly anything.
R:  Okay.
L:  But, you know, then they have, uh, some meat or, uh, some vegetables or something like this, and, uh, you dip the nsima in that, and eat the nsima with -- dipped, and, uh, -- actually it came up quite good with meat sauce [LAUGH].
R:  Wow.
L:  Their spicing over there is, uh, fairly moderate and, uh, quite good by my taste.
R:  So -- so, it's -- it's just corn meal -- it's -- it's corn meal that they boil?
L:  Yep, that's it.
R:  Or it's just corn?  Okay, corn meal.
L:  Yep.
R:  And they just boil it until it's, uh ...?  Huh.  Well, th- -- an- and so it's -- do they dry it before they give it to you?  Is -- is it dry when you, uh ...?
L:  No, uh-uh.  It's hot and, uh, a little bit sticky and very stiff.
R:  Okay.
L:  If not then y- --
R:  And so you --
L:  You don't use spoons and knives over there, mind you.
R:  Right.
L:  So, the nsima is your spoon [LAUGH].
R:  Hm.
L:  So, you pick up a globule with your right hand, squish it around until you've got a spoonish like shape and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- then use it.
R:  So, it's -- so, it's malleable then?  Huh.
L:  Yeah, it's quite malleable.
R:  Wow.  Can you find that, uh, do you think in any, uh, uh, ethnic restaurants, do you think, or do you ...?
L:  Um, I don't think so.  
R:  Huh.
L:  Uh, for people in the United States, uh, we gotta use spoons.
R:  Right.
L:  You know [LAUGH] what I mean?
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  You wouldn't want it -- th- they won't do it that way.  
R:  Right.
L:  It would be very difficult to get people to eat nsima correctly in the United States.
R:  I'm sure too, it'd probably violate a whole host of health codes [LAUGH].
L:  Um, well maybe, maybe not [LAUGH], hm.
R:  Depending on how you -- how you grab the -- the nsima then.  Huh.  That's interesting.
L:  Yep.
R:  So, where, um -- where else did you travel?  Did you travel anywhere else in Africa while you were there?
L:  Um, well, only, uh, making connections on the airlines, so I actually was in South Africa also --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- to, uh, make connections there, and we had a -- what was it?  Four hour lay over, so we actually got to kind of wander around a little bit, but not a lot.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, and also we had an eight hour lay over in London --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- so, that was cool.  Got to go to a London pub and everything else like that.
R:  Oh, yeah.  How -- how long ago was that 'cause actually I -- I haven't gotten to get overseas, uh, quite yet?
