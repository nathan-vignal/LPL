L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name is Joy.
L:  [SIGH] My name's Christie.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you too.
R:  Do you want to go first, or, would you like me to?
L:  Um, I guess I'll go first, um --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I like eating in a restaurant better, just because, it's -- it's easier [LAUGH], you know, it's easier to get around and like people wait on you [LAUGH] and stuff, and you don't have to go and [SIGH] make everything, um [LAUGH] -- uh, dang [SIGH] --
R:  I agree with the theory, but I've got a one year old toddler who's very messy and finding a babysitter isn't always easy, but I love the idea of not having to come home to dishes.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH], I know, and there's nothing to clean up, and everything's done, and you get what you want.
R:  I agree it's nice to be able to come home, and do other things, like spend the time with your family, or quality time for yourself for other things.
L:  [SIGH] I -- I agree too, because I have a baby as well, and, um, I'm always busy with her, so, [SIGH] whenever I get money or spare money, I like to go out and spend, because --
R:  Oh, I agree with you.  It's nice to have a break.  I love my kid, she's just turned one, but is -- she's very high energy, and it's nice to have a break. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Sometimes my husband and I just like to have time just by ourselves, so, it's nice.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, um, what's -- see, I don't know if we're s- -- talk about our favorite restaurants or anything like that, do you know?
R:  Um, actually, I think we're allowed to.  I like the Olive Garden -- is one of my favorite chains.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I like the Olive Garden too.  I haven't been there in a really long time.  Um, last place I went to actually was today.  I went to Sonic, the drive through restaurant.
R:  Really?  How was that?
L:  [SIGH] Huh?
R:  I said, "How was that?"
L:  It was pretty good.  Um, I can't miss the breakfast food, but I got breakfast, 'cause they have breakfast all day, and I got up just like, uh, um, about two hours ago. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, um, see I'm in Pittsburg, PA, and we don't have one of those, so I like to learn about new restaurants.
L:  Really?
R:  Yep.  What we have here in Pennsylvania, is a chain called Eat'n Park, and I like their breakfasts.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  They have really good breakfast buffets.
L:  I never heard of that place before.
R:  So, see, we're teaching each other things.  If I ever go to a different part of the country that has a Sonic, I'll have to look out for you.
L:  Really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, let's see, um, your favorite place to eat at is Olive Garden?
R:  Yes.
L:  My favorite place is I think, like I go to most -- more than anything, is either Taco Bell or McDonalds. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I understand.  That's what I do when I'm in a hurry on my way to work. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK]
R:  They had some good coupons in a paper last week for McDonalds breakfast food.  Did you see them?
L:  Um, they didn't have any here in the paper, where I live at. [LAUGH]
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  I usually just go there, and never have, like, have the money or whatever.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  My favorite food there, um -- see, if I'm going to eat during the breakfast, my favorite food there is like their -- I guess their big breakfast [LAUGH], [SIGH] 'cause it's like the best one, 'cause if I have like left over food, I give it to my husband.
R:  They're most cost effective too, 'cause you have the protein of the eggs, and you have some nice yummy pancakes.  I like them too.
L:  Yeah, I get everything, only and, uh -- it's like mostly three bucks. [LAUGH] We're like --
R:  Exactly, it's a good deal.
L:  I know, and you're stuffed too, well, I mean, I always get this stuffed when I like leave there.
R:  If you get the egg McMuffins, then you're spending almost, uh -- I mean, you still feel hungry afterward it. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  Or the, um -- the other thing I used to -- or at least I like is the big egg and cheese biscuit.  They're -- oh, my goodness.
R:  You know what I like for lunch at McDonalds?  They just got these new salads, and -- and I love the bacon ranch salad that they've got is really yum.
L:  Are those good?
R:  They're really good --
L:  They're good.
R:  -- and the California cob, that's really good too.
L:  [SIGH] See, 'cause I heard about them on a commercial. [SIGH] The commercial's like really funny and so there's like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- this mom and their kids driving, and they get to a McDonald sign, and the kids are like, "Can we go to McDonalds, can we go to McDonalds?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and mom's like, "No".
R:  Oh, yeah, I've seen that commercial.  It's hilarious.
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  Then they totally stop by the sign, like after they finally get there, "Anybody want to go to McDonalds?  Let's order". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I know. [LAUGH] It was, um -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  -- I saw -- I saw those, and I was like, "Oh, my goodness, they look good, and I want one".  I haven't had any yet though.
R:  They do.  I wish they'd bring back the choice and the value meals where you could pick.  They haven't done it in a while, but, it was nice when they had -- you could pick water or yogurt or other things instead of fries, I miss that. [LAUGH]
L:  Man, they don't have that here.  They never have.
R:  Really?
L:  Really.  We've got what -- what comes with the value meal, like the fries and drink and sandwich, but it --
R:  I think McDonalds was struggling for a while, so they were playing around with different things, trying to get the market share back up.  It might have been just a select part of the country.
L:  Yeah, that might --
R:  You don't mind me asking what state are you in?
L:  Indiana.  Where were you -- where are you from?
R:  Pennsylvania.  I'm not that far away. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's not that far.  I've never been there. [LAUGH]
R:  That's okay.  I've never been to Indiana, and I don't know how you [several inaudible words] down there, but I've heard it's a good state.
L:  It's pretty good.
R:  That's good.
L:  [LAUGH] Pennsylvania, I hear it's good.  Is there like, um, the Hershey chocolate factory there? [LAUGH]
R:  There is, and that's down state.  Now, that's my guilty pleasure.  I love chocolate. [LAUGH]
L:  See, I do too.  See, that -- that's food too, so, I'm like, "Hey, you're in Pennsylvania, there's a Hershey chocolate factory down there". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- shouldn't even go down there, I'd
R:  -- I can't tell you that much about Indiana.  What types of foods are good down there?  What regional special things do you have?
L:  I mean, we really don't have much.  We have like, Olive Garden, like you guys have, and we have like, um, McDonalds, Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried Chicken.  I guess about every thing, I mean --
R:  Most places have ... [LAUGH]
L:  Huh?
R:  I say, "Most places have stuff like that".
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I don't really think that they [LAUGH] -- at least I got to.
R:  Yeah, but we don't have a Sonic. [LAUGH]
L:  We have Culvers too.  Have you ever gone there?  Do you guys have one --
R:  No, is --
L:  -- of those?
R:  -- it good.
L:  Um, it's pretty good.  It's like, mm, hard to explain.  They have these things called butter burgers. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's pretty --
R:  Do they actually butter --
L:  -- good.
R:  -- the burger? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no, the bun.  The buns are like buttered.
R:  Are they good?
L:  Yeah, it's pretty good.
R:  Yum.
L:  They're pretty expensive though, uh, I like, I think, just for a cheese burger, it's like three whole bucks, but it's like a fast --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- food place too.  Yeah, but it's --
R:  I'm sure it's a nice treat once in a while though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess, uh, when you have a baby, everything is so expensive. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  It's like I always have to buy diapers or anything, and then, it's hard to go out to eat, but it's easier to go out to eat.
R:  I know exactly what you mean, especially by the time you're done buying everything you need for a good meal. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, and everyone's like, "Hey, it's much cheaper if you make your own food" but then there's like all this clean up to do, and how can you clean up with having had a kid --
R:  Sometimes -- 
L:  -- screaming and ...
R:  -- it is, but see, we only have a family of three, so, we could go to Sam's Club, and they do have good food and the prices are cheap, but --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- sometimes it's too much just for a couple of people.
L:  Yeah [SIGH].  I mean, uh -- you know, she's not -- it's -- she's like only a -- just a little baby, but she's like about six months old, and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- just being with all the time is just, oh, man, she wants everything.
R:  Oh, yeah, I definitely understand.  My -- I'm a stay at home mom -- my baby -- I only work part time -- keeps me really busy.
L:  Yeah [SIGH].
R:  Yeah, and like you said before, it's definitely nice to have the break.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Sometimes it's harder to find a babysitter. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I know.  I could -- I could never find a babysitter.  I have my mom watch her [LAUGH] like the most.
R:  Well, see, that's good, but sometimes you can't really burden your family all the time. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I know. [SIGH] Like, if I need her to watch her, she will, but usually it's just oh ...
R:  Well, it's nice that you have some help though.
L:  Yeah.  It's nice to have it.
R:  Do you ever cook at home at all, like when going out gets too expensive?  And what do you like to make at home?
L:  See, I -- I'll cook sometimes, but I usually [LAUGH] cook hamburger helper [LAUGH] if I cook at home, and my husband will cook.  H- he like, will take --
R:  Well, that's good.  It's nice that he helps out.  My husband cooks too, and that helps a lot.
L:  Yeah, he makes -- he makes pork sauce[?] [LAUGH] and noodles.
R:  I make a lot of chicken.  You can get that really cheap, and you can make different chicken recipes that taste good for two --
L:  Oh, I know.  The easiest thing I found out, was you buy chicken at stores, the, um -- the stove top chicken kits, that you just, you know, with the stuff in them.
R:  I've heard of them --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- even cutting up a couple of apples and baking them in honey with the chicken, that's good.
L:  That sounds good.  So, I guess that's why I found it's easier to get chicken [inaudible].  I always use the --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- Hamburger Helper things and whatever --
R:  Hey, there's nothing wrong with Hamburger Helper.  They make quite a few different ones.
L:  Oh, I know.  I mean, one day we went to this gr- grocery store, and we just bought like, oh man, like about ten or twelve box of Hamburger Helper, 'cause you can make like a different meal most every day.
R:  Exactly, and you can mix different things into them.  They've got a tuna one, and like the hamburger.
L:  They don't have chicken, they have like everything, so -- and the lady was like, "How can you guys eat so much Hamburger Helper?" [LAUGH]
R:  Actually, that stuff is pretty good. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I know.  I mean, I was like, "Hey" I told the lady, "Like, I have a baby".
R:  Sometimes I'll mix sour cream into my ground beef and different vegetables and you'd be surprised what you can make.
L:  Yeah, I, er -- you know, I guess some people understand too, like I'm sure you do, 'cause you have a child too, and it's, you know, whether it's fast, if you're going to cook at home, you know.
R:  Well, that's true.  I was going to say I'd love to go out to eat, but it's that not reality, they want to throw their cheerios all over the floor --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [several inaudible words].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- well, that's my daughter, she's the biggest problem. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I'm just waiting for that.  I'm waiting for she's older to do that, to be throwing cheerios --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and everything --
R:  Usually about nine months, a baby could eat cereal --
L:  Yeah.  It's just not too long from now.
R:  What's that?
L:  Not too long from now, she'll be like eating the cereal and throwing it everywhere. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'm just waiting for that --
R:  Too true.
L:  -- now.
R:  [several inaudible words] redecorating the wall with your baby food. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] ...
