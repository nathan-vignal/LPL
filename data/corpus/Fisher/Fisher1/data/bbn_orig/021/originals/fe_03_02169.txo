R:  Hello.
L:  Charles.  Hi.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  Good.  My name's Rebecca.
L:  Hi, Rebecca.  I'm Charles.
R:  Hi.  Um, it looks like we're talking about food today. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, so, do you like eating in a restaurant or at home better?
L:  I enjoy eating in a restaurant a lot more than eating at home.
R:  What kind of --
L:  I pre- --
R:  -- restaurants do you go to?
L:  Uh, normally I go to Italian, Mexican or sushi.
R:  Oh.
L:  I can't get --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- enough of the sushi.
R:  [LAUGH] Cool.  I -- I -- it depends on my mood.  When I have time to cook, I like to cook at home, um, but more often it's more fun to go out to a restaurant, um, I go to -- I like Thai food and Mexican food probably the best.  I don't get the sushi very often 'cause I'm actually a vegetarian, so, I don't get --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- much --
L:  Does that --
R:  -- sushi --
L:  -- make it tough to go out to eat?
R:  It makes it, uh, um, it does, but mostly there's something to eat, um ... once in a while -- I've only come across maybe two restaurants where I couldn't find anything at all to eat, so ...
L:  I mean, that's probably what must be most limiting about going out, is that you -- you're at the -- the mercy of the restaurant.
R:  That's true [LAUGH], especially if someone else picks it, and they don't realize that you're a vegetarian or something, but, most of the time there's no problem, yeah.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I tend to -- could go almost anywhere and find something good to eat.  I mean, as long as it's in my price range.  I think that's the other --
R:  Right.
L:  -- important thing --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- about going out to eat, is making sure it's in your price range.
R:  Yeah, that's usually -- even though -- even though I'm a vegetarian, I usually consider the price more.  It's norm- -- I'm a college student, so I kind of save my money for books and all that good stuff --
L:  Yeah --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- I agree, um ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, when you go out to eat, um, do you normally do dinner or lunch?
R:  Um, usually dinner.  Usually dinner more often, um, that's just because of the work schedules and stuff.  It's usually easier to get together with people for dinner than it is for -- for lunch.  How 'bout you?
L:  Um, I -- I prefer to do lunch, but I end up --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- doing more dinners.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think lunch, it's less crowded and -- and you can usually get what you want really fast, and dinner, you usually end up sitting around waiting a long time for something when you're really hungry --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so ...
R:  Plus I --
L:  Either way --
R:  I -- it's nice to have a nice big lunch, and then you don't feel too heavy, you know, later in the day, and you go to bed, you know, and you don't feel stuffed.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  But, do you like the buffet style or do you like places where you just get one meal?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I kind of like -- sometimes the buffet places are pretty good, especially if you have like a good salad selection or something like that.  Um, unless there's something specific that I want, like if  I specifically want -- I sound like, "Oh, I'd really like this" or something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sometimes a buffet's a lot of fun, because sometimes you don't really know what you want, and then you can have a little bit of everything.
L:  That's very --
R:  What about --
L:  -- true.
R:  What about you?
L:  I like buffets because of the variety --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I find that when I go to the buffet, I eat too much because I want to get my ten dollars worth --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- so, I'm like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- usually stuffed, so, I think that overall, going to a normal restaurant where you could just get one meal, is better for me, because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- I just get one portion instead of like three or four.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that's just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my own personal preference, but, I mean --
R:  The other --
L:  -- buffets are awesome.
R:  Yeah, they are.  A lot of times it's a good value, but you do end up stuffing yourself.  The other thing about buffets that isn't always very good, is because you end up, um, wasting a lot of food.  Like you get something, and then you don't really like it, so, you don't eat it, and a lot of food gets wasted though.
L:  Yeah, I've noticed that.  People will fill up their plates and eat only half of it, and they get another plate, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in a long run, that's probably bad for the restaurant, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as a consumer, I don't know how much I should really care about that.
R:  [LAUGH] True, true.  But, it just depends I guess, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what's your, uh, perfect meal? 
L:  My perfect meal, sad to say, would be, uh, all you can eat sushi.
R:  Sounds good. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I mean, er, I -- it sounds good for me, but I mean, as a vegetarian, I'm sure you don't want to eat a lot of fish, but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for me, that would be just sh- -- excellent.  I can't imagine a --
R:  Better.
L:  -- better meal, where I just stuff myself with different types --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- of sushi.
R:  Do you have a favorite kind of sushi?
L:  Um, not really.  Uh, because every time I go out to eat, I end up getting like different platters and different -- like just samples of all the different types.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- and they'll taste so good, that I can never pick one out that I just have --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to have.
R:  Yeah, something where like that, where it's just -- you can't go wrong with anything you choose.
L:  So, what is your ideal meal?
R:  I guess I would have to say som- -- a nice Thai food dinner with maybe like, um, you know, those clear soups, and then some Pad Thai, which is like, uh, noodles with -- with egg, and then maybe like a tofu curry with potatoes and peas and stuff like that.  I really like the Thai food flavors 'cause you get like --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- sweet and sour, and spicy, and it's got a lot of flavor to it, so ...
L:  It certainly does.  It's --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I've found it a little too spicy for me.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I tend to stick to the -- the milder foods.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm a western, I'll admit it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Just ...
R:  Well, you know, that's all right.
L:  But, you know, I think --
R:  I like the spicy.
L:  -- if you can do the spicy, that's good.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's really good.  Most people I guess enjoy it, but I don't see how you can enjoy the food when your mouth is burning.
R:  Right.  That's a little too spicy, um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] The good -- the good Thai food restaurants, they -- they have a choice, like they -- they ask you, "Well, how spicy do you want it?"  You can kind of pick mild and medium and -- usually I don't go --
L:  And you go --
R:  -- for the hot.  I usually get a medium.
L:  Well, that's not too bad.
R:  Medium.  Or they have a number, like one through six and we -- you'll pick three or four.  Don't want to like, burn my taste buds off or anything. [LAUGH]
L:  Of course not.
R:  But ...
L:  You know, when you go out to eat, do you normally go to well established restaurants, or you go to, like Mom and Pop places?
R:  I kind of like the Mom and Pop places, or like the -- the, um, the Stanley[?] one, or the ones that aren't chain so much, just because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they tend to be less crowded, and you don't have to wait as long and stuff like that.
L:  I would agree.  I also like the -- usually the Mom and Pop places have more atmosphere and it's not as --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- contrived --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you -- you actually feel like you're getting something, whereas if you go to like a Chili's or an Olive Garden, you --
R:  Right.
L:  -- everyone's getting the same thing, and it just kind of takes the fun out of it.
R:  Yeah, the food's a little -- the food's a little more bland sometimes at some of those places like -- I mean, the good thing is you go, and you know that, like, you can go to an Olive Garden in California, Florida, anywhere, and you're going to pretty much be able to get the same thing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- which is kind of nice if you're travelling or something, but ...
L:  Well, when I travel --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I try the new places, but for some people, that -- having the familiarity is important.
R:  Right.  Or if you have picky eaters [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that you're going out with -- get something.  But, the only bad thing about the small places, is once in a while you go to one, and then it's gone.  They disappear out of nowhere sometimes.
L:  [LAUGH] --
R:  If they're st- --
L:  -- yeah --
R:  -- small places.
L:  -- that would be rough, especially --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- if you find a place that has good vegetarian food, and then it's gone.
R:  Right.  The next thing you know, you show up for dinner, and there's a big sign saying it's something else.  You're like, "Oh, man", yeah, but ...
L:  Yeah, I could appreciate that.
R:  But, probably part of the reason I like the small local places better is just in my area, that's -- there's a lot of them.  There's just tons and tons of restaurants here, so, it's kind of easier to f- -- even the -- the local ones, the smaller business are even more prevalent than the chains right around here, so ...
L:  Well, that's good.  Yeah, I live in --
R:  It's --
L:  -- a big metropolitan city where it's almost more of the big restaurants than the small ones.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  At least it feels that way, because everywhere I go, all I see are like chains.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  So, when you go out to eat, do you usually go with just like a couple of friends or a big group, by yourself?
L:  Normally it's just a couple of friends.  The big groups are fun, but they're always a lot of hassle --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because then you got to worry about making sure that everyone pays what they have to pay, and when --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you have a big group, then some people might flake out on paying their -- what they're supposed to pay --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so it -- it can be a hassle.
R:  Someone --
L:  A small group --
R:  -- always slips out early. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, y- -- or they -- they don't want to split it down evenly, they want to just pay for their one little piece and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- even though they did enjoy some of the appetizers, like, "Come on, just --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- put in the same amount and everyone's happy".
R:  Your tip always comes up short and someone ends up putting in extra money [LAUGH], usually not the person that -- that -- usually it's the person who already paid their fair share too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What do you prefer?
L:  Um, usually with one or -- just like one or two people, just a few, or maybe like three, hm, just usually not more than four of us go out at one time, except maybe on like a special occasion like someone's birthday or something like that, when --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's more like a big party kind of thing ...
