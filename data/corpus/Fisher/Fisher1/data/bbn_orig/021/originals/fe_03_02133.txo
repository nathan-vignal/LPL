L:  Hi, I'm Michaela.
R:  Hi, Michaela, this is Bob.
L:  How's it going?
R:  [SIGH] Okay.  How are you?
L:  [LAUGH] I'm fine. [SIGH]  So, what are you up for, a restaurant or eating at home?
R:  I'm for eating at a restaurant.
L:  Yeah, me too. [LAUGH]  What kind of food do you like?
R:  I eat steak.
L:  Oh, then that's funny because I'm a vegetarian. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, is that right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Where do you find vegetarian food at a restaurant?
L:  Well, I l- I live in New York City so there's plenty.
R:  Oh, there's plenty of vegetarian restaurants, huh?
L:  Exactly.
R:  Oh, I didn't know that.
L:  Mhm.  Where are you from?
R:  [SIGH] Cincinnati.
L:  Oh, wow, that's cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, there's lots of stuff here.  I mean in terms of vegan or just straight up vegetarian.
R:  Maybe if I have, ah -- maybe if they had good re- ah, vegetarian restaurants we might try 'em.
L:  What's that?
R:  I -- if they had good vegetarian restaurants here in Cincinnati I might try 'em.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, it might be kinda hard to find.  And I've done a lot of travelling and it's not always easy to find a -- you know, something that I can actually eat.
R:  I like a good salad though.
L:  Yeah, me too.  [SIGH] I think though a lot of times I like -- like the stuff they put in the salad, as opposed to like the lettuce and tomato.  Like Greek salads where you have, you know, cheese and all sorts of other stuff in it.
R:  I love cheese.
L:  Me too. [LAUGH] [NOISE]  Isn't Wisconsin known for that too?
R:  [NOISE] What?
L:  Isn't Wisconsin known for cheese too?
R:  Wisconsin?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's funny. [LAUGH]
R:  We're cheese heads. [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah.  I can't even cook at all.  So ...
R:  Oh, is that right?
L:  No. [LAUGH] So ...
R:  Do you fix salads?
L:  Oh, I do, but I'm lazy.  So I'm like one of those lazy vegetarians where it's like I'll just grab a slice of pizza if I'm not eating out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But ...
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I generally prefer to go out.
R:  Are vegetarian restaurants very expensive?
L:  [SIGH] Not really.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  It depends.  Some of them are a little bit more chi chi.
R:  I wouldn't think they were.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  That's what kills me.  It's like half the time going out with friends.  If they order like chicken or something else.  I wind up paying more.
R:  Oh, you can eat chicken?
L:  No, not even that. [MN]  That was actually the hardest thing to give up.
R:  [NOISE] What?
L:  Chicken.
R:  You had to give chicken up?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Is that -- [NOISE] I thought it was meat that meant vegetarian.
L:  No, everything.
R:  [MN]
L:  Anything [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that had a face [NOISE] basically. [LAUGH]
R:  That's fish even.
L:  Yeah, even fish.
R:  You gave up fish?
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] Gee whiz.
L:  Yeah.  I never had much of a taste for it anyway, so ...
R:  I love fish.
L:  Do you?
R:  I like chicken, meat.
L:  Mhm.
R:  What else do I like?  Ah, well, I don't know.  I like all kinds of pork.
L:  I know, this conversation's making me hungry now. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think I'm gonna hang up and go to lunch. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Or wait ten minutes and get your money.
L:  Ex- Exactly.
R:  Right.
L:  Have you done this -- like, ah, is this your first conversation --
R:  This is --
L:  -- or whatever?
R:  This is the first time I've done it today.
L:  Really?
R:  I won't be doing it anymore for a while I guess.
L:  Do they have a limit on how many -- I know you're supposed to do three, right?
R:  You can only do three.
L:  And I suppose like one a day or something?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH]  That's funny, it's so bizarre.  It's like, okay, talk about food. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's like I don't know what to say.  I'm not a cook and I don't do much cooking, or shopping for food or anything. [LAUGH]
R:  Yesterday we went to a Red Lobster.
L:  Oh really?
R:  A- and I -- well, you -- you can eat shrimp, can't you?
L:  No, afraid not.
R:  Shrimp don't have a face.
L:  I guess.  I don't know, I just never had much of a taste for it anyway, so ...
R:  [SIGH] Or --
L:  I never even tried shrimp to be honest. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  Was it good?
R:  Yeah, it was good.  I had shrimp and steak and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- mashed potatoes.
L:  [MN] My friend used to work at Red Lobster actually, and she used to be so fed up with people coming in and being like, "Oh, it's mostly seafood".  It's like, "Well, what did you think it was going to be, it's called Red Lobster". [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I was f- f- at first I was wary 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about going.  They'd been advertising their steak --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, we were driving by yesterday and, ah, "We'll have to stop in and see what they've got".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I s- looked at the thing, and they had a special menu for, um, [SIGH] for steak and shrim- shrimp.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They also had f- fillet mignon and New York strip.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I though I'd try -- I like sirloin very much.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it was a sirloin [NOISE] centre cut. [MN]
L:  And that's good stuff.
R:  Yeah, it's good stuff.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Did you used to eat meat?
L:  I did, yeah.  I mean fillet mignon used to be one of my favorites too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was a gradual thing.  It's like I -- basically I had to cut one thing out at a time.  You know, I couldn't just go cold turkey.  It's like I started with just cutting out cold cuts and then gradually made my way up to steak and chicken. [LIPSMACK]
R:  Oh, is that right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Sort of like quitting smoking?
L:  What's that?
R:  Sort of like quitting smoking?
L:  It is, yeah, you gotta take it one day at a time. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I could break it off pretty quick.  I could eat salad -- I could eat salad all the time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And cheese, you know, eat that.
L:  Yeah, that's the problem.  It's like you wind up eating stuff that's not always so good for you.  Like cheese, like eating a lot of it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But [LIPSMACK] it -- it's fine.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean living here in New York there's so many options.  And like I said there's so many restaurants that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- cater to it.  So it works out okay.  [SIGH] I'm not like one of those like obnoxious vegetarians that if someone is eating steak in -- in front of me I'll be like, "Oh, my God.  Do you know what you're ...?" you know.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  I keep it to myself 'cause I know when I ate it nobody really could have changed my mind until I made the decision for myself.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Well, I quit smoking seven years ago.
L:  Did you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.  I wish some of my friends would. [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] I can't stand to be around people smoking.
L:  How'd you do it?
R:  [MN]
L:  Just --
R:  Well, I -- 
L:  -- cold turkey or ...?
R:  I was dropping off.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Getting down, and down, and down [SIGH] and, um, to two a -- well, I was getting down to one a hour.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] And my doctor said, "You gotta quit".
L:  Yeah.
R:  "You got high blood pressure, you got diabetes."
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  "And you got, ah, cholesterol problems."
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  "Something's gonna happen if you keep smoking."
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  So, I quit.  Ah, he said, "What you gotta do is just reduce the amount of cigarettes you smoke every week".
L:  Mhm.
R:  "Every week take one cigarette out of your daily allotment."
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or, one cigarette less an hour.
L:  Wow.
R:  I was smoking one an hour at the time.
L:  Oh, my gosh. [SIGH]
R:  So, ah --
L:  Okay. [NOISE]
R:  So, I, um, cut out one cigarette, or a -- a certain number of cigarettes every day.  And within thr- a months' time I was down to one a day.
L:  That's awesome.  Wow.
R:  And then I w- went with one a day, just for f- four days.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I said, "That's enough"
L:  Wow. [SIGH]
R:  And I was -- like I said, I wouldn't dare.  My wife doesn't drink, or smoke now.  She quit smoking when I did.  [SIGH] But, I know she can't drink.  And I know that I can't take that first cigarette or I'll be back on it.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] [SIGH]  It's like the second you taste it again, it's gonna all come back to you.
R:  Well, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, it does.  It -- it becomes -- it's just a -- it's a -- it's a drug.
L:  Mhm.  [SIGH] It definitely is.
R:  It's an amphetamine actually.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH] Wow.  Did you have cravings afterwards --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or did it pretty much dissipate?
R:  Well, I had cravings, yeah, in fact I would think about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'd crave 'em but it would go away.  It wasn't too bad because I leveled out over a period of six or seven months.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, when I finally broke off I didn't have as much nicotine built up in my system.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] Which is a very powerful drug.
L:  It is, definitely.
R:  Why they allow that to be legal, I don't know.
L:  I know, that what kills me.  It's so argh and I --
R:  But they're cracking down on it.
L:  They sure are, they just outlawed it here in New York.  All the bars -- you can't smoke in the bars anymore.
R:  Well they, um, most restaurants you, ah, -- well the -- ah, most restau- restaurants they have two sections.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Smoking and non smoking.
L:  Right.
R:  We don't go to bars of course.  But ...
L:  Yeah.  It's for the ba-
R:  Some have a bar attached.  And if people are smoking at the bar --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then it drifts into the restaurant.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  It kinda makes it moot, even separating it.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] It's kinda like when they used to have smoking and non smoking on a plane.  It's like, what's the point? [LAUGH]  Have one little barrier up.
R:  Boy, that plane travel is dangerous these days.
L:  [LIPSMACK] What's that?
R:  With SARS.
L:  Oh, yeah, it's crazy.  It's like the plague.
R:  That's all -- you know, [NOISE] a- they don't take s- air in from outside you know?
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's just so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, it seems like every day on the news it's something worse, when it come-
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's just a creepy kinda thing.  Anyone who went to Asia I feel sorry for.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Well, um, it -- it's dangerous the whole thing.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  And it's hurting the economy.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, that too.  I mean, everything's just kinda weird right now.
R:  Air bonds are going down, travel's going down.
L:  I know at least --
R:  Because the people aren't staying in the hotels, going travelling.
L:  At least you can get cheaper plane tickets. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's the only positive thing to come out of it. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  But, yeah, everything else, not too good.
R:  We can get a round trip from Indianapolis to Los Angles for a hundred and fifteen dollars a piece.
L:  Wow!  That's pretty sweet.
R:  From Indianapolis.  We have to travel up to Indianapolis though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So, we don't -- we don't travel.
L:  What's that?
R:  We don't travel.
L:  No, not much?
R:  No.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We would much rather stay around here, [SIGH] and just go to restaurants --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and stay in hotels around here and do what we want to do.
L:  I hear you.  [LAUGH]
R:  You don't have to go to some foreign city to enjoy it. [NOISE]
L:  Exactly.  And then --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it gets old pretty quickly.  You know especially with everything going on right now.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  What do you do there?  What kind
