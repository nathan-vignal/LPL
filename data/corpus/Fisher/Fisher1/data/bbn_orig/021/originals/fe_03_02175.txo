R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name's Lois.
L:  And Lois, this is Bill.  Where --
R:  Hi, Bill.
L:  -- are you from?
R:  Um, Clovis City, California.
L:  Oh, we're in the same state.  I- I'm out in Hemet.  Know where that is?
R:  Yes, yes I do.
L:  Okay.  About ninety miles from you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Roughly.
R:  Have you done this before?
L:  [SIGH] I did it once before.  Have you?
R:  No.  This is -- this is my first time on one of these phone conversation things --
L:  Oh, kind of neat.
R:  -- so, I've done focus groups, you know, where you sit around in a circle, but not, uh, the telephone interview.
L:  Okay, we're supposed to talk about eating out [SIGH], or eating at home.
R:  Or e- eating at home.  What is your favorite?
L:  Oh, you know, I'm always a guy that has so many likes, [SIGH] and not too many dislikes, and I like variety in life.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, so, um, [LAUGH] it's a tough answer, that question.  I can't really say I re- -- prefer either over the other [SIGH], uh, but we can discuss this, um, um, do you have s- -- uh, a definite preference?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I guess I would, if I had to choose one, I would choose eating out at a restaurant --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because I didn't have to prepare it. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, and that's a perspective a woman would look at, right?
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, for sure. [SIGH] And I'm one of these guys, who enjoys, uh, fixing things at home.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, I've been a widower now --
R:  You like to cook?
L:  Um, yeah, I like to try new stuff and so on, although I haven't done so much experimenting lately, just because of [SIGH] time pressures.  I just -- I eat very healthy, uh, and, uh, basic stuff, [LAUGH] you know. [SIGH] But, uh, I, in fact -- er, I was distracted when doing a little internet work, uh, er, this morning, and -- and looking at some emails and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- uh, noticed one of them had some [SIGH] great, uh, food, um, source opportunities --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, uh, so, I thought, "Wow, this is rad".  That took me time to -- to make a few notes and -- and jot down a few sites [SIGH].
R:  Have you gone to the -- is it Epicurious site?
L:  That's exactly the one I was going to mention.
R:  Were you?  Okay, 'cause that's a great site.
L:  I just found out about that this morning.  And do you know how I found out about it?  I -- I'm, uh, at Bertlink[?] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- as a server, and, uh, they have a letter that goes -- a newsletter that goes out every Monday to, uh [SIGH] those of us who use it, and, uh, they were mentioning a number of different food sites, [SIGH] and that was, uh, one of the first ones.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, uh --
R:  Yeah, a friend --
L:  -- the other --
R:  -- of mine told me about it, um, a couple of months ago, and it's just a great place.  If, you know, you want to think of, "What -- what can I do with zucchini and cheese or something" you know, and -- [SIGH] and you put in the ingredients, and it brings up all re- -- all kinds of recipes for you.
L:  You know, that's one of the things I was looking for.  I thought, "You know, if I like in my refriger- -- in a refrigerator and -- and say -- [SIGH] think to myself, 'I got, you know [SIGH] X, Y, Z, A, B, C, and, so, what -- what would I do for using most of those ingredients in something?".  But you can do that there?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, yeah, you can do --
L:  I'll have --
R:  -- you know, it's got a -- a -- argh, I think it's got, for ingredients side or something like that.  It's got a -- you know, you type in a couple ingredients --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or, [SIGH] uh, my husband's vegetarian, so, a lot of times I'll go on there for a new vegetarian recipe, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but you know, I -- I can see sometimes, I'd rather eat at home because you don't have to get dressed up or changed to go out to a restaurant --
L:  Um ...
R:  -- you know.
L:  Yeah, so, there are -- there are advantages both ways --
R:  There are.
L:  -- obviously.  And, uh, I've been a widower now, for, uh, about six -- going on six years this summer, and, uh --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [SIGH] one of these older guys that would probably like to find a mate again, and I thought --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- "You know, I hope -- I hope I could find somebody who loves to entertain" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause I would love to have a really -- a really efficient kitchen, with all you need --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to [SIGH] -- to, um, uh -- you know, plenty of counter space and all of new kitch- -- you know, the right kitchen --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- gadgets and so forth. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it's fun to cook --
L:  So ...
R:  -- you know.  I mean --
L:  And it would be fun to --
R:  -- if you have the time --
L:  -- work with somebody.
R:  Right, right --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- you know.
L:  -- I -- I was married --
R:  Do a stir --
L:  -- to a woman who --
R:  -- fry together --
L:  -- I was married to a woman who, uh, loved to cook --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- everybody liked her cooking, and, uh, I really appreciated the fact she never minded having my family over, [SIGH], uh, for company, you know, on holidays and stuff --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and she was just great as far as that's concerned. [SIGH] But her problem was, she wanted to do it all herself --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it was like, uh, and she considered her kitchen corner, "My L" --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, "Get out of my L" [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But you know --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- when you -- when you'd have a company, it's kind of interesting, um, I'd be touching up things in the yard or one thing or another, and all of a sudden, you know, we're getting close to the time they're coming, and she'd call me, "Bill" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] uh, "Could you come in and fix the salad". [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  So, that's how I --
R:  So, you got a chance then, to get your hands in --
L:  That's how I --
R:  -- the kitchen --
L:  -- learned to --
R:  -- a little bit.
L:  -- make great salads.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I just love to put ten, twelve, fourteen good ingredients in the salad.
R:  What's your favorite kind of salad?
L:  Well, actually, [SIGH] um, it's, uh, m- mixed vegetables, an- and just a bunch of things, whether it's, you know, like kind of mushrooms and olives, and of course lettuce and carrots and cauliflower --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and -- [SIGH] and, uh, broccoli, and, um, carrots, and celery and -- [SIGH] it's not that there's -- it's anything uncommon --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just a l- -- a -- a ton of common ingredients I'll --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- have put in, and, uh, I'm one that believes in finer chopping, so, you don't have chunks that are too big.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We were discussing -- 'cause I'm a member of a [SIGH] -- of a men's singles small group -- we had a meeting, uh, last night, and one of the things I brought, uh, a couple of months ago -- we meet once a month -- [SIGH] was a tossed salad, and everybody loves it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, uh, the way that was -- and it's -- it's just a lot of work, dicing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- cutting, slicing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, cubing and all that stuff, but I don't mind it.
R:  It is.  That's why, if we got out to eat and there's like a salad -- one of my favorite restaurants is California Pizza Kitchen.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Have you ate there?  They have wonderful salads.  They have chopped salad, they have a barbecue [SIGH] um, ch- -- I think it's called barbecued chicken chopped salad --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's actually -- it's got, um -- [LIPSMACK] they put like, um, black beans in it and corn in it, and then little tiny tortilla strips on top.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  It's just something different, you know, 'cause -- oh, and then they put, um, hickama in it.
L:  Oh, my --
R:  Ever put --
L:  -- oh, I --
R:  -- hickama in your --
L:  -- I love --
R:  -- salad?
L:  -- that in fact, yes, I l- -- it's -- it's -- it's got a nice crunchy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh --
R:  It really does, without, you know --
L:  -- texture to it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, I've used that.  Haven't used it for -- for quite a while, [SIGH] but I'd like to -- I have been on a track on some business things on the internet that has really occupied m- my full attention --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for some time, and -- and since I'm alone, and nobody else to bother me -- I have three daughters, one of them lives in -- in Torrance, which isn't too far --
R:  Uh-huh, not too far.
L:  -- from you.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, yeah, but, uh, I've had hundreds of hours of time to get involved in some things that are going to pay off real well, [SIGH] and, so, I just haven't had -- taken time to -- and I love to eat out, but I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- haven't eaten out that much [SIGH] really over the last two or three years, and -- and since I don't mind cooking for myself, [SIGH] so, um -- [LIPSMACK] oh, and -- and -- be- before the -- we get, uh, notice that the end of this is coming --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you might, as far as the internet side's concerned, another one they mentioned was Chow Hound.
R:  Chow Hound?  C.H.O.W.?
L:  C.H.O.W. --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  H.O.U.N.D. dot com.
R:  Hm.
L:  Uh, forward slash, Maine, M.A.I.N.E. --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- dot, H.T.M.L.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That looked absolutely fantastic, for finding eating places --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- go -- to go out around L.A. and wherever, you just can --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- plug in a city.  Just for kicks I just put in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the search, uh, Studio City --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I was amazed at, uh -- at what was turned up, etcetera, but [SIGH] you know, all kinds of, uh -- and there are sites that, um, [SIGH] when you travel -- are travelling --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you can, uh, put in the city and it just [SIGH] -- and in fact o- one of them, uh, oh, f- -- do you travel much?
R:  Not too much.  No, uh, my sister's --
L:  Are you a stay at home m- --
R:  -- out in -- well, no, I'm -- actually I work part time, but, um [LIPSMACK], because I work part time, you know, I cannot eat out as much as, or -- or travel as much.  Um, probably, about the farthest I go now, is -- my mom's down in San Diego, my sister's out in Valencia --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, you know, a couple of hours each way, maybe, you know --
L:  Are you a s- -- are you a stay at home mom?
R: Um, not really.  I work part time --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so, my hours are flexible.
L:  Sort of?
R:  Sort of.
L:  Do you have kids?
R:  A sort of -- a sort of stay at home mom, I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  Do you have kids?  Are your kids --
R:  I do, I do --
L:  -- grown up?
R:  -- I've got two older and a younger one. My oldest is in college.
L:  Oh, oh, oh, oh, that fun age --
R:  So ...
L:  -- um, I kind of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm still fe- -- sort of suffering I think from [SIGH] the emptiness syndrome.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, but, uh --
R:  Well, losing your wife too, that --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- that's got to be hard, and as she --
L:  Well, it has b- --
R:  -- was the one that did all the cooking --
L:  It has been --
R:  -- you know --
L:  -- for a few years.  But, I didn't get married until I was thirty two, so, I know how --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to live on my own well, and take care of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- myself [LAUGH], and cook, and [SIGH] -- and all that good stuff.
R:  Oh, well, that's good.
L:  Here's a couple of other things that you might find interesting, uh, one of them's called City Search, if you travel --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or if you have a travelling husband.  I used to travel in the eighties --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a lot, and was all over the States. [SIGH] I had to settle down 'cause my kids were getting junior high age, and I really needed to be home more, [SIGH] and another one is State Guide for travel --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- just --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- S.T.A.T.E. Guide, [SIGH] dot com.  Yeah, so, there's a couple of the great ones.  Well, I'm surprised our ten minutes aren't up already, but just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- waiting for them to say [SIGH] -- this is your first time, you said?
R:  Yeah, this is.  So, at the end, do they say your ten minutes --
L:  They announce it --
R:  -- is up?
L:  -- you've got -- we've got thirty seconds left.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And so forth.  So, [SIGH], um --
R:  So, do you barbecue or -- or as far as like cooking outside, at home?
L:  Do -- do I?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, well, we used to.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I -- I haven't.  I l- -- I -- oh, with down[?] time[?], I'm having to live in an apartment now.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's -- it's for an apartment, it's great.
