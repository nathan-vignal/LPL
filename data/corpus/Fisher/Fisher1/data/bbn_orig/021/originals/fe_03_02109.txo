R:  Hi, I'm Hilary.
L:  I'm Lisa. [LAUGH] And I didn't hear 'cause I was switching phones [LAUGH] so I don't even know what we're supposed to be discussing.
R:  Uh, we're supposed to be talking about friends, if we have lots of friends or if we just have acquaintances.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.  Um, well, myself I've got quite a few, um, acquaintances.  I have a few close friends, um --
R:  Are your close friends from growing up?
L:  [LIPSMACK] You know I've got a couple that are, um, but I think the majority of them are like people I go to church with and stuff.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, um, are yours, er -- how -- how is your friend life? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um, I actually have, let's see -- I would say my best friends are from high school.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, some of those people have obviously drifted.
L:  Right.
R:  But -- and then I would say I have a few friends from college, um, but again we've all drifted into our own direction.
L:  Right.
R:  And then I recently moved to a new city in the past two years and I've made a good group of core friends here.
L:  Great.
R:  But I prefer -- I used to have a lot of friends --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I could never keep in touch with them all but now I just, kind of, have like I said my core group and that's who I talk to weekly or daily.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I've got -- I don't know, I have a lot of, um [MN] -- um, well, I -- my husband and I have a business and we -- we have a lot of friends that we deal with through our business, too.  I've made quite a few friends and, um, I have some that are all over the place, in Washington and -- [LAUGH]
R:  Oh yeah, that's what happens as we get older.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you think it's harder as we're older to make friends?
L:  I think so, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I do, personally.  I think it is, yeah, but --
R:  [MN] There's not an instant, like, connection like when you go to high school --
L:  Mm mm.
R:  -- you're stuck with those people all day or when you go to college you see them in the same classes and the same social outings and then if -- I don't know if you went to graduate school but I did but you still have planned activities but since then it's been very hard to meet new friends.
L:  Yeah, I think so, too, 'cause everybody is so set in just doing their everyday thing and --
R:  True.
L:  -- they just and, you know, do -- I mean, I think it's very rare -- true best best friend, I think, is very -- it's very rare.
R:  Yes, I agree.
L:  Um --
R:  I work in a environment where I'm the youngest -- I'm a school teacher.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And I work in a inner city school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And most of the teachers actually grew up in that neighborhood.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I'm a minority there, not just by age but also by race.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I don't have -- I haven't -- I'm unlike you in that I haven't made friends through my work environment.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But that's okay because then it's more on a professional level.
L:  Right, yeah, that's true, that's true.  And, I think, even in -- in the work field it's hard to -- to make friends.  I mean, it -- it's just -- it's -- it's different.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It is.  Relationships are different but I --
R:  My parents, I -- go ahead, were you going to --
L:  No, that's fine, go ahead.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's so difficult.  My parents, um, met when they were thirteen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- which is very rare.
L:  Wow.
R:  But my point of saying that is that they've been each other's best friends since the age of thirteen.
L:  Wow.
R:  And they have very few couple friends to go out to dinner with or go --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Social -- you know, to social outings with.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, we've been discussing my wedding and things and we've been noticing how I don't have that many people to throw showers for me or, you know --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- host the brunch or host events because they've just kinda kept to themselves [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  So they haven't made many friends because they met at such a young age.
L:  Wow.  I know my husband and I, we -- we've been like really good friends.  I -- we've been married for, um, going on a year but we've known each other --
R:  Oh.
L:  We've actually been friends for twelve years. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, isn't that a neat story, yes.
L:  Yeah, so, I mean we've known --
R:  So a friendship turned into something more in that instance.
L:  Yeah, it did, it really did, and -- and it's been just the most wonderful thing ever and, um, I -- I know that since we -- we've recently just moved and -- as well, and, um, we're right now -- when we moved here we knew nobody at all [LAUGH].
R:  Oh wow, so you have met a lot of people since you moved?
L:  Yeah, we have, we really have and our -- I think our business has helped a lot with that, too, so that we came -- we came to a more heavily populated area --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and we have, um, our -- our business has really taken off up here and -- and a lot of people have, um, um, become friends, you know, sort of, kind of, through -- through our business.
R:  Right. [MN]
L:  I mean, of course, you have, you know, the ones that are -- are more close to you than others but --
R:  Uh-huh.  Do you think if you were not married you -- it would be easier to make friends if you moved somewhere new or do you think it's easier being married 'cause you have a partner to go out with to meet other people with?
L:  You know I -- I don't know really.  I -- I don't know 'cause, um -- I don't know.  What do you think about that?  I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  I think it's hard.  I -- I moved here and knew just my best friend and my boyfriend at the time.
L:  Mm.
R:  And because they had been here for a year I met all their friends.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I think if I moved here by myself I would have been too shy, probably, to go out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess, you know, I would have joined -- I joined a running group.  Like you said, through your church you've also made friends.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I guess by joining different organizations that's an easy way to make friends.
L:  That's true, I think so.
R:  But it's still hard --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- because it's not like that constant companionship and you see 'em all the time.
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause my organizations that I've tried to make new friends with, um -- it's just not the same, I guess.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause you don't see 'em on a daily basis.
L:  Right, that's true.
R:  [MN]
L:  That is true and then that's so hard even, you know, like when you are in school and in college and stuff, when you do make those buddies and then, you know, everybody kind of goes their own way and it's like, "Oh me" and you think about somebody, it's like, "I wonder what they're doing".
R:  Mm.
L:  "I wonder where they're at" you know.
R:  Mhm, that's true.
L:  And -- because it does -- it's hard to keep in touch, it is.
R:  It -- yes, it is especially after people start having babies and --
L:  Yeah, and get married and --
R:  [LAUGH] Everyone starts to drift.  Well, another aspect of friends, uh, is, um -- obviously, since I'm a teacher I can talk about my students and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- who I see as friendly and those who are not and obviously in the friend circle of young children there are the bullies who --
L:  Ya.
R:  -- children are friends with them 'cause they're afraid of them.
L:  Ya.
R:  And then there's the shy children who have no friends 'cause they don't have any social skills.
L:  Right.
R:  I guess, may be why.
L:  Right.
R:  But it's very interesting to see the mixture of my classrooms and see who is friends with who and who's singled out.
L:  Right.
R:  It's kind of sad.  I don't know if y'all have any children?
L:  Yeah, we have, we have four, actually. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh my!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Do they have a lot of friends?
L:  Um --
R:  Or are they young young young?
L:  They're -- they're -- my oldest is nine and he's very well populated.  I mean, he has got friends left and right and it's like people just flock to him but my youngest boy, he's seven, and he has a really hard time making friends.  I --
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, he's like the -- my oldest one's like the leader and my -- my younger one he's kind of like the follower and he --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  He's really cautious with who he hangs out with and -- and does things with, you know, and, um, he's more cautious than my oldest one.  My oldest one just kinda does -- I don't know.  I don't know if you would even call my oldest one a leader, he might be kind of a follower [LAUGH] 'cause he kind of does whatever anybody else does but --
R:  But is he more -- he's more outgoing --
L:  Yeah.
R:   -- than the younger son?
L:  Well --
R:  The youngest.
L:  Somewhat.  I mean, my other one is, too.  They both play a lot of sports and stuff like that so they make friends, you know, through their sports but it just seems like my oldest one he's just got that natural, I don't know, friend making thing going on or something [LAUGH] 'cause he --
R:  That's interesting.
L:  Yeah, it is, it's -- it's -- and my two girls, they're younger, they're, like, five and four, so their friends kind of just -- [MN] I don't know if you -- my -- my five year old she made her first real true friend, I think, this year in kindergarten and, um --
R:  How cute.
L:  -- she's been calling her and stuff [LAUGH] you know and --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They talk on the phone at that age?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, I didn't know.
L:  Yeah, and my older kids, you know, they -- the two -- the two boys, they really never, at kindergarten, they never were calling people or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- going over to people's house and stuff.  They weren't doing that type of thing but, I don't know, it -- it's kind of weird how -- how generations and years go by, how things change, you know, and --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- she's -- she -- I don't know, she seems to have made, um, friends a little easier but --
R:  Do you -- do you notice that the girls have more friends than the boys may -- I mean, I don't know if you can generalize girls versus boys any -- anyway but --
L:  Yeah, um, my -- like I said, my oldest one, he -- he is pretty much the -- the ruler of [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- friends.  I mean [LAUGH] he has got a lot of friends, he's got a few and, I mean, it's so funny 'cause we could go to a park and, um, he -- he could make a friend just automatically, just -- he'll walk up to somebody and start talking.
R:  Oh my.
L:  But, like, the other kids, they're kinda more laid-back, kind of shy type kids.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They don't -- they're kinda of nervous to go, you know, say anything so it's really weird how -- how their personalities are and I think that has a lot to do with friends, too, personalit-
