R:  [NOISE] Ah, my favorite +actually would be eating at home, having a steak dinner with baked potato, steak medium [SIGH] well, green garden salad on the side with a bit of thousand island dressing, and just kicking back and chilling. [LAUGH] That's about all I can think of. [NOISE]
L: [NOISE] Oh, wow. You sound exactly like the type of food that I would be eating. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I -- I -- I like a meal that keeps you full. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I'm telling you. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and it's all the things they tell you, "Don't eat this", and, "Don't eat that". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And --
R:  Hey, well ... [LAUGH]
L:  And another thing.  Did you notice too, that sometimes um, they'll tell you, "Don't take butter", and then the next minute they'll say, "Don't take ah, margarine"?  That this one's bad or that one's bad. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you know, damned if you do, damned if you don't. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I have an uncle.  He was -- oh, God -- he died, I think, when he was about eighty two or something --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and ah, he ate hot dogs all the time --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and they say that hot dogs are bad for you and looked how long he lived.
R:  He lived a long time, didn't he? [LAUGH]
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, we ah, -- you just never know any more.  I don't know -- I think it's a little bit of anything.  We're all gonna die [several inaudible words].  Might as well eat happy and live happy.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Gee, you -- you're such a happy go lucky person.  That's --
R:  [LAUGH] I -- this the -- this is -- this is the way I am. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  What state are you in?
R:  Texas.
L:  Oh, no wonder.
R:  [LAUGH] Where're you at?
L:  I'm in Connecticut.
R:  Connecticut.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm just a happy, bubbly kinda person.  I don't know when. [LAUGH] Everybody's always telling me that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's how I am.  I'm always laughing, because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- e- everything's an individual choice.  Either you wanna be happy --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- or you wanna be sad.
R:  I know.  You know, life's too short to be sad.  Y- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And all that's going on in the world today --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I just try to make the best of everything.
R:  That's for me too.  Me too, yeah.
L:  Because if -- if you keep going around all the time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- crying about this --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- crying about that, before you know it you're so miserable. [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] That's right.  I've had some bad things in my past life that, you know, [NOISE] i- -- i- -- it just kinda devastates you, but you know, you can't dwell on the bad things, and it -- it -- some bad things happen, regardless. [NOISE]  No matter what.  So you just gotta be [NOISE] happy.  I mean, try to be anyhow. [SIGH] Um, that's just the way of life, I'm thinking.  I -- I don't -- like I said, life's too short and I don't like to be [NOISE] walking round with a frown on my face, you know. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, that's true.  I just heard something on the TV.  Gee, I think it was just yesterday.  And they said that, ah, about people will say, "Oh, that person has a skeleton in their closet" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and they say, "Well, guess what?  Everybody's got a skeleton in their closet". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's probably true, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That is so true.
L:  Because --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- there's something a family member --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it could be a brother, a sister, an aunt, an uncle, anybody.
R:  That's right.
L:  And something went on.  But --
R:  There you got it.
L:  -- you have to concentrate on the good things, instead of --
R:  I --
L:  -- concentrating on all of that stuff.
R:  That's right.  But if go and you sa- -- and you dwell on the bad things in your life -- my gosh, the whole world's gonna be unhappy.
L:  Right.
R:  And --
L:  And I noticed that ah, that -- that as you get older in +life, the more you don't take so -- you know, you don't take things to heart so much.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  You're right.  You're right. [LAUGH] I think you're a- -- I've never talked about that, but [MN] I mean, I've gone there and th- that's the way I feel.
L:  Yeah, and when you're young you take everything like, "Oh, this is it", and that's why I think --
R:  It's like, a disaster.  Yeah.
L:  That's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- why I think all those things like, ah, the things you hear on the news with the kids in the high school going nuts --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and everything.
R:  Ahah.
L:  Because they're taking everything like "This is it", and --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you know.  You have to just wait.  I remember, years ago, when I was young.  You know you go through those stages, "Oh, life isn't worth living", and all this --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that.
R:  Right.
L:  And my friend told me -- he says, "Oh, don't feel that way".  He says, "Don't you want to be around to see curtain going up".
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  So he says, "Look at life like a stage show, you know, you wanna see what's the next act is.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I never forgot that.  Because if you look at --
R:  Yeah, that's a very good example.
L:  Yeah, if you look at life like it's just a show, you wanna see what's gonna happen. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Let's see what's behind the next curtain. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  And -- oh, I know what I was gonna ask you.  How's the job situation in Texas?
R:  Well, [SIGH] pretty tight, but I -- I think it has gotten better.
L:  Yeah.  B- --
R:  Um, there's still a lot -- so many people unemployed.  I mean, I was unemployed for a while and jobs were just not out there.  You couldn't get a job.  I mean, it is really sad because like, all these older people -- like my mother for example.  Twenty eight years in one company and she was fifty eight years old.  Well they -- they're forcing them to retire, and you know, th- -- so they hire somebody who had a lower income and all.  And it's not -- it's just awful.  It's sad.
L:  That's what they're doing now.
R:  It is so sad.  'Cause at -- at that age my mother wasn't old enough to draw all her social security and she wasn't old enough -- I mean, she -- she couldn't live off of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what, you know -- the little bit that was coming in.
L:  Right, yeah.  [MN]
R:  And then you gotta try and find a job at that age and nobody wants you.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And that's -- tell me that ain't discrimination.  And my mama took, I think, two and a half years to find a job, bless her heart, and it was awful.  You know, she'd go from like, maybe ten bucks at sh- -- an hour to hardly any, at six or seven, and, you -- yeah, something like that.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  But you -- it -- it is times are very tough.  If you -- if you got a job you better hang onto it around here, 'cause they're few and far between.
L:  And that's what I tell everybody.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I don't care if --
L:  It's not if --
R:  You don't --
L:  If you work and you hate your job --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and you don't like this one --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- or don't like that one, just be quiet and just say it's just a pay check and just --
R:  And be thankful you have a pay check coming in.  You're right.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Oh, absolutely.  You know, 'cause [SIGH] if you -- like I say, if you got a job you better keep it, [inaudible] you like it or not, un- -- unless you got to find one first, you know, and that's -- they're hard to find.  I'm -- I -- talking from experience, I -- I just, you know.  I moved to another city, um, in December and of course I didn't look for a job immediately, so around January I started actually looking, and I finally -- it took me about a month before I found a job, you know I'd have all these interviews or go -- put in applications among two hundred and three hundred others you know.  They may call you back, but it's pretty tough.
L:  Yeah, where in the past -- gee, five years ago there were so many jobs and there weren't [LAUGH] enough people to fill --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- them. [LAUGH]
R:  You didn't have to worry about any, you know.  If you walked out mad and decided to quit, you could. [LAUGH] But now, golly, don't walk out. [LAUGH] You better keep what you got. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, because that's exactly what happened to me.  I got laid off --
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH]
L:  -- and sometime I get just in the dumps, you know that --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- there is no work.
R:  I know it.  You got that right.
L:  So, I've gotten to the same point too, just like your mom --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  I figure I'm going to go below my education --
R:  [NOISE] It's sad that you have to though, [NOISE] you know, but if you want an income, you have to.
L:  Right.
R:  It -- it -- it's just that -- it's like starting all over again. [NOISE]
L:  And just, ah, take a job and just start, because you know, I say the thing is gonna open up again.
R:  I -- I think so. [NOISE] I really do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I think everything's the same way their end.
L:  Yeah, 'cause you know, what goes around, it comes back again.
R:  I -- there's my phil- -- that's my strong thoughts I [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It is true.  So, but what about this -- this call thing.  Have you done this before?
L:  Ah --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I've done it a couple of times.  
R:  [SIGH]
L:  They say that they just like to hook you up with people to see you know, they're taking a survey, to see what kinds of food people like and --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- if everybody's in the same category and if --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people follow --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what they hear.
R:  Right.
L:  And I don't know, I'd find it's interesting.  Because they're --
R:  Well, you're my first one.
L:  Everybody that you talk to, believe it or not, they're real friendly.  That's what I can't believe.
R:  How cool.  Well, you're the first call that I've a- -- I've had.  'Cause I, you know, I just started doing it and you're my first one. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And I'm really enjoying it, talking to you.  You're just really nice [inaudible] lady. [SIGH]
L:  Wow.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's what I've figured too.  You know, because sometime you get people and they'll say, "Oh, I don't have any time for all of this --"
R:  [COUGH]
L:  "-- nonsense".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's crazy.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  Right.
L:  So, but ah, it is.  You don't know who you're gonna meet and then you find out everybody's in the same boat and everybody's thinking the same way, and --
R:  That's pretty interesting.
L:  -- everybody likes the same kinda foods and all.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So it is -- it's really amazing.
R:  Yeah, it's very interesting, you learn a lot from 'em then.  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  That's cool.
L:  All right then.
R:  Well, it's been nice talking with you.
L:  Yeah, you too.
R:  And take care.
L:  And I say the same thing, and gee, you never know who you're gonna meet in l- life.  And I feel like I'm kinda talking to myself.
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's wonderful, then isn't it? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so its --
R:  Ah, that's great.  Well thank you.
L:  It's just amazing.
R:  That's sweet.
L:  Well, anyway, you have a real good evening.
R:  Thanks, hon, you too.
L:  And take care of yourself.
R:  Oh, you do the same.
L:  All right.
R:  Okay, bye.
