R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, this is Dimitrius.
R:  This is Anne.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm good.
R:  So, we're supposed to talk about friends?
L:  I think so. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I went -- I went out with two of my girlfriends last weekend.  They're kind of, um, newer friends, I've known, um, one of them for about a year.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, we actually met on the internet, um, in a, you know, in a -- like a community, a running community.  We were both looking for a running partner.
L:  Gotcha.
R:  So, um, she answered my ad and, um, we started running together.  She was new to -- newer to running and, um, so now we hang out together a lot.  She's from Texas and, um, she's -- when we go -- go out together we get a lot of attention 'cause she's, like, six foot four.
L:  [LAUGH] I can imagine.
R:  Yeah, so -- so, we go running a lot together and my boyfriend and I go eat over there a lot and [NOISE] her boyfriend does all the cooking so it's cool.  And she has kids and I have kids but ... What about -- what about your friends?
L:  I've pretty much had the same friends since I was about ten years old.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, so, pretty much the same group of five or six friends.  Like, there's a couple of, like, new friends I made when I went to college but it's pretty much, you know, the same people, so, yeah -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  And I've known 'em, for most of them, like twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen years.  So I usually hang out with them with every weekend.  We'll talk on the phone every other day, I guess, yeah, if not every day so -- yeah.
R:  How old are you?
L:  Twenty five, twenty four.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  So ...
R:  Well, that makes sense when you said twelve or fifteen years. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's like I went -- yeah, 'cause I went to school with them.  Like it was like this, uh, private school from, like, kindergarten to twelfth grade and I went there from, like, fifth grade.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So pretty much the kids stayed the same every year.  So I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- knew them through middle school and high school and then I guess as we all went off to college we still were, like, friends, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Summers or holidays or whatever, we'd be at home, still hanging out, so -- pretty much all live in the same area.
R:  And you've stayed put and all that?  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, like, even -- yeah, even the ones that have gone away, like, they've either come back or, like, maybe the one -- one that lives, like, maybe ninety minutes away or two hours away so, yeah, a couple of us will go take a trip up or a trip down.
R:  So -- so, really close knit group?
L:  Yeah, pretty much.
R:  What -- what state are you in?
L:  Uh, Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  So actually I -- my friends either live in Philadelphia, New York or, like, D.C. so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's real easy to get to those cities.  I was actually just in New York last weekend with a couple of them for one of my friend's birthdays so ...
R:  Yeah.  Well, I'm -- I'm in California and everybody kind of moves away, you know.
L:  Yeah, actually my -- my roommate in college was from California and he moved to Atlanta but he's actually going to move back to California so ...
R:  Yeah, well I -- I went to my, um, twenty year reunion a couple of years ago.  I'm forty so [LAUGH] um -- and, you know, all these people moved away and most of them -- I -- I stayed put, I still live in the same city I was born --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and raised in but I -- I do have one friend still, um, from high school that I've known since I was fourteen.  She's one of my best friends but [SIGH] -- but she gets -- she has kind of a weird life and she's hard to get a hold of and [LAUGH] um --
L:  [LAUGH] No, I guess they say when people get married, like, your -- your friends,  they're not -- they don't change but it's not like, I guess, uh -- it's not as important as it used to be, especially when you start getting married and having kids.
R:  Yeah, because ideally the -- the person that you're married to should be your best friend.
L:  Gotcha.
R:  But you still should have your friends -- your own friends, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's not -- see, I made that mistake when I was married that, um, I -- I didn't want my, um, husband to have friends that weren't my friends, too, you know.  I didn't want him to go out without me.  I thought his friends invited him, I ought to be able to go along, too.
L:  Mm.
R:  So I would really nag him and not want him --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to go out and stuff.  So now I -- now I really regret that and now my nineteen year old daughter has gotten married and so I've given her some advice about that, you know.  Let her husband have his friends. [LAUGH] He's kinda taking advantage of it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and going out partying every night but he's only twenty one so ... But, um, she's letting him have his friends.  It -- it's important.  You can't make the other person your -- your whole world.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I can't really imagine myself getting -- people always ask, "Yeah, don't you ..." in terms of like meeting new friends but I can't really imagine myself -- I really don't even search for, you know, making new friends 'cause the ones I have, you know, pretty content with them.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it -- usually when you get new friends it's more when you enter different activities.  Like, me with my -- my running, it seems like my running friends kind of come and go, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like -- like I'll be running with somebody for a while and then, I don't know, they'll move or they quit running or whatever.  My -- my best friend that I was telling you about, um, we were co captains on the cross country team in high school so she actually got me, um, running my first marathon when I was -- I was, like, about thirty one.  Um, she'd been walking, kinda running walking the L.A. marathon for several years and then she got me doing it but she's [NOISE] had some injuries since and she's not running anymore but -- but, um -- but I have a number of friends that've been in, you know -- in that running circle and then, you know, have a lot of a -- acquaintances because, um, I'm a musician so, you know, people I play in the orchestra with and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And teach with and stuff.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But -- and -- and, of course, my boyfriend's one of my best friends, too.
L:  Yeah, and I guess also, like, um -- I -- I've -- actually, when I think about, like, when I would have a new job or something, you make your friends there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And hang out with them for a while and you -- and I guess you kinda of -- and then if you go to a new job or [MN] -- you go to a new job, you're kind of stay in touch with them for a while but it's never, like -- I guess I've never really stayed in touch with them more than a couple of months after I left.
R:  Yeah, yeah, it's funny how it happens.  It was just like when -- when I went to my reunion, you know, we all, like, ex- -- exchanged email addresses, a lot of us.  Well, have I gotten any emails --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- from any of them?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You know, and have I sent them any?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No. [LAUGH] So I guess we didn't all want to stay in touch that badly. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I think the email address is, like -- yeah that's the -- that's the way of saying, "Ah, maybe I'll stay in touch".  It's -- it's not the same as, I guess, exchanging phone numbers.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause it's like you have -- it's like the easiest thing to do but also the most mundane so most people don't do it, yeah.
R:  Yeah, true.  But then, you know, you have, like, some friends that even though they're -- they move away, like, they're still your -- you still consider them, like, your best friend even if you don't get to see them much.  Like I have another friend from high school and, you know, she's been in Bakersfield for a couple of years and, um, -- but, you know, she's -- we still call each other, you know, maybe three or four times a year and she came to my daughter's wedding and, you know, it was just like old times that -- like her and my other friend from high school.  The three of us are out dancing on the dance floor, you know.
L:  Mm.
R:  The youngsters --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like, my daughters and her friends they wouldn't dance, you know and all the ki- -- our kids are just looking at us like, "Oh you guys are so weird".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But -- but, you know, like we can kinda just -- those friends, you know, pick up where we left off and -- but that happened with, um, one of my male friends, too, um, um, you know, some -- several years back we, um, ran into each other after ten years or so --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and he -- he saw me and he turned around and he asked, "Oh, are you Anne?" and I said yes and we just -- we just, like, picked up where we left off in high school, you know, and talking about the same kind of stuff and everything and -- but -- so our relationship hadn't exactly grown, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH] We were still kind of, like [LAUGH] immature but -- which would get his girlfriend, who I introduced him to, upset with us, you know, and -- and, um, because she wouldn't like some of the subjects we would talk about [LAUGH] and -- and, um, now also they -- they got married and I don't see him anymore because she was kind of jealous of our friendship so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it is weird how you can pick up like that, people that you've been close to.
L:  That's interesting. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, and -- and, you know, if you -- I -- I assume you're not married or any --
L:  No, no.
R:  You know, if you get married some day, you know, you'll get new friends, too, with the marriage.
L:  Yes, yeah, but usually when I've -- in terms of one of my girlfriends I would never, like --
