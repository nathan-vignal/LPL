R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name is Helene.
L:  Oh, hi Helene.  My name is Anne.
R:  Anne, hi.  I'm in, uh, Southern California.
L:  Oh, I'm in, um, Georgia.
R:  Georgia.  Oh --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- okay.  So, you like things with peaches then, right?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And I love seafood [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, is that -- is that basically what you go out for when you go out to eat?
L:  Uh, yeah.  But you know what?  Um, they're having this thing on, um, the news, showing us our worse restaurants, and they -- what they've been saying was the things they put in our food is like insects[?], moles[?] and it's getting really scary to eat out, so I prefer cooking a lot at home.
R:  Do they rate the restaurants there, like with ratings of A, B, C or do they shut them down?
L:  Um, I think they rate them first and then eventually if they don't get better they do shut them down.
R:  Well, here they put the rating in the window.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And so you -- I won't eat in a B place and for sure not a C place --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- only -- only in A place 'cause they rate them here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But we lov- -- we love to go out to eat.  I'd rather go out to eat --
L:  [SIGH].
R:  -- than just eat at home.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, my husband, he really likes -- he's a s- -- a southern, um, boy, so he -- he really loves for me to cook, and he likes, um, beans and, you know, potato- -- he's a potatoes and meat man, so ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I like to go out to eat a lot more than he does --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- so ...
R:  -- I do.  We got out probably 'bout three or four times [LAUGH] a week now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We ride a motorcycle and we just zip on over to our favorite -- we have quite a few favorite restaurants --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that we go to.  Now, see I haven't meat for, ew, gosh, fifty years.
L:  Really?
R:  No, for- forty years --
L:  Oh, so you just eat vegetables?
R:  Uh, just fruit and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- vegetables --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- tofu and [inaudible], seeds and nuts, and there's quite a few, uh, restaurants like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that are, you know, in our area, because we're close to the movie studio.
L:  Okay.
R:  Uh, but, yeah, my husband eats a lot of meat.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, we'll wind up, you know, a lot of times at a Mexican restaurant where at least they have the -- the other things, you know, and if they don't cook in lard --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's fine 'cause -- because if they do, I won't eat there.
L:  Oh, I see.  But you -- do you eat the, um -- you eat the tacos and the salsa --
R:  Uh, not --
L:  -- I mean the chips and the salsa?
R:  Yeah, if they've made -- they're made in vegetable oil.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  You know, and then plus there- there's other things they can -- they put -- they make like the big taco shell that they make --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they layer it with beans --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and rice and like --
L:  Mhm, okay.
R:  -- it's essentially everything except the meat.
L:  Except the meat, yeah.
R:  You know, but oh boy, we go out to fast food restaurants.  We'll go anywhere.  We have the In-N-Out Burger here --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- that he just loves.
L:  So, do you -- you eat the veggie burger?
R: Yeah, they have the ve- -- they have -- well, they call it a grilled cheese at the In-N-Out --
L: Mhm.
R:  -- but all it is, is grilled onions --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the tomatoes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and everything but the meat again --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's -- that's fine with me.
L:  Yeah, mhm.
R:  You know, I have no complaints --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, uh ...
L:  I would love to be a vegetarian, but you know, it's -- it's hard [LAUGH].
R:  It's very hard, but I --
L:  But I eat -- I try and eat, uh, more fish and chicken.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, that's probably better for you, but then they say the fish isn't good for you either --
L:  I know, all the sulfates --
R:  -- and if  it's not --
L:  -- and everything that's in the water --
R:  -- and if it's not fresh in the restaurant.  We've been -- we've been eating sushi too lately.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know if that's big back there.
L:  Mm [LIPSMACK], s- -- in some areas it is, but I really don't like it that much.
R:  Oh, I got hooked on it.
L:  Okay.
R:  They make it with -- they take the seaweed on the outside, the rice in the middle --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they put in avocado, cucumber and carrots --
L:  Mm, that sounds good --
R:  It is.
L:  -- 'cause I like vegetables.
R:  Right.  See, you don't need the, uh -- the, uh, you know, the f- -- the fish with it.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  But my daughter bought herself a sushi maker --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so we have the thing we can roll it with and make the molds.  We can make heart shaped sushi.
L:  Oh.
R:  We can do it all --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know.  So, I like doing that and that's the way I like to cook at home, is do things like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Something that's -- 'cause sushi is very expensive --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- when you eat it --
L:  I've heard that it is.
R:  -- when you eat it out, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, this is very exciting to be able to talk to somebody from clear across the country --
L:  I know.
R:  and we- --
L:  I know.
R:  -- and we're to talk on the topic of probably [LAUGH] one of our favorite things.
L:  [LAUGH] Things which is food.  I know [LAUGH].
R:  You know, 'cause they really didn't give us any guidelines.
L:  No, uh-uh --
R:  Just said --
L:  -- they just, you know --
R:  -- talk --
L:  -- talk.  Mhm.
R:  Okay.  So let's -- let's talk about food.
L:  Yep.
R:  I watch -- oh God, I watch all the cooking shows --
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  -- and listen to them on the radio.  Oh, yeah --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- because I like -- I learned how to do the art of muki mono --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which is a Japanese vegetable carving.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, when you see like in fancy restaurants, and they'll have something carved out of a -- or made into a rose?
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Okay, I can do all that. 
L:  Oh, th- --
R:  -- I've got a --
L:  --  those are so pretty, and does it -- does it take a lot of time to do it?
R:  It takes a lot of time to learn it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but once you learn it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's very simple.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It really is 'cause it all just makes sense.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I took a class over here at our local college --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- at night, and the lady was wonderful --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then I bought all the books that I could find on it --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- and then some of the books they're smart.  They sell it to you with the tools.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Oh, you have everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I -- that's what I enjoy --
L:  So, do you mostly do that when you have company or something like that?
R:  No, I do it every night if I'm fixing my husband dinner at home.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I will fix it -- I will do something attractive.  He always goes, "The plate is so attractive" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I like the difference of the colors --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, you know, we'll got out like basically for lunch --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- during the week because we work together too --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and then a couple of dinners a week, but the nights that I'll fix him -- even his breakfast plate --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'll put a decoration with a -- with a orange slice twisted on it.
L:  That is so sweet [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You are so creative [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] It just gives it that other extra --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- little touch --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then I always ask if, "Who ordered the number four at this table?" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  But, it just seems -- I don't know, it seems like as you get older too --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you eat less and less and what happens is you wind up taking it home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You take half of it home.
L:  I do.
R:  I do --
L:  Whenever we go out I usually take some home.
R:  Right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because then you get another --
L:  If they give you --
R:  -- meal out of it [LAUGH].
L:  I know, I know.  And I keep it for lunch the next day or something like that.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Exactly.  So, that- that's -- that's the same thing that we do here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, it's funny, probably all across the country, people do this.
L:  I think so.
R:  Well, it-
L:  Mhm.
R:   -- they said this group -- well, when I read about it on the internet, that there was going to be like five people in the group.
L:  Really?
R:  Did you read that?
L:  Mm, no, we- -- I read something about later on when they finish this, they'll have like more calls or something like that, but I just thought it would be just two people, you know, doing a conversation.
R:  Okay, so let's talk about food.
L:  Yeah, okay.
R:  We -- we don't even know how long we've talked.
L:  Uh, they- they'll let you know after eight minutes.  Then they give you like thirty seconds to say goodbye, so I guess we're still --
R:  And then do they call you back or what do they do?
L:  Mm, mm.  It -- it just ends and then they like, you know, um, make a notation I guess of -- that you talked, um, you know, however many calls.  You can talk like three total, I think.
R:  I see.
L:  Mhm.  And then they, you know, keep a --
R:  And then they just send you a check?
L:  Right.
R:  Cool.
L:  Right.  I haven't gotten mine yet, but, um, I s- -- did a couple like a couple of months ago --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but my friend said that, um, he got his because, you know, he was the one who told me about it.  But he says they're good about paying so, I guess we won't have to worry about that [LAUGH].
R:  Yes, and I hope they're listening.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  'Cause those internet ladies that love food --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] have to make some extra money now and again.
L:  That's right, so that we can go out and by the things that we need --
R:  And eat.
L:  -- to cook it with [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  I never -- I never really think to go to fine dining restaurants --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- either though, you know, because we have one on Ventura Boulevard, which is very close to the studios, and when they first opened, we zoomed on by and got a menu --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I was shocked at the prices.
L:  Oh, I know.  I know.  They are  --
R:  You know, I mean --
L:  -- they can be astronomical --
R:  -- you know --
L:  -- that's another thing that --
R:  -- where do they come off charging seventeen dollars for a salad?
L:  I know -- 
R:  It's --
L:  -- that's ridiculous.
R:  -- it's outrageous.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, so I don't -- I don't wind up going to those places --
L:  Me either.
R:  -- and I also don't wind up going to places that's buffet now because of all the sicknesses.
L:  I know.  I know, it's scary with those -- you know, and then everybody is touching the same utensil, you know, so you need to wash your hands again before you eat.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't really like those.  At first they were really big, like, you know, in the, um, early eighties and nineties, but, um, I'm getting away from them because, uh ...
R:  Yeah, I don't think that they're safe because you always hear of food poisoning --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- to do with those kind of places and, boy, that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's not for me.  I've had that once already at a Sizzler.
L:  Ooh.  I know --
R:  And I --
L:  -- that's awful.
R:  -- I never want that again, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but with -- oh, yeah, well there's just too many sicknesses.  They said that's a sneeze guard.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  A lot of people are shorter than that [LAUGH].
L:  That's true.  That's true.  And all those hands and everything that's touching.  I -- I don't really like -- I -- I sort of prefer -- we usually like to go to like Ruby Tuesday or --
R:  What's Ruby Tuesday?
L:  Oh, Ruby Tuesday.  It's, um, it's like an upscale restaurant.  It's not really all that expensive.  They have like, um, you can get, uh, veggie burgers, burgers, uh, fries --
R:  Do they have alcohol?
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  -- salad bar, and [NOISE] just a variety of things, and it's -- the prices are pretty reasonable, so --
R:  Yeah, well that --
L:  -- two people can eat for like, I guess about twenty five, twenty six dollars.
R:  Oh, uh, that's like TGIF or something like that?
L:  Yeah, it is.  It's a lot like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, okay, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, we have places like that too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, but the thing with the veggie burgers, they always cook them right next to those, uh, meat patties.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they use the same spatula.
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  And if restaurants would learn that ...
