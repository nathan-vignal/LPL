L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know, ah ... we- --
L:  I've never done this.  I don't really know what we're doing. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  No, just -- just -- I -- I've done it once before. [LAUGH] But just tell me, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what do you prefer, eating --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at a restaurant or -- or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at home?
L:  At a restaurant. [NOISE]
R:  At a restaurant t- --
L:  That way I don't have to clean everything up. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, I agree, I agree.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  No, personally it depends --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause like I like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- tend to like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- try saving money.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  Th- --
R:  So like I -- I prefer to eat at a restaurant, but I-- I-- I'd rather not do it too often. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it kinda goes both ways.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Bu- -- and what do you like -- what's your favorite meal at a restaurant? [NOISE]
L:  I like Mexican [NOISE] food. [NOISE]
R:  [MN] Okay.  So like what, fajitas or ...?
L:  I like a taco salad. [NOISE]  I can not make a taco salad like they can make. [NOISE]
R:  I agree.  I agree.  With all the [NOISE] dips and everything, [NOISE]
L:  They have like the best tacos, and I want to know their secret.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know what they [LAUGH] do. [NOISE]
R:  No, I agree.  I -- I -- yeah, my favorite food, yeah, actually taco salad and oriental salad, depending on where I'm at. [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Or sometimes, like lately --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I've been going Acapulco and we buy those, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- beef fajita --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- platter [SIGH] and I don't know you -- they -- they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- bring like this whole sizzling tray with like steak and chicken and shrimp and you just make your own fajitas.
L:  That'd be neat. [SIGH] [NOISE]
R:  No, that -- that I like.  I think I have taco fun. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, that -- yeah. [NOISE]  No, my [NOISE] dad like the fajitas.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] That's just too much food for me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, usually it's my husband and I and we split it. [SIGH]
L:  Oh, that's all right, he --
R:  We --
L:  -- eats it all himself. [NOISE]
R:  We -- we buy one of those and we buy a little salad and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we're good. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And we split --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- both and ...  I don't know, maybe I've trained to eat a lot of salad.  So that's why I -- I'm also, um, I -- I tend to stick to either the -- the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the mexican salad or the oriental salad, one of those.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] What are you favorite [NOISE] food to cook at home? [NOISE]
R:  My favorite food --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to cook at home?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] I'm kinda lazy, so I guess pasta.  T- the fact --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- that I like them, but they are very easy. [SIGH]
L:  That's me, something that's quick and easy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've got a four year old and I've got a new [NOISE] born too.
R:  Oh, oh, okay.
L:  Something quick and easy.
R:  You don't want to spend a long time there.
L:  Right. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, like only once in a while I'll try to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like, my husband --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I, well we try to eat a lot of salads.  We don't really love them that much --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but we try.  [SIGH] And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like I -- I -- I got this recipe off the web the other day for an oriental salad, and I did it -- I did like everything.  I did even -- I even did the dressing.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it came out great, and it's the first time in my life I had, you know, a salad with all the ingredients, you know, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like all the little things that they tell you to put in there. [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  And it came out pretty good.  And so w- when -- when I have time I actually go for like a more --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- u- unconventional salad.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  Yeah that's --
R:  But for the most part it's pasta. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's me.  I like pasta. [NOISE] I like a lot of pastas [NOISE] too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it's anything that's just quick and easy.
R:  Yeah.  And b- before I used to make a lot of stir fries.  I -- I just like, ah, leave the ingredients there from the morning, like the chicken and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the --all the little veggies.  You know buy the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the frozen veggies --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- so you just like throw in then and it's ready like in ten minutes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's my -- like my other typical --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- home made meal. [SIGH]
L:  My husband loves [NOISE] -- he -- he wants a big meal.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I said, "Well, you can come home and cook". [LAUGH]
R:  So -- so no -- no --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, what do you call it?  Sushi? [SIGH]
L:  No. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] Unless there's like fifty of them.
L:  [NOISE] No, I -- I do- -- I don't [NOISE] like sushi. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Oh --
L:  I don't like any kind of --
R:  -- okay, then that's [LAUGH] --
L:  I don't like [NOISE] any kind of seafood.
R:  Ooh, oh okay, okay.  So I'm talking about shrimp here and you're like [COUGH].
L:  No way. [NOISE] [LAUGH] Not me. [NOISE]
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  [NOISE] Never mind --
R:  No, I -- I try to stay away from cooked vegetables.  I like -- but not all of them, like brussel sprouts and cabbage, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- those -- those I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Something about 'em. [SIGH]
L:  I like cabbage.  I like fried cabbage. [NOISE]
R:  But, ah -- fried cabbage?
L:  The only -- the only way I eat it is if my mom mixes it.  I cannot fix it like she does.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] So I love her fried cabbage.
R:  Oh, I -- I've never tried that before.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Is it -- I've tried it like steamed.  It's, ah --
L:  [NOISE] No.
R:  -- kind of wishy.
L:  I don't like [NOISE] steamed cabbage.  No, well she does it -- she's got this sort of fryer sort of thing and she just -- she melts butter in it and then she puts the [NOISE] -- she, you know, she pulls the [NOISE] cabbage leaves off and then she [NOISE] fries it.  And it's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it's really good. [NOISE]
R:  No, I've never had that before.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That really sounds good. [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE] It is good.  I could sit [NOISE] and eat the whole pan [NOISE] by myself, [NOISE] if she'd let me. [SIGH] [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, that's cool.  Do -- do -- do you guys get like any --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- special type of desserts when --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you go out to a restaurant?
L:  [MN] By the time I eat I'm full.  [NOISE] I don't hardly ever get dessert.
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Yeah.  No, I do.
L:  Very rarely.
R:  Sometimes I -- I just buy it so I could take it home with me. [SIGH]
L:  There you go.  I never thought about that.
R:  Like, um, I don't know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- whenever you go to like a cheesecake place, which I love --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cheesecake.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
R:  Like Oreo cheesecake, or mocha cheesecake.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Some kind of cheesecake.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Or tiramisu.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh. [NOISE]
R:  Have you tried tiramisu? [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Yes, it's something different. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, no it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like tiramisu is like my favorite dessert --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but they never make it right, so [NOISE] sometimes I just buy it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just to see how that --
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE]
R:  -- particular restaurant --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- try it out.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah, I'm not real big on the desserts, I don't care [NOISE] for all the sweets.
R:  Oh, okay.  No, I don't know, I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --I'm a fan of food in general. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But I love desserts.  I don't know.  Like ice cream I buy tons of and ...
L:  Oh, that's us. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You could look in our freezer right and probably find about four gallons of ice cream.
R:  [LAUGH] Me too. [SIGH]
L:  We love ice cream here.  No, I don't like it during the winter, I only like during the summer.
R:  Oh, no.  I'm -- I'm there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all year round. [LAUGH]
L:  In the summertime -- w- when I was pregnant ate a lot of it win- -- during in the winter.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But my favorite kinda --
R:  It was the baby.  The baby wanted it.
L:  Yeah.  My favorite kinda ice cream is strawberry ice cream.
R:  Oh, it's good.
L:  They gotta ha- it's gotta have the chunks in it though.
R:  Yeah, I know.  I know.
L:  If it don't have the chunks [NOISE] in it.  I don't want it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It also tastes like yogurt. [SIGH]
L:  Yep.
R:  Yeah, no, I agree.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's -- it's strawberry for me, or it's cookies and cream.
L:  N- -- I've tried [NOISE] the cookies [NOISE] and cream but I didn't really care [NOISE] for it. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No.
R:  So what else are we supposed --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to talk --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about?
L:  I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  Let me think.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah ...  Okay, we --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- already went to the restaurant, and the food we like eating in the restaurant and at home.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Anything else you like to eat besides pasta?
L:  [NOISE] I like -- [NOISE] I like making meatloaf too.
R:  Meatloaf.  Oh, that takes a little more work but it's good. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, I mean [NOISE] once you get it all mixed up [NOISE] you just, ah, pop it in the oven and let it cook. [LAUGH]  So, I mean it's -- it's easy. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, oh, and the other --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- thing, like -- well, not me but my husband for the most part, when he has time, he comes home from work and he's like, "Oh, yes, I want to barbeque".
L:  Oh, yes.  I love -- I love cooking on the grill. [SIGH]
R:  Oh, yes.  That's -- yeah, that's what we usually do.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's chicken --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and corn on the grill.
L:  [NOISE].  It's -- it's -- to me, any food you cook on the grill is better [NOISE] than you -- [NOISE] than you can cook in the house.
R:  I agree.  I totally --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- agree.  I don't know, it's -- it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just -- I don't know, maybe it's just the concept of doing it outside in an unconventional place.
L:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't know what it is, but it's -- it's better if you cook it outside than it is if you cook it in the house. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, totally. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] It's a whole lot better. [NOISE] [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And in my case it's my husband --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so I don't do anything.  He's just like, "Okay, can you bring me a plate?" "Sure". [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  "Can you bring me a fork?"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "Sure". [SIGH]
L:  My mom cooks on the grill [NOISE] a lot.  [SIGH] I'm not real good at the grill.  I -- [NOISE] I tried but I normally burn my stuff.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So I have to wait for her to do [NOISE] it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I know, I'm -- I'm -- I'm not good at that either, so I just ...
L:  [NOISE] I forget about it, and if it's in the [NOISE] house I can smell it. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I mean I can't forget about it. [NOISE]  But if it's outside I can forget about it. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know in -- in -- um, we bought this --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- gas grill --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like a few months ago.  I had never had one --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it had always been charcoal.  So, whenever we wanted to barbeque, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know it's like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot of preparing.  You have to --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- put it on and leave it on for like an hour until --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it warms up.  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I like these propane --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or whatever they are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- grills, they -- they go so fast.  I mean it's just like you turn it on and in ten minutes you're ready --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to go.
L:  No.  I like my charcoal grill [NOISE] now.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  No, there's no actually different --
L:  I've -- I've ate off both of 'em, [NOISE] but I -- I -- prefer charcoal grill over [NOISE] a gas grill.
R:  Oh, no.  I -- flavor wise I do too, but time wise it's -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I just like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- being able to do a really fast thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, out of a whim it's like I'm really hungry, so ...  Oh, yeah, I will do the -- I will grill it.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I always do it, you know, before -- you know, I'll eat me a little something and then I'll go start [NOISE] the grill.
R:  Okay.
L:  And then by then -- by the time that's done then I'm -- I'm hungry and I'm ready to eat. [MN]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [MN] That's, ah ...
R:  Okay. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  I don't know, food's a hard topic to talk about for ten [NOISE] minutes. [LAUGH]
R:  I know, I know.  And -- and specially like [MN] they didn't give us like a general sort of topic, it was like --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- specifically what do you eat --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at home?  What do you eat --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at a restaurant?
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  So ...
L:  Trying to think.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  I mean, it's -- it's -- it's hard. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  Okay, sometimes we buy frozen pizza and make pizza. [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE] That's easy too, yeah.  We do that.
R:  Or -- or just buy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a carry out [SIGH] -- take out.
L:  Yep. [NOISE]  I like the, um, [NOISE] what are they called?
