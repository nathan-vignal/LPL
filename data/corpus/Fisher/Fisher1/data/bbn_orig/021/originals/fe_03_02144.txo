R:  [MN] Hi, this is Fred Weiner[?]. [NOISE]
L:  [MN] Hi, this is Laura Valicat[?] [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH] I guess we are supposed to be talking about restaurants or eating at home. [SIGH]
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  I'd rather eat at [NOISE] home.  How about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you? [NOISE]
L:  Oh, me too. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  For sure. [COUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  With, ah, five --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kids [NOISE], ah, raising five children --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's much more easier to eat -- to make [NOISE] at home.
R:  Oh, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I bet it is.  I'm single and, ah -- but I still would rather eat at [NOISE] home. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, I'm a meat and potatoes guy.  How about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you? [SIGH]
L:  Oh, I cook, ah, all kinds --
R:  [NOISE] [MN]
L:  -- of varieties; Chinese food --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- what I'll do is when --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I used to go out for meals, I'd --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hunt down the recipe, [NOISE] got --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it right and started making the meal at home.
R:  [SIGH] I just, ah, bought a Calphalon frying pan, [SIGH] that's the one --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that has the circles and the -- you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all around it.
L:  Okay.
R:  [SIGH] And that has just renewed all my cooking.  It's like really easy [NOISE] to cook with [NOISE] and really easy to clean.  [SIGH] And, ah, that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- caused me to -- to do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- more cooking.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] A lot of times when I say eat at [NOISE] home, I bring home food, [SIGH] being that I'm single.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] Ah, but the frying pan has really renewed my interest--
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in -- in cooking because it's such a [SIGH] fantastic frying pan.  [SIGH] Matter of fact I bought it at the Amazon --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Friday Sale for ten dollars [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, cool. [NOISE]
R:  -- and I think it's a hundred dollar --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- frying pan.
L:  Oh, that's great. [LAUGH]  No, I -- I do a lot of meals, like even though it's just--
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- my husband and I now, I do a lot of meals, like a do a big huge [NOISE] pot of spaghetti sauce [NOISE] and then freeze it up.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  I figure if you're gonna have the power going you might as well [LAUGH] -- and the dishes dirty [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- right?
R:  [NOISE] Right.  Matter of fact, ah, [NOISE] spaghetti sauce is something that I really cook. [SIGH]  The recipe I use is [SIGH] -- I use tomato paste [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] A- -- with an equal amount of water, along with onions --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and garlic --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and shredded carrots. [SIGH]  And, ah, no spices --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at all. [SIGH]  When -- and it makes a very thick sauce. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, when I cook pasta --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I use the pasta water to thin the sauce --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- out and, ah, then when I'm actually cooking the sauce from after it's unfrozen [SIGH] that's when I add the spices and herbs, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because I do -- wel- -- I do prefer using fresh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- spices and herbs.
L:  Mhm. [MN]  Well, we -- we have a, um, half acre --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- garden going.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And we --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- grow our food organically.  So I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get a lot of my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- spices and my carrots --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and my onions --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- garlic and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, all that from the garden.
R:  [SIGH] I m- m- my brother is a veterinarian and lives in Norther California [SIGH] and is one of the world's great gardeners.  I love, ah, [SIGH] -- I love eating parsley from his garden.  For some reason --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] fresh parsley that you b- -- that you get at --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- home -- that you grow at home is just so much better than, ah, the store bought --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- stuff.
L:  Oh, yeah it makes -- it's like tomatoes when you pick 'em fres- o- fo- -- fresh off the, ah, off the vine.  Oh, you just can't beat it, you know?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]  It's like -- and then you buy -- you go in the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- store and you look at the tomato --
R:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it looks red and you come home --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and absolutely no taste to it.
R:  [SIGH] What does your husband -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like to eat? [SIGH]
L:  Oh he's international [MN] as well.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  He's the one who got me into international.  When we got together it was originally --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he -- I was just meat and potatoes.  Right?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And a [NOISE] few vegetables.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well [NOISE] he changed all that. [SIGH]  So, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- now twenty years --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- later.  Um, we -- we -- we cook, ah, we cook Thai, we cook, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] Portuguese.  We --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like the whole gammit.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, Andy Rooney on Sixty Minutes last night brought up a -- [SIGH] a thing about how all foods --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have stuff added to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it now.  Like you -- like, ah, soda y- -- it has vanilla in it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] Or -- or cereal has -- you know, a wheat cereal has raspberries in it.  [SIGH] And I prefer things that are just alone, you know.  I mean, I -- [SIGH] if I'm going to drink coffee --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I want just regular coffee, not flavored coffee.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  If I want flavor -- if I want a fruit in my cereal --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I'll add it.  You know.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- where the fruit --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- came from is another --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- story.  Where did it come from?  I don't know.  You know.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Like, [LAUGH] because like we're up here in Canada, right?  In New Brunswick.  So, I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we get a lot of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- food that's shipped from all over the world.
R:  [MN] Oh, you're from Canada.  That's interesting.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, we're in central -- we're in central New Brunswick --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and we have to watch because we can have frost as late as June --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and as early as August.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] I would think that probably affects your ability to garden, right?
L:  [NOISE] Oh yes, it does.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  We -- a lot of stuff --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we have to have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the greenhouses and that until, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [COUGH] before we can put them out.  You know --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- pre start.
R:  Oh, when you garden you do it partially in a greenhouse?
L:  Yeah, we start in the greenhouse.  Yeah.  Otherwise we wouldn't have a long enough --
R:  [NOISE]:  
L:  -- season.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Except for like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the root vegetables.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  A lot of root vegetables like beets [NOISE] and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] -- carrots and parsnips --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I can't think what else right now.  Potatoes and [NOISE] that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- tha- that really doesn't [NOISE] affect it that much.
R:  My brother is big --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on growing parsnips.  [SIGH] Matter of fact he digs, ah, [SIGH] he digs the soil out, ah, to like, ah, ah, four or five feet deep and -- and -- fills the hole with compost [SIGH] and sees how if he -- how long of a carro- -- ah, a parsnip he could grow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  And he grows some monster length parsnips.  [SIGH] And -- I -- I really like parsnips.
L:  Well composting --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is the best [NOISE]--
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is the best for gardening.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, you know, by --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- i- it -- it's -- it's a natural way of -- an -- and that's what nature intended.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the nature of compost, everything that dies anyway, you know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, instead of having all this stuff --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- going in landfills, you know, we -- we can, ah -- like we have a pr- -- ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- programme going --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in, ah, um, for composting.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  The people who -- especially --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot of people don't have gardens.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And it's called --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the wet dry.  And all -- anything that's wet it's -- the -- it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- bagged in a separate bag and they compost it and sell it back to the public.  You know.  So, I mean ... [NOISE] [SIGH]  But, ah ... [COUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Well, I live in New York City so, ah, -- and in an apartment [NOISE] on the twenty eighth [NOISE] floor.  So I -- I don't think I could do much composting. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-uh.  No, but if -- if they had separate bags [NOISE] when the garbage went out [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yes. [NOISE]
L:  It would be automatically.  You know, you have a green bag --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for compost, your blue --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- bag for your paper products.  Right?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And -- and then it gets [NOISE] -- it gets recycled.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Right?  So even in an apartment --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- buildings [NOISE] it can be done the same way.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  You know?
R:  Mm.  In -- in New York City, ah, N- New York City's so b- ah, behind --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the eight ball with their budget --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] we're cutting back so many services, we're -- we have to be thankful that they're taking our garbage away.  
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Because [NOISE] they may [SIGH] -- they may [NOISE] not be able to soon [NOISE] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- [SIGH] because they're just out of money with all this, ah, the -- the debt that they've assumed since nine eleven.
L:  Mm.  Oh, yeah, that's true.  I -- we'll we've --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  My husband and I have been down, like we used to do -- we used to have a moving business.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And people moving down from Montreal, down to New York.  And we've done a couple of moves down to New York. [LAUGH]  It's crazy down there. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, well I'm retired now, so, ah, I have more time to do [NOISE] cooking and, ah, [SIGH] [MN] ...
L:  Don't have to go out there and fight the traffic.
R:  Right, right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So I -- I do have more time to do cooking.  [SIGH] Matter of fact, ah, when I started this phone call today I was sound asleep.  They called me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I w- -- I was taking a little afternoon nap. [NOISE]
L:  They're lucky --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because that's what I almost went to do. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] [MN]
L:  But I was just through a book looking for -- for -- some recipes.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, because I get a lot of different books come in and I -- you know, I -- I'll go through a book --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I'll find a recipe, like the Reader's Digest, right, they have their little --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- recipes in the book there. [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And I will always try and pick one and --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- try a new recipe out.
R:  [SIGH] I spend a lot of time on the internet, and I'm always, ah, downloading recipes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and saving them. [SIGH]  And to be honest --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with you, I've got --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a big pile of things that I haven't cooked yet. [SIGH] Ah, but that I'm looking forward to. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I -- I have a girlfriend on the internet as well that we -- we exchange --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- recipes.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Right?
R:  Right.
L:  She sends me some fr- -- up, she's down in Maine, and she sends me up recipes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I send her down some.  [SIGH] And, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- okay, this one I've tried, [NOISE] this one's good. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, so, ah [COUGH]...
R:  I have an added challenge because I've put on a lot of weight [NOISE] since I've retired, [SIGH] and I really need to [SIGH] -- to cut out --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the fat in my diet. [SIGH] Ah, so, ah, and the internet has been helpful to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- find, ah -- [SIGH] I can go through a lot of fat --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- free recipes until I [NOISE] find one that I like and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm willing to try. [NOISE]
L:  Well, that's good, that's good, because we --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we all have to be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- more weight conscious as we get older. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The, ah -- fruit has been a -- a real God send to me because, ah, I enjoy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- eating [NOISE] fruit, and a lot of times I'll eat [NOISE] fruit as rather, you know, cookies, or -- or some other snack.  [SIGH] So, fruit has been real helpful.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Stay away from the --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I used to do a lot of the sweets when my kids were little, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I ha- -- having five children --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kept me skinny, to chase them.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And then they all grew up and left and then all of a sudden we- -- I got nice and relaxed --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and started putting on some weight --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I was way underweight when my kids [NOISE] were little.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  So, ah, [LAUGH] you know, ah, almost five eight, a hundred and five --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- pounds was not good. [LAUGH]
R:  The, ah, yeah, I've had, ah, a bunch of, ah, vascular problems [NOISE] and, ah -- and, ah, and heart attack --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, so, ah, losing [SIGH] weight has been a really important part of my diet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, and I swear, it -- it's getting so bad with me sometimes I just won't eat.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, because it feels like everything I want to eat is [NOISE] fattening. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But they say if -- if you -- if you, ah, like, eat three meals a day --
