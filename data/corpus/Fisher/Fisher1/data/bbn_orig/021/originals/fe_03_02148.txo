L:  [NOISE] Jessica Uzac[?]
R:  Hi, my name is Eva, from West Virginia. [MN]  How you doing?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  Fine thank you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Well today's seems to be one of my favorites, eating. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] Are where are you from?
L:  I'm f- -- 
R:  What state?
L:  I'm from New York, Queens.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, you're not too far from me.  Ah ... [SIGH]  Do you prefer eating out, or having a home cooked meal?
L:  Um, it depends, usually home cooked. [NOISE]
R:  You sound like me.
L:  [LAUGH]  I li- --
R:  I'm just very disappointed, aren't you, when I eat a steak or something out --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because I think I can fix it better at home. [SIGH] [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It's like -- I like eating out but I can only do it like once [NOISE] or twice a week. [SIGH]
R:  Right. 
L:  'Cause otherwise it's just like too much.
R:  [SIGH] I agree.  It gets -- I don't know, sometimes just a home cooked meal, especially when you've been on vacation.  That's the first thing I want to do is just fix [NOISE] something just plain, when I get home, like cornbread and beans. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH] No, I like pasta. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  You'd get along with my husband, he does --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- too, he -- he could eat it every meal.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes, but ... I'm a --
L:  I think a lot of people in New York do.
R:  [SIGH] Well, it's -- it's a really healthy food, especially since they have the spinach pasta now and, ah, [SIGH] they have the -- the linguini and all that in -- in, you know, in the bran and you don't have to just always have the white pasta which is good.
L:  Right, right. [NOISE]
R:  But ...
L:  Like there's different of like sauces, and different types of actual pasta. [NOISE]
R:  Right. [SIGH]  I'm a --
L:  Do you --
R:  Huh?
L:  Do you -- do you prefer eating out, or ...
R:  [COUGH] Well, only if it's a special place [NOISE] like the -- when I go visit my daughter, at the Cheesecake Factory.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they fix things like I cannot fix.  They have this delicious meal with the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- chicken and shrimp in it and it's on a p- -- spinach pasta, but I can't remember the name of it.  [SIGH] Something special, but as far as, ah, you know, it's like I could get bored if I had to eat out quite often. [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I really would.
L:  I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- actually don't like the Cheesecake Factory.
R:  Oh, you don't?
L:  No, I don't know why.
R:  [NOISE]  Do you like their tea?  They have a very unusual tea.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Their tea?
R:  Uh-huh.  It has like an orange mint flavor to it.
L:  No.  I'm not a really big tea person, I like coffee.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You don't like the cheesecake either? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, the cheesecake.  The cheesecake.  Um, I like cheesecake I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just -- I don't know, I don't -- I like going to like Friday's and stuff.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Do you like Friday's?
R:  [SIGH] Well, we do not have one around here in West Virginia.  Ah --
L:  Okay. [MN]
R:  -- but I guess the biggest thing we have close by, w- within driving distance would be like a Outback.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Okay, we have that.
R:  No.  I like that but, again, it's only like an anniversary or something.  [SIGH] They have really great lobster.  [SIGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  But I cannot -- I -- I mean I don't want lobster -- maybe once every six months.  Ah, I'm not a big fan of, you know, real rich --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- foods.
L:  [SIGH] Actually I don't really eat seafood out.
R:  You don't?  [NOISE]
L:  No.  I [NOISE] do not like seafood at all. [NOISE]
R:  Oh.
L:  My, um, my family [NOISE] is actually going [LAUGH] for seafood tonight [SIGH] and I have to go. [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  So, maybe I'll get the chicken.
R:  [LAUGH] You sound like my daughter [SIGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- she loves chicken, she could eat it every meal.
L:  [MN] Really?
R:  [NOISE] [COUGH]
L:  Yeah, I'm just -- I'm really picky, um --
R:  You sound like you're almost vegetarian.
L:  No, not really.
R:  No?
L:  Um, [SIGH] I just -- the only meat I really eat out is chicken.  Um, [NOISE] steak is okay, but I wouldn't like go out and actually like get a steak, like I prefer like a burger or pasta or something.
R:  Mhm. [SIGH]
L:  Um, [SIGH] in New York though there's like a lot of eclectic restaurants.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  [MN] Very -- just like small portions and very -- just weird --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- food.
R:  [SIGH] We just do not have the variety here, at all.  [NOISE] Um, Beckley I don't know if you have been near it, but it's a very small city.  It's, ah -- we're south of Charleston, which is the capital of West Virginia.
L:  Okay.
R:  And even there, there isn't -- I guess maybe one of the biggest ones is the -- the Italian Restaurant -- I can't think of the name of it.  Ah, Olive Garden.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.  I --
R:  It's --it's --
L:  -- don't like it there that much.
R:  No.  Ooh, I -- I do not like Italian food.  I'm ah, [SIGH] I don't like all the spices and [NOISE] things, because I have a sensitive stomach.  So s- sounds like we're both kind of picky eaters. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Oh, my God, I'm like ridiculously picky. [LAUGH] 
R:  Now, I --
L:  I don't know.
R:  The thing I love about the Red Lobster is their homemade biscuits.  Oh.
L:  Yeah, that -- that I actually enjoy.
R:  Yeah, I do too.  I could just go and have that and be happy, and carrot cake. [LAUGH]
L:  Carrot cake's [NOISE] good. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]  Yeah, I'm more into sweets I think, but as far as food, [SIGH] ah, I just think it tastes better at home, unless [NOISE] it's a -- you know, unless --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's a place I'm really looking forward to going.  Like one time I went to the Rainforest [SIGH] Caf, ah, the Mall of America.  [SIGH] And that was delicious, but the portions --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- were huge.  Like two great --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- big pork chops and just piles of just -- you know, just too much.  Nobody can eat all that.
L:  [SIGH] Well, sometimes the portions are so huge, and then other times the portions are like so small.
R:  And it's just a waste, isn't it?  If you really -- I mean I like to buy, ah, -- we go to the Cheesecake Factory, we buy one meal [SIGH] and split it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's -- it's not because we're cheap, but we just know we're not going to be able to eat two of them.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]  I'd [NOISE] rather split it with someone than waste it, definitely.
R:  [NOISE] Right, and then you have room for, um, dessert [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Oh, [LAUGH] ah, the important stuff.
R:  Do you like special coffees?
L:  Um, I actually prefer --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just plain, [MN] like --
R:  I do too.
L:  -- um, just like milk, no sugar, just plain not --
R:  Not [SIGH] --
L:  -- no flavors.
R:  That's what I usually-- once in a while, um, I'll get a cappuccino, if it's m- --somewhere that I know it's [NOISE] really good but, ah, [SIGH] that's on our vacations, it's, you know, [SIGH] with, ah --
L:  Yeah.  You guys [NOISE] -- 'cause I've actually been like further south, I used to drive to Florida.  You guys have like grits and stuff, right?
R:  We have like what?
L:  Grits.
R:  Oh, and -- well, yes [NOISE] we do, at the, ah, [SIGH] at the Cracker Barrel, restaurants like that, but we're not that south. [NOISE]  We're kind of [SIGH] right in the middle.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] Ah, I think we like more, ah, hash browns.  But I love grits. [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  But I'm the only one in my family, so that tells you we're kinda more north.
L:  Yeah.  I l- -- I love it.  Like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so much, and no one I ever -- like when we used to [NOISE] -- I used to drive down too Florida like very year to see my grandparents [NOISE].  And we used to always go to [NOISE] eat.  And I would always, always, always get that, because you can't rea- -- you can't get it here.
R:  No.  And if -- now that is something I cannot make either.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  My grits do not taste good at all.  And I won't fix it for just me --
L:  [NOISE] --
R:  -- 'cause then it's a lot of food if no one else is gonna eat it with me.  So, I'll get that if like I go Cracker Barrel, or like if I go down south --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to [SIGH] visit family down there.
L:  I've never been there.  [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  The Cracker Barrel.  But it --
R:  You haven't.  Oh, that's -- that's pretty country now.  They have the, ah -- country salted ham, if you like that.
L:  Yeah, I don't. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I used to, but it doesn't help my blood pressure any, all that salt. [LAUGH]  But, ah, you know ...
L:  They have like, um -- like, um -- like corn on the cob and biscuits [NOISE] and stuff.
R:  Oh, yes.  They ha- -- but they put cheese in the hash browns and I cannot stand --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that.
L:  Er.  It's [NOISE] --
R:  And their gravy is terrible.  I don't know if you like gravy, but I do not like the gravy.
L:  I'm not --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a big like mashed potato person.
R:  I'm not either.  I could go without a potato and never miss it.  [SIGH] But -- but I like green beans and, you know, I have to have something like that, but I don't think I'd ever miss a potato.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, see I -- I like, [NOISE] um -- like french fries, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] no potatoes. [NOISE]
R:  [MN] You sound --
L:  Like --
R:  -- like me there.  No.  We have a lot of fried potatoes around here, [SIGH] but, ah, [SIGH], not grits. [LAUGH]
L:  What about, um, Mexican food? [MN]
R:  Well, we have this little -- cheap restaurants like Taco Bell.
L:  Okay.
R:  Ah--
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think I prefer to cook something like that at home because it's [NOISE] so -- well, it's such a cheap food to fix.  Because I would hate to pay those big dollars to go out and buy it when I know I can make it at home [SIGH] with just a Taco Bell kit, or you know, any of the other brands at the stores.
L:  [SIGH] Well, when you make like -- when you make food at home, you're making food for your whole family.  Right?
R:  Right, uh-huh.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's I guess the difference, 'cause I live by myself.  So [NOISE], it's --
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  -- not that much of a hassle like for me to make myself food, but you have to like make, [NOISE] you know, food for like a house full of people.
R:  [SIGH] But the difference -- right.  [NOISE] Just one person, sometimes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think it's cheaper to eat out.  You know, especially if you get to the lunch buffet --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and things like that, but, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when you have several people in your family it adds up. [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  Have you ever been to New York, like the [NOISE] city?
R:  I've been past New York, ah, when we went up north Canada a couple of times.  But I've never, [SIGH] ah -- we -- we saw the Brooklyn bridge, and we got lost in, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- New Brooklyn, that area, one time.  Got scared to death.  [SIGH] And, ah, that -- my husband never would take me downtown --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because he said the traffic was too bad.  And I always wanted to see what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the high rise buildings looked like.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think it would be fantastic just to get to walk on the main street and look up?  [SIGH] Do you live pretty close to downtown?
L:  Um, [NOISE] to the city --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- downtown?  Yeah.  Well, I worked in [NOISE] Soho.
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] So that's actu- -- that's like -- it's not downtown but it's kind of like right above downtown.
R:  But you get the atmosphere of the whole [NOISE] city, don't you?  And just ...
L:  Oh, definitely. [NOISE]
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] Without a doubt, yeah.
R:  Oh, I -- I think you're lucky, I've always wanted to go there but, ah, I guess the only way to ever go is to like to ride a [NOISE] train or something and I wouldn't have to worry about parking.  'Cause we could not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- navigate the big city.  We've just got two lane roads up here. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  I, um -- I take the train [NOISE] into the city [NOISE] every day.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] 'cause like, I'm at work right now.
R:  Oh.
L:  So [NOISE] I take the city -- [LAUGH]
R:  Well that's nice --
L:  I don't know --
R:  -- if you can do this at work. [LAUGH] 
L:  No.
R:  Mm.
L:  I signed -- I, um, signed up for the thing.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Like --
