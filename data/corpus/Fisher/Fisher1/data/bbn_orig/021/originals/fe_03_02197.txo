R:  Hi, I'm Kelly.
L:  Hi, I'm Lynn.
R:  Hi.
L:  How are you, Kelly?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  Good.
R:  Ah.
L:  So I guess our question is food --
R:  Food sounds great.
L:  Which one we like eating better, at a restaurant or at home, and our perfect meal.
R:  Oh, I have to say, I much prefer someone else doing the cooking. [LAUGH] So --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I am definitely a restaurant person.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, they say there's nothing like a home cooked meal.  I beg to differ. [LAUGH] I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  If I had -- if I had this, you know, this unlimited disposable income, I would probably eat out all the time --
L:  You would?
R:  But um ... yeah, yeah.
L:  If it were- -- if you had the money, you'd prefer to eat out all the time?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Even breakfast and lunch?
R:  Uh, yeah, probably.
L:  Are you a three meal a day person?
R:  I am a -- I'm a three meal a day person.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's why I'd do 'em all.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, I -- I'm starting to cook more because ... well, because I [LAUGH] need to start to cook more, and I just want to enjoy the process of cooking.  It's good to eat.
L:  Do you work?
R:  Yes, I do.
L:  So ti- -- is time a factor in that decision to prefer to eat out?
R:  Um, somewhat.  But no -- but --
L:  If you had more time, you could probably cook more. [LAUGH]
R:  Probably.  But then, I mean, I think about what I -- if I'm work- -- if I'm -- if I have a big [inaudible] meal when I pick up.  You know, 'cause I also like a slow meal too. [LAUGH] So, you know, like --
L:   Sure.
R:  Yeah.  This is --
L:  Well, I'm -- I'm -- I'm kinda torn on this question --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I love to cook.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I grew up with an Italian mother, you know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and she made everything from scratch.
R:  Gotcha.
L:  And then, my family owned a restaurant in --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- in a -- in a --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- resort.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I -- I grew up working and playing in the restaurant.
R:  Oh, that sounds great.
L:  You know, and so I -- you know, and I ate a lot of meals at home, with you know -- and learned how to cook from scratch.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then I ate a lot of meals at the restaurant and my parents idea of like, taking us out for a great birthday, or a special occasion, was to go to a restaurant.  So, I link that in my mind to, "It's special when you go to a restaurant".  So I love going to restaurants, but I also love to cook the kind of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- food that I want to eat at home.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  So, if I had to choose between one and the other, I'd probably choose cooking at home, 'cause I'd definitely -- as long as I had enough time and ingredients, you know, and maybe even a little help -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I, you know, I would prefer that, because then I could make it exactly the way I want it.
R:  Yeah, and you know exactly what's going in it.  Yeah.
L:  True.  True --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you don't have to worry about whether or not the cooks, you know, keep a clean kitchen, or if, you know, if there's any E. coli hanging out and --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- you know, if they refrigerated the ingredients properly, and --
R:  Or if you're allergic to something.  Whether, you know, peanuts ended in -- up in there or, you know.  Thank God, I don't have any food allergies, 'cause peanuts tend to be like, the worst one to have.  And it's so --
L:  Right.  Well, see, I grew up with food allergies.
R:  Yeah.
L:  In fact --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- I was probably allergic to more foods than -- than not.
R:  Really?
L:  So I had to really, kind of, you know, either put up with ah, the skin problems that it caused, or just you know, learn to pick and choose and ask a lot of questions when I went out.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  So that's a really good point.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  You know in fact -- in fact, I -- I decided to open a restaurant, when I was, you know, in my early thirties and I owned my own restaurant for a while, and it was all natural foods.
R:  Really?  How cool.
L:  Organic and natural --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- healthy vegetarian food and healthy chicken and shrimp and fish --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you know, gourmet vegetarian foods.  It was really great.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, but --
L:  So I got spoiled. [LAUGH]
R:  I was going to say, you wouldn't happen -- I'm -- look, I'm always ah, good for a new restaurant. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'd go visit that one.
L:  Well, that's another thing.  Do you -- would you go to the same restaurant?  Or would you go to different restaurants?
R:  I tend to go to the same restaurants.  Because I know --
L:  Really?  Do you have your favorite meals?
R:  Ah, favorite meals?  I actually, you know -- my favorite meals are usually the ones I cook, myself.  So that's kinda weird. [LAUGH]
L:  Huh. [LAUGH]
R:  I know, I know.  Like, when I -- and I -- you know, I have some things that are like, I don't know -- like comfort food, in a way?  Like, ah, my mother used to make this chicken [inaudible] soup that was really, really good, and it had like, you know -- you know, bunches of chicken, and tomato base --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- with stewed --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- tomatoes, and you know, and corn and --
L:  Oh, yum. [LAUGH]
R:  -- peas, and it -- and it was really, really good.  And it had bacon in it, too.  So, like, whenever I feel myself getting sick, or -- I just like to think that's good and hearty.  You know, I've eaten it in the middle of the summertime. [LAUGH] 'Cause, it's just, you know, it's --
L:  And you go for that? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  It's good and it's co- --
L:  Sure, 'cause of the emotional and -- and the -- the thought connection to it.
R:  Yeah, and it's -- and it's just easy, and I -- you know.  I don't have a lot of patience either, like um --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- my boyfriend makes fun of me, 'cause I cook everything on high. [LAUGH] You know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- on high -- on the ah, hottest heat, I'd ever have.  He goes like, "Do you -- hey, like, have you ever heard of medium?" I'm like, "But I just don't have time for medium". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And -- [LAUGH]
L:  Forget you and sauces. [LAUGH] Since you --
R:  No, and I really can't --
L:  -- cook them on low.
R:  -- make sauces.  I try.  I just -- I just have to be in it for the long haul. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um --
L:  Well, my restaurant used to do cooking classes too.
R:  Uh-huh?  Really?
L:  For different things, yeah.  For people with allergies, for people who had cancer and wanted to eat healthy foods to r- -- you know, to restore their health.  And --
R:  Oh, really?  How great.
L:  -- and cook -- you know, cooking classes for kids and, you know, to lose weight or gain weight, as the case --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- may be, for athletes.  All that -- oh, God, it was so much fun.
R:  Or people who find -- who are trying to -- [inaudible] if they're trying to be vegetarians with transitioning and trying to get the -- e- -- enough -- enough protein and such.  [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.  And didn't have a clue, you know, how to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do it, you know, and what to replace ingredients with.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  You know, and people who hated to cook, but you know, need -- wanted to learn. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  That's true, it is a skill.
L:  Or wanting to only, you know, cook on high. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't like -- [LAUGH] well, you know, I started getting cooking like, because, you know, with this whole thing of cooking for myself -- and I've gotten better about, you know, medium, and you know, and patience with it.  But still, you know.  It's like ah --
L:  Well, you know, if you -- if you only have so much time, you -- you kinda can only, you know, commit so much time to eating too, so --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- cooking on cooking on high works really well in that case. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And then I think, you know, the whole restaurant -- I -- I shouldn't say -- I mean, it's all so different 'cause usually you go to a restaurant you're with other people, and you have the whole speaking experience too, like -- you know, I live by myself and -- and if I'm just cooking for myself, I'm probably just gonna --
L:  Plus for social for you, yeah.
R:  Yeah, you know, probably gonna you know --
L:  I like that part of it too, because --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- in fact, you know, a lot of times the restaurant that I go to will depend on who I'm going out to eat with.
R:  Yes, that's true, yeah.
L:  You know, like, there are certain people you'd never go to like, a Thai restaurant with, you know, 'cause they --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- would never eat Thai food, without complaining --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- bitterly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for, you know, the whole meal.
R:  Or just, you know like --
L:  And other people --
R:  -- I can never find anything, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Right, you know, there's nothing on the menu that they'd eat.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then there's other people who'd really be adventurous and they'd go to a totally brand new restaurant just for the experience of -- of -- of eating something totally new, and having, you know, a -- a curious meal at -- you know, it's something they had never done before.  And that would be fun.
R:  Yeah, that is.  Yeah.
L:  So, I really -- I like that part of the social aspect of eating out at restaurants too, for me.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.  Yeah, I like the social --
L:  And you can talk, and you don't have to think about if people are enjoying what you've prepared, you know.
R:  Or is there enough this, or enough that?  You just kinda like, you know.  That's someone else's worry.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] you call the waitress and say --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- "Bring more s- -- bring more bread".  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, "We're out of -- we need another bottle of wine, you bring it over".  It's not your -- not your -- not your issue.  At all.
L:  Yeah, "An extra spoon for dessert.  They're eyeing my dessert". [LAUGH]
R:  But, you know, it's so funny when I think about what I want when I, ah -- I shouldn't say, "When I grow up", but when I like, I have more --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- disposable income, and -- like, I want a nice kitchen.  'Cause I think that might propel me to want to cook more.  You know.
L:  Oh, it totally makes a difference.
R:  'Cause my kitchen is so cramped, and I cook on it, but I'm just like, you know --
L:  Well, when you have a kitchen that's totally stocked, and it's big enough and you've got, you know, a full pantry and you've got everything -- all the herbs and the spices and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, all kinds of pasta and all kinds of sauces and all the condiments and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you've got everything there for you, you know, and -- and -- and then you can make whatever you're in the mood for.
R:  That's true.
L:  You know, and you're much more likely to -- to do -- to cook, when you can just -- whatever you're hungry for, it's totally, you know, your -- you have the freedom to do whatever you want.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You're much more likely to cook.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's true.  So what would be you're ah -- what's your perfect meal, your favorite meal?
L:  My perfect meal has to be um, [LIPSMACK] there's -- there's this one restaurant that I really like, it's called The Urban Onion.
R:  Oh.
L:  And my kids love it, my partner loves it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my friends love it, so it's kinda like, whoever I can go with, they always love it.
R:  Where is it?
L:  -- and I have -- I ha- -- my perfect meal is -- they make these casidieres[?] that are just delicious --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- with a dipping sauce that's just got the perfect amount of jalapeno and scallions and -- and cilantro and cheese and beans and spice.
R:  Huh, cilantro's the best.  Mhm?
L:  And so, you can put as much dip on your casidiere as you want, so it's kinda like, I can get it my way.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And then -- and then I dive into the salad because they make this delightful lemon tahini dressing --
R:  Really?
L:  -- that I can't find anywhere else, and I can't make it myself.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  And they won't tell me what all the ingredients are that go into it, so it's really special.
R:  Gotcha.
L:  You know, it's like the only place I can get it.  And --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- on their salad it goes really well.  And then I dive in to the ginger chicken spinach salad --
R:  [SIGH]
