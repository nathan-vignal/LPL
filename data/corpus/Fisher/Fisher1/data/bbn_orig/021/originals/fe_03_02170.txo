L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  [LAUGH] Hi, my name's --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- Elizabeth.  
R:  Hi, my name is Bill. How ya doing?
L:  Good.  How are you doing?
R:  I'm all right.  I'm all right.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay, so, we have to talk about food.
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, what restaurants do you like?
R:  Um, actually, you know what?  I'd rather, uh -- I'm a eating at home type of guy.
L:  Yah?
R:  Yeah, I am, 'cause, I'm kind of finicky.
L:  [LAUGH] Do you --
R:  But, uh, go ahead.
L:  -- do you cook for yourself, or do you have somebody who cooks for you?
R:  No, I cook totally for myself.
L:  Yeah?
R:  I don't -- yeah -- I don't like people that cook for me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R: [LAUGH] And you know, I've been -- I've been, um, this way m- most of my life, y- you know, I didn't even like my mother to cook for me.
L:  [LAUGH] Jeeze. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's --
L:  Your poor mom.
R:  -- it's, uh [COUGH], w- -- i- -- actually food, when I was young, was a v- -- was a, uh, big problem, eating, and, um, they -- my parents used to take me to the doctor 'cause I refused to eat, and I re- -- I didn't eat meat, and so they were really worried --
L:  Oh, jeeze.
R:  -- and, uh -- and I didn't -- and, you know, since I was so small, I didn't -- I didn't know why, and I didn't say I didn't eat meat, I just didn't eat meat, and I couldn't really substantiate, uh, you know, why I was like this.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, [LIPSMACK] yeah, it's [LAUGH] -- food is a tricky thing for me, and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- at restaurants is -- is, uh -- was never my favorite.  You know, I didn't eat a hamburger til I was like in High School. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that makes sense then.  [LAUGH]  So, do you have like, uh, a medical thing with food --
R:  No --
L:  -- or --
R:  -- no --
L:  -- are you just --
R:  -- not at all --
L:  -- you just like --
R:  I just, uh, I don't know why.  I -- I -- um, I don't know.  I'm just finicky.  I just -- there's certain smells and stuff that I -- I just really can't handle, and I -- I mean, I've experimented f- -- uh, f- -- briefly at times and then I always went back to, um, um, basically saying, it's not a health thing 'cause you know, I -- the things I do eat -- I eat potato chips and that's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- not really the
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- healthiest thing for you, but, um, uh, I d- -- you know, I really can't say, but I -- I've always -- it's -- it's funny when I go to a restaurant, I always attract waiters or waitresses that are, um, always -- they used to, um, bring me the wrong stuff or you know, and -- and it was very clear, like if I wanted a, um -- a sandwich and I -- I didn't want mayonnaise, they'd always put mayonnaise on it, so, they always --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- do something --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and it -- it's almost like I attracted that. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  Well, I used to be a waitress, so, I apologize --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- on behalf of them[?] --
R:  You don't have to --
L:  -- we don't do it on purpose, really. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no, no, no.  No, I --
L:  It just happens.
R:  -- never took it personal --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know.  So, tell me about your food, uh, whether you like --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to, um, eat at restaurants?
L:  I like to eat at restaurants because I'm a horrible cook.  I, like, can't make anything that tasty, and I can make macaroni and cheese --
R:  Oh, I like that.
L:  -- and -- and, that's about it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't get much fancier[?] than that.  So, I like to eat out just for that reason. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right --
L:  So, I can --
R:  -- I hear you.
L:  -- get some good food once in a while.
R:  I understand.
L:  [LAUGH] You know.  
R:  What's your favorite place?
L:  Oh, jeeze, um, well, I live in southern California, so, like there's this really great Mexican place that's fantastic.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  Yeah, it's like one of those home style places --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- where it's just -- that you see them cooking it yourself, you know --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- and they like actually speak Spanish and stuff, so you --
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  -- know it's really authentic. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Um, and Claim Jumper is really good, like makes ribs and steaks, and they have the best chocolate cake ever in the whole --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- wide world.
R:  -- [LAUGH]
L:  Good stuff.
R:  All right.
L:  So, um, what were the other things they said to say?  Favorite food or something like that?
R:  Yeah, how -- how old are you, Elizabeth?
L:  I'm twenty one.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  How old are you?
R:  Forty nine.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Cool.
R:  [LAUGH] So, n- -- you know, I basically -- I was, um -- I'm getting to a point where I'm very -- and I've been drastic at time, I'm getting ready to go really drastic, and eat only fruits and vegetables for a while, only --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because my body is not feeling, uh, normal.  It's -- it's -- and when it -- when I feel this way, usually if I clean myself out like that, because then, not only do you, um, lose a lot of weight, which i- it's not really a weight thing, but, uh, you feel incredibly great.
L:  I've just heard about this.  I read it in, um, a book like Fit for Life, or something --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- by some guy -- is that the -- the same[?]?
R:  Well, no.  No, actually, it's, uh -- I've -- I've -- I've just done it before when I've -- I've done a cleansing --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because, uh, uh, I actually had gained some weight, and, ow -- in -- when I was about, uh, in my thirties, and I -- I've got -- because my wife was, um -- at the time I was married and she was, uh, cooking all this food, and, uh, we were just pigging out, and, um [LIPSMACK] so, uh, I had to clean myself out, and that's -- then I did it with, um -- I just ate fruits and vegetables and then I -- I did, you know -- took vitamins to, uh, get the proper nutrition, but I did it with a doctor and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- boy, I lost a lot of weight [COUGH], and, uh, [SIGH], you know, I was really aware of how I was feeling, and which is basically, you know, on- once you eat, and you eat a big meal, and, uh, I was conscious of how that made me feel afterwards, even though it was good going down, but what did it make you --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- feel like afterwards.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  Because if you're stuffed and you're at that point where, "Oh, I can't move" but then once it goes away, then y- -- there was a tendency t- to stay at that full point --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then, once you stay at that full point, then you don't notice that any more and you, um, make the barrier a bigger barrier to get to that, "Oh" -- that point where --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "You need to roll me out of here" but, um, I don't know, I just, uh, right now, since I -- you know, I've never been forty nine, or I'm actually going to be fifty --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- this year, and -- and to me --
L:  Happy Birthday.
R:  -- you know, I'm still eighteen or nineteen 'cause that's how I remember myself --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, uh, I'm experiencing, uh, physically what -- not mentally, but physically what it's like to be, and my body's just not the same as it was.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, remember that you're twenty one now --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's -- and -- and it's --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- just like a blink of an eye, you're -- you're like going to be, uh, thirty, and then you're going to be forty, and then -- and each -- each of those increments, your body, uh -- that energy level is not the same and you can't really eat what you used to, you know, you can go to Burger King --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it just isn't going to do it any more.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  
L:  Oh.  So, when you do the -- the fruit and vegetable thing, how long do you do it?  Like, for just a couple of days --
R:  I've done --
L:  or what?
R:  -- no, no, I've done it for six weeks.  You lose an incredible amount of weight --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- but you feel beautiful.  Oh, it's like you're a kid.  It's like the energy of a little kid.  Yeah, I just -- it just -- and then you start to think, "Oh, my God, can I ever go back to real food?" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and then, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you do, but -- you do.  And then it -- it gets where you forget the feeling.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's a -- it's a beautiful thing, um, you know.  Some people never go back because, uh, they realize, um, you know, the just -- the benefit of, um, you know, just eating, uh, properly.  'Cause you -- you can really get into some, um, products and -- and you start looking at labels and seeing what they're putting in the food --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and at -- at --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- mass consumption, uh, they're just -- it's kind of addictive [LAUGH], sugar and white flour and they're putting certain ingredients in that -- that only makes you want to, you know, eat more --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- so ...
L:  Yeah, I see that.  See, I've -- 'cause I've read about that before, and that sounded really interesting to me, but I've never actually known anybody who did that --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- so, it's --
R:  -- I've done it several times.  It's -- it's a good thing.  It -- the hardest part is the first couple of days 'cause you're in a habit of just grabbing anything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but once you break that habit in the first couple of days, you're like -- you're good to go.
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  But, then you start -- you know, you're head starts tripping 'cause you're lightheaded, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you start -- so, you got to watch that too.
L:  'Cause you know, yeah, 'cause it's -- my finals week is next week --
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  -- so, you know when you eat, you -- I tend to -- when I get stressed out, I eat --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, like, I've just been eating and eating and so, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and so I need to stop, so that would be really good, like, thing for me to try -- 
R:  Yeah, it would be.  It would be, uh ...
L:  -- like next week after I finish.
R:  You know, when I -- when I, um -- when I was in college, and like when I get stressed out, I play music, and I, uh, would like study for -- I'd want to do an all nighter and stuff -- I would end -- I don't know why, but I would start like in the middle of my studies, this like -- start to write a song, and then I'd have to go -- I'd have the tape recorder on and go, and "Chiw[?]" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- drop the song real fast, and then go back to my study.  It happened all the time.  I don't know why.  Isn't that --
L:  That's cool.
R:  -- weird?  Yeah, well -- but I studied -- just was weird, because the song would be a total different subject matter than what I was studying, because I'd been studying math or something, and then all of a sudden I'm cramming, and then all of a sudden this song just comes out. [LAUGH]
L:  It's your unconscious screaming to be heard.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  It is.
R:  And I'd have to do i- -- you know, I'd have to go and deal with that and then come back to the studying.
L:  Yes, in other words, you take it out of your head, man.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, like, see yes.  Sometimes it doesn't let you sleep --
L:  Right.
R:  -- til you get it right.
L:  So, when you eat the ...
