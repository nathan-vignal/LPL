R:  Hello.
L:  [NOISE] Yes, hi, there.  My name is Roy, and, uh, I'm calling, uh, with the University of Pennsylvania Fisher Study [SIGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Are you fa- uh --
R:  My name is Carol.
L:  Carol?  Hi Carol --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- where are you from today?
R:  New Jersey.
L:  Okay.  I'm in New York myself, uh --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- the, uh, topic of our conversation I'm told today is, uh, eating out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or eating at home.
R:  Okay [LAUGH].
L:  And, uh, [LAUGH] it's interesting because [COUGH] in my case I'm a mystery shopper, and I eat out, uh, only to satisfy those requirements.  [SIGH] I don't normally eat out on my own.  I really would rather eat home.  How do you feel about --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- eating out, uh, either c- --
R:  Well --
L:  -- cost wise, or, uh [SIGH] -- uh, you know, for convenience, or, uh, wh- --
R:  Well, I'm a wife [LAUGH] and I have to do the cooking [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.
R:  So, I like to eat out [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.  Well, you can be creative at home for sure, uh --
R:  Yeah, um, but I've been cooking for thirty four years, and [LAUGH] I'm tired of it [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  Yeah, uh, the first thing that comes to my mind when I eat out is the cost versus, um, eating at home.  I know you've got, um, you know, consideration there for the labor and so forth, eating out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, uh, I've heard it's said that eating out is normally about, uh, four or five times the, uh, uh, cost of the items as reflected in the bill, a- as, opposed to eating home where you e- eat for about ten or twenty percent.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Do you fin- [COUGH] -- have you found any restaurants that are economical that would, uh -- as well as convenient? [COUGH].
R:  Yeah, well, what we try to do, is go for early bird specials and two for one from the entertainment book coupons --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- buy one, get one free.
L:  Are you anywhere near the casinos then?
R:  Um, 'bout forty minutes away, but we really don't go down there 'cause the restaurants there are outrageous.
L:  Okay.  Okay, because, uh, I recall in Nevada many years ago, there were some very good, uh, type of restaurant deals, but [SIGH] of course that was a long time ago for me, uh, in the eighties, and, uh --
R:  No, Las Vegas is a lot cheaper than Atlantic City.  Atlantic City does not give the bargains that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that Las Vegas does.
L:  Well, do you find that the, uh, the courtesy within the restaurants, and the wait time, and the, uh [SIGH] -- and the, uh, uh, you know, th- -- the various types of items on the menu, uh, make up for the costs?  Are you pretty much satisfied with your favorite restaurants?
R:  They're all right, but, uh, to be perfectly honest, my cooking's better [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] So --
R:  [LAUGH] An- and I know my husband agrees with that, but sometimes you just need a break.
L:  Okay, so, you don't really make it a habit in eating out then?  You just, uh --
R:  No, we do tw-  -- at least twice a week.
L:  Okay.  Well, that's -- that -- that's good.  That's probably th- -- uh, about the average today.  I know that, um [SIGH], um, you know, people are so darn busy that they almost have to eat out today --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I think it's a lot more predominant in the south I've seen than up here.  Um, I think it's 'cause the heat down here involved with, uh, being in the kitchen cooking.  It probably has a lot to do with it.
R:  Well, my parents live in Florida and it's a lot cheaper down there to eat out, that I see --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- when we got to visit them.
L:  Well, that's -- down south, in the south east especially, it's a generally low costed area --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- low cost of living, and that, uh, transposes over to the, uh, uh, outdoor eating as well.
R:  Now, I live at the shore, and in the summer the prices are horrendous.
L:  Oh, they change, huh?
R:  Mhm [LAUGH], because of all the tourists.
L:  Uh, well, i- it makes you want to bring a doggie bag along, doesn't it?
R:  Mhm.  But, I mean --
L:  Uh, d- --
R:  -- uh, there's a lot of times I'll go to a restaurant, I won't eat, uh, something that I -- chicken marsala, I won't eat in a restaurant 'cause I can make it just as good at home --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I try to --
L:  [COUGH].
R:  -- eat things that I don't cook at home.
L:  Mhm.  Well, that's -- that's probably, uh, the reason a lot of people, uh, go out, you know, just for the variety sake they don't have available to them at home.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] Uh, do you usually eat, uh, just you and your husband, or do you, uh, bring friends or family with you when you go out?
R:  No, we usually just go, the two of us, 'cause it's easier to just go when we want, where we want and not have to argue [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.
R:  With other people -- of course, you know, we'll take our children out some tim- -- they're grown, but if they're around, we'll take them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to eat with us.
L:  Well, it's nice to make it a bit of a family affair --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- too, especially if you have the time.  Uh [COUGH], excuse me.  The, um, uh, many times people look, uh, for the Sunday, uh, uh, restaurant coupons in the newspapers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- do you ever find yourself, uh, coming across those?  Um, I don't think I could name the restaurants, but there -- some of the more f- -- uh, common family, uh, style restaurants --
R:  Oh, yeah, like, um, Olive Garden and --
L:  Mm.
R:  T.G.I. Fridays , we don't really frequent those restaurants.
L:  Oh, okay --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, you have special ones then?  I mean, you have favorite restaurants, as opposed --
R:  Um --
L:  -- to others?
R:  -- per- personally, I prefer non chain restaurants.
L:  [COUGH] Mhm.
R:  I find that they're a lot better.  I mean --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- the chain restaurants you know what you're gonna get no matter where you go.
L:  Yeah, that's for sure.  You can get, uh, kind of tired of the, uh, uh, the food --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- pretty fast --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, even though they do have specials now and then, but, uh [SIGH], uh, you know, you have to know your prices I think --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it has to be convenient to home too.  Do you ever go to the, uh, Chinese style buffet restaurants?
R:  Mm.
L:  Those are a very good value.
R:  I'm not a big buffet person because I [LAUGH] think of the germs and everything.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].  I'm weird, I guess.
L:  Well --
R:  But --
L:  -- you probably might, uh -- uh, you wouldn't look to good eating with the, uh, one of those face, uh --
R:  No [LAUGH].
L:  -- m- masks on either.  A little inconvenient [LAUGH].
R:  No, I just don't like that people let their children touch everything and cough on things.
L:  Well, if you go early and you're the first in line --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- even that's not --
R:  -- that we've done, but we -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  'Cause I've been to some Chinese restaurants where th- the spreads were immense --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, three or four tables -- long tables, you know, you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you, just couldn't really take a little bit of everything, it's impossible.
R:  Well, down where we live, the Chinese restaurants are horrible, but that's -- I think because I grew up eating in Chinatown in New York City and, you know, they're so much better there.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Nothing can compare down here.
L:  I don't know Chinese food enough to make the comparison, so [SIGH] I guess to me, if I see a big spread, I'll -- I'll be happy --
R: [LAUGH].
L:  -- I don't care what [LAUGH] [COUGH] --
R:  No, there --
L:  -- but, um, um --
R:  -- there's a big difference.
L:  Uh-huh.  So, y- you're a bit of a -- a connoisseur then when it comes to eating out?  You sort of pick your places, and you just, uh, you don't really, uh, just g- go haphazardly into any place that, you know, th- -- where there might be a parking spot?
R:  No, no, and right now we're in -- in search for a good Greek restaurant.  We're going --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- all over [LAUGH] looking for one.  We can't find one.
L:  Hm.  Well, um --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- I'm sure you started with the Yellow Pages, didn't you, of the --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- phone book?
R:  Mhm.  Oh, and I've spoken to some, um, restaurant reviewers from different websites --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and none of them have any [LAUGH] ideas either.
L:  I'd be darned.  If you can't find it on a website, now, I'm just wondering, uh, you know, maybe you need to -- maybe if you have any Greek friends, you could talk them into opening a place, uh, in Jersey.  It sounds like they need the, uh, you know, representation there.
R:  I just think that Greek food just isn't big here.
L:  Uh-huh.  Have you --
R:  But, uh --
L:  -- had it over there?  I mean, a- are you familiar w- with it?
R:  What do you mean?  In New York, or ...?
L:  Well, no, the Greek food in general.
R:  Yeah.  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Okay, um --
R:  Um --
L:  -- that's one thing that I -- I -- come to think of it, never, um [SIGH], never really, uh, sampled here unless you go to a, uh, street festival, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where they usually have them.  The churches throw them --
R:  Yes, mhm.
L:  -- in September usually.
R:  That's the only time that we can get good Greek food --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- in our area [LAUGH].
L:  But, that's really not restaurant food.  You just --
R:  No.
L:  -- have to hope that whose ever, uh, uh, doing the church work is a good cook --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, you know, you may be surprised.  But, again, you have to be near a large city, I would think --
R:  Yes, mhm.
L:  -- um, and, uh [COUGH], you know that --
R:  Luckily for me, both of my children live in Manhattan now, so when I go to see them I can at least --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- eat decent food [LAUGH].
L:  Well, I used to live in Westchester, and, um --
R:  Oh, I'm from Westchester.
L:  I used to live in Yonkers and then Pleasantville.
R:  Oh, my daughter went to college in Pleasantville and I'm from Yonkers. 
L:  I'll be darned.  Small world --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, yeah.  I, uh -- I, uh, go down there, uh, now and then just to visit.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but --
R:  Do you know Da Semio's[?]?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Da Semio's Italian restaurant.
L:  I've heard of it.
R:  Oh, very good [LAUGH].
L:  Okay, that's down Central Avenue?
R:  Um, it's off Central Avenue on -- I think it's -- is it Palmer?  I think Palmer.
L:  Oh, on Palmer.  I used to live near Palmer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Right near St Bart's Church.
R:  Oh.
L:  Small world.  Oh, Yonkers has a pretty good representation of restaurants.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Um, but, um, you know, something to look forward to I guess when you go there.  Do you ever go back to visit, uh, and eat out at any of the restaurants in Yonkers when you do go back?
R:  Just Da Semio's the only one that we've been to lately.
L:  Okay.  So, uh --
R:  'Cause I still have girlfriends that live there, that I grew up with.
L:  Yeah, Yonkers has a good hometown atmosphere.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I, uh -- it's, uh -- I -- I like Yonkers.  I really wouldn't want to live there again.  I -- my -- I'm planning to move south [SIGH], uh, way south.
R:  Pleasantville's nice.  My daughter went to Pace.
L:  Excellent.  I used to live near Pace in -- on Pleasantville Road.
R:  Mhm, and then she went to Pace Law actually [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.
R:  So, she's been in the area for a long time.  She lived in -- she just moved into the city from Porchester.
L:  Well, okay, I know that's, uh -- Pleasantville has, um [LIPSMACK] -- has Vinnies on the corner there.  Have you ever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- gone to Vinnies or have you ever gone to the Pizza Hut there?
R:  Uh, the Pizza Hut we've been to with her [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] It doesn't matter where Pizza Hut is, as long as you go there, you've -- they're all the same.
R:  Yeah, they are.
L:  Uh, but, um, well, I tell you this, when you -- when you do go eating out, um, are you ever tempted -- say -- say you take a trip somewhere okay, for the day, are you ever tempted to pack your own lunch?
R:  No, mm.
L:  Um --
R:  We like to try the local color --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- wherever we go.  In fact we just went to New Castle Delaware last week, and, um, for the day, and we ate in a pub there that was unbelievably good.
L:   Okay.
R:  We were lucky [LAUGH].
L:  Some times when you do travel you have to avoid if you can, the, uh, through way, and, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] of places --
R:  Mhm.  Go off the beaten path.
L:  -- [COUGH] Excuse me, 'cause they're pretty expensive.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're pretty darned expensive, but, um [SIGH], um, okay, now, I don't know what, uh, more I can cover with you.  I have to be with you for a certain amount of time --
R:  Yeah, ten minutes.
L:  -- it's only ten minutes, but, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I -- I guess, uh, are -- are you ...?
