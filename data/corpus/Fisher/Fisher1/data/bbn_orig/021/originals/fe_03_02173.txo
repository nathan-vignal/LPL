L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, this -- this is Patty.
L:  Hi, this is Juliet.
R:  [NOISE] Hi, Juliet.
L:  How --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- how are you? [LAUGH]
R:  I'm just ducky.  How are you? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Good.  This is my first c- -- phone call. [LAUGH]
R:  This is mine too.
L:  Oh, all right. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, so, our topic is food.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, I don't know, I like to eat -- I like to eat out.
L:  You like to eat [SIGH] -- I would prefer to eat out [LIPSMACK] [SIGH], except [NOISE] usually I end up eating [NOISE] at home. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, [NOISE] same here.  My husband likes -- he -- he doesn't like to eat out as much as I do, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we end -- I end up cooking --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so ...
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, the great -- I think the great thing about eating [NOISE] out, is the fact that you don't need to clean dishes [NOISE] [LAUGH] [NOISE].
R:  [NOISE] Yeah [NOISE], yeah.  No dishes [NOISE], you don't have to do anything in your house, somebody just to serve you. [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH] Yeah, and it's --
R:  So ...
L:  -- usually interesting things that you would never think of making at home [NOISE].  You go to [SIGH] a k- [SIGH] -- a nice city restaurant --
R:  And [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And what's your favorite type of restaurant?
L:  [SIGH] I think my favorite type of restaurant is, uh, French cuisine.
R:  French cuisine?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I like all sorts of international restaurants [SIGH] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but my favorite is definitely one that's international.
R:  I'm -- I'm a middle eastern fan.
L:  A middle eastern fan?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, there's a lot of great middle eastern restaurants here in Philly.  
R:  Ok- -- oh, you're on the east coast.
L:  I'm on the east coast. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  I -- I'm in southern California.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, you're in Philly?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I went through there, and it's really weird that place --
L:  Oh, Philly?
R:  -- because as we entered -- yeah, as we entered Philadelphia, it was, uh, really bad --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then when we got [NOISE] towards downtown, it's like instantly nice, over one block.
L:  Oh, it is, and -- and the restaurants are [SIGH] kind of the same, except you can find some gems here and there, and the [SIGH] -- the more, not so nice places, but they're [SIGH] tucked away.  There's little Mom and Pop shops, which are great. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, okay.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  You just need to --
R:  So, we talk --
L:  -- do some --
R:  -- about food? --
L:  -- searching --
R:  How -- how does this go [NOISE] really, I wonder?
L:  Huh?
R:  [LIPSMACK] How do we keep talking about food for ten minutes? [LAUGH]
L:  Um, what's your favorite dish? [LAUGH]  What do you eat out?
R:  Um --
L:  Is there a particular middle eastern, uh, [SIGH] food you --
R:  My --
L:  -- love? [LAUGH]
R:  -- well, it's really kebab, and I'm a --
L:  Oh, shish kebabs --
R:  -- I'm like, uh, an appetizer fanatic.
L:  Oh, yeah, oh. 
R:  Tahina[?] and hummus, and pita and --
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, so, ganush and that kind of thing.
L:  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, ordering appetizers -- like just sometimes it's really nice just to order three different appetizers as your meal. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's -- I -- that's -- [NOISE] and actually, quite frankly, I could deal without the meal, actually just getting the appetizers. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right. [LAUGH]
R:  And what about you for French food?
L:  Um, I'm more a [NOISE] dessert person [LAUGH], so ...
R:  Okay.
L:  I love like, all the different kinds of crepes, and like, the pastries of [SIGH] French pastries, as long as it's like really fresh and done that day, that's what I love.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I like -- I like pastries.  I -- I'm a fairly decent baker, [NOISE] so, I bake a lot of stuff and I [NOISE] do -- I get like, you know, puff pastry, and I'll make barracas[?], which is [NOISE] cheese filled puff pastry --
L:  Ew.
R:  -- and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, it's pretty good.
L:  [NOISE] Wow.
R:  Not too bad --
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  -- stuff[?].
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- I mean, I usually wind up in -- eating at home, but I'm a student, so, my time is always just like, "Whip something up quick [LAUGH] like cheese and macaroni". [LAUGH]
R:  See, you -- oh, you're good.  If you're a student, and you're -- and you're cooking, that's impressive [NOISE].
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I'm a stay at home mom, indep- -- you know, independent insurance agent, so, I only go out like once or twice a month --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, I can stay home with my son.
L:  Yeah?  Oh, that's fantastic.
R:  Yeah.  It's pretty cool.  I waited -- waited a long time. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Hm [NOISE].  So ...
L:  Oh.
R:  So, you're in -- you go to just college then?
L:  Yeah, I go to college.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, but I'd never --
R:  Very cool.
L:  -- eat at school. [LAUGH]  School is not --
R:  Well --
L:  -- on my list of places I'd like to eat. [LAUGH]
R:  I can't imagine it could be that awful.
L:  Hm?
R:  I don't --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- imagine it could be that awful.
L:  It gets monotonous.  They use the --
R:  Does it?  Oh they --
L:  -- same menu, like, and they rotate it like every two months, so, you can kind of guess what you're going to get [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on a particular day, um ...
R:  Huh.  'Cause I used to work in school districts, and that included -- I'd go to college campuses, and I was a seminar speaker where I'd -- about their bene- benefits [SIGH], and sometimes I would end up eating in the cafeteria, and it wasn't too bad.  It was pretty diverse.
L:  Yeah.  No, I mean, uh, [NOISE] at the ca- [NOISE] -- the food at school is [NOISE] pretty diverse, it just -- it just starts tasting the same.  I think you need something --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- different [LAUGH] if you're --
R:  Got ya.
L: -- doing it every day.
R:  I understand.
L:  So ...
R:  [SIGH] Oh.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Hm.  I'm in the grocery store right now as we talk about food.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, you're on a cell phone?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I figure that's the easiest way to do it, 'cause I run around so much, so --
L:  Right.  Well, actually, come to think of it, I'm going to a Mexican restaurant tonight.
R:  Ooh.
L:  Yeah, apparently there's this --
R:  Now, I --
L:  -- fantastic Mexican restaurant here in Philly that actually serves like authentic Mexican food, and not like Tex Mex food. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Tex Mex, yes, I'm moving to Texas in two weeks. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  Yeah, and they have hideous Mexican food.
L:  Yeah, they do. [LAUGH]
R:  Absolutely hideous.  I couldn'- --
L:  I used to -- I used to live in Texas, and I was like --
R:  You did?
L:  -- "Oh, man". [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Okay.  Where?  In, um, Austin or ...?
L:  Uh, I used to live just outset of Houston.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, in, uh, a little place called the Spring, Texas.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I'm moving to Denton, Texas, which is just north of [SIGH] Dallas --
L:  I --
R:  -- and ... 
L:  -- spent --
R:  Have you been there?
L:  -- a year at, like, uh, middle school --
R:  North Texas University?
L:  No, middle school in -- at Denton.  It's the --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- little private school called Selwyn School.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, it's right in Denton.  Yeah, it's like --
R:  That is very cool.
L:  -- a few miles away from the Women's -- North Women's College, or whatever it's called.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's two [NOISE] --
L:  It --
R:  -- wow --
L:  -- it's been a long time [NOISE], but when I remember being there, where I was --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- it was just like there was a Denny's restaurant, and that was it. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no --
L:  But I'm sure --
R:  -- the place has --
L:  -- changed. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Oh, completely --
L:  And grown.
R:  -- there's everything.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Everything you can imagine, it's there now.
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  So, yeah, it's a [NOISE] -- it's a small big city.
L:  Yeah.  Oh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that would be nice.  The weather was nice [NOISE], it's not as [NOISE] hot as it is in, uh, Houston, not as humid.
R:  Yeah, and it's not as hot as, uh, or humid as in, you know, the southern areas [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Texas.
L:  So, what's -- what's popular, sort of restaurant wise in southern California, where you're at?
R:  Southern -- oh, everything.  There's nothing real -- oosh[?] -- there's no standard.
L:  Oh, okay, there's --
R:  And you've got -- you've got everything here, and the best of everything.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  There's one thing I will miss, is the restaurant quality --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is definitely here.  You want Thai food, you go get real Thai food, you want --
L:  Right.
R:  -- Vietnamese food, you get Vietnamese food --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Yeah.  I mean, in Philly there's only two Vietnamese restaurants that you can go to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- to get real Vietnamese food [NOISE].  I'm half Vietnamese, so, to me, it's just like, "Oh, I wish I was in Boston, 'cause Boston has like, really great Vietnamese [NOISE] food.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Boston does.
L:  Boston does, in, uh --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- their Chinatown area, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- really great Vietnamese food, and like we go out and it's like, "Oh, this tastes like my mom's cooking", like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- whereas here in Philly, they -- there's only two restaurants to choose from, and they're oh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they like to mix, uh, uh, Vietnamese cuisine with like, uh, kind of Nuevo Pacific style, so ...
R:  Oh, yeah, it's not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not the same.  I have a little place I go to, Boso[?], which I might go to tonight, 'cause my in-laws are taking the baby --
L:  Oh, great.
R:  -- so, I m- -- we -- my husband and I might go there tonight, and, it's true authentic Vietnamese food.  I mean, that's -- you know, the menu is, uh, there's a small menu in English --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I just point to what I know, "Number fifty six" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [COUGH] But you know, they give you the soup --
L:  Right.
R:  -- where they have the thinly sliced raw meat --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you just throw it in the hot soup and that's when it cooks.
L:  Yep.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yep, I know exactly what you're talking about, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Yeah, LA, definitely, if you like restaurants, you come here.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, wow.
R:  Um, it's not -- there's no lack of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- good stuff and quality.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, that's just the same, kind of here in Philly.  There's just -- you have to really search for it.  We have a lot of middle eastern restaurants though that are really nice, like, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Moroccan -- we also have -- oh, I'm going to say, in addition to middle eastern meals, have Moroccan, and a lot of Ethiopian restaurants, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- going further down North Af- -- uh, South Africa, yeah --
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  -- which is really good.
R:  They -- they all have really the same flair.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I mean, they -- it's -- it's pretty basic.  You always have good appetizers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and meat and rice.
L:  Yeah, and then also --
R:  But, you definitely [inaudible].
L:  -- well, they're -- they do really well with the preparation of lamb --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that most other restaurants kind of stick with, uh -- serve like a traditional lamb racks and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- lamb chops, whereas --
R:  Now, you can get lamb kebabs --
L:  Yes, lamb stew --
R:  That's -- ye- --
L:  -- and like all sorts of lamb.
R:  Truly the only time I really will eat lamb at all, is lamb kebabs.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I'm not a lamb fan.
L:  Right, but ...
R:  Well, was that our beep?
L:  I don't know.  I thi- -- I think --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- the computer comes back on.
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Well, I have no idea. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Neither do I. [LAUGH] But, oh, it --
R:  See, this is my first call [NOISE].  You got this off the internet?
L:  Huh?
R:  [NOISE] You go this [NOISE] off the internet [NOISE] obviously, right?
L:  [NOISE] Uh, my friend clued me in to it.  My friend's [NOISE] at U Penn --
R:  Oh. [NOISE]
L:  -- so ...
R:  Oh, [NOISE] okay.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, so, [NOISE] she knows [NOISE] the department [NOISE], I think, at the U Penn study.
R:  Okay, [NOISE] very cool. [NOISE]
L:  Yes, so, you know --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I got hooked up [NOISE] on the internet, so ... [NOISE]
L:  Ah.
R:  [NOISE] On a coupon site actually. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, yeah? [NOISE]  Wow.
R:  Yeah, of all the weird things [NOISE] --
L:  That's crazy. [NOISE]
R:  So ... [NOISE] [SIGH] [NOISE] What, uh [NOISE] -- I looked at the -- [NOISE] I went to [NOISE] the main site [NOISE], and kind [NOISE] of looked [NOISE] at it, [NOISE] and [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah [NOISE].
R:  -- it's kind of interesting [NOISE].  I guess they're [NOISE] developing [NOISE] some [NOISE] type [NOISE] of ways to [NOISE] recognition [NOISE] software. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Right, right [NOISE].  Oh, [NOISE] I have dogs here, [NOISE] and they're chasing [NOISE] cats. [NOISE]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] [NOISE] I can hear [NOISE] your dog [inaudible] ...
