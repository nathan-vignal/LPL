L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Alyssa.R:  Hi, I'm Debbie.
L:  Hi, it's nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you. [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH] Where are you calling from?  Or getting called to? [SIGH]
R:  Oh, Queens, New York.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Manhattan, Kansas. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh [SIGH] okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You're in Manhattan, Kansas?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Not a coincidence. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I know, that's why I was laughing. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Ah. [COUGH]
L:  [MN] Oh, right, so I guess we're supposed to talk about --
R:  Friends.
L:  Um, yeah. [MN] [SIGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH] So, would you say you have a lot of friends and --
R:  Um.
L:  -- acquaintances or just a few close ones? [MN]
R:  I have a lot of acquaintances, but I would say just a few close friends.
L:  [MN]
R:  What about you?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, yeah.  I -- I would say the same thing.  Like the people that I would consider my really good friends, I only have a few, but I definitely [SIGH] like keep in touch with a lot of different people. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] Um, [NOISE] do you think most of yours are pretty -- are they pretty much like people you grew up with, or [MN] --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, actually, I probably only keep in touch with [COUGH], you know, two people from high school.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  And most of the people are [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, you know people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I've know, I would say the last five to ten years.
L:  Ok-
R:  Although, my best friend I've know for -- yeah, I guess like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- twelve years. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay, wow. [SIGH] [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I met her on the job.
L:  Oh, that's nice. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  And -- yeah, so we just connected --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, you know, even though we're not working there anymore we still keep in tough. [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I would say that most of my adult friends that I'm [NOISE] still really close with are from work too, which is really interesting. [MN]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [MN] I don't really -- well, I keep in touch with a couple of people still from high school.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I tend to kinda lose touch with them, and then find them again after a couple of years [LAUGH] and then lose touch with them and find them again.
R:  Right, yeah.  As a matter of fact --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a friend of mine who I used to kind of get holiday cards from, and I used to keep in touch with, I've just lost touch with and I don't have her phone number and ...  It's funny because -- you ever check out that, um, em- oh, no, website --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- called classmates?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, I saw her on there, she's listed on there.  And I listed my name, but you have to subscribe to the service.  I guess you pay a --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- premium or something to get her email.  But I'm considering doing it just to get in touch with her.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Plus, ah, it's -- it would be my twenty five year reunion [COUGH] --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- this year, and I really wanted to see if they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- were gonna do a reunion --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I haven't heard anything about it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I was trying to find out, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on the internet, whether there was anything planned, and I haven't seen anything anywhere.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  And, ah, I thought that would have been really cool to meet up with some of these people.
L:  I know, it would be. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Are you still living in the same area where you grew up?
L:  No, actually I grew up in Washington, in Seattle.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  So, that's a big distance.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, actually the people that I still keep in touch with from high school don't live in Seattle any more either.  So, I -- I don't every really get the opportunity to see them, which is a shame.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] And then I actually just moved to Kansas, um, back in September.
R:  That's a big change, huh?
L:  So -- yeah, very big. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- my cousins lived in Kansas for a while, they lived in Lawrence.
L:  Oh, okay, yeah.  Lawrence is a little bit better actually than Manhattan. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, is it. [LAUGH]
L:  So, [LAUGH] yeah. [LAUGH]  But [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They l- -- they lived there I guess for about --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- five years.  They m- moved around a lot 'cause my uncle was a contractor and he used to build, ah, [LIPSMACK] like roads and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- homes and things like that.  So, he was always taking these jobs in different places.  So like --
L:  And he -- that must -- 
R:  Huh?
L:  That must have been interesting for the family. [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.  Yes and no, right?  You know, I mean --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I -- I don't think I would've liked being uprooted like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean I grew up in New York.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I mean, the only big move that we made --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was from Jersey, when I was five.
L:  Oh, wow. [SIGH]
R:  And then, the rest of the time has been spent in Queens, New York.  And I've just never left Queens, New York.
L:  Wow.
R:  So but --
L:  But --
R:  No, go ahead.
L:  Do you think that it's easier for you to keep in touch with people because you kind of grew up there, and you're all still in the same place?  Like, are -- do most of your friends, like who you met there, still live there, or have people moved away?
R:  I don't think it is really that easier, because I -- yeah, I think people have gone elsewhere, --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- and you just kind of change, you know, you change your direction --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and where you're going so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  You -- I really haven't kept in touch with those people.  You know, except for like the two friends that I have from high school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like just, um, they moved out to Long Island and, you know, we've just kinda like kept us -- they m- they wound up getting married and, um, you know, we just kept in touch.  Um, [MN] but the rest of them?  I really have no idea, you know.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  And even though I'm still in Queens, I think some days like, "Maybe I'll run into somebody" but I really don't. [LAUGH]
L:  Doesn't happen. [LAUGH]
R:  So -- [MN]
L:  I think, you know, that's interesting because I would say -- like 'cause a lot of the people that I keep in touch with now, especially like email has made such a difference in the number of --
R:  Right.
L:  [LIPSMACK] -- um, kind of a- close acquaintances that I keep in touch with.
R:  True.
L:  Um, and I would say -- like there are people that I keep in touch with that, you know, I met when I lived in Seattle.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] And I w- don't necessarily have all that much in common with them any more.
R:  Right.
L:  But it's not that hard to kinda send them an email every once in a while --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and still keep in touch that way, whereas, I think if I was actually living there we probably wouldn't keep in touch --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because we would have to always make excuses why we weren't seeing each other and things like that. [SIGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, I think that probably makes it a little easier. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, it definitely does.  My email address list keeps growing and growing --
L:  Mine do- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] -- and it's so easy to just, you know, pass on a, you know, a joke or a poem or, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- something and, you know, just kinda like keep in touch that way.
L:  I know, it's so nice.  I did some travelling, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- while I was in college actually.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it was really interesting because, um, [LIPSMACK] I went back -- I probably travelled about five years after that again and the first time I went travelling, [SIGH] nobody ha- I mean a few people had email addresses, but not many at all.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I don't keep in touch with anybody that I met on that trip.R:  Yeah.
L:  And then five years later I went back and travelled some more and I met, [SIGH] you know, the same amount of people, but then all of a sudden every body had email addresses.
R:  Right.
L:  And I k- still keep in touch with, you know, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [NOISE] probably fifteen or twenty people in other countries that I just wouldn't if I didn't have email. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's interesting.
L:  So ... [LAUGH]
R:  It's really interesting.
L:  It's made a huge difference. [SIGH]
R:  It's brilliant, the thing[?].  Yeah, well, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we're considering relocating now, me and my husband, [COUGH] because we have a baby and, [SIGH] you know, we just want to --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- have, ah, him grow up in a different kind of environment, 'cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Queens is nice --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, you know, like to get into a good school -- you really wanna get into a private school. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's very expensive.  And housing is very expensive here.  So, we're thinking about going down to Florida.  And --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- something that's kinda preventing us from doing that though, is the fact that we have friends and close ties here.  And, you know, it -- it would mean making new friends, you know, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and both of us have kind of like, you know, we've both grown up in New York.  We've never lived outside of New York, so we're kinda like afraid to make that move, but at the same time we know it's like, you gotta grow up. [LAUGH] You know?
L:  Yeah, I know. [LAUGH]
R:  And you have to sometimes make these choices.  And, you know, [MN] that -- I think that's probably gonna happen within the next year.
L:  Is that -- yeah that -- I mean, that is hard because, my husband and I, we actually just got married this last summer and then moved out here to Kansas --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's really hard to make friends, kinda the older you get it seems.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's like when you're in high school or college or whatever, you're kind of with these larger groups of the people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and you all have something major in common and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it's just [SIGH] -- I don't know, it's really interest-
R:  Yeah, you have to find something that, ah, mutually ties you into somebody.  Like, if you have a child it's easier --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  -- because you meet other mothers --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, in play groups and things like that.  Um ...
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  And around here, I mean, it's very like conservative mid west and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, a lot of people are very religious and so church is a major like place for people to go --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and socialize in.  My husband and I, neither of us are religious --
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  -- like we don't attend church.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- so I can see -- you know, because there is another co-worker of my husband's that moved here at the same time with her husband --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they attend church and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, that kinda gives you like a little automatic --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- social life around here and ...  And besides that, besides kind of the university and [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, religion, there's not a whole lot going on around here.  It's not like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you can go out and sign up for --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a class at night, 'cause there just aren't any.  So, like ...
R:  Well, something that my husband and I have, [COUGH] that -- I'm gonna just confide to you because I don't know who you are and you're never going to see me ag- talk to me again -- [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- is that we're both in AA.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And, that's how we met.  And, um, so we know that wherever we go there's going to be an AA meeting.  So, we always meet people.  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we know that if we went down to Florida that we would immediately meet a group of people who would open their arms and kinda like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just welcome us.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  You know, so that's kinda like an advantage --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to being an alcoholic. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's a very, like, positive spin on that.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, right.
L:  I've never ever though of that advantage, but that is nice. [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I guess it's kinda good motivation to keep attending the meetings and things like that too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it is, it is.
L:  Wow.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] so that's kinda like an incentive, you know, for us to move is that we know that we'll always
