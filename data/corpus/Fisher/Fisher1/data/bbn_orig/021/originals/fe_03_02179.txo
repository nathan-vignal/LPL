L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Janice.
L:  Janice, I'm Fernando.
R:  Oh, hi, Fernando.
L:  How're you doing?
R:  How're doing today?
L:  [SIGH] So, the topic is food, huh?
R:  Yeah, whether you like eating in a restaurant or eating at home better. [LIPSMACK] That's a hard --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- one. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] --
L:  I actually --
R:  Who doesn't --
L:  -- like restaurants.
R:  Do you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you?
L:  [SIGH] I just[?] --
R:  You don't like to cook or ...?
L:  Do I like to c- -- I like to barbecue.
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] I think, uh, I like to try restaurants, 'cause like when I go out of town travelling, the restaurants there, you know.
R:  Oh, okay.  See, I love to -- I'm a cook, so, I love to cook. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, and it's not -- I don't know if it's so much about eating the food, but it's about cooking the food, and actually, you know, people like -- after I make something, and people are like, "Oh, my God, you made this?  It's so good." [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I see, mak- --
R:  [SIGH] So ...
L:  -- like --
R:  I think I would have to pick home.
L:  Home?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um --
R:  Are there any certain types of restaurants that you like to eat at, or ...?
L:  All of them. [LAUGH]
R:  All of them? [LAUGH] Do you enjoy like, sit down more than like fast food, or ...?
L:  Yeah, I do.  I -- I'd --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- rather just sit down and relax, 'cause I'm always busy, so, I'm always just --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- eating and going [SIGH].
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, that's what like weekends are for, just go out and sit down, take m- -- take my time and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- relax and, you know.  Um, just -- I like, you know, chicken s- sandwiches and cheese burgers, and --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I like Greek food and --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- and all Asian foods I tasted I like. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, uh --
R:  How 'bout -- do you like any kind of Mexican or Italian kind of food or ...?
L:  Ah, I was just about to say that right now --
R:  Oh, okay [LAUGH] --
L:  -- Mexican's my favorite.
R:  Mexican?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, see, I -- I just like the sour cream and everything on there.
R:  Oh, you like sour cream with guacamole?
L:  Yeah, and, you know, chicken tacos and stuff like that, I like that stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  I'm definitely a sauce person, so, I like, like hot sauce and you know, salsa and stuff like that.  I don't --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- care -- yeah, I don't care for guacamole too much [LIPSMACK], um --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- sour cream's okay, but, um, I like --
L:  You don't like --
R:  -- I like salsa, yeah.
L:  You don't like guacamole?
R:  No, not really.  Usually, every time I eat it, when I'm out, I get sick. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Maybe you're allergic to it.
R:  I think -- you know, it's like in the restaurants they put MSG in it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sometimes to keep it fresh, and I -- that just makes me sick.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I like it when I make it at home, 'cause I don't put anything in it, um --
L:  Oh, okay, preservative --
R:  -- but --
L:  -- is what it is.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  It's preservatives make you sick.
R:  Yeah, that's what it is, so, every time I think of guacamole, I think of getting sick. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I can see why you like home cooking.  It is healthier.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what you p- -- you know what you put in there.
R:  You can pretty much make your, uh -- make it how you want it too.  I mean, I worked in a lot of different restaurants, you know, in the kitchen --
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  -- [SIGH] and, you know, my favorite is, you know, going back there and making what -- what you want, how you want it, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and if you're a good cook, then everything tastes just as good as, you know, when you're in the restaurant.  At least I think it does --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] and I can, you know, pretty much decide at the last minute, what I want to make --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and then go from there, whether it be like Italian or Mexican.  My favorite is spaghetti. [LAUGH]
L:  Spaghetti?  I like spaghetti.
R:  Spaghetti.  I could eat spaghetti seven days a week and never get tired [LAUGH] of it [LAUGH], never --
L:  I --
R:  -- never --
L:  I like tortellini.
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  With sausage.
R:  I like angel hair pasta with, uh, meat sauce.  That's --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- just my all time favorite.
L:  [SIGH] I like, uh, stuffed mushrooms.
R:  Ew, yeah.  At -- Olive Garden has really good stuffed mushrooms.  Have you tried their appetizers?
L:  No, I haven't tried theirs.  I -- I usually go in there and get like spaghetti or something like that at the Olive Garden.
R:  Yeah, they have a really good, like, sampler appetizer, has like calamari and, um [SIGH] --
L:  Mm, calamari[?].
R:  -- the mushrooms and, uh, mozzarella, and a couple of other things.
L:  I -- I love --
R:  It's pretty good.
L:  -- calamari.  I like seafood, just --
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  -- I -- I drove down the -- the coast to Pismo Beach --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- 'cause I'm from central California.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, uh, we went over there, me and my girlfriend, and we went over there, and we had a bread bowl of, uh -- with, uh, clam chowder.
R:  Ooh --
L:  It w- --
R:  -- okay.
L:  -- good.  I love it.  I love --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- sour dough bread.
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] --
L:  So, I have to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- watch it, 'cause I like food --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, I had -- I had to learn -- I was getting a little heavy there, so, I had to learn to eat slow, and savor the food, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how to spread it out.  I lost --
R:  So, you haven't learned that yet? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's hard.  It's hard --
R:  It is.
L:  -- to be like this, you know --
R:  Very hard.
L:  -- I -- I lost some inches.  I got slimmer but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's always like there, I always want that food, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you know, I guess, my perfect meal would be delicious anything you want.  B- -- a big buffet --
R:  Oh, yes.  I love buffets. [LAUGH]
L:  You --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- eat it all and don't have to worry about getting heavier.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] You know, I -- I -- for me, I could eat a lot of protein, but I can't do too good on carbohydrates.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So, uh, it has to be a high protein.  They're making pasta now, out of soy beans.
R:  Really?  I'll have to try that --
L:  I never tried it --
R:  -- 'cause I mean, I tried to eat soy, you know, soy products --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, at one time I shredded it up and kind of made like an egg salad sandwich out of it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, with like mayonnaise and mustard, and that tur- -- tasted okay, but [SIGH] I just have a hard time eating it.  I know it's good for you, but [LIPSMACK] ...
L:  Yeah, well, I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was best, 'cause it -- like in this -- this pasta, it's mostly protein, [SIGH] even though it's not complete protein.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  It's mostly protein, but it's lower carbohydrates.  I could eat that all day --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and see, protein keeps you from munching.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I- if you love sugar or -- or, you know --
R:  Yeah, I crave --
L:  -- short [inaudible] --
R:  -- sugar.
L:  -- carbohydrates.  Yeah, you get -- you -- you want to eat more.
R:  More but -- yeah.  
L:  So, uh --
R:  So, if you, um, could go anywhere for dinner tonight, where would you go?
L:  [SIGH] If I could go anywhere for dinner tonight?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's a good one.  I'd probably go to Hometown Buffet. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] All right, my kind of man.
L:  'Cause I -- I --
R:  My husband doesn't -- my husband hates it there.
L:  He does?
R:  He thinks that --
L:  Why?
R:  -- he thinks it's bland.  But I love it because I get to choose whatever I want, you know, I got all these choices in front of me, and it's not just, [SIGH] "Okay, I'll have, uh, tacos tonight".  You know, I can have tacos and [SIGH] salad and spaghetti and everything.  He -- he hates it when I say, "Can we go to Hometown Buffet?" [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know. [LAUGH] --
R:  And we like --
L:  -- I love it there.
R:  -- we go to Laflin a lot, and, so, when we go to Laflin, I always make sure I drag him to the buffets, 'cause, uh --
L:  Oh, Laflin?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know in Los Angeles -- I mean, I'm s- sorry, Las Vegas I'm thinking of [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- Las Vegas over in Aladdin --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- downstairs they have a buffet.  It's a g- -- it's like twenty dollars a person --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's kind of pricy, but it's a good buffet.  He will like --
R:  Really?
L:  -- it.  It's not as bland.  They got really good tasting food, but the buffet, all you can eat.
R:  Yeah, you know what?  He's pretty good about going, like when we go to Laflin in Las Vegas, he'll go to [SIGH] like Harrah's is our favorite --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- uh, they have a really good buffet.  They always have fresh seafood, you know, um, crab legs, and you know, shrimp and all sorts of stuff.  So, [SIGH] when we go down there, he doesn't mind me dragging him, but like to Hometown, duh, Buffet and stuff, he won't.  He gets upset when I say, "Well, I want to go to Hometown Buffet". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Eat --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  In Las Vegas, there's a small casino called the -- the -- I think it's called the Boardwalk, uh --
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  -- or something like that, and they have a twenty four hour buffet.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's not as good as, of course, as Aladdin's buffet --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but it's -- if it's eleven o'clock at night -- twelve o'clock at night and you're hungry --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- get down there, and they got desserts.  They got all sorts of stuff.
R:  Ooh.
L:  You know, um -- [SIGH] you know what I really like a lot, is hummus.
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  I like it on --
R:  I've had it a couple times, but, um [LIPSMACK], you know, I didn't -- I don't know -- I -- I mean, I ate it and it was okay, but, um, I don't know, I just didn't care for it that much.
L:  Oh, I love it.
R:  I put it, um, in pita bread --
L:  I love --
R:  -- you know, like --
L:  -- it with pita, yeah.  It's so good --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] with garlic on it.
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- it's good.  I like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's different -- you know, some hummus is not as good as others.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  But it's -- what it is, is garbanzo beans.
R:  Is it?
L:  Gr- --
R:  --  I didn't know that.
L:  Ground down, yeah, it's really --
R:  Wow --
L:  -- good.
R:  -- I love garbanzo beans.  I eat those in my salad all the time.
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  I thought --
L:  -- it's great.
R:  -- we also have some Indian friends that make a lot of, um, you know, Indian food, and they always --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- use garbanzo beans and peas.  They like, mix them together with peas and potatoes, and --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it's really good.  I didn't know that's what hummus was.
L:  Yeah, it's great --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- I like -- I like, um -- um -- well, buh[?],  Indian food.  I like, uh -- what do I like?  I like curries ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  When I was living in Los Angeles, we see this restaurant, and we used to go in there, and oh, it's so good.  It's just --
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH]
L:  -- delicious.  I mean, I like -- 'cause I like all [LAUGH] foods, you know --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- uh, it's just --
R:  [SIGH] The first time we went to an Indian restaurant, um, we ordered like, kind of on the hot side --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, oh, my God, we were like -- our mouths were burning, so, they brought us over some yogurt --
L:  Yeah, they --
R:  -- so, like --
L:  -- do that, it's pretty good.
R:  Yeah, I'm like, "Ooh, that's nice". [LAUGH] But I --
L:  And it worked?
R:  -- I like the whole experience of sitting on the ground, and you know, [LIPSMACK] all that kind of stuff, eating with the breads and stuff, that was pretty cool.
L:  Really?  W- we had -- we didn't eat on the ground, we sat at a table.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Uh, I guess it --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- wasn't as, you know, authentic in that sense.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  This is just like a little Mom and Pop place, that, um, [LIPSMACK] we had gone to --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and we sat on the ground, and they -- you know, we scooped everything with the bread and stuff.  They didn't give us any silverware and [LIPSMACK] -- so, it was --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- pretty cool.
L:  [SIGH] Sounds good.
R:  I like, um --
L:  Sounds good --
R:  It --
L:  -- I sort of l- -- when I was going to music school in Hollywood, there was this little restaurant -- little d- -- din- -- uh, kind of like a little stand --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and there was like Greek and Armenian food, and they made these chicken sandwiches --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- in pita bread, with mayonnaise.  It was delicious.  It was like a hit.  Everybody wanted to get it, and it was --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- a meal in itself, and I used to eat that all the time.  If you see this --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it- it's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- delicious.  You just, "Oh --"
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I got to have more of this" and --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's -- it's -- and you had rice boiled in chicken broth.
R:  Ooh.
L:  I mean, it was great.
R:  That's wh- -- yeah, that's what I -- we would do in the restaurant to give the rice more flavor --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is -- put -- use chicken broth instead of water.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's amazing how much better it tastes.
L:  It does.  It t- --
R:  Yeah, I think that's why I like cooking at home, because, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, just being a cook and you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know, I just love to cook. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] You know, I -- I love, you know, having people over.  It's just my husband and I and my ...
