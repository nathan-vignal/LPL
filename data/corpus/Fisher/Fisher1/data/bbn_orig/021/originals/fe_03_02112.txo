L:  Hi, my name is Chundin, I'm from, uh, Hanover, Michigan.
R:  Hey, Chundin, my name is Carl.  I live in Austin, Texas.
L:  Hey.
R:  How -- how're you doin' today?
L:  Pretty good, pretty good.
R:  [NOISE] Have you gotten many of these calls yet?
L:  Yeah, I've gotten a few, actually.  How about yourself?
R:  Uh, I got one on the last run -- go around and this is first one I've gotten on their new system.
L:  Yeah, this is the first time I haven't had to talk about, uh, politics or the Middle East or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Iraq. [LAUGH]
R:  It was like education last time.  Edu- -- computers in education or something like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, friends.  Well, actually -- no, I -- I take that back 'cause they called for my wife once and I took the call for her.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I maybe confused the program that day.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  They were -- they were -- they were wanting to talk about something else.  But that person I thought may have been a computer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] It was re- --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I was -- I'm still not sure if this is really me talking into a machine or not. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
R:  You could be a human.  Anyway ...
L:  [LAUGH] Act- --
R:  Friends.  I -- I'm probably the type to make, uh, a few -- fewer friendships but they are close -- much closer friendships.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, I --
L:  [LIPSMACK] I'm the same way.  Um, I -- yeah, you know, all throughout high school and college and stuff I only had a few good friends, um --
R:  Yeah, I'm fairly sociable but ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, uh, yeah, it's actually my -- my parents are quite different, actually.  They -- they have a lot of, you know, so called friends.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, but I -- I -- I don't have -- I don't have uh -- I don't have a lot of friends.  But, um --
R:  [LAUGH] The so called friends.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Well, my dad sold insurance most of his life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think he -- he's kind of retired now though I still think he does a little bit so he was -- he was always -- I guess he would call all these people his friends. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right. [MN]
R:  Probably my best friend I met when I was ten.  Uh, I'm from Chicago.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He lives out in LA now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  In fact I just got a call from him.  He said, "I finally decided to call you and you're not home".
L:  Oh.
R:  So -- [LAUGH] Yeah, I was out of town for a few days.
L:  See I don't -- I don't think I know anyone from that far back.  I would -- I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I know people but I wouldn't consider them my friends anymore because I just -- I don't really -- I mean, I keep in touch with probably one person from high school.
R:  Mm.
L:  That's about it.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And then all my other friends are -- have been from college so --
R:  Yeah, I don't think I know any of my high school people anymore.
L:  Yeah, high school was a -- was kind of a traumatic experience for me so I -- I --
R:  I went into the service right afterward and left the whole area.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Although I went to grade school and high school in the -- you know, most of grade school and high school in the same place.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just -- I don't know, last time I heard from any of those guys was probably, oh, a dozen years ago.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I could probably go find them [LAUGH] you know, but --
L:  You know -- yeah, you know, I -- I've -- I've tried to look up people on the internet with the same -- with the same name but the problem is a lot of my friends had fairly nondescript names like Chad Crawford or --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, Darren Keller --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and so I -- I -- there's just a ton of them, you know, and so I --
R:  What you don't remember the phone numbers anymore?
L:  No, no. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't think I even remember the area code I used to live in when I was a kid.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, Ed -- Ed and I have kept in touch over the years.  Like I say, we met in, uh -- in the fourth grade and we've just --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  I was best man at his wedding.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And so it was just -- and he lives out in LA, though, which is pretty far so I don't get out to see him that often.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But we keep in touch.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I have, uh -- my -- well, the person I consider my best friend was -- was a college roommate, um, ten years ago and, uh, I -- I keep in touch with him and, um -- but the relationship changes after you're not in close proximity to the person, you know.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I mean, because certainly people change but, um, it's funny how you tend to, um, uh, revert to the person that you were when you were around them --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- when you are with them, you know.
R:  Exactly.  Yeah, we can still --
L:  Kind of interesting.
R:  -- bust each other up with just one little funny word. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, and, um, you know, like, my girlfriend, she won't -- I mean, she'll see a side of me that possibly no one else has seen other than my best friend --
R:  Mhm.
L:  The one I  -- best friend which is kind of, uh, endearing and disconcerting, I'm sure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] You know.
R:  I moved to Austin about five years ago so I've got all -- all new friends now.  I met a girl and moved up here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I -- I was just back in Houston where I used to live and thought, "Well, I could go visit this guy and I could go visit that girl and I could visit these people and -- ah, what the hell".
L:  Yeah.
R:  Forget it, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] I don't keep up with them anymore. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Although I did drive around a little bit to see what buildings had changed. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.  I did -- I did that -- I did that when I went back to California recently to -- to see my parents and I -- I drove -- drove through the neighborhood to see where, you know, all my friends lived and then it had all changed and different --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people, different communities.
R:  Now, back when I was kid Ed and I also ran with a guy named Steve and for, like, the last twenty years, Steve -- Ed and I have been thinking of tracking down Steve.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And we have made furtive attempts over the years and now since the internet's here it seems like it would be easier.
L:  Right.
R:  But there's no telling where Steve is, if he's even still alive.
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  [LAUGH] We were all really tight at -- you know, at that age --
L:  Yeah, but -- yeah.
R:  And since we haven't +keeped up -- kept up with each other, there's no telling what he's like today, if he's still with us.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I actually got a -- it -- it's interesting, I got a email from a guy I was really good friends with in high school.  I hadn't, you know, spoken to him in ten years and he sent me this huge email about his whole life, post high school, and how right after high school, you know, he had a child and, you know, he had all these problems and got back on track and went back to college and it was -- it was just really -- you know, really neat to see that, you know, to -- but, I -- I don't have -- there's something -- I mean, I'm not really too compelled to -- to keep that friendship really, you know, close or anything more than simply, you know, a good friend I used to have and now I know his email address and now I know where he is.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  No, I'm considering next year'll be my twenty fifth, uh, high school re- -- reunion.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  I'm thinking of going back to that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just because --
L:  Yeah, I've -- [SIGH] I've gotten --
R:  Haven't been to the old hood in a while. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, yeah, that's -- that's, yeah -- I'm always afraid of, like, you know, people who you knew who -- I mean, I knew a guy, uh, in high school and then in college I found out he had committed suicide.
R:  Oh.
L:  And that kind of rooted me out and I -- I'm -- I'm a -- that's -- that -- that's kind of scary for me to see who is there and who's not there anymore.  You know, you mentioned that earlier and that's -- that's one fear, I think and then --
R:  [SIGH] Did you --
L:  -- just to see people getting old is kind of a -- another --
R:  Yeah, it's inevitable, though
L:  -- age thing, you know.
R:  I look at myself in the mirror and I still think of myself as the same little kid but I know I'm different. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, I know.  No, I mean, they are --
R:  Did you live in the same place growing up or did you move around?
L:  Yeah, yeah, I grew up in the Bay area, California.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We moved around it seemed like every year.  We lived in LA even for a couple of years --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- back in the late sixties.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I don't -- that's part of why I don't have many very -- what I would call very close friends 'cause we kept moving so much.
L:  Yeah, right, right, right, yeah.
R:  I don't know.  Plus people are strange. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] yeah, yeah and --
R:  And actually probably my last -- my last really good -- really good friend, uh, passed on from liver cancer and this would have been six years ago now.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I only got to know him about the last five years of his life and he was a real good guy.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  He and his wife and I would do all sorts of stuff together.
L:  Wow, so --
R:  He's gone now, she done moved to New York and married another guy --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so I don't talk to her very often any more. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Now -- now, uh, do find that your, uh, closer friends are, um -- are male or female?  What -- is there a gender divide?
R:  Oh, that's a really tough one.  Probably an even mixture of both, um --
L:  Yeah, myself, too.
R:  Um, my honey would probably get a little jealous if she knew that but -- [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right, exactly, yeah, yeah.  My -- my girlfriend gets -- yeah, she, like, you know, she gets a -- a little jealous when I talk to a good friend I've known for a long time on the phone and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  About problems and stuff, you know, but --
R:  But then again she still keeps up with some of her old boyfriends.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, she's the kind of girl that is friends with everybody for their entire life.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And I -- in fact, I met her at one of her ex boyfriend's, uh, at -- at -- at his farm one day at a weekend event.  We were both volunteering at this event and so we hooked up.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, it's all good, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I'm -- I mean, yeah, I'm kind of the type of person to -- once a relationship is over, it's kind of over, over, so I don't know.
R:  Well, I -- I am kind of that way too, though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  When -- when it -- uh, girl wise it's over but the girls that I would say were -- are my friends still are ones that I never did have a romantic relationship with.
L:  Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That -- that's -- that's the interesting thing though that those memories --
R:  Although there's one or two going back to my early twenties that I still keep up with.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know we're just -- probably because we live so far away we can do that, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Right, that's -- right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you -- do you have a, um, easy time making new friends?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, not really.  I'm fairly gregarious but I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I do -- I do not -- oh man, it's hard, that's hard to say, it's hard -- it's hard to put that into words because when -- if someone is my friend I -- I would give of myself to them, no mat- --
L: Mhm.
R:  If they needed anything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, they got it, and that level of trust you can't just give to everybody 'cause you'll die real soon, so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] So I guess in -- in some sense I do limit --
