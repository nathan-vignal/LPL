L:  Hello, I'm Kim.
R:  Hi, my name is Francesca.  What's your name again?
L:  Kim.
R:  Kim.  How're you doing, Kim?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  All right.  Where're you from?
L:  Um, I'm from Georgia.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And  --
R:  I'm from Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, really.  I live in Chicago.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] So, our topic for today is friends.
L:  Yes.
R:  And, uh, I think one of the questions was do you have a lot of friends or do you just have a few close friends?
L:  Well, right now I don't have a lot of friends.  I just moved to this city about two months ago, so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But generally I have a few close friends and I usually just have a lot of other acquaintances --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- with varying degrees of closeness.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And -- and yourself?
R:  Me?  I have -- I would say I have a few friends, uh, maybe one best friend and I -- I can honestly say I don't have the same relationship with my best friend as I did, like, years ago when I was in high school and you would tell your best friend everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now it's -- you know, we hardly -- because of our lives, we're so busy, we really don't get a chance to even sit down and talk and go out that much but, um --
L:  That's too bad.
R:  And I think that's another reason why I only have a few friends because I don't have enough time to go out and really meet people because of work and school.  So, with you being in Chicago, how do you go out and meet people?
L:  Well, I really haven't much [LAUGH] lately.
R:  Okay.
L:  I, um -- probably the one friend that I've made here is a girl that I work with.
R:  Okay.
L:  And she's very nice and I had the opportunity last night -- there was, um -- this girl was having a party and she wanted to introduce me to all her friends but I just was really tired and I had to work today so -- it was like the first social opportunity I'd had and I -- I just couldn't go. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right, but, you know what, there'll be so much more.
L:  I hope so. [LAUGH]
R:  Especially -- you know, the weather's changing, it's getting a little warmer.  I don't know how the weather is in Chicago?
L:  It -- it seems like it might be getting warmer now.  Today was actually low seventies but --
R:  Okay, okay.  And that's when, I don't know, people are going to start going out and having barbecues and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's what I told my friends.  They asked me, "What -- when's the next barbecue?"
L: [LAUGH]
R:  I think that's the only reason why they're probably my friend, just to come over and have -- and eat.
L: [LAUGH]
R:  So, uh -- but usually, um, my close friends that I have, uh, we will go out, um, to the mall, then go out to dinner.  We try our best to get together at least once a month and go out to eat and, uh, I -- most of my friends are teachers, I'm a teacher.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, um --
L:  Do --
R:  But, when I first started out, we all worked in the same school and now we're scattered around at different schools and some people left so we try to get together --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- at least once a month to, um, just [SIGH] talk and, you know -- we don't want to, you know, miss that -- that bonding and that friendship.  So we don't want to have years go by and then not get a chance to -- to see each other or talk to each other.
L:  Yeah.  What do you teach?
R:  I teach kindergarten.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, so I teach the little babies.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And --
L:  I bet they wouldn't like it if they heard you call them babies. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, what I call -- I call them babies in the classroom [LAUGH] and they --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I tell them, "You're my babies" and they're, like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Some of them -- they're -- they're so excited, like, "Oh yeah", you know, "I'm -- I'm her baby" but then the other ones are like -- specially the older, like the six year olds that just turned six throughout the year --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're like, "I'm not a baby".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "I'm a -- I'm a big girl".  I'm like, "No, you're not". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But it's -- it's great but all day you're with five and six year olds --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so it's like --
L:  You need some time to be with adults.
R:  I know.  So, having friends is like just getting on the phone and talking to somebody.  I said, "This is great".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And like I have -- but then most -- then I have friends who all they do is talk on the phone at their jobs.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're all used to, like, talking so that's why we try to get together.  Everyone loves to eat so if you just go out to eat --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You tell them, "I'll take you out to eat", then they're ready to go.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, why did you move to Chicago?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, um, for a change of scenery and --
R:  Okay.
L:  And new opportunities.  Um, my boyfriend just graduated college, we live together --
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um, he graduated from the University of Georgia and I -- he's never lived in a big city before.  Um, I lived in New York for a few months once and, um, -- so, for me, it was -- you know, it wasn't really that weird to come here.  Only it doesn't really feel so much like a big city in Chicago as it does in New York.
R:  Okay, I've never been to Chicago before.  I would love to go but --
L:  It's a very beautiful town, it's just a lot more spread out than, um -- than New York is.  It's not as concentrated.
R:  Now, did you have to leave good friends when you were in, uh, Georgia?
L:  Well, I left probably who -- the person who was like my best friend, um -- we'd been friends since I was in high school and he's a couple of years older than me and we still talk a lot and he calls me and I actually worked with him right before we moved.  Um, he -- he's the manager at a hotel and, um, we worked the night audit together so we got to spend a lot of time together before I -- I moved but I think in a way me moving is a good thing for him because I think that, um, he has a lot of growing to do in his life.
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  So, it's --
R:  Now, how did your parents feel about the move?
L:  [MN] Well, they're -- they're starting to get used to it just 'cause ever since I was eighteen I've -- I've been going off to one place or another.  I also lived in London for about half a year.
R:  Wow.
L:  Um, I just have always been kind of a -- a nomad. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  So -- but the thing is this is the first time where they weren't enraged by the fact that I was moving.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I think it has a lot to do with my boyfriend.  I think they see my life as more stabilized now, which I guess it is.
R:  Okay, okay, now do, um --
L:  But I mostly -- who I mostly miss is -- is my sister and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- she lives in Athens and we became really close over the last year and I miss her more than anyone.
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  And would you say that you and your sister are best friends?
L:  I would say we're very close friends.
R:  Okay.
L:  But it's a different kind of friendship than I ever had with anyone else.
R:  Okay.
L:  Do you have any -- any siblings you consider to be close friends?
R:  Yeah, I have, um, my one brother.  Now, I have one sister, she moved to North Carolina, and, uh, my brother moved to California but he came back to Philadelphia and, uh, I don't see him that much but we talk to each other on the phone, even though we live in the same city.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] We don't see each other that much.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And -- but we'll -- we'll talk on the phone and we'll say how much we're going to get together and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- do something and we don't get a chance to do it but I would say that I'm pretty close to him.
L:  Is he older or younger than you?
R:  He's older than me.  Yeah, he's, uh, about five years older than me.
L:  Hm.
R:  But he acts like a kid so -- I'm thirty one so he --
L:  I'm -- I'm twenty two.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, he's not [SIGH] -- once -- see he used to call me his little sister so now, when he tries that, I'm, like, "Wait a minute".
L:  [LAUGH] Well --
R:  "We're both in our thirties".
L:  My sister's younger than me, um, but she's also taller than me so [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- if I call her my little sister she gets mad. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  And what -- what happened, is your other sister, I mean your sister, is she younger or ...?
R:  Oh, no, she's older.  Now she is --
L:  So, you're the youngest?
R:  Yes, I'm the youngest.
L:  Where did she move to in North Carolina?
R:  Rocky [SIGH] -- Rocky Mount.
L:  Oh.  I grew up in North Carolina.
R:  Oh, no, you know what, no, she did not move to Rocky Mount.  She moved to Rocky Point, I think.
L:  Mm.  Is that in the west?
R:  That is near Wilmington.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, I lived a -- I grew up about an hour away from Wilmington in Jacksonville.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.  So that's -- yeah, that's where she lives now and, I mean, about friends, she has no friends.
L:  Oh.
R:  I mean she's like fifty something years old but she wants --
L:  Wow, so she's a lot older than you guys.
R:  Yes, and she wants the family to come down there so bad because --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- she really doesn't have anybody to --
L:  Is she married?
R:  Yeah, yeah, but, um, I think she -- she misses the -- the closeness of the family and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- being able to, you know, talk to people.  I went down there last summer and I -- I'm a city girl all the way.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I cannot -- I just couldn't deal with this.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, you have to have a car, you have to --
L:  Yeah, I don't like having to own a car.
R:  Ye- --
L:  I'm glad that I don't have to now. [LAUGH]
R:  Right and it's -- it's -- it's hard, it's -- you have to get everything you need to get at the supermarket --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because that's it, you're going to have --
L:  Yeah, like once a week. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  And here, um --
