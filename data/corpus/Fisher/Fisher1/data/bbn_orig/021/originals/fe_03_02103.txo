L:  Hi, my name is Rena.
R:  Hi, I'm Rebecca.
L:  Hi, Rebecca.
R:  How are you?
L:  Okay, and you?
R:  Go- -- I'm good.
L:  Very good.  Uh, we're supposed to talk about friends, I suppose.
R:  Yes, um, our good friends, uh, that kind of thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, well, I've never done this before so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Me neither, so -- so -- [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, well, uh, let me see, um -- I am really more the kind of person -- I have a lot of acquaintances, a lot of people who I like hanging out with --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but, um, I probably only have, like, uh, maybe a handful of really close friends.  Like friends that I totally trust --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just without even thinking.
L:  Mhm, mhm.  Um, I -- I don't have a lot of friends friends.  I -- it's -- it's -- it's kind of similar to you and yet it's a little different.  I have a couple of, uh, close friends that I've known for many years but I tend to be more of a loner type so I don't need a lot of people, um -- I have some acquaintances but, you know, if -- if -- if -- if they're around, good, if -- if they're not, that's okay, too.  I -- I can do things by myself, I don't really need to have a lot of people around me.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  But I would say that my best friend, I guess possibly because I trust her, is my daughter, uh --
R:  Oh, that's so sweet.
L:  [LAUGH] Thank you.  It's just that I -- I trust her, uh, you know, she's blood and all this other stuff.  If it's a -- a friend, um, I don't know it just -- I'm -- I'm -- I guess I'm not a very trusting person so, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  Anyway, my daughter's my -- to me, uh, she's my best friend.
R:  Oh.
L:  If you ask her, she's got other best friends but that's okay, um -- but, you know, it's just -- for me [MN] it's not that important to have many, many friends.
R:  Right, I agree and -- and -- and the acquaintances that I have --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's just, um, I'm around a lot of sport a lot and, like you said, although I'm around a lot of people, I'm an only child --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I -- I -- I -- I would almost much rather -- sometimes much rather be by myself.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, because it's just that's the way I like it and sometimes when I'm around my friends too much --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even my closest friends, I have to have what I call Becca time and just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- be by myself.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  I -- I understand what you mean.  I -- I myself am also an only child so -- I didn't like it growing up but you develop a -- a sort of independence that, uh -- because of that situation so that you can be by yourself, you don't really need to be with a lot of people but I find it interesting that we're both, you know, only children --
R:  That is funny.
L:  -- and, yeah, and we kind of feel the same way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I agree.  Um, I, um, let me see, what else about friends, uh, I recently have, um -- I graduated from college last May --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so I've been out of college for almost a year now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, it's been kind of -- and I've moved -- and it's been kind of -- I've kept my -- my close knit group of friends from college but it's been really hard for me.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  New friends.  I mean, I have a new job but it's -- it's different with -- that work atmosphere is so much more different than that school atmosphere.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Um, so that --
L:  Yeah, no, no, I understand what you mean.  In -- in a school atmosphere you're sort of like all in the same boat, you're sharing things, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's -- it's the first time that maybe you're away from home and you're becoming independent.
R:  Right.
L:  Whereas if you're working and especially if you've moved somewhere --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's completely different.  There's a big expectation and you have to make money.  Whereas in school --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- maybe they have parties and things --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that you do in groups.  At work --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Depending, I mean, there are some, uh, places where you work where they do have, uh, like softball or soccer or things that they do every once in a while but, yeah, the focus is a little different, I think, so --
R:  Right.
L:  It is hard, it is hard.  And also I find that sometimes people are very cliquey.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So it's very hard, then, to -- to get into that clique if you're at work and you've just -- you're new there and other people have been there a long time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's very hard to get in there.
R:  Uh-huh.  Another thing that I found to be a little bit challenging is that, like, while I am making those, like, kind of new acquaintances that might one day end up developing into a -- a meaningful friendship --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, my room mate, who I've had for five years, isn't really in an environment at all where she would meet new people.
L:  Oh.
R:  And so it's been a little challenging because I'm out meeting new people and making new kind of connections --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she's not and sometimes I feel so, um, kind of, sad about that and almost guilty for -- for meeting new people.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I guess if she really wanted to she could make the effort to meet someone also.  I don't think you should feel guilty for something, you know, that she may not -- she may not want to do it.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  You know, because even though she's not in that environment, if she really wanted to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- she could make an effort.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I was just talking about the guilt part that, you know, um, that -- that's -- I know we're supposed to talk about friends --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but it's -- you know, don't -- don't put that burden on yourself, I guess that's what I'm trying to say.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, but anyway we're supposed to -- we're supposed to talk about friends.  Yeah, and, um, I guess you're influenced by her --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- obviously, you know, if -- if --
R:  Well, I am.  I mean, she's -- she's my -- she's -- I was with her for five years --
L:  Oh, well,
R:  -- and while I consider her, um, my -- I consider her one of one closest friends just because she really does know me so well --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because we have lived together for such a long time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but, um, you know th-  -- you can't always be best friends with the people that you live with, you know.
L:  Right, right. [LAUGH]
R:  You can -- [LAUGH] you know, you can't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Can't always do that.  I -- I just think that's great that you said that your daughter was your best friend.  Um, I -- I -- I -- I -- I think of my mother as one of my close friend, you know.
L:  Oh really, oh.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Oh, that's really nice.  That's important because I think then when -- when you have children, you'll -- you'll have that with you and you probably will end up being a best friend or a close friend with your children, you know, when you get to that point.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, uh, it's, I guess, what you bring to it.  But thank you for that.  Um --
R:  No, I think that's great.
L:  I was just -- I was just curious where -- where do you -- where did you finish or where did you go to college?
R:  I went to Austin College in Sherman, Texas.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  And I'm living in Dallas, Texas, right now.  Where are you?
L:  Oh, I'm in New York.
R:  Oh, my god, that's so great!
L:  [LAUGH] This is funny.
R:  It is funny.
L:  I've  -- I've -- I've been to, uh, Dallas Fort Worth.  I just stopped by over there on my way to Mexico.
R:  Ah, fun!
L:  I saw the zoo and, uh, I remember the zoo, and, uh, I think -- yeah, I was there on fourth of July so I remember --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, the -- the fireworks and things but, yeah, everything is big there, you -- that's very true.
R:  Yes, well and it's a little bit more spread out than it is in New York.  I haven't been to New York in about, I'd say five years, five or six years. [NOISE]
L:  Wow, it's -- it's changed.
R:  So, yeah, I had a great ti- -- I had a great time when I --
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's --
R:  When I went there.
L:  It -- it's changed now because of, you know, nine eleven, the atmosphere is a little different --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- than it was before, too.  Do you know what I'm saying?
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  It's true -- it's true.  I -- I -- I give every New Yorker a clap for -- for doin', you know -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  For really just -- making everything work there, you know.
L:  Yeah, yeah, but, uh, we're --we're doin' okay, [LAUGH] we're doin' okay.
R:  Good.
L:  But, um,  I ge- -- we're supposed --  you know, I find it very hard to, like, just focus on one topic for ten minutes.
R:  I know, it's hard.  I can't talk about like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like, just friends forever.
L:  Right [LAUGH].  Exactly.  It's like, ten minutes is too long to talk about one topic.
R:  It's true.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Definitely true.
L:  So I'm, like -- I'm trying to wrack my brains to come up with --
R:  I know.  Well, this one time I had this friend, I -- [LAUGH] I can't think of -- I can't think of -- of -- of every kind of example, you know.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  That's right.  You know, like some people, uh -- I'm just trying to focus on friends again, and it's hard but --
R:  Well, do you have -- I mean, like, are -- are mainly -- many of your -- are a lot of your connections and your friends spread out or are they, like, mainly all in New York?
L:  They're -- um, I guess, they're mostly in New York.  I do have some acquaintances --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- outside.  Uh, there's one in, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in Korea because I -- I went to Korea and -- and, uh, we -- we became, you know, like good friends in a way and then there's another one in Israel so there's a few that are spread out but most of them are in the United States.  Um, but again, I don't really feel I need that much which is good because sometimes you can't count on your friends, so --
R:  Does your daughter live near you?
L:  Actually she had moved out -- she had moved out to Long Island and then, because it became very expensive, New York is very expensive, she came back.  There's actually a -- a kind of a phase or, um [LIPSMACK] -- there's actually a word for -- for -- for kids that have moved out and have moved back home.  There's actually a word for it.  I forgot the word.  But, yes, so she's living at home, uh, for the time being but --
R:  Cool.
L:  Yes, last night we went out -- uh, she's got a boyfriend but the boyfriend's not ready to get married yet --
R:   Yeah.
L:  -- so I'm trying to get her to meet other people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so last night we went to, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sort of, um, like a get together to meet people.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So [LAUGH] it was kinda of weird, we were going together.
R:  It is weird.  Oh that's a -- that's kind of fun, though.  I don't think I could get my mom to do anything like that.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I'm single.  I mean, I don't know if your mom's married or not.
R:  Yeah, she is.
L:  She's single?
R:  No, she's married.
L:  Okay, see that makes a difference.
