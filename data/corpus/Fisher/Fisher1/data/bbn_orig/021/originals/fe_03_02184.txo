I prefer to eat my cooking more than anybody -- I lo- -- I'm used to home cooking.  And look, I love to cook, I love southern cooking. [LAUGH] That's all I -- and look, an- an- an- an- an- and it shows, in my family.  Now, I -- I -- I've just lost a little weight.  I was a little heavier than I was, but look, I'm getting a little trimmer now --

L:  Oh, yeah.  I'm right on the gulf.  Gulf of Mexico.
R:  Get outta here.
L:  Yeah, it ain't probably thirty minutes from my house.
R:  Oh, well, see, I'm going to look on my map when I get off of here.  I just had a little bit --
L:  Yeah, look at Mobile [NOISE] and you'll see Grand Bay a little bit south west of Mobile, right --
R:  Right.
L:  -- near the water.
R:  I didn't know that was really true when they said that about that -- now look, you know, as far as restaurants -- now, if I go out it's usually a seafood restaurant.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or ah, maybe a little Italian.  Well, I say -- and that's rare these days of course, ah, ah, ah, since I ain't married -- I mean, my wife would every now and then.  But now, basically last time we went with my son, I think he had a birthday or something, we went to a seafood restaurant.
L:  Yeah, restaurants --
R:  That's in the city.
L:  -- just got so high you can't come --
R:  But they got right -- f- -- for the portions I get I said, "Man, look, I have to come to my home and eat afterwards". [LAUGH]
L:  That's -- we are -- we go out and eat at some place, it's usually a special event, if we gonna go out, [NOISE] like you --
R:  Exactly.
L:  [NOISE] It's a birthday, or it's something special and we going to go out --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and eat --
R:  Yeah, see --
L:  -- and we don't eat something that we don't cook, not -- yeah, I got four grown kids.
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  Yep, and I got grand kids, so --
R:  Okay, my --
L:  -- you know, you --
R:  -- son's twenty and my daughter's thirteen.
L:  -- you can't hardly afford take all them out to eat.
R:  Oh, yeah, I can imagine.
L:  But you can sure cook at home and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- afford to feed them all.  And to me, home cooking's better anyway.
R:  It is, me too.
L:  You know --
R:  And my -- and my mama knows -- m- -- my mama lives down Georgia and look --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we got a big family, any ways brothers and sisters --
L:  Oh yeah, you're from the south, then.
R:  Yeah, so you know, we all get together.  All my sisters as well.  Boy, you talk about some good time eating! 
L:  That's how we are.  At restaurants --
R:  And I love it.
L:  We're all right.  [NOISE] We're like you, Italian, you know, something that you [NOISE] can't cook.
R:  Right exactly.
L:  Chinese or something like that, that don't --
R:  Something I can't cook at home.
L:  That's -- that's how we are.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We'll go out and eat that, but other than that, we're not big -- we're not big --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- restaurant eaters.
R:  Well, when I'm home -- like yesterday I barbecued, baked greens, potato salad, oh, my --
L:  [NOISE] You sound like us --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's what we did. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Look -- well --
L:  We -- we did chicken and potato salad and baked beans [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, yeah -- yeah, that's -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, that's good.  Yeah, that's great.
L:  All that good food.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  But I -- I -- and I like most of my friends [NOISE] I mean, I -- we've got to where very few -- well, I live out in the country and it -- it's just very few that people that I know that go out and eat --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and you being single.  Now a lot of single people do, but you got your family --
R:  You know, I got my family, and I don't know --
L:  -- so you know, that's hard to do.
R:  And I prefer to eat at -- e- eat home anyway.  Now --
L:  I -- I feel like most people, ah, that eat out are probably single.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know --
R:  Well, look see I can understand right.  Yeah.
L:  That's -- that's what I feel like.  Most people are -- are single and don't have any children.
R:  So your winters are -- you don't have really cold winters down there do you?
L:  No --
R:  Your winters are basically mild, huh?
L:  Mild, but -- yeah.  Yeah, our winters are -- are -- are really mild, in fact you know, you -- for us, we can have a garden --
R:  What?
L:  -- almost year round.
R:  Get outta here.  I didn't --
L:  You know like collards and turnips and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stuff like that, we grow in the winter time.
R:  Well, we -- we have to take ours in a- a- a- at night if we have it, we gotta take 'em in around October.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And my mom said, "You don't want the frost to hit 'em --"
L:  And --
R:  "-- and that's m- maybe a little frost" --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- she said, but if -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, the frost can them tough.
L:  That's right.
R:  But we have to take them in, huh.
L:  And tomatoes and all that kinda stuff, we're the same way here.  Tomatoes and all --
R:  What?
L:  We can grow -- in fact we already getting tomatoes on the vine.
R:  Get outta here.
L:  That's why I say, we like to -- we like to cook and eat at home 'cause from the south, heck, you just --
R:  You know what, it don't -- it -- it -- it don't get no better than that --
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  -- from the garden to the table.
L:  Yeah.
R:  No middle man.
L:  No better than that.
R:  See, I -- the only thing about the city -- you gotta go, the garden, the middle man, the store.  He gotta sit it there, then you get it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, you miss out on some of the freshness.
L:  Yeah.  But that's all right.
R:  [MN]
L:  City life has its good advantages too though.
R:  It has its good, but see, you know --
L:  You got all the good restaurants to choose from --
R:  That's the only thing, well you know --
L:  -- if you decide to go eat.
R:  That's true.  You got the downtown entertainment --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but look, me, I'm at the stage, now, where I could live just quiet.  I don't need a lot --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to make me, ah, ah, excitement.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Look, I can --
L:  Well --
R:  -- sit right here [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that take me a good person then two -- two -- two southerners really by breed. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Look, I can lay here on the porch, put my -- take my shoes off -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, I hear you.  That's how we are --
R:  And look --
L:  -- you know we're laid back down here.
R:  We'll just sit and watch time go by.
L:  That's exactly right.
R:  And there's -- there's not -- there's never a dull moment in the city.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Always something, you know?
L:  That's exactly right.  That's what I say, it's -- it's -- I guess it's got there, ah, I think most southern people, even if you move away, or like that, home is better than out.
R:  Let me tell you something.  My -- my mom and them, they still talk about the -- I just sit around and they tell me the days and my aunts, you know, when they come over the days in the south, the eating and all get together and they -- oh, man!
L:  Yeah.
R:  I yearn for them days.
L:  That's what I say.  Boy, they couldn't have picked a good subject for food, 'cause we -- [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  When I heard that -- [LAUGH]
L:  -- we healthy people around here.  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Look [LAUGH] I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I stayed home, I couldn't wait to get on the phone.
L:  I know it.  I know it.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  That's how we are.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's exact- -- in fact, we're sitting down now to um, squash and cabbage --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and --
R:  Oh what?  Squash f- from -- from your garden?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, my [inaudible].
L:  Squash and cabbage and um, ham.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] that's good. [LAUGH]
L:  So you know, we're home cooking it.

L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- my mom ju- -- oh man, she loves it.
L:  Yeah, yeah, she's from a good state, Georgia.
R:  Yeah, oh man, we love Georgia.
L:  She's some [MN] --
R:  We go back there once a year for family reunion.
L:  Oh yeah and I bet you all have a feast.
R:  And when they have -- you talk about -- look --
L:  I bet you do.
R:  A- -- and one day it's a fish fry, one day is a barbeque, and one day where everybody do call a pot luck.
L:  Oh, yeah, bring what you want to.

L:  Cast iron skillet.
R:  We want -- right.  That's -- what you call it?
L:  That's what you going call it.  Cast iron skillet.
R:  Cast iron skillet.  'Cause we wouldn't have had one up here, and don't nothing fry fish better than that.
L:  Oh no, oh no.  It's --
R:  Lord, you talk about a fish fry, you could just see all the fish that are thrown to the top.  You just scoop it on out and throw some more in there.  It make the best fish you ever tasted in your life.
L:  That's what I -- that's what I [NOISE] -- if we go out and
