L:  Hello?
R:  Hello. [LAUGH]
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Have you done this before?
R:  No, have you?
L:  Me -- no, me neither.  First time --
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  -- for both of us.
R:  Me, neither.  Well, I'm Laurie.
L:  I'm Barb.
R:  Okay.  Um, okay, our topic is food.  I guess whi- -- which do we enjoy eating the most, I guess, in a restaurant or at home?
L:  Right.
R:  Okay.  Um, [LAUGH] well, I enjoy going to a restaurant more, but it's more convenient to do it at home because I've got a three and a four year old, so it' s more of a hassle to go to the restaurant.
L:  Oh, but it's --
R:  But I love going to the restaurant.  I love going out to eat.
L:  Well, when somebody else prepares it for you --
R:  I know.
L:  -- and cleans it up and gives you a choice of what you want ...
R:  I know.
L:  It's just delightful. [LAUGH]
R:  It is.  It is.  It's a lot of work, but you know I got this um, this new book that actually just came today.  I ordered it.  It's the Suzanne Sommer Sommercize[?] and it has all these recipes in it.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I thought, "Well, you know, maybe if they're easy enough to -- to do, you know, maybe I'll start cooking more at home, and that'll be easier", but they're supposed to be pretty good recipes and I've got a whole two, um, a set of two books that came so --
L:  Well, if you have a good recipe and it's something everybody'll eat then you know, that always seems to be the best part about eating at home.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, we tend to eat at lot of chicken and broccoli and um, [LIPSMACK] so it's always a treat to go somewhere else --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- because then you get such a different -- you know, you get a variety -- a better variety.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you've got little kids, though.  That makes it a little harder.
R:  It does.  It does.  It makes it -- I mean 'cause, you know, it's -- it -- it's -- when they're three and four they're harder to -- they have a short attention span.  So --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, to take them out -- they're -- they're okay for about ten minutes, but after that first ten minutes, they're like, "Okay --"
L:  We're done. [LAUGH]
R:  "-- wanna go play now, you know, we're done" --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you -- [LAUGH] you know -- [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  So you -- if you take -- if we take the kids we have to find one of those, you know, quote unquote, family restaurants --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that's not my idea where I'd really want to go.  They love going to like, the Pizza Place pizza buffet, well they're happy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That is not mommy and daddy's idea of going out to dinner. [LAUGH]
L:  No.  It's um, our girls -- I remember when they were at that age.  They're thirteen and sixteen now, so I- I've already been through that, but it's um, [LIPSMACK] it's sure a treat when you do get to eat out.  Just, I think, um, [SIGH] 'cause somebody else gets to do all the thinking and preparing and [LAUGH] ...
R:  Well, it's just ea- -- it's just fun.  It's nice to get away from the house.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It is, so ...
L:  I remember --
R:  Although I'm not home a lot either, I mean, I guess if I were at home all the time, I'd really be glad to go -- but I'm not home all the time, but even if I w- -- even if I were I'd -- I think I'd still want to go out more --
L:  Well --
R:  -- to eat out.
L:  -- it -- it's -- yeah -- we use our entertainment book a lot.
R:  Mhm.  Oh, we've got one of those too.
L:  Oh.  W- -- I got one probably oh, seven years ago or so as a gift --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and since then we've used it as a fundraiser -- we -- if it's -- we don't have a coupon, were not going. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, my G- -- you know, I have -- I actually have two of them --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- and believe it or not, I have not used them yet.  I just haven't bothered to open them up --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but I've heard people who say, "Those things are great", and I'm like, "Okay, well maybe one day I'll get around to looking at it".
L:  Well, open the front and get your little card out and get online and register your card.
R:  Okay.
L:  And then they'll send you an email every once in a while like, with a new restaurant in the area, and that might remind you.
R:  Oh.  Okay. So it really is a good bargain, though.
L:  It is, and I mean, if you guys go out to dinner, just the two of you one time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for something nice, you've more than paid your book back.
R:  Wow.
L:  And we --
R:  Yeah, 'cause the book was pretty cheap like, twenty bucks or something.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When, um, [LIPSMACK] two pizzas and you've got it covered --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know?  And most times it's a pizza that they'll bring you.  So you don't -- unless -- I keep my books in the car.
R:  Mhm?
L:  And so that way, you know, when you're out, if you think of something, then you've got 'em.
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  Right.
L:  Th- that was the key for me, to start using them and now it's just such a habit.
R:  Wow.
L:  So we're --
R:  Okay.
L:  We're in the southern California area.
R:  Okay.
L:  Where --
R:  And we're in Florida.
L:  Oh, okay.  So --
R:  Yeah, we're pretty far apart.
L:  We are at opposite ends --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  -- of the country.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I know um, it -- it sure made our eating out a little more reasonable.
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  Then you feel like it's not -- you can afford it more.
R:  Now, it -- I -- I guess -- are the restaurants more expensive in California?  I -- I -- I think?
L:  It just --
R:  Florida, I don't think that things are that expensive.
L:  It just depends where you go.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know, I mean if you want a really, really nice out to eat, [SIGH] it depends on -- you know how sometimes your salad is separate and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- your entree's separate and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, your side dish is separate [MN] that's just once a year, maybe. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  But um, we found the fine dining in the book a lot of times you can go somewhere very nice for something special, an anniversary or birthday or just a real special date for you guys, that -- that really helps on the expense end.
R:  Okay.
L:  But it's -- I know, sometimes it's just kind of fun.  Especially when the girls were little.  Darryl would like to go out with them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because it was kinda like dad got to show the kids off too.
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, and it's like, "Oh, aren't they cute, and they're mine", and you know --
R:  Yes.  Yes, yeah.
L:  So -- and they get so much attention at three and four.
R:  Oh, I know.  They do.  And -- and they're just happy to be out, and my husband's like that too, "Oh, let's take the girls, they're so much fun" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'm thinking, "Oh, whose the one that's gotta make them --"
L:  And you're like, "Have a daddy daughter date". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that --
L:  I'll be home. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's a lot of work to take them, so it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, we -- I went -- actually I went out to dinner Friday night [LAUGH] and me and my mother went because, you know, I told my husband, I said, "Why don't you stay home with the girls and have fun?" and he did, and me and my mom went out to eat --
L:  Good for you.
R:  -- and we had a nice steak dinner and we had a ball.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, you know --
L:  Those things are nice.  Well you need to --
R:  And it was fun, it was really fun, not having the kids --
L:  Right.
R:  -- 'cause it's a lot of work.
L:  You need to have girls' night out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know it -- you just do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's -- it helps you be happier when you're home --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and [NOISE] enjoy them more.
R:  Yes.
L:  Unless they -- unless, when you get home it's payback time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Payback's really bad. [LAUGH]
R:  I know. [LAUGH]  I know.  We thought they would be asleep when we got in 'cause we got in like around nine thirty from dinner, and they were -- they were still up. "Mommy", I thought, "Oh, wow, you girls stayed up" --
L:  Mhm.  "Thanks, honey".
R:  -- and you know, it was Friday night, I guess nobody had to go to school -- they didn't go -- have to go to um, to their ch- -- early childhood programs the next day, and they just, were happy.  So --
L:  [LIPSMACK] [MN] and daddy didn't put them to bed, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  No, he didn't.  He did not.  I thought, "My God". [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] it's that --
R:  No, he did not put them to bed.
L:  It's that transfer of power --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, it has to ha- -- okay now, they need to -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  He's not -- he -- they're -- I don't know, he's just not like, they're -- the da- -- daddy's not the one that'll put 'em down, and they know that.  They see me leave, they know he's not going to do it.  So --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they have a ball.  They just have fun with daddy.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  'Cause anything they wanna do is just fine.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, and they get to eat out -- that -- and on the topic of eating food, they -- they have -- the kitchen was a mess.  They had him going through everything.  They were, "Daddy, we want macaroni and cheese".
L:  Mhm.
R:  "Daddy, we want mashed potatoes".
L:  Oh.
R:  "Daddy, we want French fries".  You know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and you -- and he's in there doing it, so I got home and I'm going, "What is all this food?"
L:  Wait a minute, wait a minute, [MN] got a problem in here guys -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know, that's the thing.
R:  And it was like, "Well, Jesse, you know, they -- just -- mm -- they need pick one thing to eat".  Oh --
L:  Clean up is, you know, you've got so much clean up.  Especially when there're spills --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and too many choices --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- my sister was always really good at having like, two vegetable choices, whenever, you know, she made dinner for the kids --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so that way, I mean, if you didn't want the carrots, okay you could have the green beans, but you had to pick one.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And so, I re- -- I remember, with the girls, it was, "Do you want to wear the red dress or the green dress".  It wasn't, "Pick what you want".
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And she took that to food too, and that kinda helped.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because like --
R:  Now, how old are yours?
L:  Um, now they're sixteen and thirteen.
R:  Okay, so they were about three years apart.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay.
L:  And --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know, when they were real little, of course, they didn't know that this was supposed to be not very fun to eat.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, they ate all sorts of green things and you know, I mean, and then their friends were like, "Ooh, no" --
R:  "Ooh, yuck"
L:  [inaudible].  Then you know, now their good, but we went through a, "Let's live on pasta". [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh they loved spaghetti.  Now, kids love spaghetti and, I mean, I think they can eat spaghetti, um, you know, until it comes out of their ears.
L:  I know, and macaroni and cheese.
R:  And macaroni and cheese.
L:  Carbohydrates.
R:  They're very happy with those things, so -- [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  Carb- waffles, waffles were always a favorite.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  They always wanted Eggos[?].  They thought that was pretty cool.
R:  Oh.
L:  So --
R:  Well, mine aren't in the Eggo stage.  Just macaroni and cheese, and -- and -- and spaghetti.
L:  Hm.
R:  And anything sweet.
L:  Yeah, lots of sweets.  Hm.
R:  Lots of sweets.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, you know, in the Eas- Easter they had lots of sweets, rabbits and chocolate and all the -- all the candy and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I was glad when that was over. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, I have a friend that -- her rule is, "You eat it all today, 'cause it's gone tomorrow".
R:  Well --
L:  And I said, "Oh my gosh, I can't do that". [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know, but th- -- th- -- it makes them hyper.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know and they'll con- -- I mean, you -- for a week later you're still trying to get rid of that candy and --
L:  I know.
R:  -- you know, it's hard --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because they are -- it does hy- -- it does hype 'em up a bit.
L:  Mhm.
R:  As if a three and a four year old aren't hyper enough.
L:  Really, oh.
R:  You know, so yeah, that's a good philosophy.  I should do that in the future [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I don't know, "Kids", I said, "You guys aren't gonna come down off
