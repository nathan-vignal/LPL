R:  Hi.  My name is Barbara.
L:  Hi.  My name is Louis.
R:  Lois, um, Louis?
L:  Yeah.
R:  L -- L.E.W.I.S. or L.O. --
L:  L.O.U. --
R:  -- U.I.S.?
L:  L.O.U.I.S.
R:  Oh, hi, Louis.  How are you?
L:  I'm okay.
R:  I'm in New York.  Where are you?
L:  I'm in Ogden.
R:  Ogden.  Utah?
L:  Yah.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  I'm in Utah.
R:  Oh, wow, okay.  Um, so we're supposed to talk about our favorite meal and whether we like to eat in a restaurant or at home.
L:  Well, myself, I prefer home.
R:  Okay.  Do you cook?
L:  I do.  I'm -- I'm the main cooker of the house.
R:  Oh, what's your specialty?
L:  Uh, anything that, uh, feeds me [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I've got no specialty whatsoever.
R:  Oh.
L:  I'll talk to you in a bit, Dad [NOISE].
R:  Uh, okay, um, well, what's your favorite meal? 
L:  [NOISE] Uh, my favorite meal is Swedish meatballs [NOISE].
R:  Oh, that sounds good.  Over what?  Noodles?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh [NOISE], oh, okay.
L:  Egg noodles.
R:  Okay, um [SIGH] what about going out to eat in a restaurant?  Do you like that?
L:  Uh, I -- it's okay.  I just don't care for the crowds, you know --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- uh, all the talking, gabbling, whatnot.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  I -- I like a -- a closed intimate thing where the family can be together and enjoy our meal together.
R:  Uh-huh.  How many people do you cook for?
L:  Uh, four, incl- --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- including myself.
R:  Oh, okay, wow.  Do you cook every day?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, wow, that's great.  Do you do the shopping also?
L:  I do.
R:  Oh, wow [LAUGH].
L:  On top of that, I also work, uh, forty s-, uh, hours during the week --
R:  Hm, hm.
L:  -- uh, plus, uh, eight hours on Saturdays.  So, you figure out working forty eight hours, uh, uh, at my job --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- and then I'm mom [LAUGH].
R:  Wow, that's quite a load.  Okay, let me see, um, I eat out a lot because in New York City there are something like thirty thousand restaurants, so --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- between eating out and ordering in, I'm, um, always eating restaurant food.  Um, you know, in my mind, I'd like to -- I say I'd like to have home cooked meals and all that kind of stuff but, um, in actuality, I really, uh, don't want to be bothered with the going for the groceries and, you know, the cooking, and the clean up afterwards, you know, you eat out --
L:  Really?
R:  -- you order in, it's so much easier.  You just throw it i- -- throw the plates away, you know.
L:  Yeah, but it costs so much money to eat out --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- and that's where it's at with us, is, you know, I -- I'm on a fixed income, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, it -- I make a decent salary, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the nine hundred mortgage for the house and whatnot, just kind of bites in.
R:  Yeah, sure, sure.
L:  You know, uh, so on and so forth.  You know, I only make under -- well, under twenty thousand a year is --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- wh- what I make --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, uh, you know, eating out, it -- it -- you end up spending over -- well, with my family, you end up spending over twenty dollars every time.
R:  You're right.
L:  If you eat -- 
R:  -- right --
L:  -- if you eat as cheap as you can, you're eating at Burger King or something nasty --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- like that --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- you know.  I -- I do, uh, on -- on Wednesdays, I usually do, uh, a eat out thing, but we -- we order in --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like we, uh, just order it.  We've got a Oriental restaurant that delivers here, and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a few other places deliver and we just eat in on Wednesdays.
R:  Now, are you in the city or i- is Ogden a city, or is it more suburban?
L:  It's a city outright.  My neighbors are twenty feet from me --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- i- if that.
R:  Okay.  Well, I mean, one of the things about having so many restaurants is that, you know, yeah, I do a lot of cheap Chinese 'cause you're right, it is expensive, um, but there's a -- such a, um, a wealth of, um, you know, places, that they can't afford to make their pr- prices go too high because there's, you know, a hundred other places that will -- will undercut them with prices, you know.
L:  And see out here, the Olympics, uh, jacked up prices for everything.  It made it impossible for low income m- -- and whatnot people to be able to afford to go out and enjoy a nice meal in a nice restaurant.  You know, it's twenty -- twenty to thirty dollars a plate to go a nice place.
R:  Wow, yeah.
L:  You know, and --
R:  Yeah, that is quite --
L:  -- that -- that -- it's not -- I can't, you know -- it's not worth it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and there again, like I said, you know, other than that you end up at Burger King or McDonalds or nasty food.
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know.
R:  The only thing about, um, restaurant food is that --
L:  [SIGH].
R:  -- even though it might be good, it's not exactly wh- -- the way I like it, you know, when you cook --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you can make it the -- exactly -- like if you like --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- it spicy, or hot, or not too spicy or whatever --
L:  And, uh, you know it --
R:  -- then you can make it exactly the way you want it.
L:  In the beginning I -- I thought I wanted to be a cook and I moved down to Las Vegas where my mom lives, and, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- started cooking institutionally.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I tasted what I was cooking and found that I couldn't make it taste good.
R:  Oh, that was in the beginning?
L:  I wasn't allowed to.
R:  O- --
L:  It's against the law.
R:  Oh, really.  What do you mean?
L:  People are a- -- people are allergic to things like salt, pepper --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- uh, other spices --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, that you naturally add in your food at home --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, I decided to --
R:  So, you had to make it kind of bland?
L:  -- back out of that real quick.
R:  Yeah.  Did it make it kind of bland?
L:  Yeah.  Everything has to be bland.  Mormon cooking.
R:  Oh.
L:  No s- -- no flavor, you know.
R:  Wow, wow.  Hm, I didn't realize that.  Hm.  Uh, that's something interesting to know, but --
L:  Well, you see, out here we don't have all those restaurants that you've got.  I'm sure you've got every -- every type of cuisine you could possibly imagine --
R:  It's right [LAUGH].
L:  -- in New York, you know --
R:  Yeah, we do.
L:  Y- you -- you can eat t- -- pie, you can eat anything you want --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and out here, y- you're really limited, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's one sushi bar out here that I know that's any good --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, and you got to travel almost thirty miles to get to it --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- you know, and I'm in a city.
R:  Oh, yeah.  So, I can imagine what the people in the suburbs -- they must really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- never, uh --
L:  Exactly, and north of me is where you start getting into the suburbs.  Going south it's directly to Salt Lake City.  Salt Lake City has two hundred and somewhat thousand people, not two hundred million --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's two hundred thousand, you know --
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  -- and you know, it -- uh, the state population out here is two hundred -- er -- er two million, I think it is --
R:  Oh, wow, okay.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Right.
L:  Not quite three million.
R:  Now, a- are Mormons -- is Morm- -- do Mormons, um -- is that part of being a Mormon, cooking bland food?  I mean, that you're --
L:  Y- --
R:  -- not supposed to use m- many spices or something?
L:  I'm -- I'm really not sure, not being --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- LDS myself.
R:  Okay.
L:  I've just never enjoyed LDS cooking --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- it's always been very bland and --
R:  Oh, okay --
L:  -- but in t- --
R:  -- but you don't know if it's --
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- I think it's just th- their lifestyle.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They're not al- -- they're not allowed to have, uh, caffeine and other things like that --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- it's probably they're not allowed to have flavor in their life either.
R:  Oh, okay, all right.
L:  You know, I really don't know myself --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I -- I -- I just stay away.
R:  Yeah, yeah [SIGH] now --
L:  I -- I consider myself a very good cook.  I've -- I've, uh, roughly fourteen cookbooks, uh, anything from Fanny Farmers --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- to Better Home an- -- Better Home and Health, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I've -- I've got cookbooks galore, and then I sit down with, uh, the computer and I've got [SIGH], uh, Messo[?] West and, uh, a bunch of online, uh, BBSs[?] for cooking and whatnot where you can get recipes, so on and so forth, so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's in -- I -- I can do all my shopping through Sounds[?] Club or Walmart, so --
R:  Oh, right, okay --
L:  -- I -- I'm --
R:  -- you buy in that --
L:  -- buying in bulk food.  I'm able to -- this week I'll buy a case of macaroni and cheese and a case of tuna and whatnot, and next week I'll buy a case of what- whatever else I need, and I buy my hamburger in ten pound packs, so it lasts me a long time, and --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- hot dogs in five pound packs and --
R:  Now, do you have a freezer to fr- -- to put all this frozen?
L:  Oh, yes --
R:  Oh, okay.  You'd have to.
L:  -- yeah, of course I do.
R:  Yeah, you'd have to because otherwise, uh, it wouldn't work out.
L:  Right.
R:  Wow.
L:  And, unfortunately, I use an electric stove.  I hate electric.  I wish it was gas, but --
R:  Oh, why?  You think that's better?
L:  I like gas.  It's a little b- better on the efficiency for me.  It's, uh, faster heat, more adjustable heat.  I can instantly change the heat --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- instead of electric stove, where you have to wait ten minutes for it to [SIGH] settle down in temperature to simmer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When you turn a gas stove to simmer, it's now simmer.
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  It's not -- it's -- it's -- there's no waiting for this pan to cool down --
R:  Right.
L:  -- there's no more heat.
R:  Right, right.  Oh, I didn't -- I haven't even thought about all this.  I see you've given it a lot of thought.  Wow.
L:  Well, I've -- I'm thirty five years old --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I'm -- I am married, uh, like I say, I take care of everything, my wife is, uh, a luxury liner.  She gets to lay around.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Uh, I -- I -- I enjoy cooking --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's been my life ever since I was little boy.
R:  Oh.  Now, do you do fish?  Because fish --
L:  Not really.
R:  -- is my fa- fish is my favorite food.
L:  I really don't do a lot of fish, uh --
R:  Because you -- you're landlocked there, right?  You -- you don't have --
L:  Yeah, I -- I get a lot of fish in here because we've got all these freshwater streams, so we get Cutthroat trout and Mackinaw and all this other stuff out here --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but it's really expensive to buy shrimp or anything like that --
R:  Oh, uh.
L:  -- because yes, we are landlocked.  We're two thousand miles from, uh, the ocean.
R:  Mhm, mhm.  Oh, okay.  Uh, 'cause, uh, fish is my favorite food and, um --
L:  Well --
R:  -- maybe macaroni and cheese.  I like that.
L:  Out there wh- where you're at, I used to do trucking and I went to a place out there called Pier Thirteen.
R:  Oh, yes, uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, and you might be familiar with it actually.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  And there's a seafood restaurant over there, but I believe the name of it is Pier Thirteen --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it is the most amazing shrimp I've ever had in my life at the most affordable rate I've ever paid for, for seafood in my entire life.  I ate and ate and ate and ate --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- for probably two hours.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, yeah, I -- that's one place I can point out on the east coast there where I have been for seafood.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And that's Pier Thirteen.  That's really good grub.
R:  Oh, I -- I d- -- I'm not -- I haven't been there myself.  I'll have to look it up.  So, you don't -- you're not a trucker any more?
L:  No, no.  And see I started trucking in eighty six, I think it was, and I had a piano go down on me back east there, on a --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- staircase ...
