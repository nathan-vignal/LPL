R:  Hello. 
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Good.  How are you? [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] All right.
R:  My name's Susan.
L:  Hi, Susan, this is Tracey.
R:  Hi Tracey.  [SIGH] You know I just called them and they didn't tell us when the ten minutes were up. [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, I just wondered if that phone call actually worked, you know, [SIGH] So, I thought I'd call again. [LAUGH]  I don't [SIGH] --
L:  Might as well if you're not that sure.
R:  Right. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  'Cause I had called them and, um, [MN] I had the wrong PIN number, I had just called and did the[?] food with somebody else.
R:  Oh.
L:  And they had cancelled it because it was the wrong PIN number and the person didn't get credit [NOISE] for it and neither did I.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How did you find out though?
L:  [SIGH] Um, case I've been calling them for like three days.  You know, when the first call [SIGH] -- when I first called them, initially set up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they never gave me any PIN number.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] So I just made up my own.  I wasn't sure if you were supposed to --
R:  Oh. [NOISE]
L:  -- do that, or what.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]  So, I see.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] So what's your, ah, preference?  Do you like to eat at home or do you like to go out to a restaurant?
L:  At home, always.
R:  You like to eat at home the best?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's my favorite.
R:  I like to eat at home but I just don't like all of the work that goes along with it.
L:  I know, it's -- it's a lot of work cooking and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH] Plus, you know, you have to go to the grocery store, then you have to lug it all up the stairs where I live [LAUGH] and then [SIGH] you have to prepare it.  I like to cook though.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] And then you also have to, um, [MN] do the dishes.
L:  Yeah.  Now see --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when -- when -- when I was working at a restaurant we did food -- like I did food prep.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was somebody that did the dishes.  I did the food prep a- a- and the chef did the cooking. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know that made sense.  L- like one person, it's like you gotta do everything and that kinda takes the fun out of the cooking --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- experience.
R:  But I do like cooking. [SIGH]  And I like to eat at [NOISE] home and cook, um, [NOISE] you know, maybe several times a week. [SIGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, if you have small children and a [NOISE] husband and then you have to cook [SIGH] three times a day.  That's overkill, [NOISE] you know.
L:  Yeah, that is a lot of cooking.  I know what you mean, 'cause I did it for my three kids and [SIGH] I'm telling you I'm glad they got to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- teenagers. [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm like, "You want something to eat, you know where the k- -- the kitchen is".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.
L:  Cook, cook, cook. [LAUGH]
R:  I know. [MN] I know.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  My kids were funny they used to say, "Oh, you haven't cooked for three days" you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It would be like we have leftovers or pizza, or [LAUGH] you know. [SIGH]
L:  Yep, that's good enough.
R:  [SIGH] And I would go, um, I didn't have a car for a while, so I would walk over to the farmers' market and I would buy fresh -- fresh vegetables and fresh fruit and I would carry them home on the bus.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they'd say, "When are you gonna go to the store and get real food?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They wanted frozen food.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know.
L:  I was so poor, 'cause a lot of kids like to eat out, they like the fast food, McDonalds and all that stuff.
R:  Right. [SIGH]
L:  My kids used to like that stuff growing up, "Oh, I want to go to McDonalds".
R:  Mm.
L:  "I want to go [MN]...". [SIGH]
R:  I know.
L:  I'm like, "Oh wait a minute, hold up now.  That's getting expensive".  Y- ah, McDonalds every day. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  That's the trouble with going out.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, it's a lot cheaper to cook at home.
L:  And eat.
R:  So what do you -- what's your favorite meal?
L:  [SIGH] Um, let me see.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I guess chicken.  I like chicken but now, um, ah, you know what?  I think fish is more.  I am more of a seafood person now more than ever.
R:  Wow.  Good for you.
L:  Yep.
R:  I like fish [NOISE] but, [SIGH] you know, I only know how to fry it.  I don't [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then it's not so healthy for you, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  I used to make a mess of it when I first stated making it.  It's like, "Oh my God, this ain't coming out right".  It would be half done inside.  And I mean I --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- wanted to give up. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]  I put like half oil and half butter in the pan.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then the oil doesn't burn, you know, and the butter gives it that good flavor.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Olive oil doesn't burn as easily as butter burns, you know, [LAUGH] so ... [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  That makes sense.  I do that sometimes too.  I mix the, um, oil and the butter.  Yeah.
R:  Oil and the butter, yeah.  And then just cook it, you know, a few minutes and then turn it over and cook it, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then when you stick the fork it sort of flakes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It takes time, but when you're cooking that it's like, you know, you can't like turn it up real hot or rush through it.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] Like with chicken you can try and cook it a little higher.  But --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I learned there was the difference between cooking fish and chicken. [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Because I was burning it up. [LAUGH]
R:  You were trying to hurry. [LAUGH]  You know, here you are.
L:  [LAUGH] I was like, "Why does this keeps coming out half done?  What's wrong with this fish?" [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  And it's not the fish, [LAUGH] right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I hear you. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, then it used to break up and just break.  Oh, oh, now that was the worst thing.
R:  Yeah, then it's hard to get it out of the pan.
L:  Oh, I hated it.
R:  Sticks to the pan.  [SIGH] So do you bake the fish ever? [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] I tried baking fish one time.  But I don't like it baked as much as I like it fried.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  And I make those barma[?] cakes.
R:  It tastes more fishy.  Don't you think it tastes more fishy when it's baked?
L:  Yeah.  It does.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  It's got that after taste.  Ooh.
R:  Right.
L:  Ooh. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  I don't like it that way either.
L:  So, which one is your favorite?  What kind of [NOISE] fish do you really like to cook?
R:  I think my favorite is monk fish, 'cause it tastes like lobster.
L:  Oh.
R:  But that's a real thick fish. [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You have to -- that's kinda hard to cook, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, I mean, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you can cook it on the grill.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or broil it and put butter in and put it under the broiler like you would a steak. [SIGH] Or put it on the grill.  But I -- I try not to get them too thick, you know, 'cause --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't want it to be raw in the middle. [MN]  And then if I have any doubts I put it in the microwave. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  After the +convenience of modern cooking [LAUGH].
R:  [SIGH] Right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Microwave, everything.
R:  [SIGH] Exactly, make sure it's cooked all the way through, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I also like white -- [SIGH] well I don't like fish that has bones.  Like I like the light fish.  I love tuna.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, that's my favorite of favorites, tuna fish.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I love tuna, [SIGH] the kind that you buy and then you cook it yourself.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, that's wonderful. [SIGH]
L:  That's nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  And then I guess I look to see what's on sale otherwise. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] If it's like a lighter c- colored fish.  Some people love salmon.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Salmon is one of my favorites too.
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  That one and tuna.
R:  -- like it sometimes.  I-
L:  Oh, you don't like it a lot.
R:  It depends on how it's cooked I guess.
L:  Oh, okay. [NOISE]
R:  I like it.  Do you have one of those George Foreman grills?
L:  Yep.
R:  Yep.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I think almost half of --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- America does, at least. [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  And --
L:  Everybody seem like they g- -- everybody's getting a microwave and one of those, or ...
R:  George Foreman grill, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I cook salmon in that George Foreman grill, and boy it was delicious.  I --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- thought it was delicious but my son didn't like it.  But [LAUGH] --
L:  My kids --
R:  -- I liked it.
L:  -- don't even like to eat that.  They -- they like, um, um, hamburgers.  They put the hamburgers in the George Foreman grill.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they come out perfect.
R:  Oh, yeah. [SIGH] And --
L:  Hello.
R:  -- it's so fast.  Can you hear me?  Hello. [NOISE]  Hi.
L:  She got cut off.  Hello.
R:  Can y- -- I'm here, are you?  Hello? [SIGH] [NOISE].  Hi.
L:  This system is terrible, I -- I got cut off.
R:  I know, this is what happened to me in last time.  And that's why I called back, because it kept fading out.  Can you hear me now?  Hello.
L:  Why are you cheating people?
R:  I know it keeps fading.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  Hi.
L:  They cheating people now, Zac.  Zac!
R:  I can hear you.
L:  I got cut off and they ain't -- they didn't say whether it was ten minutes they just cut it off. [NOISE]
R:  I know.  Can you hear me?
L:  That wasn't ten minutes was it?
R:  Can you hear me?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  Can you hear me?  I can hear you.
L:  I don't think that [NOISE] was no ten minutes.
R:  I know.
L:  She said the same thing happened to her earlier, she called back. [NOISE]
R:  Yep. [SIGH] And you went -- but there's nobody to talk to when you call back, you just get --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that recording.  So it's very frustrating.  You can't hear me at all, huh?  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You probably hung up.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, I don't know what to do.  I wish they would come on the line so that I could tell them we're experiencing [NOISE] technical difficulties. [SIGH] So maybe I'll send them an email. [SIGH]  Um, thank you, bye.
L:  That was crazy.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [PAUSE] Oh, I'll try again tomorrow. [several inaudible words] [PAUSE] [NOISE] That wasn't no ten minutes.  Hello. [NOISE]  That wasn't hardly no te- [NOISE]
