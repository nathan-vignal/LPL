R:  [MN]
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  Fine thanks.  What's your name?
R:  Uh, Alexis.
L:  Hi Alexis, my name's Mariko.
R:  Mariko?
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's nice to meet you. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Nice to meet you, too. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, so I guess we have to talk about friends now. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, where -- where are you from?
L:  California.
R:  Oh, me too.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  What city do you live in?
R:  In Los Angeles.
L:  Oh, really?  I live in, um, like, Pasadena area so, like, we're right there.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  It's pretty neat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Actually, you're the first person I've talked to that's in California.  Usually the people I talk to are, like, in -- are in Texas, um, let me think, Washington, places like that [LAUGH] so ...
R:  Yeah, I only -- this is my second call and the person I spoke to before was from Philadelphia which is -- which is actually where I'm from originally so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- it was kind of cool.
L:  That is cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, so let's talk about friends [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  Do -- do you have a lot of friends? [LAUGH]
R:  Um, yeah, I would say --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, I -- I do have a lot of -- a lot of, like, acquaintances.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  People I'm friendly with, different groups.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um -- but I mean there's definitely like a core group of I would say, like, ten friends that are, like, very close.
L:  Okay, all right.
R:  How about you?
L:  Um, I'm kinda different.  I have a lot of acquaintances, I -- even people that I've known for a long time I really don't consider them friends --
R:  Right.
L:  -- unless I share, like, a really close bond with them somehow.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I only have a handful of people that I actually consider friends.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I think that it's changed as I've gotten older also because I realize that, um, fr- -- being in a friendship isn't -- is, you know, also big type of relationship --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and when you just call everybody your friends I think it's like spreading it a little bit too thin.  So that's why --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I like calling, um, just a -- a couple of people friends instead of just, you know -- you know, instead of just telling everybody, "Oh this is my friend, blah blah blah blah blah".
R:  Right.
L:  It's easy to say that this person's my friend but, like, really how many people truly are.
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  You -- you throw it around a lot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] But I mean I -- I actually had a friend who was visiting from out of town and we've been friends since college, we're both, like, twenty six --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we lived together for a while and we were just saying how, like, as you start to get a little older it's funny how hard it is to find, like, really good friends, people that, like, you know, like, you can count on, um --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  So -- and it's also -- it's -- it's interesting too, like the older we get the more we're likely to kind of, like, cut out the -- the excess people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that really, like, are not your true friends.
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  So --
L:  What I did mention, um -- I was having this conversation, well, a similar conversation, with one of -- I think it was either my cousin or my mom but, um, I was saying well it's easier to -- to call people friends when you met so many people when you were at school because you were forced to interact with them on a daily basis.
R:  Right.
L:  So I think that's also where it come -- comes from because, you know, we have a lot of people around us when we're going to school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we're with them so much we might as well call them our friends even when we know that they're not.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think that's also -- it leads to why there's so many, um, rumors in high school because we consider everybody our friends but we both know that we talk about people behind their backs --
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  -- just because [LAUGH] you know [LAUGH] they're there  --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we know a bunch about them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- but when you're older and you -- you're starting to have families and when you're, you know, having a career and stuff like that, you can't socially interact with other people and I think that's why we've stopped calling people, um, friends. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  We just know, "Oh, this is my work acquaintance, this is somebody that I ...", you know, there's always some -- it's somebody that I do this with.  It's not so much, "Oh, this is my friend blah blah blah blah blah".
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  It seems the older people get the -- the smaller their circle of friends is.
L:  Mhm, it's true.
R:  But it -- it makes sense because you're just focused on different things.  When you're in college you have so much free time on your hands.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like [LAUGH] everybody's your friend, you're constantly going out and it -- it's -- it's definitely different when -- you know, the older you get.
L:  I believe -- and I think that the more outgoing you are the more, um, you -- you -- you tend to call people your friends because, you know, it's always nice when you go to, like, certain clubs or bars or restaurants and you're like, "Oh, I have a friend that works here" or "I know this person who comes here regularly".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's nice to just know people because, you know, who wants to go to a place where they don't know anyone.
R:  Right.
L:  And a lot of people embrace friends that way also.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I can't believe I did that.  I just used the little tiny finger quotations [LAUGH] --
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  -- when I said that.  I'm like, "I'm driving.  Who's going to see this?" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause it's -- [LAUGH]
R:  You're driving right now?
L:  I'm driving. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's great.
L:  I -- I'm coming from -- just coming from one of my oldest friend's houses.  It's really strange because I've known her since, gosh, I was like -- well, there's two girls over there.  One I know -- I've known since I was five years old --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and the other one since -- I've known since I was, like, I would say eleven and we have changed so much over the years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And if I would meet them now I swear to god I would hate them.  I would be like, "No way, I'm not hanging out with them" [LAUGH] --
R:  I know.
L:  But, you know when you have a -- when you have history with somebody it's really hard to -- to break away from that.
R:  Right.
L:  So -- [NOISE]
R:  I have, uh, a lot of friends from high school.  I have a couple of, like, really close friends and then I have more just acquaintances.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And everyone, like, a -- a lot of them are kind of getting married now and it's -- it's so strange because I don't really, like, talk to them on a regular basis.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And we get -- I'm invited to their weddings and it's -- it's strange but -- and it's so true, like, I wouldn't, like, if I met them now I really wouldn't have much in common with them, like I wouldn't consider really going ahead and forging a friendship with them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But because we have so much common history and so many memories together, like, that just, sort of, kind of, still cements it.
L:  It does.  It's like, um, a feeling of nostalgia I guess because I know, I went to a wedding this past, um [LIPSMACK] -- this summer, I guess, just passed, and it was, you know, it was a big trip because I had to go to Hawaii because my friend -- see, I call her my friend [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because she was getting married.  Let me tell you, I have not talked to this girl in the past three years, maybe a handful of --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like, four times --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but when, you know, I did talk to every day and when I was with her every single day she was such a good person and I -- you know, she was such a good friend to me then, I just wanted to continue that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- even though I know it wasn't going to be the same.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  I know.
L:  It's -- you know.  Friends are a good thing, you know, the ones that you have that you can talk to and stuff.  It's great.
R:  It is.
L:  It really is.
R:  It is.
L:  So, I don't know.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, it's, um -- [LIPSMACK] it's kind of sad, too, because it -- it really, you -- really -- especially when you don't live in the area, like all my friends back east I've -- the majority of them are back east.  You really have to make an effort --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to keep the friendships going --
L:  It -- it --
R:  -- 'cause if -- if you don't, like, make the call then, you know, write them cards on their birthdays and, like, try and get together at least like a couple of times a year, it's -- it's -- it's pr- -- it's just not going to last.
L:  It is -- and do you find it -- um, how old were you when you moved from, um -- I'm sorry, you said Pennsylvania?
R:  Well, I -- I lived in Pennsylvania, grew up there.  I went to college in New York, I lived in New York then for a couple of years and then I moved out, like, in October to L.A.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, so I'm a new -- I'm -- I'm very, you know, new out here but --
L:  And is it -- do you find it's different, like the types of friendships that you have had, um, in New York and in Pennsylvania considering the ones that you have over here?
R:  Um, not so much -- like I have, uh, the -- the -- a big basis of my friends out here are people I work with --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because, um, it's lot of, uh -- work with a lot of, like, fun people and we all socialize together a lot, much more so than any of my other jobs really.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, so it's -- it's definitely different, I mean, like I said, a lot of my friends are, you know, from -- not even so much from college but from high school, are my close friends.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, it's di- -- it's definitely different out here but, um ... but it's not.  I mean, you -- you ki- -- tend to find people that are just on the same wavelength, I think.
L:  Okay, they --
R:  They're definitely friendships of convenience but like, true, like people that you really, like, get along with and enjoy spending time with.  I -- I don't think it's different.
L:  You know, I really like how you put it, friendship of convenience, because that's what -- I hate to say it and I might -- it might make me seem like a shallow person --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I know that I have a couple of those.
R:  Oh, ya.
L:  And, um -- and it's -- it's just like it's a give and take thing.  They su- -- they give me what I need, when I need someone to go shopping with or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or if I need to do something and they come with me it's like that or if they want me to come with them some place and it's not necessarily like, "Come to my house and ha- -- 'cause I have nothing to do and we'll just hang out doing nothing", it's not like that. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  There's always an -- there's something that has to be done and that's why we hang out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I like how you put that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's a --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's a good explanation of one type of friendship because there really are different types of friendship.
R:  Right.  
L:  So --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, you know and I -- I've always been, um, I've always really tried to, like, maintain friendships because I see so many people that, like -- that don't and they just, like, take for granted their friends and then they lose them and I just -- I don't want that to ever happen to me.
L:  That's true.
R:  You know, but --
L:  It --
R:  -- you don't -- you're always going to have friends that are just -- I mean, it's a -- it's a reciprocal relationship, like everyone benefits but it's not like the -- the bond of certain other relationships.
L:  I -- I find that I have not had a serious, like a -- a bonding friendship like that for quite some time, you know.
R:  It's hard.
L:  The peop- -- yeah, the people that you meet when you're older, it's -- it's different because you don't -- you -- you don't, um -- how can I say, you don't grow with them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because pretty much you've done all of your -- all of your growing already with relationships and with your careers and with yourself --
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, you -- everybody's pretty much on different levels --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um -- so that -- that -- I guess that common bond is kind of missing.  You have other things that you can relate to but just that whole growing experience.  That's a big thing.
R:  It is.
L:  That -- that's really what people get to -- like, really that's how people connect and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, the friends that you -- that thing you cry over, you know, your first boyfriend or --
