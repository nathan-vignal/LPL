R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  My name's Maxine, I'm calling from New York.
L:  Hi Maxine.  I'm Beverley, I'm in Indiana.
R:  Oh, okay. [SIGH] Um --
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  -- I guess we're talking about food, a topic everybody's interested in, right?
L:  [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- definitely. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, let's see.  Do I prefer eating in home or a restaurant?  Mm, well --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I mean, either, I mean, it's nice --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to eat in a restaurant and let somebody else do the cooking and serving --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- right?
L:  That's right.  I prefer that too. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Who wants to do the cooking and the cleaning?
R:  Mhm.  Do that enough, right?  Hm.  Oh, let's see what else, uh -- you know, uh, let's see.  I guess we're supposed to stick to that topic, right? [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, well, I guess so.  Sounds good to me.
R:  Oh, let's see, uh -- let's see.  B- mm, you know, I prefer --
L:  Well, I -- I prefer eating out, especially since the kids have grown now.
R:  Ooh, okay, uh --
L:  It's a lot easier just feeding two.
R:  Ooh, I see.  I say, no, I'm on income, but no children --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- well, so, I mean, you know, I mean, I kind of do what I want, when I want, and, uh --
L:  Oh, that must be nice. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, right, I mean, uh -- [SIGH] oh, my mother's not happy that she doesn't have grandchildren, but, uh, anyway --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so, uh, I guess that's the way it goes, um --
L:  Oh, it works good.  You get to stick to a schedule, eat when you want, or you don't have to stick to a schedule, you eat --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- when you want.
R:  Let's see, um --
L:  That works out good.
R:  Ooh, uh, I don't particularly like to eat too much at the fast food restaurants --
L:  No, I -- no.
R:  -- because that's really high fat stuff.
L:  Oh, yeah, I'd much prefer to go somewhere, where I could sit --
R:  Right.
L:  -- down, and be waited on.
R:  Right, have salmon fillet and a salad --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or, um --
L:  Chicken or -- or at least have a selection.
R:  Right, right, right, right --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- right.
L:  -- so, what's your favorite meal?
R:  Oh, well, uh, uh, I like -- let's see, mm -- let's see -- a salmon fillet, baked potato --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- salad, dressing on the side -- sounds good to me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And what -- what do you like?
L:  I'm the unhealthy kind.  I like the fried -- the beef, the p- potato --
R:  Well, I mean, there's nothing wrong --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- beef is okay.  I have, er -- er -- er, meat once every three or four days.
L:  Do you?
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, you -- you know, well, you can't, uh -- life is short, death is very long --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you got to enjoy yourself a little, right?
L:  [LAUGH] That's true.  I -- I've never heard it put that way.  That's good. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I mean, uh, it's just the truth, right?
L:  That's true, that's true. [SIGH] Now, I mean, I like seafood, but I prefer fried fish, where my husband likes broiled fish better.
R:  Oh, no, I don't, uh -- the fried stuff doesn't agree with me.  Shellfish, oh, forget about it.  I guess it's an allergy thing, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I -- I n- notice it disagrees with me less, the older I get.
R:  Ooh.
L:  That I don't like, so ... [LAUGH] some things I used to be able to eat without a problem --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- now, it'll just keep me awake all night.
R:  Ooh, well, I mean, I think w- -- er, for myself getting older, I'm getting digestive problems, which I never had when I was young.  I used to -- [SIGH] you know, if it didn't move, I shoved it into my face.
L:  Mhm, exactly.
R:  I could eat anything and everything, pizzas, ice cream --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- y- you name it, it never bothered me, whereas macaroni cheese, now, ooh --
L:  [LAUGH] Same with me.
R:  -- forget about it -- forget about it.  You know, even, uh, simple things like n- nuts are supposed to be very healthy, ooh, forget about it.
L:  Really?  Now, I don't have a problem with nuts, but, it seems like [SIGH] the older I get, more acidic foods like tomatoes [SIGH] and strawberries.  Oh, they're great going down, but they remind me they've been there.
R:  Ooh.  No, I don't have a problem with tomatoes and strawberries.
L:  Really?  And I love them.
R:  Ooh, okay, well, I guess, er, you know, uh, m- -- everybod- -- I can never eat spicy food, never, even when I was younger, I'd never eat --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- spicy food.
L:  Oh, I'm a -- I'm, uh, yes, now, I can do --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the spicy food most --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- of the time, and see, that don't bother me.
R:  Ooh.
L:  We have a Chinese place here, and me and my husband visit it a lot, [SIGH] and they've got a great Mongolian beef, that you can get as hot as you want. [SIGH] I could get it as hot as it comes, and it doesn't bother me, but boy --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- eat a raw tomato [LAUGH] --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- off the vine, and I'm -- I'm just in misery.
R:  Ooh, hm.  Interesting, interesting.  I notice, er -- er -- your co- -- accent, if you might call it, is a little different than mine.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  It -- it -- y- you know, I mean, I could understand you well, but I guess, you know, [SIGH] er, everybody, er, throughout the United States, has different kind of, uh -- I guess you could say, regional, er, accents, you might call it.
L:  I think that's what makes us interesting.
R:  Yeah, oh, right, right --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- let's see what else, uh -- let's see, trying to stick to this topic of food.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Er, let's see, uh, Doctor -- do you ever watch Doctor Su?  He has some good programmes about food.
L:  No.
R:  I don't know if you're home during the day.  Probably not, right?
L:  Well -- well --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- usually, I'm -- I have two different jobs, so --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- in the morning until the afternoon, and then gone in the evening until at night, so -- [SIGH] but I do like watching the food channel.
R:  Ooh.
L:  A lot of those cooks on there --
R:  That's on cable, right?
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Ooh.
L:  Well, a lot of those cooks on there, they make some delicious looking meals, but others, I wouldn't pay to eat the stuff [LAUGH] they put on that plate.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  M- my mother likes to watch Sunday Afternoon on PBS --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- at least -- the -- the two channels here in New York, they have like from one o'clock to six o'clock, cooking shows.
L:  Really?
R:  Right.
L:  They don't have that here on TBS.
R:  Ooh.  No, P., P., you know --
L:  Oh, PBS --
R:  -- publa- -- public --
L:  -- oh, well --
R:  -- right.
L:  -- now, they definitely don't have that here [LAUGH], not on Sunday.  We have a lot of, um, [SIGH] -- PBS carries a lot of painting and arts and crafts --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- th- -- shows.  How to do painting and all that kind of stuff.
R:  Ooh, well, wh- --
L:  But I enjoy the eating shows, the food --
R:  Oh, yeah, an- -- an- -- and sh- she watches Martin Yan, and then, er -- er -- all these different p- -- p- pr- programmes from one o'clock --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to six o'clock.
L:  Well, they come up with recipes I would've never even -- 
R:  Yeah, right, or --
L:  -- thought to mix these ingredients together, you know --
R:  Right --
L:  -- and it's --
R:  -- right.
L:  -- like --
R:  -- right --
L:  -- "Oh, I'll have to try that" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for the o- -- few times I do cook. [LAUGH]
R:  Ooh.  Yeah, let's see, getting back to -- yeah, I mean, uh, getting back to eating in restaurants, yeah, it's nice to have somebody else do the cooking and the serving, and the cleaning up, right?  I mean, uh --
L:  Shoot, yeah.
R:  -- that's a good thing.  That's a --
L:  Well, it's --
R:  -- good thing, you know --
L:  Well, like you just being by yourself, or me and my husband, that's a lot of mess to make, and have to clean up just for one person, [SIGH] and in this day and age, with the convenience of just being able to go down and sit and relax [SIGH] and have somebody else do it for you.
R:  Yeah, um, mm, can't be [several inaudible words], right?
L:  Heck no --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and it's worth the price you pay.  I could live with it,
R:  I think so, yeah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I think so.
L:  You keep that glass filled with coke and I'm a happy woman. [LAUGH]
R:  Ooh, oh, okay --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- okay.  I -- I don't drink too much soda.  I like, uh, let's say, natural spring water --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or a snappo[?] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or Arizona ice tea, but you know, uh, I say, "Live and let live each to his own" that's what --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- I say, right?  You know.
L:  That's right.  We don't, uh -- I'll probably have to pay for my eating habits when I get older. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I am old.
L:  Well -- well, I'm not -- well, I'm -- I feel old.  I'm in my forties. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm fifty -- I'm fifty five.
L:  Are you?  I would have never guessed.
R:  Well, I am. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Anyway, um, let's see, uh -- hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm -- maybe that's why I got this far, I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Who knows.  I -- I -- I don't know.
L:  It surely couldn't have hurt none.
R:  Right, right, although, you never know.  Anything could happen at any time, [SIGH] so, I mean, you know --
L:  Well, I had a --
R:  -- I know people who are health fanatics --
L:  Exactly.  I had a step mother who ate --
R:  -- and do everything and --
L:  -- rice cakes, took vitamins, [SIGH] did all this stuff, and she dropped dead at forty one.
R:  Ah, mm.
L:  I've had other relatives who drank beer and smoked cigarettes and died in their nineties.
R:  Right, so, I guess, uh --
L:  I figure I'm here once, enjoy [LAUGH] myself, a bit like what -- 
R:  Well, I think --
L:  -- you said --
R:  -- y- you can't, uh --
L:  -- death lasts long. [LAUGH]
R:  -- I m- -- I mean, my mother's eighty three and she's really health and fitness, er -- health fanatic --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but, uh, I -- she's always been this way, you know, I mean ...
L:  And that probably instilled good habits in you.
R:  Well, you know, but s- -- anyway, er -- er, you got -- I think you have to have -- look, it's not a qualm to have a cookie once in a while or a piece of --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- cake, you know, but the --
L:  As long as you don't do it in excess.
R:  Right, right, right, so, you know -- and let's see what else [inaudible] --
L:  That would apply to anything though --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- with the subject food.  Anything in excess.
R:  Right, right.  I know in New York, they're having this big law suit against the fast food industry --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- I don't know if you heard about it?
L:  No.
R:  Ooh.  Some obese --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- teenagers --
L:  Blaming them --
R:  -- filed the law suit against --
L:  Are you  --
R:  -- McDonalds --
L:  -- kidding?
R:  -- and Burger King --
L:  Are you --
R:  -- claiming --
L:  --kidding me?
R:  Yeah, yeah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- er, I mean, anything crazy well that's New York, and it'll be any crazy law suit you can think of.  It will be --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- in New York 'cause they --
L:  So, did Ronald McDonald drag them in screaming and kicking --
R:  Yeah, that -- I mean --
L:  -- to eat those Big Macs? [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] I mean, actually, it wasn't the teenagers.  This lawyer --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- got it in his head.  He -- he put in adds in newspapers --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- looking for obese people, teenagers, and he filed the law suit on their behalf.
L:  Well, look at how much money the lawyers did with the cigarettes.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, that's what he tried to -- he's trying to do, to make it the same, but it's not.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's not.
L:  No.
R:  It's completely not.
L:  No.  Not at all.
R:  It -- it -- it, uh, er, in the nineteen twenties and nineteen thirties, the cigarette companies knew that cigarettes caused cancer --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and heart disease.  They kept it a secret deliberately.
L:  Hm.
R:  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- anyone who goes to the, er, McDonalds or Burger King, whatever, every day it gets fatter and fatter and fatter.  Do they think they're getting fatter from the air?
L:  No kidding.  They know, er, the stuff's not good for them --
R:  So, there, I mean --
L:  -- to walk in there.
R:  -- I can't believe that they're going through with, er -- with the law suit.
L:  I can't believe any law --
R:  Well, I mean --
L:  -- any jury would award him anything.
R:  The -- the -- I hope that, first, when the lawyer filed the law suit, the Judge dismissed it, but, the Judge gave the lawyer an idea of what he could do to refile.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, the lawyer refiled, and it's going to go to, er -- er, to trial.  I hope they d- -- they -- the jury doesn't give them a penny 'cause I think it's outrageous.
L:  I do to. I fully agree.  It's just a waste of the taxpayers money and the jury's time and the --
R:  Right --
L:  -- trial's time --
R:  -- and I -- I -- I'd said that --
L:  -- what a joke.
R:  Right, I mean, this is the kind -- in other words, it was the lawyer who really started it, 'cause he put adds in newspaper looking for these people
L:  Mhm.
R:  See this is the kind of lawyer that gives lawyers a bad name.
L:  No kidding, and it [LAUGH] takes a lot -- it don't take much to give them a bad ...
