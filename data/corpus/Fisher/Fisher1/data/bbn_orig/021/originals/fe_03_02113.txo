L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Marilyn from Florida.
R:  I'm Bob from Cincinnati.
L:  Cincinnati!
R:  From Ohio. [COUGH]
L:  Well, I was formerly from Michigan so I'm well acquainted with Cincinnati.
R:  Oh, are you?
L:  [MN]
R:  Where in Michi- -- where in Florida are you?
L:  Mm.  Well -- well, I'm on -- uh, I'm in Bonita Springs between Naples and Port Meyers.
R:  Oh, that's pretty nice down there.
L:  It's beautiful down here.  Yes, it is.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, our topic is friends?
R:  Please?
L:  Our topic is friends?
R:  I can't hear ya.
L:  Is our topic friends?
R:  The topic is friends, right.
L:  An -- and I -- I didn't hear the last statement they made, something about are you the type of person that has best friends or --
R:  You rely on family.
L:  -- one close friend.
R:  Family.
L:  Pardon?
R:  Family.
L:  Family?
R:  Do you have family fr- -- do you have fri- -- a lot of friends or, uh, how do you get along with your family?
L:  Oh, okay, I didn't hear that part about your family.  Well, I have a lot of friends.  How about you?
R:  [MN] Uh, not many.
L:  Not many?
R:  [MN] No, not many.
L:  You just have a select few?
R:  Right.  Well, I have just -- we only have -- there's just my wife and me, we're retired now.
L:  But, do you have --
R:  And, uh, we, uh, have -- she -- she has a couple of friends and I'm friends with them, too.
L:  Well, I live in a retirement community.
R:  Oh, do you really?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  Oh, you're lucky, you're --
L:  And it's a very active community and we've been here for two years and have a big circle of friends.
R:  I bet you do in something like that.
L:  We do, big circle of friends.
R:  [MN]
L:  Do a lot of socializing.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, none of them are as close as the friends that I left up north because of the time that we had friendships --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- up there, it was an extended period of time, like thirty years.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so we've only been here for two years but, I mean, we have a very extensive social life and what we would call close friends down here but, um, uh, still our friends are only two years old.
R:  That's true.  Not a long time.
L:  Pardon?
R:  Not a long time.
L:  No, no, not to build deep, deep relationships.
R:  I call them deep relationships rather than friends.
L:  Well, and -- and that's -- and there is a big difference in my opinion.  There's close friends that are more like family --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then -- then there's friends that you can know for years but they're a fr- -- a more distant type of friend where the, um, deep --
R:  You don't really know 'em.
L:  Yes, where the deep bond isn't there, like you would have with friends that are more like a family member.
R:  Right.  That's the difference, there's a fr- -- there's extended family, which are friends, and then there's family and then there's just people you know.
L:  Well, exactly and you -- our close friends, um, haven't lived in the same town as -- in fact, haven't even lived in the same state as we have for twenty five years but they're just like a family member, whether I see them once a year or possibly twice a year, um, and they're just like family.
R:  [MN]
L:  Where the loyalty, um, is there like would be for -- with a family member, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're just not what I would call distant friends.
R:  Right.
L:  And, like, somebody you might do something with but still you don't have this close personal bond.
R:  Right.
L:  And -- and what else did they ask us to talk about?
R:  Family.
L:  Family?  Oh, well, do you have any comments on that?  How do you feel about that subject?
R:  Family.  I -- I -- [PAUSE] I think it was family, wasn't it?
L:  I -- I didn't -- see I didn't hear their last sentence so I --
R:  I didn't hear that too well either, it was sort of blurred.
L:  I just -- I just heard about the friends.  I have trouble when they give the topic, it's not very clear to me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But see --
R:  I know, I talked this morning to somebody and we talked about our family.
L:  So you can talk on the same subject more than once?
R:  I think you can.
L:  Oh.
R:  Three times.
L:  Oh, I didn't realize that, okay.  Well, this is just my second call, so --
R:  How did you learn about this?
L:  Um, on the Internet through a friend.
R:  Yeah, I did -- we did -- my wife did.  She's on the Internet quite a bit.
L:  Uh-huh, yes, just a friend told us about it so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I thought I'd give it a try, thought this was easy money and real interesting.
R:  Yeah, it is very interesting.
L:  So [MN] -- can -- do you have any more thoughts on -- on the subject of friends?
R:  Um --
L:  How do you establish friends, new friends?
R:  Well, you just run across them and either you hit or off or you don't.
L:  That's true, that's true.
R:  And if you hit it off, you see 'em again and ...
L:  Well, we're in the situation where it's a very active community, um, dinner dances every Saturday night, so we're -- we're always in a situation of meeting new people here, whether it's at the swimming pool or -- and it's an extremely friendly community, extremely --
R:  Jeeze.
L:  -- friendly and welcoming community.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And because we're in nice weather nobody's stuck in their houses so you're --
R:  Right.
L:  -- out walking and you're meeting somebody, whether you're walking your dog or riding your bike.
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  When I was younger I had more friends.
L:  Did you?  Well, maybe it's because you don't get out to meet new friends.
R:  Well, we go out to restaurants and we have our friends at the rest -- we go to hotels.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  On trips --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in the city.  We don't go outside the city very much.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We stay in the city when we go to a hotel, we stay there but we go back to those places and we have, I guess, friends there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  People we know and like and get along with.
L:  Are your neighbors friends or are they just neighbors?
R:  Just neighbors.  We, um --
L:  Just neighbors.
R:  We moved in to this place, this house, about eighteen years ago --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it was, um -- it was all white.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But then the blacks have been moving in --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, it's not what it used to be. [MN]
L:  Well, see our -- this -- when you live, uh, in Florida in a retirement community they're all displaced northerners.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, generally all of our families are still up north.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's a good bonding when -- when holidays come and, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- everybody gets together --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- because most of us aren't with our family.
R:  Right. [MN]
L:  So, our friends down here --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- become an extension --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- of your family --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just because family is always so far away.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Almost everybody that retires here is from up north in cold weather.
R:  Right.
L:  So, um, that's -- that's why friendships are built so fast down here.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I -- I don't know what else they want us to talk about.  Do you have any more thoughts on -- on just the subject of friends?
R:  Um --
L:  I know they said do you have lots or just a few and we've kinda answered that.
R:  Well, there's a difference between what -- I guess, you have lots --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I have few close.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We have few close so --
L:  Well, see that's what we kinda left but we're still very close to them and still see them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- even though they're back in Michigan.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the closest ones are twelve hours away but we still see them and they're still as dear to our heart as they were then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we just don't see them on a monthly basis or couple of times a month like we used to, that's all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they're -- you know, they're long, longstanding friends and, as I said --
R:  Like we have our friend that, uh, we -- we've been helping out quite a bit.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, he's a friend of ours and he'll call us up if he has to get to a doctor appointment or the hospital or anything like that or if he needs anything, he'll call us up.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We won't always do it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But he knows he can count on us if it really got bad.
L:  Well, then -- then -- then he thinks of you as a very good friend.
R:  Yes.
L:  Just because of your loyalty and understanding.
R:  Yeah.  And then we have, um, our in laws, my in laws, her parents, and she's a very close friend with her mother.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they do things at least once a week.
L:  So that -- those are friends that are like relatives, very close friends, then.
R:  There's relatives and there's relatives.
L:  True.
R:  You're friendly with some relatives and not friendly with others.
L:  True, and sometimes friends can be more meaningful than some relatives.
R:  That's right and, uh, um, we -- I have -- we don't have any fr- ...
