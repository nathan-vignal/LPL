R:  I live in Long Island.  Who are you?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Hi.  This is Trista.  Did you say you live in Long Island?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, Okay.  [LAUGH] Um, I'm Trista.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  Um, I live in Minnesota. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  We're far away from each other. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH] I'm in the middle of the world[?].
R:  Mhm. [MN]
L:  So, you're -- are you in a very city ...?
R:  I'm in a suburban area --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- on Long Island, it's, um, [LIPSMACK] suburb of New York City and, ah, so it's kind of in between, it's not rural and it's not city.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, somewhere in that suburbia land huh?
R:  Right, and you?
L:  Um, I live in a rural community.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um ...  So, friends for me is, um, um, very close friends.  I don't have, like, a big huge circle that I, you know, go out with, you know, and do stuff with on the weekends.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I tend to have -- I have a couple of really close friends.
R:  Mhm.
L:  How about yourself?
R:  Um, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I have close friends they're -- some of them are my -- some of my oldest friends are my closest friends, even though I don't get to, um, talk to them that often, or definitely don't seem them much, because they live far away.  But, um, some of my closer friends, who I trust the most [LAUGH] are still those who I've known for many, many years.
L:  Isn't that funny how you can get to -- get back and touch base with those individuals and it seems like you were just -- you pick up --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- right from where you left off. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  Could I ask how old you are?
L:  Um, I'm thirty.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, so I don't --
R:  I'm -- I'm fif- I'm fifty one.
L:  Okay.  So [LAUGH] --
R:  So, I have [LAUGH] to go back --
L:  I don't mean to sound --
R:  -- to high school or college.
L:  Yeah.  I don't mean to sound like, um, like I know it all or anything, but, yeah, just from the perspective of if I see someone from high school or -- and stuff, that I used to be really close to, it seems like we just pick up right --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- where we left off.  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.  And sometimes people we've met m- more recently might seem like good friends and then, all of a sudden, they change on you and they're not -- o- okay.  Actually one of the questions was like, "Do you have many friends or a few?" and I guess I -- I'd say more a few really good friends, and some acquaintances and some frien- friends at, you know, different -- varying levels.  But the closest friends --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I can't say I have a whole lot of close friends [LAUGH]--
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- because, ah, I don't think that would work too well. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, that's what they say though, is like if you find a true -- your true closest friend is like a diamond, never let them go.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, there's that.  An- and nothing can destroy it.  You know, pretty much nothing that can destroy that kind of friendship, it's so strong.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I know what you mean with, like, the superficialness of some friendships.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's like they come and go and you -- they -- you know, they think that you did something that they don't care about and then suddenly they don't return your phone calls and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Or, yeah, some of those are mo- some of those friends like, you call them and they just don't call back.
L:  Yep.
R:  You call, they don't call back.
L:  Yep.
R:  And not that you did anything wrong, and it's like, "What kind of a friend is this?  What do I need this friend for?"
L:  Right.
R:  Um, wh- and why am I always the one who's doing the calling?
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] That's what I also find --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- with some of those friends, but, um, one of my closet friends from long ago, um, always calls me on my birthday.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I'm -- I'm -- she lives -- she lives in Portland, Oregon.
L:  Oh, okay. [NOISE]
R:  So, I know I'll always hear from her then.  So ...
L:  Aw, that's nice, once a year. [LAUGH]
R:  We call a couple of times during the year, but I know that I can count on her, and her birthday is right behind mine.  It's Ap- mine's April third, hers is April sixth. 
L:  So, she knows that, you know, she does- she'll never forget because she knows. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then turning fifty was a big turning point. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh sure, definitely. [NOISE]
R:  So, you know, we had lots to talk about when that came about.  But, um --
L:  A lot of reflection.
R:  -- it can be so, so far away and yet, yeah, it really is --
L:  That's neat.
R:  -- a very comfortable and secure feeling to speak to an old friend.  You know you can trust an old friend.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Whereas, some of these newer ones it's like, "What happened there?" or "Why haven't I heard from her?" or "What's going on now?"
L:  Right.
R:  And --
L:  I actually -- I, um, had watched this Oprah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know if you have ever heard of her -- ah, watched her before.  But, she had this thing on toxic friendships.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And how like some friendships will just suck the life out of you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that, you know, you need to like, cut those away from your life.
R:  Right, you have to step back and say, "Come on, this is not good for me.  [LAUGH] This is not working". 
L:  Right, right.
R:  I've had to do that with some people.  Just have to step back and say, [MN] "I can't divulge everything, I'm getting too close and it's not --"
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  "-- serving me well" and, um, I know to be careful with this person from now on.
L:  Right.
R: I wish I didn't have to be.
L:  Right, right.
R:  I wish I could totally --
L:  Trust. 
R:  -- trust as I trust my other friends, but it's just not turning out the same way, unfortunately.  Got to step back and not be as close, and be cautious and  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's a shame, and --
L:  I've had people --
R:  -- you wish that it could be like your other friendships.  It doesn't always work like -- like that.
L:  Right.  A lot of people, where they just sort of use you -- they just like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you're just basically there to, like, hear them gripe, but they don't want to hear anything about your life.  It's just they wanna l- they wanna like bitch and moan about everyone else --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but they don't want to hear about any of your issues.  And if you --
R:  Right.
L:  -- bring something up it's like, oh, they brush it off and ... [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's also funny when you're just like -- they're [LIPSMACK] -- you think you might be developing a new friendship.  It is becoming a very nice -- I was walking with somebody, um, for a n- number of months, once a week we'd walk together.  And you get to talk while you're walking and it's very nice.  And I thought that was really great.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, she found something to do called spinning and this and that.  Other things to do [MN] other than walking and got busy with other things and we weren't walking anymore and she doesn't talk to me every anymore, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  You thought you had a f- new friend. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  And they disappear.
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, when I lo- the other thing that I found, though, over the years especially.  Um, I work part time and a lot of my friends work full time, and they literally do not have the time for friendship.
L:  Yeah, it's becoming that way, isn't it?
R:  And that what -- I -- I found a lot of that happening.
L:  Yeah.  That's interesting because there is like, um, a article I just read in, um, a journal and it talked about how our, yo- our whole way of society is changing, and where friendships -- um, [SIGH] I cannot remember.  I think it was like something -- it was reflecting on a book that was written about bo- I think it was bowling or something.
R:  Mm.
L:  Anyways, it was talking about how the friendships where we used to have -- where we'd, like, get together and bowl --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, that kind of thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or, you get together for PTA.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Those are long -- times are long gone.
R:  Right.  Well, I --
L:  We don't have those social structures any longer.
R:  Right.  I find other things somewhat similar too.  I think email --
L:  Mm.
R: -- is changing the nature of relationships --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with people.  Even with -- I have two younger brothers, and they seem to prefer to email, rather than call.
L:  Yep.
R:  And I -- we lose the personal touch.  It becomes very cold.  It becomes ver-  you know, like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like a sentence, two sentences, very abrupt and sharp and ... [SIGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  It --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- loses too much.  And -- but when I call I'm interrupting their lives. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  "Don't call me now, I'm getting the children to bed.  Don't call me now, it's too late.  Don't ca --" [SIGH]
L:  Yep.  You feel like you're always an intrusion.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  I know exactly what -- in fact, my husband and I, tonight we went out, we were on the way home, we were talking about resume writing and how, um, tech -- the tech industry has really changed the ways resumes are being written.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They used to be like +superficial, you know, you just write like this whole long thing about -- you know, you'd really fluff yourself up.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And now, head hunters, all they want to know is like facts.
R:  Get to the point. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  Don't even use like +adjectives, just write down what you do and that's it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's like -- [NOISE]
R:  And they'll hopefully find out more about you in the interview, if you get the interview. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  And you really can't -- you know, for a person who is like -- doesn't have a lot on their -- under their belts --
R:  Mhm.
L:   -- that's hard because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, it's cold hard facts and you can't really play with it any more like you used to.
R:  Right.
L:  Sort of a reflection of our society and the whole mentality that our f- that friendships, um, they don't have that closeness, and there's no time, and it just seems like it's a rat race.  Everybody's going, going, going.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, that's for sure, and that's wh- what's making it more difficult to have those close friendships that I guess ha- had been established long ago by [LAUGH] myself with my friends and [MN] it just -- it's different now, it's -- it's really harder and I, you know, aware that it's -- sometimes maintaining it.  I -- I hate to be the one to have to keep it.  I -- I'm often the one who has to keep the friendships together.  Um, there was a [LIPSMACK] -- not a close friendship, but a nice --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- group through a mother centre that I was part of when I moved into the community about twenty years ago.  And then we would still continue to get together every now and then.  But then, everyone kept looking at me to get us together and set the date.  And if I didn't call, didn't happen. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  So, it hasn't been happening.  I'm -- it's falling apart, it's like --
L:  [SIGH] And you're sick of it, yeah.
R:  I don't know why, they all look to me.
L:  Right.
R:  And nobody else took the re- there were like four or five of us, and no one else took the responsibility.  We hav- we didn't see each other last year as a group, as we had in the past, and it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I guess I better remember to call again.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, I think you're right though, just people are so busy with so many things and, as I said before too, with w- w- women working it just, um, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there just isn't time for friendships as much as there had been.  Maybe that why my old -- one reason my old friends are my closer friends. [MN]
L:  [MN] Go ahead, I'm sorry.
R:  Yes.  Okay, go ahead, you go. [SIGH]
L:  I was just going to say that I had a, um, girlfriend that, we used to be pen pals --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and we -- when -- I had a really rough childhood.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And a really bad situation in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my household, and we would write each other and that was, like, my escape.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, we wrote from the time we wer- we were about eleven
