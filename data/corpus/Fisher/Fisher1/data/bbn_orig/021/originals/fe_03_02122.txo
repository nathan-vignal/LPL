L:  Hi, my name is Dave.
R:  Hi, my name is Teresa.
L:  Hi, Teresa.
R:  Hi.
L:  Where are you calling from?
R:  I'm calling from Arizona.  How about yourself?
L:  I'm in LA.
R:  Oh, nice and cool or ...?
L:  It's not bad, we're getting rain tomorrow.
R:  Oh, it was ninety two here today, so [LAUGH] getting a little miserable.
L:  Oh, we're se- we're sending rain toward you.
R:  Oh, good, we'll appreciate that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  So, are you the type that has a lot of friends, or just --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- friends and acquaintances?
R:  I would say a lot of friends.
L:  Oh, very cool.
R:  Um, but I'm a busy mother of two and so, as the years have gone on, it's getting to be more acquaintances. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I got you.
R:  But, ah, lots of friends.  And yourself?
L:  Um, I have a few close friends, and my best friend is my room mate, and then lots of acquaintances.  [MN]
R:  Mm.  My best friend is far away, so ... [SIGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  She lives in Washington, so I don't get to see her very often, but we speak [COUGH] probably once a month on the phone.
L:  Oh, that's cool.  How long did you know her, or, do you know her?
R:  Um, I met her in ninety two through, um -- we were both on a travelling, um, ministry team.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um, she was actually the year after me, but I'd gone back to visit some friends and met her, and then she came and spent Christmas with me because she had nowhere to go, and [LIPSMACK] thus began a good friendship.  So ... [LAUGH]
L:  Wow, that's -- that's really kinda cool.
R:  And how about yourself?
L:  Um.  I forgot what the question was.  [LAUGH]
R:  Um.
L:  Sorry.
R:  Where did -- where did you meet your friend, your best friend.
L:  Oh, yeah.  We were playing trivia at a bar.
R:  Oh, excellent.
L:  Yeah, it --
R:  I was just doing that online. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] [LAUGH] Yeah, it's really fun.  They got this system where the bar sends its average score and its high scores and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you play against everyone in the country.
R:  I've played it lots of times.  I, uh --
L:  Oh, very cool, you're an NTNer?
R:  My husband and I go down and drink a few beers or margaritas every now and then --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  -- without the kids, and play.  It's a good time.
L:  Oh, yeah, it is actually.  It's a good challenge.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  So, then, I have a lot of acquaintances too, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we moved around a lot when I was a kid, so I never really got a chance to have life long friends.
R:  Mm.  Um.  I have a lot of  I think I have probably m- more friends than acquaintances but, um, it's like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I said, as the years are going on I'm struggling to -- they're [LAUGH] becoming more acquaintances, just because --
L:  It's hard to make time.
R:  -- [SIGH] family time takes up a lot. But -- that --
L:  Well, family counts as friends too though.
R:  Yes, absolutely.  And we moved from Idaho, so most of our friends are from there, and it's hard to -- I -- I understand what you're saying, moving around a lot, it's hard to build a friendship, move, build a friendship, move.  And [SIGH] that's the kind of phase we're in right now, so ...
L:  Yeah.  Plus with no time left it's really -- it gets even harder.
R:  Oh, yes, absolutely.
L:  Gets even harder.  Yeah.  They make a big difference in -- in your life, but they're also a high maintenance thing too.
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]  Speaking of which, I just had some friends call tonight to say that they are in Laughlin[?], which isn't very far from here, it's four hours, and they wanted us to drive down and meet them.  And I said, "I can't".
L:  Yeah, no kidding.  
R:  'Cause it's too far with the kids.  
L:  Not without prior planning.
R:  Well, and they are going to rent a car and come down and see us, and, ah, you know, last minute thing, they'll be here tomorrow, and we already had plans to do things.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, what can you say?  You can't say no to friends that are gonna rent a car to come down and see you, right?
L:  No.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's kind of an honor actually.
R:  So, are you friends with any Lakers?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Laker fans. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm a college basketball fan, not so much a pro basketball fan.
R:  An NBA fan.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  The NBA is pretty much -- I think of it as bullfighting, and I think of college basketball as ballet, so ...
R:  Well, there you go.
L:  I prefer college basketball.
R:  I'm not very happy with some of the NBA officially, lately, but okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I'm with you on that one. [LAUGH]  We could be friends. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, it sounds like you're good sports -- do you have any college friends?
R:  Um, yeah, you know, my college buddies are my -- I would say my closest friends, but I went to a school in Idaho and moved out here, so ...
L:  Ah, okay.  So you are not much of affecting[?] --
R:  Actually missing college life a little bit, and college buddies and ... [NOISE]
L:  That was easier.  It was easier to have friends.
R:  Oh, absolutely!
L:  Because their job's like, what?  Four hours a day or something [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, oh, college --
L:  The rest of the time we could study really hard, I think.  But -- yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Stay up all night and --
L:  Yeah, then we could talk.
R:  -- drink coffee and [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, my college -- I have one really good friend that came out to Arizona, and she's studying at one -- uh, getting her doctorate degree out here, so --
L:  Oh, very cool.
R:  -- I was able to keep in touch with her, so, that's good.
L:  Mm that is good.
R:  So, you -- you've college buddies now, or you're in -- back in college, or in college?
L:  No, actually I was just, I don't know -- oh, 'cause I was thinking college basketball.
R:  Oh, okay.  Oh, that's right.
L:  That was -- that's what made the topic change, but yeah it's -- ah, everybody kind of grows away.
R:  Yes, the older you get.  I find that too.
L:  Yeah, and then -- plus my interests have gotten much more refined.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I was a generalist back then, and now I'm not.  And so, it was easier to have a common denominator.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  And now it's harder to find common denominators.
R:  Mm [MN].
L:  Not impossible because, of course, everybody's got something in common, but ...
R:  I totally agree.  Well, then I think that's why it's harder, do th- and just even with -- as age goes on people are -- move into the things they want to do, and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- family time.  A lot of people get married and have kids, and ...
L:  And th- those are very specific and focused areas of interest -- 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and in order to be with your kids and keep their interest you start getting into what they're into and ...
R:  Absolutely.
L:  The next thing you know, oops.
R:  [SIGH] It's hard to -- [PAUSE] is that our -- was that you- did your phone beep?  Oh, that was my phone that beeped.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Sorry.
L:  Yeah, I was wondering.  I thought maybe our time was up, but it seemed like it went by really fast.
R:  Um, I was going to say it's hard to, um, make new f- friends, but my neighbour and I have gotten close.  Just two people that would have never been friends ten years ago.  But common denominator of both stay at home moms, and struck up a pretty good friendship through that.
L:  Oh, that is -- that is -- that is really cool.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  That is really cool, 'cause I remember all those sitcoms where neighbors were good friends.  We have -- we have an interesting, um, couple down below us, they're French.
R:  Oh.
L:  And so it was really cool getting to know them and talking to their kids and everything.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah.  There is -- it's kind of, um ...
R:  Are they from France, like just moved over here?
L:  Yeah, they're from Paris, actually.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  And really super people.
R:  Oh, that's cool.  Our [SIGH] neighbors next door are from Switzerland.  They own the house and only come out here twice a year.
L:  Wow.
R:  And they -- yeah.  And, um, they -- they're here this week, and so, it's the same thing, it's so fun to hang out with them and get to know them and their culture and --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- have us over[?].
L:  It's a great new way to look at the world.  And I think that is one thing friends do is, you know, they've got something in common and yet they are not from family, so they've got -- they don't have the same [MN] prisms and filters and stuff.
R:  Yes.  
L:  And so you can -- as -- listening to their take on the world it was really interesting.
R:  So, I take it you're in an apartment then?
L:  Yes. [NOISE]
R:  So, are yo- friends with a lot of your neighbors, then?
L:  Well, it's kind of hard to f- we're the only, um, native English speakers in the building.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Really?
L:  Uh, [LAUGH] yes.
R:  [NOISE] Wow.
L:  Yeah, we've got, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- mainly Russian and Hungarian people.
R:  [NOISE] Wow.
L:  Yeah, we live in a part of West Hollywood that's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- called Little Russia.
R:  Oh, wow, how interesting. 
L:  Yeah, and it really is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, a lot of times --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you see the old guys walking around with all their medals from World War --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Two and, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it really is interesting --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- finding out what they're about.  They've got a completely different way of doing things.  Like, even getting on the bus, or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- talking to each other.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] We had one next door neighbor lady --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that, um, she was Russian, and she fell in love with an --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- African American guy.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  But they were both kind of nuts and, um, she ended up shooting at him.
R:  Oh my gosh.
L:  [LAUGH] I know.  Cursing at him and shooting at him, and the curses were very inventive, I must say.  [LAUGH] It was just crazy.
R:  So, you said you had a lot of World War Two vets --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in the complex?
L:  Oh no, not in the comple- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Although, I think our -- our exact next door neighbour is a vet, but he's kind of quiet about it.  But in the neighborhood, definitely.
R:  So, are they anti friends with the French people right now? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because of the war. [LAUGH]
L:  No, actually, because the French people are way more, um, way more pro war than I am.  So ...
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  It was very interesting.  They're -- they're definitely, like, American Americans.
R:  Oh awesome.  That's funny.
L:  Yeah.  It really is kind of cool.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And they are great because, you know, they're friends with each other, so that helps.
R:  Right.
L:  They're a great couple.  I -- I -- I like seeing couples that work.
R:  Right.
L:  It's really kind of encouraging.
R:  So, um, you said your best fr- friend is your room mate then?
L:  Yes.
R:  And, um, that's good.  And how long have you known each other?
L:  It's coming up on four years in August.
R:  Oh cool.
L:  Yeah, yeah, it's been, um, been a good thing.
R:  Good.
L:  It's weird 'cause we're from completely different places and ages and ...  It's really kinda strange, but he's stubborn and -- and I'm not.  No, I'm just kidding.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, that's good though, because sometimes your room mates are, like, worst enemy, but ...
L:  Yeah.  No, this -- this works out really good.  This works out.
R:  I guess my husband could be considered my best friend, too, huh?  Guess I should throw him in there.  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I think that's a good thing, yes.
R:  [LAUGH] Because he'd be my room mate too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, he is, huh?
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah, that -- I mean, I believe good marriages are founded on friendship.
R:  Yes, absolutely.
L:  You know, because that's really all you get.  I'm at an age now where everything's going south.  I can't remember when I went
