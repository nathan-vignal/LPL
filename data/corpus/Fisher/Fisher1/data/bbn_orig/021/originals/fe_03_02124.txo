L:  [LAUGH] Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Rachel.
L:  Hi, Rachel, I'm Jay.
R:  Hi.  Um, [MN]
L:  So, ah, do we keep introducing, or do we start talking?
R:  We might as well start talking, I guess and ...
L:  All right, so, ah, so I -- I guess the question again was, ah, [COUGH] t- w- about your friends, right? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  So, ah, do you have more than ten friends?
R:  Well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think -- I'm a college student right now, and in high school I was definitely the type to have just a few friends, but in college I have a lot more friends, which I think is a function of the type -- my -- my particular college.  Um --
L:  What -- what kind of college do you go to?
R:  It's a small liberal arts college, but it seems to attract -- [SIGH] um, I don't know, people who can be my friends.
L:  Ah.
R:  So ...
L:  Um.
R:  That's kind of neat.  But, I think in general, I'm a few close friends person.
L:  [MN] I think -- I think it's tougher as you get older too.  Like -- like, I'm -- I'm -- I'm in graduate school, so [MN] I think as [SIGH] -- maybe that's not necessarily true, but it's yo- you f- fi- you tend to find your f- friends through different environments.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Where, I think, where you're in high school, and -- and -- to some extent college, though in -- I think college it starts to choose -- especially high school, you're sort of, just kind of dealing with the people around you that sort of end up being your friends but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you -- you get a lot more chance to pick and choose, the older you get.  Mm.  It's a good question, I'm not sure.  So, who -- who's your -s your best friend go to your college right now?
R:  I don't know.  Um, best friend is an interesting -- like, when I was little I had someone I considered a best friend, and like [SIGH] I guess I still, when I think of best friends, think of her even though I'm m- more or less out of touch with her.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Now, um, but -- putting anyone else in that category it's kind of difficult.  But, I think my closest friends go to college, yeah, in general.  How about you?
L:  Um, I think I would say I [SIGH] -- well, it's kinda tough because [MN] I'm about to get married, actually, in a couple of months.
R:  Oh, congratulations.
L:  [NOISE] Oh thanks.  [COUGH] And, um -- 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I think [MN] -- I mean, my best man is going to be a guy that I've known for years and years, but we -- we probably only talk once every couple of months maybe.
R:  Oh, that's not too bad.
L:  I've known him for about ten years --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then -- but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I guess to some extent I consider my -- him my best friend because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] he's seen me sort of go through so much, um, he can -- he can relate to a lot of my past experiences, whereas some of my newer friends don't really know me from --
R:  Mm.
L:  [MN] -- from either college or working at a camp, or the Peace Corps or whatever, so, it's kinda ... [PAUSE]  I -- I don't think necessarily that -- that [MN] a best friend is s- necessarily gets the most contact.
R:  Right, no definitely not.
L:  Yeah.  And then I've got another guy who's going to be another best man, and just 'cause I have a lot of contact with him and [MN] I --I guess I kind of know him w- know him pretty well, [MN] but he kinda, he kinda gets on -- gets on my nerves. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm. [SIGH]
L:  But, ah, I don't know, it's ah [NOISE] -- I -- I think -- I think I'm sort of probably more his best friend than he's my best friend.
R:  Mm.
L:  But, I know that that's important to him --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and so ... that's -- that's an interesting thing. [NOISE] Um.  And in fact, right now we have some friends who are over, who are -- we're helping them make wedding invitations for their upcoming wedding.
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  Yeah.  We make paper, so we're [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  -- making paper, yeah.  And, ah ... but it -- I think one of the harder things is -- is actually balancing all your f- your friends.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, and in some ways just kinda, you get to a point where you just cut f- certain people off because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're not close enough and I think -- I think that kinda it goes around.  Like, I'm thirty and it's [MN] I think a lot of people do that.  Just after a while you either change groups of friends or you -- you just -- nobody seems to have time for anybody because you have so much more going on.  But, um ... [PAUSE]  And -- wait, can you hold on one second?
R:  Sure.
L:  Hey guys, a black ford just pulled up outside the stoop[?] [NOISE] [SIGH] Anyways -- um, we're laughing because there's a -- we'd ordered Chinese food --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, about ten minutes later they pulled up again next door, and now they just pulled up again to across the street.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  It's really funny.
R:  Oops. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, it's funny though too, I think, as you get older, you tend to -- you -- you -- find functions where you can accommodate more friends.  So --
R:  Like what do you mean?  Ah, sorry -- functions?
L:  Well, it -- it's like -- okay, for example, my fiancee and I, we have basically two nights out of the week that we're not either at work or in school.
R:  Okay.
L:  And so, we tend to get together with some friends --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because you -- when obviously you find someone you really like, you -- you get into a relationship, you like acquire --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all their friends, so all of a sudden you have to re-
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- sort your time out.  [LAUGH] And so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's like -- so, we have these gatherings where we like try to accommodate a lot of people at once because we know it's maybe weeks before -- and not only do you have to, like, get them together, they have to have time for you.
R:  Right.
L:  So, everybody gets a l- 
R:  Yeah, coordinating schedules.
L:  Yeah, it's like everyone gets less and less time.  Not only do you have to coordinate your friends' time but, as soon as they find a partner, then you have to c- coordinate their partner's time as well.  So, it's just like the chances -- [MN] it just gets harder and harder, I think.
R:  [MN]
L:  [COUGH] Um, and -- and so how often -- so, when you get together with your friends, how many people do you tend to get together with?
R:  Well, at college it's pretty informal, it's like we all end up at the dining hall at the same time.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Sort of thing.  So, it varies, I mean, I think, like I definitely have different interactions if I'm with one or -- one person or two people or a whole big group.  I tend to be much quieter if I'm out with a big group, and I listen --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- more than I talk.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, if I'm with just a few than I talk more.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Um.  [MN] Yeah, so it really -- it depends, I sometimes will invite a lot of people, but depending what else is going on, fewer will come.
L:  D- so do you prefer the smaller interactions, if you can help it?
R:  I like a -- a mixture of both.
L:  Huh.
R:  Um, I think.  But [PAUSE] but, yeah, there is something really nice about the smaller ones.
L:  Yeah, there's -- it's funny, my fiancee's, ah, she's -- when we're together with friends we, ah, [MN] have a hard time, like if -- in -- in larger groups she doesn't get as much input because everyone's -- [SIGH] ah, she needs about eight seconds before she'll interject.
R:  Mm.
L:  [LAUGH] Eight seconds of silence, and most people need about six or seven, so it's harder for her to --
R:  Yeah.  For me too, sometimes this is -- even if I start talking sometimes someone else will start talking too, and they win.  Um, I'm n- not quite sure how that works, but [PAUSE] [SIGH] getting into conversations can be tough.
L:  Yeah.  That is tough, and I think it's -- it's harder too, because when -- [MN] a lot of conversation revolves around [NOISE] -- like, I'm not saying this is true for you, but I've noticed it because I teach at the university as well and, um, [SIGH] students tend to -- when I pay attention to their conversations, kind of informally, like in the dining hall or whatnot.
R:  Mm.
L:  A lot of the conversations start with like kinda, me, me, me. [LAUGH]  And so, there's -- there's less of -- especially with less int- less -- maybe less intimate friends.  May- ma- may not be true when [MN] you are already familiar with someone and what's going on in their life.  But, if you [MN] pay attention to conversations, uh, you might find that people will start something off with something interesting and then someone will interject, not about -- to ask them about what's going on with that, but to actually s- to discuss something similar, so it's a lot of --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm talking about myself, and then you kind of jump in and you say, "Yeah, I'm gonna talk about myself too". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- but it's neat, 'cause as you get older, I think that happens less and less, people are less comfortable talking about themselves [LAUGH] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and there is much more questioning going on.
R:  So, what do they talk about?
L:  What do they talk about?
R:  Yeah.
L:  A- anything.  It's like, "What happened last night?"  "Oh, yeah, I got so drunk last night and I -- I was at this party and then -- and s- "
R:  No, but when it's -- I mean, when it's not about oneself.
L:  Oh, well, I think then you tend to respond to what someone else is saying, not with -- [NOISE]
R:  Oh, I see, okay.
L:  -- not with a similar situation that resolves around yourself, but asking them to expand on that.
R:  Okay.
L:  Or, to like, um, like back tailing[?], which is like mhm, yeah, uh-huh.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And, uh, so it's kinda -- I don't know.  Do -- do you notice that when -- with your friends?
R:  Um.
L:  Or certain friends, maybe?
R:  I think that I've been part of both types of conversations.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Um ...
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah I don't that you're --
R:  I don't -- [NOISE]
L:  I don't think it's ever exclusive, I think --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I guess -- I think ... [PAUSE]  Yeah, that would be interesting.  I haven't though about, before, when -- when each type shows up, if it's with people I know better, or less better --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- or who's interacting with whom, or why --
L:  Why tha-
R:  -- it's working that way.  That is really interesting though.
L:  I -- I don't think -- and it's not that some people do and some people don't.  I think everybody does it. [MN]
R:  Right --
L:  But --
R:  -- but in different situations.
L:  But there's just different degrees, and it's harder to relate to someone who, like you -- you walk away and, you know, like, "Man, they didn't ask me anything about myself". [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  I -- or they knew that all this was going on and they didn't -- they didn't want me to share -- they just kept sharing theirself.  And it's kind of if ... yeah, it's --
R:  Talking at each other instead of with.
L:  Yeah, it -- instead of -- instead of like, kind of giv-
