R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Marge.
L:  I'm Sandra.
R:  Sandra?  How are you?
L:  I'm good.  How are you?
R:  Good.  Good.  The topic o- -- of today is food?
L:  Right.
R:  And um, [LIPSMACK] what's you're favorite restaurant or do you prefer to eating at a restaurant or at home.
L:  Right, and um, then what's your favorite meal? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] My favorite meal would have to be, ah, chicken [MN].
L:  Mine is salmon.  I like salmon.
R:  You like salmon.  Oh, very good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Y- I -- that's a very -- I oh -- that's my Friday specialty.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  That's my Friday.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I prefer eating at home than eating at restaurants. [NOISE]
L:  I do to. [LAUGH] Ah, and that's 'cause I was on the road for a while and I ate at a lot of restaurants by myself, and that was just no fun.
R:  It does seem like the restaurant food -- it -- it's okay, but it's not like a home cooked meal.
L:  Yeah.  And it was lonely.
R:  [LAUGH] What's that, it was lonely? [LAUGH]
L:  Yup.  And they -- and they gave you so much you know, and I couldn't -- I couldn't keep it you know, in my room or anything.  So it was -- I felt so wasteful.
R:  I -- oh, I can understand that.  I can understand that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And what's some of your favorite foods?
L:  Well, mine is, um --well, salmon. [LAUGH] And --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I like um, I like a lot of fruits and vegetables, so um -- and you don't get a lot of that -- that's [COUGH] really fresh when you're at a -- at a, ah, out to dinner you know.
R:  Oh, okay, all right.  Very good.
L:  Yeah.  What about you?
R:  [MN] Well, I prefer -- well I don't do it all the time, but I like -- I prefer the fresh vegetables --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- over the froze as well.  If I can't get the fresh ones, then I prefer the frozen ones.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I -- I don't like them over cooked.  I like them kinda crunchy.
R:  Right, as long as they can like, steam a little bit.  Not too, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Not too done, not too soggy, but just right.
L:  Yep.  I agree.  Yep, and ah, jeeze, I don't know where -- if you were -- were to eat out, where would you like to go?
R:  If I would eat out?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I -- I love Italian food, okay?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  For some reason or another! [LAUGH]
L:  I like seafood.  I just love seafood.
R:  Well, now -- now I'm a seafood eater, as well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I love my fish.  I love my shrimps.
L:  Mhm.  And we live in, ah, u- up north, so we don't live by any like, body of water. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  So, everything has to be shipped in.  So that makes it hard.
R:  Well, as long as I can get, um, my seafood, [LIPSMACK] fresh, [LIPSMACK] I -- well, half fresh, it's not really fresh, 'cause a lot of the time people don't go fishing or whatever and I can't get it. [LIPSMACK] But ah, [SIGH] mm, we did say restaurants, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I prefer eating at home and they haven't eaten out at restaurants.
L:  Mhm.  And my favorite meals fish and um, yours is um, God, now I already forgot. [LAUGH] What is yours?  Salmon and, ah -- yours is -- oh I'm not, I don't know.  What was yours? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] What did I say?  Ah, did I say fish and shrimps?
L:  Ah, no, oh, uh, it was something like -- not lasagna well, um -- it wasn't -- it wasn't -- it wasn't fish and shrimp.  But that would sound good. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, well, I was just -- I'm just making dinner so [LAUGH] I think they're gone.  Oh, that would be good.
R:  That would be good? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Oh, man.  Um, gee.
R:  Well, have you found a restaurant that's, uh, close to home cooking?
L:  Um, no. [LAUGH] Not -- not where we live.
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  How 'bout where you live?
R:  Well, not -- it's close to it, but not exactly, you know, still a little something missing.
L:  Yeah.  Y- -- we have a lotta -- of restaurants from all over the world around here, 'cause we're living in a college town.  But there -- there's nothing that's really like home cooked meals.
R:  Yeah, I -- they -- they was the best.  Especially when you have somebody that knows how to cook.
L:  Yeah.  So it -- it would be nice to have something like that around here.  [LIPSMACK] But we just don't have that.
R:  But see, the only thing, I don't like -- well I do it, but I'm not a great, ah [LIPSMACK] -- if I can stay out of the kitchen sometimes, I'll make sure I get out of the kitchen, but still. [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.  Yeah.  It used to be like, when my kids were little I was a good cook, but not any more. [LAUGH]
R:  Nope?  Well that's understandable.  You don't have to cook as much.
L:  That's right.  So ... yeah.
R:  So you can head to the restaurant.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, sometimes. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  Doesn't mean we're any richer. [LAUGH] It just means ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Just means they're not there. [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  All right.
L:  Yep.  Wow.  Um, so [MN] how about you?
R:  Well, I still have to cook.
L:  You do.
R:  Do.
L:  You have kids?
R:  Yes.
L:  Ah.  How old are they?
R:  Ah, teenagers. 
L:  Oh, they're teena- -- oh, they eat a lot.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They eat you out.
L:  Do they eat -- do they eat at home, or do they snack at home?
R:  Oh, eat.  Snack is not the word. [LAUGH]  It's meal. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause you know how it is with teenagers.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  They just go through everything.
L:  Yep.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Every little thing. 
L:  Yeah.  Mine would never wait for meals, it's like, I'd come home and they'd -- everything would be gone. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I can understand that.  I can understand that.
L:  Yep.  So now they're all grown up and ...
R:  They can take you out to the restaurants. [LAUGH]
L:  No, they all left town. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And they're all broke. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  Ah. [LAUGH]
L:  And I felt lucky.  So, and I -- yep.
R:  Okay, and see we have restaurants and we have, um, [LIPSMACK] favorite foods.
L:  Right.
R:  Okay.
L:  And some shrimps and salmon and [NOISE] um, --
R:  Now [MN] I -- well this is not really a food, but okay [LIPSMACK] -- I was trying to um, now red meat, I don't do too much red meat.
L:  Me neither.
R:  I don't care for too much for red meat.  I try to not to eat it that often.
L:  Right.  Me neither.  I try to eat a lot of fish um, I eat a lot of vegetables and um, some chicken, some turkey.
R:  Right.  Right.  Right.
L:  You know.  But you know?  Just [MN] that's about it.
R:  We -- [LAUGH] that's just about it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But then we'd still have some good restaurants out here that, ah, you know, that I don't mind going to, and we'll frequently, you know, quite often.
L:  Yeah.  Well, do you have -- I mean, it's not that they don't have good restaurants, it's just that they are expensive and it -- it's just hard to, um, you know, afford them and --
R:  That's true, you can't do it every day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, at least I know I can't do it every day. [LAUGH]
L:  I can't do it every day.  You know, we don't even do it like, once a month hardly, you know [LAUGH] so --
R:  Yeah, see that's -- that's what I'm saying.  Yeah, there are some nice restaurants out and sometimes I do prefer going out, you know --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- at a restaurant.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  But then, ah, it's not a everyday thing.  [MN] --
L:  Yeah, and I don't like a lot of sauces on my stuff.  I like it pretty f- -- you know, I like to taste the flavor of what I'm eating.
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  I'm not a real fussy person, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, and some restaurants you do have to be careful because they have this spice and that, um, [LIPSMACK] dressing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And y- -- you look at it and say, "Well, what is this?", and you ask the waiter and they tell you, well, you know, "this is that, or that's that" and you think, "Whoa, should I try it, or shouldn't I try?"
L:  Yeah! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm, yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  I like spicy food, you know.  That's not generally a problem.  It's just -- I just don't like a lot of sauce.  I -- you know, I like to put on my own. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  You know, so I'm in control of the heat. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I can understand that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yep, I can understand that.
L:  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  Mm.  Now, um, hm.
R:  I'm trying to think of a [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Of other things.
R:  What else do the other -- let me see, we just had restaurants and favorite foods.
L:  Yep.
R:  Mm.  Oh, you know what else I love --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- is string beans.  Wh- --
L:  [MN] String bea- -- beans?
R:  Yes.
L:  Wow.
R:  If I can get them fresh ...  Oh, that's -- I can just eat those alone.  Nothing else.
L:  I like green peppers like that.
R:  I can eat string beans any day, as long as they're fresh, just by themselves.
L:  My husband loves string beans.  I like, you know, green peppers and I like peas.  Those are my favorite.
R:  Oh, no.  Well, I can eat 'em but -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] I'm not a pea lover, but I can eat them.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think um, my husband doesn't like lima beans, you know, and I kinda like lima beans, so --
R:  Now, see, I can eat those.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I can eat those.
L:  [MN]
R:  Specially the small ones.
L:  Yeah, the small ones are really good.
R:  They are, they're very good.
L:  Yep.
R:  Yeah, I have no problem with them.  They're very good.
L:  Yeah, and, uh, I kinda like um, I -- the way that I cook it up with almonds, you know?
R:  Okay.
L:  And you just sort of, um, saute the almonds in butter, [SIGH] and then you mix some spices up you know, uh, what I do is microwave the green beans and I throw some spices in there with the green beans, and then um, at the very end you put the al- -- the ah, sl- -- slivered almonds in there that have been you know, sauteed in butter and that's your kinda dressing and it's really good.
R:  Oh, okay.  I -- I'll remember that.
L:  Yeah, and it's really simple, so it's not real, you know --
