L:  Hello, how you doing?
R:  Hi, I'm good.
L:  Good.  Hey, my name is Mark.  Nice to meet you.
R:  Mark, I'm Avalon.
L:  Hello, Avalon, how you doing today?
R:  Just fine.
L:  Well, that's good, I'm glad to hear that.
R:  And I suppose we're supposed to -- I understand we're supposed to talk about food, if we want to eat at home or restaurants and what our ideal meal is.
L:  What our preferences are, in as far as where and what we'd like to eat, I think.
R:  Okay.  Well, believe it or not, honey, I prefer my own cooking.
L:  You do?
R:  I really do. [LAUGH]
L:  I bet you [inaudible] really well, don't you, Avalon.
R:  Ah.
L:  [LAUGH] What do you -- what -- what do you cook well?  What do you like the best?
R:  Anything I wanna cook.
L:  [LAUGH]  Do you cook, um, Italian food, Western food, American food?  Like, wh- -- what -- what -- what kind of slant do you have towards your cooking?
R:  Well, I can do all the above.  For about thirty years I was a vegetarian --
L:  Really?
R:  -- so I had to learn how to cook in self defence, and I have a --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a disabled child that's on a low calorie diet, so I had -- had to learn how to count calories, and how to eat a lot of food without packing on very much in the way of caloric content.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  And I learned to -- to fix vegetarian meals in about four different languages.  Mex Tex, Chinese --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- ah, Italian --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I forget what the other one was.  I guess, American.  We've kind of relented [SIGH] in the last few years, because she's become a carnivore as she's gotten older.
L:  Right.
R:  So I feed her some meat, but my preference is still vegetables and -- and fruits and fresh squeezed juices, of all things.  Don't do nearly enough of those but when we eat out she loves to go to Chinese food restaurants.  That's her favorite, and I like that.
L:  Yeah, Chinese is good.  I like Chinese too.
R:  Yeah.  What do you like to eat?  The most?
L:  Oh, um, I would say that I probably don't eat enough vegetables.  Vegetables are very important and I try to um, I try to supplement my diet in other ways because I -- I miss out on a lot of that part.  I drink some um, some -- some drinks that -- that I mix in um, [LIPSMACK] like, ah, this -- this good stuff.  It's called Emerald Harvest.  This company in [inaudible] makes it and it's supposed to supplement your ah, your -- your vegetables and stuff like that.  But I -- I like to eat meat, for the most part.  Um, I love chicken, ah, steak, eggs.  I eat -- I probably eat about three eggs every day.
R:  Good grief. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  At least three eggs.  Like, in the morning.  Um, I eat peanut butter throughout the day, like it's -- it's going out of style.  Oh, and bananas all the time.  'Cause I work out a lot and I try to -- try to keep, you know, a high protein diet.
R:  Well, you'd have to work out a lot with all that peanut butter.
L: [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  I can't remember the last time I tasted peanut butter. [LAUGH]
L:  I could probably get through a, um, a jar of peanut butter -- I probably do it about every three days --
R:  No kidding.
L:  -- a jar of peanut butter.  Yeah.
R:  Huh.
L:  Just about.  But um, I love to eat out.  I don't -- I don't eat out all that much, but when I eat out, I like to go to um, Chinese buffet restaurants.
R:  Yeah.  Yes.
L:  I go to -- I go to that over in, um, around where I live.  I live in New Jersey.  I don't know um, if you're familiar with the area, but it's in um, right around Woodbury.
R:  I've seen a map.  I bet you can't --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- tell where I'm from -- from the accent, can you? [LAUGH]
L:  Sounds somewhere in the south.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.
R:  I'm a Texas girl. [SIGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  Cool.  That's nice.
R:  Far aways Texas.
L:  Yeah, that's cool.
R:  Well I -- I get some green powder and -- and supplement our diet with that.  Mix it you know, in water or juice or whatever.
L:  I mix -- I mix --
R:  Because Amer- -- Americans don't eat nearly enough greens unless you're black and then they cook 'em all to hell and back.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so it don't even matter anymore. [LAUGH]
R:  Really, they taste good, with all the fat back in 'em, but they cook 'em too much.
L:  Yeah.  They're not good for you anymore.
R:  Nah.  But --
L:  Yeah, I mean, it's really interesting how like, ah, we put, um, how much fat we put into our food because like, we're just naturally have a -- have a desire to eat fat.  See that's the way God made us, to like, want -- want to eat fat and things like that.
R:  Well, it tastes good.
L:  Yeah, it does.
R:  My -- my grandfather and grandparents had a farm in central Texas --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and they raised all their own food.  And I tell you, beef doesn't taste like what they raised and every fall he'd slaughter a hog and hang it up in the smoke house.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And when she wanted a- some bacon, she'd go out there and cut off however much she was gonna have, you know, for breakfast?
L:  Right.
R:  And they ate plenty of red eye gravy and he had a stroke and died and [LAUGH] when he got old and --
L:  Oh, man, yeah.
R:  But they canned up stuff, at the, you know, at the end of every gardening season, and naturally the stuff gets ripe, right in the heat of the summer when it's the very hottest.
L:  Yeah, right.  Ahah.
R:  And oh, it was hot in there canning stuff, but I learned to can from an early age and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- have done it as an adult.  I like to grow a lot of my own food, too.
L:  We do a little bit of that in my house.  Some tomatoes, a couple of other vegetables, some greens and some, ah, some fruit, cantaloupe, water melon and stuff like that.
R:  Well, I can grow Swiss chard[?] here almost year round and it's good, because it -- the winters are not just awful cold.  We'll get one or two snows --
L:  What you say you grow, I'm sorry?
R:  Huh?
L:  What is it that you grow?
R:  What -- what?
L:  You -- you said you can grow what all year long?
R:  Swiss chard.
L:  What's that?  I don't even know what that is.
R:  It's a green.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And some people -- it -- it's milder than, um, most of your -- well, turnip greens or collard greens.
L:  [inaudible].  Right.
R:  And it grows well down here.
L:  Okay.
R:  And it's really, really good just to wilt down --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  -- and because it grows to long, you know, it'll grow all through the winter.  You've got fresh greens there, and sometimes it'll survive the summer heat if you keep it shaded and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- water enough on it.
L:  [inaudible] right.
R:  But it's a really -- and some people grow it as an ornamental it's so pretty.  It's got real curly leaves, but it doesn't taste real strong.  And spinach will not grow here at all.  That should --
L:  Oh, I love spinach.
R:  I do too, but we can't grow it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have to buy it in the grocery store.
L:  Yeah.  You're too dry, I guess?
R:  Mm?
L:  Too dry out there in Texas to grow, ah, spinach?
R:  It's too hot.  It's too hot.  We're --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  We're on the northern edge of the Chirwalen[?] desert.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And have a real high Hispanic population, so I've learned to cook really authentic Mexican food.
L:  Okay.  That's good.
R:  Everything from cactuses and -- you know, I've got enough cactus in my yard I could live on that and tumbleweeds for a year if I had to.
L:  Wow, I didn't know you could eat that.
R:  Yeah, most people don't.  
L:  Yes.
R:  But it's good for diabetics, it -- it lowers your -- or regulates your blood sugar.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, it's got a lot of good properties.  And I make prickly pear jelly, usually every year.
L:  Mm.
R:  That's a bunch of work, but it sure is worth it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I've learned to make home made tamales --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- and I've --
L:  I love hot food.  I like spicy food.  Like, I -- one of my things is um, if I go out to a like, a -- a restaurant or a pub or something.  Um, more than likely I'm gonna get the um, the hottest wings they have there, and I just love 'em.
R:  Do you like Thai food?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I've had Thai food.  It's very good, yeah.
R:  Some of that stuff will have smoke coming out of your ears.
L:  It sure will.  Yeah.  But um, I don't know if you have it down there, but it's um, a red hot tabasco sauce made by Franks.  I don't know if you get that down there.  It's nice to, ah, just pour that on everything, just about.  In soup, in chicken soup --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- a- and on my wings.  I just love the hot sauce.  It's great.
R:  No, we don't have that, but you know, because so much of the population here is Hispanic, we have lots of hot stuff.
L:  Yeah, I'm sure you got -- you got your share of ah, hot food down there, yeah.
R:  And believe -- believe it or not, in the desert we have shrimp farmers.  They're not doing too well, because too much shrimp is being imported, and undercutting them in price and in quality, but we've got a [inaudible] family here that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that grew up in Mexico.
L:  Right?
R:  And they started making ah, you know what habanero peppers are?  They're little ti- --
L:  No, I don't think I do.
R:  They're little tiny red things and they are hotter than the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- henches[?] of Hades.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And she started making up, uh, habanero hot sauce and selling it.  Ah, they go to different places, like street fairs and festivals and sell their shrimp.  They sell shrimp shish kebabs or um, fajitas.
L:  Right.
R:  That's real big down here.  And then they s- sell the frozen shrimp in five pound boxes.  And they sell a lot of hot sauce.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  It's an interesting area.  'Course I guess it is up there too, but the one time I was up in that area -- I been up there twice.  I've been -- well, three times, really.  I've been to New York City --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was working on an Indian reservation for the Methodist Church and they carried a bunch of staff up there to describe our program.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then I visited a guy up in, I think, New Jersey.  And then I was up in Buffalo, New York, and that area's too congested.  Man, you can't -- you can't see anything but houses and roads and people and power lines.
L:  I- it is doing it -- where I live, it -- it's filling up real quick.  Like, ah, a lotta like, lotta developments going up, a lotta -- lotta businesses, um, just all kinds of ah, all kinds of different things there.  Just -- just popping up.  It's crazy.
R:  Mm.  I'd -- I'd get claustrophobic in that.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I lived in Houston and you know, got spoiled on lots of fine restaurants down there, and -- and -- and learned to eat lots of different kinds of food that was real good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I like the culture of the city.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I couldn't wait to get home after [LIPSMACK] I got done there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean I --
L:  We have -- we have a lot down here, a lot of different restaurants, and I'm not too picky.  If someone wants to go to a -- just to somewhere else you know, a steak house, any -- you know.  If it's -- if it's a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- good eating I'm there.  It's n- -- no big problem for me.
R:  How are you on fast food?
L:  Absolutely no.  No way.
R:  [LAUGH] That's a good --
L:  I will not -- 
R:  -- that's a good sign.
L:  [LAUGH] I will not eat McDonald's.  I will not eat Wendy's, Burger King, any of that, nah.  I used to eat it but like, whew, no way.
R:  No, me neither.  I hear they put cow eyeballs in those ground beef --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- patties in McDonalds.  I --
L:  I wouldn't doubt it.
R:  -- never verified it but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, I -- I won't eat in those places.  I'll eat their veggie burgers.  You know, I think -- not McDonalds, but that -- Burger King started doing veg- veggie burgers.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I wish they'd do --
L:  I'm sure that's -- sure that's okay.  Yeah, that kind of stuff isn't bad there.
R:  Well it's textured soya bean protein. [SIGH] 'Course it may be genetically engineered now, but --
L:  Right, yeah, who knows?
R:  Another reason for growing as much of your own food as you can. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's the thing. I -- I -- I just really think that's -- that's the way to go -- is, you know --
