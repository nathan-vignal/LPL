R:  Steven Morocco[?].
L:  Hi, Pam Weiner[?].
R:  Hello.
L:  Yes.
R:  What's your name again?
L:  Pam.
R:  Pam?
L:  P.A.M.
R:  Pam.  Pam, all right.
L:  Right.
R:  I'm Steven.
L:  Hi, Steven.  I --
R:  So -- [LAUGH]
L:  W- -- so, we're supposed to discuss food and, uh --
R:  Yes, the restaurants.  Which do w-  -- which if -- which you like better.  The restaurants or, uh, eating at home?
L:  I would rather eat at home.
R:  Really?
L:  Because, um, I can, you know, I know exactly what's going into the food that I eat and I can purchase it at, um -- at a Br- -- you know, Bread and Circus, and those kind of places where -- 'cause I -- I like to buy organic foods.
R:  Where's Bread and Circus?
L:  It's just in the other town, uh, the town near us.  It's a n- natural food store.
R:  An- and where are you?
L:  Wh- -- I'm in Massachusetts.  Where are you?
R:  Um, I am in Los Angeles.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, um, Whole Foods Market is the same thing.  Do you have any Whole Foods in that area?
R:  Can you hold on one second?
L:  Sure.
R:  Tell him I'll call him right back.
L:  [SIGH].
R:  Uh, sorry about that.
L:  Oh, that's all right.
R:  Um, I, uh [LAUGH], yeah, like Whole Foods Marketers.  I -- I -- I definitely shop there.
L:  Right, and so that's what Bread and Circus is -- Bread and Circus u- um, around here they were Bread and Circus, and now it's all owned by Whole Foods.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  So, it's all related.  So, that is why I like eating at home.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I -- I like it -- getting -- getting stuff from Whole Foods and like taking it home, but I'm really not that good of a cook.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, generally, uh, I, uh, I -- I like to eat out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because, you know, I get to ex- -- you know, experience different things -- experience different cuisines and stuff.  My -- my, uh -- my whole, uh, uh, uh, cooking ability is very limited.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so, um, I like to go out to just, you know, get more [SIGH] you know, get more food, you know --
L:  Yeah, w- --
R:  -- experiences.
L:  -- well, I have a child who's allergic to dairy, and --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- um, he has a problem with wheat and other grains like that, and so, you know, that's why we really have to s-, um, eat mostly at home, because we can't take the chance [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I know.  I know a couple of people who are allergic to wheat, and it's -- uh, they -- they pretty much can't go out.  I mean, they -- or -- and when they do, they have to make all these, you know, specific instructions to people.
L:  Are you there?
R:  Yeah, I'm here.
L:  Okay.  Um, yeah, so, um, so I guess my perfect meal would be, um, steak on the grill.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, and, uh ...
R:  Organic -- organic, uh, range fed steak?
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And organic, uh, peppers and onions and that kind of stuff, um ...
R:  You know, a lot of that stuff, uh -- the organic is French for o- -- uh, overpriced.
L:  Yes [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, that's what I've read, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I can really taste the difference.  Like if I go to, um, just a regular department store around here and I taste like their apples or, um, say, nectarines or th- -- or anything like that, um, I can taste the difference and also with the tomatoes, tomatoes like the --
R:  Yeah, are supposed to taste like fruit, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.  The tomatoes like the cellophane package one where you get four in a package --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I can, um -- I can taste the chemicals in them.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  See, after a while you really can --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- you -- you know, like when you're away from it.
R:  Yeah.  See, I was sort of raised on crappy food, so it's, uh --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- you know, it's, uh -- the whole -- I -- I can't really taste the difference now --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, but, you know, I definitely like, I think it's more flavorful and I think it's [SIGH] -- I just, you know -- I -- I think the reason why I eat it is because I -- you know, it's a kind of sense of wellbeing, like I -- like I, um, I know that what I'm eating is good for me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, sometimes I worry about like Whole Foods being a chain, and like, you know, them -- you know, I -- I -- I'm afraid that they're not really, um, as healthy as they seem.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but in general, I think it's more peace of mind for me, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think my perfect meal though [SIGH] uh, honestly would be sushi, going out like for a sushi and having like, uh, you know, basically being able to buy whatever I want at a really nice sushi place.
L:  See, I don't eat any s- -- uh, fish, except for tuna fish.
R:  Oh, God, I love [inaudible] --
L:  So, uh --
R:  -- I'm just a sushi addict --
L:  Yeah.  No, I've never even tried it.
R:  Really?  So, you just --
L:  My daughter -- 'cause I -- I have a daughter too, and she's six --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- and she has tried, you know, the nonfish sushi, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like all vegetable --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and she loved it.
R:  Yeah, well, you know, the seaweed is very good for you --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the rice is very good for you.  You know, you get your omega threes, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the omega three fatty acids and, um, you know, generally, um, you know, I think that's how Asians live longer than [LAUGH] anybody else, and their diet -- I mean, I lived with two Japanese women for a long time and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and their diet, uh, is -- is -- is, I think, part of the reason why they live so long.
L:  Mm, oh definitely.  I mean, my, uh -- my son, he -- we give him all kinds of essential fatty acids, and, uh, his skin is unbelievable and he doesn't get sick like other people do, you know, like other -- you know, like other k- -- everybody around him will have sore throats, colds, whatever, and he is -- is healthy as can be, you know, he doesn't catch it.
R:  Right.
L:  So, um ...
R:  Where are you from in Boston?
L:  Well, we're about, uh, thirty five, forty minutes away in, um -- we're actually like -- I have cows living down the street from my house, so ...
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  How far are you from Saugus?
L:  Oh, okay.  That's, uh -- well, Saugus is about, I'd say, forty five minutes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I know Revere, Saugus, all that area.
R:  Yeah, my -- one of my, uh -- one of my good, uh -- I'm Italian and you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- my -- my friend who lives there is I- Italian -- it's a big Italian place there.
L:  Right.
R:  A lot of, uh -- a lot of Guidos.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And the delicious food.
R:  Yeah, true, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, one -- one ar- area that I most definitely like to go check out is the north end.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Delicious.  It's unbelievable there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's, um -- there used to be a restaurant that, um, my husband and I used to go to, but, for some -- I think it's closed down now -- it was called The European.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they w- -- they had unbelievable food there but, um, that was before we had children [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] And they just changed everything.
L:  They just changed it all.
R:  Well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH].
L:  So ...
R:  Unfortunately, I do not have any kids, at least that I know of [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I really hope I don't.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  I'm just so not ready for that.
L:  Mm.  But, um, my brother in law is out in San Diego and he -- he, um, sends all kinds of vegetables when he -- well, when he crosses the country --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in a plane.  He brings a big thing of vegetables for all of us, and the vegetables are unbelievable.  I mean, he brings hickama[?] and all that stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, all different types and, uh, oh, delicious.
R:  Yeah, we've got some good eats, uh, down here, I have to say, I mean, I just -- you know, a lot of it is money for me, like, I mean, even though I love restaurants and I like getting out more -- because mostly because I don't have to do the work --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, um, it's a money thing, you know, it's pretty expensive to eat out if you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- want to eat well.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  So, um, you know, it's really more of a money thing.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I -- when I ten- -- like I don't eat much meat, but when I, uh -- pretty much the only time I do eat meat other than fish, I -- I eat it when I eat out.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, and -- and I'm always kind of, you know, scared of the beef, because I don't know what's, you know, ranch fed and what's not, so, um, you know, it's, uh, a lot of, you know, about this question, you know, about eating out, is -- is -- has a lot to do with money for me, you know --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- it's -- it's really more of a money issue --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, because my perfect meal would be eating out, but it's like whether I can or not it's a different story.
L:  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  Have you ever thought of, um, taking a cooking class [LAUGH]?
R:  Yeah, definitely, but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, it -- that also costs money as well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I mean, I'm, uh -- I'm just basically an ex- -- you know, grad out of school, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm still trying to -- I'm still struggling a little bit.
L:  And what did you go to school for?
R:  Uh, anthropology.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, uh, not a [LAUGH] -- not a big money making, uh, potential.
L:  Right, mm.  I, uh -- I went to school for accounting.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But, uh, [LAUGH].
R:  Well, that's -- that's very practical.
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  And very, you know, uh, very --
L:  But after I had my children though I decided that I, uh, I wanted to be home with them and, uh, so I've been out of the workforce for quite some time now.
R:  Well, you know, I mean, that's, uh -- that's -- that's really -- that's really, uh, noble.
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean, a -- a lot of -- I mean, you're giving the kids the attention they need basically.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, I mean, when you -- when you go to work -- when you stay at work like that, you -- you kind of deprive them of a -- of a lot of things.
L:  Right, and I just didn't want to do that.
R:  Right.
L:  And, uh, you know, I just couldn't see myself, you know, seeing them only two hours at night, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it just wasn't my cup of tea.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  So, um, y- -- so, I -- we went this route and, uh, my husband actually just right now is changing careers. He's going to become an EMT --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, so, um, you know, but I'm still at home [LAUGH].  But he -- he just started the course today.  He's a firefighter.
R:  Really?
L:  So, he wants to be a firefighter and a EMT.
R:  Did he help out over the World Trade Center when that happened?
L:  No, no, he didn't, but they did send people, um, you know, not far from where we are.  They did -- they did send people, so, um -- so, you know, we were kind of represented --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- but, um, yeah, they did, they actually did things ...
