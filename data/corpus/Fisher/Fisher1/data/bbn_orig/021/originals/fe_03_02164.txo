R:  [COUGH]
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  This is Dee from Florida.
L:  Yeah, this is Phil from, uh, LA.
R:  Oh, hi [LAUGH] way across. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Long way away.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, food.  My favorite food is going out [SIGH] to Outback with the Blooming Onion, the T-Bone, the works and being served.
L:  Yeah, Outbeck -- Outback Steakhouse, that's, uh, that's pretty cool over there, I guess, but, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know -- you know, I would, uh -- I don't know.  Would you want to live in a -- in a restaurant or -- or at your house, or what?
R:  [SIGH] Well, I -- I wouldn't -- having been the mother and all that, you know, and my kids are grown now, and I did all that home stuff, I'd much rather go somewhere and be served.  I am a little concerned about nutrition and sanitary, you know, conditions and things like that though.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  You know. [COUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I -- I would like to live in a restaurant though, because you know, then I wouldn't have to worry about fixing my own meals or whatever, but then there is the -- the nutrition thing or whatever, and you know, you want to eat right and, you know, you want to make sure everything's clean.
R:  Yeah, well, you --
L:  You don't --
R:  -- you --
L:  -- you don't know what --
R:  -- you can be --
L:  -- you don't -- you don't know what the cook's doing in the back or anything, you know.
R:  Well, that's true.  Even though they have inspections you still have to wonder about things like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and -- and if you go to a buffet somewhere, I really worry about that. [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause then you got the other people sneezing all over the place and you know.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you know, food under lights, you know, can only be there so long --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you wonder, "Ju- -- gosh, has -- has this stuff been there since lunch time?" you know.
L:  I guess if I lived in a restaurant I'd worry about all that stuff --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- but like whenever I go out to eat, I like -- I really don't care -- I'm not thinking about the cook or you know, who was at the salad bar before me or anything, but --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- I don't know.  I'd probably have to move out of the restaurant pretty quick, 'cause I'd probably be getting kind of paranoid --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, with all the -- like SARS and stuff --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, and all these different, uh, diseases that people got.
R:  Yeah, well, I think you have more concern with the food than, you know, being around people, because you know, especially with, you know, chicken.  I worry about things like in a deli and things like that, with chicken under the lights and, you know, salmonella --
L:  Oh yeah --
R:  -- is a big thing --
L:  -- food poisoning.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you wonder if they're really going by the guidelines that they, you know, that they're supposed to.  I really wonder that sometimes.
L:  Yeah.  I was thinking --
R:  Um ...
L:  -- all right, live in a hotel with a restaurant --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- so, you get the best of both worlds right there.  That --
R:  [LAUGH] There you go.
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  [LAUGH] No housekeeping and no cooking. [LAUGH]
L:  You know what I mean?  That -- that's perfect --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- right there --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and -- and you being a -- you know, a full time mother, I don't know, you know, if you still got kids around or anything, but I mean, that would be the perfect thing for you, huh?
R:  Right --
L:  You know --
R:  -- no, my kids are --
L:  -- the maid would come in and clean up --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and you wouldn't have to clean up --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then you just walk downstairs and -- and have, you know, a seven course meal or whatever cooked, you know, so ...
R:  Right, well, my kids --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- are grown and gone and I live by myself.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, I do go out periodically with, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a guy or two, and their -- their thing is at my age, "Gee, I'd really like a home cooked meal".  Well, my answer is, "Well, when will you do this?" [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  "When do you want to do it?" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know what? --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I was -- I was at -- speaking of home cooked meals, I was at, uh, Marie --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- Calendar's yesterday.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I would love to live there.
R:  Yeah?
L:  'Cause they got -- they got it all.  It seems like they're clean, they're -- you guys got Marie Calendar's out there, right?
R:  Yes.
L:  You know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know about?  Okay.  I mean they're clean, they got the healthy, they got the -- you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the healthy food, you know --
R: [COUGH]
L:  -- whatever you want to eat, you know.  Just pull up a bed in the back and, you know, sleep there.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It would be perfect. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  But I would like to live at Marie Calendar's.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Home cooked -- yeah.  Home cooked meals every --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- day --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I just wouldn't stay there all the time, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  Because I'd be --
R:  Right.
L:  -- kind of like the weirdo sleeping in the back.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Like everybody else is coming there to pay to eat.
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, you'd be wak- -- you'd be waking up, and you come out with your, uh, your pyjamas on or whatever -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- scratching your head, "Oh, I think I'll have the, uh -- I don't know".
R:  Yeah, but even in the best of places you have to worry about who's scratching their head and touching my food [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know.  Who's picking their nose and touching my food, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Yeah, in California we have the, uh -- th- this -- this rating, right.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It goes like by grades like at school, like A -- A, B, C, whatever.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, you know, a lot of the restaurants that -- that have the A score will score, you know, put -- put it up in the window, A, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we're totally clean.  They passed inspection.  But even those, you know, you still -- you don't know what they're doing, you know.  They might have been like, "Okay, the inspectors coming, let's clean it up", you know.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I don't know.
R:  Right.
L:  But, you know --
R:  Well, the worst thing [LAUGH] -- the worst thing that happens to me here in Florida is -- we have a lot -- I'm sure you do too -- Chinese restaurants.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  They're like back to back to back to back, and most of the Chinese restaurants I notice, when you walk in, you smell bug spray, and that's a big turn off to me.  I just --
L:  You know what?  Yeah --
R:  -- turn around and leave.
L:  -- yeah.  Chemicals and -- oh, man.  I don't like breathing chemicals, let alone eating them, you know what I mean?
R:  Uh-huh, and I --
L:  You know --
R:  -- don't know if that's just --
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  Yeah, I don't know if that's like something that just happens with Chinese food, but it just seems like most of the Chinese restaurants I've gone in to, that's what I smell and I just leave.
L:  You know -- you know what the perfect meal at -- at a Chinese restaurant is?
R:  [COUGH] What?
L:  Orange Chicken, uh, the rice just mixed up with, you know, just pretty much just go to the buffet, and just like eat it all.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  [LAUGH] It's cheap, I can tell you that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah -- uh, it is cheap --
R:  You know.
L:  -- but you know what?  You get tired of it, you know, so, there's no --
R:  Well, sure.
L:  -- no living in Chinese restaurants.  That's just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.  That's just --
R:  No, no, no.  No --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- no, I [LAUGH] --
L:  -- there's all that grease, and -- and it's --
R:  And [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- total oil and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and you know what I mean?  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you could -- you could, you know, Friday night or whatever, you know, eating out --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- of the little box or whatever, it's cool.  But, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- every day --
R:  Well, they do --
L:  -- for every day --
R:  -- fry --
L:  --  I couldn't do that.
R:  Right.  They fry a lot of food.
L:  Yeah, everything's --
R:  They really fry --
L:  -- oily, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It tastes good, you know, hot and everything, but the next day it's all like, you know, stuck together in your fridge.
R:  Mhm, [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, God. [LAUGH]
L:  Can't handle that.
R:  [LAUGH] No, no, no, no, no.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, we have -- you know, other than that, we have some really nice places, you know, you could go to, um ...
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know --
L:  But you know what?  Like, uh, I guess when I -- I'm only twenty years old, right.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But like, you know, when I settle down eventually, you know, and get a wife or whatever, and if she cooks --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I would prefer to live at home.  Otherwise, we could both live in Marie Calendar's.  You know what I mean?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That would be perfect right there. [LAUGH]
R:  Is cooking a requirement [LAUGH] for a wife? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, no, no, it's not.  I mean, you know, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that would be just great.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, 'cause I like to eat, but I don't like to think about it.  You know what I mean?
R:  Well, why don't you learn to cook and let her clean up? [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I -- you know what?  I really don't have a problem cleaning up.
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  As long as she cooks, I can clean.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, you know, I'll wash the pots and pans if she cooks, you know.
R:  Right.  So, overall, you're probably better -- you would rather have home cooking?
L:  Definitely.
R:  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah.
L:  You know, I like real food substance, you know.  I don't -- I can't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- eat pizza every night or, you know, live in a Chinese restaurant.  You know what I mean?
R:  Right, right, Taco Bell.
L:  Yeah.  You know, you need real food.  You need -- you need something to get you -- you know, keep you going, day in, day out.
R:  Right. 
L:  You know.
R:  Not [LAUGH] -- like tuna noodle casserole [LAUGH]?  I -- I only say that because you know what?
L:  But, you know what?  After -- after a hard day's work or whatever --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- coming home to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- tun- tuna casserole or something like that, you know, I mean, you're hungry as hell and -- and you know, it's --
R:  It tastes good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, that's about the only thing I could cook when I was very young and first got married, until --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  --  my husband said to me the second week, "Honey --"
L:  You got to --
R:  -- we will never --
L:  -- you got to stop doing that --
R:  -- have tuna noodle --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- ca- [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- we will never have tuna --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- noodle casserole again".
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh.
L:  Wow.
R:  [COUGH] But, you know.  Yeah, as far as you know, you know that your -- your house is clean and your food is clean if you do it at home, you know.  That's -- that's --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- the bottom line --
L:  But you know what? --
R:  -- and you --
L:  -- I- I'll eat, you know --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I'll -- I'll like, pick -- I'll pick, uh, uh, a knife or something out of the dishpan and just rinse it off, you know --
R:  Oh, yeah, well --
L:  -- and use it.
R:  -- that's your --
L:  But that's --
R:  -- germs.
L:  -- at home.  That's -- that's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, this is my house.  But, like, you know, who knows what Chong's doing in the back of the -- the restaurant --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, with his --
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- picking his nose, you know, with the Chinese --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- chopsticks or something, you know, and --
R:  Uh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- stir frying something in the wok, and you know, who knows what -- you know.
R:  Oh.
L:  Other people's hair, that's the worst. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, oh yeah.
L:  I'd have to -- I'd have to, you know, get on all the cooks, man.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, if I -- if I lived anywhere, I'd be like, you know, "You're going to have to shave the head" or you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- something --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because, you know.  That is like the worst.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  That's -- that's bad --
L:  That's sick.
R:  -- but, you know --
L:  Even at my own house, other people's hair -- my family -- just -- I'm like, "No". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  It's out of control --
R:  -- there are worse things.  I mean, you know about -- you remember those Kentucky Fried Chicken, where they pulled out the chicken head? [LAUGH].  They had cooked --
L:  Ugh.
R:  -- a chicken head [LAUGH].  Oh, God.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I bet -- I bet they got sued.
R:  It was in --
L:  Nobody --
R:  -- somebody's -- in somebody's barrel of chicken.
L:  You know what?  I bet everybody talking at this, uh --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- talking about this topic --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I bet you, none of them want to live at, uh, Kentucky Fried Chicken.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I wouldn't.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, maybe if you're black or something, but, I mean ...
R:  No.
L:  You know.
R:  No.
L:  Even if you're black.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, no.
R:  No.  But you know, chicken itself too, gets old.  Even though you can cook it a thousand ways --
L:  You know what? --
R:  -- it gets old.
L:  -- that -- that is true.  
R:  You know.
L:  That is true, man.  I can't -- I can't eat chicken day in, day out and ...
R:  No, not every day.
L:  It- it's kind a -- I don't know.  But, y- you know.  You got to eat something though, right?
R:  Right.  Well, you know, most people cook a lot of chicken at home, so, when they do go out ...
