L:  Hi, I'm Rita. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi, I'm Grace.
L:  Hi, Grace. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi.
L:  [SIGH] Um, this is the first time I've done this. [LAUGH]
R:  Me too.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, it should work out the same for both of us [LAUGH].  Um, I like eating at home more than fast foods.  What about you?
R:  Did they say fast food or just regular eating out?
L:  Oh, I was thinking fast foods, so, I'm not sure what they --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- said.
R:  -- okay.
L:  Eating out, I like to do once in a while, you know, for something special. [SIGH] But, for the most part, I like eating home.
R:  Ah.  
L:  What about you? [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I love, you know, like a six course meal that someone is cooking for me, whether that be at a restaurant or at, um, a dinner party, but, um, I love to be cooked for, so --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I love restaurants -- good restaurants -- not many -- there aren't that many good [LAUGH] restaurants that --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- where, you know, like a really nice restaurant with great, um -- like with different courses and different things in them, sampling, whether it be ethnic foods or, you know, with good wine --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- that's fun. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's -- I like that as --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- something special --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- definitely.
L:  You know, that's what I meant by, "Yeah, I like going out to the restaurant for something special" [SIGH], um, but for day to day, I usually just make it at home, you know.
R:  Right.  Oh yeah, definitely.
L:  What's your favorite meal?
R:  Um, well, it depends on the time of, uh -- it depends on, uh, I guess, the season or the mon- -- the part of the month, um, sometimes I love fillet mignon with, um, you know, like a nice selection of vegetables and, you know, like a nice, um, meal, or, um, sometimes it's like something really -- like a really elegant pasta.  My favorite is probably -- which I haven't had in a long time, because I have to make it, tri colori raviolettis, in like a pink sauce.  That's one of my --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- favorites.
L:  -- what is that?  I'm not familiar with that.
R:  Um, it's like small ra- -- the raviolettis are really like, uh, mini sized, um, raviolis, and they're hand --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- made, and, um, tri colori, like there are three different colors, so, it's like white, orange and green.  So, the green is spinach with ricotta --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- the white is just ricotta with Parmesan cheese and stuff, and then the orange is like, um, [LIPSMACK] pureed butternut squash with crushed amoretti cookies and stuff.  They're really good. [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Oh, okay.  I -- I think I knew what [NOISE] that was, but I didn't know what it was --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- called --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] So --
R:  Oh, it's Italian -- I'm Italian, so ...
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH] It kind of --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- works out that way.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  Those are really good.  All of them are.
R:  Yum.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My -- my kids, uh, never liked anything different, you know.
R:  Oh, yeah, I bet.
L:  So, I'd make it for me [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and I'd try to get them to taste it, you know.
R:  So, it's like the basic chicken stuff, is that what your kids like?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  They're all grown now though.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, uh, but when they were at home -- I had seven children, so --
R:  Oh, my --
L:  -- uh, when it came to --
R:  -- God --
L:  -- food, I didn't --
R:  -- you're a baby factory. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  When it --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- came to food, I made those, uh, one dish meals or something, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I would think so.
L:  Or the basics, you know.
R:  Did you have help?
L:  Oh, yeah.  They helped, they helped.
R:  Oh, the kids helped?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you didn't have like someone helping you out?
L:  Oh, no.
R:  That kind of --
L:  No.
R:  -- help.
R:  Oh --
L:  -- no.
R:  -- my gosh.
L:  When the --
R:  Seven -- God bless you.  That's a lot of work.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I mean --
L:  Well, when they're
R:  -- well, how do you --
L:  -- older --
R:  -- get interesting?
L:  When the older ones were younger, I did it all, but when they got older and then I had the younger ones, [SIGH] they helped a lot.  They helped tremendously.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, there wasn't as much problem.  Then I turned my attention to making my own chocolates and things like that --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- for Easter and things for, um -- so, now --
R:  Oh, that's fun --
L:  -- now, I'm just here by myself with my kitty cat [LAUGH], so, it's a whole lot different. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my gosh, so, you're --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like, serious emptiness.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.  So, now, what's cooking like for you?
L:  Well, I -- I still like -- I -- I can make those meals that I couldn't make then, you know, so, it's really an adventure.
R:  Oh, so, now it's funner?
L:  Right.
R:  You're having fun.
L:  Right.  Like, I like some -- some oriental dinners, you know, like, um --
R:  Oh, you like --
L:  -- mandarin chicken salad.
R:  Mm.
L:  I like to make that, and, um, the stir fry with, uh, the sweet and sour sauce and the peppers and the carrots and snap peas, you know, and stuff like that.  Only now, I'm also -- I have high cholesterol, so, now [SIGH] I'm using tofu too.
R:  Oh, good.  Low fat tofu?
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right --
R:  -- 'cause --
L:  -- and I really -- I like it.  I enjoy it and I'm also, uh, I'm drinking, uh, rice milk or soy milk.
R:  Yeah, that's good.  I like that stuff.
L:  Yeah, I do too, and see, I couldn't drink regular milk before --
R:  Oh, so, this is better.
L:  -- so, yeah.  So, this is better for me, and it -- it's more expensive, but for the amount I drink, you know, I usually have it like in cereal in the morning, you know, oatmeal or something [SIGH] and, uh, you know, I don't drink just glasses.  I can't do that [LAUGH], so [SIGH], uh, but I like it, you know, for what I use it for, so ...
R:  Right.  Mm, so, it doesn't --
L:  So, it doesn't bother me to pay the extra price, 'cause I'm not having to use a gallon a day, you know. [LAUGH] [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  So -- so --
R:  Exactly.  I think you can buy, um, well, certain types of rice and soy milks at, um, like Cosco and stuff, like in the big quantities --
L:  Yeah, yeah --
R:  -- nowadays.
L:  -- I haven't went there yet, but, um, I just started doing that with the rice milk and the -- I started with soy milk [SIGH] and then I was reading the packages, and I saw that rice milk gave the same benefits, but they gave you more vitamins [SIGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so, I figured --
R:  Got more packed into it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Soya's good for, um, reducing risks in cancers -- are really good --
L:  Right.
R:  Soya's good for all sorts of things too, so, it's like -- I do both -- actually I give my dog soy milk twice a day.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.  He gets soy milk with flaxseed oil.  Flaxseed oil's a great way to low- lower your cholesterol naturally, and oat bran is also another way to naturally lower your cholesterol, and oat bran is like the most perfect food.  It's like, if you, you know, cook it in the morning instead of oatmeal, it's, um, has higher fibre and has more, um, protein in it, and it's also -- it helps to lower cholesterol and, um, [LIPSMACK] flaxseed oil and omega oils, they lower your cholesterol naturally, so, um, yeah, there's ways to -- to like help yourself, you know --
L:  Lower ...
R:  -- naturally.
L:  Right, and because she --
R:  -- without seeking ...
L:  Yes, she asked me if I wanted to take any kind of medication for it, and I said, "Oh, no.  If I can do this myself ..."
R:  Oh, good for you.
L:  You know, I d- -- I didn't --
R:  That's a big deal.  Most people just want to go right away and --
L:  Go with a pill.
R:  -- [inaudible].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, of course.
L:  I'd rather not.  I hate taking pills, so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  What was your name again?
R:  Grace.
L:  Grace, okay.  
R:  Yeah, definitely.  I mean, that's funny 'cause most people are like, "Oh, yeah, as long as I can keep eating the way I want to" and you know --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it's like mm, I don't know.  Some people like my brother I think was on it for a little while, and he's a slim guy, eats well, if he just happens, you know, we don't -- we have heart disease in our family, so, he went on it, and he needed to, but there are other people that -- I had a friend's husband who, you know, he could easily have just altered his diet --
L:  Right.
R:  -- without having to go on drugs, you know, but he --
L:  Right.
R:  -- didn't want to do that, so, he went on the ...
L:  And you know, it really doesn't take that much, if you just read the ingredients --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, and some people, it's hard to change a whole lot of things at once.  With me, it's, you know, [SIGH] with liking oriental food, for one thing, there's not a major problem there, you know. [SIGH] Uh, but, for some people, they need to change a little at a time, you know, wait til they get --
R:  Right.
L:  -- used to one change, then add another change.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, but, if they do, you know, th- -- and they're successful that way, that's a better way to be successful with eating, you know, different types of foods, [SIGH] because some people, if you change it --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- all at once, it'll work for a little while, but then they're right back to the same grind, you know. [SIGH]
R:  Exactly.  Yeah, you definitely have to, uh, keep it together, I mean, and really know what you're doing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, no question about it.  I mean, there are so many, um -- there are so many ways that you can, you know, help your body, so --
L:  Right, by the right foods --
R:  -- without having to do -- yeah --
L:  -- instead of having to take pills. [LAUGH]
R:  -- lose weight --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I mean, sometimes --
L:  You know.
R:  -- all it takes is just losing five or ten pounds --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you don't have to lose a lot of weight to see --
L:  Right.
R:  -- huge results in your body.
L:  [SIGH] And sometimes it's not even the weight, like you said, your brother's  --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- slim --
R:  -- he is.
L:  -- but the cholesterol doesn't matter --
R:  No.
L:  -- if you're heavy or slim --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, but there's easy ways to lower it without medication, you know, [SIGH] and just changing your foods --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know. [SIGH] Um, you mentioned that you like, um, you know, to go out to eat and stuff.  Do you do that every day?
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  It's for special too?
R:  I cook, yeah.  I cook at home.  Actually, I made a -- I just made -- I love like turkey chillis and stuff, but yesterday I made a turkey bolognese, so, it's like, um -- I'm really not supposed to eat a lot of tomato, but I'm Italian, so, who can help it?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um --
L:  That's like, uh, a sin, man [LAUGH], having been unable to eat tomato when you're Italian. [LAUGH]
R:  I know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I agree.  I'm like, "Oi, how can you do that?" and, uh, yeah, 'cause I just, um -- I'm kind of going with like a more all natural [inaudible] kind of approach to eating, kind of, you know, balancing your body type, so, that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, you, um, eat ...
