R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi [LAUGH].
R:  H- hi, I'm Lawrence Cummings.
L:  I'm Cassandra Cox.
R:  Okay.
L:  How are you?
R:  Fine.  You?
L:  Good, good.  [NOISE] [SIGH] Um, so, food [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Right --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so, food, uh, uh, whether -- whether you enjoy eating at a restaurant or at home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh --
L:  What [NOISE] -- what about you?
R:  Well, you know, I enjoy -- if it's -- if it's what I like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, I enjoy it both places --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know.  I mean, I could -- I could eat at a restaurant if it's something that I really like, uh --
L:  Right [NOISE].
R:  -- and, uh, and really enjoy.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  Uh, I -- I enjoy sitting down at a restaurant, you know. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I like, enjoy going out doing that some time rather than sit at home.
L:  Yeah, yeah [NOISE].
R:  Uh, and, uh, but some time I like to be at home.
L:  Right.
R:  Right.
L:  Right, yeah --
R:  How about you?
L:  -- me too.  I, uh, you know, it depends on the mood I'm in [NOISE].  Sometimes I really like to cook a lot, so I'll, you know, go for a couple of weeks and just like make a lot of [NOISE] stuff at home, um --
R:  Exactly.
L:  Sometimes I definitely like to go out to eat because [NOISE] I do not need to do anything, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, uh [NOISE] --
R:  Sometimes --
L:  -- you know, restaurants always cook better [LAUGH] than I do.
R:  Exactly, well some, sometimes you get tired of eating your own cooking --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you want to go out and -- and do something, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- different, yeah --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- just -- just be in the atmosphere.
L:  Yeah, I like to try to go out once -- once every, like one to two weeks.
R:  Right.
L:  But -- [SIGH] yeah.
R:  I do the same.  Maybe some time it might be once a -- uh, once a -- a couple of times every two weeks or maybe some time once every three weeks or something like that.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And then too, you know, it's, uh, you know, I -- when I go, I like to enjoy it.  I- if anything that really turns me off, is to go and sit down and -- and pay for a meal and then I don't -- it's not what I -- you know, you order something and it -- it don't be what you expect it to be.
L:  Oh, right, right.
R:  And that -- that really is like you -- like a waste of money.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  That is -- that is hard -- that's hard to --
R:  Yeah, it is --
L:  -- deal with.  
R:  -- it really is.
L:  What do you like to order?
R:  Uh, well, you know, I --
L:  Or eat?
R:  -- I like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I like, uh -- I like salads really.  I like salads and then I like, uh, uh, well, I like chicken.  I try to lay off, uh, meats a lot --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Some time I just go like vegetables --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, uh, an entree or something, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  But, uh, basically I'm not really hard to please.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm not hard to please.  I mean, if the food is cooked right --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and good and, uh, uh, I like meat loaves --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, uh, I don't -- I'm not a steak person.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  Um, I -- you know, I like [LAUGH] unfortunately I -- I like a lot of fried food.
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Um, I -- I shouldn't and, uh, I do love salad.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I -- I'm not much of a meat person either.  I love chicken though --
R:  Right, yeah, I like chicken.
L:  -- so --
R:  Chicken and fish.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I like steak once in a while, but it has to be cooked perfectly, and it's got to be from a good -- like the Outback has good steak.
R:  Yeah, they do.
L:  But --
R:  They do.
L:  Yeah, n- not too often.
