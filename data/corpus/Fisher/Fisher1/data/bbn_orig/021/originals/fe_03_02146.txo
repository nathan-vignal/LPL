R:  [NOISE]
L:  Freda.
R:  Ah, Gerry. [NOISE]  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  [NOISE] H- --
L:  So, are we supposed to be talking [NOISE] about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, if we like to eat in a restaurant versus a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- home.
R:  [NOISE] Yes.
L:  Um, I usually like a restaurant 'cause I get kinda lazy 'cause I raised [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- four children.  Two of them are still [SIGH] young, but I've cooked --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- almost twenty --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- years now.
R:  Wow.
L:  So I would really like to, [SIGH] you know, eat in a restaurant.  And I was thinking about Mothers' Day, but it gets so busy on Mothers' Day.  How about yourself?
R:  [SIGH] Yes, I, um, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I like eating at restaurant --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- bec- 'cause, you know, I have a couple of young ones myself --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and [NOISE] -- and, you know, it gets tiring just meal after meal, you know, planning and preparing [NOISE].  But, um, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, the thing that turns me off about it is the crowds now.  It seem like --
L:  Lot of people, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  The more restaurants they put up [NOISE] the more crowded it gets.
L:  It gets very crowded.  And another thing is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if you have children, you know, and -- and it's a long wait, you have to find something occupy them --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- with.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So I really like when they give the crayons and stuff.  It's not -- my kids are like kinda bad. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And that brings a lot of attention to the table and everything. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, but eating at home has a lot -- y- yo- you -- [NOISE] sometimes eating at home has a -- you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- has its good things because you can relax more, [NOISE] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you don't have to be on your best behavior.  And, um, sometimes the food is cheaper, like you go and get a whole bunch of crab legs for cheaper than you could buy in a restaurant.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  So, sometimes, you know, like a -- a restaurant is, um, [NOISE] gets expensive, but then, you know, it's nice for -- you to buy things that you normally wouldn't eat at home too.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  How -- do know how long we're supposed to talk for?
R:  Ah, I think --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it says ten minutes.
L:  Okay, do they stop us --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- after?
R:  Yeah, yeah, it -- there will be a tone and they'll stop.
L:  I'm sorry, this is my first [NOISE] time. [NOISE]
R:  Mm.
L:  [COUGH] So, yeah, if you [NOISE] eat at a restaurant what kind do you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- usually like to eat at?
R:  Ah, [SIGH] I like the [SIGH] ...  I like the, ah, mid -- mid priced, you know, family restaurants.
L:  Yeah, that's the best.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They just have a new restaurant opening up, I think Olive Garden, that's supposed to be nice.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah.  Oh Olive Garden gets very crowded.
L:  [MN] Oh, it gets very crowded.
R:  Oh, yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah we were just talking about the Outback and someone was telling me, at work today, how crowded that gets.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  So I told my husband it would be nice to go there again, we haven't been there in a while, but ...
R:  Mm.
L:  Now they have these new beeper things now at restaurants.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Where they can beep you when it's your turn to go[?].
R:  Mm. [SIGH]
L:  You know, eating at home [MN] -- but, you know, there is -- you get cheaper food when you buy it in bulk, like a whole mess[?] of crab legs and stuff.
R:  [MN] Mm.  [SIGH] Well I -- I like eating at home because of, [MN] y- you know, [NOISE] you know, we -- we call it an outing.  We go ahead and bring the food into the -- the rec room or the living room, or whatever --
L:  Oh, and pretend --
R:  -- and spread out and --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- you know.
L:  -- like a picnic and everything?
R:  Yeah. [MN] 
L:  Oh, that's kinda neat.
R:  And that -- [MN] you know, I kind of enjoy that even more because, you know, you don't have to wait.  [SIGH] Then, you know, you [NOISE] could sit out the couch or, you know, what -- lay on the floor, do whatever you want.
L:  Okay.
R:  [SIGH] And, you know, you don't have to worry about the kids running around [NOISE] and ...
L:  You're right.
R:  [SIGH] You know, they could do what they want. [NOISE] [SIGH] B- --
L:  Yeah, that -- that's what's nice.  And also, unfortunately, you know, like most families now, [NOISE] I don't know h- -- your family, but we don't sit at the table like we should, mostly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know it's just that my husband likes to watch, all that sport, [NOISE] so he has a little -- [MN] coffee little thing in front of his TV.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Only on Sundays do we really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I make sure that they really eat, you know, at -- at the table.
R:  Mm.
L:  But unfortunately that's the problem.  At a restaurant you couldn't do that really.  You have to all sit at the table, and you have to -- [NOISE] and even though you try to watch, you know, a sports program it's kinda hard.  So ...
R:  Mm.
L:  That's another advantage of eating at home.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- one good thing is at the restaurant we used to get the -- get to, um, you know, have everybody sitting in the one space, and have everybody's undivided attention.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- that's a big difference.  So the medium price is nice.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  But have you ever just gone without the kids, just you and your significant --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --other, or ...?
R:  [SIGH] Huh.  W- w- -- ah, w- --
L:  Rarely.
R:  Yeah, when we get the chance we do.  Yeah, sometimes like, say if [SIGH] um -- well, [MN] one is in school and one's not.  So --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know. [SIGH] Ah, when t- -- when the baby was really a baby and there wasn't too much of a problem.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  And we'd go somewhere during the day. [NOISE]
L:  Okay.
R:  You know, maybe like to a IHOP or something, you know, for brunch. [NOISE]
L:  Okay.
R:  And, you know, that was [MN] relaxing, you know, it's a change.
L:  Yes, breakfast is a good time to go.
R:  Mhm. [SIGH]
L:  Ah, we don't go enough.  I -- I think that's -- that's a good -- good thing.  We were just talking about that.  IHOP or something to go for breakfast.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH]--
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Just get a little break on the weekends or something.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] And we almost have a tradition, it's like every Christmas morning [SIGH] you know --
L:  You go for breakfast?
R:  Yeah, we buy -- open the presents and then it's like, "Okay, let's go to IHOP". [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Well I often think that, um, the problem is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- eating at home you get --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- deliver a lot, on a Thursday or a Friday, 'cause I refused to cook, so we get deliver a lot.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, you know, that's the pizza.  The pizza, or the hot wedges or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So that's kind of [NOISE] thing, eating at home but eating at a restaurant kinda like, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  I think they cut us off now.  Are we done now do you think?
R:  [MN] No, you'll hear it.  It -- it [NOISE] --
L:  Oh, you've done this before?
R:  Yeah.  They actually -- I had a call Friday. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay I never did this before, so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm at work- -- I wouldn't l- -- but I did it anyway. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  [SIGH] [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah but the delivery at h- home is good, you can have a little restaurant in your house. [LAUGH]
R:  Yep. [SIGH]
L:  Do you deliver a l- -- do you get a lot of take out food?
R:  Unfortunately, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  That -- so that racks up, because twenty, twenty five dollars a pop, you know.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Sometimes if we order it though I like to order enough for t- two day, so it --
R:  Y- --
L:  -- kinda ...
R:  Yeah, that's what I like to do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, but sometimes, you know, really, i- if you sit down and -- and a- average it all out, sometimes it's really not much more expensive than if you cook.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You know, if you factor in the time that you -- that you put into it and -- [SIGH] and, you know, j- just in a lot of variables. [SIGH]  You know, it -- it -- you just have to budget.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You know, [NOISE] budget how much --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you want to spend. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, it's, um [SIGH] ...
L:  I think we went over ten min- -- you don't think so?
R:  No, 'cause it -- it'll be a -- a signal, a- --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and -- and then they'll say, okay, you have a f- few seconds to say any last comments, and then --
L:  Oh, [NOISE] okay.
R:  -- and then that.
L:  But everything got so [NOISE] expensive though.
R:  [MN]
L:  Like the wine and everything --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- glass of wine and ...
R:  [NOISE]  Mhm.
L:  Depends upon the place you go.  Some places a glass of wine is enough for two people.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, and -- and then that -- that's okay but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  And a lot of places have, um, -- I don't know whether there's a lot of places give you a really good [NOISE] proportion where you could, you know, have doggie bags, that's really good.
R:  [SIGH] Yes.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But, um, I haven't been to, um, [MN] what's that place?  Country Buffet recently, have you?
R:  [MN] Yeah. [NOISE] Oh, Country Buffet, yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We go there, mm, pretty f- f- -- I would say maybe once very couple [NOISE] of months.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Um, it -- it's nice.
L:  The said they have a barbeque thing now.
R:  [NOISE] Oh. [SIGH] I'm not even sure.
L:  They have --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it like a barbeque night now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But that's a good place where we all go on -- on like, um, graduations and things like that.
R:  Do you have Golden Corral?
L:  [COUGH]  No, what is that?
R:  That -- that's another [MN] buffet type. [SIGH]
L:  Ah, no, I don't think so.
R:  Mm.  Yeah.  [MN] Picking up -- ah ... [NOISE]
L:  Where is that -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Where is that located?
R:  [SIGH]  Well, a- ah, [SIGH] from what I gather it's just up and down the East Coast.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] So I don't know how far they're branching out. [SIGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  Are you -- you on the East Coast?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, okay. [SIGH]  Yeah, so I -- yeah, I had never heard of 'em 'til, you know, they built one here.
L:  Are you on the East Coast?
R:  Yeah.
L:  All right.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I'm in, ah, Maryland.
L:  Oh, Baltimore, that's a -- they have a lot of good restaurants in Baltimore.
R:  Mm.  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's my favorite, they have, a [SIGH] -- when we were there there's some, and then --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have like the frozen -- you know it's twelve minutes don't you?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  What does your clock -- y- your clock doesn't say?
R:  No, I had -- I hadn't looked at it. [LAUGH]
L:  So -- so I'm gonna have to hang up though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you think we'll -- it's all right?
R:  Yeah, I'm not t- t- -- I don't know what [SIGH] -- I mean the last time, well I guess [SIGH] the one I talked to seemed like he was a- -- seemed like he worked at University of Penn --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and, um ...
L:  [NOISE] Well, it says twelve minutes and fifty one seconds so I have to go.  Y- [MN] 'cause I'm on a p- -- ah, I'm at work.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  But, I'll call them and tell them because we ususally supposed to -- we get credit for ten minutes.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean -- yeah, and I think it's really eight minutes, but it -- I -- I guess with -- with everything it --
L:  Maybe we're just supposed to hang up on our own.
R:  I --
L:  But you said the last time you didn't.  I -- I'll f- find out.  Okay?
R:  Okay.
L:  Well, it was nice talking to you.
