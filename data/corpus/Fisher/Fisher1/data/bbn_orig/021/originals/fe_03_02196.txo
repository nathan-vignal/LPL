L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Can you hear me?
L:  Yeah, I can hear you --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- okay.
R:  Hi, this is Richard.
L:  Hi, Richard.  This is Mindy.
R:  Hi, Mindy.
L:  Hi.
R:  Okay, ah, the topic's supposed to be food, right?
L:  Food --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- yeah, yeah.
R:  Um, you wanna start?
L:  And, ah, whether we prefer eating at a restaurant or at home.
R:  Um, that's hard to s- --
L:  So how about you?
R:  It's hard to say, 'cause there's a lot of good restaurants out.  But, um --
L:  That's true, there are.
R:  -- I do like home cooking too.
L:  Yeah.  Do you cook at all?
R:  Yes, I do.
L:  Yeah, I'd -- I like to cook -- I like to cook, as well.  I like to ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- yeah, it's hard for me to say --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- too, whether it's, ah -- whether it's more fun to, you know, cook at home or to go out and eat.
R:  Right.  And sometimes you get to a restaurant and you're disappointed.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like if somebody refer a +restaurant you get disappointed --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- you didn't -- the service wasn't good, or food wasn't as good as you thought it was gonna be.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I don't like the cleaning up part.  That's what -- a- -- at home.  So I'd rather [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- rather eat out sometimes.  But sometimes you are in that kind of mood where you don't mind eating at home. [NOISE]
L:  That's true.  It's -- it's always -- it's um -- for me it's about the work, more than about um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um -- I -- I mean, I guess there's some restaurants that I like better than others, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, mostly for me, it's like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, I'll go out if I'm too tired to cook or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- something like that.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what's your favorite food?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] hm.  I'm really liking soups right now.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Um, I mean I just had, ah, ah, I really like minestrone soup, and, ah, I like tomato soup.  I guess those are just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, pretty basic soups.
R:  Mhm.  I like m- -- um, [MN] um, what's the second soup you said?
L:  Oh, tomato soup, yeah.
R:  Tomato.  I like tomato soup, but I don't like minestrone at all.  The --
L:  No, no?
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  Why's that?
R:  I don't know.  I like um, French onion soup.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  I've -- I've never had that at home, I've only had that out at restaurants.
R:  Yeah, with them, ah, mozzarella cheese on top.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's really delicious.  I love that.
L:  Yeah, that -- yeah, that can be really good.
R:  I like, um, cream of broccoli soup. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, that's -- and that's -- that's also usually better at restaurants than --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than at -- from like, a can.
R:  True.
L:  [SIGH] I never really make soups from scratch, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE]
R:  Well --
L:  More about, ah --
R:  Another favorite food of mine is macaroni and cheese.  I love that. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  That's usually better at home than at restaurants.
L:  Definitely.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Definitely.  I don't think restaurants are really, usually equipped to make macaroni and cheese --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- quite right.
R:  That's a really hard recipe to um, conquer.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Do -- do you make macaroni and cheese at all?
R:  Yes, I do. [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.  Wow, yeah.
R:  I love to make it, too.
L:  Do you make it with lots of -- lots of milk, or more cheese?
R:  Not a lot of milk.  Just enough milk to make it moist [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And [MN] cheese, of course.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Sharp cheese, um, a little salt and pepper, um, [NOISE] -- a lot of people, like --my grandmom -- my great grandmom, she used canned milk [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I don't like to use canned milk.  I don't like --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- the taste after it's cooked.  I like to use regular milk.
L:  Is that evaporated milk, then?
R:  Yeah, evaporated milk.
L:  Mm.
R:  My grandmom used to use --
L:  I don't think I've ever tried to do it.
R:  You can definitely taste the difference.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's good, but it -- it's better with [NOISE] regular milk.
L:  Yeah.  I know that I've used evaporated milk in -- in cakes.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm.
L:  I'm not really sure why that's [SIGH] -- I -- I guess I've really -- not -- never really known what the difference is between --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- evaporated milk and regular milk, but ah --
R:  Yeah, I don't understand why they're different, either, but they are different.  And th- -- the evaporated milk it thicker --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- for one, and the color's different.  It's like a [NOISE] -- like a tan, almost.
L:  And they smell really different, right?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Yes. [NOISE]
L:  Do you ever drink soy milk?
R:  [NOISE] Say it again.
L:  Do you ever drink soy milk?
R:  Soy milk?
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, I've never tried it.
L:  Yeah, it's -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's um, it kind of smells a little bit, I think -- maybe it looks a little more like --
R:  Evaporated.
L:  -- evaporated milk, but it's just made out of soya beans.  I don't know.
R:  Hm, I might just try that.  Is it good for people that's lactose intolerant?
L:  Yeah, it is.  It's a --
R:  Oh.  Yeah, that's -- that's right.  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's a good substitute milk for them, yeah.
R:  I'm gonna definitely have to try it then, 'cause I'm lactose intolerant, but I like milk [LAUGH] with cereal and [SIGH] ...
L:  That must be tough, with ah --
R:  It is. [SIGH]
L:  It's hard to have a grilled cheese sandwich, or --
R:  Mhm --
L:  All right.
R:  -- but I still do it. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.
R:  I love milk.  When -- after I eat pancakes, I love to drink milk.
L:  Mhm, mhm?
R:  Mm.
L:  Pancakes are good.  Ah, I think pancakes are better homemade I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- than --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in a restaurant.
R:  That's true.  But waffles are better out than in.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They used to get a good waffle iron, and that's so hard.
R:  Yeah, I never used a +waffle iron before.
L:  Really?
R:  No.
L:  Yeah, my -- my mom used to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- she used to have a waffle iron.
R:  Mm.
L:  She had a round waffle iron --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and -- yeah, it was good, but ah, the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know, they -- they're -- they're much more puffier, I think when you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- eat them in restaurants.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.
L:  I um, sometimes I ate pancakes in diners, um, -- guess that's the ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  That's where the disappointment comes in.  Like, especially if you order something like pancakes, you think they're going to be really good, if you're like, out at a diner or something.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Sometimes they're good and sometimes they're not. [NOISE]
L:  They usually give you, ah -- at least the one's that I've been at -- they usually give you plenty of pancakes.  That never seems to be the problem, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they always give me too many pancakes, I think.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  And they're very large. [LAUGH] Larger then you would --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- make 'em at home.
L:  That's one thing about eating out, is um, if I don't finish all the food, I feel -- I feel kind of badly about it, 'cause, you know, you've paid for all of it, and ...
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you al- -- always -- it's not always enough to take home.
L:  [SIGH] Right, yeah --
R:  To get a doggy bag for.
L:  -- if there's just a little.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, let me see. [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Um.  What else is your f- -- another favorite food?
L:  Oh, um, well, um, I really like pears.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I had some nice pears today.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Was it soft and juicy?
L:  Well, actually I like the pears to be hard, um --
R:  Yeah? Oh, me the opposite.
L:  I -- I -- how do you like them?
R:  Soft and juicy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't like the hard ones [NOISE] too much.
L:  [SIGH] Do you like to eat anything, ah, with the pears?
R:  Um, hm ... I don't think I -- maybe in a fruit salad, but --
L:  What's that?
R:  -- ah, maybe in a fruit salad.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But, I've never tried pears with anything other than in a fruit salad or my mom, she usually cans pears, or makes jelly out of pears.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's about it.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Jelly out of pears?
R:  Mhm, yep.
L:  That's great.
R:  Mhm.  It comes out dark.
L:  Yum, that sounds good. [SIGH] [NOISE]
R:  Really good. See you [inaudible].  [SIGH] And, ah, let me think what else.  I wanna -- I think, sometimes she might put some pears in a peach cobbler.  A little bit of pears in it [NOISE] to accent it a little bit.
L:  Oh, that sounds good too.
R:  Yeah, it is. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] I'll have to look up a recipe for peach cobbler, it's making me hungry.
R:  [LAUGH] And put a little bit of pears in it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that sounds really good.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And with ice cream -- that reminds me of ice cream as well.
R:  Yeah, true.
L:  I like, I mean [SIGH] -- I don't think I know anybody who doesn't like ice cream.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's so good.  Do you have a favorite flavor?
R:  Um, mint chocolate chip, I think is my favorite.
L:  Oh, my goodness, that's such a good flavor.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's one of my favorites as well.
R:  Yeah.  And I like butter pecan, also.
L:  That's pretty good too, yeah.
R:  Mhm.  'Cause I like those pecans.
L:  Definitely, definitely, yeah. [NOISE]
R:  So do you cook -- you don't cook -- do you cook a lot at home, or ...?
L:  Actually, right now, I -- I do do a lot of [SIGH] cooking at home, just 'cause it's cheaper, pretty much.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  It's -- [SIGH]
R:  You're right.
L:  It's my reasoning.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's -- I mean, it's just, um, yeah.  It's just that you have to clean up every -- every single time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which is okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I end up eating a lot of, ah -- a lot of noodles, because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they seem to be -- um, they're very filling and --
R:  Right.  And it's fast. [LAUGH]
L:  Yep. [LAUGH] And they're fast, yeah.
R:  Me, too.  I've been eating noodles a lot lately.
L:  What do you eat when you eat at --
R:  I have a lot of --
L:  -- oh, sorry.
R:  Um, it has a lot of carbs, doesn't it?  Noodles?
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's not such a sustaining food, I guess.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And some -- you get hungry again. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I should try -- try to eat more nuts or beans or something like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Beans, I'm not too big on, but I do like --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- a couple of different beans.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't like kidney beans, that much.
L:  How 'bout in chili?  Do you like them in chili?
R:  Yeah -- yeah, I like it in chili.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's what most people I know who don't like beans say out there.  They -- if they don't like them, but they like them in chili, okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  What do you make, um, when you cook at home?
R:  Um, steak, ah, like I said, noodles, or um, burgers a lot.  Like homemade -- I'll buy ground beef, and --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  -- make up my own burgers.  I like them.  I really love that, 'cause I can put green peppers in and then onions and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cheese and, you know, make it really homemade [LIPSMACK] and um ... [LIPSMACK] Let me see, what else do I usually make?  Um, I like hot dogs, and -- nothing really big, unless there's a special event.  Then I can cook a ham, or a turkey, or something like that.  But, um, [LIPSMACK] I wanna try making some l- -- lamb -- lamb chops.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I wanna try that.  And --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- [inaudible].  [NOISE] I don't like too much chicken, only chicken breasts.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And um ...
