L:  Hi, my name is Anne.
R:  Hi, I'm Paul.
L:  [LAUGH] Nice to meet you.
R:  You, too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How are you today?
L:  I'm okay.  How're you doing?
R:  I'm not too bad.
L:  That's good.
R:  So, I guess we're supposed to talk about friends.  This is kinda my first time doing this.
L:  Oh, it is?  Okay, this is my second, so --
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, you're the old veteran then.
L:  I guess so. [LAUGH]
R:  Outstanding.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, so tell me about your friends?
L:  Okay, well I would definitely say that I'm the type of person who has a few close friends rather than many acquaintances.  I tend to be slightly hesitant about making friends and, you know, I always make sure that it's somebody I'm really going to be a good friend with before, um, you know, I start to associate with them, generally anyway, so ...  How about you?
R:  Okay, well, I'm kinda the same way but I've got a fairly outgoing personality and so I do tend to -- to make acquaintances easily and then within that I have, um, oh, a small handful of people that I'm really close to.
L:  Right, okay.
R:  But uh --
L:  Yeah, no I'm definitely not that outgoing person who'll just, you know -- just start talking to people. [LAUGH] That's not me at all.
R:  No.  Ye- -- I -- you know, I haven't always been but it's one of those things that I kinda decided that I wanted in my life and so I developed that.
L:  Oh really, that's really impressive, actually because ...
R:  Oh, thank you.
L:  Yeah, that's something I wish I could do so maybe I'll start giving it a try. [LAUGH]
R:  Well it -- it's amazing to me, it's intensely gratifying that, uh, I've noticed that, as I walk down the street, if I just greet somebody with a friendly smile, maybe a nod of the head, they get a look on their face that's, well, not only surprised but sometimes relieved because I think sometimes people just expect rejection.
L:  That's actually -- yeah, that's a good point.  I found -- well, so I've lived now on the east coast and I currently live in California and I found that it is true that people are way more laid-back out west and that, you know, you can -- you can just walk down the street and have people smile at you and it is something to take note of if you -- if you're not used to it so it is -- yeah, it is surprising.
R:  I think it depends a little bit, though, on where in California you are.
L:  Okay, that's true.  So, I'm from San Diego.
R:  Oh, okay.  See, now I'm from Indiana --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I live in Indiana now but I did spend five and a half years in California --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and part of that time I was, you know, driving a school bus in east L.A.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And I discovered that --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- there people are less likely --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to be friendly in that area.
L:  Yeah, okay.
R:  But as far as friends go, I've had one best friend for twenty two years.
L:  Oh, okay, wow.
R:  And, um -- oh, and then other people in my life that I've been close to for a time and then, oh, uh, maybe we drift geographically or just kinda lose touch.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I don't know.  I've -- I'm a junior in college, right now, and I still --
R:  Yeah, you sound young.
L:  [LAUGH] Um, I had actually kind of an unusual group of friends in high school.  There were ten of us total and we just all got along so well and it's a fairly large group to call each one of them my best friends but it's completely true, they were all my best friends and we've kept in touch ever since graduation and it's still the same.  I still consider them my best friends so ...
R:  Yeah, I'm picturing Phoebe, Rachel, Monica, the whole bunch here.
L:  [LAUGH] No, not quite. [LAUGH] Little bit different but uh -- yeah, so ...
R:  Were they all -- all, um, young ladies or ...?
L:  All girls, yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, the ten of us.  We -- somehow we got named the squad.  It's not a name that we ever came up with ourselves [LAUGH] but I guess other people noticed, you know, how -- how tight we were so it was interesting.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, that's kind of cool.
L:  Yep.
R:  But, uh --
L:  So ...
R:  It'll be interesting over the next, oh, number of years to see just exactly --
L:  How close we stay.
R:  Yeah, how close you stay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I had a -- oh, I had a little group of friends like that in high school and -- and, uh, we all kind of went our separate ways.
L:  Yeah, I've always found that pretty sad actually that, you know, my parents will talk about their friends from college a lot and obviously their friends since college but I almost never heard anything about friends in high school.  So when I was in high school with this fabulous group of girls it just really scared me that I -- you know, I might not keep in touch with them as well as I planned to so we've -- we've all made a really good effort, I think.
R:  [SIGH] Well, that's cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I think the internet has changed things, too, that way.
L:  Oh yeah, definitely.
R:  But, um -- yeah, I know that -- that, well, thanks to the internet, I've recently gotten back in touch with an old friend from high school.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And discovered that we are still old friends.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's great.
L:  Mhm, no, that's cool.
R:  Of course, that was -- [MN] oh, we were friends in high school probably before you were born.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's, uh -- uh, it's interesting.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I've moved all over the country and lived in two other countries now so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- it's been a little bit hard to keep in touch.
L:  Yeah, I know.  I actually grew up part of my life in England so, um --
R:  Oh, very good.
L:  -- I had a couple of friends that I, you know -- I kept in touch with probably about ten friends from England, right as soon as we came back, and also I was ten when we moved back so, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- expectations are a little bit different but um --
R:  Sure.
L:  And I still keep in touch with one of them.  It's dwindled down to one but um -- yeah, I am still in contact with one of my friends.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  My parents keep in really good touch with the people we know over there.
R:  You do that mostly by internet?
L:  Um, no, actually.  That's all through regular mail.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.  Now that I respect because --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I can -- I can bang out an email and hit a button to send it but for me to write a letter --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- find an envelope --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- look up the address.
L:  Keep track of the address, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, get a stamp and get it to the post office.  Way too many steps for a --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  For somebody like me.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.
R:  But uh -- so, yeah, I have tremendous respect for that, that's awesome.
L:  Mhm.  It's not as good -- I don't know, I enjoy receiving actual mail, too.
R:  Oh, I bet.
L:  Yeah, but I don't know.
R:  So, with your friends, I mean, what kind of, uh -- what kind of activities?  Is it a real active go do things bunch or is it a sitting round -- sit around and talk group?
L:  Um, definitely -- [LAUGH] um, actually it's a little bit of both.  We had our share of sitting round and talking and actually one of the things that really distinguished us, this is the group from high school, we would get into the most crazy fights over trivial little things but -- and, I don't know, it -- we'd have these longstanding battles that it was -- you know, didn't change our friendship at all, just kind of a fun thing to do. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  To argue and, you know, cat fight or whatever.  But, uh -- no, we also had a lot of, um, activities that we did fairly regularly.  One of them -- whenever it rained, um, we would go to this one field near our high school and play just mud sports.  You know, mud football or mud soccer and --
R:  Oh, that's awesome.
L:  -- have a great time with that so, yeah, that was one of our things that we did whenever possible.
R:  Oh, very cool.
L:  Yep.  So, I don't know, maybe it's the fact that I kept the same friends pretty much all throughout high school that, you know, makes me more likely to -- or less likely to just branch out and try and meet new people since I had such a steady group in high school.  I don't know.
R:  I don't know, though.  Maybe it's because you're less likely to branch out and meet new people, that you had such a steady group.
L:  That I had a st- -- oh, that's true. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know, which is the cause, which is the effect?
L:  A lot of causality here. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  Mm, that's interesting.
R:  Very interesting.  Now that would be a, uh, that --
L:  Yeah, I should write my next paper on that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, what's your major?
L:  I'm actually a bi- -- uh, a biology major.
R:  Yeah, I don't know if there's a biology paper in that or not.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's right.
R:  Sociology, maybe.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  But, uh -- yeah, very interesting.
L:  Yeah, it's convenient for me right now because my roommate is definitely the type of person who, uh, will meet, you know, ten people every night she goes out so, as long as I stick with her [LAUGH] you know, I'm likely to meet a couple of people once in a while but ...
R:  Yeah, that's kind of cool.  Now do you consider yourself more of an introvert or more of an extrovert?
L:  Introvert, definitely.
R:  Definitely?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, okay. [SIGH] With all the, uh -- all the, uh, personality characteristics that go along with that?  Very detail oriented, very --
L:  Oh yes, definitely.
R:  Okay.
L:  Analytical.
R:  Okay.  Well, see now I don't know if that necessarily follows because I'm very much of an extrovert but I'm also very analytical.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hm.  For some reason I associated the two.
R:  Yeah, I'm kind of a -- oh, I don't know, I don't think of myself this way but my friends and family all tell me I'm quite the philosopher.
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH] Mm.
R:  So -- but, uh -- yeah, uh, you know, and then I enjoy a couple of really close relationships and I, you know -- I belong to a couple of groups that, uh -- yeah, we meet, we're good friends and we go our separate ways until we meet again.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's kinda neat.  You know, clubs and that kind of thing.
L:  Right, yeah, oh, that's great.
R:  But, uh --
