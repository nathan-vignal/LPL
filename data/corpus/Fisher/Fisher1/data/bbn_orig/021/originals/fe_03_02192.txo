R:  That's when I like to --
L:  -- them big meals, huh?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I like to cook for people.

R:  Yeah, it is.  It tastes really good.  I didn't think I would like it, but it tastes real good.  And that and um -- I'm a t- -- I cook turkey.  I like turkey.  But I think my favorite food is fried chicken though.  Or meat and potatoes.
L:  I was going to say the same thing.
R:  [LAUGH] Meat and potatoes first, and -- yeah, I love meat and potatoes.  I like --
L:  At least that's one of my favorite meals.  Fried chicken, though.
R:  [MN] --
L:  Ah, coleslaw, beans --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Rolls.
R:  Well, you know, I like -- the only beans I like is pork and beans. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm not crazy about beans.
L:  That's what I mean.  I like baked beans, you know.  Like you'd have at a barbeque or something.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, they're pretty good, too.  That's if they're sweet.  If it ain't sweet, I won't eat it.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah?
R:  Well, I -- I like sweet stuff.
L:  So you don't ever eat out, or just not very often.
R:  Well, once in a while --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I do.  It is very rare that I'll go to a restaurant.  Very rare.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I find that um, that Country Buffet is not bad. [LIPSMACK] I have eaten in there a couple of times.
L:  Where's this at?
R:  Um, Philadelphia.
L:  Oh. [SIGH] Don't want to worry about that.  I'm in -- I'm in Tennessee so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH] So --
R:  It -- well, it -- it's like a -- it's a you know, you -- y- you serve a buffet, everybody serve theirselves.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  As -- and you put it at one price that's like -- I think it's seven ninety nine.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you eat all you can.
L:  Yeah, I -- I know -- I know what your talking about.  I've been to a pla- -- you know, places that do that.  I just -- you were saying it like, like it was a certain place, you know. [SIGH] So, I was like, questioning where you were --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that was serving you.  And the way you -- it was just the way you said it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] See, I been to a, you know, buffet type thing before.
R:  I tried that -- they have this other place.  I forget what the name of it is and I don't like their food too much, and it -- it -- it -- nowadays you hear so much about restaurants.  So I -- I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- try to avoid them.
L:  You never can trust the people working there. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I seen on TV once where they show what people be doing when they be cooking and stuff and that makes you leary about eating in these restaurants.
L:  Yeah?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Specially these fast food restaurants.
L:  Yeah, you just never know.
R:  And the only thing I really eat is from McDonalds.  I eat the french fries.
L:  Oh?
R:  'Cause I like potatoes, but that's pretty much about it.  Oh, yeah, Red Lobster's pretty good.  I've got --
L:  What is it?
R:  Red Lobster --
L:  Yeah?
R:  That's the best --
L:  I haven't been there in a while.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I went a cou- -- I've been there a couple of times with, ah, friends of mine.  It -- it's pretty good.  But ah, the lobster, to me, tasted kinda rubbery.
L:  [LAUGH] They're probably old or overcooked.
R:  See, when we cook it, it don't taste like that.  And my father in law barbecues it, so it tastes pretty good when he does it.  But I -- I --
L:  I'd say they probably just overcooked it or something.
R:  Yeah, that's what I -- it took 'em long enough to serve it, so ... but I -- I -- I -- I'm not a fast food person.  Ah, they say all --
L:  [SIGH] Well, I said I d- -- I just do it out of convenience more than anything, you know.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, see I have a family, so I -- I tend to want to cook all the time.
L:  Oh, yeah.  That makes it easier.  See, I'm just one.
R:  Right.
L:  It's not, you know, it's hard to cook so ...
R:  It's not so bad, though --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- once you get the hang of it.
L:  Yeah, I guess I just don't want -- not so good anymore, likes, you know, when I still had a family, I -- I cooked pretty re- --
R:  Well, I believe that when you cook, somebody else supposed to wash the dishes.
L:  [LAUGH] That sounds good to me. [LAUGH]
R:  You know.  That's the way it's supposed to do it.  You cook, I wash.  If, ah, somebody else cook, I'll wash the dishes.
L:  There you go.
R:  But if I cook, I won't be the one that wash those dishes.
L:  [LAUGH] I understand that.  Feel about the same way there. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, them dishes is a trip. [LIPSMACK] 'Specially if you're like my mother.  She dirty up every dish in the house.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Ah.
L:  So, what do you put in this ah, ah, octopus salad?
R:  Well, you put octopus, shrimps, um, um -- what's it -- pimentos and olives and onions, [LIPSMACK] and the, ah, olive oil.  Um, there's something else in there.  Sason[?], this is a -- a Porto Rican ingredient.
L:  Ahah.
R:  And you put that in there.  And it tastes pretty good.  You have to try it.  It -- it -- it's -- it's --
L:  Well that sounds different.
R:  It's um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, I -- a lot of people wouldn't eat it because they know what's in it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, when you --
L:  Well, what do you do with the octopus?  Fry it, boil it?
R:  Boil it.  You boil it, and then you s- take the outside of -- like, the skin -- you take that off.
L:  Ahah.
R:  And then you just cut it up and mix it with the rest of the ingredients.  It's -- it's actually pretty good.  I didn't think I would like it, but is -- it is -- is -- is -- is a pretty good -- it's like a -- hors d'oeuvres sort of like.  Or you can use it as a salad.  But it's actually pretty good.  And I learned how to make lasagna.  [LIPSMACK] Um, it -- it -- and I love lasagna. [NOISE] And that's a pretty good meal too. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I like to try all different kind of stuff.
L:  I, ah, I'm with you there.  That's it, when I do cook, I like experimenting, trying new things.
R:  Yeah.  Coming up with your own recipe.
L:  And the -- and the difference be- -- Yeah, a- -- and different spices, you know.
R:  Mhm.  I tried that -- they have a Cajun -- but they like, hot.  It -- oh, it was all hot stuff.
L:  You don't like hot stuff?  Spicy stuff?
R:  Well, it -- oh, I like hot sauce, but that's about it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, and it just has -- it -- it needs a -- 'cause it just -- some people get heavy handed with the pepper, and that -- and that -- my stomach and pepper don't agree.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I try to avoid making hot foods, altogether.  And spa- -- I like spaghetti, stuff like that.
L:  Well, I'd say I like just about everything.  There's not too many things I don't like.  There's a couple of vegetables, and --
R:  Well, I just --
L:  -- that.
R:  -- started eating vegetables, I wasn't crazy about eating vegetables.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Some of 'em are pretty nasty, aren't they? [LAUGH]
R:  I love -- I didn't think I would like asparagus, but that's -- that's a pretty good -- it's pretty good.
L:  And you like that one, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's one of the ones I don't like.
R:  Well, I -- I didn't start eating it until recently.
L:  Well, I -- [SIGH]
R:  But there was a time when I wouldn't eat nobody's asparagus.
L:  [NOISE] That and, ah, brussel sprouts.  They're not too good either.  I don't like 'em.
R:  Yeah, I don't like brussel sprouts.  And I don't like sweet peas, either.
L:  Oh, those are all right.  I can handle those.
R:  Nah, I -- I -- I -- m- my grandmother --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- used to make me eat that stuff, that ah, p- -- ah, peas and they make soup with the ham chunks and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, man, I wasn't crazy about that.
L:  What about sweet potatoes?
R:  I love sweet potatoes.  I like a s- -- I could eat sweet potatoes all day.
L:  Oh, I ain't too wild about those either. [SIGH]
R:  Well, they pretty good.
L:  People make the --
R:  I don't like the, ah -- the pumpkin.  But I like the sweet potatoes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm not --
L:  My own people make them with all that stuff in it, you know the marshmallow and the nuts and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's all right then, I guess, but --
R:  Yeah.  It's sweet -- it's gotta be sweet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I get that sweet tooth every once in a while.  And like, once a month, I get this really crazy sweetsies.  And I'll eat up chocolate like it's nobody's business.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And see you do, my face'll break all out 'cause I gone and ate all that chocolate, but I ge- -- I -- I just -- it happens to me once a month.  That I have to have me some chocolate.

R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Chocolate ice cream.  Chocolate cake.
L:  Mm.
R:  Hm.
L:  There you go.
R:  That -- that's me.  I used to -- I used to weigh a ton, 'cause I used to eat so much junk food.  I'd get cakes and ice cream, stuff like that, but I don't eat that like I used to.  I -- I -- I've learned that, ugh, food don't agree with me. [LIPSMACK] And then I have to eat a lot of vegetables because I've -- I have ba- -- ah, low iron, and I can't take iron pills, so I eat a lot of, like, ah, broccoli has a lot of ah, iron in it they tell me, and spinach.
L:  I like broccoli now.  That's good.
R:  So, I like the broccoli with the cauliflower.
L:  That's good too.
