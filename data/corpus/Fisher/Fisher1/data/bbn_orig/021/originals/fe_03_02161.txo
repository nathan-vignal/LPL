R:  [SIGH] If you do it really slowly [NOISE] it is so delicious.
L:  Hm.
R:  Uh, just sliced, uh [NOISE], like in half -- peaches.  You have to do it really slowly, so -- if you do it -- if you grill them from the bottom [NOISE], you could put a little butter in the -- where you take the pit out, and it is so unbelievably good.  Uh, pineapple --
L:  Right.
R:  -- grilled pineapple, just sliced in half [SIGH] --
