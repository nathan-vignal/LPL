L:  I'm Janelle.
R:  Hi, I'm Chris. [NOISE] So, friends. [NOISE]
L:  Friends. Huh. [LAUGH]
R:  Who's your most --
L:  Um, hm.  What exactly about friends are we supposed to be talking about?  I don't know.
R:  I don't -- actually, I don't know, um, I may say my friends tend to get me into trouble lot of times.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't really have a lot of friends.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- I -- I -- I tend to keep [SIGH] my circle of friends to a select few.
R:  Mm.
L:  I might have acquaintances but I don't really have a lot of friends.
R:  Mm.
L:  I don't know, I find that a lot of times [SIGH] uh, friends, uh -- it causes problems to have a whole lot of friends because people have certain expectation levels [NOISE] and -- and you can't [NOISE] fulfil them and meet those expectation levels and then you find yourself in a lot of headache and heartache so it's easier just to have a couple.
R:  Oh, sure.  Yeah, I have, uh, -- and they're divided up into two groups of friends that I go out with but don't really get along with each other so --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, man.
R:  -- I've ended up, you know, dividing my Saturdays, like, you know, two Saturdays with one group out of each month and then two Saturdays with the other group out of each month and [SIGH] oy, it's insane.
L:  Mm.
R:  But actually I really only usually only have like one or two really good friends, like my roommate than, like you said, acquaintances.
L:  Mm, yeah. [SIGH]
R:  Makes it a lot easier.
L:  Yeah, I think so, too.  Uh, uh, the other thing, too, is, I mean, who has really ti-  -- it -- it takes time to maintain friendships. [NOISE]
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] In -- in between work and [NOISE] -- and I'm married and I have kids and I just don't have the time to devote to friendships like I used to.
R:  Mm.
L:  I -- you know, to go out and socialize and I -- I don't really find that I have the time to do a lot of those things.
R:  Mm.
L:  And my friendships are pretty much, you know, relegated to telephone friendships or work friendships --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- not really the friendships that I had, maybe, when I was, you know, younger in my twenties.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ...
R:  Mm.  I find that another problem is, you know, I'm living in L.A. and it's really hard to have friends in L.A. 'cause a lot of people are just, I don't know, non reliable.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, it's hard to get a -- a decent yes or no answer out of anybody or it's, you know, "Let's go out.  Let's get together on Friday?"  "Okay, yeah, sure.  We're getting together on Friday."  And, of course, Friday rolls around and, "Oh, I'm sorry, you know, something came up, I'm busy, blah blah blah blah blah".
L:  Mm.  So --
R:  It's kind of --
L:  Yeah, I guess.  So, you -- you find yourself  -- you -- you -- you set aside time for friends and then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the friends aren't there.
R:  Yeah.  Really I guess LA's not, like, a friendly kind of place, I guess.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  Too many people looking to get ahead and -- or looking for the next best thing.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Mm, that's funny 'cause my job, I have dealings with some, you know, people in L.A. and I [SIGH] -- I think of all the pl- -- all the -- I -- I support the entire country for what I do and I think of all the places that the -- the -- the -- the, um, people with whom I tend to speak, you know, on a regular basis, I -- I -- I would tend to agree with you.  L.A., the -- the people are the least -- it's not that they're not friendly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's that they're just very superficial.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's, you know --
L:  And very, like, "Okay, yeah".
R:  -- what can you do for me?
L:  "Well, that's enough now and, you know, I -- I've -- I've gotten, you know, what I need from you so, uh, I'm moving on now and bye bye", so that's -- hm.  There's a-- there's a lot of tr- -- I guess there's some -- some truth to it to be said about, you know, your comments and like, they go, yeah -- you deal with people in the midwest and the people in the south.  People in the south are going to talk your ear off forever.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, people in the -- in the midwest, like, when I've gone on business trips and actually met them, they're very warm and friendly and, like, really glad to have finally met, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- put a face to the na- -- you know, to the name or what have you but, um -- hm -- that must be hard then?
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  Are you originally from ...?
R:  No, I'm originally from Oregon, Portland.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.
R:  So, I'm used to, I don't know -- and I do -- I do pick up a lot of acquaintances 'cause, you know, I go -- go to the bars and, um, you know, no smoking inside in L.A. so you just sit out on the patio and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, for six hours and just have -- claim a table for myself and have coupla chairs there and people just come and sit down and talk and, you know, it's like -- I guess I know a lot of people but -- you know, a lot of acquaintances but very few friends.
L:  Hm. [NOISE] That must be rough.
R:  Mm. [MN]
L:  You have a lot of family where you are?
R:  Yeah.  Well, no, no, my family's still up in Oregon.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, you know, I call and talk, you know, two, three -- two, three times a week, usually.
L:  That must make it kinda rough.  So, obviously you're not ma- -- you're not married?
R:  No.
L:  And don't have kids?
R:  Don't plan on it, at least not for quite a while.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah it's -- it's work but it's -- it grounds you, if nothing else.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  But, you know, you -- I -- I think once you get married, too, though, your friends tend to -- I don't know.
R:  Yeah, well, jeeze, it's a little dynamic.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Like you're friends because of your kids, generally.
R:  Mhm.
L:  With your -- you know what I mean?
R:  Mm.
L:  Like with other couples, like, you know, your -- your activities kinda tend, you know -- sur- -- you know, surround your kids' activities --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like you know, I -- I might -- the friends I have now, some of the friends I've -- I've met through my kids', you know, soccer.
R:  Yep.
L:  You know, so, like, and then, you know, we just kind of hooked up and, like, you know, we -- we socialize, you know, from there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But that's -- that was how I met them, otherwise I wouldn't have -- I wouldn't have met them, so --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, you -- I think you can broaden your -- your circle of friends --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, once you actually, believe it or not, settle down. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, then I'm sure -- I'm sure, you know, bar friends aren't the most reliable people to be in with, you know.
L:  Mm, mm, no, no, no. [MN] And then I was in the army, too, so I have a lot of friends from when I was in the service.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I don't know.  Hopefully, you'll -- you'll find more meaningful, lasting relationships but even when you do, you still, you know -- I don't know, I still don't find it the best policy to have, you know, a whole bunch of friends.  It's just --
R:  Mm.
L:  It's very taxing.
R:  Yes, mm.
L:  Very taxing.
R:  And expensive.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, a lot of people don't think of it as expensive but, you know, when you have to go out with these people and you're --
L:  Well, and there are birthdays and holidays and weddings and, you know, it just, you know, it does add up.  I -- I, you know, on a -- on a -- on a monthly, if not sometimes, I guess, when you go out frequently, weekly basis --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it can be -- it can be just --
R:  Just going out week nights and then, you know, just going for a cup of coffee nowadays at Starbucks is five bucks.
L:  I know, I couldn't believe that.  I went -- [SIGH] -- you know, I -- I -- I work in Philly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, there's a couple coffee places I frequent and I went with my girlfriend and I said, "Oh well, come on, let's go to Starbucks instead" and [LAUGH] I'm like, "Oh, I'll treat" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I buy her a cup of coffee and it's like nine bucks [LAUGH].  I'm like, "Jesus, for two cups of coffee?" [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  That is crazy.  Hey guys. [LAUGH] So ... Oh, hanging around. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  See, there -- there's a friend right now. [LAUGH] So, how much longer are we supposed to talk?
R:  Um, I think probably about three more minutes.
L:  Three more minutes?  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I put dinner in, uh, for eight minutes right when the phone call started so ...
L:  But -- oh, oh, okay. [NOISE] This is actually my first phone call.
R:  Same here.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 'Cause it's called a coupla times and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know, [LIPSMACK] I haven't been around or I've asleep or what have you.
R:  Mm.
L:  So -- 'cause this is late, this -- it's ten -- ten twenty here --
R:  It's just seven -- seven ten here.
L:  So it's like seven, yeah, where you are, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  No, I was just --
L:  Is it still light out?
R:  Yep.
L:  Yeah, oh.
R:  It was actually funny.  My roommate picked up the phone and so I missed all the, uh, push -- push the buttons so I was, like, closed my eyes and hit number one and hope I guessed right.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Huh!
R:  Luckily I did.
L:  Mm.
R:  But --
L:  It's pretty -- I thought it would be -- I don't know, I -- I -- I like to participate in, like, surveys and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- stuff like that, I don't know.
R:  Yeah, we've got a lot of focus groups in L.A.  We -- I try to get along to some of them.
L:  [NOISE] I just think it's helpful.  I -- I guess 'cause of what I do, too.
R:  Mm.
L:  I -- I'm in advertising and sales and marketing and I just know how much they rely on, you know what I mean, stuff like this so --
R:  Yeah.
L: -- I just always find it, you know, interesting to participate in stuff like this.
R:  Mm, it doesn't hurt, you know.
L:  No.
R:  Ten minutes.
L:  No, ten minutes, ten bucks, okay, sure. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Whatever. [LAUGH]
R:  It's better than a kick in the head.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so ... [NOISE] So what do you do?
R:  I'm an actor.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  In the business, yeah.  Not going too good, right now's the tough part of the year when everything's going on break, summer break.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So like all the TV shows and everything are -- are breaking for the summer.
L:  That's right, that's right.
R:  Work's getting scarce.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, this is kind of nice.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  A little extra thirty bucks.
L:  Yeah, oh man, that's right, I didn't think of that.  What's the -- it's -- it's like -- I  -- I wish everything was kinda like that.  Like I wish I could just take a summer break. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And just, like, not work for the summer.
R:  [MN]
L:  'Cause you're kind of programmed to do that from school.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, you -- you -- you're kinda programmed to have off the summer.
R:  Mm.  Wouldn't it be nice to able to make enough money to work --
