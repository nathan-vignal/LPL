R: Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Shirley.
L:  I'm Marilyn, from Florida.
R:  I'm talking from Ohio.
L:  Oh, okay.  Born there.
R:  Were you?
L:  Yes, I was.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, boy.
L:  Yes, in Akron.  Recently moved from Michigan.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm from Cincinnati.  If you were around Cincinnati, I was gonna ask you if you knew of any good restaurants that you could recommend. [LAUGH]
L:  No, we're not.  No -- no. [LAUGH] To go right along with the topic, huh?
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  So -- so d- did they ask us what, to describe our perfect meal?
R:  Yes.  What's your perfect meal? [SIGH]
L:  Um. [LIPSMACK] Well, sometimes it's at home and sometimes it's to go out.  That depends, on --
R:  Do you cook?
L:  Pardon?
R:  Do you cook?
L:  Not very often.
R:  Me, neither. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My perfect meal is somebody else fixing it, whether it's at home or in a restaurant. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, my husband does most of the cooking.  So -- and we're retired.  So ... but there are times that I could say I have a perfect meal at home, and there's a time when I go out and have a perfect meal. [SIGH] And I guess, to describe it -- it would be um, a quiet restaurant, not a lot of noise, um, glass of wine, and probably prime rib would be my first choice.  And, um ... maybe go to a movie after, but generally not.  And just the two of us, I think, would be the perfect setting.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Wow, that is right up there for me too.  The glass of wine, the quiet.  I like going to places where there's not, you know, a lot of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- noisy children. [LAUGH] And prime rib, maybe would be my second choice, I like the fillet mignon. [SIGH]
L:  I like that too.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I like that too.  And I think a perfect meal at home --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- probably ... would be when we're entertaining, but just another couple, not big entertaining.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, on a small scale, somewhat informal, um, and it could be a wider variety of food, really.
R:  Now, you didn't mention any dessert.  Would you have dessert?
L:  Oh, yeah, I would.  Oh, yeah.  If I had room, yes, I would.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, I would.
R:  [MN]
L:  I'd probably have a cheesecake.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Ooh. [MN] I usually have -- well, anything that has chocolate in it is fair game, um, but I'm partial to ice cream, ice cream sundaes.  Probably my favorite type of restaurant is ah, [LIPSMACK] one of those Japanese steak houses.
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  The meats there are just incredible.  They're always really tender and really flavorful.  I really like those.
L:  You know, I haven't been to a Japanese steak house in a lot of years.  But I enjoyed it, but I don't even really remember what I ate.
R:  Mhm.  And they have -- they have that, uh, plum wine, that's real sweet and kinda -- kinda got a little tang to it.  That's really good.
L:  I've -- I've had that, because I have a Japanese brother in law.
R:  Oh, you do?
L:  Yes, I do.  Yes.  So I've definitely had that.  But I don't like most Japanese -- traditional Japanese food.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I don't care much for the sushi, or the saki type of drink.
L:  Yeah, and they ma- also make um, [LIPSMACK] a fermented [SIGH] -- oh, it starts with cabbage, and I don't know what all goes in it, but it's also hot.  But it's fermented.
R:  Oh, ah -- [SIGH]
L:  I can't remember.
R:  It starts with a K.  K- --
L:  If you said it, I might --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  I might recall, but I -- I --
R:  I know what you're talking about.
L:  -- I've tried that several times.  I've had it out and I've also had it home made, so ... and neither way -- neither way.  So what else did they ask us?
R:  [SIGH] Well, let's see.  A- -- actually, I only heard two questions, "Do you like eating out better or in -- at home better?", and, "Describe you're ideal meal -- your perfect meal".  [LIPSMACK] Um ...
L:  I don't ha- -- I don't -- I like both.  There are times I like home -- I -- I don't have a preference.  It depends on the day and my mood.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If I don't feel like getting gossied up, then I prefer to be at home.
R:  Oh, exactly.  Yep.
L:  And there is --
R:  If dressing up is part of it, that's a whole different story.
L:  Yeah, sure it is.  And if -- although, living in Florida you can go rather casual to a lot of places.  But um, I -- again, I think it depends upon my mood and what kind of a day you've had.
R:  Mhm.  And the budget. [LIPSMACK] [SIGH]
L:  True.  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 'Cause you could always eat cheaper at home than you can eat out.
L:  That's true.  That's true.
R:  Although, I've had some awful cheap meals at McDonalds that weren't half bad. [LAUGH] I'm sure they were terribly unhealthy, but they -- they were tasty, and they were cheap, and they were fast.
L:  Well I -- well I -- I enjoy that once in a while, but, um, I travelled too much with my daughter on the road.  She was a competitive swimmer, so I saw too many years of -- of fast food, so that's not my preference.
R:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK]
L:  D- -- do you -- do you like meals at home?
R:  I do, but I --
L:  Do you like to entertain?
R:  [LIPSMACK] I don't cook, either.  And so, um --
L:  Well, I used to cook.  It's just since we're retired my husband loves to cook, so --
R:  Oh, well, there you go.
L:  He -- he does [LIPSMACK] almost a hundred percent of it.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I am -- it --
L:  Do you like to entertain at home?  In a meal?
R:  You know, usually if I'm gonna, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- en- enjoy someone's company, then I do prefer to go out to a restaurant, because then we can sit and chat while somebody else is doing all the work.
L:  Right.
R:  And that to me, is -- is more fun than one -- either me or the other person having to um, you know, be up and about and worrying about the stove and the oven and --
L:  Well, it -- you -- the -- one -- frequently, when we have a meal at home and we're entertaining, and again I'm talking, small -- a small number -- we try to, um, plan our menu where we're not -- we're not really doing anything once our company has arrived.  It is kinda done food.
R:  Oh, yeah.  There you go.
L:  Um, so we're not ... we're not in the kitchen cooking.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ... other than that, I'm -- I'm kind of at a loss for words on this subject.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, how about, um, how important is it to be healthy?  Do you think about that, or is it more --
L:  Not often enough.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Not as much as I should.
R:  I've been trying a little bit more lately.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I've been watching my cholesterol readings, that's the big thing that I've been looking at.  And I've just made a few small changes, like going to skim milk instead of whole milk, and maybe not eating quite as much red meat, if I have a choice between chicken and steak, maybe every once in a while I'll choose the chicken instead.  And it's -- it's helped.  It's gone down, the cholesterol, so --
L:  Oh, that's good.  That's good.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  It didn't take that much of a change.
L:  Now, do you do that when you dine out?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, it's tougher when you dine out because [LIPSMACK] --
L:  See, I don't do that at all.
R:  No.
L:  That -- that's an extra special treat to me.
R:  Right.
L:  So it -- it's -- any type of calorie watching or -- or anything, is gone.  It's gone.  Totally.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Where I would not have desserts that often at home, but I -- I would, if I had room for it, when I was out.
R:  Right.  Well, I can't even keep desserts around the house.  Literally.  I can't keep them around, 'cause I eat 'em right away.  If there's chocolate or ice creams, so I -- I just never buy them unless I'm going out and making a special night of it, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Then it -- then it feels like a treat and it's not so often.  But if you're gonna have ice cream, you know, why have the -- the low fat stuff?  [LAUGH]
L:  You -- do you like um, [LIPSMACK] chain restaurants?
R:  [LIPSMACK] A few of 'em.  Yeah.  Um, let's see.  TGI Fridays, do you have those down there?
L:  Yep.  Mhm.
R:  Those have -- there's so much on the menu, there's always something good.  Um, and actually, for the Japanese steak house, you know, Benihana's[?] is just fine.  I know they have other ones, but Benihana's is --
L:  I've never heard of that.
R:  Oh, okay.  [LIPSMACK] They had those in -- I used to live in Minnesota and they had those there, and they have 'em in Indiana, and they have 'em here.
L:  And I wasn't aware of those in Michigan, and I've only been gone from Michigan for --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not quite two years, so ...
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LIPSMACK] No --
R:  I used to live in Wisconsin, so I'm a bit cheese eater, too. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's not too good for the cholesterol.
R:  No, it's terrible.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, since I cut -- I cut back on cheese a little bit, and I used to get migraine headaches and now I -- I hardly ever get them, and I think some of it was the cheese, so -- [SIGH] [LIPSMACK]
L:  Was it dairy, period?
R:  Well, it might be.  I hope not, because I'm still drinking milk and -- and like, ice cream and things like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I used to have cheese at least once a day.  Every meal had some kind of cheese --
L:  Oh, we have cheese all the time.
R:  Uh-huh. [SIGH]
L:  I mean, if we're hungry, we grab a hunk of cheese.
R:  Mhm.  Well, it's so good.  And wine and cheese, and some good bread and -- well that's a meal all in -- all in itself.
