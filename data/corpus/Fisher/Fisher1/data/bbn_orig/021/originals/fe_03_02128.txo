L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] We- -- well, I n-
L:  Hello.
R:  -- my name is Mike.
L:  Mine is Mrs Chittley[?].
R:  Julie, did you say?
L:  Julie, yes.
R:  Oh, okay. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, well, this'll be a quick call 'cause I don't have that many friends. [MN]
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's by choice or by circumstance? [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Well, you know, it, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some people make  --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot of 'em, some people only make a few.  It's not as though I have none.  But, ah, [SIGH] you know, um, um, m- more acquaintances I guess tha- than, ah, you know, close friends I think [MN], but, ah ...
L:  [NOISE] [MN] Can I ask if you're on the East Coast?
R:  Yeah, you can ask.  No, I'm in --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- ah, Chicago actually, how about you?
L:  Ah. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, I'm in Washington, and the reason I ask is because it seems like, um, all the people that I know who are like from New York or Massachusetts or Pennsylvania, [SIGH] they all have three or four really good friends and have them forever, for their whole lives.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH] And then, I'm on the [NOISE] West Coast, sorry, there's a dog out here, [NOISE] I'm on the West Coast and [NOISE] it -- and a lot of people in California have a lot of superficial friends. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Is that a dog in the background?
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] It's a couple of them.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE] They're friendly.  I'm on [NOISE] my cell phone, so I had to step out side [LAUGH], but, ah, [NOISE] maybe [LAUGH] I'll step inside.  If I get cut off it's because I'm on the cell. [SIGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  Um, [MN] anyway, that's why -- I just noticed that, that it seems like, um, you have a few friends, but you probably have them forever.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, well, you know, I guess -- I guess the guy who's r- really my best friend is the guy who, ah, you know, I've known since high school and who was the best man at my wedding and I -- [SIGH] but he lives in Cincinnati, so I talk to him a few times a year.  But, ah, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, there are people you've gone through things with who you [SIGH], ah, you know, tend to remember, um ...
L:  Is it just like picking up where you left off when you do talk to him?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, after e- yeah, it takes about, you know, five, ten minutes till we get kind of on the same wave length [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and get through the crises of the day and, you know, figure out who's still alive and who's sick.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  Ah, [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's not quite that bad but, [LAUGH] you know, we are getting to the --
L:  [LAUGH] It will be in twenty years, right? [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.  But, ah, we are getting to the stage where, you know, a few of our high school classmates have actually died already, and we're only fifty three, so, you know, it -- it gets, ah -- you know, you just s- start to wonder. [SIGH]  But, um ...
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  But, ah, you know, I guess that -- that's the way it goes these days. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, ah, so how about yourself?
L:  [SIGH] Well, I'm kind of like a massive nerd, [LAUGH] and I have a lot of acquaintances like you do, but, um, a very few friends, and kind of, I'm such a geek that my mother is [LAUGH] really my best friend. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Well, let's see, you're in Washington.  Isn't that where the world's largest geek is located?
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, no.  No, no, I -- I don't want to be associated with him. [LAUGH]
R:  O- oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH] Um, --
R:  [SIGH]
L: Ah, well, I grew up in California, but [SIGH] I used to be a typical airhead, --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- beach bunny Californian.  And ah, [SIGH] had a lot of friends but none of them were, I would say, genuine.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [NOISE] then we moved up here --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and the people are different.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Very, very different.  And it's like [SIGH] if you make -- somebody m- offers to make a friendship with you it's forever, and you know -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's for ever.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I have three or four friends probably.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, then of course I've a big -- I have a big giant family --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so [MN] I have a lot of friends in there, but that's about it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, how come you picked your best friend?  Just because you guys were similar in high school or ...?
R:  [MN] Yeah.  We were, ah -- we were both in the debate team, speaking of nerdiness.  I mean, --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, you don't get -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess -- I guess there are a couple more activities nerdier than being --
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  -- on the debate team, but none of --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  You know, that -- that -- that's certainly up there. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, my kids are in the chess club, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, okay, that -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that -- that's right up there too, an- and --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- ah, you know, it -- it -- and it- it's good for them too, you know, you get -- t- they get competition, and you get, ah, you know, to get to meet people with similar interests and that sort of stuff.  And [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm sure they get to hang around between rounds at the tournament, but, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and socialize.  But, ah, [SIGH] so, ah, we -- we were the two guys who did all the work.  Even though, ah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Even though actually there is another guy who got most of the credit, [SIGH] and, ah, you know, because he was a better speaker, so he made a --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- better impression.  And he --
L:  Well, that's [MN] --
R:  -- became -- he became an actor actually, a professional actor. [SIGH]
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  And, ah --
L:  Well, then he's used to taking everybody's credit --
R:  Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
L:  -- that works out just fine. [LAUGH]
R:  Sure. [SIGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  And, ah, so, ah, you know, that -- that's, um, um ...  So, you know, we just, ah, started spending more time together.  We were doing a lot.  We spent a lot of time in law libraries and that kind of stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, so ... [SIGH] Um.
L:  [MN] Are you a lawyer?
R:  No, uh-uh, but we -- for debate topics we were researching it.  Neither one of us turned out to be lawyers.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  [SIGH] A- actually it's a bad day when I run into a lawyer, you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I -- when I pass by the legal department I -- I kind of, you know, make a sign of a cross, just to make sure that, ah, --
L:  Oh [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] you know, they don't come out.  Course you're probably a lawyer, but ... [SIGH]
L:  Um, no, I'm a mommy. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay, all right, good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  I used to be an engineer.
R:  -- I haven't -- I haven't insulted any more lawyers today.
L:  Oh. [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Yes.  One of my best friends is a lawyer, he has the same birthday I do, so I never forget it, even though we haven't seen each other in like ten [LAUGH] years. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  But that's [inaudible].  Um, you know, you said you guys were on the debate team and did a lot of the work.  I think makes the best friendship is when you're working together for a common purpose.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  No.  Because you are both given --
R:  Yeah, you're kind of fading in and out on the phone.
L:  Sorry. [NOISE]  Is that better?
R:  [SIGH] Ah, yeah.
L:  Okay.  I live in the forest, so it's [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, that sounds lovely.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, it's just gorgeous, it's beautiful.  Beautiful.  [SIGH] But, ah, this phone recept- 
R:  So, you're in the wet part of Washington?
L:  Well, I'm in the western part, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  West of Seattle.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which is the scummy place to leave[?], but, um, [LAUGH] I don't have any friends in Seattle, no. [LAUGH] Um, anyway, I said that I think it's work that makes friendships really solidif- when people work together.
R:  Yeah, not necessarily at a job, but, you know, at some --
L:  Right.
R:  -- kind of an activity.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, you know.
L:  [MN] I think my best --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- up here, she and I both home school our children, and so we do a lot of science activities together, and it helps us grow together and it helps our kids grow together.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Hopefully setting up friendships for them for life too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] [SIGH] But, I guess I'm just not one of these people who wants to have -- friendships, I think, take a lot of work,
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if you do them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- right. [LAUGH]  Yeah.  And people have, you know, fifty friends, and it's like how do you maintain them?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.  I think there's always -- also kind of a different -- you know, there's a different social skill set among people who make friends easily. [SIGH] Um, you know, where, um, you know, your [MN] -- I'm fairly horrible at the small talk, I'm glad they give us a topic to talk about, otherwise I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- wouldn't know what to do about here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, ah, you know, there are other people who just, you know, [NOISE] a- are wonderful at that sort of thing, and, um, you know, so they tend to put people at ease faster.  And [SIGH] maybe the friends are superficial but, ah, you know, that -- that -- that depends on what happens later, but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  My husband is the centre of the circle.  When he walks in it's [MN] you know, [NOISE] it all revolves around him.  And it's just kinda neat to watch [LAUGH] but, [LAUGH] not for me. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK]  And, ah, you know, it's -- it's -- you know, you can ap- appreciate somebody else's skills in that area, even if you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- even if you lack 'em.
L:  Yeah.  I'm not so sure that it's all skill.  I don't think it's necessarily learned.  I think some people -- it's in the -- they're just born that way.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, that's probably true.  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, there are certain things that certainly help with it.  [NOISE] Ah, you know, certain physical attributes and, [SIGH] um ...
L:  Like people who talk with their hands. [LAUGH]  I think that's attractive to people, they feel like they're open and welcoming. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Body language.
R:  Either that or deaf, one of the two.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.  I don't know any deaf people actually, so ... [LAUGH] I don't have any deaf friends.  Do you have any deaf friends?
R:  Well, actually, ah, four of my sisters are deaf, so ...
L:  Wow!
R:  [SIGH] So, um ...
L:  You have four sisters and they're all deaf?
R:  Yeah, so ...  There's just the five of us.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Now, how did that happen?  It -- it's obviously a genetic thing, right?
R:  Yeah, it's some sort of recessive gene.  So, the fact that they're all girls and the fact they're four out of five of them is just, you know, that sort of random luck. [SIGH] But, ah --
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, so, you know, [MN] when I think of talking with the hands, that's the first thing that comes to mind.
L:  Oh.  Is your mother deaf [MN]?
R:  No, uh-uh. [SIGH]  And, ah, [SIGH] the funny thing is that, ah, um, you know, the -- there's -- there's three that are profoundly deaf and one who can use the phone, but still leg-  is legally deaf.  [SIGH] So, she has the most hearing.  But she married a deaf guy who has -- i- it's much more strong genetically in his family.  So, she's the one -- the only one who has, ah -- two of her kids are deaf, and one is not.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, so, you know, that's kind of the interesting thing there.  Ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Sorry, you're fading in and out.  Actually, you're out now.
L:  Am I --
R:  Can you hear me? [PAUSE] [MN] Hello?
L:  [MN] Do you still hear me?
