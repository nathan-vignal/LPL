R:  Yeah.  That's what you have to do.  They're, um, looking for a partner for you and you just have to wait.  I know it seems like a long time.

R:  Yes. [SIGH]
L:  My name's Bob.
R:  Hi, Bob.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, I like the topic of food, that one's easier than some. [SIGH] [NOISE]
L:  Right.  What kind -- what do you prefer, restaurants or eating at home?
R:  Restaurants.  What do you prefer?
L:  Me too, restaurants. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, great.  So, [SIGH] I, um, like to eat at home but I don't like to do the grocery shopping and ...  I like to cook but [SIGH] it's time consuming and I don't like, um, [SIGH] you know --
L:  But hate mess. [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] cleaning up afterwards. [LAUGH]  So ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, I'm cleaning up afterwards.  [SIGH] Also when you eat at home [SIGH] usually you have to c- -- we only have the just the two of us.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] And when you ea- cook at home you cook a serving, it's not a s- small serving it's a large serving. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  And you've leftovers for two or three days.
R:  Right.  So you have to eat the same things over --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- and over.
L:  And also you tend to eat more a home too.
R:  Yeah, that's true. [SIGH]  And so --
L:  Unless you get -- [NOISE]
R:  W- what kind of a --
L:  [SIGH] Unless you get TV dinners.
R:  No.  [LAUGH] I don't like those, do you?
L:  [SIGH] Well, some of 'em are pretty good now.
R:  Are they? Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  I guess I should try 'em again. [SIGH]  Haven't had 'em --
L:  They have some meatloaf and, some, um, Salisbury steak [SIGH] with mashed potatoes and gravy and vegetables, and meatloaf with vegetables and meat l- -- and gra- and mashed potatoes and ...
R:  Yeah.  They sound v-
L:  I've had those lately.
R:  They sound very good.
L:  I [NOISE] like to eat lunch at home.  I like to have soup.  We're retired now.
R:  Oh, that's wonderful.  Yeah, I like to eat breakfast and lunch at home.  [SIGH] It's fun to go out occasionally. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then when you go out for lunch it's less expensive than going out for dinner. [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  So I [NOISE] try to do that occasionally too.
L:  Do you?
R:  What type of restaurants do you like to go to?
L:  I'd be at a steak restaurant.
R:  Steak restaurant?  [MN] Do you have Outback? [SIGH] Do you have Outback? [NOISE]
L:  [MN] We have Outback, but I like, ah, Long Horn.
R:  Long Horn, yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where are you from?  Where do you live?
L:  Ohio.
R:  Really?  I -- I grew up there in Warren, Ohio. [MN]
L:  Oh,--

L:  -- is that right, we're Cincinnati.
R:  Cincinnati?  [SIGH] I live in Ann Arbor Michigan right now.
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  Yeah. [MN]
L:  Do you go to college?
R:  No.  Um, I'm a grandma so I have --
L:  Oh. [SIGH]
R: -- taken some classes, you know, off --
L:  Oh. [SIGH]
R:  -- and on, but I don't [LAUGH] go, um -- I work for the University of Michigan.
L:  I t- I wondered if you did.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Are you a professor? [NOISE]
R:  No.  I am staff, I'm a secretary.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  But it's hard to find, um, [MN] you know, higher level positions here in Ann Arbor, because it's such an educated, um, [MN] workforce here.
L:  Right.  I imagine they're highly educated.
R:  We have great restaurants here.  There's all kinds, there's, um, steak restaurants and there's [SIGH] vegetarian restaurants and there's like international, you know, all these different countries.
L:  Oh, is that right?
R:  Yeah.  We have, ah, East Indian --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- food and Thai food [SIGH] and Chinese food and, [SIGH] um --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- just about anything.  Mexican, I love Mexican food.  Do you like that?
L:  Oh, do you.  I don't -- we -- my wife doesn't like Mexican.
R:  Oh, so you don't get to go very often then?
L:  Well, we went to Ch- -- we used to go to Chi Chi's[?].
R:  Chi Chi's, yeah, we have Chi Chi's.  I like --
L:  But I didn't particularly like the food there.
R:  No?
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I don't go there very often, um --
L:  [NOISE] And she can't stand Taco Bell, so we don't go there.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH] I like it, you know, [LAUGH] 'cause I like Mexican.  I lived in California for five years so [SIGH] I think I --
L:  Oh, is that right?
R:  Yeah, that's where I learned to like Mexican so much.  And I know how to cook Mexican food, you know.  And [SIGH]--
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's cheap, um, mostly beans.  And, um --
L:  I like beans.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  -- but they have it in such paste. [NOISE]
R:  They what?
L:  They have paste beans.
R:  Taste ...?
L:  Mexican, it's a paste --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- more than anything.
R:  Right, that's true.  [SIGH] Yeah.  It's not like solid beans, it's more like [MN], ah, thick --
L:  [SIGH] It's not like chili or something like that.
R:  [NOISE] I like chili, yeah.  We have --
L:  [NOISE] Does the Mexico have chili?
R:  Um, not that I had there. [SIGH]  You know, they probab- [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Well, it comes from Europe, isn't it?
R:  Chili does?
L:  Chili is from Europe.
R:  Is it?  I don't know.
L:  I don't know. [NOISE]
R:  I don't either.
L:  [NOISE] [several inaudible words], isn't it?
R:  I don't know where --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's from.  In Michigan we have pasties, [SIGH] which are like, um, pot pies --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- without the gravy.  And they used to -- like often the old times when they would do the, um, w- woo- you know, the lumber industry.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  The wives would send pasties.  So they'd have meat and vegetables in them, in a dough, like a pot pie. [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH] Right.
R:  [SIGH] But they didn't have gravy. [SIGH]
L:  Ah. [NOISE]
R:  But, um, [SIGH] we have those here.  Those are different.
L:  Ah. [NOISE]
R:  And I like fish.  [NOISE] Do you like fish? [SIGH]
L:  I love fish.  I like f- fish, pork, lamb. [SIGH]
R:  Me too.
L:  Ah, poultry, meat.  Yesterday we ate at -- ate and, ah, I had steak. [SIGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  Now we're going to go to the Long Horn this week probably.
R:  Oh, that's be wonderful.  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  They have the best steaks there.
R:  Do they?  [SIGH] Seems like I've seen 'em but I don't think we have 'em here in Ann Arbor.  I've been to Outback. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But I don't know if we have Long Horn.  I'll have to find out, since you recommend it that sounds good.  [SIGH] And they have, um -- you get like baked potatoes with it, and ...
L:  W- well, I get the cheddar mashed. 
R:  Mm.  That does sound delicious.  Yeah.  I like the big --
L:  Salad, cheddar mashed and a s- [MN] juicy steak. [MN]
R:  Yeah, that sounds great.  Are you hungry? [NOISE]
L:  They have the best meat there.  We -- the places -- the place we go it -- it's -- they got the best steaks I've ever had.
R:  [NOISE] Really?
L:  I just compare everything to Long Horn.
R:  Are they expensive there?
L: [SIGH] Well, you can get a eight ounce [NOISE] or a ten ounce, either eight or ten, I think it's [SIGH] eight or a ten ounce steak with mash -- cheddar mash and a salad [SIGH] for--
R:  Mm.
L:  -- for eleven dollars.
R:  Oh that's reasonable for a steak.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That is good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'll have to look into that restaurant, that sounds good.
L:  That's -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that -- that's a renegade that's a top sirloin steak.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, since you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- recommend it.  [SIGH] Do you go to -- like we have a lot of little like home cooking restaurants that a lot of time the Greek [NOISE] people own them.  Boy, they are good cooks.
L:  What --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do they cook?
R:  Ah, like home cooking.  So you can get, um, [SIGH] oh, you could get like fish.  They'll have different specials.  They'll have like, um, [SIGH] one night maybe they'll have vegetarian --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- lasagna or fish or [SIGH] stew, --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- or meatloaf.  Or, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they just have a whole variety of, ah, American foods.  But they --
L:  [SIGH] It's very spicy, isn't it?
R:  Um, the Greek food is.  Some of it I think.  Um, I don't even reme- -- they have Greek Town in Detroit and we have a Greek Restaurant here, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and there's one that's real good but I can't think of the name of it.  And they put mashed potatoes on the top.  [MN] Like, ah, meat --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like hamburger and chili underneath and then they put mashed potatoes on the top.
L:  Gee. [MN]
R:  That's really good.
L:  Is it good? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sounds rather messy to me. [LAUGH]
R:  It is messy, yeah.  Well, ah, you can eat it with a fork.
L:  [SIGH] If you eat it with a knife and fork, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] So, I live near Cincinnati.  Um, what's the name of that town, is it like Amelia?

R:  And I did substitute teaching.  Yeah.

L:  No, we never had any children.  We've been married [SIGH] thirty three years now. [SIGH]
R:  Oh.  Well, they say couples are happy, you know, often times very happy without having children.  Children are such a stress, you know. [SIGH]
