R:  Hello.
L:  Hello. [NOISE]
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, this is Marianne. [NOISE]
R:  Hi, Marianne --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my name is Erin.
L:  [NOISE] Erin, hi. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] Okay, our topic is [NOISE] whether we like to eat in restaurants or at home. [MN] [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  Want to start? [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Um ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I like both, I like to cook a lot --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so I like to stay home.
L:  [NOISE] [MN]
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] sometimes when I go out --
L:  Mhm. [MN] [NOISE] Let me turn my TV down. [MN]
R:  I like to go out and eat, but like, last week I went out for brunch and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- after I had my omelet I thought, "Gosh I make -- c- can make a better one at home".
L:  [NOISE] I know exactly what you mean.
R:  For like a dollar, and I just paid twelve dollars for this.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [LAUGH]  Exactly.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I like to eat out on special occasions, but I'd prefer to eat at home.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] Um, I know -- what was another thing it had mentioned?  Ah, [NOISE] do you remember what-- what were some of the things --
R:  Oh, gosh, I don't know.
L:  -- were that were mentioned? [SIGH]  Um ...
R:  Are you a good cook?
L:  Ah, well, my husband thinks I am.  I guess I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] do okay.
R:  That's good.  What do you like to make?
L:  [SIGH] Um, [NOISE] I make, ah, chow mein, my own ver- -- well, it's my daddy's version actually.  He started --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- making it, ah, thirty, forty years ago.  So I just took it up from there.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm sorry, [COUGH] I keep losing my voice.  [SIGH] [MN] Um, that and meatloaf. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] In fact, that's what I was planning for supper then I realized I didn't have any green peppers and so now I'm going to have to do something else.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  What kind of places do you like to eat out at?
L:  Ah, Mexican food, [NOISE] I love Mexican food, El Chico's.  I don't know where you're from, but we have a lot of El Chico's around there and that's my favorite --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Mexican restaurant.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's good.
L:  [MN] What do you like? [NOISE]
R:  Where do you live?
L:  Oh I'm in Texas.
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] And where are you?
R:  New York.
L:  Oh, okay. [MN] [NOISE]
R:  So there's a lot of great restaurants here [MN].
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, things are really expensive in New York. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I can imagine. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I don't --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- really know if I've every known anybody that lives in New York.  I've heard that it's [NOISE] really [NOISE] [SIGH] a high cost of living there.
R:  Yeah.  It's true. [SIGH]  I moved here from California and my rent is like double.
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Oh, really.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I didn't know how they compared because I thought California was kind of high too. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, it is.  If it -- I guess it just depends on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] the city --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and etcetera, anyway.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I guess we should stay on the topic. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.  My daughter go me into this and she said that we need to stay with the topic for about eight minutes so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [SIGH] let me see.  I'm trying to think. [NOISE] [SIGH] And like I told my daughter I love to talk on the phone so I thought I could be good at this, but then, usually when you are talking to your friend, you know, we talk about personal things and everything, we don't --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- [NOISE] h- have a major topic we have to discuss.
R:  Mhm.  So when was the last time you have been out to eat?
L:  Mm.  I'm sorry, I was lighting a cigarette.  [SIGH] Um, I guess I don't have to ask if you mind if I smoke. [LAUGH]
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  Because we ae not in the same room.  [SIGH] My daughter and I and my grandson just went out last week --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to -- [NOISE] well, in fact, my [NOISE] oldest grandson had sold me a card had a lot of buy one, get one frees on it.  So we went to a Mexican Restaurant --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that we'd never tried before.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] And I didn't really care for it, but it was -- I'm into the Tex Mex and this was authentic Mexican food.  So ...  And there's a big difference in it.
R:  Yeah, yeah. [MN]
L:  [NOISE] So ...
R:  It's a little more, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Americanized --
L:  Well Tex Mex is --
R:  I guess.
L:  [SIGH] Well, Tex Mex is spicier and things like [NOISE] this.  Ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- authentic Mexican food is kind of bland to me to me, you have to add a lot of h- hot sauce and stuff to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- give it any flavor.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] I mean that's my theory on it anyway, I don't know.  [NOISE] [SIGH]  But, ah, w- what's your favorite type of food?
R:  Mm.  [NOISE] Yeah, I like Mexican [NOISE] food.  Um, Italian food, I've been eating a lot of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] like Vietnamese and Thai food.
L:  Oh, now I've never had Thai, but my son is al- always ordering this Vietnamese --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- soup for me --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I love it. [MN]
R:  Mhm.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And 'cause it's got -- there's a s- -- a --
R:  What it called laksa?
L:  I don't know.  I -- I don't even know what it's called.  I just have him, ah -- he's found some really different Vietnamese places around here, so he'll [SIGH] try different ones, and he always gets me whatever this soup is, that [SIGH] [MN] -- you have -- you cook you meat yourself --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Your steak, they give it to you raw, and they give you the broth and everything --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and the noodles are already --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- cooked. [SIGH] And, ah, but there's -- of course I love spicy things.  So it has this really spicy --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sauce that you add to it, a red sauce. [LIPSMACK]
R:  [MN] Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
L:  And it's so good.  And [MN] course I have to have my fresh jalapenos in it, and things like that.  So ...
R:  Mm, that sounds good.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, in fact I haven't eaten all day, it sounds very good. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, I like to go out for Asian food a lot.  [SIGH] Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- usually it seems like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you can get things --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like really fresh, really huge meals.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  But not as expensive as like an Italian restaurant or something.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know, and you get a lot more for your buck, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it's really good too.
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] You know, see, ah, as much as I like Italian food, I'd rather cook [NOISE] mine at home.  I've never [SIGH] -- well, the last time I ate in an Italian restaurant I got shrimp and scampi, so I didn't even try any of their Italian dishes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] So ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But any time I've eaten at -- at 'em in the past I haven't really cared for the sauces.  People here -- I don't know if you have Olive Garden there, but a lot of my friends go to Olive Garden and they say it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really good, but I've never tried it.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I've been there.  I mean it's good, but it's not --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- like -- I wouldn't consider it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- authentic Italian food or anything. --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's like, [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, I don't know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I don't know I almost feel like I'm eating like just fast food, Italian [LAUGH] food, you know?
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah. [SIGH]
R:  Well, what's funny, we- -- my neighbour, she's one of my best friends, she went there and she says, --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- "It is a fantastic place, but don't order their spaghetti, it's not any good".  Well, supposedly that's what they're known for --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- is their spaghetti [LAUGH].
L:  And -- but then I've talked to other people that say they love their spaghetti --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so it's just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and so I didn't think I'd even want to eat there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because if I did, I'd probably wanna get the spaghetti, and -- but it doesn't mean she and I have the same taste.  I think I'd almost have to try it for myself before I [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, would know for sure. [NOISE]
R:  [MN] [NOISE] I usually don't [NOISE] like to order --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- things that I could --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- make at home.
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  Like a spaghetti, or something like that.
L:  True.
R:  You know I like to try something that I don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ususally make.
L:  Yeah, I've always felt that way too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Olive Garden, though, I know they do have really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- big portions, they give you a lot of bread sticks --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and salad beforehand.
L:  [SIGH] Well, and I've noticed too, you know, they of- offer this lunch special, like just a soup and salad.  And I don't know if it's all you can eat or what, [NOISE] but [SIGH] ...
R:  I don't know, I've only been there a couple of times. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I guess I should try it some time so I could decide for myself.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I'm really bad about -- when we do eat out, which isn't very often, I want to eat at a place I've already tried. [NOISE]  And that's why I'm so into El Chico's because I know I like them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Joys are the same things.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, basically --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and my husband gets upset with me for saying I should try new things, but I figure, you know, why not stick with what you know you like? [SIGH] [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, you might get it and you might not like it. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, true.  And -- and I'm kinda cheap.  I don't want to put out money for something I'm gonna not like, so ... [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] But then, you know, [NOISE] you could try something and love it.
L:  Well, that's true too. [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And every now and then, of course if you -- in most, ah, menus the break down, the -- [NOISE] the dish, you now, show what the ingredients are in it.  So if you can read through it you can maybe find something that sounds pretty good and go ahead and give it a [NOISE] shot. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  I'm usually pretty good about trying new stuff.
L:  [MN] Well, see that's not me though.
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] Every now and then --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- though I'll try a new -- I'll get my cookbook out and try a new dish that way.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, I would rather do that than -- [SIGH] well, or I might have my husband -- he's willing to try things.  Have him to try something new and then I'll taste his just to see if I -- I would ever order it for myself.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that works.  [NOISE] 'Cause, like I say, he's not as picky as I am.
R:  Ah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that's good. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Now, d- -- was it mentioned anything about prices, or  ...?  [NOISE] [SIGH] I guess I wasn't really listening and all of a sudden I heard my machine go off and it was telling all this stuff, I hurried and grabbed the phone and hit a button that I thought it said --
R:  I know.
L:  -- to hit.
R:  I know.
L:  [SIGH] So, now I -- I'm not really [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- remembering exactly ... I know one of the things was, you know, [NOISE] eating out versus eating at home.  But --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I know there was more to it than that.  And I know they tape the conversations, so I just hope I'm not blowing it by not remembering everything.
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, I mean it is nice to go out, like, um, for the ambience and everything.  You know just if you're gonna -- just to get out of the house --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and do something.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly [MN]
R:  And meet people you know, if you don't want to entertain at your house.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  But ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, if there's just like me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and my roommate or something I don't need to go out --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and pay for food --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when I already have food here.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Mm.
L:  So, you're fairly young.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't even know --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- w- -- how much we're supposed to get into like, you know, if can talk about personal things, or ...
R:  [NOISE] I really don't know.
L:  [SIGH] Is this your first time of doing this?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, okay. [NOISE]  Me too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And [SIGH] my daughter has done two so far.
R:  Really.  And she --
L:  And --
R:  -- she thought it worked well?
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah.  She was happy with it.  And of course she likes to talk [NOISE] too, but my son, my oldest son has our computer.  He -- w- well he took the, ah, the, um, [NOISE] or cruddy, what's that thing called?  The tower, to his house so he could [NOISE] clean out a lot of stuff, because my youngest son has put so much on our computer that it's used up all the space.  [SIGH] And I don't use the computer so I don't even really know that much about it.  I just know what my son told me needed to be done.  [SIGH] So, my d- daughter signed me up on her computer [SIGH] and she just --
