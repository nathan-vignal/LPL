R:  Hi, my name is Andrew.
L:  I'm Sheila. [SIGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  How -- how you doing, Sheila? 
L:  Okay. [NOISE]
R:  That's good.
L:  [MN]
R:  [SIGH] Um, well I guess I'll get started here, if you don't mind?
L:  Uh-huh [SIGH].
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I have to say I probably like eating in restaurants more, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just for the simple fact that you don't have to really do anything, that they -- the job is to spend --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the time to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- take care of you, and they bring you your food and then you get to select from the menu.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And so all the items are already going to be made, you don't have to be very involved in the preparation.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I never cook.  So, [NOISE] cooking to me [NOISE] would be buying food, [SIGH] um, in a -- a [NOISE] place where I can take the food out, whether a fancy [NOISE] supermarket, or h- you know, fancy food place, and bring it home and open the containers.  [NOISE] So, I eat out all the time, except for breakfast food.
R:  Okay.  B- but I would have to say --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- though that it -- sometimes it is nice to cook for yourself --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because, for one thing you get to control how the food is going to taste more --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so than if you go to a --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- restaurant.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH] And for another -- like a couple of weeks ago --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I cooked, ah, supper for my girlfriend --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and she really liked it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so, it's nice when you're able to cook for somebody else --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and you're able to make something they -- they like.
L:  Well, if you want to do that but, [MN] at this point, I don't want to cook.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]  Well, yeah --
L:  Uh-uh, I've cooked for years and years and years, and you have to prepare it and you have to wash up and you have to buy the food and blah, blah, blah.
R:  D- did you work in a restaurant?
L:  No, I didn't. [SIGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Never did.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Or may- maybe once, for one day. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [SIGH] Ah, but, um, you know, I really didn't work in restaurants.
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  But, um, at this point I'm just a lazy person --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I just like, you know, getting the food there.  And also one sees other people there, so it's a -- it's not quite a connection but at least you're not isolated because at least you see -- get to talk to the waiter or the waitress and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- sometimes other people there. [SIGH]
R:  Now --
L:  An-
R:  -- you mentioned -- oh, sorry, go ahead.  Go.
L:  Go ahead. [SIGH]
R:  You mentioned that you like to go pick up items --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then bring them back home to eat, is that correct?
L:  Well, when I shop, you know, if I get water or orange juice or something.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, I might get some other item.  I got some nuts yesterday. [SIGH]  And I got, um, some sort of, um, plastic field beets from France the other day.  And, you know, I get other foods, or I might get cereal or something.  So, when I get that then I get, [SIGH] um, maybe a package of take home food, some veggie -- healthful veggie things prepared, you know, from a good salad bar without too much grease. [SIGH] Um, or, you now, other foods that I'm just wanting to eat, maybe some turkey slices, or a prepared chicken or whatever it might be.
R:  Okay.  So it sounds like when you -- when you do go buy something to --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to take back home, you try to look for healthy choices.  I mean, you mentioned turkey and chicken --
L:  Yeah, I d-
R:  -- which are generally healthy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then you also mentioned --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- kinda like salad type items.
L:  Yeah.  Or I might get cooked salmon, you know, broiled salmon or something.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH] Um, and, I might get, you know, a banana or some veggies --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or whatever --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and I -- I keep thinking -- and I know I should be eating more veggies, so I am trying to eat more salads. [SIGH]
R:  I see.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, you're more the exception, because I would think that a lot of people when they say -- they go, "Yeah" --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- if they're going to go to a restaurant like a -- a -- a Ruby Tuesday's, or like a -- a --
L:  No, I hate those kind of places.
R:  Yeah, where you just get burgers and things like that.
L:  No, no, no.  I'm not -- I don't go to places like that.
R:  Okay.
L:  There's a very good italian restaurant near me that isn't very expensive and I could go there for about as much money as going to, ah, Olive Tree.  And Olive Tree I figure is such a dump.  And this place has great bread, [SIGH] um, they have olive oil with garlic and olives an' you dip your bread in that.  And, you know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- the food is really good. [SIGH]
R:  Mm.  Does sound good.
L:  Yeah, and, um, [NOISE] salmon with, um, horsera- filled with horseradish covering and, um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- ah, spinach with pinola[?] nuts, you know, for about twelve ninety five.  So, why should I go to Olive Tree for ten ninety five and eat that crap?
R:  That's true.  So you like to go to it looks like more --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- your local kinda restaurants?
L:  Um, yeah, definitely.
R:  Okay.
L:  To a ma and pa sort of restaurant.
R:  Okay.  [SIGH] Yeah, those usually are pretty good.  They usually have a pretty good fare and then too --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they're also more willing, I -- I -- I've noticed, to accommodate special requests you might have about how you like the food prepared or --
L:  Definitely. [SIGH] [NOISE]
R:  -- if you -- if you want something left off, or whatever.  Whereas, --
L:  [NOISE] Sure.  Sure. [SIGH]
R:  -- kind of more at the restaurants or main chains --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they kinda just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just --
L:  I have -- and also I have a very small kitchen.  I have eight inches of counter space.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I have to clear this makeshift tabletop that I built, you know, behind that area, um, or in front of it, if you want to describe it that way.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] So, you know, there's d- when I used to give dinner parties years a go, I used to have pots and pans on my bed, which is adjacent to the kitchenette.
R:  Oh. [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH] So, you kn- and or I would put the dishes in the refrigerator if I was too tired to wash --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- them at night.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] Um, s- it's 'cause it's not easy cooking.  You know, it's one thing if you have a big kitchen with plenty of counter space, it's more fun that way.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH] So, is -- is part of it n- not only just, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- convenience for you, but it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- also sounds like a space issues as well.
L:  Oh, definitely both issues.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  Definitely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Once in a while I like to make a kinda complicated dish.  I mean --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- one, you know, for going to somebody's house for a holiday, or whatever.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That I don't mind if it takes several hours or whatever.
R:  I see.  So, well --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that, ah --
L:  Yeah, re-
R:  I guess -- oh, go ahead.
L:  Recently I went downtown, I wanted what's, um, called potato cogo[?].  It's a potato pudding with ground potatoes, and it's made with onion and egg and seasoning. [SIGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, and it's not something that I do every day, so I went and got it from this place I knew had it downtown.
R:  Uh-huh.  Sounds like you're in an area where there is a lot of local kind of restaurants and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and places that you can sample like that.
L:  Yeah, I'm in New York.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  In Manhattan.  Where are you? [NOISE]
R:  Knoxville, Tennessee.
L:  Oh, really. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  So there's not too many --
L:  Uh-huh. [SIGH]
R:  -- ah, kinda there's a lot of chain places around here.  And --
L:  There are chain places too, and we have plenty --
R:  Right.
L:  -- of um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- McDonalds and Wendy's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, you know, things like -- even Wendy's is better than McDonalds, I think.
R:  Right.  But I think that, ah, I -- I would have to say that just my perception of New York --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- having never been there, lived there, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- is that there probably quite a few local places.  That the -- the local places have a better chance to survive in that kind of --
L:  Uh-huh. [SIGH]
R:  -- area than -- than some other places.
L:  Wouldn't they [NOISE] s- be able to survive where you are?
R:  [SIGH] [MN] Well, ah, you would think so, but there's like -- there's not too many, really what I would say, just locally owned restaurants that are --
L:  The -- the -- the reason that landlords rent to these chains is they get more money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They get the higher rent. [NOISE]
R:  That's true.  That's a good point.
L:  I know somebody who's in the real estate business, you know, and they rented a McDonalds and -- and building.  Actually it was owned by this quite famous artist at that point.
R:  Mm.
L:  [SIGH] And they get really high rent.  So, I mean, you know, it's a shame that it sells out the public by having these awf- -- [MN] and I think it's kind of awful places.
R:  Right. [SIGH]
L:  Um.
R:  It -- yeah, it's -- I mean, it's unfortunate that, ah, I guess the sad fact is that in --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- just the way M- McDonalds and these other places --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- are just so dominant --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that they can basically drive anybody out --
L:  Right.
R:  -- which is --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- which is a shame, 'cause I think, you know, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a -- a l- a lot of these local places have something important to offer.
L:  I would think that, you know, lower rent streets would be able to have them, or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or the side streets.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you have more ma and pa places on the side streets?
R:  Um, yeah, k- you know, yeah, kinda off the ah --
L:  Off the m-
R:  -- off the main roads kind of.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That is where you're going to find some of those kinds of places.
L:  The sort of secondary ones.  But, I guess --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in Knoxville, do you drive to where you eat, mostly?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  Ah --
L:  Here [SIGH] you --
R:  Yeah, public transportation here is not, ah, nearly as good, I'm sure, as in New York.  [SIGH] Um --
L:  Not only that, [NOISE] most people walk.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, this is one of the last cities where they walk to a lot of the activities.
R:  [MN]
L:  Not always but, you know, people might eat near their home --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or near their work, or whatever.
R:  N- now, I know a lot of -- myself, I bring my lunch to work.
L:  Ah ha.
R:  But I know there's --
L:  Aren't you good?
R:  -- several -- there's several, ah, ah, ladies I work with here --
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
R:  -- that they make a regular habit of going out to some of the local --
L:  Uh-huh. [SIGH]
R:  -- places.  And there are a few places downtown here --
L:  Uh-huh. [SIGH]
R:  -- that they eat at.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but there are also some, ah, other restaurants that they go to.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  Um, kind of, you know, five m- minutes away or so.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That they drive to.  Ah --
L:  Uh-huh. [SIGH]
R:  And so they -- they really like going out to those places.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I think they go to several kind of local, kind of places.  Like there's a place called Tomato Head --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I think they make special -- they make speciality kind of pizzas --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- kind of thing.  So ...
L:  Uh-huh.  But aren't you good that you bring your lunch?
R:  Well, it's more a, ah, cost saving measure than anything else.
L:  Yeah, it certainly is, it's a cost saving and you can eat --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- healthier.
R:  Yeah.  And --
L:  [SIGH] Or eat -- eat exactly what you want.
R:  Basically, yeah, yeah.  It's a --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It -- it gets expensive eating out, I mean ...
L:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, y- I used to be able to find three dollar places at one time and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- some dollar fifty places.  And I'm not talking when it was just cheap food before seventy three.
R:  Right. [SIGH]
L:  But, um, it's -- it's extraordinary to find a place for lunch that where you end up p- paying under five dollars.
R:  Yeah.  If you can pay under five dollars and you get a good meal, that's -- yeah -- you're -- you're --
L:  I mean, if you get a meal.  If you get something.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  I found a fantastic wrap with veggies where I got half a wrap in this very fancy place --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- near when I went to an, um, a- an arthritis exercise place recently.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that's kind of amazing.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I have a friend here at my work too, he, ah, he always tries to [MN] -- he -- his wife works downtown here too, so --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- they go out to eat, and he's got a few places that he goes to regularly --
L:  Uh-huh. [SIGH]
R:  -- because he can get a good deal like that.  He can get a good p- portion to eat --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and not have to pay, you know --
L:  A lot.
R:  -- an exorbitant amount for the both of them.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So, yeah, it's tough to find places --
L:  Do you have local southern restaurants at all there?
R:  [MN] There are a few.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, [SIGH] but, yeah, um, [SIGH] I'm trying to think.  There's -- it -- it is kinda disappointing that there aren't more --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- kind of sit down --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- nice restaurant kind of choices downtown, in this downtown area.
