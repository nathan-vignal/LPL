L:  Hello, my name's Ed.
R:  Hi, I'm Dee.
L:  Hi, Dee or Zee?
R:  Dee, as in Deborah.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Hi.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Are we the only two on?
L:  Yes, I think so.
R:  Oh, okay --
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, so I guess we're tal- -- we're supposed to talk about friends, friendships?
L:  [NOISE] Yes, yes.
R:  Okay, um.  Gee, it's -- uh, well -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well --
R:  I recently -- I recently got married and before that I had a lot of friends --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it just seemed like when -- when I moved away --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It -- I just tended to lose a lot of my friends and as -- as I got older I just found out that -- I mean, true friendship is very hard to fi- -- find.  I lost a friendship I've had for tw- -- for -- for years over something that happened and, I mean, right now, I -- I can say I have very few friends but the friends that I do have are true friends.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  And that -- that's what I've learned about friendships is they're very hard to find.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  When we're younger we think we -- everybody's our friend.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You -- you know, high school and college, yeah.  Name your friends and I could name them on, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- both hands and both feet, you know.  I had --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- friends galore.
R:  Yeah.  That's what you --
L:  And as years go along you get away from those --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, you still retain a few sometimes.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it's just that I find that a lot of people just don't tend to keep in touch.  I find that I'm the only one that's constantly emailing or calling and I -- I just don't -- don't get the same response and then--
L:  Right.
R:  -- when I confront them, they're just, "Life is busy".  I'm sorry, life is busy for me too but it takes two seconds to pick up a phone call and say hello.
L:  [NOISE] Yes.
R:  And it just -- I mean, I just realized who -- who my couple of friends are that stick by me but otherwise I -- I think I find that as a big challenge.  I look at my fr- -- my parents and they've had friends for over thirty years and they came from a different country and -- and the people that they've met thirty years ago, they're still friends with.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  And I -- I look at myself and that one friend that I had for twenty something years and our friendship ended two years ago over something really little and I -- the other friends that I have are all the people I've made in the last five years and I -- I -- I -- I just -- I just don't understand wh- why.  And it's also a matter of trusting.  I just find that a lot of it's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- competitiveness and jealousy that comes among friends --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I just don't believe that that should happen if -- if you're a friend and that's what I tend to find.  You know, when I got married, you know, my husband and I we bought this nice home and everyone -- our -- they're -- they're constantly asking do you have -- do you have this or that or they just want to come now to visit us just to look at our home and if -- if they're friends -- I -- I mean, I moved out of the [inaudible] I used to live in two years and no one has ever made a visit.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If they were true friends, they would have came, you know, a while back so that -- that's the biggest challenge I find, as far as friendship.  I just don't -- I -- I think they're very very hard to find and if you -- if I -- now, if I do meet people I'm always very hesitant to open up because of my experience.
L:  Right.  Yeah, we found out about friends, uh -- our house burned down in August --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we had no insurance and we had no, you know -- no nothing and, uh, we -- I was surprised at the number of people that said, "Okay".
R:  Mhm.
L:  Here -- here -- you know, we had some -- some neighbors that we didn't really even think of as close friends --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that said, "No, you're not going any- -- you're staying here at our place for a couple of days at least until we figure out what's going on".
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and they -- they have --
R:  Out of -- out of how many fr- -- like, how many friends o- -- offered that or were you shocked at the ones that didn't offer?
L:  In -- in all reality I was kind of shocked at the number that did, that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that, you know, afterwards said, "Hey, our house is open while you're figuring out if you want to stay here awhile" and that --
R:  But do you think -- do you think they really meant that or was --
L:  Yeah.  I mean --
R:  Because there's a big --
L:  -- some of them did.
R:  -- difference and lot of people will say, "I will help you" but when it comes down to it they're nowhere to be found so --
L:  Well, it -- it did cut up because we had the first weekend after it, we had probably twenty something folks show up to help us clean up the house.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, to clear out stuff that was burned out because it was really hard for us to do it.  We lost --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, we lost everything, we lost a bunch of animals.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, it was, uh, real hard -- uh, Barbara couldn't even go down there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, it was just so -- so much for her but here -- I -- somebody had to go down there 'cause I had these people coming down to help.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But they didn't stick it out [LAUGH] you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They were there one time --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and then I had about a dozen there the next weekend --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then I had one person came -- or like two people came next and then one person came, like, three more times.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You know, so it was kind of quick to see -- you know, it kinda dwindled.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh -- but [SIGH] you know, it -- it was -- most of the people that came to begin with were acquaintances that just -- they wanted to help people but --
R:  What about the people that you expected?  Did they come through or not?
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Like your long --
L:  So- -- a few of 'em did --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- but not near what I would have liked.
R:  Mm.
L:  Not what I would have ex- -- what --
R:  You realize --
L:  Not near what I would have done for them, you know.
R:  You realize like that was a test and now I'm pretty sure in your mind you know who will stick by you.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And, um, you know, that pretty much happened to me -- is at any situation in your life you will know who sticks by you --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, um, I just find that as we ge- -- as I got older, it was more so the competitive issue and a big jealousy and envious issue.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and that -- that's what causes problems and I -- I -- I was always brought up, whether it's family or friends, you should -- you should just be happy with what you have and you shouldn't let jealousy get in the way of friends and that -- that's just what seems to be happening a lot with a lot of my friends.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I -- I've got a few friends that -- that they go, "When I've got it, it's theirs".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And when they've got it, it's mine, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But for the most part, when you've got it they -- they're -- they're fine to be your friends but when you don't have anything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, it's like, well, you know, "I'll see you around", you know.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  So, uh, I -- this -- this indeed has shown us what friend -- you know, what friends will do and what they won't do, you know.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  So, I -- I don't know.  I'm -- I'm -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We had some -- we had some friends that since this happened, they were our cl- -- I mean, every Saturday night we went to their house.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it was just we went out there and we did stuff together.  If they wanted to go off, we stayed and took care of their kids and, uh, we did, you know, all kinds of things together.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh --
R:  So, what caused the change?
L:  Well, we had a -- a friend of ours was -- was moving away.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she had said, "When I leave, I'm not taking any of my furniture and y'all need it, 'cause you're going to be getting a new place eventually".
R:  Mhm.
L:  "So the furniture in the house, all the furniture's yours.  I just have to sell the house".  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And our friends were looking for a place to move to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but they would never qualify for getting a loan on this nice little place.
R:  Yeah.
L:  In a very nice neighborhood, you know [SIGH] mu- -- much over the apartment complex they were living in.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so we turned to the girl who was, you know a -- a -- that had offered us the furniture and we said, "Hey, they're looking for a place to rent.  They're friends of yours, would you be interested in renting to them?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  And she was like, "You know, I hadn't thought about it but, yeah, that sounds like a good idea".
R:  Mhm.
L:  So they went through and they did it and we were gonna -- she had to move a month earlier --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- than she'd planned on and so it was like they had to move right in and we said, "Well, we'll rent a truck, we'll split the price on the truck, we'll take your stuff over and as we load your stuff in, we'll load our stuff which is all the furniture that was in the house, out on to the truck".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we got over there to -- to load the stuff in.  She said, "Why don't we just put our -- our stuff in the garage and we'll get the stuff later?"  And then it came around where they ended up keeping all the furniture, too.
R:  Oh.
L:  And -- so, yeah, that kind of put a real damp -- they got greedy.  As friends, they got greedy.
R:  How -- how long did you know these people?
L:  Oh,  [NOISE] I don't know, probably ten years.
R:  Mm.
L:  Eight years, maybe.
R:  That's still a long time.
L:  Yeah and, uh -- [NOISE] so we -- you know, we were like -- this was like all- -- almost new furniture that we really needed, you know.
R:  Right, mhm.
L:  Yeah, it would just be in storage and then they kinda said, "Well, maybe when you get a place we'll let you have it".  I'm going, "You mean, after your -- your demon spawn children have torn everything up?"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "And your -- your -- your dog has -- has ruined [LAUGH] all" --
R:  Right.
L:  "Everything, then we can have it?"
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I'm like I don't think so, you know, that's not --
R:  How -- how -- how has your relationship been since it --
L:  Well, it ended, boom, at that point.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah.
L:  It was like they weren't giving in, and we had already said, "Well you can keep this and you" --
R:  Have you spoken to them or have you tried to rekindle the friendship or is it ...?
L:  Well, it was kind of funny because here we were -- I had done a little business with the guy and I was -- [NOISE] I was -- I'd -- it was still a business thing, it wasn't a friendship thing.
