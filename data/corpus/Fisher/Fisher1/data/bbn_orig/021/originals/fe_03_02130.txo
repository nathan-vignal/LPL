R:  Hello, my name is Leigh.
L:  Hi, Leigh, I'm Laura.
R:  Laura, how are you?
L:  I'm okay.  How are you?
R:  Not too bad. [SIGH]
L:  Where are you calling from?
R:  Um, I'm from, ah, ah, Washington.
L:  The state of Washington?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Ca- --
R:  What about you?
L:  I'm in California.  
R:  Oh, not that far away.
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  Where about in California, by the way?
L:  Southern California.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Los Angeles area.
R:  Okay. [SIGH]  I'm in a little town called Bremerton.  I don't know if you ever head of it or not.
L:  Oh yes, I've heard of it but I don't know where it is.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's a small [SIGH] Navy town.  [SIGH] That's where all the, ah, [SIGH] ah -- a lot of the -- the ships that are in the Gulf War right now, they came from here, a couple of them did.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  So, but anyway the subject tonight is about, what?  Making friends, right?
L:  I think so. [LAUGH]
R:  Making -- I mean, I couldn't quite gather.  I -- I'm -- I have a couple of children of my own are running around here and I'm trying to listen to what's going on. [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I'm trying to listen to what's going on.  And [MN] it had to do with making acquaintances, I believe, something like that.
L:  W- well, I know it was something about friends but, yeah, I -- I didn't hear the rest of it.  I mean I [MN]--
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, w- well, I heard some of it, something about [MN] if we -- if you're easygoing and you make easy acquaintances --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or -- or you talk about close friends or something like.
L:  Yeah.  I m- I missed the first part of it because I had a bunch of static on my phone.  I figured, "Oh, well, the talk partner will know". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Well, you know, I j- [MN] why don't I see?  Um, p- personally for my self, you know, [NOISE] I'm -- I'm an easygoing guy, very sociable person.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I get along with everybody. [NOISE] And, ah, I -- I like to kid around a lot, especially at work.  And I -- any -- any time really.  I li- -- I've got a good sense of humor, but I make friends real easy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, ah, I guess we're supposed to talk about what the subjects about.  I've got some close friends, yeah.  But [SIGH] I've got a variety, a big variety of friends.  All different, ah, [NOISE] very, ah, ah, [MN] very different diversities [NOISE], different, ah, education, and I j- -- I guess just make friends real easy, to tell you the truth.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, I love -- love being around people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- speaking for myself.  [SIGH] My little one here, [SIGH] my youngest one, I have three children --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she wants me to play with her right now. [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I can't sweetheart, let me get off the phone first, okay?  Okay.  Ah, anyways, that's -- I don't know what else you [MN] you know, like I said, I make friends very easy.  What -- what about you?  Do you [MN]?
L:  Yeah.  I'm the same way, I'm easygoing, easy to get along with.  So, I have, um, a wide circle --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of -- of friends.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- but I have a few -- few really close friends --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- too, if you know what I mean by the difference?
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] Ah, you know, that brings up a question in my mind.  When you say close friends.  You don't mind me asking that, are they -- are they men or girls?  Or does it make -- I mean, ah [MN] ...
L:  I have both.  I'm single.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I have close male friends and close female friends.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I have, ah -- and I have close friends that are married and close friends that are not.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  And --
R:  You -- You -- [MN] um, do you confide in them --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- pretty often, I mean with [MN]--
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean is there [SIGH] certain, you know, [SIGH] -- I guess I shouldn't ask questions like that maybe.  You know, it's like with me, if I have a [SIGH], um, [LIPSMACK], ah, let's say -- let's say if I have a personal problem with my family, say, okay.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ah, I'm not -- I'm not the type of person that would go out and ask my friends, whether I am close with them or not, and ask them any type of, ah, advice or something like that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I'd rather just, ah, I guess my pride --
L:  Deal with it yourself.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, I'd deal with it myself.  [SIGH] But then --
L:  I don't know so much if I'm asking advice, as just having someone to bounce [MN]--
R:  [SIGH] Someone who looks at your situation objectively, maybe.
L:  Yeah.  Part of it, yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Or someone just so I could rant and stuff when I'm -- you know, when I feel a -- a sort of overwhelming, so ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I know when I was married, I was married for quite a while, but, um, just having another person there that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that I thought was sharing the burden was very helpful.  And, sort of, when you're single you don't have that.  But I do have a close circle of friends that I can share pretty much anything with and -- and they're always there.  But I have a wide variety of other friends and it's like, you know, this -- these -- this is the group of friends that I like, [MN] you know, do this thing with, and this is the group of friends that I do this with, and this is the group of friends that I do this with. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, it -- it's just kinda -- that's -- it's kinda weird that way.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, b- but do you have any children, by chance?
L:  I have three.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  I have three teenagers.
R:  Ooh.  [SIGH] Ooh.  I- I- I have, ah -- or I had one teenager, she's going to be twenty one here, very soon.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I've got two much younger children, but, ah, [LIPSMACK] ooh, teenage -- teenage years. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They are rough.
L:  Yeah, they are all three in high school.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, um, [LAUGH] I once seen this -- this, ah [LIPSMACK] sign on someone's refrigerator.  And it was -- it said something to the effect like, ah, ah, "You'd better ask your teenagers, ah, if you need advice ask your teenagers now while they know everything". [SIGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, something like that. [SIGH]  And, ah, and I'm thinking, "That's -- boy, oh boy, [SIGH] ah, if that doesn't hit the nail on the head".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, and I -- ooh -- I -- I'm sure I was the same way when I was a teenager, but it seems -- my gosh, now -- now the shoe's on the other foot and, you know, I see what my parents went through.  I think, "My God", my -- our teenager -- no one suffers as much as a teenager, no one has it as bad as a teenager --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- no one knows as much as a teenager.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] You know, I mean, there is no one in the world that suffers -- that has it as bad as a teenager does.
L:  Oh, God.
R:  You know?  A- and I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] [LAUGH]
L:  To some degree, yeah.  My kids get along -- they're really good kids, they get along with each other --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, they do well in school,
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they have lots of friends, they have -- get involved in extra curricular activities, I don't worry that they're involved in drugs, or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- any of that kind of stuff.  Um ...
R:  [MN]
L:  It's -- they -- in fact, I always say they're weird because if --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- if you were to ask them, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- any of the three to name your five best friends, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- two of the slots would [MN] be their -- what -- their siblings.
R:  Really?
L:  And I think that's really strange for teenage kids.
R:  Now, that's very special.
L:  So ...
R:  That's very special.  I wonder if they realize that?  How special that is to hear that.
L:  Yeah, they get along really, really well. 
R:  You know, --
L:  So ...
R:  -- teenagers -- [SIGH] teenagers definitely don't want to be associated with their parents.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They -- they -- they -- but to say that my brother and my sister are one of my best friends -- that's really something very special.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  Very unusual to hear.  [SIGH] What, ah, are they, ah, a boy, two boys and a girl, or what are you --
L:  No, my eldest and youngest are girls and then the son's in -- my son's in the middle.
R:  Ah.  And th- there about a year's difference in age, somewhere around there?
L:  A -- a year and a half.  There is three and a half years between the three of them, from the oldest to the youngest.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  So, they're pretty close in age.
R:  Oh, my gosh, and they get along pretty well.  That's rare. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Hey, you gotta pat yourself on the back there.
L:  Oh, they do -- they -- yeah.  Ah, yeah, my oldest got accepted into Berkley, so ...
R:  [NOISE] He got accepted where?
L:  Into Berkley.
R:  Really?
L:  So, yeah, we're really proud of that. [LAUGH]
R:  W- w- what does he plan on mastering in there?
L:  She, she, she.  She's going to go into psychology and some kind of writing, creative writing or screen writing.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  So, yeah.
R:  Wow, you got something to be very proud of there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  W- What's his name, by chance?
L:  Her.  Her name's Kerry.
R:  Oh, I'm sorry, her.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm sorry, her. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's okay.
R:  [MN]
L:  Her name's Kerry.
R:  Terry, you said?
L:  Kerry with a K..
R:  Ah, ah, okay, okay, okay. [SIGH]  Yeah, ah, um, okay [SIGH].  I'm trying to think what else to say here about that.
L:  So ...
R:  What we are supposed to be talking about? [LAUGH]
L:  She is a lot like you, she had a wide circle of friends.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  It's very interesting, whereas, my son has a very small close knit circle, and he's like a lot more -- he -- I mean, you would -- he's a lot more, ah, not so, what's the word?  Greg- gregarious?  You know, not so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't how to explain it.  But --
R:  Yeah.  W- w- what ages are we talking about here?
L:  My oldest is eighteen.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Eighteen in a week. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And my son's sixteen and a half, and my youngest is fourteen.
R:  Okay.  And -- do the -- ah, the eldest, do they want to drive?  Do they -- or do they drive already?
L:  Ah, my son drives, but he doesn't have his licence.  And the other, my -- my daughter, the eighteen year old, does not like driving and does not want [LAUGH] to drive. 
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now that soun- -- that's kind of unusual.  I mean, she's afraid to drive, you mean?  Is that what you mean?
L:  Yeah.  She gets nervous.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  She doesn't l-
R:  A- d- -- was she involved in a -- or does she know someone who was involved in an accident or something like that?  I mean, why she would ...
L:  Well, before -- I -- I always wanted the kids to drive before they were sixteen.
R:  Yeah.
L:  In case of an emergency or something.  And when my oldest was fourteen she was d-, um, driving the car and drove over a neighbor's lawn --
R:  W- What?
L:  -- and he came out and berated her.
R:  Oh, argh.
L:  So, she -- and she's the type of person that's so -- that, you know, she just feels really, really -- she felt bad enough without him having to come out and do that.
R:  I see.
L:  And, so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ever since then she's like, "Mom, you made me" you know, whatever.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  And she's -- I mean, it's been however many years?  Four years, and I still hear about that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that I made her do that.
R:  T- there's a little guilt there too, huh?
L:  Yeah, --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- a little.
R:  Yeah, well [SIGH] [LAUGH] --
L:  And there was another time when we were driving and -- and, um, it was on a dirt road, going up a -- I did not know this when we -- when I got out of the car and traded seats with her.  I -- I was going up to visit a friend and it was like in the back country.  And I'm thinking, "There's not going to be any cars --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- or traffic.  Um, she can go, you know thirty five and whatever".  Well, it ended up being a one lane windy road up a hill with no rails. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's just --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's quite the opposite of what you expect.
L:  Yes.  So I had never been there before.  It's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it's like after we got started I told her later, I said -- 'cause we -- the funny thing is we just went up there again the beginning of April, and she was reliving this horrific experience driving up there.
R:  Oh, yeah, okay, okay. 
L:  And I said -- you know what?  I -- I didn't realize the road was going to be like this and I didn't want to say, "Pull off and let me drive" because I wanted her to have the confidence.
R:  Sure.
L:  I didn't want to, y- you know, tell her, "I don't think you can do it".
R:  I would have done the same thing.
L:  "So, get over" you know.
