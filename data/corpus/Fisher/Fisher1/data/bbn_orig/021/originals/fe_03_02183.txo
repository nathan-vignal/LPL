L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, this Deanne.
L:  Hi, Deanne, my name is Olga.  How are you?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  I'm good, thanks. [MN]
R:  This is my first time doing this, so --
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, this is my second call --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so [LAUGH] I've already had one.
R:  Oh, okay. [NOISE]
L:  Um, it's -- it's really fun.
R:  Oh.
L:  Oh, I hear a baby.
R:  Yes, I have a little one.
L:  Oh, how fun.
R:  How about you?
L:  Um, I don't.
R:  Okay.
L:  No, I'm, ah, still looking for a husband. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I finally found that so -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  There's a -- there's some good ones out there. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, good.  Well then, I'm s- -- I'm sure I shall come across one soon. [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, so we're supposed to talk about whether we like to eat at home or in a restaurant.
R:  Well, I guess, really, person- -- personally speaking, myself, I guess it depends on the occasion.
L:  Yeah, I think that too, 'cause sometimes I think making food at home is really fun.
R:  Right, like sometimes um, like, I -- I belong to this, like -- you -- you get like, a recipe each day on the web.
L:  Oh, how fun.
R:  Yeah, and I really -- I really enjoy making some of the meals, because, you know, it's something new, rather than always having the same old thing at home.  But sometimes like, [SIGH] I -- I love cooking for my relatives, but I have a very big family so sometimes [LAUGH] it's really --
L:  So it's a big production. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, exactly, and it's a lot of clean up.  Even with -- even if you do paper plates, it's still a lot of clean up.  So in --
L:  It is, yeah.  Well there's always pots and pans and stuff.  Yeah, I think, definitely, like, I -- y- -- making meals at home is much more of a commitment --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  An- -- and, I mean, i- -- it -- sometimes y- -- the one thing, though about eating at home is portion control, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how like, just eating healthier.  'Cause sometimes when you go to a restaurant [LAUGH] they give you like, this por- -- you know -- just the portions they give --
L:  Oh they do.  They give you tons of food and you go, "I can't possibly eat all this" --
R:  And you try and eat it, while you're there, you know, you don't think about it.  So --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's definitely not -- not as cool.
R:  No.
L:  No.
R:  [NOISE] But, I mean, um, in fact I'm cooking right now, as we speak, so --
L:  Oh, cool.  What are you making?
R:  I am making floppy joes with [NOISE] pirogies [NOISE] and broccoli.
L:  Oh, how fun.
R:  So --
L:  I love pirogies.
R:  Yeah, so do I. [LAUGH]
L:  Pirogies are, like, ul- -- ultimate. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, they are.  They're so good.  Now, I'm not making homemade pirogies, but I'm just making regular, you know, the ones --
L:  Well, you can get good ones now --
R:  Yeah, well -- 
L:  --and, you know --
R:  -- and they're cheap.  So that's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the -- well, that's the other thing about eating at home now -- it's much -- like, the one thing we notice -- my husband and I both used to work, and when I had the baby, I decided to come home and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I work -- I work part time from home, I telecommute now.
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  And he works full time.  The one thing we notice is our -- we haven't been spending as much money because we used to go out to eat all the time when we worked.  So after we'd get off work we'd go out to eat, or if we were at lunch, like -- because we worked in the same place, we would go to lunch together, and we were spending exorbitant amounts of money each month on that.
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it is a lot.  It adds up fast.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, so it -- yeah, eating at home is definitely more cost effective.
R:  Yes.  So, for that reason, too, I mean, de- -- and with a baby for us, you know, it -- it's -- it's just wiser, you know.
L:  Yeah, you -- and you can't really take the baby out and have like, a quiet, peaceful meal [LAUGH] and eat.
R:  No, not any more. [LAUGH]
L:  No, the baby is not into that. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah, that's very true.
L:  Yeah, I mean, you have to get somebody to watch the baby, and it just becomes even more of a production.
R:  Right, exactly.  It's like, we -- we try to do it, my husband and I now, we try to do like, once a month we have what's called date night.
L:  Oh, cute.
R:  Yeah, it's very nice.  We go out.  We literally have like, our old dates, like what we used to do.  Like, we'll go to the movies and go to dinner and [NOISE] have like, a really nice peaceful dinner, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah --
R:  And have a couple of --
L:  -- well I think that's a great idea.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's great that you're making time for that.
R:  You have to.  You really do.
L:  I -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  Yeah, I think that too, but you'd be surprised how many people don't even think about it.
R:  Right, and they're the people who are totally probably whacked and stressed out by the point, you know what I mean, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It -- it -- it's a lot, i- it's a lot.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you really need it. [NOISE] 
L:  I don't --
R:  Specially for your --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- for your -- you know, just for your -- yourself, so.
L:  You do -- well, you need this for your relationship --
R:  Right.
L:  -- 'cause it really just gives you an opportunity to -- to bond all over again and get to know each other all over again --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- which you don't have time for when you're with the baby and, you know, you're doing stuff at home and [MN] you know, all that.
R:  Right.  Well, what -- what kind of -- like, if you go out to eat, where do you -- what's like, your favorite place, to eat at?
L:  Um, I -- I like Japanese food.
R:  Okay.
L:  A lot. [LAUGH]
R:  I was thinking, "Oh, I love Japanese food" and, ah, where do you live? [NOISE]
L:  LA.
R:  LA.  Okay.  Well, I live, um, outside of Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And there [NOISE] is this incredible Japanese food [NOISE] place, um, [NOISE] it's like, literally like, the sush- -- they have sushi that like, sits on a -- it's like a -- how do I describe it?
L:  [MN]
R:  Oh, God.  It -- it sits on this like, belt.  And the belt --
L:  Oh, okay like, it's -- 
R:  -- comes around.
L:  Oh yeah we have those too.
R:  Do you?
L:  Todai[?]
R:  It's -- what's it called?  It's called -- something easy, like The Spot or something like that, it's called.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah, we have those too, and it comes by and you just take off --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- whatever you want, yeah.
R:  It's so neat.
L:  It's so fun.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, I love sushi and also 'cause I can't really make it at home, 'cause --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- I don't know enough about fish.
R:  Right.
L:  So -- and that's one thing I always try to do if I go out.  I try to have food that I can't make at home.
R:  Yeah, that's a great idea, because, you know, there are things like, why do you even want to [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, like --
R:  -- spend two hours in the kitchen? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah,  ex- -- exactly.  Like, I'm not going to go out and have something I can make at home, 'cause I'd rather make it at home and [LAUGH] I know I'm gonna like it better, if I make it. [LAUGH]
R:  Right. Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] So I always try to have stuff that's either like, super, super fancy that I just would never take that much time.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, or stuff like, you know, that I can't do just because I don't know enough about it, like sushi --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- and stuff.
R:  Now, out in LA do you guys [NOISE] have good Italian restaurants? [NOISE]
L:  You know, it's -- actually it's funny that you mention that 'cause I was just talking to somebody about how we don't have enough.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  I mean, we have good ones --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but they're like, super, super expensive.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  And then we have like, two good ones --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that aren't that that expensive, but not like -- 'cause I know in Pennsylvania you guys have just Italian restaurants --
R:  Oh, it's --
L:  -- everywhere.
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's like, the -- that's pretty much the cornerstone of meals here. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we don't have that, and it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there was a lot of times that I missed that, 'cause I just love Italian.
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  And it's -- you know, I'll make it but I get really obsessive about it, like I like to make my own pasta [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I like to make my own sauce and stuff.
R:  Oh, well, you gotta make you own sauce.  Now that's --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- that's one of the things that a lot of like, [NOISE] I don't really [NOISE] like to eat at those Italian restaurants like t- -- like the Olive Garden.
L:  Yeah, I don't like those either --
R:  Yeah, 'cause you --
L:  -- 'cause that's not real.
R:  Yeah, why don't I just go out and buy myself a frozen dinner and cook it [NOISE], you know, because they pretty much taste the same.
L:  I know --
R:  But --
L:  -- I'm like that too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And like, I ha- -- it has to be totally real and I want to like --
R:  Oh, it's a shame --
L:  -- see the --
R:  -- you don't live out this way.  We sound like two connoisseurs here, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] yeah. [MN]
R:  Uh, [NOISE] are you still there?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh, okay.  Um, I mean, I guess [NOISE] when it c- -- you know, it's the different food, I guess it depends on.  Like, we have some really good Italian restaurants and my husband's Italian, so --
L:  Oh, good.
R:  -- he likes -- he loves -- loves -- absolutely loves Italian food.  So, you know, [NOISE] we go out and we find like, the best places to have, you know the homemade pasta, and the --
L:  Oh, that's awesome.
R:  -- you know the sauce ...
L:  Yeah, fresh pasta is like heaven.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I love fresh pasta. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, it really is. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, no- -- there's nothing that tastes like that, so ...
L:  Yeah.  D- do you get -- if your mother in law's Italian, you must get a lot of great recipes from her.
R:  Oh, yeah, and I get totally fed when I go over there. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Nice.
R:  [LAUGH] See now she's --
L:  [LAUGH] Do [several inaudible words].
R:  -- somebody who loves to cook at home.  Like, that woman -- you could- -- like, the other -- we were there for Easter and she's like, "Oh, I just -- I just didn't make that much this year", and like -- I'm looking at the table going, "What is she talking about?"  She made like, roasted peppers with onions and --
L:  Oh, God, I love her --
R:  -- a whole ham and --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- deviled eggs and potato salad --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- macaroni salad, pasta salad, um, she cut up cheese and pepperoni, she made this pepperoni [LAUGH] bread.
L:  Mm.  Oh, God --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that sounds so fun. [LAUGH]
R:  And she made so much food and I'm like, looking at her like, "What, are you crazy?"  You know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  she's like, "Oh, I didn't make enough". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible].
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] Mom's are always like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're like, "Have more food".  You're like, "I couldn't possibly".
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Well, that's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the thing.  It's like, I -- I -- you know, "I can't eat any more".  She's like, "Oh, come on, munza[?] munza, you know.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, I love that.  That's great.  And I mean -- well, you get to take leftovers home.  That's always fun --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- too.
R:  Yeah, oh, well that's -- that's -- I think that's my husband's favorite part.  'Cause he --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- gets to eat like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- ah, at work, he's like, "Oh, I'm eating so good this week".  I'm like, [NOISE] "Hey, what does that mean?"  You know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] "What are you trying to say about my food?" [LAUGH] So ...
L:  [LAUGH] Fun.  So, what else do you guys like to go out for.
R:  Um --
L:  What --
R:  -- I would say Italian's our main thing.  I love like, Chinese foods.  Um, we have a restaurant around us here.  It's um, literally [MN] -- they have an open fire pl- -- pit in the center of the place --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and you -- you cook your own food.  So you go --
L:  Oh, yeah, okay like --
R:  -- up to the desk
