L:  You're a baby.
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I'm not a baby. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Uh --
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, well, I like to -- I like eating at home.  I mean, once in a while I like -- it's hard to go out with kids.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  That is true, but --
L:  We have to do this for ten minutes?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I guess.  Have you ever done this before?
L:  Well, no.  This is my first time.
R:  [LAUGH] Me too.  I heard about --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- this on the internet, and I was like, "Hey". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, one of the girls that I knew -- I used to work at a diner, um, I'm -- I'm, er, in the restaurant business, so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, what are your favorite restaurants?
R:  Um, I guess [NOISE] McDonalds and Taco Bell are my favorite ones --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I like those two.
L:  Yeah, they're for kids all right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I like Steak n Shake too though.
L:  Steak n Shake?  Where do you live?
R:  Indiana.
L:  Indiana, wow.  I'm in Pennsylvania.  We don't have Steak n Shakes around here.
R:  [LAUGH] Really?
L:  I know of them from Florida.
R:  It's really good.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, um, when we're in Florida at my sister in laws, we go to Steak n Shake a lot.
R:  It's the best.  I love it.
L:  But we have plenty of Taco Bells and McDonalds around here.
R:  Yeah, those are everywh- [LAUGH] -- those are like everywhere.
L:  Yeah [SIGH], but, um, I don't know, I guess I just like to cook.  I enjoy cooking.  I like to order out.  I live in Pennsylvania, so, [SIGH] we have, uh, steaks and hoagie.  Have you ever heard of a hoagie?
R:  Huh?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, well, we have like -- you know, that's where they originated, here, so, it's always good to order out and then eat at home. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because they're a dime a dozen around here.
R:  Yeah, hoagies is pretty good.  I've had some of those before.
L:  Have you had 'em before?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where, uh -- from this area or ...?
R:  Oh, just like -- no, I've never been over there, but they make them like [LAUGH] around here in Indiana too.
L:  They're not the same. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I'm sure they have -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that [LAUGH] just like everybody --
L:  They're definitely not the same.
R:  Really?  So, are they like bigger there or what -- what more[?] do they do there?
L:  Well, they -- th- they slice their lunch meat real thin and [SIGH] we have just the best bread, uh, er, it's the rolls that make it, and the rolls in this area are just out of this world. [SIGH] I have, um, family in Marilyn[?], Virginia, Florida, and like, you just can not get bread made like the rolls -- the Italian rolls, made the way they're made in this area --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- which makes them so much [NOISE] different.
R:  I must have to come down there just to [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- eat one.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Actually, go up there [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I guess it is up, isn't it?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, above Indiana [SIGH].  I was like, "Go down there". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What other kind of restaurants do you like?
R:  [SIGH] Um, I go to Denny's a lot actually, um --
L:  Denny's?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, they're good for breakfast.
R:  Yeah, they're really good.  
L:  I like, um, little family owned restaurants --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- instead of like, the chain restaurants.
R:  Yeah, there's not that many around here.  I mean, like --
L:  Yeah, we have a l- -- just area is just all food.  We're like the fattest state in the country.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  The fattest city in the country I should say.  There's a lot of like, little family owned, like bar restaurants type, that you go for seafood, hot roast beef sandwiches, that kind of stuff.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I like to do that.  In fact, my husband and I went out to eat the other night for the first time, I can't tell you how long.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We just went to the bar, had a couple of drinks and a sandwich [NOISE].  It was different [NOISE].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How old's your baby?
R:  [SIGH] Um, she's three months old.
L:  Oh, God.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I have a four and a nine year old.
R:  She's unhappy.
L:  Yeah, you have to ignore [NOISE] her for ten minutes, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I know [NOISE].
L:  Gives you a break. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Wait til they get older, you'll be dying to turn them off.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I could ask her what she likes to eat, but she'll just say, "Milk"[?]. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  She just wants her formula [NOISE].  Do you breast feed? [NOISE]
R:  No --
L:  No. [NOISE]
R:  -- um, I tried to, in the hospital [NOISE], but she had like problems [NOISE] --
L:  Oh. [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] she's lactose intolerant and everything --
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  -- so --
L:  -- that stinks. [SIGH] [NOISE]
R:  [several inaudible words] [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Um, what [NOISE] I guess I sh- -- guess we should ask, what's your favorite food at McDonalds? [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I guess, if I -- if it's lunch time, I like the fish sandwich, but if it's during breakfast, I like to get the -- I get the big breakfast, 'cause they're like less than three dollars, and you get all that food.
L:  Yeah, right, the big break- -- I like the, uh, the steak in bagel.
R:  Oh, those are good too.
L:  Oh, yeah, but it's just full of fat, I mean, it's just --
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  -- just fat.  Um, fish sandwiches are actually my favorite at McDonalds too.
R:  Oh, I know.  Uh, it's like everybody's -- [LAUGH].
L:  How about, uh, Taco Bell?
R:  Um, at Taco Bell, I like the chilli cheese burritos they have here, or a taco salad.
L:  Taco salad.  I like the MexiMelts.
R:  Oh, those are good too.
L:  I make those at home, in, um, my George Foreman fryer or my George Foreman grill.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Just cook taco meat, from ground meat, and you get flour tortillas, and you put the cheese in it, and you put it in the, um, [LIPSMACK] -- in the George Foreman fryer and it toasts both sides.  Er, they're not as steamed, but they're toasted.  They're really good.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  They sound good. I'd like the recipe.
L:  My kids like those, so, I make those a lot --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- for dinner.
R:  -- I have a George Foreman grill too, 'cause those are, so, oh, man, those are so good.
L:  Right.
R:  Right.  I love them.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But, uh, [NOISE] -- it's in the, uh, duh, basket with her, uh, cleats.  My daughter's getting her pictures taken for baseball today.
R:  Oh.
L:  So ...
R:  I can't wait til she's old enough [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- get her in all that cool stuff.
L:  It's fun.  My son, er, can't start til next year [NOISE], so, I have [NOISE] to wait [NOISE] --
R:  Right now, my little --
L:  -- til next year.
R:  My little sweet is lazing there and wants to[?] --
L:  Right, now, how did you hear about this?
R:  Um, on the internet.
L:  On the internet?
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  My girlfriend -- oh, a girl that I knew, [SIGH] is a professor --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- at the University of Penn --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and she emailed me about it. [NOISE]
R:  That's neat.
L:  Yeah, so, [NOISE] --
R:  I guess we'll get paid like [NOISE] ten dollars a call or something.
L:  Yeah --
R:  That's cool.
L:  -- and they say, like, at least three calls --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but then they say they -- they would use you more, I guess, if [NOISE] your calls work out right, or something, and then if you refer people, you get five dollars a person, or ...
R:  Yeah, something like that.
L:  -- something like that.
R:  I didn't hear all about it.  They just told us you get like ten [LAUGH] dollars --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] --
R:  -- for doing it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm like --
L:  Do you, uh, a lot of freebie sites on the internet?
R:  [SIGH] Um, yeah, sometimes.
L:  What's your favorite freebie site?
R:  Um, Violation is where I found it.  It's Violation for freebies or something it's called.

L:  You got to talk when she's, uh, going for her naps.
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH]

L:  I think it's each call.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's cool.
L:  Like I said [NOISE], they said up to three calls, and then like the [several inaudible words] [NOISE] says they could use for more.

L:  So, you would think they -- a lot of times you think they're twins.  You yell at one, and you're yelling at the other one.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's crazy. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]

R:  Right.
L:  -- because of it.
R:  That's cool.
L:  Yeah, I took all them out to dinner --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- Saturday night.  I took seven of them out to dinner, to a pizza shop, and, uh, it cost me fifty bucks.  I actually lost money that night babysitting --
