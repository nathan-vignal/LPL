R:  Miami.
L:  Miami.  I'm in, uh, Texas.

L:  -- meeting people from all over. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  So, um, is this your first call?
L:  [SIGH] No, no.  This is my, uh, my third.
R:  Oh, okay.  This is my second.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH] Um, okay, so friends. [LAUGH]
L:  Friends, um [LIPSMACK] well, I have -- I have a really wonderful friend, um, back east.  We just moved to Texas --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I kinda miss my friends. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  But I speak to them almost every day. [LAUGH]
R:  Really. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um--
L:  Which is great so -- but --
R:  She's been your friend for a long time?
L:  Uh, yeah, about thirty years.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  So [MN] --
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah, we -- we all have married children so we kinda have all flown the coup a little bit but, um --
R:  Right.
L:  But fr- -- good friends are hard to come by.
R:  It is, that's true.
L:  It's really --
R:  That's true.
L:  You know.  Have you always lived in Miami?
R:  Um, no, I -- I've lived, um -- I grew up here and I'm just temporarily liv- -- temporarily living here now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um -- [LIPSMACK]
L:  [MN]
R:  I have a best friend here from Miami that we've literally been best friends since we were babies, like one years old.
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.
R:  So, we've been friends for almost twenty five years.
L:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK]
R:  And, um, and she was my maid of honor and I was her maid of honor for our weddings. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] That's great.
R:  And --
L:  That really is. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have you -- well, was she the reason that you moved back to Miami?
R:  No, no, not really.  I mean, we're, you know, still doing our thing, you know, um, pretty much newly weds and doing our own thing, um, but we keep in touch easily.
L:  Uh-huh. [MN]
R:  You know, try to visit each other and when I -- since -- all my family's in Miami, when I do come in to town I, um, obviously make a point to see her.
L:  Well, I would a -- yeah, I would assume so. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is she also a newly wed or, uh ...?
R:  Yes, she is.
L:  Wow.
R:  Pretty much.
L:  That's, um -- that's great, though, that you can, you know, be friends after all these years.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, for --
R:  I mean, I have a lot of friends but, um -- at least when I was younger in high school I -- I had a -- a big, little -- well, like a clique of friends, you know, or group of friends but at the same time I've always been the -- I don't know, like I saw a friend from high school I haven't seen in years and they're -- they remember me as the person who was friends with everybody. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's nice --
R:  You know, like, it didn't matter if they were, like --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, the weird kids that dressed in black or, you know --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- the kids that were -- played sports or the ki- -- you know, nerdy kids that got good grades.  I pretty much was --
L:  I think that's a credit to you, really.
R:  -- friendly with everyone. [LAUGH]
L:  That's wonderful.
R:  But I just have my few handpicked, you know, best friends.
L:  But there's certain people that you're usually more friendly with than others.
R:  Yeah, and -- and I also feel like you have best friends through different stages of your life 'cause even though my friend for twenty five years is, you know, gonna, you know -- been my best friend and going to be, uh, my best friend I feel like, um -- when I was in college I had a best friend in college.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, like we were studying the same thing and, um, you know, we just formed a -- a close relationship, really good friends, and, you know, when I was in high school --
L:  But those are the kind of relationships you'll have throughout the years.
R:  Yeah --
L:  I --
R:  I mean, I -- I feel like you -- you do have different best friends in accordance to the different experiences you're having in your life.
L:  Oh, absolutely.  I re-  -- no, 'cause I remember -- well, I still keep in touch with my roommate from college and that was forty years ago. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, it's, um, you know -- we don't see each other as much as we would like to --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- but, um, th- -- thank goodness for, um, computers. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because we sp- -- you know, we speak over the computer 'cause --
R:  I know, thank goodness for the internet. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, you know, and it makes -- it does make life a whole lot easier.
R:  It does.
L:  Um, especially when you're not around your family --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [COUGH] -- or friends, so, um -- no, that's really great [MN] um --
R:  Uh, yeah, yeah.  So, um -- I don't know, um --
L:  I don't know, old friends.  Um --
R:  Um --
L:  I don't know, that's -- that's -- family was easier. [LAUGH]
R:  Family. [LAUGH] Family was a little hard, too, I mean, eight minutes to talk about it all. [LAUGH]
L:  No, family we had no problem with.  I mean, we were chatting till -- oh, till they told us to stop.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  [SIGH] So, um -- do you have any children?
R:  No, no, I don't.
L:  Okay, 'cause they --
R:  Mhm, not yet, no thanks. [LAUGH]
L:  That's -- that's when you really see who your true friends are. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And your kids' friends and --
R:  'Cause, I mean, you -- you have an idea of what your friends are growing up, when you're a kid, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  You think someone's your best friend.  And, I mean, in a sense they are because they are for that time period in your life.  I guess, for those experiences, you know, like maybe elementary school or what -- what not but --
L:  Well, they're important part of your life.
R:  They are, they are and, you know -- but I -- I feel like you do have one or two that is just prevalent in your life.
L:  Oh, it's -- it's usually that way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, like this friend that I, um, have back east.
R:  They're like family, almost.
L:  They are like family and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I still have one child that lives back east --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, came the holidays and he said, "Well, I'm going to Aunt Phyllis" and I said, "Okay, that's fine".  I -- he says, "It's family".
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, because --
R:  It is, it is.
L:  It was -- and it -- it really is because her children and my children grew up together, basically.
R:  Right.
L:  And I'm glad that he has family back there, people back there that he can still call family.
R:  Right.
L:  And, uh, doesn't have to be alone for the holidays and things like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, uh -- but, you know, it's hard --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when you leave one child behind. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  And even though he's not a chi- -- child anymore. [LAUGH]
R:  To you, it's, uh, your baby. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, no, he's not my baby, he's my older one and he's forty one, so -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But it's still, you -- you -- you know, you just want --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- them around you, no matter what [LIPSMACK] 'cause I know since we moved back -- uh, moved to Texas, um, it has been wonderful spending time with my other children.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It really has and, um, they lived here for about ten years before we even thought about moving.
R:  Oh.
L:  Uh, so it's, um -- it's great, it really is and, um, they come every Friday night for dinner. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, they bring their friends.
R:  And where were you before that you, um --
L:  We were in Maryland.
R:  So you said that you miss your friend from ...
L:  [COUGH] Okay, we were in Maryland.
R:  Oh, in Maryland.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  
L:  So, uh --
R:  And that's where your friend -- is that where you met her or ...?
L:  Yeah, we met -- I don't know, we met right after we had moved there 'cause we -- we moved to Maryland right after we got married.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We moved from New York.
R:  And that was, like, thirty years ago?
L:  I've been married forty two years. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So -- but shortly after we moved there we, um, met.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, uh, we've been really good friends ever since.
R:  Wow.
L:  It's just um --
R:  That's really good.
L:  Yeah, you know, so her kids and my kids --
R:  You can meet really good friends later on in life, I mean --
L:  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, I felt like a fish in a fry -- you know, out of  water because I -- we knew nobody --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- um, when my husband got transferred but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was just wonderful.  I mean, it was like everybody took you in with open arms.
R:  Really.
L:  And it's -- and it's really a close community.
R:  And were you always -- I mean --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Were you pretty much just you and her as friends?
L:  Oh, no, no.
R:  Did you have a bigger group of friends or ...?
L:  We had a whole group of friends but she was always the one special person.
R:  The main one, right.
L:  You took up the phone, you know.
R:  I've been the -- you know, have a group of friends here and there.  You know, like I had a -- I had a lot smaller group of friends in college than I did in high school but my, um, husband is the exact opposite.  He's always had, like, very few friends, you know.
L:  Oh, that's sad.
R:  Like if we go down lists of friends -- and -- and, I mean, and -- he's just different.  To him it's, um, you know, you just be close to a few people, you know --
L:  A few, yeah.
R:  -- that you have a lot of trust in and -- and, you know, you want to share things with them and -- and I'm kinda like that, too, but at the same time I guess I'm a more, you know --
L:  A more open person. 
R:  -- social --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- person.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He's not really that social --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- as probably, uh -- so I'm more like -- I  -- I have these little groups of friends but I do have my few good friends, you know, that I would confide in and rely on and --
L:  And I'm sure that, you know, as he gets to know them more he'll, you know, consider their husbands or whomever good friends, too.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, and I'm not considering it a bad thing, that's just his personality, um --
L:  Oh, everybody has such a different personality --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- and, uh --
R:  That's just his personality.
L:  I mean, it's -- it's really terrific.  I know, we just went back to New York, uh, for my husband's, uh, forty fifth reunions. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I hate to say that.  Wow. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it was just so good, great, because here he spent the -- you know, this time, four years in college with all these gentlemen.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And, um, it was wonderful.  I mean, it was like no time had passed. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  Like we were all back in --
R:  Old memories and --
L:  Right, it -- it was just --
R:  -- you could stay up talking forever,
L:  Yeah, we, uh -- [LAUGH] we -- we even said we're going to have to make it more than once every five years now --
R:  Right.
L:  -- since we're all getting so much older, thank goodness.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um, it -- it -- it's the kind of -- those are the kind of friends that you don't speak to every day or every week but you know they're there.
R:  It's really good to catch up, you know they're there.
L:  And -- right, and god forbid you ever need 'em they're there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Which is very important so, uh -- but it was fun, it really was fun after not seeing -- some people we hadn't seen in over forty years. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  So, uh -- but [SIGH] -- and you'll -- and I guess you'll see when your chil- -- when you have children a lot --
R:  Their interactions.
L:  You'll make a whole new set of friends.
R:  Mhm.  Oh, like the moms, probably.
L:  Right.
