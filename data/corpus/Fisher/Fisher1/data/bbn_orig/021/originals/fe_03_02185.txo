R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  My name's Jeremy.
R:  Hey, Jeremy.  I'm Rob.
L:  Nice to meet you Rob.
R:  Nice to meet you.  Where you calling from?
L:  Ah, Alabama.
R:  Okay.  I'm calling from Los Angeles.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, my wife is from California.  She's from ah, Seamy[?] valley --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know where that is?
R:  Oh?  I do know where that is, indeed.  Up north.  It's nice up there.
L:  Yep, yep.  That's what she keeps telling me.
R:  [MN] Yeah.  So where in Alabama?
L:  Uh, close to Huntsville.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It's in northern Alabama.
R:  Sure, okay.  I know where that is. [SIGH]
L:  So, the topic of today is food -- [SIGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and whether I'd prefer to eat out or eat at home.
R:  All right.
L:  See, that -- that's kinda a tricky question, 'cause I love to cook, myself --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I love to eat at home --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but at the same time, you know, there are times when I just want to go out to eat, because you know, it's always fun to eat in a like, a -- a newer atmosphere, or something like that, you know.  Like --
R:  Sure, absolutely.
L:  You -- you can't go to -- I -- I don't have a Mexican theme in my house, so you know, I can make pahitas[?] here, and they're good --
R:  But its just not quite the same.
L:  You know, but -- yeah.
R:  Right.  I like --
L:  So, I like to go out to eat [SIGH], but I can't afford to go out to eat all the time.
R:  Right.
L:  So I like the -- I like the atmosphere of going out to eat and I -- but I also love to cook, I mean love to cook, but it seems like every time I cook, I always end up trying to make some kind of pasta.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because Italian food is really hard to cook. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  And it -- it's good [SIGH] but it -- it always ends up being more of a mess to have to clean up, so I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- would wager to say that I think I like eating out more than I do eating at home, 'cause then at least I don't have to worry about cleaning it all up --
R:  Cleaning up afterwards.
L:  -- and you know, and I still get --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- the good meal.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
L:  However, you know, to cook that same type meal I can make it and I'll have enough to eat it for two to three days, but you know, I'll end up spending about the same amount as I would if I went out to eat.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  Well, when I get -- you know, when we like, say we make Swedish meat balls at home --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we'll end up buying enough stuff to make like, five pounds worth of Swedish meat balls --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so we can eat it for like, four or five days between me, my wife and out son.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, that way it's cheaper to buy in bulk than it is to just buy like, one pound of meat when you can buy a big five pound thing and get the discount.  So 
R:  Right.
L:  So we end up just usually buying in bulk.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'll end up cooking this big grand meal for us all.  We'll eat it for like, two or three days until we're sick of eating the same thing, even though it is --
R:  Right.
L:  -- good food.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But on -- at the same note you know, whenever you go out to a restaurant, you see the thing is, I always get on to my wife because we'll go out to eat --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she'll always order the exact same thing off the menu, every time. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you go to the same place every time?
L:  Well, no.  It's just like, you know, we'll -- say we go to Olive Garden.
R:  Mhm.
L:  She knows exactly what she likes there, so rather than experimenting and getting something different --
R:  Right.
L:  -- she'll just get the same thing she always gets from Olive Garden.  Uh, you know, I'm that way with Mexican, 'cause you know, if we go out to eat, no matter where we go for Mexican, I'm gonna get pahitas.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, but whenever I go somewhere I generally try and get something new --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- every time.  That way I can experiment, broaden my horizons, see if I like something more than I -- I thought I did.
R:  Right.
L:  You know like, I don't know if you go out to eat a lot, and I --
R:  All the time, actually.  I hate -- I -- I don't hate to cook, I just don't -- I live by myself so I'm not really motivated to do it very often.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So like, I'll basically make breakfast for myself and the other two meals I'll tend to eat out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, or I'll make something at the studio and -- which I guess is sort of making -- making your own food.  But, um --
L:  In a way it is but you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- chances are if you're throwing something toge- -- ah, together at work, it's something real quick that you can, chances are, just nuke.
R:  Right.
L:  And you know, that's not really the same thing -- I mean, in a way it's the same thing, but you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's not the same thing as sitting down and cooking for like, three hours trying to flap together this meal with all the sides and all that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stuff.
R:  I probably -- I don't think I've done that in the last ten years, to tell you the truth.
L:  I just recently started to do it, since me and my wife got together, 'cause you know, I used to could not cook to save my life.  I would --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, burn macaroni and cheese. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  That's --
L:  I was like horrible, and then you know, she taught me a couple of things about cooking like, step one --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- do not cook meat on high.
R:  Right.
L:  So, you know.  Stuff like that, just little pointers, and from there, you know, from that and from, you know, my mother's advice and my father, who also loved to grill out. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, from the tricks they te- -- taught me and what she taught me, I started learning to cook more and more --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- and you know, I'd generally get online, find recipes, you know, try and cook something new so -- I'm not sure whether it would you know, it's such a -- an honest debate in my head, whether I like to cook more at home --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because I enjoy, you know, learning how to cook all this stuff --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- but I end up trying to cook basically the same thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Usually some form of chicken.
R:  Gotcha.
L:  Huh.
R:  Gotcha.  Well, that's amazing, man.  That's really great that you ah, you put all -- you put all that much time into it.  I'm -- I'm very impressed with that.
L:  Well, i- it's more or less the thing of you know, as much as I love to do it, I think it means more to my wife and my son --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that I actually put forth all this effort to try and cook --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- a really good meal for them.
R:  Oh, sure.  That's true.
L:  So, you know, it makes me feel good to know that they're happy, that I actually did something to try and, you know, make their day happier and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- go by quicker and you know, just a little surprise for them. 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But if I had the money, chances are I'd go out to eat a lot.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Chances are I'd eat it out back almost like, every night of the week. 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  'Cause I'd love those Kookaburra[?] wings, just --
R:  Um --
L:  -- cannot not get them.
R:  That's good stuff man.  That's good stuff.
L:  Got my friend that goes there and everytime he goes there he gets the blooming[?] onion.  And I'm not a real big onion fan.
R:  Right.
L:  I like the way onion flavor is like, if you cook it with something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I don't like the texture of onions, unless like, you can cook an onion enough to where it's like, you -- you know, almost has no texture, it's just real chewy, you know, and you can't taste it.  Usually if it's boiled in something.
R:  Right.
L:  [LIPSMACK] That's about the only way I'll get -- I'll get my onions, you know, and usually that's in something like chili, so 
R:  Ah, okay.  I love onions.  God, I eat them all the time, sauteed, over -- over s- with fish or with steak, or yeah.  Onion soup?  Don't like onion soup?
L:  Ah, onion soup is okay --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- the flavor of it.  It's just that I'm not a real big soup person.  I'm more of a meat eater, myself.
R:  Ah, I got you.
L:  You know, you give me a baked potato and a big old steak and I'm happy.
R:  That's -- that's what -- yeah.  Okay.  I got ya.  No, I'm kinda the opposite, though.  I eat a lot of Japanese food, and ah --
L:  Oh, really now?
R:  Yeah, well, you know, I live in LA and it was -- it was just something completely different than ah, what I -- you know, what I grew up with.  My mother was ah, my mother was a cordon blue chef --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and so I know, you know like, [inaudible] and um, things like that were like, big thick meaty sorts of stuff and [SIGH] I don't know, it's just -- it's just different and it's -- it's new and since, you know, I'm new in town, and I'm just experimenting it, ah, [LIPSMACK] it ah, it makes it -- it makes it easier.  You know, 'cause --
L:  Understandable you know.  Everytime some new place opens up in town here, I have to go try it.
R:  Sure.
L:  Just can't, you know, especially if it's a new type of food --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, I just moved from a city called Decatur --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to this city, Scotsborough --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because ah, my wife got promoted, got a bigger store.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  And, ah, when we moved out here like, Decatur has a population of around like, fifty, sixty thousand people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then we moved to here, which has a population of like, fifteen thousand.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you know, I had a wider variety of food places in Decatur, but now that I've moved here, you know, you're stuck --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with like, barbeque, Mexican or --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Or the chains.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you know ch- -- you know, if we want something good to eat, you know, that's like, different, we have to go to Huntsville, which is about forty minutes away.
R:  Wow.  Okay.
L:  You know, thirty to forty, depending on how fast you drive.
R:  Wow.
L:  But, you know, I like to go to Huntsville a lot 'cause they have like, sushi bars, Thai food --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Mexican food, Japanese food, Chinese food, Italian food --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- you know, just about anything you can think of, because Huntsville is like the ah, big conglomeration, I guess, in the north of Alabama.  It's the biggest city --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- around so 
R:  Right.
L:  I think it has a lot to do with the fact that they've got a -- the Boeing Space and Rocket Center there.
R:  Oh, that's right, okay.
L:  Plus a redstone arsenal and you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So everything grew around that.  So I go there a lot, but chances are, hm.  I like to eat a lot of Italian, a lot of chicken --
R:  Right.
L:  -- butter, lot of spaghetti [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I do eat a lot of spaghetti.  That's something I'll make at home.
L:  That's 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's easy to make, man.  Just get some sauce, throw some meat up in there --
R:  Yeah, you're good.  Yeah, and then I barbeque a lot, too.
L:  -- boil some noodles.  Could be a lot harder things to make.  Like, not too long ago I tried to make a cannelloni.
R:  Ah.
L:  Don't know if you know what that is?
R:  Oh, sure. Yeah.
L:  It's basically, take pasta --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- cook some -- flavor some meat, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the way they told me to.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you roll it up and, ah, I had never actually tried to make homemade pasta before --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then I tried it and they were all like, "This whole recipe, including making the pasta, will take you around four hours".  It was like, well that ain't too bad, you know, I could start around two, we'll eat around six.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I didn't end up getting done until nine o'clock at night.
R:  Wow.
L:  Because I had never made pasta before.
R:  [LAUGH]  The kids were screaming at you, wondering where the food was and, yeah.
L:  You know I basically had to feed the children, and send them -- you know, not a whole meal, just enough to get them by, and then told them you know, "Go l- -- go ahead and go lay down for bed", you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- "I'll wake you up in an hour when dinner is ready.  Ha, then we'll eat.  You can sit up for a little bit more, I know that, you know, it'll be up past your bed time, but I'm sorry, I didn't know".
R:  Ah.
L:  But, you know, 'cause making pasta is extremely difficult, you'll either, you know, make -- you can't --
