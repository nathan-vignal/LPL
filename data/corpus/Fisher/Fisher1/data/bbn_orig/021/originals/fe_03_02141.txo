R:  [MN] Hi.
L:  Hi, my name's Mark.
R:  My name's Wayne.
L:  How you doing, Wayne? [SIGH] Um ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, [LAUGH] I -- I -- I don't know, do you like, ah, eating at home, or do you prefer, ah, going out to restaurants?
R:  Well, I guess I would prefer to go out to a restaurant.
L:  What kind of food --
R:  Um, yeah, for me, ah, [SIGH] [COUGH] I guess the ideal meal looks something [LAUGH] like, ah, um, well would have -- would have a substantial amount of food involved.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And at the same time be rich in, ah, [SIGH] in high fat foods and -- and -- and lots of f- -- lots of frying. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  The, ah, [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  The, ah -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Are you, um, do you like Italian more so that -- than other foods, or what -- what's your favorite type of food?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I think if you fried pasta it would be pretty tasty.
L:  You think that -- that would be the way to go, huh?
R:  [SIGH] That would be the way to go. [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  Ah ... I'm definitely --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a huge fan of -- of Italian food, anything with like salt in it or something like that is -- is --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- ideal for me.  The -- like, ah, like, ah, veal.
R:  Like a pasta or like a like a veal, huh?
L:  Yeah.  Like you ever have veal, salt and bucco?
R:  Sure, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- that's one of my favorite, with the prosciutto--
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and the -- [SIGH] and the cheese and the butter wine sauce, and like you said --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- it's probably pretty fattening. [LAUGH]  But -- but --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- by far the best.
R:  Yeah, yeah, and it -- and it helps when it's deep fried. [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Sure thing.
R:  [LAUGH] No, actually. [LAUGH] But, ah --
L:  Do you --
R:  But, ah, yeah, that with a little -- with a little wine and, ah, some good bread and, ah, maybe some salad, you know, [SIGH] sounds like quite a g- -- quite a good meal.
L:  Yeah, it -- it -- it's by, ah, by far my favorite.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The, um, [MN] -- do you -- do you like other types of food like Mexican and stuff like that?
R:  Sure, yeah. [SIGH] Um ...
L:  Which is obviously heavily fried.
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, it helps to have, ah, it helps to have grilled meat also. [SIGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, yeah.  No, those -- those are all -- those are all good too.  Um, [SIGH] are you a -- are you a fan of anything that's non Italian? [SIGH]
L:  Oh, certainly.  Like I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- love Chinese food, I love Mexican food.  Um, you know, any types, ah, of good Subs and things like that, you know, good sandwiches.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, yeah, I -- I would say that if I -- if I was going to stay home for dinner --
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] 
L:  -- ah, I do love to grill.  So, you were saying like, ah, grilled meat and stuff like that, [SIGH] different types of steaks and kebabs and vegetables and seafood and stuff like that, those are all ...
R:  Yeah, something about the char --
L:  Nothing --
R:  -- broiling brings out the taste, right? [NOISE]
L:  Exactly.
R:  Right. [SIGH]
L:  So ...
R:  Well, do you find that in your area you are able to, ah, to -- to g- get the kinda food that you like? [SIGH]
L:  Oh, I live in an area that's probably [SIGH] ah, got about -- it'd probably have --
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE]
L:  -- fifteen restaurants probably within [SIGH] two blocks walking distance of -- of my apartment.  So, ah, I -- I have my -- my share of choices.
R:  Mm.  Well [MN] that's -- that's convenient.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You never have to cook, basically.
L:  No.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's funny it's, ah -- especially on a [SIGH]--
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on a weekly night when you're feeling all tired from the work day and stuff like that, it works out pretty well.
R:  [SIGH] Right, right.
L:  S- s- so it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, ah ...
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Um, what's your favorite fast food?
R:  [MN] Oh, yeah, you know, I don't really like fast food, but I have to say I'm a sucker for McDonald's french fries.
L:  There you go.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Deep fried.
R:  'C- 'cause they're deep fried, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH] Pretty much they're potatoes and they're deep fried and it's pretty hard to screw 'em up, so ... [NOISE]
L:  That -- that's true, they are.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Yeah.  [SIGH] Yeah, no, I don't -- I'm -- I'm not a big fan of fast food, but, um ...  But, you know, if you have to y- you should go for those fries.  [SIGH] Those shakes kind of scare me though.
L:  Oh, really?  See I -- I -- I love the, ah, [MN] the, ah -- oh what's it called?  It's on Saint Patrick's day, where they have like the McFlurry or whatever.  The -- the -- the mint green shakes.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, that -- [SIGH] that -- that -- that's kind of scary to me. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Why is that scary?
R:  How do they get it that green? [SIGH]
L:  Oh, I'm --
R:  I'm -- I'm always wondering exactly.
L:  There's chemicals for everything these days.
R:  Sure.  It -- it -- it's ah, [SIGH] ...  Yeah, it's -- it's -- it's kind of a wonder how they're able to do that really. [LIPSMACK] But --
L:  Yeah, I act- -- years and years ago I used to work in a -- in a restaurant and, ah, I don't know what it was, but all our milkshakes used to come out of like the enormous milk containers.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And you put it in the machine and I guess it would cool it enough so it would thicken up more or something, I'm not quite sure.
R:  [MN] Oh, right, yeah.
L:  But, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- I remember thinking it was at least majority of milk, so, hopefully they're not too much bad, well -- 
R:  [SIGH] I think in the McDonald's case --
L:  -- enough good stuff in there for you but not --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- bad stuff.  What?
R:  Yeah, I think in the McDonalds case it's probably plastic.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They actually --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- put, ah -- you ever noticed that they never quite melt?  [MN] I think they put, ah, they -- they put gelatin in them. [MN]
L:  T- to get sort of, ah, the -- the -- the, ah, anti equivalent of anti freeze in there?
R:  [MN] Yeah, it's -- it's basically always freeze, [SIGH] so ...
L:  Exactly.
R:  Right.  Yeah, that stuff is, um, [SIGH] it's kinda scary.  You know, I mean, it -- it should have the same physical properties as matter, but in fact it doesn't. [MN] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  It just kinda does its own thing.  It's kind of an amorphous blob.  Um --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- never quite liquid, never quite -- never quite solid but somewhere in between. [MN]
L:  There you go.
R:  It seems --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to be temperature independent too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] There's, ah, the, ah -- what was I gonna say?  I was gonna say something about other milkshakes -- whatever.  Now, do you like ice cream though?
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah. [SIGH]  It's hard to get good ice cream though, you know?
L:  Yeah.  I actually have near me too, there's a Ben and Jerry's right across the street.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, that's -- that is good.  There -- there -- [LIPSMACK] you know we used to make ice cream when we were kids.  That --
L:  Mhm.
R:  The homemade stuff is just -- that's the best, right?  [SIGH] Can't beat that.
L:  Exactly.  As long as you still have arm left, after like cranking up that crank for an hour and a half, or whatever it was.
R:  [MN] Yeah, well ... [LAUGH]
L:  Is that how you did it, with, ah, spinning the thing and the ice an all that?
R:  I think that's why it tasted so good.  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It sort --
R:  Right.  The ice and the salt, that's right. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  That's 'cause the -- the -- the, ah, taste is in the effort. [MN] Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Taste is definitely in the effort, because otherwise you just don't have a -- [SIGH] you know, y- y- y- -- otherwise you'd just buy it at the store and get kinda mediocre ice cream for free, right?
L:  Take it for granted.
R:  Right.
L:  Although I will say my favorite is Breyer's, ah, just plain vanilla bean [MN] is, ah, is my favorite ice cream.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that -- that's pretty good stuff.  That's pretty good stuff. [SIGH] [NOISE]
L:  The basics.
R:  So, what about desserts?
L:  Um.
R:  Other than ice cream. [NOISE]
L:  I'm actually not a huge dessert fan.  Like even like just talking about ice cream right now.  Like I -- I eat ice cream once every six months.  You know what I mean?  Like I -- I'm not a dessert person.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I like the appetizer, I like the entrees, and I'm usually too full after that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, it's j- -- the, ah -- I'm like the, ah -- the master of going to a place like, ah, Olive Garden or something like that and loading up so much on the bread and the, ah, and the salad that [SIGH] I just take my entree to go an eat it for lunch the next day. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, they tend to do that, don't they, at those, ah, those places where they have an all you can eat type -- type environment, basically? [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Mm.  Well, and that's the nice part about that place -- it's because like other all you can eat places like you eat as much as you can in that sitting and then it's over [SIGH] with the whole like entree thing.  Like I -- I literally take three or four bites and I'm then like [SIGH] -- you know, I -- I'm just not going to gorge myself I can't really eat any more.
R:  [LAUGH] Well --
L:  So ...
R:  -- I usually can't quite make it past the salad phase, [LAUGH] so, you know.
L:  See, if I --
R:  [SIGH] You know, especially --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- those kinds of places.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  If I were intelligent I would just order the bread stick and salad, and the soup and salad and [SIGH] be full and leave and spend a whole lot less money.  But for some reason I still always go for the entree.
R:  Mhm. [MN] [SIGH]
L:  So ...
R:  Yep.  That -- that's the inclination.  I think that's where they get you, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  They know that they can get you that way. [SIGH] So ...
L:  Oh, really.  How much does it cost to make the pasta?
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  So, yeah ...  Do you, ah -- when you're like thinking about like what kind of restaurants you want to go to and stuff like that, do you go to, ah -- do you prefer like chains and stuff like that?  Or do you prefer to find like that [SIGH] little like -- I'm not saying neighborhood but like community restaurant, one of a kind, [SIGH] ah ...?
R:  [MN] I like those, but I like the little dives too.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN] You know, the [SIGH] -- the funky little dives that sell -- you know, that -- that serve you the -- the strange food.  You know, from Burma or something like that. [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  What, ah -- what city do you live in?
R:  [MN] Ah, I'm in the Boston area.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  What about you? [MN]
L:  Ah, Philadelphia.
R:  Philadelphia, okay. [NOISE] [SIGH]
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, actually there's a place in -- in Philly that's kinda nice, um, right near, ah [COUGH] -- we used to go -- near, ah, where is it?  Oh kind of -- kind of close to the university there.  Kind of close U Penn --
L:  Um ...
R:  This place called the White Dog.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  It's a kind of nice place. [NOISE]
L:  Actually I's just at there maybe like three or four months ago.
R:  Yeah, that's kind of nice little restaurant. [NOISE] [SIGH]
L:  Went there for brunch, it was very, very good.
R:  Mhm. [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH] The, ah, -- yeah that's act- -- actually that's not -- it's probably only about five or six miles away from where I live.  I live -- did you ever go to the [inaudible] area.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, that's where I live.
R:  [MN] Oh, yeah, okay. [NOISE]
L:  It's nice.
R:  I like going to South Philly too.  South Philly's got some, you know, [MN] some nice Italian places.
L:  [LAUGH] Ralph's.  You ever go to Ralph's?
R:  [LAUGH] Uhuh. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep. [MN]
L:  That's as good as it gets.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah. [SIGH].  Or you can get, ah -- you can get those -- those nice sandwiches down -- down there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  In the market, which are -- which are good.
L:  Or you can go to the exact opposite on the spectrum and do like, ah, Tony Luke's or Gino's or Pat's and get some f- fried meat with, ah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- cheese whiz and --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, and it has to be cheese whiz, doesn't it? [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  It has to be.  Although personally, I'm -- I -- I personally prefer the, ah, the ones they call the provolone[?].
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, me too.
L:  But, that's you know --
R:  But I think --
L:  -- that's just ... [NOISE]
R:  -- to be really traditional you need the [NOISE] cheese whiz.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Exactly.  And then it has to be at least three o'clock in the morning.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] It's just --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Because otherwise you never actually --
R:  Yeah, otherwise --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you're not drunk enough to actually eat the stuff. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  If -- if you've ever actually tried to have one of those sober, it's kinda like, [LIPSMACK] "This really isn't that good".
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but it -- it's great when you're really hungry and you're drunk. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  It's three o'clock in the morning and there's like ten of you there like chowing on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Doesn't get any better than that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ... but ...
R:  [SIGH] Pretty funny, really funny. [SIGH]
L:  You a, ah -- I know this isn't the topic of conversation, but are -- are you a baseball --
