R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, there.
R:  Hi.  Who's this?
L:  Uh, [NOISE] I'm Carol in Dallas [NOISE].  How 'bout you?
R:  Oh, this is Barb.  I'm in Columbus, Ohio.
L:  Hi, Barb.
R:  Oh, hi.  This is only the second time I've done this, so ...
L:  Well, I think you're only allowed to do it three times --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so, you're half way into your --
R:  Oh [LAUGH], yeah, [SIGH] and, um, of course, it's one of my favorite topics, food. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] And, uh -- do you want to start or shall I?
L:  Oh --
R:  They w- --
L:  -- go ahead.  I'm just --
R:  Okay, well, let's see. [SIGH] Now, of course, I'd much prefer to eat in a restaurant.  Any time I don't have to cook and or do dishes [SIGH] is a treat for me.  I don't really care if it's [SIGH] a sit down [NOISE] or if it's fast [NOISE] food or take out, or whatever, just so I don't have to fix it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's my big deal.  How 'bout you?
L:  [SIGH] Well, it just depends.  I, um -- [LIPSMACK] I've been eating out a lot lately, for --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- several reasons.  First of all, I do a lot of, uh, secret shop restaurant analysis --
R:  Oh, oh --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- how cool.
L:  Well, it's cool, but it's a lot of work.  I mean, it's a lot of focus.  You know, you can't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just sit back and relax.  You have to remember everybody's name, and what time you were served [NOISE] and whether, you know --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- all that sort of stuff. [SIGH] So, I've eaten out about, mm, six times in the last twelve days --
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  -- so [LAUGH] --
R:  -- that's -- that's a bit much --
L:  -- [SIGH] it's getting a little old, er -- yeah, and -- and plus we're forced to eat out a lot because [LIPSMACK] my daughter's in competitive [NOISE] soccer, and we're always --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- just -- we're just going everywhere --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so, sometimes my biggest treat is just to sit down in h- --
R:  At home.
L:  -- at home to a real meal and eat, because [SIGH] I'd say, we don't get to do it any more --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- more than about -- about maybe -- maybe once a week or twice a week --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- at the most.  So ...
R:  Oh, well, see, now, my life is completely different --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- from that.  My son's in college, so, I get up, I go to work, and I always take something for lunch, 'cause with a half an hour, you know, by the time you get somewhere, [SIGH] you know, then you don't have time to eat, [SIGH] then by the time I get home, [SIGH] I mean, and you have to -- [SIGH] you know, I do whatever I'm going to do around the house and get ready for the next day, and try to catch up on work I didn't get done -- [SIGH] uh, well, okay, like right now I'm fixing my dinner which consists of [SIGH] a toasted swiss cheese and tomato sandwich --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, so I guess in a way, I'm [SIGH] fortunate I don't have [SIGH] anyone here that I have to please, but myself.
L:  There you go.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  But in a way [SIGH], you know, I get tired of [SIGH] -- so, I guess eating out for me is more of a -- [SIGH] a treat, than it probably is for you, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my perfect meal -- my -- well, I still [NOISE] -- although I am trying to get away from it [NOISE], I'm still like a big red meat [NOISE] eater.
L:  Mm.
R:  Prime rib, baked potato, [SIGH] [NOISE] and [NOISE] salad, and [NOISE] home made bread, I think [NOISE] would probably [NOISE] be my [NOISE] idea of a [NOISE] perfect [NOISE] meal [NOISE].  I'm not much for sweets, and I'm not much for desserts.  I'm more of a curb[?] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- person.
L:  You know, I don't really have a perfect meal.  I mean, there's so much [NOISE] I like [NOISE] that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it doesn't really matter to me.  I mean, sometimes my perfect meal is something that n- -- well, usually, my perfect meal's something that nobody else in my house would eat.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like you know, like -- like, uh, calves liver and onions --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- ooh, I love liver and onions.
L:  And stuff like that, that no one else --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- will eat.  It's just devine to be able to find a place --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that will have that stuff.
R:  Well, you know, we do have -- now, there are quite a few -- Columbus is a very big, [SIGH] um, restaurant town. [SIGH] There are lots and lots of chains come in here.  I guess it's because it's the perfect test market --
L:  I've heard that, yeah.
R:  -- but there are a lot of places here where you can get liver and onions, I mean --
L:  Yeah, I'll have to come up and --
R:  -- and --
L:  -- visit.  C, uh, Ohio or Indiana?
R:  Ohio.
L:  Ohio, okay.
R:  Yeah.  They, um -- yeah, but this is -- this is one thing, and -- well, though, we do have a variety, and I'll tell you that Thai food and the middle eastern food is --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- starting to catch -- catch on here.
L:  Yeah, that's all the rage here --
R:  Y- yeah, oh, you know --
L:  -- every other place ...
R:  -- isn't that funny.  I mean, for the longest time, here in Columbus, [SIGH] if -- if exotic was like Chinese, you know, and yet I would notice that people [SIGH] would still stay very close to things they were familiar with, like fried rice [SIGH] and, you know, nothing -- nothing indefinable, nothing whatever, but we do have a couple of sushi places here now, [SIGH] and, I don't know -- I mean, it's all right, if once you get past [NOISE] the thought of what you're actually eating --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I think that the -- the big draw with the sushi restaurants, is more the presentation. [SIGH] You know, it's all [NOISE] -- it's very decorative and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- the colors are so nice, and they're arranged so nicely --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, you really [SIGH] forget that you're paying nine ninety five for -- for two bites of raw fish and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- an octopus tentacle, or stuff [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Well, yeah.
R:  -- like that, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  And that's -- that's something I usually don't eat, except on a -- an expense account. [LAUGH]
R:  No, mhm.
L:  We do have a favorite sushi restaurant here that [NOISE] we go to, but not very often --
R:  No --
L:  -- 'cause it's so expensive.
R:  -- no, that is the kind of thing, you know, and of course, [SIGH] you know, I don't know about your daughter, but when my son is here, [SIGH] because he's in college, and I think he probably lives mostly on [SIGH] cereal and fri- -- you know, leftover pizza, [SIGH] you know, he's always, [SIGH] wanting somebody to cook this or cook that, but then of course, there's always the infamous White Castle --
L: [LAUGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] I don't know if you guys have anything --
L:  No, we really don't have it, but --
R:  -- an equivalent to --
L:  -- we just got Steak n Shake down here actually.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, so that's pretty --
R:  Oh, my --
L:  -- exciting --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's pretty exciting.
R:  Huh.
L:  [SIGH] But, yeah, um, and see my daughter's Miss Pasta Girl -- pasta and pizza, so, that's what --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- she always wants, and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- my husband hates it.  So, you know, it's like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- oh [SIGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I just finally told them.  I said, "There's no -- you know, you either sit down and eat --"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  "-- what I'm fixing, or, you don't eat" --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, but, you know what?  I don't really, you know what?  When somebody says, "What would your last meal be?"  I just don't know what I'd say --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause I like so many different things.
R:  Yeah, you know, and, uh, we -- we used to have the contest too about, if you could only eat like one type of food [SIGH] for the rest of your life --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- what would it be?  [SIGH] And for me, it would have to be potatoes, you know, because --
L:  Really?
R:  -- there's so many different things you can do with a potato.
L:  Well, that's true, but n- -- yeah, that's true.  Well, I don't know, because I, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I had a cousin that went to Iceland for a year, and all they eat is like boiled fish and --
R:  Ew.
L:  -- boiled potatoes, and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] --
R:  Be so sick of it.
L:  [LAUGH] She [LAUGH] -- she said, she finally, you know, convinced them that were other ways -- she taught them how to bake potatoes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  These were people with PhDs.  I mean, these were --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- these were very bright people, but they just ...
R:  Well, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's very funny.  I mean, you -- you, er, -- you -- you cook like -- I don't know, but you know, when I first moved out, [SIGH] I bought the same things -- the same brands that my mom bought, I will fix the same kind of food, and my grandmother and grandfather were farm people, [SIGH] so, the meat always had gravy, the vegetables always had cream sauce, there was always bread on the table --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, so we grew up with that also, and then finally, you know, when my mom was like -- [LIPSMACK], uh, when us kids started to get bigger, [SIGH] uh, she just drastically changed, and now my mom's idea of dinner is like [LIPSMACK] a bowl of cottage cheese and a cucumber cut up on top of it. [SIGH] That's -- she's very -- all of a sudden has gotten, as she gets older, very health conscious and very -- and I think a lot more people too now [SIGH] are starting to watch, [SIGH] you know, what they -- you know, what -- me -- myself, you know, I'm -- I should [LAUGH], but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I really don't.  Anyway, [SIGH] but I do enjoy food and being in the mid west, [LIPSMACK] you know, that's basically [SIGH] -- you know, although I did go -- I to- -- I went to London and to Paris last year [SIGH] and their whole eating habits are very different.  Here, [SIGH] it seems like we eat to get it out of the way, to get on and do something else --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and over there, they're outing out is a social occasion.  I mean --
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  -- they take hours in between the courses and sit all day, whereas we just, you know, want to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- get it over with.
L:  Well, not so much in London, but certainly in Paris.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  It's this real[?] event. [SIGH] I like the way they do it, and they don't do it as much in -- in London, but in, er, other places in England [SIGH] they -- you go into a room.  It's like a little lounge and you order your cocktail or whatever --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and you place your order at -- in the lounge --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then when your meal is ready, they call you to the table.
R:  Oh.
L:  And --
R:  So, you're not --
L:  -- and, of course, you may sit with other people.  You just take --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, um, it -- and then when you're, uh, finished with your main course, then you go back into the lounge and have your coffee and dessert --
R:  Dessert.
L:  -- or whatever, and I just love to do that, because it was like -- I hate just sitting at the table --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- waiting for your food, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh [LAUGH], and then you know what? --
L:  You --
R:  -- you're -- you're picking at a bowl of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- dried out coleslaw --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- or whatever --
L:  -- you're tapping your --
R:  -- while you're waiting.
L:  -- tapping your glass, on, you know --
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Well, I know, the one thing that I --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- really enjoyed in Paris too, was, [SIGH] um, the -- now, in London of course, you know, they -- all of the ho- -- well, you know, [SIGH] all the hotels include a breakfast.  Well, [SIGH] you know, the breakfast came and it was actually, [SIGH] you know, pretty much to my liking.  It was a --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a hard roll, [SIGH] a green apple and a piece of cheese, you know, and a little bit of juice, so ...
L:  In London?  In London? 
R:  Yeah, in London.
L:  Oh, usually it's --
R:  Well, the first --
L:  -- full breakfast.
R:  -- the first time I went, I stayed in -- in, um, [LIPSMACK] King's Cross. [SIGH] Now, on the second time I went, we stayed closer into town in the theatre district, and it was different then. [SIGH] But my son was just -- he didn't much care for that, you know.  In the -- [SIGH] the first day, you know, he went and got our breakfast and it was just juice and a hard roll.  Well, [SIGH] the next day I woke up and he was already up and gone, [SIGH] and I looked out the window to see my son going down a street in London.  He was going down to -- to the store -- to the takeaway [LAUGH] to get something that was more to his liking --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but the breakfast in Paris, [SIGH] oh my, one yogurt, and you know, fresh baked croissants 'cause they're all big bread eaters over there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, and they heat up the milk for your coffee, and [SIGH] it's just such a delight to have, you know, something different, rather than, you know -- you ask for -- now, you can get like wheat germ and stuff over there, but cereal -- of course they don't have, uh, you know, they -- they don't eat on the street like we do, they don't have the Crowers[?] and the Big Bears and all that stuff, like we do, and [SIGH], yeah ...
L:  Well, they do in the suburbs.  They do in the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- country.  They have huge, uh, uh, supermarkets.
R:  Really?  No, all I ever saw were like the li- ...
