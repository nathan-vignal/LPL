R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, my name is Joanne.
L:  My name is Carol Anne.
R:  Ah, Carol Anne? Okay, um, [LIPSMACK] so we're supposed to talk about food, and, um, huh, I prefer to eat out.
L:  I prefer to eat at home. [LAUGH]
R:  That's fine.  [LAUGH] I would --
L:  I happen to be a very good cook, so, um, I just prefer to be at home.  I mean, there are days that I'll eat out, but it's usually a special occasion.
R:  Now, I like to eat out because I'm home all day, I'm an at home mom, and I like to eat out because it gets me out of the house and -- and -- you know, it -- I mean, I can cook okay but my husband's really picky --
L:  Mhm.
R:  He only eats meat, potatoes and -- and certain vegetables, he's very particular.  And I like to try different stuff, and it's easier for me to get stuff I can't get at home if we go out.
L:  Yes, that's the same with my husband.  Ah, he's a regular meat, potato and only peas and corn for a vegetable.  [MN] -- 
R:  Peas, corn and green beans are my husband.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  See, I'm Italian, and my mother did not cook very well while I was growing up, which is very unusual for an Italian mom.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And, um, I was -- you know, every one of my sisters and brothers happen to cook very well only be- -- out of necessity.  Ah, because she was a big cleaner, but a cooker she was not.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My mom's a great cook, um, she was -- she was a really good cook.  Now, we didn't cook a lot, um, growing up but -- I don't know -- I -- I like to cook, but I just don't [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] -- I just don't like the whole cleaning up afterwards, which my husband does, actually but -- and I usually clean as I go, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't know -- I just like going out, 'cause it was always a treat, a real big treat for us to go out when we were younger.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, as an adult I like to go out more because I didn't get to a lot growing up, so, um --
L:  Well, you're also an at home mom.  I was in that boat, ah, three years ago and I know what you're talking about because at that point, you're just sitting home and you need that interchange of going out and feeling like you're part of the world, instead of just sitting home.
R:  Yeah, being around other adults. You know [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- with adult conversation. [LAUGH] [several inaudible words].
L:  Does -- do you go out with your husband, or w- -- do you have children?
R:  Um, I have one -- one child.  I'm a new at home mom and so, um, when -- when I go out it's with my husband.  We actually just moved to the area that we're in now and so I don't have any, um, girlfriends yet, real good one's, you know, I've met a couple at the gym, but not any real good ones where I can have, like, a girls night, going out, you know, to eat or anything but -- it's mostly, ah, it's mostly my husband and I go out or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, family dinners.  If --
L:  Well, you need that.  You really need that in a relationship.  Ah, me -- my husband and I have been married for fifteen years.  So it's a different situation, even though I have four children, in the range of twenty eight, [NOISE] ah, eighteen, seven and twelve.
R:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I adopted two children from Russia, but --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  When I was, you know, I could- -- I had eight miscarriages and really loved children --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, um, you know, I -- after fifteen years, um, and you get a house and you get four children, ah, the responsibilities go to another place, you know, as far as financially and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's -- that's why, you know, eating at home -- and especially my husband's always working -- and so eating at home and having a family night where everyone's together is a big deal for us. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I can -- I mean, w- -- to tell you the truth, for a while we were eating out a lot and then it got to where the -- it's because we -- you know, my daughter wasn't here yet and, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, it was easier, but now I do like to -- I do -- it does save us money to eat at home.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  And especially with -- 'cause you can prepare, you know, for the whole week when you go to the grocery store and it makes it easier.
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, like, tonight, you know -- stuff comes up, like tonight I -- I didn't cook dinner because my husband has a softball game for his jo- -- you know, he plays on his, ah, [LIPSMACK] work team --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and we had to run and do some errands before then and so I didn't cook any dinner, because it was like, we were going to have to eat it real fast and then I'm going to have to come back and clean up when we get done, and I didn't want to deal with it.
L:  Right, well --
R:  You know ...
L:  -- with my children, at least once or twice a week, I will go and get them McDonald's or I order pizza in, ah, 'cause we have some very good, you know, pizza places --
R:  We don't. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and they're very -- I have a lot of coupons so, you know, I can get a large pie for, like, eight fifty so that's not ah --
R:  No, wow -- that's a good deal.
L:  Yeah, that's a --
R:  We don't --
L:  -- that's a good deal, so -- you know, and I -- I work until -- I have two jobs and I work for the school system doing one job and then I'm the secretary of my church.
R:  Oh, okay, so you're very busy. [LAUGH]
L:  And that's -- that's a good thing for you to get involved with if -- if you come from any kind of religious background --
R:  Yeah, yeah we -- we --
L:  -- because I don't know where you are, but in my particular neck of woods, ah, which is Warome[?], [LIPSMACK] ah, once you get involved with the church then you have someone to go out with and interact with and, you know, like, they have afternoon guilds and they have this thing and that thing that you can participate, even with your children, and --
R:  Right.  Well --
L:  -- you know, I mean they even have dinners -- we have pot luck dinners [LAUGH] and --
R:  We're -- I'm actually in a church and it's a new church, it's just starting, it's, um, just forming its congregation -- we didn't -- I -- I'm Lutheran -- and we didn't have Lutheran church in our area --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but they're building one -- well not building the building, but they're forming a congregation now, so it's in the very early stages -- and there's really n- --
L:  Well get very involved with it, so you can help with the dinners -- I mean, we -- we -- we have a lot of food things that we do and I guess that's what makes me involved, but, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  We have to stay on our topic, which is whether we eat in or out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And w- --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- and we, you know, we also get Chinese food out.
R:  Yes.
L:  Do you have a buffet place that you [several inaudible words]?
R:  We have a -- every Thursday night is Chinese takeout night for us and we go to this Chinese restaurant --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, um, I love the rice noodles --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- the little skinny rice noodles.  Those are my favorite with a, um, stir fried vegetables in them.
L:  Oh, that's gr- -- you eat very healthy, it sounds like.
R:  [LAUGH] I try. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, you know, I --
L:  I -- I can't say that, I love the snow crab legs.
R:  But that's healthy.
L:  Well ...
R:  I mean, it's not -- it's fat free and there's l- -- it's low in -- it's really high in iodine and in cholesterol, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's still fat free, but I like -- I like the rice noodles and I like, um, the chicken that's, like, teriyaki chicken.
L:  Yeah, I like that too.
R:  I like that a lot.  Now, Thursdays it's a toss between pizza and the, um, [LIPSMACK] and the Chinese and usually Chinese wins out because you just get a lot more and it's -- we don't have a good pizza place here, we really don't.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And so that's why we do it.
L:  Well, we have Burger King, we have McDonald's, we have Denny's, we have every kind of fast food, Wendy's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, so I can basically take them out -- if -- if I want to.  And [inaudible] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the time persists because when you get home at six o'clock and then, you know, we get up at five o'clock in the morning, so, ah, there's only, um, certain span of time that we can eat out.  That's why basically, I think, a lot of times we eat at home except for the weekends or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- days where I come home too tired and say, "Okay, let's grab that pizza", or "Let's grab that -- that McDonalds", and the kids say, "Great". [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Well, what is your favorite pla- -- what is your favorite food to eat out?
L:  Ah, I think ... [LIPSMACK] I think ... German.
R:  Oh, that is good.  German food is really good.
L:  I like salbriten[?], [LIPSMACK], I love, um, wiener schnitzel --
R:  Mhm.  I like --
L:  We have a very beautiful place over here with German food.  Ah, it would cost us, like, three hundred dollars for my family of five to go out and eat. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  But we don't go all the time, but that is my -- my special place.  What's your favorite food?
R:  Our s- -- our special place that my husband and I like to go -- if we're going to go out and have a night of, you know, just going out and stuff -- we go to a Japanese rest- -- it's a hibachi restaurant.
L:  Oh.
R:  And we go to that and then I can get -- 'cause I can order some sushi rolls and --
L:  Yeah
R:  -- where he doesn't -- he doesn't eat that stuff.
L:  Do you like the California ones?  'Cause that's the ones I like.
R:  I like those, but I like a lot of the other ones too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, there's different types and so we get to -- I get to order that and the soup and the ginger dressing, so that's --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- like our special night.  We go to this one particular restaurant --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if we're going to go someplace nice, that we
