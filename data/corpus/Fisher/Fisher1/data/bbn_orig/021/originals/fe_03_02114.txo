L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Joy.
L:  Hi, I'm Jodie. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm on a cellphone so let me know if I get fuzzy or anything like that.
L:  [NOISE] Okay, all right. [NOISE]
R:  So, do you want to go first?
L:  Um, I didn't quite hear the question, totally.  Can you say it again to me?
R:  I think she said, uh, do you -- are you the kind of person who has lots of friends or just a +few -- a few --
L:  A few close friends?
R:  -- and you could --
L:  Okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um [LIPSMACK] well --
R:  Why don't you talk about your best friend?
L:  Talk about my best friend?  All right.  Well, actually, I -- I like to make, you know, a lot of friends but I only have a real -- a couple of real close friends.  Do you know what I'm saying?
R:  Mm.
L:  But I try to be, um, you know, pretty outgoing and meet people when I'm out and about and that type of thing.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] One thing I like about a good friend is, you know, [NOISE] someone's that honest and can talk to you, type thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, how about you?
R:  And what about your best friend?
L:  Um, that's probably what I like the best about her, you know, someone that you can do stuff with but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you can trust and she's honest and can talk to you and the bad thing is probably my best friend is, I don't know, about a thousand miles away but -- [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But you know --
R:  That's too bad.
L:  -- at least it's like a good best friend, when you get back together you don't even realize you haven't seen each other for a -- quite a while.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's -- that's what I like.
R:  Yes.  Uh, this is a funny question because I was actually thinking about this recently.  I'm the kind of person who has, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot of friends and I just like being around different kinds of people and I like connecting different people.  So I connect --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, being the, not necessarily, matchmaker --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- more like, you know, getting this person to meet that person 'cause I think they'd get along kind of thing.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  Um, but my boyfriend's not at all. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  So for a while I was like, "Is this weird that he doesn't have a lot of friends?  Who does he talk to?" you know, like who --
L:  Right, right. [LAUGH]
R:  You know it -- if somebody doesn't have a lot of friends then who do they vent to, you know, when the person they're seeing, you know, pisses them off or something like that.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Um, because I feel like I have lots of people to vent to but if you don't then what does that, you know --
L:  What d'you do?
R:  What does that mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, you know, what does that mean for the way you build relationships and friendships and, um, I -- I don't know if --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's a trait thing.  I like being around lots of people.  I like having, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I like -- I don't like doing things by myself so I always like to have lots of friends.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I've --
R:  And that's that.
L:  See, I always like to get -- it's like people together, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't care if you know who -- that one over there, that one over there, just all come to my house, let's get together, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Mixing worlds.
L:  Let's have fun.  Yeah, yeah. [SIGH]
R:  I know but not everybody's comfortable mixing worlds.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Some people like to keep their worlds in little, you know, compartments.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people from school stay here and people from work stay here.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I'm actually uncomfortable with that.  I always feel strange when somebody doesn't want to introduce me to people in their other world.
L:  Right.
R:  Even if we're just friends, I -- you know, not dating or anything, just wanna go out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I don't know, the best friend question is sort of weird for me.  I -- I feel like there're different people who at different times in my life were, you know, definitely there for me.
L:  Right.
R:  And maybe now we're not as close but, like you said, you know, you don't have to see people for a long time and then you see them and it's great, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  My sister recently moved back to New York so I'd say right now she's really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, the person I call up first when something happens or something pisses me off but I don't know if sisters count as best friends because that's like, you know --
L:  Well, they could be I think. [LAUGH]
R:  Do you have any siblings?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I actually have a brother and a sister.
R:  And would you consider them what -- you know, your closest friends?
L:  Um, you know, my brother and I actually were very close friends growing up. [NOISE] No, you can't talk.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 'Cause we're only a year apart and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- people couldn't believe that, like, in high school we did everything together.
R:  That's great.
L:  We had the same group of friends and, you know -- but, uh, we just enjoyed that, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And now I've moved away -- [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so I don't see him as often so --
R:  Mm.
L:  But I still think we're, you know, pretty close.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I know if I ever needed something he'd be there for me.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  And my sister [NOISE] I'm pretty close to except that she's thirteen years younger than me so --
R:  Oh, that's a big difference.
L:  So she's only in high school right now. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh wow.
L:  You know, but I mean she's --
R:  You're leading very different lives.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] So it's pretty different although I realize that, you know, like if she really needs to talk she'll call me though.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know so I --
R:  Even though she's in high school?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I feel like especially at that age, um -- uh, my roommate's a walking American beauty right now.  You know the idea of friendship and who you talk to is so restricted by who your peers talk to.
L:  Mhm.
R:  For their -- you know, for their advice.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I'm -- I don't know, I don't remember -- at that point I don't remember really talking to a lot of older people although now I don't know why I didn't do that.
L:  Right.
R:  So people who have -- did similar things, you know, or had that experience before but  -- when you, um -- the best friend you have now, how long have you known her or him?  I don't know.
L:  Um, for about a -- yeh, let me think, for about twelve years.
R:  [NOISE] Oh wow, that's a long time.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, we met in college.
R:  Okay.
L:  And then we, um -- we both moved out --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Away from our families to start our teaching careers together so we really kind of bonded that way [LAUGH] from both --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- being far away from home and stuff [NOISE] and then -- well, I've moved away from there now but, you know, she still lives out in Michigan where we were at and stuff, so --
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] So --
R:  Yeah that's definitely very bonding. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, I think that's where we especially bonded 'cause we both moved far away from our families --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that's all we had was each other, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  So then that kinda brings you together and -- and then I -- I hooked up with her husband, too, so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, that helps a little bit, too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Um, I think some of my best friends -- I actually --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- went through a sort of similar experience because I did Americorps.  I don't know if you know what that is?
L:  What is it?
R:  Americorps.  It's sort of --
L:  Wh- --
R:  -- like the Peace Corps but you stay in the U.S.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And, um, instead of doing an individual project I was on a team of people --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and we traveled around and did, you know, all sorts of things like, you know -- in education, environment, public safety and -- and all these projects --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, but you couldn't get away from each other, you know, it's like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just, sort of like you're saying --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you're bonding over the projects but the truth was you were bonding because you spent all this time together.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And you --
L:  You didn't have much choice. [LAUGH]
R:  You had to figure out how to deal with each other.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, how to -- and those are people who are mostly like, sort of, like you said, who I don't see very often.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, they live all over the US and none of them live in New York City, which is where I live.
L:  Okay.
R:  And -- and I, like, I can see them and immediately we just go back to that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, that team feeling we had.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's amazing because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, there was one person on the team who actually sort of hated me during that time. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It was amazing, he just totally hated me  --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, for no reason that anybody knew.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And as soon as the thing -- as soon as the -- the program was over, you know, he sort of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- decided he loved me, you know, it's just that -- that kind of --
L:  Right.
R:  Wow, we've done this whole thing together --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and how could I not, you know, appreciate, you know, these things that we've gone through --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it was just, you know, good to -- it was good to finally see something like that, you know.
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  See someone.
L:  That's quite a good -- great experience.
R:  [LAUGH]  It was pretty -- it was cool.
L:  I bet.
R:  How long -- how long were you and your friend living in the same city, before she moved away?
L:  [NOISE] Well, we went to college, four years together, and then we lived, um, out in Michigan together for three years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So we were together for seven years, you know.
R:  Oh, that's a long time.
L:  Yeah, pretty close, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause when you live in the dorms and stuff ya, you know, you -- [LAUGH]
R:  Spend a lot of time together.
L:  Yeah, you do and then, like I said, out there it was just a kind of survival, you know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  We both were starting new careers and we had no family, nobody near us, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- except each other so that's a special relationship I think, you know.
R:  Is one of the reasons you decided to go out there because you had her to go out with?
L:  [NOISE] Actually the school I graduated from --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- we were assigned to our first, um, teaching position and we both just happened --
R:  Is that usual?
L:  And we just happened to both get assigned out there 'cause we teach in a -- I was teaching in a private school.
R:  Okay.
L:  So -- and that was just part of the agreement, you know.  They would give you a place to teach if you would go anywhere in the United States. [LAUGH]
R:  Is that -- is that usual, though?
L:  Um, that's not usual.  It -- I think our college is probably the only one --
R:  Is a bit different.
L:  -- that does that.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, most people think that --
R:  I haven't heard of that.
L:  -- sounds pretty strange. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well do they pay for your school if you do that?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Well, they do -- they do pay part of it, actually, I take that back 'cause it's a private university --
R:  Okay. [NOISE]
L:  -- and they do reimburse you part of it.
R:  Okay.
L:  Part of, you know -- so that you'll be trained to teach in their schools and stuff, so -- [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But that's still pretty [inaudible] not knowing where you're going to go and --
L:  No.
R:  -- how -- you know, what you're going to do.
L:  No, you -- they tell you the end of May and you move by the end of June, usually.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] So --
R:  And besides her, I mean, you said you like to have lots of friends.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, do you usually meet your friends through work or through other friends or randomly, sort of, on the street kind of walk up to strangers thing?
L:  Yeah, well, actually I work in my own, um, Internet business --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and so I'm always out and I'm sharing it with other people and so I love to do that, I love to go out and share and, like, make a friend with them, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, we have a working relationship or even when I'm just out and about I love to talk to people.
R:  Okay.
L:  'Cause I -- you know, maybe they're the one I'm looking for and I could help 'em --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or something, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's the way -- I love to help people so I'm always thinking, "All right, I -- you know, I want to meet this person 'cause maybe -- maybe we'll be a friend", you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I just actually, yesterday and today, started taking real estate classes and --
R:  Oh, good --
L:  -- I came home and I told my husband, like, "All right, this girl, my classmate, she needs a friend, I'm going to be her friend". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He's like, "Does she want you to be her friend?" [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I think --
L:  I'm like, "I don't care if she wants to or not, and I'm going to be her friend". [LAUGH]
R:  I think that's important.  I mean, I -- I know maybe twice, that's not very many, but twice in my life I made a conscious decision that I was going to be friends with someone.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I just did it, you know, and it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So it's amazing to me, sort of, how attitude affects, you know, even relationship.  I mean, I guess that happens a lot when you're married, um, but even with just friendships, you know, you can decide whether you --
