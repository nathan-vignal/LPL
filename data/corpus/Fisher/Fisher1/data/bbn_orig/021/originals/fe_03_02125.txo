R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  [LAUGH] Hi.  This is Cheryl.
L:  Hi, I'm Kim, Cheryl, how you doin'?
R:  Great.
L:  Good.
R:  [MN] Where you from?
L:  Um, Saint Louis.
R:  Oh, really.  I'm from Kansas City.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, Oletha[?].
L:  Not that far away, huh?
R:  No.
L:  Okay.
R:  I mean, I thought maybe I'd talk to somebody who's from the deep south or -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Well, okay. [NOISE]
R:  So, we're supposed to talk about friends, huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Well ... [SIGH]
L:  We're supposed to talk about our best friends, or -- because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I only have the one real close friend.
R:  Well, you want to go first? [LAUGH]
L:  Um, well, yeah, I'll go first.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, she's -- her name is Kelly Williams.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I've known her for about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- six years now.  Met her when I was going to, um, school, we were in the same program together.
R:  [MN]
L:  And, um, she's been a real close friend, and I think the only reason why we are the best of friends is because we don't spend too much time together.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Um, [COUGH] we have, um, -- she has a nine year old son, and I have a six year old and a three year old.  So, sometimes the six year old and the nine year old get together and play. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, we do, [NOISE] you know, every once in a while do special things together and stuff but it might be two or three times a month, but we talk to each other on the phone --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- probably about once every two weeks, and we talk for a while when we do.  But, you know, we leave each other messages, email all the time and stuff.  But --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like if I have a problem she'll talk to me about it; if she has a problem she'll talk -- you know, I'll talk to her and ...  So, it's just like -- you know, I think that's the reason why we're such close friends.  We just went out to lunch together the other day.  So, we do that e- once -- once a month, so ...  I think that's the reason why we stay pretty close.  But she's the -- my only friend that I can really, really confide in.
R:  Wow.  Does she live close to you?
L:  Yes.  She lives probably about ten minutes away. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You're probably just very busy, like we are.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, yes, she's very busy.
R:  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, I asked -- [MN] kind of I was trying to think real quick about what my answer to that question was, whether I have more acquaintances and just lots of friends.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or -- or close friends.  I don't know, I think I have both.
L:  Really?
R:  I have a lot of acquaintances.  Like I have a home business and so --
L:  Oh, okay. [NOISE]
R:  -- I talk to a lot of people on the phone too, that have become good friends that I -- I haven't necessarily met. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  But I talk to them on the phone all the time.  And I guess my best friend though lives in the same area here.  And I -- I guess kinda like yours, I haven't -- I don't see her that often.  I see her --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- more now than I used to.  But I've known her for probably nine years, and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- we met at our church.  And she's got a daughter that's sixteen and a daughter that's six. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And, um, I have five children, so ...
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, our kids don't really play together, or we don't -- we don't go to the same school district or anything anymore so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But, ah, she actually just -- just bought one of my puppies. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  We have puppies, so -- so I've been talking to her a lot lately. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  But, yeah, we go out -- we go out for lunch too and that kinda thing.  And, um, I think [MN] our philosophy of life is pretty similar, so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's probably we get along really well.  I know that pretty much the way I think about things is the way she [LAUGH] does too so ...
L:  Oh that's good.
R:  That makes it -- you know, we don't really have any -- any disagreements about anything.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Except maybe child rearing sometimes. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  [MN] Yeah.
R:  I'm a lot more loose than she is.
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  When it comes to kids she's very -- a lot more structured, and I guess maybe that's good. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  Okay.
R:  [SIGH] Ooh.  I was thinking about long distance, and I think even back to high school and college friends.  Um, I still -- there are still people I feel really close to that I don't talk to very often at all.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  But, when we g- 
L:  From high school?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Really?
R:  But still when we get together it -- you know, once in a great while, it still seems like, um, we've never been separated.
L:  Mm.
R:  I just still feel really close to 'em, so ...
L:  That's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't have -- my high school friends, I don't, um -- we had a reunion [SIGH] like about ten, fifteen years ago, but I still -- I don't really talk to any of 'em.  I hear about some of 'em --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- through my relatives that live in the same town, but, um ...
R:  Right.
L:  I don't really +associate -ate with them at all.  There is one particular girl that, um, kept trying to get a hold of me and I was always doing something where I just couldn't really call her back.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, once in a while I would call back, and we just lost touch, period.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, that's pretty good if you can keep up with your high school friends. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it's just like -- like you say, it's one that -- there's one in particular that I was really close to and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] -- and she lives in Iowa, so, it's not real far apart.  In fact, in, um -- few years ago our two oldest daughters were really good friends and we used to kinda send them back and forth and they would spend some time at the other one's house for a week or so in the summer, so ...
L:  [MN]
R:  We haven't done that in a long time, so ...
L:  Mm.
R: [SIGH]
L:  Nice.
R:  She's somebody I've been thinking about a lot lately, that I should probably call her. [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible]
R:  But I --
L:  That's [MN] -- that'd be nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  My college -- I don't know, my college friends all seem to have moved far away and I even speak to them less.  The internet really helps --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- if I do email --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and ...  
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, my best friend from college just had a baby, so I just heard about that. [MN]
L:  Mm.
R:  But she got married way later than I did, so we didn't have a lot in common for a long time.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You know, she lived here, but [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I don't know, I -- I didn't ever think I was really [LAUGH] the social person for a long time till --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- like I say I started doing the home business thing, and [SIGH]-- and now, I -- I've been kinda thrown in to having to talk to a lot of different people and -- and making friends.
L:  Well, I'm the same way.  [NOISE] I have a hard time socializing usually. [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think I'm a kinda shy person.
R:  Kind of a homebody.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I would just as soon sit at home with a book. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause my husband doesn't really like going out or anything either, so ....
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  Um, yeah, it is.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It is.  We -- we've just finally, over the last -- and we've been married [SIGH] eighteen years, and we've just finally, over the last two years, started to have really more couple friends --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that we do a few things with, you know, family things.  But, for a long time we didn't even do that.  I just had some girlfriends and he had some guy friends --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we didn't really have friends together so ...  It's ver- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- very different now.  I have friends who actually have families, like we do, and ...  We were over at, I guess, another one of my good friend's house today.  Her daughter, um, in our church she just was confirmed today, and so they had a big thing at their house, and went over there with all her family.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, that was fun.
L:  So, you have church, do you have a lot of church friends?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I -- well, several.  I wouldn't say a lot.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  I mean, a lot of them are more acquaintances.
L:  Right, that's what I have.
R:  Um, it -- it's not a huge church.  I think [SIGH] we probably have five hundred or so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- which isn't massive. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  Right, yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  See, I go to a very big church.
R:  You go for -- for -- like thousands?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, they have -- it's so big they have two services on Saturday and two services on Sunday.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah, so it's, ah -- it's huge.
R:  Yeah, that would be hard.
L:  It's a nondenominational church.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, those tend to be big.
L:  So, it's really nice and I -- I, um, serve at the, um, -- for the little kids on -- once a Sat- one Saturday out of the month.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so, ah, there's a few people in there that, um, I keep in touch with.  Um, I don't know if you'd call them friends, I guess they would be acquaintances too.
R:  Yeah, not real close.
L:  Yeah, not real, real close, just like -- just your church buddies, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Yeah.  It's kinda hard to get close to people in -- in that big of a situation.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I know I always wanted to go to a small college too and be a member of a smaller church, and ...
L:  Right.
R:  I just don't like those big [LAUGH] situations.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean my high school was very small, an- and college.  I -- I went to a college where there was a thousand -- about a thousand people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, like I say, our church isn't that big either, and I think I pretty much know, or at least recognize, most of the people at the church, but, um -- and I direct the childrens' choir so --
L:  Oh, okay, well that's nice.
R:  -- the -- the moms from that are more the people that I've become really close friends with.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, I don't know, my friends --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- friends around town have come from all different -- different ways [LAUGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- of meeting them.  Just being involved with things at -- at the school with my kids, or ...
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  [MN]
L:  I, um, also, um, I've got a pretty close person that I, um, I talk to that -- my child does -- my oldest does soccer, well both of them do soccer now, but --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  -- there's a lady there that I've know her for like a couple of sessions, and we -- we talk outside of the [LIPSMACK] uh, soccer as well.  So, I guess you could say she's kind of a -- a pretty good friend.
R:  Yeah.
L:  She's -- we call each other every once in a while and talk and stuff.  She sells, ah, Tupperware too, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  We talk about that.  She's tried to get me into it and stuff like that too, but --
R:  Oh, boy. [LAUGH]
L:  We talk about them -- yeah, we talk about other stuff, so but I guess you could say she's a pretty good person to talk to every once in a while too.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  I would call her a friend.
