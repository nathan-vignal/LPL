L:  Hello.
R:  [NOISE] Hello, --
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, this is Martha.
L:  Hi, this is Leanne. [SIGH]
R:  Hi, Leanne.
L:  Their topics have gotten really general lately. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  Their topics have gotten very general, I think, lately. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, really. [LAUGH]
L:  Today's t- [SIGH] topic is friends. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you have a lot of them, or a few? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I have a few.  A very few friends, and that's always how I've been, just a couple here and there.  I'm not one of those people who hangs around with big groups of people. [SIGH]  I'm a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kind of quiet person. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I think of myself as pretty quiet too, but I think I have a lot of [NOISE] acquaintances, like people who I may have a conversation with, you know, at work, or --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Like in different -- in different settings, you know, like -- like work or church [NOISE] or sport or something like that.
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  I don't really have --
L:  I kinda lost a couple of those settings lately, so I'm [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, then once you're not working anymore, and you're not going to school -- [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- you're down to home and you're [LAUGH] ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it's kind of, yeah, I've got -- I'm an at home mom.  So, it kind of, ah --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- kind of puts a damper on it a little bit. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah?  So you just have a [NOISE] few friends that --
L:  Yeah.  Well, and I mean --
R:  -- you call?
L:  -- like ones that you don't see -- sometimes see very often.  But, you know, like, my best friend that I've known since kindergarten is in Washington going to school right now, and it's quite a ways away --
R:  [NOISE] Oh. [NOISE]
L:  -- so [SIGH] ...  Not a long ways, but, you know, she [MN] --
R:  So, she's close to me, I'm in Washington. [LAUGH]
L:  Huh?
R:  I'm in Washington.
L:  Oh, she's in --
R:  So ... [MN]
L:  -- she's in Se- 
R:  [MN]
L:  Seattle.  So, yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah, I'm -- I live near -- near Seattle. [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, well, I'm in Oregon, it's not very far but [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, yeah? [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, it's far enough that she doesn't come back very often.  So, I don't see her very often anymore, but ... [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  It's mostly just like [MN] friends of the husband and, you know. [MN]  So busy with the very day life it's hard to fit that other stuff in sometimes. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm, I know what you mean.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah.  This is a very general topic. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [MN] So, I always figure like normal people, you know, they call up a friend and go do something, you know, [NOISE] but I can't really think of anyone that I would just like call up and go do something. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] A- and, "Let's just go do something" yeah.  I think it's the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- older you get the more that doesn't happen too.
R:  [LAUGH] Maybe that's it.
L:  I don't know.  D- d- are you in college or ...?
R:  Yeah, I am. I'm -- I'm, [NOISE] ah, twenty seven.
L:  Oh, okay, so you're -- you're just about hitting that age, yeah.  See, I'm a few years older than that, I'm thirty one.  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I remember it with, er, you know, back when you're in high school, it's like all you do is do things and then, you know --
R:  Well, I don't know.  I never really did that in high school. [LAUGH]
L:  I didn't really either.  I know other people that did.  But I didn't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] I was like, you know, I had a boyfriend I'm now married to, so it's like [LAUGH] we had --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- our own thing going [NOISE] on, but, yeah.  I -- I -- I guess there is a crowd out there somewhere, I just don't know them. [SIGH] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess all my friends are that way too.  So, [LAUGH] they're just ...
R:  Did you marry somebody that's more -- [NOISE] like more social than you, or ...? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  He's a bit, a bit --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but not much.  And I -- I guess if --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it wasn't for that I probably wouldn't be getting out at all. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's pretty much how I am, and I guess if it wasn't for my husband making friends I wouldn't know anybody --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know?
L:  [LAUGH] There you go.  And thank goodness there's email and there's forums and chat boards --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Or I'd have no human contact at all. [LAUGH]  So thank goodness --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- for these talk co- you know, these surveys or [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I wouldn't talk to anybody.  [LAUGH] I'm just kidding; it's not that bad.  [SIGH] You know, you --
R:  [MN].
L:  -- do talk to people, like at a school when you drop off your kids and stuff like that.  But, I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's like good luck trying to find time to do anything with anybody once you have kids.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Unless you have kids the same age, it's like -- it's -- it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- really awkward and hard. [SIGH] "Why don't you get the mommy to babysit?  You can get grandma to babysit". [LAUGH]  We do do that, you know.  Maybe once -- once or twice a month, but ah, yeah, I'm not one of those big, ah, get in a group and go out and spent the whole evening out type of person. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, before we had the baby [NOISE] we used to do stuff like [NOISE] we had a b-, we still have a boat but we never use it.
L:  Oh, you have a baby?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Oh, well you know what it's like then? [LAUGH]
R:  Huh?
L:  You can't just -- you can't just drop everything and go. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  So ...
L:  You just, ah, yeah ...  You kinda have to schedule your fun. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Although I found like it's [NOISE] easy to start and talk to people now because whenever we're -- I don't know, just having a baby people strike up conversations with you, or ...
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You're like a conversation magnet.
R:  Yes.
L:  If you -- if you don't want to talk to people and you've got your kid at home, [MN] don't go out. [LAUGH]
R:  I know, but if I don't leave the house, [NOISE] it's -- I don't know, I can't --
L:  You go crazy.  You go crazy, yeah.
R:  Even like -- I -- I only took a six week maternity leave, [NOISE] and I swear [NOISE] I was just pulling to go back to work. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, were you really?
R:  Well, because o- of not having like a lot of friends and stuff, that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean I would --
L:  I guess nobody was coming to see you, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I mean I was --
L:  That's hard.
R:  -- just like -- I don't have any family around here, and I don't have a whole lot of friends, so it's like, I would be sitting at home and if I didn't have any reason to go out, like anything I needed from the store or anything --
L:  Yeah, make up a reason, yeah.
R:  -- with a little baby, it's like I wouldn't even leave -- step foot outside my apartment for like three days and be like, "Oh, my God --"
L:  I remember those days.
R:  "-- what am I doing?" [LAUGH]
L:  I remember those days.  I have two kids that are sixteen months apart so --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- it got to be really hard to get out.  And I had a lot of bed rest with both of them.  [SIGH] So --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [SIGH] I spent a lot of time in the house, but I was pretty drugged up during that time, so, [LAUGH], you know, [SIGH] oh, yeah.  I can recall.
R:  Well, it's like, I mean, sometimes you can't leave, [NOISE] but sometimes it's just like, "Oh, it's too much trouble.  Or, I -- I don't --" [MN]
L:  It's hard.
R:  It is, so ...
L:  It's hard.  How old is your baby?
R:  She's just turned a year this week.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's getting to be easier then.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  Well, sorta.
R:  Oh, yes quite a lot.  Yeah, we went to the park today, went on a swing and stuff.
L:  Yeah, you [MN] ...
R:  Yeah, it's more fun now. [LAUGH]
L:  Then you've got to find friends that have kids, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And go and do kid oriented things, "So, let's go hang out at, ah, you know, wherever the kids like to hang out". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's hard though, it's hard, yeah.
R:  Like McDonalds. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know, there you go.  Actually, I know people that do that.  My kids --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- don't like McDonalds. [LAUGH] [SIGH] They're weird. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know [NOISE] she's been to McDonalds like [NOISE] three times now, I think.
L:  I can hear her back there, that's so cute. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Been a long time since mine have been that age.  Mine are five and six, so ...
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  So, now it's almost like, --
R: [NOISE]
L:  -- um, they're both getting ready to go to school full time and -- just in the f- fall, so it's almost like a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- whole new thing to look forward to, maybe I can --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- make more friends. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, when they go back to school, are you planning to like go back to work, or --
L:  I'm going --
R:  -- find --
L:  -- to find -- yeah, find something to do, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I need to be there when they're home from school.  And it's kind of hard to work from, you know, nine AM to two thirty in the afternoon and then have all these days off, and sick days, and -- you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Before you know it there's so much time you need off, that --
R:  Want[?] to tell me -- well, I mean just this week --
L:  -- you'd have to have a really flexible job.  Huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you have to be close.
R:  Just this week, you know, I'm -- I'm in my last, [NOISE] you know, six weeks of my job because I'm moving in the middle of June. [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  And so, we've been doing really good so far, I haven't been out of work that much; you know, [NOISE] every now and then.
L:  Right.  Yeah. [MN]
R:  But, Thursday and Friday I was home with my baby [NOISE] because she was sick.
L:  Oh, yeah, huh?
R:  And now, [NOISE] like she is in a home day care and now all her kids are sick. 
L:  On, no.
R:  She's supposed to be so far [NOISE] [inaudible] so, I'm like, "Okay I've --"
L:  Oh, no.
R:  "-- got to go to work".
L:  Yeah, oh no.
R:  And my [NOISE] husband stayed home with her last Monday. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  It gets easier.
R:  Like, he's a car salesman, and it's like, you know, on commission, if he's got appointments and stuff --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it's really terrible to miss work, you know.
L:  Yeah, you can't miss work, [LAUGH] --
R:  I think I -- I have a p- 
L:  -- especially if it's a good day. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's like --
L:  If it's a good day outside.
R:  -- I -- I get a couple of paid sick days, so at least I don't lose any money, you know, but --
L:  Right, you only have so many of it.
R:  -- I don't have any left now.
L:  You -- you can't get sick though.  You're a mommy. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I c- no, I only get sick on weekends.
L:  There you go.
R:  [LAUGH] It's worked pretty --
L:  And then you can't sleep in.
R:  It's worked pretty good so far. [LAUGH]
L:  You're doing pretty well.  It's amazing how your body becomes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, that way, but ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I can [MN] wait -- I can definitely wait, --
R:  [NOISE],
L:  -- so ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] But, yeah, hopefully when I move I'll [NOISE] -- I don't know, I'm going to try to make some more friends [NOISE].  I'm going to go into sales and stuff, so I'll probably meet a lot more people that way.
L:  You won't have a choice but to meet people that way. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's like you have to call people.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You have to go knock on their doors. [LAUGH]
L:  You have to be social. [LAUGH]
R:  You can't put it off. [NOISE]
L:  But it's -- it's very easy to become anti social though when you have kids and all their needs and, yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it really is easy, especially if you're kind of a quiet --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- exclusive group kinda p- kinda p- person to begin with, you know? [SIGH] [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Never been one of those party kinda people. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] No.
L:  Clubs, or anything like that, no, no, no, no, no, that's not me.
R:  No.  I did that for like, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- maybe three weeks.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And that was enough, ah? [LAUGH]
R:  Yes. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay, then you did enough for me too, okay? [LAUGH]  Yeah, I think that would be me too, "Okay, this is old now". [LAUGH]  Maybe I'll do it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- once just to get it over with, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Got to do everything once, they say.
R:  The only thing is, "Oh, yeah, we used to go out dancing in the clubs and stuff".  It's like --
L:  [SIGH] What are you talkin-
R:  -- well, it didn't last very long --
L: [NOISE]
R:  -- but I -- at least I did it, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] At least you could say you were there. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I wasted three weeks of my life, I'm done now, come on.  [MN] Yeah.  I honestly I don't even know those people.  I don't think I'll ever live back to regret that though.
R:  [MN]
L:  Too busy in college.  Too busy in college going to work and like you're doing, you know, taking care of house and, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- being responsible. [SIGH]  Yeah, well most people you age aren't even married yet.  So ...  I mean, I was.
R:  Really?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Most people I know --
R:  Well, actually people like --
L:  -- are barely getting married.  Yeah.  Pretty young.
R:  I look at my sister.  She's like three and a half years younger than me and she has already got three kids.  So ... [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, see I was married when I was twenty, but we didn't have kids until I was [SIGH] twenty five, so ... 
R:  [MN]
L:  I mean that wasn't by choice, that's just what happened, so ...
R:  Oh?  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Difficult situations, you know, all those fun medication things and ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But, anyway, two kids later --
R:  Oh.
L:  [SIGH] Ah, all over. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was like, "What did I do?"  No. [LAUGH]  [SIGH] What
