R:  Our topic -- [LAUGH]
L:  That's a weird topic.  I'm actually starving right now.  So it works out.
R:  [LAUGH] Me too, I'm hungry.  Oh, oh, I guess it was a restaurant, do you like to eat out or you rather eat at home, and I think they said what was your perfect meal or -- was that it?
L:  Yeah.  I like to eat out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I get tired of it.  But, um, if it's not my cooking I like to eat home. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I like to eat out too, but, um, I find that when I eat out, I can never eat it all, so I'm always taking like a doggy bag home with me because I -- for some reason, you know, you -- they fill you up on, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know the soup, the drinks, whatever and I can never, um, you know, finish it.  But what -- what is your favorite food?  What's your perfect meal?
L:  Um, I don't really know.  I like everything.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I like -- I'm a big carbohydrate addict so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I like baked potatoes, you know like, bread and desert --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and sugar and ...
R:  Ev- --
L:  It's so fattening.  Ugh.
R:  Everything I can't have.  I'm on a diet, so I'm trying to, ah, stay away from all that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's very ha- --
L:  I know --
R:  Ahah.

R:  Ahah.
L:  -- it's not bad.  I like it.

L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Jamaican food ...

R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know, just stuff I haven't had before.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, I can't think -- like Thai.  I wouldn't eat Thai for like, a long time, 'cause I thought, "Oh, it's going to make me sick".
R:  Oh.
L:  But it didn't.  I mean, it was fine.
R:  [LAUGH] But I --
L:  And, I don't know, just like -- I don't know like, ah, ah, real -- I -- I hate -- I hate Italian sausage.  Ugh.

L:  Yeah.
R:  But, ah -- ah --
L:  Man, it -- it is hard to diet.
R:  Yeah, it -- it is, very --
L:  I mean, you're trying not to diet --
R:  It is, very difficult for me.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, me too.  I mean, I love to eat -- I love to eat.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And you know, I, ah, went off the carbs for a while --
R:  Ah huh.
L:  -- and ah, I lost like, ten pounds, in like, a second, you know.
R:  Wow.
L:  But it's so hard not to eat -- you know, 'cause I love Coke and I love -- you know, ah, Doctor Pepper and Coke and stuff like that.  And it's the sugar that does it.  The sugar and the carbohydrates that do it to you, and that's the thing I love the best.
R:  Ah huh.
L:  [SIGH] It's hard.
R:  Oh yeah.  I just -- I just love and -- and um, and I also love um, you know, ah, Spanish foods because they're spicy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know like, um, you know some sp- -- here they call it like, baked pig, you know, baked um, [LIPSMACK] pork.
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
R:  And, ah, you know, rice and beans you know, those kind of -- oh.  Those --
L:  Yum.
R:  -- kind of foods, they're spicy with lots of garlic.  I like a lot of garlic in my food.
L:  You know what?
R:  You like it -- huh?
L:  Oh, go ahead.  Go on.
R:  You like Italian, so there must be a lot of garlic in that too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I love garlic.  I -- I could eat garlic -- I -- like when I cook garlic -- cook with garlic, I can eat just the garlic.  I love it.
R:  Oh, man, me too.  I love garlic.
L:  Oh --
R:  Whew.
L:  I know.  We always -- my family -- I'm driving right now, so it's kind of weird.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, my -- my family and I, we always play like, a game.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's um, if you're on like, death row --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and you have to pick your last meal, what would it be?
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  And, you know, that's a real hard one, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I couldn't pick just one thing, you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'd have to pick a whole bunch of stuff. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, I -- give me some seafood, some -- I don't like too much fried of the seafood.  I like, like you know, um, my fish cooked steamed down.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, in -- in, um, [LIPSMACK] in a sauce.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, or -- or -- um, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but not -- not -- not too deep fried, you know, 'cause that's -- you know, I'm just trying to stay away from the fat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, but it -- it is difficult to stick to a diet but -- I love spicy food.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you're hungry now, huh?
L:  I'm starving, and I can't find a grocery store 'cause I've just moved, and I ... really can't find a grocery store. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know where the heck I am.  It's so bad. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Yeah.  I just moved from, ah, North Dallas to ah, downtown Dallas.
R:  Oh.
L:  And so I'm just like -- I -- I think I'm like in the wrong part.  I don't know what I'm doing. [LAUGH] I'm just like, driving around like --
R:  Oh, my goodness.  So where -- where -- what do you have planned to eat tonight?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You don't know.
L:  Um, plan to eat tonight?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I really don't know.  I have to go to the grocery store 'cause I don't have --
R:  Oh.
L:  I just moved on Friday --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and so I don't have like, anything.  I have like, some TV dinners and that's not going to do it.  So ... [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I'll just like, figure something out, you know.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, just try to stay out -- you -- you're not -- you're not overweight are you?
L:  Yeah, I am.
R:  Are you overweight like me?
L:  I'm overweight, yeah.
R:  Ah, yeah, well we gotta s- -- try to stay away from the carbohydrates.  You really do.
L:  Oh, it's so hard.
R:  I know it's hard.  But you have to be disciplined.  I'm trying hard.  I'm trying.
L:  You know, I've been overweight my whole life, and it's like --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- sometimes I just think, you know, well it's -- is it worth, you know, struggling or being happy and eating. [LAUGH] You know but --
R: Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  I think it really is.  It's -- you know what I found out, and I've never been successful dieting because you know, I don't want to, first of all.
R:  Ahah.
L:  And second of all, you know, I'm like, "What's the point?" you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I found out that it's like, little by little.  It's like, little steps that make you, um, loose weight.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's like, the littlest thing.  If you do the littlest thing every day, like -- I cut out Coke, you know, and Doctor Pepper --
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and that -- that like, made me loose ten pounds.
R:  Wow.
L:  You know.  Over, you know -- over the course of like, a month, you know.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And um, then I cut out -- and then I just -- 'cause -- 'cause at my work, they pay for our lunch, and so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, you -- it's real easy to order, you know like, the grossest stuff, you know the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the most fattening stuff.  So I just -- what I did was, I'd order like, the most fattening stuff, but I would only eat half.
R:  Oh.
L:  And then -- 'cause you know, 'cause they give you a lot, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so I only ate half and then I would save the ha- -- the rest of it and eat it for dinner.  And that was really hard because, you know, I'm --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- when -- after work, I'm still hungry, you know.
R:  Yeah, wow.
L:  So -- but anyway, I lost like -- I went home to see my family and they were like, "Wow, you've lost weight, you've lost weight", but I mean, a little on me goes a lo- -- long way. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I weigh like, so much so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  Anyway! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK] It's -- you know, it's so -- it's the hardest thing ever, is to diet for me, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Well, y- -- since your favorite food is Italian, it's -- it's, ah, kind of difficult, if that's all you're going to eat, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is Italian food.  If you're going to lean toward that it's going to be hard anyway.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because, you know, that's loaded with a lot -- the pasta, you know, those carbohydrates.  You know?
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  But um, I -- I -- like, have you tasted Indian food?
L:  No, I haven't.  That's -- that's one of the things I'm scared [LAUGH] --
R:  That's so spicy.  I love Indian food, because it's really spicy, and it's --it's -- th- -- they have -- make a relish like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it -- you know, to go with the f- -- it's like they're hot s- -- hot sauce and it's a relish.  It is so hot --
