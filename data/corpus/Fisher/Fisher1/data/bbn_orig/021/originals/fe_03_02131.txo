L:  Hello.
R:  Hello. [NOISE]
L:  Yes, ah, my name Gene O'Donnell.
R:  Hi, how you doing, my name is Jen.
L:  Jen, where do you live?
R:  I'm in New York City.  Where are you?
L:  Oh, I'm in a Philadelphia. [SIGH]
R:  Where are you?
L:  Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, got you, okay.
L:  [SIGH] So, listen, we're supposed to talk about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- some food today.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Why don't you tell me how the restaurants are up there in New York?
R:  [SIGH] The restaurants up here are great.  I mean, there's a lot to choose from.  I do like eating out, however, um, right now work is kind of slow, so, um, don't really have the money to do it and, um, they also banned smoking everywhere, so that's --
L:  How about that, huh?  Is that hurting the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, restaurants over there?
R:  [NOISE] It -- actually, I think it is, because there's no -- [SIGH] ah, people don't get a choice at this point.  It's not like, [MN] you know -- basically what I think that they should do as far as that's concerned, um, this might be a little off the topic but, [SIGH] is, um, you know, [MN] treat it like a liquor licence.  People should get smoking licenses, so people have a choice, you know.  But, ah, right now, yeah, it's definitely hurting that industry, bars and restaurants. [SIGH]
L:  Wow, it must be.  So what kind of food do you like?
R:  [SIGH] Um, I like Italian, I like Mexican a lot, and, um, [SIGH] you know --
L:  Do you cook it?
R:  -- regular American food. [SIGH]
L:  Do you cook it yourself, or ar you a good cook?
R:  I'm not a cook. [SIGH]  I nuke a lot of stuff. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's me.  I nuke a lot of stuff.  My wife's a good cook though.  But she is Italian, so we have a lot of Italian food and, ah, a lot of large dinner parties with, um, you know, red sauce.  But I enjoy nice pizza.  Last night we ordered out, I got pizza and a cheesecake.
R:  Excellent.
L:  And, ah, cheesecake in Philadelphia is, ah, pretty good.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I've heard.
L:  And pizza, you know, w- you can order pizza from ten different places and, ah, you get ten different types of pizza.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Oh, yeah, every place is different.  So ...
R:  Not like a Dominoes type a --
L:  Oh, my God, no.  Dominoes is not the type of pizza that we would order.  That's, ah ...
R:  No.
L:  They sell a lot of it -- they sell a lot of it, they really do.
R:  Yeah, they do.  Yeah.  I mean, actually, I like Dominoes, I like some of their, ah, [SIGH] side stuff, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- their wings and stuff, but their pizza is kind of, ah, cardboard tasting.
L:  You got it.
R:  [SIGH] But, ah, yeah.  So ... [SIGH] I mean, I -- I eat in a lot but, um, I don't eat very, ah, ah, you know elaborate meals.  [SIGH] Um, don't have a very healthy diet actually. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-oh.
R:  [SIGH] But, um, you know, I enjoy different types of foods.
L:  That's not good.  You're gonna have high cholesterol.
R:  Yeah.  I've actually, ah, actually had high cholesterol for a while, and it [SIGH] came down.  I haven't been tested in a while, so I don't know about that but, ah ...
L:  Well, w- w- I will say this much: food is -- good food is really good.
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  And, ah, like I said, pizza's good.  You go out -- I like to get, um, salted pretzels.  They sell a lot of salted pretzels on the street [several inaudible words].
R:  Yeah, we have that here also.  They're very good.
L:  Well, you know, they wouldn't be good at home, but they're good out in the streets, and --
R:  Yeah they are. [NOISE]
L:  -- put a little mustard on them and away you go.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK] But, I don't know how clean they are, the guys that, ah --
R:  [SIGH] I don't even want to think about that. [LAUGH]  It's better not to know with certain things like that. [SIGH] That --
L:  Yeah.  I wonder how many calories a salted pretzel is?
R:  I -- I would imagine it wouldn't be too high in calories, pretzels are pretty low fat, very high in carbs though.
L:  [MN] Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  But, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think they are about a buck a piece now and maybe -- maybe a little more but --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, they are even more than that on the street here.
L:  Some of them on the street [NOISE] are like rocks.
R:  Yeah, it depends I mean, because they will try to get away with giving you something that was from, ah, yesterday. [NOISE]
L:  So, ah, what kind of food stores do you have, ah -- [NOISE] where did you say you were from, New York?
R:  New York City, yeah.
L:  What kind of food stores?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I never see a food store in New York City.  Where -- at Manhattan?
R:  Like supermarkets?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, they're -- we -- we've got 'em.  [SIGH] We've got, um -- Wholefoods is, you know, a big one, that [NOISE] -- I know that's a chain.  I know they have them in LA, I'm not sure about anywhere else.  [SIGH], but ah it's more, [NOISE] you know, [NOISE] healthy.  I mean, it's a regular supermarket but they sell [NOISE] more like fresh produce and, um, [NOISE] healthy stuff.
L:  Do they have any big -- like an Acme?
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Well, maybe in ...
R:  They have stuff -- well, they're like Acmes.  [NOISE] We have, um, [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] Associated Supermarket is one of the chains, [NOISE] Pioneer, um, [NOISE] there's like one Pathmark up in Harlem that I've seen.
L:  Yikes.
R:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, everything else is, ah, a- -- I haven't seen them outside of this city but they -- I've seen several of them in the city, like Pioneer and Associated.  [SIGH] Um, [MN] what else?  Food Emporium, that's another one, big one but, um [MN] ...
L:  There's a place -- what's the name of the place?  We take a subway, it's up around Eightieth.  No, it might be higher than that.  It's a food s- -- it's kinda like a food store, but they sell a lot of things for food.  It's a bit, um ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Maybe it's a Huntingtons[?].  I forget what it's called.
R:  East side or west side?
L:  West?
R:  Ah, [NOISE] yeah, I'm on the east side. [NOISE]
L:  I forget where it is.  But th- -- it's a big, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  No, it's not like a restaurant, they sell a lot of food but, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Is that place 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, Moma Leonie's still open up there?
R:  I believe so.  I've never been there, but I, ah, [SIGH] I d-
L:  Every get down to the vill- the Italian, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Little Italy?  It's a --
R:  I have been down there.
L:  That's nice.
R:  I -- it's been a while though.  I can't, ah, remember the last time I ate down there. [SIGH] But, ah, [NOISE] yeah, times are tight.  I can't even remember the last time I ate out actually. [SIGH] [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, um, [SIGH] [NOISE] [SIGH] I don't know. [SIGH]  What do y --
L:  So, you buy a lot of food and nuke it, huh?
R:  [SIGH] Pretty much.  Or, you know, [NOISE] sandwiches, deli stuff, you know, anything quick, because I'm usually running around.  Um, home cooked meals are definitely few and far between because I don't really cook. [SIGH]
L:  You --
R:  But, ah --
L:  You could have a lot of toast and bagels then, right?
R:  Yeah, unfortunately.  I mean, I -- I try not to load up on carbs at every meal, but, ah, yeah.  It -- it's kinda hard to do when, ah, you're running around.
L:  What's [several inaudible words]?
R:  The other day I had one of those soft pretzels like for lunch and I didn't eat for like eight hours after that.  It was just like a meal, which it shouldn't be, but [SIGH]...
L:  Well, they're big.  Let's see, I had, ah, ah, the night bef-
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- oh, the night before we had, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stuffed chicken, which was delicious.  And there was a nice little sauce on it, some, ah --
R:  That sound good.
L:  -- rice, and ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it was stuffed with filling and -- and the top of it had, ah, two pieces of prosciutto so you end up being thirsty all night.  But you --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- but you can't say that because if you say that then you don't get it the next time.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] [SIGH]
L:  It was good.  And, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- b- but you gotta be careful --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- food can, um -- the wrong kind of food and you gain --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a significant amount of weight.
R:  Oh, yeah. [NOISE]  That's [SIGH] --
L:  You have ma- major health problems.
R:  Unfortunately most of the, ah, good foods are the fattening foods. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Or like ice cream.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, exactly.  Oh, I had some of that yesterday. [NOISE]
L:  You should eat ice cream every day of the week.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] [NOISE]
L:  Really.  Especially now, we haven't -- ah, it's up to eighty degrees already today, so ...
R:  Really?  Yeah, it's supposed to be here, ah, too.  But, who knows, tomorrow I might go, ah, --
L:  I might stop and get some Italian water ice.
R:  -- what the heck again, yeah.  Yeah.  It's crazy.
L:  I mean, you're supposed to have to good Ital- good Italian -- Ralph's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I was up in, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Staten Island last week, and there's a place called --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a little dive called Ralph's --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- Water Ice.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And I guess Staten Island is totally different from Manhattan.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Pretty much.  I don't think I've ever set foot on Staten Island, actually.
L:  Never?
R:  I don't think so.  Seems that's the only borough I haven't been to.
L:  Well, that's supposed to -- a- a- actually I had dinner over there a couple --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- couple of weeks ago, it was fabulous there too.  But, you know, you, er -- er like, er, what's the Carnegie Deli and there's another Deli right up there by the Carnegie Deli in Manhattan?
R:  Oh, like around Time Square?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um ...
L:  They give you a sandwich --
R:  The Stage Deli.
L:  Yeah, Stage -- Stage Deli.  Stage Door Deli, or Stage Deli --
R:  [NOISE] Ye-
L:  -- they give you a sandwich --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- about nine inches s- -- it's so high you can't even eat it, I mean it's ridiculous.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  It's ridiculous.
R:  [NOISE] But --
L:  And the sandwich --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is like eighteen dollars, --
R:  [NOISE] and y- -- and yo- you have to say, "Bag this"  you know, you couldn't --
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  And there are people in there -- they're mob, mob, mob.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, um, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they have extra long tooth picks holding their sandwiches together.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah, exactly. [NOISE] It's very difficult to eat those.
L:  If you're pounding one of those down every day for lunch you'd be heavy.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Real heavy.
R:  Absolutely.  I try to stay away from, ah, [SIGH] from that area anyway-
L:  How about pop --
R:  -- touristy areas, but, ah ...
L:  How about popcorn?  Now that's low in calories if you get the microwave stuff.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I'm big on that.  [NOISE] Snack food.
L:  That and a couple of glasses of water and you're full for the night.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  And l- like coffee, also.  I drink way too much coffee, but, ah, [SIGH] it actually fills you up sometimes. [NOISE] [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, sometimes it does, but ah, you know, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sometimes you need, you know -- food's like gasoline for your body, you gotta put something decent in there occas-
R:  Yeah.  I know.  I actually, ah, I need to go food shopping today and, um, get some real food because, ah, I've got nothing but junk in my house right now.
L:  Do you have Tasty Cakes up there?
R:  [SIGH] We do. [MN]  I don't, ah, I don't eat 'em all that often, but we've got it.  Krispy Kreme also, donuts.
L:  Oh, yeah, oh yeah.  Had some of those yesterday morning.
R:  Those are great. [MN]
L:  Had some of those yesterday morning.
R:  Those are excellent. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, but they're too easy to go through.  I mean you can --
R:  E-
L:  -- eat six of them, they're all air.
R:  Exactly.  I don't buy them and bring them home.  If I want one I'll get one, and then I'll just --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know, that'll be it. [SIGH]
L:  They're all air.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they're make -- they're making
