SO WHO DO YOU CONSIDER TO BE A THREAT  (fe_03_01718-B-0003)
IS WHAT  (fe_03_01718-B-0004)
RUSSIA  (fe_03_01718-B-0005)
I KIND OF THINK THAT NORTH KOREA IS DEFINITELY A THREAT TO US RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_01718-B-0006)
I I JUST I DON'T TRUST THEM M- M- WITH THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE NUCLEAR MISSILES AND AND UH [SIGH] WITH THE WAY THAT THEY'VE BEEN ACTING  (fe_03_01718-B-0007)
AND NOW THAT IRAQ  (fe_03_01718-B-0008)
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD DEFINITELY CONCENTRATE ON NORTH KOREA  (fe_03_01718-B-0009)
I USED TO THINK THAT PALESTINE WAS A THREAT ALSO BUT NOT ANY MORE  (fe_03_01718-B-0010)
YEAH THAT'S HOW I FEEL ALSO I MEAN AS SOON AS AS WE TOLD THEM TO CLOSE THEIR BORDERS  (fe_03_01718-B-0011)
IT THEY AND THEY M- RESPONDED THAT'S [SIGH] THAT SHOWS GOOD INTENTION TO ME AND UM THEY'D BE FOOLISH TO TAKE ON THE UNITED STATES 'CAUSE THEY'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENED IN IRAQ  (fe_03_01718-B-0012)
SO THAT WOULD JUST BE RIDICULOUS OF THEM  (fe_03_01718-B-0013)
[LIPSMACK] I THINK THAT DEFINITELY IF PALESTINE WERE LARGER I'D SAY THAT THEY WERE A THREAT BUT  (fe_03_01718-B-0014)
[SIGH] WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON UH IN THAT WHOLE REGION I THINK THAT  (fe_03_01718-B-0015)
WE MAY FIND THAT SOMEBODY WHO WE DON'T THINK IS A THREAT MIGHT BE A THREAT LATER ON  (fe_03_01718-B-0016)
TO US  (fe_03_01718-B-0017)
I- IT IS IT IS AND AND THEY'RE EXTREMISTS SO WHEN YOU HAVE AN EXTREMIST RELIGION LIKE THAT IT JUST I- IT BREEDS HATRED AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE SH- STILL SHOULDN'T RULE OUT THE AFGHAN REGION ALSO  (fe_03_01718-B-0018)
YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT BE A THREAT TO THE WHOLE COUNTRY BUT THEY MAY HAVE CELLS INSIDE THAT COUNTRY OR INSIDE OUR COUNTRY EVEN  (fe_03_01718-B-0019)
MHM I THINK THAT THEY HAVE TOO MANY UM [LIPSMACK] RELATIONS WITH MONEY WITH US YOU KNOW AND AND WITH ENGLAND AS WELL TO EVEN GO THERE  (fe_03_01718-B-0021)
[LIPSMACK] AND AND IT'S SUCH A LARGE COUNTRY THAT IF ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN WITH THEM IT WOULD BE SO HARD FOR US TO I MEAN WE WE COULD DO IT OBVIOUSLY WE'D WIN BUT IT WOULD [SIGH] IT WOULD BE TEN TIMES WORSE THAN WHAT HAPPENED IN IRAQ 'CAUSE THEY'RE SO LARGE  (fe_03_01718-B-0022)
YOU KNOW BUT STILL I DO NOT TRUST NORTH KOREA WHATSOEVER  (fe_03_01718-B-0023)

MISSILES AND THEY'VE ADMITTED THAT THEY HAVE SOME THAT CAN GO PRETTY FAR  (fe_03_01718-B-0026)

PERSON YOU KNOW AND YOU KNOW RACK ONE MORE UP I BELIEVE THAT  (fe_03_01718-B-0028)
IRAQ NEEDED TO BE TAKEN CARE OF  (fe_03_01718-B-0029)
