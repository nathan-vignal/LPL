WELL I'LL TELL YOU IT'S REALLY CURIOUS I TEND TO UM  (fe_03_01767-A-0014)
THINK ABOUT THE QUESTION OF WHAT COUNTRIES REPRESENT A THREAT TO OUR COUNTRY AND I THINK THAT IN LOTS OF WAYS I MAKE A BIG DISTINCTION BETWEEN A THREAT TO OUR  (fe_03_01767-A-0015)
COUNTRY VERSUS A THREAT TO OUR WAY OF LIFE AND UM  (fe_03_01767-A-0016)
IT'S AMAZING THAT UM UNTIL SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH I JUST REALLY DIDN'T THINK THAT THERE WAS A  (fe_03_01767-A-0017)
[LIPSMACK] SET THAT I WOULD LIVE IN A LIVE IN A WORLD IN WHICH THERE REALLY WAS SOME FEAR  (fe_03_01767-A-0018)
THAT SOME PERSONAL HARM COULD POTENTIALLY COME TO ME OR MY CHILDREN OR MY FAMILY AND I THINK THAT UM [MN]  (fe_03_01767-A-0019)
IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO TO UNDERSTAND WHAT COUNTRIES POSE A RISK VERSUS CERTAIN  (fe_03_01767-A-0020)
GROUPS AND I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT UM FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND THE COUNTRIES THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRIES UM DIRECTLY PROVIDING UM  (fe_03_01767-A-0021)
SUPPORT OR DIRECTIVELY IT'S DIRECTLY WORKING UM OR DOING THINGS THAT PUT US  (fe_03_01767-A-0022)
SPECIFICALLY IN HARM'S WAY I MEAN I READ NEWS REPORTS ABOUT CERTAIN COUNTRIES PROVIDING SUPPORT TO TERRORIST FUNDAMENTALIST GROUPS  (fe_03_01767-A-0023)
AND I SUPPOSE THOSE WOULD BE THE COUNTRIES THAT CONCERN ME  (fe_03_01767-A-0024)
[LIPSMACK] MOST UM  (fe_03_01767-A-0025)
BUT TO ME I'M A LITTLE BIT MORE CONCERNED ABOUT INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS VERSUS  (fe_03_01767-A-0026)
ENTITIES AS LARGE AS A COUNTRY IF THAT MAKES SENSE  (fe_03_01767-A-0027)

MY MY FEELING IS THAT THE CLOSER THAT YOU'VE FELT FROM A PROXIMITY AT THE SAME POINT TO WHAT HAPPENED ON SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH  (fe_03_01767-A-0035)
THE MORE FEAR I THINK YOU HAVE SO BECAUSE I LIVED CLOSE TO BOSTON  (fe_03_01767-A-0036)
YOU KNOW IMMEDIATELY AFTER SEPTEMBER ELEVEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE TOWERS WENT DOWN THAT FIRST DAY I CAN REMEMBER SITTING IN MY OFFICE AND MY OFFICE IS ABOUT SIX MILES OUTSIDE OF BOSTON  (fe_03_01767-A-0037)
I CAN REMEMBER [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_01767-A-0038)
VIVIDLY HEARING THE LACK OF PLANES THE LACK OF AIRPLANES  (fe_03_01767-A-0039)
AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THE AIR WOULD BE PUNCTUATED BY THE SOUND OF JET PLANES ALL OF A SUDDEN THESE F16 JET PLANES WERE THE ONLY SOUND OF PLANE IN THE AIR THAT DAY  (fe_03_01767-A-0040)
AND YET BECAUSE THEY WERE F16S THEY WERE SO LOUD THAT EVERY SINGLE TIME I HEARD A PLANE FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS THERE IS JUST THIS FEAR FACTOR  (fe_03_01767-A-0041)
BECAUSE OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND I THINK THAT OUR REACTIONS BECAUSE WE BOTH LIVE SO CLOSE TO CITIES WHERE  (fe_03_01767-A-0042)

GOOD TO WATCH IS TO SEE HOW IRAQ KIND OF FALLS OUT IT CONCERNS ME THAT THERE IS SO MUCH RELIGION THAT GETS INVOLVED  (fe_03_01767-A-0050)
IN THIS AND THERE'S OFTEN A PERCEPTION YOU KNOW INTERNATIONALLY THAT THIS IS A CHRISTIAN ATTACK AGAINST AN ISLAMIC STATE AND I MEAN I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT [MN]  (fe_03_01767-A-0051)
I DON'T THINK FROM AN AMERICAN SENSE IT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH RELIGION  (fe_03_01767-A-0052)
