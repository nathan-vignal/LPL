FIVE CHILDREN RIGHT NOW THEY'RE AGED SEVENTEEN THROUGH TWENTY SIX AND THE AH  (fe_03_01792-B-0006)
IT'S BEEN AMAZING HOW POSITIVE THE EFFECTS OF COMPUTERS HAVE BEEN FOR THEM  (fe_03_01792-B-0007)
I REMEMBER WHEN THEY WERE YOUNGER AND THEY WERE CONTRIBUTING OR PARTICIPATING IN SCIENCE FAIRS EVEN IN JUNIOR HIGH AND GRADE SCHOOL  (fe_03_01792-B-0008)
AND I USED TO SAY WELL  (fe_03_01792-B-0009)

THE WORLD NOW IS IS A WORLD OF COMPUTERS JUST THINK WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE WHEN THEY BECOME AH ADULTS IN THIS WORLD  (fe_03_01792-B-0027)
AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S THE GIFT THAT YOU'RE GIVING TO YOUR CHILDREN IS THAT EDUCATION  (fe_03_01792-B-0028)
I CAN REMEMBER AGAIN WHEN MY SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WAS LIKE IN THE FIFTH GRADE AND SHE WAS DOING WELL MAYBE YOU'RE A SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHER BUT SHE HAD TO DO A REPORT ON BOLIVIA  (fe_03_01792-B-0029)

MOVIES AND VOICE AND SHE TOOK IT IN TO SCHOOL AND YOU KNOW EVEN THE STEREOTYPE FIFTH GRADE BOYS  (fe_03_01792-B-0033)
WHO COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT BOLIVIA'S MAJOR EXPORTS  (fe_03_01792-B-0034)
THEY WERE VERY INTERESTED THEY PAID ATTENTION THEY EVEN ASKED QUESTIONS  (fe_03_01792-B-0035)
NOW THESE KIDS ARE GETTING HOOKED BY BY LEARNING BY THE MEDIA THAT'S BEING PRESENTED TO THEM  (fe_03_01792-B-0036)
I THINK THE UM THE RESOURCES  (fe_03_01792-B-0037)
THAT THESE KIDS FIND OUT LIKE YOU SAID  (fe_03_01792-B-0038)
UM  (fe_03_01792-B-0039)
LITERALLY TO BE ABLE TO GO AND ACCESS AH  (fe_03_01792-B-0040)
INFORMATION THAT EVEN OUR LARGEST LIBRARY COULD NEVER EVEN BEGIN TO AH  (fe_03_01792-B-0041)
TO CONTAIN  (fe_03_01792-B-0042)
AND SOMETHING THAT SOMETHING THAT I'VE LEARNED AND ALSO READ ABOUT IS THOSE GAMES ARE  (fe_03_01792-B-0043)
THOSE ARE REALLY LEARNING EXPERIENCES  (fe_03_01792-B-0044)
I MEAN AGAIN YOU'RE KIND OF TRICKING THESE KIDS BECAUSE  (fe_03_01792-B-0045)
I'M SURE YOUR KIDS THEY KNOW WHAT A MOUSE IS  (fe_03_01792-B-0046)
THEY KNOW WHERE THEY THEY KNOW WHAT A DISK DRIVE IS THEY KNOW WHAT A MONITOR IS  (fe_03_01792-B-0047)
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'VE BEEN TAKING COMPUTER TRAINING WHILE THEY'VE BEEN PLAYING  (fe_03_01792-B-0048)
AND ANOTHER THING THAT HAPPENED WITH THESE COMPUTERS THAT JUST IS A TREMENDOUS ASSET IS AH  (fe_03_01792-B-0049)
WHEN MY OLDEST SON SHOWED UP FOR AH LET'S SEE  (fe_03_01792-B-0050)
HE TOOK TYPING AS AN AS A SOPHOMORE IN HIGH SCHOOL  (fe_03_01792-B-0051)

'CAUSE HE HAD NOT TAKING YOU KNOW NOT ONE MINUTE  (fe_03_01792-B-0055)
OF UM OF TYPING TRAINING  (fe_03_01792-B-0056)
AND IT ALL CAME FROM JUST UM  (fe_03_01792-B-0057)
PLAYING COMPUTER GAMES  (fe_03_01792-B-0058)
I STILL HUNT AND PECK WITH TWO FINGERS NOW BUT I THINK MY  (fe_03_01792-B-0059)
MY EXPERIENCE ON THE COMPUTERS HAVE SPED ME UP ALSO  (fe_03_01792-B-0060)
I THINK UM  (fe_03_01792-B-0061)
I THINK IT ALSO MORE THAN JUST THE AUTOMATION EXPERIENCE AND MAYBE EVEN MORE THAN  (fe_03_01792-B-0062)
THAN ACCESSING ALL THE INFORMATION ON LINE  (fe_03_01792-B-0063)
IT TRAINS THEIR MINDS TO BE  (fe_03_01792-B-0064)
TO BE PROBLEM SOLVING AND TECHNICALLY ORIENTATED  (fe_03_01792-B-0065)
HAVE YOU BOUGHT THEM LAPTOPS YET [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01792-B-0066)
I'VE HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE I THINK THE LAPTOPS BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY HAVE TO BE MORE COMPACT THERE AH THERE ARE THINGS HECK I EVEN HAVE TROUBLE TURNING ONE ON  (fe_03_01792-B-0067)
AND SEE ONCE AGAIN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE LEARNED JUST BY BEING AROUND THAT UM  (fe_03_01792-B-0069)
THIS IS MORE EDUCATION THAT YOU'VE GIVEN TO YOUR CHILDREN JUST JUST BY AH GIVING THEM THE ENVIRONMENT BEING BY ALLOWING THEM TO BE AROUND COMPUTERS  (fe_03_01792-B-0070)
YOU'VE EDUCATED JUST BY HAVING IT BE THERE IN YOUR HOUSE AND YOU AND LETTING THEM HAVE THE ACCESS TO IT  (fe_03_01792-B-0071)
