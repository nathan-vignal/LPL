WELL I'M NOT SURE WHAT THEY MEANT BY ANY OTHER COUNTRY BUT UM  (fe_03_01758-A-0005)

SEEN THE ANALYSIS OF TERRORISM THE ANALYSIS OF YOU KNOW POSING THREAT HOW THE MATTER MATTERS THEY ARE USING  (fe_03_01758-B-0011)
IT'S MORE ABOUT WHICH ORGANISATION  (fe_03_01758-B-0012)
IS A THREAT  (fe_03_01758-B-0013)
RATHER THAN A COUNTRY BECAUSE  (fe_03_01758-B-0014)
THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE TRULY  (fe_03_01758-B-0015)
LIKE GLOBAL  (fe_03_01758-B-0016)

ANY COUNTRY TO THAT COUNTRY ITSELF IN FACT IT COULD BE JUST A LOT OF THE COUNTRY LIKE WE SEEN IN THE CASE OF IRAQ IT DOES NOT  (fe_03_01758-B-0026)
NOW THE YOU KNOW THE REAL THING IS NOT IRAQ WE ARE NOT AGAINST IRAQ WE ARE AGAINST THE RULERS  (fe_03_01758-B-0027)
