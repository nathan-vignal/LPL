HI I'M SIMONE  (fe_03_01769-B-0002)
HI  (fe_03_01769-B-0003)
I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THAT ANY COUNTRIES ARE A THREAT TO THE U._S. UM  (fe_03_01769-B-0004)
I I WAS CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW  (fe_03_01769-B-0006)
I DON'T THINK THAT ANY COUNTRIES ARE A THREAT TO THE U._S. UM  (fe_03_01769-B-0007)
DO DO YOU THINK THAT THERE ARE COUNTRIES THAT ARE A THREAT  (fe_03_01769-B-0009)
SO YOU THINK THAT THEY'RE A THREAT BECAUSE OF WHAT WE DID WHAT THE WAR THAT WE [NOISE] UM  (fe_03_01769-B-0010)
WENT THERE BUT WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THEY WOULD BE A THREAT I MEAN WHAT  (fe_03_01769-B-0011)
I ACTUALLY DON'T WATCH T._V. AT ALL EITHER UM [LIPSMACK] I LISTEN TO THE RADIO BUT FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD THEY HAVEN'T UM  (fe_03_01769-B-0012)
SO YOU THINK THAT IF HE WERE IN POWER OR IF HE UM  (fe_03_01769-B-0013)
[LIPSMACK] CAME BACK THAT THERE COULD BE A THREAT EITHER  (fe_03_01769-B-0014)
UM IRAQ AS A NATION OR SOME INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE WITHIN IRAQ  (fe_03_01769-B-0016)
OKAY SOM-  (fe_03_01769-B-0017)
MM  (fe_03_01769-B-0018)
UM  (fe_03_01769-B-0019)
SO I I PROBABLY WOULD KIND AH SORT OF AGREE WITH YOU JUST BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WHEN I SAY I DON'T THINK ANY COUNTRIES ARE A THREAT IT'S BASICALLY BECAUSE UM [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_01769-B-0020)
I WELL I MEAN I I DO THINK THAT IF WE THREATEN OTHER NATIONS UM  (fe_03_01769-B-0021)
YOU KNOW WITH OUR POWER NOT NECESSARILY JUST WITH WAR BUT WITH OUR POLICIES THAT THERE'S  (fe_03_01769-B-0022)
A DANGER UM THAT COUNTRIES BEGIN TO SEE US AS THE CAUSE OF A LOT OF THEIR PROBLEMS  (fe_03_01769-B-0023)
AND SO UM IN THAT SENSE THERE'S  (fe_03_01769-B-0024)
A POTENTIAL FOR THAT BUT I DON'T I DON'T NECESSARILY FEEL A THREAT IN THE SAME WAY THAT I HEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH AND HOW YOU KNOW THEY CAN ATTACK US AT ANY MOMENT I ACTUALLY HEARD SOMEBODY SPEAKING TODAY ABOUT HOW  (fe_03_01769-B-0025)
UM AMERICAN LIVES ARE UM THREATENED YOU NEVER KNOW AT ANY MOMENT UM WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US IS A TARGET  (fe_03_01769-B-0026)
UM  (fe_03_01769-B-0027)
BUT I THINK THAT I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S NECESSARILY ANY WORSE NOW THAN IT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN  (fe_03_01769-B-0028)
OTHER GROUPS THAT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TARGETED AMERICANS BUT YOU COULD HAVE WHILE TRAVELLING IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES YOU COULD HAVE UM  (fe_03_01769-B-0029)
BEEN LIKE A CASUALTY OF OF A TARGET OF SOMEBODY ELSE  (fe_03_01769-B-0030)
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING LIKE [MN] IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE IN OTHER COUNTRIES TARGETED OR UM NOT JUST AN INDIVIDUAL BUT SAY [MN] THE EXAMPLE THAT I ALWAYS THINK OF IS LIKE THE I._R._A. IF IF THEY PLANT BOMBS IN BRITAIN  (fe_03_01769-B-0031)
YOU AS A TRAVELLER COULD POTENTIALLY BE HIT BY THAT AND SO I DON'T THINK THAT UM  (fe_03_01769-B-0032)
[LIPSMACK] THAT THAT NECESSARILY MAKES US ANY MORE OF A THREAT TODAY JUST BECAUSE  (fe_03_01769-B-0033)
FOR THE MOST PART NO AMERICANS ARE TRAVELLING TO THE PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE  (fe_03_01769-B-0034)
IRAQIS LIVE OR WHERE AFGHANS LIVE OR DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING SO I DON'T THINK THAT WE'RE ANY MORE THREATENED RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_01769-B-0035)
THAN WE HAVE BEEN AND I DON'T THINK THAT  (fe_03_01769-B-0036)
YEAH YEAH WE AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS A COUNTRY JUST BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT ANY OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE ANY OF THE WEAPONS THAT  (fe_03_01769-B-0037)
COULD POSSIBLY EVEN REACH THE UNITED STATES  (fe_03_01769-B-0038)
SO  (fe_03_01769-B-0039)
THAT  (fe_03_01769-B-0041)
THAT'S TRUE BUT I DON'T I MEAN I THINK THAT THOSE  (fe_03_01769-B-0042)
[MN] I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT IT INTO WORDS BUT I BASICALLY DON'T THINK THAT UM  (fe_03_01769-B-0043)
THAT [MN] A PERSON CAN  (fe_03_01769-B-0044)
THINK ABOUT THOSE KINDS OF THINGS LIKE I MEAN IN A SENSE SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH IS COMPLETELY A FLUKE  (fe_03_01769-B-0045)
THAT IT WENT OFF THE WAY THAT IT DID  (fe_03_01769-B-0046)
UM [LIPSMACK] AND SO  (fe_03_01769-B-0047)
WHILE THERE ARE CREATIVE WAYS OF  (fe_03_01769-B-0048)
GETTING AROUND NOT HAVING THE SAME CAPABILITIES MILITARILY THAT THE UNITED STATES HAVE I DON'T THINK THAT I STILL JUST DON'T THINK THE UNITED STATES IS HEAVILY THREATENED WHEN I HEAR BUSH OR OTHER PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT  (fe_03_01769-B-0049)
OH THE U._S. IS YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01769-B-0050)
THERE'S THIS THREAT WE HAVE TO GIVE UP OUR CIVIL LIBERTIES I JUST I DON'T SEE THAT I DON'T SEE US AS BEING IN IMMINENT THREAT OR IMMINENTLY THREATENED  (fe_03_01769-B-0051)
UM BY OTHER NATIONS AT ALL OR EVEN PEOPLE FROM THOSE OTHER NATIONS  (fe_03_01769-B-0052)
MHM WHERE DID YOU STUDY ABROAD  (fe_03_01769-B-0053)
WHEN YOU SAY US WHAT DO YOU MEAN LIKE AMERICANS OR THAT THEY DISLIKE OUR GOVERNMENT OR THAT THEY DISLIKE THE ATTITUDE OF AMERICANS OR  (fe_03_01769-B-0056)
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY LIKE THAT THEY HATE US BUT THAT THEY HATE OUR ATTITUDE  (fe_03_01769-B-0057)
MHM  (fe_03_01769-B-0058)
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE WE CREATE THOSE STEREOTYPES OURSELVES IN A SENSE I MEAN AND WE'RE MAKING PEOPLE HATE US HATE US WITH THOSE  (fe_03_01769-B-0059)
UM STEREOTYPES EITHER BASICALLY THROUGH THE MEDIA BUT I THINK LIKE THE KINDS OF POLICIES THAT OUR GOVERNMENT UM  (fe_03_01769-B-0060)
MAKES ALSO KIND OF STEREOTYPES US IN A SENSE BY  (fe_03_01769-B-0061)
MAKING IT LIKE WE'RE VERY INDIVIDUALISTIC WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OUR OWN CHOICES WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY LIKE HOW INDIVIDUALLY AMERICANS THINK BUT IN A SENSE LIKE I FEEL LIKE THE GOVERNMENT IS STEREOTYPING US BY DOING THAT  (fe_03_01769-B-0062)
MHM  (fe_03_01769-B-0063)
SO  (fe_03_01769-B-0065)
WHEN YOU WERE TRAVELLING ABROAD DID YOU MEET NON BRITISH PEOPLE WHO  (fe_03_01769-B-0066)
UM  (fe_03_01769-B-0067)
EITHER DISLIKED AMERICA OR WHO YOU THOUGHT WERE A THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES  (fe_03_01769-B-0068)
BUT HE WASN'T HE WASN'T BRITISH  (fe_03_01769-B-0069)
WHAT LIKE WHAT DID HE SAY  (fe_03_01769-B-0071)
MHM  (fe_03_01769-B-0072)
[NOISE]  (fe_03_01769-B-0073)
MHM  (fe_03_01769-B-0074)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01769-B-0075)
BUT DO YOU THINK THAT BRITISH PEOPLE ARE A THREAT  (fe_03_01769-B-0076)
BUT BEFORE YOU WERE SAYING THAT THERE WERE BRITISH PEOPLE WHO HATE AMERICA SO DO YOU THINK THAT THAT HATRED CARRIES OVER TO BEING A THREAT  (fe_03_01769-B-0077)
