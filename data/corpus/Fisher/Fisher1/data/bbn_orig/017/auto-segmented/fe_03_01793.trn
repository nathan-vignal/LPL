YES YEAH WELL I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL I MEAN THERE WERE KIDS THAT WERE  (fe_03_01793-A-0071)
COMING TO SCHOOL AND THEY REALLY KNEW THE COMPUTER VERY VERY WELL AND IT WAS  (fe_03_01793-A-0072)
AND AT THAT TIME THE SCHOOL WAS UM  (fe_03_01793-A-0073)
TALKING ABOUT THIS IS ABOUT ELEVEN TWELVE YEARS AGO AND THE SCHOOL I WAS IN A PAROCHIAL SCHOOL AND THE SCHOOL WAS TALKING ABOUT UM  (fe_03_01793-A-0074)
AH AT THAT TIME WE HAD A COMPUTER  (fe_03_01793-A-0075)
OR A COUPLE OF COMPUTERS IN SOME OF THE CLASSES NOT MY CLASS BUT IN SOME OF THE THE MATH CLASSES AND THE SCIENCE CLASSES AND UM  (fe_03_01793-A-0076)
THEY WERE GOING TO BE PUTTING UM  (fe_03_01793-A-0077)
SORT OF LIKE WHAT YOU MENTIONED A COMPUTER LAB IDEA WHERE THERE'S CLASSES WITH ALL  (fe_03_01793-A-0078)
HELLO  (fe_03_01793-B-0001)
HI I'M ANNE  (fe_03_01793-B-0002)
HI MARY WHERE WHERE ARE YOU FROM  (fe_03_01793-B-0003)
OH REALLY I'M CALLING FROM ASHVILLE NORTH CAROLINA  (fe_03_01793-B-0004)
OH YOU DO GOOD VERY GOOD  (fe_03_01793-B-0005)
HAVE THEY IMPROVED  (fe_03_01793-B-0006)
WELL I I THINK KIND OF ALONG THE SAME LINES AS YOU I THINK THAT THEY HAVE UM I THINK IT'S IMPROVED EDUCATION I THINK THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS UM OPENED UP YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS COMING UP AND PROBABLY WHEN YOU WERE COMING UP  (fe_03_01793-B-0007)
WE WENT TO THE IN WE WENT TO THE LIBRARY AND CHECKED AND LOOKED AT AND SAT THERE AND LOOKED THROUGH ENCYCLOPEDIAS AND NOW NOW ALL THE INFORMATION IS RIGHT AT YOUR FINGERTIPS BUT WHAT I'M FINDING IS  (fe_03_01793-B-0008)
THAT KIDS ARE COMING OUT OF SCHOOL VERY COMPUTER LITERATE BUT THEY CAN'T SPELL BECAUSE THEY DON'T YOU KNOW THEY'RE USED TO SPELL CHECK  (fe_03_01793-B-0009)
THEY I MEAN THEY  (fe_03_01793-B-0010)
THEY DON'T HAVE GOOD SPELLING THEY'RE NOT EQUIPPED WITH GOOD SPELLING TOOLS THEY UM  (fe_03_01793-B-0011)
THEY DON'T WRITE AS WELL I DON'T THINK  (fe_03_01793-B-0012)
UM  (fe_03_01793-B-0013)
AND THEY YOU KNOW THEY'RE JUST TAKING ALL THESE SHORTCUTS THEY  (fe_03_01793-B-0014)
THEY DON'T HAVE GOOD  (fe_03_01793-B-0015)
YOU KNOW IT KIND OF EQUATES OVER TO YOU KNOW CALCULATORS AND THEN THEY'VE GOT CALCULATORS NOW IN THE COMPUTER  (fe_03_01793-B-0016)
THEY DON'T LEARN THE BASICS I DON'T THINK  (fe_03_01793-B-0017)
AND SO I THINK IN ONE WAY COMPUTERS HAVE IMPROVED EDUCATION BY OPENING UP EVERY SINGLE AVENUE OF UM  (fe_03_01793-B-0018)
OF INFORMATION THE INFORMATION HIGHWAY IS THERE BUT THE BASIC SKILLS ARE POSSIBLY BEING OVERLOOKED  (fe_03_01793-B-0019)
NO UH HUH  (fe_03_01793-B-0020)
IT IS  (fe_03_01793-B-0022)
WELL I THINK IF IF THE KIDS ARE TAUGHT THE BASICS AND THEN USE THE COMPUTER TO ENHANCE SOME OF THE BASIC SKILLS I THINK THAT WOULD BE  (fe_03_01793-B-0023)
FINE BUT NOW THERE'S COMPUTERS THAT CORRECT YOUR GRAMMAR  (fe_03_01793-B-0024)
UM  (fe_03_01793-B-0025)
AND I MEAN YOU KNOW THEY THEY IT'S GOT A GRAMMAR CHECK AND SO  (fe_03_01793-B-0026)
YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A GRAMMATICAL ERROR IT'S UNDERLINED OR HIGHLIGHTED IN SOME WAY AND IT AND IT PUTS IN THE CORRECT GRAMMAR SO YOU'RE REALLY NOT LEARNING AND SO UM  (fe_03_01793-B-0027)
YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU DON'T IF IF IT'S NOT LEARNED THEN IF YOU GO SOMEWHERE WITHOUT A COMPUTER THEN YOU'RE KIND OF UP A CREEK BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THESE BASIC SKILLS  (fe_03_01793-B-0028)
UM I YOU KNOW I THINK THAT FOR WELL YOU'VE BEEN A TEACHER SO I THINK THAT YOU CAN PROBABLY REALLY RELATE TO THIS BUT I THINK UM MAKING SURE THE KIDS  (fe_03_01793-B-0031)
IN THE YOU KNOW EVEN IN THE LOWER GRADE SCHOOLS COME YOU KNOW START WITH THE BASIC SKILLS AND BUILD ON THOSE SKILLS THEN  (fe_03_01793-B-0032)
YOU KNOW COMPUTER LITERACY IS FINE WELL AND GOOD AND IT'S AND IT'S GREAT BECAUSE YOU CANNOT REALLY OPERATE IN THIS WORLD TODAY WITHOUT A COMPUTER  (fe_03_01793-B-0033)
BUT TO HAVE THE BASIC SKILLS AT YOUR FINGERTIPS KNOWING THAT WHEN YOU MAKE A SPELLING ERROR YOU CAN CORRECT THE SPELLING AND KNOW THE CORRECT SPELLING OF THE WORD RATHER THAN HAVE THE COMPUTER DO IT FOR YOU I I THINK IT'S JUST KIND OF AN INTEGRATION INTO GOOD SKILLS AND GOOD COMPUTER SKILLS  (fe_03_01793-B-0034)
MHM  (fe_03_01793-B-0035)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01793-B-0036)

WENT ON A TOUR WITH HER AND UM IT'S JUST REALLY AMAZING THEY'VE GOT AH THEY'VE GOT COMPUTERS JUST PRETTY MUCH  (fe_03_01793-B-0044)
NOT IN EVERY CLASSROOM THEY HAVE WHAT THEY CALL COMPUTER LABS BUT ALL THE CLASSROOMS HAVE THE AVAILABILITY TO GO TO THE COMPUTER LAB AND ACTUALLY THEY THEY START THEM OUT VERY VERY YOUNG  (fe_03_01793-B-0045)
UM  (fe_03_01793-B-0046)
AND AH SO YOU KNOW THAT'S MADE AH TYPING CLASSES YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL WE I HAD TO TAKE A WHOLE SEMESTER OF TYPING IT'S MADE ALL THAT OBSOLETE KEYBOARD NOW IT'S KEYBOARDING  (fe_03_01793-B-0047)
MHM  (fe_03_01793-B-0048)
KEYBOARDING  (fe_03_01793-B-0049)
NOPE THEY DON'T CALL IT TYPING ANYMORE SO THEY THEY START LEARNING THOSE SKILLS SO EARLY AND SO BY THE TIME THEY'RE THEY'RE IN THE SEVENTH EIGHTH AND NINTH GRADE THEY'RE  (fe_03_01793-B-0050)
