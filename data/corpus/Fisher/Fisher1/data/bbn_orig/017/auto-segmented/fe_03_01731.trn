IT IS A WAR ON TERRORISM AND TO TRY TO WE HAVE TO STOP IT ALL OVER THE WORLD WE HAVE TO STOP IT TO IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR TOO LONG  (fe_03_01731-B-0020)
WELL AND I I THINK WHAT WE JUST DID IN IRAQ I'M GLAD WE DID BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT SENT A MESSAGE  (fe_03_01731-B-0021)
TO THE REST OF THE WORLD  (fe_03_01731-B-0022)

TO GET YOU TO THINK THIS  (fe_03_01731-B-0029)

RIGHT I BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT TOOK A STAND AGAINST THE WAR FOR PURELY POLITICAL MOTIVE  (fe_03_01731-B-0034)
THEY WANT THEY REALLY REALLY WANTED THE WAR TO TURN THEY WANTED OUR COUNTRY TO LOSE THE WAR SO THEY COULD USE THAT AS A POLITICAL TOOL TO HAVE THEIR GUY ELECTED IN THE NEXT ELECTION  (fe_03_01731-B-0035)
AND IT IS REALLY SAD AND IT IS ESPECIALLY SAD FOR THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN AND THEIR FAMILIES THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE OVER THERE THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE IN NORTH KOREA OH SOUTH KOREA RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_01731-B-0036)
MY MY NEPHEW IS OVER THERE HE'S BEEN OVER THERE FOR ABOUT A YEAR  (fe_03_01731-B-0037)

RIGHT WELL YOU SAID PACIFIST THE ONE THING THAT DRIVES ME CRAZY  (fe_03_01731-B-0041)
IS I I ALSO LISTEN TO THE TALK RADIO SHOWS AND PEOPLE WILL CALL IN AND SAY I'M A PACIFIST OR I'M A PEACE MONGER THE LACK OF A WAR DOES NOT EQUAL PEACE  (fe_03_01731-B-0042)
WE DIDN'T HAVE PEACE HOW CAN YOU HAVE PEACE IF YOU THINK OF WHAT THE WORD PEACE MEANS HOW CAN YOU HAVE PEACE WHEN THERE IS THE THREAT OF TERRORISM IN FRONT OF YOU  (fe_03_01731-B-0043)
AND AND SO IT DRIVES ME CRAZY  (fe_03_01731-B-0044)
TO HEAR THEM SAY THAT  (fe_03_01731-B-0045)
BUT UH  (fe_03_01731-B-0046)
I DON'T KNOW I THINK YOU KNOW WE WILL HAVE A MILITARY PRESENCE OVER IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD FOR QUITE A WHILE  (fe_03_01731-B-0047)

YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT  (fe_03_01731-B-0051)
WELL  (fe_03_01731-B-0052)
AND A LOT OF MY FRIENDS WHO WERE AGAINST THE WAR WERE AGAINST IT FOR ECONOMIC REASONS THEY DIDN'T THINK PAST THEIR POCKETBOOK AND THEY  (fe_03_01731-B-0053)
THEY TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT HOW MUCH THE WAR WAS GOING TO COST AND THEY DIDN'T WANT THEIR MONEY BEING SPENT ON THAT THEY WANTED THEIR MONEY BEING SPENT ON SOMETHING ELSE THAT WOULD  (fe_03_01731-B-0054)
IMMEDIATELY AFFECT THEM  (fe_03_01731-B-0055)
AND THEY DIDN'T SEE THAT FIGHTING TERRORISM HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEM  (fe_03_01731-B-0056)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01731-B-0057)
I THINK SO TOO  (fe_03_01731-B-0058)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01731-B-0059)
BUT MAYBE SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST WILL SEE THAT MAYBE THE PEOPLE FROM IRAQ ARE SEEING THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY WHO STRONGLY PROTESTED THE WAR AND NOBODY SHOT THEM  (fe_03_01731-B-0060)
[LIPSMACK] SO MAYBE WE'VE GOT THE RIGHT IDEA MAYBE OUR DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY AND OUR FREEDOM IS A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE DO HAVE THE FREEDOM TO BE VERY VOCAL AND OBJECT TO THE WAR AND AND NOBODY SHOT THEM OR  (fe_03_01731-B-0061)
OR KIDNAPPED AND TORTURED THEIR CHILDREN  (fe_03_01731-B-0062)
[LAUGHTER] AND THEY MIGHT BE SEEING THAT THERE IS THERE MIGHT A FUTURE FOR THEM  (fe_03_01731-B-0063)
