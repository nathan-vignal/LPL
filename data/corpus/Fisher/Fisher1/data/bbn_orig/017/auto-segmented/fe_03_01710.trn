WELL  (fe_03_01710-B-0004)
YES  (fe_03_01710-B-0005)
UM FOR EXAMPLE I COULD START BY SAYING YES I THINK THAT AH CERTAIN COUNTRIES  (fe_03_01710-B-0006)
ARE ALWAYS A THREAT TO US AH IT WOULD PROBABLY VARY YOU KNOW DURING DIFFERENT REGIMES AND SO FORTH BUT I WOULD EXPECT THAT FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW NORTH KOREA IS A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO US IN THE FACT  (fe_03_01710-B-0007)
THAT THEY COULD BUILD UM THEY DO HAVE AH NUCLEAR  (fe_03_01710-B-0008)
AH WEAPONS BUT THEY COULD UM VERY WELL FORM A COALITION WITH SOME OTHER COUNTRIES AND IMPEDE THE ABILITY FOR US TO UM  (fe_03_01710-B-0009)
CONTROL THE LEVEL TO WHICH THEY DEVELOP THOSE WEAPONS  (fe_03_01710-B-0010)
SOMETHING LIKE THAT  (fe_03_01710-B-0011)
ABSOLUTELY  (fe_03_01710-B-0012)
THAT'S RIGHT I THINK UM  (fe_03_01710-B-0013)
I DON'T THINK WE'LL BE SAFE FOR SEV- MAYBE SEVERAL GENERATIONS ON ON THE SUBJECT OF TERRORISM BECAUSE  (fe_03_01710-B-0014)
TERRORISTS ARE PRETTY MUCH UM  (fe_03_01710-B-0015)
MY SELF DEFINITION THEY'RE LAWLESS AND SO ANY HOPES OF REACHING  (fe_03_01710-B-0016)
ANY KIND OF AGREEMENT ON BEHAVIOR ARE PRETTY WELL AH OUT OF THE QUESTION  (fe_03_01710-B-0017)
THEY ARE OPERATING PROBABLY IN CELLS ALL ACROSS THE WORLD AND THE QUESTION IS AH CAN WE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE FORCED TO  (fe_03_01710-B-0018)
STAY ON THE DEFENSIVE AND STAY MAINTAIN SURVEILLANCE AND TIE UP A LOT OF OUR RESOURCES TO INTERCEPT POTENTIAL PLANS I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THAT WOULD BE UM  (fe_03_01710-B-0019)
OVER WITH FOR YOU KNOW THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE OF MY LIFETIME ANYWAY  (fe_03_01710-B-0020)
IF AH IF FOR EXAMPLE THEIR MAIN CON- THEIR MAIN AH HOSTILITY IS DIRECTED TOWARD CAPITALISM  (fe_03_01710-B-0021)
CHRISTIAN COUNTRIES THAT PRACTICE CAPITALISM  (fe_03_01710-B-0022)
I DON'T AH THINK  (fe_03_01710-B-0023)
THAT THEY WILL BE OUT OF BUSINESS FOR  (fe_03_01710-B-0024)
GENERATIONS  (fe_03_01710-B-0025)
UNLESS THEY CAN AH I DON'T I DON'T SEE THE TWO  (fe_03_01710-B-0026)
POINTS OF VIEW AS EVER  (fe_03_01710-B-0027)
REACHING COMPROMISE  (fe_03_01710-B-0028)
SO I THINK TO I GUESS TO THE EXTENT THAT IF ANYONE LOOKS AT UM  (fe_03_01710-B-0029)
THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD I DON'T SEE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN  (fe_03_01710-B-0030)
TIMES OF PEACE FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME AND PERHAPS THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM NOW  (fe_03_01710-B-0031)
IS THAT WE'RE SO INTERWEBBED GLOBALLY WE HAVE AH SO MUCH  (fe_03_01710-B-0032)
GLOBAL TRAVEL THAT  (fe_03_01710-B-0033)
ONE POCKET IS OF PROBLEM IS REALLY EVERYBODY'S PROBLEM AND EACH CULTURE WILL KIND OF GET IN THE FACE OF EVERY OTHER CULTURE SOONER OR LATER  (fe_03_01710-B-0034)
AND I UM IN TERMS OF FOREIGN RELATIONS I THINK  (fe_03_01710-B-0035)
I GUESS I COULD PREDICT OR FORESEE EVENTUALLY WAY DOWN IN THE FUTURE SOME SOME DAY  (fe_03_01710-B-0036)
THAT WE WILL ALL BE SO INTERWEBBED ECONOMICALLY THAT THE THE PEOPLE WOULD EVENTUALLY BE FORCED TO FIND AH AND ALSO AS FAR AS THE ECOLOGY AND SO FORTH THE ENVIRONMENT THAT PEOPLE WILL  (fe_03_01710-B-0037)
BE MUCH MORE FORCED TO AH WORK TOGETHER  (fe_03_01710-B-0038)
UM  (fe_03_01710-B-0039)
AT THE MOMENT I'M TEACHING E._S._L. WHICH SO THAT I [NOISE] HAVE STUDENTS FROM ALL THE ALL ALL AROUND THE GLOBE IN MY CLASSROOMS AND  (fe_03_01710-B-0040)
CLEARLY SOME OF THEM ARE HERE AS REFUGEES AND SEEKING REFUGE FROM WARFARE IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES AND THEN OTHERS ARE HERE JUST TO BENEFIT FROM THE AMERICAN DREAM  (fe_03_01710-B-0041)
MAYBE TAKE BACK THE EDUCATION TO THEIR OWN COUNTRIES  (fe_03_01710-B-0042)
AND UM  (fe_03_01710-B-0043)
SO FORTH AND SO ON  (fe_03_01710-B-0044)
SO I AS AS MORE AND MORE  (fe_03_01710-B-0045)
AH PEOPLE PER- I GUESS IT PERTAINS THE MOST TO THE ISSUE ABOUT TERRORISM AS MORE AND MORE PEOPLE FROM COUNTRIES FOR EXAMPLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST THAT HAVE UM  (fe_03_01710-B-0046)
HOSTILITY TO AMERICAN  (fe_03_01710-B-0047)
IDEAS AND AND RELIGION AS THEY AS THEY GAIN  (fe_03_01710-B-0048)
OF COURSE IT SCARES YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT OF COURSE  (fe_03_01710-B-0049)
I THINK ALSO THE FACT IS THAT THEY DON'T THINK THIS IS THE LAST LIFE AND THEREFORE THEY ARE GLAD TO BE SOME OF THEM ARE WILLING QUITE WILLING TO BE MARTYRS TO  (fe_03_01710-B-0050)
ATTAIN A BETTER STATUS IN THE NEXT WORLD SO THAT  (fe_03_01710-B-0051)
ANY TIME THAT HUMAN LIFE IS RELATIVELY EXPENDABLE  (fe_03_01710-B-0052)
WE LOSE OUR LEVERAGE 'CAUSE WE DON'T FEEL THAT WAY  (fe_03_01710-B-0053)
SO THAT'S A VALUE CLASH AND UM  (fe_03_01710-B-0054)
I DON'T KNOW THERE ARE OTHER COUNTRIES ABOUT WHICH WE KNOW VERY LITTLE FOR EXAMPLE LIBYA AND SOME OTHER THAT ARE JUST SO  (fe_03_01710-B-0055)
TOTALLY ENCLOSED THAT ARE SO INVOLVED ONLY IN THEIR OWN PROCESSES AND ARE SO REPRESSED THAT  (fe_03_01710-B-0056)
THE PEOPLE ARE POOR THERE THERE'S USUALLY AH SOMEBODY WHO HAS A LOT OF POWER AND A LOT OF OIL OR SOME SUCH THING  (fe_03_01710-B-0057)
GOING ON AND WANTS TO HOLD ON TO THAT SO YES LIBYA I DON'T FOR EXAMPLE I JUST DON'T EVER HAVE LIBYAN STUDENTS THEY DON'T GET OUT  (fe_03_01710-B-0058)
OF THEIR COUNTRY THE AH A LOT OF THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES HAVE WHAT'S CALLED A UM CULTURAL DIVERSITY LOTTERY  (fe_03_01710-B-0059)
SO MANY PEOPLE WANT TO COME TO WESTERN COUNTRIES TO STUDY U._S. IS ONE OF THEM BUT MANY GO TO EUROPE FOR EXAMPLE AND UM  (fe_03_01710-B-0060)
SO THERE'S A DRAWING AND IF YOU WIN THE DIVERSITY OR CULTURAL LOTTERY THEN YOU ARE GET TO COME AND OFTEN TO BRING YOUR FAMILY  (fe_03_01710-B-0061)
AH TO STUDY HERE AS LONG AS  (fe_03_01710-B-0062)
PEOPLE IN THOSE COUNTRIES ARE ACTIVELY INVOLVED WITH THE UNITED STATES I THINK EVEN THOUGH THERE IS TERRORISM  (fe_03_01710-B-0063)
IN THEM FOR EXAMPLE ETHIOPIA KENYA UM  (fe_03_01710-B-0064)
[LIPSMACK] SUDAN SO FORTH AND SO ON I THINK WE HAVE A MUCH BETTER CHANCE OF AH REACHING SOME KIND OF UM  (fe_03_01710-B-0065)
LIVE AND LET LIVE SITUATION  (fe_03_01710-B-0066)
THE ONES SO THE ONES IN OTHER WORDS THE ONES THAT REALLY SCARE ME ARE THE ONES WHERE WE HAVE NOT MUCH INTERFACE AT ALL AND YOU KNOW SYRIA MIGHT BE ONE OF THOSE AND UM NOW  (fe_03_01710-B-0067)
IRAQ WAS CERTAINLY ONE AH AS WE SAW WITH AFGHANISTAN AFGHANISTAN IS NOW MUCH MORE OPEN  (fe_03_01710-B-0068)
TO THE WORLD AND HOPEFULLY IRAQ WILL BECOME AND IRAN HAS GOT A VERY REPRESSIVE CURRENT  (fe_03_01710-B-0069)
LEADERSHIP AND MANY OF MANY OF MY STUDENTS ARE ESCAPING IRAN ESPECIALLY STUDENTS OF THE BAHA'I FAITH  (fe_03_01710-B-0071)
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO GO TO THE REGULAR UNIVERSITIES ANYMORE  (fe_03_01710-B-0072)
SO IF THEY WANT A REASONABLE AH PROFESSIONAL LIFE THEY HAVE TO START LOOKING  (fe_03_01710-B-0073)
AT WAYS TO GET OUT OF THE COUNTRY  (fe_03_01710-B-0074)
SO I GUESS AND THEN OF COURSE WE'VE ALSO HAD SOME OF THE CROATIAN AND UM BOSNIAN REFUGEES TOO AND WE HEAR PRETTY HORRIBLE THINGS ABOUT RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION THERE AND  (fe_03_01710-B-0075)
WE THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN OF ONLY YOU KNOW ONLY IS SO EFFECTIVE AND THEN NO MORE SO IN GETTING SOME OF THAT RESOLVED AS WELL AS THE UNITED NATIONS SO  (fe_03_01710-B-0076)
BUT IT HAS BECOME OUR BUSINESS  (fe_03_01710-B-0077)
WE WE TRY  (fe_03_01710-B-0078)
TO GET IN AND STOP A LOT OF THIS ETHNIC CRUELTY WHERE WE KNOW ABOUT IT AND WHERE WE CAN  (fe_03_01710-B-0079)
THROUGH THE UNITED NATIONS I SUPPOSE  (fe_03_01710-B-0080)
SO I SEE THE UNITED NATION THE UNITED NATIONS IS IDEALLY IN MY OPINION THE WAY TO MAKE THINGS WORK I'M  (fe_03_01710-B-0081)
NOT ENTIRELY IN AGREEMENT  (fe_03_01710-B-0082)
WELL I GUESS BECAUSE SOME OF THE THEIR CONSTITUENT COUNTRIES DID NOT BELIEVE IN IT  (fe_03_01710-B-0083)
THE UNITED STATES HAS ONE OPINION BUT WE'RE ONE OF MANY MANY MANY OPINIONS AND MANY WERE WERE MUCH MORE WILLING TO SEE  (fe_03_01710-B-0084)
THE PROCESS WORK THROUGH THE UNITED NATIONS AND CONTINUE TO PUT PRESSURE FOR MORE INSPECTIONS  (fe_03_01710-B-0085)
AND YOU KNOW I'M NOT ABOUT I'M NOT ABLE TO SAY RIGHT OR WRONG BUT IT'S TURNING OUT TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY THAT THERE WERE MASS WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION BECAUSE OUR TROOPS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND THEM  (fe_03_01710-B-0086)
SO YOU KNOW IN OTHER WORDS THE UNITED STATES TOOK IT UPON ITSELF TO SETTLE THIS THING  (fe_03_01710-B-0087)
ONCE AND FOR ALL AND THERE ARE THOSE  (fe_03_01710-B-0088)
RIGHT BUT THEY DID NOT FIND ANY  (fe_03_01710-B-0089)
IN OTHER WORDS WE HAVE NOT FOUND HUGE STOCKPILES IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE REGIME DESTROYED WHAT THEY HAD BUT THEY HAVE NOT FOUND IN ANY I'M JUST READING ON M._S._N._B._C. NEWS TODAY  (fe_03_01710-B-0090)
THAT YOU KNOW THE OUR INTELLIGENCE HAD NAMED FIVE PARTICULAR SITES  (fe_03_01710-B-0091)
OR FIVE THERE WERE SOME VERY SPECIFIC SITES AND NONE OF THEM YIELDED ANYTHING SO FAR  (fe_03_01710-B-0092)
SO IT'S BECOMING A NEW INTERNATIONAL ISSUE  (fe_03_01710-B-0093)
THAT AH WHAT WERE WE GOING  (fe_03_01710-B-0094)
