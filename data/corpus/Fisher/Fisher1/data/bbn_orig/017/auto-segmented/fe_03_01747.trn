NICE TO MEET YOU TOO  (fe_03_01747-A-0003)
YEAH I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THEIR INITIAL QUESTION BUT I HAVE VERY GOOD OPINIONS ON FOREIGN RELATIONS AND THE WHOLE BUSH ADMINISTRATION [MN] [NOISE] [NOISE]  (fe_03_01747-A-0004)
[NOISE] IT IS  (fe_03_01747-A-0006)
BUT THAT IS PART OF WHAT CONCERNS ME SO MUCH RIGHT NOW ABOUT THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IS I FEEL LIKE HE'S ALIENATED SO MUCH OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY [NOISE] [MN]  (fe_03_01747-A-0007)
YES  (fe_03_01747-A-0009)
MHM  (fe_03_01747-A-0010)
THAT'S TRUE [MN]  (fe_03_01747-A-0011)

MHM  (fe_03_01747-A-0015)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_01747-A-0016)
BUT IT PARTICULARLY CONCERNS ME NOW BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE OVER THE PAST DECADE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS HAVE BEEN IMPROVING  (fe_03_01747-A-0017)
AND WITH VARIOUS COALITIONS FOR PEACE BUILDING IN THE MIDDLE EAST SOME OF THOSE ARE WORKING MUCH BETTER  (fe_03_01747-A-0018)
UM AND THEN I FEEL LIKE NOW WITH THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION THEY'RE SORT OF  (fe_03_01747-A-0019)
ALIENATING PEOPLE WHO HAD BECOME ALLIES AS A  (fe_03_01747-A-0020)
SORT OF ESSENTIALLY TEARING DOWN SOME PROGRESS THAT HAD BEEN MADE [NOISE] [NOISE]  (fe_03_01747-A-0021)
MHM  (fe_03_01747-A-0022)
MHM  (fe_03_01747-A-0026)
[NOISE] OH THAT'S YEAH A TERRIFYING SITUATION THAT'S BUILDING AND BEEN IGNORED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT  (fe_03_01747-A-0027)

ABSOLUTELY  (fe_03_01747-A-0035)
WELL IT'S ACTUALLY A QUESTION OF TERRORISM BECAUSE IT'S TERRORISM HAS BEEN AROUND YOU KNOW [NOISE] FOR [NOISE] FOR FAR MORE THAN DECADES BUT SERIOUS TERRORISM FOR WELL OVER A DECADE IT'S JUST THAT IT FINALLY HIT AMERICA  (fe_03_01747-A-0036)

I THINK HE'S DOING AN ADMIRABLE JOB YES AND AND AND HE IS VERY SENSITIVE TO THE LONG TERM IMPLICATIONS  (fe_03_01747-A-0040)
IN A WAY I REALLY RESPECT HIM FOR  (fe_03_01747-A-0041)
[NOISE] [NOISE] [NOISE] [MN] [NOISE] RIGHT BUT THERE'S ALSO IT'S THE QUESTION OF IS IT THE COUNTRY THAT'S A THREAT OR IS THERE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THAT'S PART OF THE ISSUE OF TERRORISM  (fe_03_01747-A-0042)
IS IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A NATIONAL POLICY  (fe_03_01747-A-0043)
YES  (fe_03_01747-A-0045)

UM  (fe_03_01747-A-0057)
[NOISE] OUR INITIAL FOUNDING [NOISE] WHEN WE WERE YOU KNOW DEBATING WHETHER WE WERE GOING [NOISE] TO BE AN ISOLATIONIST OR [NOISE] AN INTERNATIONAL COUNTRY [NOISE] [NOISE]  (fe_03_01747-A-0058)
[NOISE] NO POSSIBLE I DON'T THINK YOU CAN BUT THAT'S WHERE'S I FEEL LIKE WE'RE CURRENTLY HEADING TOWARDS SINCE WE'RE ALIENATING SO MUCH [NOISE] OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY [NOISE] [NOISE]  (fe_03_01747-A-0059)
[NOISE] [NOISE] WHICH SO FAR HAS SINCE SURPRISINGLY LITTLE [NOISE] [NOISE] [NOISE] [NOISE]  (fe_03_01747-A-0060)
[NOISE]  (fe_03_01747-A-0064)

WELL IT'S AH  (fe_03_01747-B-0003)
A HUGE TOPIC BECAUSE YOU KNOW FOREIGN RELATIONS ARE SO IMPORTANT I MEAN WITH THE WORLD SO SMALL NOW YOU KNOW OR SO TO SPEAK YOU KNOW AND AND THE CHANCES OF THE WAR  (fe_03_01747-B-0004)
INCREASING EVERY DAY WITH ALL THE TERRORISM YOU KNOW IT'S AH  (fe_03_01747-B-0005)
DIFFICULT THING YOU KNOW TO DEAL WITH ALL THESE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY THE WAY EVEN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES NOT JUST THE ARAB WORLD LOOKS AT US IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT  (fe_03_01747-B-0007)
WELL AND AT THE SAME TIME UM I FEEL LIKE AFTER  (fe_03_01747-B-0008)
WE ACTUALLY WENT INTO IRAQ WHICH IS YOU KNOW I HAD  (fe_03_01747-B-0009)
I WASN'T TOTALLY AGAINST BUT I WASN'T TOTALLY FOR I I THINK SOME OF THAT HAS BEEN  (fe_03_01747-B-0010)
UM EXPLAINED AS FAR AS WHY FRANCE AND RUSSIA WERE SO AGAINST US GOING IN YOU KNOW BECAUSE THERE WAS SUPPORT ON THEIR PART THAT NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE  (fe_03_01747-B-0011)
AND IT IT MAKES ME SAD THAT THE UNITED NATIONS CAN'T BE A MORE EFFECTIVE BODY THAN IT IS BUT  (fe_03_01747-B-0012)
THERE THERE'S JUST SO MUCH POLITICS IN IT THAT [MN] IT CAN'T DO THE JOB THAT IT WAS SET UP TO DO THAT'S HOW I FEEL  (fe_03_01747-B-0013)
BECAUSE COUNTRIES ARE GOING TO VOTE THE WAY THAT BENEFITS THEM NOT T- WHAT BENEFITS WHAT IS BEST FOR THE WORLD  (fe_03_01747-B-0014)
OR THE WORLD ECONOMY [MN]  (fe_03_01747-B-0015)
OH YES  (fe_03_01747-B-0016)
YES AND AND AND THAT'S WHAT POLITICS IS [LAUGHTER] IT TURNS ME OFF BIG TIME A LOT OF TIMES BECAUSE OF THAT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01747-B-0017)
AH YOU KNOW A POLITICIAN VOTES FOR WHAT'S BEST FOR JUST HIS STATE OR WHAT'S BEST FOR HIM TO GET VOTED IN AGAIN NOT WHAT'S BEST FOR THE COUNTRY OR THE STATE AS A WHOLE  (fe_03_01747-B-0018)
AND IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING AND AND THAT ALL CARRIES OVER THEN INTO THE FOREIGN POLITICS UM  (fe_03_01747-B-0019)
I I THINK THERE HAD BEEN PROGRESS MADE AND YET AT THE SAME TIME I ALSO FEEL THAT BECAUSE OF THE BUILDING THREAT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM  (fe_03_01747-B-0021)
THAT  (fe_03_01747-B-0022)
PEOPLE WERE SIDE STEPPING THAT ISSUE TO AVOID  (fe_03_01747-B-0023)
YOU KNOW TO AVOID CONFRONTATION AND HOW LONG CAN YOU LET THAT GO AFTER SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE MY AMBIGUITY CAME IN WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH DECIDED TO GO TO WAR  (fe_03_01747-B-0024)
I I I WASN'T TOTALLY FOR IT BUT AT THE SAME TIME I FELT THAT NOTHING WOULD EVER BE ACCOMPLISHED DIPLOMATICALLY THROUGH FOREIGN RELATIONS BECAUSE THOSE COUNTRIES SIMPLY  (fe_03_01747-B-0025)
AREN'T TRUTHFUL WON'T CHANGE WON'T YOU KNOW WON'T FOLLOW THE [MN]  (fe_03_01747-B-0026)

THAT MUCH MORE PRESSURE WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT ON NORTH KOREA THAN IS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH TOO MANY  (fe_03_01747-B-0030)
APPLES AT THE SAME TIME WITHOUT EMPTYING THE APPLE CART YOU KNOW IT IT IS SCARY IT REALLY IS SCARY UM  (fe_03_01747-B-0031)
[LIPSMACK] [MN] THERE'S NO GOOD ANSWERS I DON'T THINK AND I'M I'M NOT GOING TO S- JUST TEAR THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION DOWN BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN EASY THING FOR ANY ADMINISTRATION  (fe_03_01747-B-0032)

THE AH COUNTRIES ARE WHO ARE A THREAT RIGHT NOW UM WELL WHAT ABOUT SYRIA THEY MAY NOT BE A DIRECT THREAT TO US BUT BECAUSE OF OUR THREATS TO THEM WE'RE FURTHER ALIENATING  (fe_03_01747-B-0035)
THE ARAB WORLD AND HERE WE GO AGAIN AND IS THAT GOING TO INCREASE TERRORISM RATHER THAN CALM IT DOWN  (fe_03_01747-B-0036)

AH FOR INSTANCE SUPPORTING IRAQ IN THE IRAN IRAQ WAR WE HARDLY HAVE OUR HANDS CLEAN IN THIS WHOLE MESS SO YEAH AH [SIGH]  (fe_03_01747-B-0041)
I I DO THINK THAT COLIN POWELL IS DOING QUITE A GOOD JOB HE'S A VERY GOOD DIPLOMAT  (fe_03_01747-B-0042)
BUT  (fe_03_01747-B-0043)
YES I AGREE WITH THAT I THINK SO TOO  (fe_03_01747-B-0044)
SO I THINK WE HAVE THAT GOING FOR US BUT I AS FAR AS WHAT COUNTRIES ARE PARTICULARLY A THREAT TO US I CAN'T SAY THAT I FEEL  (fe_03_01747-B-0045)
OTHER THAN A TERRORIST ACT THAT ANY ARE WHAT YOU WOULD REALLY CALL A THREAT BECAUSE NO ONE CAN STAND UP TO OUR MILITARY MIGHT SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT THEY MEANT BY THAT QUESTION YOU KNOW WHAT COUNTRIES DO YOU FEEL THAT ARE A THREAT TO US  (fe_03_01747-B-0046)
OTHER THAN  (fe_03_01747-B-0047)
YES THAT'S MORE TO THE POINT  (fe_03_01747-B-0048)
YES EXACTLY  (fe_03_01747-B-0049)
YES YES  (fe_03_01747-B-0050)
AND I MEAN EVEN IN IRAQ I MEAN IT'S IT'S GOING TO BE A MESS FOR A LONG TIME BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MANY FACTIONS WHO HAVE NEVER HAD ANY FREEDOM AND NOW ARE ALL GOING TO BE FIGHTING AGAINST EACH OTHER RATHER THAN TRYING TO UNITE  (fe_03_01747-B-0051)
BECAUSE OF THEIR DIFFERENT VIEW POINTS AND RELIGIOUS VIEW POINTS [SIGH] YEAH OH I DON'T KNOW WHEN WE'LL EVER GET OUT OF THERE BUT AT THE SAME TIME WHEN YOU SEE SO MUCH THAT WAS UNCOVERED OF WHAT  (fe_03_01747-B-0052)
THE REGIME WAS LIKE AND HOW IT TERRORIZED EVERYONE YOU KNOW IT IT NEEDED TO BE BROUGHT DOWN AND YET  (fe_03_01747-B-0053)
WAS THAT OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THAT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01747-B-0054)
THEN WHAT WHO'S NEXT AHAH I WHERE DOES IT STOP IF YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING DIPLOMATICALLY AND AND THAT BRINGS ME BACK TO THE UNITED NATIONS  (fe_03_01747-B-0055)
THEY JUST CAN'T SEEM TO BE EFFECTIVE IN THE ROLE THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO PLAY BECAUSE OF THE POLITICS OF THE WHOLE THING  (fe_03_01747-B-0056)
SO WHAT'S THE ANSWER I CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW I  (fe_03_01747-B-0057)
I I REALLY POLITICS IN GENERAL REALLY DISCOURAGED ME AND MADE ME ANGRY AT TIMES AND THEN WHEN YOU SAY FOREIGN POLICY ITS EVEN  (fe_03_01747-B-0058)
MORE DIFFICULT OF COURSE BECAUSE I MEAN EVEN THE EUROPEAN NATIONS ARE LOOKING AT US NOW LIKE BIG BULLIES YOU KNOW AND AND AND I DON'T THAT THEY NECESSARILY DIDN'T BEFORE THEY WERE JUST QUIETER ABOUT IT  (fe_03_01747-B-0059)
BUT  (fe_03_01747-B-0060)

YEAH  (fe_03_01747-B-0064)
I I GUESS PART OF THAT WILL DEPEND ON WHAT THEY ACTUALLY FOUND OUT THAT IRAQ HAD IN THE WAY OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION OR  (fe_03_01747-B-0065)
WELL AND THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE ALSO BECAUSE THE ONE UM  (fe_03_01747-B-0066)
[LIPSMACK] GUY THAT THEY JUST CAPTURED THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS PROGRAM I JUST HEARD YESTERDAY HAD POINTED OUT FOUR SITES WHERE THEY WORKED ON THOSE AND SAID THAT  (fe_03_01747-B-0067)
ONLY ONE WEEK BEFORE THE WAR MANY OF THE SITES AND THE CHEMICALS WERE DESTROYED SOME WERE SENT TO SYRIA SOME WERE BURIED SO IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO WALK IN AND SAY OH HERE'S THE CHEMICAL LABORATORY IT'S NOT GONNA BE THAT EASY  (fe_03_01747-B-0068)
