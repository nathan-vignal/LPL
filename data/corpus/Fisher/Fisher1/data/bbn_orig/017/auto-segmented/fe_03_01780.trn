IT'S TRUE BUT BUT NOW AS A PART OF EDUCATION I MEAN I CAN THERE ARE A LOT OF PROS AND CONS TO HOW THEY COULD BE USED BUT I THINK IT'S ALMOST LIKE A NECESSARY METHOD OF SOCIALIZATION IS TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE COMPUTER BECAUSE  (fe_03_01780-A-0029)
THEY'RE SO  (fe_03_01780-A-0030)

I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF MISINFORMATION OUT THERE AND I MEAN IT HAPPENS IN BOOKS TOO BUT I THINK IT'S A LITTLE LESS LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN BOOKS THAN IT IS  (fe_03_01780-A-0042)
FOR SOMEONE TO JUST POST BOGUS INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET  (fe_03_01780-A-0043)

HI THIS IS ERROL HOW ARE YOU  (fe_03_01780-B-0001)
GOOD  (fe_03_01780-B-0002)
SO THE TOPIC IS EDUCATION AND COMPUTERS I BELIEVE  (fe_03_01780-B-0003)
OKAY  (fe_03_01780-B-0004)
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT  (fe_03_01780-B-0005)
COMPUTERS AND EDUCATION AND ALL THAT  (fe_03_01780-B-0006)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01780-B-0007)
I I WOULD I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU IN THAT I THINK COMPUTERS ARE GREAT BECAUSE YOU CAN ACCESS  (fe_03_01780-B-0008)
VERY LARGE AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION AT A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME AND I THINK THAT'S GOOD I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE HOWEVER THOUGH THAT BECAUSE I'VE WORKED IN EDUCATION MYSELF  (fe_03_01780-B-0009)
AND I'VE FOUND THAT KIDS A LOT OF TIMES  (fe_03_01780-B-0010)
MISUSE COMPUTERS IN THE SENSE THAT THEY WANT TO PLAY GAMES A LOT I'M AND I'M SPEAKING AT SCHOOL PARTICULARLY WHEN THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING EDUCATION TYPES OF THINGS X.  (fe_03_01780-B-0011)
STUFF A LOT OF TIMES THEY WANT TO PLAY GAMES AND LISTEN TO MUSIC AND DO OTHER THINGS THAT ARE NOT REAL PRODUCTIVE  (fe_03_01780-B-0012)
AND UM BUT ALL IN ALL I'D ALONG WITH YOU I THINK THAT COMPUTERS ARE GREAT THINGS YEAH A GREAT TOOL THAT CAN BE USED TO  (fe_03_01780-B-0013)
UM GAIN A TERRIFICALLY LARGE AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE  (fe_03_01780-B-0014)
AND INFORMATION RATHER  (fe_03_01780-B-0015)
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH I I WASN'T SAYING THAT THAT IT'S BAD SE- THAT GAMES ARE BAD  (fe_03_01780-B-0016)
BUT I MEAN I THINK A LOT OF KIDS USE THEM JUST TO PLAY GAMES PRIMARILY TO PLAY GAMES THAT YOU KNOW AS OPPOSED TO USING THEM TO DO RESEARCH AND DO OTHER THINGS THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING  (fe_03_01780-B-0017)
YOU KNOW LIKE AT SCHOOL AND THAT KIND OF THING  (fe_03_01780-B-0018)
RIGHT THEY ARE  (fe_03_01780-B-0019)
AND ACTUALLY I'M I'M NOT REALLY INTO THE GAME PLAYING ANYWAY I'VE NEVER REALLY LIKED GAMES THAT MUCH  (fe_03_01780-B-0020)
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE AND I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT  (fe_03_01780-B-0021)
BUT I THINK THERE'S A TIME AND A PLACE FOR EVERYTHING AND YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S TIME TO WORK IT'S TIME TO WORK AND WHEN IT'S TIME TO PLAY IT'S TIME TO PLAY  (fe_03_01780-B-0022)
RIGHT AND I AGREE I AGREE THEY'RE DEFINITELY NOT GOING AWAY  (fe_03_01780-B-0023)

WITHOUT YEAH YOU CAN I MEAN EVERYWHERE YOU GO IN EVERY INDUSTRY  (fe_03_01780-B-0026)
EVERY JOB JUST ABOUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T ESCAPE IT  (fe_03_01780-B-0027)
IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU DEFINITELY NEED TO NEED TO KNOW  (fe_03_01780-B-0028)
WHAT WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S NOT ALWAYS RIGHT WHAT WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT  (fe_03_01780-B-0029)
YOU KNOW AND AND YOU KNOW THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT BECAUSE  (fe_03_01780-B-0030)
IT'S A LOT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO POST INFORMATION TO THE INTERNET AND  (fe_03_01780-B-0031)
TO PUBLISH A WHOLE BOOK  (fe_03_01780-B-0032)
AND I WOULD THINK THAT THE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY LEGITIMATE I GUESS IT'S THE LACK OF A BETTER WORD  (fe_03_01780-B-0034)
PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUAL AUTHORITIES ON CERTAIN INFORMATION OR CERTAIN TOPICS ARE MORE LIKELY TO  (fe_03_01780-B-0035)
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACT-  (fe_03_01780-B-0036)
PUBLISH  (fe_03_01780-B-0037)
THAN TO THAN TO POST SOMETHING ON THE INTERNET ANYBODY CAN POST SOMETHING ON THE INTERNET AND AND CLAIM TO BE AN AUTHORITY ON THAT I THINK YOU JUST HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT SOURCES YOU YOU AH PUT YOUR TRUST IN  (fe_03_01780-B-0038)
YOU KNOW AND LEND CREDENCE TO BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF UM UNRELIABLE SOURCES OF INFORMATION OUT THERE ON THE NET BUT I DON'T THINK I THINK PEOPLE KIND OF TEND TO THINK THAT WHATEVER THEY READ ON THE NET IS GOSPEL TOO  (fe_03_01780-B-0039)
AND I THINK THAT'S A REAL DANGER [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01780-B-0040)
ON STUFF SHE READ ON THE NET  (fe_03_01780-B-0041)
THAT'S INTERESTING TOO BECAUSE I I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE GET A BIG KICK OUT OF BEING ABLE TO PASS INFORMATION AROUND AND SCARE PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU CAN DO IT VERY QUICKLY VERY EFFICIENTLY  (fe_03_01780-B-0042)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01780-B-0043)

SOMETHING LIKE THAT I TRY TO STAY AWAY FROM DOING SEARCHES LIKE SOMETIMES I JUST TY- GO TO YAHOO AND TYPE IN  (fe_03_01780-B-0046)
WHATEVER I'M LOOKING FOR BUT USUALLY I LIKE TO GO TO A CERTAIN WEBSITE LIKE WEB M._D.  (fe_03_01780-B-0047)
