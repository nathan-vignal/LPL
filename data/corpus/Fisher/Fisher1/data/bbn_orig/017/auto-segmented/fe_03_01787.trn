AH PEOPLE FROM LEARNING HOW TO SPELL BECAUSE THEY RELY ON THAT UM I ALSO THINK THAT  (fe_03_01787-A-0028)
THE MATH SIDE THERE THERE'S A POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE AND THINK THAT IN A LOT OF CASES WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL WHICH WOULD BE YOU  (fe_03_01787-A-0029)
KNOW RIGHT UP UNTIL NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR YOU WOULD DO A LOT OF MATH IN YOUR HEAD AND I THINK NOW IF YOU HAD TO DO PERCENTAGES I THINK THE STUDENTS OF TODAY ARE VERY RELIANT UPON COMPUTERIZATION  (fe_03_01787-A-0030)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01787-A-0032)

BECAUSE I CAN FIGURE THAT STUFF OUT IN MY HEAD AND I SEE THEY JUST LOOK AT YOU WITH A BLANK STARE AND I'M LIKE YOU TELL ME YOU DON'T GET THIS AND THEY DON'T  (fe_03_01787-A-0058)

ARE NOT GOOD SPELLERS  (fe_03_01787-B-0017)
IT'S IT'S A NEEDED CRUTCH I THINK THAT  (fe_03_01787-B-0018)
UM CERTAINLY I YOU KNOW EVEN WHEN MY CHILDREN DIDN'T HAVE APTITUDE FOR SPELLING I DRILLED THEM ON SPELLING WORDS ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL EVEN BECAUSE OF MY OWN STRUGGLE WITH SPELLING I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THEY  (fe_03_01787-B-0019)
AT LEAST  (fe_03_01787-B-0020)
GET AS MUCH AS THEY COULD BUT UM  (fe_03_01787-B-0021)

STUDENTS YOU KNOW I MEAN I KNOW FROM MYSELF AND THAT  (fe_03_01787-B-0026)
PRIOR TO USING T- COMPUTERS I USED TO SAY TO MY KIDS IF THEY WOULD ASK ME HOW TO SPELL SOMETHING BECAUSE I WAS NOT A GOOD SPELLER I WOULD SAY TO THEM GET THE DICTIONARY AND THEY DID BUT NOW THAT THEY YOU KNOW ONCE THEY GOT INTO HIGH SCHOOL  (fe_03_01787-B-0027)
EXACTLY EXACTLY I THINK IT'S LIKE ALMOST THE SAME AS LOOKING A WORD UP IT'S AND THEN  (fe_03_01787-B-0028)
UM THERE ARE YOU KNOW WHAT THERE ARE THOSE TIMES WHEN YOU MIGHT THINK YOU'RE SPELLING SOMETHING RIGHT AND YOU WOULD NEVER THINK TO LOOK IN THE DICTIONARY AS A STUDENT YOU KNOW A YOUNG STUDENT  (fe_03_01787-B-0029)
UM BUT IT SHOWS YOU THAT YOU AREN'T RIGHT IT'S LIKE THAT INSTANT CORRECTION  (fe_03_01787-B-0030)
I THINK SO TOO  (fe_03_01787-B-0031)

AND THE STUDENT CAN AUTOMATICALLY IT'S JUST AUTOMAT- IT IT'S IT'S VERY INSTANTANEOUS AND AND THAT I THINK REINFORCES LEARNING  (fe_03_01787-B-0033)
UM RATHER THAN DOWN THE ROAD SOMEBODY LOOKING AT YOUR PAPER AND SAYING WELL YOU SPELLED THAT WRONG BUT YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS SINCE YOU SPELT IT SO YOU'RE  (fe_03_01787-B-0034)

YEAH YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT I GUESS I'VE NEVER USED IT MUCH AT HOME FOR MATH UM IN HOME SCHOOLING MY KIDS I'VE NEVER USED THE COMPUTER REALLY FOR MATH EXCEPT FOR MATH GAMES AND STUFF LIKE THAT JUST TO SUPPLEMENT I'VE NEVER USED IT FOR MATH CURRICULUM  (fe_03_01787-B-0040)
YEAH YEAH  (fe_03_01787-B-0041)
I KNOW I THINK THAT THAT'S TRUE I THINK THAT'S TRUE AND THAT WAS ANOTHER  (fe_03_01787-B-0043)
ANOTHER THING THAT I NEVER USED WITH MY KIDS UNTIL THEY GOT INTO HIGHER ALGEBRA THEN I ALLOWED THEM TO USE THE CALCULATOR TO CUT THE TIME BUT  (fe_03_01787-B-0044)
TO ME IT WAS ESSENTIAL THAT THEY KNEW HOW TO DO IT THEY KNEW HOW TO FIGURE THIS OUT BEFORE THEY  (fe_03_01787-B-0045)
YOU KNOW LEANED  (fe_03_01787-B-0046)
ON SOME OTHER KIND OF TECHNOLOGY YOU KNOW TO FIGURE IT OUT FOR THEM  (fe_03_01787-B-0047)
