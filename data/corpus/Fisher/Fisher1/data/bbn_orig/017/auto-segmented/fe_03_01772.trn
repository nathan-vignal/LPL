LIKE THAT THAT'S JUST  (fe_03_01772-A-0026)

IT'S REALLY I MEAN IRAQ REALLY IS PROBLEMATIC TO TALK ABOUT AND AND DIFFICULT WE HAD AH AT SCHOOL UM  (fe_03_01772-A-0048)
THERE'S A FEW IRAQI ARTISTS WHO ARE IN EXILE VISITING THIS WEEK AND ONE OF THEM BROUGHT UP THE QUESTION OF WHY IN THE ANTI WAR MOVEMENT DIDN'T WASN'T THERE MORE DIS- HERE WASN'T THERE MORE DISCUSSION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AH HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE THE VIOLATIONS DONE BY SADDAM  (fe_03_01772-A-0049)

UM  (fe_03_01772-A-0057)
BUT BUT THE OTHER THING ABOUT PREEMPTIVE IS THAT UM  (fe_03_01772-A-0058)
I JUST THINK THAT A LOT OF  (fe_03_01772-A-0059)
FROM WHAT I HEAR AND READ LIKE A LOT OF U._S. ACTIONS IN THE PAST CONTRIBUTED TO THE PROBLEMS THERE ARE NOW LIKE SADDAM BEING IN POWER  (fe_03_01772-A-0060)

WHOA UM WHAT I GUESS DO YOU  (fe_03_01772-B-0009)
WHAT WHAT IS THERE A COUNTRY THAT YOU FEEL THAT AH IS CURRENTLY THREATENS THE UNITED STATES' AH SAFETY  (fe_03_01772-B-0010)
[NOISE] SORRY YEAH I'M SORRY I'M IN THE CAR I JUST  (fe_03_01772-B-0011)
BELL WENT OFF REAL QUICK  (fe_03_01772-B-0012)
THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_01772-B-0013)
IS A THREAT TO ITS OWN NATIONAL SECURITY  (fe_03_01772-B-0014)
OKAY  (fe_03_01772-B-0015)
OKAY AND I I AND I'VE HEARD THE POINT BEFORE IT'S LIKE IF IF EVERYONE HAS A PREEMPTIVE ATTITUDE THEN EVERYONE PREEMPTS EACH OTHER AND SO ALL IT DOES IS LEAD TO MORE CONFLICT AND I I HAVE HEARD THAT UM  (fe_03_01772-B-0016)
THE ONLY THING IS LIKE I DON'T KNOW THAT AS FAR AS I GUESS STICKING TO THE TOPIC BEFORE I I I WOULD LIKE TO JUST STRESS KIND OF WHAT YOU SAID JUST A MINUTE AH AGO BUT NORTH KOREA ACTUALLY HAS TECHNICALLY THEY THINK THEY THEY HAVE A  (fe_03_01772-B-0017)
A WEAPON A A MISSILE THAT CAN MAKE IT OVER HERE BUT AS FAR AS I KNOW THEY'VE NEVER  (fe_03_01772-B-0018)
YOU KNOW THEY'VE NEVER ACTUALLY TESTED IT THEY'VE JUST SAID THEY HAVE IT AND SO WHO KNOWS IF THEY DO OR NOT  (fe_03_01772-B-0019)
YEAH THAT'S  (fe_03_01772-B-0020)
THAT'S AND ACTUALLY I I'M A CHINESE LINGUIST THAT'S KINDA KINDA WHAT I DO FOR FOR MY CAREER AND SO WE DO LOT WITH THE KOREANS AND YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST NOT THE UNITED STATES AH WE'RE GENERALLY LIKE A BULL IN A CHINA SHOP  (fe_03_01772-B-0021)
WE'RE NOT VERY GOOD LIKE WITH THE POLITICAL MANEUVERINGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND THE ORIENTAL COMMUNITY IS ALL ABOUT FACE AND HOW TO MANEUVER AND ALL ABOUT DIPLOMACY AND WE HAVEN'T LEARNED THAT MUCH BUT  (fe_03_01772-B-0022)
LIKE CHINA AND LIKE NORTH KOREA THEY'LL SAY ALL THESE SCARY THINGS BUT  (fe_03_01772-B-0023)
I REALLY DON'T THINK THEY'RE THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT YOU KNOW THEY KNOW IF THEY WERE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE SEND A NUCLEAR WEAPON OUR WAY THAT THERE WOULD BE ABSOLUTE AND COMPLETE RETRIBUTION FOR THAT LIKE THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THEY WOULD BE  (fe_03_01772-B-0024)
YOU KNOW WIPED OUT AND THAT'S KINDA YOU KNOW THE THE WAY IT HAS TO BE THERE HAS TO BE THAT UNDERSTANDING [NOISE] OTHERWISE AH YOU KNOW SOMEONE SOMEONE WILL DO THAT TO US BUT AH AS FAR AS THE COUNTRY I'M NOT SURE ANY COUNTRY REALLY CREATES A  (fe_03_01772-B-0025)
A YOU KNOW A GOOD THREAT FOR US I GUESS THE  (fe_03_01772-B-0026)
ONE THING THAT I WOULD SAY ABOUT YOU KNOW IF THE UNITED NATIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT IS YOU KNOW FOR TWELVE YEARS THEY PASSED RESOLUTIONS AND THEY NEVER  (fe_03_01772-B-0027)
ENFORCED ANYTHING AND I MEAN THEY NEVER ENFORCED ANYTHING AND SO IT'S THE SAME THING AND THIS IS WHAT WHAT REALLY MAKES ME UPSET IS LIKE YOU GOT EXACTLY THE NORTH  (fe_03_01772-B-0028)
THE NORTH KOREA SITUATION  (fe_03_01772-B-0029)
NORTH KOREA SAYS HEY WE DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THE UNITED NATIONS WE ONLY WANT TO DEAL WITH THE UNITED STATES AND SO UNITED NATIONS GOES OKAY WELL THAT'S FINE  (fe_03_01772-B-0030)
SO LIKE UNITED NATIONS WOULD KEEP QUIET ON LET'S SAY THE SITUATION DETERIORATED AND WE STARTED SENDING TROOPS INTO SOUTH KOREA AND STUFF LIKE THAT THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE U._N. WOULD SAY HEY WAIT A SECOND YOU HAVEN'T GOT OUR PERMISSION  (fe_03_01772-B-0031)
BUT IT'S LIKE THEY'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING TO TAKE CARE OF THE CRISIS IN NORTH KOREA THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR TWELVE YEARS WITH IRAQ  (fe_03_01772-B-0032)
THE ONLY REASON THEY GOT INSPECTORS IN AND INSPECTORS WERE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING IS BECAUSE WE HAD A YOU KNOW A QUARTER MILLION OF OUR TROOPS SITTING ACROSS THE BORDER HAD WE NOT HAD THOSE YOU KNOW THOSE U._S. SOLDIERS THERE SADDAM NEVER WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THOSE INSPECTORS BACK IN AND SO YOU KNOW IF  (fe_03_01772-B-0033)
YOU JUST YOU KNOW IF IF WE LET FRANCE  (fe_03_01772-B-0034)
GERMANY AND RUSSIAN  (fe_03_01772-B-0035)
YOU KNOW IF WE LET THEM HAVE TOO MUCH OF A SAY IN OUR NATIONAL SECURITY THAT IS A REALLY BAD IDEA AND THAT'S WHY I THINK SO IN SOME WAYS I CAN SEE HOW THE PREEMPTIVE POLICY CAN BE PROB- PROBLEMATIC BUT I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE BETTER THAN LETTING FRANCE AND GERMANY DECIDE  (fe_03_01772-B-0036)
WHAT'S IN OUR BEST INTERESTS  (fe_03_01772-B-0037)
THAT'S THE ONLY THING  (fe_03_01772-B-0038)
SURE  (fe_03_01772-B-0039)
THE THE CHEMICAL WARFARE THE CHEMICAL WARFARE THAT SADDAM OBTAINED CAME FROM FRANCE AND AH THEN IT CAME FROM ANOTHER CORPORATION IN VIRGINIA THAT'S WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE THE AH STARTS YEAH AND THAT'S TRUE WE CHOSE A BAD PARTNER  (fe_03_01772-B-0043)
[NOISE]  (fe_03_01772-B-0044)
[NOISE] UM YEAH AND I I CAN SEE THAT THE  (fe_03_01772-B-0045)
OTHER THING IS LIKE WE YOU HAD TO PICK YOUR YOUR PARTNERS AND YOUR FRIENDS IN THE BATTLES AS THEY COME  (fe_03_01772-B-0046)
FOR EXAMPLE THE REASON LIKE WE GOT INVOLVED WITH IRAN AND [NOISE] AND LIKE SADDAM [NOISE] AND SOME OF THOSE OTHER ARABIC WITH THE HAD TO DO WITH THE IRAN CONTRA AFFAIR AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND SO I MEAN  (fe_03_01772-B-0047)
AT THE TIME REAGAN WAS AH DOING HIS BEST TO FIGHT OFF COMMUNISM AND SO WE'D TRAIN THOSE PEOPLE AS BEST WE COULD BECAUSE THEY WERE THE MOST SYMPATHETIC PEOPLE THAT WE HAD AND AH YOU KNOW MAYBE IT WASN'T A A GREAT CHOICE BUT AT THE TIME IT WAS  (fe_03_01772-B-0048)
YOU KNOW I MEAN COMMUNISM WAS SPREADING INTO VIETNAM IT HAD IT HAD GOT INTO NORTH KOREA AND SO  (fe_03_01772-B-0049)
YOU KNOW REALISTICALLY I MEAN IT IT WAS ABOUT IT WAS THE ONLY MOVE THERE WAS TO MAKE AND SO  (fe_03_01772-B-0050)
I GUESS THAT'S TRUE FOR MY OPINION I'M MU- I'M BARELY AH HAPPY WITH THE WAY AH THINGS HAVE THINGS MORE OR LESS HOW THINGS HAVE GONE ON WITH HOW WE HANDLED AH LONG TERM AND WE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW WE WERE ABLE TO DEFEAT  (fe_03_01772-B-0051)
AH OR WIN THE COLD WAR IF THERE IF THERE WAS A WINNER AND YOU KNOW AT LEAST OUR GOVERNMENT IS STILL AROUND I THINK LIKE THAT SO  (fe_03_01772-B-0052)
AH I GUESS LONG TERM WE'RE STILL HERE AND I THINK WE'RE WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB THE PROBLEM IS IS THE WAY THE THE WORLD HAS SHRUNK DOWN THERE'S NOT THERE'S NOT THE AXIS AND ALLIES THERE'S I MEAN THERE'S LILY- I MEAN THERE'S ROGUE NATIONS AND THERE'S TERRORISTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND IT'S  (fe_03_01772-B-0053)
AND IT IS THE DYNAMICS ARE SHIFTING IMMENSELY AND SO IF WE TRY AND AH I THINK IN ONE SENSE WE ARE MOVING BEYOND THE STRAIGHT YOU KNOW THINKING OUTSIDE THE BLOCKS AH FROM WHAT WE USED TO BE YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK LIKE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01772-B-0054)
WORLD WAR ONE WORLD WAR TWO THE COLD WAR I MEAN THINGS HAVE DEFINITELY DRASTICALLY CHANGED  (fe_03_01772-B-0055)
AH AS FAR AS THAT'S CONCERNED AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE MORE IT'S GOING TO GET MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT AS BECAUSE IT'S THE IT'S THE THINGS THAT WE VALUE MOST THAT MAKE IT SO EASE- THAT MAKE US SUCH AN EASY TARGET IT'S OUR FREEDOM OF THE BORDERS IT'S  (fe_03_01772-B-0056)
THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH THE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE ANYWHERE ELSE IS WHAT MAKES US SUCH A GREAT TARGET AND SO IN SOME ASPECTS WE HAVE TO CHANGE OURSELVES AND IF IF PREEMPTIVE  (fe_03_01772-B-0057)
A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE  (fe_03_01772-B-0058)
AS LOOKING AT HOW THINGS HAVE TURNED OUT WITH THE TORTURE CHAMBERS WE'VE FOUND THEY'VE FOUND MASS GRAVES AND THINGS LIKE THAT EVEN IF THERE WEREN'T ANY WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION WHICH I THINK THEY WILL EVENTUALLY FIND YOU KNOW I MEAN HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE WE SAVED ANYTHING YOU KNOW THE FUNNY THING IS THAT WE'RE NOT DOING IT FOR THE GLORY  (fe_03_01772-B-0061)
THE PEOPLE IN IRAQ ALREADY TELL US THAT THEY WANT US OUT THEY DON'T WANT US THERE THEY DON'T LIKE US AND WE AND WE KNEW THAT GOING IN THAT THEY WEREN'T GOING TO LIKE US THEY PROBABLY WEREN'T GOING TO HAVE A SYMPATHETIC  (fe_03_01772-B-0062)
YOU KNOW U._S. SYMPATHETIC GOVERNMENT YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO TURN IT BACK OVER TO THEM AND YOU KNOW THEY'LL END UP BEING THE BENEFITS FROM YOU KNOW I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT HOW MANY YOU KNOW AS IT WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO SOLDIERS THAT HAVE DIED SO FAR YOU KNOW IN THIS  (fe_03_01772-B-0063)
SO I MEAN  (fe_03_01772-B-0064)
YEAH WELL [MN] WELL YEAH THOUSANDS OF IRAQIS  (fe_03_01772-B-0065)
