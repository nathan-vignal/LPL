THAT  (fe_03_01764-B-0059)
I THINK THAT GOES ON IN A LOT OF COUNTRIES AND THE REASON WE CHOSE THERE IS BECAUSE WE WERE HOPING TO END UP WITH AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN UM WITH IRAQ AND I I HAVE SOME DOUBTS WHETHER THAT IS GOING TO BE WHAT COMES OUT OF IT  (fe_03_01764-B-0060)
UM I THINK WE MAY AH  (fe_03_01764-B-0061)
WE MAY END UP WITH AN ALLIANCE SIMILAR TO SAUDI ARABIA WHERE THEY THEY DO THEIR OWN THING BUT AH WE HAVE SOME OIL INTERESTS THAT YOU KNOW IN THE END  (fe_03_01764-B-0062)

DID NOT COME TO PASS WAS THAT AS SOON AS WE GOT INVOLVED IN IRAQ THAT AH THAT ISRAEL WOULD END UP GETTING INVOLVED AND I'M GLAD THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN  (fe_03_01764-B-0071)
WE WOULD HAVE HAD A VERY BIG MESS I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED UM AT THE FACT THAT THEY  (fe_03_01764-B-0072)
THEY KNOCKED OUT ANYTHING WITHIN RANGE OF ISRAEL RIGHT AWAY  (fe_03_01764-B-0073)
OR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A HORRIBLE DISASTER WITH SO MANY OF THE COUNTRIES THEN GETTING INVOLVED  (fe_03_01764-B-0074)
