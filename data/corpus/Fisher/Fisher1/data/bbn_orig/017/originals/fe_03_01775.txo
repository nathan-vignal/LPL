L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Tom.
R:  I'm Nicole.
L:  Hi, Nicole.
R:  Hi.
L:  Um, so what do you think?  Do you think there's any countries that are a threat to us now?
R:  Um, I think there's, like, the ones that are not, like, the ones that weren't for the war.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like those. I don't think they're a threat but I think they're, like, kinda in between.
L:  So -- 
R:  You know, like the ones that didn't want to go for the war when they were talking bad about us? 
L:  You mean, you mean, like France?
R:  And Germany.
L:  Re- really?
R:  I heard -- 
L:  Okay, I mean, you know -- 
R:  I heard -- I just heard 'cause we're boycotting their stuff now.  That's what they said on --
L:  Yeah, I've heard -- I've heard that we're -- we're thinking of punishing France in some way.
R:  Yeah, like, they said it's -- they said -- oh, no, I forget where I heard it, but they were told not to boycott all those big brands that they have out there like Adidas and stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I don't think they're a threat, I just -- they're just -- they're just, like, not our allies or anything.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I don't think they're a threat either.  Um, -- 
R:  I still think that -- 
L:  Well, I can -- mm? 
R:  I still think, like, Afghanistan and all that is still kind of -- I know we bombed them and everything but we never got that guy.
L:  No, Os- Osama bin Laden. 
R:  Yeah, we never got him.
L:  No, that's true.
R:  And we don't have Saddam either, we don't have, like, proof that we got him.
L:  Right.
R:  That's like two of them. 
L:  I wor- I worry more about North Korea 'cause they seem to have the actual capabilities to, you know, send a nuclear bomb over here.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, that's -- I mean -- I don't know but i- -- 
R:  I haven't been watching it too much any more, like, the news about the stuff that's been going on.
L:  Right.
R:  At -- at first I was watching it, like, every day, a couple of times and now I'm, like, forget it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just getting, like, too much all the time.
L:  Right, I hear you.  No, I think that's wise.  [LAUGH] It can -- it can get, ah, depressing.
R:  It is, it was.  It was just, like, I mean, I watched it just to, you know, at first when we were finding out but then once you basically realize that the country wasn't even a threat any more -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, they were just surrendering as soon as we found them.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I don't -- I don't know that any of these countries really ha- I mean, the country itself has the capabilities to really threaten us.  I think individuals can do us a lot of harm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- but I think North Korea is a possib- possible threat.
R:  Really?
L:  And it does concern me because they're actually not that far away from us either.  [PAUSE] But -- 
R:  It's just weird with the whole thing going on.  It's, like, you know, as soon as the war came up, like, all of a sudden, like, France and Germany, they weren't, you know, they weren't on our side, you know -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- they just, like, tried to take a neutral thing.
L:  Right.
R:  I heard one of them was the country that was selling them the weapons and that's why they didn't take a side.
L:  Right.
R:  Well, I don't remember if it was France or Germany but one of those countries was supposedly selling them those weapons that they had.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause they had --
L:  Well, I know at -- at that time there was a lot of talk about how we -- it was better to go with UN sanctions to, um, not just attack Iraq without, you know, UN approval.  I thought there was  -- there was a lot to be said for that argument.  We were setting a bad precedent, you know, by just -- by just going into Iraq without, you know, agreement from the other countries.
R:  I just think that, like, when you see how happy the Iraq people are, obviously it was, like, a good thing that we did it.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean -- 
L:  I agree.
R:  -- if the [NOISE] citizens of that country are, ah, -- 
L:  Right, I agree, yes.
R:  Yeah, I mean, like, if they wouldn't be so happy that we were there if --
L:  Right.
R:  You know, if they were going to be over the enemy, you know. They were -- 
L:  Right, they obviously had been oppressed and they were -- 
R:  Yeah, even -- even their soldiers were more ready to give up, you know, as soon as they saw them and as soon as they knew that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Saddam wasn't a threat to them any more.
L:  Right, right. 
R:  They were giving up and giving up their information.
L:  Right, right. 
R:  And somebody had to give us the information where Saddam was.
L:  Right.
R:  I think that was somebody probably close in his little circle of friends.
L:  Right. Right.
R:  'Cause, I mean, we knew an exact position on this.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That -- that one day that they were being hush hush.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I know they don't -- they still don't guarantee that we have him, but I think somebody had to, you know, be against him and tell him.
L:  Oh, sure.  Obviously there was a lot of people who really are against Saddam Hussein.  Understandably so, he sounds like a horrible person.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I just think, you know, I just heard, like, last week or two weeks ago India said, well, they're thinking of -- of, ah, you know, of preemptive strike against Pakistan now.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Against them, yeah, and that they should -- they had more justification for that than we had for, ah, you know, hitting, ah, Iraq.  I went, "Oh, great", you know, it's like -- 
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  -- what's next?  And both those countries had nuclear weapons.
R:  [NOISE]  
L:  So that -- that concerned me but, um, and I -- so, because of that, I -- I can see why Germany and France would oppose us going in if -- if they are indeed just wanting, ah, -- for the whole United Nations to agree on it first.
R:  Yeah, I understand that, that they should have waited.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I -- I'm still, like, I mean, I think that the whole war thing was kinda like they had a purpose.  I mean, that's -- I mean, he did threaten us though and even when he was talking to his people, he said, you know, that we underestimated him and his country.
L:  Right.
R:  Remember, like, he obviously intended -- I think that they probably did have those weapons, they probably just hid them somewhere else.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't -- I don't know if you were watching the CNN coverage, but they, um, they were talking to another president of another country right near by.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And he was all for Saddam Hussein.  I'm, like, they probably just gave it to him to hold.
L:  Right.
R:  Before they even did anything, they probably even knew -- they probably knew we were coming.
L:  Right.
R:  At least approximate and then they were just, like, "Here", you know.
L:  Right.
R:  And we're don't -- we're not going to go into his country unless he gives us a reason.
L:  Right.  
R:  [MN] See -- 
L:  Yeah, I think that is the case.  I think that's exactly what happened and I think a lot of the Iraqis fled to -- I -- those -- I think -- I guess it was Syria that has been helping them out.  But anyway, [SIGH] I -- I also know that now there's a lot of opposition to, ah, you know, the American troops staying in Iraq very long.  A lot of, you know, you're hearing -- at least I'm hearing a lot of opposition to them staying, that they want 'em out as soon as possible.
R:  That who wants them out?
L:  The Iraqis.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, because basically they're saying, "We don't want an occupying army in our country.  We -- we want to have our own country back" and that's understandable, um.
R:  I mean, yeah, that is understandable, but I thought they, like, needed help for forming their government and everything.
L:  Well, yeah, I think they did -- 
R:  'Cause how do we know that we just did all this and they're just going to have some other guy just like Saddam just take over again?
L:  Right. Well --
R:  'Cause that could happen if we don't give them some kind of, you know, help getting their country organized and everything.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Because they obviously -- you heard about all that money they found, right?
L:  Yeah, I did. 
R:  So obviously the country was not poor but he let, like, his country, like, his people like that.
L:  Right.
R:  And they had all that money sitting there. I mean, that's --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I understood that he, and, ah, -- 
R:  That's exactly the same that he did that.  I mean, he had all that money for his country and they're sitting there.  I mean, they -- just the wa- you can tell just the way they are, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  It's just, like, that's a shame that he had all that money and didn't even do anything for his country.
L:  Right.
R:  He just had 'em -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- in boxes just sitting there spread it out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think they were keeping it for themselves, the individuals.
L:  Absolutely, yeah.  I think it's great that -- that he's out and I hope they catch him.  Yeah. [PAUSE] But, ah, what's happening with North Korea? [LAUGH] Oh God, I hope that -- that gets resolved.
R:  I know, I didn't even hear that much -- anything about them, really.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, they didn't, you know, for a while they were getting really threatening.  At least, you know, their rhetoric was sounding very threatening.  I guess now they are backing off and they're agreeing to talk to South Korea and now, possibly us also and -- 
R:  We just don't need any -- any other countries just jumping the gun at war and all that stuff, you know, I mean -- 
L:  Right.
R:  Because I -- I was scared at first 'cause I thought, like, you know, oh, that was just initialized like a World War if we all just jumped at it, you know.
L:  Yeah, I think a lot of us were scared of that, exactly.
R:  Especially when, like, you know, the countries that were not agai- like, for the war was, like, you know, you just hope that nothing happened from there, you know.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, it's -- it's scary stuff.  All these weapons that people have, countries have and -- 
R:  Yeah, and -- and you don't know what they have.  You don't really know what they have. 
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, they could always keep it a secret and you wouldn't know.
L:  Right.
R:  You want to see a -- look at nine eleven, like, they really didn't see that coming.
L:  Well, some people -- 
R:  I heard they knew something but they didn't know, like, exact spot or anything.
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  But even if it is, if it's that kind of weapon, what can you do to stop it mid air, you know? 
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, if they're already -- you have to know exactly what planes they're on and [LAUGH], you know.
L:  Yeah, and it's kind of -- 
R:  I think what's scary is all the people in our country that are still terrorists.
L:  Right.
R:  There's terrorists, like, that are coming after us for us and --
