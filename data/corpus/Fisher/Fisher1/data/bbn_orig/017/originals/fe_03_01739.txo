R:  Oh, um, I didn't quite catch the -- the, um, -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- the topic.
L:  Um, are there any other -- are there any other countries that are, um, what is the word I'm trying to use -- that not afraid of but, um, that [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- I must be brain dead today.  No, I've actually had a headache all day, a sinus headache -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  --, so.
R:  [LAUGH] A headache all day, huh? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, one of those -- 
R:  That's pretty bad a sinus -- 
L:  -- sinus headaches -- 
R:  -- headache.  Oh, yeah, I've had a couple of those [MN].  Well, um -- 
L:  But my answer would be Syria -- 
R:  -- afraid of other countries?
L:  Yeah, Syria -- 
R:  About safety?
L:  Threatened is the word, that's what it is that we -- 
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  -- should feel threatened, yeah, and I think -- 
R:  Mm. 
L:  -- Syria's definitely one of them right now.
R:  Yeah, I've never been out of the country -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I -- I've only -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- been across the boarder into Mexico because my husband has a sister that lives in Douglas, Arizona, -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- and I've -- I've never been anywhere [LAUGH] you know, really -- 
L:  I haven't either.
R:  -- I grew up in the Rocky Mountains I'm -- I was born in Billings, Montana, grew up in Powaming[?] a little tiny town and I -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I then moved to Utah and I moved down to Arizona and met my husband -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and we're going to be celebrating our twenty first anniversary, we don't travel out of the state, so, for any reason -- 
L:  Well, congratulations on your twenty first.
R:  [LAUGH] Thank you. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it's, um, [LIPSMACK] I had, ah, one cousin and she married, when she was in high school there was an exchange student from Iraq -- 
L:  Mm. 
R:  -- and she married him.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Huh-uh.
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah, and she lived over there for several years, but she was too afraid to have her babies there because she always flew when she [MN] six months pregnant she flew to Casper, um, Wyoming to have her babies there -- 
L:  I can't ha--
L:  -- and then when her babies are about six months she'd fly back -- 
L:  I can hardly blame her -- 
R:  -- and her last -- yeah, and then she had twins and she stayed longer with the twins and her husband was afraid that she was going to leave him and he flew over, [LIPSMACK] after -- when -- when she had the twins and he said, "He was going to take [NOISE] the kids out shopping to buy", I think, more formula or something and he took one of their toddlers and one of the twins and he packed a bottle of formula and a bottle, diaper bag and he flew back.
L:  Oh, oh.
R:  And she -- it was just crazy [NOISE] they were sitting there, you know, my aunt [NOISE] she was my cu- my first cousin, Debbie, and -- and she divorced him later but she was married for quite a few years but I just though -- oh, I just shudder to think about, you know, she said, "She'd have to, you know, go out and cover her face and -- and" -- but at night she'd pull all the drapes and dance and stuff [LAUGH], you know.  But one time somebody peeked in the window and saw her and she almost got arrested. [LAUGH] 
L:  For dancing?
R:  Her husband was from a pretty influential family and he -- he talked to the authorities and got her out of the trouble, but -- yeah, because they -- they had to have -- be fully covered and she -- she did -- she didn't wear the uniform that she had to wear out, you know, she didn't wear the -- the robes and the coverings, the veil over her face when she was inside her house. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I'll tell you -- 
R:  -- But I would -- actually I -- I said Iraq, it was Kuwait, he was from Kuwait.
L:  Mm. 
R:  But all her children were born in the States so they're all United, you know, citizens.
L:  Yeah,  I just took -- 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Have you been out of the country at all?
L:  No, not at all.
R:  Do you have any relatives that have, um, served in the military?
L:  Um, I had a -- well, I'd guess you'd say a second cousin. 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  He was over prior to the war, I don't know if he's still over there or not.
R:  My father served in world war two, he was in the Philippines.
L:  Oh, well, my -- 
R:  He's -- he's eighty one, my dad is and -- 
L:  My father and his brother both were in world war two and -- 
R:  Mm. 
L:  -- my dad's brother, my uncle, he was killed over there, so ...
R:  Oh, yeah, my dad survived and had kinda, ah, a hurt shoulder that would act up once in a while, but that was the only injury that he -- a jeep turned over -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- then my husband, um, has a brother in law that was in Vietnam and also -- then he was called over, um, [MN] when they had the war, um, I can't think what year that was, [LIPSMACK] -- t must've been about ten yeas ago [LAUGH], um, he was over in Kuwait, I believe -- 
L:  Mm. 
R:  -- or Iraq with the -- the war -- 
L:  The Gulf war?
R:  Yeah, the Gulf, ahah, yeah, he -- he got called up, um, his son -- baby was born, he was about seven months old and when he got back from that war his son didn't even know him, you know, didn't know daddy. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, well, that's -- 
R:  That was a -- 
L:  -- understandable.  There's a lot of children -- 
R:  He still has, um, some dreams and things, you know, from -- from Vietnam but, [LIPSMACK] I never desired really to travel that much.  I mean, I'm not one, "Oh, I want to go to Hawaii" or -- 
L:  Oh, I'd like to go there -- 
R:  -- I'd kinda like to go to Europe or anything, I'm not afraid, um, I didn't want to travel after September eleventh, you know, flying or anything -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, if I ever go anywhere I'm -- I'm English, Irish and Danish and I would love to go visit the country see where my ancestors came from -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- and I wouldn't be afraid to go do something like that, but I -- yeah, Syria, you know, [LIPSMACK] and just those eastern Asian countries, you know, and I wouldn't want to go to China, of course [LAUGH] there's no way I'd want to go to China, it's scary with that, um, that -- 
L:  Or Russia --  
R:  -- disease, you know, --  
L:  -- for that matter.   
R:  -- the respiratory, yeah.  So, um, [MN] I would just not want to go to I think any of the eastern Asian countries and I have no desire to go to Africa or anything like that.  I just feel safe right in my own home town and with my [LAUGH] family and everything [LAUGH] and I'd like to be on solid [NOISE] USA ground. [NOISE] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I wouldn't want to be over there right now especially that's for sure with everything that's going on -- 
R:  Yeah, we -- we have a friend that's a pilot and he got sent over but he's just back and he's -- he's got two boys [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] and his wife has had -- fought diabetes almost all her life [NOISE] and she's so sickly looking and it's so hard to think of her taking care of her little -- her boys' [NOISE] are, um, eleven and eight I think -- eleven, eight and she is just thin and her skin is yellow and she just looks sickly like, um, she's so weak and she always has t- to carry her little kid around check [NOISE] her blood sugar and her husband got called up to [NOISE] active duty [NOISE] and, [LIPSMACK] I just thought how does she handle it?  She looks like a walking skeleton.
L:  Does she not have any family helping her?
R:  Um, she -- she -- [NOISE] they moved here about a year ago and she does have family here.  So, she does have a lot of support [NOISE] and she has friends [NOISE] and -- and a lot of extended [NOISE] family and I think they moved here for that -- that reason [NOISE] but, yeah, [NOISE] it's -- it's just taken a toll on her body because I didn't know what was wrong with her I thought she had some disease, you know, [NOISE] and it's just diabetes [NOISE] and she's very, very thin [NOISE] and she doesn't wear any makeup she doesn't hardly fix her hair [NOISE] you know, and just [NOISE] to think about her husband over there fighting, I'm so [NOISE] glad he's back [NOISE], and he's back and I don't know if -- if he'll -- I don't think he'll have to go out again.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, [NOISE] and we -- we don't know anybody else that was over there except for him [NOISE] and he came back safe, without a scratch. [LAUGH]  
L:  I talked with a woman on the internet and, um, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- she's got two brothers -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- over in Kuwait. 
R:  [MN] Oh, two?
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Wow, yeah, I don't really chat on the internet [NOISE] I do email and everything, but I'm sure when it's closer like that [NOISE] it's -- you're praying for them, you know, -- 
L:  Right. 
R:  -- because we though after when the war started [NOISE], um, I have boys [NOISE], my youngest is seven, I have one eleven and I have a daughter fourteen, I have a son nineteen [NOISE], my nineteen year old's living in Indiana right now, but we pray for the military daily. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  We pray for President Bush and we pray for the military [NOISE] and we want all [NOISE] of our troops [NOISE] to be, you know, safe and come home safe --
L:  Well, Jessica Lynch, the girl that came --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, that they rescued?
R:  Ahah. 
L:  I used to live in Parkersburg[?], West Virginia -- 
R:  Oh --
L:  -- and that is only like twenty to thirty miles from where she lived. 
R:  Wow, so you kinda [NOISE] felt a little cultural connection to her?
L:  Yeah, mhm. 
R:  [NOISE] And then we, you know, since we're in Arizona there was, ah, Indian female that was from [NOISE] um, Arizona that -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah -- 
R:  -- that was killed and they want -- 
L:  That was her best friend -- 
L:  -- they want to rename, there's a peak [NOISE] between, um, Phoenix and Touson, um, I know it is -- I'm trying to think where it is, in the Phoenix area.  They want to rename -- Squaw Peak and name it in her honor.  
L:  Mhm, you know -- 
R:  Her -- 
L:  -- it was Jessica's best friend -- 
R:  -- her last name  -- yeah -- 
L:  -- from what they were saying -- 
R:  -- their pictures were together and everything, you know -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah, that was really --
R:  -- and then she -- 
L:  -- sad -- 
R:  -- then she was rescued, so.  Yeah, the governor -- 
L:  I'm glad that  -- 
R:  -- the governor wants to rename that and, [LIPSMACK] and -- and they want to -- to honor her this -- she was, ah, -- the Indian woman that was killed.
L:  Well, I'm really glad that they rescued all the POWs -- 
R:  Oh, I know, I am too -- 
L:  -- it's sad to -- 
R:  It's already scary to think of 'em in that country and -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- and the war.  I -- I always felt though we would win -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:   I just felt that we would have [NOISE] good troops and they went in to -- [NOISE] to do what they had to do and what our country wanted for peace and, so that they wouldn't come and do more damage to our country. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] But, yeah, those -- those countries that have [NOISE] those evil leaders -- 
L:  I just can't imagine living in a country like that -- 
R:  Oh, I know -- 
L:  -- I just -- I just cannot imagine being afraid to walk down the street, or -- 
R:  Oh, and we have some friends that just moved here from Saudi Arabia and they lived there for seven years [NOISE] and all of her three daughters were born there -- 
L:  Oh, --
