L:  [NOISE] Hi, this is Marissa.
R:  Hi, this is Errol.  How are you?
L:  I'm good, how are you?
R:  Good.  So, the topic is education and computers I believe?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay.  So, what do you think about computers and education and all that?
L:  I think they're a good resource for education.  I think it makes research a lot easier in a lot of ways.  Ah, and I think that it exposes kids to more.  It could also be bad because it depends what you want to expose kids to.
R:  Right.
L:  There can be some -- some sketchy issues with the Internet, but at the same time I think all in all it's a good thing because --
R:  I -- I would -- I would agree with you in that I think computers are great because you can access very large amounts of information at a very short amount of time and I think that's good.  I think it's unfortunate, however, though, that -- because I've worked in education myself and I've found that kids a lot of times misuse computers in the sense that they want to play games a lot.  I'm -- and I'm speaking at school particularly when they are supposed to be doing education -- 
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- types of things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  X stuff, a lot of times they want to play games and listen to music and do other things that are not real productive and, um, but all in all, I'd -- along with you I think that computers are great things -- yeah, a great tool that can be used to, um, gain a terrifically -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- large amount of knowledge and information, rather.
L:  Yeah.  I think that's part of the -- the nicest part about computers is that people can get information about things that they're curious about, be it music or, I mean, games are not -- games are fun, you know, and ... 
R:  I don't see anything wrong with -- I -- I wasn't saying that -- that it's bad, se- that games are bad.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I mean, I think a lot of kids use them just to play games -- primarily to play games that, you know, as opposed to using them to do research and do other things that they're supposed to be doing, you know, like at school and that kind of thing.
L:  Oh, absolutely.  If the games are a little bit addictive -- 
R:  Right, they are.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And actually I'm -- I'm not really into the game playing anyway.  I've never really liked games that much but a lot of people are and I can understand that.  But I think there's a time and a place for everything.  And, you know, when it's time to work, it's time to work and when it's time to play, it's time to play.
L:  That's true, that's true.  But I think that they -- they also help develop skills.  I mean, computers aren't going to go away, [LAUGH] so I think they're important to education for everybody so that people could get jobs where their computer literacy is not really an issue.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  And I agree, I agree.  They're definitely not going away.  
L:  I think -- 
R:  They're not going anywhere.  I mean, they've been here for a while now and I think all of us kind of see that they're here to st- -- I know a lot of people who still haven't quite gotten on the band wagon.
L:  It's true, but -- but now as a part of education, I mean, I can -- there are a lot of pros and cons to how they could be used but I think it's almost like a necessary method of socialization is to learn how to use the computer because they're so, ah, all over the place.  You can't -- you can't really do a lot. [LAUGH]
R:  Without -- yeah, you can.  I mean, everywhere you go in every industry, every job just about, you know, you can't -- you can't escape it.  It's something that you definitely need to -- need to know.
L:  Yeah, so I guess it's more like [LAUGH] people have to learn it because [LAUGH] whether or not it's good for your education, [LAUGH] it's necessary for your life.  I mean, not entirely but for the most part, and it -- it does makes things easier.  It makes communication easier.  It makes -- but I think communication is kind of cute.  It makes that easier and it makes finding out about what you're interested in easier, whatever that may be.  It might be something really removed from wherever you are.  Ah, like, a book doesn't have libraries on or your library doesn't have books on certain things, you can just look it up on the Internet, and to an certain extent, that's -- that's good.  It could also be bad because information is not always right on [LAUGH] but, you know, you can get an idea of it. 
R:  What -- what do you mean it's not always right?  What -- what do you mean by that?
L:  I mean, there's a lot of misinformation out there and I mean, it happens in books too but I think it's a little less likely to happen in books than it is for someone to just post bogus information on the Internet.
R:  You know, and -- and, you know, that's a very good point because it's a lot easier for people to post information to the Internet.
L:  Than it is to publish something.
R:  And to publish a whole book, you know. 
L:  It's true, it's true.  I mean, even though there's plenty of, like, bogus publications out there now, it's still a little bit -- a little bit harder [LAUGH] I would think.
R:  And I would think that the -- the people who are actually legitimate, I guess it's the lack of a better word, people who are actual authorities on certain information or certain topics are more likely to have an opportunity to act- -- 
L:  To publish books.
R:  Publish.
L:  Yes, so do they.
R:  Than to -- than to post something on the Internet.  Anybody can post something on the Internet and -- and claim to be an authority on that.  I think you just have to be careful about what sources you -- you, ah, put your trust in.
L:  That's true.
R:  You know, and lend credence to because there are a lot of, um, unreliable sources of information out there on the net.  But I don't think -- I think people kind of tend to think that whatever they read on the net is gospel too, and I think that's a real danger, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Yeah, I know.  I get forwards from my mom about, like, what I shouldn't eat [LAUGH] and, like, where I shouldn't go based on that. 
R:  On stuff she read on the net?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] her friends forward her all these things, like, beware of this, da da da da da da.  So many people have gotten scammed by this or this or that.  I'm like, it's -- it's a nice heads up, it's so -- it's out there, it's kind of understanding sometimes, but at the same time, mm, you -- you do -- people -- I think that people kind of, like, enjoy a good scare every once and a while and the -- the -- [LAUGH] the way that you can pass information around on the Internet makes it so that they can just perpetuate it themselves completely.
R:  That's interesting too, because I -- I think you're right.  I think a lot of people get a big kick out of being able to pass information around and scare people because you can do it very quickly, very efficiently.
L:  And you -- you seem to be some sort of authority figure because it's been supposedly legitimated by however many people it's been sent to, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  Like, there's this new disease.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Don't answer your door to postmen wearing brown hats.  It's like anything, you could find something out there but, mm.
R:  That's true and -- and -- but usually, like, if I'm looking -- if -- if I'm doing research on a certain illness or disease or something like that, I try to stay away from doing searches.  Like sometimes I just ty- go to Yahoo and type in whatever I'm looking for, but usually I like to go to a certain website like Web MD.
L:  I -- those things make me nervous I have to admit.  I mean, [NOISE] I don't -- I know that Web MD is, you know, the legitimate thing that we see advertised on TV, but [NOISE] oops, at the same time it's, like, I have some friends that are, ah, very pretty, like, adamant, hypochondriacs and they stuff isn't good.  Maybe information isn't so good, so easy. [LAUGH]
R:  And you get such large amounts of information on different topics like illnesses, they lifted the -- all the symptoms and you go yeah, I -- 
L:  Oh, I have that. [LAUGH]
R:  I have been feeling a little bit dizzy and, yeah, my eyes are a little red and my nails are starting to get a little brittle and -- 
L:  [LAUGH] The power of suggestion.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think that kids are a lot more susceptible to sug- -- maybe not, maybe not, but I feel like, ah, I feel like as we get older we should be a little bit more disbelieving and, ah, I don't know, it depends on what sort of education you're talking about, like, what level of education.  I think it would be great for really young kids to just be able to like, look up stuff about dinosaurs and play kind of, like, dinosaur games and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, whatever, pilot games.
R:  Yeah, I -- I agree.  I -- a lot of that stuff -- I -- I have read some really interesting stuff on the Internet and -- and they have been -- like, I have done inform- -- I've done research on, ah, like herbs.  Now, that's a topic that to me is kind of -- I think the jury is still out on whether herbs actually work for a lot of different ailments and diseases and what not.
L:  Yeah, I just heard something on the radio today about how --
