L:  Hi, my name's Steve.
R:  Hi, my name's Lisa.
L:  Hello Lisa.  Let's see, okay, so apparently we're supposed to be talking about what countries we think are, ah, possible threats to the US.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What do you think?  Do you think any countries are? [NOISE]
R:  Oh, of course, I'd much prefer to be able to say, no, everybody likes us but, ah, we all know that's not true. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but who -- who -- who dislikes us enough to be a threat?  Um, mm, [SIGH] I'm -- I'm not really sure.  Ah, -- 
L:  Well, let's see.
R:  Ah.
L:  If I had to -- I'd say, yeah, we probably have, you know, some countries that are threats to us.  I'd say the US is probably the top dog.  I mean -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  We've got great intelligence and great, ah, military powers and stuff like that.  Let's see, I'd say the people who are the most -- the threat to us are probably not the ones we see on TV.  I mean, we pretty much crushed Iraq and they didn't have any offensive capability towards us.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, being that, you know, the next -- I don't think the worst that we're -- we're going to be fighting is the US, are going to be on US soil, so I'm not sure what, like, a threat would be, like, a threat to our imperialism or a threat to, like, our oil supplies or a threat to, you know, our economic control on world markets or I don't know.  I'm not sure what a threat would be.  I mean, since -- since we're pretty much on the top of a lot of lists of, ah, things that -- that are to be controlled, just about anybody could be a threat.
R:  Let's face it, they're -- there are places that are going to dislike us simply because, ah, you know, we represent what they aren't and, ah, [PAUSE] and, they say a lot of people don't like  -- well, people who are different. [LAUGH]
L:  I'd agree with that.
R:  And, um, I -- I -- who do you think dislikes the US the most?
L:  Let's see, who dislikes the US the most?  Um, let's see --
R:  Yeah, you know, you don't have to pick a single -- we're -- we're trying to come up with --
L:  I'm -- I'm trying to -- I'm trying to think of a country that we just keep on dogging.  Oh, yeah, ah, let's see, I'd probably say, Lebanon.  Yeah, I think I'd probably say Lebanon dislikes us the most.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because of our -- 
R:  Lebanon, ah, probably got [NOISE] -- my husband just added Syria.
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely Syria.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Ah, but, you know, I'd say -- I'd say we're probably, ah, got all subjects on that sorts of nasty little, ah, things written in the corners alongside our name on their list, ah.  Um, let's see who else?
L:  Um. 
R:  Um.
L:  Maybe Cambodia because we let Pol Pot kill -- I don't know -- ah, I think like nearly two million of their own -- of their own people and didn't say anything or do anything about it when we claimed to be pretty righteous about human rights.
R:  Yeah, you -- you see, they'd ha- hold a grudge about that, I would.
L:  I'm not -- I don't think there's anybody left to hold a grudge. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think they took care of it.  
R:  Ah, um, let's see, um, you know, probably people here that we don't even, you know, really think about.  Um, let's see. [PAUSE] Well, ah, there's -- there's little standards, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, Cuba still doesn't like us.
L:  Yeah, and they were aided by Russia to get those nuclear arms, so Russia surely doesn't like us.
R:  Ah.
L:  And, ah, I doubt the -- ah, I doubt China likes us.  They've been building up the largest standing army for, ah, a long time.  And there's still a -- a communist country that's calling themselves a social democracy or something like that just because the US is over there causing problems.  Um, let's see, who else do we threaten?  Well, -- 
R:  Ah.
L:  Maybe --
R:  Oh, North -- North Korea still doesn't like us.
L:  Yeah, yeah, they -- they -- I don't think they like anybody.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think they like anybody but North Korea.  They don't -- they don't even like South Korea.  They hate South Korea.  Ah, I don't think anybody is much of a threat, like, maybe, like, some rogue terrorist groups or something like that.
R:  Yes.
L:  If they had lots of funding could do something, but -- 
R:  The rogue terrorist group is what would worry me, um.
L:  I'd say the -- the largest threat to the US is probably the US.  I think that we could do the most damage to ourselves. 
R:  Mm, mm.  
L:  Like -- 
R:  The old -- the old pogo we haven't met the enemy and he is us.
L:  Right, right, because we can -- I'd see like the next war being fought on US soil is probably not going to be from foreign troops.  I imagine it would be a civil war, if anything.
R:  Oh, man.  I -- I hope that's going to be after our time. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  I don't -- the US is -- is still a pretty young country.  I think it's like less than four hundred years old at this point and everybody else has been, you know, they've had their lands conquered and just been changing names for a while.  But they have been pretty much the same countries.
R:  Yeah, but you'll notice though that, ah, that what we learned about the -- we -- we had to memorize countries of the world back in high school, ah, these names are not what we hear on the news any more. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they've changed.  Like, I don't even know what they call Zaire nowadays, I think it's like Republic of the Congo or something like that.
R:  I know -- I know a bunch of stuff in -- in Africa has changed names and, of course, -- 
L:  Yeah, like I think Sri Lanka is now called, like Chamboo[?] or something like that, I don't know.
R:  -- I -- I don't think Chamboo[?] is right. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, whatever it is.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Whatever it was. It was something that probably sounded like that.
R:  [COUGH] And then, of course, you know, what with, ah, ah, the Soviet Union all that when it dissolved and it -- everyone, you know, slid down into their, ah, splinter countries.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, man, I've -- I've never gotten them all straight.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, ah, let's just say if I grew up -- if I went on Jeopardy, ah, maybe -- maybe -- maybe former Soviet nations would not be a category I would choose. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I don't think I'd do very well there either.
R:  Ah, and, um, I'm -- I'm trying to -- you know, in my -- in my mind trying to sort of scan the globe, saying, "Okay, who's ticked off at us"?  Ah.
L:  I mentioned pretty much everybody that can be ticked off that we could subjugate us but, ah, I don't think too many people can do anything about it at this point.  We've got a -- we've got a lot of control, we should be able to perpetuate this lifestyle for a while.
R:  Ah, [NOISE] happen to have on, um, -- what was it?  Ah, the radio today and someone was talking about, ah, the missing biological weapons from -- excuse me [COUGH] Iraq and saying how it sounds like, ah, probably in the hands of terrorists by now.
L:  Mm.
R:  And that's frightening.
L:  I agree.
R:  Um, I know they -- I know there's a lot that they have accounted for, but there's some that they have not.  And, ah, the some they have not is if you added it altogether is like enough to kill the population of the world three times over.
L:  Yeah, that's what I heard, yeah, three times over.  That shouldn't be good.  You know, I -- I was -- I was wondering recently, who gets tried for war crimes?  Is it the losers of whatever war it is, and the victors are the ones who are innocent or whatever?  I mean, what -- I wonder what you consider a war crime. 
R:  That's my -- that's my impression.
L:  Yeah, so it's like the loser of the country was, like, well, I guess God wasn't on our side or that's what the winner says -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and he was, like, "Well, apparently you're guilty, let's try you for war crimes".  Last time I checked on the war, pretty much all's fair except for what's spread by the Geneva Convention.
R:  Ah, but, um, as a, um, -- I'm just trying to [PAUSE] think here on it, ah, my problem is I seem to have sort of talked out the subject and -- 
L:  Yeah, I -- I really don't think anybody is a big fat threat to the US.  I think -- I think we've got it under control.
R:  Ah --
