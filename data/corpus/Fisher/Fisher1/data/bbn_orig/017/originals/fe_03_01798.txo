R:  Hi. 
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm April.
L:  April, I'm Diana.
R:  Hi, Diana. [LAUGH]
L:  And where are you?
R:  Ah, actually I'm in south Alabama.
L:  Okay, and I'm in Houston, Texas.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  So we're both Southerners.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Are you, um, involved in the education process at all?
R:  Um, only indirectly through -- the closest I'm involved is PTO and -- [LAUGH] and chaperoning field trips. [LAUGH]
L:  Do you have kids in school, though?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how do you think about the computers?  Do you like them working on the computers?
R:  I do.  I do, only because, ah, they're gonna have to know when they get out. [LAUGH] They're gonna have to know how to use them for almost any kind of job that they're gonna -- any field they go into by the time they get out of school, so --
L:  Yes, definitely.
R:  -- it's better that they learn now.
L:  Ah, and not just learning how to use the computer, but how to find the information that they need.
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  Um, I remember going to school before computers and just beating my head up in the library trying to find anything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, the searches that they have now are so complete.  I mean, you can go to Google and just push -- everything comes flying up there.
R:  Yep.  Yeah, I know.  Ah, my daughter has a computer lab at school that they use -- that they teach them basics, typing and, and how to draw and things like that on it.  Just to learn basic skills on it.  And, ah, if I'm not mistaken their library's computerized too, so it's the same --
L:  That's great.  And I'm assuming she's in high school.
R:  No.
L:  No?
R:  She's in elementary school.  She's in second grade.
L:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That is great.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] My kids, it was about second grade when they learned to type on the computer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, they were going to school in Oregon at the time.  And they were way ahead, 'cause when we came to Texas the kids were doing it -- learning it as a freshman in high school.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but then, do you have a computer at home too?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Actually she has her own as well.  I use mine for work, so to kind of avoid the argument she got one for Christmas for her own room.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So.
L:  Do, do you have to filter it?
R:  Yes, we filter it and she does not have an email account, and she doesn't have -- um, she -- my brother in law kind of is very skilled in building computers, and he went in -- we're networked together, he went in and she's only allowed -- not only is it filtered, but she can only go to web sites that were put on a list.  It won't open anything else up.
L:  Oh, wow.  That's great.
R:  So, we had her go through and pick, like, -- I guess there's about fifteen sites on there that she can go to.  I mean --
L:  I imagine it's something --
R:  -- it won't open anything up -- else up, so.
L:  Yeah.  A second grader isn't quite as scary as when they start getting a little bit older --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, about sixth grade, fifth grade I think they start thinking that they're grown up and can do all these grown up things, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's really scary.
R:  I think it scares her more -- before he got over here to put a filter on, um, she was looking for one of the web sites that she goes to, um, it's like a, um, girls' web site --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- for preteen and teenage girls --
L:  Like girl power or something like that.
R:  -- right, something along those lines.  And she typed -- the actual website is the initials, and she just typed in the entire name, and I think it's Girls In Action is what it is, and instead of G.I.A. she typed in girls in action, and she came flying out of her room.  "Mom!" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You've, you've trained her well.
R:  I still -- yeah.  It scared her to death.  Well, we also made clear to her that anything she does on that computer we know about, we can watch her from in here on the computer, or I can go in there and pull up any place she's been and any -- anything she's done.
L:  Okay.  So she knows she can't pull anything over you.
R:  So she knows that she can't get away with -- right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And so she wanted to make sure that as soon as something popped up that she knew wasn't supposed to be on there, she came flying out of that bedroom.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "Fix it, fix it, close it, I can't get it to turn off!" 
L:  Now, do your kids, when they're at school, do they have to have special permission to use, um, the internet?
R:  Ah, we --
L:  Or aren't they using it there yet?
R:  -- we signed a release, ah, the very first week of school -- 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- allowing them to do stuff.  So, I'm not sure what kind of filters they have there on line, but most -- for the most part they don't do much surfing at this age.  When she gets older I'm sure she will for research and things like that.
L:  Right.
R:  Mostly they're teaching them basic skills right now.
L:  Oh, I was a substitute teacher in a high school, and those kids had to have a special, um, ID that allowed them to go on the internet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Their parents had to sign all these contracts and everything, and then they had to -- so that they couldn't just come in and say, "Oh, my Mom signed it", because you get busy in the library and you don't know who's doing what --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but they had the special place up there that they had to set that special ID --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- so that anybody walking through there --
R:  Could see.
L:  -- could see right away that that person wasn't supposed to be on the computer --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the were trying to pull something.  And at the high school age they always try to pull something. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Absolutely.
L:  Um, they did -- I, I subbed in a couple of classes that, um, were computer training in different -- it was, like, um, a tech class to show them the different areas that they could use computers in --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and -- yeah, it was, it was really interesting, 'cause one of them was, like, weather related, and um, graphic arts, and things like that.  Quite amazing what they, ah, --
R:  I think in the sixth grade class at our elementary school, you know how they, um, I don't know over there, I'm sure they do, um, the local TV station has weather centers in local middle schools, high schools, elementary schools -- 
L:  Yes, mhm.
R:  -- things like that.  So they've got one of those here, and they utilized that with, with, um, on line services as well.  They, um, track storms, they check the weather every day, they relate -- ah, have discussion on, um, you know, barometric pressure, things like that.  And they incorporate having that there as a service to, you know, the community, they use it as -- ah, to teach their lessons in weather as well.
L:  Now, does your, um, school system offer any adult education computer classes?
R:  They probably do.  Actually now, I live very rural.  I'm not sure if the high school out here does.  I know in the next city over, um, I'm not sure if the town does, but in the next city over the, there's several colleges.  I live right outside of Pensacola, Florida --
L:  Okay. 
R:  -- and over there, there's major education --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- classes.  So ...
L:  Um, my mom and dad, we recently put them on, and at seventy five they're typing us email, and mom's doing her genealogy and all this stuff, and she's taking a couple of classes to the, um, high school free --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for the adult education and stuff, and I -- I just think it's really great that she's able to keep up then with her grandkids all spread across the country, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and us, so.  'Cause she's back in Michigan.
R:  That's what we're probably going to have to do with my father.  I think the last time he used computers was when he was in the Air Force, and they were in a building.
L:  Yeah.  The great big ones. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I was trying to convince him with, with, um, my brother, all my brothers are pretty much spread out, Tennessee and Texas, and my youngest is in the Air Force so he jumps around a lot.  That's the easiest way to keep in touch with everybody, is on the computer, 'cause we're -- we've -- the kids have gotten -- I myself included, my brothers are the same, we're on the computer all the time, but it -- I won't put pen to paper and mail a letter, but I'll email you in a heart beat. [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.  It's gotten to the point where I'm not real sure how to use a pen and pencil anymore.
R:  Right.  Between that and, you know, using the instant messaging and the voice and everything, and not having to pay for phone calls anymore, I think he's about ready to, to go buy one and -- so then we'll have to get him educated on that as well.
L:  And it's really simple.  Um, my mom at first would freak out.  My son works for Microsoft and she was calling him constantly, "What do I do about this?", and he kept saying, "Grandma, you can't break the computer. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Just try things". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and, um, it -- she's really doing very well on it.  Every now and then she'll have to get my brother over there to help with something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, ah, for the most part, it -- she, um, three years ago they bought a word processor, but that's all it did, was word processing, and my brothers and I said, "That's a waste of money, get a computer". 
R:  Right.
L:  My dad said, "Oh, I don't want a computer, I don't need to play games, et cetera".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, now he's one the biggest game players around. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  That's what we usually -- my, my brother in law lived in Birmingham, and my husband and my brother in law would talk and video cam, you know, showing the kids, you know, make the kids stand in front of the camera and wave and everything to my brother, and he moved down here and got my father in law turned on to it, so now that's what they do more than -- more than telephone.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They don't really live that far away, but it's still long distance, so they still, they still call us on that instead of the other, and that -- you know, and my daughter's gotten to where, um, she can do that without any help as well, and she'll call her uncle.  You know --
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  -- and do that.  She bugs him more than we do. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  If she sees that he's on line she'll get on there and, and call him on the -- on the internet phone, so. [LAUGH] She goes, "It doesn't cost anything Mommy, you can't get mad at me".
L:  That's right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] She's calling the good people, so.
R:  Right, right.  That's right.  That's the only, um, access she has on her computer outside, is, is, ah, instant messaging, and she -- we gave her a list on that too.  We're very
