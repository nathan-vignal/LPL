L:  Joe from Philadelphia.
R:  Hi.  Hi, this is Sherry from Seattle.
L:  Hi, how are you doing? 
R:  Okay.
L:  Good.  Does our time start yet? 
R:  I guess so.
L:  I guess. They haven't --
R:  I guess with the, ah, beep.
L:  They haven't come back on and say otherwise.
R:  Yeah.  Ca- you know what, can you repeat the question?  I didn't hear the last -- is -- 
L:  Yes, it was actually, ah, the topic was, "Do you consider what country -- what other country do you consider other than Iraq are a threat to the United States?"  
R:  Oh.
L:  Are a threat to the United States at this point.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  The first thing that came to my mind was Syria.
R:  Ah.
L:  Because we're kind of, ah, teetering on, ah, going after them next kind of as a neighbor to Iraq, but I guess what other country and -- I guess the Middle East or I guess across the world, what would you consider the next possible threat? [inaudible] 
R:  Well, you know, Syria is in the news but, you know what, offhand, I don't really feel the threat from another country here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, it's hard for me to imagine another country being able to do what we just did in Iraq, you know, -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and bring a bunch of -- a huge military, a huge amount of arms and stuff -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, yeah, and maybe there's countries that could send their terrorists over and we could have another World Trade Centre or something but -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I -- I just don't see it, you know.  I think the Middle East is too divided up and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't know, I mean, maybe -- 
L:  I mean, it's -- 
R:  -- I'd -- I'd have to be educated a lot more on what -- I mean, even North Korea, I mean, you know, say, they do have a bomb or whatever.
L:  Right.
R:  I just ha- see, I'm having a hard time getting it over here and --
L:  Right.
R:  And maybe I'm naive but -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know.
L:  It's definitely -- definitely an interesting subject -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because I think, ah, people are divided.
R:  Mhm.
L:  In the United States as far as, ah, whether or not we should even be involved with a war such as that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, call it a threat, I think from a conventional warfare standpoint, you're right.  You know, there is no other country in the world that could -- could attack the United States the way we -- we insert ourselves in- into a country and basically just take over.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And obviously another country in the world, I mean, other than, you know, possibly the Soviet Union.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, being I guess the second super power to the United States.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  But I mean, I think we -- we -- we truly are one of the lone supervi- or [MN] superpowers left in the world.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think just by being that, I think we -- we are more of a threat to other nations than they are to us.
R:  [MN] Ah, I totally agree with that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I mean, it's a -- it's a tough call because, I mean, we -- we did suffer the biggest, ah, terrorist attack in history, um, on our soil which is kind of, um, you know, something that's never happened here and Americans have a tough time dealing with it.  As far as other countries that could possibly pull something like that off, I mean, I guess the only other threat that -- that -- that I would liken that to would be a country that would have the ability to have a nuclear weapon and be able to deploy it and launch it and -- or, you know, one of those dirty bombs -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- type, ah, weapons that can be smuggled into the United States and kind of planted in a -- in a big public venue -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- type thing, because I think -- I think those -- just the weapons of mass destruction that are -- that are available to these countries, um, pose more of a threat than the country itself.
R:  Right.  That -- that is more of a frightening concept to me -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- to just -- to have them.  To any country that they have their, um, -- the biological or the chemical -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- stuff where it's -- it's scary.  I mean, I don't even know what they can do but -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's just that, something like that I can almost imagine wiping out not the wh- whole of the United States.
L:  Right.
R:  But a lot of people, you know, a lot of people. 
L:  But causing a lot of destruction and a lot of, um, death. And --
R:  Yes.  I don't know, the thing is that scares me is that I [LAUGH] think we're making a lot of people mad at us and that -- 
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  -- and other countries have dealt with terrorism, and, I don't know, I'm not really afraid in Seattle.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think, yes, something could happen again -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- but what's the chances of me being there and if it does, it -- it's -- I mean, it's happening around the world and that doesn't make it right, but -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's part of other countries' reality and that's, um, [MN] -- 
L:  Right.  I mean, yeah, it's definitely got a point.  I think -- I think people, um, bring it into their own personal situation and say, you know, "How -- how am I threatened?" 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I guess -- I guess where I live in proximity to New York.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Closer than -- than, ah, Seattle, I think, ah, just in proximity, you know, itself, Philadelphia being closer to New York.
R:  Mhm.
L:  In fact, we knew people that were in the World Trade Centre.
R:  Oh.
L:  And we actually, you know, -- I actually work for a big financial institution that had a lot of clients that were, ah, located in the World Trade Centre so we actually knew some people who lost their lives.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And things like that, so it kind of hit more closely to home.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, more so than I think, people that are not as close in location I guess.
R:  Yeah, and, you know, it -- it did, you know, to me it did hit close to home in the sense that if I had been, say, working in a building downtown S- or Seattle -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I may have thought, "Oh, gosh, that would have been scary going to work in the days following".
L:  Right.
R:  And, I mean, I know it impacted people's lives there and, I mean, it did impact mine but I just think that a lot of planning went into that.
L:  Right.
R:  And really to me, if we had just been doing a better job of supporting the CIA and the FBI, if they'd been working better, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think good chance they would have caught that.
L:  Ah, absolutely, and I think that that -- 
R:  You know, so -- 
L:  -- that's really what -- what's going, ah, to assist us in identifying these other countries that are possible threats. I think --
R:  Mhm, mhm, but I don't think it helps it when our government comes out with, you know, buy duct tape or --
L:  All right. [inaudible]
R:  I don't know, the guy that does the Homeland Security bit when he was talking about, you know, how to prepare your -- your house and that.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, that's the same stuff.  A lot of what he was saying basically was the same stuff you should do already.
L:  Right.
R:  In case of an earthquake, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or a fire, and he could have just said that.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, look you should have this, you make, you know, for any -- 
L:  Right.
R:  You know -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- natural disaster, but instead it's -- to me it's a fear tactic and it's really too bad because there's a lot of people that are --
L:  Right.
R:  -- very frightened and -- I -- I don't think we need to change our lifestyle right now.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I think in some ways it's -- it's politically positioned to where they use that scare tactic to manipulate your opinions with other countries also.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and bringing it as close to home as possible, meaning, you know, you can -- you need to go to Home Depot and buy duct tape basically brings it right into your own house.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then they follow that up with, you know, there are countries out there that have these biological weapons and they start naming them, so they now become the enemy to you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I think it works in conjunction.  I think it's politically based at, you know, to a point, but then again, you're right.  I mean, I think if -- if we -- if we support our government enough to say, you know, we support what the FBI is doing, we support what the CIA is doing.  We -- we know that they have these known terrorists under surveillance and we -- we can pretty much deal with them on a case by case basis and not deploy an entire army -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- into a nation and basically take over.  I think that's kind of the wa- I think -- I think that's the way I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I look at it more so than -- than going in and saying, "Okay, Syria's next, so we go in and take over that country".
R:  Yeah, could you imagine.
L:  I don't know -- I don't -- I don't agree with that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think it's more we know who the terrorists are.  We know, you know, where they're being, um, protected and we know who's protecting them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So go after those particular people and go after those particular organizations.
R:  Mm.
L:  Which I think we're doing to a point, but I think, um, I think also we've -- we've kind of overstepped our bounds so to speak.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, um, really going into a country that really, I mean, and -- and -- and it's tough to say it because I really do support our troops and --
R:  I do too.
L:  -- and I really wanted to -- yeah, I really want -- want -- want them to be safe, but it -- it almost comes down to the fact that we almost have to find chemical weapons and or see them used in battle to actually save face with the rest of the world because our whole argument from day one was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and we have yet to see one -- see one -- 
R:  I know.
L:  -- materialize.  So unless we do a good job of either planting the weapons there -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] -- to make it look as -- as if we, you know, found them there or we legitimately have them used against us in battle, is really the only way that -- that the United States is really going to able to truly say that -- that we had all of our facts straight before we went into the country and took over.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and -- and it's tough.  It's tough because as the days go on, it's, you know, day after day, you're kinda waiting for that news to come back and say, "Did we find them yet?  Did we find them yet?"  And why -- that's why we're there, you know.  We were sent over there to find these weapons and -- and you're not finding them yet so I need to see something, you know.
R:  Mhm, I know.  It's like the whole world is watching.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yes.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And most of the rest of the world doesn't trust us.  I mean, people in the Middle East -- 
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- and Turkey and why would they really? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it is.  I mean, it's shown throughout history that, you know, we go in and do things in countries that aren't the greatest things and we don't -- they don't come out until much later -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- like my parents' generation.  They can't figure out, they know that --
