R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Chanice.
L:  What's your name? 
R:  Chanice.
L:  Tenice? 
R:  Chanice.
L:  Chanice.  Where are you at? 
R:  Pennsylvania.
L:  Yeah, I'm, ah, in Oregon.  My name's Amy.
R:  Okay, can't say I've been to Oregon but [LAUGH] [inaudible] there's a lot of places I haven't been.  [SIGH] Foreign relations, I don't know, that's a -- that's a -- mhm -- that's a hard topic mostly because -- well, one of the problems with the United States is that, you know, we kind of feel, like, we need to go get involved and help a lot of other places that have problems which I think of course leads to them -- some of the countries resenting us which I think kind of is how we became -- they kind of look -- I think they -- sometimes they resent our involvement which, of course, sometimes makes us vulnerable to them wanting to attack us which is probably why, you know, September eleven, that type of stuff is going on because they kind of resent the fact that we're coming over there and, you know, we think we are doing the right thing and some of the people there want us to be there but there's a big group of people who don't want us to be there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's the problem, it's like, you know, we're gonna help, we're gonna straighten it out and they're, like, -- some of them are, like, "Who asked you guys come over here?", you know.  And there's some who really, really want us there.  So, I think that's one of the problems.
L:  Well, what do you think is going on with France, what's their problem? 
R:  I don't know.  I mean they are just, like, [MN] -- they are just, like, you know, everyone is just, like, -- I mean, I don't know, I kind of thought the point of NATO was, you know, everybody kind of being unified [LAUGH] but they're [inaudible] are, like, wait a second, I don't want to do that.  So, I don't know what they call themselves doing now but I don't know, I mean, I thought the whole point of it was for them to try to be, you know, united as far as what they were gonna do and now they're just kind of doing their own thing so I don't know, I don't know -- like I said, it definitely hasn't made them very popular here and, ah, everyone here is, like, "Ooh, France", change the name from everything French, you know, they are pretty much getting, you know, the cold shoulder.  So, I don't know.
L:  I -- I have to admit that I don't really feel threatened living in the United States.  I really don't.  I don't feel, like, I'm in an immediate danger.  So, I feel a little bit disconnected from everything that's going on in Iraq and -- and, um, the war in general.  I don't really feel, like, anything's gonna happen to me.  I'm more worried that, um, you know, Mt Hood is going to blow up or something. 
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's the type of situation where [SIGH] I mean, if it happens it's gonna be something that's so completely random it's not like, you know, on a general basis, like, -- say, like in World War Two where people in London were, like, living in subways. I mean, I don't feel like that's something we need to be doing.  Like, this whole thing with the duct tape, like, I'm sorry if there is a chemical attack duct tape is not going to save me.  That's ridiculous. [LAUGH] I mean, if there's a chemical attack I'm going to die and that's just the way things are going to be so -- 
L:  Duct --
R:  -- I mean, and that's just like, oh, have like, you know, ah, ah, you know, like a fallout shelter and have the food and stuff like that and I'm thinking it really isn't going to make any difference because it really is chemical warfare.  I don't really think it's really -- you know, me having an extra couple of gallons of water is really gonna, you know, save me there, I really don't.
L:  What is duct tape supposed to do for you? 
R:  I'm supposed to duct tape my windows and stuff and the door and after it's closed you stuff towels under there and then throw duct tape so you are basically supposed to, like, seal yourself in so, you know, you don't get the chemicals and stuff.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, I mean, there -- I mean, of course, you know, so how long are you going to stay in your house.  I mean, you know, it's not like you have an unlimited supply of food there.  So, I don't know what that's supposed to be.  But that's what they re- -- that's when they ran out of duct people and people, like, ran to the stores and buying duct tape like it was going out of style and all.  I mean, so they -- I don't know, they kind of make people -- the hype, you know, or if you see so- -- you know, it -- it's -- I don't know, it's kind of making some people panic I think personally.  I think that some people are really kind of panicked over the whole situation.  But, you know, on a day to day basis I don't really think, you know, I'm feeling like danger.  I mean, if something happens it's gonna happen and pretty much not anything I can do about it, so, you know.  I mean, I went -- I've been away, I went -- I mean, I travel, I travel, I just came back earlier this month from, you know, going away and in the United States so, you know, it wasn't a big deal, it's more security that they have now which isn't a problem.  I mean, I had to take my shoes off, whatever, whatever.  And I did, I went out of the country in September and, you know, same thing.  I didn't feel like oh my God, their -- the plane's gonna be blown up.  I just, you know, figure you have got to keep living, so ... 
L:  So this last vacation you took, did you travel by plane? 
R:  Plane, both by plane, mhm.  I'm not a road trip type of person actually. [LAUGH] My limit's about five hours and I went to Kentucky.  One of my friends from school lives down there so I went and stayed with her, my first trip down there, so ... 
L:  And they had you take your shoes off?
R:  Yeah, I had on shoes, so they did have, like, a little bit of metal on them when I travelled so that might have been one of the reasons.  And then when I came back I was wearing sneakers and I didn't have to take them off.  
L:  Oh.
R:  But I know I had to take my shoes off when I was in the airport for Mexico and I was wearing sneakers.  Um, when I left Mex- -- when I was leaving -- was I leaving Mexico -- when I was leaving Mexico, headed to Houston, I had to take off, um, I had to take off my sneakers and, you know, and they looked in there.  Because, you know, you could lift up the thing I guess, put drugs in or whatever, or weapons but, yeah.  And my brother said when he is travelling they made him take off his sneakers as well.  I understand, you know, shoes have some -- a lot of shoes have metal in them, um, so, but sneakers I can't imagine why except for, you know, looking for drugs or whatever, so ... 
L:  Do you -- do you think Korea is a threat to us? 
R:  Mhm, I'm not sure.  I mean they -- they may have something, you know, going on over there.  I mean, it's like, as much as a reason of going to Iraq, we have just as much reason to be in Korea, North Korea but we are not.  So, I mean, I wouldn't rule them out either.  I mean, which kind of obviously puts us at -- you know, well, say, the military at risk because every country that, you know, might be a threat then, you know, we are going to have a war with all those countries and obviously it's expensive and, you know, it's costly in terms of lives as well, you know.  So, it's -- it's -- it's this real difficult situation.  I mean, I'm glad I'm not in politics --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- trying to figure out all these decisions, um, you know, who should we -- you know, who's a threat, who's not a threat, what should we do about the fact that they're a threat or they, you know, just don't like us and they are not going to do anything or do they have the ability to actually cause, you know, harm.  I mean, because a, you know, a decent amount of, you know, people have died over there, you know.  Already it hasn't been that long.  It's been -- you know, they started in March and it's like a, you know, a month and a half later, it's almost May, and there's been, you know, a decent amount of casualties.
L:  Yeah, I think there has been more deaths in, ah, Afghanistan and Iraq than there were here with the World Trade Centre.
R:  Yeah, I mean, it's been a lot of, you know, a lot of people unfortunately and like, you know, some of them are like, you know, the suicide guy, you know, like, -- I'm like, you know, the own -- the military guy who for some reason shot his whole group.  I'm like, what -- what in the world's going on with that.
L:  Oh the guy with the grenades or whatever? 
R:  Yeah, I'm like, what is that.  I mean, [LAUGH] I'm not understanding the whole point of that one but it's, you know, --  
L:  The Muslim -- you're talking about the Muslim guy, right? 
R:  No, well, there was the one guy -- it was the one US guy who, like, basically he wound up, like, -- he had a grenade with his unit or something like that, something really weird where he wound up killing Americans and he was an American and then of course, you know, the guy, oh, we are going to surrender but we're not and then they wound up, you know, getting a bunch of Americans, so it's, you know, -- I don't know.  [SIGH] I don't know, I don't know what the -- what the solution is.  I -- I really, really don't because there's -- I mean, there's obviously all those countries that don't think like us, you know, commun- communist countries and things like that.  But, you know, what are -- what are they really gonna do about the fact that they don't see things the way we do, so ... 
L:  Well, yeah, supposedly Cuba was a threat to us and that's why we have an embargo against them and --  
R:  And they haven't done anything.
L:  They haven't done anything to us, you know.
R:  Nothing at all.  They're just down there living real bad, not doing anything to the United States at all, at all.  Not that I would go visit Cuba or anything since we don't have diplomatic ties with them, but, um, a lot of people, some people sneak -- well, they go to Canada in order to fly to Cuba.  I know somebody who -- who did that for -- you know, I'm like, that's okay but there's enough vacation spots, I'm gonna leave Cuba off the list.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I really wouldn't want to go some place where we don't even have diplomatic ties.  That's a little scary, that's definitely a little scary.
L:  It's supposed to be a nice place to live if you don't mind, you know, being in a conservative place. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've heard Cuba's real nice, but I don't know.
R:  I guess I'll -- I'll stick to the rest of Carribean. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] The rest of the places.
L:  I guess I'm, you know -- I think that we are more of a threat to ourselves.  I think that, you know, a lot of, ah, these home grown hasty type guys are, you know, more of a threat to us, local militias.
R:  Yeah, we do have a lot of, like, Pennsylvanians, like, they hate capital, we've got a lot.  I mean, I live in Phi- -- I live outside, outside of Philadelphia but there's a lot of hate groups in Pennsylvania, you know, there is a lot.  We have a real problem with that here, you know.  You know, the cities are like one thing but, like, there's like, three big decent size cities and the rest of it is really kind of roll, really kind of backwards, you know.  Um, definitely.  Definitely we had some real problems with that, like you never see anything like that in the city but, you know, you hit the turnpike and you head out west, you know, Philadelphia is like God knows.  It's not something I make a habit of doing, not at all.  So, yeah, we do have --
