L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, um, who's this?
R:  My name is Bridget.
L:  Okay, hi, Bridget, I'm Anuja[?].
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  Where are you c- -- where are you talking from?
R:  United States.
L:  Yeah, like, where?
R:  Indiana.
L:  Okay, I'm from, uh, State College, Pennsylvania.
R:  Okay.
L:  Okay, and, um, like, um, hi. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, shall we talk about the topic, if you don't want to know anything about me?
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] sure. 
L:  Okay, um, well, I guess our topic is that do we consider any other country a threat to United States, and if yes, then which and why.
R:  Mm-kay.
L:  Yes, um, do you want to go ahead?
R:  Um, right now, I don't consider any other country a threat.  I did, but right now, I do not consider any other country a threat.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Do you?
L:  A- -- uh, well, what do you think about, uh, what do you think about the war that just happened with Iraq?
R:  I think it was a good thing.
L:  Um, yeah, do you think, like, if Iraq or Saddam Hussein wasn't considered a threat, then why did -- why did Bush really take on the war?
R:  I personally think he was a threat, and I -- I personally think he's g- -- we're still going to find, uh, weapons of mass destruction.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So, I -- I think eventually we'll find some.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I also think that, uh, he's done harm to an awful lot of people we'll never know about.
L:  Oh, really?  But then, do you -- do you think at some point in time -- are you -- do you think even a pa- part of it is justified or anything, or do you think what he did was absolutely, you know, it -- it was just not the way it should have been?
R:  Uh, that Saddam was justified --
L:  No, no --
R:  -- or Bush?
L:  Bush's -- Bush's, uh --
R:  I think Bush was justified.
L:  Oh, he was?
R:  Yes.
L:  So, then do you think then Iraq was or was not a threat?
R:  At that time, I think Iraq was a threat.
L:  Okay, so it was good that now his regime is ousted and everything?
R:  Correct.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.
R:  But now, I -- I don't consider [SIGH] --
L:  Um --
R:  -- anybody a threat.
L:  Okay, and do you -- do you -- do you think Al Queda and, uh, mm, you know what happened on September eleventh, and people linking it to Osama bin Laden, is any of that really a threat to United States?
R:  Yes.  I know somebody who was killed in September eleventh, so I [MN] definitely feel like [SIGH] it was, uh, [SIGH] Saddam or [SIGH] his partners or his underlings that, uh, somewhere along the line, I do believe that [SIGH] it was caused by him or in some way his ideas that caused it.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, well, I personally do think, um, although I don't know what the September eleven findings and, you know, whether it was the Al Queda and Osama bin Laden, but I do think that, um, w- -- the United States is threatened by a whole lot of people, and I do believe that, um, it's, you know, the Islamic community, basically it's really, really enraged right now, and I do feel that, um, uh, you know, like, basically the Muslim population like, they're not too happy with Bush's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- yeah, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- yeah, so, I -- I don't want to pinpoint any particular coun- country like that and say, like, well, you know, let's say m- -- Pakistan or some, you know, Middle East country is threatening United States, but I do think, you know, since, you know, that community consists of a h- -- [MN] that community is, like, pretty huge, um, we could expect that they could pose a threat to the United States and that's --
R:  I think they feel threatened by us too.
L:  Yeah, but then that is what is ha- -- that is what happens because, you know, United States is a superpower, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so people kind of, you know, to -- in order to kind of defend themselves, in -- in order to kind of protect themselves, they probably, you know, leash terrorist activities on us and, you know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that obviously is a threat to at least the f- -- the common citizen of United States, you know?  So, I don't feel, well, [MN] they ba- -- it's kind of, you know, both ways, so -- and, um, well, I'm -- I'm from India, and, uh, we're like, in constant war with Pakistan.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, believe me, I'm, like, I -- we -- we're kind of used to it, because ever -- ever -- ever since we were kids, we've always seen, you know, lynchings and killings on television and, you know, like, it's -- it's --
R:  Not necessarily by US, but by --
L:  No, not necessarily by the United States, but like I said, we -- we're at war with Pakistan over a -- over a Kashmir issue.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, like, we've been seeing all this pretty much, and so it kind of, you know, it's -- it's kind of usual for us, that okay, you open the newspaper and the headlines are, you know, hundred people killed in Jammu in Kashmir, and things like that, so -- but I don't think people hear, they're kind of so used to it, so --
R:  No, they aren't.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have a very, very good friend from India also who --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- feels extremely threatened by all of this, and can't go anywhere without being -- just feeling threatened, even if nobody says anything, she feels like she is threatened, and I -- I believe she probably has good reason to feel that way, that -- that even though we're not out to get her, she thinks that people are, and -- and I'm sure some people would, so --
L:  Yeah, I -- yeah, because, um, like, you know, the -- what happened September eleventh, it's kind of -- it was something big that rocked America, but, um, believe me, these kind of things are kind of normal for us, you know, back home, so --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- uh, yeah, so I -- I believe --
R:  You don't like to hear it, but you -- you see it all the time, right? [SIGH]
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, she's told me a lot of things she's seen that I never want to see, [LAUGH] never. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  So, that is -- that is right, and I think also that probably, you know, it -- it's -- it's basically that Middle Eastern and the Al Queda and the Islamic community that stood out as people who -- who probably could threaten the United States maximum, and I don't know, like you said, you know, they -- they feel that United States is a threat to them, so probably in defence they act, and what happens is wars and, you know, more problems and things like that.  So --
R:  In, um, just in India, without Al Queda, is there not another threat within India to Indians themselves, though?
L:  No, it's -- it's basically w- -- it's n- -- I wouldn't say Pakistan is Al Queda, but Pakistan is a very big thing with us, because we are -- we are constantly in proxy war with them, and even the northern part, because they -- we -- we're fighting over, uh, trying to protect Jammu and Kashmir and, you know --
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, and they want it, because at the -- at the time of partition, you know, that -- that came to us, and that's a very big tourist attraction and it's a very big, uh, place, you know?  So, Pakistan wants that too, so we've never been able to resolve that -- that, you know?  But it should --
R:  So, Pakistan will always be against you, or probably always be against you?
L:  Yeah, they are.  Well, because they -- they -- they claim that, "Well, it belongs to us" and we say, "No, because at the pa- -- time of partition it came in our territory", so, well --
R:  Can you travel i- -- being in India, can you travel back and forth to Pakistan or no? 
L:  Um, uh, pr- -- basically, well, at the -- at one point in time, our Prime Minister did start a train, kind of as a friendly gesture --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know?  But then I think that was -- that didn't work out.  So, it's not really safe to travel, and --
R:  Right, it's not safe, but I didn't know if it was legal.
L:  No.  It -- it isn't really illegal, because, uh, let me tell you, at the time of partition -- partition, many families were split, so we still have families --
R:  Ah, okay.
L:  Right, you know?  So, you cannot say it's illegal --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but it definitely isn't safe --
R:  Safe. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and it definitely isn't so easy.
R:  Uh, she doesn't travel anywhere over there.  She tells me it's just not safe to -- stay home, it's just not -- not safe to go anywhere, so --
L:  Y- yeah, but I wouldn't say it's illegal or anything --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- because, yeah, I mean, because you cannot, like, y- you cannot allow families not to see each other and stuff, but it's -- it's everybody's personal choice.  If they do not do that because it's not safe, that's it.
R:  Okay, all right.
L:  Yes, um --
R:  -- So, it's not -- oh.
L:  -- that's how it is.  And probably because of what happened here recently in the war and everything, in United States, I think, um, you know, the immigration laws have also become such that, you know, United States has kind of become a little strict with --
R:  They're very strict.
L:  Yeah, with a- -- with who to allow and who not to allow to enter their country.  So, it's -- I -- I think it's just having its repercussions everywhere and I like --
R:  I think, yeah, Bush is being a little too strict though, on --
L:  Y- yeah, because --
R:  -- some of his --
L:  Yeah, because there are students, you know, who really deserve to come here, and they're just denied visas and stuff like that, so ...
R:  I have a -- a child who's a student at -- in Canada, and she cannot come home because of Bush.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Bush has closed the border, so he --
L:  Oh, is it because of SARS these days?
R:  No, she -- she had that, but no, uh, no, it's, uh, t- -- just because of terrorism.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Because too many of the terrorists were on student visas.
L:  Oh, right.
R:  So, Bush closed it to everybody on a student visa, can't go either way.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So, you know --
L:  I thought Canada was kind of a little easier, because Canada and United States kind --
R:  They're supposed to be, but they're not.  He -- he -- it's a little hidden fact, but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but Bush had closed that, and if you're any kind of a student visa, if you're just an adult on a regular driver's licence you're fine, but [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you cannot go anywhere, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- hopefully he's gonna change his little mind, but I think he kind of went overboard on that and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- anybody that looks suspicious of any sort and --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- like the poor little college kids, they're -- and the college kids here are stuck too.  If you're Canadian on a visa here, you can't go home either.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  So, actually, the thing is, I think, um, a- after that September eleven thing, they've started, uh, they've really started keeping, uh, data --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- files for, you know, students who come here on --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- a student visa.  They make sure that they are studying, and they are not doing anything else that they're not supposed to do.  So --
R:  She has to check in constantly --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- to make sure that, yeah --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- which is good.
L:  Yeah, which is good.  So, that what I mean to say is that -- that they should still allow people to come and they can -- what they can do is probably, you know, keep a tab on them and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- kind of, you know, just -- 
R:  [SIGH] See what they're doing and make sure they're, yeah, doing honest things, but [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, Bush is just going overboard --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and saying, "Nobody can do anything" just in --
L:  I --
R:  -- case, and --
L:  -- I think so too, be --
