L:  Hi, my name is Erin. 
R:  Hi, my name is Zoe.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you?
L:  Good, how are you? 
R:  I'm good, this is my first call. 
L:  Oh, okay?
R:  And a -- trippy. 
L:  This is my second [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It is a little weird.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] At first -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then you get used to it.
R:  Yeah, but ... um, so what was the question, do we consider a foreign country a threat to the nation.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  What about you, what do you think? 
L:  Yeah, North Korea.
R:  I was going to say the same thing. [LAUGH] That's pretty much -- 
L:  Good.
R:  The only one, I mean I -- and I don't even know how much of a threat I consider it to us but just in general.
L:  Right, to the world.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, definitely to the world.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I think that they're just [SIGH] waiting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I- -- you know, maybe not soon, that they will do anything soon but I'm sure that soon enough they will do something to either us or to South Korea -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- or one of their neighboring states.
R:  Right.
L:  That will be -- that will cause us to want to rear up and act again like -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- we did in Iraq.
R:  Right.
L:  And I also think it's -- it's -- with the war in Iraq [MN] I think that we're just waiting for another country.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Which is not a good thing. [LAUGH]  
R:  No, I -- I -- I agree.  I feel like that -- that the country has, um, -- well, that the gov- -- that the President, has sort of set us up. 
L:  The President, exactly.
R:  -- has set us up.
L:  Exactly, the President.
R:  You know, he's like, you know, "If you are not with us, you are against us so", you know, anybody who makes the first move we are just gonna jump on them.
L:  Yeah, 'cause now we have shown our power already so we are -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ready to, you know, if -- if any other countries step out of line -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, we will be right there.
R:  Right.  What's frustrating to me is that, you know, we define what out of line is and --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that, you know, it's -- of course in our best -- it's -- it's somehow in our interests to find countries that are out of line so that -- I don't even know, so that the American people will feel safe.  I don't -- I don't quite get, like, what the strategy is. 
L:  Yeah, we're the rule setters of the world -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- now, and I can understand why other countries will be really, you know, annoyed.
R:  Right. 
L:  At -- at that fact. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I am a little annoyed at that fact myself.
R:  Yep.
L:  I mean, you know, I look at other countries and I think, "Okay, would I -- would I live -- would I want to be a resident of any other country", um, and, you know, nowadays it's a -- it's little bit harder to -- to say.
R:  Right.
L:  As, you know, years ago -- you know, I'm a Democrat, so -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, whe- -- when Clinton was in office I was, like, "Hey, yeah, you know --" 
R:  Right.
L:  -- I'll live in America, sure.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is great, I have money for my education, I have money for" -- 
R:  Totally.
L:  -- you know, and -- and he went into Bosnia and -- and really just took care of things without creating this huge media hype.
R:  That's true.  That -- that -- that he did well, yeah.  I mean, [NOISE] it's funny during the Clinton years I -- I felt -- I  wasn't really paying at- very close attention.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Sort of thing for -- there was stuff we were getting involved in but it didn't feel, like, we were out of line, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  And -- and, yeah, people are now saying well, Bush went ahead and did this without UN approval and people are saying that's so horrible but so did Clinton.
L:  Well, right and Clinton did it without -- no- not only without U- UN approval but without the nation's approval.
R:  Right. 
L:  In general. 
R:  Right.
L:  And literally it took one quarter of the time.
R:  Yep. 
L:  You know, more lives were lost but that's because the war had already been going on for so long?
R:  Right, it was something that had already started, we didn't initiate it.
L:  Right, and -- and no other countries got up in arms about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're, like, "Okay, you go in, you do your thing".
R:  Right.
L:  He did it silently.
R:  Right.
L:  And that -- what did -- that caused our economy not to --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- drop, you know, and I think that, um, it's -- one the other callers I was on the line with was talking about she thinks that Russia --  
R:  Huh.
L:  -- is a --  
R:  Is a threat.
L:  Yeah, and [COUGH] I -- I tended not to agree with her whatsoever because I just think the Cold War years are over.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, Russia is all split up, they are not a Soviet Union any more -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- there are different states.
R:  Yeah, I -- yeah, I -- I actually -- I have actually spent some time in Russia. I was there for -- 
L:  Oh, really.
R:  -- I was there as a foreign exchange student for a month in high school.  That was ninety four. 
L:  Mm. Okay.
R:  And, ah, you know, [MN] they have so much of their own problems to deal with there. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah.  They're just try- -- they're just trying to deal with right now the fact that they're a democracy.
R:  Exactly, they're just trying to get their economy going and just trying to figure out like this whole, you know, free currency thing. [LAUGH] I mean it's like -- 
L:  Right.
R:  I really don't think --  
L:  And with the Euros now coming up they're all messed up.
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  So, they're not -- they're not -- I don't think they're a threat to us at all.  I mean, I know they oppose the war.
R:  Right, right.
L:  They strongly oppose the war.
R:  But, you know, there's plenty of countries and, you know, "Do we consider France a threat to us?", "No", you know what I mean. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, right.  They just -- I mean Russia didn't want to get involved because now they are a democracy, they had too many business deals going on with other countries.
R:  Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yep.
L:  Dangerous.
R:  I think -- I think the whole, the whole Iraq thing is interesting, thinking about it in comparison with Bosnia.  It's l- -- I mean, I think one of the reasons why there have been so many, um, you know, strong opinions about it just around the world has to do with the fact that, you know, Bush was saying, "That we're gonna go in there and get rid of Saddam because he's about -- because who knows what he'll do and he's gonna, you know --"   
L:  Right, the weapons of mass destruction.
R:  Right.  Invade other people, screw up other people".  Whereas in Bosnia it was sort of like, we are going to go in and help this region take care of whatever, you know what I mean --" 
L:  Well, right, that was the thing -- 
R:  -- like help them figure out the [inaudible] that they're dealing with. [LAUGH] 
L:  And Clinton -- and Clinton didn't sit there like -- like Bush is right now going I'm the ultimate liberator -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- of the world.
R:  Uh-huh, right.
L:  Bush is sitting there going look at me, I have liberated the country --  
R:  Oh God.
L:  -- no, you -- you weren't, you were flexing your power because --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you wanted to show something.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  You know, and it's in his family tradition to start wars. 
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, if --  
R:  But if there's a nation that is a threat to the United States I think maybe the nation is the President, you know, President Bush, like it's just [inaudible] --  
L:  Exactly. The Republican Party populates -- 
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- the one. I don't trust them at all.
R:  No, no, no. 
L:  With any -- 
R:  It's really frightening to me how, um, you know, how strong their agenda is and how little it's base in reality, you know. 
L:  Right.  And, you know, if you a- -- if you were to go to any other country and you were to ask people who do you think is a threat to your nation they would say the United States.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  And especially now. 
R:  Yep.
L:  All of them --  
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- would say the United States besides Britain.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, they -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- might say the same thing they were saying -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- like North Korea.
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  Or Iran.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, maybe they'd say --  
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, they're -- they're not -- people in that region I think, um, you know, there may be certain cells, like -- like the Taliban and things like that who -- who I do fear, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  But I -- I fear because they are so quiet.
R:  Yeah, mhm. 
L:  You know that -- that, you know, it's like the shady guys in the classroom, you always got to worry about the real quiet one -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- not the class clown.
R:  Exactly, right.
L:  You know, and that's -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's exactly what they are -- 
R:  Right, right, right. 
L:  So, if you really have anything to fear I guess it would be just extremist cells of terrorism.
R:  Yeah, and -- and I feel like, um --  
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- regardless of whether -- I mean, sure, you know, it's better not to have nations that are funding terrorists.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But even if there aren't any nations who are, like, openly or obviously harboring, you know, terrorist cells or whatever, they are still gonna be there.  I mean, they're still gonna -- 
L:  Yeah, you are gonna find them everywhere.
R:  They're gonna find their money, they're gonna find their ways to do what they want to do and they are going to do what they want to do because of, you know, actions like the United States have just taken the past in the few months.  
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, that is exactly what this is -- and, you know, the thing that I think that is so explosive too about -- about the kind of situation is also the whole, um, you know, Islamic versus western world --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Thing.
L:  Yeah, and you -- you know, I -- I hate to say that's partially our fault but it -- it's not our fault.  What it is, it's a part of the government to not educate --  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  The masses --  
R:  Yep. 
L:  On the Islamic religion.
R:  Yep, so true.
L:  You know, I mean -- or any other religion for that matter besides --
R:  Right.
L:  -- besides the primary Christian Catholic religion.
R:  So true.
L:  You know, I'm -- I'm Jewish and I'm like, I can't believe how, you know, people, even, you know, I don't know what state you live in, what state do you live in? 
R:  I live in -- I'm -- I'm in Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, Philadelphia, okay, I'm in Los Angeles.
R:  Oh cool.
L:  Yeah, and so people, I mean even in Los Angeles are like, oh, you know, what did you do, what are they --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know -- 
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- what's this, what's that.
R:  Right.
L:  -- or if anybody, you know, even one of my friends is Iranian and they're like you can be Iranian and Jewish at the same time.
R:  Oh, my God, yeah.
L:  And I'm like yeah, yeah.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  You can be -- guess what, you can be -- you can be Chinese and Jewish at the same -- 
R:  Right, right, right, right, right.
L:  -- time too, you know and ... 
R:  Well, I think, yeah, for me, I mean I grew up, I actually grew up outside of Boston.
L:  [COUGH]  Mhm. Okay. 
R:  In a very, very Jewish town.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, when I went to college it was kind of the first time when, you know, there weren't a large percentage of Jews around.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, it really made me realise that, you know, first of all my education was not -- I -- I was educated in the public schools but it was just really well off school, a really -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- excellent public school system.
L:  Right, so -- so was I.
R:  Where everyone was Jewish but everyone knew that --  
L:  So was I, exactly.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I had the exact same experience.
R:  Yeah, so you don't know, like, how little everybody else knows.
L:  Yeah, and it's scary. 
R:  You know, it was a shock.  Yeah, it is scary.
L:  You know what is really scary is that now that, um, you know, I don't mind mentioning my age, I'm twenty four. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And now that, you know, that I am done with college I will go around and look at people that are my same age and ask them, that this is that question, like what -- what do you -- who do you think -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is gonna be, you know, and -- and they will say, like the most off the wall things.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, to me like, oh, well, you know, now we have got to worry about France --  
R:  Exactly. 
L:  -- because they're against the war.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm like you're so ignorant.  How can you be my age.  
R:  That's horrible.
L:  And -- 
R:  Well -- 
L:  -- you know, it's -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- not just them, it's a lot of people.  But I -- I guess I'm more shocked at my peers.
R:  Yeah, yeah, that -- that -- I -- yeah, I tend to think the same thing, that people my age should somehow have realised that, you know, what the propaganda media machine does, you know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- instead of what they want you to think but, you know, they're folks from, you know, everywhere, every part of the country but I tend to think -- you know, I tend to prejud- prejudicially think of, you know, the mid west or wherever -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- there is so few minorities that people really don't have any experience with --  
L:  Right, this last --  
R:  -- anybody different from them.
L:  This last woman I was talking to about this exact subject --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Her exact words to me were I don't usually talk about this because I'm a little ashamed but my sis- --
