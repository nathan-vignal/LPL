L:  Hi.
R:  Good evening.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Dave.
L:  I'm Rachel.
R:  Hi, Rachel, how are you doing?
L:  Good, how are you? 
R:  Good.  I'm in Salt Lake City, Utah.
L:  Okay.  I'm in Pennsylvania, outside of Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  First time I've met anyone from Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh.
R:  On this little University of Pennsylvania thing. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  The last guy I talked to was from Phoenix.
L:  Oh, how did -- how do you find out about the study being so far away? 
R:  Ah, I'm a linguistics major.
L:  Oh.
R:  Here at the UIU- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and so they just kinda linked up. 
L:  Yep.
R:  And so I was kinda like I got it.
L:  That's how I found out too.
R:  Oh, are you a linguistics major?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Nice.  Whoa.
L:  Um.
R:  Um, what I guess do you -- what -- what -- is there a country that you feel that, ah, is -- currently threatens the United States',  ah, safety?
L:  I was thinking about that.  It's hard.  I think, um, I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Ooh, a strange noise.  Are you still there? 
R:  Sorry, yeah, I'm sorry, I'm in the car, I just -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  Bell went off real quick.
L:  Um, like, I -- I've been thinking lately that -- that the US is sort of a threat to its own security.  Um, partly, like, in -- partly in how it's acting with other countries, like, um, I mean, it went to the UN but it -- there were a whole lot of countries not in favor of -- of the actions taken in Iraq.
R:  That's true.
L:  And also partly in terms of, like, by saying, well, we are going to use preemptive force, we are, like -- like, that that's just -- um, could op-, you know, could set precedents but then if other countries follow, um, could be not so great and also in spending lots of money, um, not on things like health care and food, um, is hurting the people here.  Um, so I guess, like, while I don't -- I don't know what -- what outside forces are threats or aren't threats.  Like, I do think the US is one.
R:  Is a threat to its own national security?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Or is acting as one. 
R:  Okay.  And I -- I -- and I've heard the point before it's, like, if -- if everyone has a preemptive attitude, then everyone preempts each other and so all it does is lead to more conflict, and I -- I have heard that.  Um, the only thing is, like, I don't know, that as far as I guess sticking to the topic before, I -- I -- I would like to just stress kind of what you said just a minute, ah, ago.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But North Korea actually has -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Technically they think they -- they have a -- a weapon, a -- a missile -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that can make it over here.  But as far as I know, they've never, you know, they've never actually tested it.  They've just said, "They have it" and so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- who knows if they do or not.
L:  They were certainly saying worrisome things, um.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- 
L:  Back when they were still -- 
R:  That's -- and actually I -- I'm a Chinese linguist.  That's kinda -- 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Kinda what I do for -- for my career -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so we do lot with the Koreans and, you know, we're just not -- the United States, ah, we're generally like a bull in a China shop.  We're not very good, like, with the political maneuverings and stuff like that and the oriental community is all about face and how to maneuver and all about diplomacy and -- 
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- we haven't learned that much but, like, China and, like, North Korea, they'll say all these scary things but I really don't think they're that, you know, they're not, you know, they know if they were to do something like send a nuclear weapon our way -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that there would be absolute and complete retribution for that, like, there's no doubt that they would be, you know, wiped out and that's kinda, you know, the -- the way it has to be.  There has to be that understanding [NOISE] otherwise, ah, you know, someone -- someone will do that to us.  But, ah, as far as the country, I'm not sure any country really creates a -- a, you know, a good threat for us.  I guess the one thing that I would say about, you know, if the United Nations and things like that is, you know, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for twelve years they passed resolutions and they never enforced anything and, I mean -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they never enforced anything and so it's the same thing, and this is what -- what really makes me upset is like you got exactly the north -- the North Korea situation.  North Korea says, "Hey, we don't want to deal with the United Nations, we only want to deal with the United States", and so United Nations goes, "Okay, well, that's fine", so, like, United Nations would keep quiet on -- let's say the situation deteriorated and we started sending troops into South Korea and stuff like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Then all of a sudden the UN would say, "Hey, wait a second, you haven't got our permission", but it's, like, they're not doing anything to take care of the crisis in North Korea.  They didn't do anything for twelve years with Iraq.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The only reason they got inspectors in and inspectors were able to do anything is because we had a, you know, a quarter million of our troops sitting across the border.  Had we not had those, you know, those US soldiers there, Saddam never would have allowed those inspectors back in.  And so, you know, if you just, you know, if -- if we let France, Germany and Russian, you know, if we let them have too much of a say in our national security, that is a really bad idea and that's why I think so.  In some ways I can see how the preemptive policy can be prob- problematic but I think that's a little better than letting France and Germany decide what's in our best interests.
L:  It's really --
R:  That's the only thing.
L:  -- I mean, Iraq really is problematic to talk about and -- and difficult.  We had, ah, at school, um, there's a few Iraqi artists who are in exile visiting this week.
R:  Sure.
L:  And one of them brought up the question of why in the anti war movement didn't -- wasn't there more dis- here, wasn't there more discussion of civil rights, ah, human rights and the -- the violations done by Saddam, and -- and that is terrible, but, um, people arguing for human rights might be helping him in some un- indirect way or not helping but -- but I don't know, on -- I don't know, that's -- it is terribly complicated when there's two things you don't want happening -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and they're in opposition to each other and you don't know how to oppose both.
R:  Yes, setting the traps.
L:  Um, but -- but the other thing about preemptive is that -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, I just think that a lot of -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- from what I hear and read, like, a lot of US actions in the past contributed to the problems there are now, like Saddam being in power, Osama bin Laden getting power and -- and money, the weapons that Iraq did get, um, in the past, the --
R:  The -- the chemical warfare? 
L:  -- to help funding.
R:  The chemical warfare --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that Saddam obtained came from France and, ah, then it came from another corporation in Virginia.  That's where the majority of the -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the, ah, starts, yeah, and that's true.
L:  And I just think -- 
R:  We chose a bad partner.
L:  I just fear, um, the decisions being made today that seem, like, maybe that seem -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that seem like good decisions and decisions for security ending up, you know, like that and that -- [PAUSE] 
R:  [NOISE] Um, yeah, and I -- I can see that.  The other thing is, like, we -- you had to pick your -- your partners and your friends in the battles as they come.  For example, the reason, like, we got involved with Iran and [NOISE] and, like, Saddam -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] -- and some of those other Arabic with the -- had to do with the Iran contra affair and things like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so, I mean, at the time Reagan was, ah, doing his best to fight off communism and so we'd train those people as best we could because they were the most sympathetic people that we had and, ah, you know, maybe it wasn't a -- a great choice but at the time, it was, you know, I mean, communism was spreading into Vietnam.  It had -- it had got into North Korea and so, you know, realistically, I mean, it -- it was about -- it was the only move there was to make and so -- 
L:  Oh, but, see, I think that, like, if things are ever going to get better, that needs to be not the only move there is to make.  There needs to be, ah, like, a -- oh I don't know, stereotypical thinking outside the box, I guess, or, like, a -- a more long term lighter thinking of some sort that can get beyond that.  If -- I mean, not that that's easy, clearly, but if there's going to be any change, um, --
R:  I guess that's true.  For my opinion, I'm mu- I'm barely, ah, happy with the way, ah, things have -- things more or less how things have gone on with how we handled, ah, long term and we actually, you know, we were able to defeat, ah, or win the cold war if there -- if there was a winner and, you know, at least our government is still around.  I think like that, so, ah, I guess long term we're still here and I think we're -- we're doing a good job.  The problem is is the way the -- the world has shrunk down.  There's not -- there's not the Axis and Allies.  There's -- I mean, there's lily-, I mean, there's rogue nations and there's terrorists and things like that and it's -- and it is -- the dynamics are shifting immensely and so if we try and, ah, I think in one sense we are moving beyond the straight, you know, thinking outside the blocks, ah, from what we used to be, you know, if you want to go back like, you know, World War One, World War Two, the Cold War.  I mean, things have definitely drastically changed, ah, as far as that's concerned and we're going to have to change more.  It's going to get more and more difficult as -- because it's the -- it's the things that we value most that make it so ease- -- that make us such an easy target.  It's our freedom of the borders.  It's the freedom of speech, the freedom of movement that you will not have anywhere else is what makes us such a great target and so in some aspects we have to change ourselves and if -- if preemptive -- a preemptive strike, I mean, I -- I don't know, I -- as looking at how things have turned out with the torture chambers we've found, they've found mass graves and things like that, even if there weren't any weapons of mass destruction which I think they will eventually find, you know, I mean, how many people have we saved anything?  You know, the funny thing is that we're not doing it for the glory.  The people in Iraq already tell us that they want us out, they don't want us there, they don't like us and we -- and we knew that going in that they weren't going to like us.  They probably weren't going to have a sympathetic, you know, US sympathetic government, you know.  We're going to turn it back over to them and, you know, they'll end up being the benefits from, you know, I mean, I don't know what -- how many, you know, as it was, one hundred and forty two soldiers that have died so far, you know, in this? So, I mean, -- 
L:  And how ever many Iraqis.
R:  Yeah, well, [MN] well, yeah, thousands of Iraqis.
