R:  Hello, I'm Margaret.
L:  Hi, I'm Krystal.
R:  And, ah, would you like to go first about foreign relations?
L:  Well, I don't know.  This is kinda off my -- I don't know if -- 
R:  Okay -- 
L:  -- I should of got -- participated in this or not.  Do I feel --
R:  Well --
L:  -- other countries are a threat to us?  Is that the question?
R:  Yes.  Um, for example I could start by saying, yes, I think that, ah, certain countries are always a threat to us, ah, it would probably vary.  You know, during different regimes and so forth, but I would expect that, for example right now North Korea is a significant threat to us in the fact that they could build, um, -- they do have, ah, nuclear, ah, weapons, but they could, um, very well form a coalition with some other countries and impede the ability for us to, um, control the level to which they develop those weapons.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Something like that.
L:  I feel there's countries in the Middle East that are still a threat too --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- I mean, al Qaeda just didn't disappear.
R:  That's right.  I think, um, -- I don't think we'll be safe for sev- maybe several generations on, on the subject of terrorism because terrorists are pretty much, um, -- my self definition they're lawless, and so any hopes of reaching any kind of agreement on behavior are pretty well, ah, out of the question.
L:  Yeah.  But there are countries that, that they are -- you know, terrorists are operating in, I'm sure.
R:  They are --
L:  You know.
R:  -- operating probably in cells all across the world, and the question is, ah, can we -- we're gonna have to be forced to stay on the defensive and stay -- maintain surveillance and tie up a lot of our resources to intercept potential plans.  I can't imagine that that would be, um, over with for, you know, --
L:  Many --
R:  -- the foreseeable future of my lifetime, anyway.
L:  Yes, I guess I agree with that.  
R:  If, ah, --
L:  Um, --
R:  -- if for example their main con- their main, ah, hostility is directed toward capitalism, Christian countries that practice capitalism, I don't, ah, think that they will be out of business for generations.
L:  No, no.
R:  Unless they can -- ah, I don't -- I don't see the two points of view as ever reaching compromise.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I think to -- I guess to the extent that if anyone looks at, um, the history of the world, I don't see that there have been times of peace for any significant amount of time, and perhaps the most serious problem now is that we're so interwebbed globally we have, ah, so much global travel that one pocket is -- of problem is really everybody's problem, and each culture will kind of get in the face of every other culture sooner or later.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I, um, -- in terms of foreign relations, I think -- I guess I could predict or foresee eventually, way down in the future some -- some day that we will all be so interwebbed economically that the -- the people would eventually be forced to find, ah, -- and also as far as the ecology and so forth, the environment, that people will be much more forced to, ah, work together.  Um, at the moment I'm teaching ESL, which -- so that I [NOISE] have students from all the -- all -- all around the globe in my classrooms, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- clearly some of them are here as refugees and seeking refuge from warfare in their own countries, and then others are here just to benefit from the American dream, maybe take back the education to their own countries, and, um, so forth and so on.  So I -- as, as more and more, ah, people per- I guess it pertains the most to the issue about terrorism as more and more people from countries, for example in the Middle East that have, um, hostility to American ideas and, and religion as they -- as they gain --
L:  I was gonna say it's the religion thing.  You know, the, the holy war idea is what scares me, you know, --
R:  Of course it scares -- yeah.  You're right, of course.
L:  That [SIGH] they're doing this and -- you know, that they honestly believe that this is what has to happen.
R:  I think also the fact is that they don't think this is the last life and therefore they are glad to be -- some of them are willing, quite willing to be martyrs to attain a better status in the next world.  So that any time that human life is relatively expendable, we lose our leverage 'cause we don't feel that way.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So that's a value clash, and, um, I don't know, there are other countries about which we know very little, for example Libya, and some other -- that are just so totally enclosed, that are so involved only in their own processes and are so repressed that --
L:  Well, those countries are just so poor, I don't -- aren't they?
R:  The people are poor there.  There's usually, ah, somebody who has a lot of power and a lot of oil or some such thing --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- going on, and wants to hold on to that.  So yes, Libya, I don't -- for example, I just don't ever have Libyan students.  They don't get out of their country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The, ah, a lot of the African countries have what's called a, um, cultural diversity lottery, so many people want to come to western countries to study.  US is one of them, but many go to Europe, for example.  And, um, so there's a drawing.  And if you win the diversity or cultural lottery, then you are -- get to come and often to bring your family, ah, to study here.  As long as people in those countries are actively involved with the United States, I think, even though there is terrorism in them, for example Ethiopia, Kenya, um, [LIPSMACK] Sudan, so forth and so on, I think we have a much better chance of, ah, reaching some kind of, um, live and let live situation.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The ones -- so the ones -- in other words the ones that really scare me are the ones where we have not much interface at all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, Syria might be one of those, and um, -- now Iraq was certainly one, ah, as we saw with Afghanistan.  Afghanistan is now much more open to the world, and hopefully Iraq will become, and Iran has got a very repressive current, ah, leadership, and many of -- many of my students are escaping Iran, especially students of the Baha'i faith.  Because they're not allowed to go to the regular universities anymore.  So if they want a reasonable, ah, professional life they have to start looking at ways to get out of the country.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, I guess -- and then of course we've also had some of the Croatian and, um, Bosnian refugees too, and we hear pretty horrible things about religious persecution there, and we -- the United States has been of only -- you know, only is so effective and then no more so in getting some of that resolved, as well as the United Nations.  So -- but it has become our business.  We --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we try to get in and stop a lot of this ethnic cruelty where we know about it and where we can, through the United Nations, I suppose.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I see the United Nation -- the United Nations is ideally, in my opinion, the way to make things work.  I'm not entirely in agreement --
L:  So why would they -- okay, in this, why weren't they backing us in this conflict?
R:  Well, I guess because some of the -- their constituent countries did not believe in it.  The United States has one opinion, but we're one of many many many opinions.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And many were, were much more willing to see the process work through the United Nations and continue to put pressure for more inspections.  And, you know, I'm not about -- I'm not able to say right or wrong, but it's turning out to be very difficult to say that there were mass -- weapons of mass destruction because our troops have not been able to find them.  So, you know, in other words the United States took it upon itself to settle this thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Once and for all.  And there are those --
L:  But they have found -- now the just, just found -- some scientist showed them where -- a place where they could make chemical weapons.  You know --
R:  Right.  But they did not find any.  In other words --
L:  No.
R:  -- we have not found huge stockpiles.  It's possible that the regime destroyed what they had, but they have not found in any -- I'm just reading on MSNBC News today that, you know, the -- our intelligence had named five particular sites, or five -- there were some very specific sites, and none of them yielded anything so far.  
L:  Mm.
R:  So it's becoming a new international issue, that, ah, what were we going
