L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, my name's Dianne, mm.
L:  Hi, I'm Gene.
R:  [LAUGH] It's nice to meet you, Gene -- 
L:  Nice -- 
R:  -- well, this is a -- 
L:  -- to meet you too.
R:  -- huge topic, I [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, I'm not sure about their initial question, but I have very good opinions on foreign relations and the whole Bush administration.
R:  Well, it's, ah, -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- a huge topic because you know -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- foreign relations are so important, I mean, with --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the world so small now -- 
L:  Exactly.  
R:  -- you know, or so to speak, you know -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and -- and the chances of the war -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- increasing every day with all the terrorism, you know, it's, ah, really, [LIPSMACK] difficult thing, you know, to deal with all these different countries -- 
L:  It is -- 
R:  -- especially the way even European countries, not just the Arab world looks at us -- 
L:  But that is part -- 
R:  -- it makes it very difficult. 
L:  -- of what concerns me so much right now about the current administration is I feel like he's alienated so much of the international community.
R:  Well, and at the same time, um, I feel like after we actually -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- went into Iraq, which is, you know, I had -- I wasn't -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- totally against, but I wasn't totally for -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- I -- I think some of that has been -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, explained -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- as far as why France and Russia were so against us going in -- 
L:  Yes. 
R:  -- you know, because there was support on their part that never should have been there -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- and it -- it makes me sad that the United Nations can't be a more effective body than it is, but -- 
L:  That's true.
R:  -- there -- there's just so much politics in it that [MN] it can't do the job that it was set up to do, that's how I feel -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- because countries are going to vote the way that benefits them, not t- what benefits -- what is best for the world, or the world economy. 
L:  True -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- but that's the same way America centered -- 
R:  Oh, yes -- 
L:  -- in the whole situation.
R:  Yes, and -- and -- and that's what politics is -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Yes, exactly.  
R:  [LAUGH] It turns me off big time -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- a lot of times because of that, you know, --
L:  Exactly.  
R:  -- ah, you know, a politician votes for what's best for just his state, or what's best for him -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to get voted in again, not what's best for the country or the state as a whole.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And it's very frustrating and -- and that all carries over then into the foreign politics, um, I -- 
L:  But it particularly concerns me now because I feel, like, over the past decade international relations have been improving and -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- with various coalitions for peace building in the Middle East some of those are working much better -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, and then I feel like now with the current administration they're sort of alienating -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- people who had become allies as -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a sort of essentially tearing down some progress that had been made. [NOISE] 
R:  I -- I think there had been progress made and yet at the same time I also feel that because of the building -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- threat of international terrorism -- 
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]  
R:  -- that people -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- were side stepping that issue to avoid -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, to avoid confrontation -- 
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and how long can you let that go after September eleventh, you know, that's where my ambiguity came in when President Bush decided to go to war.
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I -- I wasn't -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- totally for it, but at the same time I felt that nothing would ever be accomplished -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- diplomatically through foreign relations because those countries simply -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- aren't truthful, won't change, won't -- you know -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- won't follow the -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [MN] after the last Gulf wars the sanctions that were put on them -- 
L:  Right.  
R:  -- they were just going in a round about way getting around that -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- now, look at North Korea, you know, [NOISE] obviously -- 
L:  [NOISE] Oh, that's, yeah, a terrifying situation -- 
R:  Yes.  
L:  -- that's building and been ignored to a certain extent.
R:  Well, and I think it's being ignored at this point because how much more thin can we spread ourselves?  That's my feeling -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think that had that cropped up before the whole Iraqi thing that much more pressure would have been put on North Korea than is right now -- 
L:  Right.  
R:  -- because you can't deal with too many apples -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- at the same time without emptying the apple cart, you know, it -- it is scary, it really is scary, um, [LIPSMACK] -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [MN] there's no good answers, I don't -- 
L:  No.  
R:  -- think and I'm -- I'm not going to s- just tear the Bush administration down because it's not an easy thing for any -- 
L:  No, it isn't -- 
R:  -- administration -- 
L:  -- and at least he is taking a stand -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- which is a recognizable stand, unusual for politicians.
R:  Yes, very unusual -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and I do admire that, but at the same time -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- okay, here's a -- here's another problem, ah, let's see they ask us to say who do we think, the, ah -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the, ah, countries are who are a threat right now -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, well, what about Syria?  They may not be a direct threat to us -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but because of our threats to them, we're further alienating the -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- Arab world -- 
L:  Absolutely.  
R:  -- and here we go again, and is that going to increase terrorism rather than calm it down -- 
L:  -- well, it's  -- 
R:  -- it's really -- 
L:  -- actually a question of terrorism because it's -- terrorism has been around, you know, [NOISE] for [NOISE] -- for -- far more than decades -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- but serious terrorism for well over a decade it's just that it finally hit America -- 
R:  It's finally hitting us, exactly, mhm.
L:  Um, -- 
R:  And -- and why were we not willing to do more earlier before it hit us, you know?
L:  Right. 
R:  Ah, for instance, supporting Iraq in the Iran Iraq war, we hardly have our hands clean in this whole mess -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Yes -- 
R:  -- so, yeah, ah, [SIGH] I -- I do think that Colin Powell is doing quite a good job -- 
L:  I think he's doing -- 
R:  -- he's a very good diplomat -- 
L:  -- an admirable job.  Yes, and -- 
R:  -- but -- 
L:  -- and -- and he is very sensitive to the long term implications --  
R:  Yes, I agree with that, I think so -- 
L:  -- in a way I -- 
R:  -- too.
L:  -- really respect him for.
R:  So, I think we have that going for us -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but I, as far as what countries are particularly a threat to us, I can't say that I feel other than a terrorist act that any are -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- what you would really call a threat -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- because no one can stand up to our military might, so, I'm not sure what they meant by that question, you know, -- 
L:  [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  -- what countries do you feel that are a threat to us, --
L:  Right, but there's -- 
R:  -- other than -- 
L:  -- also it's the question of is it the country that's a threat or is there individuals within the country?  
R:  Yes, that's more -- 
L:  Because that's part of the issue -- 
R:  -- to the point -- 
L:  -- of terrorism.
R:  Yes, exactly.
L:  Is it's not necessarily a national policy.
R:  Yes.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, -- 
R:  And -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I mean even in Iraq, I mean it's -- it's going to be a mess for a long time -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- because you have so many factions who have never had any freedom and now are all going to be fighting against each other rather than trying to unite -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- because of their different view points and religious view points [SIGH] yeah, oh, I don't know when we'll ever get out of there, but at the same time when you see so much that was uncovered of what -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the regime was like and how it terrorized everyone, you know -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- it -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it needed to be brought down and yet -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- was that our responsibility to do that -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- you know -- 
L:  [MN] And that's what concerns me if we do it in Iraq now -- 
R:  Then what -- 
L:  -- what's next -- 
R:  -- who's next -- 
L:  -- Exactly.
R:  Ahah, I -- where does it stop -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- if you can't -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- do anything diplomatically and -- and that brings -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- me back to the United Nations -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they just can't seem to be effective -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in the role that they're supposed to play because of the politics -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of the whole thing.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  So, what's the answer?  I certainly don't know, you know, I -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I -- I -- really -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- politics in general really discouraged me -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and made me angry at times and then when you say -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- foreign policy, its -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- even more difficult, of course -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because -- 
L:  Because there's so many -- 
R:  -- I mean even the European -- 
L:  -- extra issues they get -- 
R:  -- nations are looking at us now like big -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- bullies -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And -- and -- and I don't -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that they -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- necessarily didn't before -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they were just -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- quieter -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- about it, but -- 
L:  Well, right, they didn't have such a concrete example.
R:  Yes, exactly.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So, [SIGH] -- 
L:  [NOISE] But partly I feel like in America [NOISE] it also [NOISE] harkens back to our [NOISE] initial, um, [NOISE] our initial founding [NOISE] when we were, you know, debating whether we were going [NOISE] to be an isolationist or [NOISE] an international country -- 
R:  Yeah.  But, see -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you can't be an -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- isolationist country -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- anymore, that's im- --
L:  No, -- 
L:  -- possible -- 
L:  -- I don't think you can, but that's where's -- 
R:  Yeah --  
L:  -- I feel like we're currently heading towards since we're alienating so much [NOISE] of the international community. [NOISE] 
R:  I -- I guess part of that -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- will depend on what they actually found out that Iraq had in the -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- way of weapons -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of mass destruction, or -- 
L:  Which so far has since surprisingly little. [NOISE] 
R:  Well, and that's understandable also because the one, um, [LIPSMACK] guy that they just captured that was involved in the chemical weapons program, I just heard -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- yesterday had pointed out four sites where they worked on those and said -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- "That only one week before the war, many of the sites and --" 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the chemicals were destroyed -- 
L:  Ahah [NOISE] 
R:  -- some were -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- sent to Syria -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- some were -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- buried" -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so, it's -- it's not like you're going to walk -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in and say, "Oh, --" 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- here's the -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- chemical laboratory" -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's not -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- gonna be -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that easy -- 
L:  [NOISE] Right, they've b- been hiding them. 
R:  -- that part doesn't surprise -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- me, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but, it -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- does -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- keep the world looking at us, as -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you said -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- wanted to -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- go -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in here because of the -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- terrorists -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- right, and the chemical weapons threat, now where -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- is it, you know -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and that's part, I think -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of what is alienating -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and like you said, "Making us appear --" 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like an is-
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-lationist nation again" -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It -- it's, ah, it's just -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- sad, you know -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I just -- it -- it's like lately I have the news on a lot and yet I don't wanna watch it, but -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I can't help but watch it [LAUGH], you know?
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] And I -- it's -- I believe I hear, ah, ah, a little one in the background at your house -- 
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  -- so, if you have a small one at home -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I'm sure you're it -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- particularly worried, you know -- 
L:  It does me very -- 
R:  -- What are -- 
L:  -- nervous.
R:  -- kids going to grow up, what kind -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of a world will it be, you know -- 
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] and -- 
L:  I have relatives who are fighting th--
