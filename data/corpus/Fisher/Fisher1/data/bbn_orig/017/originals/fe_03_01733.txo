L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name is Carol.
R:  Uh, my name is Wilson.
L:  Say again, please?
R:  Wilson.
L:  Wilson?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, what do you think of the topic, Wilson?
R:  Interesting, because since I am a foreigner and, uh, everything I don't know much but what do you think yourself?
L:  Well, where are you from?
R:  I'm from Haiti.
L:  From Haiti?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I understand.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.  Um, well what did -- do you think of the US intervention -- well, we should stay on this particular topic.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I worked for the US Foreign Service overseas --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, many years ago --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and terrorism was a problem --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then twenty five years ago.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it wasn't until nine eleven --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that it came here to the States.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I was, um, personally involved in the air crash of Pan Am one oh three where I think more than three hundred people were killed.
R:  Oh, you did, yeah.
L:  Yes, and I think that they traced that back down to Libya.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Was one of them.
R:  Yes.
L:  Uh, and now we're hearing again more about Libya, uh, in terms of Muammar Gaddafi's visit to Egypt --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that was about nine months ago or so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, uh, then -- now the Cole has -- the attack on the Cole had been traced to men in Yemen --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- and yet they escaped not too long ago.  Ten of them.
R:  Yes, I know that.  Yeah.  But I think they've been captured, uh, a few of them or all of them, didn't they?
L:  Oh, really.  I didn't -- I'm not aware.
R:  Yeah, I think they --
L:  I'm not aware of that.
R:  Yeah, they've been captured, I think.  I think especially the main person.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I think he's -- he's been captured and --
L:  Yes.
R:  I think he's the -- oh, as a matter of fact, if I read whatever I read from the newspapers, I think, uh, he's -- he admitted, you know, that he did what he did and he was helping for probably the authorities to see if they can probably, uh, get in -- you know, get to the other people who were like responsible for these things, but I am not sure.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Don't quote me exactly on that but I think, you know --
L:  Well, I'll look in the newspaper again and see if I can catch more about that.
R:  Yeah, I think, uh, I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he's been captured, yeah.  Well --
L:  Well, one of the things in working for the State Department that I'm aware of is --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- oh, I guess for the past five years or so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- many of our embassies have been semi evacuated --
R:  Yeah.
L:   -- almost every year for the past five because of anti American sentiment and perhaps danger to the wives or spouses and children --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- who have accompanied the officers over there.  And that's really an indication of how the, um, attacks against the US have been escalating in recent years.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The thing that disturbs me is --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [COUGH] after the fall of the Berlin Wall --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the intelligence agencies, the American intelligence agencies, were really not funded --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so that a lot of our intelligence is not as good currently as it should be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, uh, although many European countries are co-operating --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and notably Spain, because of the problem with the Basques that they have in Spain --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I should say even more notably, Britain, because of their problems with the IRA.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but Italy also because of their terrorist groups that were kidnapping, uh, well known and -- and -- and very wealthy people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, uh, yeah, so -- I mean, this has been in Europe for a long time, for a variety of political reasons --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so a lot of countries have joined with the US because it's like the old piracy which, of course, Haiti would be, because you were surrounded by water, would be more [COUGH] prevalent, and the idea is that the world then wouldn't allow the pirates to land any place.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's -- it's sort of like we have to get the world together to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- say terrorism cannot be tolerated.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I can understand though what you portray.  Let's see if I understand you correctly so you are for the invasion, right?
L:  I'm not sure.  I'm truly --
R:  You're not sure?
L:  -- not sure.  I don't know what I would do --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if I were the President of the United States.  I truly don't know.  Um, I -- I don't know the extent of the intelligence --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in terms of imminent attacks.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Certainly, we're finding out more of a relationship with the terrorists in Iraq --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than we were aware of.
R:  Well --
L:  We haven't found the weapons of mass destruction.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and I don't know whether or not they moved to Syria which is possible, or to Libya --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or maybe they're yet to be discovered.  Uh, I really do believe that --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- they just wouldn't be in a place where, um, the danger could escape by accident.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I really do think [COUGH] that they will be difficult to find.  I really do believe that they are there given, um, the problem in France with the Rycin[?] that was found in the bus station --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the arrests of people who were, um, trying to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, attack the, um, subways in Britain.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, it -- it -- it's a terrible problem and one of the root causes, of course, is the Israeli Palestine conflict.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And truly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- until we settle that because literally in nineteen forty one, the British, with the Americans --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- took Palestine away from the Palestinians and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- gave it to the Israelis and in -- and until that's questioned ... One of the things that I will admit is like the Arabists, the people who are pro Arab in the State Department, years ago, warned the United States --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that we were becoming too pro Israel --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that the Arab nations had to be considered in our foreign policy and we didn't do that and we are now paying the price for that.
R:  Yeah, the problem is myself, I don't know how you say you're not sure.  I am not sure either if -- I don't say that, uh, Saddam Hussein and Iraq, you know, they were not a danger to America or to the world --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but the point is, like I said, I think we have, uh, other countries that are considered, to me, you know, in my own opinion, more dangerous than they were because since we already had an eye on them, and they know we were watching them, so that's when I would think it would easier for them to keep an eye on him the way it is and then don't, you know, spread ourselves too thin.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Because --
L:  I understand.
R:  Yeah, when you picture that --
L:  I understand -- I understand that thinking and that's part of my thinking as well --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- but I know that the political will here --
R:  Yeah
L:  -- even after nine eleven --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and even after getting the average American to consider --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- terrorism because many of my friends just were not -- were not accepting the fact --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that terrorism is a fact of life in the US -- in the US --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and they wouldn't accept that.  They didn't want to think about it.  Uh, nine eleven was an aberration.
R:  Mm.
L:  It was more drastic than was planned, um, and they just didn't want to deal with it or allow Congress to spend the money to deal with it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I really do think the President then, because we couldn't find Bin Laden, put a face on it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to get the American public to deal with the issue and to allow the government to deal with the issue of terrorism.
R:  Mm.
L:  Because many people out in Iowa or North Dakota, whatever, were not ...
