R:  Colonza Lee.
L:  Hi, my name is Jenny Connolly. 
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, um, --
R:  Hi.
L:  Do you want to start?
R:  Yeah, the topic of the day, I couldn't understand what she was saying the topic was.
L:  It's, it's foreign relations and whether or not you think, ah, another country is a threat.
R:  [inaudible] Yeah, that's what I thought.  Whoa, would you like to go first?
L:  Um, no, why don't you go first?
R:  Okay.  Well, I, yeah, I think Iraq is a threat to the United States, because they have all of those chemical weapons and stuff over there, and they -- they're really a threat right now. [NOISE]
L:  You're con- -- you're concerned about the chemical weapons?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is there anything else that bothers you?
R:  Um, yeah, the fact that -- how they treat their people in their country, when -- like, we're over there right now.  So we don't know exactly what to expect. [NOISE]
L:  Are there any other countries that bother -- that you're concerned about at the present time?
R:  Well, [NOISE] that's the main one [LAUGH] but maybe, yeah, that one's the main one right now.
L:  Okay.  Um, --
R:  [MN]
L:  Yes?
R:  Hello?
L:  Yeah, um, --
R:  What about yourself?
L:  I guess I'm [MN] -- I'm probably more concerned about North Korea and what they're going to do with their nuclear weapons.  Um, I --
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  -- I don't, I don't follow what's going on very of- um, a whole lot, but I do know that there's been some concern about whether or not, um, -- it sounds like they're starting to activate their nuclear weapons stores, and to start to produce --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- nuclear weapons.  Um, and that's of a concern to me.  I guess I'm not so concerned about Iraq anymore since we've gone in and supposedly eliminated Saddam Hussein, but, um, I don't know.  The -- from what I've read, you're correct, that they -- it doesn't seem like they treat their people well, especially the women.  Um, and there are -- I don't know.  The stores of, of chemical weapons, um, I guess I'm actually more concerned about the damage they're inflicting to the national treasures and, and all the looting and pillaging that's been going on.
R:  Yeah.  I've heard about Korea too, but I didn't think it set -- you know, I didn't really pay attention really about it.
L:  No, it seems like everyone's been focusing on Iraq.
R:  Yeah, right.  Yeah, but I would hate, you know, if they were to open those stores, what would happen.  That's a big concern.  We should be having [NOISE] instead of this Iraq business, if they have done away with Saddam or whatever they have done.
L:  Mhm.  Or they can't find him, anyway.
R:  Yeah.  Like they can't find bin Laden, so I don't know about that. [SIGH]
L:  Um, are you concerned, do you think, because our troops are still over there, or --
R:  Yes.  Yeah, people are dying every day over there, and I don't -- you know, casualties are one thing, but being -- some people were saying that it might be like a eight year war.
L:  Eight --
R:  And I just -- eight years.
L:  Oh my heavens, I didn't realize that.  I thought it was close to ending.
R:  No.  They say that it will go on.
L:  Who are they fighting with right now?
R:  I, I don't know, but one of my friends that was in the army, he told me that he could gone for up to eight years, it's gonna be, like, a long, long term war. [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] That's really -- that's depressing and it's also frightening for anyone who's in the service.
R:  Right.  You know, once the front lines are -- the plan [NOISE] is then other people have to go to the front lines, and they could be killed, and yeah.  It's a lot of casualties.  A lot of people dying.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm from Mississippi, so we had some people from Mississippi to die.
L:  You have. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I'm sorry to hear that.  Was there anyone that you --
R:  No, it wasn't anyone that I knew personally, but you know, the local news, it's expressed thoughts and feelings and had services and stuff for them.
L:  Mhm.  Um, do you think that having the services -- does that help you?  I mean, how do you -- do you worry about this daily, is it something that concerns you?
R:  No, I don't worry about it daily because I believe that, um, God has it planned out for us in the end, I mean, you know, I can't worry about it daily because I know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a couple of people that are over there, and so I -- I think about it often --
L:  You do.
R:  Yeah.  Like, all the people that are still over there in Iraq, [NOISE] I hope they're okay.
L:  Yeah.  You, you do, that's --
R:  The thing I think about is if the nuclear bombs were to come over here, what would happen to us?
L:  It, it's almost frightening to think about.  It's almost too much to -- more than you can think about.
R:  [COUGH] [NOISE] Right.  So, it's really kinda depressing, in a way.
L:  Are there any other countries that you can think of besides Iraq and North Korea?
R:  No, not really.  The people that's sided with Iraq, there was a list of them, and I can't even remember who they were.  Like I said I don't pay attention to that part of it, really.  I just try to see if everyone's okay.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, it's kind of interesting to me that, you know, it's been, I don't know, it's been a couple of months and all of a sudden no one's worrying about Afghanistan and, um, the leader there any more.
R:  Right.  Right, like they didn't just come over here and destroy people's lives and didn't destroy buildings and cause a lot of people to die, and they're not even worried about bin Laden anymore, they're just worried about the dollar.  Like, if he's still out there, bin Laden's still out there, nine eleven still happened, you know.
L:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't know why they don't worry about bin Laden and his followers, because I would think that, uh, unless he's been -- unless he's been found and arrested, people are going to be, you know, his followers are going to be out there planning revenge on us.
R:  Yeah.  That's what I was saying.  That kinda bothers me.  What if something else happened like that, [several inaudible words] could this country handle it.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  It's really sad, what happened.  [NOISE] I didn't know anyone that was up there, and I wish they could come around and pay more attention, like, how can you go off and get -- try to capture another country when one country is still, you know, they still doing what they doing in Afghanistan.  They still, ah, you know, alive and well over there even though they killed, killed us.
L:  Yeah.  It's kind of interesting that we only seem to be attacking one --
R:  One country.
L:  -- country at a time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know if that's because, um, the government doesn't feel that we can manage more, or they feel that only deal with the main threat at one time.  It -- I don't understand, since they've got all these other countries that they've identi- or there's several other countries that they've identified, why they're going ahead and they're -- they're just focusing on one country at a time.  If -- maybe they're -- there are underground groups that are going and working, maybe they're doing negotiations in North Korea and hoping that that will work out, and maybe they're doing, um, the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- maybe they've still got armed forces in Afghanistan looking for bin Laden, but they're not telling us about it anymore.
R:  I hope so.  'Cause I'm, like, what if we're over there in Iraq, all of our troops are over there in Iraq, and, you know, something else like -- not as tragic as nine eleven happens to us, something else happens like that. [NOISE] We will -- what will you do then?  I mean, we were after bin- I mean, we were after Saddam, so what if bin Laden attacks again.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or makes another threat, what are we to do then.
L:  [MN]
R:  That's what I'm kinda afraid of, if something else was to happen like nine eleven or ...
L:  Are you concerned that it might happen near you, or that someone you know might be involved, or --
R:  Sometimes, yeah.  I am kinda -cerned -- concerned, yeah, 'cause we have this station in Vesberg that makes missiles.
L:  Okay.
R:  So it's a real possible, you know, place, you know, that terrorists is trying to attack, they attack places that, you know, they feel that have a threat to them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's a place that makes missiles, so they might attack that, and if they attack there, who knows who might get hurt.  Who could be hurt in Mississippi.
L:  Yeah, that wouldn't be good.  Um, ... I don't know, we still need to keep talking, I guess.
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  What happened to you after nine eleven?  Did -- did it change
