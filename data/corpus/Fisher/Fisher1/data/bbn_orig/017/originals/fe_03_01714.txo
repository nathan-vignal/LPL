R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Yes. [LAUGH] 
L:  Hi, um, my name is Jane McDonald. 
R:  Um, Susan Vulcan. 
L:  Oh, okay [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] yo- are you here in the States?
L:  Yeah, huh-uh. 
R:  Okay -- 
L:  I'm a d-- 
R:  I couldn't hear the whole part of the co- topic we're supposed to talk about?
L:  Oh, it's, ah, the topic was what, um, countries, if any, do you consider a threat to the United States?
R:  Ahah. 
L:  And the minute they said that I just drew a blank [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I think we're pretty strong -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's why --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- you know, th- there's always threats of, you know, what happened at nine -- nine eleven -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- you know, is a scary thing -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- like that.
L:  I guess maybe North Korea, you know, if they get [NOISE] really hot and bothered but -- or China, but, ah -- 
R:  And they're a lot closer. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm started to still thinking the Mid East -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is still -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  The hot bed -- 
L:  Yeh --
R:  -- but, ah, [MN] -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  And o- [MN] for the first, you know -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [MN] it's Syria, um, I think we don't have to worry about Egypt any more but, oh, even though they're a threat, I think it's more an individual -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:   -- threat, I can't see that they can take us over [MN] -- 
L:  Yeah, I think it's the terrorist groups would -- that, you know, might be harbored within 'em, I don't think that it's necessarily the countries themselves, but I don't know, you know, what some of these -- some of these dictators in the Middle East how -- how, you know, how much they're actually sponsoring the groups or just letting them be, you know, so.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN]  
R:  Um, where were you when nine eleven [MN] happened?
L:  [SIGH] um, I was, ah, I was in my office, um, [LIPSMACK], I'm -- and I'm in Southern New Jersey, so, we weren't very far away, um, from it and, ah, where were you?
R:  Well, I used t- well, I live in New York, so, I kinda know where you are, but I'm -- I'm in Florida now, but the scariest thing for me was I wa- my first big trip and I was in, um, [LIPSMACK], Australia --
L:  Oh, wow.  
R:  -- when it happened.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And, um, I -- I couldn't believe it, but I -- I knew f- at that moment was survivor panic was like -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- because I knew I was safe -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- all my family and friends are here. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So it really was a scary, you know, an un- uncomfortable feeling. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  You know, no- no- [inaudible] too safe and I gotta hold of all my kids and everyone and I knew they were all safe, but somehow it's -- it's a really eerie feeling. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to not kno- to know it's coming back home but not really know.
L:  Mhm.  Did you have trouble getting a flight home?
R:  No, they thought we would but we were actually the first flight allowed i- the first international flight allowed back in.
L:  [MN] 
R:  You know, lots -- under a lot of security.
L:  Mhm, [MN] 
R:  I guess tha- that would happen if we went to any of the other, ah, countries. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I had a -- a friend I went to college with who, um, [LIPSMACK], she's, ah, um, [LIPSMACK], a little person, you know, like, she's a midget. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And, um, she, um, works -- she's an actuary for, ah, insurance company that was in one of the -- that had -- had its headquarters in one of the towers and, um, [MN] and [NOISE] she's, um, she's maybe [NOISE] I don't know, three feet tall in high heels. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so she has a terrible time getting around and, um, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK], and she -- and sh-, um, when they evacuated the building everybody was, like, "Where is she?", you know [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Right, yeah.  
L:  -- but, [MN], um, her -- her subway was late that day, so [LAUGH] she wasn't even there -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- so, but -- but that was just scary, you know, thinking about people that are handicapped [NOISE] or couldn't, you know, even -- couldn't even get out of the building even if -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, they were on a safe floor, but it was just really wild and she tells the story about, you know, her friends and -- and, ah, people that she worked with, ah, just, you know -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- being in the building when it happened, but -- 
R:  [MN] and that's -- that's al- always the other thing too -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- there were so many more that could have been hurt -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- that weren't.
L:  Yeah, I mean -- 
R:  And you -- 
L:  -- it was really -- 
R:  -- always wonder why -- 
L:  -- fortunate -- 
R:  -- you know, and -- 
L:  Yeah, they said that -- 
R:  -- and what their reasoning is.
L:  [MN] yeah, I mean I just think we were just blessed, you know -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- that it wasn't worse than it -- it, you know, than it was, [NOISE] but, [LIPSMACK] ... 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- so [NOISE] 
R:  You know, for those other countries, like, coming in attacking us, you know, [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I'm not -- not there. 
L:  Yeah, I know, I'm -- 
R:  But maybe I'm just -- I'm the perpetual optimist though. 
L:  Yeah.  Well, I'm a -- yeah, I -- I mean, I just, you know, worry about all these different, um, terror groups, you know, and that -- 
R:  Yeah, because they're not sane.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  You know, and it's just like -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- with the people who are [MN] murderers who, you know -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- if th- who get off and when they're considered mentally incompetent -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that -- that for me is somehow is -- is wrong too -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because, you know, they were trying to kill somebody, you know, why should you get less of a -- of a -- of a punishment for trying to kill someone than for actually killing someone -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- and just cause you botched the job or something -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] does it mean you should get off lightly -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but ...
L:  So, yeah, I know, I don't think -- I -- I don't think any -- any country would like -- would attack us, they know darn gone well we'd -- we'd [LAUGH] we'd obliterate them -- 
R:  And we do have enough whe- -- 
L:  -- but i- if -- if they -- 
R:  For -- 
L:  -- but I don't think -- I think there are some of these countries that wouldn't think twice about knowing if they got, you know, like a germ warfare or some kind of nuclear device that, you know, would do a dirty bomb that -- that if they could get it to a terrorist group without being, you know, traced to them -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- that they would do it.  I think they would, I mean if they could, but ...
R:  Individuals, right -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- from the coun- -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- from the country?  Yep.
L:  Yeah, but -- 
R:  They know damn well they can't take do-- unless they wanna ha- fight us an- and have us take them over so we could support them.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. 
R:  [LAUGH] Which is [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] or something, you know, the Mouse That Roared type -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- movie -- show, or -- do you remember that or is that bef-
L:  The what?
R:  The Mouse That Roared -- 
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  -- do you remem- -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I went to college too.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] What school did you go to?
L:  Um, I went to, ah, to Rutgers Law School, and I went to, um, [LIPSMACK], Butler University in Indianapolis for under grad, so [SIGH] -- 
R:  Mm. 
L:  But, um, [LIPSMACK], well ...
R:  Well, I guess we can talk about anything right now -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I have a timer on my phone and it looks like we've been on for, like, almost eight minutes now -- 
R:  All right -- 
L:  -- but ...
R:  -- that's okay we can -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Have you always lived in New York?
L:  In what?
R:  No, you didn't always in New York if you went to school in Indianapolis -- 
L:  Yeah, I went to -- I lived in Indianapolis until I, ah, -- 
R:  I don't know anyone who lived dow- down there.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, maybe -- 
L:  What part of New York are you from?
R:  Originally Far Rockaway and then I lived in Catskills. 
L:  Oh, ahah, yeah, -- 
R:  And I went -- 
L:  -- that's beautiful.
R:  -- to Portland[?] and then, ah, Newport[?] I did my masters in Newport, but I live in Florida now.
L:  Where in Florida do you live?
R:  Sarasota. 
L:  Oh, that's gorgeous.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  That's much -- much nicer than living -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- up there.
L:  [LAUGH] You retired well [LAUGH]
R:  You had a really good winter, didn't you?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, very bad [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH] Actually I'm not retired, I'm working -- I'm calling from my cell phone -- 
L:  Oh, [NOISE]
R:  -- um, actually I work at a hotel that's essentially pleasant.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  You know, where your free golf -- 
L:  Mm, [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- and tennis --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and things like that. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It keeps me in my medical, you know, medical, um, wha- insurance [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Wow. 
R:  But all my kids live down here, so -- 
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  -- it suits me.
L:  It's beautiful down there.  
R:  [MN] 
L:  [SIGH] That would be -- I think there or Marco Island would be, ah, where I would want to live in Florida [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, recently it just got rated as number -- the number one place to retire [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Because we do the arts and everything else -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- down here.
L:  So, ...
R:  But have you ever done one of these before?
L:  N-, um, I tried one before and it didn't have a partner for me. 
R:  Oh. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  They -- they probably called me --  
L:  [LAUGH] so, I ended -- 
R:  -- at home.
L:  -- up talking about nine eleven for like thirteen minutes only to find out that they -- their program messed up and that it didn't count [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  My daughter and her son, ah, her husband is doing this, but -- and she told me to do it and, so -- 
L:  How did you find out about it?  Oh, from -- 
R:  Through my daughter -- 
L:  -- them.  Yeah, and is she re-, um, is she involved with the University of Pennsylvania -- 
R:  No, no -- 
L:  -- or how did she know about it?  
R:  -- she just -- actually, she's gone for her PhD down here -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [LAUGH] at the University of South Florida, but her husband was -- was at work at he [LAUGH] just started doing this and them she did it -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and she's someone who talks and she, you know, I guess she gets the mon- money if she gets other people to do it.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Because no -- anyway, they called me at home but obviously I wasn't home and I have this lull time at work so I figured, well, let me do that here.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I hope no one interrupts -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but by now they they should be fine. 
L:  [MN] I put my parents on to this too [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- I -- I guess they pay, I don't know [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, yeah, I mean it's -- I guess it's -- 
R:  University of Pennsylvania is -- 
L:  Yeah, they're -- they're -- 
R:  -- pretty good, yeah.
L:  I think they're solid, I think we're all right [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Because they're listening [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] They expect that I'm sure.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] It doesn't say anything there we shouldn't do that. 
L:  I don't know [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  No, I'm reading, it doesn't [MN]  
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  [NOISE] I mean I guess they're gonna tal- they'll let us know -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- when our ten minutes are up.
L:  Yeah, it looks like it should be up by now. 
R:  And, ah, ...
L:  My -- my timer's, um, like, I just -- on my phone it has, you know, how long the call has -- 
R:  That's right -- 
L:  -- has been.

L:  Yeah, ahah.
R:  Yeah, so, it should? 
L:  Um, [LAUGH] although thankfully I don't have to bill time -- I don't have to bill my hours, so, which is wonderful [LAUGH] 
R:  What kind of attorney?
L:  Ah, bankruptcy.
R:  Oh, [several inaudible words] my ex was in there -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and then, ah, so, I was almost in there [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, having to deal with that, but he's out of that again, so -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- we'll see where that goes.
