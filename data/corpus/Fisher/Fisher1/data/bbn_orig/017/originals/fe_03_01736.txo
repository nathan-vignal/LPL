R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Fieva[?].
R:  Hi.  My name's Dee.
L:  Deed?
R:  Dee.
L:  Okay.
R:  What part of the country are you in?
L:  I'm in Michigan.
R:  I'm in Indiana.
L:  Okay.  I'm near Detroit.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  A little bit north of Detroit.
R:  I'm about sixty miles north of Luvell[?].
L:  Oh.  Okay.  Okay.  So, the topic today is, "Do we feel that any other country is a threat to America?"
R:  Well, I think that's a no brainer.  There's several other countries that are a threat to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to America.
L:  Unfortunately, that's true.
R:  And --
L:  Actually we have North Korea, we have Syria.  What other countries?
R:  Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Iran, China.  China and Japan --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- are encroaching rapidly.
L:  Now, why do you think Saudi Arabia is a threat?
R:  Um, because you get the same mindset.
L:  Okay.
R:  You get the same mindset that you do in Iraq and Iran and -- and -- a -- a lot of the other Middle Eastern countries.  You've got the, um, the religious fervor.
L:  Okay.
R:  That religious fervor scares me.
L:  Basically, the anti western views that they hold?
R:  Well, the -- the anti "anybody except Muslim" views.
L:  Okay.  Okay.
R:  I mean, I --
L:  I've never really -- I've never really noticed that they held those kind of views.
R:  Um, I dated some Saudi Arabians in -- in college and, yeah, they -- they -- they're not as --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- as vocal about it, but yeah, they do.
L:  Okay.
R:  They do [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.
R:  Or at least they did back then --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and I -- I have no reason to think it's changed now, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and, of course, these boys, being in the United States, were from fairly affluent families back there --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- so --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- you know, they were --
L:  I didn't realize that they felt that Muslims were better than all the white -- I guess Christians kind of feel that Christianity is the right way.
R:  Yeah, I think every religion thinks that they're the right way [LAUGH] you know but --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- but very few of them are willing to kill people over it.
L:  And that's true, especially in this time and age.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's -- you know -- and that -- that makes a little -- I think fanaticism in any form is unhealthy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't care what form it is.
L:  Yeah.  I would think that -- the Muslims that I would be worried about in the Middle East would be the fanatics --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because even in the US the Christian fanatics, they go kill those, um, doctors who perform abortions, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, see I would -- yeah, I agree with you.
R:  Yeah.  I -- fanatics scare me.  They're -- they're kind of homegrown loonies, wherever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- home happens to be [LAUGH].
L:  Exactly.  The reason that I'm so worried about, like, um, Syria, North Korea, that's -- it's because the leaders that they have, I don't know exactly whose side they're on.  You know what I'm saying?  Are they really trying to protect their people?  And North Korea just wants us to do something about the fact that they're over there making nuclear weapons --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the fact that they keep enticing us to do something like daring us, I -- I -- that's not safe.  And although I have heard that some of the missiles may be able to reach the far side of California, I don't know that I really believe that, actually, to be true but that's why I'm concerned about those countries.  But I don't think United States should go into another war at this time.
R:  Yeah.  I don't -- I don't think they should either unless we're pushed into it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but the problem is -- now I was a World War Two baby --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and I'm probably a little older than you are, but, um, you know, I -- we won the Korean War and then we've lost everything since then.
L:  Okay.
R:  And that -- that -- you know, I mean, the United States was for many, many, many, many, many years was considered a major political power and -- or military power --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and I don't think they are anymore and I think that's part of the problem.
L:  But who could be better than us?
R:  [NOISE] Well, we've lost [MN] we lost Desert Storm, we lost Vietnam.
L:  Now, I don't know if anyone would admit to losing Desert Storm.
R:  Oh, we did though.  You know we did.
L:  Now, that's the one that was in nineteen ninety one?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Well, Bush --
R:  You know, I mean --
L:  Well, no.  We didn't actually -- wait, Desert Storm is that one where Saddam tried to invade Kuwait and we said, "No, that's not going to happen".
R:  Yeah, kind of.
L:  And supposedly they claimed that our only point was to make sure Saddam did not invade Kuwait and I remember they called that war off kind of early because there was so many fatalities, both American and, uh, the middle eastern people.
R:  Yeah, but we -- we basically lost that.  I mean, we just blew it.
L:  Oh --
R:  They -- they sent helicopters then to the desert to pick up POWs that didn't have sand shields on them and they ended up dumping the people that were going on the rescue mission.  I -- it was just -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it was a mess.  It was a mess, and I mean, the whole world laughed.  The whole world laughed.  Vietnam.  Vietnam carried on -- I mean, that was my -- that my high school and college years --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and that carried on forever.  And then we pulled out and we had not won.  We lost.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  And not only did we lose over there, we lost over here too because when the -- when the returning soldiers came back, they were treated like they were criminals.
L:  I know.
R:  And that made the rest of the world laugh too, and I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think all of that together, was some jealousy, you know.  Um, I mean, let's face it.  We have a higher standard of living than any other country in the world.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but I -- they think we're lazy and weak.
L:  They do.
R:  And in some ways, we are.
L:  They do believe that about us.  My friend and I were just talking about this before this call came through, about the unilateralism that America has and why the rest of the world hates us, and, um, my friend, her mother was, uh, in the military and she was stationed in Germany.  And she said in Germany, they always refer to Americans as, like, uh, Santa Claus.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because we get everything we want.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, and that's how they see, although we don't see ourselves that way [LAUGH].
L:  Right, exactly.  When we're living it we don't see ourselves that way, yeah.
R:  Yeah, but -- but, you know, it [MN] -- I mean, that's -- that's how the rest of the world looks at us.  They look at us as weak.  They look at us as greedy.  Uh, they look at us as lazy because we've got the labor unions that -- that, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, if you're not making eighteen dollars an hour, you don't have to work, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, there's -- there's countries where whole families live on eighteen dollars a week --
L:  Right.  That's true.
R:  -- and you can't blame them for being jealous.  I mean, you really can't, so the -- the whole trick is that you've got to be a strong enough military power that they're not going to mess with you --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- and we're not anymore.
L:  I don't know if I would agr-.  Based on what you said, you do have some valid points but I just think the world still views us as super power, as a military super power.
R:  Well, I'll tell you what --
L:  But I guess that's what the media feeds me.  The media tells me that the world still views the US as a super power and that just could be the media tricking me because I understand about propaganda.
R:  But let me tell you why they don't.  It's because we worry too much about our press.  We worry too much about how something is going to look, so, you know, we -- we -- we bomb Iraq and then we send in billions of dollars worth of supplies and food and people and all this, to fix what we just broke.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, they wouldn't do that here.
L:  Exactly.  If they were --
R:  They would not do that.  If they bombed this country, they would not do that here.
L:  Right.
R:  And nobody in the world would expect 'em to.  We have become very weak in the world's eyes because we want everybody to think we're the good guys and that's where you get into trouble.
L:  We can't even afford to do it.
R:  No, we can't take care of our own.
L:  Tell me, have you heard what they're going to do with that money they found in, um, in Iraq?
R:  I think they're --
L:  Is it four --
R:  -- trying to say it's still not -- they're still not sure it's real.
L:  I figured that issue was gonna come up.
R:  Well, as well hidden as it was, I'm sure it's real and I'm also sure it's gonna disappear somewhere.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I figured that issue was gonna come up.  I figured they were gonna try and say it was counterfeit.
R:  Mhm.  I think they're already working on that [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, yeah, I -- you know, we -- we worry way too much about what the rest of the world thinks about us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I have no problem if the rest of the world thinks that we're jerks because you leave jerks alone because they'll kick your butt, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Um -- [NOISE]
L:  How do you feel about how the President's portraying this country?
R:  Huh?
L:  How do you feel about how the President is portraying the country?  Is he doing a good job of portraying the country or is he, you know, down his tunnel of ...?
R:  He's being a little politically correct for me, too.
L:  Okay.
R:  I mean, you know, it's -- it's -- it's his orders that are sending all this money and all this foreign --
L:  Right.
R:  -- aid over there and I --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know, we send foreign aid to almost every country in the world.
L:  I know.  And we're in debt and our own states are starving, you know what I'm saying?
R:  Yes, I do.
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  We have -- right here, in the county where I live, we have the largest unemployment rate in the state.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  And Indiana has one of the largest unemployment rates in the country, and ...
L:  Tell me this, what is your state, um, deficit this year?  Is it really --
R:  Oh, it's awful.
