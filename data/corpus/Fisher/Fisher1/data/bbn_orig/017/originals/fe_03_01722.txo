R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  [NOISE] Well --
L:  H- --
R:  [LAUGH] Have you had any conversations before?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yes?
L:  Have you?
R:  No.
L:  Okay.  My name is Bridget.
R:  My name is Patty.
L:  Mm-kay.  [SIGH] Essentially, they just want us to talk for about ten minutes on the topic of, uh, foreign relations.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Uh, it -- it's not a big deal. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's kinda stupid, but, uh -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Do we think that the, uh, war was, uh, just?  Anything like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, do you have any opinions on the topic?
R:  Um, [LAUGH] I don't know if it's, well, the topic more generally was foreign relations, but then they said, "Are any other countries a threat?" and, um --
L:  So, either one.  If --
R:  I guess -- okay.
L:  -- uh, [SIGH] if you have a --
R:  Um [NOISE] --
L:  -- opinion either way.
R:  I guess I was not convinced that the war was justified.
L:  Okay.
R:  What about you?
L:  And I -- I thought it was justified.
R:  M- mhm.
L:  So -- but, um, do you feel threatened by any other country because of the war or after the war?
R:  I feel like [SIGH] it will be hard to repair our, um, relationship with the rest of the world after this, that --
L:  I agr- --
R:  -- it will take years to recover, um, cooperation.
L:  Uh, from the countries like Germany, France or --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- in general, everybody?
R:  Yeah, probably in general, everybody, except maybe Tony Blair. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He still seems on our side.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  Although he seems to be taking the hit in his own country for this, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm not so sure it was such a wise move for him.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, Bush doesn't seem to be in big danger, but, uh, Tony sure does.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Seemed to be not very liked at the moment --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- by his --
R:  Are you from Minnesota?
L:  Pardon?
R:  Are you from Minnesota?
L:  Originally, yes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yes.  Oh, how did you guess that?
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] you just sounded that way.
L:  Ah. [LAUGH]  I used to live in Brooklyn Park [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a suburb of Minneapolis.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, [SIGH] yep, uh, for a long time.
R:  In B- --
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I grew up in Indiana.
L:  Okay.
R:  We used to go fishing in Wisconsin and Minnesota, uh --
L:  Mm-kay. I was born in Lafayette --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- Indiana.
R:  So was I. [LAUGH]
L:  In Lafayette?
R:  West Lafayette.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Did you go to West Side?
R:  No, I -- I was in a rural area north of there.  It was just, you know, where the hospital was, it's about forty five miles north of there that I was born, and where my father s- still lives.
L:  Ah, okay.  Oh, [SIGH] so you go back to Lafayette a lot?
R:  Well, not --
L:  Sometimes?
R:  -- Lafayette per se, but I go back to Indiana regularly.
L:  Okay.
R:  My mother died about a year and half ago and so my father is more lonely and --
L:  [LAUGH] Yes.
R:  -- so I try to -- whenever I go somewhere else, I try to, um, make a stop in Chicago and drive down to see him.
L:  Mm, we were just in Lafayette yesterday, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- hasn't changed a whole lot --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- other than it's the, uh, restaurant capital of the world now I think.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  They have more restaurants there than they do anywhere.
R:  Huh.
L:  I -- and I don't understand how they support 'em, but they do.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh.  I've, uh, even having lived in Minneapolis, I -- I would say Lafayette has more restaurants --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- per capita --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than even Minneapolis does.  Seems kinda weird, but -- and it's not the Purdue kids coming over eating, it's just the Lafayette people eating in it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It seems really weird. [LAUGH]
R:  Funny -- funny -- it's funny, 'cause Rensselaer, the town I was, um --
L:  Oh, I went to Saint Joe, Saint --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- Joe College, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Yep, this is a very small world. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It must be.
L:  Uh, did you go to Saint Joe?
R:  No, I didn't.
L:  I- -- no?
R:  Ah, I wanted to not have to go home on weekends. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  Oh.  My husband and I both graduated from Saint Joe.
R:  Oh, that's really interesting.  What years were you there?
L:  Um, I graduated in eighty and he graduated in seventy eight.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, it [SIGH] yeah, i- it got us through, anyway.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's not something I was particularly thrilled with --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but --
R:  Yeah.  Well, there aren't many restaurants there, I remember.
L:  There is nothing in Rensselaer.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Nothing, nothing.
R:  There are hogs. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, although re- recently it's changed a lot, since, uh, even I was there.  There used to be a restaurant on the outside of town that started with -- or not a restaurant, a grocery store and, uh, [SIGH] uh, like a +five and ten cent store, it started with an S, k- -- uh, Schultzers, maybe?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Remember that?
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Oh, [SIGH] yeah, and that's all different now and a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Walmart now and --
R:  Yeah, uh.
L:  -- [SIGH] yeah, that's really very different from what it used to be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, [NOISE] [SIGH] but, uh, Saint Joe was good for us, oh, but it's nice to, uh, [LAUGH] kind of move out of that city though.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I can see why you didn't want to live there forever.  Hello.
R:  Yeah, well, it's a -- as they say, it's a nice place to be from. [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [SIGH] Oh, so did you go to Rensselaer High then?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, okay.  Oh, yeah. [SIGH] Big, big school and that's it.  Uh-huh, oh.  That's really strange.  And now you're in Wisconsin?
R:  No, actually I live in California now.
L:  Ah, okay.  All right, oh.  [SIGH] A small world.  You just never know who you're going run [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- into.
R:  And you lived --
L:  I don't get very many people from Rensselaer at all.  I just, you know, people don't know that city at all, it's kinda weird.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, but it --
R:  And you live where now?
L:  I live -- I'm back in Indiana now. [SIGH] Ah --
R:  In -- in Lafayette, or --
L:  No, Fort Wayne.
R:  Fort Wayne, uh-huh.
L:  Oh, but about, uh, two and half hours from Rensselaer, probably.
R:  Right, right, I had an uncle that lived there for a while.
L:  And Fort Wayne, it's not so bad.
R:  Mm.
L:  It's [SIGH] -- it's an okay place.  It's a pretty good safe place to raise kids, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- yeah.
R:  Well, that's right.  My parents were from South Bend and they moved to Rensselaer because they thought it was a better place for raising kids. [LAUGH]
L:  And they were probably right too.  Oh. [SIGH] South Bend is known to have their troubles, so, uh, and Rensselaer's pretty -- pretty quiet.  So, it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Jeeze, California's a long way away from, uh, Rensselaer, jeepers.
R:  Yeah, it is.  But --
L:  Oh, [LAUGH].
R:  In January, when spring comes [LAUGH] --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I enjoy it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.  You don't get snow out there at all or anything, do you?
R:  Well, in the -- in the Sierras it snows --
L:  Does it?
R:  -- so if you wanna see snow you can drive up to see it.
L:  Mm, oh.
R:  But, um, it really snows here in this part.
L:  [MN] Where you are.
R:  Sometimes --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm in, um, south of San Francisco --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- in Silicone Valley.
L:  All right, oh.  A very long way from home, oh.
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  Oh. [SIGH] Jeeze, when I moved to Minnesota, it was twelve hours from home, but you're further than that. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Oh, a long way to go back and forth [SIGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, but ...
R:  Well, it's probably closer than twelve hours with, um, flying and driving.
L:  Right, right.
R:  The thing is Rensselaer's sort of between Chicago and Indianapolis, so it's a --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it's a drive, no matter where you go.
L:  Right, yeah, anywhere, e- either if you drive into or fly into Chicago or to Indy, you still got a -- --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- heck of a drive.
R:  You got a long drive, and --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- Chicago's a little further, and there's the city traffic, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, but there's more, um, non stops into Chicago, so I usually fly into Chicago.
L:  I would think it would be cheaper, yeah, to go to Chicago than it would be to Indy.
R:  [MN]
L:  Oh.  Although Indy is really trying to keep up with the, uh, pace around here.  They really are trying to get all these -- all the Rensselaer people or Fort Wayne people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- everybody.  They -- they really are trying to get them to drive down there, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] ah, d- -- who wants to drive two hours to fly out and, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  When you drive -- when you fly home, then you ha- -- still have another couple of hours behind you to get back home and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you think, "This is kinda stupid".  Oh.  Fort Wayne has their own airport so [NOISE] it isn't too bad.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, but --
R:  But you probably have to change flights somewhere --
L:  Right.
R:  -- on the plane.
L:  Yeah, anywhere coming into Fort Wayne, yeah, you do.  You have to [SIGH] change several times.  Oh.  Uh, [SIGH] you sure do.  Oh.  Well, this is an interesting [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's better than some of them I've talked to.  Some of them have been, uh, very -- kinda strange, opinionated of, um, [SIGH] I -- I suspect from a foreign country although they --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- didn't say they're not.
R:  Did they have an accent that, uh, didn't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sound --
L:  Yeah, and I -- but I did one this morning, a lady was from India --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and was very definitely, [LAUGH] [SIGH] uh, Iraqi influen- [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, it's kind of weird.  Uh, you don't know what you're [SIGH] -- who you're --
R:  So, have you ever visited a foreign country?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, Germany --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- France.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  And m- my child is actually g- -- leaving next week for, uh, England and Ireland.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, [SIGH] yeah.
R:  How old is --
L:  Uh, nineteen.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, but it seems very safe, what's going doesn't seem to [SIGH] I -- w-  we all went as a family, and now she's going by herself, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I t- trust her and I think that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she's pretty safe going where she's going --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so it's not a big deal, but ...
R:  Yeah.  Of course at nineteen you're fearless --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- if I remember right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You got that right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Nothing can happen, and, "Yeah, I'll be fine, Mom" and [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- yeah, and, "It'll be so cheap".  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, the airplane flight is cheap, but after that it's, uh, well, she's going to stay with friends so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at least it'll be -- but it's still -- she doesn't think the, you know, meals do cost here, uh, [LAUGH] taxis cost, it's not --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like it's, you know, [SIGH] you get off a plane and [SIGH] to cost nothing.
R:  Yeah, everybody takes care of you.
L:  Right, yeah.  See, I don't think she quite sees the whole big picture here, but --
R:  Oh, it'll be good.
L:  -- eventually it'll -- she'll wake up and --
R:  How long is she going to be gone?
L:  Ten days.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, it [LAUGH] will be a long ten days for Mom --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, oh well, you know, you gotta kinda let 'em go sometime I suppose --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but when we went, uh, to Germany it was really safe and I just felt like it was not an issue at all, so
