R:  Hi, Dean Henderson.
L:  Hi, Chrissie.  How are you?
R:  Fine.
L:  So, it's a more interesting topic today, computers and education.
R:  It's an interesting topic for me.
L:  Yes.  Are you a teacher?
R:  [LAUGH] No, but I'm a computer lover.
L:  Me, too [LAUGH].  Me, too, and actually the first computer that we bought, um, my son was in first grade, I didn't even know how to turn one on and I bought it for his education [LAUGH].
R:  What type was it?
L:  A Packard Bell from gum rewards that I paid, like, two thousand dollars for.  It's been quite few years ago [LAUGH].
R:  The first computer I had was an Apple two C.
L:  Do you like Apple? 
R:  Well -- oh, they okay, but when I bought it, I bought it so that my son could use it 'cause I thought that would be easier to teach him how to operate a computer, because at that time the Apple was the only one that had all these educational games like math and spelling.
L:  Yeah.  My brother works for Apple Computers.
R:  Yeah.  The oth- -- well now all the computer, er, companies are getting in on the educational part, but that was it with the Apple at first.
L:  Yeah.  You almost have to have a computer these days if you have kids.
R:  True.  I have four now.
L:  Oh. 
R:  I would have had five, but I gave my Apple away three years ago, and as soon as I gave it away they destroyed it.  I was so angry.
L:  Oh, we only have two.  Do you have a laptop? 
R:  No, I'm praying for that one.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'd like to have one too.
R:  They're expensive.
L:  Yeah, Yeah. 
R:  I have a, er, Hewlett Packard.
L:  That's what I have.
R:  A Acer, um, a Laser and a Compaq.
L:  Ah, -- we had a Compaq.  We have a Hewlett Packard, and a, um, -- my favorite computer.  There was, like, a special deal on the internet several years back, you could get it for free.
R:  Right.
L:  I'm freebie shopper.
R:  A who?  
L:  A free -- a -- I'm a freebie hunter [LAUGH]. 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So am I.  See.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have you tried going on line for some of those free computer courses?
L:  No, but I was just, er, looking at that at Burns and Noble.  Have you checked those out? 
R:  No, that's -- Burns and Noble want you to buy the book.
L:  Oh, they -- do they? 
R:  Yes.
L:  Because I saw that they have free, er, -- 
R:  If you go to Google dotcom and type in free computer training, it will pull up a lot of -- 
L:  Do they have things for, like, teenagers? 
R:  Yes.
L:  How old are your kids? 
R:  Um, too old and too young.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH].  We're recording, so I don't want to give that information.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I've got one fourteen and one seven.
R:  Okay.  But, um, that's where you can find a lot of information on computer training.  I went there myself to try to find something because I went to this, um, school yesterday to apply for computer training.  They want fourteen thousand dollars -- 
L:  Oh, my -- 
R:  -- for, I think he says thirty -- er, wait a minute, sixty weeks of training.
L:  Oh my.
R:  No, fifteen months, well that's almost sixty weeks.  Fifteen months, five days a week, eight hours a day and then you get a certificate, or -- no, an associate. 
L:  To build computers, or --
R:  Well, I want to learn how to repair them, yes.
L:  I've done a lot of that stuff and I've taught myself. 
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  You see, I guess I could, but I need someone to stand over my shoulder and tell me ex- if I screwed up.  That's why I'm hold- -- 
L:  [NOISE] You -- you can't be afraid.  If you're afraid, you won't do it.
R:  I'm afraid.
L:  Yeah, you can't be af- 
R:  I have one computer that I'm holding just for that purpose, so I can take it apart and put it back together.
L:  I did that.  Try it.
R:  Are you on the internet? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are you America on Line? 
L:  No.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE] No, but I'm -- because it's not as complicated as what you think -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and the mother boards aren't as fragile as what people say.  It's not that hard.
R:  Well are there any places that you can recommend on line that I can go to and get instructions -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- free? 
L:  Um, I can't really think of any place.
R:  How about if I give you my we- email address?
L:  Okay, hang on just a minute. [PAUSE] I'm going to get a pen and a piece of paper.  We're probably not supposed to do this.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, they didn't tell us not to.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Perhaps on the second call -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- we'll know -- we'll know better, but this is the call to make all your trial and error [LAUGH] and it is educational.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  What's your address? 
R:  T.I.P.
L:  T.I.P.
R:  The number four -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- the letter U, at L.L. dotcom.
L:  AOL dotcom. 
R:  So if you --
L:  Mine is mail, M.A.I.L., at West Virginia, spelt out, dot net.
R:  [NOISE] M.A.I.L. at West Virginia? 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, spelled out, dot net.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um, it's really easy.  I've done a lot of repair work on friends' computers and stuff, of course and I always do it for free.  Um, but I- it was always kind of a challenge to see if I could get it working, or, you know -- and have you ever done anything like add memory or anything? 
R:  No.  I've seen people do it and I have some memory laying around that I would like to put in, but I guess I'm just at that panic stage which I really do need to get out of it because when I first learned computers I was learning FORTRAN and that put a mental block in my brain, but then I came out of it and just taught myself how to operate the computer, period.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, well you need to not be scared because that's the thing that will hold you back.
R:  Yeah, it's holding too. 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, but just --  but just try it.  I had a old computer that I tore completely apart and put it all back together and I've added and removed, and, um, in fact when I bought this new HP, as soon as I bought it, it didn't have enough RAM in it, so I bought extra RAM and stuck it in.  That's the easiest thing to do.
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] And even adding the hard drive is easy.
R:  Well I have a couple of hard drives around here.
L:  [NOISE] So you're just waiting to do this? 
R:  Yes, I'm just waiting.
L:  [LAUGH] So you need to get over the fear and just try it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is your computer that you want to tear apart old? 
R:  It's a three eight six.
L:  So that's real old.
R:  Yes.
L:  You see, I wouldn't be afraid o- afraid of it.  Do you have a restore disc? 
R:  No.
L:  Maybe you should try to get a hold of the company and get a restore disc and then if you, er, accidentally wipe it all out you can be able to put it right back on.
R:  [MN] Well, I don't -- I'm not afraid of wiping it all out because it's on a separate drive.  I have three hard drives in this computer, on a three eighty six -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that someone else put in, but I want to learn how to go back in and -- and, um, take it out because I think it's educational.
L:  Oh, it is, it is, and it's also easy.  You'll be surprised at how easy it is.  It's just, kind of, plugging things --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- in and unplugging them and -- I mean, you'll be amazed at how easy it is because I never thought I'd -- I mean, like I said, when I bought ours I couldn't even turn it on and then I just started messing with them and I just do all kinds of stuff.
R:  So do your children also know how to, um, work on the computer? 
L:  My son that's fourteen, I'm trying to teach him.
R:  Okay.
L:  We were tearing into his computer a couple of months ago and it's still, er, ah, tore apart and we haven't finished putting it all back together because I was putting a new modem in it and some more RAM and, you know, doing that kind of stuff.
R:  Maybe I just should take it apart and look at it first?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And then try to put each piece back in.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And see what happens with it.
L:  If you could go on the internet and get a map of, like, the mother board and what everything is, that would really help.
R:  Oh, I never thought of that.
L:  You could probably go on the web site and put in your computer -- 
R:  Yes. 
L:   -- model, and, ah, print out, like, a map of everything on the mother board.
R:  I did that before.  A long time ago I printed that out.  Ah, I think it was, like, specs or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I said doy[?], yoy[?], yoy, yoy, yoy [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I didn't know what any of it meant either for a long time and, um, it's really easy.  I mean, you'll be surprised once you --  once you go to do it.  The only problem is, is, um, you know, now with Windows XP -- 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- a lot of the older stuff, like the CD ROMS and modems and stuff doesn't work real well if you put XP on there.
R:  Ri- well, one computer I have came equipped with XP, the other one is ME, the other one is ninety five and my old computer is three poi-
