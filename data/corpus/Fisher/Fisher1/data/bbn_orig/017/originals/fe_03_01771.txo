L:  No.
R:  Hi, well, this is Neil.
L:  Hi, Neil? 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  This is Shannon.
R:  Shannon, how are you doing?
L:  Hi, good, where are you calling from? 
R:  Ah, oh, I'm in -- I'm in Ohio.
L:  Okay, I'm in San Diego.
R:  Oh, how about that, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, so it sounds like they're keeping quite current with the -- with the choice of topics here.
L:  I know.  It's kind of, um, -- I don't know, kind of difficult off the top of my head.  Okay, so you could start.
R:  Well, um, one thing I gotta, ah, say about, you know, nations that pose a threat to the United States, um, all during this -- you know, the -- the -- the whole invasion of Iraq, I -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- was saying, okay, you know, [LAUGH] I'm -- I -- I think this is a bad idea but boy I am hoping that you find something, something really horrendous and horrible there that will convince me that my gosh, you were right all along and they were a threat and, you know, and I'm grateful to you.  You -- you stopped -- you stopped a Hitler in the making and, you know, prevent -- so, ah, I keep hoping they'll find something like that just so I can breathe a sigh of relief and say, "Okay good, it was for a good reason after all" ah, because other than that, I had the opinion that, um, you know, that Iraq didn't -- did not pose a -- a threat to the United States and that, ah, all the other reasons for going there, you know, like the UN sanctions that disobeys, yeah, yeah, we should have done something about that, any time between nineteen ninety one and nineteen ninety eight, um, but right now, you know, it's a bad idea to try picking a fight about it right now.  So that's what I'd say about Iraq.  Now, for other nations I can maybe think of some other stuff about them, but what -- [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  -- does that peak your interest or spark anything for you? 
L:  [LAUGH] No, for -- for Iraq, I don't know if I thought there's ever been a direct threat.  However, I have thought even if, um, ah, Bush and the administration had information that they might have, um, chemical weapons -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or mass destruction weapons.  I'm not sure that Iraq would even target the United States directly because of it being on the other side of the world.  However, I think that they wouldn't have any hesitation to maybe attack Israel or even a European country.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If -- if -- if they wanted to.  Um, however, I think the terrorist group in northern Iraq -- I'm not recalling their name right now. 
R:  Ham- al Hamas, um, is there one?  [LAUGH]
L:  There's a -- there's a -- [LAUGH] 
R:  This isn't the Kurds coming back and reclaiming their territory, is it? 
L:  No, no, no, not the Kurds, but there's a, um, terrorist group in northern Iraq that also has meas-, ah, members in Iran and they have been associated with al Qaeda, um, in some -- they're saying the Ricin cases and maybe even just, um, training, cross training between the al Qaeda and those terrorist groups.
R:  Well, if I -- oh, go ahead.
L:  Oh, so even though Saddam Hussein, he was funding them directly, um, there might be a threat from Iraq to the United States in kind of -- it's kind of direct or in- indirect at the same time.
R:  Well, I agree.  I mean, I, ah, I'm with you there.  I mean, after, ah, you know, September eleventh two thousand and one, of course, when -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah, Bush was saying, you know, "We're going to come get you" and, you know, "If you -- you are a terrorist, if you're harboring a terrorist, we're not going to make a distinction, we're going to get you", I -- you know, I thought okay, right on.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but all during this time, you know, when they -- when they, you know, flipped their, ah, switch and decided that it was now, you know, like false ash and now it's time to start talking about Iraq last year -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, there was this whole -- sort of, you know, pa- parade of reasons why we should do it just like when, you know, his first tax cut.  He said, "Well, we should do it because, um, ah, you know, we need the economic stimulus or, you know, we should do it because we're making so much money that, you know, we should give some back to the people who earned it", but then --" 
L:  Right.
R:  -- when there's a crash, "No, no, well, actually no.  Now, we need it for this reason" and so of all these reasons for invading Iraq, it was only around I think, you know, October or something that they finally said, ah, "Oh, yes, and -- and there is a link to al Qaeda" and that's like, you know, they finally said, "Oh, oh, yeah, yeah".
L:  Right.
R:  If -- if we can convince them of that, they'll buy that, so okay, and magically now there are connections to al Qaeda.  And what I hear, I -- I listen to it and if I hadn't -- if I didn't have all that other baggage with it I would say wow, you're right.   
L:  Right.
R:  But as it is, I say, you know, "If you -- if you -- if you people had just told me that to begin with, maybe I'd buy it but now it just sounds like you're saying that 'cause, you know, that -- that I consider that a good reason and so now I just don't know what to believe you guys are saying any more".  So, ah, ah, if there is indeed an al Qaeda connection, I say, "Okay, go get them", you know, I agree, yes, we know al Qaeda is a threat, um, but you know, what -- what about -- what about Afghanistan that, you know, you stopped talking about and what about, you know, all -- all these other places that it's, you know, if it's really al Qaeda -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- why am I not hearing -- I don't even know what it -- what it would take to make a convincing case for me now because they so thoroughly destroyed any credibility, ah, that they had with me even before they invaded.  I just, you know, I don't -- I just can't believe what -- I don't know what to believe from you guys any more, you know, nothing you can -- it's like, you know, when your kid has lied to you, ah, you know about, you know, what happened to the cookies in the cookie jar --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and when he finally tells the truth, you know, you can't tell if he's telling the truth or not.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I have -- I've gotten the impression that the, um, federal government has known for at least ten years and probably, you know, many years before that, before the first Gulf War, that Iraq was a threat and that they were a threat to middle -- Middle East, um, peace and world peace.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it was -- it was almost like they were looking for an excuse and they have been looking for an excuse before Bush was even in office.
R:  Right.
L:  And finally something came across where they say okay, here's our chance and we're going to have to take it because we might not get another opportunity for who knows how many years and by then it might be too late.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because they passed up their last chance ten years ago.  Um, but nothing -- nothing is ever repeated in the media.  If -- if I hear, um, a government official speak, it seems like -- directly, you -- you hear what they say and you could draw your own conclusions.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I think the media has really got a horrible job to only report, um, shocking information or partial information.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and not really present the whole story.  Um, I got an email today, you know, just these forwards that always go through, but it was a conversation between Al Gore and Oliver North and it was years and years ago when Al Gore was a senator and he was questioning Oliver North about some security system he was putting in his house and, um, Oliver North said that he received a threat from Osama bin Laden and his, um, fellow, you know, associates.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And -- and, um, Al Gore just couldn't believe that he would spend so much money on a personal security system of like, sixty thousand dollars just to secure his home or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he said, "This is the most dangerous man in the world and I'm going to protect my family".
R:  When was -- this is like nineteen ninety something?
L:  Yeah, it was, you know, years before even September eleventh happened.  Um, I don't -- I don't recall the year off the top of my head.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it seems like a lot of these people have known, um, for a period of time that there's these dangerous people but they haven't been able to do anything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then they had another, um, old news clipping when Clinton was in office and the, um, the -- I guess the pilot, the terrorist pilot that flew into tower one of the trade centre -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- he was actually, um, arrested for something while Clinton was in office but, um, the US government didn't want to have any kind of terrorist groups in jail or what -- whatever was going on.  They -- they didn't want to have this bad association with a Middle Eastern country at this time or whatever, so Clinton said, "No, just let him go, just let him go" you know and then a couple of years later it turns out that he was a super, super bad guy.
R:  Yeah, and again it's all -- I mean, I just, you know, everything I hear, I have no idea how much of that I should believe any more than -- 
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  If that's -- if that's true then, oh, yeah.  Jeeze, um, so I mean, yeah the -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- go ahead.
L:  Yeah, I'm here.
R:  Um, I think, yeah, the finding of, you know, terrorist groups, well --
