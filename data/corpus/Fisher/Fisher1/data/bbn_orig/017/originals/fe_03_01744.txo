R:  Hello.
L:  Hello [NOISE].
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  I'm Ashley.
R:  I'm Grace.
L:  I'm sorry.  What did you say your name was again?
R:  Grace.  Are you on a cellphone?
L:  Yes, and it's not picking up very good [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, um, um, what's -- the topic is foreign relations?
L:  Yes.  Like what countries do you think are a threat or if you think any countries are a threat and why?
R:  Oh.  Hm.  I was thinking about it.  I don't know.  Do you have any off the top of your head?
L:  Um, I think North Korea because of them producing the, um, nuclear weapons or the nuclear warheads.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  I think that they are a threat.  Um, as far as any other countries right now I really don't know of many .
R:  Yeah, it's been mainly Iraq and Afghanistan and the Middle East, basically, and North Korea, although they haven't really played up North Korea very much.
L:  I think they're starting to now.  I think they're starting to kinda worry a little bit [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I mean there was that whole thing about Bush, you know, trying to have talks over there or -- not go there but just have talks and they weren't very co-operative --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they just said, "Okay, well, hm, you know".  They didn't really pursue it.  It didn't seem -- it just didn't get as much visibility as obviously the Middle East has.
L:  See, and I think it should have gotten more visibility than that so [LAUGH].
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  I think that that's more of a threat than --
R:  They have less --
L:  -- Iraq was.
R:  -- to lose, you know.
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH] So, yeah, that kinda -- oh, but then there's the terrorist cells also in the Philippines, which is kinda scary.
L:  Okay.  I don't know anything about that.
R:  Yeah.  There's, um, you know, the American tourists that were kidnapped last year and then beheaded.
L:  I didn't know anything about that.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  The, um, the same, um, Al Qaeda they have -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they have, uh, in the southern Philippines there, you know, it's -- I guess, yeah, the southern Philippines is where they're based out of it.
L:  Hm.
R:  And so they have terrorism there against American, and I don't know so much ab- against the Philippine people but they're definitely a group of people there that have caused, you know, some concern.  But I can't think of any other country that really --
L:  Stands out.
R:  I mean, Canada and Mexico are close by and they're pretty -- I don't know, I mean, there's stuff in South America that's kind of hot.  But no, I guess not.  I mean, they didn't really give us anything to talk about.
L:  I know, they never do.  It's always like something you can talk about for like three minutes and then it's nothing [LAUGH].
R:  You're like "Okay" [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, where are you?
L:  I'm in Atlanta.
R:  Atlanta.  I'm in San Diego.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, yeah.  I'm trying to figure out where to go on vacation [LAUGH].
L:  Um --
R:  Definitely not North Korea [LAUGH].
L:  No, I don't think I would go there [LAUGH].
R:  Well, Asia was high on my list until this whole SARS thing broke out.
L:  Yeah, I think I'd stay away from that side [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I'm not going anywhere near there but I don't know and then my, uh, my fiance was scared about going to Paris because, you know, the French weren't --
L:  Right.
R:  -- really on our side.  But I love the French so I don't know.  Then I was thinking, "Oh, let's go to London" but then it was like, "I don't know".  It's just, uh, I don't -- I don't know [LAUGH].  I like to travel a lot but it's just, I don't know, at this point it's kind of a little scarier.
L:  Yeah, it is [COUGH].  I don't know.  I've never been overseas so ...
R:  Oh.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah, I don't know.  Last year I hadn't been over -- I travelled a lot but not -- not Eur- to Europe --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we went to Paris in March and I fell in love and so I went back again in May and then I went back to Europe again in June just to like -- I was just so enamored.  Like, "Oh, I have to go" and I went to -- I went to, um, Copenhagen, Vienna, Frankfurt and London.
L:  Oh, bet that was fun.
R:  It was fun.  It was -- but I went by myself so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it wasn't that f- -- it would have been more fun with somebody else but --
L:  Your fiance didn't go with you?
R:  He didn't go the third time around [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh,
R:  -- he was like, "You're nuts" [LAUGH] and I just said, "Okay, well, you know, I know" um, because we went to Alaska at the end of the year, last year --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or now like in September so I was -- you know, he -- he had to save up his vacation time [LAUGH] but I don't know, it is a -- I think -- I think we should maybe stay local, like stay in the United States.
L:  That's where I'm staying.
R:  I don't know.  I was just -- they're, like, trying to, um, lure people in travelling to Hawaii but people are scared about SARS too there.
L:  I re- I don't know if there was -- are there any cases there?
R:  Well, there's actually several cases all over the US, you know, in California, New York, you know, people who travel to Asia and they don't know how it's getting here.  Um, but Hawaii there's a lot of people like the Jap- the Asian countries travel to Hawaii.  It's the closest --
L:  Hm.
R:  --United States to get to.
L:  Maybe go somewhere in the Caribbean, or something.
R:  SARS?
L:  No.  I'm talking about maybe the--
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm like "Oh my gosh"  Well, the Caribbean, yeah, I thought about that too but, um, I think -- when does hurricane season start?  I don't know.
L:  I don't know.
R:  You're lucky.  You're right there.
L:  I know [LAUGH].
R:  Have you gone there a lot?
L:  No, not really.  I mean, I've been down the Bahamas and places like that but, um --
R:  Oh, fun.
L:  -- I'm getting married in August --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I think we're going to go down to St Lucia and get married.
R:  [MN] W- down there, get married there?
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  Wow.  That's --
L:  So, I don't --
R:  -- cool.
L:  -- want to do a wedding here [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, with the family and stuff.
L:  Yeah, I just -- I want to go away and get married on the beach at sunset.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I think when we get married, we're gonna elope [LAUGH].
L:  A lot cheaper.  I mean, you -- you know, you can go down there and get your whole honeymoon package and then pay like a few hundred extra dollars to get a weeding so ...
R:  Oh, really.  I like Vegas.  I know it seems cheesy but I like Vegas.  I just -- I love Vegas so it's like --
L:  I've never been to Vegas [COUGH].
R:  It's definitely a lot cooler now than it was, not weather wise but just -- it's got -- they've totally revamped it and it's just so much more fun.  I don't know, maybe it's because not as scummy as it used to be.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It used to be kinda scummy and like all those places.  I mean, maybe it was kinda cool for the rat pack whatever but [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  I kinda went past its glory but it's -- they've basically torn down a lot of the older hotels and put up a bunch of new ones --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- and, you know, it's kind of a place where you go and you never are up during the day and you're up at night only.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, you get up at, like, I don't know, nine pm and you just hang out until like five AM and then you go to sleep all day [LAUGH].
L:  Sleep all day?
R:  Or you can go to the pool, if you like.
L:   Yeah.  Well, you can sleep there too [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, definitely.  Although it gets really hot there, like, you know, really hot.  But I don't know, then you spend a lot of money gambling so I don't know --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- if that's necessarily the best vacation.
L:  That is true.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, how many of these studies have you done?
R:  Um, I've gotten, I think, two other calls.  This is my third call.
L:  Have you gotten paid for any of them?
R:  No.  How many have you done?
L:  I've done -- this is my third one --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and I haven't got paid for any of them, so I don't know.
R:  Yeah, I -- I went to U Penn so I know it's a pretty good school.  I mean, it's definitely well funded, um, so I mean it's not like a, you know, um, a fly by night school or anything [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, who knows.  I figure it's kinda neat to, like, talk about -- I think the last time -- what was the last conversation?  Oh, about how nine eleven --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Did you get that one?
L:  Yeah, I got that one and --
R:  And then --
L:  -- the very first one.  Um --
R:  What was yours?
L:  Um, airport security.
R:  Airport security.  Okay.  Mine was colds.  Have you had a cold lately?
L:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And ironically I had had just had a pretty bad one so I had lots to talk about and the person I was talking to had a cold at the time.  So, I guess --
L:  Well, that's a pretty easy one to talk about.
R:  Yeah, yeah I have a cold and I just had one [LAUGH] but can you imagine if you got that and you hadn't had a c- like you want -- do you ever get colds?
L:  I get colds all the time.
R:  Yeah, so do I.
L:  I have bad allergies.
R:  I get colds all the time and I get -- I mean, it's like that summer cold, winter cold, fall cold whereas some people I know never get sick, so I can't imagine them talking about that much long -- very long.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They'd be like "What's that feel like?  I don't know".
L:  [LAUGH]  No, I -- I stay sick all the time.  Wonderful air quality is Atlanta.
R:  Oh, right.  Smog, right?
L:  Yes, it's horrible.  I never had allergies until I moved here.
R:  Really?  Where did -- how long have you been there?
L:  Um, two years.
R:  Oh, where'd you move from?
L:  Mississippi.
R:  Oh.  Where in Mississippi?
L:  [LAUGH] Meridian.  You've probably never heard of it.
R:  Meridian, is that near um -- what's it near, the big city?
L:  Um, Jackson.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, I -- I used to live in Houston, so we --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- used to go over to, like, you know, we used to drive to Florida and then cut through all those states ...
