L:  Hi. I'm --
R:  Hi.
L:  [LAUGH] I'm Joyce Munro.
R:  Hi, I -- th- this is Daja[?] Muti[?] Ah, glad to talk to you.
L:  Same here.  Um, do you mind if I ask you a little bit about yourself and where you live and all that? 
R:  Sure, no -- no problem.  I live in New Jersey. 
L:  Oh.
R:  And I just came, um, [LAUGH] back from the office and had this call came.  I thought anyway I'll take it.
L:  That's wonderful.  So how -- how did you get hooked up with this project?
R:  Ah, uh, I just saw it on the Internet.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I just applied.
L:  That's wonderful.  Well, I live just outside of Boston, Massachusetts in a small town called Lexington --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and my husband actually works for, um, -- excuse me, my husband actually works for the company that's doing the research so that's how I found out about it, um, through him.  So, ah, it sounds like a very interesting project, so -- 
R:  That's true, that's true.  And now to the topic of the day, like, that has been assigned to us, also very interesting and controversial. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, definitely.  Well, what's, um, what's your first take on the topic? 
R:  First take, ah, ah, definitely, um, all the fundamentalist countries, ah, are a threat to, ah, America.  They -- somehow I -- I think so, like fundament- fundamentalist countries like, ah, Syria is one such fundamentalist country.  I mean, even for that matter, like, Iran is also one such fundamentalist country.  They -- they -- they -- there -- there are -- if -- if not the country as such that will be terrorist organization which believe in, ah, -- ah, their -- their terrorist goals and they think that America is a -- is a country which is against, ah, whatever fundamental, ah, ah, belief they have against their belief and, ah, they are evil and they will take -- they will be doing anything to the country at their own life.  Ah, so that is why I say that if any of those fundamentalist countries, they believe in their fundamental issues -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, may be attracted to America.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So what's -- what's your opinion?
L:  Well, I'll tell you it's really curious.  I tend to, um, think about the question of what countries represent a threat to our country.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think that in lots of ways I make a big distinction between a threat to our country versus a threat to our way of life and, um, it's amazing that, um, until September eleventh I just really didn't think that there was a [LIPSMACK] set -- that I would live in a -- live in a world in which there really was some fear that some personal harm could potentially come to me or my children or my family.  And I think that, um, [MN] it's difficult for me to -- to understand what countries pose a risk versus certain groups and I have to admit that I don't know too much about, um, foreign countries and the countries, the institutions of the countries, um, directly providing, um, support or directively -- it's directly working, um, or doing things that put us specifically in harm's way.  I mean, I read news reports about certain countries providing support to terrorist fundamentalist groups and I suppose those would be the countries that concern me [LIPSMACK] most.  Um, but to me I'm a little bit more concerned about individuals or groups versus entities as large as a country, if that makes sense.
R:  Yeah -- yes, I'm -- I'm absolutely right, you're absolutely right, and I'm also of putting of the same idea.  That is, ah, not as a country, but a -- but a group, a terrorist organizations live in these countries, ah, with or with total governmental knowledge. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Are a threat to us.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yes.  Ah, they are the people who change the lifestyle, ah, in America, particularly like America is known to have a free form of life- lifestyle so we don't fear going to a place.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, nowadays, ah, ah, ah, you have to look at the next car in the parking lot as a potential threat it may blow on your face.  See, that's -- that's the kind of -- of, ah, ah, void after September elen- eleven.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, you are right, very right, so -- so you -- you -- if I -- I -- if I see, ah, some -- some kind of an activity like somebody even op- opens up the bonnet and is a car -- that is the driver is not there, I -- I -- I run away from the place or at least walk swiftly out of the place.
L:  Right, now, do you live -- do you live close to, um, -- excuse me, do you live close to New York City?
R:  Yes, it is only thirty miles and I had seen the World Trade Centre collapse.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Yeah, that's -- that's remarkable.  I -- I think the closer -- the closer the connection you -- my -- my feeling is that the closer that you've felt from a proximity at the same point to what happened on September eleventh, the more fear I think you have.  So because I lived close to Boston, you know, immediately after September eleven -- immediately after the towers went down that first day, I can remember sitting in my office, and my office is about six miles outside of Boston.  I can remember [LIPSMACK] vividly hearing the lack of planes, the lack of airplanes, and every once in a while the air would be punctuated by the sound of jet planes.  All of a sudden these F16 jet planes were the only sound of plane in the air that day.  And yet, because they were F16s they were so loud that every single time I heard a plane for the first few days there is just this fear factor because of what had happened, and I think that our reactions, because we both live so close to cities where, like, that's where it started here and ended where you are, um, really touched us in ways that it didn't touch someone who might live in Michigan, let's say.
R:  Mm, yes, that's right, you are right.  And, um, I -- I think -- during those days, like, I worked in an office which is in Manhattan right away --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, it was very close to the Empire State Building and, ah, it was -- it was -- it was a little -- a little -- really, ah, frightening day. 
L:  I can imagine.
R:  Yeah, yeah, so that -- that -- that is why, like, the -- the fear factor has gone into the mind of [inaudible] and, ah, yes, like, I say, I -- I -- I believe, like, [MN] there will be threat and also, like it is very unfort- unfortunate that is that we are not able to establish the factor that we have eradicated Saddam Hussein and his, ah, group of people.  
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, the same is true with bin Laden and, ah, so sort of the possibilities are, ah, groups, ah, are more groups, ah, growing up and developing into terrorist organizations, ah, is the reality.
L:  Yes.
R:  And, ah, they may be harbored by, ah, the gorm- governments.  Or may not be, but, ah, there may be gr- groups which -- which may be funding them and, ah, they may be having enough, ah, ah, funds to bring in harm.
L:  Yes.  Well, I think -- I think that one of the interesting things that, um, ah, will be, um, good to watch is to see how Iraq kind of falls out.  It concerns me that there is so much religion that gets involved in this and there's often a perception, you know, internationally, that this is a Christian attack against an Islamic state and, I mean, I don't know about you, but [MN] I don't think from an American sense it has anything to do with religion and -- 
R:  [MN] Yes.
L:  -- that really concerns me.
R:  Yeah -- yeah, you -- you true -- I -- I -- I would say you are -- you are -- you are perfect in, ah, understanding, that.  Like, I say, I -- I -- I am neither Christian nor a, ah, a Muslim.  Like I say, I'm -- I'm a Hindu.  I come from India.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and we are God fearing but not fundamentalists.
L:  Right.
R:  So, ah, see, what you say is is true that -- that is why I say, like, these fundamental- fundamentalist states, they start believing it is basically the Christian country trying to attack a -- a Muslim country.
L:  Yes.
R:  So it is not that, ah, they don't view it as we are trying to mi- mitigate our risk.
