R:  Hi, my name is Dianne.
L:  Hi, I'm Jennifer.
R:  Hi, nice to talk to you.  Wow, that's a pretty heave subject, um, [LIPSMACK] what do you think [several inaudible words].  How do you find relations in the given climate [NOISE] -- 
L:  I'm sorry --
R:  [inaudible] [NOISE] 
L:  -- what was that?
R:  Did they say how we -- how we consider foreign relations with other -- I -- maybe I missed [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  I thou- I think it was, um, who, or what other countries we view as a threat to us -- 
R:  Okay, -- 
L:  -- is that what it was?
R:  Yep, that sounds exactly right.  Wow, um, [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] well, you know, I'm a little surprised who our -- who our allies aren't and who our allies are.  Over the past few months I've been kinda suprised and, um, you know, I'm disappointed with some European nations like France and Germany -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [NOISE], um, and you know, I -- I mean I think [NOISE] I would -- had a feeling that the Middle East was something to be really worried about, [NOISE] ...
L:  Yeah, I haven't followed everything that closely but, um, I was really disappointed about France too.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Um, I'm -- I'm not familiar with -- what other countries, you know, were backing us up [NOISE] -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, was Germany one, or? [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, they really, ah, they really backed down.  I mean they -- they -- they have aligned with France basically -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  You know?
L:  Um, do you think we should view any of them, like France or Germany as a threat to us though?  I mean did -- they just didn't want to back us in the war, isn't that about it -- 
R:  Right.  Yeah, I agree with you, like they don't have, ah, I don't know if its man power or interest or whatever and, you know, I don't think doing anything to us but [NOISE] it's not helping us. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, ye- I -- I don't think I'd really view them as a threat though, I mean -- 
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- it's -- it's -- it is a disappointment they didn't help us, but -- 
R:  Mhm.  
L:  --  I don't know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- this is kinda a hard topic because -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- I don't follow it -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- this that closely anymore.
R:  Sure, sure [NOISE] um, so, you know, Iraq, I -- Syria, Iran maybe, um, [NOISE] North Korea.  
L:  Yeah, I think they're all going to rebel against the whole peace thing that we're trying to do.
R:  Mhm, mhm, yeah. [NOISE] It was interesting too now the -- the UN wants to get back in on everything.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  You know, that was done, the hard part of it. [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm just kinda wondering if this is gonna bring more terrorist attacks?
R:  Right, I know, that's the scariest thing.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Not -- I -- I feel like -- I mean I hate to be pessimistic but I feel like it's -- we're in a calm time right now we've gone this long but, you know, if we think that everything's over and done with we're mistaken -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you just feel that way [NOISE], um.  How did you feel -- what did you think about North Korea, did you kinda always feel that way about them, or?
L:  About North Korea?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I'm not f- I'm not quite sure what you're saying, I didn't -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- what about them -- 
R:  Like with the nuclear arms that they might be having and developing.
L:  Oh, I didn't even know that. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm sorry. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  That's okay, um, -- 
L:  [LAUGH] um, do you want to tell me about it -- 
R:  Oh, yeah, -- 
L:  -- I -- was this something recent that was in the news that I might have --
R:  Ye--
L:  -- missed?
R:  Yeah, it actually came out around the time of with what we were deciding to do with Iraq, um, North Korea stepped forward and -- and they kept putting in, you know, all these notices about their nuclear weapons and they're developing and they're testing them, and I mean I was really surprised I didn't understand, first of all they would be so vocal about it, I mean, you know, at least Iraq has the common sense to try and cover it up.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  But, ah, -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  So, that was kinda scary to hear what they were up to.
L:  I think the scariest part is what we don't know, what the media -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and what, you know, what the President, you know, doesn't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- tell us.  That's -- 
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- the scariest part for me.
R:  That is, isn't it?  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Because I think w- we -- and I think they withhold a lot of information from us -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because if we knew everything, I mean -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- we'd all be [LAUGH] more -- really scared -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Right, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Absolutely. [NOISE] 
L:  I also think Saddam is still alive --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I just -- that's pretty scary too because who knows when he's gonna just, you know, pop back up and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what he's gonna do.
R:  Mhm, yep.
L:  It just seems [MN] like he never goes away. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right -- 
L:  [LAUGH] I --  
R:  -- I know.
L:  I'm -- I'm so scared I think he's really alive, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they would've found a body [NOISE] they would have found some [NOISE] sort of, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- more evidence saying he was dead, that how -- 
R:  Yeah, I agree with that -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that's a lot easier to prove, they would have been touting -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that all over had they found that, [LIPSMACK] oh, wow, [NOISE] yeah, there is a good chance he is alive, [NOISE] like, whoever harboring him they're definitely a threat, no question, whatever country it is [NOISE], you know, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- there was even a report that maybe he went to Russia or something?
L:  Is that what you heard s- that he might've -- 
R:  They were -- 
L:  -- went to Russia?
R:  Yeah, there were rumors that maybe Russia granted him asylum, he sneaked in there or Syria. 
L:  [MN] Do you -- 
R:  Um, ...
L:  -- think that, ah, he -- when he does surface, if he does, um, that he will try and get back in power or do anything or do you think he's just gonna stay out of [LAUGH] everything for a while?
R:  Yeah, I [MN] you know, it sounds like he's the kind he'll just do whatever it takes to -- I mean he -- he's so beyond evil that -- 
L:  Mhm -- 
L:  -- you know -- 
L:  -- I agree with that.
R:  Oh, but I -- I -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm proud of what we did --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm really, really proud because I think it's just horrific the things that he did and oh, my goodness, you know.
L:  A lot of people I've talked to were against the war but I -- I agree with it, I mean we had to do something [NOISE] -- 
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- I mean who knows when he would have used any weapons against us -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- he's -- he's not the person you want having something like that [LAUGH] -- 
R:  No, no.
L:  -- that's really, I don't know, I'm -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- glad that we went in there -- 
R:  [NOISE] Yes, me too.
L:  -- I mean it's a shame, you know, people -- you know, our people died and everything but -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- [NOISE] I wish it didn't have to be like that but that's -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- war. [SIGH] 
R:  I agree with you hundred per cent.
L:  I feel a little bit safer knowing, you know, that we stepped in and did something before it -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- was too late.
R:  Yeah, exactly -- 
L:  Because we were completely unaware there'd be terrorist attacks, you know -- 
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- I'm glad we just got in and did something before, you know -- 
R:  Right, right, I agree -- 
L:  -- something else happened. 
R:  Yep --  
L:  [MN]
R:  -- absolutely.
L:  But I still think they're a danger, I just don't think not near as much, I mean they don't have quite as much power as they -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- did before. 
R:  Yeah, it's hard to imagine they would, I mean even after the Gulf war and th- you know, those other strikes that followed years later -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm thinking how -- how did they have -- have anything after all that, and there's su- supposedly sanctions and, phew, you know, he had some good ties somewhere to be able to get anything, to sneak things in.
L:  I always wondered how he got hold of all that and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  No.
L:  So, did we find everything and remove it, I mean ...
R:  Um, you know, that's the thing -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I think that there'd been -- there'd definitely been reports and things but nothing, like, absolutely, "Here -- here are the items", but now the UN they said today wanted to go in there, they especially to get back, you know, get involved and do their inspections and, um, so, they're [MN] I -- I mean I believe that there's definitely things there, I -- I really do believe that -- 
L:  They did find -- 
R:  -- [several inaudible words]
L:  -- some re- really weird things.  I guess they found a painting of, ah, [LIPSMACK] I don't know where it was, it was somewhere there, um, in one of his -- Saddam's -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- hideouts or something -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and, ah, it was a painting of, ah, nine eleven --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- and they don't know -- 
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- if it was after it happened or if they had done that before -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it showed, um, you know, the plane crashing into what looked like in the painting would have been, you know, the twin towers -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it had our soldiers crying and -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- and walking with their heads down -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- so, that was kinda weird that really -- 
R:  Oh, [inaudible] -- 
L:  -- freaked me out.
R:  -- I didn't hear anything about that, that's [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  Um, I heard it on a radio station and there was a website, ah, they gave, um, saying -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- to go to a certain, ah, news station, a -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, on a website, um, from a news station and they -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they had a picture of it there.
R:  Oh. [NOISE] 
L:  So, that was really sad to hear, cause -- 
R:  Absolutely. 
L:  -- they -- they couldn't figure out if it was, you know, done recently or, you know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whether it was before or after, but still just to have a painting of that.
R:  Ah, oh, oh, my goodness, it's unbelievable, wow. [MN] And his whole family, you know, I mean, ah, you know -- every -- everything that he's infiltrated there, whoever's involved has  to go one way or another. [NOISE] 
L:  My -- I mean what I always wondered is how does he keep getting back in power there, I mean -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a lot of them -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- don't like him -- 
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- and they want to break free from all that -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but yet he keeps, you know, -- 
R:  I know.
L:  -- getting back in office and I don't understand [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  No, no, I don't either ac- [NOISE] certain -- oh, I guess [NOISE] wow.  And -- and you know what, didn't you have an election, like, a few months ago or maybe it was even a year ago and, like, he won by a landslide [LAUGH] -- 
L:  I heard -- 
R:  -- you know?
L:  -- [LAUGH] I -- I heard it, I didn't know -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- if it was a joke or not, but I heard -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- everybody voted for him -- 
R:  Right, [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  -- it's, like, what is he doing to threaten, and everybody -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- would vote for him. [MN] 
R:  I know, I know.
L:  That's just crazy.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Because that doesn't happen, not everybody [LAUGH] --
R:  No.
L:  -- is just gonna vote, that's -- 
R:  No.
L:  -- that's not the way it works.
R:  Mhm, [NOISE] and there must have been incredible fear, you know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- living [several inaudible words]
L:  Definitely.
R:  Oh, wow [NOISE] so, um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:   -- yeah, I don't know, you know what their neighbors are up to, but I hope while we're in the neighborhood that we find out everything that's going on, mm. [NOISE]
L:  I guess I don't fear the other countries as much, I'm just -- I'm just -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- just unsettled, you know, knowing that Saddam is still -- I -- I pretty much -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- know myself that he's out there -- 
R:  Yeah, I believe it.  
L:  -- and like you said before, he's not the type of person that, you know, he wants to d- do something -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he's not gonna just stay quiet and -- 
R:  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  -- he never has, so -- 
R:  No.
L:  -- that's kinda scary just -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what he's gonna think of next and if he has ties to, you know, -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- al Qaeda or, you know, who knows?  It's scary.  
R:  Right, absolutely --
