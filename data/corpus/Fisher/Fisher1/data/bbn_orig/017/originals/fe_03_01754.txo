R:  Hello.
L:  Hi -- hi, this is David Scellera[?].
R:  Hi, this is Jim, how are you doing? 
L:  How are you doing.  Ah, I didn't really catch the topic, I was talking to my mother at the moment.  So, what was it? 
R:  Oh.  The topic was do you consider any, um, -- what they said was, "Do you consider any other countries, ah, to be, ah, threats to America's national security and if so why".
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I don't -- I don't -- I don't know what they meant that --  as -- as opposed to --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- to some particular countries, or I -- I don't know but ... 
L:  Wow, that's a -- that's an interesting question. [LAUGH]
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Um, I'm from Wol- from Colorado, although I was raised in South America, but ... 
R:  Oh, Colorado, oh. 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm -- I'm in New Jersey -- so, ah, what do you think, do you want to get the ball rolling or ... 
L:  Oh, that -- it's a difficult one, because, ah, I don't know, I mean, wha- what is a threat to national security?  I mean, I don't think that there is really going to be a -- like a nuclear war at the moment, at least I don't think so, ah, and whether any country is -- is gonna declare war on the United States, I doubt it totally.  I'm -- terrorists organizations, you can call them countries, I'm not sure.  So that's -- that's an interesting question.  Although I heard say that, um, North Korea is developing missiles which might be able to reach the, ah -- the, ah, California coast.  So that's interesting.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's one country ob- obviously I'm very, ah, very concerned about.  Another is Saudi Arabia, at least a lot more so than Iraq.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I think the perceived, ah, threat by Iraq or at least the threat that's been claimed by Iraq, I think it pales in comparison to, ah, the threats from other countries, particularly Saudi Arabia but -- but other countries in the Middle East.
L:  Yeah, well, -- yeah, Saudi Arabia for instance, yeah, definitely has some, [NOISE] ah, some -- they're strange, I -- I think it's a very strange country, you know.  And, ah, the thing is, the funny thing is they are also, like, held to be, like, the Arab country, you know.  I have a friend who is Pakistani and he's a -- he's a pretty strong Muslim and he says, you know, he really admires the Saudi way of running the country and, you know, and so that's sort of current among Islam.  Of course, you know, their -- their monarchy are very --  where they -- where they run, ah, Muslim law and, ah, of course, ah, obviously only -- only Muslim religion is allowed, every other -- everything else is definitely not -- not permitted or at least, um, no open expression, you are not allowed -- you are not allowed to even +attempt -- attempt to -- to talk about conversion with -- with somebody else.  Ah, what else was there?  Ah, yeah, lots of stuff, it's -- it's an interesting country but if, ah, that's a model for many -- for many of the more religious Muslims it's -- it's very interesting to say the least.
R:  Mm, well, Saudi Arabia in particular, that's where -- that's from which, ah, Wahabbism is being exported --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which is -- ah, you know what that is, very radical, um, ... 
L:  Oh yeah, yeah, definitely.
R:  Very scary interpretation of Islam.
L:  Ahah, yeah.  Ah, it is, it is, definitely.  Um, probably, well, let's see, of course Osama Bin Laden is -- is -- is from Saudi Arabia -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, ah, and, um, and it's a very populous Arabian country also.  Ah, well, you know, like Iran also shou- it's probably pretty hard.  Of course they're much more open about it, while the Saudi Arabians maintain an open, ah, allegiance with the United States but, ah, internally they -- they act very differently. So --
R:  Yes.  Well, Iran's very interesting.  They have been going through, um, a lot of, um, internal, ah, turmoil of their own.  It's kind of between more of -- 
L:  Sort of -- 
R:  -- more of a western influence where, you know, women can go outside -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and walk without wearing hijabs and get -- get education and things like that versus these, ah, Islamic clerics who are -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- popping up out of the woodwork and -- and trying to gain popular support. 
L:  Yeah, correct.  Yeah, yeah, pretty much so.  Um, so there's a softening of the rent.  Although, you know, how much of a softening it is, i- in general terms I think it is -- in general they are pretty much still quite a bit like the Saudis.  Ah, they may be not quite as hard line as they were +before -- before with the Ayatollah.  Still, you know, they -- they got a lot --  they're having a lot of influence and so are the Saudi Arabians.  And, ah, definitely, ah, ah -- for instance, I was remembering, ah, the current Pakistani president, you know, um, ah, what's his name, he once said he admir- --  
R:  The what?
L:  The current Pakistani president said he once admired the, ah, the, ah, the founder of the Turkish Republic and he was immediately accosted by the press.  You know, Turkey is about the only, um, democ- -- well, somewhat democratic, ah, ah, Muslim republic out there and, ah, I can- can't really think of any- anybody else, I'm not sure if Egypt is -- if it is probably not quite to the same level as Turkey is.  And -- and when you consider that, you know, that, ah, they really -- that there's a strong push to -- to move away from, ah, from a democratic basis, it's sort of interesting to see what -- what's happening there.  So anyway, there was a big push for a, ah, religious state in quite a few places.  Right now, you know, the -- the Shiites who -- who are getting their fir- -- I guess it's the Shiites, the Shiites who are getting -- I never remember which is the Shiites and which are the sonnies[?] but the Shiites are, um, celebrating their --  that they are actually able to, ah, to celebrate their special days, you know, the martyrdom of I don't know who it was.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But in any case, um, they're -- at the same time that they're able to do this, because, ah, American forces, they take -- they get in and, um, get rid of Saddam, at the same time they're still asking -- there's still, ah, a few there that are saying, oh, go -- go away Americans and let us have our -- our religious, ah, ah, ah monarchy or whatever it is they want and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- most likely or not those are Iranian plants, you know, people that have, um, been, um, influenced by the Iranians.  I am sure the Iranians pay a good few -- few payrolls there and fund some of these groups so -- 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Good point.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I just -- yeah, I've always thought Iraq was interesting too because they diverge so widely from the -- the fundamentalist world, that there be the Arab camp socialism where, um, actually under -- under the Bath- Baathist, ah, party.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Religious devoutness was actually, ah, frowned upon.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Obviously, um, punished in a lot of instances.
L:  Y- yeah.  Well, the interesting thing is that was one of the few places where, ah, ah, outside religious, actually the one request religion was the Majorge religion, the Shiites if I remember correctly, and, ah, other religions that are, you know, Christians, could as a matter of fact be in there, I don't know, you know, or -- or -- or whatever other religions there are.  There's not much else there really I guess except Jews, Christians and Muslims.  
R:  Yeah.  There's also, um, Bahaiism and I think a few Zoroastrians running around.
L:  Oh, okay, yeah.
R:  But they, yeah -- ob- -- ob- -- the Bahaiis have kind of gotten oppressed everywhere and -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- Zoroastrians, there's -- there's so few of them.  It's -- it's -- it's such a kind of an esoteric, um, faith that they're -- they're just going to get beat up on wherever they are.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know -- I know that's the situation with them in Iran.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, ah, --  
L:  I didn't even know they still existed frankly.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's kind of -- it's the, um, the uniqueness of Iraq is why a lot of theorists thought that, um, a regime change in Iraq would be a -- a kind of a foothold into the Arab world and introducing, ah, democracy and more kind of modern, ah, western influence.
L:  Mhm, mhm, yeah.
R:  To be honest, I'm not sure if that's -- well, it's not an entirely good or entirely bad thing but I'm not -- I'm not sure whether more of it is, ah, is goi- -- is going to be good or harmful.
L:  Yeah.  Well, the question of it is, ah, well, getting back to the original question, whether it is a, um, threat to America's security.  At the moment, you know, it's very hard to catalogue threats, exactly how -- what -- what would be a terrorist attack from nine eleven, it's very, very difficult to say, "Okay this person's a threat, this person's not" and so on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, wow, of course, if you have weapons of mass destruction in general it's, um, it's not very good but, ah, the question is also the character of who was -- who is holding the weapons of mass destruction, you know, and, um, and how they intend to use it.  So, well, yeah, I guess to them it's -- it's pretty -- pretty scary, Iraqis.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He was pretty -- I mean, he didn't -- just seemed strange in different ways.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and --
