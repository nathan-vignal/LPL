R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is Yobish[?] 
L:  Hi, I'm Carol Blakely.
R:  Hi, Carol.  Ah, it's nice talking to you today.
L:  Nice talking to you.
R:  So, ah, --  
L:  I guess the question is whether we think there's any other country that's a threat to the United States.
R:  Yeah, that's right and, ah, what do you think? 
L:  Well, I'm not sure what they meant by any other country but, um, if they're talking about any other country other than Iraq or any other country other than North Korea or, you know, other, um, countries that have been in the news lately.  Um, and I don't really know, I mean I haven't really thought about, I guess, threats to the United States but it seems to me that there are probably a lot of people in the world that are, um, not particularly enthralled with the United States in general so I probably have to say there probably are other countries that may hold threats.
R:  Ah, actually, I think, ah, otherwise.  This -- the question is probably not, ah, which country but, ah, probably the way we have seen the analysis of terrorism, the analysis of, you know, posing threat, how the matter -- matters, they are using [inaudible].  It's more about which organisation is a threat.
L:  Rather than a country.
R:  Rather than a country.
L:  Mhm, that's probably -- you are probably right.
R:  Because these organizations are truly, like, global.
L:  Mhm.
R:  As -- as many culprits are so they -- they work in the same manner.  They don't have a country and --  
L:  Not particularly a country, yeah, you are probably right. 
R:  And diplomatically no country is probably going to say okay, we are anti America or -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or any other country for that matter.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Even if -- even if they have, like, a long going, you know, ah, conflict with a neighboring country then that was fate, that's okay, we are -- 
L:  Yep.  No, you are probably right, I'm sure they are probably just maybe factions in a country and I -- unfortunately I guess people -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sometimes tend to generalize that it's everybody -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when it really isn't.
R:  Yeah. Yeah.  The freedom of, ah, individual in most countries have in peace so much that, ah, you don't really necessarily have to relate, ah, relate, ah, you know, and you just tendency to be anti any country to that country itself.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  In fact it could be just a lot of the country like we seen in the case of Iraq, it does not --  
L:  Right.
R:  Now, the -- you know, the real thing is not Iraq.
L:  No.
R:  We are not against Iraq -- 
L:  No.
R:  -- we are against the rulers.
L:  Yep.
R:  Right.
L:  Well, that's true and his people that are, you know, with him but, I don't know, it seems that even with, um, him, once he's not around any more, there are many people that have also decided that they are not really in favor of what he did anyway and kind of a- abandoned ship, so to speak.
R:  That's right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so in that manner we can say, ah, there's a ruler in -- in North Korea.
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which is not really -- not really interested in, you know, coming on terms and not sitting on -- sitting on table to discuss the issues.
L:  Mhm.
R:  With the arms, flags and everything with the United States so we can say probably that's one ruler that's a threat to the United States, not that country.
L:  Yep, no, you're absolutely right.  Yep, I think that's a good point.
R:  Yeah. And --
L:  But, um, yeah, it tends to -- people tend to generalize I guess or when they talk about it it's not necessarily the ruler but the whole country's brought into it and I'm --
R:  No, I -- 
L:  -- sure that probably is not true.
R:  No, no, it's not true in any country.  I mean, ah, [MN] probably then the next question probably would be that any religion which is against, ah, against particular vision and that would be -- I mean this is kind of the wrong question to pose so -- so I think, ah, yeah, that's one ruler and then there are some other rulers -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which are, um, kind of -- which have been kind of opposed to the United States policies and, you know, intervention.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, very cowardly and they still are in power.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But those countries are not, ah, you know, part of the threat to the United States.
L:  No.
R:  Only those countries where there is official policy by a certain -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, government -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- ruled by individual --  
L:  Yeah, and it's too -- 
R:  -- to support. 
L:  I think, um, too, a lot of the reason that, um, people sometimes tend to make generalizations --  
R:  Mhm. [MN]
L:  -- like I did sometimes are -- the reason is that they just, um, -- they are not that familiar with unfortunately other cultures other than the United States but, um, you know, I have travelled some, not to, um, the Middle East -- 
R:  Ah, -- ahah.
L:  -- but to some countries, um, other than, you know, around in the United States and it is, it's very, ah, I think the kind of feeling you get when you are in a country is very different than the feelings that you might have talking about it or reading what is published in American newspapers or journals or magazines or on the news.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, that's a very different perspective.
R:  Yes, that's right.  So what -- you know, what country did you travel to?
L:  I've been to -- I was in Japan for a while.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And my daughter travelled in, um, -- well, actually she has been in the Middle East.  She was in Israel and, um, she was there for about six months and travelled around, um, [LIPSMACK] -- well, she didn't go really too much further.  She went into Italy.
R:  I see.
L:  Um, Greece -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and around in there, um, just briefly but she spent -- 
R:  [MN] Yeah. And some --
L:  --  most of her time in Israel.  And even there she said too, she said it was never -- she -- now this was three years ago, she said she never felt as much in danger as she was led to believe when she was in the United States that she may be.  I mean, you heard things and you had to be careful. Yeah --
R:  See that's another thing which I -- which I think -- I'm from India.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And when I travel to a country like her, you know, I was in Oman.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And when I travel to a country like that, I -- although I am not a Christian, I'm not a US citizen, I am from India, I am a Hindu. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  But probably I think, ah, that Israel is very hostile.
L:  Israel? 
R:  I mean, for no good reason.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I don't have any- anything to -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- to believe because I am from a certain country or I'm --  because of my religion, they are against me.  I think it's just about the way the people or they behave.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We don't have to a- assume it's just because you are Christian --  
L:  No.
R:  -- or you are from the United States.
L:  No.
R:  That's what they are doing it.  It's just, ah, nature, you know.
L:  Yeah, yeah, it can be.  It's very very different.
R:  So, you have to just accept them -- accept them the way they are.
L:  Yeah, but she never felt, I guess, that she was in jeopardy, let's put it that way.
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's right.
L:  You -- you didn't go certain places at certain times and you had to be careful but it wasn't as though she felt threatened -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- put it that way.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But, yeah, I know, it is, it's a -- you know, and again it's a very, um, kind of cultural thing I think too for her. 
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  Yeah, she -- she, you know, she said in the United States you are used to, when you walk down the sidewalk you get out of the way of the people that are coming toward you, you know, everybody walks kind of on their side.  And she said there it was -- you know, people go wherever they wanted to go, whether it was right -- right down -- 
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  -- the middle or what and if you are in the way [LAUGH] too bad. So --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But, ah, nobody minds.  I mean, you -- I mean, that happens. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh, exactly.
R:  And that's the way that country is. 
L:  Exactly.
R:  And that country has been for maybe -- 
L:  Yep.
R:  -- last two hundred, three hundred years.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  So, you cannot just --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- ah, keep go -- keep go -- go out -- go out and tell them this is not the right way to behave. [LAUGH] 
L:  No. It's -- you know, --
R:  You cannot do that.
L:  No, no. Nope.
R:  So, I don't know what, ah, else.
L:  No, I think we have kind of covered it as far as I am concerned but I think your points are well taken.  And, ah, it is an interesting -- an interesting question, that's for sure.  Sometimes I think too the -- the reason --  
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- that -- well, you hear so much more about it because everything is so much more open and communication is so much more rapid than it used to be. 
R:  Exactly.
L:  I mean, maybe hear about things that would be not instantaneous.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And now you can get on the Internet or whatever and see things --  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- as they are happening.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, it's certainly much more up front than it has been in the past.
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  Yeah. Have you been --  
R:  What --  
L:  I'm sorry, go ahead.
R:  Pardon me, yeah, I was going to ask you about what do you think about what happened in Afghanistan.
L:  In -- in reference to what?
R:  In reference to the American action there and, ah, the freedom and, ah, the change of regime and, ah, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Following developments, change of, ah, you know, --  
L:  How about you? 
R:  Well, I think, ah, it's still, ah, kind of a good, ah, observation.
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean -- I mean, ah, we still have to learn, because Afghanistan has been a country in turmoil since last hundred years.
L:  [MN] Exactly.
R:  And, ah, we had to see and, ah, you know, take lessons that how much intervention of -- of -- intervention of the military and, you know, economical and all sorts of interventions, from an -- from a developed country where USA --
L:  What you can do --
R:  -- can effect and can really help that country.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And can -- it really can work that country now into a country that supports not the U- United States, I would not say that --  
L:  No.
R:  Supports, you know, the democratic, ah, ah, you know, ah, agenda, in that country --
L:  That they can run on their own? 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  No. 
R:  So
