R:  Hello?
L:  Hi. [LAUGH] I'm Chris.
R:  Hi.  I'm Melanie.
L:  Hi, Melanie.  Do you have kids?
R:  Huh?
L:  Do you have kids? 
R:  Yeah, I do.  I have four, in fact.  You?
L:  Oh, and I  yes, yes I just have one.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Uh huh.  Are they in school?
R:  Yeah, um, I've got fourteen, two nine, and a seven.  So they're all very much in school.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How 'bout yours?
L:  Um, yes, she is nine.  So yes 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:   she is in school, uh huh.  Do your schools have 
R:  You know it's funny, they ask about the computers in school, I went to, ah, my ten year class reunion and talked to a couple of my old teachers, and oh my gosh, they just think that that is the downfall of education, you know, that teachers are gonna be replaced by computers, and that 
L:  Oh, really?
R:   they can't  oh, yeah.  I was really surprised.  I mean, these were a couple of science teachers, you know, and they just  they couldn't imagine anything worse than computers in schools, 'cause they thought that that was gonna, you know, take their jobs away, I guess.  I don't really know.
L:  [LAUGH] But if they don't learn how to use them at some point in time, and don't actively use them, then what do they do when they, you know, grow up?  Because that's the world now. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know what's funny, um, I'm pushing forty hard, and when I was in school, you know, it wasn't even a thought.  We didn't have computers.
L:  Right.
R:  But one of the  one of the best things that I did, just kind of accidentally, was learn to type.  I took typing one year, and I thank, thank goodness every day because I sit on a computer every single day.
L:  Right, right.  Well, you know 
R:  And, and you're right.  You know, if they don't 
L:  Yeah, because 
R:   if they don't learn about computers in school, they're gonna have to use them, it doesn't matter what they do.
L:  Right.  And I, I find that, you know, my daughter will come home with a project and, you know, we're  my mother used to drag us off to the library, and now I just say, "Go look up  look it up on the internet". [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, it's amazing.
L:  It has the same amount of information. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, any question that comes up, you know, if there's some doubt about it, it's like, "Well let's just go see".
L:  That's right.
R:  Yeah, it's a really, really good information source, you're right.
L:  Right.  And it's a good  it's a good way for them to learn how to use it for other things than to play games. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mine, mine use it for games a lot but you know, they, they have some games too that they accidentally learn something along the way, you know, they learn math, or they may just learn where the letters are.
L:  Right.
R:  So.  Well 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, we have to go ten minutes on this, huh.  Um, [LAUGH] yeah, I guess the only thing that I find a little, a little difficult for my daughter sometimes, and I know they, they do practise in school, but she'll come home with a, a list of spelling words where part of her homework is looking definitions in the dictionary, and I remember doing that in school, and you  then you had to know how to find the word.  And now we don't even own a dictionary so she just goes on the computer and types the word in there and it pops up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I was concerned about, you know, do you know how to look this up in the dictionary in case there's ever a day you have to do that. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, and you know something else, I just thought about this 'cause we did this yesterday, um, one of my four children's teachers, um, uses the internet to post homework and spelling words.  And, so kiddo comes home without his spelling words, and he's like, "Oh, we'll just go to, you know, the"  are you there?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, we had a beep.
L:  Oh.
R:  He said, "We'll just go to teacher's web site and, ah, you know, she'll have the spelling words posted there".  And I'm like, "Oh, what a great idea".
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So the teachers are using it to communicate with parents, and you know, with students, and kinda help them out at home as well.
L:  Yeah.  I, I think, you know, all in all, you know, there may be a couple of downfalls, but all in all it's  it's definitely, you know, easier and better for them than when we were in school, and you know, not having to, to run to the library all the time to find out every little thing.
R:  Right, right.  And then, you know, I can email my kids' teachers, and  instead of, you know, possibly having to call them when they're home with their families, and 
L:  Yeah.
R:   the email part of it is really convenient because nobody has to answer a phone right then, or answer, you know, the call right then, you can kind of do it at your own convenience.
L:  Right, right.  I know 'cause it's  a lot of times it's hard to get a hold of the teacher.  You know, they have the students in class and then they have, you know, sometimes conferences after  after school or meetings, and 
R:  Oh, exactly.
L:   yeah.  So it's hard to get a hold of them.  But the internet's so much easier, you just leave your message and they write back their answer and you don't have to worry about it.
R:  Yeah, and you know, the same thing with the school district, or I assume most school districts have a web site now so that you can go and look at the school calendar, you know, if you don't happen to have a copy of it with you or handy or whatever, you can just go and see what, you know, days off for spring break, or you know, what kind of things are going on at school as well.
L:  Right, right.  Yeah, and I know our PTA uses it also to, you know, keep in touch what's going on in the PTA meetings, and, um, you know, they send out notices when there's gonna be meetings so that, you know, everybody can kinda feel like they know, you know, what's happening and stay informed.
R:  Yeah.  Ours isn't using it that much for the parents' groups, but that's a good idea, that's something that we probably should do more of.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause then  you know, I know it's  they send it out in the school letter, but you know, a lot of times those don't get home.  The kids forget to bring them home, or you know, you throw them in a drawer and [LAUGH] forget about them.
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] I have that tray right beside my desk where it's like, "Mom, I brought that paper home, remember?".  It's like, "Oh, yeah, you did?". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  If it's on my computer I have to look at it every day, so it's a lot more 
L:  Right, right.
R:   visible.
L:  Yes, it is.  And I  you know, I just  I've gotten to the point where I don't even, you know, write letters to people anymore.  I use the computer for everything and, and my daughter does too now.  She, she will stay in touch with a lot of friends that have moved away from her school, which I think is great, you know, 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:   and one day she'll grow up and be glad that she stayed in touch with some of these, you know, grade school friends that she's had.
R:  And you know, I have done the same thing, I have moved away from the area, um, you know, where I spent most of my life, and I left a lot of friends behind, and I wouldn't pick up the phone to call them, and I wouldn't, ah, you know, sit down and write a letter, but I email these people all the time.
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know, so you stay in touch with people that you've gotten away from.
L:  Right.  It's a good thing for them, I think, in that  you know, all the, all the, all the people who are saying it's wrong, I don't think it's ever going to replace a teacher, 'cause the computer can't  can't explain something that you don't understand if you  if you're not understanding the one way the computer states it, the computer can't sit down and try and, and explain it to you in another way so that you can understand like the teacher can.
R:  Well  and, you know, not to replace teachers, but certainly as an aide to teachers.  You know, they have so many kids in a classroom that if you've got, you know, say twenty five per cent of your class is actually self motivated and able to self pace, you know, that is ideal for that kind of an individual that doesn't necessarily need the, ah, the teacher to say, you know, "Step one, step two, step three".  And, and it kind of teaches them that initiative.
L:  Right.
R:  That  and then you take the teacher and she's got that many fewer little bodies to deal with so that those who need the, the more attention, you know, she's able to give them more of her time individually as well.
L:  Right.  Well I know my daught- -- you know, my daughter complains, she, she's bored in school sometimes, because, you know, she's one of the ones that catches on really easily, and her teacher, you know, lets them use the computer and, um, do, you know, extra credit reports, you know, just for something to do while the other kids are, you know, trying to catch up to where she's at already.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  You know, so  you know, he doesn't have to worry about her scheduling library time, or you know, having to do it at home, you know, he just says, "Okay, pick a topic here and, you know, write a report on it".  And she can go right to the computer and start, you know, working on it and have something to keep her occupied instead of  you know, I think a lot of those kids that, that get bored in school are the ones who, you know, start causing trouble. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, unfortunately you're, you're exactly right.  It's some of the really bright kids who are causing the trouble because they don't have as much to do, and, and you know, that's what I'm saying.  You could have some kind of system, and the computers would certainly help with that, where those kids have above and beyond.  And I mean, that's kind of a treat for the kids, you know, that they can go and do some work on the computer, and do some extra stuff.
L:  Well, and I think that they all like it.  You know, they all enjoy using the computer.  And what they, what they like to do they will, you know, they'll put more effort into it 
R:  Exactly.
L:   than anything they don't like to do. [LAUGH]
R:  You're gonna learn a lot more if you're enjoying the way that you're learning it, you know, blah blah blah from a teacher  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:   like solid classes like that.
L:  Right, right. [LAUGH]
R:  So where are you from?
L:  I am located in Colorado.
R:  Oh, are you.
L:  Uh huh.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from Texas originally.  I live in Illinois now.
L:  Illinois, oh.  And, now, do your kids go to a public school, or a private school 
R:  Yeah.
L:  A public school 
R:  All four 
L:   and they have computers?
R:  Yeah, some of them they do  like, my oldest is in, um, middle school, he's in the eighth grade, and they use computers, um, that are actually wireless internet.  It's really cool.
L:  Wow.
R:  They, they call it the airport.  And they have a bunch of laptops that they have actually bought, um, and there's only enough for one classroom to use at a time, but they can access the internet, they just take the little laptop to their desk and they can actually access the internet right there at their desk.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They have really updated equipment.
R:  Yeah, well it's one of the few things around this school district.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, ah,  you know, the school building's fifty years old, but they have wireless laptops. [LAUGH] But anyway, that's  and they've got enough filters, of course, built in that the kids won't get into anything they shouldn't be getting into, and they all have to sign off on agreements saying, you know, I'm not going to do this and I'm not going to do that, and, you know. 
L:  Right.  We have that too.  Like  'cause 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And even the parents have to sign that, that they allow their child to have access to the internet
