L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  I'm Donna.  I live in Cleveland, Ohio.
L:  My name is Heather and I live in Florida, in St Petersburg.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Nice to meet you.  So, what other countries do you think are a threat to the US?
L:  Oh, god.  Um, I'm trying to think.  Well, you know, Iraq of course [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and I think actually North Korea --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as well and I've heard -- recently heard some things about Syria that they don't like us either [LAUGH].
R:  Who were the ones that wouldn't back up the United States?  What were those counties?  I can't remember.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Um, France is one that -- that hates us now, I think and, um, I think, and I'm not sure, but I think Germany wouldn't back us up either.
R:  Right.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I think you're right.  So, for those reasons I must say that those countries because, I mean, if they wouldn't back us, I don't know if they'll support us in the future.  Uh, I mean they might be a threat.  I don't know.
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  I don't --
L:  I'm just at odds really.  I'm working, you know --
R:  What's that?
L:  I said I'm just really at odds because, I mean, my husband's in the military.
R:  Oh.  He is?  Is he over there?
L:  Um, no, not right now, he isn't.  He's actually safely in Virginia [LAUGH].
R:  Good.
L:  So, that's really good but I mean, he was -- he -- he was in -- first year we were married, they sent him to South Korea --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for a year and, I mean, of course then that was in, what, ninety, ninety eight and, you know, there wasn't really anything going on then.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, thank god [LAUGH] but, I mean, you know, you hear all these things on the news about, you know, how they're -- they've got all of these weapons and things like that and I'm just, like, you know this is [NOISE] just totally amazing, you know.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  Everything's like happening at once, you know what I mean?
R:  Right, right.
L:  [NOISE] so I'm just, like, "You know, just let my husband get out of the army safely" [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.
L:  Nothing happen, because he's supposed to actually get out in June so ...
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  So, hopefully they won't say, uh, "Sorry you can't go". [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know --
L:  But --
R:  Go ahead.  I'm sorry, go ahead.
L:  Oh, sorry.  But, I mean, um, other than that I -- I really -- I would hope that nobody else is like [NOISE], you know, crazy or anything [LAUGH].
R:  I don't know.  I kinda think all those countries over there, I mean, like, Afghanistan, Iraq --
L:  Right.
R:  -- Iran, all of them are to be feared.  I mean, I mean, actually who knows though because didn't they say that there's terrorists groups all through the world in many different countries so who is to know, I mean, which countries to be afraid of?  Actually, I don't trust anybody except our government.
L:  Right, and sometimes, you know, that's kinda funny too [LAUGH].
R:  I know, but I think we're very blessed to live in this country anyway when you see the way it is over there.  My god.
L:  Yeah, and another thing is it's like, um -- well, this is kind of off our topic but, you know, I watched, um, that interview with Madonna --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, I don't know if you heard about her video that she was going to put out --
R:  No.
L:  -- but it was supposedly very anti-American and there was going to be, like, grenades and she's gonna, you know, like, throw grenades and there was going to be dead Iraqi babies all over the screen and --
R:  That's a horrible thing.
L:  -- I guess -- Yeah.  And I guess she was basically trying to put her opinion out but still it's, like, you know, why -- why would you do something like that?  It's one thing to say that you're against the war but my whole thing is, you know, since my husband's in military, I -- you know, I might not agree with what's going on but, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm going to support the troops, you know.  I think that's the number one thing that they should do and what I was going to say was, at least we live in a country where they can do that, and they won't get, like, killed, you know --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- like in other places, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  At least we can voice our opinion and not be, you know, put in some kind of concentration camp or something like that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it's like until -- until they, you know, the troops went over there, there was so many things that I never knew that Saddam Hussein did.  Like, he had all of these prisons and he killed all these people and he used, like, chemical weapons on his own people and it's like what kind of person is this, you know?
R:  A sick person.  Actually I'm afraid of China and I'm afraid of Cu- Cuba too because, I mean, look at over there.  Who -- you just have, um, Castro and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that man is nuts.  I mean, he's like a Hitler over there so I guess I would have to say I'm afraid of Cuba.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  I mean, since -- I'm -- from what I've heard for a long time, you know, they've had problems with him --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and I think he's a nutso [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I guess, I don't know.  I mean, right now, I wouldn't even travel myself overseas to other countries.  I mean, with everything so unsettled, who knows.
L:  Oh, no.  I'm lucky that I travel within the US [LAUGH] on a plane, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Oh, I don't know.  I -- I guess I can't say I don't know what countries I fear but definitely Cuba, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, has anybody heard from Osama Bin Laden?  I mean, is he still alive?  I mean, where is he?
L:  I don't know and it's seems like after, you know -- you know, they -- they sent people over there and I really didn't hear anything.  You know, they were bombing all the caves and didn't really hear anything after that and then, of course, this whole Iraq thing started, and I'm like, "Well, what's -- but what about Afghanistan?  Have they killed him or what?" [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  'Cause I mean --
R:  And have they -- have they found, I mean, weapons of mass destruction, I mean, over there now in Iraq.  I mean, so-- last I heard they hadn't found anything and that was the whole purpose, I thought, of having the war because they wouldn't reveal them.  Have they found them?
L:  Right.  Uh, so -- so -- blah.  So far as I know, I haven't heard anything but I did hear there was a guy that they nicknamed Chemical I- -- Ali, I think his name was.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And he was like one of Saddam Hussein's, like, top guys --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he was like -- I told you about that -- that-- they basically wiped out, I think, it was the Kurds.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That they wiped out, like, a whole village.  You -- I guess they were, like, testing the chemical weapons.
R:  Oh my.
L:  It's like why would you use that on your own people?  I mean, that's just amazing and then these people are still just like, "Saddam Hussein is the greatest thing ever" you know, and knowing that he did these things.  But, anyway, what I was going to say was that guy, Chemical Ali, they -- they found him.  He was dead.  So, I was like, "Well, that's a good thing" [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I mean, this guy -- this guy's not going to be a threat any more but --
R:  Oh, but my husband said now we've been over there and we've gotten rid of Saddam Hussein's government that now they want us out of there.
L:  Really?  I haven't -- I have -- I try not to watch the news too much 'cause I'm just like, "Oh my god, it is so depressing" and -- but, I mean, in the best thing I think they came, you know, when they had all those POWs and they finally got some of them back and -- but, I mean, you know, when they took over Baghdad --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they -- you know, the people were actually -- you know, they took down that statue and the people were hitting his face with their boots and stuff --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and supposedly that was like the biggest insult over there that you could do and, I mean -- but to me, it's amazing.  Did you see all of the pictures he has of himself all over the country?
R:  Yes.
L:  I mean, I'm like, "What a egomaniac". This guy must think he's God, you know.
R:  Does he have family like in other countries, because in those countries then I would be very much afraid of, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Would think they would be a threat if he has family or relatives in other countries.
L:  I know and they were saying that they thought maybe -- I forget the name of the city but they thought maybe if he was still alive, that -- that he would gone back to like where he was born, I guess.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I -- so far as I've found out that they didn't find him there, but they say that he could be dead but I don't know.  I really doubt it.  With all the underground stuff they have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- I -- I don't-- it's just almost too good to be true if he died, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It seems like --
R:  Well, what country wouldn't you go to?  What country wouldn't you go to right now, definitely?
L:  Oh, gosh.  Probably France [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.
L:  Probably.  I -- I -- I don't -- I don't really know 'cause, I mean, you know, after September eleven I really wasn't scar- -- I was kind of scared to go on a plane because my mother had come to Virginia to visit me and then she went back from here to Florida and I was so scared because it was, like, two weeks after that.
R:  Hm.
L:  And I was like, "Oh my god, please let her get there safely" you know, but I think now it seems to me a lot of people have forgotten about what happened with the World Trade Center.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, they've forgotten about all the children that got killed in the planes and in -- in the actual towers and I think that's so sad.  I mean, you've got, you know, all of those thousands of people that died, you know, and I think I would be afraid of any of those middle eastern countries because they're all crazy.
R:  Right.  
L:  You know.
R:  Any of those terrorists that were involved in nine one one whatever countries they were from.  So, I would be afraid of those countries and I would think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that they would be a threat because if they're training those people over there to sacrifice their lives, then --
L:  And they've -- and then they've got -- and I -- and I definitely wouldn't want to go to Israel either because those people --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- are crazier.  You know, they're -- they're killing themselves and, you know, they're -- you know, and after they do those suicide bombings and supposedly Hussein had paid their family like all of this money because they're like heroes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and they've killed these people and they've killed themselves but they're heroes.  I don't -- I don't -- that doesn't make any sense, you know.
R:  So, then do you realize there's not very many countries that we would feel safe going to, that we would be feel that are safe, period, that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- aren't a threat to us.
L:  Right.  
R:  I don't know.  
L:  That's true.
R:  Why does France -- why is France -- I mean, why didn't they agree with, um, us, the United States?  What was their reason?
L:  I don't know.  I think they -- they thought it was probably, you know, not necessary but it's, like, you know, I -- I -- my dad was like, "This is crazy.  They're start-
