L:  Hi [COUGH] -- hi, is anybody there?
R:  Yes, hi, I'm here. 
L:  Okay.  I guess -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- we're supposed to talk about foreign relations?
R:  Yes, and if any -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we believe any countries are a threat to US safety?
L:  That's right -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and do you?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] yes, I do, um, -- 
L:  Okay, I do too -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- so, that won't be too hard, we're [LAUGH] but I'm probably more unusual because right now I'm not too trustworthy of France I'm --
R:  Yeah, that's a good point.
L:  You know, that's a good point because -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- all of these compan- these countries that didn't want us to get involved and now all of a sudden they're like, "Oh, the reason you didn't want us to get involved was because you've got all your -- all these ties in there" -- 
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  -- so ...
R:  -- although I don't -- I don't think of it so much as, ah, direct threat to our safety, I -- 
L:  No.
R:  -- I think they're -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, probably not going to do us any good in the long run, but ...
L:  No, but [MN] more so of an indirect.  If they're supplying people that can do direct threats. 
R:  Right, that -- that's true.
L:  You know. [LIPSMACK]
R:  [MN] 
L:  So, what other country do you think of?
R:  Um, my big c- concern is, um, North Korea with -- I think it's north with their -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- nuclear program that they have, um, [COUGH] [LIPSMACK] it concerns me because I don't think they -- I think they -- would do something, um, more to make a statement -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- than to actually resolve a problem.
L:  I think a lot of it is that, is just making a statement --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- you know, that they can actually do something. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was something that -- I don't remember wi- who it was that said it, but I think it was one of the generals, they said,  "Well, why are you doing that?"  And he says,  "Because I can", and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, we do, we have a lot of power out there, but we support so many nations with money -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and everything it's like ther- there should be no reason.  I mean I -- I can't even think of a reason -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- why they came over here in the first place except that they wanted to disrupt us.
R:  Why, who came over here?
L:  Whenever they came over for nine eleven.
R:  Oh, yeah, yep.
L:  You know -- 
R:  Yep. 
L:  -- it was just to disrupt us.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Basically.
R:  Well, the other thing that I -- I do think about sometimes, is, you know, a lot of times we think -- we talk about country and, um, for us to put this whole country, um, make a generalization and a lot of times I really think it boils down to individuals in that country, um, really crazy people who've gotten into a position of power and -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and yet we talk about the whole country as being against us and -- 
L:  That's true and it's not the whole country it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the people that's in power --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- and, you know, even when we went into Iraq and -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- we didn't occupy it, we were liberating it [LAUGH] even though a lot of people laugh at me whenever I say that, but I was watching them on TV and you know, if we hadn't of won, all those people that were out there cheering and everything -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- if we hadn't of won they -- they would probably be st- still be out there cheering for Saddam -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Hussein --  
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- if he was standing in the middle of it and -- 
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- it's just that they are so repressed that I think they're more so afraid to say what they really, you know, want that they don't know what they want. [NOISE] 
R:  That's possible, mhm.  I think a lot of, um, you know, a lot of what we perceived to be a threat is based in terrorism -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I think that's another example where the country's pol- -- well, the country's overall policies and attitudes don't really reflect how much of a threat they are -- 
L:  No, they don't.
R:  -- or we do to the United States -- 
R:  They don't.
L:  -- um, so, I guess that's an example where you mentioned France, you know, if maybe the whole culture in France might foster that type of, um, individual activity -- 
L:  Mm-kay.
R:  -- that could hurt us.
L:  Right, and -- 
R:  Just because the culture over there is -- is anti American I think in general and it might really give people somewhat of a -- like a pass or permission to -- or given them a feeling that's -- if they're going to engage in that kind of activity that's the location to start from.
L:  [MN] This is true -- 
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- but I just still feel, like, you know, you did it in my backyard -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so now you've got me to stop.  I mean before I was just nice and calm, I was really naive to foreign policies and everything before nine eleven -- 
R:  Well, what state do you live in?
L:  I live in Florida -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I live, like, in a rural area so, you know, there's not a lot of -- of gangs and there's not a lot of violence in our area that we see.  Now, my son lives in New York City and my husband's from New York --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so, it's like a totally different culture whenever we go up there, but I guess, you know, I'm used to being here and you get to thinking that the whole world is like where you're at and it's not. 
R:  Yeah, I agree with that because I live in Michigan and I think that the effects of nine eleven kind of dampened the farther you go from -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- New York city and I -- I mean I am affected by it, but I don't have family members who were directly affected -- 
L:  Right -- 
R:  -- I don't know anybody that was directly affected.
L:  I -- I don't know of anybody that was directly affected either, but I know that I was glued to the TV and it was -- I was just in utter shock, but then to find out that there's countries where people go through this weekly, daily, you know, these things happening for no reason at all.  Somebody walks into a theatre and blows themselves up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean that's a stupid statement to make. [MN] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah [LAUGH] 
L:  You know? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's gotta be another way besides blowing yourself up to make a statement, but unfortunately that, you know, they've got it in their heads that they're going to go to heaven, they're going to get all these blessings and everything and ...
R:  Yeah, and what whatever it is they're trying to tell us, I haven't changed anything --  
L:  [LAUGH] I know -- 
R:  -- it hasn't gotten through to me. 
L:  [LAUGH] I know, it just makes me really hate them more -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, but we have people in our community that our Muslim and we have people in our community here that are foreigners.  I'm not good at looking at somebody and saying, "Oh,, your Pakistan, you're from --" 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  "-- Afghanistan".  I mean I can look at you and I probably wouldn't know if you were from Germany or the United States until you spoke to me and if you spoke American then I guess you're from the United States.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I don't blame these people here, I feel sorry for them -- 
R:  Right, yeah, I do too -- 
L:  -- because, you know, they're -- those people are portraying it for the whole country -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you've got one idiot and all of a sudden it's the whole country that's bad.
R:  I was thinking about another thing when you were talking, um, I'm thiry two years old and I remember when I was, like, a child -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- or maybe, you know, like, early teens and the big thing -- you know, now the big thing to worry about is terrorism and then it was -- the big thing was world war three and nuclear war in Russia -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that was the big scary thing and I remember my parents, my dad saying one time,  "Oh", he said, "I don't think we have to worry about those big powers", he said, "I think some little country in the Middle East is gonna start something and that's what's gonna -- that'll cause world war three" and -- 
L:  More than likely your father was right -- 
R:  Well, it is --  
L:  -- I probably would have to agree with him.
R:  Yes, so twenty years later it's the Middle East. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Exactly.
R:  So, and again -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and no we're not -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- overly concerned with the major powers.
L:  [NOISE] But, see, I'm about ten years older than you, I'm forty three, but when I was in elementary school we had the weekly duck and hide [NOISE] -- 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- syndrome thing, you know, because we were -- we were in Florida and we were afraid that Cuba was going to send an atom bomb -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I mean, if they would've blown us up with an [NOISE] atom bomb, there isn't too much that -- us ducking under our desks really would've done.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] So, it's just, you know, if they're going to do it, they're going to do it, you just have to be right in your life, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to make sure you're doing what you possibly can to keep it, you know, yourself safe I guess.
R:  Mhm, I guess so -- 
L:  But I think your dad was right, it's going to be the Middle East that starts something. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's mainly jealously is the only thing I can think of. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean they have the pow- they -- they need to be able to provide for themselves [NOISE] and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think once the other countries can catch up with us socially I guess, then maybe things would straighten out, but I'm afraid that somebody might come on in with another terrorist act before that does happen.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Did we wander too far off the subject and I'm wondering if our ten minutes are up yet?
R:  Um, one more minute -- 
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I believe. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I don't think it's too far off the subject.
L:  No, I don't think so --
R:  Um, -- 
L:  -- I don't think so either, but you know, I think we're looking at Syria next, I don't think we should go in and try to, you know, overtake them or whatever like we did with this country, but I think turning that little oil pipe off and saying, "Okay, fine, look at -- send those people out of there and we'll turn the oil back on", I think that was a really good move on our part.
R:  Mhm. [MN] [COUGH] I was thinking about what --
