R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Yes.  My name is Nancy, how are you? [NOISE] 
L:  Good, my name is Candice.  I'm doing okay.
R:  And where do you live?
L:  I live in, ah, Louisiana.
R:  Oh, well, I'm in Texas.
L:  In Tex -- well, so we're neighbors.
R:  Yeah, we sure are.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And did she say our subject was would we live somewhere else other than Texas and Louisiana? 
L:  Um.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] We- I don't remember.  Actually I -- I just took some medicine while ago.
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause I have a sore throat so it's like, oh, "Should I accept the call or not?" 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But I went ahead and did anyway. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, we didn't mind at all.  I think it was talking about foreign affairs or something like that.
L:  Right.
R:  And -- and, I think -- 
L:  Do we feel that our safety is jeopardized by it? 
R:  Yeah, or would we live somewhere else?  You know -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  Would we go?  I -- I don't think I would.
L:  No, I don't think I would either.
R:  Because I like [COUGH] -- I like where I live and I -- I know that, you know, you know the weather here changes, you know, day by day.
L:  Right.
R:  But still, you know, we don't have any of that war business to where, you know, somebody nearly bomb us or someone may draw a knife or a gun on us, you know.
L:  That's right.
R:  And -- but, no, I don't -- I don't think that I would, ah, live anywhere else.  What about you?
L:  No, I -- I wouldn't.  I mean, I feel rela- relatively safe.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, living here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, being from Louisiana, I mean, we don't -- I don't live near a sma- -- a big city, I'm kind of in a, you know, smaller area.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So I wouldn't want to live anywhere else.
R:  No, and -- and, you know, I'm -- I'm close to, ah, have you -- I know you've heard of Dallas.
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay, well, I am about thirty miles or so north of Dallas and, ah, close to McKinney.
L:  Yes.  Where exactly do you live?
R:  Well, I live in -- in a little community called Verona.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's in between Princeton and Blue Ridge and it's -- it's just very small.
L:  Very small.
R:  And -- and I live on twenty five acres next to my daughter that has twenty five acres.
L:  Wow.
R:  And so, you know, I -- I'd rather live right here than anywhere.  I mean, you know, we can go to town, it don't take us -- it's about fifteen, twenty minutes to get to a big town.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, you know, [LAUGH] some of those people over there, you know, they were born in Riyadh over there.
L:  Right, so they don't know any different.
R:  Correct.  But then, you know, some of them, they start coming over here and they want us to change the way they are.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I say, "Uh-huh, if you don't like it over here, you go back over, you know, where you belong".
L:  That's right.
R:  And, you know, I just can't understand why we just keep letting 'em come in over here and come in over here.
L:  I know.
R:  And -- and we keep trading with 'em, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, I just, um, -- I just -- I don't see that at all.
L:  Right, me neither.
R:  I mean, it's just wrong.  I mean -- I mean, there's always going to be, um, -- I believe, no peace over there.
L:  Right, I agree. 
R:  Not until the Lord Jesus Christ comes back.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because there's always been a war against two, you know, there was two brothers and -- Jacob and Esau I think and there was always war between them.
L:  Between them.
R:  And -- and their families, you know, when they split, were all family was over here and the family was over here and there always going to be a war over there, so, you know, there's never going to be peace over there.
L:  Right.
R:  So why would I want to leave a nice place over here to go over -- go off over there? 
L:  Over there, no kidding.
R:  And, you know, I -- I wouldn't -- I don't think that right now I would even travel overseas anywhere.  I mean, like in China, there is this, ah, this disease that's going round called SARS.
L:  Right.
R:  Why would we want to go there?
L:  I know.
R:  Why would we want to go over into Jerusalem because they're fighting over there? 
L:  That's right.
R:  And, you know, [LAUGH] why would we want to get on an airplane?  Somebody might be on there wanting to hijack it.
L:  That's it.
R:  And I'd have to knock him down. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I tell you.  Now, what's the name of the little town that you live in? 
L:  I -- I live in Lake Charles. 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It's about, um, it's about two and a half hours from Houston.
R:  Right.
L:  So, and my sister in law lives in Allen, Texas.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So I've been to McKinney before.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's -- 
R:  Oh, goodness gracious, that's -- that's great.  That is great I tell you.  Oh, have you ever travelled, ah, anywhere overseas?
L:  No, I have not been overseas.  I've been on a couple of cruises but, you know, that was going into Mexico.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, and not overseas.
R:  So, did you -- did you, ah, travel from Louisiana over into Mexico?
L:  We, um, we actually flew from Houston to -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  San Diego.
R:  San Diego? 
L:  And then took a cruise from San Diego, California.
R:  Oh.  Well, I'd -- I'd like to go on a cruise but, boy, I tell you what, you know, [LAUGH] if you don't get one that's got all of that stuff in one package -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, you're just currently out of luck somewhere. 
L:  Right.
R:  Because if you get off of the boat to go into town, well, they're going to charge you, you know, for the little trip there.
L:  Exactly, charge you an arm and a leg just to take you, you know -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- just a little ways.
R:  Right, and I -- I can't -- I don't -- I don't want to do that, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  I want to [LAUGH] -- and I don't want to go overseas either.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, you know, there's -- I would like to go either to Africa or Australia.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But I think in -- in Africa, there's fighting over there.
L:  Over there too.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  My grandmom, um, she's seventy four, she's always wanted to take me to, um, Italy, to Sicily because that's where her, you know, her heritage and my heritage is from.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  And we had talked about it earlier this year and, you know, before the war had -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Actually last year.
R:  Right.
L:  And then, you know, she wanted -- she wants to go before she gets too old but, you know, we talked about it and it just wasn't a good time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  To go now, so we're -- we're putting it off until I guess a safer time.
R:  Right, right, because, you know, you just don't know what you're going to get into going -- going -- well, I mean, you would probably travel over there, but then there's something that might happen, um, somebody flare up and you couldn't get your -- your plane back over to the States.
L:  [LAUGH] Right, yeah.
R:  So, you know, it's just war and -- and conflict everywhere that you go, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and it's terrible, because I can remember, you know, when you wanted to go somewhere or just go, you know, you didn't have to worry about somebody who was going to pull a gun on you or -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- shoot you or something like that.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, [LAUGH] and they -- they were talking about foreign affairs.  Now, don't we -- we trade with, ah, the people, um, see, China -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Taiwan, Hong Kong.  We -- and then we get oil from, ah, Saudi Arabia.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, we've got oil over here in the United States, why don't we drill for oil over here? 
L:  For our own oil.
R:  Correct. Then we don't have to ship it.
L:  Instead of being dependent on someone else.
R:  Right, and I -- and I haven't understood that to save our life, you know, for them to have all of it because I think they said up here at New York City out in the harbor there, there's oil.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, you know, somebody says, "Well, that costs too much to drill for it", well, my word, look what we're paying for it 'cause it's overseas.
L:  Right. I can't imagine it -- it costing us more to do it locally than to do it, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Overseas.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I -- I don't understand and I think -- I think up in, um, oh, heck, Wyoming and places like that, I think there's -- there's oil up there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, ah, they just -- they just don't want to drill for it.
L:  Right.
R:  They want to still trade with the foreign people, you know.  They gripe and belly ache about it but they still --
L:  But they still do it.
R:  Yeah, they still do it, you know.  I -- I just go mm mm mm.  [PAUSE]
L:  Yeah, I understand it.
R:  Yeah, I know it, I know it.  But, you know, ah, people -- let's see, Palestine, [inaudible] that's over there in -- in the fighting area too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ha, India, they've had some fightings over there too.
L:  Over there too.
R:  So nearly everywhere that you look, you know, is -- is -- is somebody -- is -- there's a conflict somewhere.
L:  Right.
R:  Mm.  Well, I don't know about this.  I -- I -- I just say, let's just not be trading with 'em.
L:  That's right.
R:  Let's don't bring 'em off over here, don't let 'em come into our country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because we see what has happened when, ah, you know, with the New York thing.
L:  Right.
R:  Because they were over here and they were spying and they were, you know, getting training how to, you know, fly airplanes.
L:  Yeah, that's unbelievable.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I -- I just don't know why we said, "Yeah, you all just come on all over here".  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I can't understand that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mm mm mm. [PAUSE] Do you have a family?
L:  I do.  I have one, um, I have a son that's seven.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  And my husband and I, um, have been married for nine years.
R:  Nine years.
L:  Yes, Ma'am.
R:  Huh.
L:  So.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I have -- I have three kids and twelve grandchildren.
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
