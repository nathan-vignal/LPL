L:  Hello, this is Robert Daw[?].
R:  He- hello, my name's Heather Williams.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] This is kind of interesting.
L:  Yes, this is the first time I've been on one, you too?
R:  Yeah, it has -- yeah, one of my friends told me about it, I said okay, "Ten bucks". [LAUGH]
L:  Ha, well, um, and the -- and the subject is computers and education.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I have, ah, -- I have, ah, some grandchildren that are home schooled and, ah, my daughter has home schooled them for years but, ah, just during the past year now, they have picked up some, um, ah, computer programmes she has bought and uses for them especially the older one, almost exclusively.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, to learn from for various subjects and, ah, they go on there and -- and read things and then have -- have, ah, tests and it, you know, it checks their answers, tells them if their answers are wrong and, um, --
R:  Wow.
L:  It works pretty good on that system.
R:  I have -- I'm sorry, go ahead.
L:  Have you heard of anything like that?  Are you familiar with any of that?
R:  Well, I'm familiar -- I -- I mean, I have a two year old, so I have a lot of the preschool things for my son to use on the computer, and I am on the computer a lot.  My husband is actually going to night school for computer technology and a friend of mine goes -- she -- she's a stay at home mom with three young kids so she goes to college over the computer.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  Which -- which I think is a really neat thing to do.  She can just go on when the kids are in bed and -- and download her whole lessons and do everything on line which is very convenient for a mom in that situation.  Her husband is in Iraq.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So she can't leave and go to school. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ah, sometimes I think maybe that we use computers too much though.  I taught in, ah, to -- ear- early childhood education for a number of years and it just seems like the kids would tell me, "Oh, I did this on the computer, I did that on the computer".  On the computer they're always attached to some kind of box, the computer or the TV.  Nobody goes to the library any more.
L:  Yeah, that's one of the very negative things that -- I have exceptional -- I have a granddaughter that, ah, goes to public school -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, and the teacher encourages them to take a -- a reading book home every night and she does.  She brings it home and reads it, sometimes read it two or three times, just loves to read.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  I think -- I think that's exceptions.  Now, um, they were involved in the computer school last year, ah, in Pennsylvania.  I don't know where you are.
R:  Yeah, I'm in Pennsylvania as well.
L:  Your -- and, ah, they were involved with a computer school but the school had, ah, problems getting reimbursement from the state and had all kinds of financial problems.
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  But -- but there were two girls and -- and they both had their own computer and, ah, all kinds of programmes to do things and this was supposed to be a computer school that lasted for twelve years and went on, but it got -- it got so bad as far as, ah, a lot of the school districts were trying to withhold the money and -- and, ah, not sending it through to them so that they just, ah, were not working properly so my daughter put those two in public school now.
R:  Oh, wow, that's -- that's a shame.
L:  But -- but --
R:  I remember -- I remember when I was in high school, I mean, we had a computer lab but we weren't allowed to touch the computers.  
L:  Ha.
R:  It was locked all the time and, I mean, I've -- I've only been out of high school, wow, I guess ten years now, so it -- it has come so far from what I've heard from my friend's younger sisters.  They're on the computer so much and they can do all kinds of things, and our school was very basic, DOS thing -- you think DOS which you don't even use now any more, the -- the normal platform is Windows.
L:  Right, I never even, ah -- I never had a computer until it became, ah, Windows, so I don't even know how to use DOS or how it works.
R:  Yeah, I know and then taught us this stuff that was completely useless.  We were -- we were barely allowed to use the computers back then.  The two kids to a computer and it was just ridiculous and now it just seems like, you know, I -- I don't know how it is now in the public schools but it seems like they don't get enough computer time, but on the other hand, if you use it all the time, you're not using all your resources.  I mean, just going outside, especially for younger children, just go outside and learn science that way.  Look at the bugs, look at the trees, grow the beans yourself instead of, you know, doing little computer games and stuff all the time for it.
L:  Yeah, and I don't know how that's going to impact my two grandsons because they -- they are home schooled and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, in their house, they have three computers. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Two --two -- two children, three computers and, ah -- oh, my wife just said they have four now.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And -- and they have -- ah, they do school work on there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but they also have all kinds of games on all of them and --
R:  Yeah.  Well, I'm sure the school district probably has requirements that -- that your daughter or daughter in law, I'm not sure if you said which -- 
L:  Well, they have to -- 
R:  -- has to go through.
L:  Yeah, they have to take, ah, a test, you know, every year, but they -- they show up proficient in that as far as that goes, you know. 
R:  Well, that's wonderful.
L:  High proficiency but -- but, like you said, ah, I don't know about the reading and libraries or, ah, going to suffer from it I'm sure.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, all the local libraries here in my area are very small, not very -- not very -- used very frequently.  I mean, the largest one is -- what -- what I would call still very small in the area that we're in.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the books are so old.  I mean, half the time they are trying to sell all the old books but I don't see very many new books.  The children's section is always, you know, great, but the rest of the library is kind of pitiful.
L:  Uh-huh.  You know, I do have some friends.  Ah, I'm a retired minister for one thing and, ah, I have some friends that are pastors in this area that are not ordained yet, have not finished their studies.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they are -- they are doing their studying on line, ah, -- 
R:  Yeah, that's pretty neat.
L:  Do a -- yeah, that's -- I think it's Nazarene Bible College in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But --
R:  Yeah, I've heard of a lot of -- I -- I mean, I think it's wonderful for, like, for college students, especially for adults who are going back to school or completing their education or for instance your friends who -- who can continue to go to their jobs or continue to parent their children and still go to college.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and do those things.
L:  Yeah, this guy is a pastor in the church and -- and his wife is working at least a part-time job and -- and he's -- he's baby sitting the children when she's working.
R:  He is not baby sitting his own children. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Sorry, it's one of my pet peeves. 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I guess he isn't -- I -- you're right.
R:  [LAUGH].  Oh, no, yeah, like I said, one of my friends is doing the same thing and, like, with three kids it's a lot har- easier to do it that way now that that opportunity is available to them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, like I said, my husband is going to ITT Tech.  He's learning computer network systems and he does some of his -- he had to buy a laptop just for school so he could take it back and forth to work and do all his -- he's -- he's been doing programmes and writing programmes and he keeps coming back to me and saying, "I just found out this about Windows" and he'll tell me all the little nasty little things that are going on and, "We're going to run this computer system now and we're going to run this and through this server and do this to it, you know.  Everybody can't see what we're doing" and the more he learns about Microsoft and the whole way everything works, makes me nervous.
L:  Uh-huh.  And -- and there's so much out there to learn too.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I mean -- 
R:  I mean, oh, it just kills me the amount of information he comes home with.
L:  I -- I suppose one of the, ah, drawbacks and that's what they want us to talk about too, is the fact that, ah, you can -- you can learn what you want to learn.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But you might zero in on certain things and certain areas and not necessarily learn everything that you need to learn.
R:  Sure.  And, you know what, there's a lot of misinformation out there on the Internet too.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I haven't thought about that, but that's right.
R:  You just put in one, you know, whatever you want to learn about and -- into your search engine and it will come up with like, three thousand pages.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And you come -- put race in there and you'll come up with anything that has the word race in it almost, so you could come up with web pages for members of the Ku Klux Klan, you could come up with web pages for all kinds of things.  I mean, there's children who -- who are, you know, learn how to build bombs on line.
L:  Mhm, yes.
R:  So there's lots of ways to get misinformation and that is definitely a concern with -- with children and teenagers that you have to monitor what they're accessing, what they're learning and make sure that what they're learning is what their teacher intended. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, that's right.  Ah, I know I have researched, ah, cancer for instance.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And --
