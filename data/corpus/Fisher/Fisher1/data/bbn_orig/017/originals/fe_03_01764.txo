L:  Melissa Alexander.
R:  Hi, I'm Robyn.
L:  Okay, nice to meet you.
R:  You too.  This is very interesting.  Have you done this before? 
L:  No, this is my first time.
R:  Me too.
L:  My first time.  But, ah, the question was do -- do we think any other country is a threat to the US.
R:  Right.
L:  I do.
R:  Ah, what country do you think? 
L:  I definitely think, um, Syria is a threat to the US and I'm kind of leaning towards Russia because I -- I think Syria is into the, ah, to the, ah, the chemical and the biological warfare.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think Russia has dealt a lot with, um, Iraq and Saddam and I think that they know a lot of Saddam's secrets and I think that, um -- I think [PAUSE] also have some weapons of mass destruction too.
R:  I think you are probably right.  Um, I never thought about Russia being a -- a particular threat -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- only in that, um, again they seem to be opposing the, ah, lifting of sanctions, you know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to -- from Iraq but then they say that's all, ah, financially motivated --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I'm not sure about that.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And, um, Syria is always, um, --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- is -- is always a little bit scary a long with a couple of the African --  
L:  Yes.
R:  -- um, countries which I think could possibly also --  
L:  Yes.
R:  -- um, pose a threat at some time in the future.
L:  I think so too.
R:  Ah, I think that, ah, anyone that we find is harboring any of the fugitives --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, should be considered probably as a threat.
L:  Yes.
R:  And, ah, anyone, um, who -- well actually, you know, I -- I don't -- I don't really feel secure even with Iraq at this point because of the --  
L:  No.
R:  -- the Shiite, ah, um, demonstrations that are going on right now --  
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and the potential of Iran and Iraq to end up being, ah, more of a coalition than the US and Iraq is still --  
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- out there, you know.
L:  So Iraq is still -- it's still a threat, there's still a threat there.
R:  Right.  Um, do you -- um, do you relate any country with, um, the, ah, al Qaeda any more?
L:  Ah, I think, um, -- I think -- I think that would be either Afghanistan or Iran.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the question still is that we have not been able to locate Osama Bin Laden.
R:  That's true.
L:  You know, and -- and that he's still very much a threat to the United States and I feel that, um, I feel that Afghanistan and Iran is still a threat to the United States and I know Iran is still, ah, very much upset with the United States because back during the Desert Storm, um, um, how the United States supposedly helped Iraq.
R:  Right.
L:  Against Iran.
R:  Right. 
L:  So, I know -- I know Iran still has -- has some, you know, some big problems with the United States and I'm thinking that probably one of the reasons that, ah, that attacks happened on nine -- nine eleven, I think it just took that long for them to plan a terrorist attack against the United States and -- and execute it.
R:  So, you think it might have originated in Iran as well as -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- with al Qae- -- al Qaeda.
L:  Yes.  That's what I really feel.
R:  I think, you know, you just brought up a pretty good point though.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Also when you mentioned Russia, I never thought of it before but --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but of course, ah, there's Afghanistan versus Russia and --  
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and since we are now in -- in Afghanistan and Russia has always, um, had its problems with Afghanistan then that makes it a little shaky in that area too.
L:  It very much does.
R:  Yeah, I never thought about it that way. 
L:  It very much does.
R:  But I somehow or another, you know, most of the time I -- I consider Run- , ah, Russia pretty benign, only what I don't consider benign is, um, their, um, what they call their, um, their Russian Mafia and --  
L:  Okay.
R:  -- people who are trading in all kinds of, ah, black market, um, weapons and things --  
L:  Exactly. 
R:  -- since the -- since the republic broke up.
L:  Exactly, and I also -- ah, I also had a little bit of concern with, um, -- with one of the -- a couple of the Asian countries which I know still -- I mean, even since the Vietnam war they're still not really right with the United States.
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  And I feel, I know, I think it's Japan that, um, have been banned from using, um, weapons in war.
R:  Absolutely.  Um, -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I lived in Japan and for some time.
L:  Did you, okay? 
R:  And they're very, very, um, opposed to anything nuclear whatsoever.
L:  Are they?
R:  To the point that when they suspect that there is a -- a -- a ship coming into Japan and, even though we're --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- we're allies and we are there both to protect them and their -- their -- their military is really -- it's really a defensive force.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, when- whenever there's a suspected nuclear anything --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in port or coming into port there's huge demonstrations -- 
L:  Is there? 
R:  -- against the American bases, yeah. 
L:  Wow.
R:  Um, which is -- it's -- you know, it's the -- the wounds of World War Two --  
L:  Okay.
R:  -- have not gone away by any means.
L:  No, they haven't.
R:  And the, ah, the fears are there but I think, you know, we're -- um, I mean if China wasn't so busy dealing with SARS right now, we would be wanting --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to keep an eye -- oh, that brings up --  
L:  Yes.
R:  -- that brings up North Korea.
L:  Yes, it does.
R:  Do you think they are a threat? 
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yes, I do, I think there's a chance that North Korea is a threat.  Um, I heard -- I heard during one of the CNN broadcasts then, um, ah, since the war has been going on that the, um, I don't know what they -- I know it is not the President, it might be the Prime Minister, whatever, over there really opposed to this war.
R:  Right.
L:  And the -- the protesting I heard really just got pretty much outrageous over there.  Of course, you know, the protesting everywhere has been --  
R:  True.
L:  -- pretty bad but I -- I think North Korea may be a threat, I do.  You know, my -- me and my husband were talking about this and my husband was telling me their -- most -- all the countries really don't like the United States.
R:  Right, right.
L:  I mean --  
R:  They consider us imperialist and --  
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and, um, a threat to their way of life.
L:  And they feel that we're -- we're kind of bold in our actions.
R:  Exactly, that we are much too aggressive and --  
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- and we are trying to push our ideals on them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, it's -- it's that we are arrogant and -- and that.
L:  Yes, that's what they think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's what they think and a lot of them really don't like us for those reasons, you know.  But I really feel that the intent was right and I think we did the right thing as far as somebody had to step in and try to get under control Saddam and his regime.
R:  Well, in twenty twenty hindsight I'd -- I'd go along with that.
L:  Yeah, I agree for the reasons because I believe over there, um, with his dictatorship and how -- I mean, they just kill people, just, you know, for whatever reason, the torture chambers, the -- the rape room.
R:  I think that goes on in a lot of countries and --  
L:  I think it does too.
R:  -- the reason we chose there is because we were hoping to end up with an alliance -- 
L:  With -- 
R:  -- between, um, -- with Iraq and I -- I have some doubts whether that is going to be what comes out of it.
L:  I don't think it is either.
R:  Um, I think we may, ah, -- we may end up with an alliance similar to Saudi Arabia where -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- they -- they do their own thing but, ah, we have some oil interests that, you know, in the end.
L:  Exactly.  
R:  And that -- 
L:  You see that brings up another topic of the conversation is, um, a -- a lot of people believe that United States or Bush is in it for the oil, you know, the oil.
R:  Well, you know, I don't trust him personally.
L:  No, neither do I, neither do I, [LAUGH] neither do I.
R:  And, ah, I don't trust him in the least or any of his -- his, ah, ah, people surrounding him, I really don't.
L:  No.
R:  I really think that -- that he comes from the old school where the people are ignorant and the -- that the, um, the business interests are really what -- what means more than the individual and -- and -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- I don't trust him at all.
L:  I don't either.
R:  Um, but on the other hand, um, -- and -- and my big fear --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of course, which was not -- did not come to pass --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- was that as soon as we got involved in Iraq that, ah, that Israel would end up getting involved and I'm glad that didn't happen.
L:  Me too.
R:  We would have had a very big mess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was really impressed -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, at the fact that they -- they knocked out anything within range of Israel right away.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  Or it would have been a horrible disaster with so many of the countries then getting involved.
L:  Involved, yeah, and you know what, I mean we can't fight and beat everybody.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, we can't fight 'em all so I'm glad, I'm glad that Israel --  
R:  This may well back fire, I think.  You know, I mean, if this turns into another, um, ah, Shiite Arab state it's gonna be a big --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's gonna be a big, um, let down for, um, a l- -- a lot of -- 
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  -- the people, a lot of the world and we are now committed to rebuilding so -- 
L:  Yep. 
R:  -- are we going to go in there and rebuild our enemies --
