R:  Hi.
L:  How are you?  Who am --
R:  And who is this?
L:  -- I talking with?
R:  I'm Ginger Davis and I live in Georgia.
L:  Hi, Ginger.  I'm Pat [inaudible].  I live in San Antonio, Texas.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Texas.
L:  How are you?
R:  Oh, I'm fine.  Cooking dinner.  Well, cooking supper for you Southerner like me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, we're supposed to talk about other countries [LAUGH].
L:  Other countries that are a threat to the nation.
R:  Could be a threat.
L:  Could be a threat.
R:  Oh, goodnight.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] I don't know, maybe Syria [LAUGH].
L:  Uh, yes.  I think Syria and, um, [NOISE] you know -- you know, as far as the topics I never thought "Oh, this will probably be a topic" but I've been two -- I've done two other calls --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I haven't had this topic so I was "Oh, good I haven't gotten it" [LAUGH].
R:  [MN] Oh, I've had exercise and seasonal allergies [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  How funny.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Gosh, mine were, um -- it was, yeah, the other day.  It was just the other day.  It was about, um, censorship on TV and --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  -- and then the other one -- jeeze, I don't even remember what it was about.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, the public schools and education.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, boy --
L:  So ...
R:  -- be glad they didn't give me that one.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  I had a mouthful to say about that.
R:  I would have too because my kids -- oh boy, my kids go to a private school but anyway, we're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- supposed to talk about --
L:  Anyway --
R:  -- foreign relations.  Gee,  what's there to say?  I think Syria's harboring some, uh, criminals there.
L:  Criminals, right.
R:  Some terrorists.
L:  Yes.  Um --
R:  I think that, uh, maybe Saddam might be over there in Syria --
L:  Yeah.  Um, I don't know --
R:  -- if he's alive.
L:  -- who knows if he's even still alive.
R:  Who knows?
L:  We haven't heard anything and it's -- you know, the news now, they're not covering it as --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- intently and closely as, you know, last -- what two weeks ago --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- three weeks ago.  So, we don't -- you know, we're not keeping in -- being kept abreast of what's really going on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- now. It's kinda scary.
R:  You know, their -- their ambassador -- have you seen the -- the Syrian ambassador that talks on the -- on TV all the time, that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that goofy man.  I honestly -- I don't -- I -- I -- surely the government doesn't tell him everything.
L:  Right.
R:  The Syrian government probably doesn't tell him anything so he probably --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- thinks they aren't harboring any terrorists, but I bet they are.
L:  Oh, I'm sure they are.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I'm sure.  Hm.
R:  Because why would those peop- those guys that they've caught been headed towards the Syrian border?
L:  Right.  I know.
R:  I mean, come on.
L:  They've been catching, uh, quite a few --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- too many but that's good.
R:  I know, it's kinda scary.
L:  But as far as any other countries or --
R:  Hm.  I don't know.
L:  -- I don't --
R:  Korea, maybe.
L:  Korea.
R:  What is it, North Korea, or which one's the bad one?  I don't remember. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I -- [LAUGH]
R:  Isn't that bad?  Like which one's the bad one?  North Korea or South Korea?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think it's North, isn't it?  I don't know.
L:  I think so.  Um, yeah they were talking about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the nuclear bombs or --
R:  Or maybe --
L:  -- production.
R:  -- China.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Any communist country is probably going to be a threat.  
L:  Oh, yes [LAUGH].
R:  Any communist --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- a country of any size.
L:  That's true.
R:  I don't know if we'd worry about Cuba or not.
L:  No.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, cool, honey.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you have any kids?
R:  Uh, six.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What age?
R:  Thirteen, eleven, eight, five, four and two [LAUGH].
L:  Wow [LAUGH].
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  Five, four and two so o- obviously you probably stay home with the little ones.
R:  Oh, yes [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, how did you find out about this study?
L:  Um, actually I do mystery shopping.
R:  Me, too.
L:  Yes?  I love it.
R:  The Wilers[?] Group or something?
L:  Well, I -- I -- I've seen her website and I -- I get on that often but I -- I subscribe to Money and Shopping.  Have you ever --
R:  Yeah.  I've -- yeah, I know what that is.  I haven't subscribed to it but --
L:  And, um --
R:  -- I know what it is.
L:  Well, apparently recently they raised the rates so but I, um --
R:  Yeah, they did.
L:  -- joined when it was, like, fifteen bucks.
R:  Oh, yeah.  It's more than that now.
L:  Twenty bucks.
R:  It's like thirty now, I think.
L:  Yes, so I did that and then I've -- I've been really lucky. [NOISE] I did some apartment shops and they paid like twenty five bucks a -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a shop and so I've been, you know, keeping busy, although it's kinda hard 'cause I need to get pretty organized 'cause --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- sometimes I forget --
R:  I'm not very organized.
L:  -- some shops.  Like I forgot to do a Subway the other day and I was like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- "Oh, rats".
R:  Oh.  I got -- I had a call a little while ago about a shop and it -- they wanted me to go to th- this mall that's about twenty miles away and do -- evaluate, like, three restaurants and five stores or so --
L:  Oh, really.
R:  -- and I'm going, "Come on" and she says, "Oh, well it's easy.  You just need to interact and evaluate your interaction with the salesperson in each store" and I said, "How much are you gonna pay me to -- to all these stores?" "Twenty one dollars".  I said, "Uh-uh".  That's not worth --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- twenty-one dollars for me to spend --
L:  That's it for --
R:  -- half a day in a mall.
L:  For how many shops?
R:  I think it was maybe seven or eight different --
L:  That's nuts.
R:  -- stores.  Twent- No, it was twenty-one dollars total, not each.
L:  Total?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's what I'm saying, That's nuts [LAUGH].
R:  I know.  I said, "Well you'll have to find somebody else.  I'm so sorry".  That's not enough to get me to do that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But she was understanding and now -- this was Bestmark.
L:  [NOISE] And what -- what did you go through?
R:  Huh?
L:  What, um -- what, um, organization did you go through to do that?
R:  Just -- just Bestmark.  I mean, I'm -- I'm registered with them so they send me emails whenever they have something.
L:  What is it?
R:  It's Bestmark, B.E.S. --
L:  Bestmark?
R:  -- T.M.A.R.K.  Uh-huh.
L:  You got their website?  Bestmark dot com?
R:  I -- you know, I don't remember.
L:  Hm.
R:  [LAUGH] It may be.  You probably just do an, um, online search for Bestmark --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- mystery shopping and then come up with it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I get calls all the time.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You see I don't get calls.  I ha- you see the thing with Money and Shopping is, you now, they post them online and so, um, you know, if you're always constantly on the computer --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it pops up, you know, it's first come, first served.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you know, I work, you know, part-time so at work, when I -- you know, I'm not at a computer all the time so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't get a lot of the -- the shops because, you know, someone's already subscribed to that one.
R:  Mhm.  Well, I have a cable connection -- cable, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- Internet connection --
L:  Yeah, so do I.
R:  -- so I'm always on --
L:  Uh huh.
R:  -- and as soon as I get emails, they pop up and -- and then I'll go look and see if there's anything interesting --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so ...
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, if you're not on all the time, it would be rather difficult to be the first one to respond.
L:  Mhm.  Yes, it is.
R:  I get -- oh, I get calls all the time.
L:  Really?
R:  Oh, yes and I turn down a lot of them because I just -- you know, I've got six kids.  I don't have time.  I do the ones that pay well.
L:  Yeah.  Which, which --
R:  If you're not going to pay me, I'm not gonna do it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I did some Holiday and Express shops, too.
R:  Oh.  How -- are those hard --
L:  No, not  --
R:  -- because I've not done hotel ones yet?
L:  You know, those were easier to do than, um, [NOISE] than the -- the apartment shops.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Oh, the apartment shops were just -- it was like --
R:  I do not do --
L:  -- three pages.
R:  -- apartment shops anymore because I don't like having to lie.  You just flat out have to lie.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And I'm just like "Uh-uh, I don't think so".  I mean how do I lie?  I'm -- I drive a fifteen passenger van.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have six kids.  How am I gonna lie about needing a two bedroom apartment? [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Yeah, that's true.
R:  I mean, come on, you know.  But I did one apartment shop and I swear I'd never do another one.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And they paid like fifty bucks but, mhm, it was a pain.  No way.
L:  Yeah.  The -- God, those forms were just so long --
R:  They are very long.
L:  -- and I did four of 'em and it was, you know, nice money but ...
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  But the Holiday and Express ones were -- were good.  I mean they comped -- they reimbursed me for the stay --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and gave me like twenty bucks or --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I mean, it really wasn't much but I mean --
R:  Anything above zero if you're getting a free night at a hotel is --   Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah but see that was the nice part about it, is you know it was a free stay so my husband --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- and I enjoyed that [LAUGH].
R:  What do you have to do?  Do you just -- see I've never talked to anybody who actually did one so you're my first.  You can tell me, what do you have to do?
L:  When you go in you have to, you know, check out the -- the -- the -- the facility and make sure --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- it's clean and you know --
R:  But this is not something that mo- that any normal person who's really do -- just staying there wouldn't do, right?
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.
R:  So, you're not really standing out?
L:  No, but you do have to ask for, like, an extra towel.
R:  I'd do that anyway [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, you had to ask one of the -- the maids, you know, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if they could bring you an extra towel --
R:  Sure,
L:  -- or something or toothpaste or something like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's really it.  I mean, you have to go down and have breakfast and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, just -- you know, what we do usually and --
R:  They reimburse you for that, too.
L:  Yeah, well no, not the break- the breakfast is complimentary.
R:  Oh, that's right.
L:  It's continental.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, so that was pretty [NOISE] cool.
R:  There have been many, many hotel shops that have come up that have been nearby us --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I've thought, "Well, that'd be a nice little weekend getaway" [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I haven't taken any of them yet so I may -- I may do that now that I know it's not really that difficult [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, they're -- they're -- the forms are just so easy --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- compared to the -- you've done an apartment shop so you know how detailed and lengthy those were.
R:  Oh, yes.  Nothing like that?
L:  No, nothing.  Nothing at all.
R:  Oh, wow.  Well, cool.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  We ...
