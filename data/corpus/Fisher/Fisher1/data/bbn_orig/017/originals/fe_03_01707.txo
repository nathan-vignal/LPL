R:  [NOISE] Hi, I'm Cathy. [NOISE]
L:  Hello, I'm Lisa. [PAUSE]
R:  [NOISE] Are we supposed to just talk, I guess?
L:  Yeah, I guess so. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I thought they would come back on and say something.
L:  Oh, uh-uh.  No.  So, do you think any other countries poses a threat --
R:  Um --
L:  -- a- -- they said to us directly?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  I -- I don't know.  Um, I guess Iraq could.  I d- -- I don't think it does directly, though, anymore.
L:  No, uh-uh.
R:  Um, I think North Korea poses a threat to us.
L:  Well, I thought of them too, but I don't -- I think geographically they -- they really don't, though.
R:  No --
L:  N- --
R:  -- as far as, like, how far away these countries are.
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I don't think that really any country --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- poses a serious threat to us.
L:  Right.
R:  Um --
L:  And I think, I mean, as far as worldwide though, I think [MN] those two, well, Iran and North Korea and Syria, we need to watch them.
R:  Yeah.  But, like you said, a- -- with them being as far away as they are, the only thing they could do is send their people and infiltrate our country, you know, like the terrorists did.
L:  That's -- yeah, that's true.
R:  I mean, I guess there is a threat from countries like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But as far them attacking us, I don't see it as a threat.
L:  Right, and I think we have that under control now, too, though --
R:  Yeah, I do.
L:  As far as getting rid of the potential terrorists.
R:  I think we have them scared.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm not sure that --
L:  And see, they -- they're without a leader now, too.
R:  Yeah.  They don't have Saddam helping them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He was a big part of it.
L:  I sure hope we find that guy. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, me too.
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm glad it's seeming to come to an end.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm thankful for those people too.
R:  Oh yeah, it's wonderful.
L:  Yeah, I couldn't imagine living -- I'm glad I don't have to even try to imagine living like that.
R:  Oh, I know.  I -- I couldn't have imagined --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- living under that.
L:  Plus --
R:  But I -- the funny thing is, if you turn this around, how many countries we threaten.
L:  What do you mean?
R:  As far a- -- not that we are, you know, giving them a threat.
L:  Right, but that they --
R:  But I --
L:  -- probably are watching us, wondering.
R:  Yeah.  I think we're more of a threat to every other country.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Than any country of us.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  You know, I think if the British came -- if -- I think a -- the only country I think that we would even be remotely fearful from is maybe the Brits. [NOISE]
L:  But we --
R:  If they had done some, you know, if -- if we ticked them off in some way.
L:  Oh, you think they would, um, give us a fight?
R:  I think they would fight us.
L:  I mean, they have the warfare or whatever?
R:  Yeah.  I -- I think that they could fight us.  I don't think that they could win.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think we've proved that we could win, in the end.
L:  Yeah.  You gotta wait a minute please.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, uh, I --
L:  Well --
R:  -- I'm not sure.
L:  Yeah, and I -- I guess, you know, y- you're talking about, you know, the countries think of us as a threat, probably especially now so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- since we initiated this w- war.
R:  Yeah. I -- I think --
L:  And that --
R:  -- that other countries look at us --
L:  -- that was a turning point in history, too.
R:  Yes, it was.  And I think that we are more of a threat to every other country than any country is a threat to us.
L:  Right.  [SIGH] Yeah, I'm trying to think of -- about, um, Russia, if they're -- I don't know where they're at right now.
R:  [SIGH] I don't know.  I -- I think they're kinda just trying to stay away from it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think they could be a threat to us --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause they didn't like what we did.  But again, I don't feel -- I think they could maybe hit us with something.
L:  Right.
R:  But I don't think they could win a war either.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, you know, I -- there's always threats.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  You know, I mean, [NOISE] any way you look at it, another country could come in and do something to us, but I don't think that any other country is strong enough to actually defeat us in any way.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, they could do like they did with the World Trade Center or, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- some other terroristic attack type thing from another country but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I -- I don't feel that any of them are strong enough to [SIGH] [MN] to come in here and -- and come at us in a battle and win.
L:  Yeah, especially since, um, I think, Runsfield[?] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- didn't he head up the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- war?  H- -- I mean, he's talking, like, you know, we can [MN] go to war at two fronts, talking about if --
R:  Syria.
L:  Yeah --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- was wanting to start something. [LAUGH]  Not a problem. [LAUGH]
R:  Not a problem.  We have plenty of soldiers.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, they are very --
L:  And the technology.
R:  -- I think our government's cocky.  But, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we -- we did go over there and shell --
L:  Yeah.
R:  My God, we went over and b- beat a country.
L:  We're just confident, maybe. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  You know, they, ah, Iraq was supposed to have the third biggest army ...
L:  Really?
R:  In the world.  That was supposed to be the third largest.
L:  Wow.  Well, I guess I'm thinking that it's such a small country --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I guess that's all he -- he poured into that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- his military, that was where h- he spent his money.
R:  And we beat them in twenty eight days.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you know, I think there's a reason that we're so confident.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I see your point, yeah, the third biggest army on --
R:  And, yeah --
L:  -- military and we beat 'em in twenty eight days.
R:  We beat 'em in twenty eight days.
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  I don't know.  I'm not sure who has the second largest.  It could be, ah, I think it might be -- it's either Russia or Brits --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- have the second largest.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, [MN] I -- I think that it's funny though that all the people that slammed President Bush for doing what he did, I notice a lot of them are changing their tune now.
L:  That's right.  And want to get a -- in on the piece of the pie.
R:  You know, they're, like, "Oh, you know, maybe it was a good idea".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's, like, "Oh".
L:  What -- yeah.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I wonder how, um ... Blair's popularity rating is doing?  Have you first --
R:  Yeah, notice they haven't talked about that at all?
L:  Okay.
R:  They've dropped it completely, how, you know, for days, while we were at war,  that's all they talked about, was his popularity rate had dropped so much.
L:  To -- yeah.
R:  Since the war has, you know, somewhat ended, the fighting parts have ended --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they haven't --
L:  I wonder --
R:  -- mentioned it, so I'm sure that it must have gone back up.
L:  Yeah, I hope so.
R:  Me too, for his sake.
L:  That was real gutsy of him --
R:  Yes, it was --
L:  -- as well.
R:  -- to stay in behind us like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And Australia's got, um, leader too.  He sent two thousand troops.
L:  Who?
R:  The Australians.
L:  When?
R:  In the very beginning.
L:  The, um -- oh, really?  I didn't -- I didn't even know that.
R:  Yeah.  He was another one that was gutsy.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  You know, he stood up to them pe- -- and his own people, I mean, they barricaded him in his house, they were so angry.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And, uh, he did it anyways.  He said, "That's the right thing to do and we have to do it".
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Done.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But, uh, you know, I took -- I -- I -- I agree.  I think it took a lot of guts for the people that stood behind us --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with the rest of the world not wanting to do it.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] But, uh --
L:  But, I mean, that was -- I mean, I can see clearly, as I'm sure you can too, that the UN, they didn't hold up to their end of the bargain.  It wasn't Bush walking out on them.
R:  No, they walked out on us.
L:  Yeah, they walked out on us. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, they really did.
L:  [NOISE] Caleb, I am on the phone.  You're going to have to wait a minute.
R:  They weren't for it at all.
L:  Yeah.  But that's --
R:  They didn't want to back it or nothing.
L:  Yes.  Gosh, I do hope that [MN] we do f- -- or they find those, [NOISE] um --
R:  Saddam?
L:  Well, and the weapons of [NOISE] mass destruction, the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- biological warfare. [NOISE]
R:  Me too, I hope they find it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They said that they buried it everywhere.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] And I wonder if somehow they could have m- moved it out of the country during --
R:  They could have.
L:  -- that time.
R:  [NOISE] Well, they, you know, we talked about it for weeks, that we were coming.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I don't think it would have been that hard to move it.
L:  That's true, I didn't think of that.
R:  [COUGH] You know, we said over and over that we were going to come if they didn't do this and didn't do that [NOISE] and, uh, you know --
L:  Well --
R:  -- so they had plenty of opportunity.
L:  Which -- and all those, um, suits and the m- masks --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, that just clearly points to it, that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he does [SIGH] he did have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- something like that.
R:  Oh, yeah.  [NOISE] I -- I can't imagine that he didn't have them. 
L:  Right.
R:  Well, my biggest fear is --
L:  Because he already used some too, to kill -- to kill --
R:  Kill his own people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just hope they find it, because I'm afraid if they don't find it, people could come back.
L:  Right, it could -- and it very well may be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the wrong hands now.
R:  Yep.  You know, if they did bury it there and somebody knows where it is --
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  [NOISE] You know, or that th- they [NOISE] put it in a different country.
L:  Yeah.  Are they, um, I haven't heard lately, I can't remember who was the last one, but have you heard --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um --
L:  -- any, uh, thing else about the -- are there any others from that, um, deck of cards surrendering?
R:  I think they found [NOISE] -- I think they found eleven people so far.
L:  Wow.
R:  [NOISE] So, out of fifty five, that's not too bad, though.
L:  No, it isn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah.
R:  It's only been a couple of days since they put them cards out.
L:  That's right.
R:  So, eleven days isn't too bad.  I'm afraid that would probably be our biggest threat.  If there is a country that's going to threaten us --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's going to be the country that they shipped those biologi- biological weapons and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- chemical warfare and -- 'cause if we're going to be threatened, it's going to be in some way like that.
L:  Right.
R:  So, it could be Syria.  If they did take it to Syria, then Syria could honestly pose a threat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause if they came in here and released biological weapons into our country, [NOISE] that would be serious trouble. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] That's right --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and we're not -- we just don't
