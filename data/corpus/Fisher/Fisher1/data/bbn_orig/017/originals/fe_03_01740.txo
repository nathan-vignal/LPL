L:  My name is Dawn Hunt.
R:  Hi, my name is Bridget.
L:  Hi, Bridget.
R:  Hi.  
L:  This is --
R:  Have you done these before?
L:  Th- -- No, this is my very first time doing this.
R:  [MN]
L:  What am I -- we're supposed to be discussing who we feel is a threat to --
R:  Other countries, uh, to us or are we a threat to another country?
L:  Okay. 
R:  I mean it doesn't have to stay on the topic.  Essentially, all they wanna do is track voice patterns and stuff like that.  So, if we --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- get off the patt- if we get off the topic, it doesn't matter.
L:  Okay.  I thought we would have to stay, uh, on the, um --
R:  No, they don't.
L:  -- on the topic.
R:  We can, but --
L:  Now, is this your first time doing this?
R:  No, this is my third today [MN].
L:  Oh, my gosh.  How many calls will we get a day?
R:  Well, hopefully, it said three was the maximum for the whole study, so hopefully [LAUGH] this is --
L:  Oh, this isn't gonna last forever.
R:  Well, I've done these before for other companies --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and they last like six months or so.
L:  Oh, okay, so it wasn't -- it's gonna be -- okay, so we -- there may be a day where you get three calls and you may go four days where they don't get any.
R:  Well, on the information I got for this particular study, it was three calls and that's it, so I don't know if that's true or if there's going to be more studies --
L:  Okay.  That's interesting.
R:  Or if it's a long term -- it's -- yeah, it's kind of fun.  It's an easy way to make money but it's kind of a --
L:  And where do you live, do you mind me asking?
R:  Indiana.
L:  Oh, where in Indiana?
R:  Fort Wayne.
L:  Oh, okay.  And, um, I work in, um -- well, I live in Dallas, Texas.
R:  Okay [LAUGH]
L:  And I'm originally St Paul, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
R:  Uh.
L:  But I know we're supposed -- so we're supposed to try and stay --  I think Korea is definitely a threat.
R:  It's interesting you say, St Paul.  I w- just moved from, uh, Brooklyn Park, Minnesota.
L:  Oh, my gosh.  I know where that is.  I'm from Woodberry which is --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- a suburb of St Paul.
R:  On the -- on the east side.  Sure, been there many a time.  Oh.  Exactly, so, um, yeah, okay.  Is -- is any other country a threat?  Oh, I don't consider any of 'em a threat right now but I did before. But now, I don't.
L:  Yeah, I don't know about you but I'm tired of hearing about the war.
R:  [LAUGH] I agree.
L:  I am just totally, um, tired of talking or thinking about it.  Is any one a threat?  Yes, I do think other people are a threat, and I think America is too trusting to other countries and, um, that's definitely what I have to say about that. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, you know, um, one minute we, you know, um -- anyway, but yeah, do I think so?  I think Korea is definitely a threat, and I think that there is other countries that we think are our allies that are, um, holding, um -- have weapons and are aiding other countries that are our enemies that are having, you know --
R:  Like Germany and France?
L:  I think, basically, we can't trust anyone.
R:  Right.  That is very true.  Who do --
L:  That is my view.
R:  Who do you think might be holding weapons?  Germany, France, both of them?
L:  Oh, definitely France.
R:  Okay.  All right.
L:  I think they've been aiding other countries.  Definitely Russia --
R:  Yeah.  Right.  I think --
L:  -- and Korea.
R:  -- Russia always has and always will.
L:  But, you know, I mean, I know basic knowledge about the subject.  You know this sounds dumb but I thought we were going to discuss toys.
R:  Oh, how did you get that thought?
L:  Well, isn't it Fisher Price?
R:  Well, it's Fisher but not Fisher Price.
L:  Oh, my gosh.  You're going to think I'm dumb.
R:  No, no.
L:  I thought it was like the toy company.
R:  Well, but see on these different -- when I've done these before like every day is a different topic.  So, they j- all they're doing is studying voice patterns.  That's all they're getting out of this is our voice patterns.
L:  So, wait.  Aren't they wanting to know the information we're discussing?
R:  Not particularly, no [MN].  Not from what I know, you do not have to positively stay on track.  No.
L:  Oh, g- boy, I'm not that great at staying on track but I figure we should discuss it at least a little bit.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I mean we ma- so you get paid ten dollars a call?
R:  Right.  Right.  You should too.
L:  That's really a- amazing.
R:  Right, ten dollars a call and i- if it's like the other ones, I've done they're very legit.
L:  Well, you know, something I did get, is I got caller id --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I have not had it but maybe a week and a half.  By the way, if someone dings on the other line, I'll just let it go to voicemail --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but I have not had it for -- and I tell you what, it is such a blessing.  When I saw the two one five Penn State, and I thought, "What's this?" it didn't -- because what I've noticed -- do you have caller id?
R:  Yes, and it's University of Penn, right --
L:  Yes, exactly --
R:  -- shows up.
L:  -- that's what this said and I thought, you know what because I didn't know who it was and I thought, "Well I'll answer it and if I find out that it's a sales call, then I know I won't answer it".  But I've noticed that, for me and I don't know what you've noticed, but the sales calls have been either "no data" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- "out of area", "unavailable" or "blocked call".  Those are the four.  Is that kinda what yours comes up as?
R:  It is, um, although Indiana is under a new thing.  You can be on a "no call" list so we're on that for no telemarketers and that really makes a difference.  So, we signed our -- our phone number is no telemarketers could call us and they can be fined by the state if they do call.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's gonna be something that's gonna be, um, worldwide eventually but right now, Indiana is a test market for it.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, it's -- we don't get very many at all telemarketers like we used to get, so ...  You used to get bombarded by 'em but, you know, with caller id you can screen 'em and get rid of 'em, so --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- if you don't want 'em, [LAUGH] hang up on 'em.  I've been lately getting a lot of, uh, people calling for surveys but like on Internet when you do a survey, at least you're generally entered into a drawing for money.
L:  Exactly.
R:  But these -- the surveys lately that I were getting are just wanting your opinion for free so ...
L:  Oh, really, 'cause usually they want you to be in a focus group, don't they?
R:  W- I used to be in focus groups but Indiana doesn't have focus groups.  There's -- they don't know of that concept yet.  When I lived in Minneapolis --
L:  Are you from Indiana originally?
R:  Yeah.  Lafayette, yeah.  So ...
L:  Do you like Indiana better or Minnesota?
R:  Minnesota.  Minnesota.  Go back in a second.  Oh, I really, really liked Minnesota.
L:  Now, why do you like Minnesota better than Indiana?
R:  I think it was better for my kids.  Oh, I think the education up there was a lot better, so but --
L:  Yeah, I was gonna say, um, my husband lived near Goshinary[?] and he didn't care --
R:  Sure.  Sure.  Down -- right down the road a piece [LAUGH].
L:  He did not care for it in that area but he's from the upper peninsula of Michigan.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, like I said, I'm fr- I live in Dallas.  I've lived here like fourteen years, or maybe fifteen years and I moved here after college when I was twenty two and, um, but I'm originally from Woodberry, Minnesota which is a suburb of St Pauls so ...
R:  That's cool.
L:  Isn't that weird?  What I was -- so, wait now.  What do you do for a living now?
R:  Um, I'm an educational surrogate for homeless kids in the school district.
L:  Education --.
R:  So, anybody that's homeless, um, that's a student, then I go in and represent 'em.  It's kinda interest --
L:  You try to help 'em?
R:  Yeah, exactly.  It's volunteer but, um, state law requires that they have a, uh, surrogate of some sort to represent 'em so, yeah.
L:  No, sweet.  Now, do you also, um, help your kids at -- I mean, do your kids go to actual school too?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  So, I can go in and check on them while I'm in helping these other kids too.  You're right.
L:  See, that's nice of you.  In other words, you're a -- basically, you're a stay at home mum and you do these things --
R:  Right.  But I did this so I can, uh, kinda be in there with my kids and see no one can question me when I'm in the school.  Then, I'm in for a reason so I can --
L:  Well, no one should question you anyway, right?
R:  Well, see in Minnesota that's okay, you can do that.  But here they don't like mums coming into the classroom.  In Minnesota, I did it all the time.  I'd just walk in.  If I wanted to see my kid, I walked right in.  But here they -- you don't do that.  They just -- they don't -- that's not cool.  You just do not do that so --
L:  Really?
R:  -- I've kinda broken that pattern of, uh [MN] this is what we do do and we walk in if we want to see 'em and -- not to disrupt them and not to necessarily be nitpicking but just to see what they're --
L:  Yeah.  To me, I mean, as long as you're not living the kids up, because I taught school for nine years and there was this one parent that would basically get the kids really disrupted --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it would get 'em all wild.
R:  Right.
L:  But as long as the child's not crying and you're going in to visit her to help, I don't -- I think you should be able to go --
R:  You should.
L:  -- in whenever you want.
R:  And legally we should have that right.  But here --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you don't have that right to walk in.  You may not walk in without, uh, notifying the school twenty four hours before your visit.  Well, then in twenty four hours the teacher's gonna be all ready for you coming, not that they're doing anything wrong, but that's not the idea of a spontaneous --
L:  But it's good to be involved --
R:  -- visit.
L:  I mean, I'm not even talking of checking on the teacher but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, hey John -- you know, 'cause, I mean, teacher's work is hard.
R:  Right.
L:  "You know, hey Johnny over there needs some, you know, help ready and teacher's helping one of the other kids.  Take over and work with Johnny for a little bit".
R:  Right.
L:  See, if you don't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, why not?
R:  As long as you're in there, you can do it but they just don't believe in that.  They've never had that and they don't know what that is and I -- I really --
L:  Well, you don't think the education level's as good?
R:  Oh, it isn't.  By far, no.  No way, uh-uh.
L:  Because, you know what?  I had a really good education and I'm going to tell you something right now, and don't take this wrong whatever -- I don't want you -- send me the phone number when you end up hanging up on me because you're mad but I recruit people to do merchandising jobs.
R:  I do that too.
L:  You do merchandising and mystery shopping?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you know who I am?  Dawn Hunt.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I've seen your name on there.  Sure.
L:  Dawn Hunt one at msn dot com?
R:  Sure.  I -- actually I've done some shops for you.
L:  Haciendas?
R:  Uh, yeah.  I did a Hacienda a couple of weekends ago for you.
L:  That is so bizarre --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- because you know what --
R:  Small world.
L:  -- the people from -- I'm not scheduling them anymore because the- her shoppers did not like me.
R:  But you're not the only one that's done Haciendas and you're like the third one that's done Haciendas.
L:  You mean schedule them?
R:  Yeah.  Well, it -- sure, their company that's done 'em.  So, Hacien-  it's not you, it's Hacienda.  They don't like the reports they're getting.
L:  No, it's not Hacienda at all.
R:  So, it's --
L:  It's the shoppers because, guess what?  I sent a note out.  I don't know if you were one of the ones that got it 'cause Kim told me not to send it out but I sent a note out saying thank you to all the shoppers and I sent this gi- I wanna know if you got that?  Did you?
R:  I didn't get that.
L:  Okay, well that's bec- then you must have done it afterwards.
