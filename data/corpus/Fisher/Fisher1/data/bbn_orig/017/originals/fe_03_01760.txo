R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hello, my name is Paula.
R:  Paula, hi, I'm Petra.
L:  Hello.
R:  Okay, um, is this your first time doing this? 
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, okay, this is my second time so ... 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, so, what are your opinions on foreign relations specifically with regard to threats to the US? 
L:  Well, I don't really believe that there are threats to the US.
R:  Mhm, interesting, why? 
L:  I think that -- I think that the President was behind it.
R:  The President was behind it?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ah, what specifically? 
L:  I think he was behind the whole thing as far as the trade centre went. 
R:  Oh.
L:  And I think that his whole -- whole actual agenda was to bring us in- into this war.  His dad couldn't kill Hu- Hussein and he's -- now he's trying to.
R:  Okay, I do definitely agree with you on the -- he's definitely trying to follow up on daddy's mission.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] I'm definitely with you on that one.  But I do think there are some threats to the US.  Not specifically maybe a whole countries but, um, --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, I think that -- I -- I'm not American by the way, I'm Canadian.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think you guys have, ah, have riled up a few people here and there.
L:  Yeah, that they probably have.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] I mean, I don't necessarily know that Bin Laden and his group is one of them.  To me I think it was awfully weird that they thought that he, um, did it, they found out so quickly that their group was behind it.  I mean, it was like the first day or the second day that they knew that information already of who did it, who was behind it.
R:  Okay.
L:  There's no way they could have found it that quickly.
R:  Okay.  So you think in general that, um, -- are you speaking specifically, um, to the more recent things?
L:  Well, like the nine eleven bombing.  
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  I don't think they could have found it that quickly.
R:  Mhm.  All right, all right.  Um, I don't know.  Um, I feel like, ah, ah, the s- -- the US has -- well, not only the US, I think that most relations between different countries are somewhat strained.  Like, I mean, ah, even -- I feel like Britain is pretty much like, ah, ah, your lackey, [LAUGH] like a US type [inaudible], if the US says something Britain will follow.
L:  Yes, that probably is true.
R:  [LAUGH] I kind of also think, ah, -- Canada, we -- we tend to be kind of neutral but I think we will pretty much go with you guys on most things as well. Um, but I think there are like quite a few other, ah, groups, maybe even smaller groups within other countries that do pose -- well you know what, I don't even know if I'm sure about that, if, ah, other groups really pose a significant threat to the US because I feel, like, you guys, [MN] um, spend a lot of money on weapons, a lot of money on defence and in general if there's problems they tend to be in other countries and not on your own soil.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Um, but, ah, this recent thing did kind of bring it home.  So you think it's more, like, a conspiracy type --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, issue, all right. 
L:  I do, I think that the President had -- had no idea that the towers were going to crumble like that.
R:  Okay.
L:  And he -- So, he was thinking he was going to renew the faith of Americans because of the way all the scandal that Clinton had caused people had thought the government was a -- was a --  
R:  Okay.
L:  -- was just kind of a shambles and a mockery.  This is his way of renewing the faith of the American people.  He just had no idea the two -- the two buildings were going to crumble the way they did and cause chaos.  And when he did he shot that -- they shot that plane -- plane in Pennsylvania out of the sky when he realised how many people it had killed so he couldn't go cause more.  
R:  Mm.
L:  He had no way -- probably figured it would only kill a couple hundred people, you know, the people in the plane were hit at and three floors around it, had no idea it was going to kill thousands the way it crumbled.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  So, um, let me think, um, do you think al Qaeda is a myth or do you think they really exist and they're really, um, anti US? 
L:  Well, they are -- they probably exist, the things.  They're probably, um, probably on them, you know, as far as they went over there and made everybody mad.
R:  Okay.
L:  I mean, so, yeah they are kind of a risk now because they've made everybody else mad.
R:  Okay.
L:  Who knows, Hussein could be hiding there for all we know. 
R:  [MN] Okay.
L:  We're not really bombing there and he's -- they have not found any hard core proof that he is dead.
R:  Right, right.  Um, ah, --  
L:  And I honestly believe that when -- I will be amazed as can be when they call the war over and bring all of our troops back if he don't pop back up and I wouldn't doubt -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  -- he'll pop back up with another terrorism of some sort. 
R:  Okay, okay, um.
L:  We will be lucky if they don't send a bomb over and blow half the United States up.
R:  Do you think that's, ah, um, -- do you think that's something that really could happen? 
L:  I would think so.
R:  Okay.
L:  Because, I mean, somebody does you wrong, you are going to want to do them wrong, that's the way of the world.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Even though two wrongs don't make a right so I don't really believe in that they should be at war.
R:  Okay.
L:  Because two wrongs don't make a right.
R:  Okay.  Um, -- 
L:  I mean even if they did do the -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- do the nine eleven thing and stuff, that was wrong, why should we go over there and do them wrong.
R:  Okay. [MN]
L:  I think what -- that's not what it's intended to be and that's not the way the bible explains it to be.
R:  Okay.  Um, you know, -- 
L:  Even though I'm not a very religious person, I do believe somewhat that you shouldn't do somebody wrong just because they did you wrong.
R:  Okay.  Um, you are one of the few people who actually takes that point of view that I have spoken to so far, um, just in general on the topic.  Um, ah, what about, um, -- so, you think that, ah, it was kind of a set up, but that now it's a possibility that there's a bigger threat to us because of that.
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  Okay. So --
L:  I mean, it might have been his whole intention was probably to bring us into the war.
R:  Okay. 
L:  And the whole nine eleven thing was just his way of getting all the people on his side. 
R:  Okay. 
L:  So that we would go along with that.
R:  Okay.
L:  'Cause there were so many people that were against the -- against the Presidency and all that because of what Clinton did before all this happened, now they have to -- now they look at us, well we have to rely on our presidents to protect us from terrorist threats.
R:  Right.
L:  They have a choice, because they are scared.  Where else are they gonna turn.
R:  Mm, what do you think, ah, about what we can do now to kind of, ah, get rid of the threat that exists now, um, if we can do anything at all?
L:  Um, other than absolutely finding out for sure that they have killed Saddam and all his people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't think there is anything they can really do about it at this point.
R:  Okay. [MN]
L:  I mean, they have to make sure they make good relations with whoever it is still -- still alive --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- and make sure that the other ones are silenced in some sort of way.
R:  Okay.
L:  I mean and there's always gonna be a ter- terrorist threat of some sort from somewhere.
R:  Right.
L:  They're just weirdos. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, right.  Um, a lot of people argue in some of my classes that, um, a large portion of terrorists are from Middle Eastern countries and that here you have a general anti US sentiment to begin with and that they in general pose the biggest threat to the US.  But, um, a lot of people don't talk about North Korea too much even though, um, they, um, every once in a while wag in front of everybody's face that they have or are working on, um, obtaining nuclear capabilities and, um, that some people have argued that they are a bigger threat than anything and, um, no one is really looking at them too much either so I wonder about that.
L:  Yeah, I'm not really sure.  I mean, I don't know a whole lot about -- a whole lot of about the world events when it comes to -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- a whole lot of different things.
R:  Okay. Okay.
L:  I have never followed a lot what goes on in the world.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Until they -- until they brought us into the war and that's pretty much where I started really following what was going on.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  Only because I -- sometimes I travel to state capitals and things and I keep track of that just because I was afraid to go to the state capital --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- which I was supposed to do when they brought the war on.
R:  Okay.
L:  I was scheduled to go down there that day when it started and I turned it down. 
R:  Okay.
L:  And they wanted me in the state capital.  If they're gonna bomb somewhere, they're gonna bomb the state capital than some flaked out place like Indiana to --  
R:  Right, yeah, makes sense, right. 
L:  -- to just make a point.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  It will be like, "Oh, there ain't nothing there but a bunch of hicks, let's bomb that place --" 
R:  So, you think -- 
L:  "-- that will mess 'em up". 
R:  You think we are vulnerable right now? 
L:  Until -- I would think so until they can actually show proof that they have killed Saddam.  
R:  Okay.
L:  I would say they were very vulnerable.  They have already lowered or -- they have lowered our elevated status that we had as a terrorist threat -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, there's no -- there's no protection that somebody from over there can't get in here.
R:  Right.
L:  I think when in doubt with this protection going on Saddam can disguise himself and walk right through in our country.
R:  Right. Right.
L:  If you have no -- sure they have killed his sons and all this stuff but I'm sure he was aware that all that was gonna happen before he didn't surrender to begin with.  It wasn't like he wasn't actually warned. 
R:  Right, right, right.  Good point.
L:  He doesn't care if I --
