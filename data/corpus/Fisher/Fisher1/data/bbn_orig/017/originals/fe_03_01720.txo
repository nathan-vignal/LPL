L:  Hi, how ya doing, this is John [inaudible]
R:  Hi, um, I'm Shannon [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay [MN], uh, so I guess you heard the topic, or?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Other countries that are a threat?  You know, one of the first countries that comes to my mind is China because they've got like, you know, a billion or so army that -- 
R:  Yeah, and so -- 
L:  -- would be pretty intimidating [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, the whole SARS thing over there has kinda got me wondering too -- 
L:  [MN] Oh, yeah, you forget -- 
R:  -- how they have that -- 
L:  -- biological warfare they just come over here and a couple of those guys are [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, that's -- 
L:  -- big trouble.
R:  That's what I'm starting to think about that and ...
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I don't know -- 
L:  I would agree with that -- 
R:  -- if I completely trust Iraq now either. 
L:  Oh, yeah, that's it -- 
R:  I -- I think -- 
L:  -- that's a given right there -- 
R:  Yeah -- 
R:  -- Syria or Iraq.  A couple of those Middle East counties are extremely questionable.  Egypt, you've gotta wonder about those guys cause, you know, they've been harboring the fugitives and, ah, supposedly maybe even holding some of the biological and chemical weapons.  So, that's pretty scary there.
R:  Oh, yeah, it is.  And the only --
L:  And now they've got a reason to attack us to say that they're mad.  Before they were just mad at the world but now they've got, like, [NOISE], well, I'm not going to say that they didn't have a reason to be mad, but, you know, now that ther- they're pissed -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so ...
R:  I always thought -- 
L:  There's no holding back.
R:  -- I always told everybody that, ah, the reason Saddam Hussein was mad -- have you seen the South Park movie?
L:  [LAUGH] No -- 
R:  That's why I --  
L:  -- but I -- I heard about that [LAUGH] 
R:  That's why he's pissed. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [MN] Yeah, I'm sure that probably didn't help any [LAUGH] 
R:  No. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, man. [NOISE]
R:  I don't know, I think the only safe one right now would be Australia.  You don't hear a whole bunch from them, so ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, [MN], you know, most of those middle European countries are -- are pretty -- pretty non threatening, you know, you got the Swiss and the Dutch and, you know, and little tiny Belgium but, ah, pretty much, like, the Middle East any other -- any of the major, ah, eastern, ah, -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- um, European countries, you know, [NOISE] those guys are still mad about the cold war, I think and then -- 
R:  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
L:  -- and we got -- 
R:  I know -- I think this war is far from over too -- 
L:  Well, -- 
R:  -- they're wanting to say it's close to the end but, no.
L:  No, no.
R:  -- no way near it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, this is just a first chapter, it has just begun.  We started something that's not going to be over any -- any time soon, but I mean that's, like, you got those guys, they've been neighbors and -- and they've been fighting for, phew, what, hundred plus years or something -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- I don't know, I'm not sure what the timeframe is, but I know that they've been going at each other for a long time and that's just over land and -- well, it started over land and religion and th- then they started killing each other and now it's just escalated, so -- I mean look what we've done, now we're occupying their land, you know, we've let all their religions come about, you know, too late that they can do whatever they want supposedly with the freedom thing [MN] and then we've killed a bunch of their people, so, you know, that's a triple threat right there, so people are pissed.
R:  I don't know if you believe in the whole Nostradamus thing or not?  I don't know -- 
L:  What was that?  
R:  -- if you've heard anything about that, but they said, "What the anti Christ is going to rise up in the Middle East" -- 
L:  [MN] Well, yeah -- 
R:  -- so, I'm thinking -- 
R:  I -- I -- I heard about that, that's I think it's -- there's couple of those kind of prophecies, but -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- oh, most of it's -- most of the timeframes from that have -- have passed, but just cause the actual timeframe has passed, you know, you gotta seriously question because that's pretty much what's happening now, that, ah, North Korea gets their hands in it too, oh, goodness, they all -- everybody's trying to get the world nuclear powers going on and ... [MN] 
R:  Oh, yeah, it's going to be the third world war here pretty soon.
L:  [MN] It's -- it's pretty much it's gonna just get it -- get to be, like, you know, I -- I mean I don't -- I don't know how political it -- you know, like the playground brawl, you know -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- you -- you side up, people are just going to start saying nothing and, shoo, everyone is going to be going at each other. [MN] I don't think you -- well, I mean I don't wanna -- I don't wanna be one of those doomsday prophesy kinda guys, but I can see -- I'm not going to say that's g- go all out or anything, but I don't see this thing ending any time real soon. 
R:  No, no definitely not. 
L:  [MN]
R:  My husband thinks it's going to be like another Vietnam, so.
L:  Mm, yeah, pretty soon we're just gonna to start questioning why we're even there and then we're gonna have our own little -- it's gonna make all of us question, you know, all our stuff and then you get your own little internal revolution going on and then, ah, it's gonna get pretty ugly.
R:  Oh, yeah.  It's scary, I mean, I got two little ones and I -- I know I -- I live out in the boonies but, God, you never know what can happen. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm, yeah, well let's see, I've got two little ones and [MN] I live, you know, I -- I live pretty much out in the boonies, but I live in the middle of the ocean, I'm in Hawaii, so it's, like, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I -- I don't know if they'd -- they'd actually attack us because I mean everybody likes to vacation here. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, like, sometimes I feel, like, we're safe but then I think about us like, you know, you do have military bases here, you know, you gotta think Pearl Harbor they came after us but I mean, ever since then -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- you know, the Japanese and eve- everybody they pretty much started coming here and it's just been a vacation spot, but -- [MN]
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  You've got that and then, you know, they'd know that [MN] everybody likes this place, so, why not blow it up, so.
R:  Yeah, the same thing here, I'm out in Florida, so -- 
L:  Oh, okay, yeah [NOISE] you're in trou- oh, see, plus you got Jeb[?] over there [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That ain't gonna help. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm right by a -- University of Florida, so. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah, I see you got the major theme parks, you got all of that and, like, I said "You got Jeb".  So, I mean we went after -- after, ah, Hussein's brothers and -- and Bin Laden's family, so, you know, they're going to go after Bush's family then -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- th- that's what I see, and you live in Florida, I mean I don't wanna make you paranoid -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- but, phew, boy, that ain't good. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I saw something online [MN] a couple of days ago, and this went down every president that was elected and -- with the ending as zero, you know, Bush was elected in two thousand -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- everyone that was -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- elected in zero was assassinated.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yep.  Lincoln -- 
L:  Wow -- 
R:  -- Lincoln, Kennedy, all -- there was a whole list of em.  Every single one that ended in zero was assassinated.  So, that kinda makes -- 
L:  Oh, that's pretty -- 
R:  -- you wonder. 
L:  -- crappie. [MN]
R:  It kinda makes you wonder right there. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I -- I'd [several inaudible words] it once, I never heard that one, that's good --
R:  No -- 
L:  [LAUGH] I'm gonna have to listen to that one, check that out.  [NOISE] 
R:  I get all these little trivia tidbits on all these n- newsletters all the time and that was one of em. [MN] 
L:  Oh, oh, buddy. [MN] 
R:  And what I don't get is you don't hear about Bin Laden any more -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah, that's -- he got sidelined a little, you know, I mean it's, like, it makes you wonder too, I mean.  I don't know, I -- I think that there's too many ulterior motives for this war.  You look at -- I mean all -- all of Bush's cabinet they're all oil people.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  You know, they take over, um, Hussein's shit and -- and they use his oil, they get all these billion dollar contracts over there, they get to use their oil and say, "That it's for the benefit of those people", but it's like, phew, oh, yeah, it's just all -- I mean it's a little fishy to me [MN] I don't know.  [NOISE] I don't want to question it.  Well, I do want to question it, but [several inaudible words] [NOISE], you know.  I mean, I'm a proud American but there's definitely some fishy stuff going on I'd have to say. 
R:  I know my best friend's husband's -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- over there right now and I'm worrying about him every day, so. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  That must be so hard, I can't [NOISE] even imagine.  I'm -- I'm glad I don't know anybody that's over there.
R:  I pray -- 
L:  Well, -- 
R:  -- I pray for -- 
L:  -- I know some people who were, like, [NOISE] getting ready to get shipped over there, it's like there, like, next on the -- on the call [NOISE] -- oh, no, you know what?  My -- my girlfriend's friend, her husband is over there, that's right [NOISE] -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] um, I'm totally tripping but I never actually met him, so.  I mean, it's kinda crappy, but ...
R:  I pray for him every day, cause -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- my best friend she just had a baby
