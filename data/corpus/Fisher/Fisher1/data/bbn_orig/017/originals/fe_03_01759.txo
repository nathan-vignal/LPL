R:  Hi, my name is Stephanie.
L:  Hi, I'm Rick. 
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um, -- [LAUGH]
L:  Let me close the window here. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I think I'm all set as far as noise.
L:  I'm sorry, what? 
R:  I think I'm all set as far as noise.
L:  Yeah, well, we got these knucklehead protesters outside.  Ah, they've been going at it for about a year protesting this one business so it's -- it gets distracting at times. [LAUGH]
R:  What are they protesting?
L:  Um, business changed management, they fired a bunch of employees and their employees are doing a shake down.  It's Philly so ... 
R:  Oh, where are you?
L:  Philly.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm in Cambridge Massachusetts.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, okay, topic of the day is. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I -- frankly, every time I have gotten one of these calls it's been about, um, current events like politics and war and, you know, terrorists and getting all --  
L:  How many calls have you done? 
R:  Um, this is the second one I have done.  A couple of my friends are also doing it and they have also gotten a lot of them too, so. 
L:  Hm.
R:  Anyway --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, [SIGH] countries that are threats.  Ah, do you want to start? 
L:  I am pretty relaxed here, I've been writing a paper all day so my brain's pretty fried. [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  I -- I sympathize, I just finished my thesis.
L:  Okay.
R:  Countries that are a threat.
L:  How about we just say all of them and get it done with. [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah, I'm actually -- I'm kind of worried not about the countries themselves so much as the fundamentalist groups and those exist worldwide.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I don't think that it's -- I mean, the problem I have is I think one of the worse threats -- if they are looking for, you know, chemical attacks or whatever is not going to be governmental, it's going to be from some small well funded group of --
L:  Well, you could basically qu- -- call 'em quasi states because they have the resources of the state -- 
R:  That's true.
L:  -- but they don't have normal territory -- 
R:  The boundaries.
L:  So.
R:  Okay.
L:  Which basically makes it personal.
R:  Yeah.  And I -- I am also sort of interested in the -- I don't know how plausible this is -- interested in the, ah, some sort of a financial terrorism kind of thing.  Does that make sense?  Like, the way that the Middle East is dropping the dollar for trading.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, like, they are trading there -- a lot of the oil trade- -- they are being valued in Euros now instead of dollars. 
L:  [MN] Well -- 
R:  You know, it would be interesting if this -- there were some large scale dropping of the dollar on the international --  
L:  Well, you know, doing something like that really conceivably has no effect because, you know, currency is interchangeable.  Um, you know, the more serious concern you'd have is, um, specific access some states have done to undervalue the currency, ah, --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, when we -- ah, one of the big problems we have had is some nation states actually go out of the way to produce, um, counterfeit US currency.
R:  Yep.
L:  Part of it because US currency buys you a lot but the other part of it is it devalues our currency.
R:  Yes, it does.
L:  Um, so, I mean, that's a serious concern but --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I am not so much concerned if prices are done in one currency over another because --
R:  [MN] I understand that and I -- I don't know a lot about oil trading [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I understand it does actually affect the value of the dollar because it affects the amount of trade that is being done with it --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so it changes a lot of indexes but --  
L:  [MN] But at the same time the real value of currency is, you know, how much confidence people are willing to place in it and --  
R:  Yes.
L:  -- I'm not absolutely convinced that because some people decide not to do trade in that one sor- sort of currency it is going to automatically, ah, de- devalue it.  You know, in some cases that might be symptomatic of a problem in the currency, like if I stop doing business with you in rubles, that's probably -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- for good reason, but [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, bad time for the ruble.
L:  Oh, it's always a bad time for the ruble. 
R:  Well, it's -- it was just something that's sort of been occurring to me as I read some things, I just sort of wonder about the plausibility of it.
L:  Yeah, I -- I think --  
R:  'Cause it didn't -- I'm sorry. 
L:  I think the -- the real serious prob-, ah, problem when it comes to financial security is that it's probably, and I guess from my perspective it's informational hubs or, you know, distribution hubs. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, that's -- that would really slow things down.  
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, you know, if -- if commerce gets, you know, interfered with, you know, even at one point that could cost millions or billions of dollars a day so ... 
R:  Yeah, I -- and just -- and, ah, the dial a service attacks, you can take out communications and cost a lot of people a lot of money.
L:  Oh, yeah. Um, --
R:  And that's -- 
L:  -- well and there was another --  
R:  -- not that hard.
L:  -- a great example in the, ah, Atlantic Monthly recently where they were talking about how just oil production in Saudi Arabia is incredibly vulnerable to just, you know, a handful of attacks and that could basically effectively shut down of all -- all of Saudi Arabia's oil production.
R:  Oh, what kind of -- what kind of attacks, like the --  
L:  Um, well, there --  
R:  -- pipelines breaking, people and such or --  
L:  The refineries themselves are concentrated in very specific areas with lax security, pipelines, -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- um, you take that stuff out and you have effectively shutdown that country's production.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, you know, so I mean that's always a concern you have when you're -- I guess you're dealing with commerces.  There might be some areas that really are concentrated and, you know, interference in that spot can cause some pretty nasty effects.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, not -- not anything that can be overcome but certainly cause headaches for the time being.
R:  Oh, no kidding.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean it's bad enough when they have, um, I don't remember where it was, I think it was somewhere more towards Africa where they were having problems with people breaking, ah, the oil pipelines for, I think it was Shell that was having really bad problems with it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it was causing serious environmental problems and economic --
L:  [MN] Yeah, that's right, um, --
R:  -- issues with production.
L:  Yeah, that's -- yeah, I mean that's one of the big things with an oil pipeline going through a bunch of countries, it does cause those problems.  You have to provide security along the way and if one country becomes destabilized it's a valuable target.
R:  Yep.
L:  [MN] Um, but ... [PAUSE] yeah, but, ah, such a -- I love how they give these broad ranging questions.
R:  [LAUGH] It wouldn't have been such a problem for me except for the fact that, ah, it -- it's very, ah, awkward to talk about current events with someone that you don't know necessarily and have an idea of what their background is I guess until you're just sort of started on this --   
L:  Or are you a little bit intimidated on what their opinions are on it? But you don't know that -- 
R:  --  well, not opinions so much as you start on a certain topic and there is no segue for us -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and so it's sort of artificially spawned. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, I mean, I don't know what the purpose of the study is but I wonder if -- if that has anything to do with it --
L:  I -- I'm actually curious if the purpose of the study is to see where conversations go from these specific topics. Um, --
R:  Yeah, I'd believe that.
L:  You know, do -- do people end up shifting into talking about personal stuff or, you know, that sort of thing.  Like, are people more comfortable going into -- talking with a complete stranger about stuff in their life as opposed to talking about these distant things. But --
R:  Yeah.  I think in some of the cases they would end up with some dif- -- some real differences based on, ah, not only where you come from obviously. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  But, ah, I think based on, ah, education slash awareness --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- kind of levels, but -- 
L:  Yeah, but so far every -- well, I've only gotten two people on this but they were -- they were all college educated.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which doesn't surprise me since stuff like this just seems to attract college students.
R:  Well, I think since it is done by a college it sort of passes through other university mailing lists.
L:  Exactly.  And, you know, it's money for just talking on the phone for ten minutes. 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Are -- are you then economics or management -- type of person? 
L:  I'm actually, ah, studying law.
R:  Okay. 
L:  And background is in math. 
R:  Okay.
L:  So, I've got a little touch of everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but [MN] -- Mhm.  If I knew -- I know someone else if you were doing this he would just make the entire conversation for them centered on the French.
R:  On French?
L:  On the French.
R:  I have nothing against the French. [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We had a -- we actually my -- we had an exchange student staying with our family earlier this month or this year because they have, um, they have to do -- they are required to do internships to graduate from a lot of colleges.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she was working for my parents and she came in and she's like "I don't understand why all the American people think France is so terrible" blah blah blah.  It's like it's -- it's not most  of Americans, just these few people that make the news.
L:  I don't know about that.  I think the numbers are much higher in middle America for a good bit of French bashing over the dinner table.
R:  This is in Minnesota.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  So ... 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I don't think it's that bad personally yet. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well then again, Minnesota is an aberration in the midwest.
R:  [LAUGH] I'd like to take that as a compliment.
L:  [LAUGH] Hey, take it however you want.
R:  [MN] Ah, --
L:   [LAUGH] I mean not many midwestern states would produce Will Stone and --
R:  [MN] Yeah, or unfortunately, um, like Wolvagon[?]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:   -- crap, what's his name, Gergen[?] Keeler[?].  
L:  Yep.
R:  Um, yeah, but, ah, she was just [MN] appalled that people could support the things that were going on in the country and it's like, "No they -- you know, they don't a lot of them actually", like, ...
L:  Hm. [MN] Ah, ...
R:  Oh, the other thing that occurs to me in -- in discussing things like these is that, ah, I'm -- I just have a really hard time believing anything that I hear any more.
