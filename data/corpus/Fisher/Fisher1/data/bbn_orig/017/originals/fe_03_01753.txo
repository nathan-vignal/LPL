L:  Hey, how you doing?
R:  Doing pretty good, what about yourself?
L:  Great. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I'm Tod Fry. 
R:  [NOISE] Oh, all right, I'm Garen[?] Clarke.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  From Atlanta.
L:  I'm from, mm, Lancaster, Pennsylvania. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE] Ah, -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  Well, ah, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- let me see -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a threat to the US -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I believe Korea is still a big threat.
L:  [NOISE] Well, I agree --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- with that for sure [NOISE] a -- 
R:  And, ah, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't know I think they should have -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and the people we -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- should have -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- gone after as far as [COUGH] -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- because they, I mean it hasn't been -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a question -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- there that they've admitted -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that they've had those -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- different weapons and -- and -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- types of things -- 
L:  [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  Ah, I don't -- 
L:  [NOISE] They admitted when we caught them [MN] -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah -- 
R:  That they're not afraid to use them. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, after what just happened they might be, they're starting to come around a little bit I'll tell you -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- they're will to -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to -- they wanted to talk to us right away, but now they're willing to talk to China and Japan and us also, but --
R:  [MN] Well, I -- 
L:  -- I definitely believe they're a threat. [MN] 
R:  Yeah, they -- they still are a threat -- 
L:  [NOISE] But -- 
R:  -- you know, it -- it -- it's numerous countries that, ah, you know, that -- that could be a possible threat -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, we're not like, ah, the savory amongst [LAUGH] the super powers -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ah, you know, all those [several inaudible words] right now -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, I mean, it's -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  And -- and I think that, ah, we're -- we're getting a little bit too bad -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- with the blow with France -- 
L:  [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't know, it to me -- 
L:  [NOISE] Well, now, France today [NOISE] came out an- [NOISE] -- and are supporting us on -- on the resolutions to drop 'em --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know that?  [NOISE] 
R:  No, I -- I hadn't, ah, been aware of -- 
L:  W- well, -- 
R:  -- of that.
L:  -- in the UN [NOISE] they're supporting us -- th- they're supporting the US [NOISE] to drop the resolutions that [NOISE] -- for the human -- [NOISE] human, ah, oh, yeah, human terr-, yeah, I can't even think of the word -- [NOISE] hum- humanitarian aid -- 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  -- so, that -- that can be dropped and every- everything can start going again -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- er, the sanctions, you know, they have against Iraq?
R:  Ahah.
L:  That's because we found out how much money France, the UN, Germany and Russia were making on the [NOISE] -- the oil for food -- 
R:  Ahah. [NOISE] 
L:  -- I -- I think France was making, like, seven billion dollars a year on that deal -- 
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and Germany was making, like, four. [NOISE] Now, I think it -- they're just in the stages of that.  Now, they found that in documents in Iraq -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- [MN] and the UN was -- was making lots of money off of that -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- even though Saddam Hussein was taking most of that money and building his -- his great palaces and keeping all the money for himself instead of giving it to people, so.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I'm not sure if that's the reason --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- why -- 
R:  Well, I -- I -- 
L:  -- they didn't wanna back --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- pushing the resolutions, or ...
R:  [NOISE] Well, I -- I -- I think that the whole, the war itself -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- was about money.  I -- I -- I [MN] -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- have a hard time believing it.  You know, I -- I know they had other reasons -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I mean you can ask anybody they'll give you tons of reasons why they think we -- we went to war -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and, I mean the oil had a -- had, if not -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I -- I believe it -- it's over fifty percent [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I'm not -- 
R:  -- reason why.
L:  -- arguing -- I'm not arguing that oil had something to do with it, cause I believe it definitely did. [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I believe there's also some other reasons, I -- you know, [LIPSMACK] -- 
R:  Oh, yeah, well you -- 
L:  -- I -- I mean after nine eleven I think it changed a lot in the way -- in the United States -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- I -- I think to be honest, I believe they're afraid that it's gonna happen again and they wanna try to stop it, but -- but -- 
R:  W- well, my saying was that they waited too long to do something about nine eleven -- 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- I believe -- well, it -- you know, I mean it -- it goes back -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, let man be man, let boys be boys.  L- let's put a situation where you're in the fifth grade and somebody comes and hits you -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and it's a devastating blow -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I mean if you're going to fight 'em, you fight 'em then and there -- 
L:  Well, that's true -- 
R:  -- as soon as you find out, you don't wait until, you know, you get into the eighth grade. [LAUGH] 
L:  Ha.
R:  And you've got all your buddies with you now [LAUGH] to go get back, you know, and I -- I don't know it's -- it's -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I -- and -- I mean my heart went out to -- to the people -- people in nine eleven, but -- 
L:  Right, well, I think everybody's -- 
R:  [MN] 
R:  -- did really to be honest.
R:  But -- but the world keeps turning, life keeps going -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- on.
L:  Right. 
R:  And, you know, it -- it's -- I don't know, so many people dwell on certain things and -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and they lose track and focus -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- on what is really -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- going on, but -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- it's -- it's -- it's a lot of countries [MN] I mean, well, I can't say countries, but I know there are a lot of people that wouldn't mind taking a bite [LAUGH] out of the US as a whole.
L:  And why is that though?
R:  W- I mean, well -- 
L:  [MN] I've never done nothing wrong to anybody, why would somebody want to kill me?  I don't know, I -- it's just -- 
R:  W- --
L:  -- strange to me how people can think like that, they just want to kill me because, I don't know, I'm not their religion or something, you know?
R:  Is -- is, ew, -- I mean it's -- it's human -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- nature -- it's -- it's human nature -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- it -- it goes -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- you can go as extreme as their religions -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- as small as, like, your different groups wh- I mean -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, you have, like, ah, you know your bully types going back in grade school -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- or just people that naturally hate -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- hate others for [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah, that's true -- 
R:  -- for some odd -- 
L:  I guess.
R:  -- reasons.  So, I mean, you know, you have your different extremities -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's just, you know the -- the -- the lengths that they go to -- 
L:  Do you think Syria's a -- a threat to us at all -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- or, they're too little -- 
R:  Well -- 
L:  -- I don't know?
R:  W- w- well that's D- David versus Goliath [LAUGH] I mean, you know, it -- I -- I -- I don't think that there's an enemy that's too little -- 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- cause I mean you have so many conventional and unconventional ways of going about with things -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- you can't really -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, I mean -- well, okay, those -- they only have a certain amount of people wanting to fight for em, but they've got a certain amount of people wanting to fight and go at all costs -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, war really -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I never understood rules of war.  I mean you're basically trying to kill out, you know, kill everybody for whatever reason -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- like, you're able to win -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- whereas there's more than one way for you to kill somebody -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and to kill masses and I'm -- you know, it's just, ah, I don't know -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- it's the world that we live in.
L:  [MN] Well, I think if they stopped the money maybe -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- an- and you realize most of the money is coming from, like, Saudi Arabia and we pretend to be friends with them because we're afraid --
R:  Oh [MN] -- 
L:  -- we'll lose our oil or something, I don't know -- 
R:  Well, y- you know -- 
L:  -- but they're afraid to stand up to Saudi Arabia I think.
R:  W- well, generally I've been doing my research -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I -- I'm twenty years old and I've probably gotten my nose in some books that I probably shouldn't but, ah, I read up about the oil embargo back in the nineteen seventies --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and it surprised me that, ah, it was a coalition over in the Middle East -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- all of them decided they were not going to sell the US an- -- any oil and basically we was going through back -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- then what we were going through a couple of months ago, but it was worse, they were rationing out gasoline [LAUGH] and -- and so, ah, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ah, I -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I don't know where we get somebody by the name of Saddam Hussein -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who decides to sell the US oil and we consider him as a quote, unquote, freedom fighter.  They have even books and, ah, [LIPSMACK] newspaper, ah, clippings and everything -- 
L:  Oh, when we -- 
R:  -- and -- 
L:  -- when we backed Saddam Hussein?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I knew that, I remember that.
R:  Yeah, and -- and I -- I just -- 
L:  I know. [NOISE] 
R:  -- I can't -- it's -- it's just crazy he goes to being the national hero to, you know, the world's most wanted. [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] The same thing happened in Panama they did that same thing with Becker[?] -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and -- and then we went ... 
R:  [NOISE]  
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] I think they've gotta cut off the money, but -- but I agree that Korea, we -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- gotta do something about that, but -- 
R:  Yeah, we do, it -- it's -- it's -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- just a resolution -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- or something, so -- 
L:  I'm not sure a war's always the way, but, shoo. [NOISE] 
R:  Well, I mean when you have people that -- that, are -- are-- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- are trigger happy and gun happy, you know, war is always the answer, and I mean -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's -- it's obvious there's a lot more people that would support a war -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- than there would be people to support peace -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and then some other people that -- that -- that protest an- and support peace go around -- go about it in a violent ways and they ... [LAUGH] 
L:  I support -- 
R:  And -- and that --  
L:  -- my country and my troops, but I'm not -- not sure I agree with everything they do, but -- 
R:  Exactly.  W- well, only about, ah, ah -- I was raised up to believe, ah, nothing that you hear and half of what you see -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and ... [LAUGH] It -- it -- it -- 
L:  That's cool.
L:  Huh?
L:  That's -- that's right.
R:  An- an- and it's, er, to me, it, ah, I know there's other reasons for, you know, things, you know, that -- that are things that are happening and things that they won't tell us -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean it's [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, throughout the years, and I just refuse to believe that now in two thousand and three, oh, it's just all of a sudden changed and people don't lie or they don't half of the truth --
