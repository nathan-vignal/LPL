R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is John.
R:  This is Michelle.
L:  Hi, Michelle, how are you doing? 
R:  I'm doing just fine.
L:  Sorry? 
R:  I'm in Texas, where are you at? 
L:  I am in Texas also, in, ah, Richardson, north of Dallas.
R:  I'm in San Marcus, I'm, like, thirty miles from Austin.
L:  Okay, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All right.
R:  And the topic of the day, what countries, if any.
L:  Oh, what countries are a threat to us? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I guess, I don't know, I consider China, North Korea, those two are kind of the worse right now anyway. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, those --  
L:  They seem to be. 
R:  -- and then isn't it -- what is it, um, not Afghanistan, the other one, Iran I think.
L:  Iran.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I'm not worried about them.  Pakistan I'm pretty worried about. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because they, -- you know, they kind of set up the Taliban and have a lot of extremists going on there and -- and their nuclear power.
R:  Yeah, especially with China.  They -- didn't they just restart their nuclear testing and all that stuff?
L:  Ah, they have probably been going on with that for a long time, I don't know.  I know they're starting a space program which is kind of like a cover for ballistic missile development.
R:  Oh, I didn't know that.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's basically why the United States started it or it's one of the reasons we started it, yeah, is to sort of, ah, research ballistic missile technology, you know,  under the cover of, ah, you know, a civilian type of thing but ah ... 
R:  Wow.
L:  So, now that's what China's trying to do. [LAUGH] But they are way behind on the technology there.
R:  Yeah, but if you think though even with the technology, what they have with their students, with them, teaching their kids, they're number one in that area, you know, compared to, you know, education.
L:  Yeah, education is very important for them.
R:  I mean here in the United States, you know, we are way on the bottom totem pole.
L:  Yeah, they're very -- they have a very disciplined, ah, structure for teaching their kids, yeah.
R:  So I can imagine, you know, what technology, if any, you know, on that, you know, nuclear --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that they have, and, ah, you know, what can be done and then with us fighting still and out there, you know, different little north of county, you know, north of, you know, of the cities, no telling what they're gonna find.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and, ah, I saw the other day, what was it, I don't know if you've ever seen that movie with Will Smith, with the cameras all over the place, satellites.
L:  Oh, yeah, they were -- um, they are spying on him and stuff. Is that --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, believe it or not, a lot of these movies that they portray is actually really happening.
L:  Mhm, yeah, to some degree, yeah.
R:  Yeah, and people just don't realise it.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ... ah, how did you find this program?
L:  I saw advertising or something on a news group somewhere.
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I saw it on a -- I go to this freebie site and, ah, -- where you can get a lot of freebie stuff. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it was on there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I find it pretty int- -- this is my second call.
L:  Yeah, I did one before too and they -- they never sent the money but then they [LAUGH] sent out an email saying that they would -- you know, they had a problem with it and they were going to send it and I'm curious to see if, ah, they're gonna follow it through.
R:  Yeah.  Hopefully it will.  It shou- -- they said in the next couple of weeks -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- so we will see what happens.  I think a lot of people emailed them and --  
L:  And complained about it.
R:  Yeah.  But, I'm thirty eight but, you know ... 
L:  Thirty eight years old? 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm twenty seven, yeah, twenty seven.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Are you a native Texan? 
R:  No, I'm not.  Ah, I say I'm Texan now because I have been here since nineteen seventy nine but I'm originally from New England.
L:  Yeah, New England? 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I moved here from Georgia.
R:  Georgia, wow.
L:  About three years ago.
R:  Are you going to school?
L:  Ah, no, I was going to school in Georgia and I moved here for a job.
R:  Right, and what they have now in the job market right now sucks.
L:  Oh yeah, it does but when I got out it was good [LAUGH] so I'm lucky.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  I'm glad I didn't stay in school any longer 'cause -- 
R:  I mean do you --  
L:  -- it started going downhill.
R:  Do you still think we have a lot more terrorists they haven't found? 
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely but I don't know if they're -- [MN] have as much, ah, willpower to do what they did because, you know, --
R:  Well, did you -- do you not too long ago that they did know about nine eleven beforehand? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And had the documentation but refused to, ah, listen about it.
L:  Well, yeah, I'm sure they had -- I'm sure they get like indications of that kind of stuff all the time, they just -- they probably didn't take it very seriously because, ah, you know, they've had, I guess, um, they just get -- they get chatter like that all the time, you know, so, just kind of sort of, you know,  kind of ignored because it didn't seem like a credible threat or something but --  
R:  Yeah.  I mean -- 
L:  Now we are sort of more -- the intelligence -- the intelligence -- intelligence community is going to be more looking out for that kind of stuff.
R:  Yeah, but to me I don't care, you know, what, you know, kind of chatter you get, I'd check into everything to make sure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they're even saying now, they had something on the news today, ah, like the Oklaho- Oklahoma bombings --  
L:  Yeah but, ah, --  
R:  Was also related to, ah, some terrorists besides Timothy McVeigh.
L:  I've -- I've heard something about that as well, that they had, ah, records of terrorists staying in Oklahoma City -- 
R:  Yeah, they're --  
L:  -- right before that and ... 
R:  Yeah, and they had, um, -- see, I listen to a Christian station. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they said there was a lady up there in Oklahoma that had over, ah, I think over a thousand pages of documentation of, you know, terrorist, ah, indications -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, they were, ah, +conversing with Timothy McVeigh and Nicholls to, you know, plan the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ... but they refuse to acknowledge it and everything else.
L:  Right.  And it's strange that he would take it to his grave with him, yeah.
R:  Right.  And like me, I am worried now because I'm a -- I'm a newly Mom, I have a two year old daughter and a single parent -- 
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  -- and, you know, I worry more so now, you know, about all these terrorists that, you know, am I going to get to see her grow up -- 
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  -- so ... it -- it makes me amazed and then all this like SARS --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- coming into play.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um ... 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, there's another one in the Chinese, Goofton[?], you know, trying to sweep it under the carpet -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but it just blew up in their face and now it's spread like crazy over there.
R:  Right, and I don't know if you are, you know, religious or anything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, you know, a lot of this stuff coming into play too, it's like, you know, they said there would be diseases there would be no cure for --  
L:  Mhm. [MN]
R:  -- and all this stuff and it makes you wonder.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, is this the trying, you know, -- part of the relations coming into play with all that's happened.  You know,  it makes you think.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So ... ah, you must have roommates or you're fidgeting around.
L:  Yeah, my wife is -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kind of getting dinner together, you kind of called at an inopportune time I guess but that's all right.
R:  Yeah, well, I put it at six o'clock because I have my daughter down, she usually goes around six o'clock so it's quiet after then.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, usually, I actually -- we eat dinner earlier than this but --  
R:  Do you all have children or ...? 
L:  No, we don't.
R:  No.  It's something to think about, you know -- 
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  -- with everything going on.  
L:  Yeah, y- -- 
R:  I never planned on having children because of -- I don't -- you know, you're young- younger than I am but when we were kids -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there could be more kids than you- were -- you know, I were growing up.  Things were a lot, you know, simpler.
L:  Yeah, they seemed that way. 
R:  You know, with my generation, the children could play outside, they could go down the street, walk by themselves and not really worry about someone trying to sell them drugs, you know -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as they do now or somebody trying -- it was around.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And there wasn't so many latchkey kids, like, you know,  probably when you were growing up.  There were a lot of latchkey kids and --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, in this situation so ...  You know, it's hard to keep a conversation going up for ten minutes.
L:  Yeah, I know what you mean.  I'm running out of things to say but --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but it's kind of [NOISE] -- it's tough if you're raising kids.  You know, we want to have kids one day too and you worry about them more, you know, because, you know, you care -- you care more about them than yourself, you know, what happens to them.
R:  Oh yeah, and, I mean, I'm not -- 
L:  You don't have control over it. 
R:  -- putting down parents today but, you know, unfortunately, you know, even with two parent homes, although these parents don't take time, they put them in front of TV, the Playstation, the computer --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they have no family time with them and, you know, this is just from me observing.  You know what I'm saying?  And they don't --  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I don't know, it's just --  
L:  The TV is the new babysitter, yeah. 
R:  Yeah, and it's like us, we don't watch a lot of TV.  If we do it's like PBS because we don't have cable so we watch educational stuff and I spend quality time with her instead of quantity.
L:  Yeah, we -- we don't have cable either.  
R:  So ...
L:  We have cable Internet but not cable TV. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  So ... oh, no, I have dial ups, that's why --
