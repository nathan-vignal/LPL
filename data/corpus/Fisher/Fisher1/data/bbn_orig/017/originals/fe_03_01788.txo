L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  [NOISE] Are you there? 
R:  Yes.
L:  [NOISE] This is Karen --
R:  Hi --
L:  -- in North Carolina. 
R:  Oh, hi, Karen.  This is Gina from Ohio.
L:  Gina in Ohio.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, we're talking about education and computers.
R:  Yes, we are, whether it harms you or helps you.  [NOISE]
L:  Or helps.  Um, well, this is my first --
R:  I just got my son off the bus.  [LAUGH]
L:  You what?  Kids getting of the bus? 
R:  I just got my son off the bus, so if it sounds loud.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, [MN] this is my first call too, so that I'm new at this, but -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, um, I think it helps if it's used in moderation.  Ah, I'm not sure how computers are used in Ohio but, um, we start our kids off using the computers in kindergarten, um, and they use them a little bit throughout the day right on through.  Um, I don't know, how about in Ohio?  Do they --
R:  Um, yes, we do have computers in our school system and -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- they -- actually --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't think they -- they did touch on it a little bit in kindergarten --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but they use it more in first grade.
L:  Right.
R:  Like, it's a daily activity.  But, like, my husband got mad at me because [LAUGH] I recently did get a new computer.  [NOISE]
L:  Ahah.
R:  And, um, -- I'm on the phone -- and, um, [SIGH] he wanted me, um, to have my son -- for me to get him on the computer and train him for one hour a day.
L:  Oh, my goodness. 
R:  And I said, "No".  [LAUGH] Um, when he gets to the point where he needs to do book reports or whatever or if he's interested in a subject, [PAUSE] you know, I will go on the c- -- I'm not on the computer a lot.
L:  Right.
R:  And I said then, "We can go in and look it up" -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- I said.
L:  So --
R:  But I think computers do help the kids in school because any more technology is towards, ah, [PAUSE] um, computers and I know that I was -- I just now recently got a new computer and it's, ah, -- [COUGH] it has educated me a lot.
L:  Right.
R:  But, being computer illiterate, I don't think you cannot be com- computer illiterate anymore.
L:  No, I agree.  I mean, I think in -- in this day and age i- i- if --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you don't have computer skills you're not marketable at all as far as finding a job.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Um, but then on the other hand, [MN] you know, that hands on, sitting down with a magazine, reading, you know -- I know people that read the magazine -- I mean, read newspapers on line.  You know, I prefer to have my newspaper in front of me to read --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, um, I think that's good for children to have that hands on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with books and learning things and going to the library and actually looking at books.  But then on the other hand, you know, especially in rural areas that don't have large libraries but they've got Internet access, you know, kids that -- as long as they can use a computer they've got this world of information that they can go to.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I mean you've got to get that -- that centre line where you're not relying too much on the computers, but you're relying enough on them so that the kids know how to use them.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, and work with them and -- I think in kindergarten and in first grade our schools, most of what they do on the computer is the accelerated reader.  Um, they do, like, little book reports.  You have to read these litty bitty nonsense books --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and then you have to answer questions, you know, about the -- the subject of the book.
R:  Exact- -- 
L:  And they learned how to point and click, you know, which basically that's learning them how to point and click and find their name and find answers, um, get them used to the computer.
R:  Right.
L:  And then, you know, they use it more obviously as they keep getting older.  They -- I've got a fifth grader and they use it quite a bit in their classroom.
R:  Right.
L:  But ...
R:  I think it's fine for the classroom, but at home, um, I don't really think the kids should be on the computer unless it is for homework.
L:  Right.
R:  Like, I don't think -- I mean -- now, I have a lot of niece and nephews that do use it for -- to write back and forth to their friends, but I think there should --
L:  Right.
R:  -- be a time limit, you know.
L:  Yeah, and I think that's with every technology. 
R:  Because you could really get -- I know if I get on there I f- -- my ti- -- the time flies.
L:  Yes.  In an hour you're like, "Whoa, it's an hour gone already".
R:  Right.  [PAUSE] [MN]
L:  And, you know, there's so many other bad things in computers that kids can get hold of.  You know, it's got to be monitored.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Um, you know, but in -- in -- in school settings now I think, you know, because there's more monitored then but, you know -- and it's -- I think it should be more of a -- I think they should teach the children how to learn to use the computers in addition to just trying to look up information.  You know, learn the ins and outs of a computer, you know, -- 
R:  Right, like how does --
L:  -- how it -- right --
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  -- how to do programming things.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, that -- and how to -- to work and -- and, like, how to do reports and stuff in the computer, not just as a research tool.  Um, you know, that's great.  You know, we had typewriters.  I'm -- I'm thirty seven years old and, you know, we had typewriters that had to do everything, and now they've got word processing on every computer, and it's, um, -- it's good for the kids to know how to -- to do -- to use that because when you can say that you can use Excel or Word or PowerPoint or something, you know, again it makes you more marketable when you get out of school, which I think is good.
R:  Right.  Ah, that came with my computer, and I'm [LAUGH] -- I -- I --
L:  You're learning.
R:  -- I typed on it, but I don't know -- like, everyone says, "Yeah, do you know how to do WordPerfect or whatever?"  I'm, like, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- well, I've used it.  I don't know if I'm doing it right.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  You know what I mean?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, like the community colleges, and they -- you know, they offer these classes on it, you know, which I've never been to one.  I just had to pick and -- and fiddle with it until I figured it out.  But --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I'm sure I could probably be more efficient with it if I actually took a class, you know.
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  Because I think -- I hope that's something that they'll -- especially in high school, they'll offer the kids, and -- and they may.  A lot of educational, you know, systems may do that, um, you know, educate them into, you know, how you can do a book report in here and how you can, you know -- just like you had typing classes, you had keyboarding classes.
R:  Right.  [MN]
L:  I -- I think that's a -- a good tool.  But, you know, I -- I've seen some areas where they seem like they rely too heavily on the computer, you know, and kids still need that hands on type stuff -- 
R:  They need --
L:  -- you know, I think.
R:  -- the dictionary and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And --
L:  You know, because it's --
R:  -- like you said, they need the library system and stuff too.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, you know, looking up a word in the dictionary, you know, got -- they've got these on line dictionaries that you just type it in and it's like [inaudible].  You know, that --
R:  In the correction part.
L:  -- instead of thumbing through a dictionary, yeah.  And, ah, word correction and everything else.  But, our -- our school systems I think here have done a pretty good job of integrating computers and, um, the -- our PTOs are try- -- or -- are buying little bit newer computers for them to use, which is, you know, helpful.  But, I've been -- we've been fortunate here.  It doesn't seem like it's -- they're taking, you know, a tremendous view of, "All right, we're going to do computers, computers, computers" --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, so we've been kind of leveled than maybe --
R:  Right.
L:  -- other school systems.
R:  Are there -- our main focus here is more reading.
L:  Really.
R:  Reading and math, and I do see the computer on, but it's not on, um, -- they go as groups.  But my --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- son's only in first grade.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, I have one in preschool.  So, [NOISE] it's not where I'm -- you know, I'm right on it.
L:  Right.
R:  I -- sometimes I get to go in and volunteer.  [LAUGH]
L:  Ahah, [LAUGH] which is always good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, I think in the earlier grades --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the computers are actually in the -- the library, which they call the resource centre now, um, and the computers are there and they go in as a group and they have, like, five at a time, you know, using, and I think that's good.  That keeps it from being -- you know, if every kid had a computer, um, at their desk then it would be used much heavily.  And we actually started in North Carolina --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, a new school.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's still part of our school system, but it's, ah, -- I can't think of the name of it, but, um, part of this is an alternative type school but if you -- when you sign up for this school y- -- every child is given a brand new computer.
R:  Oh.
L:  And part of their --
R:  That's wonderful.
L:  Yeah, and part of their assignments are that they have -- they interact with other kids -- the Edison, Edison school -- that they, um, are in contact with other Edison students, um, across the country. 
R:  Like instant --
L:  And --
R:  -- messaging and stuff. 
L:  Right, kinda, and -- and they share information and they work together on projects.  And that -- I haven't actually seen how it w- -- I mean, the school obviously is working good.  They've got a waiting list to go in it.  But I think they re- rely heavily on the computer usage and, um -- obviously if they're giving every student a -- a -- a computer as part of the agreement to go to that school.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, -- and in some areas there's a long waiting list to actually get transferred over into that because it's still a public school, but it's, um, -- you know, it's a whole different system.  And, um, you know, that's kinda -- a little bit scary because you wonder just how much, you know, -- what's it mean -- is it -- [several inaudible words] too much of the teaching doing by computer and not hands on with the teacher.
R:  And not one on one, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But then you get the classrooms that are way too big.
L:  Right.
R:  And the teacher really can't get to all of them.
L:  That's right.  So you can go and get some extra --
R:  So it's kinda like [LAUGH] -- it -- it's got its positives and negatives.
L:  Yeah.  And see w- --
R:  But then it relies more on the parents.
L:  Right, to do the --
R:  You know, on the teaching part.  But, like, my son comes home now [PAUSE] and he has tonnes of homework.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he's only in first grade.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I mean -- I don't know.  [PAUSE]
L:  And then it's -- and computers I think are becoming, you know -- I don't -- I hadn't read any percentages of [MN] what percentage of house- households have computers now, but for those households that don't have a computer, you know, it puts the child at a disadvantage --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- when every other child in the -- the class has a computer and has much more knowledge readily available, you know, every night rather than having to make a trip to the library or somewhere, um. 
R:  Right.  That's why I ended up getting a newer computer this year because I know my son's going into second grade and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- he might have to start doing reports and stuff --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because he does book reports now.
L:  Gracious.
R:  So he has to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- read and do a book report.
L:  Ahah.
R:  I mean, it's like three sentences, but, you know.
L:  Right, they still have to --
R:  So -- [LAUGH] 
L:  -- to do it.
R:  [LAUGH] -- that's a lot for first grade.
L:  Wow, in first grade.  [inaudible] a whole lot different than when I was in first grade.  Gracious.
R:  Yeah, I'm thirty six ...
