L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  My name's Alma and I live in Middletown, New Jersey.
R:  Okay.  My name is Vanessa and I live in Harleysville, Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, okay.  Is that eastern or western Pennsylvania?
R:  Um, northeastern.
L:  Oh, okay.  We live in the Burkes County area for about twenty years --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and I grew up in Pittsburgh.
R:  Oh, okay.  We're in, um -- oh, maybe it's southeastern.  We're in Montgomery County.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we've been here about six years so ...
L:  Oh, okay.  I guess our question is "Do we consider any other countries to be a threat --"
R:  Yes, to us.
L:  "-- to our security?"
R:  You can start [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Ah, well, yes, I do [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh, I just think the -- the network of terrorists in the Middle East is -- goes well beyond Iraq.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And I think probably it's possible that Syria and Saudi Arabia --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and Iran are also threatening to us.
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, I don't know.  You -- can you think of any others [LAUGH] or what do you think of those?
R:  I -- I -- agree with, um -- I agree with, um -- with those three that you chose, Syria, Iran and Iraq.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Syria, Iran and Saudi Arabia, um, they have a facade of being friendly toward us but, you know, they're not and -- and it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it shows when you find out where people are going to hide at and when you see the links, it's kinda like a connect the dots.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, somebody el- -- but another country I think that -- that's dangerous is, um, China.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think North Korea is.
L:  Definitely North Korea.
R:  And I actually think Russia is, too [LAUGH].  Well, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, I -- I just do, just watching them and, um, I -- you don't know where Russia c- really where they're standing at.  Although there's been a lot of changes, um, I'm sure once they dig deeper they'll find that there's weapons of any kind of destruction, not just mass destruction but any --
L:  Right.
R:  -- kind of destruction from Russia because I know it's a poor economy and right now, they're trying to make money any way they can and I think that they --
L:  I agree.  They also -- the Russian Mafia, I think, is also very strong so there's a good deal of corrupt political influence in Russia.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  And it -- it -- it -- it doesn't -- I think what our society doesn't look like it, but I think that it is.  I really do.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, which is really quite unfortunate but that's just the way it is, right?
L:  Yes, and -- and North Korea -- we have poured billions into North Korea.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I guess it was during the Clinton administration that Jimmy Carter went over there and --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- kinda promised them billions in foreign aid for not developing nuclear weapons and, uh --
R:  And now you find out that they have them --
L:  Uh, right [MN].
R:  -- and that they're going to continue to work on them --
L:  Right.  So, you wonder --
R:  -- and, um --
L:  [LAUGH] you -- you start really wondering about foreign aid.  Is it really accomplishing what we were hoping to accomplish with it?
R:  Right, and I know that, um -- that this was a little blip on the, um, news wire, uh, during the beginning of the conflict that we just were in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that the United States discovered that Iran's weapons -- Iran's nuclear capabilities far surpasses what anybody thought.
L:  Hm.
R:  It didn't get a lot of play but I watched the news --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I watched it avidly and I caught that.  I actually caught that that Iran --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- has, um, quite an interest in developing nuclear weapons and they got quite a few.  It's the plants that the US knew they had were far surpassed when -- when we found out.
L:  Hm.  That -- that's frightening because it's makes you wonder which [MN] --
R:  What else is going on?
L:  Exactly [LAUGH].  What other --
R:  Well, you don't know now.
L:  -- what capabilities the other countries have that we don't know about [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, that we really don't know about but I guess, for me, I, um, I was reading, um -- I get this magazine called Zion's Fire and it talks about the different countries --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it links 'em to biblical things --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, you know, for a while now it's been like reading, you know, the newspaper.  You open up your bible and you read, "Well, this is what's going to go on in Syria and this is what's going to go on here" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you see it and -- and it's not, um -- it's there and -- and it's kinda interesting the way it's reported when you're reading your bible and you see what it says, and I'm like, "Well, I wanna go see" because I get curious and I'm like, "I wanna go see" you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I started reading it and just the way it lines up with what biblical history shows and what our history of the enemy show it's, like, really, really incredible.  I was, like, shocked and I was thinking --
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  -- wow, this is kinda amazing.
L:  --very frightening 'cause you know, I guess I've read several places that Armageddon is supposed to start in that area of the world --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- and that certainly seems like a -- like a possibility [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, 'cause you're -- you're -- I'm reading it and I -- I know, um I was thinking I'm like, "Well what are Syria in all of this" you know.  She's not -- Syria is not going to sit quietly by doing all of this, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and then you look at what Syria is doing and you look at what the bible says is gonna happen.  I'm like, "How in the heck is Syria gonna get to that point, you know.  I don't understand" but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, but it's quite amazing, uh, our foreign relations policy.  I think we've had this quite open foreign relations policy and to the detriment of our security and our safety here.
R:  I -- I agree.  I mean, no other country is -- allows people in the way we do.
L:  Right.  I mean --
R:  Or -- or the way -- I mean, we used to have very strict controls on how people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- came into this country.  If you weren't able to support yourself and you weren't healthy --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you didn't come in which is still, I think, probably the way the majority of countries --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- limit im- immigration and --
L:  I agree.  I know my sister -- she's been living in Holland for the last sixteen years --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she's dual citizen but before she could even go there, she had to have a job.
R:  Right.
L:  And I was -- I was amazed at their policies on immigrants and stuff compared to ours.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We open our borders.
R:  Well, we've -- we've taken political correctness to a ridiculous extreme.
L:  Well, yeah.  I -- I -- I -- I agree [NOISE] I agree.
R:  And, like you say, it's certainly compromising our security.
L:  Yeah, and to me that's -- that's incredible because the President we have now has to deal with some of the mistakes that past Presidents made.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, he does face it.  Nobody wants to admit that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it makes it look like he's the bad guy and that he doesn't have real foreign policy [NOISE] but I thought the move that he made [NOISE] considering everything that's been going on, I think that move that he made to attack Iraq was really a good one because it made North Korea say, "Well, maybe we better go back to the bargaining table".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because I believe that's why they did it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that could well be, you know.
L:  So, then -- now they're beginning to, uh, talk about some things and bargaining but it's still kinda scary because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the bottom line is is we toughed[?] a lot of countries and they're not standing beside us --
L:  No.
R:  -- and they've actually helped our enemies right under our noses --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, uh, I think that's why all the protesting has been going on and stuff like that because --
L:  Well, it's -- it's also spring and they're college students [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I think a lot of college students will go out -- I mean, you know, it's something to do.
R:  Well, yeah --
L:  I -- I don't know how informed their -- their opinions are.
R:  Well, I was a college student once and if it's anything like, um, what I learnt when I was at Penn State --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you have your ultra liberal in- instructors who --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- toe the policy line and they'll even lie to the students and stuff to convince them that something is reality when it's really not.  Um, and if they're the ones that's teaching the kids about foreign policy, that's a real scary thing, too [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Absolutely.
R:  That is scary because I just remember back in my classes at college --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and this hasn't been like that long ago and just the things that we were taught and how kids aren't taught to think critically and they don't question and, um, the instructors -- there's some -- especially if he's a well written and well known instructor --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- his word is [NOISE] like the gospel and I saw that a lot.  Especially when we talk about foreign relations.  I know a lot of instructors say George Bush doesn't have a good foreign relation program.
L:  Mhm, and -- and you're right.  The educational establishment tends to be ultra liberal --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at a lot of schools and, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and they've put, I think, social engineering well ahead of giving kids -- and it's not only on the college level, it's below that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's --
R:  Yeah, that's why I homeschool [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so when my kids go to sch- college they'll have a foundation --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they'll know certain things, you know.  And they know where we stand and then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they'll figure out for themselves where they wanna stand but at least they'll be given the truth about our foreign policy and why --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we're the way we are and why we choose to stand on a side that we stand on, uh --
L:  Yeah, and basically, you know, the school that -- the schools should get out of their social engineering and begin teaching --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- basic hard -- basic subjects again.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think we're falling well behind in -- in terms of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, education and -- and employability.
R:  Right, right.
L:  You look at the large corporations now and you look at the proportion --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of the students there or the workers there --
R:  Right.
L:  -- who are from other countries --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they seemed to have received much better education, particularly in the sciences, than our students do.
R:  Yeah, and then we l- -- we've let them come over here and learn a lot of stuff.  They're re-
