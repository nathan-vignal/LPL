L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  This is -- this is Mandy.
R:  Hi, this is Bonnie from Minnesota.
L:  Oh, I'm in Ohio.
R:  In where?
L:  Ohio.
R:  Oh, hi.  Ah, this can be interesting topic to discuss.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, have you done one of these calls before?
L:  Actually I did one earlier today.  I initiated the call instead of them calling me.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  So I think maybe this call wasn't so [inaudible] for me, [LAUGH] but maybe, you know, I don't know, maybe it was.  Um, I don't know if they just have the same person on two topics or not, I mean, the same topic, but okay we can talk about it again anyway. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Ah, what do you think?  Do you think other countries are really a threat to us?
L:  [NOISE] I've just heard that, um, North Korea has [SIGH] the, ah, nuclear weapons and that kind of makes me think that they are, ah, possibly a threat.
R:  Especially since they're saying that they might be able to reach the, ah, west coast of the United States, that's pretty scary.
L:  Oh, that's right.  I heard that, that they were saying that, um, France can reach us. [LAUGH] That was another one that we had to discuss was France. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Right I don't -- yeah, France -- I think France is just, ah, [LIPSMACK] sort of nodding towards the United States.  I don't really think they're a threat.  I think they just dislike us, they look down their nose on us.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Ah. [MN]
L:  Do you see how White Castles call them freedom fries? 
R:  Yeah, exactly. 
L:  And then I heard something else called freedom toast instead of raisin toast.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I guess, like, ah, French wine and Evian Water and things aren't selling too well which is fine.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, although, you know, um, I'm sure this isn't supposed to be a political conversation, but -- 
L:  Right, I'm not -- see, I'm not sure what they meant by threat.  Were they specific about that, about what they meant by threat? [NOISE] No. 
R:  Well, I guess -- I guess they mean whether -- 
L:  [NOISE] I'll call you back later.
R:  -- um, we really expect.
L:  What countries do you think is a threat right now. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  That we're talking about, um. 
R:  Yeah, um, you know, I suppose the problem is that we had, you know, the media built up what they want and President Bush with his axis of evil, you know, with Iran and, um, Iraq and -- 
L:  You know, it's pretty much where I'm getting all my information here. [inaudible] 
R:  Exactly, exactly, and you really wonder, um, if you consider the people that live in those countries, ah, other than a few that are -- that are maybe terrorists, but I -- I would say that ninety nine per cent of the people in those countries are absolutely no threat for us.  They just want to live in peace -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and let other people live in peace but I guess there are always going to be some radicals.  But, you know, like the anthrax, though, you know, in the very beginning we thought, "Oh, that must be somebody from another country", but it looks now like that was sent from -- by another American.
L:  Yeah, like the Oklahoma City bombing.
R:  Yo, yeah. Right.
L:  Our own country is a threat to itself. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, I -- I don't think that many countries really, um, you know, really care what goes on here.  They, you know, they might look down their noses at us and think we're, you know, some awful country, but I certainly don't think they're any threat to us other than a few radicals but, um, -- 
L:  Yeah, I don't see any countries benefit in threatening us or -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I mean, you know, in a way we were cert- certainly taken by surprise on September eleventh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because we were used to just other countries leaving us alone.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, you know, that was really the -- the first time.  I mean, we haven't had any suicide bombings or, ah, anything like that from people from other countries.  You know, they've attacked our embassies in other countries but nothing on the United States soil.
L:  Yeah, not much goes on on our soil, huh? [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not much, ah, [inaudible] any way.
R:  I really expected, you know, after the war started in Iraq that, you know, maybe we'd have some suicide bombings or some kind of terrorist attacks but, you know, haven't yet.
L:  I -- yeah, I think I expected more than what there is going on. [LAUGH] There hasn't been anything here.
R:  Exactly, and I don't know if it's because our, you know, FBI and CIA or something, are -- are actually catching the people before they can do anything or, you know, if it was just, you know, nobody's that interested.  I mean, they may talk about attacking us but you know, as for, ah, actually doing it, um, I don't think it's real likely.
L:  Yeah, let's go lie low for a while. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Maybe.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I thought maybe -- I thought maybe September eleventh --
L:  [NOISE] [inaudible]
R:  -- would, you know, people saw that they could attack the United States that they might, ah, go, oh, maybe we can do that too and, ah, I think we've been lucky that that's really the only -- only attack that we've had.
L:  Yeah, really?  They don't have any other allies as far as, um, that we're aware of.  They -- they just shut themselves by making themselves an enemy out of pretty much everybody.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, another caller I spoke with earlier today, um, mentioned communism as a factor in it, just that they view things differently than we do.
R:  Oh, yeah, people are always going to have their own views and their, you know, --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- their own beliefs and they may think we're crazy for not having the same beliefs.  But, you know, as for attacking people, ah, I don't think there are that many people in the world that want to attack anybody else other than in Palestine and Israel, I guess.
L:  That's true, yeah.
R:  But, um, you know, um, like, we really haven't heard much about Syria other than that they think they're taking in people from Iraq or Iran who's supposed to be a big enemy of ours.  Um, it's not -- it's not like we have other countries threatening us now, you know, because of what we did in Iraq.
L:  Mm.
R:  That I've heard anyway.  But I, ah, you know, it's -- it would be nice to be able to get news from somewhere other than our, you know, normal news sources.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just to hear what other countries are really saying because we -- we don't really get that at all.
L:  I'm wondering is this -- is this, um, considered over now because I haven't seen as much coverage on the TV [LAUGH] about it.
R:  Right, exactly.  It's sort of really died down.
L:  We almost had our TV on, either CS- ah, CNN or Fox news on constantly.  We had our TV on that. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly, yeah. 
L:  And now it's just, you know, regular TV. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, yes, oh, so nice when they weren't having commercials there for a while.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But that didn't last very long unfortunately. [LAUGH] 
L:  I heard also some of the, um, the stocks that we had went up, so [LAUGH] I'm happy about that.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Like Microsoft and, um, oh, what is it, Intel, maybe, the computer, kind of dot com kind of American business kind of thing.  It's like [MN] Cisco and GE -- definitely, GE, things like it went up enough that it made a big difference.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  In the 401K thing. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I thought -- I thought Toyota had said it wasn't going to advertise during the course of the war but I guess they saw everybody else went back to advertising so I notice they were having ads again.
L:  Are they the one with the new mini van that the kids helped design?  [LAUGH] Is that Toyota?
R:  I think so.
L:  I just saw the commercial today, I want one of those. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I didn't really -- I didn't really say, "Okay, well, that's not an American car" or, you know, anything about that 'cause I know they [SIGH] -- some people make an issue about their -- their car, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I don't know, I really don't.
R:  I don't -- I don't know what's going on with North Korea.  I think that's -- I don't know, I've -- I've heard a lot of people say that, ah, you know, they're just trying to get some concessions from us by -- by saying they're starting their nuclear weapon program again, but -- 
L:  You mean by concessions is that a nicer thing?  We won't bomb you if you do this for us. [LAUGH] Yeah. 
R:  Well, I guess we -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, according to my son, and he knows a lot more about it, he's in college, than I do, they're such a poor country.  I mean, -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know, are they really going to send a nuclear bomb over here?  I mean, we would obliterate them.  I mean, they're a very small country.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I don't know what their military is like.  Um, but I think -- 
L:  Christa, quiet.
R:  -- I think they just want us to, you know, send 'em food and, um, whatever else they need which wouldn't be such a bad idea I guess so long as they were out and about and -- 
L:  [NOISE] [inaudible]
R:  -- surrounded by corn fields and, you know, they're paying people not to grow corn.  Well, why not grow the crops and send it to people that need it?
