R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Shaun.
L:  Hi, my name is Mary.
R:  Hi.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.  
R:  Good.
L:  I'm from Pennsylvania.
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  I'm from Pennsylvania.
R:  Ah, me too.  I'm in Philadelphia right now.
L:  Okay.  I'm in Pittsburgh.
R:  Okay.
L:  Okay; and this is my first call. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mine too. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] So it's computers in education.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH] Would you like to start? [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah, sure.  I guess I think that computers in education are very helpful.  I, um, actually have a degree in elementary education and so -- I decided not to teach --
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  -- [inaudible] doing student teaching and everything, I was, you know -- it's a second grade class and they used, you know, computers.  They had computer lab every day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, [MN] [NOISE] I would say that [NOISE], I mean, they have to be obviously very closely monitored.  [NOISE] 
R:  Right.
L:  But I think that -- I don't know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, um, well, I -- I don't have that kind of experience with --
L:  [SIGH]  
R:  -- kids that you have other -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- than friends' kids -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- but, um -- and -- and my schooling was before there was a lot of computers --
L:  Right.
R:  -- available, um, but, um, yeah, it seems to me that it -- for the most part it's very helpful.  Um, I -- I've heard that it's gotten a knock of -- it allows people to find things too easily and you lose the skills of doing -- being able to do research and -- and -- and what it means to go to a library and --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- actually look stuff up.
L:  That's definitely true.  I remember i- in high school not spending [NOISE] so much time at the library, or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- even in junior high, and then once they got in college then, you know, more computers became more, you know, readily available and you actually had computer classes and that, you -- you would never step foot in a library. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, right.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, see, even when I was in college I took computer programming and they had us working with Fortran [LAUGH] which --
L:  [inaudible] Yeah.  [MN]  
R:  -- wasn't quite as helpful [LAUGH] -- 
L:  No. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- as the PCs of today, so, um, ...
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, when we were growing up we had our Texas instrument [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Right, right  
L:  -- and then pretty much, do you know, like, type in adventure games and stuff, but that's pretty much all we did when we -- 
R:  C- -- 
L:  -- were growing up.
R:  Can I ask how old you are?
L:  I'm thirty.
R:  You're thir- -- I'm forty.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, ah, yeah, um -- yeah, I mean, we had a high -- um, a computer in high school but -- you know, with sort of like all -- a central computer --  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with a couple of different terminals and -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and all -- the thing I -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- mainly remember doing with that is -- is, um, you know, programming stuff in Basic and playing games was about it, so ...
L:  Yeah, I think all we did was write little programs to make your name blink on the screen or --
R:  Right, right.  
L:  -- something like that.  You know, kids are [LAUGH] so silly [inaudible]. [NOISE]  
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I have some friends who have, like, a ten year -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- old -- a couple of ten year old twin girls -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and they're, you know, more proficient than the parents are and, um -- but I -- you know, I really can't say how much they actually use it for education.
L:  Yeah, actually in the classroom, and [inaudible] since I haven't been there, you know, for a while --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I don't know, but at home, I mean, [NOISE] we've done -- we actually have a very sick cat and I've done tons of research. [LAUGH] I've spent more time --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- on the Internet in the last few weeks just learning about, you know, different treatments and that for her.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think I've gotten, you know, so much more information than I would've ever gotten just talking to the vets and stuff.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I would have to say for myself, I mean, that's the first place I go --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is the computer when I want to look something up nowadays and it's just -- it's -- it's such a great tool.  I mean, I -- I just love it and -- and being able to just punch something in and -- and come up with just a ton of information.  Um, you know, for -- so for my own self education it's [LAUGH] been great --
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  -- if there's something I'm interested in, you know.  It's, um -- i- it's a fantastic tool, um.  So, um, yeah, for -- for f- -- that aspect of it, ah, I really like it.  I like it a lot.  I think -- 
L:  Yeah, I think -- 
R:  -- it's a great thing.
L:  I can't -- I guess the -- the biggest downfall would probably be -- with children would be not going to a library and actually looking things up on, you know -- in books.  But --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for adults and that [inaudible], you know, I think it's terrific.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  When, um, -- you know, and books can end up being outdated very -- 
L:  That's right. 
R:  -- quickly, especially compared to this stuff that's out on the Net, so ...  But, ah, what else to say about it? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's not -- it's not my -- my favorite topic [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or one that [LAUGH] I know a whole lot about.  [inaudible] 
R:  Yeah, yeah, when I fir- -- when I first heard what it was, I was like, "Mm, what am I going to say about this?" [LAUGH]  
L:  [several inaudible words] like, "Oh, it's my first phone call.  Do I press one?" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [MN] I'm just trying to think of wh- what I've heard on the news about it and what not and, um, um, --  
L:  Lately there doesn't -- y- you know, I think it's kinda died down some.  You know, at one point there was, you know, a lot more controversy and that, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- no, I don't think I've heard too much about it.
R:  Right.  I take it you don't have kids?
L:  Nope, not yet.  [LAUGH]
R:  N- no t- -- [MN] I don't eith- either.  So, ah, I guess having them would obviously give us a lot more [LAUGH] experience [inaudible] --
L:  Probably.
R:  -- but, ah, yeah, um, --  
L:  [MN] Yeah, I know, I'm pretty much on it every single day looking something up --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- even if it's just recipes or -- we, um, just bought a house and my husband's constantly looking up, you know, different how to projects and stuff --  
R:  Right.  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- and ... [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, i- it can be helpful for that.  Sometimes it can be difficult to actually find stuff too and -- and, ah, you know, you put in something and you get so many things that are actually advertisements.
L:  Tha- that's -- the advertising is bad and you could be totally sidetracked.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  I'll go to look up one thing and then two hours later [LAUGH] you realise --
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know you've been led in so many different directions and --
R:  I've had that happen many times too -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [inaudible].
L:  Or up way too late [LAUGH] --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- thinking, "Oh, I really should go to bed now" and then I'm off reading, um, all different kind of crazy things.
R:  Yeah.  But I -- I -- I've also have looked up how to stuff and actually sometimes had trouble finding stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, just because i- i- it is like -- [MN] most of what comes up is something for companies or -- 
L:  That's right.
R:  -- or, you know, something that they want you to pay for --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, or I'll put something into a forum to -- to try to do a search and -- and the things that come up aren't really the subject that I'm looking for, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, you know, and I wonder how much -- you know, with kids how much they get taught how to actually look things up and --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- and -- and do their own self filtering that -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- way, you know.  I -- I'd be -- actually, I'd -- you know, I'd be kind of curious to know how, ah -- how they are taught that and, um, you know -- and how to discern what's actually valuable from, you know, -- 
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- and how much they get targeted wi- with advertising and --
L:  That's right.  Y- you know what'd be scary?  You'd have to, like, actually sit there and really, really monitor what they watch, because they could be led all over the place.
R:  Right, right.  Yeah, I can imagine.
L:  I guess there are things, though -- there's -- I think there's some- something like on -- you can block TV channels and that.  There's probably something you can use to block --
R:  I know there is software out there, yeah, for, ah, preventing them from getting to porn sites and that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- kind of thing, um.  But, ah, yeah, I -- I don't know.  Tha- that's -t's interesting and --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, a- actually, ah, it's kinda piqued my curiosity on kinda like [MN] I'm going to go to [MN] a couple of my friends that have kids and ask them about that [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, because --
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] because I would be -- I would be a nervous wreck.  That would be a full time job just [LAUGH] always peeking in and seeing what they were [LAUGH] [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah, yeah.  But tha- -- yeah, that is interesting and, ah --  
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and -- and I just don't know, I mean, how -- [MN] like, different school systems -- how -- how they differ as far as [MN] access to computers and do -- does -- does each kid have one or is it just one per classroom and -- 
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- you know, what kind of time kids actually get to spend on them.
L:  When I was there, they pretty much -- they had a computer class every day that they all went to in the lab --  
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and then I think in the classroom they had one computer, but it was more like -- like when they had -- like, their free time.  There were different stations, so they could go, you know, to the arts and craft station or they can go to the computer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they had -- just that they didn't have Internet access in the classroom -- and so they could just have their different software on there so they could, you know, work on their story or --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- you know, play a math game or something.
R:  And this was, you said, second graders?
L:  This was second grade, yeah. 
R:  Okay.  That's interesting.  And -- and how long ago was that? 
L:  This was [MN] -- I graduated at college in ninety five, so, like, ninety six?
R:  Okay.
L:  Ninety six, ninety seven.  
R:  Okay.
L:  It seems like a long time ago. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, in the computer world it is a long time ago.
L:  It really is. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, it's amazing this stuff they a- actually have on cell phones now and you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- are able to access the Internet and -- 
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  -- um, you know, you wonder where it's going to keep evolving to and --  
L:  Oh, yeah, it's impossible to keep -- keep up to date and keep equipment up to date.  My husband, he does a lot of programming stuff and that, and he's constantly buying new equipment and everything. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  He now wants a new -- some kind of new software and that.
R:  Yep, yep.  Yeah, I know how that is too. [LAUGH] [PAUSE] Well, um, I'm trying to think of what else I could say about computers in education.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Ah, um, [MN] --
