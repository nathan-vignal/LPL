R:  Hi. I'm --
L: [NOISE]
R:  -- Tony.
L:  Hi, I'm Deatta[?].
R:  How you doing?
L:  Just fine.  Do you have an opinion --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on the topic? [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, well, yeah, I believe, um, [LIPSMACK] well, a lot more is countries that -- that we have to worry about [LIPSMACK] and, but see, mines is different, because I'm going for a [NOISE] -- on a biblical stance.
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  Yes.  And -- and knowing the Bible and knowing what's going down now with the world --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- has a lot to do with making or coming of a one world [NOISE] country or government, [NOISE] as it said, the new world orders.  Um, [COUGH] I mean, you know, everybody has bombs, everybody wants control and just for us, as being [NOISE] a nation who's only been in existence for a little over four hundred and fifty years, and having other nations who've been around for at least five thousand plus years, we're a baby nation who comes into the world screaming peace, and everybody's mad, you know, we're -- 'cause there's the land of milk and honey, [NOISE] you know, and --
L:  So, they're jealous, is what you're saying?
R:  Yes, very much so.
L:  Oh.  So, are you coming --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when you're saying a biblical stance, you're talking about the Christian Bible? [NOISE]
R:  Yes, I am. [NOISE]
L:  Okay.  So --
R:  Or even -- or even -- or even if you want to go -- I don't really know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- too much, I can't read Hebrew, but it's still basically from the Hebrew Bible also.
L:  Okay.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Hm.  So ... [NOISE] do you think that ... that there are certain areas of the world that are more of a threat to the US?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] as of now, [SIGH] see, i- -- that's like a trick question.  Um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because, I mean, you could say, "Well, North Korea, look at what they're coming up with" and then, if you want to say China, I mean, Ch- -- how long has China been asleep for?  China been asleep for, like, four hundred years, and all of a sudden they wake up, and they wanna talk to the world, and there was a -- they were a self sufficient, they never traded with anybody, you know, and all of sudden, they got input --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- into what's going on in the world, and for immediate threat, I'm gonna say no.  For a future threat, yes.  There's a --
L:  Oh -- oh, in China?
R:  Uh, well, n- -- I mean, I'll say China and I'm going to say Iraq, I'm going to say Syria, I'm going to say Africa, I'm going to say all tho- -- all the countries that -- even France.  All the countries that really not with us are going to jump on us, because of the simple fact is, who are we to sit here and to delegate our lifestyle onto another country?  And in doing that, and because of our spiritual beliefs or what nations we're under, you know, it's, like, well, i- it's like the thing where you're saying, "Well, don't push your religion on me" but then you flip around and push yours on somebody else.  And that kind of sense.  And I believe it's a spiritual battle that's been going on since the day Adam and Eve destroyed themself within the garden, so [LAUGH] --
L:  So, do you think that that's why Bush, uh, attacked Iraq, was basically --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- from -- from a religious standpoint?
R:  Um, yes, but not in his eyes. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Oh.
R:  It's one thing -- it's one thing about human beings, we look at things in two different lights.  Okay, i- some of us look at it spiritual, and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some of us look at it as doing the right thing according to man.  I don't think he actually knew -- know the outcome of what he started --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, but he believed that he was doing the right thing.  Do I think it's from a spiritual thing?  No, I think it's more from a political and money and oil and things of that nature.
L:  But -- but in your mind, it was the right thing to do?
R:  Yes.  In my mind, it was the right thing to do.
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean, it's like you're having a bully in the world, or a bully at your school.
L:  [MN]
R:  If a bully jumps on you and beats you up every day, you don't do nothing about it, he'll keep messing with you.  But nine times out of ten, if you stand up to him, show him you're not afraid anymore and you're not going to take it any more, they back down.
L:  Mm.  Huh.
R:  And so -- and so, what e- -- if we didn't do something [NOISE] about what had happened, whether if we picked the wrong country or nothing, or -- or -- or the wrong country, if we put up or bow down now, and so checked it out, "This is what we're not going to do", you know?  And where the --
L:  But -- so, you don't think that that set a precedent, um, b- because we had never attacked, basically attacked a country without them blowing, y- you know, hitting us first --
R:  Well --
L:  -- in some way.
R:  -- yes, okay.  Yeah, I -- and I understand and I agree with you a hundred percent, we haven't did that, but we have to understand what the United States stands for also.  Outta every other country there is, if they go to war, let's say if Iraq went to war with Iran, they'll take over Iran and keep it.  We're the only nation that'll beat you up and they give you back your country and help you rebuild it.
L:  Mm.  So, that makes it okay?
R:  No, I'm not s- saying it makes it okay.  But what I'm saying is that it's deeper than what we think, you know, as human beings.  I believe, like I said, it's a spiritual thing, whether if it was Bush, if it was President Clinton, if it was Jimmy Carter, it's not -- it's not our hands that really at work within this.  You know, we say, you know, it's human, it's us, it's Bush, I think it's two greater powers that's been at this battle for a long time, and things will just have to play out, and then there's --
L:  Okay.  So --
R:  --  other coun- --
L:  So, it's fate, or --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- or -- or predetermined?
R:  Yeah, it's predetermined, better yet.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, you could say it like that.  And --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you know, us as human beings, we're going to protest it, "Oh, this is wrong, this is that and that and this", you know?  Uh, but -- and I -- I mean, I have these conversations all the time, and that's just like me saying to other people, the same ones who protest the war [LAUGH] are the same ones who are willing to, um, have an abortion.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, what's the difference between killing a unborn child, but then you -- to going over there fighting for your country, you know?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, this is like a deep topic for me, and I'm trying to go off the subject.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.  But are -- are we fighting for our country?  I mean, were we?
R:  Are we fight- --
L:  Were we?
R:  Um --
L:  In Iraq?
R:  In Iraq?
L:  Or in Iran?
R:  Are -- are -- were we fighting for our country?  Yes.
L:  Mm.
R:  In the sense of, you know, these are countries, even though they have their own spiritual and, uh, religious personalities, yes, I believe so, because when another person will take their own life to kill ten other people, you need to shut them up --
L: O- o- -- ok --
R:  -- because they have --
L:  -- okay, if you're -- if you're coming from a religious base and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we're going over there, but we're going to give them back their country, they're not going to become Christian.
R:  No.
L:  And -- and you're saying --
R:  And -- a- --
L:  -- you're coming from a Christian --
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  -- viewpoint.
R:  -- and -- and in that sense, and that sense is, no, they don't have to become Christian, because that's not what we're trying to do as a nation, we're not trying to make them Christian, more a democratic type thing, but not Christian, and they going to keep their religion.  But on the -- on the other hand of what I'm saying is that if you were to believe in a God and you were to believe in a Satan, and this was a war between them two, and we're just stuck in the middle of it, that's a different thing, if we're not looking in human eyes.  Let's say that -- let's say Satan wanted us to jump on I- Iraq.  Okay, so he did this, he made the Towers get blown up, because he knew we were going to react to it, so we react to it.  Now, the other world is watching us, all of the world is watching us and says, "Well, who are these people to jump on these people, not knowing if it was them or not?"  Okay, then it says, okay, now everybody says, "Well, we're afraid of the United States".  The United States --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is a strong country, but united together we can destroy them.
L:  Oh.
R:  You understand what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  And is that -- do you think that's going to happen?
R:  Oh, yeah.  I believe that's definitely going to happen.  I mean, first -- I mean, 'cause in the Bible it says, "In the end there will be wars or rumors of wars".  We've been having that for quite a while now.
L:  So --
R:  It says, but those -- but it says that there will come a time when they will scream for peace, and don't believe the peace, for it won't last long.  So, right now --
L:  So, you think that Armageddon's around the corner?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  On my personal belief, you know, and I don't press my beliefs on nobody else --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but my personal belief, yes.  I believe this, what just happened here, was a sign of what's to come.  It's -- it's starting the ball rolling.  And, yes, there's other countries that do not like us, and in the end, they gonna destroy us.
L:  I- -- a Middle East country, do you think?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  Well, I mean, it's everybody who's, like I said, I won't even say Middle East --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'll say everybody who's not and who don't understand or believe in what we stand for.  How's that?  So, that could be --
L:  Okay.  Does that -- does
