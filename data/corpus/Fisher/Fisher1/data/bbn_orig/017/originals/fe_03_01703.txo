L:  Hi, uh, the -- I'm R- --
R:  Hello.
L:  I'm Robin Jackson.
R:  I'm Dorinda.
L:  Oh, hi, Dorinda. [LAUGH]
R:  Hello.
L:  Um --
R:  I'm in -- I'm in California.
L:  I'm in Washington State.
R:  Ah.  Everybody I've talked to has been in Washington State. [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  Yes.
L:  Uh, well, the only person I've talked -- I've missed two calls, but the only person I've talked to was in California also.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, well, I suppose, the Middle East --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the unrest, [NOISE] um, it's -- it's never stopped [LAUGH] it seems to me.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I don't think that -- it's not -- I don't know that it's ever -- it's going to be workable.  In the Middle East, there are so many different religions and issues and --
L:  [NOISE] And --
R:  -- so much ... [NOISE]
L:  I know, and I mean, I think maybe -- I think there -- it's possible to have a peace in the Middle East but that is only, I think, after other countries and other religions all take some stand on trying to understand, rather than take over.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  It's, like, we -- we don't even understand the Middle Eastern religions or their cultures that well, and -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and sometimes we're trying to tell them what to do, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  I think that it's going to take some cooperation from more than just one end of it.  I think everybody's going to have compromise and give a little bit.
L:  I think so too.  Um, there's this guy who is running against Sharon in --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- Israel and I- I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- didn't know that much about him, but it just seemed like the issues that he wanted to get done were [SIGH] wonderful, you know?  It's, like, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as far as -- as b- being able to, um, give the Palestinians their own area and -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and Sharon was a hardliner, but he won --
R:  Right.
L:  -- anyway.  So, I don't know.  Maybe there is -- maybe there -- I think it's all unfair to each other, but, ah ... I don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's got to start with the children, I think, if they're raised to, uh, not hold grudges or --
R:  Right. Ra- --
L:  -- swallow some of their pride.
R:  [NOISE] Right, hold some tolerance and ...
L:  Yeah, I mean, like here --
R:  [MN] --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  I think also the United States, I think that we can be helpful in -- in, uh, maybe helping show how to live democratically and -- and try to live with cultural diversities, 'cause we have so many different cultures here in the United States, we can maybe help them learn some cultural diversity, but I don't -- I think that sometimes that, um, some of the issues we need to pull out of.
L:  I do too.
R:  I think we're not -- I think that, you know, I think that we're not, um ... you know, we get into ever- -- we get into a lot of stuff that's better left [SIGH] to them, 'cause then ever- -- or -- 'cause then everybody thinks the United States is, like, the bad guys and that we're not --
L:  I know.
R: -- [MN] you know?  And we send so much money and I -- I have a real problem with us sending so much money to all these countries and then in our own country we have people who are homeless and starving.
L:  Exactly.  I know.
R:  You know, and, you know, it's like --
L:  Plus, you know, sometimes we help 'em and it's for our agenda, not theirs.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  And, uh --
R:  Right.  And I don't think they -- I don't think the people who really need the help are the ones that get the money.
L:  I don't either.
R:  I think that the poor little kids you see starving on the streets are the same ones who are still and poor and starving on the street --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and some big politician over there is getting another raise or whoever their -- whatever their government is set up, like a prime minister or whoever is getting the money, not the -- 
L:  Yeah, there should be --
R:  -- people who need it.
L:  -- more of an accountability.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, you know, and plus our own media, you know, d- dis- -- you know, displays us as, ah, entertainment, you know, and, uh, "Oh, we're just ri- -- we're all rich, young and thin" and --
R:  Oh, yeah, we all got --
L:  -- you know, and it doesn't help our [LAUGH], you know, I wish they would show some of the slums of our country and --
R:  Absolutely, because --
L:  -- and how some of these people live.
R:  Right.  Uh, we've had foreign exchange students, and they have thought that our country is everybody's rich and everybody just goes to Disneyland whenever they want and --
L:  I know.  I had one t- -- I had an exchange student too.
R:  Yeah, and that -- and it creates such a problem, because they come over here thinking they're going to be on the go doing something every single day they're here and then they get such a disappointment, such a culture shock when they find out everybody's not living in Beverley Hills.
L:  Yeah, that we're normal. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or, um, you know, the -- plus a lot of people who come over here, they c- -- they arrive in New York City which isn't exactly, um, the place that would represent the whole country, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Right, absolutely not.
L:  But as far as, um, what's going on in the Middle East, I -- I think eventually, if they -- if we all learn to condition ourselves for tolerance.
R:  Right, I think what's -- what happens though is that they train their children, yeah, I mean you -- you s- see it all the time on the news, you have these little kids walking around, three or four years old with -- with, uh, machine guns.
L:  I know, and what about the one that was -- they dressed up as a suicide bomber?
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it's -- it --
R:  And -- and --
L:  And -- and they're -- 
R: [NOISE]
L:  -- they believe that -- that to do that is the ultimate sacrifice and, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if they do do that, the family is generously compensated.
R:  Oh right.  But, see -- but the child, I mean that child, really at that age, is not old enough to make that kind of a decision for themselves.
L:  I know.
R:  They -- 
L:  Look at all -- look at --
R:  -- they really don't understand death.
L:  They just think their parents are always right.
R:  Right.  Well, they don't understand the concept totally of death, because it -- it's so, you know, in news, like you were saying, in media it's all glorified to these people they see die on TV the next day -- week they're back, you know, they're back alive, so the kids don't realise that --
L:  That's right, that's right.
R:  -- you know, and they're [MN] --
L:  They don't get it. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, and then they're sending these little kids off to these training camps to learn how to kill.
L:  Right, it's brainwashing and --
R:  And k- -- and, see, we can't -- you're never going to achieve peace if you don't teach peace.
L:  Exactly, or a free thought.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, if you disagree with something then it, you know, it's okay to check into, you know, other resources or be --
R:  Well --
L:  -- someone else, or --
R:  Yeah, but in a lot of those countries, they kill 'em if they --
L:  I know.
R:  -- don't agree with, uh, the mainstream type thinking.  I think that y- we need to get over there and help some of these people who are in poverty get out of poverty so that they would get some self esteem, so maybe more of them would stand up to their governments.
L:  I know.  I mean, how m- -- how many people have you seen raised here to believe that blacks are, uh, you know, n- not as superior as whites and, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they believe that, because they've been taught that, and -- and they're going to teach their children that.
R:  Right.
L:  It's just -- it's a pattern that, you know ...
R:  Right, and until you break that pattern of teaching them intolerance of anybody that's a little bit different --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then you can't achieve peace.
L:  I know --
R:  And --
L:  -- and i- isn't the head of, uh, the beginning of Muslim -- the Muslim religion and the Jewish religion, they were brothers of the same family?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, if they could just go back to find the commonality of it all.
R:  Right, and the people want to live in peace and people wanna ... you know?
L:  I think they just need to get to -- it's, like, you know how you -- you may not like someone, but then when you sp- -- are forced to spend a lot of time with them, you find you like 'em?
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  [LAUGH]  It -- you know, if they could all just live wherever they wanted to --
R:  Right, and --
L:  -- the -- they're fighting over --
R:  -- there'd be a lot of --
L:  -- they're fighting over a piece of earth.
R:  Right.  Well, and a lot of them, they can't live where they want, they [NOISE] get food rations to 'em and you can't -- they [NOISE] -- shh, and they do that -- they do know that they keep 'em down --
L:  But they [inaudible] --
R:  -- so they can't get peace.
L:  Your -- the little child sounds adorable.
R:  Oh, shh.  That's my youngest, she's three and a half.
L:  Oh, I l- -- oh, that's so neat.
R:  But she, you know, it's like, for them, you know, it's like with my children, I have six.  I teach my children, you know, my children are all very tolerant of, you know, other races and that type of thing, because -- and handicaps and disabilities and --
L:  Good.  And because you're that way y- -- th- th- -- you've done what you've done, you probably have no idea the positive effects that will go on and on just because of that.
R:  Right.  Well, you know, that's what, you know, I know a lot of -- we lived out of state for a while and just even -- even living out of state, it's, like, over there the -- the people are -- where we lived, we lived in Pennsylvania, and people are very intolerant of anybody that's not like them, and I thought it must be like the Middle East over there, they're intolerant of anybody who is not the same religion, not the same race, not the same, um, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- economic --
L:  And see I'm -- have you ever --
