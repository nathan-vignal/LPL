R:  Hi, my name is Janice.
L:  Hi, I'm Susan.  How you doing?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  Okay.
R:  I guess we're supposed to talk about, uh, other countries. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I think there's a lot of countries that are a threat to the United States at the time.  [LIPSMACK] How 'bout you?
L:  A threat to us?  [SIGH] I don't know, ah, I guess it depends on -- I -- I don't think there --
R:  I guess we have to define threat.
L:  Yeah, that -- that would be good starting place.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  As far as terrorism is concerned, I don't think there's any protection from it really, and I, uh --
R:  Well, I have a tendency to agree with that, um, except that in certain instances --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think that, um, if you have enough information, it -- sometimes it helps to be proactive as opposed to reactive.  I guess you don't ... don't agree?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, no, I do, I do.  Um ...
R:  Well, how do you feel about this war in Iraq?
L:  I don't think we ever should've gone there, personally.  Um ...
R:  Okay.  Why not?
L:  [PAUSE] I don't believe we have the right to tell another country who should be running it, any more than they have the right to tell us who should be running us.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I ...
R:  Do you think that Saddam Hussein was a threat, uh, for terrorism to our country?
L:  No.  If he had the kind of weapons that we've been accusing him of he would've used 'em.
R:  You think so?
L:  Yep.  Uh, what reason did he have to hold back?  Everything was lost at that point, he might as well have gotten even.
R:  Oh, at this point you mean?  [NOISE] Once we went in you're talking about?
L:  Once we went in.  Once went in -- we went in he had no excuse not to use 'em if he had 'em.
R:  Mhm.  Well --
L:  And he didn't.
R:  Well, that -- that's definitely a problem the United States has [LAUGH] this tim- -- at this point.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is proving, w- you know, whether or not they -- they actually existed, and if they did, where were they?
L:  Exactly.  I -- I think that, oh, back when Carter got a -- got at the CIA --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was the biggest mistake we could've made.  Um, since then our -- I mean, our intelligence services weren't that great before that but since then they've just been dreadful.
R:  Oh, I think that that's definitely a given.  I think that, you know, they had a lot of information before nine eleven in this country that was not addressed.  Um, I think that there's a lot of information out there now that's not necessarily [LAUGH] addressed, um ...
L:  Yep.
R:  [NOISE] A- as far as the United States being at risk, I -- I think the only risk we really have is terrorism at this point, I don't think there's a country on the planet that could, um, match us military for military.
L:  There I'll agree, yeah, definitely.
R:  You know, unless of course you wanna just, you know, go bomb for bomb and we're all gone! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know.  Unfortunately that's -- that's where we are technology wise.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, you know, we -- we've definitely had a history of sticking our nose where it didn't belong.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But --
L:  And we haven't made a lot of friends in the process.
R:  Uh, well, you know, I'm -- I really have not traveled out of the United States too much to know that, but I do know from people that have that the -- obviously there's a lot of anti American sentiment.
L:  Yeah, I -- I've traveled quite a bit outside --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, yeah.  Uh --
R:  I -- I think that, you know, unfortunately though, I think as far as +terrorism -- terrorism is concerned, unfortunately I think we are a great risk, um, we would never, you know, settle the -- the, you know, Osama bin Laden situation --
L:  No.
R:  -- and Afghanistan, I don't know if we ever will.
L:  No, that's why we -- I think we -- part why we turned to Saddam Hussein, he was somebody we could get.
R:  Mhm.  Oh that -- that is definitely, you know --
L:  Good distraction.
R:  Yes.  And it's definitely we've at least done something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, people feel like at least that something has been done, whether it's good or bad! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, something has been done.
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, other than that, I mean, you know, this North Korea stuff, I mean, I -- I just don't see, you know, why these people would go ahead and attack us, but then again I didn't understand why nine eleven happened, so hey!
L:  [MN] [SIGH] Yeah, well, a lot of nine eleven has to do with the -- the American attitude towards the rest of the world.  We [inaudible] --
R:  I know, but the people in that -- those buildings had nothing to do with that.
L:  No.
R:  And if you have a problem with the -- with the, you know, government in this country that's one issue, but to deal w- you know, with civilians, to me, you know, is a totally different situation.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, although I don't know, um, y- know, I don't -- I waffle on the issue of Iraq but I do know that, you know, unfortunately or fortunately, you know, Saddam Hussein didn't come clean for twelve years.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  You know?  And that put him in a position where at any time during those twelve years he could've, "Okay" you know.  So if he -- what was his reason for not?  Just 'cause he said, "I don't care"?  I mean, he had to know --
L:  Because --
R:  -- that we were coming eventually.  You know, certainly at this point he had to know.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Because he was a sovereign nation and I don't know how much right we had to be telling him what he could do and what he couldn't do.  We wouldn't stand the -- for that from anybody else, hell, we won't even acknowledge the international court of justice because we won't have anybody telling us what to do and what not to do.
R:  Well, that would -- that would --
L:  Where do we get off?
R:  Well, that's -- that's definitely, you know, definitely a point, that we didn't listen to the, you know, court of justice, and we said we were doing it anyway, no matter what we were told.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Um, [MN].
L:  How does that make us any better than him? [SIGH]
R:  Well, you know, i- it does and it doesn't.  It doesn't because obviously, you know, we've been --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as aggressive at that point as he.  We think he c- was going to be, or -- or somewhere near[?].  But by the same token, at least we tried to, you know, use some [LIPSMACK] sense of [MN] [LIPSMACK] what's the word I'm looking for?  Some sense of, uh, [LIPSMACK] stability or -- or, you know, conscience when we did go in, that it wasn't just random, you know, shoot 'em up, you know, drop a bomb and that's the end of Baghdad kind of thing.
L:  Mm.  Yeah. [PAUSE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Are there any other countries that you feel, you know, would -- would be -- are a threat to this country?
L:  Again, on a military basis, no, I -- I think at this point we're too strong, um, for the military to be a threat, and as far as terrorism goes, as I said, there's no protecting against it.  Hell, I can walk into my kitchen and make mustard gas.  [SIGH]  That's --
R:  Oh absolutely.
L:  Yeah, so how do you protect against that?
R:  And -- and you certainly can get that information on the internet.
L:  And you don't even need it, just mix, um, bleach and ammonia. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Wham, you got mustard gas!  Uh, [LAUGH] and then of course with the information on the internet it starts getting even easier.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It -- it's just -- from that there's no protection.  I -- I don't care how many of our civil liberties they take away, I don't care how badly they destroy the constitution, they're not protecting us from terrorism.
R:  So you think that there is nothing to do, just to sit back and say, "That's the way it is"?
L:  No.
R:  Well what would you suggest then?
L:  [LIPSMACK] [PAUSE]
R:  You know, I mean, I -- I -- I'm not necessarily, you know, uh, a hundred percent [MN] for -- behind this war in Iraq --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I do believe that there's a time where, um, you have to say, "You know what, we've been reactive for so long as a country --" and militarily obviously we have the power but we've -- we've also not ing- -- you know, we've gotten involved obviously where we shouldn't have.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, more times than not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  In -- in different governmental situations.  But in situations where we've had intelligence where there's a possibility that we are going to be somewhat attacked whether it's, you know, terrorism or not.  You know, I do think that you have to at some point be proactive, especially after --
L:  I -- I think the first thing we have to do is rebuild the intelligence community so that they're getting straight information.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And getting complete information because --
R:  Well, I don't think you, as a civilian, will ever -- or me as a civilian for that matter -- will ever, you know, be privy to any of the stuff.
L:  Oh, I'm not asking to be privy to it, I just want the intelligence community be privy to it.
R:  Oh, I think a lot of people were.  You know, I think that's a -- that's a problem that we had here, is I think that a lotta people wanted too much information and, you know, we -- we weren't forthcoming with it, then when -- and I don't think we should've been.  You know, as long as they know what's going on --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, that's enough for me.
L:  But I really don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- don't think we have a good intelligence community in this country.  I- it's -- oh, first off just the fact that they don't know foreign languages is such a handicap --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to any sort of information collection.  Um, that's -- that's one place --
R:  Well, I -- I can't --
L:  -- I -- I've -- I was very involved with the Iranian community here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that is one place where the Russians have always beat us hollow.  They had people in Iran who spoke Farsi fluently and they passed as natives --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at the time of the fall of the Shah, for instance.
R:  Right.
L:  We had no one who even had a vague knowledge of Persian.
R:  Mhm.
L:  How do you collect information?
R:  Well, I can't imagine that. [LAUGH]
L:  And it's gotten no better.
R:  I mean, if Farsi is the national language there, then that's the [MN], you know, obviously in order to get any information you need to be able to communicate.
L:  Yeah.  I -- exact- -- that's --
R:  One would assume!
L:  So I would assume that that's the very first place to start.  Let's start educating them in languages.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then we can start getting better information to make our judgments on them.
R:  Mhm.  Did you live in Iran?
L:  No, no.  But I've -- I've got --
R:  Oh, it sounded like you had spent some -- some time there.
L:  No, I've -- I've got friends that, uh, were all Iranian.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, one of them for instance was in journalism and, uh, they knew --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- an awful lot that wasn't getting out to the public.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, we've talked a lot about it over the years.  Uh ... and that -- that's a major failing of the -- the intelligence community in this country.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They just ... don't speak the language.
R:  It's the language.
L:  Yeah.  So how can you collect information without the information?
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, and where do you go from there?
R:  Uh, yeah, I could see that being a problem! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I could definitely see that being an issue --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- um, not being able to, you know, speak the language or collect the information.  Um ...
L:  So, I think that's the first thing we've really got to do to protect ourselves from anything.
R:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK]  I just [MN] -- I just can't imagine, you know, a -- a milita- or, you know, you say you can't imagine but then something like September eleventh happens and you wonder -- obviously no country would attack us because you know where to go.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  But these cou- -- these groups that, you know, [MN] are angry with us for whatever reason --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- okay?  Uh, whether their reason has validity or not.
L:  [NOISE]
