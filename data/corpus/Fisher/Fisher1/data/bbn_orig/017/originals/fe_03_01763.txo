R:  Hi.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Maggie.
L:  Hi, I'm Dawn.
R:  Dawn.  Ah, I say no to the question.  I think -- oh, no.
L:  You say no to the -- to the question? 
R:  No, I was just joking.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH].  I mean, I said, ah, --  that you heard the topic, yes? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you consider any countries a threat.  I was just going to say I consider the United States a threat to the United States. [LAUGH]
L:  That's a good point.  Yeah, that could -- that could be a long, um, -- we might need more than ten minutes to go over the list of everybody that's a threat to the United States, including themselves.  I agree with you.  And you see anybody else besides ... 
R:  Um, at this point in time, um, actually I -- I --  I'm just deeply disturbed by US foreign policy at the moment so, no, I wouldn't say -- I think -- um, I'm starting to believe more and more that, ah, the threats are fabrications for --  
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- um to some degree.
L:  You'd be anti -- 
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- against the, ah, -- the recent, ah, events in Iraq and everything? 
R:  Mhm.  How -- how about you? 
L:  Um, I -- I kind of follow the -- I don't really probably know enough about what's going on.  I kind of go both ways but -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I feel like there's probably more that can go your way that we don't even know about and then there's -- some of it I support.  Um, I have a step brother that's, ah, serving in the military there so, um, I don't know, I don't have a very strong opinion either way so ...
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I -- I did vote for President Bush [LAUGH].  You have to promise not to hang up on me.
R:  Excuse me?
L:  You have to promise not to hang up on me.
R:  No, no, I can't give up the ten dollars, no.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  No, my fa- -- my father voted for President Bush.  Some of my best friends -- no, just my father. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Some of your ex best friends? 
R:  It's just that -- no, actually, no.
L:  Well, I have a lot of friends that don't even vote so --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think it's a step in the right direction to have, um, to have voted at all so ... 
R:  Yeah. Yeah, absolutely, I think you're right.  I -- I think -- I guess what's sad to me is, um, that most of the people in the military are a lot -- a good number of the people in the military, at least from what I've been reading, um, are working class or often go into the military because, um, they're looking for an education.
L:  Oh, yes, Mhm.
R:  And they normally go -- 
L:  I don't know very many people in the military but anybody I can think of, they, um, -- that's why they -- they either went in to pay off their, um, student loans -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- or were dropping out of school because they didn't know anyone that they wanted to do and just kind of ended up there.  I don't really know anyone who wanted to make it a career.
R:  Right.  And then -- 
L:  From the gecko. 
R:  Basically I just learn now only one senator -- of the entire US Congress only one senator has someone in the military.
L:  Oh, I remember hearing that, yes -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that they would be voting differently if it was their children who were, um, serving.
R:  Yeah.  Then, ah, what else was it -- oh, yeah, they have a new budget that they are trying to pass through Congress.  It's the, ah, --  President Bush's budget cuts, actually cuts a lot of support -- monetary support for veterans.  And I just think that's immoral to send people off to die and not take care of them afterwards. [LAUGH]  
L:  [NOISE] Excuse me.  I agree.  I -- I grew up in a town where there was -- it was the main presence in the town was the navy base, you know.  Those -- I mean they moved them every four years and the kids I were going to -- was going to school with, they were all unsettled, just the -- that's not their parents but that affected their whole family. 
R:  Oh.
L:  They were constantly having to, um, pick up and move and everything.  I get a lot of stuff in the mail from the, ah, from the disabled veterans and the, um, paralysed veterans and everything so, yeah, I -- I agree, they should do as much as they can to, um, continue to support them.
R:  Do you think that most of them are supporting the war because they actually thought we should go to war or because they felt an allegiance to as soldiers? 
L:  Um, probably -- I'd go -- I'd say a lot of people because of the soldiers.  Of course, if you know, if you have anyone in the military or if you know anyone who knows someone, you know, if you have any kind of, um, vague association with it, of course you feel you don't want to offend them and then -- some people really do, um, have a very strong, um, belief that we should have done it, so I'm probably more on the, um, wanting to support the military side.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Than --
R:  What -- what are your main reasons? 
L:  Um, I don't really know enough about it to -- I don't have a big reason to think that we should have done it but I -- I do like to support the, ah, the military when the -- the decision has been made and it seemed pretty inevitable that it was going to happen, so, um, I'm not one that was going to go down and be involved in a protest or anything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So.  There really wasn't much -- I live -- are we allowed to say where we live?  I don't know.  I live near Atlanta and there wasn't -- I live in a small town near there and I didn't --  there was nothing here, like you wouldn't have known the war was going on.
R:  Wow.
L:  It was amazing. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  And we drove up, just like forty five minutes north, um, and there were yellow ribbons everywhere, it's -- I -- I think it's very local, depending on what --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- population is there.
R:  Yeah, it was pretty -- I live, um, in Philadelphia and, ah, before the war I -- I had never seen such protest actually, huge protest.
L:  Really.
R:  Yeah, I was in New York for the -- I think it was the March fifteen -- it was the day where like a million people marched in Rome against the war, a million people in London.  Where the whole world -- 
L:  Yeah, I remember New York seeing that, Ahah.
R:  And then, um, and I was in New York and it was -- it was enormous.  I thought that day there's no way we will go to war, at least I mean not unilaterally after today but it was remar- --
L:  Yeah, there was a great, um, -- I listen to MPR and they do -- they do a pretty good job of covering the protests and the --  of course the -- the people in for -- for and against and they -- every day it said there was -- you know, they were talking about the different protests around the world, everywhere -- 
R:  Yeah, that's pretty remarkable.
L:  -- people everywhere were protesting so ... but I don't know. It's -- it's very complicated because you start, um, you listen to CNN and then you listen to, um, all the different news channels and there's something different on [NOISE] every station.
R:  Mhm. It's true, there is so much stuff to sort through it's hard to tell what's wrong and what's real.
L:  I get very confused. [LAUGH] I have two little children so I don't get a lot of time to read the paper or to, um, sift through the -- the -- the information, it's very confusing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I am not the most informed, um, but I do make an effort to get the head -- you know, get the -- the headlines so I know that there's more that I'm missing, so ... 
R:  Yeah, well, the MPR I think is pretty good. 
L:  I enjoy -- I try to, um, shut my kids up [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so I can listen to -- because they -- they go more in depth, you know, than just, ah, logged on to regular radio stations.
R:  Yeah, that's what I like about it, it's really hard to, um,  find anything that's -- that goes a little bit below the surface of things.
L:  Mhm.  Did -- did you actually go to -- you went to the protest? 
R:  Oh, I went to lots of protests. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, great, that's good, that's good.  I don't -- I don't know anybody that is -- that, um, really has an opinion so all the people that I know, they don't even care one way or the other -- 
R:  Well ...
L:  -- you know, so that's nice that you -- you have [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah, I -- I did -- I was doing a lot of reading and, um, background reading and the more I read about it, the more I thought like, um, our emotions after September eleventh were being manipulated. 
L:  Oh, sure, yes.
R:  Because a lot of the people who are serving in, um, in the current Presidential Cabinet served under Bush senior.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, I had -- like a few days before, actually the day that, ah, President Bush was, ah, -- gave Saddam his forty eight hours, ah, the ultimatum, that evening on PBS they ran a -- a documentary of -- going through the history of, ah, the gulf region -- the -- the history of, ah, US involvement in Iraq.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, they talked about how after the failures of the first war Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld and Cheney wrote, I forget the document, um, I forget the exact name of it, um, but it was something like The Doctrine For The New American Century or something like that.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And -- and it talked about -- and this was like nineteen ninety six or something or ninety four and it talked about how in the new millennium we were going to need the, ah, the US -- the US was going to need to use preemptive strikes for anyone that they might consider to be their threats, um, in order to maintain US interests and they nee- --
