R:  Hello, this is Lee.
L:  Hi, this is Cindy.
R:  How are ya, Cindy?
L:  Good, how are you doing?
R:  Pretty good.  Nice to talk to you.
L:  You too.
R:  S- so the topic of the day is ...
L:  Uh --
R:  S- --
L:  -- who we think's a threat.
R:  Who is a threat to us?
L:  From foreign relations [several inaudible words].
R:  Uh, sounds absolutely fascinating.
L:  I don't know if anyone's a big threat. [LAUGH] I mean, I guess anyone could be threat.
R:  Sure anybody could be a threat, but I -- I think the United States military --
L:  Too strong.
R:  -- is -- it's pretty strong.
L:  Yeah, I agree.
R:  That I don't think we have too much to worry about as far as other countries trying to --
L:  Sneak in like they did.
R:  Exactly.
L:  That -- that's what I mean, anyone could be a little threat, but --
R:  Right.  That's -- that's correct.  Anybody can be a little threat, but the United States is in -- in pretty good shape, based on what's just transpired in Iraq and --
L:  What we've seen, yeah.
R:  Yes, it didn't take very long to go in and accomplish whatever we were trying to accomplish.  So, it looked like it was a pretty good job, and I don't really think we have much of a threat or much to worry about.
L:  I think it was quick too, a lot quicker than I thought it was going to happen.
R:  Did you really think it was going a while?
L:  I thought it was gonna -- I don't know why, not that we wouldn't win, but just that somehow it was going to drag on.
R:  How long did you think that it was going to last for?
L:  I thought a few months.
R:  A few months?
L:  I thought more and more people would get called over.  I don't know, like, reserves and things like that.
R:  I mean, i- -- did you think --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- did --
L:  I don't know why I thought that. [LAUGH]
R:  Did you think that quite a few body bags would be coming back?
L:  I'm not -- yeah, in a way, but see, w- well, I know -- I know a lot of people where I work are in, you know, the National Guard and they were always being called to airports and stuff, and I thought that was what was going to be next, that they'd be all sent over there, even though they were just in the Guards.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't why I thought that, I just did. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But it's actually turned out -- and it's unfortunate for those several hundred families --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- who were -- were touched by tragedy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But all things considering, um, in the time frame, it was pretty -- pretty fast and not many lives were -- were lost.
L:  And I do -- I think they thought they were a big threat, that's for sure.
R:  Oh, I -- I think so.
L:  And they were wrong.
R:  And I think, uh, well, George Bush was going in to take care of some situations --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- that his f- -- his father n- never was quite able to finish.  So, Junior -- Junior went in there and sent his -- surrounded himself with the Armed Forces and was hopefully able to diminish what -- any problems he thought would occur over there.  But then the United States is looking at other countries now as well that could be a threat, such as North Korea and Syria and I'm sure --
L:  Countries like --
R:  -- look at Libya.
L:  Yeah.  But I don't know, as far as, like, France or any of them.  I don't think any of them would ever even think about [LAUGH] --
R:  No, no.
L:  -- attacking or anything.
R:  No, France is -- France is too -- too much involved with selling their --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- their -- their champagne and wine --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  -- over- overseas, and with tourism season --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- coming up, there -- they don't want to lose the American tourists that go over there and spend money --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- or --
L:  That's what some countries are worried about.
R:  Oh, of course.
L:  That's why they wouldn't attack. [SIGH]
R:  Uh, uh, of course.  You -- you ever been over to France?
L:  No, I haven't.
R:  You ever been out of the US?
L:  [LIPSMACK] To, like, islands.
R:  To islands?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, where have you been?  What islands have you been to?
L:  Um, Aruba.
R:  That's a nice place.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Really nice.
L:  And ... well, Mexico, like Kasomo[?] and Cancun.
R:  I've been to Cancun, Portaviata[?], Monsonaia[?], Mexico --
L:  Would you go now, or would you think you'd be afraid?
R:  No, I -- I wouldn't be afraid.  I wouldn't be afraid.  I -- I would travel any place --
L:  Really?
R:  -- within the world.  I w- -- I wouldn't book a trip to Baghdad this week.
L:  Yes, [LAUGH] exactly.
R:  But the -- the majority of the countries in this world?  No, I would not be concerned.
L:  [MN].
R:  [inaudible] anything can happen in this country, and it's already happened in nine eleven, [LIPSMACK] so it could certainly happen --
L:  Anywhere, that's true.
R:  -- again, any day, any p- -- any time, and every day that we're out in the world, there's always that possibility that something can happen, so I don't -- I don't live in fear.
L:  That's true, you shouldn't, I guess.
R:  No.  And what city are you in?
L:  Um, New Hampshire.
R:  New Hampshire?
L:  Yes.
R:  Beautiful New Hampshire.
L:  It's not a city. [LAUGH]
R:  No, yeah, I know, I was going to say that to you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's not a city, that's a state.
L:  Well, yeah, we -- I don't live in a city. [LAUGH]
R:  They don't have any cities in New Hampshire?
L:  I work in the city, but I don't live in the city.
R:  Uh, we we- -- we went to a farm in New Hampshire --
L:  Really?
R:  -- a number of years ago. [LIPSMACK] What was the town [NOISE] we were in in New Hampshire?  I'm trying to think what town we were there.  It was really kind of nice, a little chilly --
L: Yes, it is.
R:  -- in the summer.
L:  It's still chilly.
R:  Uh, we were in Troy, New Hampshire.
L:  Troy.
R:  You know where Troy i- --
L:  That's near Keene, I know where --
R:  That's exactly where that's near.
L:  It's near Vermont, yeah?
R:  Yes.  That's where we were.
L:  I do know that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  My niece went to college in Keene, that's how I know that.
R:  That -- that's right.  I remember seeing -- going through Keene and then heading up towards -- toward Troy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's a nice part of the country --
L:  W- where are you?
R:  -- up [NOISE] there.  But chilly in the -- it's chilly in the summer time, in the w- -- in the morning.
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  And --
L:  Where are you?
R:  In Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, you're not that far. [LAUGH]
R:  N- no, no, no.  And we were -- we were in Vermont a couple of summers ago, and where else did we go in that there part of the country? [MN]
L:  Yeah, Vermont's nice.
R:  Vermont's very nice.  And Cape Cod, we were in Cape --
L:  Oh, I love the Cape. [LAUGH]
R:  Cape was -- was also a nice spot.
L:  I try to go there at least once a year. [LAUGH]
R:  Cape's great.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Cape's -- but the water's too cold.
L:  Yeah, it is -- this is the worst winter ever.  I've lived in this town for about twelve years in this house and I -- this is the worst.
R:  It's the worst ever?
L:  The snow has just gone this week.
R:  [LAUGH] It's taken this long for it to disappear?
L:  Really, I just looked outside, and, like, yeah, I think it's officially gone. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] The official start of spring time.
L:  [LAUGH] They say the ice won't be off the lakes 'til May though.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It h- -- it was a very long winter in -- in most of the country.  It just --
L:  So ...
R:  -- didn't seem to be the winter that wanted to end.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it's finally -- finally has ended, it looks like.
L:  I hope so.
R:  It's been -- it's been -- it's been pretty nice.
L:  My plow guy made a pretty penny off me. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I know.  I know, those plow guys did do quite well -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- this year, extremely well.  What do they charge, by number of inches up there?
L:  Ah, no, he does it by plow, I have a pretty decent guy.
R:  Do --
L:  By the -- the storm.
R:  Oh, he does it by the storm?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- so if there's twenty inches is -- it's --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- one price and --
L:  -- he's -- I got a good guy.  He just charges me -- I mean, I know some that would be, like, twelve inches is one price [MN].
R:  Yeah.
L:  No, he's -- I've had him for a few years, and he's always been decent.
R:  Well, send him down to Philly because down here, they -- they charge based on the number of inches.
L:  Really?  It's twenty five bucks, and I have a big driveway.
R:  Oh, twenty five dollars?  These guys won't get out of bed for twenty five dollars.
L:  [LAUGH] Ex- -- and my sister lives in Manchester, the city, and her driveway's, like, a quarter of mine, and she pays, like, thirty five. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, it would -- I think it starts at about twenty five dollars up -- up to two or three inches --
L:  You're kidding me!
R:  -- and then it just goes -- it escalates.  It could be tw- -- another twenty five dollars if it's seven inches, another twenty five dollars if it's --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- ten inches.  So, you -- I mean, it's not uncommon for people to have to pay a hundred dollars every time it snows.
L:  Wow, I --
R:  Especially this year.
L:  I was complaining, I paid two seventy five the whole season. [LAUGH]
R:  Sh! Two s- --
L:  [LAUGH]
R: -- two seventy five?  There are people that paid two seventy five for two storms.
L:  Wow.  I g- get it good then.
R:  Your -- your guy, I wouldn't -- I wouldn't tell anybody about your guy.
L:  He hasn't even paid him for the last seventy five bucks yet! [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] -- and even with the cost of fuel.
L:  That's true, the gas alone.
R:  The gas is very expensive.
L:  Yep, although that wa- -- yeah, I read -- the gas went up because of all the problems.
R:  Well, I guess the --
L:  Oil --
R:  Mhm.
L:  The most oil I've paid for in my life.
R:  So -- but you -- you have oil heating?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And what does that cost per gallon?  A dollar or something?
L:  Um, I have locked in at, like, a dollar fifteen --
R:  Mm, that --
L:  -- and I bought five hundred gallons, because that's all I ever use.  I -- I live, you know, my boyfriend comes on the weekends, I'm mostly alone --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I ran out by December this year, so I had to pay, like, a dollar eighty nine or something, the last two times.
R:  And how long did that last you?
L:  Um --
R:  Does it --
L:  -- I still have a full tank 'cause it's warmed up quite a bit.
R:  So, you went through, for the winter --
L:  Oh, about[?] --
R:  How much money you think you spent?
L:  I did my initial five hundred and fifty bucks, plus it was, like, two fifty -- about a thousand dollars, and I've not ever done that.
R:  Or -- and that would be how many months, you figure?  Six months?
L:  They fill up probably in October, yeah, until now.
R:  So it's six months and that's twelve hundred dollars?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's a -- that's a decent amount of money.
L:  I've never spent more than six or seven hundred dollars.
R:  So, we had a gas bill in F- -- January or February that was almost five hundred dollars for one month.
L:  One month?
R:  One month, it was four seventy five for one month.
L:  W- wow.
R:  Which was the highest it's ever been.  But it was brutally cold --
L:  Yeah, a- --
R:  -- in J- January and February.
L:  That is a lot for gas.
R:  We don't have -- we don't have oil, just natural -- natural gas.
L:  I think my sister has natural gas.
R:  And it's -- it gets to be -- either way -- either way, it's expensive.  But, you have to --
L:  My parents have electric heat. [LAUGH]
R:  Electric heat?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's really expensive.
L:  They never changed over. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's -- that's -- that's high.
L:  I can't imagine what -- I'm sure it's quite a bit a month. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  That's quite high to have [NOISE] to pay -- to pay electric heat.  But n- do you have air conditioning, or you don't have air conditioning?
L:  No, I don't, 'cause --
R:  I guess you don't really need it up there.
L:  Yeah, you can get them and put them in, but --
R:  Mhm.  But down here --
L:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you really need them, because the humidity is pretty bad.
L:  Does it get humid?  Yeah.
R:  In -- in -- especially in July and August, it's pretty humid.
L:  I can't wait. [LAUGH]
R:  It'll be coming up.  So, what do you do in real life up there?
L:  I work for the New Hampshire Liquor Commission.
R:  So, you drink your way through your job?
L:  Yeah, we get to regulate everything that comes and goes out of the state. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, i- can you buy alcohol in any place in New Hampshire, or only in select store --
L:  Only our liquor stores, and grocery stores you can buy wine and beer.
R:  So, that's somewhat similar to Pennsylvania, but a little different.
L:  Right.  Oh, that's right, you guys have the -- we have a --
R:  We have the --
L:  -- a big meeting there every year in Pennsylvania.
R:  Because we have the state store system here.
L:  Yeah, that's where we go.
R:  But you cannot buy wine in any -- i- -- you c- -- you have to -- you can only buy wine in a state store.
L:  Oh.
R:  You cannot buy it in a grocery store.
L:  Yeah, that's the only thing -- we can -- they also can buy wine in a grocery store.
R:  You can buy --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- beer, beer you can buy in a distributor [NOISE] and, oh shoot, somebody's calling me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Okay.  Um, [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] beer you can buy in a gr- -- in a del- deli --
L:  Yeah, we don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do you sell beer in your liquor stores?
R:  No.
L:  Yeah, we can't either.
R:  You can b- -- only buy it in a beer -- in a beer distributorship --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or in a deli.  Those are the only places it can be bought.
L:  That's why we have a -- they -- our commissioners go to a big meeting in Pennsylvania every year.
R:  You been working for this or- organization for a while?
L:  Um, yeah, actually, ten years.
R:  That's a good -- good amount of time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Considering
