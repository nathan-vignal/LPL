R:  Hi, I'm Holly.
L:  Hi, this is Duane.
R:  Hi, Duane.  So, um, I think the topic was something about, um --
L:  What other countries --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- are a threat to the United States.
R:  So, what do you think?
L:  Um, yeah, I -- I suppose there are threats out there, but I don't think they are from other countries necessarily, I think they're from groups within countries.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Uh, I don't know if that gets us off the topic.
R:  Oh, you mean, like -- like Osama bin Laden's type of group --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like the terrorist groups?
L:  Right.  Or even groups within the country.
R:  Right.  Well, see, like, Syria scares me a little. [LAUGH]
L:  Does it?
R:  Yeah, but only because they harbor people like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- Osama bin Laden and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, they support groups like that.
L:  Yeah, they're not really overtly out to get us, but if --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if we do have issues come up, uh, it's very likely it'll come from there.
R:  Exactly.
L:  So ...
R:  And also, like, Korea scares me a little bit --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- too, as well. [LAUGH]
L:  North Korea?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, [LAUGH] because, you know, [COUGH] they just -- they -- they're, you know, I don't know, I guess it's just the weapons and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and I just -- I just wish there was world peace, and then we --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- wouldn't have any of these issues.
L:  Right, right.  [SIGH] No, I agree.  Um, if there is any country that's overtly out there, uh, kind of in our face, it's North Korea.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And it doesn't make sense to me, because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the -- I mean, except for the recent events with the war in Iraq --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the rest of the world supports the United States, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or at least has the same viewpoint about North and South Korea and -- at least that's my perception.
R:  Right.  Yeah, I feel like everyone supports us, um, even though they weren't real happy about the way we went about it.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but they support us and they understand, um, I'm glad that -- I mean, I feel safer now that Saddam is at least -- his power's at least been --
L:  Right.
R:  -- thrown off -- thrown off, so I -- I do feel a whole lot safer 'cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I really felt uncomfortable about Saddam Hussein, I always have.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, he's kind of a wild card --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- there's just no --
R:  He was --
L:  -- predicting what he'll do, so that's -- that's frightening.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  'Cause he always reminded me of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, of, uh, like a h- Hitler or something like that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like he was just crazy, out of his mind.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, maybe not in the same ways, but for the most part [LAUGH] he's like this. [NOISE]
L:  No, I -- I think it's a good analogy.  He's -- he's crazy out of his mind, but he also has the power to be very destructive --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, out of his mind, you know, there -- there are a lot of crazy people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but most of 'em are harmless --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because they don't have the power [NOISE] but he was definitely [NOISE] a serious threat.
R:  Yeah, and I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think that the whole -- I mean, I feel a whole lot safer now, I don't think that Korea is just going to come after us and bomb us --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for no reason at all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, although I think they might mess with other people in their area, I don't think they would mess with us.
L:  Right.
R:  But I don't think they're just going to come over and go, "Oh, we hate you, and we're going to bomb you now".
L:  Right.
R:  -- although I feel -- although I felt Saddam Hussein would do that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Or at least get -- or at least support groups that would do it, like Osama bin Laden.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  Or Al Qaeda or whatever you call that group.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]  You know?  And I don't know, I just, um, [NOISE] I -- I hope that they take care of Osama bin Laden, because there are a lot of countries over in the Middle East that support them.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And that -- that -- you're right, that that -- that bothers me more than just the specific country --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know?  Because apparently he did nine eleven and, you know, I don't think that he'd go after New York City again --
L:  No.
R:  -- I think that he'd go after somewhere else in the United States, like California or something. [COUGH]
L:  Right.  It was kind of interesting to me, he ... the targets that he chose I think were more symbolic than effective.  Uh, you know, if -- if he had taken out, say, Hoover Dam, that would have not only flooded millions of homes, but it also would have wiped out power to millions of other homes, or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, just -- I -- I thought there were a lot of other targets that just as easily could have been hit --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and have a greater impact, so it's fortunate -- I mean, it -- it's sad, all the lives that we lost and, uh, all of the issues that it caused --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but in a way it's -- it's much better than it could have been.
R:  Right, I mean --
L:  So, hopefully -- oh, go ahead.
R:  Oh, sorry.  I -- I was just going to say that, you know, I think [SIGH] that he mainly hit the World Trade Centers because it -- a lot of people take a lot of pride in New York City.
L:  Right.
R:  Even though it is a dirty city [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for the most part, there are a lot of things there to be proud of, like the statue and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, the World Trade Center, it kind of stands for America --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so does Washington DC.  So, I think it was more of a hit on our pride.
L:  Right. [NOISE] Yeah, I think for most foreigners, when they think of the United States, they think of either the capital, or they think of New York, uh, and for a lot of Americans, that's where their families first came through, was in New York.
R:  Right.
L:  So -- no, I agree with -- it's a very ... very emotional target.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  And -- and I think maybe that's what he wanted.
R:  Yeah --
L:  But --
R:  -- I -- I think so.  Go ahead --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm sorry. [LAUGH] Uh, yeah, I think he just, um, you know, he's -- he's definitely a crazy person and just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and of course I have an issue with anyone that, um, that insists that they're always right, and I feel like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's how he feels.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so I -- I just -- I just hope that they're able to, um, stop all his funds, because I do truly believe that Saddam Hussein was funding him.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, no, that makes sense, and it's, uh, one of my friends was commenting that it's strange we haven't had any terrorist attacks since then, uh, but I think that's the reason why, is that the funding has been ceased and, you know, the -- the terrorist cells still exist, but they don't have the direction, uh, from their superiors, and they also don't have the funding available to go ahead and implement their plans.
R:  Right.
L:  So, it's --
R:  But c- --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  E- even though O- Osama bin Laden had a huge inheritance, I still think that most of his funds, because he had to have millions --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, come from -- came from -- definitely came from Saddam and Afghanistan, the Taliban.
L:  Right.
R:  No doubt in my mind, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And Saddam Hussein has a lot of money, a lot of money. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Probably too much for his own good.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, yeah, he definitely was giving money to them, and I'm glad that President Bush did something about it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because I think -- I think he knew that as well, he just had no proof.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it'll be interesting as --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the war plays --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- out a little further.  I guess the war itself is mostly over, but as Iraq is, uh, brought back to stability, I -- I think a lot of, uh, treasure troves will be turned up, uh, hidden accounts and secret deals with foreign governments, exporting oil under the table, or various things that will show how involved they actually were with supporting terrorism.  And -- and I don't know that the biological weapons will ever turn up, I think they've already been shipped to Syria or somewhere else that we won't find them, but I think there will still be a lot of records [NOISE] uh, indicating that there was a significant threat, uh ...
R:  Well --
L:  Bt of course people -- people who think that they weren't there to begin with will just say, "Well, these are documents the US government has made up".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Or, "This is something that the United States keeps in store just so that they can pin, uh, things on other people" and it's -- it's kind of an irrational topic with a lot of people, you can't discuss it openly, because they're not willing to admit that it's not a conspiracy from the United States.
R:  Right.  Yeah, I definitely think that, um, a lot of people, um, [SIGH] that, you know, especially in the Middle East, they think that, uh, we're out to get them because they're Muslims or whatever --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or it's because of their religious beliefs, when really that's what America is based on --
L:  Right.
R:  -- having freedom of religious beliefs and w- we could really [LAUGH] we don't really care if you're Muslim or if --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you're a Catholic or a Christian or -- or whatever, um, it doesn't really make a difference to us, it's more of, um, you know, if you respect the laws, and y- you know, you do the right thing, it's --
L:  Right.
R:  And I feel that --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I feel that our government pretty much, um, stands by that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  I mean, I'm not saying everyone on there is a perfect person, I'm sure they're not [LAUGH] you know?  And --
L:  No, I agree.
R:  -- President Clinton certainly proved that.
L:  But I think everybody is at least trying.
R:  Yeah.  And so I think [NOISE] -- I think, um, I don't know, I think -- I think that, you know, the whole Iraq thing, and I -- I'm pretty sure you're right, [NOISE] that they probably have shipped out all their chemical weapons --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and biological weapons or whatever they had.  They probably got rid of them, but they're smarter than that.  [NOISE] I keep saying that to people, I go, "You know, these people aren't stupid".
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, come on, look what they did with nine eleven, they're not dumb.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They are intelligent human beings --
L:  Right.
R:  -- even though the- -- you know, a lot of people say, "Oh, they're idiots" and stuff, and I don't think so.  I think they're really intelligent.
L:  Right.
R:  And [LAUGH] that you never underestimate them.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And, y- you know, even though they do suicide bombings, and in our -- in most Americans' opinions, that's just stupid.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but --
L:  But --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You go ahead.
R:  That shows their intelligence, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  And that, I mean, in their religious beliefs they die, you know, uh, doing a suicide bombing and that's -- that's the most prideful way to die.
L:  Right.
R:  So, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
