L:  Hi, my name --
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Jesse.
R:  Hi, I'm Matt.  Uh, where you calling from, Jesse?
L:  Uh, uh, what do I think, is that what you asking?
R:  Uh, no.  I was just asking where you were calling from.
L:  Oh, I'm calling, uh, from Texas.
R:  Okay, I'm in Philadelphia.
L:  On a cell- okay, cellphone [LAUGH].
R:  Yep.  Um, so are you threatened by any other countries in the world?  Do you feel threatened?  Do you think the US is threatened?
L:  Oh, man.  If it was, I haven't been up to date that well.  I would have said any other country would have been North Korea.
R:  North Korea.  You think North Korea --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is a direct threat?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because -- because of the nuclear program that they said they're developing?
L:  Yes.  The nuclear.
R:  You think they would use that to possibly threaten or strike United States or its allies?
L:  Uh, yes.  Because, uh, supposedly before the Iraqi war, I believe that there had been said that the -- that they were, what, producing or they want- -- or they held, uh, nuclear weapons so, uh, I would figure that that would be a threat there.  I mean, if they -- with anyone, you know, not just to America.
R:  Right.  Right.  Well, there are a lot of countries that have developed nuclear programs --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- without -- but do you -- do you feel like North Korea has a, uh, a -- a -- a particular motive for threatening the United States?
L:  Oh, man.  I mean, the only thing I can think of, I mean, they are a communist -- communist, uh, country so, uh, I'm not sure if it's for -- well, I wouldn't know if it would be for world domination or anything.  I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, but I do think, you know, having -- having nuclear, uh, weapons and all that, I'm sure they -- they feel that they could dominate some countries --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because of that.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, why else would you develop nuclear weapons if not to defend or attack other countries.  Yes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, but, uh, do you think -- I'm kind of curious, do you think North -- some people would choose North Korea of -- first of all, there's not a who- -- I mean, there is evidence that they've been developing the program --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but some people accused them of, uh, publicly announcing these -- these -- these plans for weapons development as a sort of cry for help --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in -- in the sense -- in the sense that they're sort of disintegrating on the inside.  It's really falling apart.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, it's sort of li- -- uh, lashing out and for, you know, as a means of attention, um.  There has been embargoes on the country for -- for decades, um.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Also, so, I mean, do you think that -- that's a possibility that maybe they're not actually planning to use the weapons but more using them as a leveraging tool in order --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to get --
L:  Yeah, in order to get help, uh, from other countries, uh.  Yeah, that could be -- that could be a possibility there also.  Um, that sounds like a good one, too.  I mean, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- especially if, uh, you know, there be, uh -- especially if their economy, you know, has been bad and, um, they need help or especially with embargoes like you said.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That could be a good possibility there just to get some, you know, help or not even that, but attention.
R:  Yeah, I mean, their citizens are starving because they live under a tyrannical, maniacal dictator kind of -- I mean, it is hard to compare without --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know, really having numbers but almost -- you know, certainly as bad, if not worse than, the dictator we just removed in Iraq.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, are you aware that we have, um, I'm not sure on the exact numbers, but I know a few thousand active military troops still in South Korea bordering on, uh, a demilitarized zone between North and South Korea?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Don't you think that that's --
L:  Am I aware of it?  Yes.
R:  Do you think -- what do you think about the United States presence in the region?  Don't you feel -- don't you think that some countries might feel threatened by the fact that the United States still has active military troops there and --
L:  Oh, of course.  I mean --
R:  -- and is it legitimate to try and, you know, --
L:  I mean, uh --
R:  -- defend yourself in some way.
L:  Yeah, I'm sure that there's a lot of, uh, countries out there, you know, third world countries, smaller countries that are -- like, for example, uh, you know, Saddam Hussein.  I'm sure --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he was telling his people -- telling his people that, you know, "Hey, these guys, you know, they're a world power and they have active nuclear and also why should w- why shouldn't we, to protect ourselves?"
R:  So, tell me if North Korea has exhibited evidence that they do have nuclear weapons and they have some motive, whatever that may be, to attacking the United States, do you think we should do some sort of military intervention, maybe, you know --
L:  Well --
R:  -- considering after, you know, the --
L:  Iraq?
R:  Yeah, after Iraq, after we -- after it seems that we've -- we've -- we've made some success there?
L:  Well, what -- what I would think first to do is -- yeah, I guess, I'm pretty sure that, uh, uh, well, you know, Secretary of State and, uh, our Vice President and all the other people said some stuff or has sent some stuff over to North Korea, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they've exch- exchanged words about that, you know, to either abandon their operations --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or I'm sure they've gotten some warnings or what not, but if worse comes -- comes to worst if they keep on manufacturing these, uh, nuclear weapons, I would -- I would assume, yeah, that -- I mean, nucl- -- that, uh, [COUGH] that there should be some military action involved, uh --
R:  Do you -- do you feel like if the US doesn't do it, no-one will?  Is that sort of their deal, like, we have to now --
L:  No.  Well, I mean --
R:  -- like we are so powerful?
L:  They -- we, uh -- well, I mean, I'm sure we would get help from other countries.  I mean, we -- we already -- we gained some -- some of the -- we kind of w- -- I'm not saying we won it yet but I'm saying --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we did a good job here in the Iraqi war --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- doing that with the help of, you know, some other countries also involved.  Uh, I would think that we'd probably try to get some, uh, like the UN or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or NATO, those countries together.
R:  Do you think that the UN still has -- after -- after showing basically that the US ignored the UN, uh, going in Iraq because they didn't support the actions, do you feel like the UN maybe is weakened and is unable to control rogue countries like North Korea now, or do you --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- feel like the UN still has a role in helping build these countries in the future?
L:  Well, I --
R:  Do we forget about the UN or keep working with them?
L:  Well, I think what the UN is doing is they're really trying to, you know, stay neutral with all this and it really don't want -- I guess they don't want any problems right now as in world affairs.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, as far as weaker, they -- I mean, they are showing signs of weakness, you know, because I'm -- you know, if they -- if they weren't weak, they would have made some [inaudible] uh, but as far as what they're doing, yeah, showing some signs of weakness could mean that they don't wanna --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, put their men and lives out there.
L:   Do you think, uh, that the countries who are currently on the Security Council, countries like France and Germany, who, while are important western nations, not so strong militarily anymore, do you think that they should continue to serve on the Security Council?
L:  Should they kee- --
R:  Considering -- considering that they're not as strong militarily as the US?
L:  Right.  Serve like as -- do you mean in NATO, or what do you mean?
R:  I mean, in the -- in the United Nations Security Council.
L:  Oh yeah, yeah.
R:  Um, the Council that -- that, yeah.
L:  Oh --
R:  It decides on military action and, you know --
L:  Well, man, I mean -- I mean America needs all the hel- -- I would think that America needs all the help from all the nations out there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, if -- even though they don't want to fight, uh, should have some type of back up.  Not that they'll jump in but at least something, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, for them to see what -- what's happening and for them to see what we're doing, what we're accomplishing so that way they know, hey, you know, what they were doing is right so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- maybe they'll jump in and help out a little, I don't know.  Whether it's not fighting but it's, you know, helping out with the food --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- shortages out there, where other -- other -- other means of civil --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- rights and all that.
R:  So, do you, or anyone you know, feel sort of directly threatened by North Korea, or is it just sort of a looming fear?
L:  Hm.  Just a -- I would probably think a looming fear.
R:  Yeah, it's not really something that --
L:  No, not a --
R:  Yeah -- Yeah, I think most people are probably just concerned that --
L:  Yeah, concerned.
R:  -- that it could get worse, right?
L:  Right, right.  It is if the problem isn't attended, you know.
R:  Because they haven't had a history of something like terrorism --
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  -- or, yeah.
L:  It is just said to be that they're working, that they have operations contained, you know, nuclear weapons.
R:  Mhm.  Hm.
L:  And that's only the country that I can think of right now.
R:  Yeah, I mean, that's the one that's in the news most often.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  What about Iran?  Do you think Iran is a threat?
L:  Uh, well I haven't heard any --
R:  It's grouped with North Korea and Iraq by President Bush.
L:  Yeah, yeah [NOISE] but, uh -- yeah, I don't know about Iran because Iran -- I mean, they haven't -- they've got a lot of inspectors and right now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- North Korea is the one who's not letting anyone come in, you know, come in --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and inspect, inspection.  So --
R:  Right.
L:  I would see more --
R:  That is definitely true.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  What if -- what if in the nex- -- in the coming months, uh, the US government said that it was feeling uneasy about Iran and it wanted to -- and there was no further evidence of weapons programs there and it wanted to do some sort of containment, military action in Iran, would you support that?
L:  If, uh, seriously what I would think is, uh, I would have to have more evidence for me to support anything.
R:  More evidence, yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I would, too.
L:  [NOISE]  Okay.  Hey, just a sec, man, I'm sorry.
R:  Yeah.
