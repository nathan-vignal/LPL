L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.
R:  Um, my name is Sarah.  What's --
L:  My name's Lisa.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I've never done this before, so...
R:  Me neither.
L:  Have you? [LAUGH]
R:  No, I haven't. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Kind of a different deal.
R:  So, it's surprising.
L:  Huh, I wonder --
R:  So, do we --
L:  Pardon?
R:  I was just going to say do we stay on topic or do we -- was that a suggested topic?
L:  You know, I'm not su- -- I don't know if it's just suggested or not.
R:  Hm.
L:  The foreign relation thing.
R:  Yeah, I'm not --
L:  Or may- or they just give it to you to get you going on something.
R:  Yeah, I wasn't sure about that.
L:  Well, I guess we could just do our thing and [LAUGH].
R:  We could [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I can't imagine we'll get in trouble for it.
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know.
R:  Unless you'd like to talk about that.  I can talk, you know --
L:  Well, it's on the news all the time.
R:  It is.
L:  I'm glad it's calming down a little bit.
R:  I am, too.  I definitely am.  It's been a scary time.
L:  Yes, it is and it sounds like it's winding up so maybe -- maybe the -- the worse is over, I hope.
R:  Yeah, I'm not so sure.  I mean, redevelopment --
L:  Really, do you think?
R:  Well, I think as far as the war is concerned --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but redevelopment and --
L:  Oh yeah, that part.
R:   -- everything going on ar- -- I mean, the worse, I think, is over for us.
L:  For us.  Yeah, it's just starting --
R:  But for them.
L:  -- for them.
R:  Yeah, apparently they're talking about sort of religious conflicts and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all of that.  It's just, uh, really troubling --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- sort of thing.  So, where are you calling from?
L:  I'm in Oklahoma.  Where are you?
R:  Oh, really?  I'm in Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, oh, how neat.  I've always wanted to go to Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yes, that's one part of the country I've never made it to.  I've been about every other direction but east ways.
R:  Oh.  I'm a -- I'm an east coast girl.  I've kind of lived all over the east coast but never really gone west.
L:  Oh, oh.  Oh, I've lived in Montana and I've lived in Oklahoma and --
R:  Really?
L:  -- I've been, you know, the California direction, down to Texas, up to Montana, and Idaho, Washington I've been --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I've been every direction.  Florida and the Carolinas and -- but I've just never been --
R:  To the east.
L:  --up to the east, north east.
R:  Well, it's a really different -- I mean, I drove across country once.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  I've been to Chicago and -- but I just kinda remember driving across country and it was just -- it's a very different experience.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The east coast is really tight --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like everything is really close together and really fast and --
L:  There's no country probably.  Not so much.
R:  Very little [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, yeah.  That's all it is out here [LAUGH].
R:  I know, I know.
L:  Ah.
R:  I can, um -- yeah, I can remember kind of driving too with a friend of mine.  I was eighteen actually.  I was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, I remember being in Nebraska.  It was, like, eleven thirty at night and the sun was just setting and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you can see as far as the eye --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- could see.
L:  With no buildings to block it [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Nothing.  I was, like oh my gosh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- this is incredible.  It was really beautiful for me.
L:  I can't even imagine the opposite.  Even when I lived in Montana, it's so open.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And towns, I mean, you can drive a couple of hours, two or three or four hours without even coming to a town.  It's like you'd better get gassed up, you know.
R:  That's amazing to me.
L:  In -- in places like yours, I'm sure is the opposite.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I can -- I mean, I grew up actually in downtown Washington --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so I can remember even going out to the more rural parts of Maryland --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even Pennsylvania and it's nothing compared to, sort of, the vast expanse in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Montana and the mid west.  It's just not -- and I used to say, "Oh, my gosh, how do you drive to your neighbors?  What if you run out of gas?"
L:  Uh-huh.  Now, Washington state or Washington DC?
R:  DC.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, it's totally different.  A friend of mine, a high school friend of mine, this last summer came out to visit and we grew up together in Montana but she's been in Phoenix for -- for ever, for decades --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and she -- she came out and visited and I live in the country here --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and she came out and -- and she thought it was so neat, you know, seeing cows, sheep, horses again.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And -- and driving places with -- that's not just all city --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and we went outside in the backyard after it got dark and she said, "What -- what is that noise?" and it was just crickets.  I mean, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it was just night noise and she didn't even know what it was.
R:  That's so funny.
L:  I guess you don't hear it, because she said they don't have any insect there in the city [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and crickets and things.
R:  Right.  Well, it's true.  I mean, our night noises are much more kind of like trucks honking --
L:  Cars and police sirens.
R:  -- and sirens.  I fall asleep very well to police sirens.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  See I got used to it when, you know, you hear the donkeys --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and the coyotes and the crickets out here [LAUGH].
R:  Wow, that's amazing.  Do you have family or are you by yourself?
L:  I'm by myself.  I have a child and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we live here alone and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, we really like it out here.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  We have an- I have my animals and ...
R:  Do you live on a farm?
L:  Nope, I don't have a farm.  I just have a little two acre place.
R:  Oh, wow.  What kind of animals do you have?
L:  Well, right now I'm down to a cat and a guinea pig, my grand pig [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] But I've always had dogs.  I've had five dogs.  That I've had, they've all lived -- I've had them all at the same time.  These five dogs in our family --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- but I just lost the last one and put her to sleep about [NOISE] three weeks ago and she --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- she was the baby and she was fifteen.
R:  Wow!
L:  So, I had em all --
R:  Right.
L:  -- young for years.  They were unrelated dogs.  They were strays and things --
R:  Yeah.
L:  --I'd taken in, you know, within the first couple of years and they were all young together --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the bad thing about that is that they all get old together and you just lose 'em, bam, bam, bam.
R:  Oh, that must've been so hard.
L:  Oh, it was.  The last two or three years, they've -- all five of them have -- they've -- they -- the -- they've all lived really old.  The youngest was fourteen and the oldest was eighteen and I had -- I put 'em all to sleep for one reason or another.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  But my fifteen year old baby [LAUGH] was just my last one here --
R:  Oh, are you --
L:  -- three or four weeks ago.
R:  -- thinking of getting another dog right now or --
L:  I think I'm going to stop for right now and I'm sure I'll succumb one of these days but it's so hard to travel.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I -- you -- you're tied down with them and I don't have family around here and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I thought, "I've never not had a dog all my life" and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I thought, "I think I'll try to be dog free" just so and my little boy can get out and go --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that's one reason I got my -- got him a guinea pig --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a year ago as the old family members started passing away, I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we got a guinea pig.
R:  Right.
L:  My grand pig, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] He's much easier to --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- take care of and --
R:  Definitely and take --
L:  -- leave him overnight one night or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- ship him off to a friend's or something.
R:  Absolutely, a lot easier [LAUGH].
L:  Yes.  Do you have pets?
R:  I have a rabbit actually.
L:  Oh, how neat!
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have a big flop eared rabbit --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that's the size of a cat [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.
R:  She -- so I'm -- yeah, she's also -- she's my -- my little baby.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they are.
R:  Yeah, they're cute.
L:  Never went [inaudible] animal.
R:  How old is your son?
L:  Um, ten.
R:  Oh, that's a fun age.
L:  Uh-huh.  Do you have children?
R:  No, I don't.  I'm in school right now, so ...
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But --
L:  Yeah [SIGH].  Some day then. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, most likely.  A whole litter.
L:  One day you'll torture yourself. [LAUGH]
R:  I know [LAUGH].  I'm terrible I work with kids now.
L:  Oh, do you?  What do you do?
R:  Um, I'm -- I'm finishing up my social work degree.
L:  Your what?  Oh, social work, uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, and most of the people that I work with are adolescent girls.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  So, I love 'em.  They're a big challenge but, um, --
L:  Oh, I bet -- I'm sure girls would be harder than boys, I bet.
R:  They're different.
L:  I would think at that age.  I would think.
R:  Yeah.  It's a lot -- it's a big challenge but when it works, it works so well and --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, girls -- I just -- I love it so ...
L:  But girls grow up so much -- they do everything faster than boys.
R:  They do --
L:  You know.
R:  -- you know.
L:  They're good in ways and bad in others.
R:  It's hard to tell fourteen year olds, "You're not twenty one".  Like --
L:  Right, right.
R:  You may think you are but you're not.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You can't do grown up things.
L:  I know it.
R:  [SIGH] So ...
L:  You don't want to do those grown up things and you'll attract grown up people you don't want to attract.
R:  Right.  Who are already waiting for ya so -- but it's definitely -- I mean, I enjoy it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I guess I'm up -- I'm always up for the challenge so ...
L:  Yeah, well that's a neat career choice.  What -- where did you hear about this phone thing?
R:  Um, a friend of mine.  I'm actually at Pens so, um, I think it's run from the University of Pennsylvania.  I'm not sure but, um, a friend of mine just emailed it to me today and I just said, "Hey".
L:  Had she or he done it?
R:  Um, no.  I don't -- she's done -- she does studies a lot because it's just -- there's so much going on here.  It's like easy money.
L:  Oh.  What do they pay us?  Ten bucks for this conversation. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly but that's fine.
L:  And you didn't -- you can just do it the three times?
R:  Yeah, you can do it three and I heard they can also -- you can do it up to five times if they let you, sort of thing, and there's a -- we're all in a drawing now --
L:  Oh, what fun.
R:  -- to win a thousand dollars.
L:  Well, that sounds cool.  I bet there's a lot of us though.
R:  There's a lot of us so ...
L:  I bet it's a big nationwide big thing.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I saw on the form that some- somebody emailed me that you can do it up to -- I thought it said twenty five or something times.
R:  Yeah, oh yeah.
L:  But you have to do it from five different phones.
R:  I know.
L:  I thought, "How in the world do you do that?"
R:  Yeah, I don't know.  Cell phone, office phone, I guess, maybe.
L:  Yeah, but I don't know.
R:  I don't know.  I was thinking about that, too.  I --
L:  But I didn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I didn't mark that one but I didn't see--
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- where it said up to five times.
R:  Maybe that's what it was --
L:  Maybe.
R:  -- it was five times.  It was all ...
