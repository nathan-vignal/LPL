R:  Hi there, my name is Gene.
L:  Hi, this is Laurie. Um.
R:  Hi, Laurie.
L:  Hi, how are you doing?
R:  Oh, doing okay. I --
L:  That's great.
R:  It's so long since I registered for this but I've almost forgotten exactly what they're looking for. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, we're just supposed to, ah, talk about whatever they ask us to.
R:  Sure.
L:  Yeah.  Um, this is like my second call, so -- 
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  Um, how many calls have you gotten? 
R:  Well, I've actually gotten several but I haven't been available at the times they called.  I felt very badly about it but -- 
L:  Yeah, I know, I -- 
R:  This is the first one I've been able to take. [LAUGH]
L:  I was doing that too.  I kept getting these messages and I knew it was them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it was like, oh, man, I forgot about that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, 'cause it's -- well, like, eleven o'clock at night right now, you know.
R:  Right, exactly.  
L:  And it's, like, shoot.
R:  Well, I picked the one time that I would be available.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That I can talk about it.  So if I understood the question correctly, it was do we see any other countries as threats to the United States' security?
L:  Right, uh-huh.  
R:  Ah, --
L:  Well, it's a very loaded subject, huh? [LAUGH] 
R:  No kidding, yeah, why don't you pick something controversial? 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, really.
R:  I -- it's one of those things where, ah, I -- I think there are a couple of countries that make me nervous.  Ah, as to whether or not they are a genuine threat, I mean -- I -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- potentially almost anybody could -- could be a threat.
L:  I know.  Well, I mean, for one thing -- 
R:  Apart from Canada, you know, something like that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, I mean, a lot of people hate us, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and -- and they always have.  They always have, um, you know, ah, just for the -- the, you know, the countries, you know, in the UN that chose not to support us and all that controversy.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Um, and then, you know, all the -- the ones that could, you know, actually be letting, um, terrorists in, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And all that.  It's -- it's really hard to say, um. 
R:  It is -- it is complex because you have -- I think you have, um, right now, a -- a group of religious fundamentalists that are --
L:  Right.
R:  -- Ah, taking their religion to the extreme and have decided -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- on the target and then, like, you said, "There are a lot of countries that just kind of hate us on principle".  It's kind of like people don't like Walmart.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, because Wal-mart's the big guys. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And McDonald's has been targeted with a lawsuit because -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- they're McDonald's.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, ah, we're kind of the -- the biggest kid on the block right now and that's unfortunate. 
L:  You know, we're the black sheep. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  We -- we really are, you know, and, um, just to think, you know, that whole, um, Islam thing, you know, the holy -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  The holy, um, -- 
R:  The holy war.
L:  The religious issues because so many wars already, you know, have been, you know, based on, you know, like a holy war type thing and -- 
R:  Exactly.  
L:  And I think -- 
R:  If you look back on, I mean, you know, Christianity and the -- the -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, I mean, I'm, you know, that's -- that's my faith but at the same time, you look back --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at something like the crusades.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, good grief, they're going in conquering countries in the name of God and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- yikes, that's the same thing they're doing here. [LAUGH]
L:  I know it, and, you know, it -- it seems to repeat, you know, it might sound like a cliche but it does repeat itself in a lot of ways.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, just the whole thing because of the religion thing, you know, they're not -- they're looking at it as that and, you know, people will fight, you know, for their God and believe they're doing the right thing when, you know, maybe it's not really right.
R:  Yeah, when the rest of the country -- 
L:  Is what I think.
R:  -- is crazy.  After September eleventh, when I realized that there were people out there that were willing to die even if it didn't really change anything -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's, you know, 'cause my opinion is -- has always been well, surely they know if they attack the United States they're -- I mean, nobody can really believe they're going to be able to conquer the US, I wouldn't think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But these guys don't care.
L:  Right.
R:  So we'll go and conquer the US.  We've done a service to our God.  Well, I have no idea how you'd defend that and then because of the fact that it's not an organized army that you can have one person -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- in one location.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's -- that's something. 
L:  I mean, yeah, and just the craziness of the people, you know.  I mean, somebody could just go tomorrow and fly off the deep end and decide to do something -- 
R:  Exactly. 
L:  -- to us, you know, so it's -- it's, you know, very shaky and I just, you know, it's so uncertain, you know, what might happen and who might be involved.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Because, you know, of course it's coming and we're not expecting -- we're not expecting it, you know, and, ah, God knows, you know, what somebody might do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just for the plain fact of who we are, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  And it's once somebody gets something like that in their head -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's just almost impossible it seems, like, to be aware of it and to get it stopped unless they tell somebody else.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think as far as countries, um, you know, the usual suspects, North Korea makes me a little nervous although I think they're -- I think they're a little bitty dog that barks really loudly. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, yeah, because they have all that -- that up there, you know, that we've discovered and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And all those supposed -- 
R:  But the guy -- the guy who leads the country seems a little, -- I don't -- I don't know, he -- he seems convinced it's -- it's almost like a paranoia.  He keeps saying, "The United States is trying to invade us, the United States is preparing to" -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we're sitting over here, going, "We are"? [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, we just want to get to the bottom of what you're up to [LAUGH], you know.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  We want to know, you know, what's -- what's going on over there and how come, you know, these prancers, like, looks like activity has been going on over there.
R:  We'd rather not have California nuked.  I think that's the main thing. [LAUGH] No nuclear weapons launched towards California if you can -- if you can -- 
L:  Are you in California? 
R:  No, actually I'm in -- ah, in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
L:  Yeah, I'm in Texas, yeah.
R:  Oh, okay, so you're just south.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you know, for me, I mean, it's -- it's one of those things where I don't feel the direct threat but I can imagine what it would be like living in California knowing, you know, if he gets one of those built -- [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.
R:  He can get to me.
L:  I guess, definitely.
R:  That would make me nervous.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And then I kind of wonder --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what's going to happen with Saudi Arabia as well.
L:  Yeah, because they bear us, you know, one of those -- you know, they've got some power themselves.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Over there and what -- what would be the scariest thing is for a bunch of these, ah, countries to -- to gang up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and band together and -- and come up with a plan, you know, to go against us, ah, because, you know, like you said, just one country probably can't do it, but -- 
R:  But a bunch of them together probably could.
L:  Yeah, if they somehow or other banded together and decided that -- to retaliate against us for religion or power type whatever, it might be or just plain hatred.
R:  Well, Russia and China, when they began making noise about what we were doing, that made me a little bit nervous because although Russia is broke, ah, neither one of those are small countries.  They've got an awful lot of people they could throw at us if they wanted to.
L:  Right.  They've got God knows what they have. [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah, exactly.  
L:  You know. [LAUGH]
R:  So has China.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Russia, like I said, I figure they're so broke they don't have much at this point but China -- China is one that -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They -- they could have any number of things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So those -- those two I think in -- the Middle East, ah -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  China, ah, not really.  I don't think Russia's really going to do anything now.
L:  Yeah, I don't think so either.
R:  Ah, and then, ah, North Korea, and I have been interested, um, of course, this has -- this has gotten a lot quieter it seems, like, since we went to war with Iraq, but there was a time at least where India and Pakistan looked like they were going to -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- go after each other.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, ah, I haven't heard anything lately on that but that -- because of the fact that what had they -- had they both gotten nukes?  I couldn't remember whether they both go- --
L:  I don't know, but, you know, they've always, I think they've always been, ah, in -- in a battle over, ah, Cashmere.
R:  Yeah, exactly. 
L:  But, you know, that's been going on forever, so -- 
R:  The same sort of thing with Israel and -- 
L:  That's, like, nothing new, but -- 
R:  -- Palestine.
L:  There are a lot of Muslims over there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Too, you know, and -- and I don't think they like, you know, the fact of what we did.
R:  No.
L:  And everything because, you know, they're going to all stick together if you ask me.  I really think they would if it came down to it.
R:  It does seem, like, that group, ah, sticks together.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Very strongly and it's something that -- that surprised me.  I must admit it did catch me off guard in Iraq when we started seeing some anti American protests.
L:  Right.
R:  After we liberated them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That was a little hard to watch, um, but kind of like you said, their religion is more important -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than anything else that's going on.
L:  Right.
R:  Part of -- part of me admires it and part of me is completely terrified of it. [LAUGH] Um. 
L:  Yeah, because, you know, it's just, you know, that -- that blinds them to seems, like, what -- to do what's really right for the greater good.
R:  Yeah, or to -- or to appreciate anyone outside of their religion.  I mean, you know, that's, you know, that's my thing.  I -- I tried to reverse the thing in my head and think okay, let's -- let's say that I was -- that -- that the United States was a country that was overrun by Russia or China or whatever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Let's say that there was another country -- let's say it was a middle eastern, um, you know, Islamic fundamental Muslim country that came in and liberated us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Would I be spitting on them and telling them to get out?  No, I don't -- at least I don't think so.
L:  If things were really bad, you know, I mean -- I mean, I -- I think it would be a good thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, but -- 
R:  I wouldn't -- wouldn't necessarily trust them that much.
L:  No, no, of course not.
R:  I would be nervous but I wouldn't be trying to -- I wouldn't be protesting. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Yeah, because they are, you know, if they could just realize, you know, this is not about your religion.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and it's not about your oil.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it's really not, you know, but a lot of people view us as going in there and trying to take over because of that oil I think too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  It has been funny to watch Rumsfeld, ah, responding to --
