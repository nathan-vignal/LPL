L:  Rachel.
R:  Simone.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Simone.
L:  Hi, I'm Rachel.
R:  Hi.
L:  Um, so, do you -- what countries do you think are a threat to the -- the US?
R:  I actually don't think that any countries are a threat to the US.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I -- [NOISE] do you think that there are countries that are a threat to the US? 
L:  Wait, I didn't hear you.  What did you say? 
R:  I -- I was -- can you hear me now?
L:  Yes.
R:  I don't think that any countries are a threat to the US.  Um, [LIPSMACK] do -- do you think that there are countries that are a threat?
L:  I think right now, given the war, um, in those couple of years -- well, once they, you know, get back to normal, Iraq will probably be a big threat [LAUGH] to us considering what we just did to them.
R:  So, you think that they're a threat because of what we did?  What -- the war that we, [NOISE] um, -- went there -- but why do you think that they would be a threat?  I mean, what --
L:  Well, right now I think they will be in -- in a little while once they get better maybe if, um, Saddam is found and -- or if he comes about and builds an army again.  I -- I don't know if he died.  I haven't been watching TV, but, um, d- did they find out whether he died or not? 
R:  I actually don't watch TV at all either.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I listen to the radio, but from what I've heard they haven't.  Um, so you think that if he were in power or if he, um, [LIPSMACK] came back that there could be a threat either from, um, Iraq as a nation or some individual people within Iraq [inaudible]? 
L:  It's probably individual actually.  Probably not the country then.  
R:  Okay, som- --
L:  More so like he's a threat and people that follow him are a threat, but not the country as a whole.
R:  Mm.
L:  I guess would be --
R:  Um, --
L:  -- more of the answer.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I -- I probably would kind -- ah, sort of agree with you just because I don't think -- when I say I don't think any countries are a threat, it's basically because, um, [LIPSMACK] I -- well, I mean -- I -- I do think that if we threaten other nations, um, you know, with our power -- not necessarily just with war but with our policies, that there's a danger, um, that countries begin to see us as the cause of a lot of their problems.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, so, um, in that sense there's a potential for that, but I don't -- I don't necessarily feel a threat in the same way that I hear a lot of people talking about September eleventh and how, you know, they can attack us at any moment.  I actually heard somebody speaking today about how, um, American lives are, um, threatened.  You never know at any moment, um, with international terrorism every single one of us is a target.  Um, but I think that -- I don't think that it's necessarily any worse now than it has been in the past.  It might have been other groups that wouldn't necessarily have targeted Americans but you could have -- while travelling in certain countries you could have, um, been, like, a casualty of -- of a target of somebody else -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but -- do you know what I'm saying?  Like, [MN] it's somebody else in other countries targeted or, um, not just an individual but, say -- [MN] the example that I always think of is, like, the IRA.  If -- if they plant bombs in Britain, you as a traveller could potentially be hit by that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, so, I don't think that, um, [LIPSMACK] -- that that necessarily makes us any more of a threat today just because for the most part no Americans are travelling to the parts of the world where Iraqis live or where Afghans live or -- do you know what I'm saying?  So, I don't think that we're any more threatened right now than we have been and I don't think that --
L:  Are you talking about we as individuals or we as a country? 
R:  Yeah, yeah, we as individuals, and as a country just because I don't think that any of the other countries have any of the weapons that could possibly even reach the United States.
L:  Oh, that's true.  That's true. 
R:  So, ... 
L:  But they have creative ways of coming in and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- doing stuff --
R:  That --
L:  -- to us like, ah, September eleventh.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's true, but I don't -- I mean, I think that those [MN] -- I don't know how to put it into words, but I basically don't think that, um, -- [PAUSE] that [MN] a person can think about those kinds of things.  Like, I mean, in a sense September eleventh is completely a fluke that it went off the way that it did.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] and, so, while there are creative ways of getting around not having the same capabilities militarily that the United States have, I don't think that -- I still just don't think the United States is heavily threatened.  When I hear Bush or other people talking about, "Oh, the US is, you know, there's this threat.  We have to give up our civil liberties". I just -- I don't see that.  I don't see us as being in imminent threat or imminently threatened, um, by other nations at all, or even people from those other nations.
L:  Mm.  I do see individuals, especially travelling in other parts of the world, not necessarily Iraq but, um, just in other parts, Americans which particularly -- I see them as possibly being threatened just as -- by anti American people pretty much, not countries but people, because I know, um, I mean I -- I did some studying abroad last year and, you know, there are people out there that hate Americans.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, --
R:  Where did you study abroad? 
L:  London.
R:  Okay.
L:  And surprisingly, right?  You know, our [LAUGH] -- our country that -- you know, supposed to be our friend.  There are people over there that absolutely hate us.  So, I definitely think that --
R:  What do you think that they hate -- when you say us, what do you mean?  Like, Americans or --
L:  Ameri- -- 
R:  That they dislike our government or that they dislike the attitude of Americans --
L:  Attitudes --
R:  -- or --
L:  -- of Americans.
R:  Which is not to say, like, that they hate us but that they hate our attitude.
L:  Well, I think they found that, um, -- that I guess they have stereotypes of what Americans are and [NOISE] -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's what they're basing it all off of.  They don't understand that we're different.
R:  But it seems like we create those stereotypes ourselves in a sense, I mean, and we're making people hate us -- hate us with those, um, stereotypes either basically through the media, but I think, like, the kinds of policies that our government, um, makes also kind of stereotypes us in a sense by making it like we're very individualistic, we're going to make our own choices, which is not necessarily, like, how individually Americans think, but in a sense, like, I feel like the government is stereotyping us by doing that.
L:  Mm, I see that.  I can definitely see that.  Um, I don't know.  Everything -- sorry, I'm thinking back to I guess in the beginning.  Everything used to be decent when, ah, Washington used to lead the c- -- I think it's Washington that said, you know, "We lead by a policy of isolation.  We don't mess with it if it doesn't pertain to us".  But now everything does -- [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- pertain to us.  So, I guess that whole theory of isolation and the way we were led back then has completely died down [LAUGH] one hundred percent.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.  So, when you were travelling abroad did you meet non British people who, um, either disliked America or who you thought were a threat to the United States? 
L:  Um, I did meet one.  He was in my study group.  He was actually in England.  He was, um, -- he was very happy when September eleventh happened and I actually got in an argument over -- September eleventh -- 
R:  But he wasn't -- he wasn't British? 
L:  No, he was -- I don't know what he was, actually.  I mean, I never asked.  He -- he definitely was not English born or English raised or whatever you want to say.  He, um, [LIPSMACK] -- he was very happy about it, [LAUGH] very happy about September eleventh, so, ... 
R:  [MN] What -- like what did he say? 
L:  Oh, gosh, I can't even remember the details.  I just remember he said, "You know, Americans go in and they do this to other countries all the time.  I'm happy to see it's happened --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to them for once.  I was laughing when it happened.  I thought it was funny".  Um, a lot of -- there were also some other British kids in the room with me, though, and they were just -- they were appalled that he was saying it because I kept saying, "You know what, it's, ah, innocent people that have died.  It's, [LAUGH] you know, -- it's -- 
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  "-- not necessarily people that are making the policies, just normal people like you and me that have died and that's the sad thing, and you were laughing about this.  What's wrong with you?"  You know, so, possibly somebody like him might be [LAUGH] a threat -- [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  -- to America.  Someone with that mind set of, um, -- of, you know, "You've done it to others.  Now, it's good that it's done to you".
R:  But do you think that British people are a threat? 
L:  I wouldn't say it's British people because he definitely is not British.
R:  But before you were saying that there were British people who hate America.  So, do you think that that hatred carries over to being a threat?
L:  Um, no.  They just hate us.  I -- I don't feel threatened by them or I -- I didn't feel threatened by them.  So, ...
