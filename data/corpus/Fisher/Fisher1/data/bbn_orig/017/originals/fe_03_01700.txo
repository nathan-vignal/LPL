L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, my name is Kathy.
R:  I'm Melody.
L:  I'm glad to meet you.  I'm from Iowa.
R:  I'm from Oregon.
L:  Oh, my goodness, the second one from Oregon.  I had Oregon last night.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, how do you feel about the Middle East? [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] Well, I think it's like a pot just waiting to boil over.
L:  I think you probably got that one right.
R:  [LAUGH] Ah, yeah, it's pretty scary.  It's a tense situation and there's a lot of issues at hand.
L:  Yeah, um, I al- -- I do feel though that since we've gone over there, you know, killed so many people and lost so many of the people, that we can't do what we did last time and walk out before things are at least, you know, calmed down over there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because if we walk back out on it, you know, they're saying he's still walking around somewhere or hiding, he'll come right back and do it all over again.
R:  Oh, sure he will.
L:  You know?  And then they'll never s- -- I mean, they don't think well of us anyway --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- so I, you know, I don't think that we should leave yet, but [COUGH] I definitely hope that what the United States is saying, or what, excuse me, the government is saying, is really the truth, you know, that they aren't there because of the oil and they're there to free the people and that's a- all they're going to be there for.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH] But as far as peace in the Middle East, [SIGH] that's never going to be, in my opinion, because, um, the Bible says it's not going to be until it's over. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you're right.
L:  You know?
R:  You're right.
L:  It's -- it's not gonna be and it's, you know, it's the -- I- Israel is the site of everything and it's the cause of everything and it's going to be that way until, uh, you know, until the Lord comes back and [SIGH] we get rid of all the rest of 'em. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess that's the best way to put it, without going into a great deal of detail. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, but I know what you're talking about.  I -- I read the Good Book too, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, ah, it's, ah, real, real interesting to me.
L:  Well, it's, yeah, it's just been really strange, compared to last time.  I'm just -- I'm so glad that they finally toppled him this time, you know?  I was so disappointed when [COUGH] the other Bush was in and, you know, they were going to go in and hit him with the Special Forces, and then they goofed up or something happened, I don't know what it was, and -- and they just never went back in, you know, and then he was just twice the tyrant as he was before.  I -- I just don't understand [SIGH] sometimes I think that it would be better if a woman was running things. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I hate to say that, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, well, we get things done, we don't, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's like, o- okay, so it's politics, big deal.  Let's get down to what this really means.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But guys can't do that.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  For some reason they just can't do -- [LAUGH] you know, "I'm a Democrat and I'm not going to pay any attention to you because you're a Republican", you know?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  I mean, I just think all that stuff is just so stupid.
R:  It is.
L:  They're going to get a big kick out of this conversation, I'm telling you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This must be why they call me back so much.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, go ahead and make it. [LAUGH] Yeah, um, I -- I think that they really need to take care of the issues this time and, you know, uh, don't let him get away with anything more.
L:  Do you think he's alive?
R:  I think he might be, according to what they been saying.
L:  Yeah, that's what I was kind of wondering now because, you know, at first -- I mean, and it -- it still could be that, you know, I mean, he could be with O- -- with +Osama bin Laden.  Maybe they're both in -- in Syria. [LAUGH]
R:  It could be, or --
L:  And so are the chemical weapons. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well, you know, they said some of the upper, uh, people in the re- -- his regime have escaped to other countries besides Syria, you know, like maybe France or God knows where.
L:  Uh, Germany. [LAUGH]
R:  Germany, I was just going to say that, yeah.
L:  "But I'm so sorry" said the Chancellor, "I didn't want to offend the United States".  It's amazing how everything changed once we wiped the place out, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- their whole attitude changed.  Now it's just, like, "How could you be so ignorant?" [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean that's just so -- I just think that's so --
R:   Ah.
L:  -- oh, [LIPSMACK] they just make no sense. [LAUGH]
R:  W- what do you think about France's role in all this?
L:  Well, you know what?  When you look back at France's history, France has been a wuss forever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They've always, you know, stood on the -- right on the fence, and -- and they never would jump one way or the other and, uh, you know, as far as I'm concerned [COUGH] things aren't gray, they're black and white --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you're either the good guys or you're the bad guys, regardless of what it is --
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  -- and if you're going to stay on the fence, as far as I'm concerned, that's pretty gutless, you know?
R:  Well, you know, I've studied, uh, some of France's conquests in Indochina and other countries --
L:  Have you?
R:  Yeah, and it seems like they, ah, go in for the resources mostly.
L:  Well, and see, that's what they were -- that's what they're blaming us for.  Well, I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- wonder why they might think that?
R:  Yeah, well [SIGH] [LAUGH] --
L:  'Course -- 'course George Junior does own a gas company but [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I mean, a oil company, which is rather ironic, but [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- you know?
R:  -- well I heard scuttle but yes and no against it.  I don't know, I have no opinion 'cause I don't know.
L:  Well, I guess we'll have to wait and see on that.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I would certainly hope not, because as much as a Christian as he appears to be, you know, if -- if he -- if he g- -- shows those kind of colors to people, he's going to go down as bad, if not worse, than Clinton did, you know?
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Um, i- i- -- for different reasons of course, but you know, i- i- -- I mean, talk about being ashamed. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, he'd have a lot to --
L:  I would just --
R:  -- a lot to answer for if -- if he doesn't back up what he said, you know --
L:  Oh, no kidding. 
R:  -- or he -- he -- or if -- if he's just --
L:  I mean, I -- I -- I hope that he is what he is, because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I know his, you know, when I studied, um, I was really studying the New Age when George Senior was in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a- and found out that he was skull and crossbones and all that stuff and I really didn't like him very well [LAUGH] I mean, I just -- he had, you know, much of -- much of a New Age attitude, as far as I was concerned.  But I -- I really don't feel his son does, but you know, if I -- i- if I ever find out, I'm going to be really upset. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I hate, you know -- but I've made mistakes before.  I'm really good at, like, I guess maybe sometimes I'm gullible.  I always want to think the best about everybody, you know?
R:  Well, that's the w- -- good old American way.
L:  Yeah, I guess.  I don't know how far that gets us in all those other countries though. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, you know, these people in the Middle East, they're -- they have always fought bitterly amongst themselves, and the faction.
L:  Well, it's holy wars.
R:  Yeah --
L:  I mean -- and if you die -- if you die or kill somebody, i- it's -- it's kind of like if you're a Christian and you get crowned, you know, a- -- when you go to heaven --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's the same thing in -- in their religion, only it's because you killed somebody or [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or you -- or you destroy something or whatever, you know, and -- and if you stop and look outside of that, you're looking at the good side and the bad side right there --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know?
R:  But -- but it's been their tradition just to kill each other, you know?  How --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- family members, cousins, you name it.
L:  Well, and what does that -- what does that say, I don't remember, it's in John where it says, um, no, it's not either, it's in Revelation.  No, it's John.  Ah, I don't know.  Anyway [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- where it says, "Brother kills br- brother and brother kills brother".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And [MN] that -- I mean, that -- 'cause they're all brothers --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's what's so sad about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they can't figure out that Israel was given all that land and it isn't theirs anyway. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think it's just, ah, it's too bad. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, if they'd just listen to me, I could make it so much easier for everybody. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You'd make a -- make a good president. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I think so.  I think I could, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I think I could y- -- if people would listen, they'd probably just laugh, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Like we do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And they'd go, "Oh, lady, it's not this easy".
R:  Yeah, well, it's all male dominated, so --
L:  That's right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.  I think that's the problem.
R:  Oh, I'm sure that's a lot of it, but [SIGH] --
L:  But I -- there was a [SIGH] on -- on the news here tonight, there was a girl that lives in Molleen[?], which is about thirty five miles from here, [SIGH] and, um, [LIPSMACK] she was, um, in +Baghdad, B- +Baghdad.  Baghdad, that's where she lived and she --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- moved here sixteen years ago, and they were interviewing her, and she wants to go back and teach the women there how women live in a democracy.
R:  That would be nice.
L:  Which -- w- -- yeah, I thought that was real admirable of her, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to come here and get a education and then [SIGH] um, you know, she of course started crying when she said, you know, she hated to see Baghdad completely torn apart like it is.
R:  Oh, it --
L:  But there wasn't any other way to get rid of him, if we did.
R:  Yeah, you know, I was watching CNN and they showed, uh, Baghdad before they -- people came in and blew it u- -- it looked like a beautiful city.
L:  Well, the part where Saddam is, anyway.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know very much about it, but it looked like a pretty place.
L:  Oh yeah, it looks like Florida or something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, or Cuba --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'course that's what he's got when he's smoking those cigars.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was thinking that tonight, they showed him on TV, and I thought, "Uh-huh, I bet you Castro sent you those.
R:  Probably.
L:  You guys are all good buddies".
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  I just -- I just think it would be so neat, you know, since they [SIGH] they got the -- well, one son in law that came back with his bodyguard from Syria, I think it'd be so cool if we scared Syria enough, because you know what?  If -- if they really are there, and we leave, all of our troops leave, and they all run right back over, I -- I'm going to really be upset. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, of course they'll come home.
L:  Unless they're going to, like, you know, get in a big fight with him, and then go in there too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But then they're going to have to go into Jordan and they'll have to go -- oh, Palestine and, I mean, and -- you know what it'll be then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It'll be a mess.
R:  Well, I guess -- I guess Israel had, uh, weapons on the ready, you know, in case, uh --
L:  Oh yeah, they went into the Gaza Strip the other day --
R:  Oh, did they?
L:  -- I get an -- I get an email from Jerusalem --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, every day, and yeah, they went in.  They were -- they were -- they had, um, tanks and everything in there.
R:  Wow.
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH]  So, you know, but they told them to keep their nose clean and stay out of Iraq, so they got to keep theirselves --
R:  Well --
L:  -- busy with Palestine, I guess.
R:  Yeah, well, I know that Israel is scared, you know?  For -- with good reason.
L:  Well, how could they not be?  But, you know what?  They are the num- -- you know, other than us, they're -- they're the number two force.
R:  Are they really?
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  I didn't know that.
L:  Oh yeah.  They -- oh, yes.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, they -- oh yeah, they got a reckoning, plus you know what?  Anybody that goes after them, you know who's behind 'em?  They're --
R:  Oh well, we are.
L:  They're done anyway.  Well, we are, but God is.
R:  Oh well, sure, sure.
L:  So -- I mean, that's how they got through the Six Day War, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Well, that was a butt kicking time.  I read about that.
L:  Mhm.  I didn't remember it that much, because I was just a kid, but yeah --
