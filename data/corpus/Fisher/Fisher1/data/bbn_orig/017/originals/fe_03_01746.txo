L:  Hi, my name's Barbara Fairly[?] I live in, ah, [inaudible] in Pennsylvania.
R:  Yeah, I'm Betty, I live in Arkansas. 
L:  Hi, Betty. 
R:  Hi.
L:  This is a good question. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes, it is. 
L:  I really haven't given it much thought.
R:  Well, I -- I do kind of consider Syria as a threat -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- I -- I think that's what she's, um, implying, isn't she?
L:  Well, any countries that, a- you know, ah, Syria has been in the news, so, ah, I tend to think that maybe they may be hiding out there --  
R:  Ah, yeah.
L:  -- Saddam and his crew.
R:  That of course, like you say, if you've got -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- you've got all of them over there, that could be anywhere.
L:  Yeah, but what about Korea's -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- been -- 
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  -- North Korea -- 
R:  -- Korea bothers me a lot.
L:  Yeah, I -- I'm more concerned I think with them with their nuclear capabilities.
R:  Oh, yes, I -- I'm definitely think they could do us a lot more harm in -- in a country their size. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, ah, their p- you know, Pakistan, I mean there's so many of them I wouldn't trust at all.
L:  Right, Ir- Iran --  
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- is another one.  And, ah, you know, which country was it that, um, wouldn't let us, ah, finally use their -- 
R:  Jordan.
L:  Jordan -- 
R:  Ah, Turkey.
L:  Turkey, yep -- 
R:  Turkey.
L:  Yeah.  Anything that Arab, ah, I don't know, um, see, I'm just not that familiar with -- I should be I guess, but I'm not familiar with their arms capability -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- we certainly showed --  showed the Arab nation that, ah, you know, we mean business when we go in -- 
R:  [MN] I understand -- 
L:  -- made fast, ah, you know, fast finish of that, ah, war.
R:  Well, ah, I know that, but I just don't [MN] know that we can keep that and our boys at risk for all of 'em. 
L:  Oh, no, I -- I don't think that -- that, um, I really wouldn't wanna see that -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- I -- but I am -- I'm -- I'm, ah, more concerned with -- with nuclear, ah, problems than anything and -- 
R:  Well, -- 
L:  -- but I would say North Korea would probably concern me more than, you know, the -- the, ah, Syria or any other Arab -- 
R:  Oh, I -- 
L:  -- nation.
R:  -- I definitely agree in terms you're talking in nuclear -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in your talking [SIGH] what's involved.  When you're talking something serious and I really -- I don't even, like I say, I don't know that much about it -- it just -- I think North Korea's the only place probably that is our size that has nuclear and from what I've heard about their leadership they're not shy about using it. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yeah, they seem to be pretty, ah, bold, I mean -- 
R:  Ye- yeah.
L:  -- I mean we -- we -- we give them so much aid and they -- 
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  -- you know.
R:  I was just watching the news for the people in Baghdad now's wanting all the Americans out of there, you know, they want to run their own country.
L:  Yeah, that -- that Saddam is coming walking right back in. [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, yeah.  I mean I can understand them wanting to run their country, but I think they need to give it time -- 
L:  Yeah. [MN]
R:  -- because, you know, we did lose lives over there fighting for them.
L:  We sure did.
R:  Mm.  
L:  I -- 
R:  -- other than that -- 
L:  -- I was in favor of the -- of the war though -- 
R:  I -- I was in favor for that, I thought he needed to be gotten out. 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But I -- I'll -- I don't believe he's dead. 
L:  I -- I don't either.  I think -- I really think, ah, in addition to nuclear problems -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  -- I would think that terrorism, ah, um, needs to, ah, whoever is harboring, ah, the terrorists and it's just so hard for them to -- to, ah, keep track of them all but, um, you know, Palestine has terrorists that seem to be, you know, targeting Israel -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  -- but solely but, ah, you don't know, ah, what sects branch from off from them and, ah, I -- I heard today on the, ah, radio that, um, tha- that they're -- they're still concerned with, ah, suicide bombers in -- in, ah, Iraq, you know, people that -- a lot of people from other n- countries came in and, you know, they believe that -- that, ah, give up their life is -- 
R:  Oh, yes, ex-- 
L:  -- is -- is a good thing.
R:  [MN] Yeah, that, ah -- oh, when they were first -- when you first got into the war they were talking about like four thousand people were volunteering to be suicide bombers -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, goodness gracious, ah, they must be so brainwashed or, I -- I mean I don't know, I -- I can't -- I can't even feature -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ah, that I would give my life for somebody like Hussein -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and, um, -- 
L:  Or, how about the -- the terrorist bombers, I mean -- 
R:  Oh, that's what I [MN] -- 
L:  -- tha- that -- nine eleven -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they, um, you know, we say, "Oh, they -- they -- they didn't care [MN]" they don't care about themselves, why should they care about our people -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- they have no respect for -- you saw what they did, ah, they took their national treasures and, ah, destroyed them.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean I could see the people -- the people that went in and, ah, took them for the purpose of reselling them and for the money, ah, that's one thing, but to d- destroy the national treasures I mean -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- that's just something an animal would do, you know?
R:  Ah, yeah, it was, it was bad but I -- you know, the only thing I can [SIGH] you know, in my mind is maybe that he had so much for so many years and they had so little until they destroyed they could get their hands on --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but he still, you know -- 
L:  Not too smart though. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, it wasn't very smart at all -- 
L:  Thank God, ah, we saved the oil fields this time. 
R:  Ah, yeah, I just saw on the news where there's two different places and, you know -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- in this place today this white powder has shown up, you know and -- and -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the postal service went in -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and checked it and it's nothing that, you know, they're still on high alert as far as something like that goes -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- we don't really know any day what they could retaliate against us again.
L:  Yeah, how about the smallpox, ah,  -- 
R:  Oh -- 
L:  -- [MN] if -- if the shot wasn't dangerous -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  -- I would demand to have it, by -- 
R:  They have decided now it's dangerous.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Because my daughter she's in Iran and they started giving 'em where she worked and she just produced [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, she was going to wait and see and then I saw here last week where they had tore them off because they're dangerous and there had been a few where she worked at [inaudible]. 
L:  Yeah, I've had a couple of people that died from them -- 
R:  And, um, I didn't asked her after I heard this where they'd took them off, you know, how those were doing but she was talking about there had been quite a few because she works in the emergency department and, ah, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- she said she wouldn't take any and I said, [MN] "You know, completely immandatory, which is not mandatory".
L:  Right, it's -- it's -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a clear and present danger -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- you know, you take the risk, but to -- to take it now, ah, I -- I don't know, but -- 
R:  I -- I don't know -- 
L:  -- If they don't tell us everything, we don't know, ah, -- 
R:  Oh, goodness. [SIGH]
L:  -- they said the powder that they found, t- the way they handled it this time was so much more efficiently done than, ah, when it happened the first time but -- 
R:  Well, this is true but, ah, you know, I -- I just like you say -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- there is no way that we even know even a chance of what's really going on -- 
L:  No, no.
R:  -- and, ah, you know, that -- that's why it scares me, but also I know if I probably knew the truth it would scare me to death.
L:  Yeah, it -- it must be why these, um, men go into the presidency and, ah, six month's later they've [LAUGH] aged ten years.
R:  [MN] Yeah, they all do that.
L:  I don't think I could sleep with that knowing all that they must know.  Ah, Cuba is another country.
R:  Yes, it is and it's close. 
L:  Yeah, it's very close and maybe not nuclear, ah, capabilities but, you know, you get, ah, ah, dedicated band of terrorists down there that, ah, they could have those missiles that, ah, -- what do they call them?  Surface missiles -- 
R:  Surface air missiles, all of those, yeah, -- 
L:  -- that can take planes down and, ah, you know, they could cause a lot of damage right from -- of course, we have bases down there we monitor that one pretty closely.
R:  But I never [SIGH] I never realized until just, well, it's probably been the last year or two how close that Alaska is to Russia.  You know, we're only eight miles?
L:  Yeah, and Russia, I don't, um, um, -- 
R:  I mean they could be over right in the middle of the United States crossing that border.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then when you stop and think, yeah, we did purchase Alaska from Russia -- 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- but I didn't realise there was only eight miles.
L:  How many miles?
R:  Eight.
L:  Oh, I didn't know that.
R:  Yeah, we've purchased Alaska from 'em -- 
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- and there's eight miles -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- is what they say from Alaska to Russia.
L:  Oh.
R:  Now, that's scary.
L:  That is scary -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- and I don't trust the Russians, um, they -- 
R:  I don't trust any of 'em -- 
L:  -- may be down but they're not out, you know -- 
R:  Well, -- 
L:  -- and they did show their colors -- 
R:  Well, sure, -- 
L:  -- doing this war thing.
R:  Yeah, they wanted to stay [MN] what I call straddle the fence -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they wanted to be on both sides.
L:  Well, they were selling, they -- they sell a lot of, ah, these, ah, nations, the Arab -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- nations their helicopters and their weapons, you know, --  
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- they don't want to lose, you know, their, ah, you know, their business that they get form them.
R:  Well, they said they found so m- much they're in Iraq -- Russia had supplied them wares.
L:  Exactly. 
R:  Even training, know how to use it.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  So [NOISE] you know, personally I just don't trust any of em. 
L:  No.  Ah, France, I just think France was trying to protect themselves, you know, from terrorists and all that, but -- but Russia's, ah, you know, that's a serious, ah, a serious country t--
