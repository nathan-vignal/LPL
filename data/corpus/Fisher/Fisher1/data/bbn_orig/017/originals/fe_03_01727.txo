L:  Yes, this is, um, Patricia at, uh, in Salem, Oregon.
R:  Hi, I'm Sharon and I'm in Virginia Beach, Virginia.
L:  Oh, boy they put us far apart, didn't they?
R:  Yeah, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I feel weird.  I've never done this before.
L:  Oh, really.  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I did this last week so it was kind of interesting.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um, so, of course [MN] talking about the country that you think that is a threat to us, yes, I think Korea is very much a threat and, of course, I live on the west coast and it is much more of a threat than probably over there in Virginia Beach. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  No, I agree, Korea.  I am also worried about Syria, too.
L:  Oh,
R:  I think that, um, you know, they've been helping Saddam Hussein and helping all them over there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that -- that kind of concerns me also.  I'm afraid that that might be the next step going into there, too.
L:  Oh.  Yeah, I say you answer the questions and do those things, you know, you -- that's been kind of secretive.  We really don't know too much about Syria.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like okay, now what are they up to, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  I'm [MN] not -- really if I [MN] -- and, of course, everything that is different than our culture, what we, you know, um -- I've lived in the same place for a long time and I have -- I have the -- you know, I'm a family background culture and -- and it's really hard to look at another culture and think they way they do.
R:  Yeah, I -- I agree with that, too.  Um, I ha- -- it's just that whole area over there, though --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the whole Middle Eastern area, just scares me [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.
R:  I -- I grew up in New York and I have family in New York and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the whole thing with the World Trade Center --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- my sister in law was missing for a long time, so --
L:  Oh, my so you're fairly close --
R:  -- yeah, so that whole area just -- it concerns me.
L:  Mhm.  So, you were in, um -- did you find your sister and everything?  How long was it before you found your sister?  Was she in New York at the time and --
R:  Yes.  Yes, she, um -- actually she worked for the New York Stock Exchange.
L:  Oh, my.  Okay. [NOISE]
R:  It was my sister in law, and my brother was in Jersey --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at the time so they closed all the bridges and nobody could get through on the phone.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she saw the plane hit when she went to work that morning.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  And my brother couldn't call anybody.  It was weird.  Nobody in New York could call each other but they could call me.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, it turned out that he kept calling me, had to stop at pay phones because his cell phone wouldn't work 'cause all -- ever- -- you know, everything was jammed up there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And he kept -- he couldn't get back to New York to even look for her --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I just kept trying all the numbers I had for her and finally I got a message --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that she was okay.
L:  Oh.
R:  And then I had to call --
L:  So, you were pretty close to the whole thing, weren't you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That was -- that's kind of [inaudible]
R:  And also her mother was in Manhattan at the time and she went to her friend's apartment but she didn't know her daughter was alive because she couldn't get through to anybody.  I was the only one to get through to let everybody know that everybody was okay.
L:  Oh.  Oh my goodness sake. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that was a really bad day.
L:  So, then you're pretty close to, oh, even Iraq, and you -- did you want the war then in Iraq?
R:  Yes, I did.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, I don't know if you're familiar with Virginia Beach at all?  It is very military.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes.  Military bases.  There's Camp Pendleton, which is marines.  We have a navy base.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We, um, have, you know, a Norfolk terminal which all the aircraft carriers come into.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it's very military down here and so, I sup- sup- support the war and I support our troops.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, you know, I feel bad for the people over there in Iraq.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just the civilians and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- everyday people 'cause a lot of them got harmed, but yes, I was for the war.  I was kind of hoping that Osama bin Laden was going to be found in Iraq [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  But that didn't pan out and we still haven't even found Saddam Hussein.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  But --
L:  Well, I -- I feel that, um, of course, you're a little bit closer but I -- when you get -- I'm -- I'm not really near a military base and, of course, my daughter travels quite a bit and she lives in Phoenix and she -- she was bothered by it.  She said after the, uh, nine eleven she felt that every time a plane came over, it might have -- [LAUGH] it could have hit her house or something like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  She lives in the middle of Phoenix and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But she was a little, you know, concerned on that way but --
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, Syria -- you know, I just kind of -- I'm kind of neutral.  I'm kind of like wait and see.  I -- I am --
R:  I think -- I -- you know, they say that were -- I think they were helping Saddam Hussein.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I do.  But, I mean, that's just my personal opinion.  I think -- I don't think all the truth will come out.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean we still haven't even found out if Iraq did have weapons of mass destruction so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, yeah, Korea --
L:  Well, I think they'll still [inaudible]
R:  -- Korea is definitely a worry too, though.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, I agree with you on that one.  I think while we are busy with Iraq, they're [LAUGH] busy --
L:  Planning --
R:  -- planning, making bombs --
L:  And getting a lot of --
R:  -- of mass destruction.
L:  -- atomic weapons and stuff like that.
R:  Mhm.  Yep.
L:  And I really don't think that we can really deal with them like Cl- the way Clinton, you know, dealt with them, give 'em money --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then say, "Okay, now you stop".  I think now you -- you stop and then we'll talk about money [LAUGH].
R:  I agree.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I agree with that, too.
L:  I don't think we should give them any more money.  I think that's kind of a ploy and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, I really feel that -- um, but I think after the war in Iraq, I think they have to look at their situation and say, "Hey, maybe we'll do what we say". [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and go in there and say, "Okay, now it's your turn" you know.
R:  Yeah, that's what I'm hoping, too, that maybe these countries will see that President Bush won't just be pushed around.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, they have to comply with the UN regulations and come forward if they do have any of these weapons 'cause if they don't, guess what we're going to be knocking on your door next.
L:  Mhm.  Well, are you, uh, doing anything different as far as, uh, safety is concerned?  You know, like okay what if, um, you have more terrorist attacks?  What -- are you -- are you doing anything personally to ...?
R:  No, we discussed as a family that -- you know, you learn.  Um, let's just automatically make somebody outside of the state a call point --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so if something happens in New York again, we'll make me the call point. 
L:  I see.
R:  God forbid, if anything happened here, everybody will call my brother in New York.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because we were really afraid that day that something was gonna happen here only because of all the military bases.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, we're, you know, they kept saying that those could be a target.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, we were -- we were really concerned but, um, as far as not flying and things like that, no [NOISE] we're not.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We haven't stockpiled water and duct tape and any of that stuff [LAUGH].
L:  That's what I wanted to know if you were gonna, you know, do any survival things.
R:  No, no.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What about you?
L:  No, we really haven't.  We think about it and we might buy a little bit more food and then say, "Oh, well maybe we'd better put, you know, this in the cupboard" [LAUGH] you know, for --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's about it.  That's -- and, um, and we've talked about it.  What -- what are we going to do if the water shuts off or, you know, things like that?  We --
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's probably more in a talking stage than actually, um, really, you know, stockpiling things to do.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um --
R:  Right.  Well, --
L:  My husband has a fatalistic thing.  If an atomic bomb, um, drops, "Hey we don't need to worry about anything, we're gone" [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.  Well, my daughter will be ten in two weeks and we're try -- we don't want to make her all paranoid.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, you know, we -- we watch the news and we try and be aware but without tr- making her nervous and upset.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  Because the whole World Trade Center really affected her, too.
L:  Oh.
R:  We were supposed to go there that Christmas and take her up in there.  We had it all planned and everything.
L:  Oh, my goodness sake.
R:  Because we go to New York a lot.  My family's there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and all she knows is that her Uncle Joey and Aunt Beth work in the city and she always associated the World Trade Center with the city --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I had to be really 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- careful about, you know, explaining it to her and how much news we watched and everything.
L:  Do you do some explaining to her though that -- that there re- really is not that much to con- you know, worry and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- about the war and why the war, or something like that.
R:  And she asks questions.  She's just -- that's her.  She's -- I don't want to brag but she is very intelligent and so, she does ask questions but as long as she understands.  She's like it's just over there, right?  That it's not going to be here, she's okay with it.
L:  Uh-huh.  Okay.
R:  We just don't want her --
L:  I just wondered because that might be uppermost in my mind because I have a granddaughter --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- who's, uh -- who's seven --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, uh, so that's why I'm thinking, um, you know ...
