R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name's Wendy.
R:  Hi -- hi, I'm Carolyn.
L:  Hi, Carolyn, how are you? [LAUGH]
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  Good.
R:  This is my first call.
L:  Same here, so -- 
R:  Oh, okay, so we're both beginners.
L:  We'll be learning together here.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  What are we supposed to be talking about, education, um, com- --
R:  Computers in the school system and whether they -- are a good or a bad thing I guess. [LAUGH] Are you still there? Oh, --
L:  I'm sorry, I don't know what happened, it just -- it disappeared for a minute. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's okay.
L:  So what do you think as far as computers?  Do you think it --
R:  Um, well, um, I have a love hate relationship with my computer. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And my husband's computer, put it that way. 
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, I think they can be a very good source of information but I know they can also be used, um, in unproductive ways. [LAUGH] Um, --
L:  Absolutely.  Um, I've got some experience with my daughter using, um, educational programmes in themselves whereas she would learn, um, a lot quicker by playing a game or, um, it -- it -- maybe the -- the way the programme was presenting it or whatever, but a lot of times, um, in that sense, you know, being an educational programme, she's learned a lot quicker.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, other places in education, the only thing I can really see is maybe, um, oh, a glorified typewriter to be honest with you. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, -- that's really all I could really relate to anyway.
R:  Yeah.  Um, my -- my husband works in computers and he is just everywhere he goes, it -- you know.
L:  The obsession? 
R:  Yes, his -- that is his thing.  He does computers and it -- it [SIGH] -- I guess my -- if you're using it for information and stuff, that's great, but if you're just going to be playing computer games on it -- [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  -- for hours on end.
L:  That takes away from the family and it takes away from your -- your life as a person, you know what I mean? 
R:  Right, right, and I think -- I don't know if there's a way to instill that in children who are young. [LAUGH] But --
L:  [LAUGH] Right.  Well, I think it's, you know, almost on the same lines of -- as a TV.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It can be used for good.  There's times for it to be on and there's times for it to be off.
R:  Right.  I definitely agree with that. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I've got some hymn school friends that have, um, their curriculum all a hundred per cent computer based.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's a help in a way that it's all self directed.  Um, these kids can actually learn things on their own.  I mean, of course, there's adult, you know, interaction too.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, um, it grades everything.  It does everything for you and they're learning a lot more as opposed to looking at a text book.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, the visual in your face instead of I guess reading a text book.
R:  Yeah, I know. 
L:  It helps and it's not just games, it's reading and answering questions, you know what I mean? But --
R:  Yeah, different people learn in different ways -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, some people are much better.  Like, my mother in law, you can't just, like, sit her down with, like, a VCR and tell her how to work it, she has to read the whole manual.
L:  [LAUGH] Right. [LAUGH]
R:  Me, I'm just like, oh, I can figure it out all by myself. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's, like, if I run into a problem I'll look at the manual.  I'm very much more of a hands on type learner and so sometimes that can be, um, I mean, I guess you could use -- you can apply both of those with the computer, but, I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I can definitely understand the -- the obsession problem with them.  I've got a cousin who has -- her husband's in the same thing, -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, he works twenty four seven on computers.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He'll come home from work and then -- and there's a computer -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and it -- it will keep him away from helping with the kids or interacting with other activities that he should be involved in or whatever, but -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I can definitely see the downfall in that.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. But -- ah, --
L:  [NOISE] As far as education goes.  Um, I'm not really sure.  I mean, -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like you said, it depends on -- it depends on their learning capabilities and their ability to not want to just learn that -- I guess that certain way all the time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause there's things that you can do not on a computer. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Well, I think -- I mean, we're definitely in the computer age.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, right now, and I guess things like learning computer programming and different, you know, code based prog- programmes is a good thing but, I mean, they're things that we have to learn to do the old fashioned way, you know, like writing letters and, you know, -- 
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  -- handwriting things instead of just typing.  It's, ah, there's a lot of -- I mean, I know myself I'm, ah, I can accuse myself of that.  I'd much rather type an email to someone than having to write that letter and send it through the mail or something.  And -- 
L:  What's sad is I even procrastinate on that. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's awful. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, but, and -- and in some ways find that [MN] it also tends to make us very impatient people because we want it and we want it now, and the computers, ah, -- 
L:  You're right and as fast as a computer can go sometimes, -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's not fast enough and just instills that in us.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's right.
R:  Yeah, I spent two weeks over in Germany with my husband on a business trip and I was talking to, um, some of the people over there and because they're all very good at not speaking English and -- [LAUGH]
L:  That's always helpful.
R:  We're not so very good about speaking German. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, ah, one of the people pointed out that, well, we're talking about how slow things are over in Germany.  Like, if you go to a -- if you're planning on going out to eat at a restaurant, you take a good -- just plan for a good two hours because it takes forever for them to do anything.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  That's just because that's what we're used to over here, you know.  We've got ah, Walmart and McDon- -- I mean, they have McDonald's there too but we're just a very -- we want it and we want it now type of society, where over there, you know, you actually sit down and enjoy a meal.  You know, you have conversation before, during and after the meal and it's just more of a -- [LIPSMACK] a peaceful time as opposed to --
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  I've also heard and this has nothing to do with computers, I wonder if we'll get in trouble for this --
R:  Oops.
L:  [LAUGH] I've also heard that, um, in Europe, the portions of meals are smaller too.
R:  Um.
L:  Did -- did you notice that? 
R:  Um. 
L:  I have a lot to do with education and computers, but -- 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I didn't notice anything noticeable.  Um, I think it was relatively about the -- the same, but, yeah, I suppose we should get back to computers, huh? 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Attention please.  Um, let's see -- [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't think -- 
R:  Um.
L:  -- as far as education -- 
R:  I'm working on only a couple of hours of sleep so -- 
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- a few hours of sleep so my brain's not functioning as fast as it normally would [LAUGH], but, um, [LIPSMACK] mm, I guess I'm having a hard time really understanding what they use in the schools 'cause my children -- my eldest is going to be three in June.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And when I was in high school or when -- 
L:  All they had was programming. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly, I mean, we were so back -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- Windows, what was that, you know? And -- 
L:  Exactly.  We learned how to programme Basic --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which was Apple but where -- where is that now?  Nowhere.
R:  Exactly.
L:  But, yeah, I've got, um, a twelve year old and a lot of the programmes that we have, um, there's a -- one series of them that, um, just there's one -- they are fun programmes, they are not curriculum programmes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Where they, um, just per each grade, and they go overall the different basics, um, over and over again.  I even have one that my four and a half year old uses that helped him learn how to spell his name.
R:  Oh.
L:  His name is, oh, about ten letters long -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and he's already knows -- knows how to spell his first name.
R:  Wow.
L:  But, um, then on the other hand, it is an obsession for him because he just wants to play the computer all the time. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I have to cut that off and send him outside or give him, you know, do a distraction for him, get some type of distraction going because otherwise he would sit there all day, and it is educational but, you know, like you said, it's definitely [LAUGH] that addiction there is not good all the time.  You can't do just one thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Constantly.  Your life definitely isn't enriched by doing just one thing.  I know that -- that the programmes are different and the activities are different, but sitting there is definitely sedentary. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  My -- my husband was saying that he definitely has a white collar rear end.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause he's, you know, that's what he does all day, is sit in front of the computer and he does computer stuff and he looks like all he does is sit at a computer all day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, he's not, like, huge or anything, but he's --
L:  Well, it affects our -- our lives.  It affects our physical wellbeing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, when you get to that obsession part of it, it definitely affects our mental wellbeing too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, then you can also go I guess as far as, like, your social skills 'cause I know a lot of people -- well, maybe not a lot, but I know some people who, um, would definitely, ah, say that their social skills are lacking.
R:  Yeah.
L:  As far as interpersonal skills.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because all they're used to doing is -- is, um, communicating through email.
R:  Right.
L:  Or whatever.
R:  Or all -- they can only communicate in, ah, abbreviated, ah, -- 
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I did see an article on that one. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, L.O.L., L.O.L.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I've got a -- my daughter's friend is fourteen and she actually -- they actually have a little bit of their English class where they told them that they were not allowed to use these abbreviated words and they had all this list of abbreviated words. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Because they were writing a paper and apparently these kids were sticking them in their paper too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, no --
