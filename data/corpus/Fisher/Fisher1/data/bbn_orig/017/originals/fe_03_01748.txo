R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  [MN] Hi. 
R:  Hi, [MN] my name's Joyce. 
L:  Hi, Joyce, I'm Christine.
R:  Hi, Christine, how are you?
L:  I'm good, how are you doing?
R:  Doing good -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- where are you?
L:  I am in my kitchen making dinner as I am every time I get a call. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know what, I am doing the exact same [NOISE] thing.
L:  Really?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Isn't it hes--  [NOISE] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- can you hear [NOISE] my timer going off?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, well -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- there you go. 
R:  [COUGH] [MN] 
L:  All right, so, the question is do we think any, ah, if I heard it right, it kinda bleeped there did -- did it say, "Do we think that there are any foreign countries that are a threat to the US?"
R:  That -- that's what I heard too.
L:  Okay. 
R:  [MN] Well, -- 
R:  Do you wanna start?
R:  -- [MN] I -- I'll tell you right now, ah, you know, I still think that Iraq is a threat, um, until they have told me for sure they have found Saddam Hussein, I think he's a threat -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the same thing with Osama Bin Laden, but I also think Korea is a threat and unfortunately it's been thrown on the back burner right now and I think Syria because they keep -- you know, all the news reports I keep hearing are talking about how they helped smuggle people in -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that they might have helped Iraq through this whole mess, a- and those are the big ones that come to my mind.
L:  Well, I would have to agree with you on all those plus more. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, which -- really which ones?  
L:  Defin- well, for -- for instance, ah, China --
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  -- I think China's a major issue, um, I think that's why Korea is an issue is because China's an issue, it's a -- I mean they're such a big block and I think that's sort of like they're -- they're such a big, w- a- c- country that in some ways we're afraid to deal with them head on because they're so volatile -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and, you know, there's just [MN] -- there's all kinds of problems there.  I'm sure all the horrendous things that we're gonna end up hearing that Saddam was doing to his people, um, that and worse has happened to the people of China -- 
R:  [LIPSMACK] I think you're right -- 
L:  -- and, [MN] you know, when you don't have any basic fundamental value of life, then I think any -- com- any one who has that much power and does not have certain values, is gonna be a threat to the United States because we do have those values.  Not to say that we're perfect -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- but we have an -- an -- an intrinsic value of life, you know, whether y- I mean some people will probably argue that issue, you know, over the pro life issues and certainly there are thin-- things in our philosophy as a whole that, you know, sometimes show a little inconsistency, but basically in comparison with other civilizations and other times we're -- we have a value of life -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- and we have a sense of, you know, ah, decency that other countries [SIGH], ah, their philosophy doesn't have that.
R:  No, they don't, they don't -- 
L:  And they're always going to hate us -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- and they're -- they have a lot of mind control.  I mean the reason that the Middle East is such a wreck is because they've been hearing -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they don't ever get any -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- opposite points of view -- 
R:  No, they don't -- 
L:  -- there's some people that want -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- to pro- pro- propagate a certain, ah, point of view and, so, that's why they're so shocked when Saddam fell because they really believed everything that the I-- that they were hearing on Al Jazeera -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because they have nothing to compare it to and now [MN] they're in disarray and -- and they've been so brainwashed to just be against the United States that facts, you know, don't -- don't confuse them with facts.
R:  That's right, that's right.  
L:  They've already got -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- it and -- and, you know, that mentality is over in China, it's over in Korea.  That guy in Korea is a nut. 
R:  Yep, mhm, I agree -- 
L:  You know, these -- 
R:  -- totally.
L:  -- people are dying by the millions too. 
R:  [COUGH] But in -- in -- how many of them are induced deaths?  You know, I mean when you've got a population like that and they're -- they're killing baby girls simply by -- 
L:  Yep.
R:  -- virtue of their sex -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, no -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- I totally agree with you and I think the other thing is -- is, like, exactly like you said that you have so many people in these countries that -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- are not getting the facts -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- and unfortunately they're being, you know, they're being force fed this religion dogma and I mean I'm not knocking religion but there's a big difference -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- between religion and spirituality -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what -- what you see in a lot of these countries is -- is this organized business religion and -- and people that are living in abject poverty where -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- they have nothing else to live for and so -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- to die for a cause is glorious.
L:  Right.  Right.  
R:  And -- and when you -- when I see those little children on the television, especially in Iraq, my heart just breaks for them -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- because they never have a chance, b-- 
L:  No.  I mean [MN] the fact they were letting, what, a hundred and ten, hundred and thirty, ah, kids under [NOISE] the age of twelve [NOISE] between the ages of six and twelve were -- were released from prison -- 
R:  Isn't that -- 
L:  -- what were they doing in prison?
R:  Exactly.  
L:  [LAUGH] You know? [SIGH]
R:  What could they poss- I mean, you know, -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- here time out is a big deal but, you know, [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at that age to end up in prison -- 
L:  Right.  Well, -- 
R:  -- you know -- 
L:  -- it's just fear, I mean that's why they have -- I mean it just blows my mind how many, ah, Saddam statues and paintings and so that he gave them this feeling that he was watching and hearing every single thing they did --  
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- his picture was everywhere.
R:  [MN] Oh, yeah, it was just a -- like you said, psychological -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- manipulation -- 
L:  Exactly, and now -- 
R:  -- and -- 
L:  -- they're in disarray -- 
R:  Absolute disarray.  
L:  -- you know, and I understand that, I understand why they hate us -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- because they have never seen anything redeeming, they've been told all these terrible things -- 
R:  That's right.
L:  -- about, not just us, but the whole western world, the whole western so called philosophy -- 
R:  That's right.
L:  -- I mean they're -- they're just really filled with that for all these generations and it doesn't take too many generations to really steal away the hearts of -- of a country and -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- that's pretty much, you know, what's happened it seems to me.  So, I mean I think any other countries that don't have a certain level of freedom -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- are threats to the United States.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean -- 
R:  I -- 
L:  -- Russia was a threat before, I don't think they're so much of a threat but they could be if they keep lining up with -- with China, ah, you know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [MN] I mean we're just vulnerable.  We're at the top of the heap and that's, you know, everybody would like to shoot us off.
R:  That's right, that's right, and -- 
L:  So, -- 
R:  -- you know, unfortunately the very freedom that we covet and -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we would love to share with the rest of the world are the things that make us very vulnerable -- 
L:  I know, it's so crazy, I [MN] -- it -- it to us it just seems so ridiculous [NOISE] that people would be against [NOISE] freedom, you know?
R:  Mhm, absolutely -- 
L:  But my understanding is [NOISE] France is the word [NOISE] democracy --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which when we think of democracy we really mean a representative [NOISE] from it, but [NOISE] in -- I -- I guess in, ah, the [NOISE] Islamic, ah, language [NOISE] the word democracy doesn't translate well -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, it's sort of like anti God, independent of God -- 
R:  Right, right.  
L:  -- or something like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so, of course, because -- 
R:  Yep.  
L:  -- they're -- they're very religiously orientated, God orientated, um, [LIPSMACK] culture anything like that, I mean it's just, you know, language means so much, we know that here in the United States we're a little bit more [inaudible], you know, in business and ever- every language has changed a [NOISE] tremendous amount to change people's perceptions -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- and the language that we're using over there is not really very effective it doesn't seem to me.
R:  No, I -- I -- 
L:  We have, ah, -- 
R:  -- think that's very true -- 
L:  -- we haven't prepared -- and we haven't prepared and I think that's another thing, is we set ourselves up [MN] to be in this situation in some degree in I- Iraq because we didn't -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- prepare enough towards the intra- infrastructure issues that were going to arise as soon as the war was over -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- now, obviously that's cause we didn't realize how quick it was going to be -- 
R:  No, that's true, but it's still -- 
L:  -- but, ah, -- 
R:  -- something that we should have anticipated.
L:  I know it.  I -- I don't understand why it wasn't.  Why is it they're trying to decide now?  Why is it they just decided and sent that guy over there to -- to head up the reorganization -- 
R:  Right, the -- 
L:  -- they should -- 
R:  -- the -- they only thing -- 
L:  -- of had that person set up and ready to go -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- before they went to war. 
R:  Well, the only reason I think they -- they probably didn't, and -- an-- although I agree with you it should've been done is I'm wondering if -- if that might have been a fear of how it would have appeared to the rest of the world -- 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, it could -- 
R:  -- that not -- 
L:  -- be.
R:  -- only were we going -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to storm the country but, we -- you know -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we've already made -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- plans on how it's -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- going to run and -- as if -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they had -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- no say whatsoever.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  [NOISE] Well, and that's what they're afraid that they're not going to have any say, but frankly they're not educated enough [NOISE] yo- they can't make educated decisions -- 
R:  No, they don't.
L:  -- [NOISE] if it's left up to them, the last I heard [NOISE] and this is on NPR, so, I mean it wasn't like on a conservative channel or something -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they said that the Ir- the, um, [LIPSMACK] the Islamic countries -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- are wanting it -- I mean the Islamic people there, they want an Ayatollah.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  That's what they want, they want an Ayatollah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- now, there's Christians, you know, there's Catholics and all kinds of Christian religions -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- over there too, they want to have some representations -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- there's [NOISE] two different kinds of Islamics over [NOISE] there -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, so ... But you know what was interesting as I found out that Saddam's -- part of his philosophy, [LIPSMACK] was, to separate all the people groups -- 
R:  Oh -- 
L:  -- and so he taught them prejudice -- 
R:  Mhm, a [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  -- and so, now they have all these really polarized -- polarized view points of the other or- other kinds of belief systems and other gr- people groups -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because he made them separate and did not let them get to know each other and did not encourage any intermingling.  In fact, he encouraged a lack of intermingling that they all should -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- live in separate towns and se- separate areas -- 
R:  Mhm, yeah.  
L:  -- well, you know with that -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with that kind of background and that kind of education, how are they going to make a decision that's anywhere towards a representative government?
R:  That's right, that's right, and even if they -- they had any desire to try to break out of those groups, how can you do that living in poverty, you know, -- 
L:  Yeah, that's true.  
R:  -- that country's, you know, bi-- as -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- as big as the state of -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of California -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so, where on earth -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- are you going -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to go to -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- get to a town -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that's half way across the country?  You'll -- you'll never -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- get there.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah -- 
R:  And, you know --
