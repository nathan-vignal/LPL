R:  Hi, my name is Jim.  I'm from Indiana.
L:  I'm Melissa, I'm Il from Illinois.
R:  Okay, Melissa, this is the first time I've done this.  In fact, I just signed up this morning.  And I'm reading education, what do you think about computers in education.  Do they improve or harm education? 
L:  I think they improve it.
R:  So do I.  I've  I have, ah, five children.  Right now they're aged seventeen through twenty six, and the  ah, it's been amazing how positive the effects of computers have been for them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I remember when they were younger and they were contributing  or participating in science fairs, even in junior high and grade school 
L:  Mhm.
R:   and I used to say, well, the kids with the computers get the As and, and win the science fairs.  Because of, you know, the pretty graphics and the typed reports and all that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, my youngest now is a, a senior in high school and she's doing student teaching.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And  actually in the second grade, and she has more than one, like seven or eight second graders that know how to do Powerpoint presentations.
L:  Mm.
R:  And that just blows me away.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what do you think?
L:  Well, my kids are still, you know, kinda young and I do, I do think, ah, you know, computers, you know, definitely im- -- you know, improve education, you know, definitely helps it out.  I mean, my kids are what, eight and four.  So my youngest one's still too young, but my, my youngest one, you know, they work on computers at school and stuff, and, um, you know, he'll come home and tell me different sites that they've worked on, or that he's got to check his email and that he's got to check a dif you know, you know, check on a, check on a site or whatever.  And it, it fascinates me, you know, from when I was younger  you know, I'm twenty eight years old, and you know, from when I was younger and they didn't have them, you know, and as they slowly, you know, got the computers and everything, and it's just amazing.  It is.
R:  I would encourage you to, [NOISE] ah, keep that environment that you've created for your children 
L:  Mhm.
R:   because, um, you know, maybe  I just realized that with the grey hair I have on my head, but 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:   one of the  one of the best things you can do for your children is create environment.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And to make the fact that they are computer literate, and, ah, you know, they don't think computers are a big deal.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And that is such a gift to give to them, because, I mean, the world now is, is a world of computers 
L:  Yes, it is.
R:   just think what it's going to be like when they become, ah, adults in this world.
L:  Mhm.  One of my aunts that is  um, she's, I guess she's like forty eight years old, she wouldn't know the first thing about computers.  She wouldn't even know how to turn it on.  And she's just am she, she herself at forty eight years old is amazed at, you know, what the computers can do and stuff, because like she'll call me and she'll say, she'll say  well, like the other day she needed an address for a hospital or something in a different state, and I said, "Oh, I can look that up on the internet", and she goes, "You can?"  I said, "Yeah".  And she's been calling me, she says, "Can you look on the computer for such and such information?".  "Well, yeah".  And she wouldn't know the first thing about it, though.  It's kind of  it's neat, though.
R:  And that's what  that's the gift that you're giving to your children 
L:  Mhm.
R:   is that education.
L:  Yep.
R:  I can remember again when my seventeen year old daughter was, like, in the fifth grade, and she was doing  well, maybe you're a social studies teacher, but she had to do a report on Bolivia.
L:  Mhm.
R:  With, you know, gross national product and major imports and pol and population and all that.  And again she did it on, um, a computer presentation with pictures and, ah, movies and voice, and she took it in to school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you know, even the stereotype fifth grade boys, who couldn't care less about Bolivia's major exports, they were very interested, they paid attention, they even asked questions.  Now, these kids are getting hooked by, by learning, by the media that's being presented to them. [PAUSE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think the, um, the resources that these kids find out, like you said, um, literally to be able to go and access, ah, information that even our largest library could never even begin to, ah, to contain.
L:  Mhm.  I know with me, okay, like I said I'm, um, twenty eight and when I was in school and stuff, and they was just introducing the computers and stuff, and I am just fascinated with the computers and, you know, I've boughten all kinds of games for my kids to use on the computers that they can learn  that they can learn from, that I can sit down and, you know, learn with them and teach them, and computers just fascinate me.  They really do.
R:  And something that  something that I've learned and also read about is those games 
L:  Uh huh.
R:   are  those are really learning experiences.
L:  Yes, they are.
R:  I mean, again you're kind of tricking these kids because I'm sure your kids, they know what a mouse is, they know 
L:  Yep.
R:   where they  they know what a disk drive is 
L:  Yep.
R:   they know what a monitor is.  They don't know that they've been taking computer training while they've been playing.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And another thing that happened with these computers that just is a tremendous asset is, ah, when my oldest son showed up for, ah, let's see, he took typing as an  as a sophomore in high school 
L:  Mhm.
R:   and he could type ninety words a minute.  And you know where it came from?
L:  Hm.
R:  Playing computer games. [LAUGH]
L:  That's cool.
R:  'Cause he had not taking  you know, not one minute of, um, of typing training  
L:  Mhm.
R:   and it all came from just, um, playing computer games.
L:  That's cool.  I learned the old fashioned way, typewriting classes in high school.
R:  I still hunt and peck with two fingers now, but I think my  my experience on the computers have sped me up also.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think, um, I think it also, more than just the automation experience, and maybe even more than, than accessing all the information on line 
L:  Mhm.
R:   it trains their minds to be, to be problem solving and technically orientated.
L:  Yes, it does.
R:  Have you bought them laptops yet? [LAUGH]
L:  No, you know, my son's friend, um, my oldest son, he's eight, he's got a friend that's, like, ten or eleven years old that's got a laptop, and he brought  and it's an older one.  And I brought  he brought it over the other day, and I said, "Oh, my God, what is this?"  And I couldn't get the hang of it.  And maybe if it was a newer one, maybe so, I don't know.  I just, I think my son got more use out of it than I did, and it was kinda odd, you know, my son's eight years old.  And  soon to be nine in June.  And  but he got more use out of it than I.  I'm more with a desk top, I'm more familiar with all of it, you know, I'm not one for change or whatever, but you know, I've always found computers fascinated, but that laptop, that was a different challenge, you know.
R:  I've had the same experience.  I think the laptops, because they're, they have to be more compact 
L:  Mhm.
R:   there, ah, there are things  heck, I even have trouble turning one on.  You have to 
L:  I'm not even sure, I'm not even sure, I think the, the, the ten year old had to do it for me.  To turn it on, you know, and then I thought, "Well, where's the mouse", and he showed me this little button, and I said, "Ew, I don't like this", you know. [LAUGH] And it was just  it was different.
R:  And see, once again, this is something that I've learned just by being around, that, um, this is more education that you've given to your children.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just, just by, ah, giving them the environment, being  by allowing them to be around computers.  You've educated 
L:  Exactly.
R:   just by having it be there in your house.
L:  Yep.
R:  And you  and letting them have the access to it.
L:  Well, I've had the computer probably about three years now, um, I've been a stay at home mom for about three years, and I've had the computer  the computer was bought for the kids, um, you know, although Mom's on it all the time.  But, as far  you know, when I bought the  you know, yeah, we got the computer for the kids, you know, and we bought the games and the educational stuff for the kids, and it's like, this computer's gonna teach them  I mean, my son's got learning problems in school, and he's constantly, you know, wanting to play his games, and he, and he's learning from it, you know, he's really  he's learning and he's picking it all up and it's going in his brain, and I'm, I'm really happy about the internet, I really am.  Internet and education.
R:  Yeah, I found a long time ago, there's a company in  its headquartered some place in Silicon
