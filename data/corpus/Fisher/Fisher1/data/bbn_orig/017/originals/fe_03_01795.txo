R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  How weird.
R:  Yeah, this is weird. [LAUGH]
L:  Is this your first call?
R:  Yes, it is. [LAUGH]
L:  Mine too. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, my name's Jennifer.
L:  My name is Mick.
R:  Mick.  Hi, how you doing?
L:  I'm great, how are you today?
R:  I'm good.  What part of the country are you in?
L:  I'm in Texas.
R:  Hey, me too.
L:  Really, where?
R:  San Angelo.
L:  Shut up.  I used to live in San Angelo. [LAUGH]
R:  Really? [LAUGH]
L:  I'm in Austin now.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, but I went to college at ASU.
R:  Ahah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I get up to Austin once a month or so.
L:  Really?
R:  Yep.
L:  Yeah, it's a great place.  We like it here.
R:  It's pretty cool.
L:  So we're supposed to talk about computers in education.
R:  Right.
L:  You go first. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, do you have any kids?
L:  No, I don't.
R:  Okay.  'Cause I know that  I, I have four children, I've only got two that are in school right now.
L:  Yes.
R:  But I know that they go to, like, a computer lab slash class, what, at least once a week.
L:  Yes.
R:  And, I don't know, I think computers, everybody uses computer.  We got one, two, three, three of them here in the house.
L:  Yes.  Well, you know, do they  in school, I've always wondered this, do they teach the kids how to use computers, or do they just have computers available for the kids to use in their regular learning?
R:  Um, both, as far as I can see, right now.  They have what's called AR testing where they have to actually read a book, and then they take the test on the computer.
L:  Yes.
R:  But then they also get to  my son has made little, ah, little books with it, where he's actually had to type in the script and put the graphics and everything in it, and then print it out.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So he's actually creating.  I don't know what program they use, but 
L:  Right.
R:   he's actually creating that.
L:  Well that's nifty.
R:  As far as at home, he gets on the internet and stuff.
L:  Do they ever, like, ask you to have, like, a particular type of software on your computer at home so that  so that they could do homework on their computer at home from the same program as they use at school and that sort of thing?
R:  Not specifically.  Um, they have said he could type, you know, like for a science project and stuff he's used Word  
L:  Uh huh.
R:   for his science project, but it wasn't, you know, they didn't ask specifically for Word.
L:  Yeah.  Did they have computers when you went to school?
R:  Let me think. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I think some of our office, ah, courses had computers.  But it was more word processing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  As opposed to 
L:  My first experience with 
R:  [NOISE]
L:   computers was actually when I moved to San Angelo and started at Angelo State University.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And one of the first things I wanted to do was take a computer class, 'cause I had never touched one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'm in a wheelchair, and these days I have to use voice recognition with my computer  
R:  Okay.
L:   'cause I can't use the keyboard or the mouse.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I thank goodness that I learned enough then at ASU about computers that, that, you know, I was ready whenever it came time that I needed to use the voice recognition.
R:  Right.  So you actually feel comfortable enough now to use that, huh?
L:  Right, exactly.  And, and now, um, I'm retired from, from real work, but the work that I do at home I do on the computer using my voice recognition, and I do it because of the, you know, what I was able to learn when I was in college  
R:  Right.
L:   back then.
R:  Huh.
L:  So 
R:  That, that's true.
L:  I think it's  so you can see from my perspective then that, that computers are incredibly important and  in education. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I do think that I  I'm the type of person that believes that more technology is almost always better.
R:  Oh yeah.  Yeah, I took, um, I think my first computer course in my freshman year, and I don't remember doing that well on it. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  I think I got either a D or a C in the actual course.
L:  Yeah.  Where did you go?
R:  I went to Radford University in Virginia.
L:  I've heard of that.
R:  Probably.  It's near Tech 
L:  Uh huh.
R:   Virginia Tech.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  It's only a half hour from there.  But 
L:  In the, the work that, that I do now, we have, ah, we have people who represent our company all over the country 
R:  Right.
L:   and I think I've seen a resume where someone went to school there.
R:  Uh huh, okay.  Yeah, they're definitely important now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's good that the kids are actually using them in schools.  I know pretty much to go to college nowadays you have to have either a desk top or a laptop.
L:  Do you really?
R:  It seems to be.  Seems to be almost a requirement.
L:  I mean, I wouldn't want  if I had a kid I certainly wouldn't want to send them there without one, but 
R:  Right.
L:   but I didn't know that it was necessarily a requirement.
R:  I don't think they take, ah, handwritten papers anymore. [LAUGH]
L:  Are you kidding me?
R:  No, I do not think so.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  No, I think everything has to be typewritten, and I don't see a whole lot of typewriters in the, ah, library or anything.
L:  No. [LAUGH] No, our last typewriter wound up in the trash can not too many months ago.
R:  Exactly.
L:  There's no point in it now.
R:  Uh huh.
L:  Even most forms you had to fill out you can get on line now.
R:  Right.  See, we're in the military and half the stuff is downloadable forms  
L:  Yeah.
R:   that you can fill in.
L:  Yeah.  So, is, is Goodfellow Air Force Base still there?
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Well, I'll be.
R:  It's still here.  It's where my hubby's at right now.
L:  I had to, ah, um,  actually I believe one of my computer classes was on the base.
R:  Okay.
L:  'Cause at that time when we were going to school there, you know, they had some of the ASU classes on base 
R:  Mhm.
L:   and we had to go out there to actually take some classes.  I believe that I one.  It seemed like they had a computer lab out there, and that's where we took a class.
R:  Right.  See, that's another thing.  They give you basic training when you're in the military as far as computers, but you've pretty much got to either catch on really quick or you better know what you're doing before you get there.
L:  Right.  Several parents have told me that their best source of training for computers is their kids.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I've got an older type parent figure [LAUGH] that is calling me all the time from Abeline[?]  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:   to get help with the computer.
L:  [LAUGH] Are you from Abeline?
R:  I lived there for eighteen months at, ah, Dias[?].
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yes.
R:  So we kinda go everywhere.  I know that, um, we're going to Italy this summer, and if it weren't for email I'd have a real hard time keeping up with my family.
L:  I'll bet.  Yeah, I'll  I have a, a friend that, ah, that, ah, he had a professional job, and he just stopped all together and decided to become a truck driver.
R:  Wow.
L:  And that's the way he communicates with his family now, is through computers.
R:  Right.
L:  Through email.
R:  Yeah, it seems like the cellphones are getting more computerized as well.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  I have 
L:  But I think it's all good.
R:  Yeah, it's good to be able to just reach across and get in touch, and like you said, finding jobs and stuff on the internet, I do some mystery shopping and merchandising, and that's how I get my assignments.
L:  Did you find this listing on that thing that went out to everybody a couple of days ago?
R:  I found it on leidlers[?] lounge.
L:  Oh, okay.  I would just  you know, I'm on all the mailing lists for mystery shopping 
R:  Right.
L:   'cause my wife and I also do that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Occasionally, not that much, but just for fun.
R:  Yeah, I notice Sheryl Durban[?] sent one out.
L:  Yeah, that's the one I responded to.
R:  Okay.
L:  And that's how I got on this.
R:  Yep.
L:  And my first thought was, "I wonder if this is legitimate".
R:  Oh, of course. [LAUGH]
L:  And so I 
R:  It sounds weird. [LAUGH]
L:   I checked it out. [LAUGH] I was part of the University of Pennsylvania, so it's okay.
R:  Right.  I didn't even answer the phone yesterday, I figured it was telemarketing or something from the University of PA.
L:  The thing, it rang once yesterday, but it was gonna  it was about foreign affair 
R:  Mm, okay.
L:   foreign policy.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I just wasn't up to it yesterday.
R:  Right.  I thought it said, "Formulations" or something.
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  And I was like, "What?  How am I gonna talk ten minutes on formulations?" 
L:  Right, yeah. [LAUGH] But this is certainly interesting.
R:  Yeah, I think so.
L:  I read the web site about it, and apparently they're using  they're saving these files 
R:  Right.
L:   and they are using this information to develop, ah, you know, improvements in voice recognition and text to speech technology.
R:  Oh, great.
L:  Yeah, so I was really interested when I heard about that.
R:  Yeah, you  always want to help forward that kind of stuff then.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  That's your field.
L:  Absolutely.  I wonder when that eight minutes is coming. [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] There's only so much we can say.  Yeah, we agree, you know, 
L:  Exactly.
R:   it's a good step.  And we're surrounded by it daily, so, you can't get away from it.
L:  That's right.
R:  You know.  I'm even looking at getting a laptop so we can  when we travel this summer, you know, I can keep doing shops along the way, and 
L:  Yes.  Now that would be fun.
R:  So that's the next thing I'm learning, is wireless technology when you're travelling, you know, where can I plug it in.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I've gotta find out how to do that
