L:  Hello?
R:  Yes.
L:  Hi, my name is Sally.
R:  My name is Gene O'Donnell.  How you doing?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I'm good.
R:  Well, what countries do you feel, uh, may be threatening us?
L:  Mm, I think, um, later on, I think North K- -- we may have some trouble with North Korea.  [LIPSMACK] Um, [LIPSMACK] I think Iraq will [LAUGH] eventually get their things together and may try for another attack on us.  Um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I don't know, in ways I feel that, [SIGH] uh, Bush is -- is -- I don't know, i- is digging a hole, [LAUGH] a big hole for us.  So, in a way, we're [MN] I don't know.  I'm not --
R:  Well, he's certainly changed the way we establish law and order throughout the world.  If he decides that somebody's a threat --
L:  Send someone over there a- --
R:  -- and if he decides that somebody's a threat, we just go right in, no matter whether the United Nations says --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they are or not.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] last week when he was saying that Syria posed a -- a threat to our nation, uh, if I were a Syrian, I would have been frightened. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, we had three hundred thousand troops over there on their border, just waiting for Bush to say, "Attack".
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] you know another country that might -- might be giving us problems in the future could be, as you say, North Korea.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, they have, uh, their war [several inaudible words] --
L:  They have the equipment, the nuclear weapons, and --
R:  They're working on developing them and, um, unfortunately --
L:  Their army is crazy, like, army?  Doesn't even compare to ours, like, but, well, ours don't compare to theirs.  I don't know, it's just madness, and where will it all end?
R:  Well, you know, they have the Chinese sitting on their border, and the Chinese certainly don't want a country bordering them to have nuclear weapons.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So the Chinese will probably end up helping us out.  They're putting a lot of pressure on North Korea, but another particular problem with a country could be [NOISE] China itself, because China has refused to, [LIPSMACK] uh, fully cooperate with World Health Organizations regarding --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- SARS, you know, this disease, uh, this pneumonia that's circulating and, um, you know, if enough people get that disease over in China, you know, they have eight hundred million people over there, and [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] we're going to need their help in, uh, you know, controlling that disease, and --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- if China's not willing to cooperate, we're gonna have major --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- major problems.
L:  [NOISE] I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that disease.  Can you explain?
R:  Uh, SARS is a disease that, uh, started over in China and, um, people come down with s- uh, symptoms similar to pneumonia.
L:  Oh.
R:  And we've had, uh, [NOISE] about four hundred cases in China and [NOISE] in America, we've had about, um, sixty cases.  Out of sixty cases, there's been about, uh, twenty five deaths.
L:  Wow.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  When was this, um, discovered, this virus?  Like, how long has it been --
R:  Oh, it's probably --
L:  -- around?
R:  -- been sixty days.
L:  Sixty days?
R:  Sixty days ago it started.  Oh, yeah, it's, uh --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- epidemic proportions, and what happens is, um, [LIPSMACK] because China failed to notify the World Health Organization --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- uh, it got a foothold in the, uh, country over there, and of course Chinese are visiting Chinese and they come back to America --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and San Francisco and New York and, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- even here in Philadelphia, the, um, Chinese -- Chinatown and the Chinese restaurants are, uh, losing a lot of money, because people are not going to them, they're afraid of getting the disease.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  And it's communicable only through, uh, direct contact and, um, you know, when you have a country as -- as big as China, but a- also as backward --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as China, it presents, uh --
L:  A threat.
R:  -- problems, uh, almost as bad as nuclear weapons.  I mean, uh, they could --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- through not -- not controlling this illness, it could create significant problems and, um, although those problems aren't the same as the problems that North Korea --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- ha- you know, confronting us with, um, [LIPSMACK] they are major and significant problems and, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, we're -- we're facing a lot of situations like that.
L:  Mm.  Wow, interesting.  I had no idea --
R:  Well, in addition --
L:  -- about SARS.
R:  -- to, uh, in addition to, um, uh, Syria and -- and Ir- Iraq, you know, we still have to worry about, uh, Pakistan wherever we th- -- Afghanistan, wherever we think, uh, bin Laden might be hiding.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, he doesn't have an army, but he's got a following of devout people that, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- only goal in life is destroy our way of life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, you know, being unorganized and not an army, it's very difficult to track them down.
L:  Mhm.  Right, whatever happened to that?  It's, like, [LIPSMACK] I don't know. [LIPSMACK] The objectives have just shifted all of a sudden, you know what I'm saying?  First we were so --
R:  They shifted --
L:  -- persis- --
R:  -- right over to s- -- right over to Iran, didn't they?
L:  Right.
R:  What --
L:  We were so passionate about finding this bin Laden person and -- [LIPSMACK] and putting in the ads, his organization and then all of a sudden, [LIPSMACK] we're back on Iraq and it's like, an awareness so that Bush is trying to c- -- to finish -- resolve his father w-, you know, since [several inaudible words] and because, [LIPSMACK] it's to my understanding like, the relations between Iraq and the US have always, you know, been -- been somewhat shaky and we just gotta prove why -- approve of their -- their government and [LAUGH] who are we to try implement, I don't know, new policies and -- and try and -- and, I don't know, liberate a country, you know what I'm saying?
R:  I do s- -- I do, uh, wholeheartedly, I understand, you know, who -- who are we, as you say, to say w- -- you know, "They have a bad government, we're going to go in there and give 'em a good government". [SIGH] [LIPSMACK]
L:  Mm. [NOISE]
R:  You know, some of those people enjoy living like that.
L:  Hm.
R:  You know?  And, um, to just arbitrarily go in there and say, "Well, we think they have weapons of mass destruction.  We're going to go in and --" 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- attack them".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's, uh, it creates a chilling effect --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on every other country in the world and, uh --
L:  'Cause they're like, "Okay, when are -- when are we next?"  I mean, that's a question that can ask, you know?  [LIPSMACK] They posted up data about, um, [LIPSMACK] the number of countries who, uh, failed to allow UN inspectors in to check their like, weapons and, you know, there's -- [LAUGH] I forgot who was like, the leading country, but Iraq surely wasn't.  It -- it, you know, in --
R:  I think we're in there every day!
L:  Yeah.
R:  We were looking every day for, uh, for weapons.  They just, um, [MN] it's difficult to figure out what -- what happened there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, but they're looking for him too, they're looking all over this -- there's two guys hiding in a foxhole some place.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, bin Laden and, uh --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- and what's his name, who's the g- -- Saddam Hussein.  Those guys are hiding below the radar.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're in trouble if they find them.  But Hussein had everything, and he's a multi billionaire and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all he had to do was [NOISE] let -- I -- I guess just let some more people in there look around for weapons.  We haven't found any yet.
L:  Mm.
R:  A- and, um, I guess it doesn't matter if we find any, does it?
L:  Mm.
R:  Because we won.  You know, for, uh --
L:  I think the situation has gotten personal, [LIPSMACK] more of like, um, [LIPSMACK] "You better hand --"
R:  I -- I --
L:  "-- the [inaudible]" you know what I'm saying?
R:  I think you're right.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And, um --
R:  I think you're right.  I think it got personal.  And, you know, when you're watching the television and [LIPSMACK] you're seeing that, uh, you know, we were trying to use smart bombs and not destroy the city --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- only destroy the, uh, military installations.  Well, if I was over there fighting for America a- and I saw on television that Baghdad was still lit up at night with electricity, I'd be very upset.  I'd say, "Look, you know, I'm over here risking my life.  Why don't you guys go all out?  I wanna see that city leveled".
L:  Hm.
R:  I don't want -- I don't wanna hear somebody saying, "We're humanitarians, even in war, we're -- we're not knocking out the electric and we're --", hey, you know, i- if I'm over there with a rifle being shot [NOISE] at, I want everybody doing as much as they can --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to protect me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] And that's -- that's the way it should be, especially if, you know, if you're in the war fighting [inaudible] do. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I agree.
R:  It's, uh --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- it's a difficult situation, but I guess we'll, uh, we'll see what happens in the future with a lot of these -- these countries that pose problems to us, like you say, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, A- Afghanistan, any of those countries that, uh --
L:  And, yeah, the Middle East [LAUGH] in general, [LAUGH] um --
R:  And --
L:  -- and then, I -- I think since we -- we're zoning on this one particular area, this -- you know what I'm saying?  It's like we're forgetting about the other, you know, um, the other countries that -- that may have p- posed, like, past threats.  Because, you know, they could be planning, you know what I'm saying?  It's just, like, I don't know, it's just -- it's so passionate about just attacking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and -- and, you know what I'm saying?
