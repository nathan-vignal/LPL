L:  Hello?
R:  Hello, I'm Michael.
L:  Hi, I'm Wendy. [MN] 
R:  Hi, Wendy.  Where are you at?
L:  New York.  You?
R:  Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
L:  Oh, it's warm down there.
R:  It's beautiful down here.
L:  It's a little cold today. 
R:  How did you end up getting involved in this -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- this study?
L:  A friend of mine, ah, did it and he told me to do it.
R:  Okay.
L:  Unfortunately this is the topic I know nothing about. [MN] 
R:  Well, it's [NOISE] foreign relations -- 
L:  [MN] Yeah, I'm -- 
R:  -- you've never dated a foreigner?
L:  No. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] 
L:  [LAUGH] I got -- 
R:  It -- 
L:  -- that -- that's funny -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  "Do either of you consider any other countries to be a threat to US safety, if so, which countries and why?"
L:  Um, those countries that have nuclear weapons [LAUGH] because they can drop em on us at any time -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- and those countries that do not want to go along with UN policies I would [NOISE] say.  But I would like to hear what you have to say about that.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I'm afraid of the Middle Eastern, some of the far east, Korea with their nuclear policies now -- 
L:  [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  -- and of course the Middle East with, ah, Syria and the Iraq, Iran [NOISE] situation.
L:  [MN] I unfortunately know nothing about this, so -- 
R:  W- we just had a war with Iraq.
L:  I know that --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I'm not that ignorant but, ah, when it comes to politics, I, ah, take a back seat [MN] 
R:  Well, okay, are you a college student, or ...
L:  I'm a law student [MN] 
R:  How old are you?
L:  Twenty four.
R:  Okay, um, -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- well, that's a good reason, I guess, to ignore that kind of stuff. [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  Or avoid it is a better term.
L:  [MN] I just -- I, ah, just want to know about those things.
R:  Okay, so you don't discuss politics or religion? [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] No, I really -- I didn't say I didn't discuss religion -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I just don't discuss politics. 
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  [MN] But -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I mean -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I mean, ah, -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- yep, nuclear warfare is something to be afraid of, I mean it's not like it was in the old days and all they could do is just send people over with guns, now, you know, yo- one drop of a button an- they kill everybody.
R:  Well, that's the MAD policy, mutually assured destruction.
L:  Yes. [LAUGH] 
R:  So, that if there is anything nuclear happens we will retaliate -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- in kind and w- what will be the end of the eart- end of the earth.
L:  So, how could we retaliate in kind if we're already blown away?  [MN]
R:  We have silos and all that kind of stuff, don't we?
L:  I don't know. [MN]
R:  Oh, yeah -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- we have submarines that can blow up the earth, always at sea with missiles.
L:  But, wh- who -- doesn't there have to be someone to push the button?  [MN] 
R:  Ah, the President -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- the Vice President, or whoever --
L:  But if they already have nuclear attacked us those people are dead. [LAUGH] 
R:  We know they're coming.
L:  [MN] Ok-- 
R:  It's not th- it's not going to happen without -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- advanced warning, it may only be twenty minutes or an hour -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- but we st- we're going -- our -- our sophisticated electronics, or theirs -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- will detect launches.
L:  Mm, interesting.
R:  And we'll know missiles are coming at us and all the important people will go into shelters and leave us poor earthlings to perish.
L:  [MN] So, we retaliate, is that the answer?
R:  Pardon?
L:  Is retaliation the answer?
R:  Is retaliation the answer?
L:  Yes.
R:  Meeting f-, ah, force with like force?
L:  Yeah, well, I mean -- 
R:  Probably, otherwise you're making yourself a victim.
L:  But if we are already going to be dead it doesn't matter, why should we kill more people? [MN] 
R:  If I die, I want to take as many people with me as I can.
L:  Well, that's selfish. [MN] 
R:  Um, if somebody's going to try and murder me, they're coming with me.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, but, [MN] those innocent civilians and the country aren't -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- trying to murder you and they're the one -- 
R:  Well, I'm an innocent civilian.
L:  Well, yes, but it doesn't -- just because, you know, you as an innocent civilian has to die doesn't mean that other innocent civilian has to die -- unnecessarily. [MN] 
R:  Okay.
L:  [MN] 
R:  I'll give you a point for that.
L:  Thank you. [MN] 
R:  This is a very awkward study. [NOISE] 
L:  Yes, it is considering I knew -- picked topics that people know nothing about. [MN] 
R:  Um, -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- are you concerned about any other foreign countries?
L:  [MN] Mm, mm, Liberia, they're -- they're really bad -- bad people there.
R:  Why is that?
L:  Um, I'm joking.  I have n- no, I -- I don't really [MN] I don't really know anything about foreign politics.
R:  I'm pretty concerned about Liechtenstein myself.
L:  Why? [SIGH] 
R:  Well, because they control the world's wealth. [LAUGH] 
L:  I did not know that [MN] -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [MN] I thought that was the Swiss.
R:  It's a little country about sixty kilometers -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- sixty square kilometers inside Switzerland somewhere.
L:  Ah, see I was close the I -- I said Swiss [MN] 
R:  Okay, let's see what else can we meander off to -- 
L:  Is this almost ten minutes?
R:  I don't think so, I think we've been on the phone for about three. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, God.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, which countries and why?  Okay, are you afraid of Syria?
L:  I don't know anything enough about Syria to be afraid of them, but if tell me they're bad people, then I'm afraid of them.
R:  They're bad people.
L:  They're bad people.  So, I'm afraid, I'm very afraid.
R:  Okay.
L:  [MN] 
R:  I'm afraid that this Middle Eastern conflict is going to result in a world war.
L:  Nah, it's almost over. 
R:  The conflict itself, but now we have all the bickering with it -- oh, what about the French, how do you feel about them now?
L:  They can go shove it up their arses, but -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- [MN] they a- [MN] I'll never eat a french fry again [LAUGH] um, yeah, they just should have supported us and obviously we're in the right and ...
R:  Do you drink wine?
L:  No. 
R:  You don't have any wine in the house?
L:  No.
R:  Does your -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- boyfriend?
L:  Is that a way of insinuating, asking me if I have a boyfriend?
R:  Oh, I don't care, I'm much too old for you.
L:  Then w- what -- what does that have to do with anything? [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm just wondering whether he had any French wine?
L:  That -- that issue has nothing to do with anything. [MN] 
R:  Well, you just said, "You'd never eat french fries again".
L:  So, what does that have anything to do with a boyfriend?
R:  Okay, do any of your friends have French wine?
L:  I don't know. [MN] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]
R:  You need to visit and find out.
L:  Right, cause wine is -- is -- [inaudible] having wine is the answer to, ah, our political problems.
R:  So, you don't believe the French should be boycotted?
L:  You can't boy- it's -- it -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it would be too hard to boycott France --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and everything. 
R:  [NOISE] Do you think we should send them back the Statue of Liberty?
L:  No, because we built half of it. [MN] We built the base. [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.  So we can keep the base and send them the, ah, rest of her?
L:  No, that would be preposterous, that's just, like, -- anyone -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- who's [MN] -- is that your own --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- thought or people have been saying that because that's just, like, a ludicrous thing?
R:  [MN] Well, isn't it also a little bit ludicrous to say, "I'll never eat french fries again"?
L:  I was being sarcastic and by -- and they're freedom fries now anyway -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and french fries really don't come from France anyway, so ...
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I really don't think this is [LAUGH] what they want us to talk about -- 
R:  Well, hang on a little longer we will both be -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ten bucks richer. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  I'm just trying to keep the conversation going with something that the monitor is going to enjoy hearing.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Oh, so, should we stop wearing perfume too, is that what you're saying?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Should I stop wearing perfume too? [MN] 
R:  French perfume?
L:  Oh, I don't wear French perfume, but ...
R:  Then that's not an issue, is it?
L:  No.
R:  Do you understand why the French are being boycotted?
L:  Because they are arse holes and they didn't support us. [SIGH] 
R:  Okay.
L:  [MN] I'm not -- 
R:  How about all the aid that they provided to Iraq?
L:  Oh, I didn't know that.
R:  Or some of the trading that they were doing with Iraq -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and the fact that Iraq owes them -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- eight billion dollars.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] And the Russians also. [NOISE] 
L:  Well, the Russians have a bunch of bombs too -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  [NOISE] And?
L:  And -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that's not good. [MN] 
R:  Do you think the Russians may have sold some nuclear devices to the Middle East?
L:  R- right after they, ah, dissolved -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- probably.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] I mean they needed -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- money. [MN] 
R:  So, are you more afraid of the nuclear war or are you more afraid of the terrorist that has the nuclear weapon?
L:  Oh, isn't that like which came -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- first the chicken or the egg -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I mean -- 
R:  Pardon? [NOISE] 
L:  Isn't that just like who -- which came first the chicken or the egg?  I mean -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- one has the bomb and then the other thing is -- is the result of the person having the bomb, so -- 
R:  Well, no, cause the USA has thousands of bombs, Russians have thousands, the Chinese have thousands . 
L:  Right, but we're not going to use it unless it's diplomatic.  I mean these people in the Middle East are going to go off half cocked and --
