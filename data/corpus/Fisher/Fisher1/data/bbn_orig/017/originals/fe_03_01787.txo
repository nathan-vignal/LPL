L:  [MN] My name is Dawn Scharnagl, S.C.H.A.R.N.A.G.L.  Phone number's eight five six two nine six zero eight -- zero eight two eight.  Um, I believe, being a graduate of The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, um, having had a masters as well as a bachelors and, um, a second bachelors, um, I can see the difference between computerization in my education, which was most recent a masters, um, versus my original bachelors [NOISE] in nineteen eighty eight and I -- I think it made a world of difference.  Um, when I went back to school I felt as though I was a little out of -- out of touch and I [inaudible] can remember, um, having to go to the library and spend time there late, late, late at night.  Um, computerization certainly changed that.  I was able to go home and do all the research for -- and obtain the same information from the convenience of my home and, typically, as I was searching I would find maybe other topics or more information or other things of interest.  So, whereas if I were using paperback books in the library, I would only have learned about [MN] the one topic that I set out to learn.  So I think there is peripheral learning.  Um, I also believe that there is the ability to do a lot of virtual group settings, group meetings through the computer --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- via download, [LIPSMACK] ah, forwarding.  Um, it has enabled me in, ah, project teams to send my work to other students, have them edit it and send it back.  So I think that that was really good and we didn't have to [inaudible] together.  Um, so, in terms of education I think it improves.  Um, if someone wanted to not learn, I guess it could be a negative.  They could pull something off the Internet that's not copyrighted and turn it in as their own.  But, um, I would say for the most part my experience with the other students is that we used every bit of technology to our advantage.  Um, I think I actually wound up learning more about the subject that I was researching because I didn't -- in the library I would just get one or two pieces that allows you to have like in a little encapsulated view of, um, the topic and you might read it, you might not.  Um, you might just put it aside for later, but you've actually experienced, you know, how many hits in terms of the Internet and, ah, as far as computerization, um, just the fact that you have a cleaner copy.  Ah, spell check I think is -- maybe it does not do our society justice.  [LAUGH] I think it probably prevents, just like the math part, ah, people from learning how to spell because they rely on that.  Um, I also think that the math side, there -- there's a potential downside and [inaudible] think that in a lot of cases when I went to school, which would be, you know, right up until nineteen eighty four, you would do a lot of math in your head and I think now if you had to do percentages, I think the students of today are very reliant upon computerization.  Um, ... [PAUSE] 
R:  That was a lot, Dawn.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, was that a lot?  Was that ten minutes?  I didn't know --
R:  No, no, no. 
L:  I thought I was being record- -- 
R:  That wasn't ten minutes.  That was just a lot.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] You filled in a lot of time.  Um, my name is Colleen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, okay, let me just give you my input.  Um, my input would be -- now I -- I come from a -- a really different background because I'm a home school mom and I've taught my children at home, um, and I do agree.  I think -- I think computer literacy is absolutely essential, but I think that if -- [MN] depending on what we're talking about.  Now, you're talking about higher education and I think absolutely in higher education I -- I don't even know how people work or function without -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, without computers.  I mean, it's just -- you know, it's just [MN] such an asset.  I don't even see the liabilities, except for plagiarizing.  You mentioned plagiarizing --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and I can understand that that could be a problem.  But I think that that probably has always been a problem.  We could -- you know, you could find a book or you could find another, um, -- you know, you can find other written work that you could plagiarize and -- and probably, ah, get away with it, um, to a certain extent I think in college.  But, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think -- and -- and one of the things you mentioned was spell check, which I've -- I -- I'm a -- I'm a terrible speller, I'm just terrible, and I think that I have noticed in home schooling my children that some people have an aptitude for spelling and some people don't.  And I think --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- even with spellcheck, I think if you're the type of person that has an aptitude for spelling and you, um, are going to be a good speller, I think spell check then will enhance.  I don't think it becomes a crutch.  And I think for the people who are not good spellers, it's -- it's a needed crutch.  I think that, um, certainly I, you know -- even when my children didn't have aptitude for spelling, I drilled them on spelling words all the way up through high school even because of my own struggle with spelling.  I thought it was really important that they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at least get as much --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as they could.  But, um, -- but I do think that it -- you know, it's an excellent tool for people who have studied spelling, you know, throughout grade school and high school and still can't spell, [LAUGH] because there are some of us that, let's face it --
L:  Oh, it definitely allows you to go -- I mean, think about the students [inaudible] going back and using the dictionary [inaudible].
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, ...
R:  I mean, that -- that just is so consuming.  I think it discourages students, you know.  I mean, I know from myself and that prior to using t- computers I used to say to my kids if they would ask me how to spell something, because I was not a good speller, I would say to them, "Get the dictionary" and they did.  But now that they -- you know, once they got into high school --
L:  Oh, it teaches you how to spell the word if you use it enough and it keeps coming up.
R:  Exactly, exactly.  I think it's, like, almost the same as looking a word up.  It's -- and then, um, there are -- you know what, there are those times when you might think you're spelling something right and you would never think to look in the dictionary as a student, you know, a young student.  Um, but it shows you that you aren't right.  It's like that -- 
L:  Repet- repetition --
R:  -- instant correction.
L:  -- is really good.  I think if you do it enough times you will pick up on it.  If spell check picks it up every time, sometimes it's the only word, sometimes it's in a whole, you know, group of text, you may not remember it.  But, as you -- I think eventually you just get good at it.  You learn -- 
R:  I think so too.
L:  -- to spell the word, the common words. 
R:  I think so too.  And I think that it's almost like -- it's very much like instant, um, grading.  You know, when you grade somebody's paper right away and you say, "Got that wrong and that wrong and that wrong" and the student can automatically -- it's just automat- -- it -- it's -- it's very instantaneous, and -- and that I think reinforces learning, um, rather than down the road somebody looking at your paper and saying, "Well, you spelled that wrong" but, you know, it's been three days since you spelt it so you're -- you know, I think that --
L:  Yeah, you're right.
R:  -- instant correct- --
L:  Yeah, because you just did it.  I think in terms of math, though, I think it can be a little bit -- the computers can be downside, I really do.
R:  Now, what -- what -- what -- I mean, what is your feeling?  Why is that?
L:  Um, I think you're still forced to spell regardless of whether you're using a computer or not in everyday life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but you're not necessarily forced to add, ah, or subtract or do, you know, minor math.  It is -- it is different.  Um, I see a lot of -- like, it used to be crucial to figure out [MN], you know, just the basics.  Um, and I -- the reason I was so good at it and I'd go in a store with twenty percent off or if you ever look at the cashier who's behind the counter and she's bright, she's, you know, obviously in high school and can't figure out twenty percent, what's ten percent off, what's --
R:  Right.  Right, right, right.
L:  -- the tax -- you know, sales tax.  They struggle with that.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Um, which is something I didn't struggle with, but I see a lot more of that.  So I'm guess- --
R:  Yeah, you're probably right.  I guess I've never used it much at home for math.  Um, in home schooling my kids I've never used the computer really for math, except for math games and stuff like that just to supplement.  I've never used it for math curriculum.
L:  [NOISE] I think the calculator actually did it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  It did a whole generation and maybe that's not computerization, but the calculator did a lot of [inaudible], because I can figure that stuff out in my head, and I see they just look at you with a blank stare and I'm like, "You tell --"
R:  I know.
L:  "-- me you don't get this" and they don't.
R:  I know.  I know.  I think that that's true.  I think that's true, and that was another -- another thing that I never used with my kids until they got into higher algebra.  Then I allowed them to use the calculator to cut the time.  But, to me, it was essential --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that they knew how to do it, they knew how to figure this out --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- before they, you know, leaned on some other kind of technology, you know, to figure it out for them.  But, yeah, I think you're right.  [PAUSE]
L:  And whatever we did back then has worked for me today.  I don't know what that -- what I would be like -- well, I guess I got a taste of it.  I mean, it wasn't -- it's not long ago that I received my masters, um, but it was a shock initially.  [LAUGH] I was like, I remember the computer was a little bit of a frightening thing.  I'm like, okay --
