R:  Hi, my name's Erica.  I'm from California.
L:  Hi, Erica.  I'm Sam, I'm from Illinois.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  You too.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay --
L:  So, do you support what's going on over there?
R:  Um, yes, I do.  Um, I think that they have a different culture and, you know, different beliefs and different traditions, so we can't expect things to go as planned down there.  Um, they're -- they're -- they're not used to what -- what we're used to, they have different values, so it's going to take a lot of effort, and I think that, uh, well, go ahead, what do you think? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, no, go ahead and finish up what you're saying.  [NOISE]
R:  Okay.  And then also, um, I think that it is unnecessary that we're doing as much as -- as we are down there, but I think it's -- it's great that America does that, um, to try to --
L:  Why -- why do you think --
R:  -- restore the government.
L:  Why do you think it's unnecessary what we're doing as much as we're doing?
R:  Um, w- well, because we -- our primary was just to go after Saddam Hussein, but instead we are, um, going there and we -- we've made it into helping the people, which I think is wonderful, but you kn- -- you know, there's the argument that, "What about, you know, the home front and other countries?"  I mean -- 'cause we are spending a lot of money there.  But I fully support what they're doing, but they didn't have to go all out like that, but I really am happy and proud that they did.
L:  I see.  Well, I -- [LIPSMACK] I know they're different cultures and everything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I -- I think that the United States knows that, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I think that, uh, sometimes we've got to introduce other ideas, uh, to other cultures when -- when things are so bad in their country.  They have been ruled and brainwashed and everything else, you know?
R:  Right.  I think that --
L:  So --
R:  -- it will help if we introduce it but, you know, like new things, um, new ideas, sometimes they'll be rejected first and it'll take some time to sink in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so, I think peace will eventually come out of it, but you know, it may take a while. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Well --
R:  'Cause they already wanna have, like, another religious leader in there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they have the religious, you know, separations, the Sheiks or s- -- Shiites from the other -- from the Bath party and stuff. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I know, i- i- it's hard because, um, a lot of people are tossed.  My boyfriend and I are real tossed.  He's just totally against it over there altogether, you know, he just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- everything, "I want peace, I want peace, I want peace" and I go, "Well, yeah, we all want peace, you know?".
R:  Right.
L:  But we want peace for everybody, not just for us and --
R:  Is he -- is he anti war?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I have --
L:  He's very --
R:  -- the same thing with my boyfriend.  We've gotten in so many arguments about it that we had to stop talking about it.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's what's going on here, you know, and -- and I don't know if he thinks that I'm cruel or what.  No, I don't want to see people get hurt and killed from either side, you know?
R:  Yes, I agree.
L:  [MN] But, um --
R:  I think --
L:  -- I -- I can't stand by and watch our country be blown up and have to live in fear --
R:  Right.
L:  -- of, "When is it going to happen again?" because of some insane --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- person in another country, [NOISE] you know?
R:  Yeah, and I think that the end result that we're trying to achieve is peace, but sometimes -- I mean what were we -- what were we supposed to do with Saddam Hussein?  I mean, nothing else was working with him.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I -- I don't know.  I -- they say sometimes that maybe there is a different way to go about it but I think we're letting too much time passing by and letting him get away with too much a- -- with no result.  But --
L:  Well, yeah --
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- I -- my -- I agree wholeheartedly, and -- and one thing, you know, is when I heard that we went to war, the first thing I did was just sit down and cry, because I've got two eighteen year old boys and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the first -- one is crying, "Mom, I'm scared, I'm scared.  I'll get killed the first day over there if I'm drafted" [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, he's just a total wimp.
R:  Right.
L:  And his twin brother, just the opposite, is --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- "Oh, w- war, I gotta get down there and sign up.  I gotta get over there and fight for my country", you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And [MN] I know that when I was eighteen, I was married, and I thought I was all grown up and I was a woman and knew everything, you know?  And now I'm forty eight, and I look back and see my kids and they're just kids, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're -- they're not mentally, emotionally or physically developed enough to go over and be doing that sort of thing, and --
R:  I mean, I'm sure some of them have never, you know, been to another country before until now.  I mean, it's totally different and --
L:  Yeah, yeah --
R:  -- I -- it's --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- it's overwhelming, I'm sure, and --
L:   The training wasn't proper, you know, they're not trained proper enough to go over there.  Thank God we haven't lost a lot.
R:  Yeah, thank God for that.
L:  But, um -- 
R:  On both sides. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.
R:  Yeah.  And I guess people die over there every day.  I mean, the -- most of the country -- I think like seventy five percent of the country is actually, uh, uh, kids, people under eighteen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, maybe we're going to help give them more peace than they've had.  That would -- and that's what we want, and I would -- I'd be really proud if we could do that and I know we're trying, and I'm sure that it's sh- -- it's showing some good, so --
L:  Right.  Well, I pray every day, you know, that -- that there's peace, that settles quickly and [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that there can just be a meeting of the minds, and -- and, um, something that comes good out of it, you know?
R:  Yes.  Have they -- they --
L:  But --
R:  If you've ever -- have you ever talked to someone from, you know, one of those eastern, Middle Eastern countries?
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Our town is full of them.
R:  They -- yeah, they have, um, ah, such different traditions and values sometimes than [MN].
L:  But, you know, to talk to them, they're thankful to be out of there.
R:  That's true.  Or sometimes --
L:  They are thankful to be --
R:  -- they're upset because they had to leave, and they didn't want to leave.
L:  Right.  And --
R:  Because of the conditions down there.  So --
L:  And it's sad with what's going on with them here, because of the country that they're from, uh, many people, if they're business owners, their businesses have gone way down, and -- of course everybody's has, but theirs has s- seen a more drastic change, and the way that they're treated and looked upon, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, they can't help wh- who they were born to or where they were born.  It could be us just as easily as them, you know?  We're just fortunate that we were born American.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um --
R:  Come to think of it, it probably is our duty.  Once we go in there, I mean, are we supposed to leave them like that?  I mean, they need help, you know?
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  Those are people without water and food and the poverty.  I mean, we c- -- it is -- I guess it is our duty, when we see something like that, to help out, 'cause we can't leave them like that.
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  It's not -- it's not -- it's just not American, exactly [LAUGH] but I don't ...
L:  I don't think that we're trying to make them become American or give up their cultures or their --
R:  Right.
L:  -- beliefs, I think that we're just trying to help them see that there is light on the other end of the tunnel, and they do have choices that they can make.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, we're not there to give them bread, but teach them how to grow the wheat,   you know what I'm saying, to make their own bread?
R:  I -- I -- yeah, I -- I agree that we're -- we're not trying to, um, Americanize them or anything, but we're trying to help their government be more stable.  I mean, we took out the government, [LAUGH] you know, so --
L:  Right.  Now, how old are --
R:  So --
L:  -- is your boyfriend?  Is he at the age --
R:  He's --
L:  -- where he might go over there?
R:  -- he's twenty two.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I -- I don't think he would ever go over there. [LAUGH]
L:  Unless he was drafted?
R:  I -- I have some friends, um, I don't think any of them are over there.  Maybe -- I know one of them is, actually, um, and he was more of an acquaintance.  I look for him on TV, I haven't seen him, [LAUGH] but, um, yeah, it -- I don't think -- luckily we don't have to go through the draft.  I don't think we're going to have to, hopefully not.  Unless there's further problems with other countries.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Well, at first I thought we would, but I don't think we're going to now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think they've done a pretty good job of going in strong.  Once they made the decision to go, but I think the decision was delayed way too long --
R:  I agree.
L:  -- to go over there.  But I think they did go in strong and they made a good point right off the bat, and, um, they're trying.  I think, you know, I don't wanna just see it come into another [NOISE] political war like Vietnam.  That war --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- was so stupid.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, but yeah, I -- I think that -- I support it -- support it wholeheartedly, you know, I --
