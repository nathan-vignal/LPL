R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Angie.
L:  Oh, hi, Angie.  My name is Leslie.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Good -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- to meet to you.
R:  [MN] Okay.
L:  So, our topic is computers in education.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, --
L:  Well --
R:  Do you want to go first?
L:  No.  Go right ahead.
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know if I have too much to say -- well, I guess, um, I would have to say that it, um, would only be a good thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to, um, -- I can't remember if they -- if they're talking about any specific level of education, but I think at all levels of education that it would be good to incorporate computers.
L:  Ahah.  Okay.  Um, yeah, I guess I [MN] -- I feel that, um, yeah, computers are great, especially for research --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, in lieu of, um, -- well, the old way kids used to do it with encyclopedias and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, um, and -- but especially within the library having computers available --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think is very important, and at -- I think at the pre school and kindergarten level sometimes the kids aren't super interested, but I think they should still be available.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  I know kids get into the games and that kind of thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But sometimes I believe it's great to have the mind just be able to stimulate on its own, not have to have something to [MN] I guess trigger it.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Um, because it reminds me -- in some ways it's like TV.  You know, if you actually --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- watch somebody sit in front of a computer sometimes they ha- -- also have that glaze over their [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- over their eyes and I think it's -- it's good if, you know, -- probably there is some limit to its use --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in schools, you know, not hours and hours but --  
R:  Right.  I was thinking, um, in terms of, ah, -- I know what you are saying, um, about, um, -- in terms of, ah, [MN] um, not being able to -- or it might be better f- -- sometimes it might be better for a child to, um, do things outside of the computer in terms of developing their skills and imagination and so forth.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yes.
R:  I mean, I was also thinking about, um, ah, professional development or just making sure that they are, um, skilled in com- -- computers because, um, it's very basic -- I guess it now -- basic knowledge of computers is -- should be or is often taken for granted by employers or something.  So maybe, um, it would be good to make sure that, um, all children have access to that type of knowledge and skill.
L:  Mhm, mhm.  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Definitely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- I know that, um, -- I've heard that Bill Gates has provided a lot of computers to kids in some of the poor neighborhoods and he -- he supposedly has some big program going so that, you know, a- a- -- in all economic, you know, classes that it -- that it is something that's included.
R:  Right.  That's true.
L:  In the curriculum, but, yeah, I remember, um, when my daughter was in her kindergarten they had computers but the teacher, um, -- she was at a Montessori[?] -- told me that, honestly, kids never on their own [LAUGH] go over there. 
R:  Really?
L:  They didn't.  That -- she said, "They have so much to do here". 
R:  Mhm.
L:  There's other things, and that is not something that they -- they choose right off, you know, -- 
R:  It's true 'cause -- 
L:  -- sometimes we encourage -- 
R:  -- especially for young kids, they might not be able to sit still, you know.  They might want to do something more active and hands on.
L:  Right.  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And [MN] apparently there were so many choices offered that that just wasn't one of them that was high up on the list --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, and I thought that was interesting then. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  On their own they probably wouldn't have gone there first, but even that's at a pretty young age.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, but I agree with you in terms of, um, having it available, um, so that they can learn but not necessarily imposing it upon them, you know, --  
L:  Mhm.  
R:  -- at such an early age. 
L:  Yes, definitely.  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Because I know that some of the computer games get pretty addicting even for adults [LAUGH] and -- 
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- and it can be a big time waster.  I mean, I -- I think I've done my share of, you know, -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- Solitaire and some of the other games on there that just -- you can just do 'em over and over again --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and not realise how much time is going by and --
R:  Right, if you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- use the computer as a -- yeah, just -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- to be something to play video games on.
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, yeah, and then I wonder if -- I don't know how people do it but, um, -- when they want to block all of, like, the pornography and other sites, you know, so that their children can use it, um, --  
L:  Yes, mhm.
R:  If they can do that, I don't know.
L:  W- well, I believe so.  At the, um, -- in the schools they -- they have software that doesn't allow, ah, certain things to come up, and I know there was some controversy about public library systems --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, doing that.  Some people said that would -- that hampers, you know, freedom of information or --
R:  Right.
L:  I think that's what they were claiming, but to me there's just too much opportunity for kids, um, -- you know, anybody under eighteen -- to just get on and have different things popping up.
R:  Right.
L:  So I think some libraries at least have -- have done something to protect children --  
R:  Yeah, I wonder -- 
L:  -- [several inaudible words].  
R:  -- how they block those sites.  Um, --
L:  [MN] Well, there's software that you can download --  
R:  Really? 
L:  -- that will -- yeah, and I guess, you know, it picks up on -- on language and, you know, something like that --
R:  Images maybe.
L:  -- in order to give it a block, and you can even get it blocked from your email -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but I haven't actually done that -- I haven't downloaded that myself. 
R:  [NOISE] You know, one time I, um, -- I sent, like, an -- an email to, um, my adviser and, um, it autom- automatically got trashed because I think in the subject line the word offer was there.
L:  Oh! 
R:  And so [LAUGH] she found it, like, months later and she was like, "Oh, I'm so sorry" but she has, like, this automatic thing on her email that anything that has, like, specific words --
L:  Oh! 
R:  -- in the subject heading, yeah. 
L:  What was the word?
R:  It was offer.
L:  Huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Gosh.  That's an -- yeah, well, I guess it can go too far. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I had, um, -- well, I know this lady that's a -- a teacher at a public school, and she said she's using a really good site, um, for her science -- she teaches science -- I think it's seventh grade --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she has a great site that's, um, -- goes [MN] into all the migrations of all the different birds, um, -- you know, geese, hawks -- everything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and she's got her class involved in that and doing certain projects like tracking different migrations and seeing --  
R:  Mm.  
L:  -- where that particular species is right now and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they got into -- like, in February apparently it was mating season for owls --
R:  Oh! [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, and she had them out [MN] listening for owl calls, and on this site, of course, you know, they had -- you could -- if you had speakers you could hear what it might sound like, and kids were going out and doing this, and I thought, "Gosh, that's great".  I mean, she was really using it to the --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, to the full, and, um, I checked it out 'cause she said, "Oh, you oughta just look.  It's really interesting" and I did, and I thought that's an excellent use right there.
R:  Yeah, and it seems like if, um, com- -- if, um, teachers are going to use computers effectively in the classroom that there should be some type of training or development in terms of the teachers so that they know how to -- like, your friend does, um, --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- use it to its maximum, to the best benefit.
L:  Absolutely, yeah, and I don't know how she found that site or if it was -- I think it -- it may have been specifically developed for teachers and all, 'cause when I went on there, thinking back now, they did have a place for teachers to go to, the general public --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- kids, you know, so they'd, you know, give you the information at whatever level --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, you were seeking it.
R:  Yeah.  I remember the first time I touched a computer was in -- when I was a college undergraduate.
L:  R- -- oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- just thinking like, "Oh, this is weird, like, why can't -- why don't I just use my computer -- or my typewriter or something?"
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  [LAUGH] And, um, -- yeah, and borrowing -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- my friend's computer so I could go do some things.  I -- I remember -- and when email came out and stuff.  But now it's just, you know, [MN] like, prevalent in everyday life that --  
L:  I know.
R:  -- everyone needs to know.
L:  Yeah.  I know.  It's grown tremendously just in the last five years.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think I first went on the Internet in ninety seven.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ninety six?  Yeah, might've been ninety six, and, you know, a friend of mine had been talking about it for a couple of years, you know.  He knew all about it.  He was very up on that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, yeah, it was -- it was pretty interesting, and I think my nieces started having it, you know, when they first started school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, now they -- I mean, they're using it all the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- time.  They -- they know an awful lot 'cause they are learning younger and I think they are a lot more adept with the mouse --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than I thought they'd be. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, they have no problem, you know, with --
R:  Right, working the computer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's true.  And I was thinking about how, um, educators today might be of the older generation and might not, you know, really know how to use the computer in the classroom or ...  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I know some professors that just don't even use -- like, they only use it for email and that's it, you know.
L:  Oh, really?  Oh, gosh. 
R:  I guess inward processing -- 
L:  Huh. 
R:  -- but not like as a -- as a tool for teaching.
L:  Ahah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, no, I think it's got a lot of potential for -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- yeah, especially research and reports and things like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that, because you have so much more at your disposal.  You don't have to leave your house or you don't have to have your -- you know, your parents don't have to have bought you all these encyclopedias.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] Yeah, you've -- you've got something even bigger right there 'cause you can get into the Library of Congress and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know -- I mean, just worldwide you can tap into --
R:  Right.  I -- 
L:  -- so much.
R:  -- I'm teaching a class right now, and my students tot- -- like, for their class presentations we have a -- a m- --
