R:  [NOISE] Hi, my name's Tammy.
L:  Hi, I'm Melacca[?].  
R:  [NOISE] How are you?
L:  Good.
R:  [NOISE] Ah, have you done this a lot before, or is this one of your first times too? 
L:  This is my first time.
R:  Okay [LAUGH].  Um, actually I use -- I'm -- I'm do- -- I'm a stay at home mom.  I have two kids and, um, [NOISE] and I use the com- -- my computer a lot because I do -- I'm a student of Ashworth College. 
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] So I do home study.
L:  M- --  
R:  [NOISE] And, oh, god, it's such a help.
L:  Yes.  I thi- -- I don't know, I think, um, computers, although I don't really agree in television --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- a lot, I definitely, ah, agree using computers a lot because there's just so much -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- Internet connections that you can make.
R:  [NOISE] Right, definitely.  Um, see it's like -- I -- I don't know how other, ah, distance learning programs [inaudible] mine.  I go on, do my test, I get the results from my test the same day.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] Which is -- convenience is wonderful, and then it helps with research projects, [NOISE] you know.  The only downside is there's so much trouble you can get into with a computer.  [SIGH] 
L:  Like what?
R:  Ah, well, I was [NOISE] -- I was actually looking for, um, work at home programs and got sucked into something I didn't need to get sucked into.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] I've got customers now -- ah, clients of a company now coming after me because they never received their product.
L:  Huh.
R:  So y- -- it can [NOISE] -- it -- it -- it +definitely helps, but it can also be a major hindrance -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- 'cause there's just [NOISE] -- and, you know, I'm twenty three years old, so I'm --
L:  Right.
R:  Got that [NOISE] naivety still of, well, everybody's inherently good.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] And you can get sucked into so many scams that way.
L:  Yeah, but I definitely think that the -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- advantages outweigh the disadvantages because, um, just thinking if I -- i- if I was going to have kids and try to home school them, I could take them to different -- the different libraries around here.  There's the U Penn library that we could go to and --
R:  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  -- there's so many databases on the U Penn library site and so many different programs for --
R:  Oh, yeah, definitely. [NOISE] 
L:  -- kids in the free libraries.
R:  Definitely.  Um, and [NOISE] -- I mean, the only downs- -- the only real downside I see to even having computers at school is that the kids will tend to rush through their school work to get to the computer, you know, and may not be the quality that the teachers and the parents want out of the child, you know.  But, I mean, it c- -- it's got so many -- and, like you said, you know, benefits definitely outweigh the risks because there's so much more they can learn from it that they wouldn't have access to just by looking in a book.
L:  Right, and they might not necessarily, like, really take advantage of computer time in -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- schools because there -- computer access is so available now --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- and so readily accessible that it's not -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- as exciting as it once was.  It's more of +an everyday activity.
R:  Yeah, true, and it's -- it's hard to think of [NOISE] it that way, you know, 'cause g- -- and I remember elementary school, you know, you got like maybe an hour a week, you know.
L:  Mhm.  I'm twenty -- I'm twenty six and so, I mean -- and my brother is fifteen and he just --
R:  It's just all over the place anym- --
L:  -- was born on the computer.
R:  [NOISE] Right, right.
L:  You know, and his everyday activities and, you know, his everyday school work is --
R:  [NOISE] Life --  
L:  -- on the computer.  
R:  -- revolves around it. [NOISE] 
L:  It's not really +an issue anymore.  It's -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  -- more like a necessity almost.
R:  Oh, yeah.  [NOISE] It's -- and -- ugh, got tongue tied for a second.  [LAUGH] But th- -- you can learn so much more with it too.  I mean, you -- there's kids now that, god, they know more than most hackers do about computer programming, you know.
L:  Right, it -- yeah --
R:  [NOISE] And it's just from being on and familiarity.
L:  Right; and the other -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  The other good thing about it is there's international news that you can get at your fingertips.
R:  Oh, yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  Kids can use newspapers, but computers can be p- -- um, news can be posted, you know, every three minutes --  
R:  Immediately. [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know.  
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. 
L:  There can -- they -- kids can be in their schools and, um, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- learn, you know, different links and different articles and, you know -- by going onto independent media sites, and they're constantly updating their sites. 
R:  Right.  
L:  So you -- 
R:  [inaudible] [NOISE] 
L:  -- can, like, immediately have all the news in the world.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I [NOISE] -- there I think also that -- I mean, granted the Internet's a wonderful thing, but you gotta back it up with educational programs also, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] Um, because, I mean, there's so many pro- -- like tutoring programs that are geared even towards three year olds now, you know.  It's -- I bought my daughter the Reader Rabbit Program and she's fi- -- four, you know --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it -- it -- really it helps to build [NOISE] -- it start- -- it's a wonderful starting block because it starts out -- it starts them out with, like, your general word families and builds up from there, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] And it's -- i- -- it's a definite advantage because it helps them to learn things a little bit more +quickly and they are a little more prepared when [NOISE] they go into school because school now requires so much more than they did when we went to school, you know. 
L:  Yeah, and it requires a lot more, um, --
R:  Kids are required to [NOISE] know how to write their name, know their name, address, phone number by the time they start kindergarten now.
L:  Right.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  That's another thing: the whole job world is all computer literate.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know, not like it was -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- when -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, we are both in our twenties, so it really wasn't that way before it.  There was computers, but when we started, you know, you didn't necessarily have to be computer literate.
R:  Right, a- --  
L:  Once you get out of school you have to be computer literate.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah, [NOISE] the- -- there's so much more, like, they are expected to learn now 'cause society's just so technologically advanced now.
L:  Right.  I mean, no matter where you go, there's going to be some -- even in arts -- fine arts there's all types of art programs on the computer.
R:  Right, like TAD [NOISE] and stuff now.  Your engineering people have their computer aided drafting, you know.
L:  Right.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I mean -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- there's just too many things that are assisted by a computer.  I mean, it -- but, like you said, there should be supplemental programs besides computer work.
R:  [MN] [NOISE]  
L:  You know, definitely, you know -- 
R:  Well, now that's the one [NOISE] thing I think I -- I see people getting away from, you know, is a- all Internet and not so much programs anymore, you know, or if they have programs it's just games.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean -- [NOISE] and you can use your hard drive and your main system for so much more than Internet and games.
L:  Right.
R:  And I bought -- my husband's from Mexico.  He doesn't speak English real well, so I bought him the, um, -- the ESL instant American English, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] An- -- and you can use it to learn things other than having to be on the Net.  You can go on any time and just pop in the disk and you're there, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Which is a major convenience thing if you want to fork out forty, fifty bucks for a program sometimes, you know.
L:  Right.  That is very convenient.  And then there's [NOISE] free tutorials on the Web too.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah --
L:  Free --
R:  -- there's the -- [NOISE] what is it?  The video professors now.
L:  Free language tutorials, free science tutorials.  There's a bunch of different free tutorials on the Net.
R:  And learn [NOISE] to type stuff an- and it's -- it's a wonderf- -- it's a wonderful thing.  It's added -- it's added more things to learn than anything, you know.
L:  Right, exactly.  But then at the same time, you know, you definitely have to, um, keep -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- children, um, interested in reading -- 
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  Reading actual books, d- doing --  
R:  Writing. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- actual art, um, met- -- li- -- you know, helping them, you know, with work with their hands and with their, you know, bodies.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  
L:  And -- 
R:  That's the -- the one downside to typing, I think is that a lot of kids, especially ones that have sloppy handwriting, stay that way, you know --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because nobody bothers to work on [NOISE] their penmanship with them anymore because of computers.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] And you gotta -- you've gotta have clear writing, especially -- especially in work, depending on what you do, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] Like, if a child goes on to be an accountant and they've got these sloppy numbers, whose going to be able to read their reports, you know? 
L:  Right.
R:  And so -- [NOISE] I mean, you -- there's still a certain amount of manual work that has to be done that I think maybe the computer takes a little bit away from, you know.
L:  Right.  I mean, it is still sitting in front of a television, it's still sitting in front of a screen, where the messages are just being -- you know, it's still a +passive -- passive activity, you know. 
R:  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  There's a lot of information flow that's going through that you are getting a lot of stuff out, but it still is a passi- passive activity no matter --
R:  You don't have to put much effort [NOISE] forth to get it anymore.
L:  Right.  And so, I mean, definitely -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it should be supplemented with, um, all kinds of other activities, you know, and [LAUGH] going outside, doing outdoor activities, everything.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, my goodness, my four year old went outside yesterday and we let her play outside by herself for the first time, and she came in filthy.  [LAUGH] You know, and it's [NOISE] just -- and that's another thing, you know: you gotta make sure there's sufficient sunlight time, you know, [NOISE] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Right. 
R:  -- otherwise you'll have these kids that are [NOISE] white as a ghost because [LAUGH] they spend too much time either in front of the computer [NOISE] or just indoors in general, and that's only b- -- b- -- the real bad thing I see about it, that e- -- even the school system, period, anymore, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Kids have PE once a week now.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  
R:  A- -- [NOISE] 
L:  There's so many -- there's so many kids that, um, because it's such +an everyday activity and everyday, um, -- um, learning tool, computers, it's, um -- it's -- [MN] there's less -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- activity of other things.
R:  Almost contributes to child obesity problem, you know. [NOISE] 
L:  Right, and it contributes to, like, you know, also, like -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- interpersonal and social awareness --  
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah, definitely.  
L:  -- and -- 
R:  [NOISE] I think that's a lot of why there's more skids now in, like, ESE programs like, um, -- what the heck was it called?  EH for social personally[?], you know. 
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] And I -- I think that just the isolation's so much more, because in a lot of schools, yeah, they do group projects, but where are the group projects?  On the computer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] And it just -- it takes away so much, you know.  Ch- -- kids don't learn a -- they don't e- -- they don't learn their study skills anymore.  They don't learn their interaction really much anymore.
L:  Group participation --
R:  [NOISE] Exactly.
L:  -- inter- -- intrapersonal and interpersonal skills, you know, coordination of events and, you know, org- --
