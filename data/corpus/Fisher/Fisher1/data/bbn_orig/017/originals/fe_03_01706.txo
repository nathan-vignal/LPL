R:  Hi, my name's Tom and I'm in Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, okay, and my name is Mary, and I live in North Carolina.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Hello, Mary.
L:  How are ya?
R:  Good.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, let's see, uh ... yeah, I think, uh, North Korea could be a threat to the United States and, uh ...
L:  Ah --
R:  -- possibly Syria or another place in the mid, uh, mid Eastern --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- theater.
L:  Yeah, I believe so too.  I -- in fact, I, uh, probably Syria even first before North Korea, but North Korea certainly is, uh, is, uh, is a threat.  But, um, a- a- -- the thing that worries me, I just wonder how many countries we're going to get involved in over there.
R:  Ah, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right. [LAUGH] Right.  That -- it's, uh, it's kind of frightening but, um, [LIPSMACK] I know when I -- when I saw what was going in -- h- h- h- -- all the u- um, uproar in Syria, I thought, "Oh my Lord, [LAUGH] we're going to be involved in a -- in another country", but anyhow, it's, um, [LIPSMACK] it's frightening, that's for sure.  [SIGH] But thank God those, uh, POWs got to come home, that was -- that was great, having them come home.
R:  Sure it was.
L:  And I'd be glad to see them all come back soon. [LAUGH]
R:  Well --
L:  And how 'bout you?
R:  Uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm -- I'm actually amazed that they -- they are bringing some things back.  I mean, uh --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- couple of the aircraft carriers and all of their --
L:  Right.
R:  -- planes.
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, it just amazes me that, you know, [LAUGH] things went so well. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I know, yeah.  But, you know, really, when you think about it, they really didn't accomplish what they went over there for, right?  They went over after Saddam, and they went ou- over after all the, um, [LIPSMACK] chemicals and so on that he had.  I -- I don't think they've really, uh, u- u- um, been able to find that many, do you?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, not yet, but I mean, actually we're just using soldiers.  I mean, uh, [LIPSMACK] they say they have some training, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, I don't think it's in, uh ... specialized training in finding this stuff, I mean, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] I think if I had ten, twelve years to hide something and I had a big desert to do it in, I could do --
L:  Yeah, right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- it.  They -- they wouldn't find it.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Hey, that's a good way to look at it.
R:  Uh --
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  But supposedly, uh, just a couple of days ago, they got some -- I -- I don't think this was an individual they wanted to catch, but, uh, u- he apparently was in their scientific community and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he was saying that the -- they finally destroyed some of this stuff, you know, just a few days before our troops went into Iraq --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and, um, [LIPSMACK] I mean, I don't understand Saddam Hussein's rationale for not destroying it and documenting it and, you know, the whole +doggone thing would have been done with.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, [LIPSMACK] but, uh, [SIGH] I don't understand his thinking at all.
L:  Right.
R:  But I have been in -- in the Army once and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- was -- was in Vietnam and I understand that people in different parts of the world just don't think the way we do.
L:  Right, yeah, yeah.
R:  And, uh, I mean, it's -- about anything.
L:  Exactly, yeah. [COUGH]
R:  So, uh --
L:  Well, I guess that's what floored me, when I saw where the US was supposed to go over and help find out the proper folks for offices and so on for Iraq and I thought, "What are we doing there?  They don't want us to be handpicking who's going to run the country and who's going to do this.  They want their own folks that they wanna --"
R:  Well, that's true.  But, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we do have some experience at this.  I mean, you look at Japan --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you look at Germany --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, you look at South Korea.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Our military has done this before --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, you know, we -- and we don't stay.  I mean, we stayed in Europe because of the threat of Russia.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, but Europeans allowed us, I mean it --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- wasn't that they wanted us out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because we for -- a p- part of their economy by then.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But, uh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- um, [SIGH] we do have experience in building an infrastructure, not --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in, you know, el- electing people.  We have --
L:  Right.
R:  -- very bad experiences in that, uh --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- because we put Saddam Hussein in there.
L:  Yes.  Right, exactly, uh-huh.
R:  Uh, we --
L:  Not too --
R:  -- we don't pick too good.
L:  No, [LAUGH] right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  But --
L:  Well, that's, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, that's kind of a worry, that's for sure.  But anyhow, um, do you --
R:  But -- but I think -- I think it's necessary that, you know, six months, maybe even a year --
L:  That pe- -- a- -- that --
R:  -- that it's going to take that long for us to get, you know, railways running and, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- water distributed the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- way it should be and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- electricity and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sure it's going to take that long, yeah.  But you were in Vietnam, so you know exactly what was going on there, those, um --
R:  Well, s- see, that was a little different in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that that country didn't have anything.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  I mean, it was just bamboo huts --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- around a -- a -- a lake or something --
L:  Right.
R:  -- some -- some w- -- natural water source.
L:  Yes, yeah.
R:  So, you know, uh --
L:  That makes a big difference.
R:  They -- they didn't know what electricity was. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Um, uh-huh, yeah.  Have you ever been back?
R:  No.
L:  No?
R:  No.
L:  Would you ever want to go back there?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Ah, well, I always wanted to see a place called Vong Cau.  I mean, it was sup- supposed to be so beautiful. [MN] The French used it as, like, their F- French Riviera --
L:  Oh, wonderful.
R:  When -- when Vietnam was a colony of France.
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh, m- -- except this was, you know, not all beach, I mean i- it was, um, [LIPSMACK] a warm rainforest --
L:  Oh, wonderful.
R:  -- you know, and it was supposed to be so beautiful and, I mean, the Vietnamese people are friendly enough, I mean, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh --
L:  And --
R:  As long as you weren't shooting at 'em. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, right, uh-huh, yeah.  Well, they've sure, um [LIPSMACK] we -- we sure have quite a few of them here in the Carolinas that [SIGH] have come and have been quite successful and so on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I'm sure you have a lot of them up there in Pennsylvania.  Don't they have a lot --
R:  No, we -- we got Syrians and Puerto Ricans. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, uh, oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, I --
L:  That's intr- --
R:  -- I think the Vietnamese were, you know, fairly smart in -- when -- when they had the ability to come to this country, that, uh, they knew not to go to the northern climates --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- 'cause it would be too cold for 'em.
L:  Right, yeah, yeah.
R:  And -- and, you know, uh, uh, a lot of 'em went places where there were some sort of fishing industry, because half their population were just fishermen.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, [MN] so I know a lot of them went to Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  To fish in the Gulf.
L:  Yes, yeah.  Well, we've had quite an influx here, and, um, a- as far as the women are concerned, most of them have opened, um, little manicure shops --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you go in there and they're, like, five and six, um, and usually they're all related to one another --
R:  Right.
L:  And, um --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- but they do a very nice job, they, um, and make a living at it, and, uh, they seem to, um, [LIPSMACK], uh, you know, do their best and I think, um, you know, it was wonderful that they were able to find employment and so on, and most of them are, um, [LIPSMACK] great workers.  Um, I was working one time in a place where, uh, they had hired a fella in a restaurant and this, uh, gentleman called and he said, "What is the word for stop?" and I said, "I really don't know" and he said, "Well, we hired this fellow to make hamburgers" and he said, "I left him alone for two hours and I had hamburgers up and down --
R:  "And coming out my ears". [LAUGH]
L:  -- the aisles" and he said, "I don't know what to say".  I said, "Well, just use your hands, just use your hands and say, 'Uh-uh', you know?" [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, no more. [LAUGH]
L:  But anyhow, um, the gentleman was, uh, thrilled to pieces.  He said, "You know, we're just not used to people working like this", but anyhow, [LIPSMACK], yeah.
R:  But -- but ever -- every immigrant society that this country's ever brought in --
L:  Has --
R:  -- were like that for at least a few generations.
L:  Yes, true, mhm.
R:  You know, Irish --
L:  Y- --
R:  -- uh, uh, the Polish.
L:  Right, Italians.
R:  Italians, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean --
L:  Right, yeah, uh-huh.
R:  Just that --
L:  Yeah, a- --
R:  -- our, uh, society isn't used to, uh, well, I mean, segments of the society aren't used to it, but --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- when they've been established in an area for a while and everybody forgets that, you know, their ancestors came from somewhere else. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, true, that's for sure.  Yeah, they didn't all just happen to be here. [LAUGH]
R:  That's right. 
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean --
L:  So, anyhow --
R:  -- it took hundreds of years but, I mean, it -- that -- that is the truth, I mean, even what they call the native Am- Americans, they now think that they, you know, actually came from places like Russia, and places like that.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And -- and walked across the land bridge.
L:  Oh, all right.
R:  Uh --
L:  Oh, I -- I hadn't heard that, yeah.
R:  Yeah, but -- but they don't even think that the native Americans or -- or Indians --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- uh --
L:  What a- --
R:  -- originated here.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah --
