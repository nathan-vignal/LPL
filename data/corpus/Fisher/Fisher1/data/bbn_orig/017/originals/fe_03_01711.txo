R:  Hi, I'm Beth.
L:  [NOISE] I'm Anita.
R:  Hi. [SIGH]
L:  How are you?
R:  Oh, pretty good.  M- I'm in Fort Worth, Texas.
L:  [NOISE] Okay, I'm in, uh, New Jersey. [LAUGH]
R:  New Jersey? 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Oh.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, topic w- -- ah, do we consider any other countries to be a threat?
L:  I do.  [MN]
R:  Uh, yes, I do. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Which ones for you?
R:  Oh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all the --
L:  Or if it's more than one? [MN]
R:  -- Arab nations.  All of them are -- all the Arab nations --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and [SIGH] China probably, uh --
L:  I -- I definitely see North Korea.
R:  Right.
L:  And -- and probably India.
R:  I'm not so sure about India, but possibly.
L:  Because they have them -- they all have the nuclear capabilities.
R:  Yes, but they don't hate us as much [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] True. [LAUGH]
R:  -- as the other countries do. [LAUGH]
L:  At least not yet, right?
R:  Right, right, right.  Um --
L:  I think the other ones are more of a threat to countries more close around them --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as opposed to ... as opposed to necessarily us.
R:  Mhm.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  I would agree with that.  They do have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a few terrorists these days, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they never used to be that way, they were always such a peaceful country.
L:  True. [NOISE]
R:  But I think all the Third World type countries are looking towards that as a solution. [SIGH]
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] Yeah, unfortunately, [NOISE] peace isn't the way now, right? [NOISE]
R:  Pardon me?
L:  [NOISE] I said, unfortunately, nowadays peace isn't the way [LAUGH].
R:  No, huh-uh.
L:  It's whoever's, you know, has the biggest and strongest weapons.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Unfortunately.
R:  Why do you think that is?
L:  Um, I guess just because it's so controlling and so powerful, of a -- of a, you know, concept that you can hold over people's heads, you know, by saying, you know --
R:  Have the bomb.
L:  -- "You -- you step over the boundaries, this is what I have and I can use it".
R:  Yeah.  Well, from what the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some of the people that I know around here --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it's -- it's, like, territorial, they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- running out of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some of them have been out of space --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- for a long time --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it's more that th- they just don't have enough space literally to live in. [SIGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so it's -- there's no more frontiers to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] w- --
L:  [NOISE] But I think that, you know, uh, you know, Saddam [NOISE] was the perfect example of, you know, how to ruin a country in --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, was it twenty, twenty five years that he was in --
R:  Um --
L:  -- in power?  In --
R:  Close to thirty, I think.
L:  Yeah, I mean, that's absolutely awful that he could, you know, turn around a nation so bad.
R:  Mm.
L:  In that span of time.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  And take so much from -- from, you know, his people.
R:  Right.  I could unders- s- s- -- I can understand the looters. [SIGH]
L:  Oh, definitely, me too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Not that -- that -- I don't understand the ones that are going into the hospitals and taking everything from there. [NOISE] That I don't [NOISE] --
R:  I don't understand that either --
L:  -- [NOISE] I don't agree with that.
R:  -- they're just kind of in a frenzy, probably.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I agree going into his palaces and stuff and doing it like that, but not ...
R:  Like, in Saudi Arabia, they all get money from their oilfields.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  They don't -- it doesn't go to the politicians.  It goes -- well, sure --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as plenty of it does [LAUGH] --   
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  -- but -- but every- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- everyone over there benefits from --
L:  [NOISE] This --
R:  -- the oil income, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Be good f- -- I -- I think they'll be a pretty good example for Iraq, to try to emulate there in the future, when they're ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  If and when we resettle.
L:  I know, I think that's scary too. [LAUGH] But I think the whole -- I mean, who -- you never know, who knows, this whole SARS thing, [LAUGH] it [LAUGH] --
R:  Makes you wonder, doesn't it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because it's right over there.
L:  I mean, you know, if s- somebody can crash an airplane in, why can't they, you know, open up a new virus?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's true.
L:  It certainly -- certainly would be a scary, uh, outcome if that's what it was.
R:  I imagine that's something that is being considered.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, you wake up and hear the news that they might have to quarantine Toronto, I mean, that's scary. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] I didn't -- w- -- I didn't see that part. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it was either on CNN or MSNBC, and they're saying that Toronto has like, this hu- -- tremendous outbreak --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- all of a sudden.
R:  Wow.
L:  Great. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, we don't have to watch people just coming from, you know, China, now we gotta watch people coming from Toronto.
R:  Wow.  That's amazing, yeah.  I wouldn't be too surprised if that was something, [SIGH] germ warfare of some sort.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it was done in China, how many years ago?  Was it, like, three or four years ago now, that they put it in the subway system?
R:  [MN] Was it China?  I was thinking it was Japan.
L:  Yeah, okay. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, uh, well [LAUGH] I lose track.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm s- --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm shocked that I -- that I -- when I realize that the Ranch[?] Davinians[?] was ten years ago and all that.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I saw that on the news the o- -- what was it, last week?
R:  Sure sign I'm getting old. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] One sure sign is that, uh, the world is so, [SIGH] you know, having such other big, awful topics that those --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just become, you know, part of history, which is a -- scary to think.
R:  Right.  So, [SIGH] yeah.  Uh, are you -- are you -- are you very s- -- worried, stressed out about, uh, terrorist activities or other --
L:  I wouldn't say stressed out, you know?  I mean, I -- I can sleep fine --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, if something like nine eleven happens again, you know, especially being in Jersey, if it happened that close again, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, [SIGH] concerned, yes, worried, not yet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I would have to say no.  What about you?
R:  I was a little concerned, but I just figured that if they do that -- anything like that to us, we're not going to have that much -- [LAUGH] you know, y- y- you remember when they were talking about putting plas- -- getting sheets of plastic and duct tape and [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- I mean, uh, I just --
L:  That was a joke. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH].  The only --
L:   Well, but let's see, you wouldn't be able to flush the toilet, 'cause that would let air in. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you couldn't breathe --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- after a while, 'cause you [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, that's the truth.
R:  So --
L:  I was saying to my husband, like, you know, like, "God forbid something was to happen that would be that awful".  I'd just want to be with my son and my husband, you know, when it does happen.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, just be surrounded by the ones that you care about.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I agree. [SIGH]
L:  If that is that much of a settling thought, you know? [LAUGH] Not that you want to think about that, either.
R:  Well, you kinda have to when you go through those things.  I expected all that to happen --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- right after nine eleven.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when I was really terrified.  I [SIGH] was going to college and, uh, I'm in Fort Worth, and there's a big, uh, train switching station --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- what you call it?  Forget what you call it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] Huge, and it was right over -- under --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- had to go o- o- over that every day --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- twice a day --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- going and coming --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, uh, I was terrified that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- one of these times was going to be going over it and there was going to be something explode, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Big -- big, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- hub for all the train traffic.
L:  Yeah, that's scary. [NOISE] My -- my father works, you know, in New York City, so we were freaking out that day.  My stepmother just freaks out every day that he goes to work.  Sh- she wants him to get, like, full body armor.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Like, that's not going to save him.
R:  Oh.
L:  But, no, nine eleven, we were actually bringing my son to the hospital for something, and it was just, like, everybody was running around saying, [NOISE] you know, "We have to clear the way.  They're going to start bringing them over here".  It was just, like, you know, "Just check my son and we'll get out of your hair". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, it was a scary day.
R:  I'll bet.  Oh, I can imagine.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yes, we were afraid.
L:  Yeah, we were driving down the highway, like, "Wow, look at that cloud" and then it's, like, "That's not a cloud". [LAUGH]
R:  You were that close you could see it?  Ew.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  My stepmother and my father, they live right across the -- the river, and their, uh, their apartment was like, filthy from it.
R:  Ew.
L:  You know, like, weeks and months later, it was just, ugh.  Just --
R:  Black and gray, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What you think is dust really isn't. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hopefully that won't ever happen again anywhere.
R:  Hopefully.  Uh, I'm glad they kind of kept their heads --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- back then, and [SIGH] ...
L:  Yeah, that is the truth.
R:  I -- I kind of wonder if they're going to, uh [PAUSE] other countries retaliate for us going over to Iraq, you know?
L:  I don't know.  I mean, hopefully, I mean, it's not to say that I would want them to do this, but I mean, hopefully they'll find something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, maybe they'll find a warhead, something, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that way everybody can kind of be -- everybody in America can ki- -- can kind of be, like, "See?  This is why we went in.  There was stuff".
R:  Oh there's ... [MN] they haven't found exactly what they were looking for so far, but they found plenty of weapons, so --
L:  Yeah, yeah, they found some, but it's not, like, you know, the one big one where they can say, [NOISE] you know, "Told you so". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  Get the French off our back. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, they're ve- -- I'm sure they'll go over it with a fine tooth comb if --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it can be found, they'll get it.  Do you think, uh, Saddam got -- we actually got Saddam?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I really hope so.  I really hope he's not with bin Laden in some cave, [LAUGH] and come out next year or something.  I really hope not.
R:  Yeah.  That's the one thing I was hoping when they did --
L:  Those are two people in the world I hope are dead. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] In a really painful way. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] Not that I'd ever wish that on anybody, but those two are the ones.
R:  Yeah, and s- -- when -- when we actually went to war, that's what I thought, you know?  As long as they're over there they might --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  I want them to do it what they're going  --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for.  And --
L:  And I hope they do, like, you know, dental records or DNA records on that, you know, on the records that they blew up --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just to find out if he really is dead, Saddam.
R:  Find s- some positive proof that he's gone.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hopefully.
R:  I've got -- I live in a part
