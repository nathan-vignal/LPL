R:  Jason. [NOISE]
L:  Tonya.
R:  [COUGH] [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are ya? [LAUGH]
L:  I'm good. [LAUGH]
R:  Doing good.
L:  This is my first call, so ...
R:  My first time call, okay.
L:  Okay.  So, um, what country I feel is a threat --
R:  I --
L:  -- uh, I feel the biggest threat to us is us, personally.
R:  [NOISE] Us?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH] I --
L:  I feel that if the United States would mind their business and stay out of other people's business, we wouldn't have the problems that we have.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  You know, we're at war now, and we're going through what we go through now because the United States just can't stay out of other people's business.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  I think now it's Syria though, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think they're a big threat.
L:  Definitely.
R:  [MN] Since they're on I- Iraq's side though, the -- you know, the whole time and against us, so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  [COUGH] the whole thing is pretty much a mess, huh? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I think it is, at this point.
R:  And we're losing people for nothing, you know?
L:  Yeah, I think we are.  I think that, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, our guys have gone out there.  I mean, definitely he had to be taken out of power because of, uh, what was going on out there, but --
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah, I mean, I think it could have been handled a little differently, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know? [NOISE]
R:  [COUGH] Yeah, I don't -- I don't believe in war at all either, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Especially -- I have friends in the Marines and two of them got c- --
L:  Yeah, definitely, me too.
R:  --  yeah, two of them are over there, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah, I'm not for the war at all. [NOISE]  Any type of violence I'm not into.
L:  Yeah.  I feel the same way completely.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  [COUGH] How much longer you think we'll be over there for?
L:  Um, I think it's definitely going to be at least a couple more months.
R:  A couple of months at least?
L:  I'm not e- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm not -- I'm not really sure, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hopefully it won't go more than that.  Hopefully it'll just be, you know, two, three more months, and our guys will get out of there and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, they'll try to rebuild that country or do whatever they're going to do over there.  I just hope that it teaches the United States a lesson, you know?  Okay, fine, we got this done, but we should really, you know, think a little more --
R:  [NOISE] So this doesn't ha- --
L:  -- before we do this again, you know?
R:  Yeah, plus the fact that's it's costing billions, you know?
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  The money that's cost us, just to, you know?
L:  Mhm.  And it will cost us billions because we decided to do it, you know, and it's the country who takes over who's gotta, you know --
R:  -- pay for them to now rebuild and --
R:  [COUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- and things, so [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH]
L:  -- hopefully, you know, it doesn't cost us too much more, and hopefully, after this is over, like I said, you know, we won't have as many problems.  But, I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's not even only them, you know, there's war in Japan and --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- and Korea and -- you know? [LAUGH] And I've got, you know, family over there too.
R:  Oh, yeah? [NOISE]
L:  So, yeah, definitely.
R:  I think the biggest problem is I think every country's jealous of us.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  They're all jealous, and they all want to be us and they can't.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  We have everything, and they don't have -- those countries that don't have anything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [COUGH] That's why everybody --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- wants to come over here, too.  Come over here --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- for a better life.
L:  Well, hopefully, you know, they get a better life and, you know --
R:  Than they have now, yeah.
L:  -- they can -- yeah, they can fend for themselves and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they can take care of themselves, and hopefully after we help them, they no longer believe that we're the enemy.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, 'cause that's also another big thing that threatens our country.
R:  And one big thing is that -- I totally disagree with is, I mean, you can't -- obviously don't trust any of those civilians over there, 'cause they're dressed up as people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they're part of the army, shooting at us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  So you don't know who to -- you can't trust, [MN] you know, our troops can't trust any of those people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that they see on the side of the road, you know?
L:  Yeah.  It's [MN] --
R:  So ...
L:  -- definitely going to be something that's going to be a new experience, though.
R:  And then the sick part is they have suicide bombers that just kill themselves.
L:  Oh, please, that --
R:  And then they -- their family gets money. [LAUGH]
L:  -- the -- yeah, their family is paid for them, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- going out and -- and blowing themselves up, yeah.
R:  You get money to kill yourself, yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, that's horrible.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But, you know, that's the extent that people will go to -- to get at us.
R:  Right.
L:  [LIPSMACK] You know, and that just shows, you know, how much we have to protect.
R:  [COUGH] Right.  I mean, September eleven, that can never happen again.
L:  Yeah.  Where are you at?
R:  I'm from Massachusetts, but I'm in Florida now.
L:  Oh, I'm in New York, actually, you know?
R:  Oh, you're New York?
L:  So, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I -- actually, I used to work for an airline for three years and I got laid off twice 'cause of nine eleven.
L:  Wow.
R:  US Air I was with, and I got laid off 'cause, uh, you know, nine eleven happened. [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH] Yeah, but I live, like, I'm from, like, Springfield, now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's only, like, two and half hours from New York City.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, what else? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I was expecting the survey on toys.  I didn't know we were talking about war.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I expected more, you know, something different.  They said that it would just kind of be, you know, they'd give us the topic and then we'd elaborate on it.
R:  [MN] [COUGH]
L:  But I guess, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- this is the first time, so --
R:  Right.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  How did you, uh, get this interview?  How did you hear about that?
L:  I didn't hear that, what did you say?
R:  How did you hear about this, like, you know, the phone call [MN]?
L:  Oh, ah, email.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, same thing. [NOISE] [COUGH] [NOISE] [MN].  Seems like the last few days, the war, they haven't been talking about it nearly as much as a couple of weeks ago.
L:  Oh, I'm so happy about that, because --
R:  I know.
L:  -- it was just so non stop --
R:  Yeah, that's all --
L:  -- you know, and it -- it was ridiculous.  So, I'm glad that it's getting to a place where there's a little bit of a calm and, [NOISE] and, you know, it's not so much focused on just that.  So, [NOISE] it's better for --
R:  What do you think --
L:  -- us.
R:  [COUGH] What do you think about the, um, Saddam, do you think they -- do you think he's dead or alive, or do you think --  
L:  No, definitely, I think he's roaming around just watching --
R:  He's definitely not dead?
L:  -- just waiting, yeah, just waiting for his moment.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  [NOISE] There's no way they got him.
L:  No, definitely not.
R:  Just like bin Laden.  That guy is the smartest guy. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah --
R:  He knows seven la- --
L:  -- and I mean, you know --
L:  You know, he -- he knows seven languages.  I mean, he's not -- he's not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- dead either. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh. [SIGH]
R:  And he's worth billions.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And he, a- a- -- uh, Saddam has nothing to lose right now.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  You know, it's either give up his country or die, you know, so why not fight 'til the death -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Why not plot to s- -- because it's not like he's going to get his country back.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  You know, so, uh, for him, there's nothing to lose.
R:  Right, nothing to lose at all.
L:  You know?  And he said it, you know, all he needs is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, five thousand people in his country -- a thousand people in his country --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to stand behind him, and th- that's all, you know, they'll -- they'll be his wall --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- you know, they'll fight for him.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  So, that's all he really needs, so ...
R:  Yeah, he doesn't care about any of those troops, anyway.
L:  No, he doesn't.  He just cares that his point gets across and that's it.
R:  [SIGH] [COUGH] [NOISE]
L:  So, hopefully, you know, [LIPSMACK] this will bring good.
R:  This should have been done a long time ago.
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  A long time.
L:  They should have -- yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK] I think it should have been done y- years ago. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] You know?  But they're trying now, and that's what matters, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess we'll just see what happens.
R:  [NOISE] That's too bad for all those troops over there, you know?
L:  Definitely.
R:  Some of them are eighteen years old, nineteen, they don't know what's going on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  They're babies, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they're over there fighting and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [COUGH] And it's terrible that so many people died so far, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't what it's at now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- w- what was it at, like, around two hundred or so?
L:  Um, I think --
R:  Is it?
L:  -- yeah.  I'm not exact- -- I haven't really been paying attention to the numbers, really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] I've tried to just, you know, stay away from it.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Hm. [COUGH] What else can we talk --
L:  So, was it -- huh?
R:  Go ahead.  I'm sorry [LAUGH].
L:  Are we supposed to talk for ten minutes, that's a [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, how -- how long has it been? [LAUGH]
L:  I don't even know, 'cause I -- I have a timer on my phone, but I can't see it.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.
L:  I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  Where in New York are you from? [NOISE]
L:  In, uh, Queens.
R:  Oh, Queens, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and I mean, when it all happened here, it was --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- it was chaos here, you know, for the first couple of months.
R:  Right.
L:  And -- and then, you know, I have small children and then they go to school and they --
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  -- talk to the -- yeah, and I think that, okay, yeah, we needed to talk to them about it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but then again it's, like, okay, enough is enough, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  How much of this do I want my kid to listen to all the time, you know what I mean?  So --
R:  How old are the kids?
L:  Six and four.
R:  Six and four?
L:  Mhm.
R: [COUGH]
L:  Yeah, so, I mean, right now I guess that I just think [NOISE] the biggest threat is us --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to us, it's just us.  You know, and our President is, like, gun happy and --
R:  I stand by him, though.  I mean, ever since he came in, you know, he -- look what he had to deal with, nine eleven came --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, the first year he started, you know, he's been through a lot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] But, [MN] I don't know about going to wars, though.
L:  We're already there, what can we do now, right?
R:  No, I know, I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So ... [inaudible].
R:  It's too bad we had to do that.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But just hopefully it'll all pass soon enough.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] [COUGH] [LIPSMACK] Hm, what else can we talk about?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I was expecting, like, another survey, like
