R:  H- --
L:  Hello, my name is Rachel.
R:  Hi, Rachel.  I'm Logan.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are ya?
L:  Good.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So I guess we're supposed to talk about what country we feel is a threat, if there is one?
R:  Correct.
L:  Uh, I think Syria is a definite threat.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think Iran is a definite threat.
R:  Mhm, I would agree.
L:  Um, I think they're both, uh, coun- [NOISE] countries that are given to harboring terrorists.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I was fortunate enough to spend quite a bit of time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the Middle East --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I know that -- that people in Iran and Syria and Iraq are -- many of them are extremists --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I don't believe that, [NOISE] you know, Muslims as a whole pose any type of a problem.
R:  I agree.
L:  Um, I -- i- -- you know, I do know that, uh, I -- I was married, actually, to an Egyptian -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for about ten years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I found everyone that I met in Egypt to be welcoming --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and loving towards Americans --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the American way of life --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they were inquisitive, and they really had no problems with Americans or the American way of life.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Um, you know, e- every now and then you read of an extremist, and I think that those are isolated people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that need to be dealt with.
R:  Mhm, I agree.
L:  Um [NOISE] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yeah, and I would also, uh, add that I think Korea is a definite threat.
L:  Yes.  I -- I forgot about K- --
R:  I think that kind of goes without saying. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, K- -- yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I -- I think the problem with Korea should have been handled years ago --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just as Iraq should have been handled --
R:  Right.
L:  -- years ago, before this technology became available to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- them.  Um, I think that, um, you know, these type of things should have been dealt with --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, before they were able to get out of hand.
R:  Yeah, I think that.
L:  I think there are too many, um, people that are -- are just willing to say, "Oh, don't worry, things will work out".
R:  Mm.
L:  It -- I -- I don't think that happens.  I don't, you know, I think that there are people out there who really [LIPSMACK] are a threat --
R:  Have an agenda.
L:  -- to the United States --
R:  Have an agenda --
L:  -- and --
R:  True.  And I also think that ano- -- a part of the problem that -- that unfortunately tends to get un- un- -- overlooked, depending on the administration, is what our --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- governments have done without our knowledge prior to things getting out of hand.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, what dealings they've had with certain governments, uh, whether it's to deal, you know, to say, "Well, if you join us, we'll give you arms so you can go deal with Russia".
L:  Yes, I -- I --
R:  Or whatever it is, you know?
L:  -- I -- I believe --
R:  It's like we've --
L:  -- that there, you know, was much of that going on --
R:  Mhm, right.
L:  -- um, you know --
R:  Playing both sides of the fence, basically.
L:  Y- yes, yes, I think that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think, you know, back in the eighties and nineties, there was a lot --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, two faced things going on --
R:  Right.
L:  -- back and forth, and I think, uh, we're paying for the price for it now.
R:  Unfortunately we are, and on a lot of different levels.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I mean, I -- I know that, you know, we certainly gave guns and all types --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- munitions and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- technology to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- people that, you know, weren't, uh, capable of, uh, dealing with it --
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  -- in a responsible manner.  Um, I think that, uh, a lot of the people that -- that we dealt with were mercenaries --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they were just out to make the quick buck --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they, you know, took what we gave them and just turned it around and made a quick buck out of it and [NOISE] --
R:  Right, whose loyalties definitely weren't with any particular government per se, but --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- just with their own -- with their own pockets.
L:  With their own pockets, exactly.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, you know, I don't -- I don't know that we, you know, specifically gave anything to, you know, Saddam Hussein, but I'm sure that we gave something to someone --
R:  Right.
L:  -- who then turned around and sold it --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- to him.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, whether that person came to us, you know, with the intentions of doing that, I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- don't know, but I do know that, you know, I'm sure that it has happened.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  Um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I'm sure that that technology, you know, has -- has gone awry --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, has -- has --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?
R:  I think -- I think part of the problem also is the simple fact that it's -- we see ourselves as the world power, um, not really as -- as part of a global community, um, and we tend to try to decide how other countries should behave or not behave --
L:  Yes, I -- I -- I --
R:  -- based on our criteria.
L:  -- think that -- I think that is true, but I also think that the average American [NOISE] hasn't really travelled outside the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- United States enough to really appreciate --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- what other countries go through --
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  -- on a daily basis.
R:  I completely agree with you.
L:  Um --
R:  We take a lot for granted.
L:  Oh, we take i- -- so much for granted it's -- it's -- it's really quite sickening.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, first of all, let me tell you, I'm an American through and through --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I'm never going to give up my minivan and my --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- five TVs --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and my computer.  I'm never going to give them up.
R:  Right.
L:  But I can also tell you that, you know, I sat here watching these kids in Iraq that were just grateful to get a bag of grain --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- when I've got a five year old who's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- got his own computer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, he's got a, you know, all the -- the fancy games and everything else --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- and, I mean, you know, we have no --
R:  Yeah, and he'll have a tantrum if doesn't get his pop tart every once in a while.
L:  Yeah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- exactly.  You know, we -- we have no idea --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, the av- -- I mean, I do, because I've, you know, I've been to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the other side of the world, I've seen --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kids picking hamburgers out of trash cans --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but I think the average person here in America, and especially the young people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, they have no idea --
R:  I agree.
L:  -- um, of how, uh, the world is difficult for these people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I mean, I can certainly understand the resentment that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- these people have --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, when they look at -- look at a magazine or a newspaper and they see what American children have -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and their own children are -- are dying of disease.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, you know, I -- I -- I thought it was incredible, uh, we were in Egypt a couple of years ago, and there was a kid that -- while we were there, in the course of a week, we heard of four different children that were electrocuted.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, from either plugging something in or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- plugging, you know, a light in or whatever.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, when was the last time you ever heard of anybody in America being electrocuted?
R:  True, true.
L:  You know, it's because they don't have the education.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  I mean, they, you know, they run -- their -- their public service announcements on TV are about not swimming in the Nile because the water is polluted.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean, [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know what I mean?  It's just -- just incredible, you know, the things that these people have to go through on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a daily basis.
R:  Right, and I -- I don't know what's going to -- I mean, I know Bush, i- if he was given the chance, he would go to war with every single country that he thought was a threat, um, whether an actual threat, a -- a -- a potential threat or whatever, I mean, he's obviously proven that even if you are a potential, uh, enemy, that you're up for being invaded.  Um --
L:  I think he has definitely demonstrated that he's not here to fool around and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- he's -- he's gonna make good on, you know, whatever he said he was going to do --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, whether that's a good thing or not --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know.  Um --
R:  Well, I think in theory it sounds really great, but I don't think when you look at the economic realities of what our country is going through, I don't know where you are, but, um, I'm in New York City, and we're getting hit really, really hard.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Um, it's s- severe crunch time.
L:  Yeah, I mean, I'm -- I'm in, um, you know, North Central Massachusetts --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in a very small town --
R:   Right.
L:  -- you know?  So, we're in a small town and we have, you know, virtually no business in our town, so --
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  -- our taxes come out of people's pockets.
R:  Exactly, yeah.
L:  And unfortunately, you know, our school system is a disaster --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, our -- our high school kids, if they wanna play football, have to pay fifteen hundred dollars.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  I mean, it's, you know, it's [MN] --
R:  Oh, jeeze, yeah.
L: -- it's -- it's -- it's really -- it's really incredible.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  You know, if you wanna play the clarinet in the band, you know, you have to pay, you know, a hundred and twenty five dollars.
R:  Phew, yeah.
L:  I mean, in -- in --
R:  Ah, yeah.
L:  -- that's not including your instrument, you gotta pay for your instrument --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and your, you know --
R:  Right, right, yeah, exactly.
L:  -- everything else yourself.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, this is just to be in the band --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know?  So, I mean, we have really been hit hard with many things too.  Um, so, yes, our economy is -- is really, you know, seeing tough times.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But --
R:  Yeah, yeah, even though I would love to say, "Hey, yeah, let's go and invade Syria". [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I don't know --
R:  I -- if we --
L:  -- I was just -- I was just reading something --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- where they found six hundred million American dollars --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- behind a wall in one of the palaces.
R:  Hm.
L:  Well, gee, there's half the budget.
R:  There you go. [LAUGH]
L:  I think we can --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I think we can finance this war now.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, no. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, it seems to me that that --
R:  So, that would be a huge kettle of fish if we just said, "Oh, by the way, that's ours" [LAUGH].  "To the victor go the spoils".
L:  Well, they are American dollars.
R:  Well, true, but then they weren't in the possession of the [LAUGH] Americans at the time. [LAUGH] That would -- I think that would definitely cause a problem with --considering, uh, that the people of Iraq are actually starving right now.
L:  Well, yes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I, you know, I -- I understand that, you know?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  But, uh --
R:  But I understand -- I understand your point.  Um --
L:  [LIPSMACK] But --
R:  -- yeah, I don't know.  I just -- I just don't feel comfortable giving, um, well, first of all, I think it's -- it's -- it's a little, um, two faced, in the sense that we are saying to these countries, "You cannot have weapons of mass destruction" but --
L:  And --
R:  -- we have them.
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  It's saying, "Everybody's who's in our camp and plays our games can have them, but you can't".
L:  Right.
R:  I understand the fundamental extremists --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, who are out there who would use them for very negative purposes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But at the same time, I think it's definitely, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like I said, two faced to say, "Well, you can have it and you can have it, but you cannot".
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  Either we all have to disarm --
L:  It is.
R: -- you know --
L:  But, you know --
R:  -- and find a different way, or, you know?
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  We're just going to have to deal with it.
L:  You know, the -- and -- and, you know, on the other hand, the fighting in the Middle East --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- has been going on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for centuries.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  I mean, are we -- do we actually think that in a couple of, uh, years we're going to settle everything going on in the Gaza Strip and --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- Israel and, you know, and -- and --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- make the whole region friendly towards each other?  I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they -- they've got centuries of --
R:  Right.
L:  -- of, um, you know
