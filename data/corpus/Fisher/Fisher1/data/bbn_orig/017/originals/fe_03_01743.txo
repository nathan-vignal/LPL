R:  Hello.  My name is Crystal.
L:  Oh, hi [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] I know.  All of a sudden we're here.
L:  I know.  I was just gonna hang up because I thought -- well, then I thought. "No, I'll hang on here for ten minutes" [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and see what happens.  Hi, my name is Anne.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  Yes, um, I -- I almost forget the topic now.
R:  Um, it's -- w- c- what countries do we consider a threat to the USCC and why? [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Okay. 
R:  And what is the USCC? [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know that the United States -- I do consider other countries a threat to the United States.  Um, one Korea but, um, that's for obvious reasons.
L:  Yes, yes, yes.
R:  But then again, I don't know because actually my husband and I were talking about this and if Korea were to do anything, they'd know that we'd blow them out of the water so [LAUGH] they'd be committing suicide attempting anything on us anyway, so ...
L:  As long as they didn't do something so horrible before you had a chance to blow then out of the water though [LAUGH].
R:  Right, but when I was talking to him, my husband said that I don't think that they could.  Um, their weapons aren't as good as ours, number one and number two they're too far away and if they ever got close enough to do any major damage, we'd get them before they could --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so from they're -- what they're -- they're talking about is trying to do something from where they are right now and the only place they could hit is California and that's it.  And once they've done that, boom! we'd get them.  Um, so, they'd be committing suicide on their own country [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- trying to even get just one state of ours, so ...
L:  Yeah, yeah, and -- and I mean they're -- the States is aware of -- of, uh, their weapons and stuff right now so they're not --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they're watching them very closely, I'm sure.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, uh -- I -- I should tell you, I'm from Canada.  I'm not even from the States so --
R:  Oh, really.  Oh, I'm from the -- I'm not that far away from you.  I'm from New Hampshire.
L:  Oh, yeah.  No, I'm on the other side.  Just north of California [LAUGH] BC.
R:  Oh, oh, okay.  So, you're on the other side of Canada.  Okay.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I think I'm more near Montreal [LAUGH].
L:  Uh, yeah, yeah -- no, I'm on the west coast so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- but I sometimes -- I sometimes like just with all this -- without -- with Canada not supporting the States in this, um --
R:  Only some.  I know that some of you guys do [LAUGH].
L:  Well, well and I know a lot of you Americans don't support Bush either so, you know, it's -- I mean, you're up here [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, I do.  I love my President.
L:  So, we -- we see  your [several inaudible words] up here.
R:  Oh, really.  No, I love my President Bush so [MN].
L:  Yeah, no, I mean everybody's -- I mean, if we were all the same it'd be a pretty boring world right?
R:  Right.  Exactly.  Yes.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  If people have their own opinions, so that's why there's freedom of speech here in the US.
L:  Yeah, and thank god, we can have our own opinions without being punished for them, right?
R:  Right [LAUGH]
L:  But, um -- but no I've heard some horror stories about, uh -- about, uh, Canadians trying to get across the border and Americans are --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  I mean, it's -- it's not, uh, it's not us individual Canadians --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's -- it's our -- our leader [LAUGH].
R:  Right, oh [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Just like your guys.  You know, you have a leader that makes decisions for you --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as a country so, um --
R:  So, I'm wondering if they want to know, um, in general, if there's a threat to just the United States because they said USCC so I'm wondering if that could be the US and surrounding countries, um, 'cause Canada is kinda vulnerable too.  Um, because you guys are so nice to everybody [LAUGH].
L:  Well, and also we're so close.
R:  Right, exactly and you are so close and we are neighbors and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- allies most of the time [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, well most of the time.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, we are.  It's just -- you know, if -- if, uh -- if -- if NATO would've of approved of this, well then I'm sure --
R:  Right.
L:  -- there wouldn't have been a question.  It was just -- just whatever the choice that our Prime Minister made.
R:  So, I wonder if there's any other countries, though, that we could consider as being a threat.  Um, I know that they were -- was it Syria they were talking about?
L:  I was just gonna say that because they've sort of, uh -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- they were hiding some stuff for Iraq, weren't they?
R:  Yeah, and people were sneaking into Iraq, uh, fighting for, you know, I- fighting against us --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for Iraq and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they were all sneaking in at that command.  I guess there was a videotape and as soon as that videotape of that -- it was a videotape of Saddam Hussein and as soon as it went on air, and he said certain things that were kinda like key words people think, um, 'cause he said, "And now is the time to go".  And he would kinda say it as "hint, hint" you know, and any other countries that heard that, as soon as that tape went on, all of a sudden people started coming into Iraq and fighting against us --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- other countries, so they think that videotape was kind of a "here's your key -- here's your cue, go, fight".
L:  Uh-huh.  Could -- yeah.
R:  So, um, there are other countries, and France, you know, of course, I don't think we're afraid of France over here in the US but they do seem to be posing, you know, arguments against us.  They're -- they seem to [MN] there seems to be a lot against us over in France.  Um, I don't think of them as a threat but I do think that, right now, they're not being very friendly [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Or -- or maybe they're just trying to -- to, uh, not be a follower.  You know, like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- 'cause it's -- it's, uh -- [MN] like not being an American is, um, like with you guys America's sort of being the super power of the world right now.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, it's -- it's, um, it --
R:  That's funny to hear [LAUGH].
L:  -- takes a lot of guts to say, "No" [LAUGH].
R:  I've never heard that before actually [LAUGH].
L:  Well, it used to be Russia and China and the States, right?  
R:  That's true.
L:  Now that Russia's not there, or it's -- it's dissolved and --
R:  Yeah, now they're ju- they're states actually themselves.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  So, I mean, it's not the power that it -- it was a one time and then -- and China's, for whatever reason, quiet.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-oh [LAUGH].  That could be --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- a problem.  You know, the quiet ones are the ones to be afraid of [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, yeah, but I think it's, like, the leaders make a big -- a big, um, you know, like some of them are a bit -- I don't know, like -- like, um, a bit off the wall sometimes, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's a personality -- like you almost think it's a personality thing like you d- like with France I'm -- I'm not saying that they're against you by any means.  I doubt if they are.
R:  Right.
L:  I doubt if they are.  They're just wanting to be their own country for a bit, you know?
R:  Yeah, maybe that's true.  Um, 'cause I know that when they were -- they were talking about, you know, we don't want to do this, we don't want to do that and then all of a sudden, they're against us because we've chosen something different.  And a lot of times people get threatened if you don't like something that they -- they like.  You know, same thing with just individual people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If say I were to like something and my sister were to say, "I don't like that" and all of a sudden she's mad at me, she's not really mad at me --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- she's mad at the fact that I'm not going along with her opinion.
L:  Yeah, yeah, and it's a sort of a standoff.
R:  I think France wants to be a big power house and they can't be if everyone's going against their opinion [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  No, true.  But like Germany was the same too, right?  A little bit there at the start, they were -- they were --
R:  Yeah, because --
L:  -- making a bit of a noise.
R:  -- Germany did have the power at one time but then again when they were -- when they had their little power thing, it was kind of a bad behavior.  You know, when --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Hitler kind of made a real bad thing outta -- you know there was a lot of power there but it was kinda more of a Saddam Hussein power --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I don't remember who took them down.  I know it's bad -- horrible me.  I'm a nursing student, not a history major [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I know that, you know, it's good when people, uh, you know, are -- the bad guys are taken down.  Maybe the country will be a little, you know, not in full power for a little bit --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but they'll -- they'll rise to the occasion [LAUGH] you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I believe fully in the bible and so I believe that Iraq will rise up, you know.  It's biblical actually that Iraq -- you know, bible -- Babylon is right there in Iraq --
L:  I know.
R:  -- and, you know, Babylon in the bible is gonna be built up into this huge, great city some day and I -- it's right there in Iraq and in fact, we've been -- our President ordered that nobody touch Iraq when we do any of the bomb- -- Babylon, nobody's to touch Babylon.
L:  Hm.
R:  So, um, and that's why nobody's gone anywhere near it.  No one's done -- no bombs have, um, touched Babylon and that was an order that nobody go near that, you know, that city so ...
L:  Oh, I didn't know that.
R:  Yeah, yeah and it's, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because our President is also a Christian so, you know, he -- he's very careful about things like that and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and Kuwait City.  I'm so glad we freed them [LAUGH] so ...
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Like -- but it's -- it's such a shame to that-- I mean, it's off topic but all the --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- the history that got looted and stuff in -- in Baghdad like it's --
R:  Oh, in Iraq?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I think it's a reaction.  You know, the people are reacting to -- I mean, all of a sudden, they have all this freedom and they didn't know what to do with themselves and actually I think a lot of them were so angry with Saddam Hussein.  I mean, if I were like tortured and raped and everything else and my children were in prison for years for absolutely nothing, you know, they didn't do anything wrong. They were just in prison because they refused to be a part of his little training camps --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- you know, all of a sudden, he's gone.  They're probably reacting -- they're reacting to the whole situation and they probably just ran in and looted and they're --
L:  Yeah and I --
R:  -- just having a grand old time saying, "Huh, look.  I'm sitting in Saddam Hussein's chair" [LAUGH] something they never thought they'd ever do.
L:  Yeah.  No, I'm sure that was part of it, a big part of it but -- but it just -- it just seems such a shame that -- that all this history is smashed or destroyed or stolen or --
R:  Yeah, they --
L:  -- whatever.
R:  --I -- I think they're getting it under control now.  It is a shame that that happened but did you hear that they also found -- I think it was six hundred and fifty million dollars, US dollars, in, uh, one of Sa- -- I think it's one of Saddam Hussein's palaces.  Something that had to do with Saddam Hussein.  They found it in the walls, I think.  Did you hear that?
L:  Uh, I heard --
R:  I think it was today --
L:  -- you know, I heard --
R:  -- or yesterday.
L:  -- something.  I heard -- just I've -- I've CNN on once in a while and I --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- hear about it, right?  But I did hear something but I didn't remember.  I just knew it was a huge amount of money they found but I didn't --
R:  Oh, yeah.  And I think they're go-- they're gonna find out if it's real 'cause if it's fake they're not going to divvy it out, but if they find out it's real they're gonna pass it out to the Iraqi people.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's gonna go to them.  So ...
L:  Well, they're probably gonna need a bunch of money just to -- to rebuild the cities.
R:  Oh, yeah.  That, and, you know, these people they were living in, you know, I think whatever they're getting five or ten dollars a week for all the work that they did.
L:  Well, I don't if you saw a while -- like before the war started that a guy, an announcer, was on TV and he had a wad of ...
