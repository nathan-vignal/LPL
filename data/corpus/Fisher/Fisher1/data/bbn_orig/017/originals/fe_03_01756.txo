L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Becky.
L:  I'm Jessica.
R:  Hi, nice to meet you.  Where are you from? 
L:  I'm from Missoula, Montana.
R:  Oh, very good, I'm over in central New Jersey.
L:  Oh, wow, we're pretty far apart. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So what other countries do you think are a big threat? 
L:  Iran.
R:  Yeah, I think Iran, ah, Syria, North Korea.  I think just about everybody out --  
L:  O- --  
R:  -- there could be -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. 
R:  -- a threat. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, most of them out there.  Not good countries.
R:  I know that Iran was, um, pretty ticked off, to, ah, to put  it lightly, but, ah, I know that they were pretty mad when one of the stray missiles actually went into their country and --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I was hoping that they weren't going to retaliate, you know, in -- in some manner to either us or to the Iraqi people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, ah ... now a -- a lot seems to be coming up with Syria and letting people, um, like the higher ups of Iraq go over there, so, I kind of wonder well, are they friends or are they not, you know, do they have something up their sleeves.
L:  I know North Korea has a lot of chemical weapons.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  So ... and they don't like us very much, [LAUGH] so --
R:  No. [LAUGH] South Korea was okay, I don't have a problem with South Korea because they seem to be on our side in -- in a manner but --  
L:  Yeah, well we have taken care of them for so long.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, North Korea has a -- a lot on their -- on their end so ... I have been worried about that.  I mean, I don't -- I don't know how far, you know, certain weapons can reach though, I'm not that, like, into it but of course I worry about myself and my country and everybody else but -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I don't know how much damage they could really do to us.
L:  Um, I don't know.
R:  Like can they really, like, shoot something from over there and hit us or ... 
L:  I think they would probably catch it before it got all the way over here.
R:  Right.
L:  And they -- 
R:  That's scary.
L:  -- did that for a long time in Kuwait city.
R:  Right.
L:  Intercepting missiles. 
R:  Yeah, they have been doing an awesome job.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah, there then -- I mean --
R:  What about Russia?
L:  Russia? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.
R:  [inaudible] they wanted us to read that we're against us going in there?  I mean, I know there was France, I think there was Germany and, was it Russia or was it somebody else. 
L:  I don't know.  I don't remember, I mean it's ...
R:  I don't think really France that we have anything to worry about.  I think that they were just --  
L:  France is just kind of scared to I think --  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- to get into it.  But I mean they're over there helping us now so ... 
R:  Right.
L:  I think it was just -- I had seen on the news too that supposedly France was covering up stuff that they were doing, like, selling, um, like, missiles and stuff like that to -- 
R:  Really.
L:  -- yeah, to Iraq.
R:  Huh.
L:  Which is why they didn't want to, um, do anything, because it was going to hurt them.
R:  Right, yeah, that's right.
L:  But, I mean, I don't know how much of that is true either so ... 
R:  You can't believing everything on the news. [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] Uh-huh, no, just 'cause it's on the news doesn't mean it's true.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, yeah, I mean, I don't think France is anything.
R:  I think we have more friends than we do foes.
L:  Huh? 
R:  I think we have more friends than we do foes in -- in terms of, you know, countries. 
L:  Yeah, but the foes that we do have are pretty scary. 
R:  Yeah, yeah they're pretty powerful.  They -- they know their stuff.
L:  Yeah, they're -- and they're all ruled by guys that have no conscious --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Conscience.
R:  You got it.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Do you think that Iraq is still a -- a threat to us? 
L:  Who? 
R:  Iraq.
L:  I don't think so.  
R:  I mean, I hope they stop -- 
L:  I think that if they would have done something they would have done it a long time ago.
R:  Right.
L:  Because I don't think -- I don't think, um, they really communicate too well with their military anyway, you know.
R:  Right. 
L:  I don't think they're gonna do much to us any more. 
R:  I'm just still wondering if they actually have something over there that we haven't found yet or if they are just waiting for kind of like the calm to come over the country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that the -- the biggest stuff is over and then boom all of a sudden they will attack us or --  
L:  Yeah, they could.  I mean, it would be -- I don't know though, I don't think they would any more.
R:  I hope not.
L:  I don't either -- I do too.  I mean, but, I mean, I would have thought that they would have retaliated already by now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.
R:  No, I just think that right now, like you said, Iran is a big threat.
L:  Iran I think is the biggest.
R:  Right.  And, ah, ...
L:  They say that, I mean, out of the top three dictators he is probably -- he is in the top three.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And I think the one from Saudi Arabia is too.
R:  Right, yeah, yeah that one is.
L:  And I don't remember what the other one is but I know those two supposedly, they are worse than Saddam Hussein.
R:  Mhm.  That's not good.
L:  So I don't know. 
R:  I don't really know -- I don't know if I should worry -- well, not me myself but I don't know if Syria would really be a big problem.  I think they are more just -- ah, I don't know how to put it, I guess they kind of want to be a friend in a way to Iraq and, you know, helping, like, the people come over and -- and get out of harms way so that they can -- or if they were really doing bad by letting the -- the leaders come in.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know if -- if -- they could go either way I would think.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I don't -- I don't think that they are big enough or they really have that kind of military power to -- to do anything to us to harm us.
L:  I don't think they do but I think they have -- are -- are we talking about Iran? 
R:  Syria.
L:  Oh, Syria, yeah.  I don't know, but they have pretty -- some pretty scary chemical weapons, I mean they wouldn't need much. 
R:  Right.
L:  Just even that mustard gas is pretty ga- -- pretty bad.
R:  Yeah.  It was scary watching everybody prepare to go over there with all the gas masks and ... 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And their [inaudible] 
L:  Well, I had my -- my -- my husband was in the marine corp.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I mean, he got out like two or three weeks after September eleventh.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, yeah, we were kind of worried that they were gonna call him back in but --  
R:  Oh, Right.
L:  -- they never did so that was a good thing but I still have friends that have husbands over there right now.
R:  Right.  That's got to be so hard, I can only imagine.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My husband's a voluntary fire fighter and I guess we're in central New Jersey, so when the towers got hit and they were actually, my husband's department was actually one of the first that they called to go over there so --  
L:  Oh, really.
R:  So, it kind of a- affected us I guess in the same way that it would for you and -- and your husband, so.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just worry about something like that happening again but I -- I don't know anybody who would take that risk again, what other countries, if -- if they do then --  
L:  Oh yeah, they're all --
R:  They're going to be pretty much screwed.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I don't think they would do it again.  And if they did,  I don't know, they're pretty dumb because they know that Bush isn't gonna just sit back and take it.
R:  I -- I think he's done a pretty good job.  I don't think that he's -- like, he could be better, I know it's a totally different topic, but I think he's handling the war and how he, ah, I guess, confronting the country so I think he's doing a really good job with it but --
L:  Yeah, I don't know, I think they just criticize him because he's the one that's in the spotlight right now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And some people talk and they don't even know what they're talking about really.
R:  Right.
L:  But, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I'm glad that we -- we did what we had to do over there.  I'm glad that there is some sort of peace.
L:  Yeah, I don't think he had another choice.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, yeah, but, as far as, like, I think the biggest ones are Iran and North Korea.
R:  Right. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  North Korea's really scary.  I mean the -- the way that they are over there, if you -- I watch them on the news, um, just looking at them, I don't know, they just come across with no feelings or -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with nothing, they just have, like, these straight looks on their face -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they just don't care, which is really --  
L:  Well, they have no conscience. 
R:  Right.
L:  And they don't, you know, -- they just think that they need to do that to get what they want and -- I don't think they care about much else.
R:  I just don't understand how people can live like that.  They're just yeah, right, you know, if you kill a whole bunch of people, ah, so be it, you know. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I don't think they'll get that.  
L:  It's just -- just the way they are raised too, you can't really -- it's kind of hard to blame a group of people when they don't know anything different.
R:  Right, but I guess it's the same as some of the Iraqis too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They -- they don't know, they don't understand like this whole new freedom so to speak, you know, they're like, ah, they don't understand the looting. 
L:  Yeah, you can't blame them. 
R:  I don't blame them for what they're doing but at the same time it's, like, hey, wait, those are people who have businesses, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You are just taking right from them, you know.  Those are your own people.
L:  Yeah.  They just -- I mean, they're -- they're just -- they just, um, brain wash them so bad I think that --
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  And so many are still scared that is he is gonna wind up back in power.
L:  Mhm. I don't think he will ever be back in power.
R:  [inaudible]
