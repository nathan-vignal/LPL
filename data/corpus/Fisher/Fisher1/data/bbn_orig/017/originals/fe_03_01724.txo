L:  Who is this?
R:  Hi, my name is Pat.
L:  What's going on? 
R:  What's going on?  Ah, I think we're supposed to be talking about countries that we consider might be a threat.
L:  Are we getting paid for this?
R:  Yes.
L:  We are?
R:  Yes. 
L:  How much money are we getting for this?
R:  I do believe that we're getting ten dollars -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- for ten minutes.
L:  Ah, in the form of cash, or in the form of a check? [NOISE] 
R:  In the form of a check.
L:  How's it getting to us?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK], I'm not sure -- 
L:  Mm --  
R:  -- it will be -- 
L:  -- weird -- 
R:  -- to us.
L:  -- because I don't remember signing up for something where I'd get ten dollars for ten minutes of talking.  [COUGH] 
R:  You di- you didn't?
L:  I don't know, I don't remember. [COUGH] 
R:  I did. 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes.  What is your name?
L:  Ah, um, ah, [COUGH] Matt.
R:  Matt?
L:  Mhm. 
R:  How old are you, Mat?
L:  Ah, that's not important.  [COUGH] excuse me.
R:  Okay.  Can you say how you feel about, ah, which country might be a threat?
L:  Ah, I never did quite trust the Canadians.
R:  [LAUGH] No?
L:  No.
R:  Okay.  Right now I don't trust the Syrians [LAUGH] 
L:  Really? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] How come?
R:  Well, as far as I heard this morning on, ah, NSMBC[?] I think a lot of the weapons of mass destruction have been sent to Syria.
L:  Mm. 
R:  And I think they're -- 
L:  I think, ah, -- 
R:  -- harboring -- 
L:  I'm really not afraid of the world.  I'm not -- 
R:  You're not afraid -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- of the world?
L:  Not so much.
R:  No, I'm not afraid of the -- the whole world -- 
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- but I do believe there are people in it that would participate in our demise.
L:  Well, I can't help but notice -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that if it weren't for mass media I wouldn't have heard about any of this and my life wouldn't have changed at all. 
R:  [NOISE] Your life wouldn't have been what?
L:  My life would not have changed at all -- 
R:  [NOISE] [MN] 
L:  -- thus, I'm not really afraid of the world.  [NOISE] 
R:  No, I'm not either. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, right. 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, but I -- I kind of -- I like the fact that I have mass media to count on [NOISE] ah, four of my brothers were in the world war two at the same time -- 
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- and that my mum had no -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- idea where they were, how they were, or [NOISE] and I think had she had the media coverage like -- like we have today it would have [MN] ah, helped her keep track of her sons. [NOISE] 
L:  Well, having worked for the media for a while I tend to think that it's full of shit sometimes.
R:  Well, it -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- is biased.
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  In all depends on if you, ah, agree with the Bush administration I think is what it comes down to.
L:  Ah.
R:  You don't? [NOISE] 
L:  Ah, I don't really care.  I mean it's, like, [COUGH], mm, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I don't know, I don't think, well, mm, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I don't mind.
R:  Well, I -- I think -- 
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- I really do care cause I have four married children and seven grandchildren and -- 
L:  Ahah. 
R:  -- I do care. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, -- 
R:  But I -- I do agree with -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- with Bush and I think had it not taken so long for him to get over there they wouldn't have had -- 
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- as much time to hide the weapons of mass destruction as they did, but -- 
L:  Oh, yeah, where did they hide them?  Other -- 
R:  In Syria [SIGH] 
L:  Where?
R:  In Syria.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  Where did they hide them in Syria?
R:  I'm not sure we -- we don't have any inspectors in Syria [NOISE] that I know of.
L:  Well, then how do we know that there are weapons in Syria?
R:  Because the -- the, ah, [LIPSMACK] two brother in laws -- no, two son in laws of Saddam Hussein and their [NOISE] two top scientists have given up to -- to the Americans to 'em -- I think it was the marines and they told them that five days before we went into Baghdad that [NOISE] they moved their weapons of mass destruction into Syria -- 
L:  Ah.
R:  -- [MN] so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] 
L:  I don't know about scientists though, you know. 
R:  Well, if they de- developed these heads or whatever they are, you know, [NOISE] that -- that r- get -- that get put on the missiles that can deliver anthrax [NOISE] and whatever else it is they deliver.
L:  Yeah, you know -- 
R:  You sound young, Matt. [SIGH] 
L:  I'm plenty old, I guarantee it.
R:  You're what?
L:  I'm plenty old.
R:  You're plenty old?
L:  Plenty.
R:  [LAUGH] Twenty?
L:  Plenty.
R:  Oh, plenty, okay.  I'm fifty eight, so, -- 
L:  Awesome.
R:  -- you don't have to tell me though.  [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah. [MN] 
R:  Um, it sounds like you don't like television [SIGH] I didn't get a response to the Bush thing -- 
L:  Do you have a list of questions -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- there or something?
R:  Pardon?
L:  Do you have a list of quest--
R:  No, no, I'm sitting outside on my patio under my grapevine -- 
L:  That's pretty cool. 
R:  -- ah, been connected to you by this company -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and we're supposed to be chatting about which country do we think is a [NOISE] -- a threat to the United States -- 
L:  States, right.
R:  They picked the topic and we're supposed to talk about it.
L:  That makes sense.
R:  [MN] but somewhere along the line you -- somebody signed you up for this [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  No, you know what it is, I think that I signed up for something where I like go in and talk to people about stuff for a while, but this whole phone stuff makes me nervous. [MN] 
R:  Oh, I'm not nervous.  
L:  [MN] 
R:  Well, you said you're not afraid of the world, what makes you afraid of the phone?
L:  The fact that I don't have any control and that I don't -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- know who might be listening [NOISE] -- 
R:  [NOISE] I -- I think you're -- 
L:  [inaudible] -- 
L:  -- you're drifting, can you get a little closer to the speaker?
L:  I apologize.
R:  Okay, that's go- that's better.
L:  Ah, yeah, I'm a little bit, like, I don't know, I never know whose kind of -- 
R:  Listening?
L:  -- listening in, you know, -- 
R:  Yeah, I -- 
L:  -- the Syrians, the scientists.
R:  Oh, you can be very sure that they're listening in on this conversation.
L:  That's what I'm saying. 
R:  Yeah, that -- that's their job, their job is to [NOISE] -- is to analyze our voices.
L:  Like, some kind -- 
R:  The -- 
L:  -- of, ah, robot?
R:  Yeah, you might be a robot for I know. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's what I'm -- yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] At first you sounded kinda mechanical, but now I think that we're chatting you felt a little more at ease [MN] 
L:  Yeah, I get that a lot.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, let me see, [LIPSMACK] well, you do- you don't listen to the media at all?
L:  I try not to. 
R:  You try not to.
L:  I don't want them to get their ideas into me.
R:  Oh, it all -- really it all depends on which channel I think you're -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- listening to.
L:  Really?  Which channel -- 
R:  Channels -- 
L:  -- should I listen to?
R:  Two, four and seven are very biased, against -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ah, the Bush administration and the war.  They are pro soldier, but they're anti Bush.  Channel five, Fox Media, is, as far as I'm concerned, the only one that really presents a positive a- [MN] y- account of what's actually happening.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  I stopped listening to two, four and seven because I don't like their slant -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at all.
L:  Do you ever watch the Daily Show?
R:  What's the Daily Show?
L:  Ah, this other news program [MN] -- 
R:  No.
L:  You don't?  I used to think that they presented a pretty good argument, but I'm not so sure any more.
R:  Mhm, [LIPSMACK], yeah, well, I'm in New Jersey, so, we get all, you know, all the New York channels here. 
L:  Two, four and seven?
R:  Pardon?
L:  You get two, four and seven?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  And -- well, we get f- now that I've -- I've started listening to channel five more as far as the news is concerned, I don't like the idea that Monica Lewinski is going to be hosting a reality show in channel five, but I already sent them an email.
L:  Yeah --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- we truly are the great Satan.
R:  Pardon?
L:  [MN] We truly are the great Satan.
R:  [MN] We're the great Satan?
L:  Sure we are [MN] look -- 
R:  Ah, oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- look at our TV, I mean "Who wants to marry a millionaire", Monica Lewinski is hosting a show, what is it c- [MN] what the heck. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's ridiculous.  
R:  Well, I don't know, I think -- 
L:  I would hate us.
R:  You would?
L:  Yeah, I would, look at us.
R:  But why do you [NOISE] live here if you ha- if you hate us?
L:  Why do my parents have sex? [NOISE] 
R:  What?
L:  [NOISE] [MN] Because this is where I was conceived and that's -- this is where I live. 
R:  Oh, but I mean you have choices.
L:  I guess, but that's kinda a lot of work [NOISE] [COUGH] 
R:  Well, you -- even though it's a lot of work you still have a choice.  A lot of things are a lot of work, childbirth, [NOISE] but I had [NOISE] a choice [NOISE] -- 
L:  Mm. 
R:  [NOISE] You know [NOISE] 
L:  I don't know --  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I, ah, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I can live here without taking part in the, ah, in the, ah, [NOISE], ah, [NOISE] -- 
R:  What yo-- 
L:  [NOISE] Ah.
R:  Hello?
L:  [NOISE] Was that you or was that me?
R:  I think that was you.
L:  I apologize. 
R:  That's all right.  [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  [NOISE] What are you doing to change it? [NOISE] 
L:  Um, I don't think it's really my place to change it [COUGH] 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  I think I'm just gonna sit back and complain about it.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay, all right. 
L:  Right on.
R:  Well, -- 
L:  So, has it been ten minutes yet?
R:  I don't know, but they said they're gonna let us know. 
L:  Okay, if we talk for half [NOISE] an hour, would we get like thirty dollars? 
R:  I don't think so, but if -- if you do this more than once you do -- you get ten dollars for each time you -- you accept a phone call for ten minutes, you get ten dollars.
L:  Ah.
R:  So every time they call you and you say, "Yes" to it --
