R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Anne.
L:  Hi, Anne, I'm Mary.
R:  Hi, Mary.  Where  where are you from?
L:  I'm from, ah, I'm calling from Florida, Vilo[?] Beach, Florida.
R:  Oh, really?  I'm calling from Ashville, North Carolina.
L:  Oh, how nice.  I know some people there.
R:  Oh, you do?  Good.
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  Very good.
L:  Um, about this topic of, um, computers in education, you know what they want for 
R:  Have they improved 
L:   is that how it was.  Have they  I think that they definitely can improve education, but I'm not quite sure, ah, they're doing so yet.  I just have  um, I was a teacher and, um,  but I retired before  in the school that I was in, I retired before, um, it was really, they really starting using, ah, the computers and, and really integrating them into the educational system.  And, um, I just have a feeling that the  I think that, that, that the children coming up will be much more able to integrate, do that integration, I think that, that  I'm not so sure how much the teachers today can, um, put it  bring, um, computers into the classroom and into their education.  What do you think?
R:  Well, I, I think kind of along the same lines as you.  I think that they have, um  I think it's improved education, I think that technology has, um, opened up  you know, when I was coming up and probably when you were coming up, we went to the in we went to the library and checked  and looked at  and sat there and looked through encyclopedias 
L:  Yes.
R:   and now, now all the information is right at your fingertips, but what I'm finding is that kids are coming out of school very computer literate, but they can't spell 
L:  Right.
R:   because they don't  you know, they're used to spell check.  They, I mean, they  they don't have good spelling  they're not equipped with good spelling tools.  They, um, they don't write as well, I don't think.  Um, and they  you know, they're just taking all these shortcuts.  They  they don't have good, you know, it kind of equates over to, you know, calculators and then they've got calculators now in the computer.  They don't learn the basics, I don't think.  And so I think in one way computers have improved education by opening up every single avenue of, um, of information, the information highway is there, but the basic skills are possibly being overlooked.
L:  Yeah.  I, I agree wholeheartedly with, with that.  I think that there's a lot of things, like in writing, um, like you're talking  you're not talking about penmanship 
R:  No, uh huh.
L:   there, you're talking about just writing.
R:  Writing skills.
L:  I think there's something about  maybe this is being very old fashioned, but, ah, I just think there's something about picking up a pencil and having paper in front of you and being able to cross it out and see it, um, and do it that way.  But that  but there again, I mean, that's my way, so I'm not sure, maybe for  ah, like even when I was filling out this form, um, to get into this study, I was making mistakes and, and the, you know, trying to correct myself and stuff like that.  And I'm not used to what I'm using, a web TV  
R:  Mhm.
L:   and, um, ah, I just, I was getting frustrated, whereas if I had a pencil and eraser, I think it would have been easier for me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I, ah, I feel the same like that, putting down the ideas, um, on a piece of paper and developing them, um, ah, just helps.  And, ah,  but I do think  but it helps to me.  But I think that the kids are  it's such a part of them now.
R:  It is.
L:  That by the time they are, um, teachers and, um, you know, in the classroom and working with students, I think maybe they'll, you know, come up with better ideas and so on on how to use the computer or whatever.
R:  Well, I think if, if the kids are taught the basics, and then use the computer to enhance some of the basic skills, I think that would be fine.  But now there's computers that correct your grammar, um, 
L:  True.  And that's true.  I mean 
R:   and I mean, you know, they, they  it's got a grammar check, and so, you know, if there's a grammatical error, it's underlined or highlighted in some way and it  and it puts in the correct grammar, so you're really not learning.  And so, um, you know, if you, if you don't  if, if it's not learned, then if you go somewhere without a computer, then you're kind of up a creek, because you don't have these basic skills.
L:  Right.  Right.  And you need that just for, just  I mean, in everyday living, really.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, to get a job.
R:  Mhm.
L:  To get a good job, um, you know, they'd need some, some  ah, at least some idea of how to write a letter or what paragraphs or, or whatever  
R:  Mhm.
L:   that kind of thing.  Sentences.  Just basic sentence structure.
R:  Yep.
L:  And, um, ah,  what  do you see a solution?
R:  Um, I  you know, I think that for  well, you've been a teacher so I think that you can probably really relate to this, but I think, um, making sure the kids in the  you know, even in the lower grade schools come  you know, start with the basic skills and build on those skills, then, you know, computer literacy is fine well and good, and it's, and it's great because you cannot really operate in this world today without a computer, but to have the basic skills at your fingertips, knowing that when you make a spelling error you can correct the spelling and know the correct spelling of the word rather than have the computer do it for you.  I, I think it's just kind of an integration into good skills and good computer skills.
L:  So you would have, you would have them have a regular, the same kind of a curriculum 
R:  Mhm.
L:   and then, um,  at the lower level at least.
R:  Right.
L:  And then have, um, computers maybe reinforce 
R:  Right.
L:   those skills.
R:  Reinforce those skills.
L:  And, um, or  add on to. 
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  Reinforcing them.  Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.  That 
R:  Right.  But you know, even in the gra- even in the lower levels, kids are using computers even in kindergarten right now.  I mean, very basic comp um, keyboarding things, but, um, you know, they, they start them early.
L:  Yeah.  I haven't been in a school in a while now, you know, to see  I've been in a school, but I haven't been in, like, um, like kindergarten or whatever, primary school 
R:  Mhm.
L:   to see what they're doing with the, um, with computers  
R:  Mhm.
L:   um, in the classroom.  Have you?
R:  Um, yeah.  I really have.  Um, my daughter is a social worker at a, at a  like one of those like, ah, several ho cluster homes for, um, abused children  
L:  Oh.
R:   and, and so she works directly with the school system 
L:  Oh.
R:   so she  I went on a tour with her, and, um, it's just really amazing.  They've got, ah, they've got computers just  pretty much  not in every classroom, they have what they call computer labs, but all the classrooms have the availability to go to the computer lab, and actually they, they start them out very very young.  Um, 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:   and, ah, so you know, that's made, ah, typing classes, you know, when I was in high school we  I had to take a whole semester of typing.
L:  Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  It's made all that obsolete.  Keyboard  now it's keyboarding.
L:  Oh, right.  Right.  Because I've seen that written.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Keyboarding.
R:  Keyboarding.
L:  They don't call it typing.
R:  Nope, they don't call it typing anymore, so they, they start learning those skills so early, and so by the time they're, they're in the seventh, eighth and ninth grade, they're  they're whiz kids on the computer. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, yeah.  Well I remember when I was in school, I mean, there were kids that were coming to school and they really knew the computer 
R:  Mhm.
L:   very very well.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it was  and at that time the school was, um, talking about  this is about eleven, twelve years ago, and the school, I was in a parochial school, and the school was talking about, um, ah, at that time we had a computer, or a couple of computers in some of the classes, not my class, but in some of the  the math classes and the science classes, and, um, they were going to be putting, um, sort of like what you mentioned, a computer lab 
R:  Mhm.
L:   idea  
R:  Mhm.
L:   where there's classes with all
