R:  Hi, my name is Stephanie Seymour.  I'm, uh, calling in response to answer today's question, do I think any other countries are a threat to the United States? [SIGH] Ah, I really don't think any other countries, ah, aside those in the Middle East, who have M- Muslim extremism, um, will be a threat, and also North Korea, and also those who probably practice extreme communism.  Ah, but what I think is, mm, what I think is that there are, uh, some groups in Europe who probably don't support what the US is doing, I mean, aside from France and Germany, who have been very vocal about, uh, that they did not support [SIGH] what they are doing, [SIGH] what, uh, the US is doing in the war, um, but I do think there are other, uh, European countries that do not support us, um, I think, for the sake of diplomacy, they're not, uh, being vocal [SIGH], uh, nor are they going to strike against the US, because we've been very aggressive in those terms.  Um, but in terms of, uh, North Korea, I know North Korea has, uh, nuclear bombs, and I read somewhere that they were going to try to -- the US was going to have a front, um, at North Korea, and they're -- also it's been said that it's been a bad idea, because you can't [LIPSMACK] -- unfortunately the US can't be in two places at once, proverbially speaking, but I think if we give less attention to one or the other country, like less attention to the Middle East, uh, some of the -- some of the extremists who are against the US or some of Saddam's former followers, uh, will probably rise up again ... and battle the US forces, 'cause I do still -- I still think Saddam Hussein is still alive.  And I think he's in hiding.  He's probably hiding at the same place, uh, of Osama bin Laden, uh ... [SIGH] but other than that, I don't think any other count- countries aside from the -- I mean, a- aside from maybe small European organizations, 'cause they've been against it since day one.  I know Great Britain was really against it, in spite of, you know, Prime Minister Blair's impassioned pleas for, uh, for the British to help the US.  [SIGH] So, I -- I do think there is a lot of people, a lot of individuals in general who do not support the war, um, I do not support the war -- going, you know, going over there.  I mean, I hope the troops are safe, uh, you know, and I hope they come home soon.  I hope everything is a swift recovery, but in post war Iraq, you know, they don't even have a government now, it's pretty much -- the government is pretty much in ruins.  I -- I don't know they're -- how they will fare well in terms of having a democracy.  I think it'll take a long time before they get used to it.  So, I think a lot of the, uh, Middle Easterners, not just the Iraqi people, I'm sure many of 'em are glad that they're not under Saddam's regime, but I think many of the Middle Easterners, uh, don't support the fact that it is, blah, sorry, it is a democracy, 'cause I also have read in the paper, uh, one, uh, man, a business owner, made a comment, who lived in Egypt.  He said, you know, "They're -- many of the Arab, you know, uh, political regimes are dictatorial", so he said that's really nothing new, the fact that, you know, Saddam e- existed in power so long, not that he was supporting him, but he said, you know, "It's nothing new to -- to have this dictatorial regime" [LIPSMACK] but I really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- think that the fact that we went in there has ... of course, you know, soured relations with many of our countries -- I mean, many -- many other countries.  It's gonna be a long time before we repair it, if we can even repair it at all.  'Cause, you know -- 
L:  Well, Dr. Seymour, I'm Carol Crawfield and I agree with you on ver- very many things in regard to North Korea, which is a threat to the US, 'cause we've had soldiers in South Korea for years, ever since the Korean war, and they've been getting killed over there, um, couple of years ago that happened, and there have been skirmishes, uh, along the border for years.  Um, as far as the current agenda with the war in Iraq, I just think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as long as the US, uh, backs Israel and doesn't, um, help to establish a -- a state of Palestine, but all of the Middle East has been, um, um, using -- putting a face on their enemy and -- and the face is, uh, the US, the sole superpower.  Um, as far as whether or not we w- -- should have gone to war, I don't know what I would do if I were the President of the United States after nine eleven.  I used to work in the US Foreign Service, and was overseas for many years, so for the past twenty five years, both Europe and Africa and the Middle East have had, um, u- u- u- unt- -- unknown to most of the people in the US, acts of terrorism, and -- and quite a few, um, Americans were killed.  Some were targeted individually and, uh, some were at random, going all the way back to the Achilles Lauro.  What do we do, and how do we put a face on terrorism, so we say to the terrorists, "We will retaliate"?  I just don't know.  Um -- 
R:  Well, the terrorists have many faces [LAUGH] that's one of the problems.  I know, after nine eleven, um, you know, our government has [COUGH] declared the war on terror, which is all very noble and which is all very good, and we have to do that to protect our interests, but, you know, there's many forms of terrorism, and I mean, you know, you have the IRA, that's -- you know, that terrorizes Great Britain, you have terrorists in the US.  There's, you know, you can in- -- 
L:  Well, exactly.  And that's why -- that's why --
R:  -- you can insert, a- -- yeah, you can insert the name of any hate group. [LAUGH]  That's -- that's --
L:  Yeah, well, that's why Tony Blair even joined the United States, because the IRA has been quiet, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- since, uh, he joined with the US against terrorism, and also the Irish American community here, I know in Philadelphia and New York has stopped a- -- shipping money to the IRA, which for years they've done.
R:  Yes.  I -- I've heard that.  I've heard that, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there were bars in Boston that actually had collection jars --
L:  Right, and in New York --
R:  -- for the -- for the IRA.
L:  -- and in Philly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, in the Irish American clubs here in Philadelphia.  Um, that's where I live, in Philly.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, so, i- i- -- y- you know, the idea is, um, a- a- -- the thing that -- that really gets me as far as this goes, is I don't think that going to war with Iraq changed the Middle Eastern mind --
R:  No, it didn't.
L:  -- vis a vis the United States.  I don't think -- 
R:  Yeah, I -- I think it made it worse.  I think it gave us more of a reason to hate us, I think.  I -- you know?
L:  Yeah, see, I -- I -- I -- I really don't --
R:  And I think it's fear.
L:  -- I think it was, for a minute there, I think a- a- -- i- in -- I -- I mean, I -- well, I used to go to the Saudi embassy all the time, with the youngsters just joining the Foreign Service, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, we backed the Saudi -- and yet -- and yet they've really used us as a scapegoat.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, uh, money has been traced, it -- certainly to the Royal family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  There was an interesting interview with the Head -- retired head of Mosad.
R:  Mhm.
L:  In which he said that he really felt that the, um, the Middle East would -- would -- we would see changes in the Middle East by two thousand four, two thousand five.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that, um, probably the House of Saud would be overturned.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and a- a- a- and -- and we would be -- be dealing with Syria in some -- in some, uh, form or another.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, it was Libya who -- Pan -- who, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, bombed, uh, Pan Am one oh three, what was that, twelve or thirteen years ago?
R:  Mhm, right.
L:   And, um, I knew some parents who were very involved in that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And Moammar Gaddafi, I was in the country when Moammar Gaddafi was calling for a united Muslim Africa --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he's been quiet for years, but he went to Egypt not too long ago --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- maybe about -- within the past year, and his picture was in the paper with Mobaric --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so we really do have a lot of enemies who would harbor terrorists, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- Gaddafi being a known one.  Mobaric we give --
R:  Right, well, 'cause there is anti American sentiment in Egypt right now.  I -- I heard a story on NPR --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there were seven thousand men willing to join [NOISE] to fight against the US, but they, [NOISE] you know, technically, the -- on the diplomatic level they can't, because Egypt is a- allied to the US.
L:  Well, I think, after Israel, most of our foreign aid goes to Egypt.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think it's number two, which is amazing.  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- although I --
