R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  This is -- 
R:  Hi. [NOISE] 
L:  Hi, this is Dee from Atlanta. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, hi, Dee, my name's Alisa, I live in Manhattan campus.
L:  Oh, okay.  What's your name?
R:  Alisa. [NOISE] 
L:  Alisa, okay.
R:  Yeh. [NOISE] 
L:  Um, so what are your thoughts on the subject?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Do you think -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  We're threatened by any other countries?
R:  Um, I -- I wouldn't say that I think another country is a threat, I think there are probably individual [inaudible] -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- that are a threat, but I -- I wouldn't say I'm scared of another coun- not like the cold war, you know, with Russia, everybody was frightened of it, but.  What do you think?
L:  Well, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, [SIGH] I -- I -- I feel that way sort of.  I don't think a whole country will, you know, try to harm us, but -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I do feel like -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a large number of people, from where I don't really know [LAUGH] because we are not the most popular people -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- at the time --
R:  [LAUGH] Exact--
L:  -- but I do believe that this is not the end of it --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for some reason I do think that the Middle East will revive.  I think that, um, you know, the two people we're looking for the most, the most wanteds, Osama and Saddam, I think they will maybe get together and -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- we will hear from them again.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's -- I hadn't thought about that.  That would be a frightening thing. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, it's going to be very frightening. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, I -- 
L:  But, um, you know, I feel like they're not just going to go away that easily.
R:  Yeah, that's true --  
L:  You know?
R:  -- it does seem like everything kinda went a little bit too easily -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in Iraq.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, it will be interesting to see how it all plays out.  The other thing that kinda worries me is the fact that, like, France and Germany weren't behind us in going into Iraq and then you think, okay, if there's another country out there and they start getting countries like Germany and France on their side, there's the possibility that [NOISE], you know, be--
L:  Yeah, but do you think France and Germany would go to that extreme though?
R:  I don't think so at this point, no, but just the fact that they were so vocal about how much they thought we were wrong, how wrong they thought we were, it kinda -- 
L:  Well, you know, to me it's, um, it's a cultural th- [MN] I can't talk -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it's a cultural thing --  
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- because, um, if you really think about the Germans and, um, you know, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the French people they are, you know, they have certain ways of doing things and they're just, you know, a knack for doing this, they have to do it this way or it's not done, you know, -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, to me I really think and I totally agreed with them, we were not supposed to be attacking [LAUGH] them at the time we did that. 
R:  Right. 
L:  We didn't give the talking long enough to take hold.
R:  Yeah, I agree -- 
L:  So, um, I don't think France or Germany will ever go to -- go with an extremist group like that -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I think they're gonna always be the ones sitting on the fence scared to lose what they have, scared to get involved and wanting everybody to do things their way, but, um, I don't think they'll ever, you know, group up with, you know, someone that extreme. 
R:  Yeah, I don't think someone that extreme, but just they're -- I think there's definitely a -- a small opening in the doorway for -- for people to gang up on America.  But I don't -- I mean, that's not something that I would lose sleep over it at all. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But ... [MN] 
L:  Um, I do expect to see something else, you know, but like you, I'm -- I'm with you, I'm not going to, um, ruin the quality of my life by fearing for my life, you know, on a daily basis or whatever, I'm just going to, you know, keep it in the back of my mind that, you know, I need to try to be as safe as possible and -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- I think finally we're taking a right step as far as, you know, putting reinforced doors in cockpits and, you know, things of this nature.  So, um, I'm not going to sweat that, but I do believe they will be back.
R:  Yeah.  I mean I do think -- I think, you know, with all the measures they're taking, [NOISE] I think a lot of it is for the public as opposed to it -- because I feel like if they -- if somebody really wanted to, you know, hijack another airplane and crash it into a building they would be able to do it and the safety measures they're -- 
L:  It would be --  
R:  -- seeking -- 
L:  -- so much harder though.
R:  Mm, yeah, that's true, that is true, but -- 
L:  See, before -- 
R:  -- I just think things are -- 
L:  -- they didn't meet with any resistance whatsoever.
R:  [LAUGH] That's true [LAUGH] it was tougher -- 
L:  And this time would be so much harder to do, you know?
R:  Yeah, that is tru- I just think it's funny that, you know, you get on the airplane and they won't give you, ah, a real knife, they'll give you a plastic knife, but they'll give you a fork and a spoon, I -- I'm like, "Can't you do more damage with a fork than you could with a knife?" [LAUGH] But I think things like that [MN] I think it's more for public -- like the public than it is actually being that effective, but -- but I would say like I'm more, ah, frightened of terrorists, you know, small radical groups of people doing things like bombing, you know, terrorist activities than I am of an actual another country ever coming in and taking over America or starting a war here or anything like that. 
L:  Yeah.  I -- I think -- 
R:  Ah, [inaudible] --
L:  -- ah, the -- it wouldn't be a whole country, I don't -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have that fear whatsoever.  I think it would be, you know, ah, nuclear that, you know, everybody got together and say, "Let's go do this to the US because they did this and they did that and" -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, they -- they have some points, they have some good points. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's true. [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, so, um, -- 
R:  But then you've got to think of the countries that used to be super powers and, you know, they -- obviously they sell because we're, you know, they major super power now and we weren't always so it's interesting -- it can happen, but I definitely think we're raised here in the US kinda with the idea that we're indestructible and, you know.
L:  But you know that's stupid.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That -- that is stupid and I think our government have -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, really done us a grave injustice by orienting us to that lifestyle. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because in my opinion if we had -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- had always -- and think about al- when you travel abroad, all of these places have some type of measures that they take, you can only go so far if you don't have a ticket in the airport and things like that, you know, -- 
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  -- we didn't do any of that -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, "We're the best, we're the baddest and we can do whatever we want, whenever we want" -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and they just walked right in and took away a bunch of our people -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, um, to me they really have done us more harm -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- than good -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- by not really -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- exposing us -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to terrorism in the past because it has always been there. 
R:  Oh, I know, also when they say they had an idea of what was going to happen [NOISE] and they just didn't want to -- 
L:  I know --  
R:  -- frighten people -- 
L:  Can you imagine?  
R:  -- it's like, "Hello?" [LAUGH] 
L:  But how dumb are we?
R:  [LAUGH] I know, I almost think that our own government is more of a danger to us sometimes than another country's government would be. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know how that goes, everybody's entitled to think what they want and we're so busy fussing among ourselves after what we want, we really can't even get, you know, out of the door way -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- you know, to address -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- bigger problems like terrorism -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but I think terrorism is here to stay and, um, so far it seems like they're stepping to the plate, taking all -- you know -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a lot of precautions -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- not all, but -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- you know, I think -- as I said, it seems we really need to get with them and go with the flow, you know -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- because when you travel now so many people are complaining -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- about the wait -- 
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- and everything else, I mean just sort of hold it in and go with it, you know, because I'd rather go through that than them not having any sanctions in place at all.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, exactly, and those are probably the same people that would be complaining if there was no, you know, -- 
L:  Exactly -- 
R:  -- [several inaudible words] in place -- 
L:  Exactly -- 
R:  -- but it's very frustrating to hear that --  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- like, "We're all going through the same thing, it doesn't help when you're complaining about this".  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, you know, the demeanor is totally different they just sort of stand there with a scowl on their face because -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, they have to be two hours earlier, an hour earlier, whatever, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, to me terrorism is not going to dissipate --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it has always been there, we were just naive to the fact -- 
R:  Yeah, exac- --
L:  -- you know, the public was.  Our leaders knew what was going on but, you know, like you said, they didn't want to bother us, they didn't want us -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- to think that we were at risk in any way and -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- then all of a sudden, boom -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and now, you know, we got to be faced -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- with it, we got to stand up and take notice of what's going on and how much do we really love our country.
R:  Yeah, exactly -- 
L:  -- you know?
R:  Yeah, I -- I'm really surprised at the impact it had on kinda patriotism within the US how -- how all of a sudden everybody was just pro America and -- and I think it was starting to fade a little bit and then the war happened and now it's really back up again, but -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- that's a really interesting kinda consequence of all this, is [LAUGH] -- 
L:  It -- it sort of appears to me and, you know, I guess I'm conditioned as an American also, I just stayed at that, they conditioned us to be a certain way and -- but, um, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, I'm -- I'm that way and to me they're only doing it [LAUGH] because of the war, when it's over it'll all be gone, you know? 
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- until something else happens [LAUGH] 
L:  I know, I know, you won't see everybody wearing red and white and -- 
R:  I know. 
L:  -- blue. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But it shouldn't take that -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to bring us together. 
R:  No, it shouldn't, it really shouldn't, but -- but I must say that was -- that was one thing that was really nice after, especially nine eleven was -- 
L:  Oh, yeah, -- 
R:  -- amazing how everybody just pulled together and -- because I think -- I mean I have -- I'm twenty seven and I have -- I don't think I've ever felt that in my life, you know, there hasn't been one kinda singular event to define, you know, -- 
L:  Well, it was -- 
R:  -- define my life yet -- 
L:  -- it was pretty much so [inaudible] and Desert Storm, you know, we went over -- 
R:  That's, t- [MN]-- 
L:  -- to rescue Kuwait and everything and everybody was really pro American.
R:  [LIPSMACK] That's true, it just seems like --
