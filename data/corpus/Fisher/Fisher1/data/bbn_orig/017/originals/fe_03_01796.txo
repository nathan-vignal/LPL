R:  Hello?
L:  Hi. 
R:  Hi, I'm Jennifer.
L:  I'm Tina.  How are you?
R:  Pretty good, how are you?
L:  I'm doing well, thank you.
R:  So what are you --
L:  This is my fir- go ahead.  This is my first call, so I'm --
R:  Yeah, me too. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, good. 
R:  Um, so what, what do you feel about, ah, computers in education?
L:  Well, I think -- I actually am a former first grade teacher --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and I think they can be beneficial in some areas, and I think, um, I have seen teachers plug their kids in to computers too often [LAUGH] at school, rather than actually teaching them, so I think they can be deterring too.  So, ah, do you have any feelings about them? 
R:  Ah, yeah, I, I'm kind of a plus and minus myself too.  I mean, it, it's good to, um, keep up with technology and everything else --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but on the other hand I think, um, kids are having a problem writing --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know, they -- their writing fails because their typing skills are up, you know, so I think it's --
L:  And I've actually had a child tell me that.  "Well, I don't need to practise my handwriting because my mom says I'm just gonna use a computer later on in life".
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  It's like, "Okay, short of being a doctor, I'm not sure your co workers are gonna be real tolerant of that".  So.
R:  Yeah, I don't think, ah, many people, they've gone so much to emailing and everything else, they don't write as much, so I think, you know --
L:  Well and I think -- and I think in email sometimes they tend to lose out on grammar.
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And that drives me nuts.  I'm one of those people, I'm thinking, "I can get six year olds to capitalize and use punctuation, you know, you're thirty plus years old".
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I think, I think we get into a different mind set with the computer.  It's like, "Oh, all those grammar rules don't apply to me", and it's like, "Well yeah, hello".
R:  Yeah.
L:  "Capital letter at the beginning of the sentence, say way as it's been since you were five". [LAUGH]
R:  Yep. [LAUGH]
L:  So.  But I also can see, you know, I -- I made a joke to somebody a while back, um, I did my masters in education, and it was right when compu- five or six years when computers became available at our school, and she had hand typed hers, and I thought, "Oh, my gosh, can you imagine hand typing eighty pages" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and you know, the kids here do res- in, in our area do research papers, and I thought, "Can you even imagine typing ten pages of a paper, making a mistake, and having to type a whole page over again".
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So I could see where they're definitely convenient for kids, but, but you know, the internet's another big scary thing.  We --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- you know, we had a couple of very -- highly intelligent sixth grader hack into some sites that they probably sh- oh, there's no probably, they shouldn't have been in, and it's like, "Okay".
R:  Oh, no.
L:  Because unfortunately almost -- I mean the younger kids are smarter than the adults when it comes to computers.
R:  Oh, yeah, because they've been practising on, on them a lot more than we have, you know, it's --
L:  Yep.  Many -- much more experience.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's scary.  So.
R:  I mean, it's good that they can, you know, get on with the, the news and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and check things all around the world.  I mean, that's, that's something that we haven't had.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I didn't have when I was growing up.  I mean --
L:  No, I didn't either.
R:  -- we had the actual programs on the computers when I was in grade school, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you had no access to actually live, um, live news or anything that you can do research papers.  I mean, now you can grab stuff from all over the place, and --
L:  Right.  And I, I, um, I was telling -- my sister also teaches -- she teaches high school English, and I was telling her lately -- recently, I said, "You know, the scary thing is when I was in junior high school, the big thing was not the computer, the big thing was the electric typewriter --" 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and who got to use the electric typewriters in typing class that day".  She was, like, "You're kidding, right?"  I'm like, "No, we've come so far so fast, sometimes I wonder if we've kept, you know, the control of, of it under, you know, as we're going so fast it's hard to, to know, you know, where do we need to be watching kids and what do you need to be monitoring with kids, and, and things like that".  So.  But I do think, you know, they're definitely beneficial and it definitely makes things easier.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, --
R:  And it gets them ready for a lot of the stuff out in the real world, in the jobs.  I mean, you can't go anywhere without --
L:  No.
R:  -- needing typing skills of a certain speed and everything else, and they wouldn't have that if they didn't have the practise --
L:  Well, they think --
R:  -- on the --
L:  -- as a society our speed is -- you know, our typing speed is, is increasing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on, on a daily basis.  So that's -- I mean, that's very good to prepare them for later on in life.  It's just sometimes that, that adult control sometimes needs to be there, I think.
R:  Yeah, there definitely needs to be supervision on, ah, --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- on the computer.
L:  So.  Especially I think with the littler ones.  'Cause I think sometimes -- well even the bigger ones.  I think they'll go in and do it on purpose.  But I know sometimes with the littler ones, they get places they don't know how they've got -- I mean, you know, they get places they don't know how they've gotten to, and --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- they're not afraid to push buttons. [LAUGH] That's what I always used to say, "How did you get there"?  Well, I don't know, I just started pushing buttons".  And I thought, "Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Let me just call the office and let them know that this was an accident". [LAUGH] So.  But, but it definitely has its, you know, its advantages and conveniences.  So.  Let's see.  What other advantages for education could we have.  Or disadvantages.  Um, well, it definitely makes note passing easier for kids in school.
R:  Oh yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I hadn't thought about that.  But yeah, I guess that, you know, I don't know if that's good or bad.  I mean, I guess we all did it when we were in school, passing the little, the little notes along about heaven only knows what.  So.
R:  Yeah, like in, in, in college courses and stuff, it's a lot easier to, ah, keep up with things on the, on the computer --
L:  Right.
R:  -- rather than, you know, in -- um, a lot of people bring laptops and everything else into the things and take notes during the, the lectures.
L:  Oh, that would be a good -- I -- see I guess I'm way out of the loop --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I didn't even think about that.  And you know, it does make it a little easier for people, you know, like stay at home parents and things to get educated.  You can, you know, go ahead and take computer classes over the internet and things like that if you, you know, have access in your home.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  I, I have a couple of friends who just finished some continuing education classes on the computer and they were like, "This is the weirdest thing. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You don't talk to anybody".  I thought, "Oh, my goodness".
R:  Yeah, I took a course, um, at home like that in addressing.  I took it through my work, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I could do it from home and do the studying and stuff, and it really did, you know, improve how my -- how I worked, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, taking a -- and taking classes, um, on line and through your home and stuff, and just keep edu- just to keep my brain working, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I'm a stay at home mom also right now, and so it's like, it's really hard to -- I don't want my brain to turn to mush. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I know.  I know exactly what you're saying.  I, ah, -- 'cause that's what they say.  Well, you know, you don't have to -- I was a, first -- ah, teacher, and they said, well you know -- when I quit, my district said, "You don't have to go back and get any more education hours for twelve or fifteen years or something, 'cause of your masters".  And I thought, I may need to go back to school just to keep my brain, you know, flowing in that process.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And the convenience of going, you know, just being able to do it from my -- you know, my home, and do it on line, [NOISE] you know, will, will definitely help in prep- preparing me to go back into the workforce one day.  So.  But --
R:  I think there's a lot of good, um, programs on the computer that can be good for teaching tools.  I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there, ah, like Powerpoint and Access programs that, you know, help get people more organized with their -- I mean, you can store recipes, you can store --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, you know --
L:  And there's a lot --
R:  -- exercise routines, everything on there.
L:  And there's a lot of good programs for young children.
R:  Yeah.
L:  As long as, I think, it's not overused, you know, the little -- the repetition is so good for them, and the fact that you can program things.  I remember one -- my last year of teaching we had gotten some program, and I can't even remember what it was called, but you could program it so that it would change with the level -- the child's learning levels.  And I thought, now this is -- this is a great way that everybody can be exactly where they need to be.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, if, if -- once you pass the level you got to go on to the next level.  So, it made it very easy for kids that needed a little bit more to get a little bit more, and it made it easy for kids that needed to, um, maybe go over the same things, you know, for the fourth or fifth time.  It gave them the ability to do that too.  So, the repetition was there if they needed it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So.  Let's see.  We said research, it was very helpful with research.
R:  Yep.  I've, I've a friend who does, um, I guess pre school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, training for her kid, um teaching them how to read.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and in that case, I mean, it works --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but yet, she doesn't read to them out of an actual book then that often either, so it's a lot more, you know, on line learning sentences, learning grammar -- 
L:  But then they're not --
R:  -- they use different sort of programs, but they're not actually picking up the actual book anymore.  So --
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean, it's, it can -- I mean, it's a plus --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but then [LAUGH] I mean --
L:  They're, they're still together reading, but you know, by the same token it's not out of a -- you know, I think.
R:  Yeah exactly.  If something were to happen with technology and all the computers in the world were shut down, then what are people going to work on, you know.
L:  That's exactly it.  And I think --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, as, I mean, as kids come up and get older, they become more dependent on the computers too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Whereas, you know, if my computer died and my internet access, my DSL line died tomorrow, it would kind of be a bummer, but it wouldn't, you know, wouldn't be the end of the world --
R:  It won't be the end of the world, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- 'cause [LAUGH] we've been there before
