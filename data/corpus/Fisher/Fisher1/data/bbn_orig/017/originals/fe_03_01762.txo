R:  Hi, ah, my name's Moxi.
L:  And I'm Dawn.
R:  Hi, how are you this evening?
L:  Not bad, how are you?
R:  Very good, thanks.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We have an interesting topic to talk about.
L:  We sure do. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I didn't hear anything when I first called in, they didn't say what it was, so I was just holding to find out.  Did you know ahead of time?
L:  Um, they -- yeah, they -- the first thing they said was foreign relations.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah, I just heard that. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, I guess we're talking about any cou- -- any country that would be a threat to -- 
L:  A threat.
R:  -- our security, right?
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, there's a lot of that going around right now, I guess, with Iraq.
L:  There sure is.
R:  Yeah, it's rather scary.
L:  There sure is, and I bet they're still a threat.
R:  I think so, I think it's gonna be a -- a standard procedure from now on.  I think that we're gonna have to change our -- our security system.  I'm glad they have made some changes now, you know, major changes and a -- a new department now.
L:  Right.
R:  That's, ah, been set up.  I feel a lot more secure. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I think the airlines could probably still do a couple more things, but, you know, they can only do so much without having to pretty much handcuff everybody that goes on board. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know, I know, there's plenty of room for improvement and I'm sure over the next few years we will see a big difference.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  And hopefully they will be able to speed up the, um, airlines a little bit too and it would be, ah, a nice thing.
L:  That definitely would be a plus. 
R:  A lot of people travel, you know, are complaining about that.  Of course, you know, I can understand, um, you know, with everything that's been going on.
L:  Yeah, maybe even having stricter policies as to who is allowed to enter and leave.
R:  Right -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- yeah, I think so, and I understand that some of the, um, airlines are carrying though, ah, guns too on [inaudible] --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, which is, you know, it's kind of controversial there I guess too, whether it's a good thing or a bad thing but --  
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- myself I think I feel a little bit more secure actually.
L:  I do too.  I travelled, um, September sixteenth, no September fourteenth -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- right after the twin towers went down and -- 
R:  I -- I was on, um, -- I came home on -- on that ninety three flight.  I was supposed to be on a different one and they sent me on and, um, it was like three days before September eleventh.
L:  Wow.
R:  And, ah, it was such an odd feeling 'cause I took that Pittsburgh flight, I was supposed to fly from Chicago to, ah, Philadelphia and they had changed it to a Pittsburgh flight and, um, it was the first time I was away for, um, some time.  My daughter's young yet and, ah, when I got home and after we heard about that my husband said "No more flights for you for a long time".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It kind of shook him up a good bit after we -- you know, we heard what had happened.
L:  Exactly, well we had flights for September fourteenth and I had actually cancelled it. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- until my daughter convinced me that it was probably the safest time to fly and -- 
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  -- and we ended up rescheduling.
R:  Did you, did you actually go then, you just kind of postponed it for a little bit.
L:  I went but I -- yeah, I went but it wasn't easy. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, but the rates --  
L:  It just -- it was -- I mean there were about six people on the plane.
R:  Yeah, the rates, the travel rates were really low at that time too.  They were out there, you know, advertising low rates all over the country.
L:  Yeah.
R:  To get people to go.  I know, you know, a lot of people that were kind of bold, you know, they were out there travelling quite a bit and using those free rates -- low rates for, you know, a few travel trips.
L:  Right, [LAUGH] right, I'm not sure. 
R:  I mean other countries too, you know, we -- we do have, you know, a different kind of outlook on the countries since we had September eleventh and I think, you know, all -- all around the board they're gonna probably, ah, you know, make sure that we're safe and -- and check, you know, security all over, you know, other various countries, China, um, other countries too I guess that, you know, may -- may be of some type of threat to us.
L:  Right.  I am just hoping that nothing gets as worse as it does -- did September eleventh -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but they say we're supposed to still have sparse things here and there but --  
R:  Yeah, I -- I guess until they get the bugs out, you know, we're gonna probably always have that over our head now.
L:  Exactly.  Well, you say you've got small -- a small child.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's them that you -- we have to worry about, you know, because it can still go on even, you know, as they become adults, it can still be going on and ...
R:  Right, ah, they're gonna have a different outlook all together than what we did growing up as kids, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, you know, not just travel wise but just -- I mean we live close to, um, it's -- we can actually see the, ah, nuclear power plant from our home here.
L:  Oh, does that worry you? 
R:  In Pennsylvania and actually -- well, we -- we kind of keep a positive outlook on it, you know.  We -- we just say if anything happened we would be among the very first and we probably wouldn't even know what was going on -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- you know, if there was any -- any problem, I mean as far as it blowing up but we, ah, have state police manning it twenty four hours a day, you know, and, ah, armed guards.
L:  Has it always been that way or just recently? 
R:  No, just since Sep- September eleventh.
L:  Really.
R:  Right, yeah -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- they've been out there, um, you know, twenty four hours a day, um, manning that.  They have, ah, gates up and they check every vehicle that goes in there.
L:  Well, that helps to feel more secure.
R:  It does, it definitely does.  The state police have been really, you know, busy here in the area.  What part of the country are you call- calling from? 
L:  Actually, I'm in Alcart[?] Indiana.
R:  Oh, how nice.
L:  But we're pretty -- we're like three hours from a power -- from a power plant but we've got the major heart of the Conrail system here so ... 
R:  Uh-huh, well there's a security thing too I guess, you know.
L:  Well, actually we haven't noticed anything in security changes, I mean more planes flying over but --  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I mean not commercial but as opposed to [NOISE] -- I'm thinking armed forces, things like that but ... 
R:  Well trains are getting a little bit more busy here in Pennsylvania.
L:  Really.
R:  Um, we see a lot more trains going through the area than, you know, in the last few years.  It -- it seems like they are trying to get rid of all the truck traffic here in the area so, um, you know, just recently there has been actually some accidents where people were, ah, killed, ah, in cars where they don't have, um, very good security I guess in this way -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- because, um, they weren't -- they weren't stopping and they were going over the tracks and there was a train that hit them a few times.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  There was one incident where an elderly man, his car stalled on the railroad track and I guess he did get out of the car in time but, um, --  
L:  Lucky.
R:  -- just recently they started putting up some, ah, gates and, um, some -- some signs to -- to warn people because, you know, we haven't been used to so many trains and we can actually hear them a few times a day.  They are a few miles from our house but, you know, you -- you can hear the noise.  And I -- I like the train sound but, you know, when you think about these things, you know, going on as far as, ah, you know, that type of security -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- they are making some improvements, ah, it's not a -- a cou- -- another country threatening or, you know, our security though.
L:  Right, not now. [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, I can't really think, I mean as far as any kind of other travelling that people would do, ah, can you think of any other travelling that, ah, would, you know, threaten our security that they have been up in the news talking about lately? 
L:  Besides the -- the tractor trailers that they have been talking about.
R:  Have they?  Uh-huh.  
L:  Um, I -- my husband is a truck driver as a matter of fact.
R:  Is he, yeah.
L:  -- but he drives local and they have all been told, you know, lock your doors and -- and just be careful and ... 
R:  And, ah, what are they actually looking for then?  Is it, um, people from Iraq or, ah, --  
L:  Mainly, yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Yes.
R:  I wasn't even aware of that.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's an interesting point because I -- I hadn't heard anything in our area here about that at all and I know some people that have that occupation too, I will have to ask them then.
L:  It's just -- 
R:  I know -- I know they had said in the news before about they were asking the truck drivers to keep an eye on things that were going around, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Where they -- wherever they were travelling that they saw anything suspicious.
L:  Right.  Gosh, I couldn't imagine what tractor trailers could do with a damage, you know, compared to an airplane.  I mean, I know what planes can do now but -- 
R:  Right.
L:  I mean trucks and buildings like that from the ground is --  will be just as bad. 
R:  Right, and I -- you know, even here with this, ah, nuclear power plant, ah, my husband said before it's a good thing that they have so many, ah, gates up and everything in case anybody would come with a tractor trailer truck maybe with some type of chemicals or explosives and just try to break through the gates -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and get in there.
L:  Gosh, I don't even want to think about the damage -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it can do. [LAUGH]
R:  But, as far as any other type of security in our country, I am trying to think of anything else that -- ah, beside the travel part.
L:  That's what I'm doing too.
R:  Can you think of anything else, I mean as far as I guess, um, you know, definitely the, ah, germs that, you know, and the chemical, ah, --  
L:  Oh, the chemical, yeah.
R:  -- threat, I mean, that was rather scary too --  
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- when we had that scare in the country --  
L:  When -- when they were telling us to buy plastic and -- and, um, duct tape. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know, I know, they had made a -- the horrendous amount of sales on that, didn't they? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I guess the -- well, just right now too with the boats too, we have, um, we are in Berwick Pennsylvania and they have one of the biggest, ah, ah, bow plants, they make gift bows and yellow ribbons are -- are like really, really selling quite a lot now.
L:  Oh, I bet. 
R:  With everyone's patriotism.
L:  Oh, wow, well that's a good thing though. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it is.  In -- in that part of it I guess as far as the security scare, you know, it's to our advantage, you know.  As far as that part and the economy, there are, you know, some changes like the flag sales and everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I know that, you know, we had that, um, scare in the mail a while back, you know, people were, um, exposing themselves to, ah, -- now what was it, I'm trying to think of the name of it.
L:  The anthrax.
R:  Right, the anthrax scare and that kind of died down, ah, a good bit.
L:  Yeah, it did.  It -- it just -- it left as quick as it came.
R:  Right, and that was really scary to me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was getting close, I mean, um, you know, Baltimore, Maryland area isn't that far from Pennsylvania really.
L:  Right, right.
R:  But, um, they never did come to any conclusion about, you know, who it was that was sending that either.
L:  Right.
R:  I know last time I heard there was one man that, um, they were looking into, I guess he had some past experience working with the government.  Do you recall that?
L:  No, I don't.
R:  And, um, they had --
