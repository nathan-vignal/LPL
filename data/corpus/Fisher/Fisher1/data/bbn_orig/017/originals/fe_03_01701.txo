R:  Hello --
L:  Ah --
R:  -- I'm Rodney.
L:  Hi Rodney, I'm Wanda.
R:  Hi Wanda.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um --
L:  So, we're talking about the Middle East today?
R:  Talking about the Middle East.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, golly.  I don't really know much about it.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, do you --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you feel we should be at war or shouldn't be?
L:  Well, it sounds like the war is pretty much ending.
R:  Okay, I agree.
L:  Yeah.  Um, I don't know, I don't think we can keep jumping in and saving everybody, but ... [SIGH] oh, I don't know.  You know, y- you can't just keep taking over countries and making them do things the way you want, but then again, it doesn't seem right to sit back and -- and let, you know, dictators --
R:  Right.
L:  -- ruin the lives of a lot of people either.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I don't know.  You know, now they're talking about, what if we're going to go into, you know, some other place and it's, like, "Ah".
R:  Right, they're talking about, ah, Syria.
L:  Right, yeah.  I heard that today, and you know, how many more are we going to do?  So --
R:  Exactly.
L:  Um --
R:  And it's -- it's such a -- I think the President is doing a -- a spectacular job with what he's -- with what he's dealt --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, but I'm glad it's him and not me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because I r- -- honestly don't know what I would do.  So -- because I agree in -- w- on one hand that, you know, we can't just sit back and let people do whatever they want because eventually, you know, the whole Sep -- not to, you know, bring a bunch of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- stuff down, but the whole September eleven thing w- would happen again if we just sat back and let people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- do what they wanted.
L:  But do you think that we ever would have gone in and done anything if they hadn't attacked us first?
R:  Um, I'm not sure.  That's a good question.
L:  We -- this whole Israel thing, this has been going on forever --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and we don't touch that.  And as far as I know, we never got involved in Ireland's problems so, you know, how long would we have let this go if they never attacked us?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know.  I just --
R:  That's a good question, that's really good.
L:  I would just kind of like to see the same amount of money that's spent on us saving other countries spent on people in this country.
R:  On our own country, yes.
L:  You know, or -- or reduce our taxes, either way. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  It's just -- there are people here with big problems too, and instead we're setting aside billions of dollars to help out other countries that don't want us there, and don't care about us and it just doesn't seem quite right.
R:  I agree, I agree.  But, like I said, it's a difficult ... thing to do.  I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I think, like, being a parent.  I mean, I'm not a parent, but I know that it's, you know, you get so many different options to do and there's really no manual for it. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, and I, you know, I think there's probably a lot of information that we never hear.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, there are things going on that only the people at the top, you know, have any inkling of.
R:  Right.
L:  And that probably makes a difference.
R:  Yes, very much, very much.
L:  So [SIGH], huh ...
R:  Well, do you know anybody that is over there, or --
L:  Nope.
R:  Nope?
L:  Which I think, you know, makes it pretty impersonal for me.
R:  Yes, probably so.
L:  And then being so far from New York, I -- I think that a lot of what happened on September eleventh is just, like, you know, a -- a TV story. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it's not quite as real as -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- as for people who are in that area.
R:  Exactly.  May I ask what state you're --
L:  I'm in Wisconsin.
R:  Wisconsin?
L:  Yep.
R:  Okay, I'm in California.
L:  Yeah, I keep getting California --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- late at night, I think 'cause there's probably not a lot of mid Western people who said, "Oh yeah, call me till midnight". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It's probably the case, yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  That's probably the case.
L:  So, being more cut off from -- from New York, I -- I -- I think it, you know, it's not as personal, you don't really --
R:  Right.
L:  -- feel it the same way.  I've talked to friends who, you know, lived within sight of the World Trade Center who are -- are really affected by it and it's, like, "Okay, fine, whatever", you know?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  It feels like it's, uh, I agree that it's almost like watching a movie, instead of it being, um, anything, and especially the way which -- in one hand I really like the fact of now that we have all of these reporters embedded in with the troops --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so it gives us a picture for history and, you know, so that we can kind of see what's going on and everything, but we see so much of it that it doesn't seem as much like -- as it's a really big issue.  I mean, it is a big issue, but it --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- just seems like, you know, well, now they started taking it off, but the first week there, you know, every channel that you turned, it was on and there was --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, twenty thousand reporters in with the troops and it just didn't seem as, like you said, a- as a -- surreal, I guess.
L:  Right.  I think that, like, the movie you watch, uh, Saving Private Ryan. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You wa- -- I watched that and it made, you know, the whole pain of -- of war and the danger and what people went through, it all seemed so real, and yet I don't even get that from these people who are in the middle of the battle. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  It's just -- I don't know if they're just cleaning it up for us probably, you know, they're not showing us the -- the -- the gritty kind of stuff.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And ... um, I don't know if you were, you know, how old you were during the whole Vietnam thing, but we used to hear more about how many people died --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know?  And here, this time it seems like occasionally you'd hear, "Okay, something happened here and a couple of people died" and maybe if some of them had been local, I would have heard more about it too, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it was just like it was glossed over.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And I don't know --
R:  And then for me, it's not so much of the case for -- in that aspect, because I -- I was in the military, um, I'm pretty young, I'm twenty three.
L:  Wow.
R:  Um, I'll have a birthday here soon.
L:  Yay.
R:  Um [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but I have a lot of my friends who are actually over there right now.
L:  Oh, so it's personal for you?
R:  Exactly, um, and I live really close to, uh, to the base here, so it's very much in the news, um, just our local news.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, where -- it's San Diego is the, uh, port.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  So there's a lot of --
L:  Yeah, you've got a lot of military there.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Right.  Yeah --
R:  Um --
L:  -- here in Wisconsin, not so much --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Right, exactly.  Yeah, I grew up in Louisiana so I can -- can --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- fully understand.  I joined the Marines, 'cause I didn't know any Marine. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Be the first in your crowd. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  Um, so, yeah, I -- I have, on, you know, I can think in terms of I've seen the information that we -- the guys get and what they're dealt -- they're dealt with, and I know the situation that they're in, but I don't really agree with what they're in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, because I don't, you know ...
L:  Well, maybe as somebody in the military, you can give me a perspective on this.  We had news stories about, you know, "Oh, what happens to the kids when mom and dad go to war?" and my feeling was, before mom and dad got sent to -- before they had kids --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they should have thought about what's going to happen if they have go to war.
R:  Right.
L:  And I -- I was having a real hard time feeling sorry for these military families that had to leave their children behind.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's, like, don't -- don't people in the milit- -- I mean, if you're in the military, both the husband and the wife, you mean, don't you have to give some thought to the possibility that it's not always going to be peace time? 
R:  I agree.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I -- myself, like I said, I'm -- we do not -- I'm married, and no, we do not have a- any children yet, um, but I waited -- I got married while I was in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, but I'm now out, I just did my four years and -- but I kind of look at that as maybe being in the poli- -- on the police force.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, because, on a normal day to day basis, you, you know, how often -- when's the last time that we've actually been -- had any really -- dealings?  The most people are joining the military, I mean, and myself included --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- are joining the military because of the benefits, because of going to school and it's a --
L:  Right.
R:  -- stepping stone in life.
L:  And never even thinking about the possibility that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you might have to actually fight a war?
R:  Exactly.
L:  I think that --
R:  I -- I think a lot of people think about it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but they don't really plan as much for it.
L:  Yeah, it could be an age thing, you know?  Because being old enough to -- I was in my t- -- you know, early teens during --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the Vietnam thing, and so I remember the selective service.
R:  Right.
L:  I remember, you know, boys being drafted, and I -- I think that gives you a little bit of a different view on it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because you know they're being taken from their families, and they're being put into war.
R:  Right.
L:  So, you know, I see the military as, you know, think about it, because you could get killed. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I can see now where, you know, these days where -- where it has been peaceful for so long, you know, it just seems like a -- a, you know, a good way to go and -- and get your education paid for and stuff.
R:  Very much, very much.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  I even, you know, I have friends who -- who say, "Well --", ah, one in particular who said -- she told her son that when he gets out of high school, he's either going to college or he's joining the military, and that's, like, you know, they -- they don't even see it as, "I might be sending him off to be killed". [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Gee.
R:  And al- although in that, I know the flip side --
