L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi, my name is David. 
L:  My name's Kim. [NOISE]  
R:  Hi.  Did you hear, ah, "Threat to" what?  Did you hear the last word?
L:  I think to the US. 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I think she'd said. 
R:  I didn't know what she meant by -- 
L:  [NOISE]  
R:  -- "Any other countries" [MN] 
L:  I don't know. 
R:  I guess -- 
L:  I'm not really sure.
R:  Well, ah, I guess, there's we can -- 
L:  I guess [MN] --  
R:  -- we can all agree that China might be a threat.
L:  I guess to us -- 
R:  Or North Korea.
L:  [MN] 
R:  Or, ah, -- 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] let me see what else.  Um, -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  Iran. 
L:  A -- a threat to us though, right?
R:  Right.  Those are the -- it -- well, you know, President Bush he called, "The axis of evil".
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  He said that six months ago he -- he said Iran and North Korea were the biggest threats.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, North -- 
R:  That Iraq th--
L:  -- Korea?
R:  What?
L:  I didn't hear that, North Korea. 
R:  Yeah, North Korea is a big threat cause they just acquired nuclear weapons. 
L:  [NOISE] Oh. 
R:  And, ah, they also, um, -- Iraq used to be a threat but no longer I guess [LAUGH] because the last -- it's over since last week.
L:  [NOISE] Well, I don't know I still they'd be a threat [NOISE] 
R:  They can't because we just won the war.
L:  Oh, I don't know. 
R:  You think so?
L:  Yep.
R:  But I don't think any country w- is really a big threat to the United States.  The United States is too powerful now.
L:  You think so?
R:  Yeah, the only thing that th- that's really is scary is terrorist threat, like wh- what happened on -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- September eleventh.
L:  Oh, see tha- that's what I think of as a threat.
R:  You do?
L:  [NOISE] Not so much weapons of -- 
R:  But s- so they said countries, right?  I guess any -- any of these Middle Eastern countries, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Who supply terrorists, you know.
L:  I think they all would be a threat. 
R:  Maybe like Syria, you know, and all those terrorists, you know, and, ah, all those countries, Iran, you know, Yemen. 
L:  [MN] Iran, Iraq. 
R:  Yeah, Iran. 
L:  Iraq's now.
R:  Yeah, Iran's big t- big terrorist supporter because they support something called Hezbollah[?] that's in Lebanon, those are the -- where all the terrorists come that attack Israel.
L:  Oh. 
R:  You know, and they support the, ah, the terror-, you know, ah, the terror-, the Palestinian terrorists, suicide bombers [MN] 
L:  Huh. 
R:  And, ah, -- 
L:  I did not know that.
R:  Yeah.  And, ah, [LIPSMACK], so there's a lot of terrorists threats in the Middle East that com- the people that come from the Middle East, you know.  Like in Afghanistan until we, ah, won that war that's where al- [MN] you kn-, you know, have you ever heard the word Al- Al Qaeda?
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  That's where all the terrorists were used to train, the head of the Af- Af- Afghanistan, wh- tha- the government was, ah, Taliban, called the Taliban.
L:  Right.
R:  That's where the Al Qaeda came from and there's still a lot of them in Pal-, oh, do you know -- do know where else, [MN] a lot of terrorists come from Pakistan too.
L:  [MN] 
R:  That's on the boarder -- 
L:  Th--
R:  -- with Afghanistan.
L:  No, I think of all those as just one big -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- country even when [NOISE] they're not?
R:  [MN] [LAUGH] That's because you're part of the United States. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Is that why?
R:  Nothing else exists except us [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, no, I th--
R:  That's okay.  That's okay, no -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I mean I understand. 
L:  No, I mean I recognize that other things exists I just, I don't know --  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- lump them all together as one.
R:  But I tell you the truth I -- I think things are getting better, don't you think, don't you feel a little more se- secure now than you used to be?
L:  No.
R:  No? [MN] 
L:  Not with the botulism threat they have now going on. 
R:  What botulism threat?
L:  Um, I think it was Decoma[?], Washington -- 
R:  Wh- when was -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- this?  
L:  Ah, it was either this morning or it was yesterday, but it was on CNN this morning.
R:  What happened?
L:  Something about there was botulism going through the mail now.
R:  Really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I didn't even know about that.  And what happened, do you know?
L:  No, I -- I just caught the end of it.
R:  Something just happened today in th-, ah, on the t- news a couple of hours ago something in Florida.
L:  In Florida?
R:  Yeah, they found some- [MN] something people at the airports, workers got sick or something from a -- some chemicals or something on a plane. 
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  See, I don't -- war doesn't scare me.
R:  Where are you -- 
L:  You know, Wiscons- --
R:  -- what state are you in?
L:  Wisconsin. 
R:  Wisconsin?
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Isn't that funny, that's where I'm going [LAUGH] in two we-- 
L:  Lucky you -- 
L:  -- I'm going to a place called Lake Geneva.
L:  [MN] Yeah, I'm, like, two and then -- two hours from there. 
R:  Oh, okay.  I, ah, [LIPSMACK], but I'm really not scared any more I -- bec- I'll tell you why because now that, um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [MN], you know, we have a home land security department and everything's beefed up, you know.  Now that we're aware of it -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of the threat, you know, it seems like a -- things are a little better. 
L:  I don't know, I think, ah, I think we still have our guard down though too much.
R:  You do?
L:  Mhm.
R:  How come?
L:  Just now with this botulism thing and then now with Florida airport. 
R:  Yeah.  You know what's scary, I think it's --
L:  We -- we place too much emphasize on, um, -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- guns and stuff like that as being destructive -- 
R:  Yeah, oh, yeah -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- the cap-, yeah.
L:  -- there's many more things that are -- 
R:  Oh, I know, chemicals, right?
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Biological?
L:  Right.
R:  You know what's scary?  It's scare- I'm sca- I'm afraid to travel any more.
L:  I'm not afraid to travel. 
R:  To me that's the scariest thing, I'm afraid to get on a plane any more.
L:  I wanna move, I live right between two nuclear power plants. 
R:  You do?
L:  Yep.
R:  Wh- what's that?
L:  [MN] 
R:  Where's that -- where's that?
L:  Um, there's -- they're in Wisconsin, we got a whole bunch of them [MN] -- 
R:  Really?
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Do you know where I live near?  I live near -- do you remember a long time ago that, ah, Three Mile Island?
L:  [MN] Right.
R:  I'm only, you know, I'm -- I'm -- only like a hundred miles from there.
L:  There you go [MN].
R:  [MN] But I didn't even think of that any more.
L:  We always have the, ah, the army's always doing refueling missions over -- over our heads [MN] -- 
R:  You're kidding?
L:  No.
R:  How -- how do you know that?
L:  Ah, it was in the paper because there was a big -- everybody was calling the police station one night because -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- there's all these army fighter pilots going overhead and whatnot and it was really, really noisy and we're, like, "What the heck's going --"
R:  [MN] -- 
L:  "-- on".
R:  You know the United States has a new policy now, like, wh- what they did in Iraq, it's called preemptive strike, do you know about that?
L:  No.
R:  Um, it used to be that United States only went to war if somebody attacked us, or -- or they threatened us.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You know?
L:  But now if we feel they're a threat we ca- --
R:  And now we do it before -- before they can attack us we attack them.  That's what happened in Iraq, it's called a preemptive strike [MN] preemptive theory -- 
L:  I think -- 
R:  -- President Bush -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- just started that.
L:  I don't know that I agree with that, but ...
R:  A lot of people don't agree, but at least we know what?  At leas- at least we're better off in Iraq today than we were -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- a week ago.
L:  Right.
R:  Or a -- you know -- 
L:  Well, see, I don't know that I agree with that either though.
R:  Why?
L:  We think we're better off but are we?
R:  Why do you think we're not better -- 
L:  Do we know -- 
R:  -- off?
L:  -- for sure that we've gotten all the people?  No, you can never get all of them. 
R:  But did you get the main one, didn't you?
L:  Well, did we?
R:  [LAUGH] Now -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- you're scaring me, you're telling me maybe he's -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- gonna come back, Saddam Hussein?
L:  Well -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- do we know for sure that we got him?
R:  Oh, my God, you got me thinking now.  Now I'm gonna have bad dreams tonight.
L:  No, you're not. [NOISE] 
R:  How about -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- how about -- how about -- how about Osama Bin Laden, he's scarier?
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I don't think one is scarier than the other, I thinks it's jus- I mean how you -- well, I don't [NOISE] one is scarier than the other, I think it's just how you look at it and what you perceive --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- as -- 
R:  I'll be honest, it -- 
L:  -- what scares you.
R:  Yeah.  Well, you know what scares me?  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I know I shouldn't say this but, you know, [MN] whenever I see people hanging around of -- of -- of Middle Eastern, you know -- 
L:  Right. 
R:  -- or -- I get scared and I don't care if people say, "Oh, you shouldn't do that" b- that's where they all come from.
L:  Well, I mean that's -- that's a logical, you know ... 
R:  Do you know what I mean?
L:  I get scared -- 
R:  I mean you ca-- 
L:  -- I -- the other day I was driving down the street and there was a bunch of -- there was, ah, eight or nine, um, they're Hmong, they're Chinese descent -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  They're called Hmong. 
R:  Ah. 
L:  They were all just standing on the street corner and it was like, "Okay".
R:  What do you call them?
L:  They're called Hmong, H.M.O.N.G.
R:  I never heard of that.
L:  Yeah, it's, ah, it's a part of China.
R:  What do you do, Kim?
L:  Me?
R:  Mhm. 
L:  I work for social science research companies. 
R:  Oh, wow, that's -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- pretty good.  S- so you probably know all about that, I mean, different kind of people and everything?
L:  Yep.
R:  S- so you don't blame me for being afraid of Muslims?
L:  [MN] No.
R:  And -- and as though -- they're always complaining that we -- I -- you know, that we're targeting them -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- what do they expect?
L:  Well, [MN] exactly.
R:  I mean if I saw a Scandinavian guy, I'm not going to be afraid of him.
L:  Right.
R:  You know -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  And, ah, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But I -- I -- I have more faith in our -- in our security than you do I think.
L:  Yes, you do, I don't have any.
R:  You don't -- you don't have any?
L:  No.
R:  Why?
L:  Because I think nine one one proved that our -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- guard was down -- 
R:  I know it's up --
L:  -- and I don't -- I don't personally think that we've gotten it up where it should be.  I've traveled too much since nine eleven -- 
R:  Where do you travel to?
L:  [COUGH] Just in the States.
R:  Ahah. 
L:  But security at every airport is so different it's not funny.
R:  Really?
L:  [MN] For example, I -- I usually wear my hair back in a beret, I can walk through the Milwaukee airport and set off all the, um, the, ah -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- what's ma callits[?] the, ah, -- 
R:  I know what you're talk -- the metal detectors?
L:  Yeah, I can set off the metal detectors in the Milwaukee airport because -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- of my beret.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] I can --  
R:  [LAUGH] I lo- I love the way you say beret [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] My beret, my beret. 
R:  Yeah, that's what I used to say beret.
L:  [MN] But I can walk through, um, Regan -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or Washington, Regan, what ever it's called, in DC -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- and it doesn't set it off.
R:  How come?
L:  It just doesn't make sense to me that my beret in Milwaukee will set it off but -- 
R:  What do you have a long -- 
L:  -- right across from -- 
R:  Mhm
L:  -- the Pentagon it doesn't.
R:  What kind of beret do you have?
L:  Just a normal buy it at Walgreen's beret. 
R:  Oh, a -- 
L:  A metal beret.
R:  You don't see those too often any more.
L:  You do in my hair.
R:  What do you have long hair?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Blonde?
L:  Yep [SIGH] 
R:  Ca -- have you got a pencil?
L:  Ah, not handy.
R:  Re- remember this.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  You there?
L:  Yep. 
R:  [MN] whose that in the background?
L:  My daug-
