L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Moira. 
R:  Hi, my name is Bill.
L:  Hi.  So, [LAUGH] after you.
R:  Um.
L:  Subject.
R:  Yeah, and rather topical.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Um, do you consider any countries a threat to the US? 
R:  Um, yes.  I believe, um, I believe north Korea is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Reason being is I think they're a desperate country that needs a lot of things and they wouldn't be adverse to selling or bribing or doing whatever is necessary in order -- in order to get the, um, money that -- that they need, and I think desperate people do desperate things and desperate countries are no different than desperate people.
L:  Yep.
R:  What are -- what are your thoughts? [COUGH]
L:  I'd have to agree with you on North Korea.  I -- I can't say that I'm very well versed in much of this topic but, um, -- but I definitely -- just the fact that North Korea is sort of standing out there like, hey, we have all these weapons, look at us. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Please.
R:  I -- I -- I --
L:  And so they definitely want to get something from it. 
R:  I agree with you in the fact that I don't feel -- I don't feel versed enough to -- to take a stand or because I don't really feel like our media is giving us enough information, and -- and the other side of it is that this whole North Korean issue just burst on the scene, um, as a result of September eleventh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, there were a number of documentaries that I've seen recently on -- on Cinemax and one was from the BBC where they've sent people to North Korea, um, and to do a documentary about health care and so forth, and it's -- it's such a depressing country.  They've got all the mausoleums and all the big wonderful buildings that were built by the -- the, um, the leaders there -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but there's no humanity.  There's no people to populate these and it's -- it's just so desperate that you can picture that if weapons are the only way that he could use in order to make money, um, they're going to because there's nothing else that they have to offer the world, at least that they think that they don't have to offer the world.
L:  Right.
R:  Which is really -- that's a desperate -- that's -- that's really bad to be put in that position.  No -- basically almost no different than a family who has no way of making a living and yet trying to survive, you know.  They would turn to crime or do whatever is necessary in order to -- to feed the family.
L:  Yes, it's really sad.  That's like, like, 'cause there's the talks that are coming up pretty soon between I think North Korea and South Korea and Japan right, and the US.
R:  Do you feel -- do you feel that with our administration, our current administration in America that diplomatically we are strong to be able to deal with this problem with Korea? 
L:  Not really. [LAUGH] That's sort of scarring me.
R:  [LAUGH] That's -- that's my concern.
L:  Yeah -- I guess -- yeah, I mean, I get very concerned about the same thing that we just put such an image out there of we're trying to save the world, but [LAUGH], I mean, we're already stretched so thin and putting ourselves out there in so many other parts of the world, it's like we can't do everything and we can't, um, solve all the problems and then when there's something that is a really big threat -- 
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- it's like we can accomplish that along with a million other things and it just -- 
R:  And it's scary to go it alone because that's sort of what's -- what's happening.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean --
L:  And it's like that -- 
R:  -- it's always nice that -- 
L:  -- we don't go along with the UN and then making that -- making the UN seem like it doesn't matter as much any more, it seems so dangerous to me as well because then that could just lead to sort of nobody trusting any inner -- sort of international body that could govern over everyone.
R:  Yeah, I agree.  It's, um, from a diplomatic standpoint, I don't think that we have the diplomacy or -- or the desire to be diplomatic.  Um, we're more -- we're more force oriented and here we're dealing with a country that definitely needs to be dealt with diplomatically because we're stretched so thin that we couldn't afford to be able to -- to engage in a problem over there.  And the other thing is the whole question was do we think that there's another country, you know, that -- that can cause us problems?  Just watching the news tonight, I mean, it's not over in Iraq watching a million people gathering in the streets wanting the Americans out of their country.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, isn't -- isn't that another problem that could possibly brew that nobody was thinking about?  Um, it's -- it's -- it's really scary.
L:  Yeah.  I was reading an article about just sort of like the -- the past of when the US or Britain has gone into a country and then how long it's taken them to get out of that country, and it was sort of [LAUGH] and it was, like, in most of them it was almost a decade and the -- the country becomes, like, very dependent on the US, and it's like you need to strike a balance between helping them and not making them become too dependent on you, but right now it doesn't even seem like a lot of people want us there at all so -- [LAUGH]
R:  No, it's, um, in fact, as the -- the developments that have occurred in the past couple of days with all of the, um, the mass marches and everything in -- into Kabala, it's -- it's extremely scary because it really just echoes the entire problem over there in the Middle East.  It's not just that one country.  I mean, we saw the same thing happen in Iran, um, and -- and elsewhere, and it's not -- the answers aren't coming from the west because I don't think that our leaders understand any more than I understand that culture which is -- which is so foreign to the western way of thinking.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  And they do need -- 
L:  That's the whole idea of how things should be run is so different from ours and we go in there saying, "Oh, you know, we want the democratic process" or whatever, but forcing democracy on people is -- although it would be nice, [LAUGH], it sort of goes against the grain of the whole idea of it in the first place.
R:  Ah, with my -- with my friends when -- when the -- the Berlin Wall fell, um, all of the talk and everything -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- turned to -- to that topic, but now years later, you know, the imposing of democracy on to Russia, the way it was done, was really so wrong because what it did is it brought up all of the elements that were being held at bay by the government and that being the mob scene and -- and the organized crime angle that took over a lot of Russia.  Ah, if it could be implemented more structurally over a period of time so that that could be controlled, I think it would be a better way to introduce democracy into, um, -- without the chaos.
L:  Yes.
R:  That -- that seemed to be the problem when -- that was what I was looking for.
L:  Chaos.
R:  Iraq is in chaos because we took everything away before we've implemented the democracy.  The same thing happened in Russia.
L:  And so much of a problem is also just the education of the people who live there because they just really don't have any and, um, and, um, you get worried that if you give, like, if you say democracy is sort of like, you know, like, one vote per person and then you have like a -- a big minority that would like to have a voice that they'll get completely left out because there are a different, like, very different ethnic groups within Iraq also.
R:  Right.
L:  And, I mean, just the fact that there's, like, no education for the children and then they grow up to be that way.
R:  Well, I -- I couldn't understand all the time that we were hearing, you know, about the reason that we should be going into Iraq and that we were hearing that the Iraqi people want liberation.  But at the same time they said that the average age of an Iraqi is twenty five years old, and Saddam Hussein has been in power for thirty years.  Well, that means that the majority of their population doesn't know anything about democracy.
L:  Right.
R:  So it goes back to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- what you were saying about education.  How could somebody want something that they're not even educated in to even know about or understand?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and that's what we're seeing now is that they might choose to embrace it much more rapidly if they were more educated to understand what, you know, what it all involves and I think, you know, it's taken two decades or so and Russia is finally coming around, ah, to being able to control the -- the mobs and the um, um, -- when I say the mob, it is the organized crime.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, very much like the American -- like America had in the twenties.  Um, they've --
