                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
L:  Hi, I'm Delores.  Who is this?
R:  Hi, this is Camille.
L:  Hi.  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Good.  Where are you calling from?
R:  Massachusetts.  How about you?
L:  Oh, I'm in New York.
R:  Oh, you're in New York.  Okay [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, the question was --
L:  Um.
R:  -- "What countries do we think are --"
L:  A threat.
R:  "-- a threat to the -- to our safety?"
L:  Right.  What comes to mind is Iraq.
R:  Ob- Obviously [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And then, um, next in mind would be Syria.
L:  Yes.  And I don't know.  I can't really think of --
R:  And North Korea.
L:  Okay, that's so.
R:  Okay [LAUGH] they've been in the news recently.
L:  Possibly France.
R:  And Fra- -- yeah [LAUGH].  Well, actually this morning I heard just a little blurb on the news that they might be actually coming around to our side.  I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing or -- [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt to have as many countries on our side as possible.
R:  True.  I'd rather have them as a friend than an enemy.
L:  That's true.  Um, I can't -- I don't really think of any other countries though right now as a threat.  I think --
R:  No, I -- like you said, I mean, Iraq.  You know, that obviously springs to mind --
L:  Right.
R:  -- with everything that's going on and the fact that they've found, um, not chemical weapons but I know they've found chemicals that could be used as weapons.
L:  Right.  That would be awful.
R:  Yes [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] The only thing that scares me really is if they, um, somehow get into the water supply.  It wouldn't be too hard to do.
R:  No, it wouldn't and, you know, like nuclear plants.  That's another thing that they could target.
L:  Right, that's true.  And I -- I -- I'm not -- I feel pretty safe about the airports at this point.
R:  I really don't fly so I -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, you haven't?
R:  No, I -- I've only --
L:  I haven't --
R:  -- flown once so ...
L:  -- flown since, you know, since all this started or whatever.  Like we went to Florida last year --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we drove.  And I have three kids so that's, uh, a feat in -- in -- in itself.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  But yeah, I wouldn't consider it -- well, maybe at this point I would, uh -- flying -- I think that the airports have it all under control at this point, hopefully.
R:  Yeah, I think so.  From what I understand, people that fly, you know, they have to leave so much earlier, you know, to go through all the checkpoints.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I th- -- it is probably safer [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- than ever before.
L:  And it's a higher security.  Everything is, um --
R:  Well, especially I would think in New York. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, especially in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- New York.  I mean, though, um, with the other thing, the anthrax or whatever that was, they had that all totally under control too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I'm pretty confident in the -- in the President at this point.
R:  I am, too.  I'm -- I'm behind him.  I mean, I don't like to see anyone go to war but I think that, uh, he --
L:  Sometimes --
R:  -- knows more than we do.
L:  -- it's necessary.  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Sometimes it's more -- it's necessary.
R:  Right, and I think he's doing what he can to keep us all safe.
L:  Right.  I think so, too.  Boy, what a tough subject.
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Couldn't they give us something easy?
L:  Right.  Could we discuss the common cold --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or something?
R:  Is this your first phone call?
L:  No, actually it's my second.
R:  This is my second also.
L:  My last topic was on the common cold, though.
R:  Oh, it was, okay [LAUGH].
L:  That's why it sprang to mind. 
R:  Mine was on holidays so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  -- it was much easier.
L:  Holidays is kind of cheerful.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I wouldn't have minded that one.
R:  Well, probably this is a subject I'm sure that everyone is talking about.
L:  Right.  Everybody wants to know what the whole country is feeling and stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  It is affecting the kids, though.  I mean, I have, um, young children and they're very aware.
R:  Now, how young are your children?
L:  They're five, seven and ten.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And believe it or not --
R:  Well, probably de- well definitely I'm sure the ten year old.
L:  Well, believe it, the seven year old is more than the three of them.
R:  Really.  Wow.
L:  And the thing with the ten year old now -- I don't know if you -- if you have young kids or whatever but --
R:  I do. [LAUGH]
L:  -- they can't even go on a field trip without, um -- I have to sign like three different consent forms --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, you know, because of the state of the country --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it's unbelievable.
R:  And they do when they talk and I know they talk it about, you know, at school, on the bus.
L:  Right.  No, I did- -- they definitely are aware.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, definitely.
L:  You know.  I know my seven year old is, um, sleeping in my room [NOISE] sometimes if he hears a report [NOISE] or something like that on television.
R:  Well, it's scary for them because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, they -- they only know so many things, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  And we -- you know, we can watch TV and read the newspaper and talk to people and they kinda get little bits and pieces.
L:  And it's like all over the TV --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, you know --
R:  You have to be careful what you watch, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  I mean, you know, it could be, like, if something happens, it's on, like, every single channel.
R:  Exactly.  And they -- they did say, you know, if you are going to watch it, try to watch it with them and, you know, answer their questions and kind of try to relieve, you know, their fears.
L:  Right, and then they have like counselors at school and stuff like that --
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  -- and I'm sure they must have, you know, assemblies where they discuss it or whatever, but you'd be surprised.  I'm really surprised at how, um, you know, how much involved they are in it all.  I guess they have to be now, you know.
R:  And some day when they're grown up, they'll look back at this.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, well, I know because I -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- well, I'm thirty eight so I [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  -- I don't really remember -- oh, really.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Oh, that's neat [LAUGH].  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I really don't remember much like about the Vietnam war and things like that --
L:  No, I don't --
R:  -- or the Korean war.
L:  -- think we grew up with war either.
R:  No.
L:  There was really nothing.
R:  No.  We were lucky.
L:  I mean, you heard about it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But it was somewhere else.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And even the other one, the Desert Storm, it wasn't real.  Didn't seem real.
R:  Right.  A -- a -- actually a friend of ours, um, is a marine and he was over there.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah, and he came back from Afghanistan in February.  He was over there again, um, military police this time so ...
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But he's home so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well that's good.  That's good because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, I think they have a couple of kids in their class that their fathers are away.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  You know, so it really is hitting close to home this time.
R:  There's not too many -- we live in a small town so there's not really too many people that have left, you know, from this area.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but ...
L:  But aside from that, like th- things are going along, you know, as well as could be expected, I think.
R:  Yeah, you know, from what I understand, you know, it's going along as they had planned and we haven't had too many casualties, thank goodness.
L:  Which is a good thing, right?
R:  Yeah.  It was nice to have those POWs come home [LAUGH].
L:  Right, exactly.  And the girl, the last one.
R:  Oh, the one --
L:  What was she?  In the marines, I can't remember exactly?
R:  I don't know if sh- yeah, she might have been.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I really -- the -- Jessica, right?
L:  Oh, right.  That one, yeah.  So, it seems to be okay.  I mean, I don't like the pictures of what's going on in Iraq right now, though.
R:  Oh, with the protests and --
L:  Yeah, with all the, you know, their, um, bombing everything over there and stuff and it's -- and it's like years ago you didn't see it even if they had like let's say, World War Two or something like that.  It wasn't broadcast over the television.
R:  Oh, right.  Now, I know, they're right there. [LAUGH]
L:  And now, yeah, I mean --
R:  You can hear the bombs. [LAUGH]
L:  -- there was a reporter on TV and he was right there, you know.
R:  I know.  It's amazing [LAUGH]
L:  He's like, "They just bombed down the block from here" and I'm, like, "You staying there?" --
R:  I know, and you're still there? [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't understand. [LAUGH]
R:  I'd be on the next plane home. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] It's really something, you know.  On the one hand, it's a good thing.  On the other hand, it's a little too much, you know.  We -- it'd be better, I think, not to see as much --
R:  Not to see anything at all.
L:  -- as we do, you know.
R:  Anyway, it's a hard call. [LAUGH]
L:  It is.  It is, and, you know, like a lot of --
R:  People want it, you know.  Some people want to see, you know.  I don't -- I don't know.  The first time I -- I heard the bombs going off, it's -- you know, it was very unnerving.
L:  Right.  I mean, and I think maybe they should have, like, one channel devoted to it --
R:  Right, instead of all --
L:  -- so that if you wanted to --
R:  -- over the place.
L:  -- you could and then if you didn't, you know, you didn't have to.  I think it should be like that, you know.
R:  Right, it was --
L:  Also because of the kids.  It's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.
R:  I know.  I have four kids so I feel the same way you do.
L:  Four kids? 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Okay, I have three.
R:  Well, you have three.
L:  I have three and they're hard to handle.  I can't even imagine four.  [LAUGH] I have three boys.
R:  I've got four. [LAUGH]
L:  Four boys?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.  I know that's gonna happen to me.  That's why I'm not having any more. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'm like, no more boys.  All we have is boys in my family, though.
R:  Well, I have four older brothers--
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then, um, there's my sister and I.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So ...
L:  So, it's like my, um, my two brothers all have boys, my sisters have boys.  Nobody has a girl.  Not one.
R:  Oh, wow, really.  I can -- I can hear your mother, "Come on, where's the girl?"
L:  I know.  At this point, she's like, "Forget it now. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- It's all boys.  Let's just keep on having the boys", you know.
R: [LAUGH]
L:  But my one sister-in-law is pregnant now, so, um --
R:  Oh, so you never know. [LAUGH]
L:  No.  It's possible, I guess.
R:  Now, how many brothers do you have?
L:  I have two --
R:  Two brothers.
L:  -- brothers and a sister.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, you know, years ago they had big families like that.
R:  Yes, they did.
L:  Yeah, I know, today it's like three.
R:  I know.
L:  It seems like a lot.
R:  I know, and people look at you like "Wow".
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  Yeah, so.
L:  I know somebody who has, like, seven already.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like, " No, that's not me".  I know somebody who had, um, two boys and then they had twin boys and then they had twin boys.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  So ...
R:  [LAUGH] Bigger house. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right.  Oh, God.  What is your youngest?  How old?
R:  He's nine.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, yours are all pretty much grown at this point.
R:  Yeah, well nine, eleven, thirteen and my oldest just turned sixteen so ...
L:  And it does get easier although I guess you're dealing with those teenage years.
R:  It does.  Well, yeah, but -- [LAUGH]
L:  I haven't dealt with the teenage years yet.
R:  [LAUGH] We're just starting so, um, they're pretty good kids and I'm pretty strict [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, me too and, you know, I -- right now, I'm just dealing with some attitude I'm getting from my ten year old.
R:  Yeah, well, you know, they get to the point where they think that they start to know more than you do.
L:  They know everything, they know everything.
R:  And they raise their eyebrows and it's like, uh, no -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It's true.  It's true.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, uh, yeah they -- they do.  Like I said, they're aware of everything.  You know, my middle child is more aware.  He'll actually listen to the news and he came in and --
R:  Well, especially, I think, boys.  You know, they really -- I don't know about your boys ...
