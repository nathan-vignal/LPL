R:  Hi, my name is --
L:  Hi.
R:  -- Martha and I'm from Cincinnati, Ohio.
L:  Hi, I'm Jennifer and I'm from, um, Fort Collins, Colorado.
R:  Oh, hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Well, I -- that -- that question's kinda tricky.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it is and it isn't.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do we think any other country -- I think there are probably several countries that could be a threat to the United States but I don't know that much about politics to be able to explain exactly why.
L:  Yeah.  Um, I -- I listen to the radio a lot.  I don't have a TV so I don't -- I don't, watch the news or anything but, um, you know, I listen to like, Rushland Barr[?] and, um, Michael Savage and, you know, a few of the other --
R:  Shaun Hanidy[?] by any chance?
L:  Um, no I've never heard of him.
R:  Oh, okay.  He's really good.  We just started get him here in Cincinnati.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He's also on Fox TV, The sh- -- Hanidy and Cone Show.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, I -- I guess right now the biggest, um, threats that I feel is, um, well, possibly Syria, um, but they seem to be coming around and, um, Iran and Saudi Arabia and, uh, North Korea, that's, uh -- that's iffy.
R:  Tha- -- I feel the same way you do.  I think those other countries in the Middle East, I don't know whether they are an immediate threat right now but we need to keep an eye on them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and we -- we don't -- we need to not get too complacent with what just happened in Iraq, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and we need to keep our eyes and ears open but -- and I'm --
L:  Well, --
R:  -- sure the government is.
L:  Oh, yeah.  And see one thing that, um -- one of the reasons why I was for the war with Iraq was because, um, we are fighting a war against terror- terrorism --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it doesn't matter where, it doesn't matter whose terrorists -- uh, we're didn't specify -- President Bush didn't specify, "Okay, we are only to give those that are terrorizing us".  No, he said, "Against terror- terrorism globally" and so that could be anybody's terrorists, you know.  Um, which I think he was very wise in the way he did that, um, because, you know, that -- that gives us the open door to be able to go in and, if we find a bunch of terrorists, to be able go take care of that instead of, you know, trying to find reasons and that's why I feel that the UN had no business stopping us from Iraq because there is -- there were terrorists in Iraq, so --
R:  Right.  And I don't think we really needed the UN's permission to do it obviously --
L:  No.
R:  -- because we did it, but the United States was just trying to, you know, let the rest of the world know this is what we're going to do.  Are you behind us?
L:  Yes.
R:  And most of the world was behind us.
L:  Exactly.
R:  The -- the --
L:  Exactly.
R:  The few countries who weren't just got a lot press --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for -- for being against it and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, I agree with you.  We're -- it -- it -- it wasn't a war with Iraq.  They didn't even call it that.  It is a war on terrorism and to try to -- we have to stop it.
L:  Yes.
R:  All over the world, we have to stop it.  To -- it's been going on for too long.
L:  Yeah, and that's why I think that if we end up going to war against Syria, I'm all for it, you know, or Saudi Arabia or Iran or -- or even North Korea, you know.  I mean, yeah, we -- you know, we need to be careful, you know, at first like with civilians but, at the same time, you know, if we're getting rid of the terrorists and if we are -- if we are freeing these countries to where the people have more control, this is going to be less terrorism --
R:  Well, and I -- I think what we just did in Iraq, I'm glad we did because I believe it sent a message --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to the rest of the world.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  We're not going to take it anymore.  It almost reminds me of bullying in school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We stood up and said, "You're not going to do that anymore" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and we hit back.
L:  Yeah, and I'm so proud of my country [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, I am too, and I think it is terrific and it's hard.  I have family members who feel the opposite --
L:  Mhm.  I do, too.
R:  -- and -- and -- and it's real hard -- it's really hard to talk to them.  It's hard to get them to realize, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that a lot of things -- don't you understand the things that you're hearing someone created --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to get you to think this way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What you're hearing is not based on fact.  You know --
L:  Well --
R:  -- we're going over there for oil.
L:  Exactly.
R:  It's a war about oil.
L:  But you know what, it's funny because if this had been a democrat that had been leading this, everybody would have been for it, you know.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  And it's sad that people have to let the politics like that interfere with doing the right thing.
R:  Right.  I believe that a lot of the people that took a stand against the war for purely political motive.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They want -- they really, really wanted the war to turn -- they wanted our country to lose the war so they could use that as a political tool to have their guy elected in the next election.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it is really sad --
L:   Yeah.
R:  -- and it is especially sad for the young men and women and their families, the young men and women who are over there, the young men and women who are in North Korea, oh, South Korea right now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My -- my nephew is over there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He's been over there for about a year and, um, you know, so that our country is keeping an eye on them but, yeah, there are a lot of threats out there and we don't know -- obviously we weren't expecting September the eleventh.
L:  No.  The -- you know, we don't know if it could happen again.  I mean, obviously it can happen again but we don't when or where and [MN] you know [MN] if people are going to just be pacifist and just ignore, you know, or -- or they're out for their own gain, it's gonna happen again.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  Well, you said pacifist.  The one thing that drives me crazy is -- I-- I also listen to the talk radio shows and people will call in and say, "I'm a pacifist" or "I'm a peace monger".  The lack of a war does not equal peace.
L:  That's right.  That's right.
R:  We didn't have peace.  How can you have peace if you think of what the word "peace" means?  How can you have peace when there is the threat of terrorism in front of you?
L:  That's right.
R:  And -- and so it drives me crazy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to hear them say that but, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know.  I think, you know, we will have a military presence over in that part of the world for quite a while.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, you know, I think some -- some of those, uh, liberal folk think that now that the war is over, they should all come back now and everything, you know, go back to the way it was.  Everything can't go back to the way it was.
L:  Nine eleven changed the world.
R:  No.
L:  It not only --
R:  Yeah, you're right.
L:  -- changed the United States but it changed the world.  It changed the outlook of every person in the world and, [MN] you know, because not only did it affect our economy, it affected the economy in many, many, many different countries.
R:  Well --
L:  So --
R:  -- and a lot of my friends who were against the war were against it for economic reasons.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They didn't think past their pocketbook and they -- they talked so much about how much the war was going to cost and they didn't want their money being spent on that.  They wanted their money being spent on something else that would immediately affect them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they didn't see that fighting terrorism had anything to do with them.
L:  Yeah.  See and that's sad because now, you know, the people in the other countries that are being suppressed and -- and y- y- -- being dictated over, you know, they -- they see what's going on here.  They see the division but y- y- -- they're hoping that some day we'll be able to go in and liberate them like we did Iraq.
R:  Right.
L:  But when --
R:  I think so, too.
L:  -- they see people like -- like the Democrats and the people that are against it, you know, they -- they're going to start saying, "Well, hey, you know, what if their voice actually starts being heard?"  You know, especially when it gets closer to re-election.  You know, people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- are going to be really worried.
R:  But maybe some of the people in the Middle East will see that.  Maybe the people from Iraq are seeing that there are people in our country who strongly protested the war and nobody shot them [LIPSMACK].
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, maybe we've got the right idea.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Maybe our democratic society and our freedom is a good idea because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- those people do have the freedom to be very vocal and object to the war and -- and nobody shot them or -- or kidnapped and tortured their children [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they might be seeing that there is -- there might a future for them.
L:  Oh, I hope so.
R:  I do, too.
L:  I hope -- I hope these people will just rise up and take control, do the right ...
