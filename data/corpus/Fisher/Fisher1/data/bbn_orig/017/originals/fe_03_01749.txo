R:  My name is Dawn Hunt.
L:  Hi, my name is Bura[?]
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm fine thank you, what about you?
R:  [LAUGH] I'm fine thank you.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Actually, you know what?  I participated in one of these today and it was -- I figured it would be a different topic each time you called, um, -- 
L:  Yes. 
R:  -- so, I figured that, you know -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we would be a new topic, so, I've kinda already talked about this.  Where are you from -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- may I ask?
R:  [LAUGH] So, maybe this is the topics of the day, um, in fact, well, right now I'm in State College, Central Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, you live in Pennsylvania?
L:  Yes, um, -- 
R:  Oh, neat, okay.  I live in Dallas, Texas. 
L:  Oh, this is cool.  Ah, I'm originally not from Turk-, um, USA, I'm from Turkey, so I'm -- 
R:  Oh -- 
L:  -- I -- already a foreigner [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, neat, okay.  Well, I'm from America but my dad is from Hungary -- 
L:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, so, my name's all different but, you know, but of course I've lived here a while and I've lived in Dallas a while, I'm originally from Minnesota.  How long have you lived here?
L:  Ah, in fact I have been here for -- for, ah, four years in State College, Central -- 
R:  Oh, neat -- 
L:  -- Pennsylvania, and I -- I'm with student here, I'm trying to finished my PhD [MN] 
R:  Oh, wonderful.  So, -- 
L:  [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  -- how did you hear about the Fisher project?  You know, when I saw it I thought it was toys.  So, how did you hear about the Fisher project?
L:  [LAUGH] Well, a lot of my friends, um, replying th- the email, ah, indicating the project -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- from Philadelphia --
R:  Okay. 
L:  -- and I guess -- and I guess, um, he -- he g- got it from the school.  I guess it's originally, um, the project -- originally from University of Pennsylvania in Philly. 
R:  Okay.
L:  As I know.  Probably he got it from his friends or somewhere.  
R:  Okay, well, -- 
L:  And -- 
R:  -- that's cool, that's neat.  Well, I know we're supposed to discuss the topic, what is your answer to the question they asked?
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] [PAUSE] Hello -- 
R:  What do you think about the topic?
L:  Oh, about the topic, mm, ...  
R:  Yeah, because I know we're kinda try -- 
L:  [NOISE] I see -- 
R:  -- to stay on topic and I'm just -- 
L:  Yeah.  In fact in terms of threats from the other countries, um, maybe all of the c- other countries may -- will be a threat in some respects and, um, like it depends upon w- th- th- what kind of threat we are talking about, like kind of a terrorist act, or an economical, um, dominancy, or, ah, any other threats.  I mean to be honest I think, ah, European Union is going to be a threat, ah, in some manner in terms of the economy in USA -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when compared to Euro with dollar -- 
R:  Mhm 'kay.  
L:  -- for instance, there's a lot I observed around the world, ah, and particularly in Turkey, um, for instance, like previously dollar was more valuable than any other currency that we have in Turkey, but right now I guess there -- it's [NOISE] -- I mean the difference between the Euro and the dollar is increasing day by day -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and people, like, psychologically -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, [NOISE] buying Euros rather than dollar and some of dollar -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- is not increasing any more -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so, -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I mean maybe I'm -- it's a little bit theoretical but, ah, this may be a threat to the whole country, um, in -- in terms of economy.
R:  Mhm, hm.
L:  Ah, what do you think about it [LAUGH] I mean -- 
R:  Yeah, maybe -- maybe the economy -- well, I guess I thought of it as a threat -- I thought of it as, ah, more of, ah, terrorist thing and whatever -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that's kinda what I thought of.  I didn't think of the economy thing, so I thought it was terrorist related -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and, um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I think Korea's defiantly a threat -- 
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and I think a lot of countries are aiding terrorist countries that we don't know about -- 
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- for example, France and places like that -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so, I think Americans are too trusting -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, "Let's everyone in, let's everyone in and support them, yeah".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's how I look at it as. 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, in fact -- 
R:  So, I think we've -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- been idiots in many ways.  Like, "Let's trust everyone we meet --" 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- let's embrace everyone."  You know what I mean?
L:  Mhm, mhm, yeah.  
R:  Been too trusting, and, you know -- 
L:  Yeah, but -- 
R:  -- we've helped -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- bad guys and things like that.
L:  Yeah, but do you think France will be a threat, um, I mean -- 
R:  Oh, pshaw, not a threat -- 
L:  -- particularly like party time [LAUGH] --
R:  -- maybe not a threat but I think their aiding countries and, um, defiantly I don't think they're to be trusted -- 
L:  Mhm, mm.
R:  -- I think no- I don't trust -- I'm the type of person I don't trust anybody anyway, by -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my nature, I trust no one -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- except my husband and my family and a few close friends, um, I'm kinda the type of person that I think everyone is out to get me. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That sounds terrible -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- but I don't -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- trust anybody -- 
L:  [LAUGH] No -- 
R:  -- and I think we're too trusting -- 
L:  -- it's okay, maybe this is reality though that we should consider but, you know.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Now, what religion are you since you're from Turkey?
L:  Um, well, the -- the religion in Turkey is kind of practiced differently.  Even though I mean, um, we all say that we are Muslims [NOISE] -- 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  -- to be honest my family was not, um, into religion in -- in any particular way -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- [LAUGH] so somehow I can't say that I have a religion -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- maybe I can say I'm agnostic or, um, not -- I'll tell you, because I do believe [inaudible] is another kind of religion that you just believe that [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  Well, what does your p- what were your parents raised, or what were they? 
L:  My friends, um, since I was from the capital, like there are some people who believe in God and, um, in Islam and practices in some manner, but generally my friends they were kind of indifferent, um, -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- we have, like, other concerns other than the religion [LAUGH] even though -- 
R:  Isn't that interesting?
L:  I guess it's -- I mean [several inaudible words] from Russia maybe -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean because there are basically two, um, strong political, um, parties, like one of them is on the right and the other one is -- 
R:  Okay.  
L:  -- extremely on the left and if you're kind of not, um, conservative and if you want to be open minded you need to select the left side and it somehow requires, um, you to, um, quit having your religious, um, thoughts in -- in your +ideologically -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in terms of politics.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I mean personally I feel it's like that, but on the other hand I do respect, um, everyone's, um, religious thoughts -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and I think they should practice this in any way, but particularly I don't buy any of these [LAUGH] -- I mean maybe it's the way, ah, that I was grown up, um, I mean my grandmamma, grandfather they were the same like me and it can be the influence of [inaudible] and old Russia I don't know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it's just the way that I, um, that we practiced the religion, and in some manner if you ask the Muslim countries, like the Ar-- the Arab -- the Arabic countries -- 
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- they never consider us as Muslim [LAUGH] 
R:  They never what?
L:  Like they never consider the Turkish people -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as like Muslim peop- I mean Islamic, um, -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- people, but on the other hand, I mean we have much more, um, cultural influence from Islam -- Islamic c- culture than, um, I mean Christian or, [MN] any other culture surrounds.
R:  Yeah, that's interesting.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So, I'd be curious to know what you think of Americans because of with all this stuff going on, you have your anti Americans, you have your people that love America, you have -- you know what I mean.  [MN] I'm just curious as t- well, since you're over here what you think of the whole thing?
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Because it's interesting hearing from someone like you because you -- you grew up in a different place.
L:  Yes.  [MN] So, um, what I think about this anti American, um, thoughts around the world?
R:  Well, yeah, exactly, or w- how do you feel about America since you've gotten to see everything?
L:  Mhm.  Well, in fact, um, most of the things on the media, I think they are just like, oof, especially the political perspectives -- 
R:  [MN] Ahah.
L:  -- I think they're kind of f- I thought of them a little bit fake, like fake in the sense that, for instance, France wanted the peace when we were in the war with Iraq[?] -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or Germany b- simply because they recognize that they are not going to gain anything like after the war or though the war and they were kind of into, um, into -- I mean they were against to the war with Iraq, so I find their perspective a little bit fake -- 
R:  [MN] Oh, yeah.  
L:  -- like, a little bit political because it wasn't, like, big [inaudible] for them, the Iraq, so, they didn't really care and they used us in their politics, um, and on the other hand from the American perspective I've -- I kind of find Bush's idea a little bit, ah, controversy to the general public's ideas and, um, I find them a little bit, ah, fake too.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean do you see what I mean?  Everything seems like a little political.
R:  Yeah, you know what?  I don't know if you feel the same way but I get tired of talking and hearing about the whole thing -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I was hoping we could be on a more exciting topic. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- Yeah, I'm sure -- 
R:  You know, I thought it was going to be about toys -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I know this is so idiotic but -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, you're -- 
R:  -- I thought -- 
L:  -- [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  -- we were going to -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- talk about toys.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know that sounds goofy, but I'd have more fun talking about toys we grew up with -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and enjoyed -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- does that sound silly?
L:  [LAUGH] No, it's not really, maybe it's much more exciting. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  So, now, are you married with kids?
L:  Ah, no I'm not married [LAUGH] no, not really. [LAUGH] 
R:  You're probably young.  How old are you, like eighteen?
L:  Who me?
R:  Ahah.
L:  Ah, ah, my age you mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  No, I'm -- in fact I'm twenty nine -- 
R:  Oh, you're young -- 
L:  -- I'm not, and -- 
R:  -- well, I'm in my thirties, but yeah -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, yeah, I was married by the time I was your age though, but, yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, don't you want to marry a nice American girl over here?
L:  [MN] Well, um, [LAUGH] I've been maybe [LAUGH] -- in fact it's kind of strange, but I'm gay, um, so I'm not thinking to marry with, a-, ah, American woman --
