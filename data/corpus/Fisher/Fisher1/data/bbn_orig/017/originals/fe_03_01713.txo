R:  Hi, I'm Anna.
L:  Hey Anna, I'm Cathy Moore.
R:  Hello.  Well ...
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from Indiana.
L:  Oh, you are?  I'm from Florida. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  It took them a long time to find somebody to talk, I've been holding for about fifteen [LAUGH] minutes.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [MN] Um, yes, I think other countries are, um, a threat, I think Korea certainly is, and, um, I don't think Sy- I think Syria's trying to be in -- a threat, and I think Iran has proven that it's a threat.  Um, although I don't think it's anything we gotta feel insecure about.
R:  I agree.  I, I believe a lot of the -- I think, um, Russia, I know Russia's, like, -- well no, it's supposed to be like one of our allies, but I believe they're a threat because of the nuclear weapons and stuff, and I agree that, um, what was it, um, oh, Ch- was it Southern China or whoever was practising firing the, the missiles out in the Pacific, I think that that's a threat too, and I think they're just teasing us saying, "Oh, you know what, we have power too", and it's just, you know, I don't know if it's a -- a, a power trip, they're trying to say, you know what, we have as much technology as you do, you know, "Try and come and get us and we'll blow you out of the water" or what.
L:  Yeah, I don't think they have as much, ah, power now.  I guess China would probably have more than, um, any other country at -- because they're still, um, what is their -- they're not Russian -- 
R:  Technologically advanced.
L:  Right, yeah.  And what is their -- um, their political -- what is that?  Their, um, ...
R:  Oh.  Oh, I forget what they call them.  They're more like a -- I don't -- like -- 
L:  They're -- um, ... they're, um, oh, I think -- what was Russia? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, um, --
L:  They're broken up now.  Well, my husband and I were talking about this last night.  I can't stand it when I can't think of the word.  Um, ...
R:  They're more like a, um, a ruler kind of thing, there's like one person --
L:  Yeah, dictatorship.
R:  Yeah, like a dictatorship and stuff.  A democracy, and -- yeah.  I --
L:  Communist, that's what I was trying to think.
R:  Com- yes.  
L:  Communist. [LAUGH]
R:  They're Communist.
L:  Um, yeah, my husband was telling me, um, -- what was it?  That they were Communist, or the Communist Party --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I guess -- oh, I guess it was Korea.
R:  Korea?
L:  But I think they do have, um, re-elections, or I thought they did, in, in Korea.  Maybe I'm thinking of another country.
R:  Yeah, I -- I think -- [NOISE] are you still there?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Okay, 'cause I clicked my phone [several inaudible words] Um, I think a lot of those countries that are not really saying anything, they're sorta staying back in the shadows, I think that maybe they might be a threat, but not nothing, like, huge threat, but 'cause they don't -- we don't really know what they have 'cause they don't talk, they're just -- they keep to themselves and I think if they're threatened they will -- would react, but if people just leave them alone, I think they won't react too being --
L:  Well, according to the UN treaty, ah, there's only so many countries who are allowed to have nuclear weapons, and I don't know which ones they are exactly.  I know we are, and ... and I don't know if Korea is or not.
R:  [NOISE] No, is Russia?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Is Russia allowed, I wonder?
L:  Um, I think they are.  They're bigger -- but I'm not sure.  But in -- since they're broken into so many parts now, you know, um, and each of those countries are separate now, you know, like Poland and, um, Croatia, and, you know, the ones that used to be -- [LAUGH] ah, Yugoslavia -- 
R:  The Bos- was, like, Bosnia and --
L:  Yeah, Bosnia.  There's so many of them I don't even recognize the names, you know, at this point.
R:  Right.
L:  I always wanted to go to Yugoslavia, but --
R:  Oh, and --
L:  -- not now. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh yeah, exactly exactly.  I just -- I, you know, I, I think -- I -- each -- I think each individual country, it probably has a threat, like, of it's own, but not -- not like a certain, you know, like, like, huge impact, like the United States, I mean, we have tons of troops and weapons and stuff, but -- 
L:  Ah, --
R:  -- I think, you know, some -- you know, you never know, like in these small little towns, these people might have -- how to make, like, like, biochemical weapons and stuff like that.  'Cause you really don't know.  I mean -- 
L:  And I --
R:  -- you never know what's out there.
L:  It's like, ah, some of the, the Arab countries just seem to be threatening us, and I, I, I -- I wo- really didn't want us to have to go to war, but I'm not against it now because, you know, look what Iran did to us.
R:  Right.
L:  And, you know, they -- and, and we couldn't do anything back, or what we tried to do failed.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I guess Bush would of sent the troops in. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And getting their people.  I don't know if that would -- been bad, I --
R:  Yeah.  I, ah, I have relatives over in the war, and so I -- I've always --
L:  Over where?
R:  Over in Iraq.
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  Uh-huh.  And I've always been for the war because it made my day when those people and the statue of Saddam Hussein came down --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and those people are just cheering like a big relief had been lifted off of them, and --
L:  Yeah.  So whoever I talked to yesterday, ah, they just thought, you know, we shouldn't have gone in -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to Iraq, and, and she said -- was saying, "You know, how do you know that those people even wanted help", and she didn't think -- you know, when we left that they would probably still just go back to, um, fighting again, and, and then the religious leaders would take over and the different sects of the, um, parts of the religion --
R:  The Muslims.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, and like she was saying, "You know, how did I know?" -- I, I think we just had to go in and help them because we could.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  You know.  And --
R:  It's not -- it's -- in a way it's like the reversal of David and Goliath -- finally, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It -- 'cause I mean, we -- in a way -- in the sense we were the David, because we -- we weren't in there fighting for religion.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the Goliath was, like, all Muslim, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, I don't have anything against the religion or anything, I mean, it's awesome, but --
L:  Yeah.  You know, I don't understand why they have to fight within their religions, but I think it's more than that.  I think Saddam was -- look at all the money they found.  I mean, he was just a greedy dictator, and, and certainly couldn't have been all that religious, all of the [LAUGH] things they were -- all the booze and -- [LAUGH] stuff that his sons had, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, they certainly must not have practiced the religion.
R:  Exactly.  And I think, you know, in a way that's why prob- those countries are a threat, because they go along with, instead of going along with the religion they go along with, like, Saddam --
L:  Well, I think they had to or else.  I think they, they -- those people are oppressed, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, and I guess the same could be true in Iran, but, um, I think that those people are -- maybe the whole thing is -- you know, maybe they're the whole religion, um, -- I don't know.  I don't know if there's that many different sects, but since it's a whole -- they're all Muslims, um, you know, I guess there's different parts.  I know there's different parts of the Baptist Church, but we don't go fight each other. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, exactly.  And it's just like, oh, we was watching -- um, my husband and I were watching this, um, called Terror In Children --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's where these children all over Iraq and Iran, and it went from how different the Muslim religion was taught.  This one boy, he was, like, "I'm gonna go to hell because I'm seeing a woman's face", 'cause a woman that was interviewing him, 'cause she knew how to speak their language and stuff, and he was like, "I'm going to hell because I see your face".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then she was -- and then in -- ah, interviewing another boy from a different part of town and stuff, and he was just fine, saying, "You know, it's nice to finally see women's faces because, you know, our, our religion's letting us do this", and it's -- I mean, you know, it's -- it's amazing how people can have different interpretations of the same thing.  And I think, you know, with Saddam Hussein, he made the people believe his interpretation, and the same with, um, Osama bin Laden, he there -- he was teaching people his interpretation, so it was, you know, it's making it bad, and when it's not really.
L:  I think that's too -- is a threat in these terrorist factions, you know, all over, I think that's the threat.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  I think that's my caller waiting thing, but I -- they said not to answer it, so I'm not. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I mean, I -- I just -- I'm, like, I don't know, I just wish I -- they could get rid of all the terrorism, and I mean, I know, um, --
L:  Yeah, I hope we can get rid of that Osama.  Whatever.  I think -- I know they're trying to.
R:  Yep.  And I -- and just, like, Saddam --
L:  He is the devil.
R:  -- Hussein, they don't know if he's dead yet or not --
L:  Where -- I know.
R:  -- and, I mean, how are we gonna tell --
L:  Yeah, how we gonna find out? [LAUGH]
R:  -- if, like, he has -- he had -- there was, like, seven of him.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I mean, for all we know --
L:  Impersonators.
R:  -- he could already be hidden in China --
L:  Or he could be down in one of those bunkers.  They say they're, like, you know, a mile down under the ground or something.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  And, and it -- they can't -- wouldn't be penetrated by the bombs.
