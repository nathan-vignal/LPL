R:  Hi, my name is Erin.
L:  Hi, my name is Mary.
R:  Hi, Mary.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  So, who do you consider to be a threat?
L:  Mm, the only one that even comes close is maybe Russia.
R:  Is what?
L:  Russia.
R:  Russia?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I kind of think that North Korea is definitely a threat to us right now.
L:  Do you?
R:  I -- I just -- I don't trust them m- m- -- with the fact that they have nuclear missiles and -- and, uh, [SIGH] with the way that they've been acting, and now that Iraq [inaudible] I think that we should definitely concentrate on North Korea.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I used to think that Palestine was a threat also, but not any more.
L:  Yeah.  I was kind of wondering about Syria for a while, but i- it -- I think they're going to back down real quick. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's how I feel also.  I mean, as soon as -- as we told them to close their borders, it -- they -- and they m- responded, that's -- [SIGH] that shows good intention to me and, um, they'd be foolish to take on the United States, 'cause they've seen what happened in Iraq.
L:  Right.
R:  So that would just be ridiculous of them.  [LIPSMACK] I think that definitely -- if Palestine were larger, I'd say that they were a threat, but [SIGH] with everything that's going on, uh, in that whole region, I think that we may find that somebody who we don't think is a threat might be a threat later on --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to us.
L:  Yeah, that -- that whole area is just a ticking time bomb. [LAUGH]
R:  I- it is, it is, and -- and they're extremists, so when you have an extremist religion like that, it just -- i- it breeds hatred, and I think that, you know, I think that we sh- -- still shouldn't rule out the Afghan region also.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, because they may not be a threat to the whole country, but they may have cells --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- inside that country, or inside our country even. [NOISE]
L:  And you don't know, yeah, there's -- there's Iran to deal with.  But I -- I think they're pretty much on our side.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, I -- I know they were getting real nervous over there for a while.
R:  Mhm.  I think that they have too many, um, [LIPSMACK] relations with money with us --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know?  And -- and with England as well --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to even go there.
L:  Right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And -- and it's such a large country, that if anything were to happen with them, it would be so hard for us to -- I mean, we -- we could do it, obviously we'd win, but it would -- [SIGH] it would be ten times worse than what happened in Iraq, 'cause they're so large.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, but still I do not trust North Korea whatsoever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] They -- they make me very, [LAUGH] very nervous.
L:  Do you think they got some hiding places over there?
R:  I thi- -- no, I think that -- that -- I mean, they have -- they've admitted they have nuclear missiles --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they've admitted that they have some that can go pretty far, so [SIGH] I think I'd be worried about [SIGH] a retaliation if, after this, you know, George Bush decides, "Oh, okay, you know, I -- I want to take on another person, you know --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- and, you know, rack one more up".  I believe that Iraq needed to be taken care of. 
L:  Definitely.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And I'm glad that we went in there, and people that, you know, I have a lot of friends that don't think that we should have even gone in there, but I say it's -- it was a -- he was exactly like a Hitler type.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  And you can't -- you can't have that.
L:  I couldn't imagine -- I was, uh, looking at the news today and they said they had one of these things with the pins in it that clamp shut on people and it's, like, "Yeah, okay".
R:  Yeah, and they also found some suspect chemicals today as well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] And, [SIGH] I mean, I don't -- I think that this is going to be a warning, but I think that it also invites other countries who have that same type -- type of attitude to challenge us also.
L:  Right.
R:  And that's what scares me a little bit.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I never [SIGH] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I'm not for war, but when it happens, I'm behind my country. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  You know?
L:  Definitely.
R:  And some of these -- I've seen some of these people, even mothers of, uh, people, um, [LIPSMACK] who are in the Service --
L:  Right.
R:  -- who are protesting against the war.
L:  Right.
R:  And I thought to myself, "How c- -- how can you do that?"  You know, "Your son or your daughter's over there".
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, "And they've decided to make their life's career in the military, and you've started to go against them".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's [LAUGH] you know?  I th- -- I just think that's -- that's terrible.
L:  Definitely, terrible.  I -- yeah, it -- it just -- I don't know, they've got a lot of people out there that just say that they're against war, but it's not as many as are for the war.
R:  Right.
L:  And --
R:  Right.  Well, and also, I think a lot of these people a- are somewhat ignorant, they don't understand, you know, they did a -- a poll --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and a lot of these people, you know, [MN] they -- they didn't even know really what was going on --
L:  Right.
R:  -- within the war.  They -- [MN] they hadn't studied anything, you know, most of them didn't even watch the news.  They said, "Oh, we don't wanna watch the news, 'cause of it's war".  Well, that's how you get educated.
L:  Right, that's how I always get educated most of the time.
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] you know?  And they say the news is propaganda.  Well, if you go to any other country, your news is going to be m- --
L:  "And then they had Baghdad bombed".  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:   [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  But still, after they were in Baghdad, he's saying they're not here.  I mean, it was like [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, th- th- --
L:  Ah!
R:  [LAUGH] I think that that's ver- -- that that's very, very funny is that, you know, [MN] bombs can be going off behind him and he's still saying, "I -- they're not here".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "They're not here". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, [LAUGH] I know it!
R:  You know, a- as soon as that statue of Saddam came down, they -- they -- they even said, uh, "No, it -- that was, uh, you know, that was from past --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- from the nineteen ninety one war" they said.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Which I just think is -- is absolutely ridiculous.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I'd, you know, I'd -- you're saying North Korea.  I c- -- I couldn't understand where you're coming from, what you're saying.  Um, Russia's got -- I don't think they really have as much, but they can be a threat 'cause they've got as many people.
R:  Yeah, I -- I'm -- I'm worried about them a little bit.  I'm worried about them siding with -- with places, you know, that, like, Bush calls the axis of evil, you know, w- with Iran and with North Korea.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, b- -- and I'm -- I'm -- I was very worried that -- that after everything that has happened with Russia and the United States, that they were not behind us --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in the war.  Not even -- they didn't even, uh, in fact, they were way oppo- -- very opposed, they weren't neutral at all.
L:  Right.
R:  And if they'd stayed neutral, I wouldn't have been so worried.  But the last thing that we need is a cold war again.
L:  Yeah, tell me about it.
R:  [NOISE] You know, because [SIGH] I'm young, but my parents [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, went through [NOISE] the, um, [LIPSMACK] Cuban missile crisis and, you know, the Bay of Pigs and the Korean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and the World War Two even --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and i- i- -- to have that fear again, that Russia, you know -- but I think that because we've -- we've been in Russia and we've had such relations with Russia that I -- I -- and because they're so divided now int- into different states, where before they were just the Soviet Union.
L:  Right.
R:  That I don't think that we could -- they could get enough backing.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I live in a predominantly Russian neighbourhood [NOISE].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they're, you know, I have a lot of my neighbors, uh, their family, still, to this day, I see [LAUGH] new family members showing up [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, from people and I -- and th- they tend to have a very, um, positive attitude.
L:  Yeah, they, y- you know, when they come over here, after they come --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- over here, and they see such a difference, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah, they understand better.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But [NOISE] when they're over there and they're under one regime and they don't know anything else about any other country --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and they haven't been educated, that's, yeah, that's where you end up in a lot of trouble.
R:  Right.  And you also end up in a lot of trouble with -- and the fact that now that they're a democracy, maybe the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, you know, Putin, maybe he wants to go to being a dictator type situation. 
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  And -- and do y- -- they were so optimistic about democracy, and then their economy, you know, w- when the -- when it first hit, their economy failed so miserably, because they didn't know how to be a democracy.
L:  Right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] That now I'm worried that they're going to say, "Well, you know, [SIGH] go back to the way it was".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that people will start, you know, but I -- I don't know about the rebellion and that of people who have started successful businesses nowadays --
L:  Right.
R:  -- who would say, you know, "No".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, you might have -- I mean, I'd say, in -- in a few years, you might have, sort of, people that are on the -- the, you know, have more classically minded in thinking of the way it used to be with the communism --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, you know, the higher officials, 'cause they want the control, and they don't want the power to the people.
L:  Yeah, that -- that's --
R:  And then the people, and then you have a -- a civil war going on.
L:  I don't usually say too much about this, but my -- my mother's sister --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- married an Iranian.
R:  Married, uh, married what?
L:  An Iranian.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's how I know they're nervous over there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And she passed that information on.  She goes, "Oh, don't worry about -- they aren't going to come in here until -- for a couple of years yet".  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  She jokes around about it, you know?
R:  Yeah.  My -- my --
L:  So --
R:  -- uh, one of my best friends is Iranian.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  And it's the same thing.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  He said, you know, when he fled Iran, he fled because of the dictatorships that were there --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and he said that it's steadily gotten worse.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  And, uh, [SIGH] but he said, at the same time, they have also built up a lot of economic relations, especially with England.
L:  Right.
R:  And that he doesn't feel that they would --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- go and ruin that.
L:  [NOISE] Anyway ... [LAUGH]
R:  You know?
L:  [LAUGH] Did they say they're going to tell us when ten minutes is up, or what?  Uh --
R:  Oh, I don't know.
L:  I thought they would. [LAUGH]
R:  I think -- I think they're gonna have a tone or something --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- to that extent.
L:  Oh.  Oh, well. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] What state are you in?
L:  Ohio.  Where are you at?
R:  Ah, I'm in Los Angeles.
L:  You're in Los Angeles?  Huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I got a cousin out that way.
R:  Oh, really? [NOISE] Whereabouts?
L:  Um, she's -- well, I know she's like a foreigner but I can't remember exactly where out there.
R:  Ah.
L:  So ... she's, uh ... [SIGH] she's back and forth, yeah, she us- usually stays out there, but I hear from her every once in a while, so -- [LAUGH]
R:  Mm, right.
