L:  Hi, my name's Cricket, I'm from Southern California.  How you doing today? 
R:  Good, good.  My name is Tina, I'm from New York.
L:  Hi, Tina.
R:  How you doing?
L:  Good.  So I guess we're gonna talk about computers in the school system, huh?
R:  Right, right.  So --
L:  Well, ah, --
R:  -- what is your opinion about it?
L:  Well, first of all, um, I'm gonna give you a -- just a little quick history here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I got in trouble one time and, ah, ended up in prison --
R:  Really? 
L:  -- and I was in, ah, the computer refurbishing department --
R:  Oh, man.
L:  -- is what's called, and what we did is --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- we rebuilt and built computers for the California, um, grammar schools.
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  So, I mean, that was really important and I thought that was, um, you know, a really neat thing that we were doing, because I think the computers in the schools nowadays is an extremely, ah, important aspect for our kids growing up.  Ah, you know, in the millennium and everything. 
R:  Right. 
L:  I mean, everything's computer related nowadays.
R:  Well it is.  I think it is, but you know, what it is at my -- my -- ah, from what I've seen from my, um, nephews and other kids --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I think it does hamper their education a little bit, because I've noticed that, um, I've started to my nephew, from when he was like three years old, and he loved the computers --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to a point, you know, where, you know, he just wants to get on the computer all the time.  Doesn't want to read --
L:  Right.
R:  -- he has this problem of, ah, you know, um, not wanting to concentrate, and I think his concentration has to do, you know, is getting out of focus from --
L:  Right.  Well --
R:  It depends on how you use it, basically -- 
L:  Right, I was gonna say, 'cause --
R:  -- the computers, because --
L:  -- it, it depends on, ah, what they're doing on the computer --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because, um, --
R:  But then -- then everything is -- they want everything computerized.  It's like they want -- they go to schools and they don't even want to listen to the teachers.  They'd rather listen to a computer talking rather than a teacher, believe it or not. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right --
R:  You know.
L:  -- well, it depends if they're using a computer with or without the internet --
R:  Right.
L:  -- now, if they're on the internet, the information, ah, --
R:  Oh yes -- 
L:  -- highway, is so --
R:  -- is, is bad.
L:  -- extensive, I mean --
R:  Well yeah, they don't, they don't go on there.  No.  They don't go on there, unless they do, they go on to the, you know, the cute sites like Blue's Clues, you know, and Cartoon Network.
L:  Right, right.  Well --
R:  But still --
L:  -- okay, I suppose -- 
R:  -- you know what it is, I think it's -- it does -- I don't know, it's somehow hampers them.  I mean, at a -- after a certain age I think in their teens, they could probably do, you know, like in schools I'm sure they, they do teach them the basics of computers, but now they're -- they're learning them even at three years old.  That's what I'm wondering, and it's sort a like, I think it doesn't really improve their, their computer skills, you know, --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- over, over the long run they won't be concentrating on other parts, like, you know, they have to learn other -- other studies, like --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- study English --
L:  Like reading, writing, math, all the --
R:  Yeah, they --
L:  -- basics and stuff -- 
R:  -- yeah, most kids today, you know, they've been diagnosed for ADHD.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And I think partly is because, even though I'm against that with the teachers, basically, because --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they're not really helping them either. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  I can't say it's all -- you know, they should be all diagnosed like that and it's correct, you know.
L:  Right, right.
R:  But I just feel that, um, the computers do play a role in how they're thinking, you know, and the future is --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and how it -- how their whole frame of work is, but the whole -- the teachers have to do their part.
L:  Right.  Well, um, okay, well my opinion, ah, of the computers, though, being in the school system --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it, um, -- our technology, like I was saying, everything is computer orientated --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, and a lot of us --
R:  Eventually will --
L:  -- like, I'm forty six years old and I had no idea --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- anything about computers growing up --
R:  Right, mhm.
L:  -- because they weren't there.  But now that I do, um, and I do know a lot about computers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I still feel kinda computer illiterate.  You go out and go --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to get a job anywhere, whether you're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- gonna be at McDonald's on their little touch screen things, or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, even to work --
R:  Probably maybe 'cause --
L:  -- the ATM machines or anything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they need to know how to function, the functions of a computer, um, 'cause --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's just the way everything is anymore.
R:  But I think you probably do know computers, it's just that, you know, you know, it's pretty -- you know, once you learn them --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and get into them, you pretty much -- you know, I've pretty well -- I've worked well with computers, I've built them and everything --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and I know how, you know, just about everything, how it runs and everything.  It's just that, um, you know, okay, that's like getting into the whole repair part, but, ah, it is, it is an opportunity, it's just that a lot of people -- there's gonna be a lot of competition out there because --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you gotta know it.  It's part of mandatory thing after a while --
L:  Right well, you know --
R:  -- it'll become mandatory.
L:  -- on the, in the hardware issue, but on the --
R:  It is good, it is good that, you know all our -- but as an education, at the beginning, especially from let's say elementary school, I would not introduce computers to the kids 'til after they get into junior high school or high school.
L:  Really?  Okay, well I think --
R:  Yeah, I wouldn't introduce them that early, because --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I, I feel that they're not really, um, focusing on --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- other parts of the studies, that they feel that -- 'cause they consider it as a game, basically.  A computer becomes a game to them --
L:  Right, okay.
R:  -- they put in the software and they can play, you know.  And -- just like video games are.
L:  Right, well, okay, back on the thing you said, that, you know, a lot of our kids are attention deficit --
R:  Right.
L:  -- by having computers there for them, it, um, to me would expand their interest -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- because, I mean, you can do learning --
R:  Still --
L:  -- things on computers that are fun --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- that would keep their interest --
R:  Their interest, yes.
L:  -- going for them, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- than to let them run wild in the classroom and learn absolutely nothing.  At least --
R:  Right.
L:  -- ah, through a computer, or a computer -- a good program, you know, kids' programs, um, --
R:  Sure, they could incorporate, let's say, the computer in there with the teaching.
L:  Right, right.  Incorporated but not to just --
R:  And somehow, you know, teach it that way.
L:  -- to just leave it out, like, you know, you were saying.  I don't think that's good.
R:  That they could do, but they haven't really done that yet.  In like elementary, they have pretty much -- they're sticking with the basics.
L:  Right, right.
R:  The books and everything.  You know, they have to buy the text book, the math books and all this, and they're not focusing really on, you know.  You know, if they did that, then maybe they -- you know, they could improve --
L:  Right, well, um, --
R:  -- you know, in a different way.  Maybe we could look at it as a -- you know, we could then give our judgment as to if it's good or not.
L:  Right.  On the other hand, though, they're learning things like, ah, typing -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- which teaches them the alphabet.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, things like that, punctuation, um, --
R:  True.
L:  -- you know, um --
R:  Typing.  For typing speed especially men and women today.  Even men have to, you know, type fast, basically.  Women -- you know what I'm saying, it does speed up your, your coordination and your eye --
L:  Right, so -- so, oh good.  There's a good one, their coordination --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so if the children are learning to do this in schools at a young age, I mean --
R:  I think it is to a certain point, though, to bring it to school, but then again I don't know how they would incorporate it in, in elementary school, when they start -- you know, if they do ever bring it to, you know, to, to elementary.
L:  Oh, they do have them.  I mean, in California we have them in --
R:  Oh, you guys have them?
L:  We have them in all --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the schools almost, and --
R:  In New York they don't, though, in New York. 
L:  -- like I said -- okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The project that I was in, that's what we did, is we built the computers for elementary schools.
R:  Do you teach -- do you teach them too?
L:  Excuse me?
R:  Do you teach also?
L:  Do I teach?
R:  Yeah.
L:  No.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  No, I'm not -- I'm not a teacher.  Um, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- actually I'm a printer technician.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but, ah, as for -- I mean, I think it's wonderful that the kids have these things in the -- in their schools.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think it's almost, um, -- not -- I don't like to use the word mandatory, but, ah, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you said, ah, --
R:  Well it's gonna be after a while, yeah.
L:  -- it teaches them motor skills, it, ah, um, --
R:  Motor skills wise, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And I mean, and that's important, um, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, as long as they're not sitting there just playing games or something, which a lot of, ah, the kids that's what ends up happening, is they just want to sit there and play games and games.
R:  Right.
L:  But if you were in the school system --
R:  How, how is the education system in, in, um, California?  A lot of them do -- are a lot of them diagnosed with ADHD?
L:  Um, I think kids everywhere are. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I, I know a lot of kids that way.
R:  But you know what it is, it's become more -- ah, you know, like now there's a name for it, you know --
L:  Right, right, yeah, right. 
R:  -- basically in the past there wasn't, you know.  And --
L:  I think, ah, you know, everybody's that way, or it's just that the generation's the way that they were raised, and you know, um, like I said I'm forty six so I was raised under a strict hand --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but then when I raised my children it was, you know, a lot lighter --
R:  Oh, you have your own kids?
L:  -- and they're raising their children and now you --
R:  I would think, you know --
L:  -- can't spank them or do anything, you know, type thing.  And -- so.
R:  -- the only thing is, they're good -- they pick up, they learn and everything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but afterwards, you know, I do find that -- my ne- well, my -- see my nephew, he, he always -- everything he does, basically, video games to TV to, um, computers, they get bored afterwards --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I do find them just like, you know, "What do I do next?", you know?
L:  Right, right.  And that's because there's so many --
R:  He's told me that so many times.
L:  -- opportunities.  There's so many different things --
R:  It is.
L:  -- to do.
R:  But apparently they don't see it that way -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- they like, come to a run point where their mind doesn't seem to say, "Well, there's so many things to do", you know --
L:  And when we were young there wasn't hardly anything to do --
R:  Yeah.  Well, we had our --
L:  -- and we weren't bored, we were always out finding something to do.
R:  Oh, I think we had more fun during out age. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I do too.  But, um, --
R:  Because I think we were, we were into -- like, well girls were into their playhouse dolls and to their activities outside --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they were more outdoors.
L:  Right.
R:  We were more outdoors -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, than --
L:  Okay, um, --
R:  -- than the kids today.
L:  Well, kinda back to the schools and, and the computer thing here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, the downfall side would be is that there doesn't seem to be enough money for budgeting to pay our teachers, and, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- security on the schools, or whatever, you know, that they need.  Here in California, um, the school system, ah, supplies their school supplies, like their paper and pencil and stuff like that.  Parents don't have to buy their little -- their kids their little pack to start school with.  Um, that --
R:  Do they have that in California?
L:  Yes, that's --
R:  They supply that?  Oh, okay.
L:  -- that's incorporated, um, it's --
R:  Oh.  Well we don't have --
L:  -- part of the state. 
R:  -- that here.  Actually, we -- they should -- you know what it is now here, we don't have that much funding in New York City with the education, that's why people are complaining --
L:  Right.
R:  -- once we got a Republican into office, a lot of, a lot of, ah, [LAUGH] a --
L:  Right.
R:  -- lot of things go a little bit crazy around, um, --
L:  Well they're getting ready --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- to lay off four hundred administrative positions just here in the San Diego school district right now because they don't have enough money.
R:  Really, oh.
L:  You know, which --
R:  They shouldn't spend the supplies.  You know, I think they should let the -- the parents pay for certain things.  Not the computers I'm saying, but, you know, the --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- supplies, pencils and pens and paper.
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  But -- you know, I guess -- you know, they do supply, you're right, some books that I've seen in school from my nephew's, 'cause I don't have my own kids, but I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- my nephews, they do supply them those things.  Which is good, like you said, but -- it will save paper --
L:  Bu-
R:  -- if you have a computer, you know -- 
L:  I was gonna say, yeah --
R:  -- obviously, yeah.
L:  -- if, if they had computers, you know what, ah, they're not going to have to pay for books and things like that -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and every year have to buy things --
R:  And there'll be more jobs.
L:  -- it's, it's --
R:  Yeah, and there'll be more jobs for people like us, you know -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- looking into computers, you know.
L:  Right, right.
R:  I would think, ah, you know, because people would, you know, at schools they would somehow break down once in a while --
L:  Oh, of course.
R:  -- and you know, networking is required, and
