R:  Hi, I'm Therese McCracken.
L:  Hi, my name's Adam.
R:  Uh --
L:  Um --
R:  Go ahead. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um, so what do you think?  Do you think --
R:  Yeah, I think we do.  I think South Korea's a -- a big -- no, is it [LIPSMACK] --
L:  North Korea?
R:  -- North Korea?  Yeah, North Korea --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and also Syria.  [MN]
L:  Yeah, I -- I would say that, um, [SIGH] personally, I think, like, in terms of just a nation, I think North Korea's probably the biggest threat to US security.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, did you think that, um, Iraq was a threat to US security?
R:  Yes, I did, actually.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I agree, I think that they, um, that eventually it had been like a Hitler situation, where they would have eventually killed so many people and we would have been unaware.  We would have think -- thought it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but we wouldn't have had proof of it.  So, yes, I did.  Did you?
L:  Um, well, I thought that -- well, it's kinda, like, I'm kind of torn on the issue, you know?  Um, but I've -- I've kinda felt that they were -- the administration in Iraq was a threat to the people of Iraq, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but the fact that a lot of the neighboring countries --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, in the Middle East, w- were against, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- US aggression, I -- I don't think that they felt that Iraq was a threat to them directly.
R:  Do you think that might have been because of -- well, I think that a lot of the reason they didn't want to see the freedom in I- Iraq, though, was because they have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the same type of leadership, such as Saddam.
L:  Right.
R:  Hussein is, [MN] you know, just one leader, and when you see one country that you're so close to, relatively, as far as politically --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- receive freedom and then you s- -- they start having riots, you yourself, may want to have those same rights that you -- you didn't know existed.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And for them to be able to stand up now and protest America --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and have that right to do it, and we don't do anything but, you know, let them do that.
L:  Right.
R:  That's -- that's says a lot, that this is a freedom they've never received.  Now, do I think they should protest us?  No, [NOISE] I don't, but it's good to see that they are doing it in a peaceful manner --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they're being respectful [NOISE] and they -- but they -- they have a right to say, "You know, we need -- or -- we need our water, we need this and that" and, you know, they -- they just don't realise how much time it takes. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I -- I think you bring up a good point.  Like, I -- I think that [SIGH] the fact that, like, ano- -- a lot of the allegations are, I mean, there is a definite anti American sentiment over there and, um, part of the reason that they're against it is just because they're against the US --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I agree with that, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as far as, like, a direct relationship --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to, like, a threat [NOISE] to the United States --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't think that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, Iraq was a threat.  Like, I do believe that all the terrorist organizations and things like that as, like, an entity, are but I don't know that there's one nation beside them.  Syria, I think, maybe, and I think North Korea's definitely an actual threat as a nation --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- towards us.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think that one that could become a problem is the India Pakistan --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- conflict, because, um, like, one of the reasons that I was kind of hesitant about the Iraq war in the first place was because I felt like if we --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sort of just went in and didn't wait for the U- United Nations to sort of finish their work, quote unquote, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, then it would have sort of set this precedent that a preemptive strike, as, like, you know, the administration calls it, is something that, like, it's kind of dangerous when you think about, like, other nations, like India and Pakistan, who have nuclear weapons, who could just be, like, "Well, that other country is a perceived threat --"
R:  Right.
L:  -- so I'm just gonna, you know, bomb them" and I think that if we don't proceed diplomatically in a -- in a situation such as that, then --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that could become a direct problem to the United States.
R:  Well, I think that, you know, somebody has to answer the call as far as there are, you know, people dying and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- nobody willing to step in and say, you know, "This -- this shouldn't be happening.  We should stop".  There was a hundred thousand Kurds that were killed, uh, or approximate.  You know they was talking --
L:  Right.
R:  -- about, uh, how last time they set up [MN] hou- -- huts and everything, they couldn't, uh, take all the people that was coming in.  There were so many --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it -- that was, what, twelve years ago, and now, they h- have received very little, and they believe the reason being was, um, Saddam gassed them all --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and a lot of those people died and, um, you know, if we'd a done our job right twelve years ago --
L:  Then --
R:  -- it wouldn't have happened, but now, uh, hopefully we'll get it right this time.  But I -- I do believe that Syria, and I believe that there's, uh, you know, none of this is proven, and it's all thought, but I do believe that they're taking in, um, [LIPSMACK] the fifty five, or the ones that's left.  I know we've captured eight.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I do believe that Syria will be more of threat, because they don't mind taking in the ones that's against America --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then you have all the other Muslims that believe that, you know, that [MN] what's happening in Iraq is our fault, that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, that, uh, they really see Saddam as a m- -- a martyr, if he is dead --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and if he's alive, they think he's a hero.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so, it's a -- it's a sad thing.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  They can't see the heart behind it.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  They really think that we're just doing it for oil, and I, you know, some Americans believe that too.
L:  Mhm.  See, it -- i- it's such a tough situation though, you know, because, like, it's a really difficult balance, I think, because, um, like, i- it -- it is easy to say, like, "It's just for oil" and I mean, I don't think it is, because if it was then we would've just done that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- twelve years ago and just taken the oil and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- taken control of it, 'cause we -- we had it, you know?  Um, but I think, like, a better argument would have been, like, this is to prove the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- US' dominance --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in like, other areas --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of the world.  Like, in the Middle East, that's w- -- that's, like, one of the only areas that holds -- on -- on earth that we don't really have, like, a pretty good strong arm over, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, so I can kind of see why they would say that, especially because, um, in countries where there is such great oppression, like in Iraq, for the last y- -- how many years, um, a lot of times they can be sort of, like, uh, pushed to believe certain things --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, like, it's like in Germany, like everyone was s- -- I mean, like, I hate to compare it to, like, Hitler's Germany, but, um, there were so many people in, like, poverty that it's like they're willing to look to blame someone, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, so, I mean, from that standpoint, I think i- it's kind of rough for us to -- it's difficult for us to show them, you know?  Especially when, like, they're shown images that aren't necessarily congruent with the truth --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, like, that makes it kind of difficult.  But, [SIGH] I don't know.  My -- m- -- I kind of was against going into Iraq when we did --
R:  Really?
L:  -- because, I mean, like, I think a lot of the deaths in Iraq over the last twelve years were because of sanctions by the US and, like, it's hard -- I don't know, like, what the answer is, though.  Like, I think w- we did have to remove him though, so that part is good, that -- that he is out of power now.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um --
R:  Well, I think that they would never -- like I say, I th- -- I think that they will never experience freedom --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they've been under his law, uh, rule, for thirty years.  I don't -- and I believe that you've kept up -- it -- with it pretty well, just hearing you speak --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then -- so you also realize that -- of the things of his son -- sons, both of them, Qusay and Usay, and how they, you know, they pretty much done what they wanted to, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- raped whoever they wanted to, and had the family --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if someone spoke against Saddam, they brought in not just the child, but the whole family and raped the women and killed 'em and, uh, uh, brutalized them, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  For me, there wasn't a question.  Uh, was I aware of all these things?  No, I wasn't --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but I did realize that, uh, we had many terrorists in that area --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- that, um, will rise up because of just what happened with the Twin Tower -- Towers --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so, um, and I know -- I was watching the news the other day and they said i- -- that some people in the United States population thought that Cana- -- Canada was a threat. 
L:  Oh.
R:  And I don't believe that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I do believe that, um, [LIPSMACK] over there we have many, many people that would like to see the United Sates -- States suffer --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, um --
L:  Do you that there is a connection in the -- I -- I remember hearing, like, a lot of, like, over half of the nation thinks that there -- that Saddam Hussein was directly responsible for September eleventh.  Like, do you think that?
R:  I think that he had a lot to do with that.  I do believe that he helped finance it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, do I believe he was on -- in on the plan and that's a good question, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, we may never know that.  But I know that they've -- are -- are linking more and more things to the fact that he was, um, or they're trying to link other things to it and saying that, yes, he was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- very aware of the situation and, you know, he was all for it, of course, and they found six hundred million dollars today in the -- in the wall and, you know, that to me --
L:  Right.
R:  -- also, it's, like, if we were in it for money or for oil or whatever --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that would have never been told.  I mean, we would have, you know, took the money and said, "Here, that'll help pay us back for what we've already --"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "-- done for this country" and yet again, we're trying to give it back to the people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  A- and that's stating again that we have good intentions, that we're not trying to increase our w- worth or value.  We're really trying to give them that freedom that we enjoy so much.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Um, what was this thing?  I -- I was just going to say something, um, [MN] do you -- do you personally, like, as someone who -- I -- I guess, like, you supported -- supported the Iraq war, do you think that, like, if we don't actually find weapons of mass destruction, do you think that that would be a problem for you?  Like, would you, like, w- would you -- would your views change at all on that?
R:  No.  [NOISE]  No, because I think that what --
