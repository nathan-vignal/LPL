L:  Hello, my name is Jennifer Chambers.
R:  Hello, my name is Sherry Rogers.  How are you?
L:  Good, how are you? 
R:  Good.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Have you ever done this before? 
R:  First phone call.
L:  Have you ever done this before? 
R:  No.
L:  Okay, I haven't either. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] We're -- um.
L:  Okay, so our topic -- can I -- can you hear me?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay, are you on a cell phone? 
R:  Um, no, I'm on a cordless but it clicks on and off.  It's like a cell phone when I move around.
L:  Oh, okay 'cause, um, well, we're supposed to be talking about computers and education.
R:  I think they improve education.
L:  [NOISE] I do too.
R:  Because everyone's starting to use computers for everything.
L:  Yes.
R:  I had a pen in my mouth, I'm sorry.
L:  That's okay.  Um, I think they improve education as well because it brings -- especially the Internet, because it brings so much information to your fingertips twenty four hours a day.
R:  I know.  It's buried in, like, um, encyclopedias or -- 
L:  Right.
R:  Stuff like that.
L:  Personally, I don't know how I -- we survived without the Internet [LAUGH] --
R:  Really?
L:  -- before it was invented or whatever.  Um, but obviously we did, you know.  
R:  Right. I'm glad --
L:  But it just makes it so much easier.  I always do all kinds of research for everything on the Internet and, ah, I know that kids, you know, with the jobs these days, ha- -- everybody has to know or most people have to know basic, if not advanced, skills with computers so they need to be taught how to use a computer.
R:  I know, and my kids are learning it in school and they come home and -- and my daughter, she's nine years old and she can show me what to do. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I know, it's -- it's nuts.  My three -- I have a three year and a half year old and she has been playing computer games on, like, Nick Junior and Playoff Disney and all these web sites and she -- 
R:  And they have Polly Pockets on there, did you know that? 
L:  Oh, no. Is it --
R:  Yeah, Polly Pocket dot com.
L:  Ooh, I didn't know that.
R:  Yes, so she'll have to try that.
L:  Yeah, well, that's definitely a new one [MN] for us, um, but, you know, ever since -- I guess for almost a year now, and so she just -- I mean, I can't imagine two year old -- I mean, I just can't believe she was two year old -- two years old and playing computer games, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  But she has learned a lot from it.  I mean, she -- they're educational, they're not just -- you know, just mindless activities.
R:  I know my kids, um, have to do reports for school and, um, one's taking nursing and she has to pull up a health, um, topic once a week for her class so it's real easy just to get on the computer instead of driving her to the library.
L:  Right, it saves a lot of time and even, you know, even if she was -- had to go to the library, she would at least, you know, to get some sort of, ah, reference books -- book or something, she could find out what the library has, what she needs and, you know, everything before she even gets there so you don't have to drive around to several libraries and, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So [LIPSMACK] that's my --
R:  And, um, then people I know how to do reports for -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like on animals or something for science class and then go down and look up something and then they tape it up and run it off whereas in the olden days you'd have to drive 'em to the library and write it all down.
L:  Or make copies.
R:  Or take the book out and then it gets lost. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right, right, and then you're paying fees and fines.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And, um, also I think that [NOISE] -- um, what was I going to say?  Um, [NOISE] I'm sorry.  Taylor, I need you to go in the other room.  I'm sorry, go have Zac give it a kiss. Um, I think that, ah, -- sorry, I totally lost my train of thought.  I had an idea and it was just gone.
R:  Well, I'm a realtor and we have to use computers and, um, they're sending us to classes to learn 'em if -- if you don't know how, I mean, you don't, you know, some of us are in and out.
L:  Right.
R:  They are offering it free in school, you know what I mean, so when they get our age they will already be [inaudible] us, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  My son was speaking in school which he was speaking the same computer class in college [inaudible].
L:  Wow, pretty cool.
R:  Um, take a computer apart and build one and there's a problem someone messes up [inaudible] he learned it all at vocational school, so -- 
L:  So he can do all kinds of computer things and, um, well, my husband is in the computer industry.
R:  Really? 
L:  And, um, he, um, -- I mean, you just -- well, -- well, he works -- it's kind of -- it's business information systems which is a college degree and [SIGH] trying to get a job in that field, you have to have such extensive computer -- 
R:  Background?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Education? 
L:  Yeah.  So, [MN] um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, even some stuff that they didn't even offer at the college, so [NOISE] in my opinion they're, like, -- the vocational school is the way to go for your son.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] Because he was able to learn a lot stuff wise. 
R:  What state are you cal- -- where are you calling from?  Where do you live?
L:  From -- in Virginia.
R:  Virginia. [LAUGH] I just wonder.
L:  Yeah, where are you? 
R:  Ohio.
L:  Wow. [NOISE] It's kind of cool.  I just signed up for this last night so I was --
R:  So did I.
L:  -- totally shocked that I already had a phone call. [LAUGH]
R:  So, me too.
L:  I'm in -- I'm in the middle of painting my daughter's room and -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  When I got this phone call and I'm, like, okay. [NOISE] Go into the other room.
R:  So, no, I don't think computers harm education, do you?
L:  No, not at all.
R:  What did it say, did -- did talk about computers and education? 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Whether they harmful.
L:  Whether they harm or help education.  I don't see how they could -- well, I guess, you know, some people could argue that they might harm education in that -- 
R:  We don't need the books any more or something.
L:  Yeah, and also that as far as homework and stuff, that kids could cheat easy and look up the answers and -- 
R:  I don't think so.  I, um, because they don't know what the teachers -- you know what I mean?  
L:  Right.
R:  They don't have to go through an awful lot to know how -- oh, you mean, like, -- oh, I never thought about that.
L:  Well, even like math, I don't know.
R:  Oh, like call -- chat with someone else and get their homework answers or something? 
L:  Like that or even -- 
R:  Mine have never done that. 
L:  Kind of how, like, -- 
R:  I think you do that on the telephone.
L:  With calculator, you know what I mean, just kind of put stuff in, like, they have programmes these days that might -- 
R:  You could -- you could do it anyway, you know what I mean? 
L:  Right, if they could find a way.
R:  Yes.
L:  So some might argue, I just don't see how -- where the argument would come in that it was harmful.
R:  The thing I -- I would feel bad about is, like some people have computers at home and other kids don't and I feel bad --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- for the ones that don't because they can't, um, -- 
L:  They don't have the same, the ease.
R:  -- access, yeah. 
L:  Right, the same things that the other -- the kids that do have computers.
R:  We haven't taken the teachers' jobs away or anything with computers yet, so -- 
L:  Right.
R:  I don't think that would happen because the teacher will still need be there to show 'em -- to go lesson by lesson, you know what I mean?  
L:  Right.  Well, I don't know.  I think even on line college courses without teachers are, you know, on line or whatever.  I just think if you need a human person to teach you so you can ask them questions and -- 
R:  I took a -- 
L:  -- have ex- explanations, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.  I, um, needed a computer to get ready for the, um, the high real estate exam.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it helped a lot.  I don't know what I would have did without it, if I didn't take -- they send you one on a disk, like a practice exam.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  What I would -- it -- it took the stress off you.  It was -- that's basically what it was for, it was like a short one and to take the stress off 'cause it's, like, kind of putting you in the mood to get ready for -- 
L:  Right, and if you did well, then, you know, can pretty say well, "I know what I'm talking about, I know how, you know, I'm going to do all right".
R:  Yeah and, um -- 
L:  Time to prepare you, give you a practice test.
R:  My second time around being a realtor so I don't know if it was the computer disk that helped -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or probably because I had background, you know. 
L:  Right, right.  I don't know.  I -- I think the computer, as far as writing papers and even, you know, like, when you're writing a paper on a computer, as opposed to using the typewriter, it's just -- it saves so much time if you make a mistake.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And have to delete or change things around, um.
R:  And they're accessible for handicapped people and diff- -- people with hearing problems or -- 
L:  Right, it's -- 
R:  Did you ever put that, um, calculator on the screen or your keyboard on the screen?  
L:  Yes.
R:  Did you?
L:  I've done -- I haven't done the keyboard but I've done -- 
R:  The keyboard and you just touch the screen and -- 
L:  Uh-huh. [inaudible]
R:  Oh, no, it's interesting.  I don't do it very often but -- 
L:  Right.  Most of the time you wouldn't need to but -- 
R:  I wish they would make computers just a little bit more -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- lower priced so more people could, you know, afford them -- 
L:  Enjoy it, right.
R:  -- have access to 'em.
L:  I agree.
R:  I'm running out of things [LAUGH] to think about.
L:  I know.  I -- I wonder how long we've been on the phone.
R:  Um, I don't know.
L:  Hold on, I'll tell you, hold on.
R:  They said they would beep us or something.
L:  My little timer's not working.  I guess it tells me how long.
R:  It's just right about ten minutes right now, one more minute and -- 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But I'm so happy that, um, computers are involved in our education.  I know we have to buy our -- send a headset in, um, to school at the beginning of the year and if it breaks, you know, but then it costs, you know, a couple of dollars.
L:  Right, a headset to use the computers? 
R:  Yeah.
