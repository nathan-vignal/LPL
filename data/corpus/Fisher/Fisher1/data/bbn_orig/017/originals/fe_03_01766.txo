R:  Hi, my name is Julianne[?] Fostina[?] 
L:  [COUGH] Excuse me, my name is Bill Short. [PAUSE] Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  Can you hear me okay? 
R:  Yeah, I can hear you just fine.
L:  Okay, well -- yeah -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I don't -- what?  I wasn't too clear, ah, -- too clear on the topic.
L:  Yeah.  It's sounded like -- the -- we consider any other countries to be a threat to the US.
R:  Do you?
L:  I don't really think any countries too much right now are a -- a direct threat, no, I don't.
R:  Well, Afghanistan, of course, don't you think so?
L:  Well, there are certain -- 
R:  Where -- where are you located?  Can I ask that?
L:  Pardon? 
R:  Can I ask where you're located.
L:  Yeah, I live in Colleen[?], Texas as a matter of fact.
R:  Oh, 'cause I'm in New York.
L:  New York, oh, okay.
R:  So I don't know if you've -- did you notice a difference but I have.  There's so many soldiers.  I'm not used to seeing soldiers in the train stations -- 
L:  Uh.
R:  -- and in the streets everywhere.
L:  Uh, well, Colleen is the home of Fort Hood, the largest army base in the world. 
R:  [NOISE] Oh, wow.
L:  Yes, the fourth ID which has just recently been deployed to Iraq is from here.
R:  Right.
L:  So we see soldiers everywhere.
R:  Oh, but is that just something new? [NOISE]
L:  Oh, no, no.
R:  Oh, I'm not used to it, it's a little scary to me.
L:  Yeah. No.
R:  So it -- it kind of makes me feel that we're -- we're at a threat, [LIPSMACK] that's all.
L:  Uh, yeah.  I mean, there's certainly people in Afghanistan that don't want to do us, you know, any good.  But the country per se of Afghanistan is -- 
R:  Or Iraq, or right? 
L:  Yeah -- well, not any more if it ever was.  I'm not -- I'm not too convinced it ever was.
R:  Oh, you don't feel we were a threat -- under attack? [NOISE] 
L:  No, I don't as a matter of fact. 
R:  Really?
L:  Ah, yes.
R:  Well, I guess I'm just following all the hype in the media I guess.  They -- they say that any minute we could be attacked by them.
L:  Well, I -- am I -- 
R:  Your own opinion? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Can I hear it? 
L:  Well, I mean, look, [COUGH] when was it, it was in the -- about twelve years ago that, you know, the Gulf War -- 
R:  Right, Clinton. 
L:  -- yeah, and -- you know, -- and ever since then I don't think we've exactly been on Saddam Hussein's Christmas card list in -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible] Iraq [NOISE] -- Iraq's has never made, you know, any kind of move to us, you know.  I'm sure he was not displeased when some of the other --
R:  Well --
L:  -- type system things, like, you know, bomb our stuff or World Trade Centre business and that, but -- 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I just -- 
R:  You don't feel like they will ever attack like that again? 
L:  Pardon? 
R:  You don't feel like that country will ever attack like that again? 
L:  Iraq? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] Not in the immediate future, no.  They're certainly not in much of a position to do that right now.
R:  Why do you feel that they did that though? 
L:  Pardon? 
R:  Why do you feel that they did that in the first place? [NOISE] 
L:  The -- the Kuwait thing? 
R:  Um, the World Trade Centre? 
L:  Yeah, well, I don't think that was Iraq certainly, but, you know, it was [MN] -- 
R:  Under the influence of --
L:  It was -- 
R:  Just Middle East in general?
L:  Well, directly, of course, was al Qaeda from what I understand from --
R:  Right.
L:  -- what -- what I've -- I've read, ah, bin Laden was actually, you know, we kind of supported him way back in the day when he was fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan 'cause, you know, -- 
R:  I didn't even know that.
L:  Yeah, 'cause he was, you know, fighting all those nasty communist types.
R:  Right.
L:  And then he got upset at us in the first Gulf War because our troops were stationed in what he considered to be the holy land of Saudi Arabia.  I might add, of course, that there, ah, the Arabians, you know -- I don't know whether request -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- but certainly with their -- their -- their blessing, but that's when he turned against the United States. Because --
R:  I did not even hear about Osama until directly after the World Trade Centre.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, I remember hearing the name now and then, but, you know -- 
R:  Really? 
L:  Yeah --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, 'cause there are so many of those different groups over there, you know, Hamas and I forget all the different names.
R:  Right, it's crazy.
L:  It's, yeah, hard to keep 'em straight sometimes.
R:  [LAUGH] This is my first time doing this.  I'm not really sure, like, d- -- have you done this before? 
L:  One time, it was a while ago, yeah.
R:  Oh.  So you don't feel that we're being threatened by any other countries then in your opinion. Well, --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I really don't have anything to -- to strongly base my opinion on, only by -- I mean, that's just the general feeling in -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in New York that -- that we're being threatened constantly and to be aware constantly.
L:  Yeah.  I guess -- I mean, I'm -- I'm sure that there are terrorists and I'm -- I'm certain there -- there gonna be some other terrorist activities of different degrees and in different places.
R:  Right, but they --
L:  Different places, yeah.
R:  -- they, you know, -- the pol- -- right. 
L:  If -- I certainly don't foresee that a country as a country -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- is going to attack us, you know.  I don't, ah, like I said, I'm sure that -- 
R:  Or it could be that people from that country influencing other countries to, um, join in a attack.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, there's -- there's lots of people that don't like us and I'm sure when somebody --
R:  I mean -- 
L:  -- like al Qaeda or something like that does something against us, that they're not --
R:  Al Qaeda is -- is just generally a group, right? 
L:  Yeah, at -- at least in my understanding, they're -- yeah.
R:  Right. [LAUGH] Oh.  Hello.
L:  Yeah, I'm here. Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  I don't know what else to say.
L:  [MN] Well, like, you know, again, I'm -- I'm -- if -- if we're talking about a country that the official government of a country -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- going out and as an official act of the country seeking to do us -- you know, attack us, I don't see that --
R:  Hm. [NOISE]
L:  -- in the foreseeable future if we're -- we're talking about something more covert or them, you know, underhandedly funneling some money to some kind of terrorist group or something like that.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  That may be.  Of course, we do that kind of stuff all the time too, so -- 
R:  Right, sure.
L:  So, yeah, you know, ah. 
R:  Did you support the war?  Were you, ah, for or against the war? 
L:  I was against it. 
R:  You were against it, yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Half of America was. [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah. But then, see, I'm a -- I'm a child of the sixties, I was -- 
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  Yeah, peace, man, -- 
R:  I'm only seventeen.
L:  Oh, okay. Well, --
R:  I'm sure you can tell, right? [LAUGH]
L:  No, actually I couldn't.
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but of course then see -- you know, I was a peace nick but I also got dressed and I served in Vietnam, so -- 
R:  You -- really? 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  That must have been terrifying.
L:  Yeah, it wasn't exactly fun, that's for sure, no.
R:  You -- you were young when you went?
L:  Actually, no, I was relatively old, I was twenty four because  -- 
R:  Wow.
L:  -- well, it was kind of a long story.  I -- I -- I tried to get out of it based on the fact because I've really only got one good eye, but -- 
R:  And they wouldn't let you? 
L:  No. [inaudible]
R:  [LAUGH] That wasn't good enough for them.
L:  No.  When -- when I graduated from college I thought okay, [COUGH] if they're gonna get me, you know, maybe I'd want to enlist and -- and get a better deal so I went down and I talked to the army, the navy and the airforce.  There wasn't any way I was going to even get -- touch the marines but anyway --
R:  Right. 
L:  And they all, when I told them about my condition, "Oh, no, you don't have a thing to worry about, we don't want you, you can't enlist, you won't get drafted" and, yeah, well, -- 
R:  Right, yeah, and it didn't work out that way.
L:  So much for that, yeah.
R:  How many years were you there? 
L:  Well, I'll tell you what, I got kind of lucky in a way.  Ah, I was there from late seventy one.  Ah, let's see, I went over the end of September seventy one into seventy two.  Um, I don't know how much you know about the history.  This -- this was the time when, ah, seventy two was when Nixon was reelected and he ran against McGovern.
R:  Right.
L:  And, ah, things were kind of winding down.  Anyway, to make a long story short, they -- 
R:  Well, the war being -- it was for communism, right? 
L:  Pardon? 
R:  The war in Vietnam was for communism?  Am I -- 
L:  Well, that -- that was the theory, yeah.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, anyway I -- I got out after only a year and I only was over in Vietnam about six and a half months so I was kind of lucky in that regard.
R:  And you -- you experienced all the jungle warfare and all that? 
L:  Oh, yeah, I seen my share of jungle, that's for sure, yes.
R:  Oh, my goodness, that's crazy.  [MN] Wow.
L:  So, ah, you know, some of the ... I don't know, okay, like around here being a -- the peace nick is not exactly the most, um, --
R:  How -- how is it over there? 
L:  Yeah, you know, we're -- we're not exactly, ah, very numerous and necessarily well thought of but --
