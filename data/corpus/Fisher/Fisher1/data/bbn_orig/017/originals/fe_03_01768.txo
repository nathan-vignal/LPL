L:  Robert Smith.
R:  Linda Maile[?].
L:  How are you? 
R:  I'm doing fine, and you, Robert?
L:  I'm not too bad.  Okay, what was the topic?  I couldn't -- I couldn't understand it very well.
R:  It was concerning foreign government.
L:  Foreign threats?  Foreign threats? 
R:  Right.
L:  Oh, okay.  So --
R:  And do we consider any other country a foreign theat- threat and if so why? 
L:  Oh, well, of course.  I'd -- I would think that, ah, what is it, ah, North Korea is our next biggest threat.  I mean, they've -- they have nuclear capabilities and a -- an insane person in charge.
R:  [LAUGH] They certainly do.
L:  You know, well, I -- he's just like Saddam Hussein.  You know, he -- he doesn't allow his countrymen --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to do anything that, you know, goes against his wishes but yet he's allowed to, you know, procreate with multiple women.  You know, I've read on -- on line the other day that he actually has taken all the triplets in the country and put 'em in a orphanage because he has thoughts that triplets are what his downfall is going to be in the future.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Yeah, that's how insane he is.  And -- and if that's the case does he not realize that putting them all in a orphanage is going to be his downfall because they're all gonna get together and go, "Hey, man, this guy put us all in here together and, you know, just barely gave us enough food to survive".
R:  Took us away from our parents, we don't have a -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- normal childhood.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Wow.
L:  He's -- he's going to develop someone that's going to be his downfall.  I -- I -- I thought that was kind of silly.
R:  Yeah.  How do you feel about, um, religion playing a part?
L:  I am a Buddhist so I kind of, ah, find Judaic Christianity and Muslim thinking to be fantasy.  It's like -- to me it's like someone believing that Star Trek is real, do you know what I mean? 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I don't know what your religious beliefs are but to me it -- I just -- I just think it's silly that people take religion that seriously.  Um, it's -- it's -- to me religion [COUGH] should be a personal thing, not a group fascination with a certain thought or idea, you know.  I mean, that's how I became a Buddhist, was I, you know, read the bible and then I read, you know, a lot of Buddhist text.  I mean, their -- the Buddhist texts fill a library on their own.
R:  Oh, I believe it.
L:  Yeah, there's not just a book of sayings.  I mean, it's, you know, at -- at my temple there's an entire wall that's probably, you know, forty foot long and the shelves are about twenty foot high and it's nothing but two inch to three inch thick books, [LAUGH] you know, and it's, you know, nobody will ever read them all but it's nice to just be able to walk up and read something.
R:  Are most of them written in English? 
L:  And it all makes sense.
R:  Huh?
L:  And it all makes sense, you know.
R:  Are they written in English?
L:  No, no, none of 'em are.  Um, I can get translations from the -- 
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- the monks that work at the temple but, you know -- 
R:  What language are they written in? 
L:  Ah, Hindi I believe.
R:  Oh, that's very interesting.
L:  Ind- Indian, written in Indian.
R:  Well, I believe that Armageddon is upon us.
L:  Oh, yeah.  When I was a practicing Christian, I mean, and this was, like, as recent as five years ago, and I knew that George Bush was going to be the bringer of the Anti Christ, you know, he's going to drown -- he's going to drum up the man that's going to end the world.  And when Tom Ridge came along, that's who my first thought was.
R:  Now, I don't know who Tom Ridge is.
L:  Ah, he is the -- the man in charge of Homeland Security.
R:  Oh, oh, okay.
L:  Tom Ridge, isn't that his name, Tom Ridge? 
R:  I really don't know to be honest with you.
L:  Tom Ridge, I believe that's his name.
R:  I believe the first name is Tom but I'm not really sure of the last name.  It doesn't ring a bell.
L:  Tom Ridge.  Anyway -- 
R:  But that's neither here nor there.
L:  Yeah.  He's -- he's -- he's that guy and, ah, he just -- he -- he -- from what I've been des- -- had described as the Anti Christ is going to be is, ah, -- he matches it pretty well and -- 
R:  Hm, but I thought the Anti Christ was supposed to come from the mid east.
L:  Hm, not necessarily.  He's supposed to come from an -- a scuffle or -- not a scuffle, but a skirmish in the Middle East.  He's not necess- -- there's nowhere that he's -- 
R:  But I thought it said he wore a turban.
L:  Have you seen Tom Ridge's hair? [LAUGH] 
R:  No, no, I can't I say that I remember.
L:  [LAUGH] It looks like it -- it looks like plastic.
R:  Oh, dear.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He needs to see a new barber or hairdresser.
L:  Yeah, yeah, or a new -- 
R:  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Or a new -- a new wig expert.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because that's what it looks like, it looks like a bad wig. 
R:  Oh, my.  Well, I do believe that we are in danger, you know.  A lot of people are saying, "Yay, yay, the war's over", well, it's not, it's just beginning.
L:  Oh, yeah, it's -- until Bush is out of office we'll be at war.  I mean, and that's -- that's going to be his way of getting his second term.
R:  I don't think he's going to get a second term.
L:  Oh, he'll -- he will.
R:  You think so? 
L:  Oh, yeah.  When I was, ah, 'cause, see, I got really deep into Christianity about five years ago and that's what scared me out of it was knowing too much because, I mean, thoughts and flashes came to me and stuff and, ah, Bush -- I knew Bush was going to be elected president before he even announced that he was going to run.  And he's going to get a second term and the world as we know it will change in two thousand twelve.  I'm not saying it's gonna end, but it's gonna change as we know it.  We're all gonna be one, you know what I mean?  One religion, one government, one this, one that, one monetary system.
R:  Well, that's -- yeah, I thought about that when they brought the Euro in.
L:  Yeah, yeah, and that was the beginning.  And what's gonna really be scary is when they -- and the reason they're getting ren- rid of these renegades like, you know, Saddam, I mean, yes, he needs to be getting -- gotten rid of and Kim Jong-il from North Korea, the reason they need to get rid of them is because they can't do what they want to be done with those kind of people in power in places.  You know, they call it democracy but it's actually, um, -- we're no -- we're no freer than the Iraqis were. I mean --
R:  No, I don't believe so.  I think the only thing freedom we have is the freedom of speech.  
L:  And try and sort that out.
R:  We can say what we want.
L:  Have you seen the news lately?  They're trying to cut that out even.  I mean, they're -- they're trying to say that protesting the war is, ah, giving aid and comfort to the enemy.  Isn't that silly? 
R:  Well, my. 
L:  Yeah, aid and comfort to the enemy just because somebody doesn't believe in killing innocent, you know, civilians and their brothers -- 
R:  That does bother me.
L:  Having their brothers -- having their brothers and sisters.  Well, the way I see it is we need both sides of this conflict.  You know, we need the people that say, "No war" and we need the people that say, "Let's kill 'em all".  You know, if we didn't have and believe it or not I learned this from South Park, but, ah, if we didn't have the people that say, "No war", we would all look like a bunch of war mongers, and if we didn't have the people that said, you know, "Let's kill 'em all", we would have been run over a long time ago, you know what I mean?  We'd be speaking French right now.
R:  Well, it did upset me that France didn't support us.
L:  I have never liked the French.  I've got French blood in me and if there was some way to filter it out I would.  I'm -- I mean, I'm just --
R:  That's a very strong statement.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It really is.
L:  Well, I mean, they, ah, you know, they've got their reasons for not wanting to go to war.  Well, their reasons is because they're the ones that have the contracts in Iraq for the oil production right now and Iraq owes them a lot of money so, no, they don't want to go war.
R:  Well, the French owe us money.
L:  Well, yeah, I'm sure that they do and they also have, ah, -- they -- they -- they talk about other countries like, "Oh, well the United States just wants to go in there and take over".  Well, did you know that the French are the only government right now that has territories other than, you know, the country itself, like we have, ah, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, but those are little biddy places that need us, you know.  They need us.  They need somebody and it might as well be us.  Well, the French are still neck deep in Africa, you know, stirring up trouble there left and right trying to be in charge, you know, trying to throw their weight around.  They talk about, you know, "Oh, no more nuclear testing or ban the bomb".  They are the only --
