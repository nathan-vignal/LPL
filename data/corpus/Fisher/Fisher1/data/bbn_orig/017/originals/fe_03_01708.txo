L:  Hi, I'm Vicky. 
R:  Hi Vicky, I'm Ken.
L:  Hi, Ken.  How are you?
R:  Good. [LAUGH]
L:  Foreign affairs.  Do we feel that any company -- any country is a threat to the United -- the States?
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, you first.
L:  Ah, well, I've been wondering what's going on over there in Korea -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- compared to what we've got going already in, you know, with Saddam Hussein and, kinda wondering what's next.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  'Cause they're saying that that -- we're not gonna let that happen to us, Korea is.
R:  Yeah, well, you know, it's a case of, um, um, desperation, I think, on their part.  They're looking for food, for money, for help to prop up a system that hasn't been working very well at all.  Um, not that it's communist or anything else just so much as a, a dictatorship where people don't, you know, perform if they're just told what to do.  Um, so I'm sort of -- yeah, they're a threat, but um, I would of done the same thing for them as I would of done for Iraq, which is to just wait until the regime's changed.
L:  Until the what is?
R:  The regime's changed.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, Saddam wouldn't of lived forever, he was no fundamental threat to us particularly, any more than Russia or Pakistan with nuclear weapons and heavily Islamic fundamentalists could be next week if the present government changes.  Um, I mean, we lived with Russia for, what seventy, eighty years and still they have weapons of mass destruction which are totally dangerous to us and they're not necessarily that friendly. [SIGH]
L:  Right, that's true too.
R:  Anyway.  It's a pity to kill people just to save people.
L:  Yeah.  And then bringing it to light on the news, it's -- you can't avoid it, it's there, it's happening, and you're wondering how the individuals think of it, um, but the more of a threat is in not one company, well looking at Osaman.  Osaman bin Laden, or whatever his name is.
R:  Yeah, Osama, yeah.
L:  You know, his, his current threat of nine one one of course, who else has the capability of putting them plans together that should we be looking at?
R:  Well, I think there are lots of, um, components to, ah, you know, the al Qaeda network, and there may be other terrorist groups not necessarily connected in fighting them and fighting their way.  Of course it's not a question of invading another country with a huge army and everything else to, to, ah, knock it off.  It's, it's a long slow undercover --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, cloak and dagger operation that you have to pursue and get good with, just as some of the other countries have had to do in Europe when they've live for, you know, decades and centuries with hostility.  We just need to do that, trying to take -- and fix it with a sledgehammer won't get you anywhere.
L:  Right.  Well, you seem like a very intelligent person.
R:  Well, I don't know about that, but ...
L:  Or, has kept up with the current issues more than I, um, but that's what my point was, is that I don't think we should have -- think of a threat from a specific country, I think we should be concerned with the little terrorist groups more than a specific country.
R:  That's right.  If we have a country that won't let you go at them, that's a different matter, [MN] you know, if it protects them and won't let you get at them, but I'm not convinced that, um, there is any such country that we can infiltrate and deal with.  However.  Um, ...
L:  Mm.  And, and not, not terrorist or -- but, ah, the chemical warfare.
R:  Yep, yep.
L:  That's more of a -- what I consider a bigger threat than physical force.
R:  Oh, yeah, no, I have a, a relative, a somewhat older person who is dreadfully worried about somebody bringing in a natural gas tanker into the Boston harbour where I live, and, ah, blowing up the city by just blowing up the tanker.  Um, there's so much stuff that comes into this country in containers and in every other way, you know, they could be loaded with all kinds of things from dirty bombs to chemicals to, you name it.  And, um, we're not doing very much to watch over that at this point.
L:  Right.  Um, my son wanted to be an air marshal -- [COUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and -- yeah.  Um, but --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- these -- at the airports where the people are coming in from, what is it, China, Japan --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, you know, that puts him at risk.  The, ah, agent orange is -- agent orange the people have been come in contact well -- with and then proceed to the hospital, I'm concerned about the job, ah, their job, what they chose -- choose to do for a living -- 
R:  Yeah, I would imagine, ah, if, um, your son's working on a plane that has a couple of SARS carr- you know, carriers, um, he would be at risk, that's for sure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, --
L:  But see now, there's all -- there's -- mm, I don't know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We're in North Carolina --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Western North Carolina though, and we've got, ah, the Fort Bragg, I think it is.
R:  Mhm.  Yep, yep.
L:  Yep.  And you always --
R:  And Camp Lejeune too, isn't it, or is it --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  And you're always concerned about if the -- if our military was to be retaliated against, which one would they choose first.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, that type of thing.
R:  Right.
L:  So -- but, um, --
R:  Well, you know, the interesting thing is that countries like Israel, of course, have been dealing with this for -- since their beginning.
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  Um, --
L:  -- it's in the Bible all the way through -- 
R:  Yep.
L:  -- just another war.  So, um, -- but, oh, still it's sad it has to happen.
R:  Yep, yep.
L:  You know, peace and love. [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.  Well, I guess the bottom line there are a number of countries that are a potential danger to us, but um, you know, if you know that and you take appropriate safeguards in, in my view the best thing to do is to sit still and let the age -- you know, the regimes self destruct as they all eventually do.  Um, you know.  I mean, Saddam in, in, in Iraq couldn't have lasted that much longer. [SIGH] Um, --
L:  Well, you say that, why do you say that?
R:  He was an older man.  He was getting old.  He's got a lot of people --
L:  Well he coulda done a --
R:  -- looking for his job.
L:  Yeah, but he still could of done a lot of damage in the ten -- if he lasted another ten years.
R:  Well, to whom?
L:  Well, if you believe the stories on TV --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- which I'm not sure if I do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But to his own people.  The harm he was doing to his own people.
R:  Yeah, and, and, and -- well, on the one hand I'm happy they're liberated, or think they are for the moment.  The other side of the coin is people have to, you know, ah, do their own liberating.  Of course, the tragedy in that situation is that we did encourage them to do it under the first George Bush, and when they did we didn't help them one bit.  Instead we let get hun- we let hundreds of thousands of them get killed, ah, for having tried.
L:  What's your age, may I ask?
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, I'm in, in sixties or so.
L:  You -- that's why you're so knowledgeable.
R:  Well --
L:  I'm only forty five, so --
R:  Oh, you're a kiddo.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You --
R:  I don't --
L:  I could learn --
R:  -- think that's particularly why.
L:  -- something from you.  I could learn something from your living.
R:  Well.
L:  So, but --
R:  We could all learn from each other.
L:  Yes, yes we can.  You know, as my father, he wants my son to go in the military -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he's twenty six.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, I -- I just don't know.
R:  Well, it's -- it's a good profession if he's willing to take on the bad side, which is to be, you know, put at risk from time to time.
L:  I bet you --
R:  I would rather be in, however, a military such as our own where normally the government is, um, one that ends wars rather than starts them.
L:  Correct.
R:  And, um, that would --
L:  That all --
R:  -- that's a position to be proud of.
L:  That leads to politician- ah, better politicians.
R:  Yep, right.
L:  Which I don't think we're going to change in ten minutes.
R:  Yeah, we all down there have to vote more democratic.
L:  Yes.  More democratic?
R:  Right.
L:  Mm.
R:  Too many, ah, in the south are shifting to, ah, Republican and they're getting people like Chaney and Rumsfeld and, um, these other characters who are, um, I don't think particularly, con- -- you know, concerned with anything other than making a lot of money.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I think Colin Powell's a good guy, but I don't think he has any more latitude.
L:  You know, I think this conflict with other countries though is definitely affecting our economy --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and not for the good.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I know -- my husband's in environmental, and he can't -- he -- because of NAFTA and this nine one one economy, there -- there's no jobs.  He's painting.
R:  Mhm.  Well, there's two or three hundred billion dollars going into Iraq from our treasury.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  And, um, you know, what could you have done with that money if we had it over here?
L:  Oh.
R:  Um.  Heck of a lot.
L:  Yep.
R:  So.
L:  But really, other -- what, what can I do other than writing letters, you know?  And doing what I'm doing right now, expressing my opinion.
R:  Well, that's half the battle.  Um, it can
