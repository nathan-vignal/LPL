L:  Hello, my name is Quack and I'm from New Jersey.
R:  Hi, my name is Steve and I'm from Manhattan.
L:  Very good. 
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm well, how are you? 
R:  Pretty good.  Well, foreign policy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  As it affects, ah -- if there are any countries out there that, ah, that we think are a threat to us.  Mhm.  I actually feel pretty threatened these days.
L:  Wow, you would -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Being from Manhattan, you'd have to. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You have been attacked in your own home.
R:  Yeah, yeah, we kind of, ah, deal with that every day a little bit over here.
L:  Yeah, how far are you from ground zero? 
R:  Um, well I used to live only three miles from it -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and now I'm six miles from it, I'm uptown -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- up in the -- up in -- in Northern Harlem.
L:  Very good.
R:  So, a lot of us moved north.
L:  Yeah, well, sounds like a wise thing to do.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, um ...
R:  I think the countries that -- ah, it's funny that this came up because I just got back from, ah, hanging out with some friends at a bar and, um, one of them was --
L:  Can you hold on for just one second?
R:  Sure.
L:  [NOISE] I'm sorry.
R:  That's all right.
L:  Somebody just decided to come to my door.  Usually that doesn't happen but anyhow.
R:  Well, I um, I feel -- it's funny because, ah, I was just talking with some friends who, ah, were saying, oh, you know, I'd love to go to Indonesia, I'd love to go to Egypt, I want to do this and that, some day and now I'm totally turned off. [LAUGH] 
L:  By foreign travel? 
R:  Well, not foreign travel but to certain places.
L:  To those -- those particular parts of the world.
R:  Yeah, places that are mostly Muslim -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I feel like -- not that I have anything against Muslims in particular but I just feel like it's, ah, not a wise idea for a travel plan.
L:  Well, I know that -- you know, I work for a place that is of Christian orientation and a few years back they took the kids -- over the kids to Israel -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then last year there was supposed to be a trip but it got cancelled because of the political climate and, you know.
R:  I bet.
L:  I don't know when they'd think about [NOISE] going again.
R:  [MN] Yeah, I don't -- I think that if I was a parent, ah, for any kids that were thinking of travelling to Israel, that I would definitely make them think otherwise, you know, for a little while.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, what countries do you feel, um, are, ah, are countries that are a threat directly to the US? 
L:  Well, I -- I have to think that -- that we should be worried about South Korea. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah. Yeah, that's a big issue in North Korea and South Korea.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, I know.  They -- 
L:  I don't know if they are going to be -- if they are going to emerge as the next problem country or -- or whether it's all, you know, just talk.
R:  Yeah.  With the -- the nukes that the North Koreans are developing and stuff? 
L:  Well, that -- that's what they are saying, they are developing nukes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, if -- if that's the case and they're, you know, not willing to use them responsibly or ...
R:  Countries like that, that just -- it makes me so, um, irate that -- that the local superpowers can't do anything about that, like China and Japan should be involved or Russia or somebody.
L:  Well, the thing is that they are not all of the superpowers or not all of the major countries have the same philosophy that we do.
R:  That's true.
L:  You know, but -- but I happened to read just before we started this war with Iraq a very nice article in the Readers Digest where they interviewed Tony Blair and Tony Blair explained why countries like the United States and Great Britain have to be concerned about negative activities in other countries.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and he kind of -- he took the position that, you know, if -- if people are doing bad things then somebody really ought to stop them.
R:  Somebody has to step in.
L:  Yeah, for the good of the hu- humanity, if you will.
R:  Ahah. 
L:  I thought -- 
R:  That makes sense.
L:  -- I thought that the way he re- -- he explained it was, you know, a lot more concise than a lot of the rhetoric we are hearing here.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, we are definitely hearing a lot of -- a lot of rhetoric and media play here.  I -- I thought it was so funny how quicksand had changed everything from, um, the -- the -- the war in Iraq and everything to the New Iraq.  They were pretty quick [LAUGH] to change that, you know.  It -- it's -- it's a funny thing.  I -- I'd have to agree with you that, um, that I think that North Korea and some of the remnants of these, ah, the old, you know, communist days are probably, um, pretty big threats, ah, as well as probably Iran pretty soon.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And Pakistan, yeah. 
L:  Yeah, they could gear up again.
R:  Yep.  That wouldn't be a good thing. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The -- it's not -- it's not all about as -- as much as people keep trying to make it out to be just a religious war thing, it's definitely not that.
L:  Right, or an economical war.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Yeah, I was -- yeah, I -- I was -- I was on the fence about the war, I was kind of leaning more pro action than -- than anti action.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But the minute I began to see footage of people actually being grateful to our soldiers for coming in then I kind of said you know what, I think this is okay.
R:  Yeah, I felt the same way too.  I was very, um, -- very much thinking oh great, here we go again, you know, trying to just force the stuff down everybody's throat all over and then when I saw that, you know, people were very, very -- after a little while people were very open and honest and happy about it and I thought well, you know, it's about time, maybe -- maybe they really do want Saddam to go, and, you know, they want something new.
L:  Well, apparently he was a very evil sort of fellow.
R:  Yeah.  It's like they're -- they're local version of a -- of a little Hitler or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, oh, that's good.  I -- I heard in the news today that, um, um, they're, you know, they're having a big pilgrimage down to -- down to some place, um, of the Shiites that were flailing themselves and everything and they were thankful that they could go on a pilgrimage and clear themselves because Saddam wouldn't let them but then they were all saying "Death to America, death to America", [LAUGH] and I was saying wait a minute you wouldn't be able to do that if we hadn't just freed you.
L:  Yeah, well, it's amazing what freedom does for people.
R:  [LAUGH] That's true, even over here.
L:  People can express all kinds of points of view that aren't particularly, you know, pro American or pro society or pro constitution and they -- they have the right to say that as long as they are not, you know, real dangerous, like you can't say, "Fire" in a crowded theatre but otherwise --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you can say pretty much what you'd like to say. 
R:  Everywhere else, yeah.  That's true.  We have been -- we have been watching some pretty interesting, um, um, you know, ah, demonstrations and stuff over here in -- in New York.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.
R:  Some of them that were -- that were sanctioned and some that weren't but pretty much all of them went off pretty well, so.  I have some friends that were in the anti war demonstration and then a few friends that -- that were in the pro [LAUGH] one and the pro one was sanctioned and the anti one wasn't.
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, ah, it pretty much was the same thing, same kind of attendance, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It just depends on what -- on what people's views are but other than that we don't have as much freedom as we used to, I think here, but I think that it's still, ah, better than what most countries have so ... 
L:  I would imagine, that, you know, you feel that more strongly where you are than where -- where I am.
R:  Mhm, true.
L:  You know, because -- 
R:  That's true.
L:  -- I mean, I haven't flown anywhere since nine eleven.
R:  Oh, you haven't? 
L:  No, it's not -- it's not necessarily even by choice as -- as --  
R:  Just hasn't come up.
L:  -- you know by opportunity because we are going on a cruise in June.
R:  Okay.
L:  And we are -- yeah, we do need to get to Florida -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and pretty much planning on flying.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, -- you know, so I haven't -- I haven't really felt the effects of -- of nine eleven on airport security and --  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, you know, I haven't -- I haven't really gone into the city all that much.  I -- I live right outside of Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  You know, and I guess -- I guess the biggest thing that has happened in our area is that, you know, they have -- they have closed the Liberty Bell for -- for periods of time and they closed the street, the front of Independence Mall and all that -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and now because they have reopened the street they have closed Independent Hall so they can install more security procedures.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  But other than that, you know, it --  
R:  That's kind of isolated.
L:  Right after the war started I had to go out of the state and -- and there was talk of, you know, oh, gee, maybe there will be, you know, police on the bridges stopping people and maybe, you know, there will be this and that going on.  The only thing that I really noticed was that on the highway, you know, there were signs that said that the country was under an increased terror alert and to, um, report suspicious activity and there was an eight hundred number.
R:  Mhm.  I don't think I've seen that, uh.
L:  But other than that I've -- you know, I've been pretty fortunate.  Again, you're, you know, you're kind of right in the middle of it.
R:  Yeah, we've seen, um, national guard troops, ah, ah, almost every day for the past month or two, um, and the -- all the subway stations.
L:  Ahah.
R:  And some of them, it's so funny, there are -- there are women soldiers that are only like four feet five or four feet eight and -- and the guns that they are holding are a little bit longer than them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, I have seen them -- a lot of them, you know, with, ah, increased police protection everywhere and I was actually out in, um, Jersey last weekend, I went down to Atlantic City -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and when we came back in, the, um, Holland Tunnel, they were stopping anything that looked like it had a big enough trunk or --  
L:  Sure.
R:  -- container just to look inside so it was -- you know, you  kind of see it and feel it all over the place.  It's not -- it's not a huge one [inaudible] feeling.
L:  Well, yeah, again I can imagine you are just so much clo-
