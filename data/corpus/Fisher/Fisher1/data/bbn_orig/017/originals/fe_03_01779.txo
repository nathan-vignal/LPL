L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, how are you? 
R:  I'm good, how are you?
L:  Not bad, not bad at all.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Daryl.
R:  Um, my name is Anne.
L:  Okay.  Nice to meet you.
R:  Mhm, yeah, nice to meet you too.
L:  Okay.  Now, the topic -- I didn't quite get the topic because I had the speaker phone on and as I ran over here and got the phone when I heard the topic. 
R:  Okay, um, the topic is, um, education and computers, are they helping or hurting?  So I would say that they do a little bit of both because I've been reading some articles about how some kids, um, go into the computer and they're able to get, like, um, the test or exams that they're having.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then they pass it on to other students and the parents don't really intervene one way or the other unless the students are caught and then -- 
L:  Yeah, I wonder because, see, I haven't read too much -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of, ah, anything in this area.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, my opinion -- opinions would be pretty much just that, it's not going to be anything that's, ah, based on, ah, anything factual -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that I've read, you know, studies or anything of that sort.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, yeah, I mean, how are they able to do that?  How are they able to go in and actually ascertain that kind of info? 
R:  Um, they have, um, um, code words or, um, you know, if -- if they're in the click, then, you know, they've done quite a bit of research and especially if they are, like, you know, hackers, they know everything about the computers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you know, they're able to, like, um -- if they don't find the exact thing that, you know, they're being tested on, they can find something sim- pretty similar to it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then they just pass it along to their friends and stuff and -- and they have the heads up on -- on the other kids that don't.  So I would say that, um, computers are helpful in a, um, a lot of ways, but then they are hurting the kids in -- in some other ways -- 
L:  I'm wondering now -- 
R:  -- you know, especially --
L:  -- like, if you -- if they were to go and they get a test -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or to get questions that would be similar to ones that they might have -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on, you know, a test, an upcoming test -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I mean, because they could basically formulate their own questions.  I -- I'm just wondering how they would consider that to be kind of like a bad thing.  I mean, it's not cheating.  I mean, it's not like they're out --
R:  Yeah, but they do cheat with them, they do cheat.
L:  But how do they do that?  I guess that's what I'm trying to understand.
R:  Um -- 
L:  Because like --
R:  -- sometimes they're able to, um, get into an inst- instructor's -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- computer, you know. 
L:  All right, sometimes they're able to do that. 
R:  And, like, get that test, right. 
L:  Okay, so you mean, like, actually go and find out what his password might be to -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay, yeah, well, that's cheating.
R:  Mhm, right. 
L:  I mean, that typically, I mean -- I just basically feel that of course computers -- I -- I -- I think they're great.
R:  Mhm, me too, I love 'em.
L:  I mean, oh, God, we're, you know, I love what --
R:  I -- I don't know how I'd have survived, you know, without the Internet for -- for -- for the years that I didn't but now that I have it, I don't -- I don't think I could go back to not ever having it, you know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, it's just such a great thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, in terms of 'cause people get information or, like, right now, like, -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, we're talking about this topic -- 
R:  Mhm, right.
L:  To be able to go in and just punch in a few key words.
R:  Mhm, exactly.
L:  And, um, you know, get some information.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Download some information on -- on the subject.
R:  I mean, it's just, um, you can make money with it.  You can, you know, do your, ah, banking and, you know, I mean it -- it just makes life so much easier.
L:  Mm.
R:  And you don't even have to leave home if you don't want to.
L:  I mean, because I know, like, right, now, um, I think what is also great that they're doing with computers in terms of learning is that, you know, the on line classes, some colleges -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, they have that set up.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, you know, I -- I think that's a pretty great thing -- 
R:  It is.
L:  -- especially if a person is working.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And wants to further their education, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Advance in terms of getting another degree or whatever.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, that they wouldn't have to worry about maybe travelling.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, travel time is the big thing.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, working nine, maybe eight, nine, ten hours a day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then having to go and sit in a class for another hour and a half.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or, you know, something of that sort.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, it could be quite draining.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I think that that's a really good thing.
R:  Yeah, I think that's -- 
L:  I think that's a great thing that they have going with that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How do you feel about that?
R:  Yeah, I feel that's an excellent thing and like you say, you don't have to leave home, you can, you know, have your kids and -- and still be doing your work -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, you could with watching them at the same time so it's, like, you could, um, you know, be multiplexing, you know -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and being, um, -- continuing your education all at the same time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I think that, um, they're great but somebody's always going to find, you know, something bad to come out of it, but overall I think they're an excellent tool.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I mean 'cause there's a down side to everything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, the good and bad kind of coexists side by side.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, always.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I tend to try to stay focussed more on the, you know, the positive uses, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't have that kind of diabolical -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- mind where I want to go and, you know, hack in -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to somebody else's private stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, -- 
R:  I wouldn't have the patience to try and do it, I just wouldn't, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, I mean -- I know, see, I mean, I like using computers -- 
R:  Me too, I love it.
L:  -- I do, but I don't have a love -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for computers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, so it's not something where I actually would like to invest that kind of time to find out how to do that.
R:  Mhm, me either.
L:  I mean, the extent of --
R:  I just want to do my things and the ways that it helps me.
L:  Mm.
R:  Then, you know, and then because, you know, there are such a variety of ways that I use it to enhance my life so, you know, I just want it to be able to do that, you know, and I wouldn't -- 
L:  Exactly.  I mean, that's -- that's pretty much the extent of my -- my interest as well.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I guess I'm not trying to learn any -- any really in depth applications -- 
R:  Mhm, me either.
L:  -- you know, in terms with the computer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I'd just like to use it basically for, you know, to research things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And to do, you know, take care of my private affairs.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's really about it.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, yeah, I mean, I think that, yeah, ultimately it's a very good thing.
R:  Me too.
L:  You know, it's a very good thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, wow, hey, look, I can't shed -- look, I can't shed a whole lot of light on this topic.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Not like the other two.  Look, I talked about -- I had two other -- other topics that were pretty good but -- 
R:  Okay, this is my first one in a while.
L:  Are you serious?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  How -- how -- how long have you done this?  How often have you done this?
R:  Um, this is my second time.
L:  Oh, this is your second time? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  I -- I think I did one, like, a couple of months ago and it was about, um -- 
L:  You did it the three -- ah, the three call ins or whatever or [COUGH] ...? 
R:  No, mhm, mhm, I just did one. 
L:  Or you just did one like this? 
R:  Right.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And I talked to another lady.  We talked about, um, something about trials --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- or victims I think or something like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, ah, it was pretty interesting, mhm.
L:  Wow.
R:  Well -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Not [LAUGH] about education and computers.
L:  [LAUGH] Hey, look, isn't that deep?  I tell you it loo- it loo- that was a pretty open and shut discussion there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, what kinda -- what else could I add to this?  Let me -- let me think.
R:  But it is, you know, very educational I think for the kids, um, even, the, um, um, kindergarten kids are learning, you know, to use the computer and I think that's a good thing so that they will really be, um, you know, advanced users by the time that they're in maybe fifth or sixth grade probably.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, because I know my grandson, he's eleven and he can -- he can really maneuver around and do a lot of things that, you know, I couldn't a few years ago, so -- 
L:  Mhm, and they actually need to know those things.
R:  Yeah, they do.
L:  Absolutely need to know them.
R:  Yeah, because it's a very, um, highly technolog- --
L:  Hold on one second?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm on the phone.  Hello.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yes, I'm sorry.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, our world is so, um, high tech nowadays --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that the kids have to know these things.
L:  Yes, I'm sorry.  Yeah, everything is so very high tech now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's absolutely -- computer knowledge is absolutely essential, and I think -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the earlier that it starts -- 
R:  The better.
L:  -- the better.
R:  Mhm, true. 
L:  Because I didn't encounter, um, computers, and at the time when I was learning -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, PCs were just really becoming all the rage.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Me, I was back in the -- 
R:  When was this, like, in the nineties or something?
L:  Yeah, well, you know, this was back in the early eighties. 
R:  Okay.
L:  This is back around about, ah, because I went to Dobbin and I took computer technology -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I was in that, um, shop, you know, the vocational school.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, you know, we were -- 
R:  Yeah, I think I started around eighty six or something like that.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We were using then, ah, they were just coming off the punch cards and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that kind of thing. Um --
R:  Yeah, we didn't even have the Internet then.
L:  Yeah, there was no Internet, there was none of that stuff.
R:  Mhm, mhm. 
L:  I mean, everything was still black and white, computers were still black and white.
R:  Yeah, and they were -- 
L:  Graphics and all that stuff.
R:  -- you know kind of big, right. 
L:  Yeah, they were big and bulky -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and took up basically your whole desk.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  All the space on your desk top.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but, um, yeah, even then, I mean, we still -- all these different software applications they have now we had to program in.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We had to actually program in.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, yeah, I mean, that was very laborious.  I mean, if you wanted it to go into print things in a certain column in a certain way -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, you know, certain text you had to go and do a flow chart and program all that stuff in.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- 
R:  I know that was time consuming.
L:  Oh, very time consuming.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then if you have an error you've got to go back and --
R:  Yep.
L:  You know, I mean, oh, wow, that just, you know, -- 
R:  Mhm, you know -- 
L:  Like, um.
R:  So what, wh-, um, what part of the, um, globe are you calling from? [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, I'm from Philly.
R:  Okay, I'm in, um, Georgia, Atlanta.
L:  Oh, you're in Georgia? 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, okay, okay, excellent, excellent.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Wow, okay, how's that?
R:  How's the weather there today? 
L:  Um, little on the cold side actually.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, I think it's -- 
R:  It's a little chilly here but the sun is shining really bright.
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's not shining brightly here.  It's very overcast.
R:  Okay.
L:  April here is usually very overcast just about every day.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I'm glad we're coming out of that, but the thing is, that, yeah, I thought that everybody, you know, pretty much, that they were from Philadelphia, I guess all -- I didn't know people were calling from all the rest.  
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  That's interesting. That's something else I just found out.
R:  Different states and everything, yeah.
L:  Okay. 
R:  Yeah, they just hook you -- I mean, this is amazing.  I -- I feel that, you know, for them to be able to do this -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  It's -- it's really different.
