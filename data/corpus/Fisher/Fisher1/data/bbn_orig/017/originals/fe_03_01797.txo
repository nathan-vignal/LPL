L:  Hello? 
R:  Hello.
L:  My name's Kim.
R:  My name's Krystal.
L:  Hi.  What was it -- does it harm or --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah --
L:  -- beneficial?
R:  Yeah, computers in education, how we feel about them.
L:  Um, my daughter's only four and a half.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  So she doesn't use computers in school, yet.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Well actually, I guess she do- they do have one, but she doesn't use it.
R:  Right.
L:  But she has one at home that she uses, and she loves it.  But I guess if they -- it could be, it could be both.  It could be beneficial, it could not be, because they don't -- they just use the internet then instead of using library as a resource anymore.  They just look everything up on the internet.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  They -- and the kids don't know how to look things up in the library.
L:  No.  I know that's what my niece and nephew do, they use the internet to do all their homework, as much as possible.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I have, um, four kids from age eight to twenty two, and [SIGH] I guess ... well, I really, I guess this isn't something I really thought about. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, we have internet at home --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know, my boys, the three oldest sons are boys, they're -- they use it for talking with their friends, instant messaging and, um, recording music.  Nothing educational.
L:  From that aspect it's kind of good.
R:  Hm?
L:  In that aspect it's kinda good then, for them.  That they don't use it for education purposes.  That they're strictly book related.
R:  Mm.
L:  So they use their books and that.
R:  Well, [LAUGH] the oldest son plain just didn't do -- [LAUGH]
L:  Pardon?
R:  -- his homework either, but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I guess my third son, he's a freshman in high school, he does use it for his homework too.  Um, --
L:  I guess I could go either way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It, it depends on the kid, I would think.  I don't --
R:  Yeah, some kids really take to it, you know, and some don't, you know.  Um, --
L:  I, I could definitely see my daughter using the internet to do her homework, since she's so -- so loves the computer right now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she loves playing, like at Nic Junior.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Playing all the games and that.
R:  Yeah, my eight year old loves it too.  Um, she -- if she sees and address on TV, you know, Disney or what- you know, Barbie, she'll go and type it in, and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and, um, visit, you know. [LAUGH] She's --
L:  But then -- okay, in that aspect then that's educational too then, 'cause she's, she's learning to put, you know, two and two together, that web address on TV, that she can type that in on the computer and, you know, get what she --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- get to Barbie.  So in that aspect it's educational, 'cause she's learning that.
R:  Yeah, I was just amazed at how young she could do that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or take the box of macaroni and cheese, and haul it in by the computer in as the cheesiest dot com, or something like that -- 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and she would type it in. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH] That's pretty cool.  Oh, I have so much to look forward to.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I can see mine doing that.  I used to have, ah, -- oh, God, what was it called?  Q-bert or something.  It was some little -- it looked exactly like a mouse, and you, you ran the infrared light over any UPC symbol, and it automatically brought up the web site.  And I was addicted to that for a while, taking everything that had a UPC symbol and swiping it across there and bring up -- see if they had web sites and that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I can see my daughter, any time she sees a web site on TV, going, "Momma, momma, I want to type that in and check that out".
R:  Mhm.
L:  So that's, that -- from that aspect I guess that's educational.
R:  As far as in schools, you know, it really -- for teachers, it -- it --
L:  I think it's a easy way out for teachers --
R:  Maybe.
L:  -- to have them --
R:  But they have access to such -- so much more than you would ever have.
L:  Well that -- yeah, that's true.
R:  You know.
L:  I don't think they'd ever get it in a book, one book.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Um, educational things, I'm sure there's a lot of educational things that they can use in their classroom available on the internet.  Um, ... but then I always wonder if there's one kid over in the corner who's watching -- who's clicking on pornography type -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I wonder how that would -- I wonder if they have blockers so they can't do stuff like that.
R:  I would imagine in schools they probably do.
L:  I'd hope so.
R:  I would hope so, yeah.
L:  I know I don't have anything blocked on mine right now, but then my daughter doesn't know how to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- type words, or -- she only goes on if, like, I let her on --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and bring her to the site.
R:  Oh, I mean, you can type in something -- there was a, a grandma in our neighbourhood who wanted some recipes, and she typed in hot dish. [LAUGH]
L:  And it brought up something?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Hot dishes.  You know, that's kind of a Midwestern thing.
L:  Nice.
R:  I don't know where you're from. 
L:  Wisconsin.
R:  Oh, yeah.  See, I'm in Minnesota.  You know, here we call it hot dish, but other -- in the rest of the world it's called casserole. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  But when she typed in hot dish, she got a lot more than recipes. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  It was pretty funny. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.  I'll have to remember that one.
R:  I would think the schools would have to have filters on them.
L:  Yeah, but then something like that, who would ever think.  I would of never in a million years imagined hot dish would brought something unrelated to food up.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So how, how do they have blockers in school, and --
R:  Yeah, I don't know how well those work.
L:  Wow.  
R:  You know.
L:  Okay, now I'm not a fan of computers in school. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Hm.  But, no, that's -- I don't know -- just -- I never thought about it either.  I guess -- 
R:  But you know what, it's just so accessible on the internet, you know, when you bring up like your Yahoo home page, or something.  I -- not that I've studied it, but I think every search engine has, you know, adult entertainment, or -- you know, something on their home page.  You know, it's just as easy as can be.
L:  Hm.  You know what, I'll have to check that out.  I don't even -- 
R:  Oh, I think so.
L:  -- I have AOL.
R:  In fact, um, there's -- my oldest son, I can -- he doesn't live at home, but for a while there I could tell that he was using the computer [LAUGH] not in the way that I would intend it.
L:  Ah.
R:  We had to have a little chat. [LAUGH] And, um, after he visited those -- and now this is something, I get, I get emails with pornographic stuff in.
L:  Yeah, I get tons of those a week.
R:  How do we get those on -- how do we --
L:  I just --
R:  -- get on lists like that?  I mean, I've certainly never visited any site like that.
L:  They, they use, um, if you've ever -- well, one is if you've ever gone to, like, a game room to play a game, and they have a chat room attached to that particular game, some people just, like, sit there and write down people's addresses.  Like AOL for example, when you go in to play their games, your name that you're playing as is your screen name, so then they use that, or some people just take, like, um, they'll just take chem, and they'll write chem, and they'll write chem one, chem two, chem three, and they'll do it like that, and they're bound to hit somebody with a screen name like that.
R:  One thing that helped to cut down on those for a while was I went in and erased all my cookies, cleared my cookies.
L:  Right.
R:  And then that helped for a while, but now I'm gradually getting them back again.
L:  Yeah, same here.
R:  So --
L:  It's really annoying.  All I do is keep hitting report spam, report spam.  And then -- but mine comes up where if I report it as spam, then it automatically blocks that person's address from ever sending me something again.  But that doesn't stop them 'cause all they do is change their name.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And then do it all over again.
R:  And they say you shouldn't do the unsubscribe at the bottom, because that just tells them that you're really there, you know.
L:  Right.  I didn't -- that's what I was doing for the longest time, I'd click on it and go, unsubscribe me, or I'd type them back email, a nasty
