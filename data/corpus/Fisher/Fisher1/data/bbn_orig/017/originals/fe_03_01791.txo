L:  Heather. 
R:  Hi, I'm Pat.
L:  Hi.
R:  Do you have a name? [LAUGH]
L:  Heather, yeah.  Uh huh.
R:  Heather, oh, sorry, I didn't hear that.
L:  That's okay.
R:  Hi, Heather.
L:  Hi.
R:  Do you have an opinion on computers in education?
L:  Um, I would have to say that they enhance education.
R:  Are you somebody  you sound like you might be younger, are you somebody who's used computers while you were going to school, or if you're going to school now?
L:  Um, I did use them for part of my college education, but my children also use those.
R:  Uh huh.
L:  I have a son that's, ah, in kindergarten, and he's learned from a lot of, ah, computer programs.
R:  Wow.  Do you  that's amazing.  Well, you've seen  ah, I know what kids can do on computers today is absolutely amazing, it 
L:  Right.
R:  Do you think that they rely too much on them?  Do you think they can add on their own if they had to, that kind of stuff, or 
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So you don't see that it's, it's a problem? 
L:  No.
R:  No.  Well that's great.
L:  No.
R:  What do you think they  what to you think it helps most?  Is there anything in particular?  Do you think it's language skills or math, or 
L:  Um, I guess in, in my experience it would probably be math for my children, um, as well as, like, problem solving.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, 
R:  Do you  do they use particular  what do you  what do they use?  Do they use games or do they use specific education sites 
L:  Um  
R:   or how does that work?  I don't really know.
L:  A little bit of both, we have a lot of the Reader Rabbit programs, um, that are geared towards specific ages and specific subjects, reading, math, and so on.  Um, and he [NOISE] he has also, you know, been on line before at different sites and stuff 
R:  Uh huh.
L:   but that's more, that's probably more games that 
R:  Mhm.
L:   it would be, um, educational.  But we also have Encyclopedia Britannica and, um, some other things loaded on to his computer that he's researched different  he's very, um, he's very science oriented, so he 
R:  Great. 
L:   likes to learn about weather systems and things like that, even though 
R:  Oh.
L:   he's only in kindergarten, he's big on 
R:  That's wonderful.
L:   on that type of thing.  So 
R:  And now, how 'bout for you, Heather, in your, ah, you're a young mom, so how far as it been since you were out of school?  Not a  probably just a few years, I guess.
L:  [NOISE] It is, um, I actually went back to school, I'm, ah, in the process of getting a nursing degree 
R:  Oh,  
L:   but, um, 
R:   good for you.
L:   it's kind of, um, on again off again, kind of around 
R:  Hard to do with the little one.
L:  It is.  I'm waiting 'til my second one starts kindergarten and then I'll resume that, but I have, um, actually my last college course they sent home, or a CD came with the, um, the book.  It was anatomy and physiology.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And this CD you could load on your computer and you could see, like, moving  moving graphics of, you know, the muscles and things like that to help you, um, 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:   get kind of a three D 
R:  Oh, how interesting.
L:   view of different things.  So yeah, it was 
R:  Oh wow.
L:   it was really helpful.  And it gave you, um, like in motion, um, diagrams of how, you know 
R:  Much ea-  much  even for me your describing it sounds it much better to visualize that way than just as you say a picture on a book.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  That's fascinating.
L:  And what is  what is your opinion?
R:  Well, I haven't had  my own experience in school was before computers was  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:   the stone age it sounds like now.  Um, and in work it was pretty much, ah, you know, I didn't really, I wouldn't say educational, just using it in work, so I've seen my, my niece's kids, who are about your kids' ages, I guess 
L:  Yeah.
R:   ah, just, you know, how easily and how  it's just another thing for them to get on, on, you know, on the computer.  But I can imagine.  I think we're just limited by our own imagination, though, the smart people who are dreaming up these programs and so forth 
L:  Right.
R:   and I guess the other thing is people are probably taking lots of courses on line and things like that, you don't even have to be in a, in a, in a classroom anymore.
L:  Right.  That, that's very true.
R:  My niece is a former regular classroom teacher, and now she's working with, um, ah, a group that does  ah, in home schooling.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And, um, you know, they're sort of all over the state, it's within the state of Pennsylvania.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, so they're  you know, they're teaching their kids, and I'm sure the people who are teaching their kids are using a lot of computer type assistance.  That was one of the things 
L:  Right.
R:   this organization that she works for, ah, was helping.  The  some of these folks had not been on computers, but in  to get into this program that was part of it.  They, they supplied these computers and then, you know, had to  I guess there were just certain amount of things that they share on line and things like that 
L:  Right.
R:   so it definitely is  it, it, you know, we're not going back to paper and pencil, that's for sure.
L:  No, you know, if you remember when you needed to research something a long time ago you had to go to the library 
R:  Right.
L:   and you had to look 
R:  Oh, right.
L:   through card catalogs, and you know, it would take you forever to, just to flip through books 
R:  Oh sure.
L:   and try to find the information you needed.  Now, you know, you just type in the word 
R:  Mhm.
L:   and it comes up with so many different resources to find the answers.
R:  It's incredible.  It really is incredible.
L:  Yeah, and it, it's very helpful, especially when you have children asking questions [LAUGH] that you 
R:  Yeah.
L:   don't know the answer to.
R:  Well even I, I mean, somebody was telling me, oh so and so was at their house and he was, he was, I forget what the story was, and he needed to get a quote from either Socrates, Plato, or Aristotle, and I said -- and it took him -- he was dawdling around and I said, "He couldn't just go on line?" [LAUGH] Even I knew that you could go on 
L:  Right.
R:   line and get that stuff.  You know, in five seconds or something like that.  You know, Ask Jeeves or whatever, I don't know what 
L:  Right, right.
R:   I don't know what kids use, but 
L:  Right.
R:   so that's, that's terrific.
L:  Yeah, we had a bug, um, the other day  well, several bugs of one cer- -- particular kind that we didn't know what it was, so we went on line 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:   and we were  I mean, I didn't realize there was that many insects in the world. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  But, you know, we typed in small red insect 
R:  You described it.
L:  Yeah, and it came out with 
R:  You had a thousand choices. [LAUGH]
L:  It did, but it helped narrow it down, I mean, at least we kinda had 
R:  To where you live, or 
L:   an idea of what it could be. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh huh.
L:  So, yeah.  And it was kinda fun in the process, trying to learn what it was.  So 
R:  And of course, as a student you've probably used a computer for  I mean, the word processing part of it is certainly 
L:  Right.
R:   you know, so, so much further along than anything I used when I was typing up papers, and 
L:  Right.
R:   all that kind of stuff.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, even like my old typewriter, you know, if you messed up you had to  you had that white out ribbon or whatever you had to go back 
R:  Well you probably don't remember carbon paper. [LAUGH]
L:  I do, actually. [LAUGH]
R:  I remember that, trying to correct eight copies of something or other.
L:  Yeah.
R:  God, it does sound like prehistoric ages, honest to God.
L:  It does, I mean, I can't imagine what my kids are going to have 
R:  Yeah. 
L:   when they're older, but 
R:  Well that's it, isn't that a  it's true, you know, you  I  again I think it's but our  what our own brains, and I, I have to give credit to the people who can think of these things and say, you know,  and I can remember seeing some of these and thinking, well, what would you use that for?  You know, 
L:  Right.
R:   and I still run into people now, and I ask them  I'm retired now, I said, "Well, you know, have you gotten a computer?", you know.  "Well, what would I use that for?"  So, you know, we still have to  a lot of people still are resistant to that 
L:  Right.
R:   which is, I'm sure at your age 
L:  I think it can be intimidating  
R:   you can't imagine it.
L:   though, when you're  if you're older and you didn't grow up in 
R:  Right.
L:   the computer generation, like my 
R:  It is intimidating.
L:   my in laws.  I mean, they have a computer, but it's literally just sitting there, it's not hooked up to the internet, and I have no idea what they have it for. [LAUGH] You know, because I really think a big part of it is having internet service, so 
R:  Absolutely.
L:   that you can, you know, research and utilize all the, the resources it has to offer.
R:  And I think the, the seniors who get on to computers really love it.  I mean, again, there's  a lot of them sometimes can't get out, they're home bound, so 
L:  Right.
R:   this way it keeps them in touch with everything.  So 
L:  Right.
R:   you know.
L:  I think they just  I think it would be helpful if they had some sort of training course for them  
R:  Right.
L:   or whatever, because, I think like I said 
R:  And I think they're 
L:   it's intimidating.
R:  Heather, I think they're out there, but again it's getting to do it and all that stuff.  But they have it and they don't use it, that's a shame.  Well, at least when your kids go over, maybe they can.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  And I mean, my son, you know, he's, he's been on the computer since he was two probably doing 
R:  Isn't that wonderful.
L:   um, some Fisher Price program, so he was 
R:  Oh.
L:   clicking the mouse better than I was when he was 
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:   you know, two and a half, so.  Um, you know, 
R:  You do think that this is  that's the time to learn.  I think by the time you're eighteen it's probably all over. [LAUGH] Or at least most of it.  I mean, I do think kids pick it up so quickly, you know 
L:  Right.
R:   that kind of stuff.
L:  Well, it's a natural thing to him now, to just 
R:  Absolutely.
L:   be on there and 
R:  Absolutely.
L:   you know, he knows, you know, how to maneuver around where he needs to go.
R:  Well this  when I saw my three year old great nephew doing this, I mean, who can't read necessarily, you know, 
L:  Right.
R:   but everything was, he could find what they were prompting him to do, he could follow the instructions, and look at the pictures and all that, and I thought 
L:  Right.
R:   it's really amazing, that he  
L:  I mean, it shouldn't be used, it shouldn't be used to replace a parent 
R:  Uh huh.
L:   or you know, to replace reading from books and that type of thing 
R:  Right.
L:   but I definitely think it enhances  
R:  Yeah.
L:   and it allows them a different, um, method to, to learn things  
R:  And, and 
L:   like the math.  I mean, the math programs are so much fun that, you know, he didn't even realize he was learning, um, while he was playing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It wasn't, you know, an effort.  It was more of a fun thing.
R:  Oh, that's tremendous.  That's so  it's really exciting.
L:  And that's, that's the most important part of learning.
R:  Now, what  now, you're  the older child is kindergarten?
L:  Uh huh, and I have a daughter who's two and a half.
R:  She'll probably be a whiz at it as well.  Do they  are  is he in a pre is in kindergarten, do they have computers in the school itself?
L:  They do, they actually have one in their classroom, um, 
R:  Do they?
L:   and mostly the teachers use it, like with the students 
R:  Uh huh.
L:   the students aren't on it, you know, by themselves too often.  Um, and a lot of the students in my son's class are not familiar with, with computers as my son is, so 
R:  Oh, you can see the
