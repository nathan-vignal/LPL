R:  Hello.  This is Julie Branstedter[?]
L:  Hi.  Um, my name's David.
R:  Hey, David.
L:  Hey, how are you?
R:  Oh, good.  Have you ever done this before?
L:  Yeah.  I did it once.
R:  Okay.  Okay, I did it one time too, so [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have they sent you the check yet?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Ye-
L:  The -- they email and they say some kind of delay or something like that.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, 'cause I had emailed them asking about it and they told me about a week or so back that they would send it but still --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- haven't seen it [LAUGH].
L:  [MN].
R:  But, that's -- that's cool.  What was the, um -- the topic was, "Do you consider --"
L:  Yes.
R:  "-- any other country's a threat?"
L:  Yeah.  The topic is like, "In your mind, do you think any other country's a threat to the rest of us?"
R:  Hm.  In --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- the middle east, let's see.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I mean --
R:  I'm not --
L:  -- not now.
R:  -- real sure.  I mean, they are but it's hard for me to put my -- you know, to pinpoint which ones, you know, because I guess, I don't really know what's going on or who to trust, you know when you hear things.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I mean, uh, now the middle east.  I mean, you know, Iraq war is almost over.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think our biggest threat right now is North Korea since they have --
R:  Oh, yeah.  I agree.
L:  -- since they have like a lot of nukes.
R:  Yeah, and they don't seem too shy about, um [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, and like, um, they -- I mean, they -- they -- you know, they display them, you know.
R:  Yeah, I know.  I mean, like, blatantly.  It almost like -- it's, um, being antagonistic, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the kind of comments that they make.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I don't know.  Do you -- do you think that Iraq is a threat, even after the war I mean?
L:  Iraq?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I mean, like depend on how, you know, we set up their -- I mean, we allow their, um -- depend on how their government going to be set up, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I mean, if they -- if, I mean, they --
R:  'Cause that's kinda shaky to me, I think.  It's, um -- you know, everything's kinda still in the air.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And there's a whole lot of protesters over there about us even being there now -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and so that kinda seems a little bit strange but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what about Syria?
L:  Yeah, what --
R:  What do you-- what do you think about them?  Do you think they're a threat?
L:  S- s- Syria?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, you know what, to be honest, I haven't heard anything about Syria.  What -- what --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  -- happened -- what happened in Syria?
R:  Well, they were saying on the news like for the last week or so they had been saying that some of the, um, government officials in Iraq --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- had fled and the only place they could have gone was Syria and that, um, the US government knew of one person that Syria was harboring and they -- they, um, kind of, I mean not really threatened them, but they kind of said, you know, there would be -- I guess, threatened them -- there would be some type of pre- -- uh, repercussions for harboring them because they were considered war criminals and things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um -- and then one of them -- uh, Syria talked one, um, of them into giving himself up and it was, uh, a stepson, one of Saddam's stepsons.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, so it proved -- they were saying the whole time, "Well, there's no-one here.  We're not harboring anyone" but then they turn around and actually had talked someone into giving themselves up, which they did.  So, you know, it --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- kinda makes them look like, you know, big liars, you know [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I mean, if you weren't harboring them, then how could you have talked them into giving themselves up, you know.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But, I mean, we've kinda -- it's kinda backed off of them but I just wonder about 'em, you know.  Why would they -- if they're such supporters of the Iraqi people, why would they, well even harbor anyone in that regime, you know?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But --
L:  Well, I mean, you know, I -- ch- -- if the US government just, you know, just demand the, uh -- you know, don't -- don't take any, like, military action, just, you know, like -- like tell the, um -- the NATO, you know.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I think the best thing to do is just, like, confirm with the NATO --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that trying to prove that Iraq -- Iraqi have -- have mass destruction weapons --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then, um, just -- just, you know, t- -- so then try and convince NATO to support us.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Then once NATO support us, the pressure going to be much more on, um, Syria --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to give up whoever they are harboring.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know --
R:  'Cause --
L:  -- then that will put a lot more pressure on them.
R:  Yeah, and it would be better to come from another, um -- instead of it directly coming from the United States.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it seems like it would be better to have it coming from, uh,  the support --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, the supporters, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because we don't have a real good reputation right now internationally --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I don't think -- I think that what we did was right but I do think --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that they need to come up with some of these weapons.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know, 'cause it's not looking too good [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  Not finding them is not looking real great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  M- m- my cousin is over there right now and he's right on the front lines.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, uh, [MN] but I mean, you know, he's okay and everything.  I think, um, my aunt has probably heard from him by now, but, you know, when all -- all the stuff was going on you couldn't help but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- think about him a lot, you know.
L:  It -- it -- so, he's all right?  Did -- did he -- did he get into action or anything?
R:  Oh, yeah.  He was a special ops marine right on the front lines, so --
L:  Wow --
R:  -- he was [MN] --
L:  -- wow.
R:  -- when he was giving his aunt -- uh, his -- my aunt, his mother, information about, um, where he was, it was where he had been.  You know, sounds all -- you know, --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they were real secretive about all of that so --
L:  Yeah, they -- they -- they -- they -- they didn't want people to know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] wow.
R:  When he told -- he told them that they were moving in, uh, like within a week and, like, the very new day was the day they actually moved in, so --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- you know, they had to be secretive about it, but he definitely has been involved.  It'd be interesting to talk to him when he gets back.
L:  Yeah, wow.
R:  You know, and I wonder, you know, how long it's gonna take for some of them to come back.  I guess that's the thing with Iraq is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Yeah.  I think now they just like -- they keep the soldier out there to, like, keep, you know, keep the, um -- keep the government from getting back up again.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what though?  This is interesting to me and this is from woman's perspective --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, all of the, uh, the [MN] protests that are going on in Iraq right now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about, um, how they don't want to set up a democracy, they don't want to vote, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, they said, uh, they had all these men out there that -- I mean, a lot like thousands and thousands of men protesting that, um, the marines back out of Baghdad which is what they've done now but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- this was before that.  They were protesting then that they wanted to set up their own government and they didn't wanna just have a democracy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, which is strange.  They didn't want to vote but I guess, you know, they've -- they've never done that before so --
L:  Yeah, so I mean --
R:  -- you know.
L:  Anything new to them, they'll -- they just afraid.
R:  Yeah.  I think so, too.  But, you know, it was interesting to me that they aren't -- in all of those people that were protesting, there wasn't one woman protesting, and, um, what they were protesting was democracy and the right to vote --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, so it -- so it kinda seemed like to me that they didn't want their -- their culture as far as, uh, the freedom of women and all of that, to change very much, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because you didn't see any women and [inaudible] of freedom, you know [LAUGH] over there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, so I think it'll be better over there but I still don't think it's going to be, uh, equal freedom for everybody and it's -- it's seriously not going to be religious freedom, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The Shiites are the ones that are demonstrating now because they've been oppressed for so long and even the people are kind of against them now because it's been, you know, thirty years since they've even been able to -- to demonstrate, you know, so it's going to be hard for the two --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Muslim beliefs to even, I think, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- mold over there but ...
L:  Yeah, that's [NOISE] -- that's true.
R:  I agree with you about North Korea, though.  I think that out of everyone over there, I think they are our largest threat --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because of the type of weapons that they have --
L:  I mean, 'cause --.
R:  -- and they're admitting it.  You know, they're just [MN] they got 'em, you know.
L:  I mean, 'cause they're -- they're really capable of, like, you know --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- blowing up a whole country.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean -- [NOISE]
R:  That's really, really frightening and that's, you know -- the way it started was it was that, um, they had opened that plant just for electricity and now they've announced that they are going to, um, start, uh -- I don't know what the word is -- re- reusing the, um, the -- the -- the rods, the type of fuel for nuclear weapons --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, and that was, like, right before these discussions were supposed to start between --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- some of the countries.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it's kind of like, you know, even though we're gonna talk, we're still gonna do what we're gonna do and it just seems -- it is kind of frightening because you think about that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What can you do to protect yourself from a nuclear --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- weapon?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean --
R:  [SIGH].
L:  -- there's nothing.  I mean, dig a big hole and jump down there.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And just pray.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I know.  That's it [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  That, or be really, really nice to the [inaudible] which I think, you know -- I'm a supporter, you know, of our government whether it's Republican or Democrat, whatever, 'cause I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, we should -- we should still support our government but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- man, I don't see them being nice [LAUGH] about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because our President seems to be kind of, um, I don't know, hot headed [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I mean, [MN] I mean, we -- anything -- if anything, I mean, we have to have the, you know, the NATO support --
R:  Yeah, I think so, too.
L:  -- I mean, if we -- if we gonna  --
R:  Especially now.
L:  -- if we're going to take away the North Korea weapons --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, we need the NATO support 'cause, you know, I mean, they have something maybe we should try and go in there and do what we did for Iraq but, I mean --
R:  Oh, that's not -- I don't think that's gonna work in North Korea [LAUGH].  I mean, Iraq was a country -- I mean, they're not a poor country but they didn't have a lot of the capabilities --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- military wise that we have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so it was a fairly, I mean, easy war.  Easy being, you know, that it was a quick war, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I -- I think it would be totally different in North Korea.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
