L:  Hi.  My name is Charlotte.
R:  Hi. This is Mandy.
L:  Hi, Mandy.  What st- -- what state are you in?
R:  Ohio.
L:  Oh.  That's where my husband's from.  We were just talking about Ohio.  I'm from Florida.
R:  Oh. [NOISE]
L:  So, we're down here in the brush fire season.
R:  Ah.
L:  Well, so the topic is what other countries do we feel that is, or could be a threat to the United States?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, I would probably say that China and Hong Kong or China's the m- -- uh, North Korea would be the biggest threat.
R:  That's what I was going to say about North Korea --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because I've heard that they have nuclear weapons and we don't seem to be bugging them, knocking --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- down their doors to try to get, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- take away their weapons or anything.
L:  Yeah, well in China -- China's also involved in that, too.  They're also heav- -- are heavily armed and, uh --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- they do -- and I think they do a lot of supplying --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- of them all so ...
R:  It's pretty suspicious that they're -- they're not part of the help right now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well -- they're also -- they're -- I think they're a little afraid of offending them because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, I saw -- I was reading that they had -- they were supposed to meet with them and, um, just recently they -- they said there was a -- like a sentence that had been taken out of context which basically was sort of a threatening manner --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- which was a threat as to how they would disarm or how they would not disarm and they -- then they -- the United States was kind -- they kind of drew the line and asked them to step over it but then I saw on my Internet site that it said, "Well, it's not that bad.  As it was, it was really just a misunderstanding in terminology".
R:  Hm.
L:  But, um, I don't know.  I think the United States is a little bit nervous about them because they know that China's there too and I think they feel that if -- if, um, North Korea were to get, um, hinky[?] with us, 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I think, that they were afraid that China would follow, you know, and I don't -- and they've got a lot bigger army than we do --
R:  I think --
L:  -- that's for sure.
R:  -- we've suddenly got something against France it seems [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, well I -- um, well I was just watching the news about France today.  Something about Iraq is on right now about their -- their, um, um, opinion of the embargoes and how things should be lifted, not with Iraq but --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- um, I would say, I don't think France is any sort of a threat personally because I don't think they have the weapons -- weapons and, I think, from what I understand, their army is very small and look how far they are from us.  They can't exactly surprise us.
R:  Okay.
L:  But then again, you've got North Korea and China over there and they have -- they have, you know, uh, nuclear weapons that can make it over here to our coast.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're able to do it.
R:  I've seen that they're worrying a little bit about Russia.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Keep working on with them as far as the space program --
L:  Right, well --
R:  -- you know.
L:  -- yeah, well -- I mean, it's like the, um, Russia supplying the, um, the Syrian weapons and things like that --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and the Iraq weapons and, um -- I mean, I was -- I'm a kid of the -- I was born in the middle fifties so I'm a kid of the, um -- of the, um, the first -- when it was the China -- I mean, not China.  I'm sorry, the Cuba blockade and everything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they found the missiles and everything.  We were just rewatching that movie the other day, realizing how close that we had came.  I mean, I was only a child when that happened but we were -- they were very close to them and they were getting ready to launch against us there and, you know, I think the -- my opinion is that North Korea and China are sort of in cahoots with the Russians.  I mean, they're all communist countries and they just don't look at life the way we do.
R:  Ah, so the problem might be --
L:  What part of Ohio are you from?
R:  -- communism?  Um, southwest.  It's in between Cincinnati and Dayton.
L:  Oh, really.  What city?
R:  I used to live in Middletown but now I'm in Monroe.
L:  What's the name of it?
R:  Monroe.
L:  Monroe?  My husband's from Hamilton.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's, um, just, um, very -- just one city, uh, north of Hamilton.
L:  Yeah.  We -- well we were there visiting about -- I was there two years ago to visit for the first time.  First time I had been out there and, uh, so we drove to all the little towns around Hamilton.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  We were over in Oxford, and Fairfield and all those little ones that, like, circle all around each other.  It's a pretty nice place you've got up there.
R:  I went for a whole school year to, um, Miami University Oxford campus to finish my --
L:  We were there.
R:  -- finish --
L:  That's really cool.  In fact we -- in fact we, um, when we were in -- we went in Ox- we were in Oxford and it was snowing 'cause it was toward Christmas time and --
R:  That's nice [inaudible]
L:  -- he took me over to one of the shops, um, the Wildberry over there.
R:  Oh, they sell the incense.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  In fact, we found a place down here that we could actually get the incense down Florida.  We found two places in our city that import it from there.  So, they bring it all the way down here from the Wildberry.
R:  They make a lot of money.  I proof their bank deposits [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, really?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, we were in there and we brought a bunch of incense back because I really liked it and then when it was gone, we were like, "Well, that's the end of that".  We were kind of hoarding it and then --
R:  They must -- 
L:  -- we found -- and then we found one of the surf shops around here that had it and then we found another, um, alternative shop that's carrying it.
R:  They must either do mail order or Internet because they have a lot of, um, like checks there from out of state and --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- [inaudible] 'em out.  They must be --
L:  Do they have a website?
R:  I don't know.
L:  They must.  They probably do.
R:  Let's see --
L:  But the price just went up but we always keep the incense.  We go over and buy a big pack of it, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and we went -- my kids steal it from me but, you know, it's the best incense around.  Even here in Florida.  I'm here about -- I'm about an hour, not even an hour away from the space shuttle launch.  We live right on the ocean.
R:  Oh, lovely.
L:  Very hot here right now.
R:  Oh, yeah.  We're having a little bit of chilly weather.
L:  Oh, not us.  It's up in the high eighties today.
R:  We're having spring break right now from --
L:  Oh, are you really?
R:  -- school.  The kids are off so not really doing anything until they're out of school.
L:  Well, we took the kids -- we actually two of my -- my two teenagers over to Wet and Wild on Sunday for Easter and everybody got sunburnt except for me 'cause I was the only one that --
R:  [NOISE] Oops, I found the website.  Incense wholesale dot com.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They -- I figured they were a distributor or a wholesaler or something because they get a lot of, like -- it seems like whoever -- it seems like the cus- -- companies were buying a lot of incense from them to sell maybe in their own stores or --
L:  Hm.  I think that's what -- yeah.
R:  -- to distribute.
L:  Okay, like I said, we found the two places that have it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, but nowhere else have I seen it.
R:  Oh, so Wildberry, that's the brand.
L:  Yes, it's -- they --
R:  Oh.
L:  It's supposed to be hand dipped -- some -- some-- there or somewhere for them.  
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um, we like it a lot, but we were real surprised to see it down here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You're having a cold snap, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I wish we were
R:  Actually we had thunderstorms Easter Sunday night and then, um, dried up, so [LAUGH]
L:  Not us, we're broiling hot right now [LAUGH].  In -- in Florida, it's either hot or hotter [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  No, we've had -- we've -- we have the air conditioner on and the air conditioner is struggling to keep up.
R:  How's the humidity?
L:  Oh, it's not too bad right now.  It's about forty five percent which is really low for us.
R:  Hm.
L:  That's the only thing that saves us right now during -- this is supposed to be spring but we've -- we've had the air for two months pretty much.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  We had only about three weeks of anything resembling cold weather.
R:  Hm.
L:  We don't get that here but we were up -- when I was there it was snowing so it's really nice up your way.
R:  When?  This winter?
L:  No.  I wasn't there -- I was there a year ago and I saw snow.  First time I'd seen snow since I was a kid.  It doesn't snow here.
R:  We had the -- the most snow of any winter I've ever seen --
L:  Yeah?  Yeah, --
R:  -- this year.
L:   -- my mother-in-law still lives in Hamilton.
R:  Oh.
L:  And she's -- she's wanting to come.  She's sick of the snow and sick of the -- she's supposed to be coming down to spend a week down here.  I said, "Well, you're going to get a big difference in temperature because it is hot, hot, hot".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we are hot.  So, you have kids, I guess?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Any of your kids old enough to understand anything that's going on with all this?
R:  You know, I don't think they are.  My --
L:  Mine are.  Mine are real question- -- my fourteen year old especially is very disturbed about everything.
R:  Yeah.  Is that a boy or a girl?
L:  Girl.  She's real disturbed about it.
R:  She's close to the age as far as probably having people that she knows that could be [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- possibly drafted.
L:  Right, and she's -- you know, we've -- you know, we had one -- we had one that was killed that was, um, not too far from here.  One of the -- one of the soldiers that were lost, not too far from where we're at.  And we're right at Patrick Air Force Base, too.  The air force base is right -- is fifteen minutes away from my house.
R:  Yeah, my sister's, um, husband's step brother was killed just here recently.
L:  Hm.  That's too bad.
R:  Yeah, that's what we heard.
L:  Yeah, well -- we're -- like I said we're by the air force base and, um, we've -- we've seen a lot of changes just due to the security around here, you know.  I mean, we're right, um, like I said, near the beach on A one A which goes up through the beach areas, all the way to Florida and that -- that area was actually blocked off after the, uh, nine eleven thing for almost five months.
R:  Oh.
L:  Completely blocked where you could not go past the base and all the -- and the only way to get up to, say, up north to go to Coco Beach or anything, was to go way around it.
R:  [MN]
L:  And, um, we've noticed a lot of changes down here and the unemployment and everything has gone way up, thanks to this.  So, it worries us but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I would -- you know, I try to keep my kids out of worrying too much about, you know, a nuclear weapon coming and taking everything.  You know, I'm like, "Well, if it's going to happen, there's not a lot that we can do about this.  It's pretty much, um, decided somewhere out of our hands" you know, and I don't feel like we can go round living our life waiting for the axe to fall, you know.  It's just the way it is.
