L:  Hello, my name is Eleanor.
R:  Hey, Eleanor.  My name is Matt.  How are you?
L:  Hi, Matt.  I'm okay.
R:  Where are you calling from?
L:  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, right.  I'm in New York, New York.
L:  Are you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, goodness.  So, what do you think about that question?
R:  Um, I just had a quick question for you.  Have you gotta paid by these guys yet?  I -- I haven't --
L:  No.
R:  -- yet.  Um --
L:  Not a dime.
R:  Gotcha, and was this recommended to you by someone you trust, because I just wanna make sure it's not some weird scam where I get charged a huge phone bill or something?
L:  No, you know what, I've had one of these phone calls before but I did not get anything marked on the bill or anything.
R:  Yeah, how long was the -- was your --
L:  But I still haven't gotten paid though, no.
R:  How long ago was your first phone call?
L:  Mhm.  Months ago.  Maybe --
R:  Really?
L:  -- two or three months ago.
R:  Huh.  Okay --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's it.  No, I'm gonna call these folks and look into this just to make sure it's, uh, kosher, as they say.
L:  Yeah, I hear you.  I don't blame you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  No, we live in such an awful world now, you never know.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.
L:  God, you know.
R:  Um, anyway we can talk about this if you want.  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You wanna go -- you wanna go first.
L:  You know what?  I was thinking -- now the question was did we think there was another country that might endanger the United States or whatev- -- wasn't that the question?
R:  Yes.
L:  [COUGH] You know, the first country I thought about was that Syria.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, the one -- they supposed to be harboring these weapons and --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- harboring the people from, um, Iraq, you know.
R:  I actually think that -- I think they're a threat.  I don't think they're as big a threat as North Korea because I think that guy is totally nuts.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  Then that North Korea business.
R:  Yeah, it actually has nuclear weapons.  I think Syria saw that we could take Iraq out pretty quickly and they're certainly -- I don't think they have this -- I mean I don't know all the intelligence around it but I would -- from what I've watched on TV and read about, I can't imagine they have nearly the military capabilities that Iraq had --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- or the weapons or the infrastructure.
L:  But, you know what I always say to myself, I bet Saddam is there.
R:  He could be.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, I mean they definitely harbored those guys.  I don't know how -- how dangerous those guys are.  I think, um --
L:  But that's a smaller country though, isn't it, than Iraq?
R:  Yeah.  I think Saudi Arabia is dangerous because they've -- they've got a whole network of countries that f- -- you know,  of countries -- they've got a whole of network of people that funnel money to terrorist organizations --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that are very duplicitous with -- with the United States --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's kind of the -- sort of, uh, I was going to say --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the cultural center of Islam but that sort of sounds terrible to say that.  I don't know this is really about a religious war but I think --
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  -- it already is.
L:  -- it's -- it's -- I think it's a people thing.
R:  Yeah?
L:  You know, I -- I -- you know, they wanna like kinda put it on the religion but I don't think it really is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But what have you heard on the news lately about North Korea?
R:  Um ...
L:  What made you pick North Korea?
R:  Well, I've just been following it for -- for a few months.  I mean, obviously the story about them, you know, kicking out, uh or opening up the -- their new nuclear reactor, rebuilding it and the fuel rods and -- and, uh --
L:  Hm.  You know, one thing I haven't heard too much about that.
R:  Huh.
L:  Now, when did you hear this? When are they -- when did this happen?
R:  This has been in the news for a while.  That incident happened two or three months ago.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- where they, uh, there was some -- there was -- the atomic energy -- energy agency had -- had, uh -- had taped one of their buildings or locked it up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they -- they broke the seal and they've been, you know, building a nuclear reactor basically there --
L:  Oh, God.
R:  -- um, and -- and developing, you know, the weapons grade, uh, plutonium.  So, I think they're dangerous because that guy's really truly nuts and, you know --
L:  The -- the leader?  Who -- who's the leader of North Korea?
R:  Kim Chong-il.
L:  Mhm.  And he's kooky too, huh?
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I think, in a way, the Bush administration would kind of -- is less scared of them and hasn't been as belligerent because they are more of an old school traditional communist a- a- adversary which I think, you know, the Bush administration is more comfortable in dealing with it than -- more easily recognizable enemy that they can deal with and use the traditional means.  Whereas I think Iraq was a totally new kind of model and, of -- of an enemy.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  You know what?  I'm always worried like when I hear things about North Korea.  I work for this really small company --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they make, um, spent nuclear fuel boxes for power companies --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's like we're really struggling for business right now and they're, um, [COUGH] they're -- some of their customers are in South Korea.  It's wild.  You know, and Korea in a whole and North and South Korea, it's not really a big place.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, so it's like every time I hear about Korea, my ears kind of perk up because I -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Absolutely.  And, I think, and this may sound funny and -- and unpatriotic but I think with this administration, the United States is its own enemy as well.  I think they've done a horrible job of dip- -- of diplomacy despite, um, you know -- despite the French and the Germans really, uh --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  I agree.
R:  What's the word?
L:  I agree.
R:  Sort of betraying us at the UN and then with the whole Security Council resolution, but I think this administration is really cocky and unilateralist and, uh, really into, you know, big business and I think, you know, just -- just on --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the basic level of like PR and relations with the rest of the world.  It's just awful.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Big business.  There you go.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's like the, um, the gap between rich and poor is getting wider.  Pretty soon there's going to be no middle person, no middle class.  Just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- rich --
R:   Yeah.
L:   -- or poor --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.
R:  It's true.
L:  It's -- it's pretty bad.
R:  I also think China --
L:  It's pretty bad.
R:  -- I think China's going to be a long term threat as well.
L:  You think so?
R:  Yeah.  I mean, either they're going to collapse into democracy and that's going to be an issue.  They've got, you know, a billion and a half people there.  Um, and I just -- you know, there's a real conflict there.  You know, really --
L:  Wonder where this SARS came from?
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  There's something -- there's something to be scared of.
R:  -- remember that that was a biolab somewhere, that it was like a weapon, a bio weapon that got, uh, you know, a -- a biological weapon that got released by accident or maybe not by accident.
L:  You think so?
R:  I heard some [several inaudible words]
L:  And I wonder who --
R:  I think it's entirely possible.
L:  -- was responsible for that?  Now, it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- supposedly this SARS started in Asia somewhere.  Well, there's a million --
R:  Right.
L:  -- places in Asia.  Where -- where --
R:  Well, I think --
L:  -- you know?
R:  -- they said it started in southern China.  I mean, it could have been a Chinese --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you know, and -- and it's interesting because the Chinese government really was initially very reluctant to talk about -- to be honest about what was going on -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and to talk about the number of deaths.  I mean, they're always like that so that doesn't necessarily mean -- that's not necessarily evidence that -- that this was a bio weapon but, you know, I mean, I guess it's -- you know, it depends on -- we really don't know.  It's viable but we really don't know.
L:  Hm.  You know --
R:  But I put China on the list of dangerous countries with, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with Saudi Arabia and North Korea.
L:  Well, so far we've got China and North Korea and Syria.
R:  And Syria --
L:  You know it's like --
R:  -- and I would put Saudi Arabia on that list as well.
L:  I hear you.
R:  I don't know if you --
L:  Saudi Arabia also.  Do you know what?  The whole world is crazy now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's spooky.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Absolutely.
L:  It's downright spooky.  I don't know.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  I don't know.  It -- it's awful.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then there's Saddam but you know what?  I knew when they started this war that they would never find him.  I knew it.  I could fee- -- you know -- just like they didn't catch Bin Laden, you know.
R:  He may be dead.  He may be dead.
L:  You think so?
R:  Ah, he could be under --
L:  For some reason --
R:  -- a seventy foot bunker or something.
L:  -- my spider senses are saying no to that.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and then they want us to get out of that country already.  You know what,  if the United States picked up and left Iraq today, Saddam would be back tomorrow.  I just feel like it would happen that way.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Hey, sorry to break --
L:  It's spooky.
R:  -- the subject but you said your first call was a few months ago?
L:  Mhm.  Yes, it was.
R:  And there was nothing kooky in your phone bill, right?  You didn't have some weird thing on your phone bill?
L:  Not a blessed thing, no.
R:  Okay.  
L:  Phone bill was fine.
R:  And you said you never got a -- your ten dollar check for the -- for the call.
L:  No.  No.
R:  Gotcha.
L:  I thought -- now, I got an email at work that said you have to have two phone calls before you get money, that's what --
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  -- it said.  
R:  That makes sense.
L:  So, maybe that's the reason.
R:  Cool.
L:  Is this your first phone call?
R:  This is my second phone call.  My first one was yesterday but I'm glad to hear that your first call was a few months ago so that means it's probably -- this probably legitimate.  You know --
L:  Hopefully.
R:  -- if they were going to rip you off or charge you some phone thing or something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it would have happened already.
L:  So, they sent me an email and, you know what?  They asked me in the email did I still want to participate and they --
R:  Right.
L:  -- said in the email that they knew people hadn't got paid because you had to get two phone calls.  I wish --
R:  Gotcha.
L:  -- I still had the email.  I'd forward it to you.  I delete every blessed thing.
R:  Yeah, sure.  Good for you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What do you do for a living?
L:  You know, when I work -- I work for a company called US Tool and Dye.  They make spent nuclear fuel boxes for --
R:  Oh, you said --
L:  -- power companies.
R:  -- that.  You were talking about that.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Oh.
L:  I work in the accounting department --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- you know.  I'm -- I'm, like, their little timekeeper.  They have, like, three shifts of workers.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, worker that -- welders, machinists, laborers working on these boxes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I keep track of the time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, for payroll and for, um -- I don't know, they have, like -- they do their little reports on how well they're doing --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- on this job or that job, you know.  Things like that.  What do you do?
R:  I'm in event planning.  I'm a freelancer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I do like big, you know, they'd be like corporate conferences and sales training ...
