R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name is Carolyn.
R:  My name is Lawrence.
L:  Well, it's nice to meet you, Lawrence.
R:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] yeah, what's up?  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I was on the line with somebody else --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then I had to try to call them back.  But, anyway, we'll just talk about this.
L:  Okay.  So, do you think professional athletes deserve their high salaries?  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, to a certain extent, but not some of these guys, no, because you can't afford to take your kids to a game anymore.
L:  No, you're -- it's way too expensive anymore. [LIPSMACK] [MN]
R:  I mean, one guys makes, uh, what [MN] --
L:  Millions.
R:  Yeah.  Multiple millions over like, two years.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've forgot some of the contacts, that wasn't on my mind right now, but it's so high.  I mean, just for two years, you know, somebody can make fifty million, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just for two little years.  And then we can't send our kids to games.  Well, I don't have kids, but I know certain neighborhoods, you know, the- they might have turner fields -- I'm in Atlanta.
L:  Okay.  I'm in, um, Washington State.
R:  Okay.  We have Turner Field and the Braves and all those people come and th- the salaries are so high -- like a hotdog, you know?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, to go to -- to go to the game it's like forty bucks for a ticket and, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- five bucks for a hotdog and it's outrageous, all because these guys are getting way too much money.
R:  Yeah.  I think that, um [MN] I [SIGH] -- I don't know -- it's just too high and then they, you know -- when they get to talking about that stuff they actually go by the whole, uh, roster of -- of how much the roster call to run -- costs to run the team and when you look at some of the guys just playing, like, I guess triple A. or double A. or however they got to divide it, those guys they -- their, um, [LIPSMACK] annual payroll or whatever, however they do they the roster, right --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is like a fraction of --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- whatever these super guys get.  See what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, one of those guy's salary almost will cover maybe a half to three quarters of some of those other +folk's, um, roster and they -- they're playing the same game essentially.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I don't know.
L:  You know what really makes me angry, is the ones that are getting the big bucks and so they're role models for the kids, they're out, you know, doing drugs and getting in bar fights and -- instead of, like, you know, being role models, like the Portland Trailblazers?
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's been so much publicity on -- on them getting busted for dealing drugs and selling drugs and -- and, you know, doing 'em and --
R:  There's a lot of stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, they, you know --
L:  I think --
R:  I don't know.  I --
L:  -- a few years ago a couple of 'em were accused of rape and --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I mean, what kind of role model is that for my kids?
R:  Shooting a guard, I think one shot a guard, or one --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, set the house on fire.  You just name it.  Go down the line.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then one killed their wife I know, put her in the trunk or some- -- I don't even follow that stuff to be honest 'cause I get pissed off that they, um --
L:  It's just --
R:  You know, they -- th- --
L:  Yeah, it's disgusting.
R:  You know, they don't have to worry about the problems, like I'm -- I'm not -- I don't even work, I'm on social security now, you know?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And my income --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is like [MN] -- I mean, these guys never have to, um, count pennies or stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah, here's a --
R:  But they get blessed.
L:  You know, the professional baseball player that's getting, you know, fifty million dollars for two years and, you know -- and he's -- he's [NOISE] not a role model for children, it costs too much to go to games.  It's not right.  It's not right for, you know, us working families who are trying to raise -- raise our kids and provide 'em with role models.
R:  Mhm.  You take your kids to the thing?
L:  [MN] I can't afford to.  [LAUGH]
R:  How many you got?
L:  I got t- -- I got two boys and, um, I'm a stay at home mom.
R:  Oh, goodness!
L:  So ...
R:  And how lo- -- how old are the boys?
L:  Well, I've a -- a two and a half year old and a [NOISE] -- a two and a half month old.  [NOISE]
R:  See, but they're gonna -- they're gonna start buying those -- those things too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  In addition to, you know, what they get they get all these endorsements and stuff.  They shouldn't be so greedy.  You know what I'm saying?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like, you know, they're incorporating their names now and you see, you got two sons.  So, you gonna have to start stocking --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- away some money now.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  They're -- you know, they're gonna want Shakiel[?] O'Neill --
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- shoes and --
R:  Well, he got the cheaper stuff.  J- Jordan's in there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Iversons[?] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but by the time they get older that stuff is gonna be the same.  
L:  Yeah.  I'm gonna have to, you know, buy Jordan --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- booties and --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know --
R:  The leather shirts and --
L:  -- they'd, you know, kick back some of their millions that they're getting every year and ... [NOISE] and it's even more disgusting, they get all that money and then they go on strike.  What are they striking for?
R:  Now, I see -- I'm glad I don't follow baseball that close to where those strikes really affect me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like -- like -- like personally.
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  But some of that stuff is outrageous!
L:  Yeah.  There's nothing that, you know, can chap me faster than listening to them, "Oh, yeah, well, you know, I gotta a -- a two year contract for fifteen million but, you know, I'm gonna go on strike 'cause I'm not getting enough money".  Please!
R:  And then some of 'em want -- want the, um -- the strike -- but they k- don't want the strike -- but they can't not strike because they have to support the team.  So, either way you -- I don't know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.
L:  I don't know, I think --
R:  And then if it ain't -- then there is the concession people.  If it ain't the concession people it's the -- it's the owners, or it's somebody -- some kinda support system with the baseball folk.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  I mean, who can --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- afford five bucks for a hotdog?
R:  Shoot!  It's probably seven to ten dollars, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's just a hotdog.  Now, if you go -- that's for one person.  But you've got your daughter and you've got your son, your kids, uh, w- whoever, and your --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the -- the parents.
L:  Yeah.  And, you know, you've got to buy --
R:  You've gotta park.
L:  You've [several inaudible words].
R:  You've gotta get there.  Man!  You've to plan, you b- -- you've got to plan this like a military thing, you know?
L:  Yeah, for four --
R:  We've gonna enlist --
L:  -- for four people to go to a professional --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- game of any kind it's gonna cost ya two hundred bucks.
R:  That's right.  You need to have two hundred.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's right.  And then you gotta leave early, you gotta fight crowds and duh duh duh duh duh. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, I mean, those things are okay, but it's just the idea the prices are so high and it -- it -- it cuts out a certain segment of the population, you either -- you just won't be able to go, it's just that simple.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or you go once in twenty years.  [LIPSMACK]  Personally I don't --
L:  Absolutely[?].
R:  -- follow the stuff that close to even go.  I might watch golf, boxing, and stuff like that on TV, but as far as, you know ...
L:  Yeah.  But you could've even af- afford to go to a boxing or a golf game any more.
R:  Uh-huh.  No.  And most of the golf games that you want to see are already, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LAUGH] like a masters ticket, you need one of those --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- thirty years before the damn game.  You don't know whose playing in it when you buy the ticket actually.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, the passes.  I used to live in Augusta --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and there was, like, frenzies over that stuff.
L:  [NOISE] Wow!
R:  But that's too high too because they -- well, that's not as high as baseball and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- basketball and football.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  And football's not high as basketball and baseball.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But baseball is the highest.
L:  Oh, yeah, it's -- to go -- to go to a, um, Mariner's game up here it's, like, thirty five bucks for a ticket.
R:  Wow!
L:  Yeah.  And, you know, basketball, I mean, you can get some Blazer tickets now for, like, ten bucks, but that's -- that's 'cause, y- I mean, they're bad season, nobody's going to games.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I mean -- I mean, they're -- they're -- um, people going to games up here just aren't happening anymore, personally because the Blazers keep getting into so much trouble.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's really --
R:  That's the Trailblazers, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  The Portland Trailblazers?
L:  Yeah.  Actually I refer to 'em as the Portland Jail Blazers --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because they keep going to jail.
R:  [MN] Oh, my goodness!  So, they -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I haven't been following it to be honest.  So, they're, what, way down the thing now?
L:  Oh, yeah.  They're, uh -- I mean, there's some good players on --
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  -- for the Blazers but, I mean, they've got a bunch of -- a bunch of losers right now, that just can't get it together.
R:  I think them things go around in circles 'cause one time it's the Sixers and the next time it's the Lakers and they all [several inaudible words].
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And then the -- you know, we -- they all seem like dished up in the spotlight for a second and then it's like d- downhill from there and then it's uphill --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then it's downhill.
L:  And then they use all their millions to buy themselves out of trouble.
R:  Well, that's true.
L:  Yep.
R:  Some of the stuff -- I mean, one guy got caught a couple of years ago -- he was down here in Atlanta -- and they all come to Atlanta to show their behinds, for some reason!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know when the golf club thing was going on and all this, they all were stuck down here and they all do what they do.  But one guy claimed he got lost --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- in, a, uh, uh, um [LIPSMACK] -- well, this area known for drugs and prostitute, he claims his lights went out and he didn't know where he was at.  His lights went out on his car.  Now, you know, the car was like, big and --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah, a fifty thousand dollar car.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, my lights on my bicycle would go out quicker than his lights on his car.  [COUGH]  But anyway [LIPSMACK] that's, um -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think it is -- should be representative of -- of how the guy is for real, you know?  But I guess it -- it takes money to make money though.  [NOISE]
L:  Well, you know, they can make a lot more money if they quit giving one guy ten million dollars for a year of playing basketball.
R:  Yeah.  We won't see it though.
L:  Probably not.
R:  Sure.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But I think they should do some reforms.  Definitely need some reforms.
R:  Maybe they should though.  I mean, they [inaudible] having caps and stuff for shit.
