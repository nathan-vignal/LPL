R:  Hey, I'm Catlin.
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  I'm Bernie.  I'm Bernie.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  Where are you?
R:  San Antonio.
L:  Oh, I'm in Minnesota.
R:  [LAUGH] Well --
L:  Probably warmer where you are.
R:  Well, what -- tell me what?
L:  Probably warmer --
R:  [NOISE] What about it?
L:  Huh.
R:  Oh, hold on a second, I gotta a dog.  
L:  Yeah, I hear.
R:  Okay, now can you repeat that one more time for me?
L:  Yeah, I just said it's probably warmer where you are.
R:  Well, I -- it's -- yeah, probably. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, you've got the Spurs down there, huh?
R:  Ah, yeah.
L:  San Antonio Spurs.  Are you a sports fan?
R:  No.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] I am sort -- sort of.
R:  Well -- well, not basketball anyway.  We're not -- we don't think too kindly of the Spurs down there.
L:  Oh.  Well, our Timberwolves are just going into the playoffs.
R:  Really?
L:  But I don't have much hope for them because they're going to play like the best team from last year.  
R:  Hm.
L:  They'll be out after the first round.
R:  Well.
L:  It's pathetic. [LAUGH] But it's the best they've ever done so they're getting there.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I guess --
L:  Anyhow --
R:  What's our topic --
L:  Do you think --
R:  -- strikes by professional players?
L:  Yeah.  Do you think they should be allowed to strike?  Do you think their salaries are too high? [MN]
R:  Oh, yeah. 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well -- yeah, I definitely think they get paid too much.
L:  Mhm.  I agree with you.
R:  Uh, yeah -- and, you know, if they don't -- if they wanna strike, let 'em strike.  They usually have a reason for it but, [SIGH] you know, I don't -- I don't really pay a whole lot of attention to it because, like I said, they get too much, and if they're striking because they're no making enough money then they can bite me, for lack of a better word.
L:  Mm, yeah.  Because it doesn't really hurt us when they go out on strike.  Not like the teachers --
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  -- are striking or the airlines or the bus drivers.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, exactly.
L:  That's inconvenient --
R:  Yeah, but I --
L:  -- if there's no baseball.
R:  -- I mean and striking -- striking like in protest to the war, I think somebody did that or something but that I can kind of agree with it because then they have a logical reason for it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but striking just because, you know, they are not getting something -- I don't know, not enough money, not, you know, they [inaudible] stuff like that.
L:  Yeah, that's what they were referring to, I think, about striking for salary or benefits or something.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But these guys make millions before they're thirty.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  It's ridiculous and we're killing ourselves in our normal jobs getting --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- not enough.
R:  Exactly.  And since they don't -- most of 'em don't even win so the best way of getting paid to go out and -- and play for a while and not lose or not win just doesn't seem like -- like --
L:  Or they sprain an ankle and sit on the bench for two months and get paid their ridiculous salaries anyway.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Whereas we're down here making six bucks an hour.
L:  Yeah.  What's your job?
R:  I -- I actually work overnight at a Target.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.
R:  I work the, um, flow team.
L:  You're what?
R:  I work the flow team.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I'm -- I'm stocker.
L:  Okay, yeah, well, I come in in the morning and expect the things to be on the shelves so I think your job is more important than the baseball team.
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  It affects me more directly.
R:  Yeah, especially as I've gotta be up at three o'clock in the morning to go to work.
L:  Ugh.
R:  So, yeah --
L:  Yeah, [several inaudible words], I'm a teacher.  We get paid not enough.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, well -- yeah, I always hear about things about teachers and how they're not getting paid what they wanna get paid. [NOISE]
L:  Now, we're having these huge budget cuts in Minnesota and they're just cutting everything.  They said we can't even --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- go to conferences unless we pay our --
R:  That's ridiculous.
L:  Uh-huh.  You have to go to these things to get -- there are like these points you have to collect --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and when you want to renew your licence you have to have a certain number of them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you don't get 'em unless you go to conferences.  And --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we don't wanna have to pay to go to the conferences ourselves but I guess we'll have to if we wanna go.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think we should strike we should -- teachers should strike until baseball players pay for their conferences.
L:  Mm, you're right.  Well, we almost went on strike this year.  The contract -- the new contract's supposed to start in September and they dragged it out and dragged it out until it was like, I don't know, January, February before they finally settled.
R:  Hm.
L:  And we were getting really close to striking this time.
R:  Right, what -- are you a high school teacher?
L:  Well, I teach adults.
R:  Oh.
L:  English as a second language but it's through the state -- the -- the school district of the -- the town here.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And we have our own special little page in the contract where we get paid less than everybody else.
R:  Oh, that's ridiculous.
L:  Uh-huh.  We're working on that too but we're not getting anywhere.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Anyway --
R:  Well, good luck for that.
L:  Then there's the Yankees. [LAUGH] Then there's the Yankees.
R:  The what?  Oh.  Yeah.
L:  They have more money than any other team.
R:  They do, don't they?
L:  They can -- Mm?
R:  [NOISE] They do, don't they?
L:  Yeah, so they can afford to buy --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the better players and that's why they win all the time.
R:  [NOISE] Well --
L:  Been like that my whole life.  I hate the Yankees.
R:  [NOISE] Ha.
L:  They're killing our Twins this week.  It's embarrassing.
R:  [NOISE]  Baseball, yeah, I know about baseball.  I used to play baseball so I know about that but --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, football, basketball nothing but -- I don't know anything about.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, what -- what's  your baseball team there?
R:  Well, we have the Texas Rangers.
L:  Oh, is that in San Antonio?
R:  We used -- well, no, it's -- it's actually kind of based right out of, uh, the, uh, Dallas, Fort Worth area.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's where their -- that's where their stadium is, their field.  But --
L:  How far is that from San Antonio?
R:  About -- well, it's three hours from Austin, Austin is a hour from San Ant- -- it is about four hours.
L:  Oh, you're not going to run up to see a game too often.
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  That's terrible.
R:  No, because -- well, yeah, but [SIGH] I ususally -- I don't go to games and -- I think the last time I was -- I was there was ninety- ninety seven or ninety eight -- ninety seven. 
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  Didn't have to pay for it either, it was Fourth of July and I just kinda snuck in during the seventh inning.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And [NOISE] -- oh, shut up, Snoopy [NOISE].  Well --
L:  You have to get his opinion taken too.
R:  Mhm.  He wants to get attention.
L:  Oh, we could get in our car and drive fifteen minutes downtown to the stadium and be right there.  It's very close but when the Twins are doing badly the stadium's half empty.
R:  Really?
L:  It just doesn't -- people don't wanna go.  When they start winning, all of a sudden people start going.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We're fair weather -- and we have a dome so if it's raining or cold it's nice in there.
R:  Yeah, well, we have astrodome here for -- well, like the Houston Astras.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't even know if they're still a team anymore but -- um, you know, we have the astrodome here in Houston --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And there's the Alamo down here in San Antonio.  Um, the Spurs have -- have their own colosseum --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they have games all the time and everybody's -- as -- as a matter of fact I think they have one tomorrow, uh, that I've heard that --
L:  Yeah, they must be in the playoffs then too.
R:  I don't know.
L:  The playoffs are starting tomorrow.
R:  Are they?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, yeah -- yeah, 'cause -- yeah, I heard about that on the newspaper but [SIGH] let's see we had the Houston Oilers, which are gone.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And [MN] who else did we have?  Then we also have our hockey teams.  The -- the Ice Bats --
L:  Mhm.
R:  The Austin Ice Bats so ...
L:  What are they called?
R:  The Ice Bats. [SIGH]
L:  Ice Bats?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] I've never heard of them.
R:  We -- well -- yeah.
L:  That's funny.  Funny, hockey's the one --
R:  It's not what an Ice Bat is.
L:  Hockey's the one thing I don't follow whatsoever.
R:  Mhm.  I don't either.
L:  But I -- yeah.  But the others I sort of half pay attention to.
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  Unless they start winning, then I pay attention more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But probably need to --
R:  I really pay more attention to alternative sports though.
L:  Like what?
R:  Like -- well, I'm a -- I'm an inline speed skater so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I would pay more attention to the speed skating but it's -- you know, it's not really professional in terms of you've got regular Texas teams that -- like I used to compete with one and I would fall[?] it out but I can't really do it anymore, that is kinda depressing 'cause I don't skate anymore so --
L:  Oh, that's too bad.
R:  Yeah, but we didn't get paid.  I mean I think I made -- I made fifty dollars one time in a competition.  I came in second place --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- the fastest woman in the world and I got fifty dollars out of it and that to go to my -- towards my entry fee.
L:  Oh.
R:  Because I had to pay to be in the competition, two hundred dollars, plus the cost of my uniform so ...
L:  Well, there goes that fifty dollars quick.
R:  Exactly, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's not a professional sport but, uh --
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  Do they have speed skating in the Olympics yet?  Inline speed skating?  I don't think so.
R:  You know what I think -- I think they do.  I think, um, 'cause, you know, they have -- they speed ice skating.
L:  Yeah, that's in the winter, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  But that's a lot harder than it is on ice but I think they were talking about putting in inline speed skating also. [SIGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, as a matter of fact --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I heard a rumor that the Olympics -- the next -- like two thousand twelve or something like that were gonna be in San Antonio.
L:  Really?  Hey.
R:  That's what I heard.  But, you know, I haven't -- I heard about it from my family in Houston, I have no idea 'cause I haven't heard anything about it here.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, you know, I've only lived in San Antonio for a couple of months now so ...
L:  Oh, really?  Okay.
R:  Mhm, I'm from Austin.
L:  I was, uh -- uh-huh.  I've never been -- I've never been to Texas at all.
R:  Well, I've been --
L:  Except to change planes once in Dallas or something.
R:  Oh, I have been to Minnesota and that was only to change planes.
L:  What?
R:  I've been to Minnesota only to change planes, I had a six hour layover there.
L:  Yeah, right.  So, that doesn't count 'cause the inside of every airport looks the same. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, well --
L:  But I had cousins who used to live in San Antonio.
R:  Really?
L:  And they said it was really hot.  And they put a pool into their backyard.  Then he got transferred back to California and they left real happily 'cause they didn't -- it was way too hot for them.
R:  Not good [SIGH].
L:  Now, they live near San Diego and love it. [LAUGH]
R:  I have -- I have friends in San Diego too.  It's -- it's about seventy two right now.
L:  It's about fifty here.
R:  But it's -- yeah, well, it's raining and drizzly so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's -- it's really dark outside.
L:  Yeah, it's awful.  But last Monday it was like ninety here.
R:  Really?
L:  And then it got cold again.  It was nuts.
R:  I -- I think it's been ninety like, maybe, three times this year.
