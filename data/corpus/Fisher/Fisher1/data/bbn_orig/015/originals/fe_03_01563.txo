R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Who is this?
L:  This is Herb.
R:  Herb?
L:  Yeah.
R:  This is [LAUGH] James Spreley[?].  W- wh- you -- where you at?
L:  Um, I'm, like, at Center City.
R:  Where?
L:  Center City.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Columbia, South Carolina.
L:  Oh, wow!  Okay.  So, I didn't know they did it all over the place.  I -- I'm in the [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.  I -- I talked to a lady from, uh, Denver the other day.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Philadelphia.  Yeah, I thought everybody was in Philadelphia.
R:  No.  You might in fact -- you -- you know, she was in Denver, um, I -- but this is the second call.  How many calls have you done?
L:  This is only my second also.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, anyway, uh, what do you think about athletes and their -- and their strikes and -- and demanding more wages?
L:  Well, um, I guess I -- I've felt that, uh, when you're making that type of money, I guess, I'm -- I'm always gonna feel like, um, you know, just shut up and -- and play I guess.  I don't -- I don't know, uh [SIGH] -- I guess they look at it differently.  But I guess from my point of view I've always looked at it as, you know, when -- when you're making millions of dollars I don't understand wh- what really beef you -- you really can have, you know what I mean, like you're being mistreated?  So, I guess the recent strikes have kinda turned me off sometimes to -- to some of the athletes and some of the sports.
R:  Yeah.  Me too because I feel like that they're not representing, uh, you know, their -- they're not representing the -- the main -- th- -- because Amer- -- uh, baseball and all that is a- all American, you know what I mean?
L:  Right, right.
R:  They're supposed to be representing the sport and they're supposed to be playing it for the love of the game.  I mean, that's the way I always was, uh, told that -- you know, even if they didn't get paid, uh, you know, that much.  But, man, they get millions and millions of dollars.  I agree with you.
L:  Right.
R:  You -- you put it really well.
L:  So, I think that, um, [LIPSMACK] and she said also -- the recording said, "Do you think that they deserve it?"  I guess, I -- I don't know if anyone deserves that amount of money, but because [MN] the market kinda demands it, I guess they're entitled to it because their owners, I mean, they're making so much more than the athletes are -- are making if they're paying that type of salary.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I guess if you --
R:  Well, I -- yeah.  And I -- I -- I agree with you.  But, I -- you know, it would be nice though if -- if they would roll the prices back.  I mean, I've -- I've heard -- I mean, I haven't went to a game in a long time, but my son he bought some tickets and -- and -- and he told me to get the seats he wanted, um -- you know, I don't know if he was -- you know, bought 'em -- um, i- b- but he told me he had to pay a couple of hundred dollars for 'em.
L:  Yeah, I bet.  Yeah, it's ridiculous.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You said you were in South Carolina?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, do you -- you guess -- you know, what's the closest, like, professional teams near you?
R:  Well, I'm not really, uh, into sports that much but, you know, I -- like, my son is.  So, he would --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- yeah.  But you -- you know, um, a lot of times, uh, you know, I- I'll listen to and read, um, articles about, you know, different peop- -- um, different, you know, people and their salary demands and stuff?
L:  Right, right.
R:  And, um, just not only of sports, but just like, uh, people that are in corporations and stuff and -- and they got people working on them, making, like, you know, maybe twenty thousand a year and yet they -- they -- the executives make four or five million dollars, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I just think there should be some kinda way to weigh things to where no one ha- -- because there's overkill.  I mean, once you've got fifty or sixty million dollars, I mean, you know, that's -- it just -- I don't know -- there's -- there's got to be a line somewhere.
L:  Right, right.  'Cause I -- I still don't really understand, like, uh [SIGH] I guess there's a demand for st- sports and everybody -- you know, a lot of people do like sports and wanna follow them.  [SIGH]  But there's a lot of people who don't go to games, you know, who just sit home and watch it on TV.
R:  Right.  That's true.
L:  So, I guess a lot of the money is generated from the TV stations, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Selling the ads and stuff.
L:  Right.  Selling ad time, which I always -- you know, it's like you're selling the ad time, but no one's actually buying a product, like, they're -- you know, if I love sports and I only -- I never go to games and I just sit home and watch it on TV, I guess they're thinking that they're -- they're going to advertise to me and I'm going to spend my money that way, that the advertisers feel like they're gonna get me to buy something but, uh, I don't even know how effective that is.  I know that I watch the games, but when the commercials are on I leave and go do other things.  So ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I do too, try to time it.  But only, um -- or even if you're recording a lot of times you try to pau- --
L:  Right.
R:  -- pause it when the commercials --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so you don't have to replace your tape.
L:  And -- and fast forward it and everything, right.
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  Because i- i- it only seems like a handful of, uh, sports where the peop- -- the athletes actually strike often, which is always, you know, I guess puzzling to me, like, uh, [SIGH] your professional teams will strike.  But then I guess the individuals -- I guess they don't -- I -- I don't know what the difference is, why they don't have a reason to strike, like your tennis players or golfers or, you know, people in sports like that they, uh -- they just keep playing.
R:  Yeah, I know.  And you know what else too?  When they -- when, um, baseball goes on strike a lot of people just swear that they're -- they're just gonna quit going.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, they're really -- in the long run they're gonna hurt themself because in the long run people -- like the, uh, [COUGH] audience is gonna decline to such a point that they won't even be able to ask for no salary increases.  They -- they need to be -- they might have to be asked to give a salary cut because, uh, you know, they don't have the fans there no more because people don't wanna think it's just about a dollar.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I mean, I -- they don't want to think that -- that you're just going there for a money grubbing people that watch them play, because you got troubles in your own life and you go there for, uh, uh, you know, like ... and then plus --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- charging, like, uh, the m- -- for the food and stuff.  When you go there you're gonna pay for a high price ticket and then you've got to pay outrageous money for the food and everything.
L:  Right.  Yeah, exactly, which is out of -- overpriced also.  Um, you know, I saw something about [SIGH] -- I think I was reading in the paper the other day something about the WMBA, um, their players union having talks whether or not they were gonna continue playing, and I thought to myself "Wow, they -- they seem to be struggling".  The women's basketball [inaudible] is struggling to even draw fans and just being introduced and already talking about [SIGH] um, what they would need to extend their contract so they wouldn't have a work stoppage.  And I thought they had to be kidding me, I was, like, I know --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- that a sport like -- a sport like that would never survive if they went [LAUGH] on strike.
R:  Yeah, I know.  I- if -- if -- I guess its just human nature to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- always want more 'cause I -- I remember one time -- and this is -- I thought this was shocking -- there was a -- a show on millionaires.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And this guy was talking about when he -- he said all he wanted to do was earn that first million and he was gonna be satisfied, but he said once he got the first million --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then he had to have the second, and then when he got the second he wanted the third.  He said you don't never stop wanting more money.
L:  Right.
R:  He said it just becomes an obsession.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I see --
R:  You know?
L:  -- I see how they are and, uh, I guess they -- once the athletes get [SIGH] to a certain, um, level or get accustomed to certain things and then they -- they feel like they always have to have that.  Or sometimes their argument would be that, uh, "Well, we deserve this money because, um, we only can do this for a certain amount of time.  So, this money has to last us a lifetime".
R:  Yeah, well, if they only got two hundred million they should be able to [LAUGH] make that last!
L:  [LAUGH] Right, yeah.  That's what I thought too, you know?
R:  And then another thing too, they probably look at the pie 'cause you were talking about how the, uh, owners get so much more --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- they probably look over at the pie and they say, "Well, even though we're getting, you know, fifty million dollars a game" or something like that, or -- or two million a game or whatever, they're saying well, but -- you know, they're looking that that's only a little --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- small portion of the pie, you know, that's probably that they're thinking --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's not fair?  But what they should do if the pie is that big, they should just give the customer some relief as far as the ticket prices and stuff. 
L:  Right.
R:  That's the --
L:  Yeah, 'cause owners created this -- this monster with the athletes, I mean, you know, and they continue just to pay more and more just to compete for -- for these players.  You know, if someone could have any- -- you know, at some point put their foot down and said, "Look, [MN] I'm not paying, you know, more than this", you know, for a certain player.  I mean, it happens in regular, um, work industries where, you know, they won't pay more than a certain -- you know, a top dollar for a certain person, like, you know, everyday work person you'll go to a job and they'll say, "Well, look, this is what we pay, you know, either take it or leave it".  [SIGH]  But, uh, I guess in -- for sports that the owners feel like "Oh, well, if I don't get this particular person I won't -- and people aren't going to follow me or follow my team the way, uh, they would with other teams".
R:  Right.  And probably another thing too is that other players, you know, that, you know, they see another player getting so much and they think that they're -- "Hey, I'm just as good as him.  How come he gets --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- you know, two hundred thousand more than me?"
L:  Right.
R:  There's probably a lot of -- a lot of human nature in there --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in -- in that.
L:  Yeah.  Like you said earlier though, you'd think that after a certain point you could just play because you love it.  I mean, I know Michael Jordan for years played well below market value because he felt like, "Well, millions of dollars is enough and then I can just play 'cause I love the sport".
R:  Yeah.  I heard something about him in the news the other day.  It -- it said something about he w- -- he thought -- he -- he, uh, he got back into basketball, right?
L:  Yeah.  He just playing again the last couple of years and now he --
R:  Yeah.  They said he's retiring [LAUGH] again.
L:  Yeah.  He's gonna stop again, yeah.
R:  But -- yeah.  But this time it's gonna be for good.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  You would think so.  But, yeah, 'cause even this --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- second -- either the first or second -- he donated his whole salary, his whole year's salary, to charity.
R:  Yeah.  I think he's a good guy.  I really -- I admire him.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, that's one -- you know, he's always, uh, seemed like a good natured person.  You never, you know -- never hear nothing.  Um, I know he had a gambling problem.
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  You know, that he had a problem with that.  But, you know, I guess that happen- -- um, happens to everybody.  I mean, if I had a lot of money I [LAUGH] -- I probably would be a gambler --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- I'd be down a lot --
L:  -- or something, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I guess you know, you wanna -- yeah, I don't know -- use -- when you've got all that free time you -- you try to get excitement any way you can.
L:  Right, right.  Yeah, I guess he was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- compete- competed, uh, a lot and then needed something else to fill that void when he wasn't playing.
R:  Yeah.  You -- do you remember Will Smith I think, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that played on [inaudible].  I -- I -- I heard --
