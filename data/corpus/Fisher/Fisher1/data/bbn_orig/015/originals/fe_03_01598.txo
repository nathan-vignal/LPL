R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, I'm Sherry.
R:  Hi, I'm John.  How do you do?
L:  Hi John.
R:  Okay, topic of conversation is, uh, airport security, uh, what -- making us any safer? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think, to an extent.  I don't think it's, um, doing a whole lot.  I -- it's -- as far as I'm concerned it's one of those things where, uh, I don't think they're -- they're -- anybody's looking to repeat what happened on nine eleven.
L:  [MN] Oh, no.  I don't think that either, but I think also, um, even the guy that got caught not too long ago, I think he had like scissors or a -- or a knife or something, and, um, it was like a big thing, like, how did he get past security with that?  I don't think everybody's doing their job. I think some people taking it serious and I think some of 'em are just -- it's not gonna happen again kinda, you know, attitude.  Like --
R:  Well --
L:  -- they -- they don't really expect that a -- there's -- there's so much, um, concern more so like keeping their job more than they are about really checking anybody.  I think you get checked more for -- if you have germs or something like that 'cause that, um, last time I went to the airport and all I was doing was, um, picking up my daughter, they asked me to take my shoes off, they examined my shoes and they wanted to wipe my feet and, you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I thought that was a little crazy but I don't know.
R:  Well, I don't know.  I think -- I think if somebody is that determined and isn't afraid to die, I don't think eventually you're gonna be able to stop 'em.
L:  Right, right.  And I -- the other thing is, um, now they got the, um, captains, um, I mean the, um, pilots, um, training to carry guns, so I'm thinking like, "How you gonna be able to fly that plane and shoot, and -- and --" 
R:  We-  --
L:  "-- and also make sure that, um, that you're not aiming at the wrong thing that'll actually put the plane in danger?"
R:  Well, ho- honestly, I mean, the pilots carrying guns they can be trained and they can be armed with the proper weaponry that's not gonna cause -- you know that's not gonna cause more harm than good --
L:  Mhm [NOISE].
R:  -- but, where they had to start with --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- security on the airplane is actually --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the barrier between the pilots and the cabin.  I mean, if -- if the pilots have time to, you know, unsheathe a weapon that's fine, but they have to make sure that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that door in between the, uh, cabin and the -- where the pilots sit is, you know strong enough to keep people from being able to, you know, break it down with relative ease.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, um, I kn- -- I was watching someone in training that they was showing on, um, I think it was Good Morning America and it was really strange because, um [NOISE] the guy look- -- didn't look like they was in the best of health theirselves, you know.
R:  What the pilot?
L:  Yeah, they were like -- like, really like overweight and, um, like they was really struggling with the whole thing [NOISE] with the whole training session and everything.
R:  Well, I can -- I mean, I didn't see it.  I -- I -- I'm really wary of anything I see on -- you know, on pretty much anything on TV.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I mean they're -- what you have to understand in that situation is they're trying to make a story, whether there's a story there or not, so I kinda take it with a grain of salt.  I think it's just a kinda one link in the chain as far as training the, uh, pilots --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they're -- and you know it's like, heck how many cops do you see that are, you know, overweight and out of shape, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Come on, I mean --
L:  Yeah, you're right, you're right.
R:  Yeah, they -- if -- if -- they've pretty much, um, you know, lowered the standards for so many different, uh, occupations, you know, in the name of, you know, equality or whatever, you know, instead of just, you know, I don't care, you know, what gender you are, what, uh, you know, what race, what anything, but, you know, just have a set standard whoever makes it, makes it, you know.  I mean, they could do the same thing for pilots.  I -- I think pilots should have a certain standard of health for crying out loud.  You know, the last thing you need is a guy having a heart attack up in the air [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.  Right, right.
R:  But, um, as far as, uh, you know airport security, especially what they do at the airport, some of it is so ridiculous that, you know, I mean any time that they set a certain standard and it's all black and white and there's no, you know, um, common sense involved, you know it's -- I don't know, I just have a problem with that.  I think overall the way they've done, you know -- and the thing is I'm -- I tend to be pretty conservative, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I wouldn't want to call myself a Republican, but I am pretty conservative --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I think the normal what you consider conservatives are Republicans with their, um, homeland security are just going crazy as far as, you know, trying to, you know, take away so many of our -- what we would normally consider our rights in the name of keeping us secure.  I'm sorry, but I guess I'd rather risk a little bit more security and not, uh, have people snooping around so much.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, because I notice, um, the other policy that came here in Phili[?] was that, um, when they check your luggage and everything, they want everything like in a clear bag.  It's like a random check that they do and they want everything like where they can see it so then -- so they had like all these stipulations you had to do was as far as how you baggage up your luggage and everything which was a little bit more complicated because now you -- you're having to put everything like in individual bags 'cause you don't want anybody just touching your personal items, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, it just seemed like you had to get to the airport early anyway, but now it was like you had to get there extra early just in order to, um, go through the whole checking process just to board the plane.  So, it was like after everything that happened nine eleven it seems like we're all being held responsible for what happened then because, I guess, security wasn't tight enough or whatever.
R:  Yeah, I -- you know, I don't know as -- as far as -- you know and -- and y- no you tell me how -- you know you're being in Phili, I'm in -- I'm like forty miles east of Milwaukee in the middle of Wisconsin --
L:  Okay.
R:  I don't feel -- I don't feel very threatened by anything.  I'm not really in a very large, important metropolitan area --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But I -- I probably have a much different way of looking at it.  I mean, I'm not, uh, I'm not worried [LAUGH], you know.  There are a lot bet- better targets than, you know, we are around here, so I have -- I guess I have a little bit different way of looking at it plus, um, I don't tend to, uh -- I don't watch the network news for one thing.
L:  Okay [LAUGH].
R:  I try and get my news from a lot of different sources, whether it be cable news or, you know -- on one hand I'll watch Fox News which is really right wing and then I'll listen to a public radio which is really on the left.  I think I get kind of my own balance that way [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and, um, y- I think --
L:  I try to watch a little bit of everything but it's like -- like if you watch CNN -- and CNN, and oh, goodness, then it's like the stories that they come up with, you know, and you're like "Gosh", you know and it's almost -- if you really listen to it, it'll shake you, you know, like if you go for just that and then you hear somebody else opinion on the radio about some of the things that's going on as far as the terroristic, you know, threats and everything, you know, and then you have people that are not so scared but they're just like, "If it's meant to be it'll happen", you know, just like everybody was buying gas masks and everything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- 'cause they just knew that -- that there was gonna be like this big, um, uh, germ warfare thing going on, and then --
R:  Well, the biggest joke in the world is when they were telling everybody to buy duck tape and disprin[?] you know, I mean [LAUGH] --
L:  Right, yeah, and a -- and a -- and a home depot around here ran out of duck tape and the plastic to cover your window --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and it was so crazy 'cause I was sitting here saying to myself, "But if it's meant for you to go, you're gonna go", but, um, I'm not really worried so much about the terroristic threat as I'm worried about the people in my own neighborhood [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I mean, that's true too and you know and that -- I -- if -- you know, you're worried -- like you said, you're worried about your safety in your own neighborhood and, you know, I do I work in downtown Milwaukee a lot --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And I work actually -- I'm an electrical contractor and I get into the public schools a lot and the conditions there can be just terrible.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know and it's like -- to me that's a much larger threat to, you know, everything to everybody, you know, from -- on a day to day basis than some, you know, unseen terrorist maybe --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, doing something.
L:  Right, and I work for, um, the State and I'm a clerk and when they had the anthrax thing that was going on, um, they made us all put on clerk, I mean, put on -- all the clerks put on gloves if they was gonna open up mail and just like about a month ago somebody found some white powder and -- which was, uh, we all believe was just an accident, like some senior citizen trying to fill out an application might've dropped their medicine in it and through the mail process it got crushed and everybody was like, "It was anthrax, it was anthrax", you know, and everybody's all scared and nervous and like, "I wanna go home.  I wanna go to the hospital.  I wanna get checked", you know, and then the management was like, "It's nothing to worry about.  We'll just go get it tested and if anything comes back then we'll deal with it from there". [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which I thought was a little crazy, but I was saying to myself, "Well, all the things that people are so concerned about, how do you just take such a +mediocre ... "
