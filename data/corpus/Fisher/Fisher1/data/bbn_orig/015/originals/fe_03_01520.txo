L:  Hi.
R:  My name is --
L:  Hi, I'm Elisha. 
R:  I'm Betsy. [PAUSE] Hello? 
L:  Hello.
R:  Oh. 
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I'm like, mm, there's silence [LAUGH]. 
L:  [LAUGH] Okay, so we are talking about this right? 
R:  Okay. 
L:  Um, um, well, let's see, um, mhm.
R:  Do we just talk about it or -- 
L:  Yeah, I guess so. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  I guess my opinion of everything is, like, that they're -- they have talent and everything but there's so many other people who -- who are more positive role models, like -- like, there's so many teachers out there and -- 
R:  Yeah, that's true. 
L:  -- you know, that -- that don't get hardly any money in comparison to the -- 
R:  That's true. 
L:  -- billions of dollars and, you know, they get all these other, like, sponsorships through, um, you know, like Gatorade and things like that.  It's just -- there's -- there's -- they -- they make so much money, you know.
R:  Yeah, I mean sometimes I feel, like, they don't put up with as much.  I mean, I'm sure they have the pressure and stuff, you know. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But as much as like teachers and, I don't know, maybe other people like nurses and stuff, doctors, put up with as much, I don't know. 
L:  Yeah, exactly.  And I know in London there's or -- in -- in Europe I've read a lot that both actors and, um, sports figures and things like that, they don't make nearly the same amount as -- as professors do.  Professors make more.
R:  Oh. 
L:  More money, and it's just -- I don't know, I think that that -- that that makes a lot more sense because of the way that Americans, um, like the education is and how so many people don't even know where, you know, where all fifty states are -- 
R:  Right, right. 
L:  -- and things like that but, you know, but yet kids can rattle off, like, you know, their teams and, you know, they -- they know so much more of things like that than they do of -- 
R:  Actual, like, stuff in America and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Educational stuff like. 
L:  Exactly.  So I think that sometimes our focus is a little off base with that.
R:  It's really sad because things like the war and stuff, people don't even know about it. 
L:  I know.
R:  And, like, I heard this one on TV that, um, somebody, the reason they are against the war, like, they were protesting, you know. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And their -- some -- some newscast person asked them, um, who the lead- -- the leader or dictator of Iraq was and they didn't even know. 
L:  Oh, gees.
R:  Yeah, and that's really sad. 
L:  Yeah, I remember seeing something where they were asking questions, like, the who the President of Iraq would be, um -- oh, I can't remember what the second question was but, like, they were both -- they were both Saddam Hussein.  He, like, had both positions and there are a lot of people that didn't know that. 
R:  Yeah, it's sad.  
L:  I know.  
R:  Like, even if people are out there, like fighting for him, they should at least have knowledge of what his -- 
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Because, you know, you figure it's -- it's on the news enough that -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- that they would -- that they would know that stuff.
R:  Right. 
L:  You know, I mean, I can understand not wanting to get too involved, you know, as a kid or something, you know.
R:  But these are adults that --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- that don't even know about it. 
L:  Yeah, there's --  it's kind of em- embarrassing.  There was like this thing on -- on Jay Leno that I saw a couple of times where he asked people questions.  It's -- it's similar to like, um ... I can't remember what the show is but it's, um, it's like a game show.   
R:  Mhm. 
L:  It's on really late at night and it has, like, this guy going out asking questions.
R:  Oh, it's, um, Mark Street or something like that?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  I think that's what it is.
L:  Something like that and -- and it's, um, you know, the people like answer and most of the times they answer, like, the wrong question, the question wrong and stuff.
R:  Yeah, yeah, like, what, what. [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah, it's like, you know, that -- kind of like really [inaudible], like, lack of education and -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- and stuff like that, you know.  I don't know, but, I mean, maybe if I were an athlete I would have a completely -- 
R:  [MN] Different opinion. 
L:  -- different opinion, you know, because it would be like, I guess I would be -- the same with Hollywood, you know, you kind of go according to what your peers are making.
R:  Right. 
L:  Just like you do in, like, the regular business world, you know, like if -- I'm in -- I'm in marketing and, you know, I want to make what everybody else in marketing is making.
R:  Right, right. 
L:  You know, so there's that too but -- 
R:  I'm an athlete, I mean, I play tennis.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, I don't think that -- I would -- I would want to be paid well if I was, like, purely a professional, right, I'd want to be paid a lot but it wouldn't make too much sense to me where people that are -- like, I don't think that tennis is my life, you know, and I don't think I -- I work as hard as some people do to play, you know. 
L:  Ahah. 
R:  Like, I don't think that I would deserve getting paid a lot more than people that are, like, putting themselves into something that's, you know -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's true. 
R:  I don't know. But that's just my opinion. 
L:  I mean, it would definitely be nice.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, if somebody gave me the money I wouldn't be like, oh no, I'm sorry I can't take --
R:  No, I don't need it. [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] But it's like to actually go out on strike and stuff, I don't know.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  It's, like, so many people that, you know, don't have anything and then you are, like, -- it -- it just seems a little greedy.
R:  Right, when -- yeah, I've thought that a lot. 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know, I haven't heard of anything recently though.
R:  I haven't either. 
L:  So, I don't know, maybe it's just, like, --
R:  I guess people just -- 
L:  -- a couple of months -- a few months ago or something.
R:  People don't really ca- -- can't really do anything about it.  Sometimes they just kind of go along with it I guess. 
L:  Yeah, and it's, like, who -- who exactly are paying them.  How are they getting paid except by --
R:  I don't know. 
L:  You know, it's almost [inaudible], like, a corporation, doesn't it.
R:  It's not the government, is it? 
L:  I don't know.  Maybe it's just all sponsors.
R:  That would be really sad if the government was paying for it because I personally think the government can pay for more --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- things that actually [LAUGH] need the money. 
L:  Exactly, I know.  And, like, in -- in -- even especially right now because, like, you know, we are already so messed up with our  -- with our being in debt and then the war is just going to put on --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so much more, you know, it's, like, the last thing that we need is to -- 
R:  Spend money on something that's more of entertainment. 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, America is so entertainment based --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it really is.  Then there's like -- like, another thing I noticed in --  in Europe in comparison is, um, most of their museums are free.
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  To get into, yeah.  And like I live in -- I do live in Chicago, I live in Chicago.
R:  Ahah.  I live in Oklahoma. 
L:  Oh, Oklahoma, okay.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I live in Chicago and -- and it's like, um, -- it could be like ten to fifteen dollars to get into a museum and then it costs like eons of money to park and a whole bunch --
R:  Right.
L:  -- of money to eat there and everything else.
R:  It's just, like, all about the money, it's nothing about the experience -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- on what it could be like or anything. 
L:  Yeah, exactly.  So, like, you -- you know, you kind of lose base with -- lose touch with -- like, you go in there to see the artwork and -- and see it as art.  Everything turns into, like, another entertainment and, like, you know, -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  So bizarre.  So have you -- have you done this survey before? 
R:  No, I haven't. 
L:  No, me neither.  Maybe 'cause -- maybe that's why we're paired up this time.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I think they pair up by, um, -- I think by --  by age group and stuff.  It's really interes-.  How did you find out about it? 
R:  Actually I was on line talking to one of my friends and he was just, like, oh, you know, you want to make some money and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I was just, like, mm, sure, why not and that's always something that -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I could use. 
L:  I know, it's great.  My friend's sister, I guess, is part of the whole, um, project, the research project.
R:  Oh.
L:  And that's how I found out about it.  So, it seems to be pretty interesting.  I don't really know exactly like -- I heard that we talk for like ten minutes.  I'm not too sure what --  what goes on. 
R:  Do -- do they like monitor it or anything like --
L:  Yeah, I think so. Oh, oh, my cat's gonna -- I have -- I have --  I have these two cats and they both like to jump up on things that aren't sturdy like my stereo.  
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] He's gonna knock the speaker down.  Come here, [MN] okay.  Yeah, I -- well, I don't know what else to talk about further --
R:  I don't either.  
L:  We are both like -- I don't know how far to get into it except, you know, -- 
R:  Yeah, like, --
L:  Kind of, like, go a little off subject.
R:  [LAUGH] It's kind of easy too. 
L:  [LAUGH] I know, that's probably what they are monitoring.  Let's see how much they really start talking. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And then they start to analyze why they are talking about what they are talking about.
R:  Right.  If it was a different subject, I don't know, maybe I could talk more about it but -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  'Cause I -- well for me I don't -- I'm not into any specific sports or anything.
R:  I'm not really into watching sports. 
L:  Yeah, me neither.
R:  I'm more into playing --
