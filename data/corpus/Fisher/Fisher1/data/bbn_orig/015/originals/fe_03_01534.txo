L:  Hi, my name is Anne Reid.
R:  I'm Susan.  Um, what was the topic? 
L:  Um, it's, um, I'm sorry, I can't talk.  It's about professional athletes and whether or not they should be paid the high salaries they are.
R:  What was that? 
L:  It's about, um, professional athletes and should they be paid the high salaries that they are.
R:  Oh, okay, I got it now.
L:  Okay.  Um, personally, I think some of them are paid too much.  Um, I think it depends on the sport and their, ah, individual abilities but I think for the most part a lot of them are paid just ... it's just too much, it's way too much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How do you feel about it? 
R:  I guess, I -- I'm not really into sports that much.  I know they make a lot of money but, ah, yeah, I think it would be too much money.
L:  Yeah, I -- when you start talking about millions of dollars, um, you know, it's just -- I don't understand it.  Some of them are very charitable though, um, like, ah, what was it, Warren -- no, Warrick Dunne[?] I think his name is, um, and he is very -- anyway there's, um, a young man that, um, was a Tampa Bay Buccaneer and I live in Tampa and, um, -- he, um, every year will,  um, build a certain number of houses or help to build them and get, ah, women who are single parents into a new home and get them started, help them with the initial set up costs and get in the furniture and everything they need and give them fresh groceries and get them started and then they take it from there, you know.  So, you know, he does charitable acts but there's still a lot of them that are very money hungry, they're very me, me, me, me, you know.
R:  Yeah.  I can see 'em making it if they were going to be charitable but there's not that many that are. 
L:  Right, right.  Yeah, they just take the money and, you know, live fat and happy, [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  What state do you live in?
L:  Ah, Florida.  I'm in Tampa Florida.
R:  I'm in Colorado.
L:  Oh, are you really?
R:  Yeah, the home of John Ellway. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, um, I do like him.  I think he's a good guy, I think he's very nice.
R:  Yeah, he does a lot of stuff for charities but I don't think he does anything that big but he probably does and I just hadn't heard about it.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, some of them are good guys and they do really help people and then, you know, others just, you know, take the money and buy expensive homes and expensive cars and just kind of blow it all, you know, so ... 
R:  Then they retire and they end up with nothing. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  And here's the other thing, when they have such huge salaries then it drives the price of a ticket up so if you are interested in sports it makes it impossible for a lot of, um, um, people who don't have huge incomes.  Ah, it makes it impossible for them to buy a ticket and go see a sporting event.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I don't know if you have ever looked at the price of tickets.
R:  Well, that's probably why I'm not a sports fan, [LAUGH] I couldn't afford to be.
L:  There you go, you know.  I mean when it costs, you know, forty or fifty dollars for a ticket, you know, who can go?  So -- and I'm sorry, I don't want to monopolize this conversation.
R:  Well, I'm glad you are [LAUGH] because I'm not too much into sport.  You know, I always -- I like to watch the Superbowl, especially if Colorado is in there, you know. [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And go to Superbowl parties but -- and I watch the game, I understand the game and everything but, you know, unless I have, you know, something special I'm not really into it. [MN]
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I like -- I like football games, I like hockey, um, I don't know.  I'm not into baseball too much, I'm just -- really don't care that much for it, it doesn't excite me.  Of course there are other things like gymnastics and ice skating, like, you know.
R:  I like football the best because my -- my Dad was a foot- a high school football player and my brothers were high school -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- football players and my Dad was a coach -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  So I really understand the game.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I guess you would. [LAUGH] You had a -- you had enough of them running around that you could get an idea and a clue as to what was going on. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, well my Dad wanted a -- a -- another boy and he always teased me that I had football legs and stuff. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Did you tell him "Not on this earth"? 
R:  What?
L:  Did you tell him "Not on this earth", that you -- that you didn't want to play football? 
R:  Well, I tried.  Well -- 
L:  Did you?
R:  Just -- just, ah, out in the front yard I -- I could pitch a good ball and -- and I could kick a ball and ... but when it come to games, you know, I didn't want to get out there with the boys and get tackled.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, there is actually girls who are, um, in the game with the guys nowadays.  There's not too many of them but there are some girls that do that.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I don't like falling down. [LAUGH]
L:  All I can say is, ah, I was playing with my uncle when I was about thirteen and he tackled me and hurt me pretty bad and I decided that was enough of that and so we started playing some more and the next time he got the ball I tackled him and I knocked him to the ground and he was not real happy [LAUGH] so --
R:  Well when I -- when I was about five, ah, my brothers were out in the big yard playing -- ah, my brothers and cousins were playing football and I got kind of too close and, ah, they tackled right beside me and one of their foots come up and hit me in the mouth -- 
L:  Oh, ouch.
R:  -- and, ah, my mouth was bleeding, my teeth were loose, they took me to the dentist and they said that they will tighten back up. [LAUGH] 
L:  That must have hurt. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Especially if it was, like, a size thirteen, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know something else I think though too, is that the professional players, they really for their own sake should go out and get a college degree and -- and not -- and actually pay attention to what they're learning in college, then if they can't play ball any longer, um, then they can take their college degree and go on and -- and have a career.  It's just like super models, you know, if you do something with yourself and that you have a career after your good looks fade or after your body turns to flab, you know, I mean, you know, then you've got something to fall back on.  But, you know, a lot of times they spend the money and then, you know, when they can no longer play the games then they don't have anything they can do, you know. Yeah.
R:  Yeah, but -- but there's a lot of dumb, ah, you know, good football players that can make a good football player but can't make the grade.
L:  Mm, you mean they aren't capable of learning when they are in school?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know, I think there are some of 'em that are just lazy. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, of course then again too I guess some of the guys may deserve some of what they are making, maybe not all of it, but, you know, when you're playing, like, football and they get blown in the eaves and all sorts of injuries that may plague them later on, you know, so, you know, I guess they deserve some of it but I don't believe they deserve everything.
