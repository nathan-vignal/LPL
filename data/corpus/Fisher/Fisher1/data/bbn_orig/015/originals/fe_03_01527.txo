L:  Hi. 
R:  How are you doing, Justin Cater, what's your name? 
L:  I'm sorry, I'm Matt, how are you? 
R:  Matt. Doin' good.
L:  Yeah, okay, um, go ahead [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] I got -- I don't know what you think.  Ah -- I think it's kind of getting out of hand every now and then when they do strike though.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I guess.  Um, I mean the -- they get paid a lot of money, you know, and, um, a lot of it's wasted I think.  I think there should be like some kind of way of, um, getting them to, um, donate like twenty per cent of their salary over a million dollars to charity or something like that. You know, automatically --
R:  Yeah, only some -- some of 'em are okay, you know, but some of 'em the salaries are just kind of, you know, ridiculously high.  I mean, Aroff[?] of course, that's the number one guy right now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like twenty five million, that's just ridiculously out there, you know.
L:  But, I mean, well then who should get the money, 'cause I mean, you know, they -- they do make a lot of money for these teams.
R:  Ah, that -- that's true also.  But you don't want the owner to be keeping all the money for just --  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- being the owner.
L:  Who should get the money? 
R:  Well, I mean, I guess a lot of the -- a lot of -- I guess football has got the united way, they do a lot of donations to that.
L:  I think it should be mandatory, they should, like, -- like, take out a certain percentage.
R:  Like in the contracts or something? 
L:  Yeah, like, -- like every baseball player that plays should have a percentage of their income automatically given to charity and -- and -- 
R:  Like a cap or something. [LAUGH] That's incre- --
L:  I mean like an extra tax like a -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- they could call it, like, a, I don't know, a charity tax, you know.
R:  Sure, yeah.
L:  That would work.  But, I mean, ah, the -- I guess we're supposed to talk about striking.  I guess they have the right to strike, you know, for whatever reason.
R:  Yeah, it's just that with striking in any other manner, it's just, you know, the government is not supposed to -- I mean, I just think about, like, working and striking and stuff like that.  Yeah, I mean, they have the right to strike -- 
L:  Yeah.   
R:  -- for what they believe.
L:  I -- I -- I think -- I mean obviously it's not, like, their first option.  I don't think anybody who plays any kind of sport -- like, if you are making that much money playing a sport, chances are you love playing and you don't want to strike unless you really have to so if they really feel like they have to strike then they should be allowed to.
R:  I mean, they -- they do enjoying playing, it's the love of the game for them and stuff.
L:  Oh, yeah, you have to.
R:  That's your life, you know. [LAUGH] 
L:  Absolutely, if you -- if you are, like, at that level and you have been playing since you were, like, a little boy and it's all you eat breathe and think about, you know.  But let me ask you a qu- question.  Do they pay for these things, for these survey things? 
R:  They are supposed to pay us ten bucks for a call.
L:  Have you -- have you like gotten paid yet for it? 
R:  This is only my second day though.  I've -- I -- I received, ah, two calls the other day, not yesterday, the day before.  
L:  Ah.
R:  And actually they called me three times and one of the calls I missed, I didn't get to my phone on time. 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And this is my third one so they are supposed to pay ten dollars a call.
L:  Yeah, 'cause I just didn't know how they do that.  That's really good.  But, um, yeah --
R:  How did you hear about this?
L:  Getting back to the topic I guess.  
R:  Oh, that's all right.
L:  I guess we both agree, um, -- 
R:  Yeah, I mean they have the right to strike, you know.  It's their prerogative.  I mean, why don't the players get together,  you know, when they are like one big entity just striking all together, that's even ... they just kind of -- there has to be some kind of a deal made in between -- between the owners and the players.
L:  [NOISE] So what do you think about, um, setting up some kind of a charity tax like on top of whatever they pay in tax? 
R:  A charity tax, just depending on what kind of -- what level, like, they should have brackets of what -- just like -- just like a tax bracket, like if they make this much then they have to donate this per cent.
L:  What percentage they make over five million dollars a year or, I mean, then, like, -- like any owner that makes like every -- for every dollar -- like, say, like, for one million to two million it's one per cent and then from two million to three million it's two per cent and then three million to four million four per cent.
R:  Yeah, it just goes up the more you make.
L:  Yeah, like some kind of a graduating thing and then that money can be used for college athletes who get injured while working towards the pros, you know, guaranteeing that they have the ability to go back to school, you know.  Because you have got a lot of people out there who want to become sports stars and they get injured or for whatever reason they don't make it and then they find themselves not having gotten into college education and then they are screwed and they turn to a life of crime or gambling or -- you know what I'm saying? 
R:  Yeah [inaudible].
L:  Sure, they could have some kind of a safety net, you know.
R:  Oh, no, I'm just thinking I go to the University of Texas and [several inaudible words] Roy Williams who took out an insurance policy just like the guy from the Hurricanes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  An insurance policy, like, if they get injured before -- like, what if they can't play or something, they get whatever their policy is.  I don't know, I -- I just heard that for the first time this past year so -- 
L:  From what I understand though, that's only for, um, -- 
R:  College students.
L:  -- for what do you call it.  Um, [LIPSMACK] um, the -- the professional athletes that have already made it.  They're the ones who, um, who have the insurance but, like, college athletes, I remember there is like a bunch of times you had these guys who were like, you know, about to go -- turn pro and then they get injured like right before, like in the last season of college and they're screwed, I mean they're completely screwed.  So there's got to be some way of protecting them 'cause by protecting them and allowing them to play hard and entertain people, you know, that's a good thing for sports in general but if they get injured then, you know, they're screwed.  You know -- you know what I'm trying to say, there has got to be a [inaudible] 
R:  Yeah, I hear what you're saying.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then not only are they going to continue what we're doing, I mean, you know, 'cause sport's, like, a big part of I would say almost everyone's life, you know, in the US. I don't know how or what you think about that.
L:  No, it's a part of America, man, sports is -- 
R:  Everyone, you know, watches something or another.
L:  Yeah, the whole competitive nature thing, you know. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Being -- being competitive and working hard and, you know, competing against other people, um, yeah.  So, ah, where did you say you were from, what's your area? 
R:  [several inaudible words] Texas.
L:  Oh, you're in Texas, oh, well sports is way bigger in Texas than it is -- 
R:  Where are you?
L:  Well, I'm from New York city.  I mean, New York city, it's like, I remember when I was in high school, they made fun of you for playing football.  You know, out in Texas, like, if you play football you are -- you are, like, the man, you know.
R:  They made fun of you for playing football? 
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  They made fun of people -- like people that played football? 
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you were considered like an idiot pretty much.
R:  You know, that's all you are good for if you played [several inaudible words].
L:  It's not even that, it's like you just -- there was n- -- you were not cool, [LAUGH] you know.  The cool kids in New York city were doing drugs, at least when I was growing up.  The cool kids were doing drugs, the cool kids had the nice cars, the cool kids, um, -- 
R:  Rich [inaudible] basically.
L:  I'm sorry -- yeah, a bit like, you know, the -- 
R:  I mean, the rich -- 
L:  I'm sorry? 
R:  Excuse me. [MN] I mean, if you've got a nice car, that's what I'm saying.
L:  Yeah, I mean money, if you had money you were cool.  If you didn't have money and you played sports you weren't cool.  I mean, they -- I guess its hard to believe that being a football player is not something that you, you know, you bragged about, when I was in school at least.  Even in college, um, -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- being on a football team wasn't -- wasn't a cool thing.  Um, it was more like, you know, the kind of car you had, you know, how smart you were, things like that.  But it's different in Texas, it's really different and you -- 
R:  Here -- here if you play football [several inaudible words], you know what I mean.  Just, like, I might have like a basketball player in one of my cl- I actually have [several inaudible words] in one of my classes, like, you know, he doesn't -- he gets -- he gets a respect like beyond me, respect as in just -- I don't know, everyone goes up to him, you know, sucks up to him and stuff, just play any kind of sport to -- I mean -- 
L:  Really, playing sports they look up to him? 
R:  Look, I mean I don't believe in that exactly but it's just -- 
L:  That's the reality though right? [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, it is what the reality is.  Just because I --
L:  [NOISE] Well, you know, I mean, I -- I'm not against that.  I mean -- 'cause, I mean, to play a sport, I mean to play it really well to the level at which you really need to play to get respect and stuff, you have to really put a lot of effort into it, it's not easy.  You know, I mean, you have this natural talent but you've still got to work at it.  It's still a lot of hard work.
R:  I could do [several inaudible words] non stop, on top of academic so they've got to keep it up there.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] [PAUSE] So, um, um, where in Texas do you go to school? 
R:  Oh, it's -- it's in Austin.
L:  Austin, Texas?
R:  Yeah, Austin, Texas.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Long horns.
L:  Long horns, that's right.  Well, that's a great place down there.  Do people in Texas support Bush?
R:  Ah, yeah, mostly.
L:  Really?
R:  The -- the -- the people with money support Bush, just, you know --
L:  And -- and -- and they are, like, for, like, killing people in other countries and stuff like that? 
R:  I don't know about --
