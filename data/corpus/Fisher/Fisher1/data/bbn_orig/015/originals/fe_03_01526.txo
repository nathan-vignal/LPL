R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Linda.
L:  Hi, my name's Christina, nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you.  Where are you, Christina?
L:  I'm in North Carolina, how about you?
R:  Ah, I hea- hear a little accent. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, actually I'm originally from Canada but, okay --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- I've got a small biv[?] accent, especially when I get mad, [NOISE] my husband says so --
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] well I just detect it because I'm so jealous of where you are.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm stuck in Rochester, New York.  Now --
L:  Oh.
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, I got this topic yesterday --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Did -- have you done this before?
L:  Uh, I've done it, yes.  Uh, yesterday as a matter of fact I did, uh, uh, terrorists and nine eleven and how that's affected --
R:  Ah!
L:  [NOISE] -- everyone so --
R:  So, what do you think of today's topic?
L:  Gosh, well, I think, they just get paid so darn much anyway.
R:  I -- yes.
L:  That honestly, I think, it's just greed, when you start --
R:  I -- exactly.
L:  When you get paid in millions of dollars, I mean most people never get a chance to earn that much [NOISE] in a lifetime let alone, you know --
R:  What they're making.
L:  -- per game or per season.
R:  Right, and --
L:  [NOISE] And then -- then to go on strike!
R:  I -- I -- it's like you wanna say what nerve.
L:  Yeah!
R:  There's so many bad --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- things happening in this world wh- wh- what nerve do you have to take up people's time and, [LAUGH] you know, complain about what you're getting paid and --
L:  How much greed?
R:  I -- that's what it is they can't, uh, you know, they get used to these big fancy lifestyles and the cost of living goes up and, "Oops, now I need more money".  How could they even spend all that money in one lifetime?
L:  Well, you'd wonder but a lot of them go broke.
R:  Yeah, I know, isn't that incredible?
L:  It is --
R:  Even -- even af-
L:  -- it boggles the mind. [NOISE]
R:  -- even after they stop playing and they're still doing commercials and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- selling sneakers and clothes they still end up going broke.
L:  [NOISE] Right, right.  I mean it's just -- it just, you know, or even afterwards they don't even bother to invest it [NOISE] they blow it on parties and -- and
R:  Yeah, and -- and -- and they're into drugs, whether they, you know, admit or not.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean when you're got that kind of money --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you've got easy access to that kind of thing.
L:  Sure.
R:  It's just -- it's just ridiculous.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] The whole thing.  You're right, it's greed, it's selfishness, it's just -- I'd like to know what would happen if -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- everybody said, "Well, oh, you're on strike, too bad, now you don't have a job anymore".
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I'd love to see that happen.
L:  [NOISE] Oh yes, most definitely.  I mean that's just -- it's just -- it's the way our society works and I understand that but it -- it just -- it really makes me sick that so many people do that, you know, I mean, how much is enough.  When -- when is it enough and to go on strike.  You're earning millions of dollars.  Some people can't even make house payments, some people are homeless.
R:  Some people have no food. 
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH]  I know it just really upsets me that they have the nerve to act like that.
L:  Yes, yes. [NOISE]
R:  They're making more money than probably fifty people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I know put together and they're acting like, you know, they deserve so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- much more.
L:  Right, right. [NOISE]
R:  Oh --
L:  No --
R:  -- I just think it's terrible.
L:  I -- I think it's sick quite honestly.  I really do.
R:  I'd -- I'd love to see them say, "Okay, now you don't have a job all you guys that went on strike".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'd just love --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know -- [LAUGH]
L:  I'm sorry about my kids in the background --
R:  You got a little one?
L:  -- by the way. [NOISE] I'm sorry about that.
R:  It's all right.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  Believe me, I'm used to it.  My daughter's grown up but I have nieces and nephews and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- believe me I'm used to it.
L:  Right, [LAUGH] so you understand, okay.  As long as you understand.
R:  Oh, yeah, I do.
L:  But they, uh -- no, I just don't think, I mean it -- it just seems like [NOISE] it's more about the money now than the game and it used to be even -- especially with baseball.  Baseball was always, you know, an American dream, an American pastime and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and people would go ahead and do it for the love of the game.
R:  But now it's for the money and if there's no money, you know, if it's not good enough money then --
L:  Well, it's even to a point where I've seen like stories about, like, athletes will go ahead and they won't sign autographs and stuff because people are putting it on Ebay and -- and making money off of it and it -- it's just become -- even on the fans with kids and stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just become to a point where, you know, the athletes -- athletes don't even trust, you know, the kids not to go ahead --
R:  And go sell something and --
L:  Yeah.  And that's -- that's really -- that -- that's just so sad, you know.
R:  Well, if, uh, if the fans didn't support them with their ridiculous salaries they wouldn't be able to go on strike and then they wouldn't have to worry about anybody selling their stuff and, you know, I mean it all just goes back to greed, you're right.
L:  It's cyclical.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just -- it just gets to be one big mess and, I mean, I personally -- you know, I mean I've been to professional [NOISE] games, I have no real interest in them.
L:  Right.
R:  They're getting paid to play.  How -- you know, what a rough life.  I hear-
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I know, I know.  It's -- it's, uh, it's -- it's just -- it's amazing I just -- I just, uh, I don't think there's any debate I think that by -- [NOISE] Michael Jordan might've -- might have deserved how much he had [NOISE] spent -- uh, was paid because he drew in the crowds and he made [NOISE] so much money for the Bowl.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And he basically was the whole basketball team, I mean --
L:  Yes. [NOISE] Yes.
R:  Yeah, I mean, but when you're playing football or baseball there isn't one person that's doing it all.
L:  [NOISE] Right, right.  Oh, oh, excuse me one second?  Hey, hey, we do not hit each other, we do not hit each other.  [NOISE] I think they're in training to be Mike Tyson when they grow up or something, I don't know. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh [LAUGH] --
R:  The- -- from the sound of their voices I'd say -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're about three or four?
L:  Um, ah ye- -- one's almost three, the other is four, yes.  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, it's about the same age as my niece and nephew and they will not leave each other alone.
L:  We were hoping to have 'em that close together so they'd be, uh, friends.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Anyway, I guess, I don't know that they really want us discussing all this stuff, I suppose we're supposed to stick to athlete's being --
R:  I know.
L:  -- on strike but I just don't see that there's a debate there.  With the amount of homelessness and with the amount of people and just the -- fine, they have talent, they bring in people but the salary caps keep getting higher and higher and they get --
R:  Yeah, it -- it's enough --
L:  -- keeping paid more and more and how much is enough?
R:  Right.
L:  When --
R:  And not -- there should be feeling there where they can't abuse their, uh, uh, ability to draw on any money thing.
L:  Yeah -- [NOISE] I mean --
R:  I'm sure there's someone --
L:  -- they're so full -- full of themselves --
R:  Right.
L:  -- thinking that they're worth all this money and, "Oh, we'll go on strike 'cause you're not paying us this much money" and they live in their big mansions and they have the parties and they have all these groupies hanging around --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just wanting to be with a sports star and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, look at Magic Johnson.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  I mean [SIGH] --
R:  He pretty much had his own harem there, didn't he?  When he was in his big heyday or whatever. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, yes.  Yeah, and Magic Johnson ended up with, um, AIDS.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, what do you think happens when you play around like that, you know, it's like --
L:  Yeah, when you're -- when you're --
R:  -- hard to feel sorry for 'em.
L:  -- when you're dating -- when you're dating five or six hundreds girls and dating --
R:  Yeah, and that's --
L:  -- is being a nice word for it.
R:  -- exactly it.  That's -- that's it, it's the -- it's in the hundreds.  What do you think is gonna happen?
L:  Right, [NOISE] exactly.
R:  Yeah --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and -- and, of course, I can't feel sorry for him, you know, I mean, they take risks that they're ready and they're into these big high risk things and, well, it's gonna happen.
L:  Right, exactly, yes.  I totally agree with you.
R:  I'd really like to see them, like you said before, either tell 'em, "Oh, you don't wanna play, too bad then, we'll replace you" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  --'cause I'm sure there's a million people who would love to take their place.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Or I'd like to say -- to -- to have them say, "This is how much you make for the position you play and no one's ever getting any more money than this".
L:  Sure, I mean they get --
R:  You know, and --
L:  -- they get so much money, like Michael Jordan, in endorsement deals and stuff.
R:  Oh, yeah, and how -- all the stuff they get free, you know, the -- and they continue forever afterwards selling things with their names on 'em.  We're talking about a complete lifetime of income. 
L:  Right.
R:  And it's never enough money.  It's really sad.
L:  Wow, yeah.
R:  I --
L:  I agree, I totally I -- I can't fight you on any of those points [LAUGH] I think we're both in total agreement here.
R:  It's just the same --
L:  Although my husband, he never signed up for this but he was like, "Let me on the phone, I'll say a few things about this".
R:  I was wondering if, when I heard the topic again today, if I was gonna end up with a guy and he was going to argue with me about it.
L:  No, but these people they just -- they get so much stuff and they -- they -- they [NOISE] really -- they work so hard for it and --
R:  Oh, that's such -- oh, if only I had such a tough job, you know.
L:  I know, I know, I know.  
R:  Oh, please.
L:  You know, mothers should be paid.  As --
R:  Yeah, that's right, 'cause that's a real job.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  
R:  I only --
L:  Moms should be paid in the millions of dollars for the job they do.
R:  Well, exactly.
L:  And then -- and then have athletes -- athletes earn like thirty, forty thousand dollars [LAUGH].
R:  Well, gee, that sounds like a lot of money to me, I mean -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know [LAUGH] uh --
L:  Well, I don't think there's much of a debate on this phone line about any of this.
R:  I don't think so either.  We had the same problem with it yesterday, it's like we were both in agreement and this is ridiculous.
L:  Well, at least yesterday we could actually talk about --
R:  Uh, yeah, I'm glad to hear --
L:  -- it said, "Ways that affected you since nine one one" so we, you know, we talked the ways, you know, the gentleman travelled and everything and how that's affected him visiting his dad and --
R:  Yeah.  That was a much --
L:  -- that kind of stuff.  But this is like, okay, well I think they're paid too much and they shouldn't go on strike because they're lucky they get what they get and [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] And how much more can you say that's it exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Well, I'm glad to hear they've got other better topics going around anyway.
L:  Well, maybe next time it'll be, uh, uh, a better topic.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How did you, um, how did you find out about this -- this --
R:  Um, I get an email newsletter from a guy in North Dakota who, um, lets people know about surveys and sales and things, coupons and --
L:  Oh, I do couponing big time.
R:  -- online coupons and that -- how did you find out?
L:  Um, well, um, I do mystery shopping and --
R:  Oh, I did that for a long time, they just --
L:  Well, there's this ...
