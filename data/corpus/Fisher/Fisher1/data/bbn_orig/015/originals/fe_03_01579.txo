L:  Hello, my name is Dee.
R:  Say again, please?
L:  Dee.
R:  Dee?
L:  Yes.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Hi, Dee.  My name, um, is Peggy.  I'm from Philadelphia.
L:  [inaudible] [PAUSE] Yes.
R:  And, um, uh, do -- do you travel a lot?
L:  Um, I don't.  But as far as airport security, if I think it makes a difference --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I definitely think that this is way past due.  We should've been doing this way back when.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because if we had we wouldn't have had every John, Dick and Harry knowing how easy it was to push us over.  We was just waiting, we was just out there in the open waiting for something like that -- that to happen.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was too easy.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It was too easy for 'em.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, for some reason, um -- I don't know -- maybe it was Godsend.  We -- we never thought anyone would want to approach us that way with any type of controversy because we're the big dog!  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We don't think that they would want to do that but, boy, were we wrong.
R:  Uh-hum.  Well --
L:  We were.
R:  -- I -- I know --
L:  What are your thoughts on the subject?
R:  Well, I know -- I know -- uh, I had gone, uh, overseas to visit my brother, uh, he was stationed in the Middle East, uh, years ago, and, um, you know, when you got to the airport there no one could meet you at the -- the gate or anything, they gotta meet people like, in the parking lot outside of the building.  And then when you left, you know, they had to leave you off in the parking lot, and it was very different.  That was about ten years ago.  But, um ...
L:  You know, that's the Middle East compared to us.  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- but -- no, but it's pretty much the same way in Ireland and in France also.  So --
L:  Really?
R:  -- um, I think the rest of the world's been living with terrorism, you know, far longer than we have.  So, I think you're right, I think we were, you know, well overdue for, you know, changing how things are done number one.  Um, I just wonder if it's tight enough even today though too because --
L:  No.
R:  -- um, you know, you see, like, how you can --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- check your luggage and [SIGH], you know, I know they're doing random checks of that.  But it's still t- for me very scary.  But it was scary before.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  We just didn't know to be afraid! [LAUGH]
R:  You know, before that.  Yeah.
L:  You know, unless you travel abroad the way you say you have and then, you know, you saw the difference.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But most people who travel domestically they do not know the difference, and if the difference was imposed back then they would've called it such a big problem and made this big deal out of it and everything.  But to me even now it is not tight enough.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But then you have to look at the question, how tight is uncomfortable?
R:  Right.
L:  You understand?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  As far as time and all of that goes.  I mean, you would have to be there three, fours [LAUGH] hours before your flight left if it got any worse.
R:  Mhm.  Right.
L:  So, to me we have set forth effort.  Before [LAUGH] we hadn't even put an effort out there.  So, to me we have set an ef- -- set forth an effort that I think is pretty rigid in some instance.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it needs to be like that and from now on you just pray the rest of the way.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  Like, 'cause I know the first time I traveled, uh, like, for work after September eleven 'cause when I vacation, you know, wh- when we go somewhere we're usually going by car 'cause it's the only way that's affordable for us.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I know when I get on the plane, you know, I just -- well, just going through the airport and the military were still there at that window in time, you know, and, um -- and that was a little fearful, you know, but not fearful like, you know, just seeing people, but it was also, uh, at the same time calming because you knew that they were there to help, you know, they weren't there to --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- to hurt anybody, you know?  Um [SIGH], amongst all of ...
L:  And, you know, uh, a lot of people do feel that way if they see, uh, force around they tense up, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, even people who don't have anything to feel guilty about.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But to me when I see that I feel safer.
R:  Yeah, me too, yeah.
L:  You know, I'm like well, he's here and, you know, that makes me feel safer than no one being here.
R:  Mhm.  [MN]
L:  But a lot of people think it's a big deal if they [LAUGH] s- -- for no reason, just out of the blue, "Oh, what's going here?"  The -- you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that's their mindset.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I like that.  I like them to be around.  It makes me feel secure.  It does.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the more I see the more secure I feel.  Not that I think I am more -- you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, just the more of 'em I see --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- standing around it makes me feel safe.
R:  Do -- do you think though that that's deterring terrorists, or do you think that if there are terrorists there they're just waiting to do something else in a different way?
L:  Oh, for certain.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  For certain.  We are living in our last days and to -- whatever restraint we will put on ourselves as far as to what extent they will take --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, the security methods of entering a plane --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you have to think about somebody is sitting over there who all -- just -- [MN] they have to be that type of person.  [LAUGH]  They're sitting over there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they are observing this.  And when we have done all that we feel we can do they will come up with a plan to overlook all this and they're gonna come again.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, now that that has been tried and done, very well I would say [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- other people are looking at us to bring us down too.  If they bring us down they're the big dogs.  They will take credit for that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  Yeah, it's just a scarier world.
L:  Don't you think they're gonna continue trying?
R:  I -- yeah, I do because I think ...
L:  Especially after this war.
R:  Yeah.  I ...
L:  They will.
R:  Yes.
L:  We made a lot of enemies with this war I think.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I think terrorism will always be utmost in the American person minds when they travel, um, not just by air, but at all levels.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think -- especially by air because you can get so many people at one time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But ...  And I saw on the news yesterday that, um, they were labor- laboring the, um, San Francisco Brid- -- the Golden Gate Bridge --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- is one of the second highest [LAUGH] threat.
R:  Wow!
L:  So, you know, the airports they can get so many more people in one place like that.  So, now they're gonna have to shift.  I don't know.  They will always come at us, I think, in the future.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But just open the gateway and to me it's a revolving door.
R:  Well, it's just a very different world because of that, you know?
L:  Oh, most definitely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you know the sad part about it?
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  It won't ever go back to being the way it used to be.
R:  No.
L:  No.
R:  Yeah.
L:  No.  Terrorism will be a part of our life until the day we die.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  I think it'll just heighten because -- I don't think it will go away.  Why would it go away if someone thought they'd made such a big ruckus over here?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  They -- they could do --
L:  Well, of course.
R:  -- so much with so few people.
L:  Of course.
R:  Yes.
L:  And I don't think they're gonna be just, you know, picking us off the block but, you know, there's somebody out there, I would think several somebody's, who think that they can get away with it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, the way people's minds are? 
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I would hate for that to happen again.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, so much is [LAUGH] going on, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  'Cause it's not only without, it's even within our own people, with the -- you know, like the guy who did that thing in Kansas City when they blew up the Government Building, you know?
L:  Yeah.  And I -- I think that was some of our problem too.  Uh, we didn't have, um, our [LIPSMACK] import and export areas, you know, tight enough.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That said a lot about our way of thinking.  [LAUGH]  To me.  You know, that's just the w- --
R:  Yeah.  We're very naive, you mean?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  We're very naive as, uh ...
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Exactly.  If you're not going to, um, put a buffer to, say, around your major mode of transportation in and out of your country, I mean, what else are you not paying attention to?
R:  Yeah.  I guess that's true.
L:  You know, 'cause that's a big deal.
R:  Oh, my God!  Yeah, I guess you're right.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I didn't think about it that way.  Yeah.
L:  "Oh, we were just sitting out there waiting.  It would've happened eventually".
R:  Mhm.
L:  To me this had to have happened, you know, this -- I think this was planned way back when.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  And they just got it together to pull it off and we're gonna always live with, uh, terrorism as a threat from now on.  I know I will.
R:  Hm.
L:  Because I've been made aware of it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then you'll be made aware of it again when you go to travel [LAUGH] at the airport.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, the line is, you know, a half a mile long.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's kinda like you could live in denial a little bit if you're not in the airport.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause it hasn't come up in another area yet, you know?  But, um, it -- it -- you know, I think -- I think probably it'll deter them from doing something the way they did before, but they'll find where the hole is --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and then -- and go that way.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  "We got that covered".  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I saw on the news, um -- you can tell I'm a news watcher.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I saw on the news just on yesterday that, um, they're training already the pilots, the airline pilots.  They're not making them do it, but it's a -- by choice --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and if they want to take target lessons and carry a gun they can.
R:  Oh, my God!
L:  So, as of tomorrow -- but you don't know what pilots have guns and what pilots don't.  The airlines are not --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to be made aware who's carrying.  But the class was so full it's gonna end, um, coming here soon, about the first of the summer, and they're gonna start another one in July.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, it's like a voluntary thing.  They don't have to take the course.  But, I mean, who wouldn't want it?  And once you've got permi-
