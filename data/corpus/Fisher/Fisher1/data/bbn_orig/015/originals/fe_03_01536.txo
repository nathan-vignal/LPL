L:  Hi, I'm Janette from Minnesota, who am I --
R:  Hi.
L:  Who am I talking to?
R:  This is Joyce, I live in North Carolina.
L:  Well, hi, Joyce, how are you today?
R:  I'm fine, thank you, how you doing?
L:  Pretty good.  Um, do you wanna start or shall I?
R:  Well, you go ahead.
L:  Okay, um, this is about my fifth call with this company and I find this just fascinating, um, today's topic is strikes by professional sports.  Um, I'm definitely against them.  I think they are making so much money now as it is.  I just think that it's gotten to the point where the average family cannot even afford to go to these venues to -- to watch baseball or football and it's -- it's just gotten out of hand.
R:  I think all athletes get paid too much money nowadays.
L:  Oh, absolutely.  And the strikes themselves I -- I -- I -- personally the only time I was ever involved in a strike was I had won a contest from a local newspaper here in Minneapolis where my family and I actually won a trip to Boston for four --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- to -- yeah, to watch the Twins play --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and we were going to be their professional guests of honor, they were gonna fly us out there, put us up in the hotel at the Twin Inn, we were gonna go to a banquet and get spending money and the whole bit.  Now, this was back in, I think it was ninety -- nineteen ninety, ninety one, I can't remember it's been a while.  But it was a four thousand dollar trip.
R:  Wow.
L:  You know, it was the first time I've ever won anything like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I was just absolutely thrilled and then the strike happened and [LAUGH] and it dragged on and on and on --
R:  Oh, so you missed the whole thing.
L:  -- and we never got to go.  No, but what --
R:  Well --
L:  -- what finally happened was, um, there was, um, an earthquake in Kobe, Japan --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  --  in February and I told ya -- I told my family I said, "You know, I don't think we're ever going to go on this trip".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I said, "How do -- how do you feel about us donating that money to help those poor people in Japan" because it was in the winter time and I was thinking, "Gosh, they're suffering in the same kind of weather we are here in Minnesota".  So, that's what we did.  We just donated the -- we contacted the, uh, the Star Tribune and the Twins and they thought that was just great so ...
R:  Well, that's a wonderful thing for you to have done.
L:  Yeah, but it really kind of screwed it for us. [LAUGH] So, we -- I still haven't been to Boston --
R:  Yes, well --
L:  -- because of that strike. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well.
L:  I'll get there some day.
R:  Boston'll be there. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  It's not going anywhere.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Oh, it's terrible.
R:  Well, I just -- I think with the -- the strikes and things like that I -- I don't think that that's correct and in the way that these people act nowadays it --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- the -- the real, I would say, I was not going to say, "Joy" but, you know, the idealism for children and sports events and people have gone out the window.
L:  Oh, I know.  They're -- they're role models for youngsters.
R:  Yes, they were supposed to be but not anymore.
L:  No, and it's a shame and -- and they're using their -- their money and their fame for just, you know, selfish, um, means.
R:  Right.
L:  And they not promoting their sports.  And maybe -- maybe there's just a couple of bad that are doing it and all the rest of 'em are doing the job like they're supposed to but --
R:  It --
L:  -- it -- it's just such a shame that --
R:  It's -- I think when -- when people strike, well I don't like striking anyhow but sometimes it's a necessity but I think when people strike, especially those people that make that much money and they strike because they want more that -- and they're -- and if they're bad role models, I think they should get rid of them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean they get rid of employees that are bad --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- why can't they get rid of them. [LAUGH]
L:  Absolutely.  Not only that but I think the strikes are the ones that -- it hurts the little -- the little guy.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, it puts everybody out of business.  The people who are selling the hot dogs --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the tee shirts and the ticker takers and all the people who clean up the restrooms after the games and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- all those people, what do they do?
R:  Right.
L:  You know, they're out of a job and when they do go back --
R:  And -- and what do they care?
L:  -- to work -- yeah, and -- and when they get back to work where -- where does their money come from.
R:  That's right.
L:  They're not going to get an increase in their salary.  It's -- it's the --
R:  I agree with that.
L:  Yeah, I -- I think strikes, uh, served the purpose in this country when we had the sweatshops and, um, you know, child labor laws that were necessary but, in so many instances --
R:  You know, even that is, you know, that's so many years past now they're -- they're just not there any more.
L:  Exactly, yeah.  But now the unions are just for always squeezing, you know, every last drop out of [LAUGH] -- out of management --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, you know, I mean it's just and somebody's got to pay for it.
R:  [LAUGH] I know.  And I said the other day -- we were just talking about that the other day, I says, "Remember, when you go to the movies" I said, "The tickets would cost ya a quarter, a dollar".
L:  Mhm.
R:  I said, "Now, it costs you ten dollars to get one ticket to a movie and twenty five or thirty dollars to go see a baseball game". [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  I know and we haven't been to a game now, it's been about two years and -- and one of the main reasons we went was we got free ticket so we took, um, my -- my husband, myself and my daughter and she took a friend.  And I was just saying, "I don't know how people can afford to do this, you know, when they go out and buy the tickets".
R:  No, not any more.
L:  Yeah, and then, you know --
R:  And then what happens to those people that have paid for their season tickets?
L:  Oh, I know, who can afford season tickets any more. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know. [LAUGH] Really.
L:  Oh, my gosh, it -- it is, it's just unfortunate.
R:  I know.
L:  I -- I just wish that, uh, the people who really counted, like the teachers, you know, at -- at our schools in America could get salaries like that.  You know, the people --
R:  I know, the people that who really do the work --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- are -- are the ones that really deserve it.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And --
L:  You think athletes are bad, how about the movie stars? [LAUGH] I mean --
R:  [LAUGH] Yes, yeah I know --
L:  -- they're even worse.
R:  -- those two.
L:  Getting twenty two million dollars to make one film, I mean, really!
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  What is wrong with this country? [LAUGH]
R:  Something I -- it's just I don't like it now that I can -- that I have to pay for a car the same that I used to pay for house.
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Isn't that just unreal?  I just --
R:  I -- and it's because it -- I really feel it's because people like the people that are in sports that have gotten higher and higher wages and it's -- everything is -- goes in accordance with everything else.
L:  Yeah.  Everything does because that money's got to come from somewhere.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, every time those salaries go up then the tickets go up, you bet.
R:  And -- or -- and -- and they have to have a new stadium every other year.
L:  Oh, we've been dealing with that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I feel bad about it because my husband works for a company that is an architectural firm and they wanted to design the new Twins stadium but, uh, the, uh,  climate[?] in Minnesota was they didn't not want any taxpayer dollars to go for it so they've -- they've shot down every single proposal for a stadium and part of me --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- is going, "Yay, no more taxes" and the other part of me -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- is going, "Oh, boo, that's a job my husband could be working on". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, we're kinda caught between a rock and a hard place.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  So, I think I -- I have to go with the taxpayers side because we've got multi million dollar business owners who don't want to chip in any money but they want a brand new stadium.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, and the stadium --
R:  And we've got a -- they just did a, uh, thing down here, uh, our baseball -- our basketball team left from Charlotte.
L:  Oh.
R:  And they went down to [inaudible] Florida, so they brought in -- tried to bring in a new one.  So, they're trying to decide who has the most money to come in [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, absolutely.
R:  And the persons coming in want another new stadium. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's -- and it's just like that all over.  It's -- it's -- and that kind of mentality's spread because it's like, uh, we've local fire departments here.  One fire department gets a new fire station and everybody else wants a new one too.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And someone gets a new fire truck, you know --
R:  I know, it -- it -- it goes -- it goes from person to person, it really does.
L:  Exactly.  It's like these boys want their toys --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they wanna show 'em off to their other boys, you know, and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] -- that's about what it is only now you're talking multi million dollars, you know, but --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Oh, they must have some big old club somewhere that these owners get together.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Chew on their cigars and talk about [LAUGH] --
R:  I think you're right about that. [LAUGH]
L:  It's just nuts.  What's the weather like in your part of the world today?
R:  Ah, this weekend has been very cold and rainy.
L:  Oh, same here, same here.
R:  And my daughter came down to visit and I'm very disappointed that it wasn't [LAUGH] at least nice for her. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  I tell you we got up to ninety two degrees last Monday.  It was so hot we had to turn down our air conditioners and then two days later we had a snow storm [LAUGH] snow and ice.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Thank goodness the snow didn't stick around.
R:  Well, it didn't get that bad here. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It is just gloomy and rainy here today but --
R:  Well, that's how -- they said it's going to be like this all weekend so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I said, "At least I didn't buy a new Easter hat". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, do you have anything else -- do you have any other personal experiences with the baseball strikes or football or basketball?  Any --
R:  [SIGH] No.  I -- I really am not that much into sports to tell you the truth.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've got -- you know, I used to be really interested in it but I've gotten away from it.  When it got -- when they started doing all this extra stuff and getting so much more money and it's got so commercial for me I really didn't even like it anymore.
L:  Yeah, I know what you mean.  I know exactly what you mean.
R:  My grandson's getting a -- a scholarship though for -- uh, he's graduated from high school and he's getting a scholarship for basketball so I guess that's good.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That'll get your interest spark back in it again, you bet.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, congratulations on that.  I hope he goes well with -- goes places and does good things.
R:  Oh, I do too.  Hopefully.
L:  That would be wonderful.
R:  But you just don't know.  He's not -- he's not actually that interested in becoming a professional but it's helping him get through school --
L:  Oh, you bet.
R:  -- so that's nice.
L:  If it helps pay for college, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- take advantage of it, you bet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And as like the only sports I've been really interested in lately is when the Olympics are on, I really love skating.
R:  Yes, I like the Olympics.  I --
L:  And -- and then look at what even happened in the Olympics with this skating, you know, there was cheating and -- and collusion going on.
R:  Yes, right.  
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, well that's true.
L:  It's -- its --
R:  But at least they're not paid, you know, I mean [LAUGH] -- I mean, they're not paid to the -- to the point where they have to worry about -- I mean, they're not paid to -- to do their sport, is what I'm saying.
L:  Right, but -- and -- but, you know, it used to be where it was all amateurs and then they were --
R:  Right --
L:  -- competing against, you know --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- the -- the Eastern Block countries where --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they were just -- these people were just ...
