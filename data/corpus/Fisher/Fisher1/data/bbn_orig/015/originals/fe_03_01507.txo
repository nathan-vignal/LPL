L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name is Lisa, I'm from Michigan.
R:  My name is Clayton, I'm from, uh, in Allentown, PA.
L:  Okay.  Wow, then that's pretty close to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- home for you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as far as the topic.
R:  Oh it --
L:  I bet you that's really affected you.
R:  Oh yeah, well, um, I -- I actually -- I go to school at Penn State, um, which is in State College, so -- and I was out -- I was at Penn State at the time when it happened.  But, uh, I remember waking up in the morning and I u- -- I would always check on the, uh, the weather channel to see what the weather was gonna be like for today.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I turned it on and there was talk about some kind of issue in, um, New York City and, um, I'm like, "Oh, I wonder what that's about?"  They were talking about flight delays and whatnot.  And so I turned on the news then and the first picture that came up was of like, smoke, you know, and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and everything from, uh, the -- the World Trade Center building.  It was like, "Oh wow, it, uh, uh, something happened".  And, uh, th- you know, then they started talking about it, they thought it was a terrorist attack and I was like, "Holy cow!"
L:  Yeah.
R:  So yeah.  [MN]  And the -- and the whole -- I mean, they canceled classes but -- and, uh, it was just a -- it was a really awkward day, and, uh, my mom actually, um, works in central -- works at a location in central Jersey, North Central Jersey, and you -- she could actually see some of the smoke, she said, from, uh, where she was working.
L:  Wow.
R:  From the buildings.  So yeah, it was definitely, uh, an odd day.  Um, and I basically spent the whole day j- in front of the television set.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Watching the coverage.
L:  I think the majority of us did that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I know I di- -- I have a -- my best friend is a flight attendant. [NOISE]
R:  Oh yeah?  Oh, wow, that's --
L:  And I was watching -- gosh, well, I don't even -- one of the morning shows, uh, drinking coffee watching that, and I seen it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I seen the plane go in and m- instinct took over, I just picked up the phone [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- 'cause I didn't know where she was --
R:  Oh wow.
L:  -- if she was flying.  And, uh, that -- that was a very scary thing.  And -- and thank God, you know, I'm sorry that other people died during this, but she wasn't on -- that wasn't even her airline.
R:  Oh, well that's good.
L:  Yeah.  So it -- it was just really freaky.
R:  Yeah, I didn't -- you know, I was fortunate enough not to -- there was nobody that I knew or any family members or whatever that were, you know, involved with it, but, uh, certainly, uh, you know, y- y- -- there were -- I mean, you just -- as soon as --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as soon as you saw that you just, you know, you started fearing for the lives of all the other people --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- that you knew were in the building.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- all I did was cry.  I think I just cried that whole day for all these people and just for [MN] seeing it, seeing the plane go and hit those buildings, it was just ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't think I ever -- I -- I -- I will never forget that.
R:  Oh yeah, definitely.
L:  As long as I live.
R:  I mean, I have -- yeah, I -- I -- well, I remember --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- seeing the, uh, second plane, you know, because that happened live while they were covering it when the second plane --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I, you know, I was watching when that happened and that was -- that just added to the whole, uh, ho- horror of the whole thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, but yeah I have -- I -- I collect -- I kept newspapers from that day and everything and I still have those stored away here somewhere but, uh ...
L:  Yeah.  I did the same thing.  I bought like, um, three days, the day it happened and, you know, the two days following.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I bought those.  And then I bought some other kind of special issue book.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, 'cause my son, he -- he's eleven but, you know, still to try and explain to a child --
R:  Right, mhm.
L:  -- you know, why.
R:  It can be tough, yeah.
L:  So, I figured, you know, I'd just hang on to all of that.  When he's older he can look through 'em.
R:  Right.
L:  And -- and see it.  But he didn't need to see it now.
R:  That's good.
L:  Just like the war m- you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] Just -- he don't need to know none of that.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [MN] Yeah, it was just -- it was just a terrible thing.  I know it affected me in the simple fact, I don't fly any more.
R:  Oh yeah?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I quit flying.
R:  I -- I -- I would say, I mean, I've always had the -- I -- I -- as far as affecting my life, changing it in any way, I don't know if I could really say -- I mean, I -- maybe it made me more -- a little more aware and -- and to be aware of what's going on out there in the world every day.  But, um, as far as flying, um, I mean, I've always -- I don't really think that's changed my -- my outlook on flying as much.  I mean, I always -- whenever I -- I've done a, you know, quite a bit of flying in my life I'd say, and every time I would get on a plane I always had that fear that, you know, in the back of my mind that th- there's a slight chance that something could happen, but, you know, I'm a -- a devoted Christian and the way I look at it is if -- if God wants to take -- take my life, then well, I guess he, you know, he has a good reason for it and, uh, I don't argue with the good Lord, so ...
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  That's his choice and ...
L:  Yeah, it just [SIGH] I've always kind of been aware, you know, of, you know, the surroundings and what could happen, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it never really dawned on me about flying, that things like that could happen --
R:  Right.
L:  -- 'cause it's like, that's just TV [LAUGH] you know!
R:  Yeah, I would say it --
L:  And --
R:  -- probably, I mean, I -- you know, I don't think we ever saw anything that big obviously before as far as a, you know, a terrorist attack on a plane or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what -- whatnot.  But, uh -- so I'd say maybe it has me a little more w- uh, slightly more worried about that.  But as, you know, as [MN] -- if I ever have to fly again I'll definitely do it, um, it really hasn't backed me off from, you know, from doing that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to get to a- a- another location.
L:  Well that's good, that's good.  No, me, it just petrified [LAUGH] me!
R:  Oh yeah.  And that --
L:  I won't -- I won't do it.  I, you know, I just can't do it.  Uh, I tried it and I -- I couldn't get on the plane.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  I just could not do it.
R:  Wow.
L:  And I think it just -- it hit me even harder that, you know what, planes do get hijacked.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And things do happen.  But we had, what, three planes that day?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So, you know, it was just like [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  It -- it just really got to me.
R:  Yeah, and well --
L:  Actually there was four planes.  So, you know, i- it just got me.
R:  Yeah, that's right, there were four, right, mhm.
L:  Yeah, Pentagon and then the one that went in the field.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  And then the two.
R:  That -- that's actually -- the w- -- the one that went in the, uh, field out here in western PA, that was -- I s- -- I actually saw -- probably fifty percent of the coverage I watched that day was actually on that because, you know, that was so close to where I am here at school --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- here at school.  I mean, all the local news stations here also cover that area, so they were, you know, obviously they were doing a lotta broadcasting from there as well.
L:  Yeah.  That was just -- it was just a horrifying scene and I -- I -- I'll never forget it but I never want to see it again.
R:  Oh yeah, yeah, I don't think any of us do.
L:  I pray for the people that -- that lost their lives and that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the brave people that tried to save ... you know --
R:  Yes, same with me, yeah.
L:  -- that last plane.  And, um, that's about all -- all you can do, is just pray for everybody who's lost some- --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- their loved ones in all that garbage.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just terrible.
R:  Yes.
L:  But, I don't know ... [NOISE]  But ...
R:  Yeah, i- i- it -- it -- what I -- what I'm really glad to see is how they've really -- I mean, I -- I think overall they've done a good job as far as, you know, beefing up, uh, the security measures and whatnot in the airport.  I mean, it -- it -- it -- you know, obviously there's some of that stuff is still gonna -- you're gonna get people that'll come in with maybe knives or whatnot in their -- in their bags and so forth.  I mean, there's -- I mean, you can only do so much.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  But I think overall they're -- they're cracking down on that stuff more, um, and -- and in, you know -- in all -- in the ultimate, the long run obviously, it's not getting onto the planes anymore, which is, you know, that's -- that's the best thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, I -- you know, th- that makes me happy, to see that.  And I -- I just for it -- like I said, I'm -- I really don't have as much of a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a fear as far as, you know, flying --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, even after what happened.  But, uh, it -- it -- it makes me, I mean it still makes me a little -- feel a little better when I go and g- we get on a plane or whatever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I've flown twice, you know, since that happened and, uh, it made me feel -- I mean, I -- actually, well the two flights that I did really -- it -- security measures weren't that big a deal because I was on a private -- private flight, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- yeah, I mean, it -- I still -- I -- I thought about it and everything and that -- I -- I definitely felt a lot better with -- with security measures.
L:  That's good, I'm glad, you know, that you -- you didn't let it, you know, get you -- well, like me! [SIGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it just basically changed my -- my whole way of travel --
R:  Right.
L:  -- anymore, you know?  Whereas that was the quickest way to get somewhere.
R:  Right.
L:  It's not anymore! [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  Not any more.  I -- I -- I can't do it, I won't do it.  I'm -- it just -- you know, upsets me --
R:  I actually -- to tell you the truth, I actually like, you know, driving in a car better than flying in a plane.  I mean, I just -- I -- I -- I love -- you know, when -- when -- whenever I -- if -- if I -- if ever I'm doing a group event or whatever, um, a group trip, I always like to be the one to drive just because I -- I love the scenery and everything and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and -- and, you know, the changes in the -- the locations or whatnot, the kinds of landmarks you have and so forth [NOISE].
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  See, and I -- I like driving, you know, I've -- I -- tripping up and down the east coast and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- haven't gone this west coast yet, but, um, it's -- I'd rather do that 'cause I could see a lot more anyway.
R:  Right, exactly.  Yep.
L:  Well, I -- I don't know if -- like I say, it just -- it just truly changed my life and my way of thinking as far as the way I travel. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and -- and
