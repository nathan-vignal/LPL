R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  Uh, hello?
L:  Yeah, um, hi, um, this is Anouja[?].
R:  Hi, I'm Chris.
L:  Hi, Chris, how are you doing?
L:  Oh, not too bad. [SIGH] [NOISE]
R:  Okay.  And may I ask where you calling from?  Where -- where are you -- where are you right now?
L:  Uh, Philadelphia.
R:  Okay.  Oh, I'm in State College.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  So ...
L:  Happy Valley.
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] that it is!  And, um --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- so, are you a graduate student, undergraduate?
L:  I'm an undergrad student.
R:  Okay.  Um, I -- I've got my Masters, so ...
L:  Really?
R:  That's okay.  Yeah, um, so, shall we talk about September eleven then?
L:  I think so.  I think [LAUGH].
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]  All right, so, um, so are we supposed to talk like, what changes have we made in our lives?
L:  [NOISE] I -- I think that was how they worded it.  I mean, I --
R:  Yeah, but I -- I -- I couldn't get it and the sense like, changes in our lives, sort of like, what -- what exactly -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah, that --
R:  Did you --
L:  -- that's the kinda question that you saw on the media a lot, I mean like, right after that happened or in the months --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the months after nine eleven.  But it's not the kinda question you see posed at people now.  Even if --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- people -- if people changed what they did, even back then, I'd --  [MN] they probably went back to normal by now.
R:  Exactly, exactly.  But probably they mean like, [MN] right after that or I don't know.  Because --
L:  I guess.
R:  Okay, so, um, what do you think about that incident and how do you think it's changed your travel habits, maybe you're just other ways?
L:  [NOISE] I don't -- I don't travel really anyway, other than by car and I don't go to New York much.
R:  Okay.
L:  I, uh, it -- I mean, I guess being in Philadelphia I -- for a while I thought about what if they -- what if somebody tried to attack a -- a national landmark here 'cause we got a -- I mean, the -- the Liberty Bell, and things like that.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But ... [NOISE] I --
R:  Well --
L:  -- and I really never -- I really never thought about it personally.
R:  Okay.  Oh, well actually I did go right after September eleventh and I saw the Ground Zero and everything and I don't -- I -- I myself personally don't think I was kind of scared or something like that.  But, um, also, um, um, I don't -- like, just because it happened in New York and I'm not like, a very big city person or a big town person.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, um, I myself don't go there too often.  Um, but other than that I think, um, b- I haven't had a chance to fly or anything and so, you know, I don't think I've ever thought about whether I would want to fly or rather --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- you know, go by boat or something.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  But I don't think I am really scared.  If it has to happen, it'll happen.  That's what I think, primarily.  So, um --
R:  You mean if something else happens?
L:  Uh, yeah.  I mean, if -- whatever has to happen would happen is what I think, you know?  So I'm not l- like -- I don't think I've really brought any changes about in my life and my habit -- travel habits like that, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like -- like, maybe not fly or something like that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because something else might happen.  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I -- I like -- I more or less believe that whatever has to happen would happen.  So, it might as well happen on road or it might as well happen just anywhere else.  So ...
R:  So --
L:  You know, it's not necessarily that you -- only when you're flying somebody might hijack [inaudible] you know?
R:  [MN] Sure, sure.
L:  Yeah, so, um, I guess not really except that yeah, I did feel bad about people who died in the tragedy and everything, but, um, other than that I don't think I really made any changes in -- other than that, I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  No, not at all.  I wouldn't wanna -- I mean, I wouldn't wanna go on a -- I wouldn't wanna go on a plane or an airport anyway just to say I would feel -- I would feel anxious about all the security and all the police and stuff looking at you.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Or that I would -- or that I would be staring somebody down --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in the airplane like a -- by -- like, without even knowing it.  And like, make somebody else feel uncomfortable.  Like, I wouldn't wanna be in that --
L:  Exact --
R:  -- situation, or --
L:  -- or -- or [inaudible].
R:  -- p- put somebody in that situation.
L:  All right, all right.  Um, so, um, um, when do you graduate, Chris?
R:  Uh, late -- um, I'm -- I'm in between, I'm -- I'm -- I'm taking some time off right now.  Probably within the --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- next year or so.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, well, um, that's that.  And are you scared about like, are you -- are you scared about any [inaudible] attacks that might happen because of the Iraq war that's going on?
R:  No, not really.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I mean, not at all, 'cause I mean, d- that's all -- some people I know, some people I work with talked about that and that was, uh, one of their arguments about why we shouldn't have wars, 'cause there'll be another attack here, but [MN] the war -- the war's already over, there wasn't, and there's gonna be more terrorist attacks in America whether th- we went to war with Iraq or not, so ...
L:  Okay.  You're right, I mean, l- just like that.
R:  They're -- they're -- whatever they're gonna do, that -- that -- that's one -- that's just not gonna change their minds.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Well, like -- like -- like -- like if we didn't attack Iraq like, there'd be no more terrorist attacks?  Like, come on.
L:  Mm.  I know.  I mean, that's -- I mean, obviously, because again you come down to the same thing, whatever has to happen and whenever it has to happen it would.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but --
R:  I -- I -- I'd --
L:  -- you know, one thing --
R:  -- it's like a fatalist kind of view and it's kinda how I feel, like f- fate -- fate.  And things happen in war, so if they happen --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- they're -- they're meant to happen.
L:  Well, I -- I do believe in destiny as well, so --
R:  [COUGH].
L:  But one thing -- one thing that has really affected me --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um, after September eleventh, like I would like to point out, is like, I'm -- I'm from India, I'm an international student here, and, um, I think after -- after September eleven what really has changed are the -- are the visa laws and the immigration laws for international students, you know?  So, um, that is one thing that has really, really changed, and, um, that's making -- that's making things difficult for people back home to kind of --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- to America.
R:  [COUGH]  Right.
L:  And, um, that's really sad.  So, what I have --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  What I have really decided is like --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you know, kinda of not to -- not to leave here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'til my studies -- t- 'til my studies are done.
R:  Mm.
L:  Because you never know, they -- they -- they might detain you back in India and not let you come back and finish your, you know, finish your studies here.  So --
R:  Yeah, it -- it seems problematic.  I don't know what the good answer to that is.  I mean, it's -- it's -- for someone that genuinely wants to -- [COUGH] to visit this country and to get an education --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I mean, that's something that anybody who --
L:  Has a right to do.
R:  -- who -- anybody should have the right to do that.  At the same time --
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  -- more -- several of the September eleven hijackers were pr- -- either were at the time or previously lived in the United States on their student visas.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and that's something you -- you gotta look at too.  It's -- that's -- that's a t- -- it's a tricky -- it's a tricky situation.
L:  No, but the thing is -- no, but the thing is, Chris, now they have a database where they know that students who are here, uh, f- like students from a k- um, like, overseas who are here, they are like, really enrolled in courses and that they're really studying and not --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- just -- not just [several inaudible words] away.  So what I'm concerned about is that in spite of all that, in spite of all that tracking and having such a good database and everything, that --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you know, you're -- you're probably detaining even the most deserving students to be able to come here and, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, there's --
L:  Because -- yeah, you could -- you could have students, you could make sure that they are actually doing what they are here for and not, you know, not training in other things and probably becoming a potential terrorist, but, uh ... so, that's one of the things that's become so, uh, the thing for us after September eleventh.
R:  [MN]
L:  But, um, other than that is there anything else that you can think of?
R:  No, um, there's a guy actually [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:   I don't know if he's from India or I -- it's been in the papers here recently, he just sued, um, the government for, uh, he got detained for a couple of hours at the Philadelphia Airport --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, a few weeks ago.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just for, um, the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the undercover air marshals were already taking somebody else off the plane [COUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for being drunk or disorderly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and this guy was just like, looking at them like, watching them real close the whole time while they were arresting this other guy and taking him off, and then they arrested him just for watching them.
L:  Oh really?
R:  And this whole thing is like -- it's like, how can you --
L:  It's obvious.
R:  -- you -- you can --
L:  I know.
R:  -- you can be taken into custody just for being a -- a -- a -- a -- a close eyed citizen like you're --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you wanna -- you wanna observe what's going on around you --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and -- and they're gonna -- they -- they had a call from the agents, it was like, "He was watching us too closely, we took him in and they put him ..." they didn't arrest him but --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Which is weird --
L:  -- they -- they --
R:  -- don't you think so?
L:  That's -- that's totally uncalled for.
R:  I know, I know.  So --
L:  To put somebody in a -- in a holding cell --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in a airport for like, five hours, for no reason and then let 'em go, I -- I don't --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't know how much he's asking for but, uh, he should probably get it.
L:  I know.  So that -- that -- that's really weird.  And, um, other than that, um, what else?  How much time have we talked? [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know, it's -- it's definitely -- I don't think it's been ten minutes or else they would've told us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think they're supposed to say.
L:  I -- I -- because I didn't see the t- -- I didn't see the clock when it started.
R:  No.
L:  So, um --
R:  I didn't rea- -- I didn't realize they're -- is this -- they -- they have people from all over Pennsylvania calling into this thing.
R:  I, uh, they are.  Actually, this is my second call, have you got -- have you spoken before?
L:  They called me last --
R:  To anybody?
L:  They -- no, I just called yesterday to sign up and they called me last night and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I was in the middle of something and I -- I -- I declined the call.
R:  Oh, okay.  Because I did one like, um, several months back, maybe -- maybe two months back or something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then they just forgot about it and -- and I was like -- and then I receive an email that, "You -- you still have to do two more calls" [NOISE] and -- and that's how I'm like, doing this, so ... [NOISE]
L:  I was surprised to hear -- I heard from them the same day, I think.
R:  No.  I'm -- in fact when I signed up they took a couple of days to kind of, uh, activate my PIN and all that, and then -- and then I didn't hear from them for -- for -- for -- for another two months, and then I'm like -- I didn't get paid for that first call, so was like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- "Oh, what's happening?  Was it just, you know, was it just a spoof or something? And I'm having -- just taken for a ride?"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But, um, no, so ... [LIPSMACK] but I didn't expect
