R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hi, this is Andy.
R:  Hi, this is Marty.
L:  Marty.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  Nice to talk with you, Marty.
R:  Nice meeting you too.
L:  Uh, they want us to talk about what changes in our lives after September eleventh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I, uh --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Gosh, that's such a powerful time, I can still see all the images --
R:  Yeah.
L:  --uh, in my mind.  And [LIPSMACK] I think [SIGH] the m- -- the main thing that's changed --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- in my life is ... I don't feel as safe as I did before then.  I never really thought that much about someone from outside our country hurting us.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause we're such a powerful nation.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just can't believe that that happened, even to this day.  I mean, I know it did but I just can't imagine that that was able to happen in our country.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And [SIGH] I don't really know if I fully rely on the, uh, security new pr- uh, administrative program.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  That gives us more s- [LAUGH] -- I -- I have my doubts about that.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  So, I guess, you know, it's the first time I've thought of our country being vulnerable.
R:  Yeah.  Um, [SIGH] I kinda feel the same way.  Um, I know that I don't take for granted that there really, um, [LIPSMACK] [MN] I don't take for granted any more that -- that the government quite has it under control. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.
R:  Um, you know, I kinda have to -- I feel like I have to watch my own back, you know, take care of what we need to take care of and -- and keep [MN] -- we're much more diligent at -- at --
L:  That's what I was thinking.  Being very observant.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Of people around us, it seems like.  And, um, I -- I -- I don't tr- fly.  I haven't been in --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- an airplane since this happened and, um, now e- -- now that I -- I'm getting so [several inaudible words] so I don't remember why now or not.  So, my parents b- uh, flew from Maine down here to South Carolina where I live.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, I w- -- at Christmas --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- and I was extremely worried about them and coming and going.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, you know.  Uh, I know they are taking a lot more precautions, but then tonight on the news I saw where they're giving forty six pilots a gun to have in the cockpit.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now that really scares me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, uh, which is a whole other issue.  But as far as what's really changed --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- my life more than anything after September eleventh, I've really got to say that it's just I don't feel the safeness, for me and my family, that I once did.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it's bad enough and you have to worry about people either killing you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or mugging you or -- or trying to steal your kids or, you know, all that, and we all -- everybody in the world has to worry about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but, uh, invasion in our country, that [LIPSMACK] ... it still blows my mind that that happened and all those people were lost.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's shocking and -- and we are more diligent, but at the same time we're still kinda the same, 'cause, I mean, even though I don't [NOISE] -- don't think that the -- the, you know, they have as much under control as they say they do, I -- I still feel like, you know, whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen.  You know.  And -- and --
L:  Well, it's [MN] --
R:  That's where faith takes over, you know! [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, I was gonna --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- say, that's the only thing that I -- I mean, uh, I'm glad we have a president that believes in God and talks about God almost every time you hear him give a speech.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and I think that's so --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- important for, uh, the way people want to keep God out of everything, you know, certain groups, um, outta the school, uh, they want it for money, and -- and I really feel like if we take God outta the country then we're subject to most anything.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  And I feel the same way.  It kinda [MN] now -- that kinda bothers me 'cause they have all this stu- -- this whole thing with the under God coming out of the pledge of allegiance.  Now is not the time, you know, after such a tragedy I really think that was a bad time to even consider that.  Um --
L:  Um, I didn't see anything wrong with it being in there and if you don't believe in God, then just say what you believe in.  I mean, it's -- it's America, we have freedom of speech.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  And -- and so if we wanna say, "Under God" or we wanna say the ten commandments -- trouble is --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- most of us who -- who feel strongly about this issue, we're not the ones out there protesting.  So, so many people think, "Well, you know, nobody's saying don't do it, let's do it".
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's because those of us who believe in God and -- and all these different things, we're -- we're not the ones that are out there in the news, you know.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  [NOISE]  And -- and it does kinda bother me, especially the timing. [NOISE]  You know, I was like, now is when we need God the most, you know --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- after all these terrible things have happened, that's when -- when we should be turning to our faith, not -- not shying away from it.
L:  Exactly.  And I was, uh, I was ... actually warmed --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- by how much everybody helped everybody in New York --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when this thing was happening.  And so many heroes and -- and I -- I think about the firemen and the policemen and all --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- the people who were there at Ground Zero day after day, sifting through that for bones and people and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, and the toll that it's just taken on -- on all those people in that city.  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, my heart just goes still out to all of them.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  But I [MN] -- now, on the positive side of what nine eleven has done, I think it's made us appreciate ... the good things that we do have and that when we're put under the thumb, we will band together and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- become quite, quite, uh, fierce, you know?  Um, I -- I -- I hope they can eventually work out some system.  I mean, there's no way to protect us a hundred percent.
R:  Oh no.  Definitely not.
L:  That's not gonna happen.  And -- but I think they're -- I think they're trying to do all that they can think of doing --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- to protect us.  I don't know how successful they're being.  Um ...
R:  Yeah.  I'm not so sure about the guns in the cockpit thing.  Because, I mean, --
L:  Oh, that --
R:  -- these are -- these are trained -- trained killers.  [NOISE]  That's what they do.
L:  They're -- what they're doing is train- -- giving these guys these courses that train them of how to fight off an attack from someone that's trying to hijack the plane or to blow the plane up, and showing 'em kung fu moves and all --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- that stuff.  And -- and my thought is, well, what if the gun goes off and it depressurizes the plane and -- I don't know, I just -- I can't imagine all of our -- well, all of my life I've always heard, "No, you don't have a gun in a plane --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because that is so dangerous".  So, it really goes against everything that I've ever heard.  But now they're gonna have guns.  And they said the thing is, it's only gonna be forty six guys right now, or women, there was a woman on there too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So you're not gonna know what plane you're flying, if that pilot has the gun.
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  'Cause there's only gonna be forty six in the whole thing for right now.
R:  Yeah.  The only thing is --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they're coming up against terrorists, you know, and these terrorists, they're tr- [MN] -- a pilot who is not used to -- to killing people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is much more likely to hesitate and they're much more likely to have -- [NOISE] be overtaken.  And then the gun just ends up in the terrorist's hands anyway.  I mean, that's my fear, because, I mean, these are people -- you're talking about airline pilots, they don't kill people for a living.
L:  That's right.
R:  Going up against terrorists, who do! [LAUGH] You know?
L:  That's right.
R:  They --
L:  And then with the latest thing about -- well, I hope --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- they screen this guy -- these guys as far as drinking.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because so many pilots being found actually almost drunk --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and stuff.  I'm like, "Oh, Lord --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- now they're giving 'em guns too!"
R:  Oh, that's nice isn't it?
L:  And so that -- that in itself is another thing.  I mean, it's just one more thing that makes me --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- fearful of flying.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, because I'm like, I don't wanna be on the plane that's got a guy with a gun.  Um, you know?  Uh, I mean, I think the passengers pretty much now, they'd just go ahead and jump the guy!
R:  Yeah, no kidding!
L:  [LAUGH] It seems to be what -- what -- the passengers are the ones that's become, you know, the anti terrorist movement.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  And, uh, we just want the pilot to fly the plane.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Get us down safe.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh --
R:  Concentrate on your job.
L:  Exactly.  But --
R:  But --
L:  Uh, I -- I -- I think that people after nine eleven, everybody I have talked to, and I mean every single person --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that I have talked with over the last year and a half, two years, uh
