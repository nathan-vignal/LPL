R:  Would you hold on one second please? 
L:  Sure.
R:  I got a call.  [PAUSE] Hello.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, Mario.
L:  Hey, I'm John, how are you doing?
R:  I'm doing all right.  So do you feel, um, airport security lessens the chance of terrorism?
L:  Absolutely not.  How about yourself? 
R:  Ah, it's hard to say.  I mean, I think it's a deterrent.  I mean, I think if a person's determined to do something, they're going to do it no matter what or find a way to, but it is a deterrent for a copycat per se or suicide person that just wants to make a name for himself, you know, because it's harder to get through.  I mean, I went to the airport the other day, it was like, "Good lord". 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, it took us almost three hours just in a line and then they want to check everything.
L:  What airport was that? 
R:  Um, Hartsfield, right here in Atlanta.  
L:  Oh, yeah, I know it well.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, well -- I -- I -- see, I have a different perspective.  I'm an airline pilot so -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I personally feel if anybody's going to go through security, they can easily get through with no -- with no hassles at all.  It's -- it's more for, um, ah, public's eye.  I mean, I know so many different holes, it's frigging ridiculous.  The rampers don't go through security, the catering don't go through security, gate agents don't go through security and m- many of those are first, you know, entry level jobs.  They -- they, ah, start out at minimum wage so if somebody wanted to do a terrorist attack, all they got to do is buy 'em off.
R:  Okay, that's true.
L:  So, I mean, ah, it -- it might be good to have security going through a point, you know, obviously going through the screen process but so many people don't go through that process, it's -- it's worthless.
R:  Okay.  How about with the marshals they got on the plane?
L:  Oh, well, th- I -- I think that's pretty good.  I mean, obviously somebody with a loaded gun is going to be pretty much stopped --anything -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Don't you think?  But that's only a percentage of the flights remember.
R:  Okay.
L:  It's hit and miss.
R:  Yeah, it's random.  Yeah, you're right about that, never looked at it that way.
L:  Yeah, I -- 
R:  I thought everybody was checked, I -- I -- I didn't assume -- I assumed that they did background checks for everybody.
L:  Well, they do background checks.  I mean, that's the thing, but, you know, background checks are just background checks.  You can't tell what's -- what's going through somebody's mind, you know, and the -- and the funny thing is about the hijacking that happened on nine eleven -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- as the -- as the people who went through, um, ah, Portland airport, they -- they brought through box cutters which were perfectly legal.
R:  Right, right.  I mean, yeah, I mean, there's always ways to get weapons on, even with what they got because they make non metallic weapons.
L:  Oh, Of course.
R:  You know, resin type weapons.  Matter of fact, I sell security equipment.  I sell stun guns and I sell resin, ah, knives and stuff like that.  I even se- I used to sell plastic guns that actually take -- they take a plastic bullet which is fired with, um, air cylinder but the bullet itself is lethal.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  So, yeah. 
L:  Sort of like -- sort of like a, ah, CO two, ah, cartridge, right?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  So ... 
R:  You know, [MN] and that's the only thing that is -- is detectable and those, once you separate 'em from the actual thing, you know, t- well, what do you use this for?  You can come up with nine thousand reasons why you use them.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know, you can buy, ah -- they have survival equipment that takes those in replace of electrical stuff and everything else so that -- yeah, you're right, there's always a way to get something through somewhere.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, if there's a will there's a way, you know, and, ah, by all means, it probably keep the majority of the people who, you know, are just plain idiots.  
R:  So basically all it's doing, all terrorism is doing and all this security is keeping people from going to the airport all together.
L:  Well, you know, ah, I wouldn't really say that.
R:  Because, see, out -- out of ten people I know, most of 'em will not fly since nine eleven.
L:  Strictly because of, ah, the terrorism? 
R:  Simply because of -- yeah, because of that and the fact that all the hassles you got to go through just to go to the airport and everything, but like I tell people, you got to go through the same hassles at Amtrak and at the Greyhound station.
L:  Oh yeah.  I mean, it -- it's pretty much ridiculous.  I mean, the majority of the people that -- that, ah, that need to fly will fly, you know.  Tickets are getting cheaper.  I think more and more people are coming back but I think right now the biggest deterrent is probably the SARS.  I know a lot of people are staying away from airports just because you get -- you can get people coming in from Hong Kong and on Beijing and all that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're afraid to catch a, you know, lethal disease.  [NOISE]
R:  What are you looking for?  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Could you hold on just a second?
L:  Yeah.
R:  How did you get in the back door?  Okay, go ahead.  Sorry about that.
L:  Oh yeah, no problem.  I mean -- I -- I just have a different take on it.  I mean -- 
R:  Let me hear your take. 
L:  On, ah, security in -- in deterring, um, terrorism, I just think that -- a lot of it's show and, I mean, there -- there's really nothing anybody can do.  I mean, it pr- it probably makes it more difficult.  It keeps the low level, um, ah, terrorist or the -- basically the idiots from doing something, bringing something on the airplane but, you know, if somebody is determined to do it, you know, like, like you're saying, somebody can make resin gun, you know, take an epoxy mixture, make a gun out of it, you know, ah, -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then they can get it on, so I don't know.  That's, you know, it's just interesting to see what other people think about it.
R:  Yeah.  I have to agree. 
L:  I mean, do you honestly feel safe -- safer going to the airport? 
R:  Well, it doesn't bother me.  I mean, my -- my -- my -- my thing is if you're going to go, you're going to go.  I mean, you know, if it's your time, it's your time no matter where you're at.
L:  Exactly.
R:  So I'm not going to let something like that, you know, the fact that somebody might blow up the plane or have, ah, or crash into a building with the plane or whatever, if -- if I'm on a plane and that happens, you know, and I can't do nothing to stop it, then it's my time, it's my time.  You know, I just hope I have everything in order when I go.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah, that's pretty much it. You know, you get --
R:  You know, I don't -- I don't worry about things like that.  You know, to me there's just as much terrorism here in America in itself without me having to worry about those on the outside of the country coming in.  You know, because if you look at the Timothy McVeigh thing, I mean, as he was put to death for it, but, I mean, I personally don't believe he did it alone, [LIPSMACK] and what about those that they -- they didn't catch?
L:  Oh, right, yeah.
R:  You know, who's to say that they're not just like the people with the, [LIPSMACK] um, what is that, the anthrax.  I'm sure they might have caught one or two but what about the ring leaders?  You know, I think they should concentrate more on terrorism within the United States from people that are born here.
L:  Right. 
R:  That have gripes with the government before they start going around looking for all these terrorists in the world because [LIPSMACK] you're looking in your neighbourhood and everybody el-, you know, you've got terrorists in your own backyard.  [LIPSMACK] You know, [MN] there's an old saying you've got to clean up your house before you tell somebody else how to clean up theirs.
L:  Yeah.  Do you -- do you think there's more terrorists in the United States than there are, ah, outside?
R:  Sure, I do.
L:  Oh.
R:  I deal with them every day when I deal with these gang members around here.  To me that's a form of terrorists.
L:  Right, yeah, that's a good point.
R:  You know, that's -- they're a threat to my existence, to my family's existence.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, racism, that's a -- that's a terroristic act.
L:  Yeah, I know. 
R:  You know, [MN] I mean, you can't go freely and be who you are or what you're into because somebody has got a problem with it, that's a terroristic act, you know.  A person gets assaulted in the street [MN] because he's white or because he's black [LIPSMACK] or because he's straight or because he's gay or whatever.  That's a terroristic act.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It depends on how you look at it.
L:  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, I can definitely see that.
R:  You know, [MN] and whether it's done by an average citizen or the police.  Police can be terrorists at times, [MN] you know, not all of 'em but some of 'em.
L:  Oh, yeah, there's bad apples in every group.
R:  You know, sure there is.  So I think that they're doing the best they can with the actual airport security.  I think they go a little overboard sometimes individually, [LIPSMACK] you know, like that guy they arrested because he made -- somebody heard him make a statement to his wife or whatever.  I think some people go a little bit overboard with how they perceive terrorism.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, but [MN] I think it's as good as they can get it.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it's -- it's a knee jerk and all, a bit of a band aid for the situation.  But, I mean, like you said, it's -- it's the best they can probably do at this point.  And does it really solve the problem?  Probably not.  I think the majority of the people understand that too.
