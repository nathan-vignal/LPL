R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  My name is Dee, I'm from Atlanta.
L:  My name's Anne, I'm from Michigan.
R:  Okay.  Um, what are your thoughts, Anne, on the airport security these days?
L:  Ah, I haven't really flown since the September thing but I don't -- I don't know, I think it's good to --
R:  Why is that?  Have you purposely been avoiding flying?
L:  Oh, no, I just haven't needed to fly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't travel that much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I don't -- I think it's good to raise security.  I don't know how intense it's been though so I'm not sure if they're overdoing it or not.
R:  Yeah.  I think that, um, it was long overdue, that we should have done it long time ago.  You know, um, most other --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- countries, even third world [LAUGH], you know, have been putting forth some type of effort to deter terrorism and we didn't, you know, it wasn't a part of our vocabulary at the time -- well, it was but we just didn't recognize it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We didn't do anything and I think it's very much needed.
L:  Yeah.  I think -- ah, I think that we really do need to raise security for a lot of things including airports in particular because -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- that's a big area where they could get through.  I don't know how -- how real intense is the security now?  Is it enough do you think?
R:  Um, you know, to me that's a real thin line because, you know, who is to say what's enough?
L:  Mhm.
R:  As it stand now, you have to be there, you know, a couple of hours ahead of time 'cause you don't know how long the line is going to be, you know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But the thing is, um, to me that's a real fine line there, who knows how far to go.  You know, to me, it's better than it was because we didn't have anything before.  We was just sitting out there and anybody who even thought they wanted to do anything, they had no problem succeeding at it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you know, now we are putting forth some effort and, um, to me, we should always continue that.  I mean, to me this is the new way you fly now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think that is the way it's going be too because, you know, they changed the doors on the cockpit.
L:  Yes.
R:  To, um, make 'em reinforced and I saw on the news the other day that today would be the first day that they graduated a class of pilots that have permission and have been given lessons on how to use a gun.
L:  That's good.
R:  Yeah.  They are not making the pilots take the class but, um, you know, it's a voluntary thing.
L:  Mm.
R:  The class was full and they're going to start another one at the end -- at the beginning of the summer I think.  So, yeah, I think they need some type of protection for themselves because who knows, there are so many crazies running around. [LAUGH]
L:  Have you flown since then? 
R:  Yeah, several times.
L:  So is it -- is it, like, more of a hassle than it used to be or it's clearly more of a [inaudible]. 
R:  Well, to me it depends on the way you look at it, and the way I look at it, if I see people, more people around, um, I see you being really cautious about what's in my bags, to me that makes me feel safe.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It is a pain 'cause it's time consuming.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But instead of standing there, you know, with your mouth stuck out about it and, you know, mumbling in -- in a bad mood, you know, just adjust to it.  This is the way of life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  At this point to me this is the way of life.  Um, it's not ever going to go back to being the same.  I hope not. [LAUGH] Look what happened when we were so lax.  But, you know, they, um, they're not dummies.  They saw us sitting out in the opening with no protection plan or whatever for terrorism go because they -- I guess we thought we were too big for it so someone else will try again.  They'll just find a way to go around all the loopholes. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  There's plenty of ways they could get at us.
R:  Oh, yeah. For sure.
L:  And I -- I understand why they wanted to.  I mean, well, we're just -- they don't have what we have and we pretty much aren't giving it to them.
R:  True.
L:  We're not offering -- like, we have enough food to feed the world and yet there's people starving all over the place.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because we're just so focussed on money and possessions that we're not really doing anything to try to give it -- to go to them too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So that they're not suffering.
R:  Yeah, um, and people have different reasons for wanting to hurt, you know, the States.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, some of it runs deep and some of it is just their way of thinking, but in my opinion, our government should have long time ago had the foresight to see that and protected us and maybe would not have caused -- I mean, maybe unfair is the wrong way, maybe it would not have made the accident, you know, nine eleven happen, but the thing is, it wasn't an accident, it was intention, but [LAUGH] the thing is, it wouldn't have been so easily done, maybe wouldn't have been so well organized, you understand what I'm saying, if they had been -- been met with more opposition.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because it was just a coup for them in my opinion. [LAUGH]
L:  It was -- yeah, it was real easy for them.
R:  Yeah, I think so.
L:  They could have pulled that type of stuff all the time and we wouldn't have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Have anything to stop 'em.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Exactly.  So, um, I think that they will try again.  I'm glad that they did the reinforced door and the guns on the pilots.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I think that's good and, um, you know, all the people around checking everything, it's wonderful, but, you know, you tend to forget [LAUGH], you tend to forget.  I went to Detroit, um, a few weeks ago and I had -- I -- I was bringing home a bottle of liquor for a friend but then some friends came over and we ended up opening it, you know.  I'm doing it for somebody else but you used to do that because it's cheaper up there.  So I buy this, uh, fifth of Remy Martin and then friends came over and we drink -- they drink out of it, I don't drink that, and, um, I put the rest of it in my bag to bring home to my girlfriend and, um, they take it at the airport. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I thought that was so funny in -- I don't -- ah, I don't know how come Detroit didn't catch it but they caught it here.  And they took it out and they had a note in my bag telling me that it was against, you know, their policy for me to bring in unopened alcoholic beverages so -- and I've done that a thousand times.  [LAUGH]
L:  So -- 
R:  So, yeah, they're on their job.  Atlanta Hartsfield caught it.  So -- 
L:  That's -- yeah.  I think they really do need to be a lot more aware.
R:  Yeah, I do too.  And it will make you feel safer even if it's a [LAUGH] -- not a really true security thing, you know.  They're never going to be able to prevent someone from doing anything that they really want to do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But to me they have put forth an effort and, um, I think it's good enough but, you know, in all honesty, I believe they're going to take it as far as they can.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I can see us waiting three hours, four hours for a flight.  I can see that.
L:  Oh [MN]. 
R:  I can.  What I wish they would do though, is, um, and it wouldn't -- it wouldn't be very much use in doing it if you don't fly that often, but if you fly often, if they have like, um, frequent fliers something that preregister you, you know what I'm saying?
L:  Yes.
R:  That can be the background check and everything and then we need a HOV lane at the airport is [LAUGH] what I'm saying.  You know, we need a fast lane that you can go in and everything has been done by computer or whatever and you just not have to wait as long.  You still have to be checked out, your suitcases have to be xrayed and everything.
L:  Mm.
R:  But I'm saying you won't have to wait for the initial counter, you know, to purchase your ticket because you'll have it in hand already.  So hopefully they'll be able to do something like that to minimize the wait time because the mood in the line [LAUGH] is ugly.  People are pissed about having to wait, you know, they're just huffing and -- 
L:  Yeah, they're all -- everybody's in a hurry nowadays.
R:  I -- I know, but, I mean, to me just blow it off, don't let it ruin your trip and, you know, just go with it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You don't have a choice.
L:  It's better to be safe than blown up. [LAUGH]
R:  I totally -- [LAUGH] I totally agree.  But, you know, what I don't understand is why would you stand there and complain?  You saw what happened. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I'm saying, when there was no concern?  So why would you stand there complain when they are taking concern at this point?  What do you want them to do?  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Yes.
R:  To me they should have had foresight to see this beforehand but they didn't so once something happened they took precautions and you want to stand there and huff your nose at them, come on.
L:  Some people just think they're untouchable, like, "Oh, it wouldn't happen to me" and they get irritated when their lives are messed up because of it.
R:  True.
L:  They just can't accept that, you know, this is what life is coming to.  We need to be cautious or else we could get blown up.
R:  Exactly, and how short or half minded do you have to be to know that they're doing it for your protection?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it didn't come cheap.  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  You know, they are still training people and they have to change their protocol and, you know, their hierarchy system, the way it was set up and everything so it didn't come cheap but it was something that had to be accomplished.  So, you know, I don't have a problem with it.  Um, to me if it gets real r-
