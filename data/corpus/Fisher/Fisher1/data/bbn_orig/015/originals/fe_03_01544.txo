R:  I'm doing good.

R:  I missed the topic though, what did they say we was talking about?
L:  I didn't quite understand the topic either, did you?
R:  No, I didn't --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and they was talking so fast I don't know what it were.
L:  It was something about professional something or rather.  I know it was very unclear.  I felt the same way. [LAUGH] I was listening and I said to myself, "What did they say?" [LAUGH]
R:  What did they say?  It kept fading in and out and I got like, oh, oh, something wro- a [inaudible] problem and I sound kinda bad right now.
L:  Oh, I'm sorry.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  
R:  No prob --
L:  Well, it wasn't -- yeah, my phone didn't sound bad it was just them that -- that recording was not clear at all [LAUGH].  I --
R:  Right and we shouldn't be held accountable because of, you know, we didn't get a clear passage.
L:  Right, it said something about [SIGH] how do you feel about professional [MN].  I though --
R:  Absolutely, absolutely.
L:  Okay [LAUGH].
R:  And I'm going, "Professional what?" [LAUGH]
L:  So, I have no idea but anyway it is nice to talk to you.  I -- I'm up here in Connecticut [LAUGH] and --
R:  Oh, great.  I'm up here -- I'm down here in Georgia then.
L:  Oh, so at least maybe it's warm down there, is it? [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, yes it is.  Matter of fact it is and, uh --
L:  Good, good.
R:  -- warm in the daytime and cool at night.
L:  Ah, yes.  Well, we -- it's funny up here because we had one eighty five degree day the other day and then the next day it went down to thirty five, can you believe that?
R:  Whoa.  I know that was very uncomfortable.
L:  [LAUGH] And we said -- we said --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Oh, here's New England, you know". [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my gosh that's terrible.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Eighty five is fine but that thirty got to go.
L:  And then boom! right down to thirty five.
R:  Mm.
L:  It -- no, it's just funny.  Our weather up here is very changeable but that's okay I've lived here all my life so [LAUGH] and I love New England so --
R:  Oh, good for you.  Uh-huh.  I've lived in Georgia all my life --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so, you know, I'm used to the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- pollen and, uh, you know, we have horrible pollen.
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  I mean it be yellow everywhere --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's not as bad now it just we're [inaudible] setting and it's more like when the cars move you can see the yellow film on the -- you know, where something is setting.
L:  Right.
R:  But when you walk outside everybody's bound to have allergies and stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- here in Georgia.  Mhm, especially this time of year.
L:  Well, that's because everything can grow better, right, because you have a longer -- you have that longer warm season, right?
R:  Yes.  Well -- well, we have, uh, we have all four seasons.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Winter, summer, spring and fall and believe me they all come in on time too! [LAUGH]

R:  Oh, wow, I love flowers.  I bet that's beautiful.
L:  Oh -- oh, yeah, thank you, yeah they are.  They're fun. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  Especially having a cold winter, it's nice to see them show their faces, you know, early in the spring.
R:  Absolutely.  Yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I know when, uh, winter time pass here it's more like, "Please let something start blooming so I know --"

R:  "-- something is -- the weather's getting ready to change". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's right.  That's right.

R:  And I'm going where did he get that from, where did he get that from?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And my daughter was like, "Well, Mom, I guess she -- he got it 'cause we always say let's got to grandma's house".

L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you have kids.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Mine are -- are eight and ten so they're kinda of in that getting older stage, two girls.
R:  Oh, good, good, good.
L:  Yeah.  My younger one -- you talk about what they call they're grandmas, my younger one calls her -- her grandmother, Gram Cracker --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because [LAUGH] -- because when we went over there, uh, my mother always used to give them chocolate gram crackers, right?
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  So, she just started calling her Gram Cracker and it stuck.  I mean she still calls her Gram Cracker. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  How cute.
L:  Isn't that funny? [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  That is so funny.  I tell you --
L:  Kids are -- kids are cute though.
R:  And her grandmother just loves to hear her called that.
L:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] Oh yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] That's so cute.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But my two -- let me see, mine -- like I say mine is pretty grown -- they grown -- pretty grown but they're like twenty four --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and twenty one.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, that's pretty old.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm, one in college and one married and, like I say, got the two grandkids.
L:  How nice though, yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  At least you've gotten through all those teen years, huh?  I -- I have that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- to look forward to right now.
R:  You've got something to look forward to.  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Just -- just pray a lot.  Just pray.
L:  [LAUGH] Yes, I do a lot of that.
R:  Just pray, just put God first, please.
L:  That -- that's right, that's what we do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, yes, yes and it will get you through 'cause I tell you each one of them gonna go through it four years at a time.
L:  Mm.
R:  And it seems like you start when you're twelve and it ends when they're like eighteen.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, that wouldn't be too bad, if I could be sure that it was gonna end at some point [LAUGH], you know.  And --
R:  It's gonna end at eighteen.
L:  -- and everything was gonna turn around and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- everybody would be okay.  I think that's what you worry about.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That they're not going to be okay when it's all done with, you know.
R:  Absolutely.  You don't know if you're gonna just have to put 'em up somewhere or sit 'em out somewhere or whatever.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, like I say, just -- just hang with the peoples in your church and hold on to -- you know, pray and just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, just talk to God.  He'll come on in there and help you, before you know it it'll be over.
L:  Yeah, we'll we have a --
R:  But they gonna -- they're gonna go through those changes, oh, they're gonna go through 'em no matter what.
L:  Yeah, that's right.  
R:  Mm.
L:  Well, we're a very religious family so I am -- I hope that is gonna help to get us through --
R:  That's it.
L:  -- and --
R:  That is it.
L:  -- keep them on the straight narrow, you know.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because if they can't turn to nobody at least -- you know, if they don't wanna --
L:  Yeah, you can always turn to God.
R:  -- talk to you they can talk to the -- somebody in the church.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they'll give 'em good advice instead of turn them out to the streets.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that's the worsest thing in the world that -- and that's what I tried --
L:  Oh, and that's what's scary, right?
R:  -- to -- oh, yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I tried every- -- I  mean, I -- I tried to protect mine from the street which I did. 
L:  Good for you.
R:  You know, they tried to go out.  They tried to go out there but I was always --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- there going to get 'em. [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I think they always do, you know, I -- you know, you like to think that they're aren't even gonna look or aren't even gonna try but I think that it's just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- too much of a temptation, you know, when they get to those teen --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- years.  There's too much going on out there to -- for them to ignore it, you know.
R:  Ab- absolutely, uh-huh.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  They wanna try things but they'll come back and they'll be your best friend.  'Cause right now my -- my two we have a wonderful relationship now.
L:  Do you have sons or daughters?
R:  Uh, my son is the twenty one year old and my daughter was twenty four year old.
L:  Oh, so you had one of each, that's kinda nice.
R:  One of each.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh, that's how I got a chance to experience both side of the -- of raising boys and gir- a boy and a girl.
L:  Yeah, that's nice.
R:  Uh-huh, but I think my boy were easier than my girl.
L:  Is that right?
R:  Oh, I guess because mothers are so fearful with their daughter.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think if I had of been more relaxed I would have been okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well that's --
R:  But I was --
L:  I was gonna say that's probably true because having two girls I am certainly fearful, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because she's the one that little in school, you know, your girl she holler you like, "What's wrong?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, you -- you react more.
L:  Right.
R:  But with a boy you don't too much react to much but you got to stay in touch with 'em.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah, ove- -- I kinda overreacted with my daughter.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I think some of the things I -- I overreacted on what wasn't very important and some that I didn't too much on it was more important.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But she turned out to be pretty good.  She's a nurse now.
L:  Oh, she is?  That's great.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's great.
R:  She went on -- she came on out of a school and became nurse.  She said she wanted to do what her mom does.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But there for a minute I thought she wasn't gonna do anything [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I think ...
