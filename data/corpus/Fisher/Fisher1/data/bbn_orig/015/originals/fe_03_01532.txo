R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this Julie.
R:  Hi, this Timeko[?].
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm in Oklahoma, where are you?
L:  I'm in Portland, Oregon.  
R:  Oh, okay, Oregon.  Okay.  Well, sports --
L:  I haven't done this before [LAUGH].
R:  Huh?
L:  This is my first time I've done this.
R:  Oh, is it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's -- this is number -- I think this is fifth time?
L:  How many?
R:  Fifth.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  Um, and this is your first?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, basic- ten minutes goes by real fast.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, great.
R:  Yeah, and then as soon as you get the talking really goo- -- you know, really get going on the subject --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they -- they come in and say, "Ten minutes is up, say goodbye to your parties, you have thirty seconds". [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  Yeah, and then at the end you get to, um, leave some feedback if you want to.
L:  But it's your choice?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, cool.
R:  So, professional sports I -- I'm not really a big [NOISE] sports fan of any sport really.
L:  Yeah, I'm not real big.  I like basketball but I don't know a whole lot about the game but I like to watch it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I -- yeah, I prefer bask- --
L:  But the strikes I think are ridiculous because they get paid so much.
R:  Yeah, they do.  They do get paid a lot but I don't -- but I think [NOISE] their salaries -- the salaries basically come from the fans, right?  Would it -- does it come from fan- -- eventually?
L:  I think it does eventually.
R:  Somewhere down  -- I'm sorry.
L:  Down the channels, yeah.  
R:  Yeah.  I don't -- [NOISE] the only people I really -- I mean sport that I see striking would be the baseballers, the only thing that comes to my mind -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is the baseball [NOISE] that seems to strike, man, almost --
L:  I really don't -- actually I think --
R:  -- every year, I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I think, um, I think there are various ones that do I just don't know how -- I wonder how they get --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, they choose to do it.  I mean is it -- does it have to be by group or by team or --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- just by the association?
R:  Oh.  See I -- I don't know enough about the top- -- you know, sports to even --
L:  [LAUGH] I hope they don't mind --
R:  -- talk about it.
L:  -- if we don't know anything about it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Well, we're trying.  But I know they make --
R:  I know they make a lot of money.
L:  -- so darn much money, no kidding. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] My vote is we need -- they need to share that with the rest of us.
R:  That's right.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's right.  That's right.
L:  That would be great.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] I could use a couple of bucks.
R:  Yeah, well, I -- you know, and they -- I -- I just -- and they don't play all that much to really get paid a lot of money.
L:  I know.
R:  I mean the -- I mean the football and basketball players --
L:  And then they pull these --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- silly stunts that get in the news, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Spend all their money on nice cars and nice houses.
R:  Yeah, I -- it's a lot of money, mm. [NOISE] Yeah, and -- well, you know, I guess -- I don't know, if I was in the same position I don't -- mm --
L:  I mean they have to have some sort of reasoning behind it.
R:  -- they must feel -- yeah, the players must feel that, you know, they play well enough to deserve more money than what they're already getting.  But --
L:  And they probably compare themselves to the others and what they make.
R:  Mhm, sure.
L:  Because it's always -- it's always so out there in the public and the news what they make.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And then everyone wants more and they get kinda greedy about it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, I guess [NOISE] the more money you make probably the more debt you go in so the more money you need [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, that's true.  That's very true.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It doesn't matter if it's a couple of hundred or a couple of million.
R:  [LAUGH] Maybe that's what's going on with it, you know, all those players are just so far in debt they need more money, I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] I should let my husband talk on this spor- on this topic.
L:  Well, don't put him on to me because I don't -- I wouldn't be able to say anything --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] -- he would understand [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Does he do sometimes -- do you guys share?
R:  No, mm mm.
L:  Oh.
R:  Mm mm.  He answers the phone and tell me to talk big [inaudible] and he say, "Uh-uh, no" and I say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah".  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Mm mm.
L:  We see them on there and --
R:  But, you know, they don't -- they didn't -- when I first started with the, um, the phone studies --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they were asking for your code.  And --
L:  Oh, yeah I was reading about that on the list I'm on.
R:  Yeah, and they don't -- they don't do that any more.  At least for the last three calls that I've had they haven't asked for my number and I'm glad because I have no idea where it's at.
L:  Right.
R:  Where it's at, so -- I don't know, they changed it, I guess.
L:   So, I thi- I think it's easier too if you don't have to remember that.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I just hope they con- -- I haven't been paid for my calls either.
L:  And you've been doing it -- this is your fifth time?
R:  This is my fifth call.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  And how long though -- how -- when -- how long's it been?  Has it been weeks?
R:  Well, my first one -- when they first started up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I immediately got a call [NOISE].
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which was about, what, a month -- maybe a good month ago.
L:  And I think they're saying it's like sixty days.
R:  Oh, okay. [NOISE] And then --
L:  I bet those strikers don't have to wait that long. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] No. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then last week I got three.
L:  Wow!
R:  Pretty close back to back, two in one da- -- two on one day and then another one the next day.  I think that --
L:  All on various subjects?
R:  Uh-huh.  No, the two that I got back to back were on the same subject.
L:  How interesting.
R:  Uh-huh with -- always a different caller.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then I got another one, it was on -- what was that topic?  I can't remember, I can't remember [LAUGH] and then the one today [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  I actually got, um, got a call, uh, and it -- I put -- it came out on my answering machine --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- 'cause I wasn't here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, I -- and it called twice.
R:  Oh.
L:  'Cause I had two different messages.
R:  Oh.
L:  And so then I was, like, feeling guilty and I though gosh, you know, I mean, you can't just stay home twenty four seven.
R:  No [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] 'Cause you don't know when you're going to be there and when you're not so I just clicked all the nu- -- all the hours 'cause I thought I'd be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then I went and tried to put in my cellphone number and I don't how to get back in it to change it.
R:  Oh.  See I don't have the website address.
L:  Yeah, I have the email from, you know -- what -- like that I was accepted.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But now I've gotta figure out [LAUGH] how to get back in there.
R:  Get back in.  Yeah, I --
L:  [MN]
R:  Mm mm I have no idea.  I know they sent me a email, oh, that was last week also and I went into that site to update.
L:  Oh, you did?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, you can.
R:  I went back in to update but they sent me -- I had a link in the email --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, 'cause you could go back in to update if yo- -- because initially it was only going to be three calls that they were wanting people to do.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they're going to go a little further with the study so you can go -- you can sign updates to receive more calls.
L:  Is that like in a month or, uh, forever?  The three calls on the sit- on the topic --
R:  The three calls, I'm not sure ho- -- it was a total of three calls.  I don't know if that meant three calls -- that was three calls total.  So, if you received a call -- three calls in a month then that -- initially that was to be the end of your participation in the study.
L:  Oh.
R:  You see what I'm saying?
L:  But you'll continue to get calls --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- just as -- as you get up to three then it's the next time period or whatever.
R:  Right, right.  But you have to go in and update to -- to do --
L:  Mhm and how'd you hear about this. 
R:  Huh?  
L:  How --
R:  I got an email from, what was that site?  Mm, this -- I'm on -- you mention a list -- I'm on a list --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Who is it?  Leah's Lounge?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It came -- I got an email from that site.  Somebody emailed it.
L:  Personally to you or it was like the group -- 
R:  No, it was it was to --
L:  Okay, gotcha.
R:  -- do with the group. [NOISE]. Mhm.
L:  Yeah, that's a pretty cool thing.
R:  That was last week sometime.
L:  So, do you, uh, the mystery shopping?
R:  Yes.
L:  Is it okay that we talk about that? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] We better hurry up 'cause our ten minutes is gonna go.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Darn it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, I do.  You too?
L:  Yeah, I -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I've just sort of started doing it.  I mean I've done -- done it for a long time but only a little bit here and there.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.  I've been doing it, um, my little girl is -- putting right[?] turn three, so about three years now.
L:  Wow!
R:  Because I stay -- I'm a stay at home mom so ...
L:  Do you -- does it help you?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I mean, you -- do you get sort of pretty --
R:  I enjoy it, I do. [NOISE]
L:  -- busy with it?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Do you stay busy with it?
R:  You can.  I don't now 'cause I have a two month old now --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  -- so I'm not as busy anymore, mm mm --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- no, but before I was pretty busy.  Mhm.
L:  Uh-huh.  I guess I just --
R:  But the -- the only downfall is I have -- you have to search for those assignments. [NOISE]
L:  Right.  And see I was rea- --
R:  And that's the --
L:  I've been reading about people who -- there is like self assigned or whatever and I have -- I don't know what those are.
R:  Yeah, they -- there's certain -- yeah, cert- -- I don't know 'em by right off the cuff --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, um, there are a couple out there where you can self assign.  Yeah, but you have to go to 'em -- I want -- I want schedulers to contact me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what I want but it's not, you know, it's not all like that.
L:  Right.
R:  You have schedulers that contact you regularly and then you have, you know, you have to go to the sites --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and self assign and --
L:  Right.
R:  So, you really have -- you have to work at it.  I don't like that part of it.
L:  Yeah, I know I'm --
R:  But --
L:  I'm supposed to do one today [LAUGH].
R:  Huh?
L:  I'm going to do one today.
R:  Are you?
L:  Uh-huh, a restaurant.  Oh, it's a Mexican restaurant.
R:  Okay, okay.  Yeah, I've done a Mexican restaurant.
