R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hello.  [LAUGH] Hi, I was waiting for the tone, I didn't hear anything. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Hi, I'm -- my name is Linda.
R:  Linda, hi, I'm Alice.
L:  Hi.  Um, well, let's see.  What the topic was was airport security.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.  I myself [SIGH] feel safer with 'em doing the high, you know, all of the -- all of this stuff that they're doing now.  I feel a whole lot better about travelling than I did right after nine eleven happened.
R:  Mhm.  Do you think it deters, um, you know, --
L:  I think it does somewhat, I think it does, because I don't see that they've got, you know, with all the screening that they do now and I -- I -- it's really weird because I was stopped at -- when we went -- we took a trip last, ah, it was last -- just before Christmas and, ah, I had my packages, you know.  I had some packages that I'd been shopping with.  I had 'em all stuff- stuffed in a plastic bag with my other -- with my other stuff, along with my, you know, my carry on bag and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, went through the check out, and all of a sudden the beeper went off and they took me over to the side because they had thought they had seen something in the plastic bag that I'd been carrying.  And was -- they -- they're, you know, the guy was sitting there with the -- like a computer station where they could see everything that was in your bag.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  As such and, ah, I had gotten a little -- I don't know whether you're familiar with the Ty products, that the Beanie Babies and such.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  Okay, they had -- they had come out with these little dolls and I had gotten two of 'em for my granddaughter.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, I had them, you know, stuck down in the bottom of my bag, and I didn't think anything about it.  Well, they went through the bag, they took everything out of the bag, didn't find anything.  They put it back in the bag and it went off again.
R:  Hmm.
L:  And the guy on the computer was looking at it and it -- the way that the wire, you know, that went through the body of the little doll and down through the legs and such so that they bent, the way that it showed up on the computer, it looked like a razor blade or some sort of a little scalpel like thing.  That was what they were looking for.
R:  Oh.
L:  But they did, they pulled me over and they searched all through that bag, took everything apart.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  It was -- I mean, it was kind of scary really because you didn't know what -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- if somebody had actually dropped something in your bag as such, but I -- I think I feel a little bit safer and I'm -- I'm hoping for sure that it deters 'em.
R:  Yeah.  So is actually the wire in the Beanie Baby?
L:  Yeah.  It was actually the little wiring, you know, they had a little wire down through the body of it and into the legs.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And into the arms.  And that was what they were looking at on the screen.  It showed up any type of metal or any -- I don't know what -- you know, what all that goes through, but it -- it shows up any type of metal and I guess some other stuff too because I know that there were -- there were some other things that they were looking at besides the doll, I don't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I didn't know exactly why but he showed me the, you know, the screen on the doll and showed me what it looked like.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  It was -- it was kind of weird.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And I know when we came back, ah, we got off at that stop and had to lay over at another city and came back through and, ah, my grandson, he was seventeen, he was with me and it -- I guess, they just pick a random number of people.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And they pull you out of the line to be searched.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that was what they did with him.  It scared him to death.
R:  Oh.
L:  But, yeah, he had to take everything out of his pockets, he had to take off his belt and he had to take off his shoes.
R:  Right.
L:  So they searched through his shoes and everything.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I'm -- I'm -- I feel a little bit bitter about it.  I'm not too keen on flying anyway though really.
R:  Oh.
L:  Mhm.  And you?
R:  I'm -- I'm not sure.  I mean, I just think that unfortunately even with higher security measures -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think the people who are trying to do harm are going to find a way.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, and with the news pretty much that they're going to find a way to get around it and -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  And, um, you know, it's SARS that probably deters them a little bit more that makes them have to think a little more.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I think ultimately, you know, they're going to -- they're going to find a way. 
L:  Right.
R:  And -- 
L:  I hope not. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I know, but -- 
L:  I really do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I hope they come up with something that's -- it's foolproof on any other but, you know, I don't know whether they ever will or not but I hope this helps anyway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it stops.  I imagine for a while it'll -- it'll stop almost any of 'em until they kind of feel secure in it again but I -- I just hope it -- they do something, they come up with something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They know before they had, ah, -- the way that they are taught, they, you know, anybody could be one of the checkers there.
R:  Uh-huh, right.
L:  And now I think that -- that, ah, like federal and police are doing it so I feel better about that too.
R:  Well, not only that, but all those, um, reports on the shows that show how people can get to -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, get on the airplane without being detected, you know.
L:  Ah.
R:  With fake IDs and badges.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know -- 
L:  That shows that that can be done right there.
R:  Yeah, so I think even more needs to be done and I don't know.
L:  I think I feel more secure with the people like that that -- what -- what worries me more I think than someone getting through like that, like the individual person, is someone putting something in a bag and getting it through.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because, you know, who's to say that they could put something in there and somehow or other, it didn't get scanned or do -- do -- do all pieces of luggage get scanned through or do they just do random checks on luggage too?
R:  I don't know, but I remember when I was flying at, um, you know, they had set up all these tables for pe- for them to go through everyone's luggage, you know, like ran- like, random checks.
L:  Right.
R:  Through luggage.
L:  Right.
R:  And everything, but I don't know, like, behind, you know, do they scan them 'em also?  I don't know.
L:  No.  I don't know -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- if we'll ever really feel as safe as we ever did, I don't know whether we ever will, you know.  It's like so many things can happen.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I really don't care to fly any more I don't believe.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I did go there, went to [inaudible] with -- with -- I travelled with my daughter but, of course, [MN] I guess if anything's going to happen, it can happen on a plane or anywhere else either.
R:  Mhm, yeah, I think I've flown -- flew twice.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Since then or just -- 
R:  I actually flew in October.
L:  Oh, did you really? 
R:  Yeah, right afterwards.
L:  Oh, God, that would have scared me.  That really would have scared me.  I know I think shortly after that happened I believe my daughter did fly somewhere and it -- it -- it seemed like that's all you're thinking about.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  You know.
R:  I think what scared me more, I don't mind all the additional searches and everything.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But what scared me was just seeing all the, um, is that there, ah, g- -- the guards with their, you know, guns and everything walking around.
L:  Yeah, that would be -- that would be scary.
R:  That was what scared me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm just not a big fan of guns.  So [LAUGH] -- 
L:  No.
R:  Being that close. [LAUGH]
L:  I know it, I know it, I know.  I hope they -- I do hope they come up with something that's foolproof so that people will feel comfortable again.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But until then, I guess the majority of us will still be taking our chances every time we go up in the air.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I think every time you go up in the air, you're taking your chances anyway.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  It's just like getting in a car though, you're taking a chance when you go off in a car for that matter.
R:  Yeah, I mean, it's more a likelihood, right?  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think air travel's the safest.
L:  Right, that's what they say.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's more safe than a car.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But if your -- I always said I wanted to be close to the ground. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't have any chance of being flatter something else happens but -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I don't know.
R:  I think it's just -- you feel like you have more control in a car than you do in the air.
L:  Yeah, you get control of your own destiny.
R:  Right.
L:  Not -- not someone else handling, that's -- 
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know.  Oh, I don't know, I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm -- I'm kinda glad I don't live in a large city.
R:  Hm.
L:  Where I don't have to do a lot of that kind of travelling.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But we have our -- everywhere I guess is the same though, every place has their own problems.
R:  Mhm.  So have you done many of these talks?
L:  I've only done I think -- well, this is -- this is actually my third one.
R:  Oh, it is your third? 
L:  Yeah, yeah, this is my third one I believe.
R:  Okay.
L:  It was surprising because the first time -- the day that I signed up for 'em, I think I got two calls that same night.
R:  Oh.
L:  So 'cause this must be my fourth 'cause I know I've had one before -- after that, so it's really strange.  Are you -- have you been doing it long? 
R:  Well, this is my second.
L:  Oh, is it? 
R:  But I signed up a while ago.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And right after I signed up, I got my first call and then didn't get another call until maybe a couple of days ago.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But for somebody -- I just -- it hung up on me.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, goodness.
R:  So I was kind of surprise --
