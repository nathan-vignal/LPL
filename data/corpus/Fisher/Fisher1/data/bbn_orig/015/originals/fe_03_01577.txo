L:  My name is Sharon.  [PAUSE]
R:  My name is Deborah.  [NOISE] [PAUSE] [NOISE]
L:  Hello?  [PAUSE]  Hello?
R:  Hello.  Is this Sharon?
L:  Yes.
R:  Hi, my name is --
L:  This is Deborah.
R:  Yeah, it is.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Did you hear the question?
L:  No!
R:  [LAUGH] I was gonna say I think it said something about, um -- something about terrorism in the airport.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I couldn't get the --
L:  I -- I think it -- I think it asked if the new security measures are, um --
R:  Wh- --
L:  -- are --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- gonna reduce terrorism I guess.
R:  Oh, was that it?  I wasn't quite sure what it said.  [NOISE] But, um, what do you think about it?
L:  [SIGH] I don't know, you know, I haven't flown since after September eleventh, or since September eleventh happened.  So ...
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  Um, I haven't -- I mean, but I've heard from other people that, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, up until recently it was, um -- it took a really long time to get on planes.
R:  Mm.
L:  And most people thought it was kind of, um -- kind of a pain to -- to wait through it all.
R:  Okay.  Well, I flew October right after -- a month after, um, the nine eleven incident.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  And I flew from Connecticut to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and I was not delayed one bit with the security.
L:  Really?
R:  Not one bit.  So, my -- although when I was coming -- when I was returning --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I was on a shuttle headed to the, uh, parking -- parking garage and I heard -- one of the other passengers on the shuttle said that they were quite inconvenient, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because they were -- th- they select you at random to go through your luggage --
L:  Really?
R:  -- and -- and, um, I guess what happened was she had a connecting flight --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she missed it.
L:  Wow!
R:  So -- so, she was quite inconvenienced and she -- she had nothing but horrible things to say.  But my -- in my case I had no problem.  Actually they, um -- they went through my things in -- in the security and I didn't have a problem with that at all.
L:  Huh.
R:  And, uh, so my -- my  -- m- so my experience was fine.
L:  Really?
R:  And so I don't have a problem with the -- the security measures that are going on now, um ...
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  I have a pr- -- I don't have a problem with it at all.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, from what I hear it's -- it's changed a lot, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- since it's been all -- I think it's all Federal workers that are doing it now.  Didn't they like --
R:  Um, I ...  Okay.
L:  -- lay off most of the private, um, employees who were getting paid, like, minimum wage and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- weren't that invested in it?  And now they have, um, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Federal trained --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, employees.  So ...  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Well, there were certainly, um, um, National Guards folks there with guns at the airport.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That was so new to me.  I mean, although I've seen --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- that in Europe, uh, traveling to Europe you -- you know, there was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it was not unusual to see security with guns, but here in the States it was just so new.  Uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I haven't flown since then.  I haven't flown since October.  Not because of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- any fear on my part, but it just hadn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- presented itself.
L:  Yeah.  Me too.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  And I -- I know a lot of people that said, you know, they wouldn't fly anywhere --
R:  Right.  
L:  -- after that.
R:  True.
L:  But I -- you know, I just haven't had the opportunity or the money to do so.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Me either.  [LAUGH]  I know it's cheaper -- I know someone that just got a flight from, um, uh, New York to California, San Diego, for two hundred and eleven dollars round trip.
L:  Wow!  Yeah.
R:  Fabulous, right?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's because they're trying -- really trying to get you to fly again.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I just haven't had the opportunity.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  My friend's Mom just flew here from -- from California for a hundred sixty dollars.
R:  Isn't it incredible?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know.  So, I don't know, maybe this summer I'll, uh -- although in the summer it's like, high peak for flying.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  You know?  But, um, yeah, I ac- actually I know I have a, uh, coworker who flew from New York to Las Vegas just last week.  She just returned last week Wednesday.  She was there for a week.  Hotel and airfare five hundred dollars.
L:  Wow!
R:  I know.  [LAUGH]  That's what I said.
L:  [inaudible] with hotel, that's great.
R:  The MGM -- the MGM Grand Hotel.
L:  Ah!
R:  Five -- right, for a whole week they flew.
L:  Wow!
R:  From Wednesday to Wednesday they were there.  And she said it was nonstop.
L:  Wow!
R:  So, it was from New York right ...  That's what I said.
L:  That's neat.
R:  I said, "Wow!  That's fabulous!"
L:  Yeah.  That's always the worst part of the layover --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you get stuck in, like [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.  Right.  But she said --
L:  -- the Detroit Airport for three hours or something. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  But she said nothing, no incidents, and the security was fine and, you know, going through security no delays, they were able to make the flight.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Nothing.  No -- no -- nothing at all.  Very uneventful going and coming.
L:  Wow!
R:  I know.  I know.  So, you know, I -- I -- I guess I have not heard any other than that one woman who missed her flight, and I can understand the inconvenience.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, no problems with the security measures.
L:  Wow!
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Hm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, I guess that's it.
L:  Oh.  How long have we been talking for?  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  But I know it was -- [LAUGH] it was more than what -- what did they say?
L:  I think they said ten minutes.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, uh, airport security, um ...  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um, where would you normally fly out of?
L:  Um, well, I used to live in New Jersey, so I usually flew out of New York.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  --
R:  Um --
L:  And you're ...
L:  Um, but I've also flown out of, uh, JKF --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- New York and La Guardia.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um [SIGH], the one time I went to Europe [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I flew out of La Guardia 'cause it was just a lot cheaper --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, using -- I used one of those, like, online things and, you know --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  I find.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, La Guardia was a lot cheaper, but it was pretty far away.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my brother drove me there in the middle of the night and left me there [LAUGH] for like, four hours --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- until my plane took off. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow!  Wow!  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Goodness.  Well, middle of the night at least you could sleep.  But I think that's the best time to fly to Europe --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is at night.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You get on the plane and you can go to sleep.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Wake up with the sun in your eyes the next morning.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]  I normally -- well, I -- I used to fly out of, um, the West Chester Airport, uh, it was closer because I live in Connecticut.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But then I found that it was just as close to go to Bradley International in Hartford and -- and, um, uh, no problem.  I mean, I was able to get in and out.  It was just my first time ever flying and --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- fortunately it was, um, [MN] right after nine eleven, so what could be more safer --
L:  Right.
R:  -- than to fly right after the incident?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, uh ...
L:  I guess that's one way of thinking of it.
R:  Yeah.  It was -- it was -- it weren't no problem I'm saying.  It was -- I couldn't believe it.  It was just great.  Everyone talked about the high security and I thought well, I know I'm gonna be delayed, but I was in and out, in and out.  It was perfect.
L:  Wow!
R:  [LIPSMACK] It was great.  Mhm.  And I chucked my luggage.  So, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I didn't want to carry the bulky carry on, uh, because they did have -- they went through everything and they had restrictions on the size.
L:  Right.
R:  So, um, I chucked it.  So, it was fine, it was fine.  But I think on this next trip that we take we're gonna fly out of, um, New York only.  Like you, it's cheaper.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, because they have more -- more flights --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- going out of New York.  [MN] the larger airport.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK]  Yep.
L:  Yeah.  Uh, I wonder if, um -- do you know anyone's whose taken a -- a train, like Amtrack or anything recently?  I wonder if th- they -- they do the same things, or anything with security now?  Because I have a friend who just took an Amtrack all the way from Philadelphia to Portland --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, it was -- Portland, Oregon.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and she was really worried about like, what the security measures were going to be like.
R:  Hm.  I haven't heard anything.
L:  I don't know if, uh ...
R:  I hadn't heard.
L:  I guess, I mean [LAUGH], trains don't have quite as much capacity for, uh -- for terrorism.
R:  No, no.  But, I mean, I guess they would still have to be on some type of alert.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, I, um -- no, I hadn't heard anything about that.
L:  Hm.
R:  That's interesting.
L:  Hm.
R:  Mm, is she still thinking of coming this way or is --
L:  Well, she already did.  She already --
R:  Oh, she already did?
L:  -- went out there.  She's on the -- the West Coast now.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  So, mm -- so, she's there.  Fine, huh?
L:  Yeah.  I haven't talked to her though to find out, you know --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- what happened.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But [COUGH] I don't know if they even go through your luggage when you're taking a train.
R:  Yeah, that's interesting.  That would be interesting to find out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I hadn't heard.  Mm.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, now how long do you think we've been talking now?  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH] I wonder if ...
L:  I thought the robot would back on and tell us.  [LAUGH]
R:  I would -- I would think the, uh, recording would come on.  [NOISE] But, um, no.  Is -- is this the first time you've had the survey?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  This is the first time.
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  Yeah, mine too.  They sent me a message that said, um -- I guess that I had some feature on my phone that wouldn't allow it, but I guess they bypassed it.
L:  Huh.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.  I didn't -- I didn't -- haven't checked my email
