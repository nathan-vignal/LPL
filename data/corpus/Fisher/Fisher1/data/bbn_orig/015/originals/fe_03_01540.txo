L:  Sonny. 
R:  Cynthia.
L:  Hello. 
R:  Hello.
L:  Yes, my name is Sonny.
R:  My name is Cynthia.
L:  Oh, right. [COUGH] So we're supposed to talk about high salaries? 
R:  High salaries for athletes.
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, ah, I think it depends on the sport, um, such as baseball which does not have a salary cap and I think that's all right but I think it's more fair if there is a salary cap, in my opinion. 
R:  You think it's fair if there is a salary cap? 
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, so do I.
L:  Okay.
R:  Because it seems like most of the time when they make, um, an abundant amount of money -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- they have more problems, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  As far as, um, drug use and criminal behaviour.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, for some and perhaps the money itself could be a factor.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  And the people who are having strikes in any sport which is baseball which does not have a salary cap, which is a good point to note, so, [NOISE] um, I don't know what else to say on the subject really.
R:  No, so, is there a salary cap on hockey or --
L:  Ah, -- 
R:  -- do they make as much as the other professionals do? 
L:  I'm not sure if there [NOISE] is a salary cap on hockey but, ah, they don't make as much as the other ones, it's not as much of a popular sport as baseball or football or basketball.
R:  Really? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  It seems like they would get good salaries too though, I mean --  
L:  Yeah, I'm sure they get good salaries but I'm not sure if there's a salary cap or not.
R:  Anything --
L:  The average -- the average is probably lower than the other sports like baseball and football and all that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's just not as popular in the States.
R:  Right, so what -- what do you think the highest paid sport is?  
L:  Baseball I think is.  Well, I think -- I think soccer is up there in international play.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But in the States I think baseball, which is, ah, like in the Rangers, Alex Rodriguez makes a lot of money.  I think his contract was well over a hundred million.
R:  Really? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  Which is really high, he's one of the highest paid players I think.
R:  That seems a bit much.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  And that's just for one season or that's for a number of years.
L:  It's part of the contract, yeah, a number of years, I forgot what -- I think it might have been ten or something like that.  But it's still an extraordinary amount.
R:  Right.  
L:  So -- 
R:  Now does that include like when they, um, -- that's like that's year round? 
L:  When they what?
R:  That's like year round? 
L:  Yeah, year round.
R:  So they're paid when they are on off season too.
L:  Ah, yeah, I am sure they do because they have to practice and all that then.  It's just their career.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But -- 
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Go ahead.
R:  I would think that ba- -- I actually thought basketball was the highest paid.
L:  No, they have a salary cap.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  So that's -- 
R:  And football also?
L:  Football has a salary cap also.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But, ah, baseball doesn't so you can -- whoever is the richest, that's why the Yankees, everyone says the Yankees win all the time -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because they pay all their players a lot of money and everyone wants to go there -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- so they end up winning.
R:  Yeah, but the higher person gets paid, doesn't it make it --  make us pay more for the cost of a ticket?
L:  Yeah, that's probably true actually. 
R:  You know -- 
L:  Also on the demand of the team, how good they are doing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The sport, maybe [inaudible] it could be new so that could have an impact on the price.
R:  So it's a team --
L:  [NOISE] Go ahead.
R:  If the team hasn't one a championship in a few years then it means everybody's salary will drop? 
L:  Ah, if -- well, if they win a championship then they get more money actually.  The league will give the team money, whoever wins.
R:  Okay.
L:  The team actually gets more money but in salary caps of course the salary cap will always be the same.
R:  So, if the team wins they get their original salary that they signed on for -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- plus an additional just for winning.
L:  Yes, exactly. 
R:  That's a lot of money.
L:  And I think you get -- you also get, ah, more money if you get in the play offs and get into the finals and then winning -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's even more so there's different levels of what you get extra.
R:  Wow.
L:  But, yeah.
R:  That's an awful lot of money.
L:  Yeah, there's a lot of money in sports that's why ... but a lot of people watch it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Superbowl's the number one watched sport.
R:  Wow, mhm.
L:  [MN]
R:  I never knew that.
L:  Yeah, but I don't know what else to say on the subject.
R:  I know, it's kind of hard -- hard. 
L:  [LAUGH] Ten minutes is a long time for that.
R:  Ten minutes to -- to talk on that subject.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Well, why is it that the inter- -- why do you think it is that the international players make less money? 
L:  International players make more money in the sport of soccer though.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because I -- in my opinion, I'm pretty sure it's true that soccer is the number one sport in the world.
R:  Oh, soccer is number one sport in the world? 
L:  Yeah, it's just not number one in the States.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But every -- every country around the world plays soccer.
R:  But do we actually have a soccer team? 
L:  Yeah, we have a soccer league in -- in America but it's just not -- it's not -- it's not as popular at all.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean if -- if you look at the players, a lot of the players, the [inaudible] Europe, they have the best leagues of soccer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I don't think they have salary caps either so they -- 
R:  Wow.
L:  -- can pay their players as much as they want.  But a lot of the retired players from Europe come over to the States and play in the American league.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because it's not -- the talent isn't here.  The talent is in Europe or other places.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So this is more popular, but, yeah, the soccer players internationally get a lot of money -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- specifically in Europe.
R:  Right, I didn't know that.
L:  Yep.
R:  I actually -- 
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- wouldn't even think, you know -- I didn't even think about soccer actually when they said that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, when they brought up the subject because, like, you said it's not too popular here.
L:  Right, not at all.  It got a little bit popular during the last World Cup and -- and, ah, USA made it into the play offs but --
R:  But that's all.
L:  They didn't get very far.
R:  We didn't win though, we just made it to the play offs? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I guess that's better than nothing.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  It got a little bit popular for that but the popularity went down real quick.
R:  Mhm, wow, didn't last long, huh.
L:  Yeah, didn't last long at all.  I like to play soccer so I hoped it was going to go up but it didn't work out.
R:  So, do you think that if we actually start paying our players a lot, do you think we have as many people who would participate in sports if their salaries were actually less? 
L:  Ah, well, the salary, if you look at it, it is still pretty high compared to other careers. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  People -- people would still play, I mean, you know, like, the minimum might be like a hundred thousand dollars.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's a lot.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's still a good salary a year.
L:  Yeah, so regardless I think people will always go into sport because the salary level is still high.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  This is compared to other people in the same sport.  Some might get a lot more than others when there is no salary cap.  
R:  Right.
L:  So, that's that. 
R:  Mhm.  Well, they really -- 
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- gave us a tough -- tough subject here.
L:  They did.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know what else to say.  I wish they'd give us questions that we could answer.
R:  I know, it would make things a lot easier, especially since I am a woman and I -- I mean, I know some of our sports and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- everything but I didn't expect a question like this.
L:  Right.
R:  Well, actually, who do you think is going to within the play offs then, basketball? 
L:  For? For basketball?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, I'm from Dallas so I'm going for the Mavericks.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  They're playing today at, ah, eight thirty central time.  I'm not sure where you're from.
R:  Um, I'm from Orlane City, New Jersey.
L:  Oh, all right.
R:  Yeah, so I actually like the Lakers.
L:  You like the Lakers?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You don't like the Nets? 
R:  Ah, I like the Nets but they're not my favorite.
L:  Yeah? 
R:  No, they're not my favorite.  I mean Iverson is good and all like that.  Plus I think lots of times when they make these high salaries, if you notice, they tend to buy their way out of, um, situations that they get in.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  And they're -- they're public figures for the most part, for people they are basically public figures.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that does -- they -- they are an image for children whether they realise it or not.
L:  Right.
R:  And I think that maybe along with all of that salary they should have some responsibilities as to living up to a certain standard.
L:  Correct.
R:  You know, because a lot of kids think what they're -- you know, because they are sports players that they can't do anything wrong and then when they do the kids try to copy 'em.
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  You know, so I think if maybe they had a little bit more responsibility along with that.
L:  Yeah, they are role models.
R:  Yeah, whether they want to be or not.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Everybody, even for adults, they're role models for adults too.
L:  Correct.
R:  And lots of times they don't realise that.
L:  Right.
R:  And some of them, I mean they are in like Daryl Strawberry for one.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You know, he's in and out of rehab.  I mean, it can happen to anybody, don't get me wrong, but I think he -- he takes for granted his position, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he just constantly does the same thing over and over where if it was you or I it wouldn't be tolerated.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, would not be tolerated and I think that along with those high salaries they should have moral responsibilities and a lot stiffer ones than what they give them.  They like slap 'em --
