R:  My name is Anthony Clinton.  Hello?
L:  Hi, my name is David Geldon.
R:  Oh, hi, David, how you doing?
L:  Pretty good.
R:  Oh, so what do you think about airport security?
L:  What do I think about air- --
R:  Yeah --
L:  --port security?  Well, uh, with all of the terrorism, uh, going on --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I just find it to be, uh, a necessity in this day and age.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Something that we just have to cope with and, uh, work with.
R:  Mm.  I do too, uh, but I -- I think pretty much that it -- that, um, it -- it -- it should be reformed in a way where we don't have to, um, like, you know, grab grandma, grandpa in their golden age --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if they get ready to go and take a fly, um, to some, um, like, um, Montego Bay, or, some place like that, you know, where they never been before and they saved up all their money.  I mean, of course, we know -- we know they're not no terrorists or anything like that, um, but then --
L:  Well, we hope -- yeah, we would hope not.  Yes, I -- I understand.
R:  Yeah, we- well, that's true too -- we would hope not but there's no way of really telling, you know what I mean?  Because, um --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- then the other side of that is -- is -- is a kind of degrading on the other side.  But then we do need that because that stops a whole lot of peoples from getting, you know, hurt.
L:  Right.
R:  You know what I mean?  So, I mean, I can't -- I can't really knock that or what have you.  But, however, I would like to try to find some ways to improve it where, you know -- I mean, there's got to be another solution or something or other like that -- other than the solution that we have or we can still use that solution and another solution --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to work, um, with it, um, where peoples can feel still comfortable and, uh, security can still do their job as well.  Um, I was thinking pretty much of finding how, um, the security people feel that work security in the airports -- how do they feel about it?  Um, you know, do they have some type of ideas or what have you, but some changes could be made to make progress a lot better or to make it better than what it is, you know.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Because, you know, those are the peoples that work out there and they put their lives on the line every day because it's not, um, one of your regular jobs that --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- y- you know, because you don't know what you're getting yourself -- you don't know what's coming through.
L:  Exactly, sure.
R:  Yeah.  You --
L:  No, understood.  I agree with you.  Uh, uh, the only thing I could probably add to that is in the recent months that I have flown you will run into, uh, situations where, uh, -- as you said, grandma and grandpa --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it amazes me -- and that's one reason I said it -- it amazes me how these security people seem to check exactly the opposite of what I would suspect they should check.  It just seems, uh -- I mean, we can't stereotype people, but, uh, I have seen some checking that is just outrageous whereas I have seen some things go through the gates that I just am appalled by, that I just don't understand why they weren't even looked at twice.  So, uh, there's a l- lot involved there and I don't know, these are s- supposedly professionals that, uh, conduct these things.  I don't know how good their training is, but in my instances I have seen some people that, uh, there is no way I would h- harass, or whatever you want to call it, these individuals, uh, 'cause [LAUGH] like you said, "They're grandma and grandpa" they ain't doing anything to nobody.
R:  No, no they- they- they're not.   Okay.
L:  And, uh, in other aspects --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I've seen people that you'd think they would try to stop and check out and they -- they don't seem to -- they look the other way.  So, I am very leery about how well the airport security actually is to be very honest with you.
R:  Mm.
L:  I -- I believe we were supposed to hire a certain amount of, uh, workers to take care of this after, uh, nine eleven --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, uh, I -- I believe this hiring must be going on, I'm not sure, I haven't seen -- at my local airport I have not seen nothing, uh, totally changed, uh, as far as that goes.  It just seems like there's just more time restraints and, uh, it's real hard to identify but then again being a normal US citizen it's not my job to sit there and identify who might be a terrorist, or, uh, be doing things so ... I just think it's something you've got to look into a heck of a lot more than we have already.  We -- I don't think we've put a heck of a lot of time -- as you said, I believe there's other alternatives and I don't know who's looking into 'em, but I've really not sat back and thought about it all that much.
R:  Well, the people that are doing the security, 'cause I am in security myself --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- um, but, I -- from the years that I have worked as -- as --as -- as -- as, um -- y- y- you can't just work -- I mean, you can go on instincts --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on certain parts and things like that and -- and the- then there's a lot of pressure, I believe -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on the peoples that work security also because they have to constantly look.  You know it's pretty much like a Traffic Controller --
L:  Mm, definitely, yes, r- --
R:  You know, you've got to keep your eye on that screen --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and see what's coming up.  You don't want the plane to crash into another.  Well, you're keeping your eye on, uh, on the scanner to make sure no metals is coming through there and then if there is any kind of what have you -- and they only have what is it, plastic explosives or something other like that that they use --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- that doesn't even show up, so it makes it even much more harder --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know what I mean?
L:  Oh no, I know, it -- it is a difficult job, I'm not denying that --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- at all.  It -- It's just as I said, um, it just seems like they're -- maybe the training or some aspect of it needs to be looked into a little further -- 
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  You know --
R:  -- I -- I -- I agree with that, um, because some kind of subtlety has to be, um -- has to -- when -- when you sure that a person is not bringing nothing on, you know, well you want them to also enjoy their trip and if the -- the -- the -- not to feel like they being threatened when they get on a plane --
L:  Correct.
R:  -- because the where how -- you know, you do your job to approach so, um -- that's a -- a -- a very tricky --
L:  Yes, it is.  It definitely is.  
R:  Uh, um -- 
L:  My- --
R:  -- tricky part there, you know?
L:  Right.  My experience -- I was a Military Police Officer some years ago, uh, and I did AWOL escorts throughout the United States, meaning riding prisoners on commercial jet airliners.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, I did have to carry a weapon on the plane.  I had three ways of doing it.  One was, uh, giving the loaded weapon to the pilot even, at that time, okay? R:  Right.
L:  Or keeping my weapon without the ammunition, okay?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or, uh, what was the third alternative?  I have to -- it throws me right at the moment, but I'll always remember going onto that plane 'cause they would always board the normal -- oh, well, the regular passengers first and then they'd board us last --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- into the back rows, um ... Even at that time -- this is before [NOISE] all this occurred, it just seems to me that there was nobody really -- all they wanted to do is get to their destinations --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it didn't seem like a big deal to anyone --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- as far as that goes and, uh, I know that's no answer -- that's -- it's just something that I feel and, uh, I just think training's got to be more extensive and screening of the people has to be --
R:  [COUGH]
L: -- a little more extensive.
R:  Excuse me.  I, um -- you know the point that you was making about that -- I, um, I never, um -- how would you say that?  I -- I just -- well, just regular security.
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay, um, I too carry, all right?  Um, I'm not working right now 'cause my wife was sick.  She had a +aneurysm problem.
L:  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
R:  Yeah, but she's coming along pretty well.
L:  That's good.
R:  [COUGH] But my thing a- about that kind of, um, thing -- I watched it on the TV  They, um -- they had, um, um, a program that was on the movies and, um, it had to do with a- about putting prisoners and stuff on there.  If you were, you know, like, with security-wise, I think, and you've dealt also with other people being on there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  My answer is, if you're not sure of anything is to put 'em all to sleep.
L:  Put 'em all to sleep?
R:  Put 'em all asleep.  Every last one of 'em.  Knock 'em out.  But, however, I would go and I would check to make sure that the doctor that was putting 'em out, okay, for that particular time, or what have you, is, you know, he's one of us, okay?
L:  Uh-huh, okay.
R:  Or what have you, all right.  Now, the -- they'll still carry a weapon or whatever.  It will still be the same procedure because you never know, there's something can go b- -- something can go wrong with that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, putting 'em out as you would know of -- yeah, I -- I would say that.
L:  Okay.
R:  That way the other, um, civilians that would be on the plane won't have to really -- it -- it would cut down the risk.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  [COUGH] If they make it where they'll have one bad he- hell of a headache when they wake up, but they'll be all right.
L:  Correct, correct.
R:  You understand what I'm saying?
L:  Yes, I do understand.
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  Sure, it sounds like a feasible thing that would have to be looked into a lot --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because then you have a lot of health risks as far as that goes.  Some people just can't --
R:  It would cut down prob- -- it would cut down the probability of anything going wrong on that plane.
L: Well, right --
R:  You know?
L:  -- any time you instill fear in someone ...
