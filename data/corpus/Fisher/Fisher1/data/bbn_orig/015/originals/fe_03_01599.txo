L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  How ya doing?
R:  Great.
L:  So, what do ya think of the security?
R:  The airport security?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, I haven't been through the airport since, uh, a little bit after September eleventh, but, uh, I think it does some good, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I think it's good that, um, [NOISE] they're carrying guns in the cockpit now.
R:  Uh, yeah, hopefully that will deter some stuff.
L:  [NOISE] I guess.
R:  Yes, hopefully --
L:  I guess it'll help with a bomb or something.
R:  Uh, yeah, hopefully they would find that stuff beforehand [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- Ya know, um, I don't know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's all kinda scary to me.
L:  I think they should have more screeners.
R:  Yeah, like I said, I haven't been through the airport for a while.  Actually I was at -- through Christmas time, I guess, but, uh, I don't know.
L:  I haven't been there in a couple of years, but, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, you see it on the news that they're, um, always s- scaring and their people clean out the whole place and ...
R:  Right.  Yeah, it's, uh, I don't know it's a big job, I guess.  You got a lot of people going through there, so --
L:  Yeah, they should limit the bags they got.
R:  Yeah, as long as they send 'em through, uh, I know they send every bag through an x-ray machine now too so, you know.  I don't know if they have bomb, uh, uh -- things to detect bombs in there too or not, I'm not sure.  I would assume so.
L:  I think they do.
R:  Yeah, so, um -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] hopefully they have the technology to take care of all that, I don't know.  I guess I'm assuming they do.
L:  Well, I just think that we weren't prepared for September eleventh anyway.
R:  No, and I don't know that there's any way to prepare for that to be honest with you [LAUGH].
L:  That was crazy.
R:  Yeah, it's hard for us to understand how someone could be that, uh, hateful --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess you'd call it [LAUGH], you know, that would do something like that.
L:  Well, a lot of them people I think that were on there didn't even know, um, they were going to their deaths.
R:  Right, right.  Maybe just one or two of 'em.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, but they seem to do that all the [LAUGH] -- they seem to do that every day over there though, so [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  You know, well that's just how they're brought up, so ...
L:  I guess if the pilot carries a gun then, um, we won't have to worry about it because they could just -- a knife ain't gonna hold up to a gun.
R:  No, unless they have a gun too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, yeah, hopefully it'll work out.
L:  I really don't know how it's gonna work because, um, if they shoot a bullet through the plane it's gonna, um --
R:  [MN] They'd better hit something or else it just -- it, uh, -- the plane goes down.  I know there was one in, uh, Southern California back in -- I think it was a PSA plane back in ninety three or ninety two and that's what happened.  A guy went out --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and he just shot a gun in the plane and the plane just pretty much disintegrated.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, the pressure in the plane probably just ripped it apart.
R:  Mhm, yep, so, yeah, if they're gon- -- if they're gonna shoot somebody with the gun, they -- they -- they'd better hit 'em [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or else they're out of luck anyway.
L:  Know what I think they should do [NOISE]?
R:  What?
L:  Uh, some kind of system in the plane where [NOISE], um, it puts everybody asleep in the pa- -- in the passenger [NOISE] area and, uh, then they wouldn't be able to do anything.
R:  That's kind of a -- I hadn't thought of that.  That would be different.
L:  Something goes on, just put 'em all asleep.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Course the wro- -- if the wrong guy has a gas mask that kinda -- that wouldn't work either, you know.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Yeah.  So, I don't know, it's -- it's truly scary.
L:  Where you from?
R:  I live in Minnesota now.
L:  Oh, I'm from New York.
R:  You?  Oh, really.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You in New York now?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah?  Cool.  Yeah --
L:  I'm fr- --
R:  -- this is k- kind of different this -- uh, what part of New York?
L:  Um, Up State New York.
R:  Up State, yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm right outside of Minneapolis right now, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, um --
L:  Yeah, that was quite the thing when them, uh, Towers -- I was sitting here watching it when it went down.
R:  Is that right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That would be quite -- quite a deal.  I couldn't imagine that.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, it was unbelievable.
R:  Yeah?  
L:  [MN] There was dust and smoke everywhere.
R:  Yeah, it would -- it would've been a tough day --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or it must've been a tough year or two, you know.
L:  People were running all over and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  It was -- it was a fiasco.
R:  Oh, I bet.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's a sad day in history, definitely.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  It's a terrible thing, um --
L:  It's -- it's kinda great that, um, everybody across the country came together though.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Come together to -- to try to bring things back to normality, I guess, but I don't know that we'll ever get back to that --
L:  No.
R:  -- to what we were, um ...
L:  But, um, it's, uh -- it, um, makes us more aware now.  
R:  Right, yeah, it does, I mean people are a little more scared and, uh --
L:  It's just too bad that --
R:  -- you look at things a little differently.
L:  It's just too bad everybody had to d-, um, die like that to, uh, um -- for something like that to happen.
R:  To get here, yeah, I know.  It's sad, it's --
L:  Hopefully it won't happen again.
R:  Right, well, hopefully they're kinda taking care of some of that over there now.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's sad there too, you know [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Especially with Syria now.
R:  Yeah, probably be the same thing there, isn't it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's -- you'd think they'd kind of figure it out eventually that we -- well, we've never went over and actually proved to 'em that we weren't gonna take that kind of stuff, I guess, so --
L:  Right.
R:  Now, I -- I'm thinking that, uh, people over there are, uh, understanding that we -- we won't put up with it, I guess, I don't know.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, but, uh --
L:  Now, we got, uh, the SARS epidemic, um, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Not only terrorists, we got, uh, [NOISE] -- and security reasons, we g- -- now we got SARS.
R:  Yeah, that's kind of a scary thing too --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, you never know if that's some kind of a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- government test gone wrong over there of if it's really a virus or what.
L:  Yeah, I don't even know how to, uh, deal with it.
R:  Yeah, I'm not sure, pretty scary though.
L:  So, I guess that's kinda like a terrorist thing too if they got on a plane and come over here and infected everybody [NOISE].
R:  [LAUGH] That's true because --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it must be -- I was reading yesterday that they had, uh, they just, uh, were talking about three hundred more cases --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- than what they had admitted to before --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so, it must be just running rampant over there in, uh, China and Hong Kong.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  But, yeah, I don't know, it's --
L:  I don't really know too much about that.  I don't know w- how it affects ya, um --
R:  I don't know.  I don't think they've really come down with --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- exactly w- where it's from yet, but --
L:  Huh, [NOISE].
R:  -- so, amazing, but, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know.
L:  It's a crazy world --
R:  So, you do these surveys at all much?  It's the first one I've ever done like this.
L:  This is my second one.
R:  Is that right?
L:  Yesterday was, um -- our topic was, uh, um, baseball --
R:  Oh!.
L:  -- strike, and I don't know anything about baseball.
R:  No?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I love baseball.  I do a lot of baseball with my -- my youngest boy.  We -- a lot of coaching and stuff with the kids.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Pretty interesting.  So, these are kind of all different topics?
L:  Yeah, I think so.
R:  Yeah, weird [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Cool.  I guess you get to talk to people from all over the country --
L:  Yeah, I guess so.
R:  I was kinda surprised, yeah --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Well, how's the weather up there?
L:  Um, it was nice today.
R:  Was it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's been, uh -- well, it's kinda cool here.  Down to forty seven and rainy.
L:  We had that big ice storm here.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  [NOISE] And the -- all the trees came down everywhere.
R:  Oh, is that right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right now?  I mean the last couple of days.
L:  Um, no, last -- oh, 'bout two weeks ago.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Um, we didn't have any power for six days.
R:  Ah, that's no fun.
L:  [LAUGH] No.
R:  Ya get kinda cold [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH] Yeah.  Stuff happens.  You guys have snow there -- you usually don't have snow this late do you?
L:  No.
R:  No.
L:  No.
R:  So --
L:  But --
R:  -- yeah, so ...
L:  But, anyway, the planes go right over our house, so th- that's like a -- a taxi way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, hopefully, nothing ever happens here because when they leave Surgess[?] airport --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they fly just -- I was talking to a friend that's, um, a pilot --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he said that there's, um, um, air roads --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and as soon as they leave the airport they get in this -- this road kind of thing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they go right over our house.  You could see 'em all day long flying over.
R:  Is that right?  Pretty high up though?
L:  Yeah, real high.
R:  Yeah, but it's still scary, you know.
L:  Yeah, you just never know what's -- what's gonna happen.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  But of course I don't fly, so --
R:  You don't fly?
L:  Not any more.  I used to, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- once in a while, but we, uh --
R:  I enjoy it, but it's --
L:  I guess if I don't fly I ain't gonna worry about it, right?
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- especially if ya -- I mean, if ya gotta fly out of New York City or anything like that, those -- the big hubs is it seems like where ...
