R:  Hi, my name is Roz.
L:  Hi, I'm Lisa.
R:  Hi.
L:  How are you?  Where are you?
R:  I'm living in Iowa, and you?
L:  I'm in Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  All right, this is the second time I've gotten this topic and I know absolutely nothing about it.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  So, if you know anything about, please feel free to tell me [LAUGH].
R:  Okay, actually this is my first time except yesterday where I got a call where the other person hung up right away so I was, um --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- on hold for ten minutes but ...  Actually, I don't honestly know a lot about it because I don't really follow major sports either.  I mean I tend to think that, you know, ours is a culture that values sports a little bit too highly but [LAUGH] I can't really say I know that much about their grievances or anything like that 'cause I really don't follow sports news or anything like that.
L:  Yeah, I -- [SIGH] I keep hoping I get a different topic, um -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I just don't know anything about this.  Um --
R:  Yeah, I seem to have a whole -- a very strong opinion, I mean, yeah, it's hard to feel too much sympathy for 'em but I honestly don't know if -- I mean, maybe they're justified I don't really know.
L:  Well, that's essentially how I feel, like, I -- I don't know if they're justified or not but I have a hard time feeling sympathetic for someone who works, you know, one out of every three days and -- and makes millions of dollars.  Um --
R:  Yeah, I mean -- yeah.
L:  Like I [MN] I just don't feel sympathetic for them, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, I mean, I tend to feel, I mean, along the same lines but, I mean, I can't really say, I mean, if it's just a pure we don't think we're making enough money thing, I mean, I tend -- tend to think well, if you're really that successful -- I mean, like the people at the bottom of the line, yeah -- you know, people who aren't getting all the endorsement contracts and all the other things that they get on the side just because of their fame, I mean, I have no idea what the regular joe at the bottom makes but the people who are against like, you know, salary caps and things like that of millions of dollars and I'm thinking, you know, the cities are that they still playing and they're funding these stadiums and everything like that but, you know --
L:  Well, that's the part that really gets me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is why should the tax payers pay for the stadium if --
R:  Yeah, I -- I --
L:  -- if these football teams and -- and baseball teams and basketball teams have enough money to pay employ- -- play players [MN] pay players millions of dollars, you know --
R:  Yeah, exactly, I mean, you'd think that the taxpayer should haven't to be able to pick up things like that.  I mean, granted that, you know, they are going to be experiencing more business and things like that but for Joe -- most taxpayers, I mean, it doesn't really matter that much to them and, I mean, maybe they enjoy the events but they're essentially a captive audience --
L:  I'd take my tax money over [LAUGH] a football game any time.
R:  Yeah, well, I mean, you know, honestly like I live in Iowa and, you know, we don't have any major sports teams or anything but we have just as many sports fans, they enjoy things just as much and they don't have to pay for it [LAUGH] you know, so they just watch on television --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  Well, I mean, part of -- uh, part of the problem I have -- well, part of the problem I have with this question is I don't know anything about sports --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but the other problem I have is I think that the salary cap thing is working incredibly differently in the different sports.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  Um, like I know -- I know -- I know so very little about this --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- in football there are like -- I don't think they have salary caps per se, I think what they have is that if you spend more than x amount of money on player salaries --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then you have to pay some like tax to the NFL.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And I think there are a couple of teams that do that because it's worth it to them, um, because they're, you know, the really, really big teams.  Um, but most teams don't.  But then like in baseball it's just -- I think it's like a flat cap --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that you can't spend more than x amount of money.  Uh, the other thing I don't know is I know -- I remember reading way back when how much money the lowest played -- lowest paid player in baseball made and it was enormous.  It was huge.
R:  Yeah, still, I mean, if you're in the major league then you're pretty much sitting on money --
L:  Right.
R:  -- anyway.
L:  But I'm not sure that's the same for other team, other sports like football for example.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like I'm not sure that the, like, eighth string quarterback for a football team makes anywhere near as much money as, uh, the guy who sits on the bench for, you know, the baseball team.
R:  Yeah, I honestly can't say -- I mean, you know, one thing I have heard about a little bit is just how, with the salary things and things like that, that the smaller venues simply can't compete.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it becomes a matter of well, you have these really famous teams that are winning and is it because they can afford better player 'cause they have more money to throw at it.  I mean, is that really competition, is that really fair?  I mean, what's the point of playing a sport if essentially, you know, you're treating players like a commodity that you're purchasing and whoever purchases the best people wins.  I mean that se- --
L:  Yeah, that's a good point.
R:  I mean that seems really silly to me that, you know, well, why should I care, [LAUGH] you know, I mean, honestly if it's all a matter of just money and, you know, bringing in your investments and everything like that, I mean, I don't know, I mean [SIGH] --
L:  No, that's a good point.  I mean if the Cowboys can buy the best players every single year and some little team I've never heard of can't afford to buy anyone then it's not really -- you're right, it's not a competition.
R:  Exactly, yeah.
L:  You already know who's going to win, you already know who's going to lose.
R:  Yeah, well, yeah, I mean, whoever has the most money tends to win and I mean, which is, you know, I guess that's the moral of, you know, capital society in general but when it comes to something that's supposed to be competitive and it's supposed to be a game --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when it seems like the game is loaded you're like well it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's, uh -- why -- why would you get that wrapped up in it because I'm -- I honestly think if I was a sports fan I would dislike that in that it's bad for the sport and if the really, really famous people say, "Well, I can make more money going off and doing something else" then, well, great we lose a few people that way but at least that way it has some semblance of fairness.
L:  Yeah.  I guess if -- you know, now that I think about it that way, and it's not something I had thought about before, if I was really a fan it would really frustrate me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If the best teams just bought the best people and no one else really ever had a chance to be the champions.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, if -- if you just said, no -- I don't know just bidding on these people and spending so much money on one or two individuals versus trying to get a good team together or, you know, even the worst buying people because they're more famous names --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and because they're gonna bring in more fans and things like that.  And it just -- I mean, it just seems so silly to me.  I mean, you know, on the one hand, you know, I tend to be very much in favor of workers rights.  I think that, you know, in general, in most industries people should be able to strike and everything like that but when you're talking -- I mean it's just like, you know, if -- you know, movie actors that were -- I mean, not just the people who were being extras and, you know, scrambling to make a living but people who were making millions and millions of dollars a year were striking because of something, you know, I would just like I'd -- too bad for you [LAUGH] you know what I mean?  Honestly --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- it's just --
L:  Well, I guess, you know, I guess my feeling is, like, I would never tell 'em they can't strike --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I certainly think they should have the right to but, I mean, in Philadelphia, for example, we, um, we the Philly's baseball team --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they're actually fairly good.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But the stands are empty, they are empty.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And what it is is that the last time they went on strike people said, "We don't feel sympathetic for you, we're not going to watch this anymore".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so, I guess, I would never say that they shouldn't be able to strike, I mean, certainly go for it, I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I -- it seems to me like it's probably a pretty dumb thing to do.
R:  Yeah, I mean -- I don't know it seems like a lot of times that with -- with stuff like, with strikes, you just wanna slap 'em.  I mean, it's like in the news on a slightly -- you know a little bit of a tangent, I mean they have the American Airlines thing where, you know, the pilots and the mechanics said, you know, they didn't -- weren't going to go on strike because, you know, our business is just going to founder.  And the -- you know, the corporate people said basically, you know, if you guys don't accept our terms, or these terms, then we're gonna declare bankruptcy and everybody's gonna lose.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But then the stewardess' go and say, you know, "Well, too bad we're gonna vote that down".  And I'm just like that's the stupidest thing ever.  I mean, honestly, it's just -- you're just -- it's just self destructive which, I guess, is basically the thing with the baseball strike because if it gets that silly again where games get canceled, I mean the whole business loses [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Yeah, people will lose interest and they'll stop going.
R:  Yeah, I mean it's not like baseball is the biggest sport in the world anymore anyway.  I mean, fifty years ago it was much more important that it is now.  I mean now that you have -- you know, basketball has increased in popularity so much more --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- so has football and hockey now and all those other things and, you know, you have ESPN, ESPN Two, there's a zillion sports to watch now.
L:  Yeah, my parents live in Connecticut, they have the All Yankees All the Time channel though.
R:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my lord.
L:  They play games and they play reruns of games and they --
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  Like it's the -- they literally have the All Yankees All the Time channel.
R:  Wow.
L:  Like I -- I wonder if that's like a regional thing.
R:  I -- I would hope so. [LAUGH]
L:  But, I mean, like I wonder if, you know, if maybe, you know, around New York and Boston is -- is something that --
R:  Yeah, I can see that.
L:  -- is still like it was fifty years ago but in other areas of the country nobody cares anymore or whatever.
R:  Yeah, but you know, honestly, I mean I grew up actually in New Jersey and we live real close to New York and it's like, you know, it's not the way it used to be where it was huge.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I mean, baseball's still important to a certain extent but it's just -- I mean, it's -- it's not like it couldn't be lost, honestly, and a lot of other -- other things, you know, just go by wayside as time goes on so, I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and if honestly the players screw themselves then I guess they have nobody but themselves to blame but [SIGH] I don't know, I mean it's one of the things I don't really know enough about it and I could see probably that, you know, people in management are probably not always fair and -- but I -- I can't really say a whole lot more than [LAUGH] that, I mean it's -- that's purely a subject which I have very little interest [LAUGH] and knowledge in.
L:  I know and I've gotten this subject twice now and I'm, like, "Oh, I don't know anything about this, tell me something -- you know, give a me a topic I can really, like, you know, feel passionately about". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I was so disappointed 'cause -- 'cause yesterday's topic was going to be like nine eleven and I'm like, "Oh, that would have been so much better" and then it was like, oh, no they just hung up on me.  I felt very rejected.
L:  Oh no.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  Well, that's all right, I mean --
L:  Well, you know ...
