R:  Hi, my name's [inaudible] 
L:  Hello, my name is Colleen.  What do you think about the strike situation?
R:  I think it's kinda, ah, overrated to me.  'Cause it's like, they think they need more money than what everyone else has. 
L:  I know, I know.  I have a problem with that also, um, I mean, sometimes I think, how much money do you need?
R:  Yeah.
L:  The rest of us are --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just everyday people and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I guess can't imagine that the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- salaries that they want is, is just overblown, I think.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I think it's up to a point to where, ah, they're just trying to get publicity out of it, trying to get more money coming into the teams.
L:  That could very well be.  Do you have a problem with it because it gets difficult for you to go to some of the games and afford the prices? [MN]
R:  Yeah, the prices are out of range --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like, to sit on the floor at a basketball game is, like, two hundred and fifty dollars.  It's, like, so overrated.
L:  That's awful.  And then, if you take a family, it's really impossible to do that, I think.
R:  Well, yes.  And they -- and they're trying to strike on getting more money out of this.
L:  Right, right, right. So, do you, um, are you able to go to many games, or does this, um, leave a bad feeling so that you don't even do that?
R:  Ah, if I go to a game I'm at the very top [LAUGH] in the cheapest seats.
L:  Okay, okay, but you do enjoy, enjoy them?
R:  Ah, yeah.  I enjoy it, but it's just overrated the way they think they can act.
L:  True.  Well, and it always seems that once they have a strike it takes a while for people to forget that and to come back again.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I think so too.  I know we were, here in Minneapolis going to use -- lose -- thought we were going to lose our baseball team --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I felt sorry for some of the older people in the nursing homes who sit and watch those games, every single game.
R:  Right.
L:  But, talking to some of them, they feel too their salaries are plenty high. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Especially for this day and age.  And I'm sure none of them made too much money when they were working.
R:  Right.
L:  So.  Now, do you have a family that you take to any of the games?
R:  Ah, just every once in a while we go.
L:  Oh, okay.  Do you have children that go then too?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.  
R:  You're located in Minneapolis?
L:  Yes, yes, I am.  How about you?
R:  I'm in Dallas.
L:  Oh, you're in Dallas, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, are -- um, so you are a big Cowboy fan?
R:  Yeah.  I was [LAUGH] still they started doing bad.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, gosh, I can't think about anything else about the strike business --
R:  [LAUGH] Yes.
L:  -- except that I don't, don't really approve of it, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I read about their big salaries and think, "Well, [LAUGH] what --"
R:  Yeah, if I could have that.
L:  What are you doing with all this money?"
R:  Right.  Yes.
L:  Is this -- is this your first phone call about the strike business?
R:  It's my second one.
L:  Oh okay, okay.  This is my first one, so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's, ah, kind of interesting, I thought.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Are you, ah, a young person that likes to go to the games, or are you older?
R:  Yeah, I'm pretty young. [LAUGH]
L:  Are you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, you sound, you sound pretty young to me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But.  I, I, ah, -- we are Timberwolves fans here, and so far they -- we only have one player that has a very very high salary, but he is a very good player and doesn't seem --
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I think you're talking about Kevin Garnett?
L:  Yes, yes.  He loves the game, I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I, I'm hoping it doesn't spoil him. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know what I mean? 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Sometimes they start out [NOISE] pretty humble, and then comes the end of that, so...
R:  Right.
L:  I hope that doesn't happen here.  But... [PAUSE]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Now, have -- ah, how is your football team there?  Do they have very high salaries?  I guess I don't know a lot about them.
R:  I mean, like, the Cowboys are like the highest grossing team in the United States right now.
L:  Oh, my gosh, wow.
R:  There's just -- they're supposed to get like a hundred and seventy five million, I think, a season.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  On revenues, that's crazy.
L:  Wow, wow, that's a lot.  Well, we're going through the -- they want a new stadium here, both the football and, and the Twins.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  But -- and now, you know with the war and the economy, we don't hear so much about it anymore, so --
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  Maybe they're gonna put it on the back burner, but people just can't seem to afford that either, we're paying the players so much money, and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- nobody wants their taxes to go up.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, well at least you and I both agree.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know if that's good or not, or if it's better to have somebody to debate -- debate with.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  [NOISE] I mean, I don't know what the other side of the topic could be, because, you know --
L:  Well, I don't, I don't either.  I mean, if -- you know, unless you're one of the, one of the players. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause, I, I would imagine the owners aren't very happy when they go on strike either, to -- you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to talk about it or threaten it.  It's -- it doesn't do them any good either, they're trying to make money, I'm sure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We have a Texan that owns our Vikings here, McCombs.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I don't know if he's gonna keep them here or not, but when they argue about they pay, sometimes I think people just say, well, go some place else, and -- [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  If that's the way you feel.  But they just can't seem to be satisfied for some reason or other.
R:  Yeah.  It just comes down to greed.
L:  Yeah, I think you're right.  I think that's true.  Although some of them, I guess -- I, I, I guess some do a lot for different charities and so forth.  But --
R:  Right.
L:  -- maybe we don't always hear about that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'm sure when there's a strike, there's some of them that don't -- don't want to strike.
R:  Yeah, they just wanna play.
L:  Yep.  So, those are the ones I feel bad for.  Look, we watch, we watch a lot of sports, so we feel bad when they aren't on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's good entertainment for us [MN] we don't go to a lot of games, but we do watch them on television, so...
R:  Yeah.  I think it's a lot more interesting watching it on TV than actually going to the game.
L:  Well, it's -- well, for -- sometimes I think too I get distracted at the games.  I get too busy watching people. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And I don't always catch the plays, and you know, this way they'll have, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- show them over again -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So that helps.  Especially for hockey, I have a hard time keeping tr- 
R:  Yeah, keeping up with the --
L:  Yeah, keeping track of the puck. [LAUGH] But football I understand, I love basketball, and I enjoy baseball, although I think it's -- the game has gotten pretty slow. [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But... so we hope that all the teams will just keep playing.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] It's an American passtime.
L:  Right.  Now does -- do you have -- your wife, does she enjoy sports?
R:  Ah, she's not too much of a fan. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, not too much of a fan, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay, what do you have, boys then, that watch, or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I do too, I have four sons, and they all enjoy sports, so I suppose that's maybe why I do too.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I didn't have much choice when they were growing up. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So.  I didn't keep track of the time, I wonder how we're doing.
R:  Yeah, -- oh, hold on, I can check. [PAUSE] All right, it should be ov-
