L:  Hi.  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Karen.
R:  Uh, my name's Joanna.
L:  Joanna?
R:  Jo.
L:  Oh, Jo.  Okay.  Nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  I'm in the mid west, Indiana.  Not sure what we're supposed to say.  [LAUGH]  About athletes, right?
R:  Uh, uh, first of all I'll let you know I'm not really a sports fan, so, I know very little about sports.
L:  Yeah.  I'm not really a sports fan either.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We- isn't that funny how we got we picked for that?  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm in the mid west, Indiana.  So, I guess, uh, Chicago, NBA.  I'm trying to think of who that would be.  I -- like -- like you said, I watch very little but, uh, I know they said the topic's about if they deserve high salaries.
R:  Mhm, yes.
L:  I have no prob- -- I have no problem with it.
R:  No, neither do I.
L:  I think their -- I think their job's pretty tough.
R:  Yeah, I guess I agree.
L:  [LAUGH] You're a student at the University of Penn?
R:  Yes.
L:  Are you really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm not obviously, in Indiana.  It's just something I found on the Internet.
R:  Okay.
L:  But -- a way to make a little money.  [LAUGH]  I know, um -- this is my second call.  The other one I had a University of Penn student as well.
R:  Okay.
L:  So ... what are you going into?
R:  Pre-med.
L:  Pre-med?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Wow!  Good for you.  I went to Indiana University.
R:  Okay.  For what?
L:  Um, I went for business --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- actually.  So ... and I've been out for ten years. [LAUGH]  Do the math.  I'm thirty --
R:  Yeah, I should be out for ten years.  [LAUGH]
L:  Huh?
R:  Yeah, I just turned thirty.  I should be out -- 
L:  Oh, oh, yeah.  You're about the same age as --
R:  Yeah.  I went back to school.  So ...
L:  I'm thirty three.  Um, yeah, they didn't really say what to say, what to talk about really.  My other phone call, I geared it more what to -- what to talk about, just -- it said something about mention if you think they deserve their high salaries.  [NOISE]  So ...
R:  Well, it's 'cause they're in like, show business, I guess they do.
L:  Yeah.  One thing I always talk about, um -- I have a husband -- I always hope that they save well.  I'd hate to see it all squandered by the time their, you know, athletic career is over.
R:  That's true.
L:  You ever thought about that?  Yeah.  I -- I hope someone teaches 'em how to invest it wisely or something.
R:  Exactly. 
L:  Yeah. [PAUSE] Oh, well.
R:  So, what is the purpose of this call?  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I -- I don't really -- yeah, I don't know what they're gathering.  The way we communicate?  Or are they actually going for actual answers to the question?
R:  Okay.
L:  I don't understand it.  There really wasn't much to it -- they -- they didn't really talk --
R:  Maybe we we're like, uh, being given an interval time to waste until the ten minutes are up or so.
L:  You have to go for ten ...?  Is this your first call that you've done with them?
R:  Oh, I had some type of an answering machine message, but it wasn't clear, it was like the end of the message.  So, I don't really know.  That might've been --
L:  But this is the first one you're actually --
R:  -- something --
L:  -- with another person?
R:  Yes.
L:  I do know you're not to hang up.  They will come on at the end of the ten minutes and tell you.
R:  Oh, God!  Well, I -- I'm actually in the midst of doing laundry.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Oh, you're trying to do laundry in between?  Hey, I am too!  We're doing laundry.  I gotta new baby.  So, we got lots of laund- --
R:  Congratulations.
L:  Yeah.  We got lots of laundry here.  Almost every day I do a load.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Now, are you in, um, a dorm or apartment or ...?
R:  No, I live in an apartment.
L:  Apartment?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Good, yeah.  I -- I remember doing the laundry and the dorm thing, it was -- it's hard.  I felt like you had to be there to watch it so that nobody would go out and steal your laundry.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, we have that here, too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Thieves in the laundry room.  That's t- --
R:  Yeah, I feel the same way.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  So, what's it, Saturday night?  Now, you're in Pennsylvania.  What time do you have there?  Nine or ...?
R:  Actually it's, uh, it's a little bit after ten, about -- almost twenty to ten.
L:  Oh, you're an hour later.  It's only nine here in Indiana.  Yeah, I -- I thought it was something after --
R:  It's actually like ten oh eight, ten oh eight, yeah.
L:  I thought it was something after ten.  But it doesn't matter.  I'm home.  My question's what am I -- what -- what are you doing home on a Saturday night?  Oh, well.
R:  Like I said, laundry.  [LAUGH]
L:  Laundry.
R:  Laundry, studying.
L:  Studying?  Where are we, at the -- this would be, what, the end of the school year, wouldn't it?
R:  It's almost finals.
L:  So, that would -- that's right, you've got exam time, that's not fun.
R:  Exactly!  [LAUGH]
L:  I am so done with school.  I went for so many years.
R:  Oh, yes --
L:  Got my -- m- mast- --
R:  I -- I already have been going for so many years.
L:  Got my masters in business and --
R:  I'm in my sixth year and I've already had enough.
L:  Oh, yeah, it's -- it's hard.  I didn't go straight through for the masters.  I took a little break, went to work as a loan officer for a bank, and then, um, got them to pay for the masters' degree.  That's the way to do it.
R:  That's very, very good.
L:  [LAUGH] That's the way to do it.  Let me tell ya.  Now, um, since we're on the sports topic, let's get back to that.  Let's see.  Indiana University.  So, you've probably heard of Bobby Knight?
R:  I've heard the name, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, he's the one that throws the chairs, has the temper.
R:  But I have no idea what game though.  [LAUGH]  I tell you, I nothing about sport.
L:  Bobby Knight would be -- he would be -- he would be I.U. basketball.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  So, now, huh, they said do the athletes deserve the high salaries?  Sure.  Do the coaches?  Hey, I don't know about him.  He is known for his temper and throwing things, and he got fired actually for -- was it treatment? -- how he treated --
R:  Oh, that's terrible.
L:  -- how he treated the athletes.  Yeah.
R:  Then he shouldn't get a high salary.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Then he does not deserve one, no.  Well, now, he switched colleges and he -- he did not coach his team to a win that year, and I'm not sure the gist of all tha- -- like we said already, we don't keep up with sports that well, but I know he would not accept his salary for a whole year's work because he didn't feel like he, uh, did a good job with his team.  Well, that was pretty impressive when that came out in the news.
R:  Yeah, that is true.  I've never heard of that before.  [LAUGH]
L:  Never hear- --
R:  Even I wouldn't do it.  
L:  Never heard that story?  Mm.  So, what is your team at Pennsylvania called?
R:  [NOISE] I don't know anything about sports. I mean, I'm totally away from sports.
L:  But you have to know what your state -- or you probably know what the state's called.  Like, I.U. were called Hooshers[?].
R:  I don't know.  I've heard people say the word Quakers but I don't know what it refers to.  I mean, I'm so totally away from --
L:  Quakers?
R:  -- that stuff.  I don't know what that is.  I have no idea.
L:  Quakers is like a --
R:  I don't know --
L:  -- a religion.
R:  -- you'll have to get someone else.
L:  You know --
R:  I know as much about sports -- I mean, I know nothing.
L:  Where are you at-- you're not actually from there then?  You just chose --
R:  I'm from New York.
L:  Yeah.  I caught that New York accent!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You just chose Pennsylvania then for the school?  Is it a good school?
R:  No, actually I've lived here since I was eleven.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And I'm thinking of going back to New York.
L:  It's a good me- medicine school?
R:  Uh, as soon as I graduate I plan on opening a practice in New York.
L:  'Cause actually IUs got, um, a fairly good medicine school that it's known for --
R:  Yeah.  NYU.
L:  Who?
R:  NYU has a medical school.
L:  Oh, okay.  No, I was talking about IU, which is Indiana.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  See, again, I'm in the mid west.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, that's all I know.  What's that dinging?
R:  That's my computer.  It has loud music --
L:  [LAUGH] That's great.
R:  -- when it comes on and I hate it 'cause I -- I turn it on at four AM in the morning and --
L:  You must have two --
R:  -- I'm scared people are gonna --
L:  You must have two phone lines?  You're able to be on the computer when the phone call came in?
R:  I -- [NOISE] we'll have to wait 'til this turns off.
L:  Oh.
R:  Although my next door neighbor listens to such loud rap music I don't think they would notice if I was, uh, being killed in here.  Okay, it's off.
L:  I said you're lucky.  It sounds like you have two phone lines.  You were able to answer the phone call from the University of Penn at the same time as the computer's on.
R:  Well, I'm not on the Internet.
L:  Oh, you're not on the Internet.  Okay.
R:  No, I just turned on my computer.
L:  'Cause, I -- you know, I miss more of these phone calls from the University of Penn, friends, whatever, because I'm just so addicted to the Internet, and we only have one phone line and I don't want to pay for a second phone call.
R:  Mhm.  Well, if you have broadband you can also, uh --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  You know, that stuff I know about.  [LAUGH]
L:  Broadbands?
R:  Computers and everything.  That's -- that's definitely like[?], the stuff I know about.
L:  Ok- --
R:  I feel an idiot when people refer to sports.  I know nothing.
L:  But computers you do?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What's this broadband?  Does that have a fee?
R:  Well, um, if you have that you're able to actually be on the Internet at the same time as being on t- -- on, uh, the phone, which is really good.
L:  I know, but there's probably a fee, right?
R:  Oh, yes [LAUGH], absolutely.
L:  That's what I'm trying to avoid.  That's why we don't have two --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's why we don't have two phone lines.
R:  Um, when I was living on campus on I had, uh, my own private line anyway.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I get could more calls.
L:  But there's just so much out there these days.  You ca- -- I mean, we've got the fax machine at home.  You c- -- you could pay for a phone line for the fax --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- the phone, the Internet.  I don't --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- do all that.  Mm, I wish there was more guidelines to this, if we're supposed to strictly talk about sports or -- or what.  [LAUGH]
R:  I have no idea.  The only thing in sports that interests me is [several inaudible words] ass! [LAUGH].
L:  Maybe they're going for women.
R:  I don't know anything about sports.
L:  Uh, maybe they're just seeing, uh, that as a starting place.  I -- you know, like I said, there's no guidelines.  You don't really know what they're looking for.
R:  That's true.
L:  Mm.
R:  Well, it sounds like they're -- they're referring to their salaries.  So, maybe it's like the moral issues of whether or not they deserve it, whether entertainment is something that actually should be paid --
L:  Yeah.  But what are our guidelines?
R:  -- high salaries.
L:  I mean, how --
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- are we only allowed to talk about that or what?
R:  I have no idea.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Operator, if you're listening, um, I kinda don't know how to talk sports!  But, uh ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I, uh, don't know.  I watch a little with my husband, but that's just to keep him company --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- not like I understand what the heck is going on on the TV.  And it's only when we absolutely can't find anything else to watch --
R:  Yeah, my ex boyfriend was a wrestling nut.
L:  -- a last resort.
R:  And I still can't understand it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Who was a wrestling nut?
R:  Uh-huh, my ex boyfriend.
L:  Ex boyfriend.
R:  I still can't understand it.
L:  Mm.
R:  He could [MN] -- he w- he w- -- it was on the Internet.  He could sit on the Internet and watch the wrestling stuff all day, and I mean all day, like thirteen hours a day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't get it.
L:  Wrestle mania.
R:  I don't get it.
L:  I -- I -- I -- I flip through channels and I'll sit there for two minutes and go, okay, this is boring, next channel.
R:  [LAUGH] [MN] Yeah, so Chris and I bought him this, um, old time greatest hits wrestling tape -- whatever the hell [LAUGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  But if that's the way guys killing each other [LAUGH] under fake pretenses.
L:  Mm.
R:  That's what I think it is.  I don't even think it's real.
L:  Hey, what's the weather out there in Pennsylvania?
R:  Actually it's about sixty and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I think it's clear.  Last time I was out it was nice.
L:  That's about the same as today.  It was a beautiful day here in Indiana.
R:  The first day without rain.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, it wasn't raining or windy today.
L:  But it was very nice.
R:  It was pretty nice.
L:  A wel- welcome change because we had a very cold winter.  [LIPSMACK] So, we'll get --
R:  Well, they can't say we didn't have enough rain.
L:  We're getting ready to go out to, um --
R:  Yeah, we've had a lot of rain.
L:  We're gonna take a trip to Las Vegas
