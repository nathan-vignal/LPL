L:  Hi.
R:  Uh, my name is Anne.
L:  [PAUSE] Hi, my name is Sherry.
R:  Carrie?  And what state are you from?
L:  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, I'm from, uh, Colorado.
L:  Oh, hi!
R:  Yeah.  So, we're talking about athletes?  About the salaries that ...?
L:  Yes.
R:  Well, I th- from my opinion, I think they're overpaid.
L:  You think they're overpaid?  [LAUGH]
R:  Ahah, I do.  I don't know how you feel.
L:  I think that -- I think that -- I think they're getting the salary they deserve especially since they, um, experience so much injury, you know?
R:  Well, I ...
L:  I think they're overrated.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But I don't think they're overpaid.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I -- I mean, you know, they stress so much on entertainment, you know?  I mean --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- but they should be putting into something else.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, like something -- help sick children or, you know, um, teachers, you know, they don't get much praise or anything.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, they don't make a lot of money but -- and -- of course though, well, I like the ball players 'cause --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I -- I like sport.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, but I --
L:  I like sports too but, um, I just think that it's just, um ... you know, like bodyguards and all -- and then they have, um  like, they do all of the ads and everything like that.
R:  Well, d- -- yeah.
L:  I think they just -- I think they just get, like, too much attention.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's right.  I see it that way.  They're on ads and -- my gosh, you know -- and they're always on the TV for something.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Yes.  They're --
L:  And then -- and then the other thing is that they, um [LIPSMACK] [PAUSE] they -- like when they get injured and everything they still continue to get paid, even though they're not playing.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]  That's, like, gee, that's right.  And sometimes they're off for quite a while.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  Which, you know, most, uh [inaudible] people don't get that.
L:  Right.
R:  But, I mean ... and then -- that's [MN] -- well that's ... then they're overrated I think.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Too much, too much.  They're in the limelight.
L:  I think  yeah.  And then if they do something bad, you know --
R:  Oh, yes!
L:  Oh, boy, you get to hear about for months.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, yes!  But -- and, I mean, they get in so much trouble.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, a lot of --
L:  Yeah.  If they would donate some of their money that they make, like, you know, to different schools or, you know, help children that might -- that might be in trouble or something, yeah, I think that would be a good thing.
R:  W- wh- --
L:  But I don't think a lot of them do that.  I think very few of them do that.
R:  Oh, is that right?  Yes, that would be nice if they could, if they would donate, you know?  But sometimes I guess they have so much [LAUGH] they don't know what to do with it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  They've just -- I mean, if you were earning that much --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- wh- what would you do with it?  I wouldn't know where to begin.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And then that puts them in more mischief.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's a lot of money.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  But a lot of them do good causes, they -- I mean, they do for the, uh, the -- the hospital, the children's hospitals.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they, you know, for Christmas and all they go visit 'em and bring 'em gifts and -- different occasions.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So they do good there.
L:  Yeah.  I think -- but I -- I used to always think that that was because they was doing that, like, as a tax write off.
R:  Oh, yeah!
L:  And so [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, charity and everything, so that they wouldn't have to pay so much taxes.
R:  That's true.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.  Because the charities could sure use it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  And all the, uh, you know, disabled children and these poor or sick children, you know, of places for 'em to stay and be trained and all that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, our children are important.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  If you treat 'em good and take care of them they may grow up to be athletes.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, I would like to see 'em take some of their money and do more with the elderly 'cause, you know, when my father was sick we found out that the prescription -- a lot of health payers don't cover them.  So --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it would be nice if they would do something to help the elderly and everything because they didn't lived a long time and everything, but they -- they suffered so much because people are always taking advantage of them because they can't do as much as they used to.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know?  So, that would be nice if they would do something to help them.
R:  O- oh, yes, the elderly.  I have -- I'm with you there because the elderly need help.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, there's so many living on practically nothing.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, are they still?  That I don't know.  But I do think that some of them do.  I know I hear in Colorado --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, they donate a lot and do a lot for the, uh -- you know, the homeless and the -- you know, when they feed the people on, uh, Thanksgiving and all that, they donate a lot.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So, they do help 'em there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I think that's a good cause.
L:  Yeah, that is.
R:  [MN] as far as they're professional people, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I like to watch 'em.
L:  Okay.  So what's your favorite sport?
R:  My favorite sport is, uh, football.
L:  Oh, football?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I like the footb- -- I like football a lot.
R:  And I like baseball.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't care --
L:  It's long. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't care for, uh, the basketball.
L:  No.
R:  No.  And I like hockey.
L:  Mhm.  Well, I went to my first basketball game this year and I was surprised how the people scream and carry on when the athletes are coming out.
R:  I know!
L:  And I was, like, oh, my God, and these people they're jumping up and screaming and --
R:  Yeah, I know!
L:  -- like they're gonna lose their mind.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes!  And, oh, and the fans they're crazy!
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, we have fans here in Colorado -- oh, I mean, they're tremendous fans.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, you watch the game and you see this, or you go there, all of the stadium is full.
L:  [COUGH] Mhm.
R:  Full.  But, uh, baseball I like.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- but I like football really.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [MN]
L:  I think I like football more than anything.
R:  Yeah.  But I --
L:  I just don't know if I would buy a ticket to go to a football games 'cause the weather is usually cold.
R:  That's right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No.
L:  So, I don't like being cold.
R:  No.
L:  You know?
R:  Well, I never go to the stadium.  I watch 'em on TV.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, it's too cold here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, oh, here oh, the traffic and it's just real terrible.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause, you know, they just built that new stadium.  So, it's beautiful.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, 'cause we're the --
L:  And they're building the new stadium for the -- for the Eagles.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, we're the Broncos.
L:  Oh, okay.  Oh, no, we don't like you!  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you don't like -- oh, no!  How come?
L:  Di- -- didn't ya all win the world series?
R:  Yes.
L:  I mean, not the world series, I mean, the --
R:  The super bowl?
L:  -- the super bowl.
R:  Yes.
L:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  We was hoping the Eagles would get in on that one this year.
R:  Oh, I know, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  G- oh, that was too bad!  There ya go -- they'll -- they'll make it one day.
L:  No.  I really like the Bronco team actually, but it was tough when it came down to the Eagles and the Broncos and I was, like, well, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, when it comes to -- when they're playing and everything and I'm, like --
R:  Yeah.
L: -- I kind of like that team.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And, of course, uh, hockey -- the Everlads I like.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you have that?
L:  Hockey, yeah, we have the, uh, Philadelphia Flyers.
R:  Oh, I see!
L:  Mhm.
R:  I see, yes.  But, I mean, like, you may -- you've heard of John Elway, you know, a Bronco guy?  He's retired.  He does an awful lot --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for, oh, all kind of organizations.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I mean, he's earned a lot of money but he -- he spends it well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he helps the kids 'cause he has --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- children of his own and, you know?  But I'm like you, I'm hoping they do something for us poor old people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, see, I'm a kind of elderly lady.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I'm eighty two years old.
L:  Oh, well, God bless you!
R:  [LAUGH] I know -- I know.  But I -- I manage all right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  I've --
L:  Well, I'm -- I'm -- I'm forty one.
R:  Oh, good!
L:  And, um, I have two teenagers.
R:  Uh-huh.
L: But, um, they -- they -- they make me feel old.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, hey, tell me about that!  Well, especially if you're around 'em in a group or something, I mean, you feel so old.
L:  And I took them to their first, um -- to their first basketball game here --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they just went crazy and then they just wanted to spend, spend, spend money, and I said, "You're making these people rich".  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well, I mean, uh, the -- but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I -- if it wasn't for sports -- I think it's great they have that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because a lot of people are interested and it keeps people out of mischief.  They go to the game --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, they -- then they're [inaudible] to praise them on, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  They get lots of praise.
L:  And they give away a lot of stuff at the games when you go.
R:  Yes, they do.  Yes, they do.  Like I said --
L:  So, it makes it ex- -- it makes it exciting because I thought it was gonna be kinda boring --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- watching the game.  But it's -- it's -- actually when you're there it's -- it's really fun, you know?
R:  Well, I really think they participate in more things that we never hear about.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  I do, yes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The only reason I know, they do the hospitals here because the children's hospital all over Christmas and holidays --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- oh, they go see all the kids and bring 'em gifts and --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Talk to 'em and sign autographs and all that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I always think --
L:  And some of the -- some of the, um, athletes do have, like, their own charity organizations --
R:  Yes, they do.
L: -- where they try to help --
R:  Yes, they do. 
L: -- people.
R:  Because you- --
L:  But I was just saying that -- I was -- I thought maybe, like, they should spend more of their money, you know, towards -- that they do a lot for the children, but you -- I -- you don't hear them saying a lot about the elderly.
R:  That's what I'm looking --
L:  And I was -- and I was concerned about that just --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- because of what we went through l- recently.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.  But me, I'm -- I -- I could use a little help too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I mean, I think they should because, you know, the elderly -- after all, everybody's gonna get old.
L:  Right.
R:  And they have to realize that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, t- try to help.
