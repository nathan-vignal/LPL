R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  How you doing?
L:  My name's Lynn.
R:  My name is Si.
L:  Hi, Si.  Where are you calling from?
R:  Philadelphia.
L:  Philadelphia?  I'm in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
R:  Okay, all right.
L:  Okay.  Uh, what do you think about this subject [LAUGH]?
R:  Oh, I -- I -- I hate it when they strike number one.  I -- you know, I don't care if it's baseball or football or whatever it is, especially baseball, these guys make a lot of money.  They make, you know, more money in one day than I make in, you know, three or four years in some cases.  And then they strike and, you know, som- -- you know, the sports is something that people look -- look to to unwind, sometimes sports can save somebody's life, you know, people look forward -- especially, uh, if, uh, season ticket holders and then they go on strike, you know, it -- it's like it's right down the drain and makes what you have worthless, you know.  And I -- I just don't think that they should do that.  A lot -- a lot of players, uh, and the various sports da- -- you know it becomes all about money and not the sport.  So, it -- it definitely bothers me.
L:  Okay, I agree with you one hundred percent so now we better have some pros and cons here [LAUGH].
R:  Oh yeah, no problem, we can -- we can --
L:  We got about nine minutes to go [LAUGH].
R:  What is tha- -- what do -- do you recall -- we- well, which sport do you -- do you generally like to watch?
L:  Uh, we used to watch baseball.  We still watch baseball because our -- our nephew happens to be the -- the -- with the Cleveland Indians.
R:  Okay. [NOISE]
L:  So, we -- we do watch sport somewhat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, as far as the strikes they -- they hurt baseball bad.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  People that had been watching faithfully for years and years and years haven't watched a ball game since.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it -- it just -- it drove a lot of people out of the [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, it did.  I think it's still -- it's still affecting them today.
L:  Yeah, it still is affecting them today and there are people that will never go back to watching it --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- because they got so ticked off at that point in time.
R:  Definitely.
L:  And -- and you can't blame 'em.
R:  You can't blame 'em.
L:  But, you know, and then you've got an up and coming generation of kids and -- and they look up to these guys --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and then they --
R:  And we're sending out the wrong message too.  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you -- you start having all these strikes and the kids, you know, they forget about the love of the game --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they -- and they -- they figure, "Well, okay, well I just wanna do this, you know, for money" and then a- -- the next thing you know a lot of kids is no- -- is, um, aren't thinking about education so much they're -- they're looking at it as a -- and although ther- -- it is a lot of kids that are -- that are poor that are coming up in sports and that's -- that's their meal ticket, I just think it's -- in the long run it just affects the game very badly.
L:  Yeah, it does but -- and then a lot of people overlook the fact that what these guys give back to the community, they give back huge.  They give back a percentage of their salaries to charities and to the community --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the things that they for free for kids, you know, people do tend to overlook that because there is a whole lot of that done.
R:  Oh, no question.
L:  You know, I don't think the general public even begins to realize --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- how much these guys give back.
R:  I think it should be a clause, like in a contract, that if you make -- just like you have the capped clause -- I think there should be a clause if you make over a certain amount of money, and make it lower enough where it can represent most of the players, you can't strike. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, they -- they -- those guys give back between ten and fifteen percent of their income.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which, you know, that's a big hunk out of some of those incomes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, so people do tend to overlook that.
R:  Mhm.  Oh, --
L:  And a lot of times it's not really these guys that are going on strike that's caused it, it -- you better look at some of these owners.  Some of the things the owners have done.
R:  That's true, that is true.
L:  And you really can't blame these guys for getting ticked off at what some of these owners have done.
R:  Oh yeah, no question about it but still ...
L:  So, sometimes they're put right in the middle of something that, you know, they have no control over.
R:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, that could be true, that could be true.
L:  And then the public, you know, the public takes it out on the players which is --
R:  But, you know -- you know who else it hurts though?  For instance, um, like, for instance, the average -- I -- I had found out a few years ago and maybe it's a little higher now but I found out that the average MBA, like MBA, doesn't make millions.  The average MBA player between, like, ninety and a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
L:  That's true.
R:  So, s -- so say you're like a, you know, multi millionaire, you know, and you're among the crews -- amon- among the bunch of people that wanna strike, you know, and you can afford -- you can afford to be out of work for a year because, you know, you're getting paid thirty millions a year.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But what about the guy that's making a hundred thousand dollars a year, he has to go a year without money.  He -- he's hurting.  He's on the same team with you but -- but he's hurting and you're fine.
L:  The only thing the strike did that was good is it called major attention to the minor leagues.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we're talking about guys that -- I mean there was years my nephew made five or six thousand dollars a year.
R:  How much?
L:  Five to six thousand dollars a year.
R:  Really?  And they make that little --
L:  I mean they got their tra- -- oh, they make very little money.  They get, you know --
R:  I thought they made at least like maybe thirty thousand dollars a year.
L:  No, no, they start out with next to nothing [LAUGH].
R:  Really?
L:  [MN] It makes -- I mean they have to have support from their families and they're -- I mean they don't -- they -- they -- the -- the team picks up their hotel and their food and -- and all of that kind of stuff but -- and they only play x amount of games so, you know, you've gotta figure they're not -- they're not on contract working year round like other players are.
R:  I didn't know that.  I thought that these -- I thought they made like at least, you know --
L:  No, not all of them. [LAUGH]
R:  Really?
L:  No.
R:  So -- so -- so when -- so when there's -- when there's, uh, a strike in the major league that means the minor leagues has to strike too?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, no?
L:  No, no, no, I said it called attention to the minor leagues because people did not have ball games to go other than that of the minor league.
R:  Oh, I see -- I see -- I see what you're saying, I see what you're saying, okay.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, they would go to the minor league games.
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  Which -- we- -- they call attention to more of them and people got to see more of what was up and coming.
L:  Yeah.  Definitely.  I -- I -- I know I haven't watched, uh, many minor -- well, actually, what am I saying, many, I haven't seen any minor league 'cause -- uh, first of all in the Philadelphia -- and the -- our minor league team doesn't play in Philadelphia, first of all.  So, uh --
R:  Minor league teams are great.  
L:  Yeah.  I know we were just up in, uh, Buffalo, New York and went to the minor league team, uh, place there and they had a beautiful stadium [LAUGH], oh, it was gorgeous.
R:  And then --
L:  We have one for the twins right here in Fort Wayne.  But it, you know, thank god they didn't go out on strike but it's, you know, that the- -- [MN] it's just -- it affects just some -- it affects advertising --
R:  Mhm, oh yeah, definitely.
L:  It affects the people that work that in the stadium --
R:  Mhm, oh yes.
L:  -- it affects the community because people come from out of town to see their favorite teams --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they have to stay in motels, they have to eat in restaurants, they shop in malls, the -- the -- the total span of who it affects is unreal.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it affects the families of these people because, hey, the people aren't coming in so they get laid off of work.  It's -- you know, it's just like any other business except it's really on a -- on a much bigger scale 'cause it's nationwide.
R:  Yeah, I guess I never thought about it that way.  You know, I'm thinking of just the players but, yeah, you're right it does affect the businesses as well.
L:  It affects a lot of people.
R:  Yeah, you -- you -- it might be like a guy that -- that depends on a particular season because he's open for that particular season for that particular reason, now there's a strike and he can't make -- yeah, that's right.
L:  Yep.
R:  That is right.  [MN] And then I guess it causes ticket prices to go up too --
L:  Well, ticket prices --
R:  -- when -- when the strike --
L:  -- as far as I'm concerned are ridiculous anyway but --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  -- you know, we don't have to pay -- we're lucky we don't have to pay for 'em but [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, [MN] uh, it's -- it's, uh, an average family can't afford to go to a game.
R:  Tell me about it.  Tell me about.
L:  You take four people to a game and, you know, forty or fifty dollars a ticket --
R:  You really think they --
L:  -- it depends upon who --
R:  -- really need that -- that money or do you think they -- they -- they raised the prices --
L:  I think some of the stadiums do.
R:  -- just for profit.
L:  Some of the stadiums do.  Some of the stadiums, uh, you're talking like the New York Yankees, can you imagine --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the upkeep, the security, uh, what it costs to keep that stadium up and running, uh, uh, it -- you know, it's just -- people don't think about, you know, the grass --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, there's a lot of upkeep.
R:  Well, you're very knowledgeable -- wow, [LAUGH] you could be in that business.
L:  But -- well, like I said, we've got a family member that is in the business [LAUGH].
R:  So -- so -- so, you get the -- the --
L:  I mean both phone calls I --
R:  -- inside scoop into --
L:  -- this is my -- this is just -- this is my second phone call.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, I've -- have you had any before yet?
R:  Oh, yeah.  This is -- I think this is my, I think, third phone call.
L:  Okay.  They're pretty cool.  I did- -- I didn't know how I'd like it or not but, boy -- and everyone of 'em -- so far both of them kind of like around sports so --
R:  Well, you know, you get to -- you get to talk to some very nice people and -- and in my -- my case in this -- in this case, uh, you get an education.  You know, you -- you caused me to think about some things, uh, concerning the strike that I'd never thought about it.  I always thought about the players but never -- I never really thought about, uh, the businesses that it affects and how it affects people -- and how it affects people on the -- on the personal levels.
L:  Well -- and do you ever stop to think that this could be, uh, the end of a player's career.
R:  Yeah.
L:  This could've been his very hottest year and because of something that occurred and they had no pre- -- no choice but to strike, or whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, he may -- he might have been another Babe Ruth.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He might've been --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, we don't know.  
R:  That's right.
L:  Or he might have been nothing, he might have busted out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But there's -- there's a whole year out of these guys careers and their careers are not that long.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  You know, somebody says, "Oh, well they made a million and a half year" well, if they have a total debilitating injury --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a million and a half for one year of play, which this happens --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  -- for an injury and be gone, that's not a lot of money.
R:  Mhm.  I know --
L:  If that's all they play and all they make they can't live on that for the rest of their lives.
R:  Then they've got mortgages.
L:  That's right.
R:  And children to take [LAUGH] care of, yeah.
L:  And it's a career that they've worked years to get to.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- and some of them weren't smart enough to go ahead and finish their college education.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  So, here they are, they don't have a college degree to fall back on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and things like that.
R:  Yeah.
