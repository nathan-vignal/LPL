R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Stephanie.
L:  Hi, I'm Nicole.
R:  So we're supposed to talk about September eleventh?
L:  Um, I've been more hesitant to take airplanes.
R:  Okay.  So have you travelled at all?
L:  No, I haven't travelled since. [NOISE]
R:  Um, for me the same thing.  I don't -- I've travelled some but I don't want to travel too far or, you know, I would just take little short trips that are about maybe a hour away for the flight time or something.
L:  Yeah, I've been travelling more, like, by car and everything.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Um.
L:  I guess I'm more aware of what's going on. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I tune into the news more.
R:  Yeah.  Just to see what the latest is happening in the world and everything. [PAUSE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um. [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE] So I've been, like, I just watch the news a lot more now just to make sure what's going on.
R:  Mhm, yes.  I think I -- I also, um, read the newspaper more just to read about things and, you know, also, like, look on line on the different news --
L:  Yeah, I look on line all the news and stuff.
R:  Yeah.  Just to keep informed especially, like, put the war just to see all the different things that are happening every day and stuff.
L:  Yeah, I guess, I'm --
R:  I -- I know it's -- 
L:  It's just that I seem more -- a lot more aware now after that.  It's just like wake up call, you've got to really look now what's going on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because I didn't even -- like, I don't think I even knew there was risk at that time until it was, like, oh, you know.
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  And then they said that, like, some -- like, I don't know who, but I think some people already had, like, a feeling it was go- something was going to happen, they just didn't know where.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Beforehand and I didn't even -- you know, like, now they give you the alerts on the TV? 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like, they could -- I don't know if they did that or not but I didn't even know that they had one.
R:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, now with the war, you know, it will be, like, elevated or high risk or whatever on terrorism.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just scary 'cause you know they did it the one time so you never know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, who's going to try again.
R:  You don't know when or where.
L:  It's really weird because, I mean, we have pretty much a very -- I think a very good, you know, government awareness system.  Like, you know, we know basically what's going on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they didn't even know where they were going to hit, you know, just to try to stop anything or warn the people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm thinking most people that are affected by the planes and stuff, like, most people were scared to go on a plane again.
R:  Mhm, and they --
L:  But, I think -- 
R:  Oh, go ahead.
L:  I'm sorry.  They also, like, made the security at the airports a lot better.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, all the extra stuff.
R:  Well -- well, I mean, I've travelled some since September eleventh but personally I don't think that the security in airports is that much safer.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, I mean, they're slowly getting on it but sometimes, you know, it depends on the people I guess.  And I know that they tried to, you know, have more [SIGH] workers that are, you know, look out for things and stuff but sometimes they just don't feel that they look thoroughly. [LAUGH] But --
L:  Yeah, and you've got to be scared about the trains and stuff too.  It's not just, like, that's the only time they could hit you is the airplanes.
R:  Yeah, yeah, anything actually where, like, there's a lot of people I think -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- could be targets.
L:  Yeah, because I live in Philadelphia, so, like, they -- I remember they, um, like, had them all zoned off and put new security in, like, the -- not the statue -- what was it called, the Liberty Bell and stuff.
R:  Mhm, yeah, but historical sites and stuff.  [PAUSE] And I think also I always had second thoughts about visiting New York because I always wanted to go visit.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I don't know.
L:  Yeah, I did too. I always wanted to go and I never got a chance to but now I'm kinda like -- I mean, I know it's, like, most likely not going to happen there again, but -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you never know.
R:  But still. [COUGH]
L:  Just 'cause, like, the memories are still there for everybody.
R:  Mhm, or -- and when they said that, you know, the -- some of the terrorists actually lived over there, so, um, -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  This is really scary to know that, like, the people are just, like, plotting against us like that.
R:  Mhm, and I think, like, when the war started, um, for me I live over in the San Francisco area.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, you know, there's a lot of historical sites and I cross a bridge every day to go to work and -- 
L:  Oh, really?  And that's another thing like bridges and stuff they said 'cause so many people are, you know, on them at any time.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I was also thinking, like, not the World Trade Centre, but, um, what else is there in New York?  There's other -- there's a whole bunch of big stuff in New York with all the people crowded.
R:  Yeah, there's just like Time Square.
L:  Yeah, it must be.  That's such a big city like everybody's there.
R:  Yeah, [PAUSE] and then they also said, like, they -- that the malls or apartments complexes would be -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- could be targets or something.  [PAUSE] Ah.
L:  It's just -- it's scary when you don't know, like, what they're looking for.  Like, I mean, I know, like, they just look for what has a lot of people, but you don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What kind of thing, you know, like malls, like, I know.  Some of the biggest malls -- like, there's one -- like, one of the biggest malls around here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, I think it's -- I don't know, one of the top five in the country or something.  That's around here.
R:  In size, oh, okay.
L:  Again, like, the biggest malls are, like, huge, like, this one has, like, it's two stories but it's, like, broken off into two so it's kind of like two regular malls, like, at one place.
R:  Wow.
L:  And it's, like, say, a lot of people can sit there and you hit that, it's, like, a lot of people right there.
R:  Yeah. Mm. [PAUSE]
L:  I just think -- I think most people are just more aware.  Like, with the news, I think more people are watching the news now.
R:  Mm.  Do you think that things are safer the way the government is handling this --
L:  I don't know.  I heard, like, that they said that, like, because they're putting, like, so many more pe- like, jobs and stuff for the security.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I heard that, like, they're slowly, like, it's supposed to be, like, taking away our freedom.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I heard that, I heard -- I don't know.  I forget what I was looking at but somebody said that, like, it was just an editorial.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But they said, like, we're not realizing it right now, but -- 
R:  Huh.
L:  -- that they're, like, slowly taking away our freedoms and, like, the Constitution, like, they're, you know, because now, like, you know, because they're trying to prevent the terrorism.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I mean, some of it -- because that one guy they're looking for, he's, like, last known address was, like, the US.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Like, I don't know who it is now.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Something for the war 'cause he's a terrorist.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's, like, he's in the US, like, it's really freaky.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, when they're in the US, it's, like, that means, like, how are we really going to stop them, like? 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  If they're already in there, they're already in their plan or whatever.
R:  Yeah, and they should have stopped them, um, before they even came in or, you know, like, don't even let them in. [MN]
L:  I think, like, we -- nothing, but I think our country just lets everybody in.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, we really do.  Like, none of the other countries who haven't had these kind of problems, like terrorist problems.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because they don't [inaudible] like, and I think a lot of people are jealous because we have freedom.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's what -- I just think that's what's going on.  I think they're jealous because we have freedom or they don't want their people to know about our freedom and, you know. 
R:  Yeah, [COUGH] and so they'd rather just come in and ruin what we have or something.
L:  Yeah.  [PAUSE] It is -- it's just scary when they're in the US already because it's, like, how many, like, what can we do now when they're already in their plan?  I mean, you can't just go around, especially when, like, when they don't have a clear picture.  Like, they didn't have a clear picture of the guy they were looking for or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They were just going to run after everybody. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.
L:  And I think, like, the people, like, some of those countries that live here, like, people from other countries that are already here, I think that more people are, like, even if they don't know, like, what nationality or anything they are, I think they're just more, like, not, like, as open with them. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just because I don't think -- I think people are just scared.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I think we really do let everybody in our country.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, I mean, whatever the green card is, however long they get to stay here.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But at least, I mean, giving them out to, like, people -- I mean, I know they have to pass, like, some kind of skill but -- 
R:  Um. [NOISE]
L:  It's still kind of scary that they can just let all kinds of people in and you never know, like, you know, how many terrorists you're letting in with that.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [COUGH]
L:  Because, like, I don't think, like, for instance, England, I don't think they just let anybody in.
R:  They -- how do -- do they screen them and all that first?
L:  Probably.  I mean, yeah, I think they should have a better screening process on who we're letting into the country.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, there has to be some, like, thorough stuff going on, like, not, like, just, like, answer a skill question or something.
R:  Mm.
L:  Like they used to do, like, thorough background test and stuff or whatever else they can do.
R:  Mhm.  I -- I was also just thinking how, um, I guess around the time after September eleventh, um, I guess, you know, President Bush was trying to find Osama bin Laden, but, like, now they're focussing on the war and finding Saddam.
L:  And -- and he just got away.  Like, we don't even have him.
R:  Yeah, and it's like -- 
L:  Like, and it's just not talked about as much any more 'cause they're now looking for Saddam or whatever, Saddam. 
R:  Yeah, and it's like it doesn't mean that he's still, you know, he could still be on the run and planning.
L:  But they could, like, team up, they could probably, like --
