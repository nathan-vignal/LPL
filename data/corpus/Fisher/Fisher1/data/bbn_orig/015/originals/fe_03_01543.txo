L:  Hi.
R:  Hello?
L:  How you doing?
R:  I'm fine, how are you?
L:  All right.  You sound like you're from the south.
R:  I am, are you?
L:  I'm in the Midwest, I'm in Iowa.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Where are you at?
R:  Uh, Virginia.
L:  Virginia?
R:  Southern port of Virginia.
L:  Ah, what part -- what town?
R:  Uh, well we're right on the North Carolina line.
L:  Oh.
R:  Uh, below Rowan Oak about, uh, sixty miles.
L:  Well, what's your weather like?  Warm?
R:  No, it's raining.
L:  Yeah, that's what it's doing here.
R:  Yeah, not too bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  So ...
R:  We're talking about these --
L:  I think it sucks --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- when they strike because they make way too much money as it is already.
R:  Anyway.  Anyway, yes.
L:  Um, I -- and a good -- a good, uh, example is the Florida Marlins, I heard on TV yesterday that only one player out of the whole team has an extended, uh, contract and all of them are playing for a new contract for next year.  And I think that's the way it should be because they've gotta play.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They've gotta produce.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They've got -- you know, they've got to show what they've got or they're not going to have a contract.  And then, on the other hand, you've got these guys that are making eight million, you know, and do what -- you know, do a somewhat consistent job, you know, when they go out every two or -- you know, a pitcher hick[?] they only pitched every three or four days, maybe five.
R:  Actually I've never seen anyone in sports that's worth the money --
L:  No.
R:  -- that they're being paid.
L:  I mean, no Michael Jackson -- not Michael Jac- Michael Jordan.
R:  Right, I've never -- I --
L:  Uh, I prefer to watch college basketball, college sports --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because those kids are playing from the heart.
R:  Mhm, high school sports, I love -- I love local sports.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I love the local sports that --
L:  You know, the young kids 
R:  Oh --
L:  -- or the college or high school because those kids are playing for the game --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- not for the money.
R:  If it was -- if it was something that was absolutely necessary to this country, that we had to have, they --
L:  Well, why don't they play --
R:  -- they could sort of hold the country under siege but --
L:  Why don't they play the money and donate it? [LAUGH]
R:  Right, yeah, but this -- this -- there's no one in this country that cannot do without --
L:  No.
R:  -- that watching them on TV or whatever.
L:  We live on -- we live on very small incomes.
R:  Yeah, and so, uh, like I said, it -- I -- I just haven't seen any of 'em I think worth it.  And I prob- and there's probably a whole lot more talent out there that's not being used that would work for a lot less money [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, sure.  They -- they oughta all back in for their paychecks, I mean, as far as I'm concerned.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because nobody's worth it.
R:  No, but --
L:  You know, you make -- they make what some of us make in ten years, you know, it would take us to make [LAUGH].
R:  Okay, maybe. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, that -- you know that says -- I mean, for me, I mean I'm disabled and I -- I'm on a real fixed income so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, it would take me forever to make what some of those people make.
R:  Yeah.  They're -- like I said, they're -- they're -- and even they don't even hold the status that they used to.  Uh, it used -- you used to have to have, uh, morally, uh, ethical conduct you -- you -- I mean you had to be good people.
L:  Oh, well now you can --
R:  And -- and you don't even have to do that any more.
L:  Now you can watch TV and it's -- you can read --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- their lips, F this --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, all -- you know, they just -- you know, and then the smoking issue and the steroid issue --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and there's so -- you know, but no one -- you know, they've now said, "No steroids in minor leagues".
R:  Mhm.  Well, I've --
L:  But they haven't in -- in the -- in the, you know, majors.
R:  I think that the young people don't need the heroes that money -- I vote that sports are something for pleasure.  And I know competition is real good, uh, but --
L:  Well, sportsmanship is a quality that --
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  -- you know, that -- that a young child learns from.
R:  Mhm, absolutely.
L:  You know -- you know it's like, you know, it's -- it's like a good president --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or I mean a president doesn't even make that kind of money.
R:  Mm, it's true.  But if they're going to -- if they're going to be heroes to the young people then money should not be a factor.  It should be because they love the sport --
L:  That's right --
R:  Um, be- --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- because they're good, because they the sports.
L:  You know, you can be good and -- and earn seventy thousand a year.
R:  [LAUGH] I could. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you know -- you know, you've got those -- those, you know, like, Microsoft execs and all that who make billions, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know the Steve Cases and the -- and, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and all those guys but, you know, I  just -- I just don't see it -- I can't even -- I can't even fat- -- you know, in my head imagine that kind of money in a checking account.
R:  I -- I think -- I think the country will get tired of them.
L:  Because -- you know, and then they don't just get the salaries, they get all the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the perks, the baseball cards --
R:  Mhm, right.
L:  -- the -- the shoe, uh, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- contracts.
R:  Advertising, yeah.
L:  And the commercials.
R:  Uh, well if they'd look around they'd see that soccer's a growing, uh --
L:  Soccer?
R:  -- in this country, it's growing.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And, um, eventually people --
L:  Even women, even women.
R:  Yeah, mhm.  People will get tired of it and, um, it won't become so -- as important to 'em and, uh, so ...
L:  I -- I don't understand why they have to be so greedy, to be honest.
R:  Mm, but I do know -- I don't -- I cannot --
L:  That's all it is, it's the greed.
R:  Yes.  I cannot see an actual sports figure holding this country at siege and that's the way I look at it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That they've got the country by the throat and it's sort of [LAUGH] -- and it sort of, uh, if -- if you don't, you know, be -- the -- everybody doesn't divvy up we're not doing anything now so ...
L:  Right, right.
R:  And, uh, it -- it used to be something to everybody that people loved when they played it and, um --
L:  And it used to be really fun to go watch.
R:  I don't -- I don't like to be threatened and I'm sure the countr- the companies don't like to be threatened either.
L:  Yeah.  Well, the -- you know, the -- the like, "Well, if I don't get this" um, they throw a tantrum and don't play.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's -- and that's what it looks like -- I'm sure to a child, you know, I mean how can you cancel the World Series.
R:  Right.
L:  You know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- how can you go on strike and cancel the World Series?
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's --
R:  This is something we watched when, uh, in school even when I was growing up, we watched the World Series and --
L:  Well, sure.
R:  -- um, it -- like I said, it -- it's just not -- it doesn't seem to be all that important to anybody anymore to -- unless lots and lots of things.
L:  Well, it's -- it's -- that's all the importance is the money.  It's not the game.
R:  And actually -- actually they're a gamble anyway.  A company that, uh, owns them they gambling.  They can break a leg, they can get hurt and not be one --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- no good to 'em whatsoever.
L:  But then they get paid anyway.
R:  Yeah.  They could turn up not being -- and to me I think it would be a privilege to make a good salary and then to have somebody take of care of me if I did get hurt.  And that would be more important than the money, you know.
L:  I mean, they -- they get -- they -- they pull an a [inaudible], you know, an ACL or -- or -- or pop a knee out and they're still getting all their millions.
R:  Mhm.  Mm.
L:  You know and -- and they sit there and don't do anything.
R:  Yeah, that's right.  Ah.
L:  I just wish I made a quarter of what somebody -- some of those guys make just for the pain and agony I go through because I blew my back out.
R:  I think also, I think, the money and if you'll pay attention to the money, the prestige and everything these -- these guys in sports are getting so bigheaded and they think they're such idols.
L:  Oh, their heads are just so swelled they --
R:  But -- yeah.
L:  -- there -- there -- they oughta be up there with the -- the blimps.
R:  They -- they act like -- they act like they're beyond the law or the common person, uh --
L:  An- and -- and, you know, a lot of them have been getting in a lot of serious trouble with the law.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  You know and I think they think, "Well, I'll just get a slap on the hand".
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and "They're not going to do anything to me.  How can they do anything to me because I've gotta go out and play baseball?" and --
R:  I can do what I want to they need me.  Right.
L:  And they think, "I -- I'm an idol to people" well -- [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, they are a luxury, they're not something that's needed.  They're not a commodity --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- that has to be -- that we have to have.
L:  That's right.
R:  And, um, even -- and that's in all sports and I love sports.
L:  Oh, I do too.
R:  But --
L:  I watch a lot of sports but I'm -- I've gotten more interested in college --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than pro.
R:  An- any of the -- even, uh, the --
L:  Or the Olympics.
R:  Right.  Well, it's -- you take your wrestling there's -- [MN] there is real wrestling out there and it's -- and it's an art.
L:  Oh, yeah, not that -- that --
R:  But, if it's in the colleges --
L:  -- not the face mask crap.
R:  Mhm, colleges and the high schools.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  And -- oh, it -- it's the same thing I -- those kids really they work.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It means a lot to 'em.  It's good competition for 'em and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- um, I --
L:  I agree with ya.
R:  -- would much rather -- I would much rather support the, um --
L:  Do you have kids that play sports?
R:  Uh, my children have out -- they've gone and grown [LAUGH] they did.
L:  But they did, yeah.
R:  They did, oh yes, they did.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I didn't have any kids so I don't know, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- how it is to raise kids and -- and I don't know how but I know how it is to be young and go to a ball ...
