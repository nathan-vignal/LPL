R:  Hi, my name's Stephanie.
L:  Hi, my name's Jybil[?]  Hello?
R:  Yes, my name's Stephanie.
L:  Okay, okay, awesome.  Well, um, changes made in the wor- -- in our lives basically is -- that's what the topic is.  So, do you wanna start or should I?
R:  Oh, okay, I can start.  I'd say the changes I made in my life after September eleventh is to be, I guess, more, um, cautious and -- and just take life now.  I'm more serious and just, you know, that what happened was just basically important in this world that it can happen [NOISE] at any time.  And --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and national security is very important in this world.
L:  Right.  How ol- -- do you mind me asking your age?
R:  Um, well, I am thirty.
L:  Oh okay.  See I'm eighteen and, um, I'm still in high school so, um, I kinda oblivious to the fact that how far the US has taken its, like, course and changing, like, it's own way.  I mean, like, last year I know I changed man- -- like a whole lot since my father he kinda -- we're kinda in the economic struggle right now --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because, uh, uh, he owned a -- we own convenience stores and, uh, since that we were kinda in debt in many ways since like my sister goes to college, my brother goes to college --
R:  Right.
L:  I'm at [inaudible] college and our business is going so bad so --
R:  Yeah, the economy is real bad since what happened, yeah.
L:  Yes.
R:  'Cause there's so many jobs they're almost just not -- such as like travel agencies, they're not really in demand any more 'cause nobody wants to go traveling any more because due to security, you know, so a lot of people have made changes in their life and, uh, I have, I don't travel like I used to.
L:  Oh really, you don't at all?
R:  No --
L:  Okay. 
R:  -- I have a brother that lives in California and every summer we go down there to visit him but, no, I mean, I'm not get- -- I don't -- I was scared to death to get on a airplane anyway but now, no, I would never get on a airplane!  So, a lot changes have been made --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- in my life where I'm more -- I'm more aware of things as going around me now, like, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- such as, um, I don't drive anymore 'cause I just -- if I'm on the bus I do look around and if I'm on the sub I do -- I more cautious of something opening and closing around me.  
L:  Okay.
R:  Or if there's a lot of people around me or ...   And I'm -- I mean I'm not prejudice or anything but, um, I mean, you don't wanna stereotype the certain group that you think had done these things but when -- now that you see these people that supposed did the attack and if you see any of their race around you, you start to get a little, you know --
L:  Oh really?
R:  Um, I do.  I really do but I know it's not good.
L:  Okay, there is another --
R:  It's not.
L:  -- situation that I've had.  Um, I'm Indian and so --
R:  Oh, you're Indian?
L:  Yeah, yep.  [LAUGH] So, people actually think of me to be as, you know -- in relation in some way and I've actually gotten threatened at school.
R:  Oh no!
L:  Because of this whole deal.  Yeah.  And, I  mean, that's made an impact completely in my -- I was just like I do not believe there are people still today that actually think the way we have in the past.  It's like -- like -- and during the Holocaust or whatever, people, you know, it was because the Jews were da da de dah, you know, everyone dislike the Jews because they Jewish.  I mean, I'm glad that US hasn't been thinking that [inaudible] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because --
R:  I'm listening.
L:  [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, I don't -- I'd say I don't think -- uh, I'm not talking about the young generatio- -- I mean I'm just saying that -- I'm just more aware of just certain -- I'm just -- well, I'll just say this, I'm aware of certain people that I see in particular settings that I have not seen in a certain setting before and, um --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- see I'm not -- I'm not in college and it's different because it's -- it's -- it's -- it's a race bound[?], you know, you see every culture but --
L:  Yeah, I speak --
R:  -- if you go in a different setting and you see a certain class of people you are gonna tend to look around.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, you are gonna tend to say, "Why are these people here in a group" or something.  You know what I mean?  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean I'm not saying that it -- it's not bad or anything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but you're more  just aware of things as happening now, you have to be.
L:  So basically what you're saying is the changes that you've made is being more aware of security --
R:  Yeah, more awareness of my surroundings.
L:  Okay.
R:  It just -- and like --
L:  Well, like --
R:  -- I -- well, I -- go ahead.
L:  Okay.  Oh okay [LAUGH].  Well, me, like I personally -- rather than being more aware of what my surroundings, yeah I am, but I tend to focus more on -- after nine eleven I tend to focus more on how much I spend.  My spending, my expenditure and everything like that.  How much I spend day in and day out.  That's what I'm more worried about because my biggest concern is our money at -- right now.  And it -- it's so hard to get a job, it's so hard.
R:  It is.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly and so --
R:  It really is.  Yeah.
L:  But that's why -- that's my only concern.  I mean, being aware, there's gonna be things that will go on every day and we can't stop it, you know.  But, um, I mean, yeah --
R:  Okay, but just think about this.  You can be working right now and it could be a terrorist attack that goes on you right now because it's just more rampantly now.  You could go the Greyhound -- on the Greyhound bus and somebody can just attack you.  I mean these things can happen but it's just more rampantly now than ever before because this is how they attack.  They attack through the postal office --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they just attack certain places where you would -- you wouldn't expect they would before but now they do.  
L:  Right.
R:  And it's gonna get to the point where it's probably gonna be home invasion.
L:  Oh really, that'd be --
R:  Um, that's my biggest fear. I hope it doesn't get to that point where it be home invasions that they do.
L:  Wow -- man, I wasn't even -- there is no way --
R:  You know, you gotta think -- you see, the way they think is the way people don't think so you gotta think like how they think what think, very small minded, you know.  They don't think real big minded, they think real small, you know.
L:  Well, I honestly think that, um, they get more like a mass amount of people other than like ruining single family homes, you know, do you get what I'm saying?  Like --
R:  Right, and I don't mean --
L:  -- as a whole.
R:  -- with -- I mean -- I don't mean like home in- -- I mean like where they will attack a community --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- not just single out a home and just run up in it but they will just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- invade a, uh, like a community setting, do you understand what I mean?
L:  Yes.
R:  Just --
L:  Like those whole rumors on, um, being attacked at the mall and etcetera.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I didn't really buy into that at all, did you?
R:  No, I didn't.
L:  Yeah, so it was like -- I don't know it's just -- it's difficult to say 'cause I don't -- yeah, I'd -- I'd rather be aware but not live in fear.
R:  Right, you can't ever live in fear 'cause you can't live [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah.
R:  But you just gotta be aware -- always be aware of your surroundings and plus the biggest fear too is economy and it's just everything and you don't want it to get to where you're being educated, you're scared to be around certain races, it's just not fair to them, you know.
L:  Did you like --
R:  But, on the other hand, we're happy with the, um, NASA when the aircraft went dow- -- I mean, that's an aircraft, um, you never talk about the thing that exploded in Texas.
L:  Yeah, yeah, right, right.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, uh, in Fort Worth.
R:  And there was one, I think he was a Israelite, Israel man and I mean you've got to question these kind of things because they do die for their cause, you know.  They really do.  And they now get more educated than ever to befriend Americans and to do these kind of things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, these things you gotta be more aware of, not everybody of course of this race is doing anything but some are and some aren't, you know.
L:  So, like did you -- did you make any changes in like benevolence?  Like did you go out into the community and help people out after nine eleven?
R:  Um --
L:  'Cause, um --
R:  I -- I just became more -- it's like if somebody --
L:  Cautious.
R:  It's like if somebody you know their past that somebody was your loved one you just become more caring, more sensitive and more loving towards everybody --
L:  Oh.
R:  --'cause you've become -- you're just know you're taking it personal now because you know it just could happen to you now.  It could have been your family, you know.
L:  Uh-huh, because --
R:  It just could have been anybody.
L:  Yeah, yeah, sure.  'Cause, uh, my school, what we did was, uh, we actually formed like a charity ...
