L:  Hi, Michelle.
R:  Hi, I'm Kim.
L:  Hi, Kim.  [NOISE] Right --
R:  I'm in Arizona, where are you?
L:  [NOISE] Nashville, Tennessee.
R:  Oh, okay.  What do you think about professional sports players? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I think they make too much money.
R:  Yeah, I think they make too much too.
L:  I mean, I think sports is great -- are great but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think they just make too much money.  I think that there oughta be a cap and that when --
R:  Yes, I do too.
L:  -- they get to that point and if they don't wanna [NOISE] -- if they don't wanna participate anymore 'cause they're too good for it, to heck with them.  Let 'em --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, let 'em go do something else [NOISE] 'cause there'll always be somebody else.
R:  Yeah, there are a lot of 'em come up young and get scholarships --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- b- because they play sports and there's a lot of other people with more problems than they have.  I mean --
L:  Yeah, it kinda irks me when they act like they have problems and the work --
R:  I can understand that they might get injuries and they might not be able to play --
L:  And I'm sure that --
R:  -- for a long, long time but there's still -- how many millions do you need, you know, you play a couple of years -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's right.
R:  -- you've done all right, you know.
L:  [NOISE] That's exactly right.
R:  When you start living in the real world. [LAUGH]
L:  That's right and I don't know -- there's a fine line between the sport that it's always been and getting out of hand and I don't know that anybody [NOISE] really sees that because it just keeps getting worse and worse and worse.
R:  And the ticket prices go up and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it gets too expensive to --
L:  It just gets out of hand.
R:  -- take a family to a ball game and --
L:  Yeah, mhm.  Here we have -- we built a -- we turned one of our buildings into what we call Gaylord which are the owners of ou- used to be our free land theme park and they got so greedy they -- they closed that down and [NOISE] put a shopping mall.  But Gaylord bought, uh, built a huge convention center and that's where our hockey team [NOISE] plays.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I heard the other day, and this just makes me sick, that we could keep it filled every single day and never pay it off.  Now, something's wrong, you know, when --
R:  And the team didn't even pay for it, right?
L:  Right.  We're pay- --
R:  The town did.
L:  Exactly and we'll cont- --
R:  And why, what is that about?  I don't understand.
L:  I don't know.  I don't know but something is wrong somewhere, I think.  Do you have a lot of professional spo- -- you have baseball out there, I know, don't you?
R:  Yeah, well I'm new to Arizona.  I'm actually from Connecticut.
L:  Are you?
R:  I've only been here a year and, um, we do have, you know, baseball here and --
L:  That's good.
R:  Well, we're a few hours from it but we've gone to a few football games but, um --
L:  How did you get hooked up with this [NOISE] -- this is my -- only my sec- this is my second call.  I had one the night before last -- with this study.
R:  Um, I read about it online and it sounded like an easy way to make a little extra money and kinda fun.
L:  Was it a direct advertisement from them?  Or was it like --
R:  Um --
L:  -- on a message board.
R:  It was like on a message board, yeah.
L:  That's where I saw it.  Well, a friend sent me a link or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- told me how to do it so ...
R:  Right.
L:  Anyway, um, is this your first one?
R:  I had one the other day but, um, I lost the person and hanging up didn't work so I hung on thinking maybe they were still connecting me and no one ever came back so ...
L:  Oh.
R:  And then when I tried to call back it said I already had done a call for today so I don't know what happens with that one but this is really my only first call that's working. [LAUGH]
L:  Well --
R:  Where there's a -- I mean, there was a guy on another time who right away -- maybe he didn't want to talk to a woman, I don't know, 'cause there was like a click.
L:  What was the topic?
R:  Um, it was a good topic.  It was an easier one to talk about than sports.  It was, um --
L:  Yeah, this is kinda hard.
R:  About how nine eleven affected --
L:  Yeah, I did that one too.
R:  Did you get a person with that one? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, uh, a nice lady from Philadelphia.
R:  Yeah, that would have been the easiest topic to talk about.  'Cause the topic the very first day was censorship and that's the one I never got a person to talk to and I couldn't really --
L:  It was on what?  Censorship?
R:  Censorship.  Censorship, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, god.
R:  And that one was really hard to think of what to talk about --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then I though, "Well, okay, nine eleven how it affected us, almost anybody can relate to that". [LAUGH]
L:  Are you a sports fan? [NOISE]
R:  You know, I'm not really a sports fan but for the last eight or nine years I've followed sports, mostly because, um, my husband is into card collecting.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  And kinda of a dare we got into the sports collectible baseball card --
L:  Is that funny --
R:  -- business.
L:  -- we did too.
R:  You did too?
L:  We -- [MN]
R:  Well, we just -- he just retired last year but -- and like liquidated almost all of his stuff --
L:  We did that three years ago.
R:  -- except for a few items.  We had a Michael Jordan --
L:  That's so funny.
R:  -- autographed basketball that we just got rid of recently and we still have some women's soccer items that we overbought because we lived in Wilton and Christine Lilley was from Wilton and we thought it would go over big and everybody admired the poster autograph of the whole team --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and no one wanted to shell out the bucks for it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, we still have two -- I got rid of a Mia Ham[?] jersey in Arizona [LAUGH] --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- but I still have the whole team signed ball and the team signed poster --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But, um --
L:  My husband would die for that.
R:  -- we were in business, and you probably were too, in ninety four --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think it was when the baseball strike was?
L:  Yup.  Yup.
R:  And didn't that hurt your business?
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  And it took years to recover.
L:  Did you have a store?
R:  Well, it wasn't really our store, it was -- my brother was in the video business and we were, um -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- my husband works for the post office full time but on weekends, when he was off, he would go round the flea markets and he'd always be looking at cards and -- and, um, he -- he would be a lot slower than me looking --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at the cards and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- we'd be there, like, all day.  And I was, like, "Well, jeeze, if we're going to hang around the flea market all day we might as well set up a table and --"
L:  There you go.
R:  -- see if we can sell any stuff".  So, he was like, "Okay".  And also I was also watching him buy a card here and there to complete the set and kinda --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- scoffing at what he paid for a card.  And he's like if you only need one or two to complete a set it's worth it to buy it, blah, blah, blah.  And I'm like, you know, it's a piece of paper, it seems silly to me --
L:  [NOISE] Come on.
R:  -- so it was kinda like, it was started as a dare that he was going to show me he could sell his cards and we set up a table --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- one Sunday, early in the morning, and I brought a bunch of my old records and he brought his baseball cards and some other stuff hanging around the house and we both did quite well.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And then it became more cards and let's do it again and the more he'd sell, the more he'd buy and then my brother needed someone to cover Sundays in his store and I'm like, "Oh, we really hate to give up the flea market" and he was like, "Well, you could sell stuff in store".  Um, he had two stores at the time and he's like, "A girl who works in my Springvale store --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- does a side business out of the store".
L:  [MN]
R:  And, uh, the thought was really appealing because doing flea markets, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the weather can be unpredictable.
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  I was really a pain trying to keep the sun off the cards.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, we started setting up tables in the video store with the sports cards --
L:  Cool. [NOISE] And it went -- 
R:  -- and it went over really well because sometimes his customers would start buying cards --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and sometimes our card customers would start renting movies and after a while --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we were there more than -- we were there Saturday and Sunday --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and then we were there during the week as people would want something and, "Could you bring it, you know, during the week, leave it here for me".
L:  [NOISE] Sure.
R:  So, eventually we just kinda moved to a corner of the store [LAUGH].  But he liked it too 'cause we were -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we were running his store for him very reasonable, we were getting free rent so we had no overheads except for buying our cards.  And, uh --
L:  Well, [NOISE] sure and that could have been expensive too.
R:  Yeah, we started spending --
L:  [NOISE] Did you --
R:  -- more and more.
L:  [NOISE] Did you feel like that the strike really impacted, seeing it from a store level? [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I was like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] I remember when business started picking up again and people came back to baseball.  Baseball was always our strongest sport.
L:  But it took awhile --
R:  But, um --
L:  -- didn't it?
R:  It took a while for it to come back but it was so good when it came back.
L:  Yeah, it was.
R:  And when it was off some people would get into basketball or football maybe, grew a little bit but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- never as good as -- baseball was always kind and -- and when baseball finally rebounded, um, I don't know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it just -- any time I hear talk about contracts or negotiations it always worry me because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I remember how -- we had just like gotten to the point where our business had really grown and, uh --
L:  [NOISE] And are you still in the business?
R:  No, no.  We kinda thought about when --
L:  Oh, that's right.  I'm sorry, you told me that you sold your -- [NOISE]
R:  We talk- we just -- my husband just retired a little over a year ago and I've been out here --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- since, uh, it was year in January, the end of January, a little more than a year now and, um, we thought about setting up a card shop out here but it really ties ya down and --
L:  It's so different. [MN]
R:  All those years we were in business, we couldn't travel or, you know, take any time off together so if we're like overnight, back the next day --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- open the store late on a Sunday.  That was our day off, from Saturday afternoon to Sunday morning. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, and then --
R:  Saturday evening -- and we have to work with the video business -- you have to work --
L:  Oh, lots of hours.
R:  -- you know, till eight or nine o'clock at night, yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  Ten or eleven in the mornings.  So, Sunday's we'd open at noon after a while so that we had like a half a day off a week.  That was -- 
L:  What do you think --
R:  Plus my husband was still working full time for the post office, you know, and besides running the business.
L:  Well --
R:  And, um --
L:  Yes, that's --
R:  So, we're like -- we've been taking a complete [inaudible], we're like really relaxed now. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I miss the -- I do miss -- when we were in business and selling the cards and --
L:  Seeing the people and --
R:  I really like making the sales and I started watching sports then because, like, you know, if a player did good or Michael Jordan retired --
L:  Again. [LAUGH]
R:  His cards all were hot and then when he was back playing they overloaded his cards in the market so much, you know, and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- TV and shop at home.
L:  Well, they -- they've ruined it.  Back in the good --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Upper deck really.
L:  -- you know, they just -- they just ruined it.
R:  They ruined Michael Jordan cards but --
L:  I think they ruined all of 'em.  The market just got saturated --
R:   Yeah, I ...
