L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hello, my name's Maxine, I'm calling from New York.
R:  Oh, my name's Jenny, I live in New York too but not in New York City.
L:  Oh, where are you from?
R:  Western New York, halfway between Buffalo and Rochester.
L:  Oh, okay.  Is that like, uh, apple country.
R:  Yeah, there's quite a few apple orchards around here.
L:  Oh, nonetheless I think we're supposed to talk about professional athletes and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and strikes by professional athletes.
R:  And whether or not they deserve the high salaries they get.
L:  Well, I mean, the way I feel is this, I mean, American society, in my opinion, is ass [inaudible], excuse the language.
R:  It's true. [LAUGH]
L:  People who -- okay, people who do jobs that benefit society --
R:  Get nothing.
L:  -- are nothing -- like teachers, librarian, nurses, social workers, whatever earn nothing.
R:  You're talking to a nurse.
L:  Right, oh, terrible nursing shortage here in New York City.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, my god, terrible, terrible, terrible.
R:  Yeah, but these people --
L:  They had all these Irish nurses and the Filipino nurses they have them all back.
R:  But they have these professional athletes making millions of dollars but not one --
L:  Right, it's -- it's bizarre.
R:  -- of them is worth.
L:  It's ab- -- I mean, it's bizarre.  Granted probably they figure well, they could do something that nobody else can do.
R:  Yeah, so what?
L:  But -- right, that's true.  But millions and millions and millions?
R:  Yeah, it's not -- they're not worth it, not one of them's worth the money they're paid.
L:  No, they -- I -- I don't -- I -- I'm not into sports --
R:  Me either.
L:  -- but, to me it seems bizarre. 
R:  Well, I think that's the reason I'm not because I can't stand the fact that these idiots -- you know, these--
L:  And they're not even --
R:  A lot of them a substandard citizens as far as I'm concerned.
L:  Yes, they are and --
R:  And they're getting paid all this money for playing a game.
L:  They're not even -- they're not nice people.
R:  No, they're not.
L:  They -- they -- they're very nasty to the fans.  I mean --
R:  Yes, and then they go on strike because they can't make living?  Excuse me?
L:  Oh, please.
R:  That is so stupid.
L:  Right, I -- I agree.  I mean it's just -- to me it's bizarre that someone could, uh, uh, throw basketballs --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and earn fifty million dollars a year.
R:  I tell you, if -- if I could sit on the bench, third string --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- whatever freaking professional team there was, warming the bench my entire career to get paid their minimum wage of whatever -- a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year, I'd be perfectly happy.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Wouldn't -- I -- I mean I would suck up so bad -- if it was my quarterback I'd -- I'd sit on the bench and warm the spot and when he came over I'd jump up and let him have the warm seat.
L:  I -- I hear you.  I mean, I -- I agree too.  To me it's just --
R:  I think it's --
L:  -- bizarre.
R:  I think it's ridiculous that they get paid this kind of money.  And that -- then -- and then they -- they all complain that they don't get enough money and they go on strike.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then the fans are supposed to put up this and then come back to see 'em again.
L:  Mm, just totally bizarre as far as --
R:  And then --
L:  -- I'm concerned.
R:  Yeah, the amount of money it costs for tickets.
L:  Oh, forget it.  Hun- -- I think one ticket to one game is a hundred dollars.
R:  Yeah, last time I --
L:  Not -- not me!  Not me.
R:  I went a couple of times about --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- fifteen, twenty years ago and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- even back then it was like forty dollars for a ticket --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- up in nosebleed heaven.  I'm like this is ridiculous.
L:  Yeah, right, right, right.
R:  And you can see it better on TV if you wanna watch it.
L:  Right.  I mean, many, many years ago in the fifties, the early sixties my father used take I and my brother.  He took us a few times to the Yankee Stadium to see the Yankees, we sat way up -- tickets were like nothing but, uh, that was like -- we're talking forty, forty five years ago [LAUGH].  Anyway, um --
R:  Oh, yeah and just to get a hotdog.  It costs four and a quarter for a hotdog.
L:  Oh, holy cannoli. [LAUGH]
R:  But it's unbelievable --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- what these guys are paid.
L:  I mean, I'm talk- -- I think it's just -- it -- they have no right to go on strike.
R:  No, they don't.  I don't think they have any right --
L:  You know, I mean, they have --
R:  -- to go on strike.
L:  -- no gratitude --
R:  No.
L:  -- for -- for the millions they earn --
R:  No.
L:  -- and they squander it and they --
R:  Yeah, that's what drives me crazy.  These guys have reached the end of their career after five years, well you're getting paid twenty million, what do you mean you got no money left.  What the hell did you do with it?
L:  They bought a hundred cars.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Te- ten mansions.
R:  God, show some self control.
L:  No, no.  Right, right, right.  And they're not nice -- well, I mean, Oprah Winfrey had a show about them, they're not nice to women --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- these -- these athletes, they're not nice to women.
R:  Well, what about those baseball players?  Some poor little kid walks up to 'em, wants an autograph, they want to charge him fifty bucks for signing a damn ball?
L:  That's right.  That's right.  That's absolutely terrible.
R:  Well, you can shove that ball where the sun don't shine I sure as hell wouldn't pay ya.
L:  That's right.  Exactly true.  Exactly -- exactly true.  I agree a hundred percent.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, let's see what else can you say about this topic? [LAUGH] I guess we're kind of in agreement on this. 
R:  Yeah, but you gotta talk for ten minutes.
L:  Yeah, right.  Let's see what else could I say for ten minutes [LAUGH].  Um, let's see, um -- and you're right, I mean, there's one of them -- what was his name?  He recently died, I can't think of -- the excellent basketball player.  He said he slept with ten thousand women!
R:  Oh, yeah.  Was that Magic Johnson?
L:  No, no, he's the one who has AIDS.  Another idiot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What the hell was this guy's name?  I can't think of it.
R:  Will Chamberlain.
L:  Yes. [MN]
R:  Yes.
L:  That's disgusting. 
R:  And it's also, I think --
L:  Ugh.
R:  -- physically impossible.
L:  Oh, okay, well --
R:  What -- what age would he have to start at and how many women would have to have a night --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- in order to do this?
L:  Yeah, Magic Johnson, what did he need?  The guy had it all --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and he -- he -- he -- he -- he -- let's say, he engaged in perverted behavior.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And now he's, uh, you know, stupid, stupid, stupid, mm.
R:  Well, I don't know these people they're just all --
L:  Perverted?
R:  -- sub intelligence if you ask me.
L:  Degenerate, bizarre?
R:  They're all -- a lot of 'em are just, I don't know, sub intelligent.  You give 'em a little bit of money and they go nuts.  
L:  I -- I --
R:  And they think -- oh, and they think they're above the law.
L:  Yes.
R:  They can do whatever --
L:  Yes, yes, yes --
R:  -- they want because they get paid a million dollars year.
L:  A million, try a billions. 
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  You know that guy who was a basketball player, he's from New Jersey, he murdered his chauffeur.
R:  Oh, my god, really?
L:  Yeah, when was this?  A couple of month ago.
R:  I didn't hear that one.
L:  He murdered his chauffeur and then he denied it, he tried to cover it up.
R:  Oh, brother.
L:  But, uh, they got him.  I guess he's gonna go -- they'll try him and who the hell knows if he has a good lawyer.  
R:  Yeah, he'll just buy his way out like OJ.
L:  He could get off, who the hell knows about that, right? [LAUGH]
R:  He'll just buy his way out like OJ did.
L:  Yeah, right, exa- exactly.  The --
R:  And who -- who in the whole world doesn't think this pro- previously professional football player that played for Buffalo, where I live, didn't kill his wife?
L:  I mean, what's -- what's bizarre is that how did -- what's the -- how did he kill them both.  I mean, okay I could see --
R:  He was waiting for 'em in the dark and he -- he nailed them before they could do anything.  Get the guy first and --
L:  For both of them?
R:  Well, heck, yeah.  He's strong, the guy was a -- the guy was a bit of a -- of a fan if you ask me and, uh, you get the guy first and she's gonna be no match for him at all.  She would be no match for him.
L:  That -- that's the thing now, how did he kill them both without -- he had no blood him, no nothing.
R:  Well, he had plenty of time to clean up.
L:  Oh, that's true too.  I mean, that's what seems so bizarre, how he got them both without --
R:  Nobody was there to see.  And he had -- he had --
L:  But they didn't even fight back?
R:  He had -- well, he had plenty of time to clean up before --
L:  I guess so.
R:  -- anybody -- anybody found the bodies.
L:  I mean, he was -- I mean, the man was much younger than him and he -- wouldn't he fight back or something?
R:  Yeah, but the guy was also -- you gotta remember OJ Simpson's a professional football player, he's probably a strong kinda tall guy, this guy was a waiter.
L:  Yeah, but he was much younger.
R:  Kinda skinny -- skinny, kinda small --
L:  Oh, all right, well maybe so I mean, uh --
R:  So -- and if he -- and if he -- if he caught him by surprise, bam, cut his throat, bam, you're dead just like that.  There's no fighting back.
L:  Well, then thi- that would mean that OJ Simpson is a sociopath if he sliced their throat then he's a sociopath.
R:  Well, that's how he killed 'em, he cut their throats.
L:  Well, maybe he is a sociopath.
R:  Well, look how much money he got paid.
L:  That's true too.  And -- and he wasn't nice to woman.
R:  Yeah, and then that family sued him and they supposedly got all his money but he still seems to be living the high life.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And he's -- he was a professional sports player.
L:  Right, he wasn't nice to the -- the -- the wife, he forced her to get breast implants --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- to mutilate her body, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm. [MN]
R:  Oh, these professional sports guys, I don't know, they thi- they think they're, you know, God, God on earth here because, you know, they get paid so much and people cheer and scream for 'em and --
L:  Uh, not me. [LAUGH]
R:  Not me either.
L:  But, uh, people do.  People -- people, people do.  People do that, right, right, right.  I mean, uh, that's true, that's true.
R:  I don't know, I just have very little respect for most professional sports players.
L:  Well, I mean, like some of them like the -- the -- the, uh, Serena -- oh, the Williams sisters.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're the best women's tennis players, the- they seem to be very good.
R:  Oh, I'm not saying, you know, a hundred percent.  I'm talking maybe ninety five percent --
L:  The men are very, uh, degener-
R:  I would say ninety percent, ninety five percent of professional sports players are idiots. 
L:  Yeah, they're -- 
R:  And that's -- they're probably -- this is --
L:  -- well, I wouldn't say idiots, I would say degenerate and bizarre behavior and no gratefulness.
R:  Yeah, I -- yeah.
L:  Degenerate bizarre behavior and no gratefulness.  That -- that I would say --
R:  There is a few out there -- there's a few out there that are g- grateful for the amount of money that they make do try --
L:  Yeah, I think Michael Jordan is a very good person.
R:  Yes, yes, they do try to help people and they have, you know, like their little foundations and -- but even that, you know, I mean, they -- they -- they gotta put their name on a foundation but, I suppose it's there money so ...
L:  Right, but I mean I don't agree with strikes by professional b- -- that's professional athletes, that's too bizarre.
R:  It is.
L:  Oh, oh, you're only earning twenty million, you want a hundred million, oh please.
R:  Well, it's the minimum wage -- the people that are only making a hundred and fifty grand a year can't make a living at that.
L:  Oh, please.
R:  I know they ca- but one guy came round and said he couldn't feed his family.  I'm like, "What the hell are you talking about?  Can't feed your family on a hundred and fifty grand a year, what the heck are you buying?"
L:  [LAUGH] Right.  How many Mercedes Benz cars do you have?
R:  Yeah, this is true, yeah.
L:  How many houses do you have?  You know, I mean, people don't -- these athletes they don't realize that it's possible to live comfortably but modestly!
R:  Oh yeah, you can do it on a heck of a lot less than that.  That's for sure.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I mean if people just focus on gratitude instead of, oh, materialistic this and that and the other thing, right?  But --
R:  Well, that's it, they -- they think they're entitled.
L:  Yeah, right that's what it is.  Right.
R:  If somebody says, "Oh, you're -- you're real good at this, you're never gonna have to work a day in your life" so it's like, "Oh, I'm entitled.  I'm better than anybody ...
