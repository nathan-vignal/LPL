R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello, my name's Marty.
R:  Hi, I'm Dawn. [SIGH]
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I've been on hold for a little while, so .... [LAUGH]
L:  Oh! [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  They were trying to find somebody else.
L:  Oh.
R:  Okay. [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  I forgot I had to fini- uh, I f- forgot I was in this study, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I know.  Th- well, they called me for the first time yesterday. [LIPSMACK]
R:  Oh yeah?  Well, I --
L:  And, uh, I'd forgotten all about it.  Okay, just a minute, sweetie pie.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um ...
R:  So ...
L:  So the topic [inaudible] --
R:  Yep.  How are we -- how have I changed my life since September eleventh?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Well ...
L:  [COUGH]
R:  [SIGH] I guess it's more of just an attitude.  More than --
L:  You what?  I'm sorry.
R:  [MN] That's okay, it's probably my phone.  Uh, I said, it's probably more an attitude than any physical thing I do.  [PAUSE] Oh! [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] [inaudible].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh shit.
L:  Hello?
R:  Yeah, I'm here.
L:  Okay.
R:  I'm gonna -- I -- I'm on my cellphone and I think I'd better plug it in.
L:  Oh!
R:  That would be why --
L:  Yeah --
R:  Okay.
L:  We're -- we're kinda the same way.  I mean, we're definitely more diligent and -- about watching what's going on ar- around us, but as far as major changes, you know, we kinda figure, what's gonna happen is gonna happen.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I still fly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, did -- that hasn't changed 'cause I feel like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that could happen any time anyway.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I, [SIGH] uh, you know, it -- I [SIGH] -- I just have to say more than -- that the biggest thing that I know I've had a -- a change is with my children [SIGH].
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like, with the war --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And making sure things -- they don't see as much, 'cause they're only five and four.
L:  Yeah. [COUGH]
R:  And my son still see- -- he -- he remembers.  He remembers nine eleven and the buildings.  And he sees them in movies and in pictures and he gets a sad look on his face and says, "Why did they -- why didn't they just turn?"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah!
R:  A- and so I -- I -- I'm definitely, I'd say that --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- and having more of an awareness of what they see, and what they understand. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Luckily my -- my kids were -- [NOISE] well, I was pregnant with my daughter when it happened and -- and my son was too little to really know what was going on, [NOISE] so --
R:  Yeah, my daughter didn't know.
L:  -- I actually consider that a blessing.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  He -- he really didn't -- 'cause he's only three now.  Honey, popcorn's in the microwave.
R:  Oh, that's like my daughter.
L:  So, you know, he's a -- he [NOISE] -- he really doesn't understand.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and even with the [NOISE] -- the -- we don't let him watch too much of the news, just because of all that stuff --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but he really -- he didn't really get it either, so [NOISE] that's actually --
R: Yeah.
L:  -- kinda nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Um, but, [NOISE] yeah, we've -- we've kinda -- we never did the, you know, the plastic and -- and duct tape thing, I was like, if they're --
R:  No, I never did any of --
L:  -- gonna get us, they're gonna get us, you know?
R:  I never did any of that either.
L:  Um, not [MN] we're not the type to panic, so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.  Um --
R:  I -- I mean, we have a thing if a- [MN] -- my husband and I have talked, we've got a cabin up north.  Okay, if --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- something were to happen, we go live up there, you know! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  [NOISE]  Well, we're in the mid west, so ...
R:  Yeah, so am I.
L:  -- you know, the -- the chances of anything happening here are [LAUGH] ...
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  I know that sounds really silly but ... you know.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I -- I'm in, uh, Wisconsin.
L:  Uh.  Yeah, w- Indiana, so --
R:  Indiana, okay.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I -- I mean, this is just not, you know, it's not, uh, a high metropolitan area or anything, so --
R:  Yeah, no --
L:  -- there's not really anything to strike here, so ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Um, that's one of the good things about living here!
R:  Yeah.  Well, I, uh [LAUGH] -- so -- well we're just west of Milwaukee.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, you know, [MN] I guess we could be but [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think there are other military strikes that, uh, would be ahead of us but ...
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  It's not anything I sit and -- and worry about, you know. [SIGH]  I don't, you know --
L:  Yeah.  Well, about the only thing we have really [MN] would be like, the Indy Five Hundred.  I mean, we live in Indianapolis, so --
R:  Uh, yeah.  Oh, okay.
L:  -- if they were gonna like, try and do something like that, you know, we're -- we're ground zero for there but, you know, [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- other than that, um, [NOISE] there's not -- there's not really anything here. [NOISE]  So ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's kind of [NOISE] -- it -- it's a nice place to live though. [NOISE]
R:  Uh, g-
L:  And, uh, I'm working on it! [NOISE]  He's, uh, he's a little impatient tonight.
R:  Oh yeah, I know, it's like trying to talk on one --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- t- subject for a while, it's, uh --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- not easy, you know! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's a hard subject to talk about 'cause it's so vast, um --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, well --
L:  You're not even --
R:  -- it's like my life is -- has changed since then, but for different reasons [LAUGH], you know!
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  There -- well, there have been a lot of changes.  Um, [NOISE] [SIGH] we didn't really know anyone there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, we felt for them and it was a tragic thing and -- and we felt horrible about it but directly affecting our lives, it really hasn't much.  Um --
R:  Yeah.  I'd have to say the same too.
L:  Li- like I said --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- we're -- we're diligent about watching what's going on around us, but other than that there's really nothing we can do anyway.  Um ... you know, you rely on your faith to get you through whatever you're gonna get through and ... if there's a smallpox e- -- you know, epidemic, well, okay, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if we're supposed to make it through we're gonna make it through. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  If not, we won't.  So ... [COUGH]
R:  Yep, yeah.  It -- [MN] kinda have to say of the same attitude.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  Mostly -- mostly we're like you, we try and keep the kids, you know, away from the coverage and all that kind of thing.
R:  Mhm, definitely.  Yeah, that's a big thing I don't --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- watching a lotta that because they just don't understand and you can't [NOISE] -- can't explain it to them in a -- in terms they will understand.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like [inaudible].
L:  Well we -- we do have friends in the military unfortunately and [NOISE] we were kinda worried that he'd be sent over.
R:  Mm.
L:  And, uh, and that kinda thing.  But, I mean, luckily he wasn't, but, um --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you -- you just never know.
R:  No, you don't.
L:  And -- and had that happened, you know, we would've said, you know, "Uncle J.C. is going to protect us and take care of us and ..." and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, that's all you can do.  But ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  You know, you just -- you -- you explain to 'em what you have to but [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at this age, you know, it's like, [SIGH] they d- just don't get it. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  I seen it more with my -- my cousins and that who have kids who are like, seven, eight, you know.  Th- --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're really [LAUGH].  'Cause, I mean, I've -- I've heard their kids ask some pretty tough questions, and -- and having to field those, and I kinda count my blessings that I don't have any!
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  To ask me those kinda questions right now, 'cause [NOISE], I mean, I wouldn't have the answers and ...
R:  Yeah, I -- yeah, definitely.
L:  Don't really know how to respond.
R:  I- I've got -- you know, I've got some --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- older -- older kids too, who, you know, they had the TVs on during --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- the whole thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, during school.  And I'm like, I don't think that was probably a really good idea.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know? [LAUGH]
L:  Now, you said you have a five year old, are they in kindergarten or ...?
R:  Uh, no, no.
L:  Okay.
R:  He's gonna start kindergarten in the fall.
L:  Okay. [NOISE]  Um, has --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he seen much of the -- of the coverage or anything?
R:  No, he really doesn't know much of what's going on.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] Uh, he kinda asked me something today.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  He -- he ga- -- he asked, he's very observant, you know, he asked about the yellow ribbons.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That everyone has out.  And he is like, "Why are they there, what are they p- -- what are they for?" you know.  So I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- explained th- to him as best I could.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And [LAUGH] you know, it's -- it's because that's the war.  "What war?"
L:  [COUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You know?  "Well ..."
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] And -- and of course then he was w- -- he's like, "Are they gonna come to Wisconsin?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Are they gonna fight in Wisconsin?"  "No, no --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- they're not gonna fight in Wisconsin".
L:  Yeah.
R:  At least I hope not!
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  "I- if all goes well, no!"
R:  Yeah! [LAUGH] Yeah.  I thought we were trying to m- have not happen I guess, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- still, I try not to worry about it.
L:  Yeah.  Now --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Now, Wisconsin is a border state, right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or no?
R:  Oh, um, actually no, because we've got, uh, Michigan.  And --
L:  Michigan, okay, yeah.
R:  -- and Lake Superior.
L:  Okay.
R:  And then --
L:  So, I -- I wondered if you had problems with, you know, if you had border patrols or whatever?
R:  No, no.  And -- not unless they come across Lake Superior.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that -- well, that might be a little more difficult. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's pretty cha- -- it's a pretty choppy lake! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah!
R:  I'm not --
L:  And it's a pretty large body of water.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  It'd be kinda hard to get across that without being noticed, I would think.
R:  You would think, especially in the winter! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I hear the winters up there are brutal.
R:  They're pretty bad.  Wasn't too bad this -- this winter, except in this last week.
