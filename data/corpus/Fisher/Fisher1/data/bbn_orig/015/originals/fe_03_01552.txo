L:  Hello, this is George.
R:  Hi, this is Jennifer.
L:  U- um, the first time I did this.  So, I don't know what to do.
R:  Um, I think we're just supposed to talk about the, um, recent baseball strikes.
L:  Oh, I, uh, think they make too much money.
R:  Yeah, definitely.  Um, do you know who's striking?
L:  Uh, no, I don't.  I don't even watch baseball.
R:  No?  Um --
L:  No.
R:  -- I'm not sure it's baseball.
L:  Oh, I don't watch any sports actually.
R:  Oh.  Well, yeah, they definitely make a lot of money.
L:  Yes.  Um, the fans are the ones paying for it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think they should, uh, make that kind of money.
R:  [PAUSE] No.  Um  man, this was the, um, question yesterday too.  Um -- I'm not sure.  I just think that they, um -- they make too much money and they're too whiny about everything because all they have to do with their lives is just, like, work out and then play a game.  And I don't understand why that's so difficult  for these people.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't understand that either.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] They make way too much money for doing nothing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Having fun.
R:  Right, exactly.  And, um  I don't know, um, is it even baseball season?
L:  Uh, I'm not even sure.  Um, in fact I just seen on TV there was, uh, um, baseball thing going on.  So, I think, um, it is going on now.
R:  Okay.  Then, um  I don't know, it might be hockey.  [MN]
L:  Yeah, if, uh, football ain't going on.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]  Hm.
L:  But I just still think they make too much money and, uh, they, um -- they do whine a lot, like you said.
R:  Yeah.  I remember the, um  the baseball strike a few years ago.  And that --
L:  And how much did they get?
R:  Um, I have no idea the, um, terms of the strike.  But I know that, um -- I read somewhere that their, um, fan -- like, their fan base, has really gone down since then.
L:  Right.  Do you watch baseball?
R:  Um, I used to when I was very young, but, um, because the Cleveland Indians would, um, practice near my hometown.
L:  Right.
R:  So, um, they used to -- people used to go watch 'em.  We'd watch the games and stuff.
L:  I remember last time they were, um, going to go on strike that, um, a bunch of people -- they were going to lose their, um, their fans.  So, um, I think they settled.
R:  Right.  And when was this?
L:  Uh, I think last year.
R:  Oh, last year?
L:  I think so.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know anything about last year, um  let me see.
L:  I think the Yankees make the most money.
R:  Probably.  But, um  didn't they -- I don't know -- didn't they just win something?
L:  I don't know.  I'm not sure.
R:  Fairly recently?
L:  But, um, they should, uh, donate some of their money to, um, other people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that, um -- I think, um, a million dollars is enough for one person to live on.
R:  Yeah, definitely.  Um, yeah, but they make so much more than that.
L:  Oh, I think they make millions, like seventeen, twenty, thirty million.
R:  Yeah.  And, I mean, they can't really be being mistreated, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  So, those are usually the terms of the strikes, like, just with people either being treated unfairly or it's money.
L:  Yeah, I think it's more money than being unfairly treated.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they always want more money, more money, more money.
R:  Yeah.  That's horrible. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I could use some of that money.
R:  Yeah.  I think everybody could.  But, um, I don't know, I think a lot of athletes do charity stuff.  I don't know much -- if they actually give money.  But I think they make appearances so that people can donate money to the, um -- to the charity, like other people, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and not them I don't think.
L:  I remember that one, uh, baseball player, he's really snotty, um  to people when they meet him.  So, I don't know how he would be, uh, involved in charities.
R:  Is he that one from, um, from Atlanta?
L:  Yeah, I think so.
R:  A few years ago?
L:  Yeah, I think so.
R:  Yeah.  I was living in Atlanta when that whole thing was going on and it would be, um, on the local news, like, what everybody should do with him, and they had people, um, calling in, you know, at the end of the newscast and voting whether we think that they should like, kick him off the Braves or not.
L:  Yeah, you know, Sammy Sosa and, uh, I don't know the other guy's name.
R:  Oh, um [PAUSE] are you talking about the guys that, um, hit all those baseballs in a row?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Oh, that was, um, [LIPSMACK] Sammy Sosa and Mark Maguire.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think, yeah.
L:  I think they said that Maguire is snotty and Sammy Sosa was real nice.
R:  Oh, Maguire is real snotty?  I don't know.  I only, um, heard about it through --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, pop media, you know, that he was doing all that.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't know.  I watched that episode of The Simpsons --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- he appeared on. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Um ...
L:  Maybe they should, um, j- uh, travel around and, um, give some of their money away.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think you have to be a certain kind of personality to be, um, an athlete and maybe a downfall of that personality is, like, you're so self absorbed, you know?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it's got to be hard living that lifestyle, I mean, with people, um, swamping you all the time, coming up to you for autographs and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  But that's what they chose so ...
R:  Well, yeah.  It also seems like they don't really do anything, um, for, like, charities unless something specific has happened to them, you know?
L:  Right.  Yeah, like if, um, they get cancer or something like that then --
R:  Right.  Then --
L:  -- all of a sudden they're donating millions of dollars.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Which, I mean, I guess if you have the money then that's the thing to do, but it just seems -- that also seems kinda  like a fake reason.
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  You know, just to -- to look like you're donating --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for something?
L:  A normal, uh, human being could live on, like, two million dollars and, um, they're walking around seventy five, eighty million.  Or, I mean, th- that, um, a person can live on two million for the rest of their life.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they're walking around with eighty million, a hundred million, in one year.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I think that's ridiculous.
R:  Oh, no.  I would definitely not strike a job --
L:  [LAUGH] No.
R:  -- that was paying that kind of money.  I don't care. [LAUGH]
L:  I think that's why they striked, they wanted more money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  [PAUSE] I don't know.  Where are you calling from?
L:  Um, New York.
R:  New York City?
L:  Uh, no, upstate New York.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  What about you?
R:  Uh, Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, Pennsylvania?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh! [PAUSE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [PAUSE] Huh, I hope they get a better subject.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know anything about sports.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it was weird because, um, this was the subject last night too, because I just started this last night.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh  I don't even know what I said last night.  So ...
L:  Oh, they had sports too?
R:  Mhm.
L:  [PAUSE] You there?
R:  Yes, yes, yes.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause I think it just hangs up when you're -- when it's over, right?
R:  Um, there's, um  this voice that comes on and says, like, "You have ten seconds to say goodbye".  I think.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  Do you know how many minutes it's been?
L:  Uh, no.
R:  I don't either.
L:  Maybe nine and a half. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  Um, I think it is almost ten, actually.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [PAUSE] so, is it really cold up there?
L:  Uh, yeah.  Not real bad.  It was nice today.  Well, [PAUSE] I guess we'll have to watch more baseball.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So we're --
R:  I guess, if this is going to be a more --
L:  The question of the day.
R:  Yeah.  Multiple times. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'll have to watch baseball every day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Then we'll --
