L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  How are you?
R:  I am good.
L:  My name is Cathy.
R:  My name is Sharon.
L:  Well, I'm glad to meet you.
R:  You too.
L:  Did you understand what [MN] they said at the -- that we're supposed to be talking about?
R:  Um, the p- -- the striking professionals, sport professionals striking.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I thought they said something about stripes and I was, like, wait a minute, what does that mean?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, the -- the professionals striking.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, how do y- --
R:  And -- and I guess the last question she asked was, do you think that the professionals should earn the high --
L:  The money that they do.
R:  -- the high pay that they get?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I don't because I think they're glorifying 'em.  But, you know, I guess that they take a ch- -- when they take a chance that they only play for, like, four or five years a lotta time, so they have to make their fortune in that four or five year time.  So, it's kind of a mixed -- mixed gender of -- of decision, whether it's [LAUGH] -- whether it's right or wrong, you know, they ...
L:  Yeah, right.  I agree with that.
R:  It's something the public will pay for.  So, as long as the public will pay for it, well, they're gonna be able to get it.
L:  Well, and the way it looks the public's paying for it.  So ...
R:  Yes, it is.  That's for sure.
L:  You know, unfortunately, we have lots of guys instead of the one we should have.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's for sure.  That's for --
L:  I just -- I guess I just think that, you know -- that they've -- they've turned 'em into guys, just like, you know, Michael Jordan.  I mean, yeah, he's a wonderful player.
R:  I know!
L:  But, you know, um, I mean, I think of u- --
R:  He's only human.
L:  I mean, you think of other people that -- that, you know, have other talents --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they don't get paid that kinda money.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  You know?  I mean, look at what --
R:  No.  And it doesn't make any difference whether they do wrong or right they still get that money.
L:  Well, and that's -- yeah, exactly right.
R:  You know?
L:  I mean, some of those people, uh, do pretty tacky things.
R:  Yep, yep.
L:  And to think that that is supposed to be somebody that the kids look up to.
R:  Right.
L:  To me is -- I think that they oughta have stricter laws on that, you know?
R:  Yeah, I do too.  Well, like -- like I'm watching --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- The District on TV right now and -- and ...
L:  Oh, my favorite show!  [LAUGH]
R:  Pardon?
L:  My favorite show.
R:  Your favorite show.  Are you -- where you calling from, or where you f- ...?
L:  From Iowa.
R:  Oh, I'm in Eugene, Oregon.
L:  Oh, my goodness!  Well, we're far away from each other then.
R:  Yeah, we are far away from each other.
L:  How 'bout that?
R:  A mixed -- of mixed opinions here.  Anyway --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm watching The District and it's, uh -- it's a story about a -- a hot shot fighter that comes into Washington DC and all the havoc that they -- he's causing and bringing in all the mobsters for the big fight and, you know --
L:  Oh, well.  There you go!
R: -- all this.
L:  See, that's part of what we're supposed to be talking about.
R:  And it's the ever typical -- yeah, it's a very typical thing, you know?
L:  Yep.
R:  I mean, these fighters, a lot of this, I think the fighting industry is probably the one you hear the most about being crooked, you know?  I'm sure the other ones have things happen that we don't ever hear about.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure they all do all.  Today there's just --
R:  But, you know --
L:  -- so many things that are crooked.
R:  Yeah.  But the fighting industry you always hear about one of the fighters getting into some kinda trouble or getting killed --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because somebody's doing something or -- you know?  And y- I -- really I strongly believe that about three or four of the fights that they do are thrown or set up anyway.  So ...
L:  Exactly.
R:  But they still make ...
L:  And I always figured they were connected to the Mob or something, you know?
R:  Yeah, right.  Right.  And they --
L:  It's their way to launder money.
R:  -- still make a small fortune.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, they make a lot of money, you know?
L:  Yep.
R:  Hundreds of do- -- I mean, millions of dollars sometimes.
L:  Well, I mean, you know, like when they've had the baseball strikes and whatever?
R:  [COUGH] Right.
L:  You know, I mean, people really look forward to that stuff not tha- that it should be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- your life --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- but unfortunately for some people it is.
R:  It is.  Right.
L:  And I can't judge everybody else, but --
R:  Well, and people that are in -- isolated, you know, they're the older people that can't get out and do things, you know?
L:  Right.  And enjoy it.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, and then they make the tick- tickets so expensive and --
R:  Right.  Mm.
L:  -- you know, and then they ahead and decide "Well, they didn't give me enough money.  So, let's strike".  You know?
R:  Yeah.  "Let's strike".  You know?  It's just ...
L:  And it's, like, "Okay!"
R:  Yeah, yeah.  [LAUGH]  Well, it's kinda, like, you know, the military isn't allowed to strike and sometimes I think that the sporting industry should be that way too, that they shouldn't be allowed to strike 'cause it's the public that's supporting 'em, you know, and so ...
L:  Well, yeah, 'cause it's nothing but entertainment.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  I mean, it really is.
R:  Right.
L:  It's entertainment.  Just a different kind of entertainment.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Well, it ...
L:  I don't know.  I just --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I just think that they get paid too much for what they are.
R:  Yep.  I think so too.
L:  And -- and --
R:  'Cause like you say, they're just humans.
L:  Right.  And exac- -- the -- they want -- that one guy that was the Bulls.  Oh, I can't even remember what his name is.  He was so disgusting.  The one with the blonde hair, that black guy with the blonde hair.
R:  Oh, I kn- ...
L:  That always got dressed up so weird.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, what is his name?  I can't think of his name either.
L:  I don't know.  But, I mean, I'm thinking --
R:  Well, you never knew whether he was gonna have blonde hair, or black hair, or red hair, or orange hair, or ...
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  Or pink.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Whatever.  Whatever he was --
L:  And I'm thinking okay, and then there's kids that have got T. shirts on, they're looking up this guy.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, that's one thing I will have to say for Michael Jordan.
R:  Right.
L:  Yes, he's made millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But at least the man -- unless we don't know about it --
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  -- on the surface, you know, he appears to be a good role model, at least for the kids.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  That's true.  Very true.  But, yeah, I -- I -- it -- it is sad.  It's a sad situation because the kids -- so many of the kids don't have parents that are really active in discussing whether it's a good or a bad role model and they just kinda -- kinda just --
L:  Oh, tell me.  I [MN] was in the school system for twenty three years.
R:  Oh, God!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They just kinda take -- you know, take what they have on the surface and go with it, and that's not always the best thing to do.  So --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- there you go!
L:  Well, and I think those people -- just like that one guy, whatever his name is, you know --
R:  I can't understand --
L:  -- they tend to have fads that kinda -- after the way they do things.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  So, then people start dressing in those baggy pants and --
R:  Oh, and I hate 'em!
L:  Oh, there we go!  [LAUGH] I know!
R:  Just hate 'em!
L:  I know.
R:  I have a sixteen year old grandson -- well, he's almost sixteen, Todd -- and he -- sometimes I'd like to just take him and strip him down bare, just to --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "Get on clothes that are decent, child!"
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  My son's twenty three, but he was doing that too.  He wasn't quite as bad as some of 'em because he got in, in the front part of it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But, um, it w- -- no, I just -- I d- -- you know, I [LAUGH] --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- I wanted him to dress like I did when I was at school, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Right.  And they don't do that.  They just don't do that --
L:  No.
R:  -- unfortunately.
L:  No.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think that's probably gonna ever get that, you know --
R:  No.
L:  -- that way ever again.
R:  No.  No.  We were -- it's just one of them things that we are --
L:  Well, I think ...
R:  -- everybody has their own -- their own style I think.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, I guess we just need to find out who we need to get a hold of these -- you know, since we got all the answers for this.
R:  Right.  Right.  We should just call the --
L:  And have 'em just change that because --
R:  Right.  And just tell 'em that you think that --
L:  -- it's wrong.
R:  [LAUGH] They need to change their rules.
L:  Because if women were running everything things [LAUGH] would run a lot better!
R:  God!  Wouldn't it be though?  But I don't think they've really had too many strikes where they've struck, you know, +struck -- the athletes have s- gone on struck, but ...
L:  No, just baseball I think.
R:  Every n- -- yeah, every ...
L:  I don't remember anything other than baseball.
R:  Yeah, the baseball and --
L:  Do you know?
R:  -- and, uh, you know, I know that -- like the act- -- the actors --
L:  Right.  The actors have done it.
R:  -- you know, they've gone on strike and --
L:  The actors have done it before.
R:  -- and, you know, they do that kind of on a regular basis.  But then they usually don't last too long.  But I guess, like you say, I think the -- the baseball is the only one that's really actually gone on strike.  And, of course, they went on strike, if I remember rightly, right at the --
L:  Right at the beginning of the season.
R:  -- at the ... yeah, right.  [SIGH]  Right when they were --
L:  And so all the men were really crabby!  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Right.  Right.  When everybody was really unhappy.  So ...
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  It makes it -- you know, they -- they got -- definitely got you over a barrel.
L:  That's for sure.
R:  Without any doubt they definitely --
L:  That's for sure.
R:  Yep.
L:  So, I -- I -- I don't know what else to say about it other than that I think its wrong, you know?
R:  It is wrong.  It is.
L:  [SIGH] So, we have to talk longer because it's not ten minutes yet.  [LAUGH]
R:  We have to go to ten minutes?  [LAUGH]
L:  It's almost too easy, you know?
R:  [COUGH] Right.  Well, it's fairly ...
L:  [COUGH] The last one I had was nine eleven and, man, that one was -- we could've talked for hours on that one.
R:  Well, you know, I'm -- I -- I -- the last one that I got I hung up before it come through because the ones -- I have gotten ones like -- oh, probably three weeks or so ago -- and I -- they asked for my number, my -- my --
L:  They aren't doing PINs anymore.
R:  -- special PIN number.
L:  Yeah.  They're not doing it.
R:  And I don't -- I never got a PIN number.
L:  Oh, you didn't?
R:  So, I just hung up, um --
L:  Oh, well, don't do -- well, just --
R:  -- you know?
L:  You don't have to worry about that anymore 'cause they aren't gonna --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they don't do that now.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  They do it by your telephone number I think.
R:  And so do they call ya every night?
L:  [SIGH] Well, I'll tell you what.  This is my sixth call.
R:  Tonight?
L:  There must be not a lot of people that like to call after, you know, ten o'clock.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  But I'm b- -- I'm much better at this time of night.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, what time --
L:  And I know I'm gonna be here, you know?
R:  What time is it there?
L:  Huh?
R:  What time is it there?
L:  It's, uh, twenty after eleven.  Oh, that's right, you're in Oregon.
R:  Yeah.  It's twenty af- --
L:  It's only twenty after nine where you're at.
R:  -- nine here.  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  Because I think I finished my last conversation the other night at five after twelve.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I got two phone calls in a row.
R:  Ah.
L:  [COUGH]  But ...
R:  Well, I know they will keep calling me back, if I don't accept it the first time they'll keep calling back.
L:  Well, they'll keep calling ya, and if you just go back in ...
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Oh, you can't 'cause you don't know your PIN.
R:  Uh-uh, no.
L:  Hm.
R:  I don't know my PIN.
L:  Well, you know, the eight hundred number, don't ya?
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  Oh, you don't?
R:  Mm mm.
L:  Well, let's talk about this thing a little bit more and I'll find it and give it to you, okay?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I gotta to hurry and find it though so that we don't get, like -- [inaudible] I don't have to tell you tell goodbye and tell you [several inaudible words] --
R:  [inaudible] what does the eight hundred number do?
L:  It's an -- i- it -- you can get to 'em to, like, find out what your number is so you can in and if you want to change your times or --
R:  Well, if they're not using ...
L:  -- tell 'em you want more calls, or whatever.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know?
R:  Well, if they're not using PINs any more then I should be fine.
L:  Well, I don't know -- well -- but I don't know how you get in now.  I don't know what you use.
R:  But they didn't use PINs tonight.  I mean, they didn't ask for a PIN number tonight.
L:  Do you have an email?
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, give me your email and I'll just --
R:  It's --
L:  -- email the whole letter to ya.
R:  -- It's O. lady O. -- O.L.A.D.Y.O. --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- at hotmail dot com.
L:  Okay.  I'll mail it to ya as soon as we get done talking, okay?
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  And then you won't have to worry about it.
R:  Yeah.  Because I don't know --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- 'cause I signed up for it, like, a long time ago and then I didn't hear anything.
L:  Right.
R:  And then, like I say, I started getting calls and they wanted a PIN number and I didn't have a PIN number.
L:  Well, see, I had to call and get mine too because they didn't th- -- I didn't get it.
R:  Ah!
L:  And it -- but then it was -- I knew what it was then and now we don't need it, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But by updating your, um -- your stuff, your availability and schedule and everything, it reactivates everything.
R:  Ah.
L:  Then you get a whole bunch of phone calls.  'Cause this is like my -- well, I say, my sixth one.
R:  And what is it they pay ya?
L:  Ten dollars for every ten minutes.
R:  Ah.
L:  So ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's good.  Do you do shopping or anything or ...?
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  Do you?
L:  Do you do that?
R:  So you do ...  Yeah, I do.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you do very much of that?
L:  Um, I try to.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's -- it's kinda hard around here.
R:  Where are you?
L:  Are you -- are you on any of the, um, uh, forums or anything?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Oh, you are?
