R:  Hi.
L:  Hello.
R:  How are you?  This is --
L:  Who's this?
R:  This is Judy in Charlotte, North Carolina.
L:  And I'm Becky and I'm in Texas.
R:  You're in Texas?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, boy, you're lucky 'cause it's a lot warmer in Texas than it is in Charlotte right now.
L:  Yeah, I know, I have a brother in law in -- in, uh, Reilly[?].
R:  Oh, well, what our topic is the salaries that sports figures makes?
L:  Yeah, the strikes.  Well, how do you feel about the strikes?  And I think they already make too much money. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, definitely.  Oh, the strikes like when the baseball players went on strike --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- for more money.
L:  Yeah.  I think they make way too much money.
R:  Well, and I don't even know that all started how every many years ago, whoever started making -- 'cause they didn't use to make that much money years ago.
L:  I know.
R:  And I -- I think they had strikes back then too but I --
L:  Yeah, 'cause plus what they make and then plus all those endorsements and stuff they get.
R:  Well, see that's just it.  It doesn't stop with the salary.
L:  Yeah, they get -- they like -- yeah.
R:  I mean, I think my husband told me that Michael Jordan made more money through Nike and, um, the hot dog company [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  The Arcromyer[?] and, uh, underwear company, Hanes --
L:   Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  -- and, uh -- but you know who makes more than he does even with endorsements is Tiger Woods.
L:  Oh, yes, that's true.
R:  He makes more in endorsements than Michael Jordan did.
L:  That's true and I -- you know, and I'm thinking about the -- you know, I'm always thinking about all the people that are homeless and --
R:  I know.
L:  -- stuff like that, you know.
R:  The only comfort I get is that I really like to think that these guys that make these millions of dollars do give a lot of it away to charity.  I don't think we hear about all the charities they give too but I've -- in my mind --
L:  Yeah, some of 'em -- some of 'em are real nice and do --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and they do do that but --
R:  And we hear about it.
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  But I'm hoping that a lot of 'em do anyway and we just don't know about it.  'Cause otherwise it makes no sense.
L:  Well, I don't know because I have -- just like, uh, you know, being a minority and all that and Michael -- Michael Jordan and he -- with having those shoes for two hundreds at one time [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and all the little peop- -- you know, all the little kids wanted these Michael Jordan tennis shoes.
R:  I know.
L:  And they were, you know --
R:  I know, I bought 'em myself for my boy.
L:  Yeah, and, you know, they were living have a fit --
R:  A hundred and some dollars.
L:  -- and you knows -- you know all those little kids are getting out of -- you know, they can't afford --
R:  But I don't really think that's really Michael Jordan's fault, I think that's Nike's fault.  They're the ones that probably --
L:  Yeah, but can they have a  -- can he have a say so like, I'm not --
R:  You would --
L:  -- 'cause like Shaquille O'Neil.
R:  You would -- yeah.
L:  He -- remember -- do you remember Shaquille O'Neil?
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  He would not endorse the shoes they were gonna cost so, you know -- 
R:  That's right.
L:  -- so much money.
R:  That's right, I think he went with -- I'm not sure, but maybe Adidas and they are less expensive.
L:  Yes, he would not do -- he wouldn't do it.
R:  You're right.
L:  So, you know, he could've -- I mean, he could've did something like that.  And to have his name I think that they would -- they would have did it.
R:  But I'm -- I'm just wondering if, like, if the basketball peop- you know, guys went on strike, [SIGH] do you think that when they did come back and they got more money that everybody would still be [SIGH], you know, buying the high price tickets and going to the games?
L:  I don't know.  I think everybody would be a little upset.
R:  Uh, well, because they were after that one baseball strike years ago.
L:  Yeah, I remember.
R:  I mean people were not going to the game.  I was so thrilled that they weren't.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because we don't have a baseball team here but I know I wouldn't have gone --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I gotta tell ya -- of course we lost our basketball team too.  They're in [LAUGH] New Orleans.  But, um, I don't think that if they went on strike for more money that I would be -- I -- I don't think I could buy a ticket and support them for a long, long time.
L:  I know.
R:  Ye -- uh, uh, now if they go on strike for other reasons, other than more money --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- like let's say -- the last time they were thinking about going on strike --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- was because of their benefits.  And they were gonna take away the retirement [SIGH] -- well, even then, you know, they make so much money now they don't even need retirement --
L:  Yeah, [MN] --
R:  -- as far as I'm concerned.
L:  Yeah, 'cause you can put away that much money that's like some --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's like a rich person, you know, paying poor -- you know, a ten thousand dollar interest policy or something, you know.
R:  I know.
L:  You know, you have the money --
R:  And they could take that --
L:  Yeah, and you could pay for your, you know, funeral and all that -- that's -- I don't know.
R:  They could take -- you're right they could take that salary and save it for their retirement, they don't need --
L:  Yeah, some of it.
R:  -- that extra for retir- -- and they make good retirements too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which I don't think they deserve [LAUGH] at all.
L:  [LAUGH] I don't either.
R:  But here's the other side of the coin, just like this young kid from Akron, Ohio, LeBron James --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- and we went to see him playing in Greenville not long ago.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Now, he is going to make probably five or six million just as a sign on bonus when -- 'cause you know they're gonna draft him into the NBA.
L:  Right.
R:  And he's right out of high school and he's very good.
L:  Mm.
R:  But let's say the first year when he gets his five or six million and then let's say he gets hurt and let's say it's something really drastic, like he breaks a leg --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or something that he cannot come back and play basketball.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Then, you know, it's like, "Okay, he's got plenty of money" [LAUGH]
L:  Mm, but that's --
R:  He do- --
L:  -- like Tina Turner, you know, her legs is insured for, you know, a whole [LAUGH] bunch of money.
R:  That's true.
L:  I've seen her on Oprah and I guess the -- those players have to ensure their bodies, you know, like that too.
R:  Yes, they do.  They do, that's right.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  The minute the sign, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I forget the name of the company that, um, yep, they're insured in case they can't play.
L:  Yeah, 'cause it [MN] --
R:  It's gotten way out of hand, you know, and I don't know what we can do about it.
L:  Yeah, it is way out of hand but that -- that's why I don't think that they should be giving into the strikes.
R:  Uh-uh, uh-uh.
L:  I don't think they should give into the strikes 'cause they're just making too -- too much money.
R:  And if they're gonna do that then, guess what, I think everybody should stop buying tickets and going.
L:  Yeah, because my -- and my thing too is look at the teachers --
R:  Look at the what?
L:  -- teachers -- the teachers -- the teachers don't make enough money --
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know it.  Well --
L:  And the teachers are in charge of your children it -- you know, the most important --
R:  Amen.
L:  -- thing to you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They need to give the teachers mon- more money.
R:  Amen, I have said for years and they make less here in, uh, the Carolinas than --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- up North.  We're from Ohio and they make a lot more up there.
L:  Oh.
R:  But I say those -- those and the policemen are the most underpaid people --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- in the world.
L:  -- for the jobs that they do.
R:  And that -- that's right.  
L:  And my daughter, she -- well, I have a daughter just graduated and I wanted her to teach but she said, "No way".  She said, "Mom, the teach- all the teachers are saying that after we graduate this is going to be their last year".
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, they can't afford to --
R:  Well, that's why we're -- we're in such a shortage here because, you know, first up we don't 'em --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- second off the kids are getting away with murder in this schools and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- in the junior high and high schools they're scared to death --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- you know.
L:  And this -- it -- it's the same that the -- the teachers are scared to go to work.
R:  Uh, why can't the teachers go on strike?
L:  Yeah, they need to strike.  And I -- I bet they've more back -- uh, people backing them in the --
R:  I'm serious.
L:  -- [LAUGH] bask- basketball players.
R:  If these multi million -- yeah, I'm serious.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I don't know if they're in a union or not but you would think that they'd be able to go on strike to get more money.
L:  Yeah, 'cause [MN] it is ridiculous.
R:  Uh, it is.  But I tell you what, some of the sports like even -- well, Nascar even, they're making good money too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I think basketball, baseball and football are the three top ones where --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's just gotten so far out of hand --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- that, you know, [SIGH] that I don't know if there's anything -- I -- I  mean they put a salary cap on the teams for football but it's not low enough [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  It's not.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't think basketball even has a salary cap.
L:  I don't think they do either.
R:  And I don't know --
L:  I'm doing a survey.
R:  -- I don't know about baseball, I don't know if they do or they don't but it's, um, it's not fair.
L:  How many -- oh, get my purse.  How -- how many, um, surveys have you done?
R:  Um, just two.
L:  Just two?
R:  Mhm.
L:  This is like my fourth one.
R:  Oh, is it really?
L:  Mhm.  Uh, well how did you hear about it?
R:  [SIGH] I don't even remember isn't that, uh --
L:  Do you do mystery shopping?
R:  Yes.
L:  There's -- well, that's how I heard about it.
R:  That's how I heard about it too.
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  But I -- I mean I really enjoyed my first -- I did two so far, actually, this would be my third one.
L:  Yeah, 'cause, uh, this is my fourth one and I think my first one I was so nervous I couldn't -- [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, were you?
L:  Yes --
R:  I've always gotten really, really nice people though.  And --
L:  Yeah, I have too and this -- this girl, um, she had them to -- to call her on her cellphone --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and so she was in the middle of something [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- and -- and they called her on her cellphone to do the survey and she --
R:  Oh, for goodness sake.
L:  Yeah.  And she's like, "I'm, you know, running around doing this or ..." but anyway what is -- [LAUGH]
R:  I don't even -- I mean I -- you know, I've about said all I can think to say about these, uh, professional athletes 'cause it just disgusts me the money they make and then they wanna go on strike and, you know, I don't know what else they hope to get out of us through this ten minute conversation but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't think there's probably too many people that are for them going on strike, you know.
L:  No, nobody -- they're -- no.
R:  And -- and, like I said, I -- I --
L:  And then a lot of us are, you know, just struggling to pay our bills and --
R:  No kidding.
L:  -- and everything and you thinking about -- they're complaining 'cause they make so many millions of dollars a year when, you know --
R:  I -- I almost wish I didn't know how much they made.
L:  Yeah, that's what I --
R:  I really do because it's just -- it puts a sour taste in my mouth about -- when I find out how well paid they are and --
L:  Yeah, as in --
R:  -- you know.  I almost wish I really didn't know, it's almost like just keep it a secret and don't tell me.
L:  Yeah.  And all the -- you know, all the younger kids they wanna go straight out of high school and so have been trying to get --
R:  Now -- yeah. 
L:  -- into -- in --
R:  And what does that tell our kids?
L:  I know.
R:  What does that tell our kids?
L:  Mhm.  And when they see the amount of money, you know, they're like, "Whoa" you know.
R:  And it's bad enough that they see -- like my one -- my little one loves Allen Iverson and he likes Jason ...
