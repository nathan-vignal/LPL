R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, this is, uh, Yorgen[?].
R:  Mhm.  Hello.
L:  [MN] Hi.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What's your name?
R:  Um, Indu.
L:  Indu?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay, I'm Yorgen.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, we -- we are talking about airport security?
R:  Mhm.  Airport security, yes.
L:  Yes, uh --
R:  What about it?  [LAUGH].
L:  Do you want me to -- to comment on this?
R:  Yeah, go ahead.
L:  Um, uh, the question again was, um, whether heightened airport security will make, uh, travelling more secure -- is that what it was?
R:  Like the way it's -- the way it is right now [NOISE]?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yes, it'd make it more secure because they're more strict about visitors coming in and -- 'cause I think now like you can't go inside the airport, you have to wait outside.
L:  Okay.
R:  Mhm, so, I mean, yeah, it's more secure now, so no terrorists could like ever come in or anything like that.
L:  Would -- would you -- would you think it's, uh -- I mean, in general, if someone really plans on, um, planting a bomb or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, that's the -- the heightened security would really prevent this.  I'm -- I'm not so sure, um --
R:  Well, I mean, the only way it could happen if one of the security is really like an actual terrorist, though, which I doubt that would happen, but, I mean, that's like the only way it could ever happen, so, yeah --
L:  Um, yeah, I'm -- I'm -- I'm s- -- I'm still -- I mean, as -- as -- as, uh, nine eleven showed us I -- these people are willing, um, to sacrifice their own lives --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, if I -- If I want to kill a lot of people in the airport, all I have to do is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I strap myself with, uh, explosives --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- walk inside and blow myself up in the middle of a crowd of, uh, two hundred people.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  I don't think that -- that -- that can be prevented at all, unless everybody is -- is really get- gets, um, searched every time, uh --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- and even then I -- I could simply board a bus --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- or a train from an airport --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- and do the same thing.  I guess it's, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- this is -- this all been done to sort of ease our minds a little bit, but, uh, in the end I'm not sure whether it will -- it may make it less easy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, for an attack, but, um, I'm not sh- -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm pretty certain that it cannot prevent an attack.  Maybe in the air --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but not on the ground.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I guess, yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Um, want our -- are we supposed to, um, t-, uh, really stretch this out?  I mean, does tha- -- from my -- from my end I'd -- I -- I really that's [LAUGH] -- that's the bottom line.
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] so --
L:  Any thoughts on your s- -- from, uh -- on your end.
R:  My end?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I mean, basically what I'm saying is, I mean, the way this -- the security is going on right now, I mean, that's fine.  I mean, they're more strict about it and I don't think, I mean, it's gonna happen ever again, unless like what you said, someone walk in and just kill themselves, but I mean, what are the odds of that, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I mean, I'm [SIGH] --
L:  Well, what -- wh- what were the odds about, uh, people hijacking planes --
R:  The odds --
L:  I'm not even -- I'm not even talking about, uh, flying to, uh, um, like the Twin Towers, I'm just -- I mean, there was security --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all along, um, regarding kidnapping, um, hijacking airplanes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, these guys, uh, as it appears, managed to, uh, hold airplanes -- entire airplanes hostage with box cutters.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It -- it seems -- it -- it -- it -- it's kind of hard for me to -- to, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to actually b- -- I mean, I don't know, I mean, we really don't know what actually did happen --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- but, um, it seems kind of -- I don't know, I -- I find it's -- it's -- I have trouble really, um, thinking that there are, um, all these people in the plane --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, on -- on the plane, um, just looking on while these guys just willy --
R:  [NOISE] Hey, can you just hang on for a second really quick? [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Yes.
R:  Hello.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, okay, go on.
L:  Uh, I'm still here.
R:  Yeah, okay, what were you saying?
L:  Well, I was -- I was saying that security was pretty tight before.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, these guys did not smuggle bombs onto the plane, they didn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have guns, they had, um, knives, box cutters --
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it seemed up to that point, security did work except now that on the list --
R:  Well, I mean, those securities -- they were terrorists though I mean, right?
L:  Oh, yeah, sure, but I mean, y- you can't tell by looking at people.
R:  Yeah, that's true, I mean, yeah.  You know like planning this whole nine eleven, I mean, that probably took sev- several years to plan.  I mean, that took like a long time to do for someone to plan all that out.
L:  Well, the co-ordination maybe -- the co-ordination --
R:  Yeah, the co-ord-, yeah, especially the co-ordination.
L:  -- but the actual act --
R:  Yeah, the actual act, yeah.
L:  -- I'm -- I'm not sure, um --
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I guess what it really is, is, um, you know, to ease our minds, but, um, um, I don't -- I don't know, I mean, I'm willing to go through all these routines as I have, um --
R:  What do you mean by routines?
L:  Um, in -- at -- at airports to, uh --
R:  The airport, okay.
L:  Yeah, the -- the security, like the checks and everything.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, even I think when you're going inside the airport they should still check, you know?  Because like the -- like the only place you can go in is like where the luggage like comes in or whatever, but you can't actually go inside where people go off to the plane.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, yeah, I mean I still think there should be security outside just like, right when you enter there should be some kind of security.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause, I mean, like you say someone can just walk in and like throw a bomb, right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, yeah, they -- there should be like security outside also, so --
L:  Well, I -- I -- I guess to certain degree there -- there is, um, um, but, uh, how f- -- I mean, how far will you stretch, like within a mile, within a couple of hu- -- within a hundred yards, or just in front of the doors?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, um, I -- and I've -- I've -- I'm convinced the next -- if there is a next -- a next attack, if you want to call it that --
R:  Hopefully it's not inevitable to happen.  I mean, I hope not, I mean --
L:  Um, it seems these people are very determined and, uh --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- uh, what- what's been going on with the war in Iraq, that's just --
R:  Iraq, yeah.  
L:  -- that -- it's not gonna make it easier.
R:  It's not, yeah.
L:  Um, but it may -- it may -- uh, they may hav- -- get more support --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just because of, you know, us, uh, invading a sovereign nation, so that's -- that's -- but I -- I -- I think the next thing will probably not be an airp- -port because of all the security.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I mean every time I -- I -- I don't live far from New York City and every time I take the train or drive in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, you have to take a -- go through one of the tunnels and, uh --
R:  One of the tunnels, yeah --
L:  Um --
R:  But, you know like this whole bomb thing, nine eleven, it ju- -- it w- -- you know, if it's not gonna happen in the airport.  It can always happen in a store, or like --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- a school or anything.
L:  Sure, but it's, um -- that's not -- I'm afraid that's not their -- that's not what they have in mind.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, they -- they gonna pick land marks.  They gonna pick -- they -- they'll pick, um, where maximum damage can be done.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, blowing up a little supermarket's not gonna do anything for them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, what's -- what's gonna be more ef- efficient from -- efficient quote unquote of course, from their point of view, and I -- I -- I'm telling you every time I go to New York --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm thinking of that.  I just can't help it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I go to New York and I'm thinking --
R:  I mean that's what I once thought so when they go when they're thinking about New York, or heading to New York, they're like, "Oh, you know, what if" you know.
L:  What if they blow up the George Washington Bridge and both tunnels?
R:  Ye- oh, yeah, I mean, you never know.
L:  Within an hour -- within an hour.
R:  Within an hour, okay.
L:  Yeah, then, I mean, that's practically is gonna cut off New York City from the rest of the country --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, at least by land.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, something like that I can see them doing because that would --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, that -- to show vulner- vul-, you know, how vulnerable we -- we are.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because that's -- that's -- that's probably what, uh, what their goal is, you know, to -- to -- to --
R:  I mean, they can always attack schools, I mean, they probably are -- aim for that also, you never know.
L:  Or anything, a hospital, I mean, uh --
R:  A ho- yeah exactly, a hospital also, I mean, that's like one of the factors also ...
