L:  Hi, I'm Janine.
R:  Hi, I'm Dixie.
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello? 
L:  Hi, um, I'm calling from California.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I haven't really made any changes, um, I was frightened and still kinda am but haven't really made any changes.
R:  Well, the changes I've made have been more in being -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- grateful and -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- appreciating -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- every day more than taking it for granted and -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- realising that the after affects of nine eleven [COUGH] have affected all of us.  My, ah, oldest daughter viewed what happened from her apartment window in New Jersey across the river.  My daughter in California's company had to close because the -- all their clients were mostly located in the towers and, um, she lost her job.  But, um, I think that I am much more cautious and aware.  I lock my car doors when I'm riding in the car driving now whereas I didn't before.
L:  I've [COUGH] -- I've become more patriotic, um, I wear my -- I have pins of, you know, American flags and I wear 'em on my shirt and I, um -- I have a flag on my car, um, and m- oh, the town I'm in the- they -- people are protesting against the protesters.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um [COUGH] that are for, you know, the people that are for the war, I'm -- we stand now on the corner and we hold the signs and everything so, you know, I -- I get involved with it as much as I can because I realized how important it is and I did realize, you know, [COUGH] that, um, it -- it -- it's crucial for you to -- to know how im- important it -- it is to live in this country and it -- it's -- 
R:  Well, prior to nine eleven we had never, ah, realized the fear of any one being as absurd as to attack us on our home land and, ah, when I was little people didn't lock their doors and you didn't lock you car door when you left some place and, um, it's not just terrorism but it's, ah, -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- it's the idea that there are people out there on this or that will do anything to get a buck to get whatever their fix is and -- and they have little regard for anybody else's life.
L:  Including their selves [LAUGH] 
R:  That's right, that's right -- 
L:  And that's another scary thing -- 
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  Because they're all suicidal --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, bombers and -- 
R:  Well, there's a lot of, ah, -- there's a lot of suicidal mindset that really doesn't have anything to do with Muslim religion or what the terrorists originally said with Bin Laden saying that "He didn't like that idea of the US people occupying Saudi Arabia" so that's what, you know, got him all bent out of shape to begin with and -- and -- 
R:  Well, I didn't know that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  And -- 
R:  I don't really watch the news I, ah, [COUGH] -- I, ah, just -- I -- I hear things here and there on the news and then on -- on AOL.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And, um, that's pretty much -- I try got to get too, you know [COUGH] into it because, you know, I -- I'm -- I get depressed as it is and it's -- it's horrible.
R:  It is, um, it is easy to become addicted to the terror -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and the horror of it.
L:  Yea- [MN] --  
R:  I realized was the news reporting on the -- the, ah, Iraq war that there was just so much of it I could take and -- and, um, it was about the same on nine eleven, I was craving -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for information that I would hope give hope and in watching all -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of the news casts about nine eleven it did make me more and more depressed but it was -- it was a shock, it was such a shock thing I couldn't not turn the TV off and I couldn't stand to watch it.
L:  Yeah [COUGH] I was, um, the day of September eleventh my daughter was born on August twenty fourth [COUGH] so she wasn't even a month old and I was sitting in the living room and -- at my aunt's house and that's, you know, when my -- my cousin pointed it out to me, I was like, "No, no, whatever, you know, you're just, you know, exaggerating" because, you know, he was making a big deal out of it and then I was watching -- started watching it and I was like, "Oh, my God, you know, it was like, what did I do, I brought my daughter into this word and [COUGH] now we're --" because in my mind I though we were going to go to war for sure, you know, that day.  So, I was just, you know, I was terrified but, um, it -- it eased off because, you know, it's -- it's -- I -- I feel that, um, my -- my country is protecting me and I have faith in it, so. 
R:  Well, I really appreciate the fact that our leadership has -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- has been as adamant about saying we're just aren't going to allow this sort of thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And even though they have not, um, found for sure that Bin Laden's out of the picture -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, they, you know, put the quahedis[?] on his ability to continue and do more, but, ah, the cells of people who are the offshoots of -- and little individual cells of terrorists are crazy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they are --  
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- still existing and I was not really aware that it was -- 
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- as easy for them to exist in this country as it seems to have been and I just really applaud everyone whose perking up their ears and providing information for fire departments and police departments an- and information for people, it's just -- it's just really sad that my granddaughter who's now in the third grade is learning wh- you know, what in school there needs to be doing if there's -- they see any white powder anywhere --  
L:  [COUGH]  
R:  -- or, you know [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  And, um, -- and I remember as a child -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  It was during, ah, right after world war two we had nuclear bomb drills where at school we were drilling and -- and rehearsing to get -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- under the desk to hide from a nuclear attack.
L:  Oh, goodness.  I, um, [COUGH] after the September eleventh, I will just give you an idea how scared I was [LAUGH].  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Um, I got some mail and I opened a letter and, you know, I don't know what it was, it wasn't anthrax obviously because I'm here today [LAUGH]  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, but powder flew out of it and I was like, "Oh, my goodness" [LAUGH] and then, you know, that's happened to me twice and I think -- I don't know what it is, but it's not anthrax [LAUGH] but, ah --  
R:  Well, my goodness, I mean that's really strange because what in the world would cause such a thing unless somebody deliberately [NOISE] was -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- trying to be nasty? 
L:  Yeah, well, that's what I think it might be, um, ...  
R:  Just people having a little fun with --
L:  Yeah.   
R:  -- with terrifying people.
L:  I -- it probably -- I mean it -- it terrified me the first time.  I actually threw -- because I was in the car and I opened up my mail and I wasn't driving, thank God, [LAUGH] --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I probably would have wrecked, um, and I threw the letter out my window and I mean I was like really, really upset and I told my grandfather and he said, "You need to turn around and go back, pick it up."  All I was -- I was just wondering, you know -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- if I got that then who else in my complex would have?  So I went straight down to my friend's house and I was, like, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- "Don't open any mail, let me see before you open it," but obviously it was really nothing. [COUGH] 
R:  It was just a hoax.
L:  Yeah, [MN] most likely [COUGH] because I mean -- I -- I can't see why anybody would want to do that but, ah, you know [LAUGH]   
R:  Well, that's what really is so [MN] unbelievable is that people will just --   
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- it doesn't matter who the recipient is, they're just doing it and -- and whoever gets the letter, you know, a resident of this apartment is the one who is targeting.  I don't understand what the pay off is for people who do that.
L:  Well, I was the only one in the complex that, um, actually got a letter that was like that, um, that was from that mailer, everybody else, they didn't get a letter from that -- from that [MN] -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the person who mailed it, so.  And it was a business letter, so, I mean I can't remember for the life of me where it was from, but it wasn't from a company I'd ever heard of, it was some kind of advertisement --
