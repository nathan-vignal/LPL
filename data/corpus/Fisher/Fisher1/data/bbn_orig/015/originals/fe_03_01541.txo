R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Tammy from Washington.
R:  I'm Irene and I'm in Ohio.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm doing fine.
R:  That's good.  Um, I missed part of that topic, uh, was it like do we -- what we -- do players deserve the salaries they get?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, that's a terrible one to ask because, you know, naturally I'm gonna say, "Absolutely not". 
L:  Uh, uh, I'm with you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm with you, uh, on that -- on that.  You know, it's unbelievable how much money these people, uh, get, you know.  Here where I am, you know, we have the Seattle Mariners --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I took my boy sometimes, you know, to the games and, uh, you know, sometimes we try to get the boys to talk with one of them.  They think that they are higher than, you know, almighty.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  They -- they don't wanna talk to you.  And like, you know, these kids and us pay for -- for you, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Over here they pay, you know, supporters and they treat them so bad.  And it's like, jeeze.  I hear that, uh -- I don't know if you hear of Alex Rodriguez?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, now he have like the -- he's, uh, paid -- it's like higher than the whole team in Florida.
R:  Wow.
L:  I -- I -- I was like, "What in the world". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You know, I -- their -- their egos have gotten as big as their salaries.
L:  Yes.
R:  And it's so ridiculous because, uh, um, I used to love going to see the Cleveland Indians --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, especially when they were playing Atlanta Braves.  I love Atlanta Braves.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, they -- they just, um -- the -- the ticket prices are just through the roof and then they -- they have the nerve to come on TV and say, you know, "We've got some great deals on tickets".  And they're talking about this expensive ticket but it's cheaper than the others, in the bleachers!
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  But I don't think so. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  And, you know, over here we used to have the Kendal.  I used to love going to the Kendal.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, you pay seven dollars and you were like in the second level and you could see very good, right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, now they make the Safeco[?] field and you go over there and I think the cheapest ticket is, uh, I think, fourteen or something like that --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and you get like way in the boonies, you can't see and, uh, the food, you know, just going with my boys and I and it's just like, you know, oh, close to a hundred dollars just to -- to see a game over there.  It's like it's not worth it.
R:  No, and -- you know, and the sad part is, as far as I'm concerned, that the people who deserve more money don't get it.
L:  Yes, exactly.
R:  Like -- like teachers or police or firemen or you know.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, over here like we voted not to build that Safeco field and, of course, they found the money to build it even though everybody voted that they didn't wanna do this.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, for god's sake, you know, we voted for the teachers to get the money to -- you know, it passed but the teachers they took some other stuff out so actually they ended up with less money than they should be getting.  And it's like unbelievable.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, that -- that we put athletes on top of teachers which, you know, if it wasn't for teachers some of these kids would not be where they're at right now, you know.
R:  Isn't that the truth?
L:  Yes.  I don't know, it's just like unbelievable what these people -- I -- you know, I don't follow sports that much.  My kids do [LAUGH] like crazy.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] My husband he doesn't want -- you know he doesn't watch football or baseball or golf, none of that.
R:  Isn't that wonderful?
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, you know, when it comes to Superbowl my husband's like I don't wanna be in the house 'cause the boys will be [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- taking over the TV you -- you know. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm like, "I'm going with you" whatever, I'd -- you know, it -- but, uh, you know, these -- these sport athletes it's unbelievable what they get for -- and how they're treated, how much, uh, you know, they get away with stuff.
R:  Yeah, because we had -- we had unfortunately Albert Bell here --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for the -- for the longest time and, um, you know, the -- the way he treated people and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and spoke to the audience and whatnot, uh, totally irreverent.  And, uh, to think, you know, people were -- were paying his salary for him to treat them that way.
L:  Yes.  We are -- I -- I -- years ago we used to have a player over here, was Joey Cora[?] and he was very nice, very nice player and, you know, he will talk to anyone and he's -- he's from Puerto Rico and I speak Spanish, I'm from Panama, so I used to have a, like, a -- a dance thing for, uh, a show that he worked for kids.  So, I would go over there and they will bring -- he will bring all the Spanish players.
R:  Mm.
L:  Well, uh, Alex Rodriguez was there and people were trying to get the attention of all the players.  Of course everybody came and talked to people and came to the actual -- where they were and shake hands except Alex.  
R:  Wow.
L:  He will not do it.  He will not turn around.  My sister who was sixteen at the time wanted the autograph and, uh, his girlfriend came over and take the ball and give it to him and he will not sign it.
R:  Oh.
L:  And then suddenly the girl, his girlfriend, say something on his ear and then he signed the ball and then throw it to my sister.
R:  Hm.
L:  But other than that he will not deal with anyone.  So, since that day I'm like, "I don't want nothing to do with you". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm like, "I won't buy your cards, I won't do anything" you know, that's rude, you know, and why can't you turn around and tell people hi, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you know, just spend a little bit of time.  Everybody else is doing it, even team members from other -- other, you know, all the states, all the teams --
R:  Yeah.
L:  They were being nice to everybody but not him.
R:  Well, you know, I think that if -- if people stopped paying these high prices for tickets --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- just refuse to go to the games --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- then the players salaries would have to be lowered and maybe they would become a little more humble.
L:  Yes, that is true.  Some of these people need to be bring -- they need to bring down, you know, it's just unbelievable how they think that they can -- they are higher than anybody else because they get paid a little bit, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, some of these people, some of these players they were -- when they grew up they were poor.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, they are all average, you know, and now that they get even more because they play baseball they think everybody else is just nothing.
R:  Mhm.  And yet they were in that same position and didn't like it.
L:  Yes.  And -- and now, you know, the people that aren't in the same posit- position they used to be they're trying to get the money together to go see them and they treat the so bad.  But [MN] doesn't make sense, excuse me, trying to get rid of this cold. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's going around in my house so it's like --
R:  Wow.
L:  Oh, boy.  But do you go to the games a lot?
R:  Uh, no, I pretty much stopped going.
L:  Yeah, it -- it's not fun anymore.
R:  No.  I mean it used to be a sport and it used to be enjoyable.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, it's not anymore.
L:  You know, once in awhile I will see it, like, it -- in the TV but I don't sit down and see the whole thing only if my boys leave it on or -- but, you know, it's like, "Why bother" you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not the same, you know, it use- -- it used to be so much fun to go, you know, the whole family and have fun but now it's like, jeeze, you -- you have to work a whole week just to [LAUGH] see one day.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, uh, you know, watching baseball in the stadium.  That's unbelievable.
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  You know, my husband refused to go to the Safeco -- Safeco field over here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He only went for my -- my two nephews graduations 'cause the graduation ceremonies were there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] And that's it.  He said, "He's not paying to there". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Good for him.
L:  Well --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He's still a little sad about his Kendal [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He grew up here so he was like going all the time and, you know, we were lucky to -- to come up here, move back up here before they destroy it.  But it was fun going there.
R:  Mm.  So, you're from Panama?
L:  Yes, I am.
R:  Do they -- this is gonna sound stupid but do they have baseball teams there too?
L:  They -- they do but not as big.  It's more -- people are more into soccer over there.
R:  Oh.
L:  We do it -- there's a Panamanian player here but I can't remember what team, what he -- that he is.  I know he -- 'cause I was -- I was buying his own cards and I -- you know, someone -- I can't remember what [inaudible] Pacific -- I'm sorry, Pacific have like different players with the country where they were from --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then I saw that one was from Panama.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, I know -- but at this time I was trying to tell my sisters not that many Bings here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I'm thinking it's a player to that his last name is Bing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was telling her, I said, "Hey, maybe he's related".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because, uh, I found two Bings in Washington and Florida --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they happened to be my family.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And there's only two of them over there.
R:  Mm.
L:  It was like, "Wow". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's like ...
