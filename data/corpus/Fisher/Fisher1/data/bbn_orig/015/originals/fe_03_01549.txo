L:  Hi, I'm Michelle
R:  Hi, I'm Alta and I could not understand what she's saying about the subject.  Was -- is it something to do with athletes?
L:  Yeah, she wants to know if you think that they deserve the high paying, um, salaries that they receive. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, I see.  Mm.
L:  I don't.  I -- I think that, uh, firemen and policemen and, um, teachers should get paid big money.  I don't think athletes should.  Personally they put their life on the line everyday for people and, um, athletes they don't do anything but entertain.  And I think --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they're overly paid.
R:  Well, you have a lot, uh, make a lot of common sense as far as I'm concerned.  I don't whether you could come with a valid argument for making, um, teachers and policemen and firemen, which fully deserve --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- much more than they get, uh, equivalent, um, what athletes get or what someone else gets, mainly because athletes train -- uh, I'm just -- I'm trying to figure out there's just no way it -- it could come out that way even though maybe we think they deserve --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm trying to say I guess --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, no I don't think they deserve as much as they get, um, any more than I believe, uh, CEOs of --
L:  Corporations get it.
R:  -- corporations deserve what they get.
L:  I agree too.  I think that it should be evenly -- I don't know just when I hear that they make billions of dollars --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for hitting a ball --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that to me it -- it -- it's so ridiculous that I can't even believe that it's actually -- it's -- it's -- you know, that it's really reality and yet I -- I think that there's so many other deserving --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- you know, of that that I just -- I don't know, to me it -- it's ridiculous.  I don't even like baseball or football or any those type of sports so I don't entertain myself in 'em.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so I don't think the cost of what they make is -- uh, it's just bizarre.  I mean, come on, get real.  I mean all it is is entertainment and they get paid for much for entertaining, you know.
R:  Well, so do entertainers.  That's another thing.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, it --
L:  Yeah, and I like I said --
R:  -- really is kind of unfair, um, and yet, of course, there are people who will argue that, uh, the more education you have, the more training, the more rigorous training you have, um, and that sort of thing, the more you're in the public's eye, you deserve more.
L:  Yeah, but what kind of training --
R:  We don't really agree with that --
L:  No, I -- I would agree if I would say that an actress or an actor goes through, uh, many years of college, like a doctor.  I think a doctor is well paid.  I think they should be.  They go through eight years of college --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, it's not like they sit back and say, "Hey, you owe me" you know what I mean?
R:  Right.
L:  I mean they really do, they go through a lot of training and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, athletes, I'm sorry, they don't -- they're not as committed, they're -- they're not long term, they seasonal so they're not even doing it year round.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Wh- where you've got a doctor that does it twenty four seven, you know what I mean?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and that's why I think it's unfair.  In that respect as well I don't think that --
R:  Well, there's another aspect to their high salaries.  It makes the sports too expensive for the average person --
L:  To even go.
R:  -- to go to.  Now, I'm past the stage where I'm interested in going to sports per se but -- or maybe I never was --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- but a lot of families cannot afford to take their children to ball games.  
L:  Right, right.
R:  A lot of middle class or lower class who would like to find that way to entertain themselves --
L:  Right.
R:  -- can't afford it.
L:  That's true.
R:  They absolutely cannot afford it.
L:  Because the tickets run --
R:  So, in that respect they're very overpaid also --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because it costs, uh, everybody too much to give them that kind of money.
L:  Not to mention the items when you there [NOISE] like a regular hot dog's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- gonna cost you five dollars, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  I mean, who could afford to eat there. [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  And I think that's a bit too much if you ask me, you know.
R:  Oh yeah, the whole thing -- the whole thing is much too much.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I agree.  In fact I think that was one of the reasons that a lot of people said that the baseball teams would end alienating themselves so much when they went on strike.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That in the end they would -- they would destroy themselves because they already were out pricing -- you know, pricing themselves out of the market and then when they went on strike for more money or more ability to get more money --
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, then that only made it harder on the, uh, people who would -- who -- who really pay their salaries.
L:  Exactly, that -- you're exactly right because that is -- we are the ones that pay their salaries.
R:  That's right.
L:  If -- if we go, um, we're paying it in our ticket price.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, again, like I said I won't even -- unless the tickets are given --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I don't go.  We don't go, we don't even -- like, uh, the Atlanta Braves, here in Georgia, they're, um, they're still highly paid.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I can remember when we first, uh, moved to Georgia they did not -- the games were so cheap that people gave away the tickets.  They didn't even -- I mean Atlanta Brave weren't even a game that -- hardly the stadiums were even -- uh, maybe four hundred people at the most.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It was -- it was a big joke.  And now, because they got famous, you know, uh, baseball players in there, now you can't even get a seat and nobody's gonna give you a ticket.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know what I mean and it's just how it turned so drastically and then these guys are making two point three million dollars a year [LAUGH] to hit a baseball.  I just -- uh, I just think it's ridiculous.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I think that the money should -- it's in the wrong direction, you know, it's more to the wrong people, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as far as I'm concerned.
R:  It seems to be that in the case of a lot of different --
L:  Aspects.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, teachers are definitely underpaid.  Nurses are not only underpaid but under appreciated.
L:  Yes, absolutely.
R:  Uh, firemen and policemen, uh, they're lives are on the line, um --
L:  Daily.
R:  -- or the military.
L:  Oh, absolutely!
R:  They're taking away everything from the military --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- over the years.  Uh, my husband's a retired military man.  Okay, they've taken away --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- things they promised them years ago.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, um, and -- and the new guys coming in, um, they can't live.  The enlisted men can't live on the salaries.  A lot of them are on food stamps to boot.
L:  Oh, gee.
R:  Because they move you around so much.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, there's a lot of inequity --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in the whole [LAUGH] -- in our whole system.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Of course, when you stop to think about it, it's that way all over the world.  There's no --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there's no place [LAUGH] that's equitable, no matter where you go.
L:  That's true.  That is true.
R:  And apparently we have it better than anybody else.
L:  And that's true and no complaints as far as I'm concerned on that part.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, I enjoy my freedom and -- and I wouldn't -- I don't take that for granted but, uh --
R:  No.
L:  -- I do, you know, I do appreciate the military and I appreciate the men.  Actually, um, me and my husband were talking the other day about I thought a military man was in the restaurant and I was going to get up and shake his hand 'cause to me, you know, a lot of people, maybe they don't see that person but I don't have to have someone in my family to appreciate what they do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because, you know, they're fighting for our rights and our freedom and other --
R:  I'm the same way with --
L:  -- countries don't have it.
R:  -- policemen and firemen and --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  And all of them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean when you think about it --
R:  Well, nurses and teachers, look at what teachers put up with.
L:  Yeah and they --
R:  Look what nurses put up with --
L:  -- they're with our children.
R:  -- from the doctors themselves.
L:  Yeah, and look at -- they put up with our children.  I mean they take our children and have, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- our children for eight hours a day [LAUGH], you know.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  There doesn't seem to be any fair way to, uh --
L:  Well, maybe if people stopped --
R:  -- pay the ones who really deserve --
L:  -- paying for the tickets.
R:  -- it more than the others [LAUGH].
L:  Well, maybe if people would stop pay- paying for the tickets and saying, "You know what, I think that's an outrageous amount" and maybe if they just started saying, you know, we don't need to pay these people that we need, you know, ticket towards who really needs to pay -- you know, be paid for that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because --
R:  You know and they won't do it.
L:  -- we're really paying into it.
R:  They won't do it because -- we live in Florida --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we're retired --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh, the teams come down here for their winter training.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, those seats for the Phillies and the Baltimore and all of those, the Atlanta --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when they're down here those seats are all completely filled.
L:  Can you believe that?  Mm.
R:  And -- and, you know, it is expensive --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, as you say, you can't even afford, well, you know, a drink.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Blazing hot and the drinks and the -- and -- and any food and that sort of thing and they -- they still come.  They still fill the seats.  So, as long as they're gonna do it --
L:  They're going to continue to --
R:  -- they're gonna -- they're gonna take everything they get.  Anybody in business is gonna ta- take all the market will bear.
L:  Yep, you're right.
R:  And I don't think there's a darn thing you [LAUGH] can do about it.
L:  [LAUGH] No, but we can voice our opinion, that's for sure [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, and that's exactly -- actually what they're doing is giving a subject matter -- uh, from what I understand ...
