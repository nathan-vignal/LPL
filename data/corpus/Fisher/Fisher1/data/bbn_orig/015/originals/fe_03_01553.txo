R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, ah, my name is John.  What's yours?
L:  Ah, Gail.
R:  Oh, hi.  Okay, topic of conversation, ah, did you catch that about the professional athletes striking?
L:  Yeah, I heard about that.
R:  I mean, I didn't -- I didn't exactly catch exactly what the topic was as far as -- 
L:  Yes, about them, um, striking.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  They want to know what -- what our opinion is about them striking.  How people can --
R:  My opi- my opinion on the -- the whole striking thing is I think they happen, you know, they're pretty -- pretty much overpaid but I do understand some of the reasons that they do it.  It's, you know, whether you would think that, ah, they could find another way, you know, to, ah, you know, come to some sort of a compromise rather than striking.
L:  Yeah.  What is the reasons that they're striking though?  They want to get paid more or ... [LAUGH]
R:  I don't think it has as much to do with more money as, "Ooh, you know, it's the power", I think the -- you know, there's always been a power struggle between the owners and the, ah, especially the unions.
L:  Team.
R:  Yeah, the players unions, depending on the sport.  Um, you know, different sports I believe, you know, that they have different reasons behind, you know, what they're doing and I guess I have more, um, sympathy for some sports versus others.
L:  Right.
R:  Baseball players I don't have a whole lot of sympathy for whatsoever because they don't -- there's -- there's too much, um, inequities in the way the baseball players are -- are being paid as far as, ah, they don't have, um -- what am I trying -- revenue sharing amongst the teams to even things out so that makes it pretty uncompetitive between the teams so, you know, that's one of the reasons I think baseball is dying.
L:  All right.  Well, what about foot- is it football too?  Is it mostly all the athletes?
R:  Well, football, they haven't had a strike in a while.  I don't think they are going to have a problem with it because football number one does have revenue sharing, I think that's why you see parity in the league.
L:  Oh, all right.  Ah, I say -- I was just looking it up on the web, seeing what it says about them.  [LAUGH] But I guess, I mean, whenever there's a union, you're going to -- I mean, if you have a union and you have, you know, the heads and you have the union close to the unions there to back you up basically, you know -- 
R:  Yeah, well, I mean, that's -- that's the reason behind it.  But, I mean, before they had the baseball union per se, the owners did have way too much power.  They did, you know, abuse the players back in the, you know, earlier part of the century, up right through into the sixties when they had the first strike.
L:  Oh, all right.
R:  So, I mean, at that point, I -- I wouldn't, ah, you know, I didn't have a problem with them striking only in that, ah, -- you know, I think they kind of needed to but that was also -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the point at which, ah, player salaries started to inflate tremendously.
L:  Oh, I see, oh, all right.  So basically it is the baseball players that are striking or -- 
R:  Well, nobody is striking that I know of right now.  And honestly, with the player strikes and everything, I don't pay much attention to professional sports any more other than football.  I haven't been a basketball fan for eons.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ever since I was a youngster and baseball too, although I still, you know, like the game, like to play it.  It's kind of a boring game. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, it is, I know it.  Yeah, I know.
R:  I mean, I've -- I've become more of a soccer fan believe it or not.
L:  All right.
R:  For somebody, I mean -- I'm like forty years old for somebody to pick up on soccer, you know, at an older age, you know, you'd expect somebody like me to be a baseball fan, but the fact the players at this point they are not the big stars yet and I think they -- they work harder.
L:  Yeah, all right.  I'm not too much into sports. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I -- I was kind of getting the, um, the impression that this might not have been a real comfortable topic for you. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, really I don't really know much about sports.  I mean, I know like NASCAR and stuff like that. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Where -- where are you from?
L:  Rhode Island.
R:  Oh.  I wouldn't have -- I would not have picked that out.  I mean, um, especially NASCAR tends to be a southern type of thing too.
L:  All right, yeah, I know it, but I guess our family has always been into, like, NASCAR and my brother's like a big -- big fan and he collects cars and stuff for them.  You know, Dayline, huh, he just, you know. So I know more about that, pretty much like the strike.  I don't really follow it 'cause I'm really not into sports.
R:  No.  Well, I -- honestly I don't follow them either.  If they -- if they're on strike I'm not paying much attention.  I'm still at the point where I participate in a lot of sports so I don't really pay attention and watch what's on TV.  Like I said, football, I'm a football fan.  I'm -- I'm in Wisconsin here so if you live here, you know, you bleed green and gold.  Everybody's a Packer fan.  You don't have a chance.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right. [MN]
R:  But other than that, I'm just outside of Milwaukee but as far as baseball goes, I could care less if the Brewers stay or go. 
L:  Yeah, exactly, I know. [LAUGH] All right.
R:  You know, and Rhode Island, what kind of -- you know, who -- what -- who do you follow in Rhode Island, the New York teams?
L:  Oh, no, the Patriots.
R:  Okay.
L:  In football, football, yeah.
R:  And then which is like -- 
L:  The Patriots.
R:  For baseball, would you be more following like Boston or ...  
L:  Um, honestly basically, ah, like, yeah, the Boston, um -- 
R:  Red Sox? 
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's who basically it would be, yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  But I really don't follow it at all. [LAUGH]
R:  No, you've got to go by what, you know, the people you know follow.
L:  Yeah, exactly, I know it.
R:  I mean, in some areas, especially on the east coast where a lot of the larger metropolitan areas are closer together, you can have people in the same area following different teams and it's a big fight whereas here -- 
L:  Oh, yeah, it is, yeah.
R:  You know, in Wisconsin it's like you've got one team for every sport, you know, and that's it.  There's not really much to, ah, argue about.  You go down -- like, my wife is actually from Illinois so -- and baseball, that's a big fight between the Sox fans and the, ah, Cubs fans so, you know, but -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Up here there's not a whole lot -- you know, that's more or less you listen to a sports talk show and all year round it's football.  You know, they do talk about how bad the Brewers are or how good the Bucks aren't but, you know, everything, you know, lives and dies by the Packers around here.  Although --
L:  All right.
R:  -- college sports -- yeah, college sports are pretty good around here too.  Um, they do have a certain amount of following for, ah, college basketball with Marquette[?] and college hockey in Wisconsin but -- and football of course again, but -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Now we are getting off topic but how long can you really talk about, you know, player strikes? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know it really -- I know really especially if you don't -- [LAUGH]  
R:  I mean, I can't even -- I'm a -- I'm fairly up on sports but I can't even remember the last time -- it was like two or three years ago that they talked about a possible lock out in, ah, baseball and, in -- in my opinion baseball does need revenue sharing because that's the only way you're going to get a team like Milwaukee or Cincinnati or Pittsburgh to be able to compete with a New York team that has all the money.
L:  Right, yeah, exactly, definitely, I hear you there, that have a good cash flow. [LAUGH]
R:  But as far as I'm concerned, I mean, baseball is just not -- it's not that exciting a sport.  You know, they just built two years ago a brand new stadium here in Milwaukee and it's -- as far as I'm concerned, I'm a traditionalist, and it's got that -- the -- the dome that opens and closes.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And that's been a -- that's been a fiasco here.  The thing all last year it leaked.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  Yeah, I mean, so and they had, ah, really big, you know, big attendance last year because of the first year that they had, you know, Miller Park open, so it was -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I went to one game and it just happened it was a Cubs game because my wife wanted to go see the Cubs.  I couldn't careless about it actually, seeing the Brewers and I didn't like, and I used to go to a couple of games every year and I didn't even like going there because it seemed like you were in a big garage.  It's just not baseball. 
L:  All right.  [NOISE] it's commercialized.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I grew up going -- my dad played baseball.  We had a lot of baseball leagues in the area in the summer time.  My dad was a big baseball player, I played baseball and I grew up with it out and it was, you know, kind of a community thing.  Everybody went out to the ball game on Sundays and, you know, there wasn't as much other things to do and that was -- that was really neat, but now, you know, there's so many other sports and I guess it's soccer has taken off here.  I don't know if soccer's big on the east coast, I know, ah, um, New England has a big, ah, MLS team.
L:  Mhm, well, ... 
R:  You're probably not real familiar with them either, huh?
L:  No, no.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Could you -- [LAUGH] yeah, I don't -- like I said, I don't follow sports, like, pretty much.  Mm.
R:  Well, what -- but you do follow NASCAR, huh?
L:  Mhm, yeah, we follow that.  Like Dayline, hot Junior and his father just passed, like, two years ago and, um, you know, I guess my father is a big fan.
