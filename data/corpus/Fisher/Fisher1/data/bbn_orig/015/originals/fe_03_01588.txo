R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  How you doing?
L:  Hi, I'm fine.  How you doing?
R:  All right.  
L:  That's good.
R:  My name is Si .
L:  Si?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh.  My name is Rae.
R:  How you doing, Rae?
L:  Okay.
R:  All right.
L:  Okay, let's see.  I don't [LAUGH] know too much about airport security --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- I'm not much of a traveler.
R:  I got you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It -- it's definitely gotten a little tight.  I know I haven't traveled in about maybe a year.
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] yeah, me either.
R:  But, um, it -- it -- it's definitely interesting because, you know, my name is Saed Mohamed --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I'm -- I'm -- I'm an African American --
L:  Right, okay.
R:  -- but still like, ah, you go to a -- an airport and, you know, and just the name alone, you know, you can --
L:  I'm sure that it gets a lot of attention [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah -- not, not a lot of attention -- not, you know, it's just a -- just a little, but, um, it definitely, um [NOISE] -- it takes -- it takes a lot longer --
L:  Right --
R:  -- you know, to, ah [NOISE] Hello.  Hello.  [NOISE]  Okay.  [NOISE]  It definitely takes a lot longer, um, [NOISE] for a -- to -- to get -- before you get your ticket and then you go wait and then, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you're -- you know your, um, your flight comes up and you get on, but now just to even get in, you know, you've got to have your IDs together --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you don't got IDs together then you don't fly.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And you know -- and, you kno- before, you know, you got to watch what you say and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you can't, you know, any lewd conduct or whatever, you know --
L:  Right, y- --
R:  --  you're not just looked at as a troublemaker but you're also looked at that, you know, it's possible this, possible that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah, I bet that's difficult for you [LAUGH].
R:  [MN] But, um -- I don't know if that -- I don't know if the heightened -- it depends on the hiring.  I don't know if the, um -- if it, uh, if the heightened security makes it safer because --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- remember for a long time after, um, after nine eleven they still had the same employees.  You know, they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- weren't 'em paying a lot of money and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know how it is if you're getting paid six dollars an hour, you figure I ain't, you know --
L:  They ain't all that motivated.
R:  Yeah, you're not all that motivated, you figure --
L:  Yeah, oh [LAUGH].
R:  But now I don't -- I don't know what exactly what the politics of it is now.  I don't know if that the -- if they're paying people more money or that they changed the -- anyway at the time when I had last traveled they still, uh, had the same employees and it wasn't much --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you see the people in the news, you know, the guy just to prove a point gets through with a little knife and all this kind of stuff.
L:  Yeah, yeah exactly.  And, um, and the training, I mean, may- -- I don't know, I don't -- it seemed like a lot of people really wasn't trained to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- be a airport attendant and a security person --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know, it's like that's what they have to be now these days --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and not everybody does have those skills to do that, you know.
R:  And then you've got to look at the -- the air -- you know, I -- now, see again -- I don't know, I think that maybe the -- in most cases the -- the Federal Government has taken over its security but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then you've got to realize that the airports, ah -- the airlines, they're the ones that's pay- -- that has the employees, they're the ones that's paying for it and th- -- I guess they look at, you know, how much money they're paying out and, you know --
L:  That's right, yeah, so it always comes down to that mighty dollar [LAUGH].
R:  It always comes down to the dollar.  They figure, well, we'll just give our employees a little more training or give them a little more money.  It depends.
L:  Just to please the government, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, if it's the government employees they probably get paid a little more money [NOISE], but they're all -- you know, it all goes down to personalities, you know? 
L:  Yeah, it does.
R:  You can have certain policies at -- at your particular job and then, you know, a person starts working that job and they're -- they're doing what they want to do, they're personalizing it --
L:  Mhm.  That's right.
R:  You know --
L:  That's so true.
R:  Probably [inaudible] --
L:  That's true in every sense. 
R:  -- probably jumped up a lot more.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because A- A- Arabs I'm sure didn't stop traveling just because of this, so --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- you know, but as far as it heightened -- making it better, I don't know.  It seems like, you know, for instance, um, it depends on how -- like for instance give you a perfect example.  You know, how France can sell a whole bunch of cars here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but all of -- a bunch of our cars were not sold there --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, it depends that, um, you know, the -- the guys that flew the planes in the World Trade Center, they got their training here.
L:  That's right.
R:  So, are we gonna -- if we're going to stop that kind of stuff then it makes it -- then, you know, maybe that'd make a difference but if we --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- make it easy for other people in other countries to get particular training here --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're just going to figure something out.
L:  That's right.
R:  Who's to say that, uh, they won't figure out how to -- how to -- you know -- just like they figured out how to crash the planes in the airport --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who's to say they won't figure out how to -- how to, you know, get through airport security [NOISE]?
L:  Get through the sep- sec- -- right exactly because -- that's right.
R:  You know, like you -- you know, you'd -- whatever you do at your job, you know, they train you for that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but then these [NOISE] terrorists, you know, they -- they tr- -- when they're being trained to do their deeds they're being trained just like it's a job too.
L:  They sure are and they're willing to die  for theirs [LAUGH].
R:  Definitely.  So, I don't know.  It really -- it really depends on how -- how smarter our government has gotten.
L:  Yeah, it is, it is.  Because, like you say, a lot of personalities go into it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you've got the money, you've got the training.  It's just -- it's a lot.
R:  And if you've got money today you can pretty much learn whatever it is you want to learn.
L:  And especially here in the US [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you know, we're too kind.
L:  And a lot of times, yeah, they'll train you for free too --
R:  Yeah.
L:   -- you can get a free education if you're non-American, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  And -- and it's funny -- yeah, and if you're non-American you -- you get the t- -- it seems like you get better opportunities than Americans do.  
L:  Right.
R:  I could be wrong about that but it seems that way.
L:  It seems like that to me too.
R:  It seems like it's easy for an Arab to get a Bodega[?] store -- you know --
L:  That's right --
R:  -- a corner store, than it is for me.
L:  That's exactly right.
R:  Now, maybe money has to do with that but then if it is the -- the case then it goes back to what we were b- both just saying, you know, money has a lot to do with it.
L:  Right, yeah, yeah.
R:  You know, so I don't know.
L:  But I don't know -- I don't know -- I mean, I c- -- about me not being a traveler, I guess if I had to fly tomorrow I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- would be a little bit more --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not nervous, maybe --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- apprehensive because -- because of nine eleven --
R:  You have to leave about two, three hours in advance --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just to stand in line.
L:  And I think all that new security stuff is just going to become a big headache too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just a big inconvenience for everybody.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Necessary.
R:  I think they only had like eleven marshals for -- for the entire United States to be traveling around on planes so, you know --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- a whole bunch of planes that these marshals aren't on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And now the government doesn't want to give pilots guns.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know, so I don't know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we'll -- we'll see about that.  I think some -- some airports are doing it or something like that.
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  But it's -- it's hard -- that's a -- that's a tough cookie to -- to -- to crack.  You know, how do you make sure you're secure, especially in something that -- that's so important --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and we've got no guarantees that they won't try that again.
L:  Yeah.  Just like the guy who got on the plane with the bomb in his shoes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Now, who would've thought to check somebody's shoes, you know?
R:  Definitely, definitely.
L:  Because they are so determined that they can go to any measure and it's like, right we have to outsmart them --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- in our thinking.
R:  Ah, yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's crazy.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It is definitely crazy and maybe it has a lot to do with our relations with Arab and Americans but also Arabs, uh, in other countries. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because Arabs definitely hate us, or rather, uh, uh, uh, Muslims -- a lot of Muslims [NOISE] in other countries they -- they definitely hate our guts.
L:  They sure do, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  In some -- some ways, uh, you know, we -- we don't know -- I -- I mean I'm down with my country one hundred percent --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but in reality we really don't know [NOISE] what our country does [NOISE] to other people.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, I mean?
L:  Because not everything is in a newspaper.
R:  Yeah, and every -- not --
L:  I'm sure they do a lot of underhanded stuff we don't know about.
R:  Exactly, and maybe some of those things they [NOISE] -- is necessary.  I don't know.
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  I'm not judging, but the -- the fact that, uh -- that so many, ah, Arabs and so many Muslims in other countries, uh, uh, hate us so much [NOISE] it's hard for me to believe that a lot of that is just unnecessary hate.
L:  Mhm.
R:  A lot of that has to come from somewhere,
L:  Right.
R:   -- you know.
L:  And a lot of it comes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- from, you know, they feel like we are Israel's friend and we're their enemy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Definitely so, you know, who's to know.  I -- it's just a -- you know, you wonder, "Well, where's the next, uh, enemy attack's going to come from", you know?
L:  Exactly, yeah.
R:  Is it going to be, uh, Muslims next time or is it going to be, you know.
L:  Yeah, because there's so many different sects and groups of --
R:  Mhm [NOISE].
L:  These little -- these terrorist people [LAUGH] running around you just never know.
R:  You never know.  You never know.  And that's something, I mean, if you've got a plane and you're crashing it into something you have a powerful weapon.
L:  Yes, you do.
R:  That's a powerful missile.
L:  Yes, and you've got to really, really, really psyched up to do that because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's really something [LAUGH].
R:  You know, and then, uh, you've got to figure, "Well, are -- are we -- are they going to -- you know, are we going to spread ourselves out thick?"  You know, I mean, suppose -- we -- we had the guys from, you know, Afghan- Afghanistan doing stuff to us then -- then now we -- we have the Iraqis who want to now -- you know, are we going to spread ourselves out real thick?  You know, at the same time that why we's going in this war --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, uh, you've got Korea, you know, --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- doing their thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, what are we going to do with, uh -- if we've got Korea and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- we've got another country and then we've got another country, you know, it's like, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] Like half the world was our enemy, you know --
R:  Yeah, you know, the -- the --
L:  -- how are we going to be able to defend ourselves?
R:  -- is this serious talk about going over to Syria now?
L:  Yeah, Syria.
R:  Like, you know, and I'm sure these soldiers are like, "What?"
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  You know, "We just got finished with Iraq, now we got to go over to ..." you know, so --
L:  Go into Syria, yeah.
R:  But, I don't know.  It's -- it's almost, you know, y- y- -- almost afraid that, you know, that the United States is going to go into like marshal law.  I don't know if you've been in New York City?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  But, uh, in New York now, you know, the security is evident now, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You can easily see, uh -- go in Manhattan -- in a lot of parts of Manhattan and see antiwar crafts, you know --
L:  Right, yeah --
R:  -- outside.
L:  I heard that on the news a lot, yeah.
R:  And that now -- you know -- and it's funny I go back and forth and you get used to it now.  Before I was like taken back, like "What?"  
L:  Right.
R:  You know, this is something you normally see in a desert or when, you know, w- -- now, you know, it's on the streets, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there's the movie theatre, there's the Macdonalds and there's the anti-war craft, you know, weapon.
L:  Wow.
R:  You've got the MPs, for instance, on, you know, at Thirty Fourth Street Penn Station, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you've got the cops and then you've got the MPs -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with their guns and then you've got the Special Forces guys --
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  -- and these guys aren't traveling they're -- that's their job to be there and, you know --
L:  That's right.
R:  So, it's like -- it's -- it's crazy.
L:  Wow.
R:   So, I can imagine that the airport right now --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is, you know, they're -- they're looking -- you -- you've got to -- you've got to watch the way you look, your gesture ...
