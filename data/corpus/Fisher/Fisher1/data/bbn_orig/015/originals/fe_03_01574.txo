L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  [COUGH] Hi.  How are you?
R:  Fine.  You?
L:  Yes, fine.  Just fine.  Uh, Darryl Blackstone --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- uh, Philadel- -- native Philadelphian.
R:  Oh.  Tim Young.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Same here, Philadelphia.
L:  Okay.  So, their topic is -- I -- I couldn't quite hear, it was a little muffled.  They said do we think --
R:  And that's the same thing I was wondering too.  It was a little muffled.  Something about airport security.
L:  If it is poor security, I believe, in relation to making the airways safer.
R:  And will it lessen terrorism?
L:  Lessen terro- terrorists.  Um, personally I think that, uh, what they're doing to air ser- -- airport security is pretty good.  They should've done it a long time ago.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, do I think that it's gonna make the airways safer?  Uh, not necessarily.  Um [COUGH], there's a couple of reasons why basically.  Um, people when they are diehard on, uh, doing something to you, you know, at the expense of their own life --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, there's not a whole lot you can do about that.
R:  [NOISE] Indeed, yeah.
L:  You know, there's -- there's not a whole lot.  Um, when they're that determined to get to you [LIPSMACK] all that you can do is just take, uh, you know, a few precautions, you know, like what they've done.
R:  Right.
L:  Like they kinda beef up security.  Um, air marshals, you know, they -- they put marshals on the planes now, or putting them on and they- they've started that kind of insulation.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, whether or not that will deter or ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it -- it adds a -- a certain level of security.  But, um --
R:  Exactly.  To --
L:  -- I don't -- I don't really think it's gonna do very much.
R:  Well, I think with the terrorism it will just divert their interest to some, you know -- other way of, uh, destroying our way of life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it -- it -- it is, uh -- I do Thai West Com and I was especially impressed this week in the [inaudible] of them training, they'd be carrying weapons now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they've fortified the doors.  Well, still that --
L:  Well, that should've always been in place.
R:  Even though th- --
L:  I've always thought that that was crazy.  Somebody can just go and basically kick the cabin door in --
R:  It's amazing they wait this long --
L:  -- to the cockpit.
R:  -- without just a --
L:  I mean, cockpit door.
R:  Yeah.  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  But, uh ...
R:  'Cause what you [inaudible] if you there.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I mean, um, I mean, that -- that's always seemed to be something that needed to be done.  Um, I think that at least one of the pilots should be armed as well.
R:  Exac- --
L:  I -- I think that should be, uh, mandatory.
R:  The only thing that disturbs me about that, [LAUGH] if it's used in a state of panic you could really have a catastrophe on your hand because the cabins are pressurized.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And -- [LAUGH]
L:  But, see, the thing is though, you know, they, uh -- with the, uh, sky marshal they -- there's -- there's a special type of bullet they developed to be used.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  And --
R:  Okay.  'Cause I wondered --
L:  -- see, the thing is --
R:  -- what if he misses his target?
L:  Hm?
R:  What if he misses the target he's aimed for --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- and it hits the -- you know?
L:  The bullets, they're designed to disintegrate upon impact.
R:  Oh, oh, okay. I'm kinda --
L:  You mean if they --
R:  -- I -- I didn't know that.
L:  Like, if they hit a super hard surface, I believe --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they -- they basically just disintegrate.
R:  Oh!
L:  Like, you know, if they were to hit, like, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the interior of the airplane or hit one of the windows the -- the bullets will disintegrate.  Um ...
R:  Oh, well, that's great.  I didn't know that.  Okay.
L:  But the thing is, is that if it flesh it will -- I think it penetrates a little, then it disintegrates upon, you know --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- not too much longer after the impact.
R:  Okay.
L:  Something like that.
R:  Oh, I see.  Okay.
L:  Um, yeah.  So, that will be keep 'em from, you know ...
R:  Well, that's -- that's -- that's really, uh -- adds a little security to it 'cause I was thinking, like, man --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you could really have tried to avert one situation, you could have, uh [SIGH] --
L:  And is riding in ...
R:  -- even a bigger one on your hand at that.
L:  That's right.  Pandora's box.
R:  You pressurize the cabin.  Okay.
L:  Mm.
R:  Well, that's -- that's a -- that's a good safety here.  But, uh, uh, do you fly often?
L:  No, I don't fly very often.
R:  I -- me neither.  Not really.
L:  Yeah.  Uh, not -- not, you know, very much at all.
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh, I have no real reason to and I haven't gone anywhere on vacation, uh, you know --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- that would require me to fly.
R:  Right, I see.
L:  Basically driving.
R:  Yeah.  That's basically the --
L:  Um, but I think that the airways, um ... I -- I think that they're -- you know, they've always been relatively safe.
R:  Ba- -- uh, well, uh, uh, statistically speaking they say that's one of the safest modes of traveling.
L:  Well, exactly.
R:  As far as, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, you know, um, fatal accidents.  When you consider, you know, trains and you consider, uh, cars --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- things like that.  It's just that usually when you have one the loss is greater because of the amount of people on there.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] That's what, you know.  But, uh, yeah, I'm not really much on air travel.  I like the rail system better.  I love the trains, yeah.
L:  Oh, no, I -- that -- that rail system scares me.  [LAUGH]
R:  Really?  Oh, man, I -- I love the train.  Just to be able to walk back and forth, be able to look out the window, watch the countryside.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I traveled back and forth to North Carolina during my college years and I fell in love with the rail.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  You know, I went to, uh, uh, Fisk, for a very short time.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  I went as a visiting student for a year.
R:  Is that Tennessee somewhere?
L:  Hm?
R:  Tennessee is it?
L:  Yeah, Tennessee.  National Tennessee.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.
L:  And I flew then and, uh, yeah, I -- I just like the, you know -- the -- the speed w- with which you're able to get from point A. to point B.
R:  Okay.  Yeah.  Most people do, right?
L:  And I always felt relatively safe.  I mean, my thinking is that, you know, if something is really gonna happen there's not a whole lot you can do to stop it.
R:  That -- well, that -- that's true.  That's true.
L:  You know, I mean, some things are predestined to happen, uh, you know, we all have an appointed time to check out.
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  And, uh, you know, when it's time to check out you will check out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, whether you want to or not.
R:  That's true.
L:  Whether you're ready or not.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's right.
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Regardless of what precautions you took --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, you will check out when it's time to check out.
R:  Well, I just think o- o- of who, uh, take the necessary precautions you could somehow lessen your chance of it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  Maybe not stop it.
L:  You mean prematurely is what you're talking about?
R:  Yeah, right.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  So, uh [NOISE], I'm just glad to see that [inaudible].  This country's in a state now, man, and everybody's like -- it's taking your s- -- people's social security away and, you know, for years we watched terrorism in other countries and to see hit home really, really kinda makes you put a lot of things in perspective, man, because, uh [LAUGH], we just never thought it would hit here.
L:  Mm.
R:  I think we took a lot of things for granted, man, and our sense is just walk around freely and watching other countries being hit with terrorism, man, and they've really rocked a lot of people, man, and, you know, they've actually hit home.  So, uh, this country really needed to heighten its security.  Planes are just, well, they're the first step.  They have a long way to go, man.  A lot of wh- -- and in other countries it's already -- it may be [inaudible] because they were hit with terrorism long before us.  So, we're really behind as far as security and safety precautions in air and on land, and -- and -- and some of our, uh -- our, uh, uh, um, monuments around the country.  So, this is really, really, uh, uh, gave [several inaudible words] the chance to just, you know, heighten their security awareness, you know, throughout the [NOISE] --
L:  Well, that's one of the things they really need to do.  I mean, that will help to make things safe just in general.  I mean, the thing is that -- that, you know, they basically let just about anybody come here.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, and, you know, that's not the issue.  The issue is, yeah, we want people to come and, you know, to see and to enjoy.  But the thing is, is that they don't keep track, close enough track on, you know, people come --
R:  There you go.  That's the key.
L:  -- they're only supposed to be here for a week --
R: [MN]
L:  -- they stay here for a couple of years, you know, they ain't got visas.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  So, it's like, what the hell?
R:  Entering into all kind of marriages just to -- they have -- they have just a business sort of side just for people to -- how -- how to stay in here legally.
L:  Mm.
R:  'Cause I've known -- I've known people who come here for college, man, and then once they get here and their visa run out, next thing you know they get lost in the system, man [LAUGH], and you know?  The United States have no ... uh, idea where they at.  But, uh, this is really, uh, um ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  ... cause them to really kind of, uh, close the gate so to speak and monitor more closely --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- whose coming in, where they're going once they get here, you know, and whether or not they're here illegally.  Uh, you know, this being a melting pot, as they say, man.  You know, I would hate to see it if they close the gate on everybody and just don't let nobody in except, you know, native Americans.  But, uh [LAUGH], hey, man, something has to be done, you know?  And, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think airport security is the first step in that.  But we have a long way to go, man.  And, uh, uh, other countries are light years ahead of us when it comes to, you know -- not your undeveloped country, but I mean your major, uh, super powers, uh, uh, they're, uh, light years ahead of us --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as far as, uh -- security wise, you know?  And they've manning, uh, uh, s- security airports in Israel, man, for, you know [LAUGH], years, you know?  [MN]  So ...
L:  Yep, yep, yep, yep.  But, uh, yeah, I guess that, uh, I'm -- I'm pretty happy.  I mean, that's a pretty open and shut deal.  I mean -- 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- um, i- in terms of the security on the airways, um ...  Yeah, I -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I think they've -- I think they've done just about all they can do.
R:  Well, between the sky marshal who might be on the plane --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- armed, and somebody in the cockpit -- cockpit --
L:  Well, yeah.  Then also they -- you know, then also, you know, you have the armed services are able to go.  I think the Air Force in particular are able -- or Army, um -- well, I think it's all of them.  But you c- -- they can shoot down a plane that does not respond to command if they're flying over a restricted air space.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that's so true.  Yeah.
L:  That's another issue, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in terms of, uh, security, uh, you know, securing the airways, uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and making air travel more safe.
R:  [inaudible] you know that[?]
L:  Safer.  Uh ...
R:  There is, uh, a lot of, uh
