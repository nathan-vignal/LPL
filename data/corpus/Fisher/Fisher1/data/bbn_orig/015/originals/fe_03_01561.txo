L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- my name is Alice.
R:  Mine is Laurie and I had this topic last night.
L:  Um, they called me about this last night and I didn't take it because I don't know anything at all about professional sports.  Um, this time I didn't answer the phone and my husband ha- just handed it off to me.  So, I didn't know that was the topic.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, it appears to be, um, sports and entertainers.  I personally don't know of anybody striking right now, and as for entertainment, I remember striking was up on Broadway.
L:  Yeah.  And I'm in the New York metro area and that was -- that was a big deal because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it -- it really, you know ...?
R:  And I figure that they had a legitimate gripe.
L:  I'm not completely sure of that.  Um [SIGH], the thing is that the, uh [SIGH], musicians who -- there are -- there are union rules in New York City, that a show that has any kind of music in it has to have a certain minimum number of musicians that get paid every show whether they really need it or not.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, it's kind of -- kind of an -- an iffy situation.
R:  Yeah.  And, um, but like you said, I -- evidently there's maybe some kind of a strike that's getting ready to happen in one of the sports because it was the sports and entertainment, but, now, mine was a little bit more in depth, or unless I missed it 'cause my husband passed the phone to me, about salaries, did you think that, uh, um -- they -- they di- --
L:  Um, I think most professional athletes get paid way too much.
R:  I do too.  [LAUGH]  Way, way too much.  I mean --
L:  I mean, you know --
R:  -- they get paid way too much just for breathing.
L:  -- you get paid twenty million dollars a year just for being tall enough to reach a basketball basket, you know?
R:  Yeah.  And, um, I just -- you know, to me it's crazy especially when, uh --
L:  And then they get into these things with -- with, you know, women and drugs and crashing their cars and --
R:  And walk away!  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like Diana Ross, falls over flat on her face and she -- she -- [LAUGH] they drag her home.
L:  Yeah, well ...
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  I'd have been in jail, in the back seat of a car [LAUGH] and handcuffed.  Um, but, um, like I say, I don't know of any strikes getting ready to come up.  I don't --
L:  No, I don't either.
R:  -- I don't keep up with sports, period.
L:  I don't either.  I hate sports.  [LAUGH]
R:  I- if they all -- I mean, the only thing that we ever watch -- I'm in Virginia -- and the only thing we ever watch is NASCAR.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it --
L:  The only thing I ever watch is, uh, sometimes I watch figure skating if I remember to turn it on.
R:  Yeah.  And that's -- that --
L:   'Cause it --
R:  -- I don't --
L:  -- you know, 'cause that's just pretty.
R:  Yeah.  I don't quite call that a sport.  I don't know what you would call that -- competition --
L:  Yeah.
R:   -- more than a sport.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Does that make sense?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, you know, they have to be very strong and -- and all that but, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, it's just pretty.
R:  And, uh, so they could stop playing football and basketball and baseball tomorrow and I wouldn't notice.
L:  Yeah.  As a matter of fact --
R:  Except that, uh --
L: -- there's -- there's a -- our local radio station that, uh, for -- for more than twenty years it's been an all news station and then last -- last year they became the official station for the New York Yankees.  So, all the New York Yankees games get broadcast, and I turn on the radio when I want to hear what the weather is, or -- or the headlines, or the traffic, and I get a baseball game instead and I get really annoyed.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  I don't want to listen to the damn baseball, you know?  I want to know what the weather's going to be!
R:  I know.  Well, I -- I -- on the website the other day I read, uh, the -- the topics, you know, you had other topics like pets and stuff like that?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was really hoping I wouldn't get sports again today.  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, the first one I got, oh, a -- a while ago, um, was about, uh, com- comedians.
R:  Mm.  [LIPSMACK] Uh, like I say, I --
L:  But that was -- that was back at the very beginning of the study.  I think it was before the New Year even.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I just now joined.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, I'm -- I'm in a complete blinder as to this.  Um, but like I said, uh, I know nothing about sports [LAUGH] or anybody, like I said, that's getting ready to strike, or anything.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know anything about that either.
R:  And I -- I don't even know -- or even in entertainment.  Like I said, I don't know of anybody out in California and Hollywood or anywhere getting ready to --
L:  I think there was some protests, there was some -- some performers in various fields that were gonna to, you know, not perform in order to protest against the war.  But, you know, the war's practically over now.  So, I mean, it would just make 'em look stupid.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Uh, you know, I didn't -- and d- way the way they was talking, they was just striking, you know, just like walking out and not, um -- not, uh, doing anything, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...  And I've said I don't know of any that are getting ready to strike right now, as far as entertainment.  And, um ... so, I'm at a complete loss and -- but I do think they get paid way too much for what they do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh ...
L:  And, you know, it used to be that professional athletes were kind of role models to kids.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  Not any more.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, except that the kids all wanna make that much money and get a contract for, uh, advertising sneakers, and they think that, you know, if they run around and, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have lots of girlfriends that they treat really mean, but buy them expensive presents and, you know --
R:  Well, our so- --
L:  -- do drugs and party and -- and generally, you know, if you have all the trappings of -- of the athlete's life you'll get famous and, of course, really if you get picked.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I knew, um ... some of 'em do champion for -- for better causes, but not a whole lot.
L:  Yeah.  Most of them just champion for more money for themselves.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Yes. A whole lot of more money, or more perks and --
L:  Yeah.  And more fast cars and more advertising deals and --
R:  Ugh!
L:  -- you know, their -- their name on -- on the sneakers and the -- the soda and ...
R:  Yeah.  And it was like, you know, when, um -- was it Seinfield and Friends and all that bunch, you know, they wanna come back for another season, but they want this amount of money or that amount of money and now, um -- who was it? -- uh [SIGH], Keanu Reeves, Keanu Reeves ...?
L:  Yeah.
R:   He's put his own money into that ma- -- the Second Matrix.  
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm waiting --
R:  So --
L:  -- for that to come out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I really want to see that.  I'm -- I'm a big fan of that kind of stuff.
R:  And, um, so I'm hoping on that too.  It --
L:  Yeah.  I wanna -- wanna see those.  Um, Keanu Reeves is just a little weird, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  He's -- he's not just in it for the money.  He's -- he's in it because he's weird!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And he likes acting too I think.
L:  Yeah.  But, um, you know, like -- like some of the TV shows they -- they just keep wanting more and more money every season --
R:  Yeah, it's like --
L:  -- or certain actors want more money.  So, that they wind up killing off their character like -- I don't know if you watch ER?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, when -- when they had that whole long drawn out thing with Dr. Green dying of brain cancer, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think that's 'cause the actor wanted more money or wanted to make movies or something.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's like, uh, the guy that plays Tony Soprano.  Speaking of that, it's what just come on TV --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh, you know, him holding out and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- making the season late on that for more money.
L:  And then there's that kid that -- that plays the son that was actually, you know, in --even in the real world, trouble for, uh, drugs and stealing and fighting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I think he kinda pretty much walked away from that one too.
L:  [MN]
R:  I'm sure --
L:  I think he had to do community service or some nonsense like that.
R:  Yeah.  Probably protected [LAUGH], his community service [LAUGH].  But, like I said, I, um, when they asked this last night and I just -- for the life of me I can't figure out who's getting ready to strike where.
L:  No.  I never heard of that either.
R:  And, um [PAUSE], I guess I'll have to listen more to the news in case I get this question again.
L:  I'd like to listen to the news [LAUGH], but they've got the baseball game on.
R:  [LAUGH] And it is so weird they pair up -- last night, uh, I had another woman to talk to about sports and it was so weird that --
L:  Yeah.  I got a man to talk to about comedians and I didn't know anything about any -- any of it.
R:  Ah.
L:  But I figured what the heck.
R:  Yeah.  As I said, I'm -- I'm just like, a complete loss.  I don't -- I don't know.  I guess it's, what, baseball season coming up?  But I haven't really heard a whole lot.
L:  Baseball season started a couple of weeks ago.
R:  Did it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, that's right, you would know 'cause that's all you get on the t- -- on your radio.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Maybe they had a big -- big deal for opening day, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Like I said, I --
L:  I was so gla- -- we had a big snowstorm here, you know, a little out of season snowstorm, like, about --
R:  Yeah.  We did too.
L:  -- a little over a week ago, and I was so glad because they postponed the baseball game that day 'cause they couldn't play in the snow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I was so happy.
R:  And we had a, um -- a big off season one too.
L:  Yeah, well, the same storm would just moved up -- up the east coast.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Most of the time we get some of the same weather, you know?
R:  Yeah.  And, uh --
L:  Now, if they'd let us talk about weather, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Or something else but sports.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or -- or strikes.
L:  Right.
R:  And entertainment and ...
L:  Yeah.  I -- I don't know anything about it.
R:  I don't either.
L:  And I don't even really know what we're supposed to be talking about because my husband just says, "I think it's for you.  Pick up the phone" and I got that stupid hold music.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, what -- um, do you what this study's exactly ...?
L:  I think what they're doing is recording samples of every day conversation, trying to analyze language patterns.
R:  Okay.  That's what I was wondering because that was this -- this, uh, university rang a bell with me.  They used to have a, um -- all the time they gather dialect.
L:  Yeah.  I think that's what they're doing.
R:  And, um, uh, 'cause if I'm not mistaken -- my brother come here one time -- he -- he was, uh, in the University of Ridgemont and, uh, one of the things that was in his course study in English was that he had to record so many different people speaking different dialects of the area --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where we live, and then it was taken and, um, put in some archive somewhere.  So, I'm wondering if it -- is it --
L:  Yeah.  I think this is a -- a -- a big linguistics project.
R:  Yes.
L:  And I'm -- I'm all for that kinda stuff --
R:  Yeah.  I think --
L:  -- although I'm -- I'm gonna confuse them because wherever I go in the US I sound like I'm from someplace --
