R:  Hi.
L:  Jennifer -- hello?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi [LAUGH].  What in this world is that?
L:  I don't know.
R:  Okay.
L:  What -- what --
R:  What do you think?
L:  About, uh, professionals?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think it's unprofessional.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  It's very, very unprofessional just because, um, you know, they're out -- they're getting so much money anyways.
R:  I don't think they need more money that someone that works for a living gets.
L:  Yea- -- I mean they don't work as hard as a lot of people actually that's cleaning the stadium, right?
R:  Yeah.  The poor little gal that, uh -- well, [inaudible] sure didn't get that much money and he sure worked harder.
L:  [NOISE] Well, the thing with them striking and just ruining -- like especially baseball, American's pastime whatever and then that's just wrong.
R:  Well, I don't like sports anyway so [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'd just be tickled to death 'cause they're -- they go interrupting my soap operas with their basketball games.
L:  Oh.  Well, I like sports but the thing is with the whole thing about, um, them striking and stuff, I don't know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's just -- just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- wrong and they're just making too much money and they don't really need that much more.
R:  Really?
L:  Millions and millions of dollars already and they're still complaining. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Well, what they'll do is they'll strike and people'll get used to not watching it and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then they won't have any money to get anyway.
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH] True. [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause that's what they did when they did football, you know, they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- went on strike --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm [NOISE].
R:  -- and people got to where they didn't watch it so much.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  And they really had to get people back into football to watch it.  My dad quit watching it all together.
L:  Oh, true?
R:  So, once -- people get used to what they don't get.
L:  Yeah.  That's definitely true. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, and I don't believe in striking anyway 'cause I'm southern and we don't have [NOISE] unions.  Shut up.
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You're dog's having a good time.
R:  Huh [NOISE].  Stop it.  I have dogs.
L:  So --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I can tell.  What kind?
R:  Miniature schnauzers.
L:  Oh, miniature ones. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I sell 'em.
L:  Yeah, the little ones make a lot of noise.  I have a little one too.
R:  Yeah, I'm about to go out of my mind.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  I have a little dog, a Pomeranian.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, those are cute too.
L:  Mhm, are they?
R:  They don't make as much noises as these boneheads.
L:  Oh, yes he does.
R:  [LAUGH] Where are you -- where are you from?
L:  Cali.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  California.
R:  Dab! 
L:  And you?
R:  I'm all the way in North Carolina [NOISE].
L:  Definitely far.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I wonder what they did that for.
L:  I don't know.  It's very interesting though.
R:  Yeah, well I'm [inaudible] [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] What is this -- how does this [NOISE] work, I don't know exactly what's going on.
R:  Well, they said that they would, uh, beep us in ten minutes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to ask us of our opinion on the striking of the football and we're gonna record something or something.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  And they ask us -- they asked me what I was talking on and I said, "I'm talking on a cordless phone".
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  And I pus- I do stuff like that all the time.
L:  Oh.  But how did this happen?
R:  I have no -- this -- you are my phone partner evidently [NOISE].
L:  Yeah, but how did this happen?
R:  I have no idea.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I just got this phone said, "Would you accept this phone call?"
L:  Oh, and like me you said, "Yes".
R:  Yeah, well, yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm a pretty agreeable person and I'll say, "Okay, whatever" [LAUGH].
L:  I did too so I was like, "Okay".
R:  Well, I'm trying to sit here and be calm anyway.  I just --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- delivered six puppies this morning and I'm tired.
L:  Miniature schnauzers? [LAUGH]
R:  Huh?
L:  For your dogs, the miniature schnauzers?
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm a puppy midwife, more or less.
L:  Oh, so do you breed 'em.
R:  I've got four females and when they have puppies I deliver 'em.  So --
L:  Mm.  So, you breed your dogs?
R:  Huh?
L:  You breed your dogs?
R:  Yeah, mm.
L:  Ah!
R:  I have nine of my own, five males and four females.
L:  You have nine by yourself?
R:  Yeah, just nine schnauzers, a poodle and a snoodle.
L:  That's what you keep --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on a regular basis.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You have eleven dogs?
R:  Yeah.
L:  By yourself. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my husband and my -- well, my son comes by once in a while but my husband lives here.  But now I have an extra added of nine puppies.
L:  Oh wow!
R:  Well, really eleven 'cause I've got two males that I'm trying to sell 'cause they're old enough -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but the other ones aren't.
L:  Oh wow!  
R:  So --
L:  But on a regular basis you have eleven dogs and then --
R:  Right.
L:  -- whatever extra then -- how do you keep up with them?
R:  Well, they're my babies.  They don't stay in a kennel, they stay in the house or out in the backyard in a fenced area.  But they all sleep in the house at night.
L:  [LAUGH] And they're yapping away.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They're driving me crazy 'cause I've just came in and they're mad.
L:  [MN] Oh, my god.
R:  'Cause it's nine o'clock over here.
L:  Mm.  That's so crazy.
R:  So, I guess it's six o'clock over there, right? [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's what everybody always says.
L:  I know.  It's nice and sunny.
R:  Where -- where abouts in California?
L:  LA.
R:  Huh?
L:  LA.
R:  LA!  No kidding!  Do you ever see any movie stars and stuff?
L:  Yeah, a lot.
R:  Oh, golly!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I live close to where they film Dawson's Creek but that's about it.
L:  What?
R:  Yeah, Wilmington, North Carolina.
L:  Oh, okay, yeah I know where that is?  Well --
R:  But I'm -- I'm out at high point so they have, um, oh crap, the international home furnishing, it's the worldwide home furnishing market now.
L:  Oh.
R:  They come from all over the United States and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- all over Europe and everything for our furniture market.
L:  Oh wow!  
R:  So --
L:  So, is it more like wood furniture?
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  Okay.
R:  But it's crap.
L:  Like more --
R:  Most of it's made in China and shipped over here and assembled.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  Yeah, so it stinks but --
L:  It's not like the [NOISE] -- so it's not like high end expensive?
R:  Oh, yeah.  It's high end and expensive.  
L:  Is it?
R:  It's the most expensive furniture you can buy like Boyhill, Thomasfield, um, Bassett.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, but all that furniture's made in China now.
L:  Mm.
R:  And it's assembled over here in our factory.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  They rip everybody off.
L:  I know, for the amount of money that they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- paid for it.
R:  Huh?
L:  W- -- especially for the amount of money they probably paid for the labor --
R:  Oh, yeah.  They're closing our factory.  So --
L:  Mm, well they still have to keep the factory to have it assembled here.
R:  Yeah.  But just [inaudible], you know, since they don't make it here any more.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  But that's cool.  I wonder if we're paying for this.
L:  I don't know.
R:  We better not be paying for this.
L:  You -- you didn't -- no, it wouldn't because you didn't call out.
R:  Yeah, well that's true.  I accepted the phone call.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm just thinking thank god,  if I'm calling LA I'm really POd over that [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, uh -- 
L:  That's strange.
R:  Well, I guess they're going to beep us in ten minutes I don't know how long it's been though.
L:  I don't -- hold on.  It's almost because I --
R:  Yeah, are you related to anybody famous? [LAUGH]
L:  No.
R:  No, I'm not either.
L:  I [inaudible] but no I'm living -- I'm looking at the clock, hold on.  It's nine twenty nine, nine thirty so thirty more seconds.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh well, I guess when it beeps we're supposed to say, "Yeah, we think they're getting too much money and they're a bunch of pigs".
L:  [LAUGH] True.
R:  Now, you read about the Carolina Panthers football team where they the guy killed his girlfriend?
L:  No, what happened.
R:  Well, that was Carolina Panthers football team, they beat the Dallas Cowboys at one time.
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  Well, he, uh, chased -- had these guy go and kill his girlfriend and her unborn baby, but her baby didn't die.  That's been a couple of years back.
L:  Oh, so why did he have her killed?
R:  'Cause she wanted support.  See, they're getting all these millions and millions of dollars, you see.
L:  Oh, she wanted support?
R:  So, right there -- right there and he's getting nothing now.
L:  Oh wow!  So, they found out that he did it?
R:  So, instead they just -- I don't know they're just getting too much money that's what's happening.
L:  Oh wow.  That's kinda disgusting, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, it was [inaudible] but, you know.
L:  Oh, nice.  I still can't get over the fact that you have eleven dogs.
R:  [LAUGH] It's very noisy.
L:  I was thinking, "God ..."  How do you do it?
R:  Oh, and I have one mancoon dog.  
L:  Oh.
R:  I mean mancoon cat, excuse me.
