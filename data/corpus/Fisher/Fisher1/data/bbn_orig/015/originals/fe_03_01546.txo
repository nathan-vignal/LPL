L:  Hello, this is Tina.
R:  Hi, Tina, this is Rahod[?].
L:  Okay.  Did you, um, get the topic?
R:  Uh, yeah, I think it was about, uh, recent strike by professional athletes.
L:  Strikes by professional actors?
R:  Athletes.  I think that was it.  Did -- did you hear something else?
L:  No, that's what I thought I heard. [LAUGH]
R:  Recent strike by professional athletes, that's what I think I heard.  Is that what you heard?
L:  [MN] Yes.
R:  So, what's your opinion on that?  I -- I'm [inaudible] by the way live in Atlanta, how about you?
L:  Um, I live in Atlanta.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Well, I live outside of Atlanta in the suburbs but basically, yes, I live in the Atlanta area.  Um, how long have you lived here?
R:  Actually I've just moved from Boston.
L:  Oh, okay.  I -- I've been here about two years.
R:  I live in the [inaudible].
L:  Well, um, strikes by professional actors, is that what it is?
R:  Athletes.
L:  Athletes, oh.  I think it's stupid. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because they already get paid a lot of money -- they get paid more than most people do in a year and they should accept what they get now and I don't think it really is necessary for them to complain about not getting enough money 'cause --
R:  My -- my opinion is same but slightly different.  Like, I think, we shouldn't generalize this --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- just because they're paid highly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think like every other profession, like even if somebody gets paid less or more --
L:  Like teaching? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's -- hey, you must be a teacher [LAUGH], are you?
L:  [LAUGH] Yes.
R:  Okay.  What I mean to say is that regardless of the profession and regardless of how much you get paid if there is something unfair you should be allowed to strike.  Just because you are paid highly -- you can take the example of some, let's say, scientist, who is working his, like, whole life to do something very noble and something and he gets paid very highly for his efforts.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he gets some unfair treatment and the union of scientists decides to make strike that they shouldn't, like for example, it shouldn't interfere with their work so much and things like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, according to this logic you will say that because they are paid highly they shouldn't strike.  So -- so that's where I differ, I think.
L:  Well --
R:  Whether --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- whether they should be allowed to strike or not or whether it is right or wrong --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- should really depend on the causes of the strike.
L:  Well, they should be allowed to strike if their working conditions are poor and for other conditions but I really do feel that professional athletes, um, already get a sufficient amount of money when you compare the salaries of an average citizen, um, they get more just to entertain us.  And they really don't need -- I feel they really don't need no more.  I mean --
R:  Yeah, that -- that's if they are striking because of working conditions.
L:  If they're striking because of working conditions, that's great.  That -- that's fine.  Everybody can use some improvement in their working conditions.
R:  Yeah, and secondly --
L:  Well, however -- however, it you don't like your profession, get out, let somebody else have an opportunity 'cause there's always somebody waiting to do what they're doing.
R:  What if somebody applies this logic to a teacher's union striking on something that, hey, if you don't like just get out.
L:  Get out.  I app- -- I believe the same thing.  If you don't like what you're doing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you don't like the working conditions, then maybe you should choose a different --
R:  So -- so in that case basically your reasoning has nothing to do with professional athletes.  You are simply saying if somebody is not happy, just leave it.
L:  Mm, yeah.  Leave.
R:  So that is a --
L:  I mean life about choices.
R:  -- applicable to teachers [inaudible] everywhere.
L:  Yeah, it -- it -- it applies to everyone.  If you don't like what you're doing then you need to get out and try some dif- --
R:  That's a -- that's a very simplified approach I would say.  I mean, you may like a profession, you may want to be successful in that and you have real qualifications for that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but -- but it may be that some things are wrong in that profession --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and to protest that strike is, uh, is like a peaceful way in a democracy.  So, not taking that right away from you and telling you that hey, if you don't like, get out.  I think -- I think that --
L:  Yeah, I think so. [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's the most simplified approach. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I think so.  I mean, you know --
R:  Let me give you an example of nurses, you are a teacher so maybe you will relate because my wife is a nurse --
L:  Uh-huh, oh yeah. [LAUGH] Another profession.
R:  -- so because they're also like a profession where it's mostly dominated by women and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so there are some conditions which are bad and all.
L:  Yes, and in -- in that -- in that situation where we need nurses and teachers I think people do need to come together and try to change.
R:  So, why not?
L:  If it -- do strike -- if strikes help change the profession then, you know, I'm all for that.
R:  So -- but you're logic will say that, hey, don't like it, leave it and go do something else.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it is.
R:  But I would say, "No".
L:  But we -- but for -- for a critical profession like teaching and nursing, um, you know, we want people to go in those professions.  So --
R:  I would -- I would like to change --
L:  -- they need to get together and try to change that situation.
R:  I would like to change little bit how you think about athletes or any celebrities and that -- that is that don't just think that they're earning millions of dollars like, first of all, I'm nowhere near that profession so I have not personal interest there but they generate that -- it is basically an income generating profession.
L:  Yes, but I think for professional athletes --
R:  They've got a lot of money but --
L:  -- they have no right to complain [LAUGH].
R:  -- because of that a lot of jobs are created.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Millions of people working in that industry --
L:  I don't have any sympathy for them. [LAUGH] They get so many privileges, you know -- their profession cannot be as bad as nursing or teaching.
R:  No, that -- that's true --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but that's -- that's not a yardstick I'd like -- like that you can say about nursing also that don't strike, there are professions which are even worse.  Look at construction workers or look at mining workers --
L:  Yes.
R:  No, so that's where --
L:  Please, yes.
R:  -- only the lowest common denominator can strike.
L:  Yeah, look at the police. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You can say that.  That's why I'm saying, you know, uh, professional athletes they -- they're a privileged group 'cause very few people get to become professional athletes.
R:  And do you think they just become like that?  I think --
L:  No.  There's -- you -- you know --
R:  -- they have -- they --
L:  -- very few make it to the top.  I don't know what's the percentage, one percent, two percent --
R:  Not even that.
L:  -- of all athletes?
R:  Just one person pitch.
L:  So, you know --
R:  So, they have worked hard for it and, sure, now -- now they're in that position so they're reaping the returns.  Like, if there is some unfair treatment I think they should be allowed to protest it.
L:  They're entertainers, get over it!  [LAUGH] No, they shouldn't strike. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I guess that's why this discussion -- that everyone can have their opinions.
L:  [LAUGH] I mean they're -- they're just given too much as it is, I feel, you know.
R:  Well, you know, uh, what, Tina, uh, I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I have migrated to America so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I've learned the thinking here.  But this kind of, uh, thinking is more in socialist countries and all.  And because of that thinking they don't -- they don't rise.  I mean, here it's like competition.  Be the best you can.
L:  Yes.
R:  And -- and you will the best rewards.  
L:  Yes.
R:  You don't have to be somebody rich or something.
L:  Right.
R:  You're a teacher so you will understand this concept.  Anybody can be anything.
L:  Yeah, anybody can do anything.
R:  In many countries, the leader of the count- -- if you have to become the leader of that country you have to be born in some of those family or something like that.
L:  Oh, yes, that's true.
R:  But -- but here you can be a farmer's son --
L:  But here -- mhm.
R:  -- and you can become the president --
L:  Anybody can be anything. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  So -- so, sure if you have this talent and you are reaping the rewards that's great, I mean sure we can be --
L:  Yes.  Mhm.
R:  -- sure we can be [inaudible] also that hey, that guy's making millions and millions.  But, ultimately, that person somehow deserved it.  And regardless of the fact how much that person --
L:  Yes, you're --
R:  -- is making --
L:  You're right.
R:  -- I think if that person is treated unfairly he has the same rights as a poor person because you cannot --
L:  But a lot of times when they're -- when professional athletes strike --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're not striking because they're being treated unfairly --
R:  Exactly, that's why I say --
L:  -- they're -- they're striking because --
R:  -- that reason --
L:  -- they want a free agent, uh, or they want more pay.
R:  Well, if they are striking unfairly then I'm sure like somebody can say, "Hey, get out".  So, again, it's the reasons of the strike that are more important than who is striking.  So, otherwise it would be a reverse discrimination when we talk about nurses and teachers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we are sympathetic but when we talk about celebrities we say, "Hey, they make a lot of money let's not give them any more". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I can understand that --
L:  But they do. [LAUGH]
R:  I can understand that but that would be a reverse discrimination.
L:  This is -- it's terrible how this society, uh, values certain professions more than others, you know. [MN]
R:  But everyone strives to be in their shoes so if you make that profession ugly, if you take all the privileges away from that profession then nobody will try to reach those heights.  So, again, my opinion is it depends -- because I am not -- I guess the topic was the recent strike.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I think -- I'm not exactly familiar with what was the reasons.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Probably something like as you are saying they wanted a free agent or whatever. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  So, again --
L:  I'm -- I'm thinking about the baseball strike that they had --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know a year -- two years ago, three years ago and they didn't play [LAUGH] baseball.
R:  You know, it's not only the players who are making money.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Players are working for a club.  The club is owned by somebody who is making, perhaps, like, uh, millions and billions.
L:  Mm.
R:  So --
L:  Who's making money off of them?  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  So, players are technically employees of that club, they work for a boss.  So ...
