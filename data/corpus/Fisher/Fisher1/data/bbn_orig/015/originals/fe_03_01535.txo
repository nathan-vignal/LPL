R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Kathy.
R:  How you doing, I'm Joshua from Atlanta.
L:  Hey.  I'm from Chicago.
R:  Right on.
L:  I have a question.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I -- I didn't hear what the topic was, something about sports and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I didn't hear what the rest of it was. 
R:  [NOISE] Um, if the sports players are supposed to get such high salaries or if you agree with their high salaries.
L:  Oh.  Oh, wha- -- oh, okay, so the high salaries of sports players or whatever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, well, in my opinion either way it -- I mean, I guess they should get high salaries because, first of all, they're playing a professional game and they're -- it's very rigorous working and, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they are, you know, in publicity a lot so I guess they should get high pay.
R:  I agree [NOISE] I agree, I mean, you should get it how you -- however you can get it, you know.  It's not like somebody should be mad at them for making money.
L:  I know like -- it's not like you're not working for the money, it's like some people that just, you know, sit and it -- they get money for themselves or whatever, you know, they don't deserve it but sports people I -- I -- I know because, like, my sons play sports, I personally don't play sports, I watch football all the time but, um, I don't play.  But I know that they work their ass off, you know, just exercising and training and stuff like that and why shouldn't they get so much money?  And that's the lifestyle that -- that's, you know, the lifestyle that they're, you know, used to then they should get the money.
R:  I agree with that like, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they've -- they've sacrificed their bodies physically for it, you know, they forgo, um, a lot of times going to school or whatever they just do that sport.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  And if they get picked up by a team and they make, uh, cash doing it, more power to 'em.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean I don't think --
L:  Na-
R:  -- I don't think nobody should take it away from them or try to cap it off.  I wouldn't want nobody -- 
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- capping off my money if I was playing.
L:  [LAUGH] I know.  And is there like something going on about it?  Is there like a, like a dispute or whatever going on about it, is that, like, why there's a survey or whatever?
R:  I don't know I --
L:  'Cause they --
R:  -- I don't personally even watch sport.
L:  Oh, you don't?
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  Mm.  'Cause I -- I haven't heard anything about there being -- like, I don't know if, like, the media is criticizing or whatever and that's why they're having a survey on it now or whatever but it's -- it's kind of an unusual, like, topic to talk about.  'Cause yesterday I did a survey and it was about nine eleven and stuff like that and I can understand --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that but I don't know, like, whether, you know, sports and, you know --
R:  Yeah, it must be --
L:  I don't know -- I don't know --
R:  -- it must be a strike of something going on where some -- it must some type of players that are striking for some more money or something --
L:  Which from -- there's players -- there are players striking for more money?
R:  Um, I don't know that's usually what it -- when they go on strike they refuse to play because of something.
L:  Well, okay, I -- okay, if that's the case then to a certain extent I can see them wanting to make money, okay?  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But when it's to the point where you're getting like two, three million a year const- you know, guaranteed and you're going on strike because you want more, I think that's getting a little bit greedy.  Because there's people like me, I put- -- I don't know your background but -- so I'm only going to speak for myself -- there's people like me who, you know, struggle, you know, with what we make a year and, uh, you know we live comfortably and if a player -- yeah, they're sacrificing their body and stuff like but they should -- and they should get, you know, a high salary but, you know, if they're making like two som- two or more million dollars a year or whatever and they're not happy with that there's something -- there's something wrong 'cause that's getting a little bit greedy, I think.  Not even --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the President makes that much.
R:  Yeah, a lot of times when, um, when -- when sports people get that -- that big salary and they hold out for that it's because they -- it's not only them they're running a whole -- a whole, like -- like som- like just let's say Michael Jordan for example --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he's probably got -- he's probably got a thousand people on payroll, they get paid off of what he does.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it's like when -- when you get into that limelight not only are you supporting your -- your family, your extended family, you have people who work for you who you support their families and a lot of times --
L:  True.
R:  -- I mean those dudes they -- they -- they -- they get the big money because they have big bills.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They've gotta sup- support a lot -- a lot a -- a lot of mouths to feed when you -- when you get to doing that.  Lawyers come into play, there's people trying to sue you and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and things like that.  When you -- I mean, more money, more problem.
L:  I -- No, I totally agree.  But I think that -- you know, I think like the -- okay, the minimum amount that a newbie on a NFL -- uh, that a NFL player makes.  You know, fresh out of college, right, right on, you know -- you know, uh, I -- I don't know what you call it, I just call them new- you know, new person.
R:  Right.
L:  Is two million dollars a year?  Okay, and guaranteed.  I mean, come on, ther- I -- I know there's, you know, a lot of people that they've gotta take of but for two million dollars?  You -- you gotta be happy with that and then there's other people that have been on the roster for, like, [SIGH] over, like, five, ten years that are making like thirty five, forty million dollars a year.  And they're striking 'cause they're unhappy with that.  I don't -- I think that's -- like I can agree to a certain extent that they need money but, uh, I don't know I think that [NOISE] they're becoming greedy when they start asking for more.  You know what I'm saying?
R:  Who -- who are they asking for it?  I mean, who'd they -- they asking for it?
L:  What did you say?
R:  To get more -- who are they asking to get more money from?  It's not like they're -- they're asking, uh, the community in general to pay their money.  It's like [MN] -- it's like these, uh, whoever owns the -- the -- the team.
L:  Yeah.  And see that's taking also -- that's also taking away from the manager and the owner [NOISE] and stuff like that because if they stri- -- I know the manager and the owner really all they do is, you know, manage and own --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it and the players are the same but, you know, it takes a lot to be a manager of -- especially of sports and stuff like that.  It takes a lot to do that and it takes -- when they go on strike and [NOISE] they want more money it takes a lot out of them, I think.  A lot --
R:  Oh, definitely --
L:  -- a lot more money from the --
R:  Definitely so.
L:  Pardon?
R:  I said, "Definitely so".
L:  And then --
R:  I think -- I think there should be, uh, a reasonable amount of money spread -- the wealth should be spread amongst the people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's a lot of people that are very super rich that can never -- their families will never -- their lineage will never run out of money.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And here's people who are very poor and there's not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- much middle ground in between.
L:  I think that they should be required to give so- -- uh, well, maybe not required but I think that on a moral note they should give their -- they should give money to charity and stuff like that too.  Because they are making so much money a year, you know --
R:  If you -- 
L:  -- why not just help out.
R:  If you make -- if you make a million dollars in a year, you're -- you're gonna pay at least half a million in taxes.  So, you're starting out with half a million.
L:  True.
R:  There's, uh, there's -- there's no way ifs ands and buts about it that you're going to gonna get at least forty perce- at the least forty percent taken out [NOISE] of your -- if you make the money [NOISE] legally you're gonna get forty percent taken.  So, you're -- so say you start off with a million, I personally myself I've seen a million dollars come and go.  I've seen it in the tour[?] budget.  And, uh --
L:  Well --
R:  -- a million dollars is -- is -- a million dollars is a piddle, a million dollars is, uh, a brand new band somebody in investments.  You can -- you can piddle out a million dollars in a three months tour.
L:  [NOISE] Oh --
R:  If you've got five people in a band and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's -- its -- a million dollars isn't -- it's not really a lot.  It's a lot to me if I had it, a million in my pocket but there's a lot of --
L:  I guess after taxes and stuff like that and expenses but it's for personal use though, isn't it?  I mean are we talking a million after taxes or are we talking a million pre tax?
R:  If you were to get a million dollars, you would start off with a half a million because half of it would get taxed before you even got a chance to do anything with it.
L:  Isn't the maximum that they can tax you like thirty two percent?
