R:  Hi.  I'm Kim.
L:  Hi.  I'm Jamie.  
R:  Hi, Jamie.  How are you today?
L:  I'm good.  How are you?
R:  Good.  I had a little trouble understanding.  Are we discussing the pay of athletes?
L:  Yeah.  I believe that's what it is.  If we think that they [SIGH], um [LIPSMACK], deserve the salaries that they receive, [NOISE] I believe is what it was.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um ...  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Well, I don't think they do.  Do you?
L:  I don't either, no.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I think it's glorified and --
L:  [MN] [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- way too much.
L:  Yes.  If I was an athlete I might feel a little differently, um, but as a -- solely as a source of entertainment I would say that that's a little steep [SIGH] considering there's, you know, starving kids that can't eat and we're all spending ninety, a hundred dollars on a ticket to go to a baseball game.
R:  Right, right.  Well, it started out it's supposed to be a fun sport, you know, for people to go watch and it's crazy what it costs to go watch now and stuff.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Just the, um, the average single mom that's got several kids can't allow herself and the kids to go 'cause she can't afford it.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  And that's not fair.  I don't think.
L:  No, it's not.
R:  And then the athletes, um [SIGH], I don't know -- their wild hair do's and their tattoos and -- and th- --
L:  [SIGH] And they're on the travel channel as going to Vegas all the time.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  You know?  And -- and I don't know, um [LIPSMACK], these are the idols our kids look up to --
L:  Right.  Well ...
R:  -- when they're young.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  It would -- I guess it's not bad to idolize w- wanting to make that much money one day, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But to maybe idolize the way that the money is used!  [SIGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  That's just like -- [LIPSMACK]
R:  Exactly.
L:  Right.
R:  You sound out of breath.
L:  That's 'cause I'm running.  [LAUGH]  I was -- I was just -- I was just up and down, like, two flights of stairs while I was on the phone.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!  Okay.
L:  I was doing laundry. [NOISE]
R:  I see.
L:  [MN] [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, yes, I was out of breath.
R:  So ...
L:  But now I'm sitting.
R:  Well, I don't know -- I -- I feel, um, some of the sports are dangerous, but that's what they chose to get into and evidently --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they got into it 'cause they liked it, you know?
L:  Right, right.  Like -- like, uh, boxing.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- oh, that -- and that was actually one of the things that I would say, like, with, um [LIPSMACK], you know, they -- they -- they bid to -- [NOISE] to draft certain athletes, but boxing is one of the sports where, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they actually are paid to lose.  [SIGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
L:  [MN]  So, you could actually spend the money to go to a fight and irregardless of, you know, depending on what round they [MN] go down in d- determines the amount of money they make and [LIPSMACK] you know what I mean?  You could go and spend X. amount of dollars for tickets and then the [NOISE] -- you're -- you're -- you -- you've spent the money irregardless of how long you're -- how long the fight lasts or -- and then to do the pay review and ... [SIGH] [LIPSMACK]
R:  And wrestling, that's a joke.
L:  Yeah, that's -- well, that's -- t- -- that is solely entertainment I would --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I would assume.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  Yeah.
L:  I don't think that they're truly wrestling.  [LIPSMACK]  Uh, yes, I think it's -- it's ridiculous.  There's a lot of other places [LIPSMACK] where that money could go.
R:  Well, my oldest son --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he was very, very talented.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he was like, top in basketball and top in baseball.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it went to his head.  I mean, he was always first picked every season and everything.
L:  Right.
R:  And so he was going to be an athlete.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And as long as you're an athlete you don't have to learn.
L:  Right, right.  [LAUGH]
R:  They let you slide.  He is one of the dumbest kids I've ever seen.
L:  Really?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  You know?  And [COUGH] he didn't become an athlete because he -- he wouldn't have cut it in college, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and I -- it's just so sad [COUGH] --
L:  That is sad.
R:  -- how many of these athletes really are not very intelligent.  Some of 'em couldn't even read and write --
L:  Right.
R:  -- at -- through the school on their talents.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And other people doing their schoolwork.  [LIPSMACK]  And, uh, you know -- and I don't know.  I --
L:  That -- that is very, very common.  I -- I come from a school where, um, sports is really, really dominant and the football team [MN] that's exactly the way it was.  Um, like, drug abuse and alcohol violations and stuff like that, in addition to schoolwork, were overlooked --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for -- for players.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And not just by the school, by, um, the police [LAUGH], you know what I mean?
R:  Mhm.
L:  By, like, people in the town and it's ...  [LIPSMACK]
R:  But I think it's just the whole image.  "Yeah, I'm gonna go and, like -- gonna do the same thing as I did as a kid and I'm gonna be this multi millionaire and I'm gonna take care of ya and I'm not gonna have to need anything to fall back on" and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so many kids, [LIPSMACK] talented kids, but they don't realize once they get senior year in high school -- there's talented kids in thousands of schools cross the country.
L:  Right.  And such a small percentage --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- actually make it to --
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  -- to making any kind of life sustaining around money.  [LAUGH]
R:  And I just think it should've just stayed the clean old sport, the way it used to be, you know?
L:  Right, right.
R:  And, um, sports would be [inaudible] fun.
L:  Be able to take your kids to a game on a Saturday afternoon to spend time together.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Right.  I --
L:  Instead of it costing five hundred dollars for an afternoon at the ball park.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  So ... how old are your kids?
L:  I only have one son and he's, um, s- -- he's almost six months old.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, and so you're just a young mom!  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm just a young mom, yeah.  He's -- we're not into that yet, but it's -- his -- his generation turns into the little shits when they're about, uh [LIPSMACK], nine now I think.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, it can happen sooner too!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  I tell ya, it's like -- they -- my oldest is twenty nine --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and my youngest are twins, they're eighteen.
L:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, just from that age spread there's been a big difference, and now the kids coming up in the neighborhood, I can't believe it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- seven, eight years old smoking cigarettes down at the schools and --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- kids getting pregnant in seventh and eighth grade.
L:  Yeah!
R:  It's unreal.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] It was even -- my sister's only six years younger than I am and even -- in my class it would've been unheard of, and there was a girl that was a year behind her in school at, like, seventh grade, she was, like, thirteen and fourteen and pregnant.  It's like ... 
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Um, [PAUSE] I don't -- I don't see how --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they can have -- where they -- where they find the time to be alone long enough for -- at age thirteen where are your parents, or some sort of adult supervision is around that long.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, violence too, you know, I think, uh, violence is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- bred by sports and every year the sports get more violent.  You see dirty plays or --
L:  Or the --
R:  -- dishonesty, and these people are getting paid big bucks to be that way, and -- and the kids are sharp these days.
L:  Right.
R:  Pick up on that.
L:  Or the looting that happens when a certain team loses.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Exactly.  You know?  And I don't know.  I -- I think the whole thing just sets a bad image for our kids.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, it's unfortunate that that's all they have to look up to and you can't tell 'em otherwise because they're living, you know, the American dream per se.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] That and bands.
L:  Bands?
R:  Oh, my God!  The bands!
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's -- that's ridiculous too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Really bad.  I -- my one teenage boy is a drummer.
L:  Mhm.  Oh.  Huh.
R:  And, uh, he had genius IQ.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And once again there goes talent.  Now, that's what you talk about talent.  My first one he was just your average kid.  This one comes along, and genius IQ, high school drop out, he's the only one of my five that dropped out.  Uh, he's gonna make it big as a drummer.  He don't need school.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Right.
R:  And it's the same thing as the -- the sports -- the big money, the lifestyle, all this and that, it's a dream world.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So ...
L:  Once you get there it's not all it's cracked up to be.
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  Nah.  Is he doing okay with his drumming though?  Is it ...?
R:  Oh, he's an excellent drummer.  Yeah.
L:  But I mean is he -- is he able to make --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- money, is he -- is he in a band that's -- do they perform in places yet or ...?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, he's eighteen and, no, he's not because I can't afford the drums he needs.
L:  Oh, the drums.
R:  He's got, um, three big bands that want him, older guys.  He'd be the young kid in the band.
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  Um, but three of the top bands around here all want him as their drummer and they come over and jam with him and stuff, you know.  But, um ...
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Doesn't he work?  Can he buy his own drum?  [NOISE]
R:  No, he don't work.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  [MN] Like I said, he's --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- he's all psyched up into that world.
L:  Well, if his drum set is important enough to him --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I suppose he'll get a job and buy it, right?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  He says he's out looking, but I don't think he's looking too hard.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Right, right, right.
R:  You know?  And, uh -- and then my oldest daughter's sports -- she was a runner --
L: [NOISE]
R:  -- and she went to nationals actually and we took her out to State of Washington and ...  [LIPSMACK] Those athletes I don't think make the money, you know, they're not recognized like your baseball, football, and all that, but ...
L:  Me- like your men's sports, popular men's sports.
R:  Right, right.  And, um [LIPSMACK], sports for her was --
