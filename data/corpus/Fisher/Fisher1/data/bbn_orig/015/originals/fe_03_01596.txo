R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, this is Trish in Boston.
R:  Hi, this is Jacqui from Virginia.
L:  Hi, Jacqui, how are you?
R:  Fine, how you doing?
L:  Good, thank you.
R:  Good, um, what do you think about, you know, tightened security preventing terrorists?
L:  Well, I think they've definitely, um, stepped it up a bit but I still think that there's room for improvement.
R:  Right.
L:  At the airports especially, um, I've been there sometimes when they don't really seem to be paying attention, um, and I still think that there are ways that people can get things on board.
R:  Right, yeah, I -- I -- I would have to agree with you.  I haven't been -- I haven't traveled since -- wait a minute, let me see, have I?  Yeah, I've been to -- been on a plane since all this stuff [NOISE] happened last -- I mean, uh --
L:  Since September eleven?
R:  Yeah [NOISE], September eleven, but, um, I don't know I still think that, you know, if -- there are ways that some- someone could get like a -- a weapon or something on a plane without them really knowing about it.
L:  Yes, and it's -- and it's since -- and it has happened --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- since, but I mean definitely is, um, I think more secure than it was in the past.
R:  Yeah, I'd -- I would have to agree.
L:  But if you travel now you need to, uh, not wear boots because if you wear boots you have to take them off.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Can't wear a coat.  I mean, you have to take off your coat.  It's a little bit of an inconvenience.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, which I guess they're working on making it simpler, but --
R:  Yeah, I'm not sure -- I haven't been through a lot of different airports, just, um --
L:  You live in Virginia?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, d- -- where do you travel from?
R:  Um, well I've been to Dallas --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, since all this happened and, where else have I been to?  Uh, I haven't been out of the country or anything.
L:  No, me either.
R:  So, um, that's about it I -- I believe.  I think it's -- it's pretty -- I mean, I think it's -- it's great that they won't let you go, um, past the -- the gate, you know if someone's getting off the plane that you know.  
L:  Right.
R:  You can't, you know, really get back to, um, where they're boarding and everything.  I think that's pretty good, but, um --
L:  That you can only get, um, to the gate if you're a ticketed passenger?
R:  Right.
L:  And there's not as many people around which is good and stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but for some of the, um, the, uh, equipment that they need to be able to scan luggage and stuff that -- it hasn't happened in all the airports yet.
R:  Right.
L:  And that's gonna take a long time and cost a lot of money, but I --
R:  Mhm, I think so too.
L:  But I think for people getting through, you know, they definitely have beefed up security and there's a lot more people there and in New York they still have, um, the National Guard.
R:  Oh, they do?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  When you fly into, um, La Guardia they do.  They don't have it in -- I fly in and out of Boston --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and they don't have it here.  Now, do you fly out of, um, Washington airports or do you go to Virginia?
R:  No, I go to Virginia.  Either, um, let me see, either Richmond -- sometimes I fly out of, um, Norfolk --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, it just all depends.  
L:  Is that a smaller airport?
R:  Norfolk is larger actually.
L:  Is it large?
R:  Mhm.  Richmond is -- is pretty small, um, compared to the other airports I've been to.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I mean, it -- it's not bad at all but I just think that sometimes, um, the employees aren't really paying as much attention --
L:  Correct.
R:  -- to [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to detail as -- as they should be, but --
L:  I know, I recently went to, um, check in at Delta and they didn't even ask me for my identity.
R:  You're kidding?
L:  But that was at the ticket counter, but of course --
R:  But still, yeah, I mean --
L:  They do, and they, um -- and then you have to use it of course to get through the, uh, gate, I mean through the -- where they x-ray your bags and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and stuff, you have to have your boarding pass and your, um, license.
R:  Mm.  I heard on the, um, television tonight that, uh, pilots are gonna be, um -- are gon- --
L:  Carrying guns?
R:  Carrying guns, yeah.
L:  But you won't know which -- they -- they're not going to announce --
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] This pilot -- this flight the pilot has a gun.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I kn- -- just the other day I saw on the -- on the news that, um, there was an American Airlines flight from Long Beach, California, which is where I used to live --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- on its way to New York that had to be diverted in Phoenix because two people on, um, the plane thought that another passenger had a knife.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  But they didn't, so once they'd determined that they didn't them were able to, uh, get back in the air and stuff, so -- 
R:  Okay, mm.
L:  So, that's still ha- -- I mean, people are still cautious --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and looking at, um, their fellow passengers.
R:  Right.
L:  I haven't flown extensively since nine eleven.
R:  Yeah, I haven't either.  But, I'm not afraid though --
L:  No, I'm not either.
R:  -- you know, no, not either.
L:  I'm just afraid of -- in a flight, you know, just the general things that can go wrong when you fly.
R:  Yeah, I just hope that, you know, they look at everybody across the board, you know, and not just, you know, um, target certain people --
L:  Correct.
R:  -- that they think are just, you know, um, suspicious.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, just because of the way you look or something.
L:  Right, well for a while --
R:  But, it's just --
L:  -- when I was flying I, um, w- would get targeted because I, um, bought a one-way ticket --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at the last minute --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and I think that's -- that's something that they look out for and, what else did I do?  There was one other thing that I did and someone said, "Oh, that's probably why they called you out".
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And I've seen them call out all different types of people here on the east coast.
R:  Okay.
L:  Older people, much older people, um, pregnant women.
R:  Really?
L:  Yep [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, my goodness!
L:  So, well, that's -- a part of it is because a lot of the people flying back and forth on the shuttle are all the same.  It's pretty much upper -- you know, its middle class --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- white people.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they have to figure -- you know, pick somebody.
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, man.  But, um, o- overall I think, you know, I think they've -- they've improved but, I don't -- I don't know, I think --
L:  Well, they don't let you park -- you know, there's more security around the airport.  You can't leave your car.
R:  Oh, right, yeah.  I mean, that's why -- I mean, like my husband travels a little bit more than I do --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I always tell him to, you know, let me know exactly when his plane is gonna arrive and, um, you know, if there's any change to call me and let me know because it's like a forty -- it's about a half an hour drive from my home to the airport.
L:  Oh, do you go and pick him up?
R:  Yeah, and I go pick him up sometimes and if I do I have to, like, you know, just circle the block --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, because I can't park, you know, just to pick him up, you know, so -- I mean, that's just a hassle but I mean it's -- you know, it's -- it's needed but --
L:  It is needed.
R:  -- it's just, uh, oh my god --
L:  But it is -- it is -- it is very difficult.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We usually, um -- here in Boston we have the subway the T --
R:  Okay.
L:  So, that's how I usually get home.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Jump on the shuttle and -- just on the shuttle bus and then get on the T.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, I -- I like Boston.  I haven't been there in a long time.
L:  Tomorrow's the marathon.
R:  Hm?
L:  Tomorrow's the Boston Marathon.
R:  It is?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, the city's very crowded.
R:  Wow!
L:  But it is nice.
R:  Yeah, I haven't been to Boston in years.
L:  Oh, okay, um --
R:  But, um --
L:  So, I -- I think they're definitely -- it's definitely been an improvement.  I think there is -- there is more to do.
R:  Right, I think so as well.
L:  I think the people, um -- the cost, uh, it's expensive but it's necessary to spend the money.
R:  Yeah, I think so too.  I just hope that, um, with all of the -- you know, if they improve the technology to, you know, to scan, I guess, um, baggage and everything, that they just stay on top of, you know, training the employees, you know, because --
L:  Right, and being able to do it, um --
R:  Right, if they've got to spend all the money.
L:  Ex- yeah, being --
R:  You know.
L:  -- able to do that and also to be able to do it in -- in as quick a way as possible.
R:  Right.
L:  Because I think that, um -- you know, it's hard enough with different things that can go wrong and weather and planes being late and the airport's getting very crowded.
R:  Right.
L:  And so if  it takes a long time to screen all the bags then that will lead to more frustration.
R:  It sh-, yeah, I agr- -- I agree, definitely.  But there's one -- where was -- there was one airline I wa- -- gonna say I was watching television.  I don't whether it was -- it wasn't, mm, uh, I thought they were -- they weren't on strike but something that happened.
L:  Um, recently?
R:  Yeah, um --
L:  American Airlines, um, was having some financial trouble and so was --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- United.
R:  Okay, maybe it was -- it may have been United.
L:  I don't think anybody's been on strike.
R:  No, I think they were, um --
L:  They were threatening to go on strike.
R:  Okay.  'Cause I -- I heard a spokesperson come on for, um, one of the -- one of the airlines but I think they're doing a lot better, hopefully, but, um, uh, I don't know, I think, um, you know, I definitely think it's gonna get a lot better as time, you know, moves on.
L:  Mhm.  I think so too.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  We'll hope -- we'll keep our fingers crossed.
R:  Yeah, I know, um, I hope they, uh, you know with the pilots, you know, being armed and all, hopefully that won't pre- present any challenges.  I'm pretty sure, like you said, they won't announce it or anything.
L:  No, and it won't be, um ...
