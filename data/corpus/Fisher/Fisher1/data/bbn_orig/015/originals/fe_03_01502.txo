R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, this is Joanna.
R:  How you doing, Joanna?  My name is Saieed[?].
L:  Hi. [MN]
R:  All right.  So what changes --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- have you made, if any?  Since then.
L:  Uh, since September eleventh.  Um, well, I think that it made me think about my family a lot, especially like, my family on the east coast.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, since I'm from Texas.
R:  Okay.
L:  [MN] and they're in Jersey. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  So, I mean, I became very like, even more worried about them and making sure that, you know, I hope no- nothing happens to them. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  Well, you know, I'm -- I'm in Philadelphia and uh, I, uh, I normally go pick up my son every two weeks, uh, in, uh, in New York City.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And what's interesting about that day is, the -- it was on a Tuesday and that morning I was supposed to go pick him up, and, um, generally what I would do is, to save myself about a half an hour I would get off at Newark, New Jersey and take the path train into the World Trade Center, and then just walk to the ferry from there, he lives in Staten Island.  But that morning, uh, when I called he was sick, so I was gonna get him on the Wednesday instead.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, uh, and sure enough, uh, on the news I saw it happening and it was -- it was wild, I -- I would've been involved in that, I would've been -- I would've been on the bottom floor of that.
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  So it was very, very scary, you know.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, thank God nothing happened to you.
R:  Yeah, thank God.  But --
L:  And -- and that your child wasn't with you too, at the same time.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Definitely, definitely.  You know --
L:  Um ...
R:  And so, you know, I -- I -- I -- in -- ever since after that when -- when you -- when I go to New York City, right now it looks like marshal law, and I have never -- I had always, you know, saw stuff on TV about marshal law and different little stuff, like you can see the, uh, anti war craft things in there and everyone's walking around, uh, you know, with the, uh, you got the military guys walking all around, and that's what it feels like.  So, you know, it [MN] -- the changes it made for me was, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to let me know just how -- if -- you know, when you -- when you see these -- these terrorists and you hear about these terrorists in other countries and so forth [inaudible] making threats, you know, you don't really think about it, you don't really personalize it.  But I -- I started to really personalize it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and saw just how real it was, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  And it's very scary.  You know, it's very scary [MN] a lot, [MN] you know, a- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there was certain times wh- when --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there would be certain war situations to come and you would feel like, "Oh well, you know, y- we shouldn't do that" and so forth and on, but ever since then -- now I feel as though --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that when you have these terrorists threatening you, you know, we -- we have to -- we have to go over there and get 'em, why wait for someone to come kill you?  You know?
L:  Exactly.  I agree.
R:  You -- like, if you're in Texas and I'm over in Philly and I'm -- I'm -- I'm saying, you know, "I'm coming to Texas to kill you, I'm coming to Texas to kill you" and you're just gonna sit and wait for me, it just makes better sense to go, you know, "We're gonna get it on, let's get it on".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, yeah, got Saddam Hussein and making particular threats and, you know, it just makes sense to go out there and take care of business, you know.  So, uh, it -- it changed my views on -- on, uh, you know, what it -- what it is that we have to do to protect ourselves and protect our freedom, you know.  And I guess protecting freedom is -- is a -- is a ugly thing, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot of us want it but we don't wanna hear about what has to happen to -- to ensure it.  So, uh, and it's -- it's funny, you know, like, uh, my -- my name is Saieed Mohammed.  I'm not Muslim --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm a Christian, but, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's a -- it's -- it's interesting how -- how, you know, you're -- you -- you get on a airplane or something like that and you can't help but to be a little nervous.  You know, you don't wanna be a racist, you don't wanna profile people and, you know, me being, a- uh, African American, I definitely don't wanna be profiled.  That's just a scary thing, you know?
L:  Yeah, yeah, it is very scary.
R:  It is definitely very scary, you know, I just started to -- you know, I -- I started really -- you know, i- it's like a lot of people -- it's -- it's funny, in the World Trade Center is the people of all races and all religions and creed that died in there.  And for a while it bought everyone pr- closer together and I thought it was gonna stay that way and it, uh, and for the most part it seems like, in -- in my travels it seems to be pretty much that way, but, um, it just showed me that no one's safe from terrorism, you know.
L:  No, it's not.  I think, you know, they caught us from -- by surprise, and --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And I think it was just even more surprising is that they actually were able to take over like, you know, I think it was three planes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then not only that, hit the Pentagon.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I was like, "The Pentagon!"  I was like, "I don't even think that, you know, planes were allowed near". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it was -- that -- that -- that's crazy.  That, I mean, that's -- I guess, you know, you get comfortable, you're in the strongest country in the world and you just imagine, well, you know, the last time we were attacked is when the Japanese a- attacked us, and that was years ago, and we figure, well, nothing like that could happen, but we let everyone into this country.  You know, you and I mostly can't go to most countries and get a air- you know, a pilot's licence and, you know, and all of that kinda stuff.  But here, the country, you know, home of the free, you know, anybody from anywhere could come and get the same type of training you and I had and these gentlemen apparently did just that, they got the training, they -- they found out how to fly the planes in America --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- hijacked the plane [LAUGH] in America and used it to -- to kill us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's just a --
L:  And every day you think about it, that we've been really like, we took the signs for granted, like, because actually like, in -- back in ninety three I believe they had the bombing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at the -- was it, uh, was it the World Trade Center too?
R:  Yeah, uh-huh, mhm.
L:  And, um, my friend was a -- a paramedic, and he went there to volunteer.
R:  Mhm.  God bless him.
L:  And he was just saying that it was just awful.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I just never thought that anything could be worse than that.  And then, uh, what happened like, almost ten years later --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they hit it, you know, they -- they figure, okay, well a bomb didn't -- didn't knock it off, then we have to try something bigger.
R:  Yeah.  I wonder -- and that was nine eleven -- I wonder if they -- they picked that date on purpose, you know, it -- it symbolized nine one one?  I- or is that -- is that just a --
L:  You know, I thought about that too, and I was like, uh, I was like, I don't know if you -- I heard that they were -- I guess maybe they wanted to do it a couple of days before --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I don't know how true that was, you know, like -- and it just happened to fall on that day --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- nine eleven.  So I just, you know, I wouldn't know.
R:  Mm.  I -- yeah --
L:  But, I mean, it's just [MN] -- I don't know, I just -- I just think that it kinda made people think "Hey, you know, we can't take life for granted".
R:  Definitely.  We definitely can't take life for granted.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I just wonder why are we -- we so -- we're so hated, you know, as -- as a nation?  Uh, you know, it's like the -- the Muslims and other countries like, really hate us.  Now, at the same time, understanding that, I -- I saw, uh, Queen Noor of Jordan, uh, on -- on a Larry King interview, um, uh, two nights ago, and she was saying that how the news in different countries, like the news in the Middle East is vastly different from the news here, where we show pretty much what the -- the victor's point of view and so forth and on, where other countries show more of what happens to the people who have nothing to do with it.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, I -- I wonder, you know, I always wonder if th-- is this country doing things and telling us different, you know, a different story, you know, because everyone's -- well, from anoth- another country seems to have almost the same opinion about us, that we're brutal and so forth, you know.  But I don't think so, I don't, you know, I -- I don't think it's like that.  I mean, war is definitely not -- not a pretty thing, but I don't think we're -- we're -- we're not -- we're not making terrorist threats to anybody, you know, we're not harming anyone, you know.  I -- I think sometimes we go too far out of our way to help people.  And maybe that's what it is, you know, may- I think that a lot of, uh, Islamic countries think that we should mind our business, but, you know, um, you know, Martin Luther King said injustice a- ev- any- anywhere is a -- is an injustice everywhere, and if we're gonna be about it, then that's what we have to be about.  And, uh, you know, I think that's -- that's definitely, you know, f- freeing the Iraqi people, um, over there, from -- from a -- a guy that was being a terrorist like -- like Saddam Hussein that k- -- I hear he killed one point five million Muslims, which is more Muslims killed than -- than anyone --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- has ever killed.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you have guys like this, that they do this in the name of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, God.  And I don't think God stands for that.  But, uh, you know, September eleventh just, uh -- I don't know if it made me feel, uh, less -- less safe, you know, because I still lived my life the same way, it's just sorta made me more aware that, you know, just like things happen in other countries, it can hit y- -- it's as easy happen here, you know?
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  It's just a scary thing.  I mean, now, do you -- have you traveled to New York a lot?
L:  Um, actually, let me see, I'm trying to think.  I -- I did go afterwards, um, I try to go like, twice a year and, um, but last year I only went once and the reason being was that, um, afterwards I -- I became pregnant and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I didn't wanna travel. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I mean, I -- it wouldn't -- it didn't change, you know, like my -- my lifestyle, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I s- -- I still went on living.  You can't be, you know, uh, holed up in your house.
R:  Yeah, 'cause you don't know where it's gonna come from, if it's gonna come.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, w- you know, what are you gonna do, just like, I -- you have to live your life.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  And -- but, you know, I think you just have to be a little more careful.
R:  Definitely.
L:  [NOISE]  And --
R:  Well, I was surprised to see that -- that it didn't change, uh, when they had n- uh, New Year's Rocking Eve, they had the same amount of people out there anyway.  I thought that that would make a big change and there'd be less people.  I think there was just a lot more security.  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it's like, uh, I know in New York City you would see guys walking down the street, you know, or smoking weed or -- or drinking beer, that -- that definitely changed, because now in New York City and Manhattan, you know, you got the -- the MPs around and you got the National Guardsmen and Reserves men, and you got extra cops and -- and you even --
L:  What, is that still going on there?
R:  Oh yeah, definitely, definitely.  When you go over there, you see these guys everywhere.  I mean, it [MN] you know, I -- I had lived in -- I'm from Philly but I lived in New York for like, fifteen years, and you know, you -- you wouldn't see that kinda stuff.  But now, you know, you -- you're on a -- on a normal s- Manhattan street, you'll see anti war craft, you know, you know, carrier with, you know, missiles ready to shoot up planes, you know, that -- that is just odd.  And it was odd first thing, but now, just like anything, you get used to it. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, you're used to seeing, you know, military MPs walking around in their guns and so forth and on, and, you know, there's less
