R:  Hi?
L:  Hello.
R:  I'm Pat.
L:  Uh, my name's Amber.
R:  Am- Am-
L:  I just -- h- -- yeah, have you done this before?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just talked to someone earlier and it was the same subject.
R:  Oh really?  Well, I think I had the same subject the first time twice too.
L:  Oh really?  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because I talked to someone last night and it was, um, it was a different subject, so ...
R:  Oh.  Family?
L:  I have --
R:  Was that the t- +topic last night?
L:  No, last night it was, um, censh- censorship, should, uh, government be able to censor --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- books that kids have access to in schools and stuff like that.
R:  Oh, the topics are getting [LAUGH] harder!
L:  Well, this one, yeah -- I mean, especially you -- I mean, you think they would change it, especially since you've, you know, been talking to someone about --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, that.  Then you kinda have to, I guess, repeat yourself, I don't know.
R:  I guess so.
L:  My[?] topic --
R:  Well what changes have you made since September eleventh?
L:  [SIGH] Well, um, I don't think I've made any.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- I've, you know, done a lotta talking about it and, you know, thought about it, but as far as, you know, actively making any changes in my day to day life, I can't say that I have.
R:  Okay.
L:  Have you?
R:  Well, I think they've been very subtle.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I've made a few I think.  I don't -- I'm no so quick to go out, um, uh, like, I have to go about twenty minutes to the mall.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't r- -- I used to always prefer to go shopping by myself but now I -- I --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- would rather go with somebody.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's not really a fear.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, I don't feel fearful, it just seems like it's smart to do, I don't know.
L:  Yeah, you just kinda think -- or just more aware of things.
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you kinda watch where you park and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, just kinda of, you know, yeah, be aware I guess that's it.
L:  Yeah.  I guess I was kinda already doing that, maybe I'm, uh, I'm too aware, [LAUGH] I don't know!
R:  Mhm.
L:  But some of the stuff, you know, that -- that this has [several inaudible words] over there, I think I was already kinda doing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- some of that stuff, so ...
R:  Are you a single person or ...?
L:  No, I have a -- I have a boyfriend.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But he's -- he's gone all the time 'cause he's --
R:  He travels?
L:  -- and over the road truck driver.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So he's -- course I go out with him, you know, when --
R:  When you can?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I've got two boys, so ...
R:  Well what age -- are they teenagers or ...?
L:  No.  Th- well, they think they are [LAUGH] --
R:  They're li- [LAUGH].
L:  But they're not yet! [LAUGH]
R:  They l- -- they're wannabes, huh?
L:  Yeah, they're, uh, ten and eleven.
R:  Oh.
L:  So they're just about there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, where are you -- where are you from?
R:  We live in Texas.
L:  Okay, well I'm in Tennessee.
R:  Okay.
L:  I can understand you a little bit better than I could --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- the girl I talked to earlier, she was from Oregon.
R:  Oh.
L:  So ...
R:  Well, she shouldn't have had an accent.  I'm originally from North Dakota and they usually start teasing me about words like wheat and, uh, I can't think of the other one now, but anyway, I must still have a North Dakota twang because every once in a while they go [LAUGH].
L:  Oh! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But, um --
L:  Um, well, as I was telling her, I think people probably have -- that live in New York or, you know, right around up in there where all that stuff happened --
R:  I was just gonna say that, yeah.  But --
L:  I think probably they have made more changes than --
R:  The more --
L:  Yeah.
R:  The most.  Yeah.
L:  Than the rest of us have.
R:  But I, on this -- on the, uh, internet I got, uh, into the homeland[?], um, website so that they email me was the terror -- with, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, with the alert --
L:  Oh really?
R:  -- ranges.  Yeah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yellow, orange or whatever.  And, uh, then, um, [LIPSMACK] they give you, um, information there, and -- and so I do get that, I'm --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I usually beat it and delete it but, I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it just seems like it's, um, [LIPSMACK] more -- m- -- a little more personal or maybe --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- more accurate than some of the, um, news.  You might just get part of the news saying --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or sometimes you miss -- you know, our communication is really hard, and I think that's why they're saying this, because I can say something to somebody and they -- th- -- like, they just misunderstand me entirely.
L:  Oh, absolutely, yeah, and you could say something, you think you're sending one message --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and the person is --
R:  You think you're saying it very clear --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but [LAUGH] -- but no.  And so, um, I l- -- I -- that's why I think I like to tune it right to that direct site.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But my --
L:  Uh, yeah, that is an interesting point what you just made about why they're studying this, I never really thought about --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- exactly why.
R:  I think that this must be something like that.
L:  That's right.  When I'm telling somebody something and I really want 'em to understand what I'm saying, I'll ask -- you know, I'll ask them to, you know, if they understand what I'm saying, you know, I ask 'em to --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- repeat it back to me, 'cause I really wanna, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- be sure.  Especially, I think, in personal relationships, you kinda really need to do that! [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I know they said, um, to some -- some motivational speaker I went to once said, you know, "If you're talking to someone you really wanna listen --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you should repeat what they say back to them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just like McDonalds repeats your order back to you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then you'll know that you're both on the same beam".
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, that's not always easy to do! [SIGH]
L:  Well a lot too, the other times person's not listening, they're too worried about what they're gonna say --
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  -- and making their point.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  And so they're -- they don't listen to --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- what's being said to them. [LAUGH]
R:  I think that's true.  As I get older too, I have more trouble, um, focusing, because I have to kinda think of what I'm gonna say --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because, um, otherwise I forget what the whole topic [LAUGH] was!
L:  Yeah, well I usually kinda -- kinda multi task when it comes to that, you've gotta be listening --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and then thinking about what you're gonna say at the same time.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know when my kids were your kids' age, I -- that's what -- you know, I knew who closed the door, I wasn't in the room --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I knew it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I knew who was over there making that noise and I knew somebody was making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and all those things.  And my husband could never understand because he --
L:  How you --
R:  -- wasn't that way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He could sit there and tune everybody out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and focus on whatever he wanted to do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I never have been able to do that.
L:  Yeah, I know what you're saying.
R:  Have you?
L:  No.  Um, not usually. [LAUGH]
R:  You can't really distance yourself from --
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  -- the home that you're supposed to be the h- -- the homemaker or whatever in.
L:  Yeah.  I guess men can -- or for the most part they can disengage because that's just not their role, I guess, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where women, you know, you can't just -- you can't just turn that part of y- off it when it comes five o'clock or something.
R:  Right.
L:  It just keeps on going [LAUGH] and going!
R:  Well, we've got that brain that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- connects, and they've got the one [LAUGH] that's more one sided.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  So ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  But --
L:  We'll just bash men during this conversation --
R:  Oh, the --
L:  -- we won't even ... [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, let's not do that.  But -- but it's true, I mean, they do -- they are able to focus more, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and tune out stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh ...  Well, if we didn't change too much since nine one one, then, um, do we know anybody that did?
L:  Um ... I don't think so, I mean, I really [inaudible] --
R:  I do.
L:  Oh, do you?  Okay.
R:  My b- -- my brother, who still lives in North Dakota --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- went out and bought two gas masks for he and his wife --
L:  Really?
R:  -- and two for his daughter and son in law.  Now, I don't know what he thought his mother was gonna do.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I don't know what he thought the baby was gonna do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But he went up to Surplus and bought four gas masks.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, [LIPSMACK] um, short of wrapping his house in plastic --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he didn't do that, but he got a generator.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And [SIGH] I don't know, I guess --
L:  Well --
R:  I don't know what motivated him, I ...
L:  Yeah.  Either -- well, that's g- -- that just reminds me of the Y. two K. thing, but --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  I -- I do know people who know people that, you know, done that kinda stuff.  But I don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- personally in, you know, my circle of people, I don't really know anybody that's changed anything.
R:  Are you affiliated with a church?
L:  No, I'm not.
R:  Okay.
L:  No.
R:  I kind of had a theory that maybe it was, um, something about our church that, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] helped us know there was somebody else in charge of [LAUGH] the whole thing.
L:  Yeah, so you don't have to --
R:  But that may not be true, but I mean --
L:  -- worry about it, or ...?
R:  Yeah, well, yeah, you don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You have more peace about it, I -- I thought.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But see, I might've been all wet[?], I don't know.  I just was a -- I just [inaudible] the thing that flashed in my mind I thought, "Well that's why he's all upset and I'm not".
L:  Mhm.
R:  But anyway ... [SIGH]  Um, I don't know anybody in [MN] the area in Texas where I live that did anything other than maybe take in a little extra water.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But they said that the stores were short on duct tape and all.  And I did see there at Walmart, uh, little Walmart had added a lotta duct tape but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I didn't, you know, it's --
L:  Well, I remember there for a short --
R:  -- still there! [LAUGH]
L:  -- short period of time, that people were kinda going on a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a shopping spree for -- for those items.
R:  Stuff like that.
L:  But I don't think it really lasted in our --
R:  I don't either.
L:  -- you know.
R:  And mostly, do you wonder if it's maybe media hype that does that?
L:  Oh, abso- yeah.
R:  Because they were saying, "Now these are things you should have --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- and dah dah dah dah dah".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they kind of rile people up into a frenzy.
L:  Yeah.  That's why -- well, I didn't -- I don't -- I guess I kinda don't worry about it or don't do it, 'cause I don't -- I don't think there is that much you can do about it anyway, I mean --
R:  I don't either.
L:  -- w- what are you really gonna do?  What exactly can you change?
R:  Would you -- would you fly in an airplane?
L:  Would I?  Well see, I never have --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so that plays into it too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not like I have before and now all of a sudden I wouldn't.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I never have, but my kids have, they've flown to Michigan to their grandparents, but -- I think I probably would, I think I probably couldn't pass it up, especially if it was going somewhere really nice [LAUGH] or something!
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Especially if somebody gave you a ticket huh?
L:  [LAUGH] Yes!  I just, you know, I'd --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- probably have to do it, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  Well, my granddaughter lives in Spain and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, she's only two, and she's gonna meet a -- she's gonna have a new brother in July.  And I'm trying to arrange for a ticket now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they're very expensive.  I don't know who's telling the story about the tickets being less because of the war --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] because they're not.  But, um, my husband, before he retired was a pilot.
L:  Oh really?
R:  -- and -- yeah -- and so, um, you know, we're used to flying and, um, although we don't have passes or anything, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't -- I wouldn't think twice about getting on an airplane.
L:  Well, ca- --
R:  Because you know what, the
