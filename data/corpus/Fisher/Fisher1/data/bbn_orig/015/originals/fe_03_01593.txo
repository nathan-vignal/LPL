R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Sarah.
R:  I'm Jesse.
L:  Hi, Jesse, how are you?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  Okay.  I think it does lessen the chance of terrorist incidents in the air.  How about you?
R:  Well, I would hope so.  I mean, --
L:  It doesn't do anything for root causes though.
R:  Um, I don't think so.  I mean, if you're that determined, then there will be, you know, little loopholes.
L:  Mhm.  So you don't feel totally safe? 
R:  Not totally, but, I mean, it's something.  I mean, I do feel a little more secure but, you know, not totally.
L:  I had to fly internationally just two weeks after September eleventh.
R:  Wow.
L:  And -- [LAUGH]
R:  You had to, huh?
L:  Had to from Boston, hmm, felt good.  
R:  Really?
L:  But, um, it was crazy.  It was crazy just watching things at that time.  I haven't flown more recently, have you? 
R:  Yeah.  I went to Ethica[?] recently.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But it was a small airport, so it wasn't really hectic or anything, but they were checking for, like -- like, bomb powder or something.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like, they were dusting my bags and stuff.
L:  Hmm, I don't know.  No, I had had an accident when I travelled so I was travelling with kid -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and a walker, and it was a great way to go, you know, the lines inside the airport for security check in were over a half mile long.
R:  Wow.
L:  But travelling as a mom, a blond and a cripple, we got whisked to the head of the line.  You know, but now I hear they're taking things like walkers and wheelchairs apart.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, just in case.
R:  I mean, you know, it -- it's unimaginable, like, fifty -- well, maybe not -- maybe even ten years ago, I mean, you know, who would have thought something like that could have happened? 
L:  It's -- it's -- it's craziness, I don't know, I don't know.  I mean, I think you're right though that if somebody's determined, they will succeed.  The really fabulous part right now, Jesse, -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is that, um, I was taking a nap -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the phone just woke me up, and my boyfriend is next to me having no clue what is going on [LAUGH] with this conversation.  
R:  [LAUGH] Some randomness with some strange person.
L:  [LAUGH] It's certainly in -- in the middle of my nap, it's, hey, "Let's talk airport security". 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It works for me.  But, um, oh, man, oh, man.  So do you fly often? 
R:  Not often, but occasionally.
L:  Mhm.  Have you had to go internationally since all this stuff? 
R:  Not recently, no.
L:  Yeah.  My parents also just went to Prague but I don't think anything really affected them.  On the other hand, I have a girlfriend who flies probably every week or two for her job and she seems to get pretty close to strip searched each time.  She's just got that "I'm a potential demon" sort of look about her I guess.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But you don't get picked on? 
R:  No.
L:  That's probably a good thing unless of course you do have evil in your heart.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Jesse, do you have evil in your heart? 'Fess up.
R:  Um, I don't think so, but -- 
L:  Mm, no- none. 
R:  I hope not.
L:  You're not prone to the kind of rage on the airplane either? 
R:  No.
L:  Drunken misbehavior? 
R:  Just road rage but that's about it.
L:  Road rage, okay.  Do you steal other people's deserts from the trays?
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  What's the worst thing you did on an airplane, Jesse?  'Fess it up.
R:  Um, threw some trash in the little compartment in front of me.
L:  That is really kind of tacky, don't you think? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, there might be a way for you to make it up to [LAUGH] the flying public.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Have you done others of these phone calls? 
R:  Um, twice.
L:  Wow.
R:  It was about censorship.
L:  Okay.  How are we doing comparatively speaking?
R:  Um, better I guess.
L:  Oh, okay.  There are those who say that I have a certain propensity for conversation, so -- 
R:  Yeah, I can tell.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, thanks, thanks. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, that's a good thing, I mean -- 
L:  And where -- where are you? 
R:  Um, --
L:  Or is that horrible question? 
R:  I'm a little on the --
L:  Pardon me? 
R:  I'm a little on the shy side.  I don't [inaudible] conversations.
L:  Oh, okay.  I -- I -- I talk to rocks and everybody else --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- that does but, um, you know, this -- this -- this is funny 'cause a friend of mine sent me this email about this thing at work on Friday.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I wasn't sure I even did the on line registration thing correctly given that I was multi frittering at the time. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  When but when I looked at my caller ID when I got home on Saturday, I think they had already attempted seven calls.
R:  Wow.
L:  I know.  I have a feeling the computer is off there saying, "I'm feckless and unreliable". 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Did you stay on topic with your other conversations? 
R:  Um, mostly.
L:  Mostly.  Okay, I'll get back to airport security.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um, [LAUGH] Yep.  The boyfriend is trying to embarrass me while I'm on the phone with you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um, okay, um, I don't think they actually want to do voice recognition of a woman giggling.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Or any other kind of thing.  [LAUGH] Um, I also -- my brother in law -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he's another one who they used to, this is before being terribly concerned about terrorism, they actually sliced open his brief case.  He had --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- the look of a drug dealer about him apparently and he would get pulled over going through customs every time, you know.
R:  He had that look.
L:  He had that look, too much gold jewellery I think.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] but something he didn't believe in as a concept.  The thing that really got me, though, is that I actually did know somebody who was smuggling.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Who never, ever got stopped, hey, and he actually -- he's, um, he used to travel on business also and the handle of his brief case would come loose.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And if he had to go, like, to Korea -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  He would smuggle precious gems in the handle of his brief case.
R:  In the handle?
L:  Yeah.  There's like a -- a leather wrap around the handle of the brief case.  Does that make sense?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow, that's ingenious I guess.
L:  Hm, sleazy is the word I prefer but probably 'cause I'm just not too keen on him as opposed to the propential- not +potential -- potential drug dealer who's really quite a lovely guy.  [MN] 
R:  Hm, I would assume so.
L:  [LAUGH] Like, I'm going to try to get -- I'm trying to get back on topic.  I'm trying to think about all the security.  It makes me nervous.  What about the guns in the -- in the cockpit?  What do you think of that?
R:  I think that's a great idea.
L:  You do?
R:  I mean, if something terribly -- terrible does happen, I mean, they -- 
L:  They can defend themselves.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Do you worry --
R:  Yeah.  I mean, if worst comes to worst, I mean, they can land a plane safely.
L:  Mhm.  Do you worry at all about, um, well, like if one of those goes around the edge a little bit, one of the [MN] pilots or -- 
R:  Ah, -- 
L:  Something, what if they have air rage? 
R:  Um, well, not as much as potential passenger hijackers.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh, I don't even like to think about it.  On the other hand, [MN] do you think about terrorism in general? 
R:  Um, yeah. I mean, --
L:  Like with this war? 
R:  You hear it on TV often.
L:  I don't watch TV --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so I think I stay immune to a lot of it but on the other hand, I was working for the last couple of weeks in town and having to take mass transit and I felt like a sitting duck [LAUGH] in some places in a way that I never, ever have before.
R:  I don't take subways or anything but I do take buses sometimes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I don't feel unsafe but, you know, it crosses my mind sometimes.
L:  Uh-huh.  See, I just -- this is going right through the centre of Boston and, you know, it gives me -- it was -- it felt like too good a target, though, you know, I also have family in England and, you know, back when the IRA was really active.
R:  Mhm.
L:  For a while it looked like they were gunning for Cathy, like they blew up, um, a car right on the walk she took every morning.
R:  Mhm.
L:  She missed it by, like, ten minutes.
R:  Wow.
L:  They did something in Harrods.  She had been there that day, you know.  It's kind of like, okay, "Make yourself safe, avoid her and you'll be okay", ah.  So do you think you're going to get asked to do more than the three?
R:  Three phone calls?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I guess.  We're only getting paid for three, but -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I guess I'll take a fourth call.
L:  They said that some people might be asked to do, like, twenty five.
R:  Twenty five?
L:  Yeah.  I figure that they're not looking for, you know, more, um, upper middle class suburban white women [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  --  from completely -- excuse me, completely warped background. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] We are generally probably the easy ones to get.  But, um, you know, it's a friend of mine's company I guess who's involved in this.  That's how I heard about it.  The boyfriend is almost kind of behaving.  He's not having a jealous fit about our being on the phone -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and that's a kind of progress I think.  Is anybody in the back --
