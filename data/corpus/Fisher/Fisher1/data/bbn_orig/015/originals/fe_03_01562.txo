R:  Hi, my name is Kenton Roberts.
L:  Yes, I'm Sherry[?] Biers[?]. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- 
R:  Ah, you know, for some reason the line is sounding a little faint to me so I feel it would help you to -- it would help me a lot if you'd speak up because I can barely even hear --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- what the lady was saying.
L:  Yeah, it was sounding a little faint to me too, yes.  Can you hear any better?
R:  Yeah, I hear a lot better, thank you.
L:  Okay.
R:  Is everything okay on your side?
L:  Yes, uh-huh, yeah, I can hear you now.
R:  All right.  Well, ah, to reiterate the topic, they were -- she was asking what our opinions were about, ah, ath- athletes going on strike.
L:  Yes.  I didn't know if they were talking about something current that was at hand or an athlete per se or, like a whole -- like, when baseball -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, had a -- was out there some years back -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- and they almost cancelled the World Series.
R:  Yeah, I remember that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ah, I think it was a strike about wages, right?
L:  Um, yeah.  That's nine times out of ten that's mostly, you know, what it is.  I mean ... [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, for any kind of strike.
L:  Yeah.  The only --
R:  Well, mm --
L:  Any particular ones stand out that you can think of?
R:  I don't remember very many strikes, you know, I don't -- I don't really look at, you know, major league baseball strikes as much as some of the others, but, ah, in my opinion those baseball players get paid a whole lot more than you'd think for what they do.  If you were put in the -- in a holistic sense --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- baseball players don't actually produce anything, you know, they don't make computers or design or make or -- or create cures or anything like that, they entertain.
L:  Yeah.  Unfortunately though it's sometimes -- it's like -- how would you say it though -- some of them, they're just -- the big mo- mo- money contracts are dangled in front of some of them though, it's like, [LAUGH] you know, young ones coming out scouting you'll see, like, even basketballers, some of them, though, something ridiculous for somebody that's just a rookie though.  They won't even ask for it and they'll dangle to them, "Oh, we'll give you", you know, "Sixty million or eighty million", so in my mind a lot of it is on, ah, the organizations themselves. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're almost asking for it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because they want somebody so bad so they'll just come up with some thing real high, you know, that maybe the person didn't even expect but, yeah, I know what you mean in the sense of it's not somebody, like, you know, like, you say, somebody that's invented some cure or something like that.  But, ah -- it's like I say, it's kinda I guess fifty fifty though because like I say, I've kind of follow, um, football quite a bit and I know ones where they'll just -- like I say they'll give them something ridiculous, they'll just, you know, offer and then probably somebody else sees that down the road and [LAUGH] well we're going to go on strike, ah.
R:  Yes.
L:  But, ah, -- 
R:  Also my opinion, ah, although, you know, holistically they don't make anything, economically, ah, you know, wages are kind of set by a deb- demand and -- supply and demand, like, you know, the average revenue comes in through that kind of thing.  But, ah, it also reflects on the wages and, you know, professional sports like your baseball and football and -- 
L:  Well, even NASCAR, yes.
R:  Huh? 
L:  NASCAR.
R:  Yeah, even that one too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's one of the most expensive sport.
L:  Oh, that's --  that's up there.  I mean, surprisingly I -- just listening I never realized basketball was so up there.  I mean, football, some of them really -- there they're really putting their body on the line more than some of them in a sense of where their -- how do you say it, their longevity as it too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, like some -- some race up into the fifties, I mean, you see 'em and even baseball they can go under the -- but, ah, I don't quite begrudge it as much on maybe somebody that has quite a, you know, body grinding thing because you look at somebody that makes a movie and what -- what ridiculous price do they get?  [LAUGH] They're not putting their body on the line at all, so -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, ah, -- 
R:  Really those industries that do not produce anything, I think they're basically run on demand.  Like, people -- like, people that really are into the sports -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  They would almost demand it.  It's considered part of the demand I suppose.  So there is a high want -- to put in different words, a high want for these sports to see these professional leagues go at it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So it controls these wages.  They -- like, all the people who go to the games, put in a -- a pretty good chunk of money and it gets pooled and distributed so there's a lot of revenue in there, and as far as those baseball contracts are concerned, ah, well, a contract's a contract.  If they signed on it, if those players signed on it, then they agreed to it.
L:  Right, mhm.  Of course, a lot of those things don't mean much because I know ones that have signed contracts for blank blank for six years and if they decide to cut 'em the next year, that -- that contract almost -- it's not like a true contract like a wage earner would have that's set and, you know, because they're -- they're not held -- held to it. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like -- like in a true other true thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But like I say, I'm -- I just was trying to think of any other ones that they meant but all -- like I say, the only ones I can ever remember, I mean, football, I can't remember a strike.  I mean back I just heard about ones that happened before I ever even knew about it, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, like there was the old one where some of them come in and, ah, what do they call them, like, well, just like a worker, they call them scabs, they came in and they had a few teams playing, but this is something I've just read about back in the -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know if it was in the eighties or this or they had one.
R:  Wow.
L:  But, ah, baseball, like I said, I do remember that year just, but other than that, I'm just -- I don't know, like, if NASCAR or basketball -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know if I've ever heard of any NASCAR strikes.
L:  Yeah.  But, ah, like I say, I guess -- I suppose -- how would you say it?  If there's -- there's like a -- I don't know what type of union, you know, there is involved, but I suppose if people that work at, ah, any other type of industry from teachers on down, I guess you could say that's their right I suppose, to -- sometimes they're not always for wages.  Sometimes they're for maybe a condition, you know, certain safety conditions, like, if it would be in, you know, NASCAR.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or different things, so I could see if it's in some line like that.
R:  Mhm, but not so much on wages but maybe the conditions.
L:  Right, mhm.
R:  Yeah, that's the only way I can imagine it either.  I mean, if somebody comes up to you and offers you five million dollars over six years to work hard, if you think about it, they play for maybe six hours, practice for maybe twenty, thirty, forty a week, that's -- that's still a lot of money.  That's maybe like hundreds of dollars an hour they're being paid, so I'm sure nobody complains so badly about that, but maybe, you know -- but maybe, let's say, one year into the contract, you're cut and you don't get like -- you don't get pro rated for, you know, how much you've worked for for that amount of the year.
L:  Mm.
R:  That would be pretty disappointing and, ah, angry especially if you've had a injury.
L:  Right, yes.
R:  So basically you work for these people, you don't get the money and then you're left crippled -- well, maybe not crippled but left in a way that you can't work for another baseball team.
L:  Right.
R:  So that -- that would -- that would be kind of lousy.
L:  Yes.  Like I say, I, ah, you know, knew of situations like that, like they were, so I -- I guess if, you know, a strike depending -- there -- there could be certain circumstances where I'd say no, it's bad for the -- but then usually it's funny, the -- the fans they are mad at first but then they [LAUGH] they'll say, "We ain't ever going to", like, after the baseball one, you know, it kind of -- people go and went down a little bit then, it didn't -- it didn't last very long.  It's, like, people will say if they have something they like, they're quick to forgive I guess.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But -- 
R:  Yeah.  Ah, so I guess, do you think we could both agree that, ah, it will be right for them to strike if they had -- if there was something unfair about the conditions of the contract?
L:  Yes, right.
R:  Yeah.  That would happen with just about anything.
L:  But usually it can't be because an in general thing would be because everybody is being offered a separate amount so I don't think I've ever heard of just -- oh, I've heard one person, they used the word "hold out" like one particular person, you know what I mean -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it ain't a strike because nobody's getting the same amount so usually, like, I say when they do go on strike, I am not sure, like I say, with the baseball one, if you know what I mean, everybody was getting a separate amount.  Some could have been very happy with their wage and so and it ha- had to be something else, you know what I mean? 
R:  Yes.
L:  Because it's not like an industry where we will say everybody's making blank an hour and we're, you know, we all want a blank an hour raise.  It -- it had to be a little more to --
