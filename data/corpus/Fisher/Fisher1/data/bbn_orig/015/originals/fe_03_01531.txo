R:  Hi.
L:  Hello.  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name is Cindy.
L:  My name is Nina.
R:  Hi, Nina.
L:  [LAUGH] Do you wanna go ahead and start talking about it or should I?
R:  Go ahead.
L:  Okay, is that, um, how do you feel about strikes or about how much they make, if it's fair, right?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Okay, well I think athletes are definitely overpaid.
R:  Yes, they are [LAUGH] definitely.
L:  [LAUGH] I think [LAUGH] that they're paid way too much and any money that they -- like, who -- who I think instead should be making so much money is, like, more nurses and peop- --
R:  Teachers.
L:  -- yes, teachers definitely too.
R:  Right.
L:  I think nurses and teachers are pretty much the main people that should be over -- should be paid much more than they are right now.  I think our athletes are definitely overpaid, um, they -- you know, like I understand that, you know, that they probably don't see their families very often because they are travelling or whatever but I still don't think they deserve all --
R:  That comes with the job though.
L:  Yeah.  And I don't think they deserve the millions of dollars that they make. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't either.
L:  [LAUGH] So, I guess we're in agreement there. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I can't see that playing baseball or football or basketball or whatever can pay so much.  I mean, in most states education is way underrated, way underpaid.
L:  Right, yep, I agree.
R:  We've shut down -- in the past two years we've shut down and three or four schools in our school system --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and we're having to merge like one elementary school with another, you know, so --
L:  Just because of teachers?
R:  Right.
L:  Not enough teachers.  Yeah, that's awful.
R:  Well, there's not so much that there's not enough teachers, there's just not enough money to keep these schools open.
L:  Yeah, I see what you're saying.
R:  So --
L:  Where are you from?
R:  Oklahoma.
L:  Oklahoma.  I'm from Dallas, Texas.
R:  Wow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's the first time I've got anybody on these calls that's even near me.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, most people are --
L:  Yeah, last time I had someone from Detroit, I think.
R:  Right, um, I had someone yesterday from Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And they were like, "Are you from West Virginia?" um, "No [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- I'm from Oklahoma" and --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, we've had several athletes come from Oklahoma --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and go on to Dallas.  I mean Dallas is my favorite football team.
L:  [LAUGH] The Cowboys?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yes.
R:  And when they got rid Emmett Smith I was so happy.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I just -- you know, I felt he was dragging 'em down --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but, I thought, "Okay, he's gonna go to this other team and they're gonna double the salary he was making with Dallas"
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he was already one of the highest paid football players --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in the whole NFL.  You know, I -- I don't understand that and --
L:  Yeah, I don't either because -- because, you know, I mean, I understand like, you know, the ones bringing in sales or whatever, people coming to watch these great players or whatever but I still don't think that the should be paid all that money.  Or if they are, I think -- like I know a lot of athletes do, like, donate money to charity but not nearly as much as they probably should, you know.
R:  I think they donate enough to charity to get a tax break.
L:  Right, and then that's for people to say, "Hey, we do give some of our money to charity" but --
R:  Right.
L:  I don't think it's nearly as much as people should.   I mean I can't pinpoint and say, "It's this athlete or that athlete" because I really don't know my statistics to say, "Oh, he gives this much" but I know the majority of players are not giving enough money to people that deserve the money, you know.
R:  Right.  And -- and it's funny that you can't hardly pinpoint someone -- 'cause I -- I agree with you on that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you can't hardly pinpoint someone as to who's giving to charity and who isn't --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but it's easy to pinpoint those who are leading the strike for more pay.
L:  Right.
R:  Those who are out there in media saying, "Look, you know, I get out of here and throw a ball round so that makes me a multi millionaire" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I'm not making enough money so give me some more.
L:  Right.
R:  And, I think, that's ridiculous.
L:  I do too. [LAUGH]
R:  And, I think, that they could get out there and play the same type of football or the same type of basketball or whatever sport on the same income that a teacher or a nurse makes.
L:  Yep, I agree too.
R:  They make more than the President of the United States.
L:  Do they? [LAUGH] Insane.
R:  Yeah, he makes an average I wanna say of a hundred thousand dollars a year.
L:  Wow, that's not the --
R:  Where --
L:  -- while they make millions and billions.
R:  Exactly.
L:  That's crazy.  Yes, I don't agree.
R:  And there's never food --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in a lot of cities.
L:  Right.
R:  The homeless shelters are overrun.
L:  Right.
R:  And these guys are running around, and the women too, the women too.
L:  Right.
R:  And they're running around screaming, "I don't make enough money so I'm not gonna play until you give me more".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they'll always get more money 'cause it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's --
L:  'Cause they can't afford to not have them play.
R:  Right, it's a multi million dollar industry.
L:  But -- right.
R:  And, I think, education should be --
L:  Number one.
R:  Right.
L:  I agree.
R:  The- they're trying to pass a lottery here in Oklahoma so that more money can go towards funding education and there are a lot people opposing it and, you know, I'm one of those that will say, "Well, our taxpayers will just keep going to Texas or Kansas or Louisiana --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or whatever to spend their money instead of putting it back into the state.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, they're trying to make it to where anything generated by the lottery will go directly to education.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think that'll help to a point.
L:  Yeah, and I remember when lottery started that's what it was meant for, like, the percentage of it was supposed to go towards education but I remember seeing, I don't know if it's still like that, but I know a lot people weren't -- a lot of people in the education field weren't even seeing that money even though it was supposedly made for that purpose.
R:  Right.
L:  But --
R:  See that's the one and only purpose they're wanting it here --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you figure, you know, the athletes they've got a better shot at hitting the millions by joining up [MN] in college or high school or whatever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- hoping to get a pro career --
L:  Right.
R:  -- than any one person does hitting it in the lottery.
L:  I agree.  I agree with you totally.
R:  And unfortunately the United States don't have a whole lot doing the soccer and that's the biggest sport we have in this area of Oklahoma.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's soccer.
L:  Soccer?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, we've got the Mavericks, we've got the Cowboys, we've got the Stars, we've got, like, you know, a good amount of people but, you know, still I don't hear anything extraordinary about these people that, you know, about the amounts of money they're giving to charity or the amounts of money they're giving towards education --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or anything.
R:  Nope, not at all.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And I think it's absolutely ridiculous.
L:  I agree.
R:  I think too it's going to be real controversial.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The subject they're putting out because they're gonna find some big football players somewhere that's just gonna go nuts and --
L:  Yeah, and really sports is not a necessary -- you know, the sports industry, is not really a necessary industry, you know, like --
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  -- these kids, you know, where did they get their education from school, they have something to fall back on.  What happens when these athletes get hurt, they pretty much have to reply on whatever education they've had already --
R:  And --
L:  -- because, you know, they're not going to go too far.
R:  Right.
L:  And --
R:  Well, like with Michael Irving with the Dallas Cowboys.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He had this serious [MN] neck injury and they said that one more hit could kill him.
L:  Right.
R:  Or Tory Aitman[?] he had to get out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because he had so many concussions.
L:  Right.
R:  And he was complaining, you know, well I don't have enough money to retire right now though.  [LAUGH] You make millions of dollars a year, if you don't have enough that's your fault.
L:  I know.  Just sell one of your houses, you have plenty. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  But -- 
R:  I mean, we --
L:  -- yeah, it is ridiculous.  Um, I don't understand how they don't see it's ridiculous amounts of money, um, I don't see how they can't give, you know -- like, yeah I'm sure they're giving like hundreds or thousands of dollars but what about like the millions that you get, you know, think about how much good it could do in education system or how much it could do in the health care system, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for people that can't afford health care and, you know, really need it.
R:  Right.
L:  But --
R:  Well, they have a football player with the Kansas City Chiefs, uh, Derek Comet --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- bought a real fancy fast car --
L:   Uh-huh.
R:  -- with all the money that he had, wreck it, killed himself.
L:  Wow.
R:  And all the money that he had didn't go -- you know, he didn't have it marked to be donated, like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to a school or an organization or whatever and it's all -- he's been dead for almost ten years and it's all still tied up in probate.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I -- I think something needs to be done with it.  I think they need to quit caving in all these strikes --
L:  Yeah, I do too.
R:  -- these people are putting on and --
L:  Yeah, I think maybe if people took a strike on going to the, uh, games and, you know, like going to see these sports players who make all the money and there's -- which are the reason why I think we could prevent a lot of the money that they're getting to not -- you know, not in such large quantities if we were to strike somehow.  But that's -- that's not ever gonna happen because --
R:  No.
L:  -- there are too many sports fans, including myself, you know, I'm a sport's fan too and, you know, but it's not -- it's not realistic, it's not a realistic idea, even though that might help -- help with the money issues.
R:  We had tickets to see the Dallas Cowboys play a few years ago --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they were talking about going on strike because they didn't make enough money -- this is back when Dion Sanders played for 'em.
L:  Yeah, I remember that.
R:  We sold our tickets.  We didn't even go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you know, I told my husband, I said, "I'm not going to be a part of this, I'm not gonna spend my money and go watch these idiots play --"
L:  Yeah, when they don't deserve making money.
R:  Right, you know, and my son -- almost his entire wardrobe is Dal-
