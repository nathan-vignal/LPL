R:  Hello?
L:  Yes.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  Hi [LAUGH] I'm Sharon.
R:  I'm Nicole.
L:  Hi, Nicole, how are you?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  Oh, I'm good thanks.  This is my first one so --
R:  Oh, it's mine too.
L:  Oh okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I guess we get to talk about this.  I wonder if they come back on or if we just go ahead and go.
R:  I don't know, I think we just go ahead and go 'cause they said that they'll notify us when ten minutes is up.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, okay.
L:  Well, I think -- I think it's outrageous what they get paid. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I do too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Um, and to go on strike because they want more money is even more outrageous. [LAUGH] I --
R:  Right.  Now, are -- have these strikes been -- been recently also?
L:  Um, I haven't heard of anything like within the last few months but I know, you know, in the past probably year or so I mean, they've had those baseball strikes --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they're, you know, threatening, you know, strikes here there and everywhere.
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I remember hearing about a threatened strike [SIGH] I guess it was toward the end of the season, baseball season just before the world series because I remember hearing talk about that might not be paid -- played because of, um, you know, an impending strike.
R:  Right, I do remember that.  Mhm.
L:  But, I guess -- yeah, but I think they worked all that out because the world series did go on.
R:  Right [LAUGH]
L:  Um, and --
R:  Yeah, I -- I agree with you I think that it's -- and I think especially in light of, you know, the current world events and I don't know if you've seen any of the information out there about, you know, how much money our -- the -- the military makes and firemen and police men and teachers and -- and the people who have such a great responsibility and such a great influence, um, and to compare that to sports player [LAUGH].
L:  It's quite disproportionate.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  Yeah, I mean -- you know, they are, they are risking permanent injuries that, you know, in some cases, they could be -- if they were hit the wrong way they could be paralyzed from the neck down, um, you know, I understand things like that, you know, Achilles tendon injuries and things like that are quite painful but, you know, to be paid way more than -- [LAUGH] I mean many times over what the President makes, you know, who's at risk every day of being --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- killed by anybody.  Um, I don't know I just don't think it's -- it's quite, you know, right, um -- and there's other people that I think are being paid way too much besides but, uh, you know the athletes do make too much, I think.  Way too much.
R:  Right.  Um, [MN] yeah, I agree and it -- it also seems like, um, oh, I'm not sure how to -- how to express that [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but you see them getting paid and I -- I guess, you know, there are -- there are many of them who, um, you know, do all sorts of things with, uh, charity and, um, um --
L:  That's true, yeah.
R:  -- so that's a benefit but, um, often along with all those positive things that you see that they do with charities, um, you also see what else [LAUGH] the money goes towards.
L:  Yeah, yeah, it's like we have one of our Bucks[?] just, you know, was arrested for an altercation after some kind of a traffic incident.  I don't think it was an accident but an incident -- basically road rage.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, you know, that -- it brings a lot of negative publicity to the teams and when people are being paid that amount of money they should make sure that everything they do is absolutely perfect and beyond any kind of questioning or reproach by anyone.  Uh --
R:  Right, I agree.  And then often those are -- those are the people that our children, you know, look up to as -- as --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- idols and, um, yeah, so --
L:  Yeah, yeah and, you know, the -- it -- they need to be more -- uh, conduct themselves a little bit better.  I mean not to say that they can't be, you know, have their own lives and be human but, um --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know, it's just like the President.
R:  Right.
L:  If the President can go out and have road rage because that would reflect negatively on his position --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and these, these high paid, uh, athletes should be just as social conscious as anyone else, or more so because they are, like you said, idols for the kids.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Uh, they're people that they wanna emulate but if they're going to be having, you know, negative behavior then that's not something we want the kids to emulate at all [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  You know, we want to see -- we want them to see them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in a positive way when they're doing, you know, different community affairs and helping.  I mean there's some -- some of the Bucks here that, um, go buy a house for somebody on- -- you know, one or two a year --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- you know, for a family that needs it.  Uh, most of the time it's a single famil- -- uh, a single parent family.  And that's great.  And I think those kind of things should get more publicity so that, you know, maybe the -- the negatives don't get as much focus with the youth as the positive that these people are doing.
R:  Right, yep, I agree with you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, yeah as far as the strikes go, um, [LAUGH], um, yeah I think that to demand, um, to demand more almost seems [LAUGH] --
L:  Obscene? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah [LAUGH], yeah.
L:  Like public ra- -- public rape almost.
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Sanctioned rape.
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I mean, I don't know, I mean, some players are more valuable than others but, um, maybe if there -- if professional sports as a whole had some kind of, um, salary capping -- I mean sure they'll give it to them in other ways, a bonus or something I -- you know, you hear about that all time, where they rework the deal so they give them a lower salary but then they get these higher bonuses.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, you know, if they wanna do that, that's fine but I think that, you know, the salary -- you know the "salary", you know, should be brought to something that's more manageable because some of these kids just see that and they think, "Oh wow, man, that's what I'm gonna do" and if something happens or they're not that good then they -- it doesn't inspire them to do anything else.  So, by putting high price tags on -- on athletics as opposed to intelligence in other areas, like encouraging them to go into, um, you know, chemistry or math --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or, you know -- 
R:  Right.
L:  Ah, maybe that was our ten minutes.
R:  Oh.
L:  Maybe that's -- you know, maybe that would, uh, you know, would help to get our youth into something that was more constructive in the long run for the whole society.
R:  Right, exactly.  That's -- in fact that's exactly what I was going to -- to say too is, um, sports, you know, it's wonderful we have entertainment, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, you know, that's certainly a -- a benefit and a positive thing and, um, but right, with the -- the rest of the society needs to function we need to have doctors and [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm, yeah, we need to --
R:  -- uh, school teachers and --
L:  -- encourage them to go other ways, uh-huh.
R:  Right.  Mhm.
L:  Exactly.  Yeah.  I guess that was our ten minutes, huh?
R:  You think that -- did they say anything or was it just kind of a --
L:  It just went that [NOISE] kind of sound.
R:  Oh, I didn't even hear the beep I just heard a pause.
L:  Oh, I wonder if they actually come on and say anything or they just, um, just do that?
R:  I don't know.
L:  It would be nice if we -- you know, I mean, this is our, you know, this is our first time so we'd -- we would like to know what's supposed to happen.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that might have just been -- I don't know I wasn't watching the clock so I don't know when we got on the phon- -- maybe my phone will tell me.  My phone will tell me how long the call was.
R:  Oh okay, that would be great.
L:  Yeah, let me look, hold on.
R:  Okay.
L:  Oh, it says it's been nine and a half minutes.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I guess they single us at the end of eight.
R:  Oh maybe.
L:  Was that what it was?
R:  Maybe they give us a two minute warning.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, or maybe it -- 'cause I know the calls were supposed to be eight to ten minutes.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  So, maybe they just let us know at the end of eight.
R:  Okay.
L:  Now, do we just hang up?
R:  I don't know [LAUGH].
L:  Or do we have to wait for something?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Mm.
R:  Um, well do we have any other opinions concerning that that we can [LAUGH] for another minute or two?
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah, I think we've probably extinguished most of it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah, we're -- we're not in favor of strikes.
R:  Right.
L:  And we're not in favor of the high [LAUGH] salaries and the reasons that they are striking.
R:  Right.
L:  If they were striking for a good reason like they were protesting something --
R:  More humane treatment.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Maybe they were getting really lousy treatment by the coaches --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or something like that [LAUGH].
L:  Or not even anything to do with them, that they were striking because they wanted, um, better government regulation of, maybe, I don't know, something, drugs or whatever.
R:  Right.
L:  Or, you know, or to get more police.
R:  Right.
L:  You know if they were doing it to make some kind of a social point for the public welfare then, yeah, maybe it'd be okay.  But because they're going out because they want more money --
R:  Right.
L:  -- when -- well, some of the athletes don't make -- I mean football players make the big bucks --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, um, you know, like basketball and baseball they don't make anywhere near as much.  And that's why, I think, there should be some kind of regulation as to, you know, salaries limits capped, maybe even ...
