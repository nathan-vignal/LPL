L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, this -- hi, this is Costa.
L:  Hi, I'm Tanya.
R:  Hi, Tanya.
L:  How are you this evening?
R:  Uh, pretty good.  Uh, in for the night.  How 'bout you?
L:  Uh, yeah, in for every night.  Have a six year old.  Don't get to go many places.[LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Well, are you, uh, a big sp- uh, a sports fan, first of all?
L:  No.
R:  Okay.
L:  I know about it.  My husband's a Bears fan, has been since he was little.
R:  Oh, okay, right.  I'm a, uh -- a pretty, uh, uh, hardcore sports fan, um, for certain sports, myself.  Um, and I wondered what are your, uh, what are -- what are your views on, uh, on, um, strikes?
L:  Well, I'd, hm -- professional sports taking strikes, no, it does not rank up there with the union workers or any of that.  I think it's all ridiculous.  Their salaries --
R:  Why's that?
L:  [SIGH] I think they get paid way too much.
R:  Well, why do you think they get paid too much?  I mean, compared to what?
L:  Uh, a teacher.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  No, I mean, they're -- they're completely different, you know, professions.
L:  Yeah.  And they're good at what they do, but [SIGH] I don't know -- it just seems to me that millions of dollars for one season of work is excessive.
R:  Do you get mad when you find out that, like, Mel Gibson makes fifty million off of a film?
L:  Well, I think that's ridiculous too.  [LAUGH]
R:  But does it bother you as much or ...?
L:  Um --
R:  Or him or any- or anybody you like or don't like, you know, either way?  'Cause it's the same thing, you know, I mean they make obscene amounts of money too if you look at it that way.  I mean, you --
L:  Well, yeah, they do.  They make obscene amounts of money.
R:  Then you think -- right, then you think about there's -- for every one in them there's probably ten thousand actors who have to wait to go up and -- and get a break and so on.  So, uh, it's kind of a -- an all or nothing game I think.  Uh, sports is entertainment too and that's the way I look at it.  Uh -- um, growing up, uh, you know, I played a lot of sports too.  And, uh, I'm not saying I would have ever have made it to the pro level, but I think when you're -- when you're a kid and you're playing you kinda go through all the motions and you kinda have those dreams.  Um, and I'm one of those guys that, like -- I guess probably, uh, every pro athletic knows that at some point between the ages of, you know, eight and, uh, eighteen, uh, busted a knee or broke their leg at the wrong time and just never really was able to get back into it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's the way I look at it for -- for pro athletes.  I mean, I -- I know they're not owed money for -- for surviving that long, but it kind- -- it really is so much a numbers game that I don't blame 'em one bit for getting as much cash as they can by the time you get it up to that level.  I mean -- and that's the way I look at it.  Um, it's a numbers game for them.  I mean, if -- it -- it could've just as easily have happened to them, uh, to happen to their, you know, best friend growing up who, um, busted a knee and, you know, has never -- ended up not being able to play anymore.  [LIPSMACK] So ... 
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I guess you can probably see why I'm -- [LAUGH] why I'm looking at it the way I'm looking at it, uh, it's, uh --
L:  Well, yeah, yeah.  You've got a very valid point, um  I don't know, I guess I just -- not being -- maybe it's because I'm not a sports fan.
R:  Mhm.
L:  My mother would probably have a totally different view, um --
R:  Sports fan?
L:  She's a sports fan.
R:  [NOISE].
L:  Basketball in particular.  She likes her college ball.
R:  Mm.
L:  She's a Razorback fan.
R:  Oh!
L:  And, um -- um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- the basketball mainly, but she'll do all the Razorback, she don't care, even the Ladybacks too.  [LAUGH]
R:  They have a good year this year?  I haven't been involved at all.  [MN]
L:  Um, I -- I don't know.  She's gotten excited over a few games.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and, you know, like I said, I married a, uh, football fan.
R:  [MN]
L:  He's a Bears fan from way, way back.
R:  Yeah.  I got a friend whose a -- a -- who grew up a Bears fan.  They're -- they're pretty -- they're pretty insufferable [LAUGH] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- when they're winning.  Uh, when -- when they're not winning they're a little quieter no doubt?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But they're diehard, you know?
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  The Bears fans seem to be diehard.  It -- it's an all or nothing thing.  [LAUGH]  They don't -- they don't fade away when their team fades away, you know?
R:  [inaudible] that's good.
L:  Um, and of course then my son he's into soccer and bowling both.  So --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's, um -- 
R:  You gotta -- you got that vibe going through your household.  So --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you're exposed to it, yeah.
L:  Yes, I'm exposed.  And I've learned to diligently sit through a -- a Bears game while it was on.  [LAUGH]
R:  Sure.  Well, that's very unique [several inaudible words].  Uh, yeah, well, you know, I -- I think, uh, you know, uh, as -- as far as the strike it's, uh -- th- the thing -- [MN] I think the thing that most people look at is they -- they -- they can't get out of their head that it's a game, they're the -- they're being played -- paid to play a game, which, yeah, you know, it's not the most important -- it's not -- it's definitely not the most important thing in the world, there's -- there's, you know, a million other things that are way more worthwhile.  Um, I'm not going to argue with anybody about that, um, but, you know, I -- I think that it basically comes down to i- -- if the money's not there they wouldn't be getting it.  Um, you know, i- i- i- -- a lot of people think it's just like, you know, i- the -- the price of a -- of a ticket to get into the arena is what pays for these salaries, but, um, you know, that's like -- that's the tip of the iceberg.  There is so much money they get from -- from television and broadcast rights, there's merchandising money, there's -- there's all this other stuff and, you know, why should the owners have, you know, even most of it?  Maybe they should have most of it, but why shouldn't the players get, uh, you know, a share of that?
L:  Yeah.  I guess it's the same as the royalties from the movies or a book.
R:  Yeah.  Then the other thing is with, uh -- i- i- it's kinda with actors and actresses too, but also the athletes when you think about it, when -- you've probably seen this -- I mean, they'll -- they'll talk about a guy whose like old when he's only, like, you know, thirty years old or something like that.  He's, like, he's a veteran, he's almost done with his career.
L:  Well then, Michael Jordan's over the hill!  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  I mean, he's, like, what, he's thirty eight?  I mean, you know, give --
L:  He's -- no, he turns forty this year I think.
R:  He turns forty, yeah.  But, I mean, think about it.  I mean, you know, fine, for an athlete that's over the hill but, I mean, for real life?  What about ...?
L:  I know.  He's --
R:  You know, that's --
L:  -- he's not even middle aged yet.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, you know -- and, you know, [MN] if you can -- b- but you know, consider a perfect guy like Jordan who gets to, uh, play when he's forty and still play well, I mean, there's, [MN] you know, a bunch of other guys who, like, wash out at, you know, twenty five or something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, what do they do the rest of their lives?  Again, that's not a problem that you need to be worried about, but the way they're looking at it and, you know, they're not prepped for any other kinda career and maybe they put -- invested so much time to this point in their lives just getting themselves to -- to that level of play in the pros that, you know, it's not like they're -- they're gonna be thinking about doing anything else.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- make your money then and after that go to school, just live off of, you know, whatever you -- you made in your -- your limited time as a pro.  So ...  But anyway ...
L:  I think one of the things that really gets me though is it seems like the -- the kids are going pro younger and younger.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah.  They're -- they're [inaudible] though, um --
L:  And they're skipping their education.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  At the time when it's the easiest to learn it.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  I mean, even though they may wash out at twenty five with thirty five million stored in the bank, they're not gonna want to go back to school then.
R:  [LIPSMACK] No.  Uh --
L:  And they're not gonna -- I mean, they're still gonna -- I mean, Lord knows they'll have the money to --
R:  Well, you know what?
L: -- do whatever.
R:  A lot of times they don't.
L:  But it's not gonna be ...
R:  Yeah.  It's not gonna be easy.  Well, you know, the -- the sad thing is a lot of times they don't.  I mean, they -- it -- it sounds really -- it's -- you can't have much sympathy for somebody who will lose close to thirty five million dollars in, you know, five years or something.  But, um, yeah, a lot of times -- and then you hear about it all the time, they just -- they're -- they're washed up and their money's all gone and it's, like, oh, you know --
L:  And then what?
R:  -- it's gone, yeah, and that's not --
L:  Because they -- they didn't -- they didn't put away nothing to get an education, they didn't go and get the education.
R:  Right.
L:  They started way too young.  Mom and dad didn't put their foot down.  I mean, you know?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I think that's a -- that's a big problem.  Um, you know, you see mostly in hoops right now, um, you know, they don't even go to -- they bypass college.  Like with Brian James it looks like he's not going to go to college.  He's gonna hit the pros.
L:  And some of 'em are even opting out b- before the end of their senior year of high school.
R:  Oh, well, I --oh, yeah, yeah.  It's, um -- well, you know, uh, I -- I -- I have mixed feelings about that myself, um  I mean, you should be going to college.  I mean, probably for th- -- for their sakes they should, but are they really -- you know, are they learning anything in college other than playing basketball?  Well, you know --
L:  That's the other thing too.
R: -- most of them aren't.  I -- I should say.  I mean, if y- -- if you had a chance, I mean, hey, you know, they go to college maybe they'll -- they'll, you know -- they'll open their eyes somehow and -- and find out -- discover something else that they're -- that they have an interest in, that's worthwhile, like any scholarship.  But, um, on the other hand -- I mean, my-- my other thought's, like, well, you know, they don't want to go to college to actually, like, get an education.  They want to go to -- to just play, uh, in that program, that level of basketball, and then from there show they can get in the pros.  And if that's the case then just skip college and go straight to the pros, you think you're ready.  
L:  Well, the other thing too is -- is the -- the system in and of itself I think in college perpetuates that, well, you come on and go on the scholarship and we'll make sure you pass your classes.
R:  Oh, yeah, but ...
L:  And, I'm sorry, but it's a raw deal.  Any way you play it, it's a raw deal in high school.
R:  Well, it's probably on high school too, you're right.  Yeah, I -- I -- I totally agree.  Um, you know, I mean, you -- you know, there are a lot of argu- -- I -- I think you're in school to learn, um, and, you know, athletics is part of learning, but the way it is now it -- it , you know, it's set up like that at all, it -- it's -- set up as industry.  Um, you know.  I -- I -- I don't know what your school experience was like but, you know, I -- I had to bust my arse to get a scholarship.  I mean, you know, it wasn't in athletics either, and then, you know, it's like, uh, you know, that -- it -- it helped a lot as far as paying my way through school.
L:  I went to college on a pill[?] grant.
R:  Uh -- oh, yeah?
