L:  Hi, this is Irene. 
R:  Hello, this is Dusty.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm good, how are you? 
L:  Good.
R:  I'm ready for bed. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, me too, but I'm glad to earn ten bucks.
R:  That's right.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's still paying ten bucks.
L:  It's only ten minutes.
R:  Right.  Um, so we're supposed to talk about September eleventh?
L:  Yeah.  What changes have you made? 
R:  What changes have I made?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I'm more suspicious.  I've just made changes in my thinking, I think, than anything else.  Probably not in my lifestyle.  What about you?
L:  Well, um, --
R:  Where are you from, but?
L:  Ah, Ohio.
R:  Ohio.  I live in Texas.
L:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We're worlds away.
R:  Yes, we are.
L:  Um, I, I guess that, um, --
R:  [NOISE] You what?
L:  Um, you know, I'm more afraid to get on an airplane.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I think the biggest thing for me is, um, I live, I live in an apartment building --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's not a high rise or anything, it's just four, ah, stories.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  But we have, um, ah, I don't live too far from the airport, and there are planes and, and then the medic helicopters and whatever that keep flying over.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And every time I hear one of these things it, it doesn't sound like I think it should -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it, it makes me so nervous.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And I'll say this real quick, 'cause I don't want to take up all the time --
R:  No, no, no, that's fine.
L:  -- but just this, this one evening I was sitting here at the computer, just like I'm doing now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, I saw a, a helicopter and, and, um, it kept coming right at the building.
R:  Oh, scary.
L:  And it would circle around and come right at us again, and, and it was just hovering in the area.  Scared me to death.
R:  Oh, it would.
L:  My husband said, "Well, you know, don't call the police".  I was gonna call the police.  He said, "Don't call the police".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, but I was scared to death, and now we found out that, ah, somebody had paid the helicopter, ah, guy, um, to drive -- drive the around -- fly them around so that they could drop baggies of their, ah, loves one's ashes.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  [LAUGH] I thought, how bizarre. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That is pretty bizarre.
L:  But I thought, I thought the helicopter was gonna come crashing right into the building.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I was scared. [LAUGH]
R:  That would be frightening, I think.
L:  Anything else for you?
R:  Mm, no.  We've had, um, I guess -- I live near Amarillo -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, there's always been -- like, I think they run military practise missions from an air force base in New Mexico over here.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, one time I was driving to college and these guys in a big plane, like, got their plane way down over the top of my car, I could see them and they're laughing at me, you know --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it was crazy.  So that kinda stuff, I guess I'm used to. [LAUGH] And I just think they're idiots --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know. [LAUGH] Too much testosterone.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So you do -- go to college?
R:  Huh -- yes.
L:  You go to college?
R:  Oh, I did.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That was years ago. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah.  
R:  But, ah -- 
L:  I would think that they wouldn't be allowed to, to do that, to come so close to vehicles and such.
R:  Oh, I'm sure they weren't supposed to.  But I was sorta out on a country road, and there was just -- just us [LAUGH] out there.
L:  Hm.
R:  I think it was, ah, kinda early in the morning too, if I remember correctly, about six o'clock in the morning.  So.  They had their fun.
L:  [LAUGH] At your expense.
R:  Well, yeah.  It scared me at the time, but then when I could see them laughing I was, like, "Oh great."
L:  Hm.
R:  Go flirt on your own time. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You're about to blow my car off the road.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I haven't flown since then, but I think I would, if I really had -- you know, if I really wanted to, or, or needed to.  Have you had to fly? [NOISE]
L:  No, I haven't had to.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but I've also kind of just, um, avoided doing it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I have a couple of sisters who live in Kentucky and I've -- I don't know, I've just found excuses not to go down.
R:  Mhm.  [inaudible] it is kinda scary.  But, um --
L:  And then, you know what, you don't -- you don't know who to trust, because like I'll be in the library sometimes working on their computers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, ah, you hear these people talking in their foreign languages and stuff --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they, they, they look like, um, ah, a foreigners --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, and I get, I get suspicious and antsy and stuff.
R:  Mhm.  Well, I mean -- [MN] I am too.  I just think there's, there's a lot of hatred in that culture, and they have them -- you know, the means to be here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And we have this sort of open door policy, accept all sorts of people, and, you know, it's politically incorrect to, you know, to be suspicious.  I heard a guy though once -- well, he was -- he was a preacher, he was a Baptist preacher --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but he had been Muslim and he was a, oh, I don't know, I don't know if he was Iranian or whatever, but he was Middle Eastern, and he said, he can't believe that when he goes to the airport they don't search him.  He said, "It's my people that have done this --" 
L:  Wow.
R:  --  you know, that -- look at me."  And he says, "Of course we should be more suspicious", and he, you know, to me it makes sense.  But, you know, we want to be all politically correct, and --
L:  Not me, I'd rather -- I'd rather be safe than correct.
R:  That's what this man said.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I would rather they checked me and, you know, take fifteen minutes out of my, my life, than take my whole entire life, you know, than -- and to me that makes sense.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But.  I don't know.  But that -- that is, it's a scary thing.  It's a scary thought.
L:  And the government certainly doesn't do things the way, you know, we would like for them to do.
R:  Of course, I'm sure we don't know the whole story either.
L:  Oh, I'm sure.
R:  I mean, we only know what they want us to know.
L:  You know, ah, I don't know about you, but it -- it seems like, um, us- usually for men, they're -- they're saying that there's, ah, government, ah, conspiracies covering up all these different things --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that have happened.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And not only about this, but, you know, all kinds of things.
R:  Right.
L:  And it's like, ah, ah, why is it that the men always think these things?  Are they right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know.
R:  I, I don't know.  I just think, you know, twelve years ago when they went in there, and they -- we have all this high tech equipment and, you know, intelligence, there's no way that twelve years ago when, when they were in, ah, Iraq, that they didn't know where he was.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I just think that's amazing, that they could -- I mean, if he was such a big threat, why don't they send a sniper in there and just kill him, and then deny it?  I just, I just think we don't have the whole story.  He can't be that good.  Nobody can.
L:  [MN] Um, and I don't know why, ah, they were -- they had started this out searching for a different guy.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, hm.  Oh, he was kinda thin and he had a beard and moustache, long hair, ah, --
R:  Now, when was this?
L:  Um, before they actually went over and started the war.  They were looking for this other guy.
R:  In Afghanistan?
L:  I think so.  And darn, I'm having a mental block, I can't think of his name.  But then it seems like all of a sudden they, they dropped him --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and now went looking for Hussein.
R:  Right.
L:  And I'm wondering, why would they do that?
R:  Oh, I don't know.  They, um, -- I can't think of the other guy's name either --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- now that you say that.  Hm.  My daughter would probably know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know, for, for --
R:  They say that -- well, they're still in Afghanistan.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But you're right, it sounds like the sort of, you know, abandoned.  And, why?  Who knows. [PAUSE]
L:  And, you know what, this, this September eleven thing, that was, like, two years ago.
R:  Right.
L:  Ah, if, if we were gonna do something, why'd they wait two years?
R:  Mm, I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, there's -- there's, ah, all kinds of opportunities for, ah, even more things to happen than have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and why were we waiting, what were we waiting for?
R:  Yeah, I have no idea.  Do you think there's anything good that's come out of September eleventh?
