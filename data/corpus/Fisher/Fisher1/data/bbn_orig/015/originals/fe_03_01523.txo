R:  Hi, I'm Rachel.
L:  Hi, I'm Tim.  Is -- is this live?
R:  I -- I guess so [LAUGH].
L:  I thought it was going to be computerized.
R:  Yeah, it's kind of odd.
L:  Um, let's see.
R:  So, I'm supposed to tell you what I think about athlete's going on strike?
L:  I guess so.  And that they're overpaid.
R:  I think that they're horribly overpaid.
L:  [LAUGH] Especially when they -- they act like such babies. [LAUGH]
R:  I think -- yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I think that they have the right to go on strike if they want to, you know, but I don't -- I don't feel sorry for them.  So, I don't really have that much to say about it --
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm not a bi- -- I watch MBA playoffs, that's -- that's it [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I don't watch the whole season, I just wait till the playoffs [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I usually wait to the playoffs for -- I mean, I -- I usually watch the super bowl, I wat- -- you know the MBA playoffs --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that kind of thing but I don't -- I don't follow it that closely but, um -- but, jeeze, especially with all their endorsements and things, I don't -- I don't really feel that bad, you know, they're -- because they're not -- they're not making the millions of dollars that they -- they want.
L:  Right.
R:  I'm like, "Well".
L:  There's some, I guess, like hockey and baseball, you know, unless you're a superstar you don't get endorsements and you only get --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and baseball's a [MN] horrendously long season but it's -- so it's a lot of travel but, yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they signed up for it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's true, I mean --
L:  They don't -- they don't have to that job.
R:  Yeah and I mean I work eight to five every day and I -- I would -- I would love to some more travel in my career that, you know, that kind of thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I'm not gonna -- I don't know I mean if I went on strike they would just say, "Okay, well we'll get somebody else". [NOISE]
L:  Right, right and then you'd only make five million when you should be making ten.
R:  Right.  Yeah, right [LAUGH].  And I feel like --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- there's so many people that -- that wanna do it that, you know, if you're going to be a baby about it and you don't make enough millions of dollars then go do something else.
L:  Right.
R:  Let -- you know, let some kid that wants to do this do it.  So, that's -- that's pretty much what I think.  I don't [NOISE] think it's --
L:  I don't -- I don't disagree with ya.
R:  [NOISE] I to- -- I -- and I mean when it come on TV and they're talking about it I just change the channel I don't -- you know, I don't care.
L:  [COUGH] I don't -- [NOISE] oh, oh sorry.
R:  That's okay [LAUGH].
L:  I don't watch, uh, live TV as much any more [LAUGH] I just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- set the VCR to record the shows I like.
R:  So, you can buzz through what you don't like.
L:  Exactly.  That's nicer.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I don't -- I don't think I have ten minutes worth of stuff to say about the --
L:  No, maybe we can -- I wonder if we can cheat and talk about the airline strikes?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's sort of related.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Whether, you know, the mechanics --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they all were gonna strike.  And they always lead to a recession to it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] It's like, "Hello, bad timing people".
R:  Yeah, I don't -- that's been all over the news.
L:  Mm.  I guess American got lucky with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- some of -- some of the -- was it the stewardess were wanting to strike and they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- rescinded, uh --
R:  Yeah, and they had -- is that -- is that the one where they -- the stewardesses decided to take less?
L:  Yes, I think it was -- I think that was for American -- I'm not sure what happened with United 'cause they are, you know, also operating in, whatever, chapter thirteen.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  And then, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm not sure if the mechanics rescinded for them or -- or what.
R:  [NOISE] I can't believe how broke they are with how much -- how much flights costs but they have gone down, I mean -- and I know that, you know, that travel's gone down so much.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But -- [NOISE]
L:  So, there's only two --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- years like two thousand and two thousand and one when those bigger ones were making money and every other year they've been losing money.
R:  Really? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, Southwest and something Blue.
R:  Jet Blue.
L:  Jet Blue, I mean they're -- 
R:  I think --
L:  -- they're the exceptions.  They're -- they were making money every year.  So --
R:  And I wonder how that is 'cause I know that like Southwest their prices are -- [NOISE] I mean they're kinda bare bones.  I mean, I guess, maybe that's why they don't --
L:  That's why, mhm, the infrastructure's smaller, they don't have as many planes.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah and they don't -- 
L:  They --
R:  -- offer the more expensive luxuries that some of the other airlines do.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] Peanuts and whatnot. [LAUGH]
L:  And I'm a little worried about the pilots [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Do they propose --
R:  Oh jeeze.
L:  Who're they getting 'cause they're not overpaid --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- like American and United.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, let's get some temps in here [LAUGH], it's like --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH]
R:  No, thanks. [NOISE]
L:  Uh, you might go postal today, you never know [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah.  It's a little scary.
L:  I mean that's a high stress job, I think.
R:  [NOISE] Oh yeah!
L:  I wouldn't do it.
R:  Yeah, see there is -- maybe they could, you know, they could go on strike and make millions of dollars.  They're -- I mean, they're responsible for people's lives.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They travel a lot and while some of that would be a perk, if you have a family, you know, that'd be hard to be away all the time.
L:  Right.
R:  And I -- I do feel more sympathetic about pilots [NOISE] that, uh, you know, athletes.
L:  Right.  The, um, was it United's pilots were doing something like that?  That's -- that's been a while though.
R:  Yeah, I think it was United's.
L:  Well, some of them have tried and, I think, they may have gotten maybe some concessions.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I would think that United would, as far as pilots would go, would be the higher paid.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think I read that American was next.  You know, American bought up TWA and so, you know, you just increase the infrastructure and -- and then you hope to make money [LAUGH] that way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, they -- both them may have to do some serious redesign of their -- their business model otherwise they're not gonna be around.  I mean, what they're gonna expect the government to bail to 'em out, which means us [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  Bail 'em out every time and then they might be expecting that, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know what they think they're gonna do.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, they're gonna have to -- they gonna have to do something, like -- I'm just -- I'm surprised I thin- -- I mean, I didn- -- I guess -- you know, I haven't really followed the airline industry and I had no idea that they were making so little money.
L:  Yes, um, in general it's, uh, a high cost business --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- everything -- I mean, like the gas is, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- way expensive.  
R:  Yes. [NOISE]
L:  You pay a lot of people and then they only way they can recoup the money is the passenger and then the cargo.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's really it.  And so, um --
R:  When you -- when you've got like Southwest doing rock bottom prices because, you know, like you said, their infrastructure is smaller, they've got to compete with that.  So --
L:  And no one -- no one can understand airline pricing anyway --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for the regular airlines [LAUGH].
R:  Yes.
L:  One day it's a thousand dollars a ticket, the next day it's two hundred.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I -- I flew to New York and when -- when we were sitting there talking about, you know, airlines we'd had some -- we were delayed 'cause of some kind of mechanical difficulty and so we're all kind of freaked out and we're talking about how, you know, maybe I'll just forget the ticket and -- and this woman sitting next to me was like, "I paid six hundred bucks for this ticket I can't --"
L:  Wow.
R:  "-- I can't just forget it".  I had paid a hundred and seventy.
L:  Wow.
R:  [NOISE] You know, and for the -- I mean we were sitting, she was sitting right behind me, it was the same kind of seat [LAUGH] you know, it was -- we got the same free snacks, it was just -- it was unbelievable and she -- I was just lucky I had kept an eye out and was waiting and waiting and, you know, I'd gone on line and said notify me if it goes below a certain amount and all that.  And she -- she'd had some kind of -- kind of emergency thing and she'd just purchased the ticket four days before.
L:  Right.  Any time it's less than two weeks before you pay a lot more.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] She'd paid six hundred bucks.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] I was like -- well, I -- I feel back, you know, she was -- when I -- when I -- she asked me how much I paid and I thought, "Jeeze, I should lie to this woman 'cause she's gonna [LAUGH] she's gonna have a heart attack".
L:  [LAUGH] She's --
R:  Or kill me, I don't know what's gonna happen here --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but she was just --
L:  Yeah, they -- the theory is they -- the so- -- you know, the sooner you book --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, helps them that so that they know, "Okay, this plane's getting full".
R:  Yes.
L:  And then, I think, they actually just start increasing the price the closer it is to the flight date.
R:  Yes.  
L:  'Cause they know --
R:  Well, the plane was really full so it probably -- I mean if she just bought it recently they probably had a pretty full plane and just, you know, like you said, thought, "We've only got a few seats left, let's try and sell 'em for six hundred bucks 'cause who cares if we don't".
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  You know.
L:  I think -- yeah, supply and demand so the -- fewer seats means they'll be a higher demand.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, there'll be someone if -- if you called you would probably say, "Well, six hundred bucks, I think I'll wait". [LAUGH]
R:  Right, and that's what I was doing.  I was kinda waiting for a cheaper price but --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  [NOISE] -- you know, she had some family thing come up and she had to go that weekend.  So -- well, I couldn't believe that.  I had read that that, you know, stuff where they say if you -- you ask the people that sit around you on the plane you guys will have different prices you paid.
L:  Oh yeah, very, very different.
R:  Well, you know, I'm -- I'm never
