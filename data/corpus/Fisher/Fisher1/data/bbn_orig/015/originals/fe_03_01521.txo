L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Michael Rosenfeld, I go to University of Texas.
R:  Hi, I'm, uh, this is Aton Hollywood, I go to University of Maryland actually.
L:  Neato, so we're both sports fans.
R:  Yeah, I guess so [LAUGH].
L:  So, what's your opinion on sport strikes?
R:  Well, I mean, I -- yeah, I'm a big sports fan and -- but, I guess, sometimes it's hard to sort of take the strikes seriously, you know, when they're complaining about, you know, they only get six million but they really need seven million.  I mean, it's hard to feel sorry for them, you know, given that most people don't make anywhere near as much as they do.  Um, I think what they -- I generally think what they make is deserved just because of the -- the revenue they bring in, you know, if they didn't bring in so much in ticket sales and TV and all that then they probably wouldn't be getting paid what they do.
L:  That's true.
R:  So, what'd you think?
L:  Honestly -- like for some sports I can see it but I'm very much against baseball for the amount of strikes they've had first in the last like ten years.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they always complain and they don't really have such a hard [NOISE] they don't really exercise all that much.  I don't --
R:  Base- baseball players, you say?
L:  Baseball players as compared to like every other sport.  Like, for example, hockey players, they play more games, they're actually act -- like, they're physically active and are in danger of injury.  Like a baseball player, the worst thing that can happen to you is you get nailed by a ball.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And like they sit around, you know, you hit a ball, fine, you run a base, you run a base you've done for the day.
R:  Do you think that when they strike they -- they really care about the affect that it might have on, like, fans, you know, um, not wanting to follow the sport anymore or they don't really take that [LAUGH] into consideration?
L:  Well, considering how many times they've striked in the last ten years, haven't you noticed that like it used America's -- like baseball used to be America's pastime, now no one cares anymore.  That's what I've noticed.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Seeing the number of times they've striked, I think it's been four or is it five?  I've lost count.
R:  I don't know, I mean they almost had one last year I know, um, I mean it seems like they're -- they're -- there is certain fans that if they strike, you know, they really upset and say, you know, "Well, I'm never going to watch baseball again" and then there are other fans that, you know, will watch baseball regardless if they go on a strike or not.  And, I think, the athletes know that -- that, you know, they're not going to be -- I mean, if they strike they may lose some fans but there's still going to be fans that will come and they pay the tickets prices, so I think that probably goes into it.  But they know they can strike and, like, not lose all their fan base.  Even though they probably don't wanna do it as much as, um, as they might.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  Oh no.  What -- what other sports have striked, I haven't really kept track.  I thought that was only wh- -- there was a basketball strike that -- how many years, like --
R:  Yeah, it was the bask- -- the basketball like, I think -- I think it was different because there was like a lock out, like an owner's lockout, um, it wasn't like -- I don't think it was the players that were striking but the owners -- I forget -- I forget why they -- maybe -- maybe it was the players like I just -- I just know that yeah, you're right baseball has h a lot -- has had a lot more strikes, um, but I know -- I know basketball has had something.  Hockey might have, um, I'm not, you know, too sure about, uh, about all of it but -- I don't know.
L:  And, uh -- oh well, I guess that pretty much kills the [inaudible] topic.  Do you watch the final four?
R:  Did I watch the final four?  Yeah, I -- I did, uh, this was actually the first year that I, uh, I wasn't at the final four.  I went down the last two years because Maryland was in it the last two years so I went to watch it.  It's pretty good, uh, had a good time.
L:  I -- I was pretty embarrassed by, um, University of Texas.  We -- we had a pretty bad game.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If -- if you actually watched that game it was -- it was pretty bad.  We just got --
R:  Blown out.
L:  -- blown out by a bunch of highlight reels.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was basically --
R:  You -- you don't by any chance, um, you're not by any chance a journalism major, are you? 
L:  Uh, no.  
R:  Oh.
L:  It's like I would have gone to the game but I didn't have any cash at the moment.  The tickets prices weren't actually that bad, they were about a hundred thirty dollars.
R:  Yeah, when -- when I went it wasn't bad and we had like the best seats because they have students like -- for last year when we won the national championship we were like behind the basket.
L:  That's pretty good.
R:  You know, and, uh -- but I ask 'cause I'm -- I'm working --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, I'm a journalism major but I'm working with a guy from the University of Texas, he's a journalism guy, this summer so I wondered if you knew him but, um --
L:  No.  So, you get, uh, perks, I guess, if your journalism get to be --
R:  Well, I -- I actually went on my own, with my own money, but I ended up like writing an article, um, just like about the fans and stuff.  Like we -- like we sent our sports writers, like they get all expenses paid and press passes and everything but I just went on my own and like ended up just writing an article just about, like, the fans and stuff like that, um, but, you know, I don't know.  Are your from Texas originally or ...?
L:  Oh no, but I just lived here a long time.  But it --
R:  Where you from originally?
L:  Where am I from originally?  California.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, so -- I don't know I was kinda upset with the play.  Especially --
R:  Well --
L:  Especially like with our women's team also is kind of funny.  If you watch the women's basketball, which people rarely do.
R:  How far did they get this year?
L:  They also go to the final four, if anyone cares.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, I -- I was the game and I was laughing 'cause we were leading the whole game and then, like, the last minute or so, uh, what happens was -- well, like they give up -- first of all they give 'em three [inaudible] for no reason and then they let them convert four points off a free throw and then, like, they missed their own free throws.  So, it was just like ridiculous.  They lost like ten points in two minutes off some stupid players.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was -- it was just like, "What the hell" you don't let four points off a free throw and like twice, you know, on the second bask- -- three row basket they got --
R:  But, I guess, are you more -- are you guys more of a football school generally or ...?
L:  Yeah, we're a big football school.  Football tickets cost a ridiculously large amount.  Like you pay like forty or fifty dollars a football ticket.
R:  Well, is there still like as much enthusiasm over basketball, like, with the final four even though you're generally like a football school?
L:  Well, yeah -- for like since this is the first time we went to final four for like fifty something years everyone was really excited about it.  You know, it kinda picked up, at the beginning year no one really cared about basketball.  I didn't attend any of the games.  I was like, "Oh, who cares" and then, like, we started winning and we got excited and in to it.  Then there was a big fury over it after we lost our final four.  You know, we were --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We'll see what happens next year [inaudible] hangs around.
R:  Did you guys have any riots or no?
L:  No, we don't riot, we're too lazy to riot prop-
R:  We -- we did.  We riot, like, the first year we were in the final four we lost in the semi final and then we rioted.  And this -- and then last year we won the whole thing and, like, we rioted even worse than like when we had -- when we lost.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, our school's a little ridiculous like that. [MN]
L:  Yeah, I think we're too drunk to riot.  By the time you're ready, like done with the game you just don't wanna walk anywhere, it's like, "No".
R:  Yeah, well, I don't know but --
L:  Yeah, we're not a big riot school for foo- -- I don't know about football, what would happen if we actually ever won anything.  'Cause we never win any big games, even though, like, we were ranked number one, or so -- number two in the country at one point.  And we won like all our home games but then when we were gonna go to the final -- I forget what the final game is called, like which --
R:  Oh, like the whatever bowl.
L:  Whatever bowl.  Like we went to the Con[?] Bowl this year.  Yeah, we go screwed by Texas Tech, if you watch football.
R:  Yeah.  So, your school is at Austin, is that where it is?
L:  Yeah, I'm at the Austin branch.
R:  It's pretty big.
L:  Yeah, it's -- we're the biggest university.  It's like fifty something thousand people.
R:  Really.
L:  It's, uh, it's not that bad.  You like you'd think that's bad but most of the people don't actually live near the university so during the day, you know, it's crowded, around five or six o'clock, you know, you don't hard- -- you hardly see anybody.
R:  Yeah, I mean, we're thirty thousand so it's pretty big, not as big but we've a lot of commuters, like people in state so it takes away some of it, you know, as far as like living on campus and that kind of thing.
L:  So, what -- are your on campus housing prices ridiculously expensive like ours?
R:  Yeah, well, I mean, I guess you're at state university as well so we've had a lot of like budget cuts, you know, and like tuition increases and all that.
L:  Yeah, we've had the tuition deregulation, what about you guys?  So -- so, they're starting to think about tuition deregulation plus they just jumped the prices on us.
R:  What do you mean like -- by deregulation, like?
L:  Like, uh, our -- our tuition is set by the government like tuit-
R:  By the -- by the state government, right?
L:  By the state government and now the thing about deregulating that -- like there's a bigger debate on that, we're trying to prevent that because first of all -- like if they do that we don't know what the prices will be like.  It'll be like kinda like supply and demand type system.
R:  Will can they -- can they raise it whenever they want? 
L:  Yeah, they raised it but they can't like raise it -- th- the raises are mandated by, like, certain laws.
R:  Yeah, see like that's like -- we had that and they just like -- I don't know if was law but they said, you know, "We won't pass a tuition increase any higher than like whatever percent".  And then they were just like, "Well, you know, the state budget is so bad that we have to --" they did more than we thought they were going to so -- so, screw all you, like.  There's really no protection.  Like they say they don't want to but they do it anyway.
L:  That's what's been happening to us and we're like, "Oh, bullshit".
R:  Like we actually had -- this year -- like they've -- in the past they've raised tuition from like year to year but this time they actually raised it like mid -- mid year.  Like we -- for the spring semester like we paid our tuition and then we came back and they sent us a bill that was like, "Well, you actually owe us like another three hundred dollars".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause like they'd never ever done it like between semesters before but it was so bad that like they had to do that and like people -- 'cause you paid your bill but then they sent you another bill, like, "Well, we really need another, like, three hundred dollars" although --
L:  Did you actually -- actually pay it?  Because I would've --
R:  You have to, I mean, like, you have --
L:  I would've -- I would've like jammed that thing down my legislature's throat.
R:  They --
L:  I had like in March --
R:  They actually -- they actually had, um, a few students that filed a lawsuit against it saying that it like -- it violated some law, like contract between students and, um, and the university but the lawsuit got -- they didn't -- they didn't win it.
L:  They didn't win the lawsuit.
R:  [NOISE] No.
L:  Under what jurisdiction.  Like I would have the same -- I would have tried and done something the same way.
