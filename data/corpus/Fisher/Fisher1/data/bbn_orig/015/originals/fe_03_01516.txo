R:  Hello?
L:  Hello, I'm Stephanie.
R:  Hi Stephanie, I'm Leah.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good, how are you?  Where are you calling from today?
L:  Um, I'm in San Francisco. [NOISE]
R:  I'm in Seattle.
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH] So, um, I guess for September eleventh I think, um, I haven't travelled as much as I probably would have liked --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, especially to far away places. Um, the farthest I've gone maybe is just an hour flight away, you know, I don't want to go very far because I don't know what could happen [LAUGH] basically.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, so I think I've cut back on my travelling.  What about you?
R:  Um, I -- yeah, I've done less travelling, but it's mostly been because air fare has just gotten so difficult.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  And I find it's kind of a pain to go through airports.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I feel, I feel actually kind of confident that we're not gonna probably see another issue crop up on an airplane any time soon.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, you know, part of me is, like, "Oh, my gosh", okay, people are just -- you know, the airplane industry is just kind of over reacting, and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it makes it just more difficult for us to -- and then in a way that means the terrorists have won, because they've changed the way we live our lives.
L:  Yeah.  Um, do you think that, you know, since they already used the airplanes, then they might be using something else instead, because, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not that many people are flying, basically.
R:  Yeah, I definitely think they're probably gonna be using something else.  [NOISE] I mean, I'm more concerned about shipping containers, than --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- airplanes.
L:  Or, what about, like the food that, um, is grown in other places or something, you know, do you think that, um, they might try to do like bio terrorism or --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- adjusting the food or anything like that? 
R:  I hadn't actually thought of that before.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  What do you think? [NOISE]
L:  I don't know, I think if that happened that would suck, but [LAUGH] um, I don't know, 'cause I read somewhere that, um, it's hard for the government and other, I guess, people with higher power to go into the farmlands and, you know, restrict the, the farmers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- from doing whatever they do to their produce and things like that, because the, the farmers, you know, they have their own business usually, and it's up to them what they want to do, and, you know, it's hard to keep track, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I don't know --
R:  And then -- is it --
L:  Oh, go ahead.
R:  Is it hard to then keep, ah, keep an eye on what then gets into our food chain?  I mean, once they get to the supermarkets and stuff?
L:  Yeah.  I don't know. [LAUGH] But...
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I don't know too much about the food shipping industry or what, what controls they even have. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] But I don't know, I mean, it's really hard to say, and then, I'm actually surprised we haven't seen, um, more of the suicide bomber kind of attacks --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like you see in other countries.
L:  Yeah.  But I think, you know, some of them, some people are, um, suicide bombers during the war, right --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think, I think they were still doing that, but I don't know.  You mean you, ah, you would expect to see more of that here, or no?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I feel like we haven't really seen, seen that at all, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- especially when you think about, oh, even places like Ireland.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Where things are just blowing up all over the place, it seems.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.
R:  So do you feel that, um, you know, things close to you have, have changed?  [NOISE] Um, I know I've got some friends who have had to go and register themselves because they're from other countries.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And it's really kinda scary, because in Seattle there were a whole bunch of people from Middle Eastern countries who had to register, and then --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a bunch of them got arrested for --
L:  Really?
R:  -- for not having their papers in order, and sometimes --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- their papers really weren't in order, and sometimes it was just an administrative glitch, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, it makes me kind of upset for my friends who have to go through this and be treated this way. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I haven't experienced anything like that, it's just, um, I guess for me when the war, the war -- the war -- yeah, when the war started, um, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I, I have to cross a main bridge over here every day to go to work, and, you know, the day of there was all these helicopters around the bridge 'cause --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- they wanna keep an eye out and stuff, and then it's just like, "Oh, I don't wanna go to work anymore, I don't wanna, you know, risk my life trying to work and all that kind of stuff", and then later -- you know, that was just the first day, and then as the weeks went by there weren't any helicopters there, and I was just like, okay, I thought they were trying to protect us --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and now, you know, there's nobody there [LAUGH], so...
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I mean, at first I was like, "Oh, what are they going to do up there, flying around, you know, that's not gonna help us", you know, we're on the bridge and nobody else -- it doesn't seem like they're doing anything on the ground level, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're just up in the air protecting whoever, I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, yeah.  That the only difference I've seen, um, and then of course when I did travel a little bit, um, the security in the airports and all that, but sometimes I didn't feel they were being, um, very thorough with their checking.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I heard an interesting thing recently, which is [NOISE] ah, you know how that guy tried to light his shoe on fire?
L:  Oh, a while ago, right?
R:  Yeah, yeah, a while back.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, apparently one of the things you can still bring on to planes is lighters and matches and all sorts of other incendiary devices.
L:  Really?
R:  Like, you can't bring toenail clippers, but you can --
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  -- you can bring a lighter.
L:  Um, okay.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's pretty weird.
L:  Yeah, because, I mean, it's still -- it could still be harmful to someone, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Why would they -- they shouldn't even allow that because you're not allowed to smoke on the airplane or anything, right? 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, well 'cause --
L:  That's kinda odd.
R:  -- the reason the tobacco industry lobbied so hard to get it -- to get it allowed is because they wanted -- [NOISE] whoops.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They wanted people to be able to light up as soon as they got back to --  to the ground.
L:  Oh.
R:  And so they didn't want to have people have to go looking for matches.
L:  Uh-huh.  And so the airline industry okayed that? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they did.
L:  Huh.
R:  Because tobacco's a really big lobby.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so then you've gotta wonder, well then, you know, are they really doing it because they care about [SIGH] because they care about our safety, or are they just doing it because they want to create the illusion of safety?
L:  Mhm.  Or are the just doing it to, um, make money, or make profits?
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  Because, if they just allow people to just start smoking, you know, right after they get out of the plane, then they're encouraging smoking and, you know, all the -- they're neglecting all the causes it has, and so they know it's harmful to people, but they just -- it -- it sounds like they just want the money from it, you know.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  So.  Um.
R:  Yeah, I guess we still have a few minutes left.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [MN]
R:  Um.  Yep, it's been over two years, huh?
L:  Yeah, it has.  But I think it's gone by kinda fast. [LAUGH]
R:  What's that?
L:  I think it's gone by sorta fast.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  Actually, when it happened it was a couple of days before my birthday, I'm, like, oh, jeez, what kind of birthday's this, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.  And, ah, does every time your birthday happen does it remind you of it now? [NOISE]
L:  Mm, not really.  I think -- well I think, you know, people still talk about it, and so I, I'm reminded of what happened, but I don't really, you know, dwell on it, or you know.  I just have to move on, and, you know, don't -- not to live in fear or anything, or, you know, get all sad about it, [LAUGH] because it's in the past now.
