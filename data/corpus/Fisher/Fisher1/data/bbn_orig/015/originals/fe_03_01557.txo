L:  Yeah, hi.  My name is Melissa.
R:  And -- and mine is Nadine.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  And this is my first call.  So, I'm a novice at this.
L:  Oh, well, same here.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, good.  Okay.  Uh, now, they're talking about professional a- athletes and we're supposed to give our opinion.  Is that correct?
L:  Yes.
R:  Striking, I should say.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I think that, um, they make enough money as it is and them striking for more money is gonna make people not want to go to the games, and it's not 'cause they're being selfish, you know?  It's all -- it's supposed to be a sport, entertainment for us, you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- for the people.  And I feel that they get paid -- I know they get paid contract, you know, money, they get costs --
R:  But they make a lot of money out of those contracts.
L:  Yes!
R:  They do.
L:  I think so.
R:  And I remember when they had the big strike -- oh, I don't remember how long ago -- maybe seven, ten years ago -- we had season tickets for the game and a lot of people did not pick up their season tickets after that --
L:  Ye- --
R:  -- because I really think, as you said, they make a lot of money.  And I realise they have a short career, but I don't th- -- and the prices of everything goes up at the games, it's very expensive to take a family to a game now, to even go by yourself.
L:  Yes.  That's true.  So, this whole strike it seems like, um, [LIPSMACK] when their contract is up, or when a lot of 'em their contracts are up, it seems like they go on strike 'cause they want more, but they're not putting enough play into it, you know, like they're -- how you say?  They're losing their touch, but they still want the same, you know?
R:  What do you mean?  You mean they don't play as well?
L:  Yeah.  Like a lot of 'em --
R:  Ok- --
L:  -- okay -- they'll -- one year they get MBP or something like that.  So, yeah, you expect them to get a lot.  But then they expect more and more and more, you know?
R:  I think it's totally -- their salaries are out of control.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I really do.  All -- all sports are out of control.  Maybe fights not [LAUGH] have their lights on if you consider boxing a -- a -- you know, a sport.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  But I've never heard of boxers going out on strike and I really think it's -- I think it's really bad.  I think it's bad for the sport, uh, it's -- it's becam- -- it's become big business, big business by the owners, big business by the players, big business by the people who sell, uh, [LIPSMACK] products from it.  I think the fact they -- in fact, they charge for autographs is terrible.  I mean, what happened to 
L:  All the support --
R:  -- a tradition and -- and all the fun?
L:  Yes.
R:  Right.
L:  Yep.
R:  I mean, it- it's hard for me -- it's hard to understand how people could sit there and get excited over somebody that's making a million dollars for doing it.  I mean, I realise it's, a sh- -- as I said, a short career, but I think it's ridiculous.  I think that teachers could -- should strike, and I don't think they should, but they have more right to strike --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- than -- than --
L:  Exactly, 'cause they're doing something for the community more or less.
R:  That's right.
L:  If you don't want to watch sports you don't have to.  But you have to go to school.  You -- you know, you need your education.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
L:  So, like, that I understand too, you know?
R:  And you need a good education.
L:  Yes.
R:  I mean, the --  So I -- I totally disagree with it, and I don't know if there's anything that can be done about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, just this -- like, the Angels were just sold -- are you familiar with that story?
L:  Y- yes.
R:  To a man.  I don't know how many millions he paid for the team, well, obviously he's gonna want his money back.  So, he's not gonna be real anxious to pay the players more --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and yet they're gonna want it.  And it's the same old theme -- the more you have the more you want.
L:  Exactly.  So, um [SIGH] ... so, what else do we have to ?
R:  Uh, d- well, I don't know.  Discuss that.  But it's kinda -- we both agreed unfor- unfortunately.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But maybe if one of us, you know, had a different point of view it'd be the end of it.  We did- -- we didn't, we did agree.
L:  Yep.
R:  So, there really isn't much more to say except what teams are going on strike now?  I -- I haven't been ...  I've been watching the war too much to pay attention --
L:  Exact- -- ex- --
R:  -- to sports.  So ...
L:  -- I see, the other topic I could go into.  [LAUGH]
R:  But ... oh, well, yeah.  They -- they didn't -- they didn't ask us on that one.
L:  I know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Unfortunately.  I could -- we could go round and round on that one probably.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I mean, w- do you know what sport's about -- supposed to be going on strike now?  Or they just generally speaking?
L:  I guess just a [SIGH] -- a couple of people, not like a -- not a lot of the players.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Not a lot of the teams either.
R:  But one particular sport?  I've -- like I said, I haven't been keeping up with sport.
L:  Oh, n- uh, I know.  I've been into the -- into the war also.
R:  Yeah, right, like everybody else.
L:  Yep.
R:  Sports kinda takes the back seat.  I hope they realize sports should take a back seat now.  There's too much else going on.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause a lot of people are not interested in going to see sports right now, you know?
R:  [LIPSMACK] That's right.
L:  So ...
R:  And they get temperamental or they want more money.  But, like, I don't know what else we can say.  It's kind of s- sad.
L:  Yep.
R:  For this one.
L:  Straight to the point!  [LAUGH]
R:  We made our point.  If we had -- unfortunately, or fortunately, we agreed.  I don't think we have much we can do about it.
L:  Yep.  So, um, d- [SIGH] this is my --
R:  [LIPSMACK] This is your first calls?
L:  Yes, this is my first call.  This is my first time doing [NOISE] this.  So ...
R:  Me too.  So, we're kinda don't know what we're doing, but we're doing ...
L:  [LAUGH] And then after this what do we ...?
R:  They've said they'd tell us when the ten minutes was up and we could make comments.  I hope they will contact us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Probably on the Internet.
L:  Yeah, something like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh!  [NOISE]
R:  Oh!
L:  Well, I don't --
R:  Where -- where are you?  What area of the country are you in?
L:  Um, California, [inaudible], yeah.
R:  Oh, me too.
L:  Oh, you're in --
R:  Where in -- where in California?
L:  Um, by Las Vegas.
R:  Oh, okay.  No, I'm in Southern California, South Orange County.
L:  Oh, okay.  You're --
R:  Right where the -- where the Anaheim Angels play.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Okay.  And the Dodgers.
L:  Over there by Disneyland!
R:  Huh, right by Disneyland.  You got it!
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, okay.  Yeah, I'm over here by Vegas.
R:  Ah, that's a good place to be.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I don't know, but I guess we have to stay on the line for ten minutes, and I don't know how they handle something -- and we'll -- I guess they want us to ask questions.  So, I'll ask that when I get through, what do we do if we agree on the subject?
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And see if they'd --
L:  Yeah.  And are we supposed to write any information down?
R:  I don't know.  I don't remember.  I have to look at my sheet.
L:  Oh.
R:  I don't know if we have to send any written reports in.
L:  Huh.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE]  'Cause I'm not too sure how this works, all those details.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Well, my -- my computer went out and I don't have my Internet.  I have to go use my son's for the next week or so and then I'll be okay again.
L:  Uh.
R:  'Cause I had to get a new computer, which they're not interested -- they're interested in how we feel about 
L:  About ... yeah --
R:  Athletes striking.
L:  Oh, okay.  And then, um ...  So, [SIGH] you don't know much -- how much money they -- the highest paying person is?  Where -- do you know?  'Cause I'm just into more or less football.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I like football.
R:  Oh, see, I'm into -- I like baseball and basketball.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't think that football players get as much as they make -- make as much as the basket- -- basketball I think is the highest --
L:  Oh, yeah, huh.
R:  -- paid sport, uh-huh.  I think so.  And --
L:  Are you a Laker fan?  N- [LAUGH] --
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  Okay.
R:  I a- -- well, I h- -- actually I hadn't been for a long time, like, until they won last year, you know?  I'd watch the, uh, play offs and I watched them win and it kinda got me back into it.  We used to do Lakers a lot too.  I don't think they've ever struck.
L:  [MN]
R:  I remember mostly the Dodgers, you know, the baseball -- different baseball teams striking.
L:  Yeah.  But I don't -- I don't -- I don't -- I'm not into baseball.
R:  Yeah.  So, you don't listen to [MN].  Do you remember any footballs --
L:  Any football teams?
R:  -- teams, uh, striking?
L:  Striking, n- -- wait -- no.
R:  I don't, I- --
L:  No, actually just, like, the drafts, 'cause they're not making --
R:  Yeah, they're --
L:  -- enough, so, they see who wants to offer more.
R:  Right.
L:  That's what a lot of 'em is there.
R:  Yeah, but that -- that's legitimate.  I mean, if they can get more someplace else, or they can get dra- -- the -- that's set up, pre-set up.  That's not quite the same as striking, although I know they've -- I think they can refuse to be train- tr- uh, transferred --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to another team.  Or traded is the word I was looking for.  I think they can be traded --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to another team, but I don't think I -- I don't remember them striking.  I -- like I -- as I said, I was more into baseball.  So, I would -- I'm very aware of the baseball strikes --
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  -- more so than anything else.  And I think they've striked more.  And I think they make too much money.  And we're back to square one on this.
L:  Yep.  Has it been ten minutes?
R:  I don't know, but it's a long ten minutes, isn't it?
L:  Huh.
R:  Well, they say they'll get bac- -- they'll let us know when ten minutes are up.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I hear children in the background.
L:  In my background?
R:  Yeah, in your background.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's [NOISE] -- it was the music but --
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh, now I hear that, yeah.  Well, this is -- I hope -- I wonder if they're recording all this.  This is kind of inane, but [LIPSMACK] --
L:  M- yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- this is how we -- this is how we'll learn.
L:  Yep.
R:  How to do it.
L:  So, all we do is get calls?
R:  Uh-huh.  Just like we did now.  This is the second time I've gotten a call.  The last time I wasn't home.  And they said you can initiate a call by calling in.
L:  Oh, you could?
R:  Yeah.  That the -- well, they left a number.  I guess if they call you and you don't  you know, you're not home -- they left a message on the answer- answering machine that you could -- that you could call in, but that's about -- I don't know how they do that either.  I'm hoping somebody will ask questions when they get back on the line.
L:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK] Oh, okay, hm.  [SIGH]
R:  You're breathing!  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.  [LAUGH]
R:  I can- -- I wish I'd have watched the time.  Ten minutes is all
