L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, I'm Amber. [NOISE].
L:  Hi, Taio[?].
R:  It -- it's what?
L:  My -- Taio, my name's Taio.
R:  Oh, nice to meet you.
L:  Hi, nice to meet you too.
R:  So, professional, um, athletes on strike [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I don't know much about that actually.  I didn't know that professional -- if anyone was on strike right now.
R:  Me either.
L:  Y-
R:  Um, actually I didn't think anybody was.  I knew the women MBA players were talking about going on strike.
L:  Oh, for -- for higher salaries?
R:  I believe so.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I think they're overpaid as it is.
L:  Yeah, athletes, yeah, no, definitely.  I agree.  Um, do you know what their like -- their claims are?  Like why they would be going on a strike, like just for more money or for --
R:  Well, from what I understand it was strictly for more -- more money but --
L:  Wow, yeah.
R:  -- I don't have any idea.
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH] yeah, me neither.  Um, I remember the baseball strike earlier and I --
R:  Yeah, a couple of years ago.  That was -- that was ridiculous.
L:  That was ridiculous, yeah.  Yeah, they get paid way too much. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I would like their salary.
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  If I could -- [COUGH] the only thing is that they're gonna raise prices for basketball games or baseball games or to -- you know, for us to go to and I'm like, they're already expensive as it is just to get a ticket to watch their games.
R:  Right. 
L:  You know --
R:  To watch 'em run up and down the court.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly, which is -- yeah, which is a shame 'cause if it was more, um, it was more -- if it was less expensive I would go to more games and stuff.  I don't go to professional games very much because of that.
R:  I don't either, strictly because I refuse to pay the price.
L:  Yes, exactly.  Exactly, that's right, um --
R:  But strikes, I think, are a bit ridiculous.
L:  Strikes in general or just in professional --
R:  N- -- well, in professional --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- sports.  Not in general because a lot of people that go on strike have very valid reasons.
L:  Exactly, yeah.  Yeah, you know, because, you know, these -- these overpaid athletes are, you know, griping over things that, like, other workers that do go on strike, you know, they can't even -- they're not even try- --
R:  They can't pay their bills.
L:  Yeah, exactly, for like real things, you know, like paying bills and stuff so, yeah --
R:  I totally agree, you make a million dollars and wanna go on strike so you can make two million.
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  And Joe Blow that's on strike is lucky if they bring home fifteen thousand dollars a year.
L:  Exactly, yeah.  Yeah, so I get really annoyed when I hear about stuff like that.
R:  Me too.  Very -- very annoyed at -- you know, most people in the US live below the poverty line.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah --
R:  And you just -- you just raise the bar --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and now you want more.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Not only do you get salary for being an athlete but you also get a salary for endorsements --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- public speaking engagements and, you know --
L:  True.
R:  -- you might have a contract for three and a half million but you make five million a year because you're in a Nike commercial.
L:  True, yeah, I didn't even think about that.  That's very true, yeah.
R:  So, you make eight and a half million --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you -- you pay in more in taxes than ten people together make in a year's time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you don't have a valid reason.  You certainly want more money.
L:  Yeah.  That's so true.  And a lot of people bring up like how -- like, you know, back in the day, uh, people, you know athlete's pay- -- you know, just didn't get paid anything were hardly even making enough money to support their families but they just did it for the love of the game, you know, it was --
R:  And that to me makes sense.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I just wish athletes today, you know, had that.
R:  Well, it's -- it's such a -- they -- they set such a really sad, bad example for like [NOISE] high school kids, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're like, "Oh, I wanna play football or basketball so that I can be the next Jordan or --"
L:  Yes.
R:  "-- you know, whoever else so that I can make that eight and a half million dollars a year".
L:  Yes.  No, and that's a problem too because then a lot of them don't, uh, focus on like their studies or whatnot and so they, you know, shoot to go to the MBA or to the MFL or whatever and, you know, only like one half of one percent of people who try out actually would make it.  So, you know, and then they neglect -- like they don't have like a back up, you know, because they spend so much time on sport and stuff, which I think -- I think is a problem sometimes, you know.
R:  It's -- it's a very big problem, they forget the whole purpose of going to school.
L:  Mhm, yeah, exactly.
R:  And, I mean, if you live for money you're going to be really, really sad one day. [NOISE].
L:  Mhm.
R:  Money doesn't buy happiness.
L:  Yes.
R:  No matter how much you have.  Obviously you still want more.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, definitely.
R:  But the strikes I don't understand.  If they had valid reasons like, you know, a lot of people strike because they just don't make any money or because they're benefits got cut or because there's, you know, prejudices and segregations and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Those are valid reasons.  Athletes --
L:  I agree.
R:  I don't remember an athlete's strike yet that wasn't for contract disputes and money.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I remember an umpire's strike and I guess that affected 'em but I figure that um- 
L:  Oh, the umpires?  I didn't know they striked before.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.
R:  Went on strike once, once that I can remember. 
L:  [MN]
R:  And -- and I'm sure, you know, that affected the game but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they were easily replaced by someone who would cross the picket line and, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when the athlete's go on strike it's done and over, there's no one that can replace them.
L:  That's true.
R:  And it's strictly for entertainment purposes so I -- I don't -- I -- I guess I just don't get it.
L:  Yeah, I don't get it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, at all.  Uh --
R:  There's no way I could -- I could see myself raising that kind of a stink.
L:  Exactly.  Yeah, and I don't kn- -- 'cause I'm sure a lot of these people come from a humble -- humble beginnings already so they should know, like, they don't need all that money.  I don- I don't know, you know --
R:  Well, money doesn't let you forget your struggles.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and I'm sure we're all happy when we progress to the next level but -- but there's gotta be -- there's gotta be an end to the madness at some point.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I agree.
R:  It reinforces the greed in our society.
L:  Yes, oh, totally.  Yeah, it just makes no sense.  Like, I mean --
R:  Exorbitant --
L:  Oh, go ahead.
R:  Pardon.  I said, exorbitant salaries and ridiculous strikes and we pay -- how much is a -- how much is a ticket to a professional game, like seventy five dollars maybe?
L:  Exactly, yeah.  Something like hat.
R:  You know, we -- we work really hard to make seventy five dollars to be able to -- to afford to watch you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then you wanna take that bit of entertainment from us.
L:  Mhm.
R:  For -- well, I'm in Memphis, Tennessee and we just got our -- our first professional team.
L:  Oh, okay.  What -- what's that?
R:  The -- the Grizzlies.
L:  Oh okay, okay.
R:  Yeah.  But they're not very good.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They're really not but you gonna have a lot of support here and it's like, you know, in that respect, yeah, we're here to support you but, at the same time, you guys need to give something back to the community and stop so much worrying about yourself.
L:  Yeah, that's what I think is a big problem, like, yeah, a lot of these athletes -- I mean, yeah, they -- I think there should be an important part, maybe like in their contract or something that they should give back to the community so it's all like so -- but they can understand our money is a [inaudible] like and you shouldn't try to get like all that money, you know, for yourself, like you should -- like, if they have more a connection with society I think that they -- they wouldn't be so, you know, greedy and money grabbing, like, you know, so that they can, like, know it's important to give back and, uh, know that everyone -- like some people are struggling for a dollar and you're asking for another million dollars, you know, so --
R:  It -- yeah, exactly.
L:  Yeah, I think that's important.
R:  And you know you don't have to give your money back, give your time.
L:  Yeah, exactly, yeah give ya time.
R:  Your time matters a lot more to people who don't have money than your money does.
L:  Mhm, mhm.  Yeah, especially 'cause if your money doesn't go to do anything then, yeah, it's not -- not useful, yeah.
R:  Uh-uh, I think definitely that -- that should be written into the contract and, you know, then they can strike because maybe they don't want to do it [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause they have to give up their time but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not for more money!
L:  Yes.
R:  I don't get it.
L:  Mm, yeah, me neither.  Yeah.
R:  Who'd have thought running up and down, sweating --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- huffing and puffing could make that kind of money and the people who actually are the backbone of American society --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- often get overlooked.
L:  -- it doesn't -- yeah, it doesn't make -- it doesn't make any sense, no.  I know, like, 'cause I think of -- whe- when I think of, um, you know, people who are like unpaid and, like, underprivileged I figure like teachers and stuff who are probably like the most -- is ap- -- like probably one of the most important professions, you know, today --
R:  As they're shaping our future.
L:  Yeah, exactly, exactly.  But, you know, they are so underpaid and -- and, you know, the professional athletes get all this mon- [MN] I don't -- yeah, I don't get it.  It's just so unequal and it doesn't make any sense.
R:  No, it's -- it's -- there's not -- there's not any kind of -- of equation that I can think of --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that -- that equals out what they get, what they demand and how little they have to get.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I just --
L:  Exactly, I don't -- I don't know.
R:  -- don't understand.
L:  Yeah, I don't know how it ended up like that.
R:  Obviously we let it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The multi million- I guess, billion dollar industry and --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  -- and our money -- our money -- our money, tax money, whatever supports it and we build you these fine multi million dollar facilities to play in and they jack up our city taxes and, yeah, we can't afford to pay it anyway and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you get more money [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and pay less.  Because, you know, most of them don't even live in the city that their -- their team is.
L:  Yeah, no, I know it.  Yeah, that's true.
R:  So, we're getting nothing from it.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You're here a couple of months of the year.
L:  Mm.
R:  You sweat, you laugh, you play hard and then you go home.
L:  Exactly.
