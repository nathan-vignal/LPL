R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Renee.
L:  My name is Augusta.
R:  Augusta?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Okay.  I'm in -- I'm in Los Angeles.
L:  I'm in Maryland [NOISE].
R:  Maryland?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  And as far as what athletes get paid or all that stuff I -- it doesn't matter to me [LAUGH] I'm not a sports buff.
R:  [LAUGH] No, I think they're paid too much but, uh, it doesn't matter to me either 'cause I don't go -- I -- I'm not paying the ticket price so ...
L:  No.  I'm -- I'm --
R:  I wish they'd behave better though for my kids' sake.
L:  See, I really -- I don't -- I don't really follow any of it.
R:  Oh.
L:  At -- at all.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean no baseball, no nothing so I don't care what they get paid really [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  'Cause I'm not the one paying their salary, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  If I was the one paying -- paying for the ticket it'd be one thing but ...
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's just that they're so visible and then they -- and they do -- you know they get, uh --
L:  In trouble and do dumb things. [LAUGH]
R:  -- put in jail for things and stuff, you know, it's bad for the kids.  I don't want my daughter growing up thinking that it's okay to act that way.
L:  Nah, I don't think she would.
R:  Yeah.  So, [LAUGH] I guess we really don't care what they make.
L:  Nah.  Guess we're not good for this topic, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  No [LAUGH].  No, but whatever, whatever works.  So, you're in Maryland?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's, uh, that's way up north, huh?
L:  Um, we're like right in the middle.
R:  Oh, oh really. [NOISE]
L:  Bas- Basin Dixon Line.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Right in the middle.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, how old are your kids?
R:  Uh, I've got a three and a half year old daughter.
L:  Oh, yours is little.
R:  Yes.
L:  My oldest is seventeen, she's gonna be eighteen next month.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.  Well, you sound like a kid yourself.
L:  Nah, not really. [LAUGH]
R:  No, evidently not. [LAUGH]
L:  No, uh-uh.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  No, she's not in sports neither.
R:  No.
L:  No, she never was in school, none of that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So ...
R:  Though it really would be nice to get paid what they're paying just for -- just for playing.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  If I could get paid like that just to play that'd be nice.
L:  I don't know, there some guys get pretty hurt up, you know what I mean?
R:  That's true too.
L:  And when they get tore up, they get tore up and then they're out for good and then they have to find something else to do.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, except they love it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  They like getting beat up. [NOISE]
L:  Rather them than me. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  So, you doing anything for Easter?
L:  No, just having a dinner.
R:  Having dinner.
L:  Staying home, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Too much to go travel, had to go to the Mall today and it was like, "Oh my god, I can't believe I'm here, this place is crazy".
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was packed everybody -- everybody buying their last minute bunnies, I guess.
R:  Oh. [NOISE] That doesn't sound like fun.
L:  No.
R:  [NOISE] We -- we took a short drive about, I don't know, a hundred and fifty miles to some relatives and spending the weekend. [NOISE] That's it.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, at least yours is little, they can appreciate Easter.  Mine are grown up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they just want. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, what are you going to give me?
L:  Yeah.  They don't -- they don't understand the value of it. [LAUGH]
R:  No.
L:  You can't hide Easter eggs and have 'em go hunting for 'em. [LAUGH]
R:  No [LAUGH].  No, they can't entertain you like that anymore.
L:  That -- that's -- that -- no, that's the one thing I miss is when they were little and you could take 'em on Easter hunts.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That always was fun.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, guess I better enjoy that while I've got it.
L:  [LAUGH] Nah, don't worry you've got lots of time yet.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  Then they'll grow up and be telling you what to do [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know, I know, I know everything.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  So, how did you find out about this Fisher project thing? [NOISE]
L:  Um, well I went to one of the coupon boards and I just saw it on there and I thought, "Oh, that sounds interesting".  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, the one I did the other day was about should schools censor stuff. 
R:  Oh, that sound --
L:  And that -- that one was fun.  That one I enjoyed.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I was talking with an elementary school teacher.
R:  Oh my.
L:  So, that -- that was fun.  That one --
R:  Yeah, that sounds interesting.
L:  -- was very interesting.
R:  [NOISE].
L:  When they said sports I'm like, "Uh-oh, I don't know anything about sports" [LAUGH]
R:  Oh god. [LAUGH]
L:  It's like ask me something about scrabble or something like that, I can tell you about that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
L:  Pick something I know.  Ask about sewing. [LAUGH]
R:  Shopping or food or something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's, uh, a little more relevant to our lives or [NOISE] -- okay, Booboo. [NOISE] She says she's going to blow up.
L:  Very good.  See, you have a sports player there [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Well, she's showing me how her diaper's got a blow out.
L:  Oh, isn't that always fun?
R:  [LAUGH] Okay, thanks. [LAUGH]
L:  Then -- then they get them pull up things and then they figure that all out and then they can't keep 'em on.  First you can't get 'em in 'em and then you can't get them out of them.
R:  Oh.
L:  And then they wanna do it all themselves.
R:  Oh, great.
L:  That always was fun.
R:  Oh, loads of fun.
L:  Mhm.  Going to have anymore.
R:  N- well, I'd like to but it's not in the cards.
L:  Nah?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, go ahead, what's one more?  Now, it's easy. [LAUGH]
R:  It's not physically possible anymore.
L:  No?
R:  You know. [NOISE] I wish I could but it ain't gonna happen. [LAUGH]
L:  Nah, mine are all big, now I just collect dogs. [LAUGH]
R:  Dogs? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I've got four of 'em.
R:  Oh my goodness, what kind?  Mutts or ...?
L:  Three Boston terriers and a mutt.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yep, yep, yep.
R:  Well, I don't know what else to say. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I guess we have to sit for ten minutes trying to think of something, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Have you gotten paid for any of these yet or anything?
R:  No, this is my second one and I haven't been paid for -- uh, I haven't received a cheque for the first one.
L:  This is my third one and I did --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the other two --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I did two in one night.
R:  Oh, you did? [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh and that was the day before yesterday.
R:  Oh, wow.  Well, the first one I did was like a month ago.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  But I -- I know they had some kind of a glitch in their system or something, yeah, so now, uh, they're starting a -- I don't know, they figured it out or something so they're starting to run 'em again.  So, I kinda knew this was happening.  All my friends who are doing this said that they just got two more calls -- they had one and then there wasn't anything for a while --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- now all of a sudden everybody's getting their second and third.
L:  Ah!  How many times do they call you, I wonder.
R:  Just three.
L:  Just three and then that's --
R:  I think they max out at three, yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Wow, so you do your three and then you're done.
R:  Then you're done unless you give 'em a new phone number --
L:  Nah, I --
R:  -- to call you on.
L:  -- have no other phone number. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  One's enough.
R:  Yeah.  Well, ten bucks for ten minutes work is not bad.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Ten minutes out of my life.  Is it ten minutes yet? [LAUGH]
L:  No, I wish they would have picked something else that I knew something about though.
R:  I know, me too. [NOISE] Like something about TV or --
L:  Yeah, some --
R:  -- kids or food or --
L:  Yeah, that I know a lot about. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, me too.  Yeah.  It's like these holidays are dangerous when it comes to food.
L:  Oh yeah, this is the best time though then you can get up the next morning and instead of making breakfast you warm up a plate of leftovers [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  That's me, I'm the pig [LAUGH].  Oh, food!
R:  [LAUGH] Oh gosh, you know when I'm on the phone talking to my family across country, um, ten minutes seems to go by in a flash.
L:  Oh, yeah that's because everybody's got something to talk about. [LAUGH] And there's always something new --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- going on in the family.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I guess I should have timed this.
L:  Now, you think of stuff, huh?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  They did this on purpose.  They picked something that we didn't know anything about so they could test us.
R:  They could see what it takes for us to pull the conversation.
L:  Oh, look, they can't do it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  I'm in a hotel room right now.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, are you on your cellphone?
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] Yeah, what about you? 
L:  I'm at home.
R:  On a regular phone?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Landline?
L:  No, just regular.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, we're just changing clothes getting ready to go to dinner.
L:  Well, have a good dinner and a nice Easter.
R:  [MN] Yeah, thanks, you too.  You too.  Last time -- uh, do you give comments afterwards?
L:  I did the first time because the first time whoever the girl was I was talking to her boyfriend was in the background, she was a college student, and her boyfriend was in the background yelling at her, they were getting ready to go out and he hung up the phone on her --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- and I'm sitting there --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- and I'm like -- I'm like I'm still here and I'm on the phone and I'm trying to do my ten minutes but he hung up on her [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Am I going to get paid for this?
