L:  Hi, my name is Michelle.
R:  Hi, this is Lynn.
L:  Hi, Lynn.  Um, topic is airport security, do we think it lessens the chance of terrorism?  Um, well --
R:  Yeah, and -- and just recently in the last few days I've learned that, um, pilots have now been trained and might be carrying firearms themselves.
L:  Yes, that is actually o- officially the case.  Um, I have to say, personally I feel very happy about that.  It makes me feel a lot safer.  I happen to have actually recently traveled and a- yes, I do definitely agree that it does lessen the chances of a terror- -- any sort of terrorism act, um --
R:  I -- I think so too.  I think they've put into effect a lot of new measures.  The air marshals --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for one.
L:  Mhm.  Yes, um --
R:  That's kind of given me a sense of security.
L:  Right.  It -- it does give you a se- -- give me a sense of security also, um, but also to a certain extent it does make me a little bit leery, just to know that, you know, the extent that we now have to go to because of what has happened --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, it sort of puts things in perspective for you.
R:  Well, it's sad.  I mean, it's ...
L:  Yes, yes, um, I agree it is sad, um, but it is obviously measures that need to be taken and, you know, again it's -- I definitely feel a lot safer when I went through the, um, the airport.  You know, they did everything from checking that the buckles of my shoes --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- to, um, like checking the interior of my luggage to detect any sort of, um, like bomb residual --
R:  But, you know, in my experience it's not added a tremendous amount to departure.  I've always gotten through, the Atlanta airport even, fairly quickly.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  And I thought, "Gee, you know, they're doing all this extra stuff, but apparently someone's trained them correctly or they're -- they're doing it right or allowing a little extra time", um, I haven't experienced any significant slow down --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I do feel much, much, more secure.
L:  Well, as far as like the -- the delays it has gotten better, um, I remember one time where I was waiting in line for about forty five minutes -- close to an hour -- just waiting to get me, um, um, through the security terminal thing and I mean last time I flew it was -- the pro- -- the whole process took like anywhere from fifteen to twenty minutes.
R:  Right.
L:  Very quick and -- so, I'm sure, you know, at the beginning it's always that way where they first have to, um, address all the, um, the bottle neck issues and then --
R:  In training and getting everybody accustomed to the new processing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- things like that.
L:  Right, right.  And -- and again, it's -- it's a sad state of affairs that we find ourselves in right now but it's -- measures need to be taken.  I feel definitely a lot safer flying, um, although some of the things I just don't -- don't agree with like stuff that they do because it -- it just doesn't make any sense to me but things to -- need to be taken, you know, um.
R:  Well, I -- I think at some level we have to believe that they know what they're doing and that this situation has been studied and studied and researched and that the measures that are in effect are -- are what need to be there, even if we don't understand every single thing they do.
L:  Mhm, that's -- yeah, I -- I see what you're saying there, um, um ... This is a bit hard only because we both agree so -- [LAUGH]
R:  That's true [LAUGH].
L:  Um, when there's a disagreement at least you can, sort of, you know, go back and forth --
R:  Debate back and forth a little bit.
L:  Right, um, but yeah, I --
R:  Yeah, well, the obvious things are what make me feel more secure and the firearms and -- and training and things like that.  I'm glad it's not just some sort of willy nilly thing.
L:  Mhm, mhm, um, what is -- what is your, um, sort of like, I guess, perspective on like, um -- have you ever encountered any sort of like profiling -- not you personally but perhaps somebody that you know or something like that?  Like those are some things that I know friends of mine have encountered, um, you know, if they're of a certain ethnic background they tend to be a little bit more, I guess, [NOISE] what -- what's the word?  Scrutinous, of that individual, you know, when they go through that whole security process, um --
R:  I --
L:  -- and that sort of bothers me a little bit, but I understand it --
R:  I do too.
L:  -- but it still bothers me.
R:  And -- and it is th- sort of this mixed emotion --
L:  Mhm.  Yes, um, and --
R:  In, uh, [LAUGH] it -- it -- that's a tough one.  That's a real tough one because there is, you know, clear evidence of -- of a particular age group, um, sex, and ethnic background that has committed a lot of terrorist acts.
L:  Mhm.  Yes.
R:  Yet anyone [LAUGH] that's in that same ethnic, uh, age group, uh, you know, male sex could be condemned and could be abused and be totally innocent.
L:  Mhm.  And that's what scares me a little bit because, you know, in -- in their -- in the process of them -- of security doing their job, sometimes it can be taken to the extreme and that scares me a little bit to know that that could possibly happen to someone that I know or that I care about.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but, again, I -- I understand it but it's just -- it is, uh, mixed emotions because it bothers me but I understand it and -- 'cause really you can't argue with someone that says, "Well, you know, things like that are gonna happen" and -- because of what has happened in the past blah, blah, blah, blah, but it just doesn't make it right, in my view, you know.
R:  I know.  Well, what's scary is that type of -- of, um, thing goes on outside of any kind of security situation.  You know, children have been targeted, um, people from India and Greece and other places have been targeted just because they have a -- a -- a dark complexion and dark hair.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And maybe a little accent or something.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And ...
L:  Right, right, I mean, and just things like that, you know.
R:  And it -- it -- it does bother me too but it doesn't change the fact that -- that, you know, of who committed the crimes that are the top suspects, uh, of future crimes.
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  And you -- and you just hate to think that.
L:  Again, I understand it.  I -- I definitely do, but it just bothers me that we have to go through that, or the people have to go through that --
R:  Well, I mean, it smacks of --
L:  Anybody that is certifiably innocent, you know, and be put in that position.
R:  Yeah, I -- well, and -- and it smacks of all the discrimination and, you know, targeting African Americans and a- that have -- has gone on through the ages.  You know, targeting certain groups of people because of the way they look.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's like the one bad apple spoils the whole bunch.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Everyone gets -- everyone of that type gets, uh, poor treatment because of a few.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And I have not seen that myself, um, I know it has to happen.
L:  Mhm, yeah, e- exactly.  Like, last time, um, -- again 'cause I -- I just recently traveled, there was one particular individual, individual happened to be on line with us and, um, I -- I could tell that people were a little bit leery about, you know, having this person get on the same plane.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, because of the way he looked and so forth and so on, um, you know, he was of a certain ethnicity and people were just a little bit hesitant, uncomfortable and you could feel it and that sort of bothered me a little.  I mean --
R:  I wonder how --
L:  -- I -- I can't say that I wasn't.  I -- I was a little bit, um, but it just bothered me that I myself was feeling this way when I really shouldn't.  You know, I mean, if this person's gotten to the point where he's about to board the plane then he should have passed through all the security process that everybody else goes through, so --
R:  And he and the others like him would have to know that they stand out in a crowd at this point --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- especially at an airport.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I just wonder how they feel about that.  I -- I wonder if they try to avoid airport -- airline travel.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, um --
R:  Just because even -- and even if they go through all the right steps --
L:  Yeah, I -- I mean I'm sure it's not a very overall, well, good situation for them to, you know, be the, um, target of -- of these types of -- of acts, um --
R:  Or just walking around feeling like a suspect.
L:  Right.
