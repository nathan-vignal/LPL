L:  Hi, this is Jenny.
R:  Hi, this James.
L:  Hi.
R:  Uh, I'm a twenty eight year old from New York.  Um, who are you?
L:  Um, I'm a twenty four year old mother of two from Oklahoma.
R:  Oh, great!  Well, nice to, uh, speak to you.  And it's an interesting topic I -- I guess.  Uh --
L:  [LAUGH] It is.
R:  I might ...
L:  In fact, I went on vacation last summer and -- and gotta see the -- the airport security at work.  So ...
R:  You got, uh -- you got to see it?
L:  Yeah.  I got to experience it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  And, yeah, did they make you take, uh, your shoes off?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  They made us do everything.  They even had me take my child's shoes off.
R:  Oh, goodness!  Wow!
L:  It was i- interesting.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, the thing that strikes me is in the, um -- I've also taken a -- a couple of trips since September eleventh and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- since the new security methods were in effect, and one thing that strikes me is, um, you know, there's this somewhat understandable effort to, uh, avoid, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, profiling people.
L:  Right.
R:  And so they -- they make a lot of people take their shoes off even, you know like, twenty four year old mothers [LAUGH] from Oklahoma.
L:  I know.  [LAUGH]  I know.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Well, the thing that struck me was when they would ask you if you'd left your bag unattended or let somebody else hold it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  If you were doing dishonest, would you really say, "Sure, I -- I handed it to --"
R:  Oh, yeah.  You know, "There was this, uh -- there was this strange man.  I don't know who he was but, uh, I asked him to hold my bag, yeah".
L:  "He just asked me to put this box in my bag for me, I didn't think it would be a problem".  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well -- and I think that goes to the -- the -- one of the frustrations with it.  It just seems simplistic.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Doing X., Y., and Z.  And so obviously, uh, terrorists will use new methods or new approaches.
L:  They'll be able to -- to play around it because it's the same way every time.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.  But ...
R:  So, I mean, I guess where I come out, uh, in answering the question is, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think the, uh -- the security may prevent certain types of attacks, but I don't think it really makes us totally safe.
L:  No.  And I -- I don't think that there's really a way to get us security in there that will make us totally safe. But if we eliminated some of the more unessential parts of it and -- and heightened the ones that would actually help like, you know, better X. ray equipment, etc.
R:  Um-hum.  Right.  Exactly.  Things that actually would detect dangerous -- dangerous things.
L:  Right.
R:  Dangerous like weapons or -- or, um, materials[?].
L:  Yeah.  I -- I think, you know, the funding's being sent kinda -- spent kinda foolishly right now.
R:  I agree.  And, uh, so much money is being spent on security with -- I guess you'd have to say some -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- hopefully some results.  But, um, if you actually look at how much money is being spent ...
L:  But they're not getting their money's worth.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know that ...  Yeah, it's just that I'm not so sure we are getting our money's worth.
L:  No.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  But ... I -- I also don't think, you know, that they're going to use the same method that they did last time, where they necessarily hijack planes and -- and ram them into buildings or ...
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  I mean, that's been done.  [MN]
L:  I mean, that was just -- they're gonna think of something that we haven't necessarily thought of yet or don't think is -- is susceptible to it.
R:  And, uh, yeah, I mean, one of the -- the scary thing I think about, um [LIPSMACK] -- at least what we know about, um, hardcore terrorist groups like -- okay, th- is that they're very patient and they take their time, you know, there were, like, how many -- eight years between 'em, uh, subsequent attacks on the World Trade Center.
L:  Right.
R:  So I mean, it's not as though it's gonna happen this year, but there may be another attack and, like you said, it probably won't involve airplanes.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  And it -- and it --
R:  Um ...
L:  -- and -- and rather -- I mean, I -- I think trying to thwart the attacks is a good idea, but we really need to have some things in place for when something happens rather than trying to just prevent it.
R:  Mhm.  I think that's true too, yeah.
L:  'Cause sadly, I mean, I -- I hate to -- to be a pessimistic, but it's kinda inevitable.  So ...
R:  I -- I agree.  I agree.  I mean, there always be some [LIPSMACK] crazy people who wanna hurt other -- other people.
L:  Right.
R:  That's -- that's out of our hands.  Uh, did you see on the news recently, uh, they are -- are training, um, uh -- training pilots, uh, to, uh, use, uh -- so that they know how to use, uh, guns and they're gonna let them have them in the cock- --
L:  They're gonna let them have them in the cockpit.  Yeah.  The only problem is a lot of the -- the terrorists that, you know, were parts of this attack were trained to be pilots.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, if -- you know, if Joe Blow goes out and gets a job with American Airlines, planning this out ahead of time --
R:  Right.  Now, all of a sudden he's gonna be able to have a ...  [LAUGH]
L:  We're gonna have them and they're armed with the gun we've given 'em.  [LAUGH]
R:  Real.  Yeah.  And you're right and so there's always a -- there's two edges to any -- any of these, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- two sides of any of these measures.
L:  I think it would be smarter to try to train them on some sort of hand to hand, or something where they don't have, you know, an actual weapon with them on the plane.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So they're just more prepared?
L:  Right.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  That's a good -- interesting idea.  Or else if the -- the sky marshal brought them, which, uh, means that instead of it being a pilot with a gun it's a specially trained and -- and, uh, extremely --
L:  Undercover.
R:  -- careful, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- undercover and very, very carefully prescreened also.
L:  Right.
R:  Um [LIPSMACK], it's just really complicated.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's, you know -- I'm -- I'm glad I don't have the job of -- of figuring it all out.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  I can criticize it all I want and I'm -- and I'm just glad I'm not in their spot trying to -- to get it into place.
R:  Yeah, I agree.
L:  But ...
R:  Uh, so you said you traveled -- you traveled, uh, one time with your family?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, since the new things have been in place?
L:  Yeah.  We came from -- from Nebraska down here to Oklahoma when we were still living up there, to visit some relatives.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  And, uh, we got laid over and we were there at [NOISE] like, four thirty in the morning to catch the next flight and we [LAUGH] -- we were in -- in bad shape.  
R:  Oh, goodness.  And they were taking the +kids' shoes off?
L:  Yeah.  They had us take us her shoes off and checked her clothes and everything.
R:  Oh!
L:  It was just -- it was unreal 'cause she was only like, a year and a half, a year and a half I think.  So ...
R:  Wow!
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I think we looked pitiful though.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I mean, every time I tr- go traveling, uh, with my girlfriend she gets -- they make her take [LAUGH] her shoes off.
L:  I know!  [LAUGH]  Man ...
R:  And she's, like, you know, the most harmless looking young lady you would ever see.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I mean, they had people, like, taking foot slops and -- and sandals and obvious, you know, pieces of -- of clothing and stuff off, which just cracked me up.  But I think they have a certain amount of people that they have to pull out of line no matter what.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right.  In fact, they -- they have to follow some certain ratios.  I think they even do it, uh, I'm not sure, but I think they even some sort of a, uh, random way of determining, you know, like --
L:  Yes.  Yeah.
R:  -- one [LIPSMACK] -- one out -- out of two or something get searched.
L:  Well, I -- I also know that, um, if for some reason your flight hasn't been able to go and you have to get a different flight, I think they said everybody that -- that's on that -- that new flight, the rescheduled flight, has to be checked.  
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I mean, we were there overnight, you know, two hours sleep [NOISE] and they were checking everybody, and you should've heard all the -- the people [LAUGH] that were mad.
R:  Oh, I bet, yeah.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  But, I mean, I [NOISE] -- 
R:  A lot of them would've been frustrated.  You understand why they're doing it.
L:  It's frustrating even though --
R:  I mean, there's no intention --
L:  -- you understand that the intention's there [NOISE] to keep -- you know,  to keep us safe.  [NOISE]  But ...
R:  So, you're from -- you're originally from Nebraska, but you're not living in Oklahoma?
L:  Well, I -- I was originally in Kansas and, uh --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- my husband went to school in Nebraska for a while.  [NOISE]
R:  Okay.  Oh, okay.
L:  So, now we're down here by his family.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  So, wh- what do you do?  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I'm a entrepreneur right now.  Uh, I'm attempting to keep alive a very small business that I started about a year ago --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- which helps, uh, doctors to comply with, uh, the new, uh, health, uh, privacy regulations that just went into effect.
L:  Oh, I -- yeah.  [NOISE]  This --
R:  You maybe -- you hear about that on the news or ...?
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- right now I'm getting all my medical records together and such and I've running in different stuff with it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I -- I bet.  It makes it a little -- I mean, it's intended to [MN] protect --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- your medical records from falling into the wrong hands.
L:  Right.
R:  But it also imposes more red tape and more complexity on the process [LAUGH] of actually getting medical records --
L:  Right.
R:  -- from one place to another.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  But it -- you know, it's good also because, you know, there is a lot of identity theft and I think that's one of the methods that people have been using lately.
R:  Yes.  That's true.  And, um --
L:  Is getting ...
R:  -- there's been a lot of identity theft and also just theft of medical data to -- to use against individuals.
L:  Right.
R:  So, for example, if you had a medical condition ...
L:  We're having that with my husband's work right now.  I ...
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] How did you get it?
L:  He's got -- he's got a medical condition he needs a surgery for and the insurance doesn't cover it until September.
R:  Oh, my!
L:  So, they're -- they're telling him if he misses any more work before the -- the procedures he has to have, until he has this surgery, that they're gonna fire him.
R:  Oh, God!
L:  So, we're going through all the equal opportunity crap and oh, it's a mess.
R:  Glad to hear it.  Yeah, you should definitely pursue your rights on that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because I don't think it's legal for them to --
L:  It's not.
R:  -- do that.
L:  But they prey on your ignorance.  They -- 
R:  Ex- --
L:  -- they plan on you not knowing.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  So, yeah, this is an interesting program they have running.
R:  Yeah, it really is.  Um, this is my third call.  How 'bout you?
L:  This is my first.  I -- I was intrigued by it.
R:  Yep.  How did you find out about it?
L:  I
