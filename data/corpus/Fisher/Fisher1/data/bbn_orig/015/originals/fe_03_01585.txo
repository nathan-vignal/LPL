L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  [MN] Hello.
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  This is Mary.
L:  Hi.  I'm Jason.  How ya doing?
R:  Oh, I'm doing fine.  And you?
L:  Oh, all right.  So, uh, what's your feeling on airport security?  I think I've already talked about this with someone before.  But ...  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Uh, well, yes, I do think that the, um, things they have in place now it's going to reduce the risk, but I do believe that there's still the chance that things could happen that they don't foresee.  Uh, I know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- a couple of years ago my son took an airplane trip and I know airport security was very lax then.  I know we were in and out of the airport with no security hardly at all.  I mean, they didn't --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- even hardly check you.  And I know it's a lot different now.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Huh.  Um, hey, where ya from, Sherry?
R:  Mississippi.
L:  Oh, wow!  So, how [MN] -- how do you know of like -- I mean, are you -- do you live in Philadelphia though or ...?
R:  Uh, no, I'm in Mississippi still.  [MN]
L:  Oh, wow!  So, how do you know about the study 'cause the study's out of Philadelphia, right?
R:  Uh, [SIGH] it was -- it was through the Internet.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  Um ...
R:  And so you live in Pennsylvania then?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Th- -- a matter of fact that's where my son took the trip to.  [LAUGH]  It was, um, a little place near --
L:  Oh, [MN].
R:  -- um [LIPSMACK], near Harrisburg I think.
L:  Okay.
R:  I can't remember the name of the town but, uh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- he took a trip there.  Do you fly much?
L:  I, uh -- do I fly?  I -- I mean, yeah, I guess -- I guess I do, a -- a pretty good amount.  Um, but, uh, I don't know.  How do ya -- what's your -- I think the real issue is, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is -- is racial profiling, and how do you feel about that considering that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, statistically, uh, so many of the terrorists are Arabic?  You know, how do you -- how do you feel about, you know [several inaudible words]?
R:  Um, I -- I believe that it should be racially profiled because, um, most of the terrorist attacks are, uh, perpetrated by Middle Easterners.  So, I think you do have to concentrate on them.  Uh, even though I realize someone else could do it, they seem to be the ones that are targeting us, and so I feel like it's okay to do that and I think they should -- if they have nothing to hide they should understand.
L:  Right.  I actually agree with you on that one.  [LIPSMACK]  I do.  Uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah.  I don't know.  You ever watch, um -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there's a show Hard Ball with Chris Matthews on MSNBC --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and, uh, one of -- one of my favorite quotes from that show is -- he says, uh -- he said, "I'm not saying that all terror- uh, all Arabs are terrorists, but I am saying that all terrorists are Arab".
R:  [LAUGH] They guess!
L:  [several inaudible words], you know what I'm saying?  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.
L:  Yeah, exact- --
R:  Uh, I mean, you know, you look at the World Trade Center and -- and using the airplanes in the way that they did.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, you've -- you've got to turn around and you've gotta look at that and -- and see what's been h- -- what's happened in the past and, you know, you've got to go from there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah, and, uh, I, totally --
R:  -- and check them a little more securely.
L:  There's this crazy fact that something like, uh -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- something like ninety percent of all terrorists are named Mohammed, or of all perpetrators of terrorism have Mohammed somewhere in their names.  That's pretty weird, huh?
R:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  That's true.
L:  Yeah.  Um [LIPSMACK], but anyway ...  So, what else?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, tell me, now like, what kind of things are in place like -- since you travel a lot.  We -- we don't travel by plane.
L:  [MN]
R:  Uh, the only experience I have is with my son, you know, traveling, and I don't even travel on an airplane myself but, uh --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- what kind of security is in place for like, when you go to the airport?
L:  Well, I mean, nowadays it's like -- uh, you know, I j- -- I just flew a few weeks ago and it's more, [MN] you know, uh, it's -- it's stuff that you don't see really like appar- supposedly they -- they s- do search more people, although I haven't been searched.  I've flown, you know, maybe four or five times since September eleventh.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  And, uh, you s- there's more of a presence like, you -- you do see more security, but th- most of the time they're standing around kind of.  [SIGH]  And --
R:  Oh.  So, really this might not be working [LAUGH] do you think?
L:  I don't know.  It's -- it's -- s- s- I don't know.  It's -- it's hard to say like, some people [MN] -- I mean, th- they say that a lotta -- a lot of the new increased security is -- is stuff --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that you won't notice anyway like stuff that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- goes on behin- behind the scenes like, you know, plainclothes people?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Stuff like -- stuff like that.  But, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know.  It's just really hard to say.  I'm not like --
R:  So, they're not like --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- individual -- individually --
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  like, um, checking your suitcase, like opening it and that type thing?
L:  I mean, s- i- it depends, like some airlines like, uh, you know -- I know like, El Al, which is Israel's, um, airline, which I've flown on a couple of times, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is very -- they -- I mean, they almost check every bag.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Almost every bag.  But then -- I mean, I've never had my bags searched, although I've seen people have their bags searched like, i- it's pretty much -- I think they just do it on like a -- you know, every tenth person they'll check or something like that.
R:  Oh, okay.  And anyway you probably don't fit the profile, right?
L:  Right.  You got that, you got it.
R:  Of what they're looking for?
L:  Exactly.  I'm not -- I'm not a very suspicious looking person.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I -- I suppo- -- but, I mean, then again who knows 'cause theoretically they're not profiling anyone, right?  So ...
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  But, I mean, I'm -- I'm sure that that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- does it's -- it's a [inaudible] things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Whether people admit it or not.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But [SIGH], um, I don't know.
R:  I'm sure that, uh, Israel has a lot, um, more precautions in place anyway because of all the terrorist --
L:  Right.
R:  -- attacks they have anyway.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  [MN] --
R:  Uh, they've probably got a better system than we do.  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, they've -- they've always -- they've always had, uh, v- v- very tight security.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I have flown -- I've flown to Israel, um, before September eleventh and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- I got checked.  But they checked everyone, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're -- they're not going to take any -- they don't take any chances with that type of thing, and that's really, I mean, the reason -- not to sound like an advertisement for El Al, but they -- [NOISE] they are -- by far have the best security record of any airline around.  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, just because they -- they have to take that precaution so they do and it's pretty -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's pretty impressive, and they have armed marshals on every flight.  It's pretty [SIGH] -- I mean, once you get on that flight the -- you have to feel pretty secure 'cause they are intense about safety on [inaudible].
R:  [LAUGH] So, they don't trust anybody?
L:  No.
R:  Everybody's a suspect.
L:  Exactly.  But you know what?  Maybe it's, uh -- maybe that's the way it has to be, you know?
R:  Yeah.  That might be better here.  If that's the way it was we might be --
L:  Right.
R:  -- m- safer.
L:  Yeah.  I mean -- y- yeah, it's tough to say like, it's still -- I still don't get all that concerned about airport security.  I mean, it sounds just like a stupid thing to say but -- but like, when you -- when you look at it from a broader scope it's, uh, it's still the safest m- you know, mode of travel.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The truth is that you have much more of a chance of dying just by getting in your car, if you get into an accident, than you do by getting on a plane, you know?
R:  That's true.
L:  Statistically like.  You know, so I -- I just feel like if you -- if you worry about, you know, these -- these isolated incidents that really aren't significant statistically then like -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, you might as well just not drive anywhere.  It's -- 
R:  [SIGH] [MN]
L:  -- I don't know.  You can't really worry about everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's the way I feel at least.
R:  That's probably true.  It's just that I've never really -- but any time we go anywhere it's within driving distance.  So --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I guess it's just easier for us to drive.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, well I --
L:  No, I'm not -- I'm not saying you shouldn't drive anywhere.  But you know what I'm saying?
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I realize that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  I mean, you know, I've gotten --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I've gotten into an accident driving and that was by far one of the scariest things in my life.  So, who knows?  You know, can't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- can't avoid every mode of transportations. 
R:  [LAUGH] But, you know, I guess it's the way people think about it.  If you're up in the air in an airplane and something goes wrong --
L:  Exactly, exactly.  It's just --
R:  -- your chances are probably very slim.
L:  -- or just -- it's just so much more publicized --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- when like -- 'cause, you know, when people do die it's by the hundreds --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- as opposed to like -- as opposed to a hundred different crashes --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- involving one person.  So, it's just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, it's just like the --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you're bound to hear -- you know, you're bound to just be more concerned with it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which seemed to be like, the case.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So -- but I don't know.
R:  So, you say you had already talked about airplane security before?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I feel I could give you the tape.  I've only done one -- one of these before.  Have I?  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] I have done one and it was on time travel.  [LAUGH]
L:  Time travel!
R:  Uh-huh.  [MN]
L:  [inaudible] wow!  How the hell do you talk about trime ta- -- time travel for ten minutes?
R:  [LAUGH] It was, uh, theoretical, you know?  What would you do if you could go back in time?  What kinda things would you change?  [LAUGH]
L:  Huh.  That's, uh ...
R:  But, uh ...  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Wow!
R:  [SIGH]
L:  That's somewhat of an interesting one.  I don't know.  I have to say I'm s- -- I'm still skeptical about this.  I haven't been paid for my first call, which was --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- like, two months ago.
R:  Well, now [MN], my husband --
L:  We'll see.
R:  -- he did one, [NOISE] uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on health care and he just got paid, uh, like --
L:  Oh, well -- oh, so they are paying?
R:  -- like in the last few days.  Yeah.  
L:  That's good, that they're --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- at least making an effort to [inaudible] us.  I'm pretty skeptical about this.
R:  [MN]
L:  But, you know, you figure, whatever, it's ten minutes of your life.
R:  Yeah, that's right.  And then an extra ten bucks for something, eh?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.  No harm in that.
R:  Well, like I said, I haven't gotten paid for mine, but he got paid for his.  I got an email a couple of days ago --
L:  Yeah.  I know.
R:  -- saying we were --
L:  Right.  I got that email too.
R:  -- getting paid.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, it was supposed to be by the end of this past week, wasn't it?  But I haven't seen my check either.  So ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, right.  All right.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Let's hope this works out, eh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I'd like to have me a bunch of calls, make, uh, ten dollars every day and maybe a couple of times a day.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, exactly.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, if you think about it like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there's so much potential in this and -- but I don't feel like, uh -- let's see, I got some mail, I hope one of these is a check, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible], I know.  Nope, no check, damn.  Oh, well.
R:  I just wonder of what they're doing with the information exactly.  What are they, uh --
L:  Well
