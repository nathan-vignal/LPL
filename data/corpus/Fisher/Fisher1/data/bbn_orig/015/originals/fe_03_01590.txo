L:  Hi, my name is Rebecca.
R:  Hi, my name is Valerie.  How are you, Rebecca?
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Oh, just fine.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Have you been -- have you flown since nine eleven?
L:  No, I haven't flown in many years.
R:  Oh, okay --
L:  How about you?
R:  Yeah, well I have several times and, um, you know, as, um, from nine eleven to now, th-, uh, security at the airport has -- has, uh, you know, just really been more intense.  As you go it's gotten more and more, um, restrictive and --
L:  Do you feel like it helps though, or, do you feel --
R:  Do you know what?  I -- you know, I don't feel like it's h- helps.  I believe this is -- I truly believe this.  I believe that people that -- that want to do, you know, deviant, dangerous things will -- will find a way to do them.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I -- I believe that and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, just like they were -- they were able to come over here with the airplanes and do what they did --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- they find a way.
L:  Are you located in New York also?
R:  No, I'm in, um, the Midwest.  I'm in, um, Indiana.
L:  Oh, I'm in New York City.  
R:  Oh, you are, huh?
L:  Yeah, and it's -- oh god, it was devastating during that time and, uh --
R:  Oh, I can just imagine.
L:  Yes, and even --
R:  I can imagine.
L:  -- even today they have like, uh, like at Penn Station where the hub for all the trains are -- I don't know if you've ever been to New York?
R:  Okay, uh-uh.
L:  They have like army men with like guns and -- it's like we always feel like --
R:  What?
L:  They have, uh, like in the train stations --
R:  Really?
L:  They have like ar-, you know, army men in Penn Station with like guns.
R:  You're joking?
L:  No, I'm not [LAUGH].  I wish I wasn't.  It -- it -- you know, I guess we've gotten used to it and now with the driving --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I know people I know who've flown, they have to get to the airports like four hours earlier.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  Yeah, have, um -- when was the last time you flew?  'Cause for me it's been forever, you know.
R:  Um, it was, um, let me see.  It was a couple of months ago.  I was -- went to Salt Lake -- Salt Lake City --
L:  Oh, wow. 
R:  And, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at that time they had had the -- they finally had the bomb detecting --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- stuff in the airports --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so now anything that -- any luggage that you are going to -- to, uh, check --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- not only is it -- is it -- is -- goes through this x-ray, but it's -- it's physically searched.
L:  Oh wow, so that means that you have to take out everything in your luggage?
R:  Well, that means that you -- it means that you -- you put your bag on the counter.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay, you -- you make sure it's not locked --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then you step aside and you let the security people rifle through your stuff.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  And then --
L:  Oh.
R:  And then now -- and then the other bags -- the bags -- the carry on bags that you're taking --
L:  Mhm.
R:  They -- they're xrayed, but they're not physically, um --
L:  Oh, searched.
R:  -- searched.
L:  Mhm.  And what about -- did you go through the detectors and have to take off your shoes like I've heard other people?
R:  Yeah, you take off your shoes --
L:  Oh wow.
R:  -- and if anything -- if anything buzzes, anything beeps --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- anything chimes, then -- then, you know, then there is a -- there's this hand-held, you know, sitting in a chair, hand-held search, you know, thing that they do on you.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, did they take away anything like nail clippers, or, you know, the --
R:  Well, you know, I didn't have an- -- I didn't have anything like that with me --
L:  Oh, mhm.
R:  -- that would've, you know, that would've been confiscated but I know that people have to be real careful about what they have --
L:  Oh wow.
R:  -- on -- in their purse and -- and, you know --
L:  It --
R:  -- what they bring with them and, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, y- yeah and it does take longer and -- but I -- I -- I believe that -- I believe that people that want to do things that are --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that are deviant, they will find a way.
L:  Mhm.  I know --
R:  So --
L:  -- I even saw on a, um, like a Dateline show, like shortly after nine eleven --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Was so many things were still getting through.  I'm like, this is incredible --
R:  Exactly.
L:  It's terrible, you know.
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  And I know I'm not a terrorist and, you know --
R:  N- right, [LAUGH].
L:  Nail clippers -- yeah, nail clippers would mean nothing to me, but, you know, you don't think, like, gosh how could they let these things pass through?
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, were[?] knives.  Some people had sh- -- the sharpest scissors I've ever seen.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's incredible.  
R:  Y- it -- it is.
L:  I agree with you.
R:  It's incredible.
L:  It -- yeah, you just have to -- I guess, you know, if you believe in prayer, just pray, you know --
R:  Yeah, I agree.
L:  -- for your safety.
R:  I agree.
L:  Yes, and it's not like -- even on the trains I can't take a nap any more --
R:  Oh, is that right?
L:  -- so, I can imagine on a plane I would just be, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Did you feel safe in the plane?  Did they take any precautions once you were in that were different from previously that you noticed?
R:  Oh okay, the only other thing that you can't do now is that if you have to go to the restroom --
L:  Uh-oh, mhm.
R:  -- you -- you -- you ha- -- you can't -- you can't form a line.  Like, you know, how some- --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- if y- -- you know like you go to the girls' room and there's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a line and you'll just stand in line --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- until your turn comes?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, you can't -- you can't form a line to go to the restroom.
L:  Oh, --
R:  So --
L:  -- so you just have to wait --
R:  Until the coast is clear.
L:  Oh, go back and sit down and then --
R:  Right, and don- -- no, don't even get up unless you know --
L:  Oh really, wow.
R:  -- you can -- unless you know you can go to the restroom.
L:  Wow, do they, um, l- stop [inaudible].
R:  And they tell you.  Yeah, they tell you, "Do not -- do not form a line in the restroom" --
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, "Outside the restroom door, please, you know, remain seated, you know, and only go to the, you know, to the, uh, facilities, if -- if they are free".
L:  Oh wow.
R:  Mhm.  So, if you see somebody --
L:  But, i- --
R:  -- else getting up and going, don't move.
L:  I know, it feels scarier, you know, now with everything --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, going on.  Oh, gosh that's funny 'cause I heard, uh, on, um -- I'm not sure if it's a train -- direct train to Washington, I believe that you can't get up to the restroom at all.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yes, and a lot of people say that, you know, in a way it's aggravating because, you know, y- these are things you can't control, but in a way it does feel, you know, safer, but, yeah, apprehensive when you do see somebody get up [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm, exactly.
L:  You know, I -- yeah, I think they -- I believe they stopped the plane, or -- and just head back if you get up, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm happy to hear that's not on every flight, you know.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So, what are --
R:  Isn't that amazing?
L:  Yeah, I kn -- well, so far like I said, you know, I haven't been flying for a long -- a couple of years, like five, and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- the last flight I took, I mean, I had a video camera and I remember they checked it inside out and, you know, it was like, you know, I've never taken a video camera on a flight before so it was weird but --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- you know, I'm apprehensive about flying now, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's like, you know, you never know.  If somebody's gonna do bad is gonna do it regardless, you know, of the transit system in New York City, you know, everybody's afraid something's gonna happen, but, you know we just don't know and --
R:  No, we don't know.  We really don't.
L:  Yeah, have you flied more or less than before?
R:  Um, about the -- pretty much about the same.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, you know, just like you said, you know you just -- you pray, you trust in the Lord and you just do what you have to do.  
L:  Exactly.
R:  And I refuse -- and I -- you know, and I -- and I have the attitude I just refuse to live in fear.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, I know that things can happen and -- and, I mean, outside of terrorism, I mean, just think of every day, you can get in --
L:  That's true .
R:  -- an accident, you can be -- get hit.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You can get -- you know, tons of things can happen on a regular basis.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so, you know, the terrorists to me, you know, is just -- I mean, it's -- to me it's just not any --
L:  [NOISE]
R:   -- it's not any more dangerous I don- -- I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- than just living -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- than living life.
L:  Mhm [NOISE].
R:  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah, exactly [NOISE].  
R:  You just have to b- --
L:  Do you feel [NOISE] -- do you feel in your area safe?  [NOISE] You know, more precautions are being taken or ...?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, you know what?  No -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there is no real signs.  I mean, you know, like I said I'm in the Midwest, so I'm probably what --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a thousand miles away from you?
L:  I know [LAUGH].
R:  And, uh, there -- there's no -- there's no -- there's no, uh, signs of any real, um, heightened security or any --
L:  Really?
R:  R- mhm, no.
L:  At p- -- at like major hubs, or ... ?
R:  No, n- --
L:  No?
R:  And there's no -- and there's no, um, National Guard out.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh no.
L:  I know, I mean [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-uh.  No, nothing like that.
L:  Yeah, we're always, I guess, on high alert after what happened and everybody's afraid with the Empire State Building, but --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- if we keep on worrying about it, you know, I think I will never go.  I'm a student in college and I think I would -- I would -- I wouldn't even go to school if I [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- if I worried about it, but --
R:  Right, exactly, exactly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's something else though, isn't it?
L:  Yeah, it is.  It's, you know.
R:  But, no, I don- -- I -- I think that -- I think that little things -- you know, I think the security can ward off -- let's say that somebody, you know, wants to, you know, hurt another person --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's more personal as opposed to a terrorist --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- type thing.  I think those kinds of things you can -- you can kind of, you know, um, stop from happening, but true terrorist?  I don't think so.
L:  I don't think -- do you feel as if, uh, the -- the people they have trained at the airports to check the bags, do you feel like, you know, they were doing a good job, or did you notice they were like uneducated, untrained, too young, too old, you know, how did you feel?
R:  Well, um, y- I -- I felt like it, you know -- I felt like -- I mean, for the most part I felt like everybody was professional --
L:  Good.
R:  -- and, you know, they knew what was expected of them in their job --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I didn't -- I didn't feel like, um -- I didn't feel like, uh, you know, I just didn't feel like -- well, I mean, I was comfortable.  I mean, I wasn't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I wasn't uncomfortable.  I didn't feel like people were, you know, didn't know what they were doing or anything like that.
L:  Good.  
R:  Mm mm.
L:  Did you feel pressured?  Like, did they make you feel, you know, like --
R:  Well --
L:  You know, were they rude?  'Cause sometimes --
R:  No.  Huh-uh. 
L:  -- you know, [LAUGH] in New York it's l- [LAUGH] --
R:  -- yeah, exactly.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, no, hm mm.  People were --
L:  Oh, good.
R:  -- were -- were -- you know -- and then because they know that it takes so long and they know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that people, you know, are kind of aggravated by having to go through this whole process.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's, you know, you know, they would -- people would tell you what to expect before it happened and --
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, those kinds of things and I think that when people know what's gonna happen before -- know what to expect I think it helps to calm people down.
L:  Mm.  Did -- did they send you like, uh, before your flight did they give you a list of things you couldn't take on, or ...?
R:  No, uh-uh.
L:  Oh, no, okay.
R:  No, hm mm.  And then, you know, remember -- I don't know if you remember back, but they would ask you this statement, um, "Has anybody asked you -- has anybody had y- -- has your -- have your bags been out of your possession?  Has anybody asked you to carry anything for you?" 
L:  Oh really?  
R:  Remember when they used to say that?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Well, they don't say that any more.
L:  Oh wow.  But now nobody carries your bags in or out of the airport -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- you carry it.  Oh okay.
R:  Uh-huh.  No, no, no.  Remember the statement when you would go to get your ticket or you go to check in?
