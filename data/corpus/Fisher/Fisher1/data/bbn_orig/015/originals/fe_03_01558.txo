L:  Hi, my name's Liza --
R:  Hi, Liza --
L:  -- and I live in Virginia.
R:  -- my name is Marsha.
L:  [LAUGH] [COUGH] I don't know much about, um, professional sports, but ...
R:  Well, you took the words right out of my mouth.  [LAUGH]
L:  I was, like, okay, uh, I do think they're overpaid.  [LAUGH]
R:  I think you're right.  I, uh, but I -- I --
L:  Or at least many of them.
R:  I -- I -- I -- I don't think that, um, i- if -- if -- w- we'll be fair -- unless we're fair -- [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, people with, er, professions --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- that are important [LAUGH] to the way the world goes should be paid more, uh [LAUGH] but I guess we, um, look up to professional athletes, uh, for something or other.  I think they, uh, let us down.
L:  I --
R:  I think there've been too many scandals, um, who's playing this and who's on drugs and who's [MN] they're certainly not role models like they used to be in my parents' day.  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm not sure they ever were though.  W- I saw the movie about Babe Ruth and a couple of -- I can't think of the other one -- and they weren't too, um -- [LAUGH]
R:  I think maybe -- maybe they hit it better then.  I --
L:  Yeah, well, that's probably true.  I suspect that just like with the presidency and things the, uh, news media didn't, uh --
R:  Well, they're more aggressive now.
L:  -- embarrass people.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  And went to extreme, probably, to keep things under wraps.  Either that or they were paid off easier.  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Ha, isn't that sad?  Isn't that sad?  But I th- -- I think you're right.  I think they're paid too much money.  I think, uh, we should pay our teachers more.  I think we should pay, um, I think our -- our doctors and surgeons, people who save lives, people who educate people.
L:  Fire Department.
R:  The Fire Department.
L:  The policemen.
R:  The police.
L:  Military.
R:  Amen!  Amen!
L:  [MN]
R:  Amen!  I mean, those are -- those are people who are giving value back.  And I -- I don't know -- I think sports is a game [SIGH] and everybody -- I mean, I listen to some of the commentaries -- I listen to the radio when I'm cooking --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- or cleaning the house and, uh, I'll listen to, well, news radio and they -- and -- and they start giving sport scores and "It's a defeat" and "It's -- it was a -- a courageous effort and it was ..."
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Excuse me, uh, this is a game we're talking about.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Courageous effort!  Courageous effort is what somebody is -- i- -- you know, who is -- who is fighting cancer is doing.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Somebody who is batting a ball around, uh, four bases, you know! [LAUGH]  I -- I guess I'm --
L:  A good point.  It's a good point.
R:  I guess I'm a little cynical.  I d- [LAUGH] just don't --
L:  Well, I feel the same way about CEOs that make --
R:  Oh, isn't that awful?
L:  -- millions and millions of dollars and then they're -- they're basically screwing the -- the -- j- the -- the -- the worker bees --
R:  Certainly, certainly.
L:  -- um, out of their benefits or their retirements or their whatever, um, but they're getting these lovely, um, golden parachutes and -- and ...
R:  It's like that in everything.  But I think some of them are a little more exaggerated than others.  When -- when you have the, um, power to make the decisions you're not gonna to cut your own salary.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  You're gonna cut somebody else's -- the worker bee.
L:  Well, at one point -- I think it was the Japanese had a system whereby the CEO couldn't make but five times more than the lowest paid worker.
R:  Hm mm.
L:  And, you know, there were various levels in between.  But basically the top point was -- was five times what the lowest salary was.  And, you know, the more I think about it the more I like that prospect.  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm wonder- -- I'm wondering if they still do that.
L:  Uh, I -- I don't know if -- if that was worldwide spread or -- or what.  Probably not.
R:  Well, the Japanese have -- have a --
L:  But I really like the idea.
R:  Yeah, well.  W- us worker bees should get together [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and -- and go on strike.  I think that was part of the question too, the -- the --
L:  The strike.
R:  -- these -- these people at high -- high salaries have the --
L:  Well, but they're only striking for more money and I think they're overpaid to begin with.
R:  Exactly, exactly the point.  They -- they -- -- they -- they just ... and I think it's unfor- --
L:  I mean, you can't go to a football game here, you can't afford to.  It's fifty or sixty dollars for a ticket.
R:  Oh, my Lord!  I haven't even attempted to go to a professional game of anything in like --
L:  Well, I'm going -- [LAUGH] actually going to a baseball game tomorrow.
R:  Oh, wonderful.
L:  But it was free tickets so ...  [LAUGH]
R:  That's even better.  [LAUGH]  That's even --
L:  But somebody paid for them.
R:  Oh, of course, yeah, yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, in fact it was, uh, they're -- they're corporate box seats.  So, I know --
R:  Oh, you're gonna have a wonderful time.
L:  -- they probably paid big bucks for 'em.
R:  Oh, yeah!
L:  But I -- I can't see that  it makes sense.  [COUGH]
R:  But there you go again, we're -- we're asking for -- for -- for life to be logical and I don't think it comes out that way.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  More's the pity.  But, uh ...
L:  So, what you're saying is we should be out there learning how to play baseball really well?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  But I -- you know, then -- then I back to, would I want to?
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]  I mean, I've retired --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- and -- and I -- I -- I -- I don't work for a living any more.  They just mail my cheque, and that's wonderful.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, best thing I've ever done for myself.  But I don't think I would've wanted to do that.  I don't think I would've enjoyed it.  So, I -- I think it has to be a calling.  But I think they let down so many of their fans who truly do loo- look up to them, uh, uh, I think their fans should get a life.  [LAUGH]  Bu- --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- uh, but it's --
L:  I know.  That's where World -- World, uh, Wrestling Federation or whatever they're called --
R:  Oh, my --
L:  -- comes in.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- God!  Do they make big bucks too?
L:  Oh, they make horrendous amounts of money.
R:  Oh, that's sad.
L:  And they've charged these people these ungodly amounts for fake wrestling.
R:  Oh, my goodness!  Well, see, I'm not --
L:  It's all fluff!
R:  -- I'm not really into sports at all.
L:  Oh!
R:  So, I don't -- I don't -- I don't follow this stuff, I just read what's in the paper and if it makes the headlines maybe I've looked at it.  Um, my husband used to be a professional soccer player, but professional soccer players when my husband was a player --
L:  They didn't -- didn't get anything, yeah.
R: -- didn't make squat, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they're making a little bit more money now in certain --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- certain areas --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- anyway.
R:  And -- and all he got was -- was a hip replacement.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Nob- [LAUGH] -- somehow I don't think that's compensation!
L:  Nah, it doesn't quite -- it doesn't quite work the same.
R:  No, no, it doesn't.  And what game are you gonna see tomorrow?
L:  Uh, Oriels and Tampa I think.  I don't know.
R:  Where is that, in Baltimore?
L:  Baltimore.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, now nice!  Oh, how nice!  I suppose the weather is nice down there?
L:  Um 
R:  Well, it's spring, it's not snowing.
L:  It's a little bit warm today.  It's been kinda rainy.
R:  Oh, yeah, it has been, it has been even --
L:  Where are you?
R:  We're in Connecticut, um, and it's -- it's been -- it's been -- it's been nasty.  We -- we just got back from, um, we spend the winter away from Connecticut.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You snowboard, do you?
R:  Excuse me?
L:  You snowboard, do you?
R:  Yes, but we do it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- we exaggerate.  We go all the way to South America.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh!
R:  And -- but I watch sports there.  I go to soccer matches there, and their -- their players aren't paid as -- a -- anywhere near as much as -- as professional players are here, uh, and maybe that's b- -- maybe that makes it more interesting, I don't know.  It's something --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I hadn't thought of.
L:  What -- what part of, uh, South America ...?
R:  We go to Uruguay.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've never been any, well, farther than Mexico South.
R:  Oh, Mexico's lovely.  I like Mexico.
L:  My husband keeps wanting to go to Rio and I --
R:  Rio is the most beautiful city I have ever seen in my life.
L:  Really?
R:  It is, it is.
L:  I'm just afraid of it.
R:  Oh, no, no, no, no.
L:  Not to be?  I just keep hearing it's -- has such, uh 
R:  Well, it's like a big city.  I mean, I --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- wouldn't go to New York wearing all my -- my -- my tiara and my jewels.
L:  Yeah, well, I've had problems there too.  [LAUGH]  I've --
R:  But that's what I'm saying.  Big cities are big cities, uh, you -- you just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- need to exercise a little care, um.  I mean, I've seen very professional, um, pick pockets in Rio.
L:  [MN]
R:  Uh, but they --
L:  Yeah, we ran into those in Amsterdam two weeks ago.
R:  There you go!
L:  [SIGH]
R:  You know?  It can be anywhere.  Oh, but you h- -- you can't -- you can't die without seeing Rio.  Rio is gorgeous!  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, well, he's been after us.
R:  Oh, listen to your husband.  Good man!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Say, "Yes, dear.  [LAUGH]  Yes, dear, take me to Rio" and go see a soccer match.
L:  I was doing good to get him to Europe.
R:  [LAUGH] Ah, yes!
L:  I didn't think that was going to happen.
R:  Well, that -- you know, uh, especially with the way things are today, um, travelling is -- one thinks, "Should I or shouldn't I?"  But we do it.
L:  No, we've -- we've continued even after -- immediately after nine eleven we were --
R:  Mm, good for you.
L:  -- going from one end of the country to the other.  Hadn't --
R:  Good for you.
L:  I guess we didn't do any international travel at that point.  But I probably would have.
R:  Yeah, well, you ca- --
L:  But even -- even on this last trip, which like I said, was just within the last two weeks, we had two people pulled off the train that we were in duri- -- in Germany.  One was supposedly Turkish on a Danish passport and he spoke perfect English.
R:  Wow!
L:  And then several stops later they came back on board, went through everybody again and asked for passports, and they pulled off someone else who looked very similar --
R:  Mm mm.
L:  But we didn't hear his interrogation, so I don't know much about that.  But I kept thinking, you know, "I'm sure they think this guy's a terrorist" or, you know, something along that line.
R:  My goodness!  We're so far removed from that in South America.  Thank God!
L:  Isn't that funny?
R:  Thank God!  Yeah, I know.  But, [MN] absolutely everything that I've read in the newspaper, you know, and we -- we'd follow things in the newspaper and watch CNN but, um, absolutely -- absolutely no --
L:  Well, you know, it would seem funny that, you know, they're saying that they had taken over places in the Phila- --
