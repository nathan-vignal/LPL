R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Yes.  Hello.  My name is Alice Keyser.
L:  Hi.  I'm Cheryl Hubbard.
R:  Okay.
L:  W-
R:  Where you from?
L:  I'm out in California.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Chicago area.
L:  Oh, good heavens!
R:  Yes.  The western suburbs.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  So, I guess our topic is, um -- I couldn't quite understand what the recording said.
L:  The --
R:  The strike?
L:  Yes.
R:  Was that it?  By the professional athl- athletes?
L:  Yes.  And if we think that they, uh, deserve the salaries that they already get.
R:  Well [COUGH], you tell me --
L:  Heavens, no!  [LAUGH]
R:  -- what you think.  Excuse me!  [LAUGH]  I think they, um, really, really make out well.  [LAUGH]
L:  I think that, yeah, they do make out way too well and they need to stop being babies and just do their entertainment.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And, you know, if they -- if they use their money well, you know, then, well, you know --
L:  Well, yes.
R:  -- that's -- that's what ya -- you know, I mean, there are some jobs that pay pretty well and I think that they do get too much money.  But, uh, you know, if they're -- if they're using it well, but of- often I hear stories about athletes that just gamble away their money and just -- they don't -- they don't r- -- they don't respect their money.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?
L:  See, though, I haven't heard about the gambling and stuff.  But [SIGH] I do just think that, you know what, uh, it's human, um [LIPSMACK] -- oh, what's the word I'm looking for?  We just tend to live with whatever money we're making.
R:  Yes.
L:  And, uh -- and we always just want more.
R:  Yeah.  That's really true.
L:  And I think a lot of the time with the athletes that they do it -- I mean, they just -- they make way too much money.  [LAUGH]
R:  They sure make a lot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm sure they probably have a lot of insurance and, you know, travel costs and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- who knows what all.  But still they -- they really, really make out.
L:  Yeah, they definitely do that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, I -- I don't -- I don't know ...  Do you watch basketball and -- and baseball and all that?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Not really.  I -- I --m- -- I -- I see it once and while, you know, when I go by a TV or something like that.  But we're not -- I've got six boys and one girls and, you know, it's funny, but we -- none of us are real big sports fans.
L:  [MN]
R:  Uh, I mean my boys are athletic, you know, and they -- they do a lot of stuff, but they're not -- you know, we haven't just spent ... bulk of time, uh, sitting in front of the -- the tube watching sports.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And ...  But then when Michael Jordan was [LIPSMACK] -- was doing his three P. thing, you know, in Chicago, um, you know, my -- I paid a little more attention but not really --
L:  Right.
R:  -- all that much.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  See, I don't watch any of those.  We- --
R:  But that was a long time ago.
L:  -- We're hockey people at our house.
R:  Oh, I see.  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I guess ea- to each his own.  I -- like I say, I -- I don't ...  But what I do enjoy watching is figure skating.  That's --
L:  Yes, I like that too.
R:  That's -- that's very, uh -- I think the rhythm is, uh ...
L:  Yes.
R:  It's such a beaut- --
L:  Yeah, I don't believe --
R:  -- beautiful sport.
L:  -- that they make the kinda money as the, um, like the NBA and ...
R:  No, I don't think so.
L:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  No.  No.  The others are just -- it's -- that's ridiculous.  But [SIGH] don't you think a lot of the reason there's money there is j- because they, huh -- there is a lot of gambling going on about foot- you know, because of the sports.
L:  Right.
R:  I think gamble- -- the sports -- the games are being gambled on and, you know, they -- they, uh --
L:  Yes.  See I didn't even think about that.
R:  Yeah.  I think ...  Well, I happen to have a friend who -- who has a -- a boyfriend who -- who, um, is just very addicted to sports gambling.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I didn't really think about it much before that either.  But [LIPSMACK] I guess it's done, you know, quite a bit.
L:  Yeah.  It actually -- I -- I hear that it gets to be really addicting.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anything like that would be though.
L:  Well, 'cause you keep thinking, "Oh, I could just make a little bit more money".  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, I know, and sometimes it's a lot more.  But, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- And then -- then you're gonna get into all kinds of graft with setting up their games and stuff like that.
L:  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  Though about, like, car racing and stuff?  See, I don't what their salaries are, but ...
R:  I have no clue.  I -- I -- [LIPSMACK] I can't see that, you know, I mean, to me it's just like --
L:  Yeah.  I was gonna say I don't they, like, ever go out on strike or anything do they?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, are th- -- are there the big, um, you know, associations like there are with, uh, baseball and stuff?  Somehow or other I -- I had the idea that car racing was a little bit more individual, but maybe I'm wrong about that.  I just don't know.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, you know what?  I'm not sure that would be one of those things that ...  Well, you know what?  I -- you know, I watch hockey.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, right.  So, you just don't know.
L:  I -- I don't really pay attention to everything else.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I do listen, you know, to the radio and the -- and the news and stuff, and when they start talking about [SIGH] "Oh, baseball's thinking about going on strike" and I'm thinking, "Oh, people grow up!"
R:  Yeah.  I know.
L:  You know?
R:  That's true.  I -- I completely agree.
L:  Like everything that's going on in the world.  You know what?  Live with what you're making.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  If you're not making it, sell something.  [COUGH]
R:  Yeah [LAUGH], right.  Or just drink water or something.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Cut a few things out, beer would be better.
R:  Yeah.  I agree.  I agree.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  And there's plenty of people out there that [SIGH] ...  Oh, it's catching!  Um ...
L:  So sorry.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH] No, that's okay.  Um, there's plenty of people out there that are just, you know, they -- they live practically a whole year on what some people spend in a day.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, it's just --
L:  It's just -- it is.
R:  -- crazy.
L:  It -- it is crazy and it's like, the more money you make the more you spend and --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- it's just -- I don't know.  I -- I think a lot of the time -- I don't know if they come up from homes where they really didn't have much and --
R:  They're kind of over-reacting?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That could be.  And also they don't know how to use it.
L:  That's true.
R:  And how to handle it because they didn't have it.
L:  They don't do the investing and stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause I think ...  Okay.  This is mean of me.  But I think with like, the NBA, the basketball guys and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a lot of them I don't think do the hi- -- you know, they don't get their degrees and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They go straight in, you know, to basketball, uh, professionally.
R:  Really?
L:  So, they -- they have no other education.
R:  Oh, that's too bad!
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I heard -- you know, I'm sure you've heard it too, that they just kinda get pushed through school --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, uh, they end up graduating when really they s- shouldn't.
R:  They didn't work it.  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  They didn't learn it.
L:  [SIGH] Right.  So, you know, I just [SIGH] ...  I think the NBA is -- NBA and the baseball are like [LAUGH] the worst as far as I'm concerned.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, it's -- it's just a big game, like, you know, a big fraud, I mean, just a scam [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sort of really.  But ...
L:  Very much so.  And they just, you know, they end up making it so that, you know, [MN] real people just can't make it to the -- the, uh, games and stuff because with their salaries and stuff I think they just are increasing everything so much 'cause they have to make up for it somewhere.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  And we end up paying for it.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Right.  If -- if we decide to go and watch the game.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  We pay for it, yeah.  So ...
L:  Well, even [LAUGH] -- as my husband said, uh, "If you buy anything that's, um, being advertised in between, on commercials --"
R:  Oh, yes.  Right.
L:  "-- [LAUGH] you're also supporting them too".
R:  Yeah, that's true.  You are.  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Ah.
R:  But we don't do that much TV buying.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  I don't either.
R:  So, that's a good thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, do you have kids that do sports?
L:  Um, actually, mine are very little.  They are --
R:  Are they?
L:  Yeah.  I've got one that's almost eight, and a five and a two year old.
R:  Oh, my!  Just got a --
L:  And the two older ones actually played soccer last year for the first time.  So ...
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  And ev- --
R:  The five and the eight year old?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they actually [LAUGH] -- they like to watch the hockey with their dad.  They're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- starting to get into that.  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we don't watch any of the other stuff.  So, they -- you know, they're oblivious to it.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  Which I think is probably better anyway.
R:  Yeah, I think so too.  I think the priorities get -- it's so easy for -- to get priorities off center in this s- c- culture.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  That, yeah, if -- if you just focused all the time on, you know, TV, sports, it would -- I think, you know, it really does off -- off balance the kids 'cause they don't get the priorities.  They see their parents giving all this priority time wise and -- and attention and so on, on these sports and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they don't -- they just get a really skewed idea of what priorities are.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  And especially the ones that, um, [LIPSMACK] their moms are single moms and their dads aren't in the picture.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  Oh, yeah, that's right.
L:  'Cause they're looking at -- they're looking at these guys and thinking "Oh", you know?
R:  Well, they're kinda like heroes to 'em --
L:  Yeah, which is really sad because [MN] --
R:  -- I suppose.  Yeah, it is sad.  But ...
L:  And they don't care and they just do their own thing.  But you know what?  That's their -- their rights.
R:  Right.
L:  But, uh --
R:  No --
L:  -- I don't know.  I think when --
R:  -- you don't have to give them respect.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] I'm sorry.  I have a cold.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, my husband is sick right now.  You don't have SARS now, do you?
L:  Have what?
R:  SARS.
L:  No, no.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just -- I ended up with a -- a cold from my daughter.  So ...
R:  Oh, that's too bad.  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, is there much SARS around where you guys are?
L:  Mm, I don't think so.  I really don't even hear much about it.
R:  Mhm.  We've been hearing about it.  There's a few cases in -- cases in Illinois now and [SIGH] ... excuse me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Sorry, [several inaudible words].
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  [LAUGH] Well -- well, it's eleven -- it's eleven oh eight right now.
L:  Oh, my gosh!
R:  'Cause, see, we're two hours ahead of you?
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  No, I was -- I was up -- up still putting things away from my kitchen and stuff like that, but ...
L:  Oh!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  No, we've been getting, um, you know, reports on the number of SARS cases just --
L:  'Cause isn't it like a flu type thing?
R:  Uh, I -- you know, I'm not getting that it's a flu so much as it is, um --
