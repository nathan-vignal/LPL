L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, how are you doing?
L:  I'm fine, fine.
R:  I'm Susan.
L:  I'm Frankie --
R:  Uh-huh
L:  -- and I live in Maine.
R:  Hi, um, so you're far away from me.  I live in Texas. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I -- I was wondering.  I figured it had to be somewhere down south, out west type feel --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] How did you know?  You are very good.
L:  Well, we have a lot of, um, service people in the area --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and -- and I've travelled quite extensively so some of the accents you pick up pretty quick, you know.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Some are more pronounced than others of course, you know.  Yeah.
R:  Okay, well, I guess you can tell from my accent. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well somewhat, somewhat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Hi, um, I think our today's topic is the strike on athletes.
L:  Yes.
R:  What do you --
L:  Yes, I think they get paid way too much.
R:  [LAUGH] That's what I think too.
L:  I real- I do.  They get paid way too much and, um, they actually perform a service to this country as far as, uh, what they do because too many other people depend on them performing.  And I don't think they should strike, I really don't.
R:  [MN] They shouldn't.  I -- oh, well what I thinking is that once you get paid so much you feel you have the privilege, you have the right to get all you want but it's not true.  A lot of people, the people who paid them to watch them perf- -- you know, like, um, the w- to watch all those athletes --
L:  Right.
R:  -- are the person who are supporting their salary.
L:  Oh, the- -- definitely.  In fact they've priced themselves -- some of the fans that used to take their kids and stuff that I know personally, they can't afford to go to a ball game 'cause to take themselves and child is the best part of two hundred dollars.
R:  Yeah, I unders- I know that.  And then they are striking, that means they are kind of biting the hand that feed them. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, and they're putting all these other people out of work and inconveniencing them and everything else.  I -- I really don't believe that they should strike.  They have no reason to strike to begin with.  They've got -- they've bargained, they've made their contracts and if they're not happy that's too bad, next time, you know, don't sign your contract if you don't like it.
R:  Yeah, they --
L:  You know, I mean --
R:  -- they -- they are not like, uh,-- they, uh, got forced into this job, they don't have any choices that -- that -- or the company is going bankrupted.
L:  Right.
R:  You now, that's no- nothing of pride to them it's like [LAUGH] -- it's like they're abusing a privi- privilege too much.
L:  They are, they are.  They just think that they're above everything and anybody.  Um, and I think we have placed way too much emphasis on sports in this country, to the point where even in school sports take, uh, precedence over, uh --
R:  The -- the +curriculum.
L:  -- the -- the educational part.
R:  Yeah, yeah --
L:  Yes, and --
R:  -- that's what I feel too.
L:  Yeah, and they're not role models anymore for the most part the -- and --
R:  Who -- who say they are role model, I heard so many sports persons --
L:  All the bad stuff that -- and --
R:  Yeah, they -- they have, you know, like --
L:  I mean they're human so you can expect that.
R:  They -- I -- I always feel they -- once they get into the spotlight then I feel they are god. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, they -- they're not god because first of all they're men.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, so -- I mean, men, [MN] I mean you don't hear the stuff about women going on.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Women are al- -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or if -- if it is going on they're a little more discreet.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're not flaunting it.  Um --
R:  Do -- do  you remember once, um, they have one thing that if the history was controlled by women they don't have that much war.
L:  Well, that's true.  That's true.  I mean, [SIGH] it's -- it's crazy.  But I -- I think, like you, that the striking bit has gotten out of hand, I mean, they have managers and they have business managers that sit down and go over these contracts line by line, uh, to the point where it's nauseam, uh, to hear them --
R:  They probably have lawyers who go through them too.
L:  Oh, they -- they do, they have lawyers and business managers and unless --
R:  Accountants.
L:  -- unless the owners, uh, actually violate that contract, that they don't live up to the contract, I mean, if they say that they're going to put them in a four star hotel and they put them in some motel six in the back woods, yeah, they can get upset but to me that's not a reason to strike.
R:  You -- you know, you know,  you get --
L:  I mean, that's just a disagreement, that's something that can be ironed out between two --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- average brained adults.
R:  Ye- ye- -- let's do it this way, if you -- right now the economy is really going down, you know, it's -- in -- in a pretty bad situation --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- and you -- if a company that is in business -- they have employee in their business and they say, "Okay, the company is not making money, well, today when you go out we are not going to put you in a four star hotel, we are going to put you in a motel six".
L:  Right.
R:  That's no -- the employees say, go on strike, say, "No, no, no, we have to get ..."
L:  I mean I -- they would be glad that they're -- that the company is even picking up the tab for that.
R:  Yeah, yeah. 
L:  You know --
R:  That's true.
L:  Yeah, I just think that they have gotten to the point where they just -- they demand --the -- the baseball players are just demanding and they expect everything to be handed to them and I don't think that's right.  I mean --
R:  They gonna spoil it.
L:  -- there's too many people in -- there's too many people in this country that are going without and here they are flaunting the millions and millions they get --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Guaranteed, they have a talent, yes.  And guaranteed they have to practise and everything else but there are other people that have just as much talent in different fields, uh, but --
R:  They don't get paid so much and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they don't go into strike too.
L:  Right, right.  They're just allowed to be able to have -- they -- they should just be glad that they have a job that pays that kind of money, you know.
R:  I think the whole thing is they really to spoil it.  Like -- like the sports complex we have to build for those athletes.
L:  Oh.  Oh, I know.
R:  And then they have the taxpayer to pick up the tab because they have to have this, they have to have that in order to perform good.  Well, it's not that I disagree with them, it's that everything has a limit.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.
R:  If you keep on going the sky is the limit, so then when are you going to stop.  You always can find things fault in the whole situation.  You can find this fault, find that fault, okay, fine.
L:  Oh, yes everything has -- has it's -- has it's drawbacks.
R:  Life is not perfect. [LAUGH]
L:  N- No, if it was perfect, uh, nothing would -- it would be boring actually if anything was perfect.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But, I mean, they keep asking for more and more so the ticket prices have to go up so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the attendance goes down.  I mean at some point in time there's not going to be any need for these massive stadiums because only the super rich or the companies can afford to have boxes and even the companies I don't believe --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are buying as many, uh, seasonal boxes.
R:  Well, even -- uh, last time I went to see a football or some -- uh, uh, a basketball or something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, I got -- somebody give me the tickets.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And one day I have to pay fifteen dollars for the parking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I was [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, so now if the -- if the -- if the fans aren't going then the parking attendants aren't making money --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the -- the concession people aren't make money --
R:  Yeah, 'cause that -- if you spend so much money you go in there, you are thinking, "Oh, what am I going to buy, maybe I should buy less in the confection stand" then my kids starve a little bit.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah and then everybody starts bringing in their own candy in their pockets and stuff like that, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I know they frown on that, they do in the movie theatres too but, I mean, it gets to be a little bit ridiculous when the popcorn costs more than the movie ticket.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's -- that's what --
L:  You know, I mean --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and that's basically -- that's basically what's starting to happen.
R:  Then you -- you start to not everybody has one -- a family have to share one bag instead of everybody have a little bag, you know.
L:  Yeah, you know.
R:  Well, this thing gets more and more --
L:  Yeah, I -- I just don't feel that they're in a position to be striking.  No more than, uh, health care workers should strike.  And I -- I -- I really incensed when I see some of that because when you're doing a service job you just -- you know, unless conditions are so bad that you can't work and then that becomes a governmental issue or a governing agency issue, that doesn't become, uh, taking the right to walk out I -- I don't know I just think that strikes sometimes don't do what they are intended --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to do.  And nobody wins with a strike.
R:  Yeah, it's --
L:  Especially --
R:  -- a lot of people lose and economic lose too.
L:  Of course.
R:  You know, the government is losing tax money by all those strikes.
L:  Oh yes, definitely.  Definitely because all that admission money isn't getting spent and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- being taxed. [SIGH] Oh yeah.
R:  And then if -- if the people is coming from, you know, other towns to go to this town to watch the sports--
L:  Right, I mean --
R:  -- and that's -- what are they going to do?  They spend all this money beforehand and got here and then it gone.
L:  Right, especially if they have to make arrangements and reservations at hotels --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and stuff like that.  Uh, you know, for some of these big events.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And a lot of times that money is not refundable.
R:  They will [inaudible].
L:  You know, I mean, and it's really a shame --
R:  And then there's --
L:  -- because everybody -- like you say everybody loses so, no, I don't think they have the right to strike.
R:  I -- I -- you -- you speaking of strike I remember, um, about ten or -- ten or twelve years they have a company in San Francisco and, uh, they have unions in their corporation --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the manufacturing facility and the uni- union kept on demanding more and more and more and to a degree that they demand that, uh, the -- the people who clean the bathroom --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, those c- custodians?
L:  Yeah.
R:  They have to have a minimum pay of twenty -- twenty dollars.  I was talking about ten -- ten years ago.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ten, twelve years ago.  So, twenty dollars is quite a bit for custodian.  They -- if you can hire people minimum wage to do those things but because of the union they do that.  And after a while company feel like they got fed up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so they shut the whole things down and moved Colorado.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] That's what ...
