R:  Hi, my name is Ying.
L:  Hi, I'm sorry, what was your name?
R:  Ying.
L:  Ying? 
R:  Mhm.
L:  My name is Courtney.
R:  Hi, Courtney, how are you doing? 
L:  Good, how are you doing today? 
R:  I'm doing well.
L:  Good, good.  Um, I guess I'll start off, ah, with the strikes.  I think they get paid too high. 
R:  Definitely.
L:  And -- and they're crying and whining that they're not getting paid enough which they're getting paid way too much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then they go on strike which, it's -- it's just not right.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, the amount they are play- ah, they are paid is so disproportionate with what they're providing, it's -- it's insane.  I mean the President himself only gets two hundred thousand dollars and there are players out there that are getting, like, a hundred and sixty million for five years.  
L:  Yep.
R:  You know, that -- that's just crazy and there's so many other things that -- that money could, you know, do that would provide much more benefit -- 
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  -- to the rest of the world.  
L:  There's -- there's millions and, you know, there's -- we have problems with homeless --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and people out of jobs and especially since the war time, you know, even though we are a war time economy, it's -- it's -- you know, a lot of people are struggling now.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And these people are making all this money, they need to give back. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  They need to stop complaining that they're not making enough and give back to -- to their communities. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and they don't, they just either blow it up their nose or, you know --
R:  Yeah, that's -- I mean the horrible thing is that so many of them, especially it seems like in football, and are doing these horrible, horrible things, being arrested and just being sent to jail, you know.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean it's terrible.  They just -- you know, "Oh, well, I'm -- I'm making, ah, five -- five million", I mean there should be a cap --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on what professional athletes make.
R:  Mhm.
L:  "You know, I'm making five million and that's not enough because I feel I'm -- I'm just -- I'm better than that, let's go on strike", that's just not right.
R:  Yeah, I know, and for these guys to be complaining and striking when there are -- there are also a lot of really low paid, you know, relatively low paid people in the leagues as well who really suffer when these strikes go on.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's because these high paid people don't want caps, you know, and it's, like, well, you know, the caps are just to keep everything in control so that there aren't people that are paid a hundred and sixty million dollars when there are people that are still in the league that are getting paid like thirty or forty thousand and they still have to -- when the season is over, they still have to go and find something else to do.
L:  Right.
R:  And these guys are just, like, whining about how or why should I put a limit on -- on how much I get just because other people feel its disproportionate, you know, it's a free market economy. Yeah. [LAUGH]  
L:  Definitely, definitely.  Or, you know, if they decide to go on strike, the professionals, you know, like the major leagues decide to go on strike, I think they should, you know, have a clause on their contracts that they can't strike or if they do go on strike then they can -- that's cause to fire them. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then they just pull up some deserving people from -- from the minors --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know.  I mean, there's -- there's guys in the minors that really have -- have just as good a talent, if not better, ha- you know, most of the time who would be willing to work for chump change. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just because they love the game.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It -- it used to be that it was for the love of the game, not for the money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And now it's for the money, not the love of the game.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they need to go back to the love of the game.
R:  Yeah, 'cause in essence what this is is you're getting paid huge sums of money to play a game.
L:  Yeah, to entertain.
R:  You know, to play -- I mean -- ah, it's -- it's insane.  And so many of these guys, it seems like they don't really take it all that seriously unless you -- unless you pay them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And there's so many other people who would be like to play it just for the heck of it, you know.  I mean look at all the little sports leagues and, ah, tournaments and things that happen all over the -- all over the country, you know, where people actually pay money to play in them and these guys are whining because they can't get five million more out of their deal.
L:  Yeah.  Look at golf, okay.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Any time that you have to play in any golf tournament or anything, you have to pay a lot of money, it's expensive. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, even, like, the Open, they have to pay, like, an entry fee for this, it's not free for them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and -- and there's, like, you know, Tiger Woods, there's some really good golf -- the golf athletes.  They don't -- you don't see them going on strike.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, they -- 'cause they win cups and -- and -- and prize money and stuff like that.  That's their job.  That -- you know, they're having fun but they're actually having to work for it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they have to pay an entry fee.  It's like, I think if they had to -- if -- if a professional athlete, basketball, baseball, football, hockey, if they had to actually pay a fee to be eligible for the year beside their penalties and fines for, um, bad behaviour then maybe things would change a little bit.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or --  or the fans go on strike.
R:  I'm always surprised when the fans come back.  I mean, when baseball went on strike for that long time I thought, you know, people would be really upset and that -- that baseball would suffer for a lot longer than it did.  Especially since -- you -- I mean, all -- the people that go and watch the games, they are like your average working class blue collar people -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they're the ones that really love and support these leagues and I -- yeah, I was shocked that they would come back so soon since, you know, I -- I would feel if I were going to all these games and I was a big fan of these sports, you know, like how was that that I'm making forty, forty five thousand dollars a year and I am spending, I don't know how much on season tickets and these guys were making at least, you know, five million, a million, thirty million, whatever are -- are still whining about how they don't make enough to live because they only have one house whereas the NBA have -- you know, they're making this much and they can have three houses and -- 
L:  Yeah, or I have to pay child support for my ten kids --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and alimony to my five wives, [LAUGH] six wives --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, it's just ridiculous.  Like it -- it costs -- for what it costs to go to a professional game --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for just me and my husband --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it would be the same amount if I take my whole fa- -- a family of four to go to Disneyworld, Disneyland, wherever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and stay the night out there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in a hotel room.  I mean, that's -- that's just absurd.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean that's -- the -- the ticket prices are getting high because they go on strike because they have to pay 'em more which we -- we get the shaft end of it. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, yeah. I think the -- the ones to really blame are the owners who are just like hiking everything up and just charging -- charging an unbelievable amount for all of this.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, people -- it's surprising how -- how much business leaders and today's times are just like to trying to squeeze every last penny they can out of everything virtually, you know, like, just five, ten or not ten years ago because that was, like, -- but like twenty, thirty years ago where it was more about business and keeping the business going and providing a service to the public and now it's just, you know, how can I evade taxes, how can I squeeze the most out of these things.
L:  Yep.
R:  And whenever these strikes happen, the players always blame the owners and the owners always blame the players, it's just stop your whining, get on with what your supposed to be doing. 
L:  Right.  I mean you're -- in a sense, I mean, that's -- you are getting paid to have fun.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And if you don't have the heart for it and if you don't want to be there to entertain people, ah, -- 
R:  There's a line.
L:  -- if you are just there for the money --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, to make massive amounts of money, then you -- you shouldn't be doing it.
R:  Yeah, there's a line three hundred deep to get your job. 
L:  Yep.
R:  Yeah, if you don't want to do it for what they really want to pay you, go.  The sad thing is the owners will pay it.
L:  Yeah, they pay for the talent --
R:  Yeah, the -- 
L:  -- or the so called talent because there's -- I mean truthfully, there is average Joe people like you and me that most of the time are, you know, as talented, if not better, it's just they didn't go to, you know, college, they didn't play football in college.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or, you know, they tried to walk on but because somebody has had the hype and -- and all the prom- publicity, that's why they go for 'em and that's why they pay all that money. 
R:  Yeah, I -- I mean what -- what baseball is trying to do is a little while ago was pretty admirable, they were trying to cap it and distribute the money so that the teams would be more evenly spaced 'cause really at this point there are only, like, what four, five teams that really have any chance of winning the World Series because they're the teams that have the money to pay these exorbitant salaries so that the players always go to these teams and it's, like, why even bother with the league.
