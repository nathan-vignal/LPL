R:  [NOISE] Mary Lewis.
L:  Hi, I'm Maryanne Woodville[?]  [PAUSE]  Hello?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, hi.  Ah, what was the topic on, uh -- I think it said about, uh, airport security?
R:  [SIGH] Does it, uh, decrease terrorist [inaudible]?
L:  Um, you go ahead and begin.  I d- -- I don't know what to say.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] I think it does.
L:  It does?
R:  To an extent.
L:  Yes.  Uh, I think so too.  Um, what else ...
R:  Of course, it's kinda scary that they had some go through airport security [LIPSMACK] and I'm thinking specifically some ago time ago about some guy with rubber soled shoes or something, there was something in his shoe.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  And, um, you know how -- how -- you know, how security is real bad right now and, um, I think they just -- they should have more, um, uh, like, uh, what do you call those -- like, p- you know, more like police on -- on, uh --
R:  Oh, yeah, the people ...
L:  -- you know, airplanes, airlines, you know, because of all the terrorism going on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, um [LIPSMACK], I think that it should be more protected, you know, since, you know, there's so many s- hijackings on our airplanes and ...
R:  [SIGH] As long as they are there, uh, discreetly.
L:  Yes.
R: [LIPSMACK] Uh, and I say that because recently I took a flight a few months ago and I was standing in line --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and some guy came around and was gonna board the plane and they told him he had to the other side where they were checking people.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And the lady said, "Oh, he's security".
L:  Oh.
R:  "He's with --" I forgot what it was.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I thought, now that's real secure.  Everybody knows who he is now.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's good -- kinda strange, isn't it?
R:  So, I -- I don't think that's the kind of security I'm thinking of.  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  Uh-uh.
R:  I thought, you know, that's the first --
L:  I mean, I don't know, I would ...
R:  -- one they're going after.  [LAUGH]
L:  Really?  I would feel more safe if I were in a airplane like, going on the flight, I'd feel more s- -- more safe and security if they had, uh, uh, airplane security, you know?  Uh ...
R:  But don't advertise who they are.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's true.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you know, let 'em wonder.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Really?
R:  Now, I do think that all the, uh, security has slowed down the check in time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and such that and they don't tell ya a lot --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of it in advance.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because that particular flight --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- what I did was I went -- I traveled from Houston Inter Continental.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I -- I allowed for a lot of extra time.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  When I went through the gate --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the alarm went of course and I got through [SIGH] and it was my shoes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I -- so whenever I flew back, uh, I automatically took my shoes off before I went through the security thing.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I think they oughta, you know, post little things like that that would help people to get through quicker because if I'd known to take my shoes I'd have put 'em in the little basket [MN] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- sent 'em through and it wouldn't have held me up.  [LAUGH]
L:  Really?  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  So, little things like that could --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- help to speed it up too.
L:  Have you ever been in an airplane?
R:  [MN]
L:  I mean, I k- -- I for one have never been on one.  So ...
R:  Oh, yes, yes.
L:  And -- and I --
R:  Several times.
L:  -- if I ever go one on it'll be my first time, you know?
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I don't know.  I've just never been [LAUGH] -- I've just never had the chance to -- to go on a flight, you know, for anywhere?
R:  Well, this -- the last flight I took was, uh, for Thanksgiving and it was, um [SIGH] [LIPSMACK], American Airlines.
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh.
R:  And before that I've always flown South West or Continental.
L:  Uh-huh.  And ...
R:  And I haven't flown either one of those in over a year.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't fly a lot.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, that's the only security that, you know, I've experienced lately.  So, I don't know how the other ones are.
L:  And what do you think about, uh, uh -- they're saying like, pilots should have -- be armed with guns.  Do you agree on that?
R:  [SIGH] I don't think that's a good idea because what's the first thing that a terrorist is gonna do?
L:  Yeah.
R:  He's gonna take the gun away from the pilot.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that just gives him another gun.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  [SIGH] I think maybe, you know, uh, a stun gun or something like that might be okay.
L:  Yeah.  Or -- or a -- you know, a gun with blanks or something.  I don't know that that's gonna do any good, but [SIGH] -- I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  To me I -- I don't know -- it has -- it -- it has it's advantages and disadvantages, you know?
R:  That's true.
L:  So --
R:  That's very true.
L:  -- it's hard to say, you know, which -- you know, which way to go by, you know, if they should go for it or not, you know?
R:  Yeah.  It takes somebody a lot smarter than me to make --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- those decisions.  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess I won't never know 'cause I probably won't ever go on a flight.  [LAUGH]
R:  Because ...
L:  But I -- you know, I -- you know, there's some --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people that travel a lot -- so -- for their -- their jobs and -- and go to -- you know, here and there and so ...
R:  That's true, where I work the people travel extensively for their jobs.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  And -- and none of them seem to be worried about it though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I don't know if that's a good sign or a bad sign.
L:  I guess it just depends on the person, you know, they're -- either, when they go for it or not.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Where you from?
R:  [SIGH] Texas.
L:  Texas.  Oh, okay.  I'm here -- I -- I live in Austin.  Where do you live at?
R:  Houston.
L:  Houston.  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I live in -- here in Austin, Texas.
R:  And they have -- I do know one of the things they've done here -- I don't know about everyplace else -- but they have started having, um, vehicle checks --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- on the way to the airport.
L:  Oh, really?  Oh.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  And ...
L:  I don't -- they probably do it here too.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I -- I really don't know.
R:  And I wondered about that because I'm sure that, you know, it -- it does help some, but a lot of people ...
L:  Well, it does -- it does help too because, you know, you don't know if, you know, uh --
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  -- terrorist going through the airports.
R:  But you have to open your trunk and everything.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, you don't know if -- you know, because of all this, uh, high security checking on this.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh -- because of terrorism and all this and, I mean, that's why they're doing it, and then to see if -- if there's terrorists back into the airports and all that.  So, I mean, in a way i- it's good that's they're doing it, in a way it's not, you know, because it does --
R:  Yeah.  They --
L:  -- invade privacy too at the same time, you know?
R:  They also have random checks.
L:  Oh, they do?
R:  They did that both -- both times I was flying.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um [LIPSMACK], and I don't know if it's, like, every fifth person or what.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  But they'll pull somebody out and they'll look in their suitca- or their carry on bags --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they'll check their shoes and everything, and it was kind of strange because there was no [LIPSMACK] -- no way to tell --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what kinda people they were pulling out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, like, most of them that I saw were, like, grandmothers.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  And so people get offended, they get real offended by stuff like that, you know?
R:  And that's --
L:  They think that they're invading their privacy or, you know ...?
R:  That's the reason that I think it's, you know, every certain number.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because whenever I landed in, um -- oh, I can't remember where I -- Saint Louis I think is where I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- had to change planes, uh, and they called the -- the flight was delayed for a lot of reasons.  And then when they --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- finally did call for the flight --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a lady and I stood up at the same time and she said, "Oh, go ahead" and so I got in line in front of her.  Well, they pulled her out.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no!
R:  So ... [LAUGH]
L:  That's embarrassing.  I mean, I -- I -- she probably was embarrassed.  I -- I know I would've if it would've been me.  [LAUGH]
R:  I think -- I think it's just, you know, a random number that they --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they pull out every --
L:  Certain person.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Every so and so person.  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it is kinda embarrassing, yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.  And the problem is it delays it too because you have to s- get out of line.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You have to let them go through all your stuff and, you know, they take a little wand and everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, if you're on a flight that you don't have reserved seats --
L:  Mhm.  And that's a -- 
R:  -- like, that's the way South West is for one thing.
L:  -- last minute thing.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Then you're one of the last ones to board and you have to sit whatever's left over.
L:  Yes.  You can m- --
R:  And, so, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's an inconvenience.
L:  Yeah, it is.  I know what you mean.
R:  And I realize, you know, they're doing it for security reasons and everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I try and say, "Okay, you know, don't -- don't worry about it".
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I know there are some people that very irritated too.
L:  I know.  And as -- like I say, it has its advantages and disadvantages.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, uh, bunch of stuff like this, huh?
R:  [LIPSMACK] And I guess everything that they do like that though --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to increase security we should -- we should just --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- accept and -- and not get irritated with because it's for our own safety.
L:  I mean, it's -- they really doing it for our own good too, for our safety.
R:  Right.
L:  So, you know, some people are -- I don't know, so if you just can't please everybody, you know?
R:  That's true.
L:  They -- it's gonna happen to them, you know, it's --
R:  I do know --
L:  -- people gonna get irritated and mad.  So ...
R:  -- one of the guys I work with told me that h- every time he goes through an airport they [LAUGH] -- they give him that --
L:  He gets checked?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, he gets checked?  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  And he was very verbal about it one time.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And he said then when he got on the plane he looked round --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- all around him is airport security people.  [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  Sitting on the plane.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  I told him, I said, "They've got you red flagged".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's weird.
R:  And -- and he was the kind that -- you know, it was inconvenient because it threw him later getting on the plane and he didn't like to have to travel anyway.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, you know?  So, he -- he was very verbal with it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I don't know if he's calmed down some or not.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  But, you know, also -- and it's right around the time he told me about that -- he told me -- he goes to Louisiana a lot --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and he told me that they'd had a shooting in the airport --
L:  Really?
R:  -- over there.  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  And it was right after I had been over there and I told him, I said, "Well, I'm certainly glad I didn't know about that before I went".  And I don't --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I don't how the security, you know, affects something like that.
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK]  Golly!
R:  Um, I know that they've changed -- they have changed things here a lot where, uh, they don't allow you to go past the gate --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, the security gates there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, unless you have a ticket.
L:  Really?
R:  And I'm ...
L:  I'm pretty sure they doing that here too, in -- here in Austin.
R:  Yeah.  And I'm sure that has -- that has helped some as well.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because a lot of people could go through just pretending to see somebody off or someth-
