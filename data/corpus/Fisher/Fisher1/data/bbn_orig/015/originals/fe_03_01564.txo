L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  My name is Kelly and I'm from Pennsylvania.  How are you?
R:  Hi, I'm Rajan[?], uh, uh, I'm from Texas.  How are you?
L:  Good, good.  How are your feelings on this, with the -- the salaries of the players?
R:  Uh, well, actually being from at university I do feel like not to be fair with them.  Uh, sometimes it's better to pay them, like, you know, based on the contract basis or something.
L:  Correct.  I --
R:  Yeah.  I mean, like, you know, based on the seniority of the players.  [NOISE]  So, oh, regarding that as considering that into the picture they should start paying them.  Oh, what do you -- I mean, what do you have to say, like, about the players, like, you know, the payment exactly?
L:  Well, I'm kinda like, you know, the issue with the striking is kind of a little odd to me because they do make such incredible amounts of money and, undoubtedly, they have a talent and God bless them for the money they can make and what they've been blessed with.  However, I'm not so sure that, um, you know, they should be com- compensated in the way they are.  I mean, there's so many people in the world that are jobless.  And, you know, I know they do bring a lot of revenue into the country with what they do and so on but, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, as far as their -- their salaries and their ability to strike, I guess it's kind of, uh -- something I can't really comprehend or understand, you know?  I come from a middle class family and, you know, we work hard and, you know, I feel like well, they just work a couple -- you know, they work the s- --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- work through the season and they're making money that I may never make in my lifetime, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... and, uh, however, on the other hand, you know, I do understand that they have a talent and that, you know, they bring a lot of money in, um, into the country from what they do and that they generate a lot of money during their seasons and so on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but I guess for me it's just a little hard to +comprehend.  Um, do you have any other feelings on the topic?
R:  Yeah.  Actually being from a university I'm in no -- I'm -- I'm studying my masters and, like, in the university I've been seeing so many athletics or -- or athletes who keep practising so much, like, you know?  Or they -- they start working right from the beginning of the day and then, like, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  Ev- every -- every other place where they go they'll have competitions too, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  Or there'll be a lot of competition for them and they need to keep up with that, and that -- this athletics it's, uh, such a kind of thing that, you know, it won't, uh, continue for the lifelong, like, you know, they might be able to win, like, up to thirty years or thirty five years, you know?
L:  [MN] Right.
R:  They'll have to get retired from that and they'll have to find a job for themselves.
L:  Right.  So, I guess if --
R:  It's a different kind of thing.
L:  -- they're making that kind of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.  If they make that kinda money then they won't have to worry about it after they retire if they, uh, invest it correctly I guess.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  At least they'll have some kind of security and, you know, that will be, oh, oh, like a fair amount of thing for whatever work they did in the first few years --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of their, uh, field or field [inaudible] actually --
L:  I guess for --
R:  -- and I -- yeah.
L:  Oh, I'm sorry.  Go ahead.
R:  You go ahead, go ahead.  I'm sorry.
L:  I guess I was saying, like, you know, I mean, they do get all kinds of endorsements, the -- the big players anyway.  I mean, I don't know much about these players that sit the bench and what their salaries are com- in comparison.  But, you know, the really high paying players, after they retire, when they're all done, they go on to do so much more where I'm sure they're still being paid close to, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- millions of dollars to endorse --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- products and continue to just kinda, you know, put themselves out there in the media --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so on, you know, for other -- I guess they encourage other players and just 'cause they're always a part of history, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- they -- they go around for a good part of the rest of their life making just as much money.  Um, as far as the striking, I guess -- I mean, I'm not someone -- I -- I like to watch sports, but I'm -- I'm not an avid follower of everything that they do in sports.  So, I don't know much about exactly the reasons for wanting to strike when they do and so on.  So ...
R:  Yeah, that's one thing.  Maybe, like, you know, rather than going for the strike they can, uh, come up with a reasonable deal with the, uh -- all the managers or whoever sponsors for them.
L:  Right.
R:  But one thing, it's not everyone, like, you know, uh, climb up all the way up to the higher level and make all the money, like, you know?
L:  Exactly.
R:  They can make it -- they can, uh -- not everyone can go out and, uh, represent their country and get a name and then get a sponsorship and all those things.
L:  Right.
R:  But if you consider some of the athletes, like, you know, who just represent a state and all, uh, they might not get the endorsement from the sponsors, you know?
L:  Exactly.
R:  So, that they, uh -- not everyone can be a -- a super athlete like --
L:  A super star.
R:  -- you know -- yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  So, that they, like, uh, uh, or probably they should, you know, uh, divide the athletes according to the, uh, level of the commitment, or like how much, uh, time they can dedicate towards this one.
L:  Right.
R:  And how -- how much they are coping out with, uh, uh, uh, present day competition and then they can -- they should fix their contract or something and, oh, probably the contract should be given something like a -- a per year basis and then keep on extending it later on.
L:  Yeah, that sounds like --
R:   Based on their performance.
L:  Right.
R:  Probably that way it -- it'll be kind of fair among both the sides, you know?
L:  Exactly.  I agree.  I -- I definitely agree.  Um ...
R:  Yeah.  But -- yeah, but see, like -- seeing the way they -- they bring up their country and aware of what they represent, uh, in what was this process --
L:  Right.
R:  -- not, oh -- i- i- it's kind of fair to, like, you know, oh, provide some kind of, uh, other facilities to them also, like probably giving some [inaudible] for their education and also other kind of, uh, things.
L:  Right.  [PAUSE]  Um, [LIPSMACK] are -- are you a follower of sports?  Do you follow much, uh, sports now?
R:  Yeah, I do.  Even, uh -- I do play quite a few games but, uh -- yeah, well, uh, usually I don't get much time but whenever I do get time I do, uh, keep -- follow the, uh, sports and all.  Uh, that's one reason -- like, you know, what makes me, uh, feel that, you know, uh, justice to be done to whatever the amount of effort and the work they do put in, like, you know, they're allowed to get up or they can't miss the practices every now and then.
L:  Right.  It's dedication.
R:  Lots of [inaudible] and their diet and then the body work, everything.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, they should be, like, you know -- if -- if they -- if they come out of it for a few days, take a break from it for a few days, they won't be, uh, really able to get back into it actually.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Uh, and throughout the year they need to keep working on un- -- or I would say, like, probably thirty five years is the last, after that they won't be able to really work on it.
L:  Right.
R:  But, uh, uh, after that, uh, at least if they can have some amount of money as a security for them for their, uh, l- la- later part of life --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, that should probably, like, you know, uh, motivate, uh, them in a better way to go out and, like, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- get those [several inaudible words] more than --
L:  I guess I can kinda see from your perspective.  You've helped me to -- to understand a little bit better, you know, why people would agree with them.  And you are right.  I mean, they do, it's a lifelong com- commitment when they are involved and every morning getting up and it takes a lot of dedication, it's not something like they can just call out of work or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I see where you're coming from, and it's more -- it mental, physical, you know?  I -- I can see all that and surely I, you know, it helps me to understand a little bit more while they get -- why they get compensated the way they do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but I don't know.  I guess it just -- th- the whole strike thing, like I said, it's -- it's not something that I follow closely when it -- if and when it -- it does happen.  So, it's one of them things I guess, I don't understand it as fully as I could.  But, um, you know, what you're saying to me definitely helps to clarify on my part, you know --
R:  Yeah.  But they're probably --
L:  -- where they're coming from.
R:  Yeah.  Actually for a person who was really experienced, what exactly a sport is, or for a person, uh, uh, uh, like, you know, what do you say, uh, was totally involved in the sports, or they are, uh, a -- a person who -- who always follows the sports, probably they should be able to, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- oh, uh, uh, get the right kind of thing about these things.
L:  Right.
R:  But I -- I understand, like, you know, probably you don't follow the sports much and all this things.
L:  Right.  I was always one who, you know, I watch -- I watch occasional sports and I've -- I've played occasional sports, but it's not something that I'm following all the little details every day.  I don't, you know, pick up the sports section and read it religiously every day.  So, like I said, some of the stuff's a little bit harder for me to comprehend.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, you know, I -- I certainly can see where your -- your point is, you know?  It's with seeing the -- the men dedicating themselves to their work and so on.
R:  Yeah, that's right.  I totally understand that.  [PAUSE]  So, well, what else?  Uh, how are things otherwise?
L:  Good, very good.  Just this whole, you know -- it's a little bit awkward I guess when you get a topic that -- that makes it a little, uh, harder to [LAUGH] -- to -- to say a whole lot on, you know?  Um ...
R:  Yeah.  But for me I guess it's, uh, kind of, like, fine because, uh, I'm kind of like involved in all the sports and I keep following all this things.
L:  Right.  And it helps --
R:  So --
L:  -- that helps a lot, you know?  I know that's where my -- my husband's always trying to keep me updated 'cause I just like to know about everything that's going on.  But, um, you know, as far as, like, striking and stuff it's not something I've seen a lot of.  So -- so, it's not something I've had a lot of experience in feeling towards.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I guess the fans -- I don't know -- I guess the fans must react, uh, the people that have season ticket and stuff like that mustn't be too excited when these guys do strike.  I'm sure that -- that kinda ruffles their feathers a little.
R:  Yeah, that's right.  There's -- there's so many people who go to every game and watch it, like, you know, there's such a lot of ardent fans, like, who keep going from one match to the other --
L:  Right.
R:  -- probably they should be a lot worried about the strike, whatever is going on between the athletes and the, uh -- this things, like, you know -- this entertainment, on all this stuff.
L:  Right.  I wonder if they're supportive of the players all around as far as
