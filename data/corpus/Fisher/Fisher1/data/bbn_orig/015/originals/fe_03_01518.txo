L:  Joan.
R:  Angela.  Angela.
L:  I guess that's all we have to do [LAUGH].
R:  Oh okay [LAUGH].  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Angela and, what's your name again.
L:  Joan.
R:  Joel?
L:  J.O.A.N.
R:  J.O.A.N., okay.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Hi, how you doing?
L:  Good, how about you?
R:  [SIGH] Just fine, um, di- -- so we're supposed to discuss the topic of, um, athletes --
L:  Recent actors --
R:  Athlete's salaries.
L:  Yes, well the strikes --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and if we think they deserve the s- -- the high salaries they make.
R:  Okay.  Okay, would you like to go first or ...?
L:  Sure.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] I think they do deserve it because obviously people are willing to pay the price for the tickets to get in there so why shouldn't they make that kind of money?
R:  That's right, I agree with you on that.  Yes, I, um -- I totally -- I agree, I agree --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because, um, I think they should make it also. 
L:  Oh --
R:  I think they work hard --
L:  Yes.
R:  --  you know, they work hard for what, um -- they work hard to be where they are and that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that goes for anything that you work hard at and you make it to that point, you deserve what you strive for.  And that's what they strive for --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I feel that they should, um, make what they, um, what they give --
L:  Well, the training is very, uh, extensive and, I think, tough training and plus, I mean, one injury [NOISE] can total ruin their career so then they're done and -- and, you know, that -- that's that.
R:  Right, yes.
L:  I mean if they're a football player and something major goes wrong with a hip or a leg or whatever they're just done with their career and have to move on so these careers can be fairly short lived.
R:  That's true, yes.  Yes, I feel that, um, that -- that -- I strongly agree with that, yes, 'cause once they're, um, they -- they do make those, um, the salaries that they do make, you know, if they were to be injured their career would be gone --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but then they would have something to fall back on in order to get up and start over.  They would have, uh, an opportunity to start over and not just to be, um, a failure, you know, failed at that industry, the sports industry, they would have opportunity to do other things in the sports industry other than just play a sport.
L:  Right.
R:  And -- and to be financially, you know, well off or in the same position that they were in once before.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They wouldn't have to change their lifestyle.  You know, their lifestyle will continue to, um, to be the same or continue to grow however they, you know, they would like for it to be.  They will still be comfortable.
L:  I would also guess that many of 'em haven't really, uh, forward in their -- their, uh, education because a lot of 'em leave college or whatever if they're good enough to play whatever sport it is, they don't finish college or whatever so a lot of 'em are really left high and dry should their career end.  You know, they're gonna have to start from scratch again if they wanna do anything other than a sports --
R:  Right.
L:  -- job.  Um --
R:  Yeah, or -- or else they could just, um, go back -- go back and pick up from where they left off --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- as far as educational wise.  Yeah, they will have opportunity to do that and, uh, and to move forward from that, you know, [inaudible].
L:  I think it's also a lot of the -- the -- especially the hard sports like football, I think that their health is [NOISE] deteriorates faster than an average person who works in an office too.  I think that their aging process is a little speedier because the -- you know, the force and whatever that they're using.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, because -- yeah, 'cause they're taking so many heavy blows in foot- -- uh, in football.  The same as they, uh, normally take in, you know, any other sports too, like boxing and baseball, you know.  Well, baseball's really not a, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a strenuous sport or a heavy sport because, you know, they're not getting hit.  But I know that sometimes swinging that bat, you know, it can hurt you if you don't, you know, if you don't stay up to standards, sort of staying in shape [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know,  yeah, but, um, yes, sports -- they do take -- they will take heavier blows in -- in football and in boxing and, um, wrestling, you know, karate -- karate sports and all that also.  [NOISE] 
L:  And another thing a lot of the, um, professional sports -- I think that it's, uh, um, hard family life too, you almost need like two homes because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, baseball they come to Florida for spring training and, you know, they're -- wherever their actual home is and then they're also all over the country playing these games and [NOISE] it's like that's a pretty tough family life.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  So, you know, something needs to compensate for that so I guess the pay is about the only [LAUGH] thing that can.
R:  Right, right.  And -- yeah, that's -- that's a good -- that's a good way to -- yes, that's a good statement because, um, yeah, they would have to, you know, two different homes, you know, 'cause -- 'cause if they have children and they have families, they can't just pick up and keep moving --
L:  Well, I saw --
R:  -- every time, you know --
L:  -- one of those, um, those, uh, race car drivers, they have like a mobile home on wheels that they take from track to track with them.
R:  [NOISE] Yes, they do, don't they?  Yeah, they usually have Winnebago.
L:  You know -- yeah, that's -- so that's the only way they can really maintain a real family life is to take their family on the road with them.  And that's quite the expense there too.
R:  Right, that's true, yes.  And then having to hire, um, to hire --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people to be with their family, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- such as, um, instructors, home schooling, you know, they have to, um, they have to be compensated for all of that.  Because they have -- they seem to have more expenses than a normal, um, blue collar worker [LAUGH].
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  They would have -- they would have more expenses than they would so, yes, I agree with you on that, you know -- on that.
L:  The other thing it really all boils down to, the sports fans are willing to pay the price [NOISE] you know, no matter how much the tickets go to the -- the stadiums are full.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, obviously the public accepts it.
R:  Yes. 
L:  Now --
R:  'Cause --
L:  -- I'm running out of things to think about [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.  Well, I can think of something --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [inaudible], okay.  Yes, I think, you know, if the sports fans, you know, do, like, um, [inaudible] and -- and any --
L:  I'm just not -- I'm just not a big sports fan --
R:  --price --
L:  -- and so it's hard for me to, like -- when I think about eighty dollars or three hundred dollars for a ticket it seems outrageous to me but, on the other hand, if it was something I liked it probably wouldn't.
R:  Well, no I love -- if I had to pay a three hundred dollar ticket just to sit at the front or sit close or whatever to see all the action I would lov-  I would, I would. [NOISE]
L:  Both my daughters are sports fans so I -- that's why I say I can understand it, you know that they would pay it and if they would pay it why shouldn't they get it.
R:  [NOISE] 'Cause I, you know, I love it, you know.  I love -- I support all [inaudible].
L:  And maybe, one day, if we have a football playing grandson, so maybe I'll really support [LAUGH] them making big money.
R:  Yes, yes.  Uh, [inaudible] the sports industry and, um, I, um, I hope, you know, even if they do strike with -- you know, they continue to, um, make their salaries -- their salary don't be cut [inaudible] still being televised over, um, satellite.
L:  Right.  
R:  And -- and even, you know, a lot of times even if you can't go out to the stadium, you gonna tune into it, you know, by television so there's not -- it's -- or by radio when you're driving 'cause I listen to it everywhere I go.  If there's an [inaudible] team playing and, you know, like the [inaudible] and they're broadcasting it, wherever I am I'm gonna turn in to it.  So, um, I -- you know, I applaud them, you know and whatever they do --
L:  Well, all those people -- when you say that, all those people make money off this too.
R:  Exactly, everyone makes money off of it and a portion goes back to the -- the athlete themselves, you know, and that's how they're getting paid.
L:  Because the TV stations make money, the radio stations make money --
R:  Precisely.
L:  -- all the vendors, you know, that --
R:  Right, they get it --
L:  -- sell the [inaudible] --
R:  -- they get it through advertising, right.
L:  So, it's more than them that gets hurt by the strike though, that -- that's the sad part, you know, when they go on strike it hurts everybody around them but --
R:  Right, yeah.  Well, I feel if they do go on strike they still should, um, continue to be compensated for what they -- they have been doing.  The same as if we were to get laid off from our job --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- is --
