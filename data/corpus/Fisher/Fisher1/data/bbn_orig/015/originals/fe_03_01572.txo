R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  [LAUGH]
R:  Hi, my name's Debbie.
L:  Hi, Debbie.  My name is Candice.  Where are --
R:  Hi, Candice.
L:  -- where are you calling from?
R:  California.
L:  Oh, me too!  Are you in southern or northern?
R:  Southern.
L:  Oh, me too!  Where are you at?
R:  Orange County.
L:  Oh, my gosh!  [LAUGH]  I am too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is the first time I've done this and had somebody who [LAUGH] lived --
R:  Wow!  [LAUGH]
L:  -- remotely close to me.
R:  I had an, eigh- uh, high school boy [LAUGH] the last time from --
L:  Oh, did you?  Too funny!
R:  -- a high school boy from the south.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my gosh!  Well, that would be fun.
R:  Oh, my gosh!  I couldn't talk to him.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that would a- actually I understand because I've got a kid who just graduated [LAUGH] and he is difficult to talk to.
R:  Where do you live?
L:  I live in [inaudible] Belinda.
R:  Oh, I'm in Custon[?].
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, that's not too far.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was down there today.  Well, let's see, our job is to talk about this, uh -- the professional athletes and the money they're paid.  What do you think?
R:  I don't follow sports, and I think that the amount they get paid is ridiculous for what they do.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I do too.  I do too.  I -- I -- I really agree with you and e- especially when you compare it to other important jobs in society that are just much more important, you know, like teachers [LAUGH] for example.
R:  Teachers make forty thousand a year and work their butts off and have to deal with bratty kids all day and ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  And, uh, because they're so poorly paid I think a lot of people they -- they have a goal of doing that, but then they leave the -- the profession and -- and the thing about the athletes is it -- I -- I don't begrudge them making --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- five hundred thousand a year even, even seven hundred and fifty a year, maybe even a million a year.  But they make so much more than that, uh, because of all the endorsements, and you add everything together, it's just -- it's phenomenal and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it makes it so expensive too, to go to the games.  It's very expensive.  Do you ever go up to s- see the Lakers?
R:  No.  Not at all.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it's, uh -- I want to say it's at least seventy bucks, um --
R:  Oh, my gosh!
L:  Yeah.  Isn't that awful?
R:  I -- I -- my sister's going next week.  She said she got tenth row seats.  I've no idea how much she paid, but ...
L:  Oh, she paid a lot!  [LAUGH]  Although the Lakers aren't having a real good year, so, maybe they're -- they're cheaper, um ...
R:  But not that cheap!  [LAUGH]
L:  No, no.  Absolutely not.  Um, [LIPSMACK] and did you follow -- well, you don't follow too much.  Is there any sport that you follow?
R:  Not at all.  I don't follow sports at all.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I'll -- to be honest with you the only reason I do is I'm married to a person who really follows sports a lot.
R:  I'm single.  I live with -- by myself.  So [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, do you?  [LAUGH]
R:  -- So --
L:  Well, [MN] --
R:  -- the sports are never on this house.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  So, you don't know -- but you -- but you, uh, uh -- were you into the Angels at all last season when they won the Worl- -- the World Series?
R:  Um, a little bit, you know?
L:  Yes.  You were aware of it, huh?
R:  Yeah.  I didn't really watch it though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm too busy.  I work all the time and I just don't have time to sit around and watch things like that on TV.
L:  Well, see, that -- that's my case too and -- and when I do have time, um, you know, maybe it's a fifteen minute thing.  And, you know, isn't that interesting?  Because the pro athletes who are making all the money are all men pretty much, other than I guess, uh, the female ice skaters probably do pretty well, but I would think it would only be a fraction of what a -- a basketball player or baseball player would make.
R:  Oh, their salaries are nowhere near what they make.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  And they --
R:  And then their pension is ridiculous.  They --
L:  Oh, I didn't know that.  Really?
R:  Oh, my gosh!  I've met -- I've met some people married to or, you know, friends of friends who are, you know, ex Rams or whatever, and they get a pension when they retire, um --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- you know, if they retire at forty they get a yearly pension that is --
L:  Huge, huh?
R:  -- huge.  A pension.  I mean, it's --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- it's not like a pension that we would get [LAUGH] in a normal job.  It's huge.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  You work until you're seventy and, you know --
R:  It's huge!
L:  -- most of its gone --
R:  You know?
L:  -- 'cause you lost it in the stock market.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's hu- -- you know, I -- I don't remember exactly -- you know, I was talking to a girl recently that I met down in Newport Beach and her husband was a -- a player, a football player, but it was huge, the amount.
L:  How, um, amazing!
R:  It was, like, more than most people l- make in a year.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  For a pension.
L:  Well, you know, I kinda -- I don't have a problem, um, with professional athletes making a real good living because I think their bodies take such an abuse and th- they -- I think they make a lot of, um, personal sacrifices, uh, but the big thing that bothers me is just when you compare what they do with other critical jobs.  I mean, like the people defending our borders, you know, uh, or the people who are the airport screeners.  I mean, where do they get those people?  [LAUGH]  And i- -- if we had better, uh, training and -- and, uh, better salary skills in some of these jobs that are so important, I mean, hospital workers are poorly paid for what they do and yet that's so important.
R:  Yeah.  They should balance in the distribution --
L:  Yeah 
R:  -- [LAUGH] of money.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  There [MN], uh, totally isn't.  I don't know what the top paying -- I -- I wonder who the top paid athlete is, if it's some [LIPSMACK], you know, like a Colby Bryant kinda guy, or if it's like a Tiger Woods?
R:  I don't know.
L:  I don't know what pays more.
R:  It's probably close I would guess with their endorsements.  Tiger has so many endorsements I would say it could even be him --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because he has huge endorsements.
L:  Yeah, he sure does.  He's a lot more visible than, uh, Colby.  Michael Jordan's still doing quite a few endorsements.
R:  Um, but -- and he just played his last game.
L:  Yeah, that's right, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  But -- but the endorsements are more than their salaries sometimes.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  If they're in that top group.  I was up one time for business and, uh, visited the Nike headquarters and it's a -- it's a huge campus on a big, big plot of land, lots of grass, they have playing fields, and all the employees are encouraged --
R:  In Portland? 
L:  Yeah.  Outside of Portland.
R:  Yeah.  I've -- I -- I went by there actually.
L:  Oh, it's so pretty.
R:  I mean, I didn't go there, but I drove by it.
L:  It's pretty cool inside.  We had a -- a complete tour of all their complex and, uh, you know, went through their board room and it was -- it was neat.  But the thing that was really interesting is, um, each floor of all these separate buildings was kind of like commemorating a particular sports figure.  And I'm sure they have all new ones now, you know, different ones?  Uh, but, uh, they really accounted so much on the celebrity endorsement, that makes such a -- a big difference in, uh, you know, how those businesses do.  I -- I -- I don't know why.  I would never listen to a movie star about anything.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I work in the film business --
L:  Or a celebrity.  Not a movie star.
R:  I know.  I work in the film business for fifteen years and -- and I don't understand why people idolize movie stars and athletes so much.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's like you would get your opinion from them!  [LAUGH]  What makes them e- experts at anything?
R:  They're not.
L:  Other than what they do.
R:  They're not at all.  But ...
L:  Yeah.  How funny.  Yeah.  So, what kind of work do you do now?
R:  Um, well, I -- I became disabled last year and so I had to quit working in the film business and so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hopefully I can get back to work.  I had an operation on my spine.
L:  Oh, I hope that's going well for you.
R:  Yeah.  I can walk now.  So, I was in a wheelchair last year for a while.  But, um ...  [LIPSMACK]  So, I'm hoping to get back to work this year.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I -- I, uh, got laid off from my company.  So, I'm looking for work too.
R:  What did you do?
L:  I was in sales and traveled quite a bit.  [COUGH]  I had eleven states that I was responsible for and was with my company for eighteen years.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, my gosh!
L:  Yeah.  I know.  It's really hard to look right now, you know?  And, you know, that's another thing, getting back to these athletes is, you know, when you think of the money they just blow.
R:  Way -- oh, my God!
L:  Yeah.  I mean, uh, it's unbelievable how they will just blow money and -- and they're always -- and, uh, movie stars I think are the same way, they're going through the bucks and buying everything they want, which then they, you know, kinda lose interest in.  My husband did a lot of work for years with different, uh, celebrities and oh, my gosh, they were -- you know, they'd work on a house, a custom home for five years and get all the furnishings, everything perfect, and then a year and a half later they would sell it.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I would never do that.  [LAUGH]
R:  But just -- just --
L:  That would be --
R:  -- not even that, the limousines and, you know, going out and blowing money in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in bars, just, you know, buying everybody in the bar, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- taking their entourage and having tabs that are just so ridiculous.
L:  Well, in gambling.  I think a number of 'em are into the gambling thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, of course, I guess they have money to lose.  So, they don't care.
R:  But the kind of money they could waste in one night I could live on in a year.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, no --
