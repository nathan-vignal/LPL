R:  Hi, I'm Joy.
L:  Hi, I'm Ed.  How are you?
R:  I'm good, how are you?
L:  Fine, thanks.
R:  Excellent.  I actually haven't flown recently, how about you?
L:  Um, I have, I flew -- I flew to Chicago two weeks ago and --
R:  Yes.
L:  And I, um, have recently flown to, ah, England.
R:  Oh, wow, that's about as often.
L:  Yeah, where -- where airport security was kind of high, but -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Did you get caught up in it for a long time or did you move pretty quickly?
L:  Um, it was actually pretty quickly I think.  Um, my wife and I left from Boston.
R:  Oh.
L:  Which was, you know -- which was obviously where the original terrorist attacks occur- came from.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And, um, so it was -- it was kind of weird going through security there and just kind of having a flash back and thinking about that, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, ah, it wasn't too bad and -- 
R:  Oh, good.
L:  And it was kind of weird, um, you know, in -- in the US you have to take your laptops out of your bags and open them up and everything for inspection.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but in England they asked you to keep your laptops in your bag.
R:  Interesting.
L:  [LAUGH] Is that kind of odd?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's very odd.
L:  And -- 
R:  I don- yeah, that doesn't make sense.
L:  Yeah, and Americans don't really trust, um, searches done, like, in other countries.  
R:  Mm.
L:  Because once you've entered the US again if you have a connecting flight, you have to go through US security again.
R:  Yeah, jeeze.
L:  Yeah, I know it's kind of over the top, but ... 
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's really irritating.  You know, I'm not [MN] looking forward to flying home here in a few weeks.
L:  Where -- where are you flying to? 
R:  Oklahoma.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, so I -- I -- ah, last time I did this, I got stuck in Chicago [LAUGH] overnight 'cause -- 
L:  Really?
R:  -- we ended up missing our flight but [MN] that -- that was just -- that was the airline's fault actually.  But, I don't know, hopefully -- I don't think I'm riding through Chicago this time so hopefully it won't be so bad. [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you -- do you generally have good luck when you fly? 
R:  Ah, yeah.  Usually I can get through security pretty easily and -- I haven't missed too many flights, so -- 
L:  Yeah, I've had a couple of times where my luggage hasn't made it with me.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, I -- I lived in Poland for a year.
R:  Okay. [NOISE]
L:  And when I came back, after being there for that long, I had a lot of luggage and, um, as I was getting off the flight, they told me -- they stopped me and said, "By the way, your luggage hasn't left Warsaw yet".
R:  [LAUGH] Jeeze.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, like, "Oh, great".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know if I'll ever see anything again.
R:  Yeah, that -- that kinda sucks.
L:  Yeah, but -- 
R:  The worst that's happened to my luggage is, um, I've got, like, the castors on my bag -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Kinda got shaved off so there's a flat spot [LAUGH] and it kinda rolls fine but it sounds horrible. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, I don't know how the heck that happened but it's kind of a nuisance.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't -- it doesn't look like it's going to be easy to replace [several inaudible words] [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  But, yeah, I don't -- I don't know, airlines are just a headache most of the time.
L:  Well, yeah, and I really don't think, I mean, I always have to take off my shoes.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I usually end up taking off my shoes.
L:  You know, and the other thing, actually what's worse than taking off my shoes is taking off my belts.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Sometimes I feel really violated when I have to do that.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I --  I try and avoid -- 
L:  Like [inaudible] or something. 
R:  It's kind of like just wearing like -- you know. 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah, I know.  It's like go to the airports and in the security line, strip down, just take off -- the last time I flew I had, like, an overcoat and then a sweater and then shoes, you know, just -- just strip down the layers and then you go through. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I -- I am kind of -- I'm very happy they've federalized airline security.
R:  Yeah, I think, um, it's more effective.
L:  Leaving it -- leaving it -- yeah, leaving it to small yahoo private companies -- 
R:  Yeah, that's kind of sketchy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I agree.  I think that that is an improvement, a step in the right direction hopefully.
L:  Although I've read that it's -- it's costing a lot more than they initially thought it would.
R:  Mm.
L:  Having the sort of security and they -- they have a glut of employees over -- they're overstaffed in some cities.
R:  Wow.
L:  By a lot and, and -- 
R:  Well, they should be able to iron or -- out the details pretty soon though. [COUGH]
L:  Yeah, but one of the troubles is they can't -- you know, fire these people so they have -- I actually think it was in Oklahoma somewhere but -- 
R:  Right.
L:  Somewhere in the mid west or -- I don't know, Kansas or Oklahoma or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They had, like, thirty people on staff.
R:  Oh, good lord. 
L:  At airports that only have like three hundred pe- passengers a day.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's kind of silly.
L:  Yeah, well, and they can't fire the people now and it's hard to relocate people so -- 
R:  Yeah, that sucks. [MN]
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.  It's just it's [inaudible] -- I -- I can't help but wonder how effective it is, you know, hopefully though, be more effective than before.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, look, obviously [LAUGH], but did you see recently they're training pilots with guns?
R:  I think that's good.
L:  Do you really? [NOISE]
R:  I really think that's good.
L:  I don't think so.
R:  I mean, you know, you can't rely on anybody else, mm, I think that's a good thing.
L:  Yeah, I'd rather just have big padded doors on it that are unable to be opened than --
R:  Well --
L:  I mean, if you -- I'm against guns in general.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I can [inaudible] -- 
L:  Especially in airplane because if you shoot out a window, they'll depressurize.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  You know.
R:  It's risky but, you know, if somebody's hijacking the plane [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, maybe a baseball bat or something, I don't know, but -- 
R:  Yeah.  Well, when they improve flights, non fatal weapons, that would be preferable, but for now, options are a little bit limited.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I don't know.  I'm just -- I don't think guns are the answer for -- almost for anything except for cops, but -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  The other thing I think is ridiculous is some of the airlines [LAUGH] for security reasons give you plastic knives instead of real knives.
R:  Oh, God, yeah, that's such a pain.
L:  Yeah, because -- because I've seen this. I saw a report on Sixty Minutes, um, about -- about, um, if you really want to make a weapon on a airplane you could out of -- out of a can -- a tin can.  You know, you could cut it in and a half and --
R:  Sure, yeah.
L:  And you can really gouge someone's neck or something -- I mean, I don't want to be gross or anything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, so getting rid of one of those flimsy little knives.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Isn't really going to -- I don't think -- 
R:  Seriously.
L:  You can't hold them by -- an airplane with a butter knife.
R:  Yeah, I would hope not. [LAUGH] That would be kinda sad.  But, yeah, I don't know.  Some of the stuff seems so -- a little insane, but ... 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess you just kinda do whatever they possibly can.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, I also read on something really funny, article about air -- airport security about -- actually it might be a good idea.  This author said, "Why don't we -- in answer to the problems is just everyone fly naked".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That would be really funny.
L:  What do you think of that?
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  That when -- 
R:  I think that would cut down on my flying.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  That way you could not hide anything.
R:  That's true, but then there's still the luggage issue.
L:  Oh, yeah, I suppose, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Naked, no luggage maybe.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Cut down on security I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Craziness, oh, my God.  I love how they make you take a drink of your water on the way through too.
L:  Oh, do they really?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I had a bottle, you know, it was either water or vodka or something clear, you know, and they, like -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "Take a drink of it", and I -- I had to go back through [LIPSMACK] and check another bag, [LIPSMACK] um, and like went through the same line and everything, and he's like, "Take a drink of it again for me please" [LAUGH] like what? 
L:  [LAUGH] really?
R:  What's changed?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's just, oh jeeze, I don't know what they think you're putting in your water but -- and, I mean, just because you take a drink of it, does that mean, you know -- 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  There's nothing in it? 
L:  I suppose that's because, I don't know, like gasoline or something for a bomb? 
R:  I don't know.
L:  Come on.  How long do we have to take about airport security? 
R:  I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Have -- have you ever done this before? 
R:  No, I haven't.  What about you?
L:  No, this is my first phone call.
R:  Yeah, me too.  It's kind of an interesting idea.
L:  Yeah.  Are you at Penn? 
R:  Yeah, I am.  What about you? 
L:  My wife is, I'm not.  I'm actually at Brown, I'm up in Rhode Island right now.
R:  Nice.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  How do you like Brown? 
L:  I like it -- I'm actually a researcher here, I'm not a student.
R:  Okay.
L:  I was a graduate student in Tone[?] last year.
R:  Right.
L:  So, yeah, I'm done.
R:  Yay.
L:  Yeah, I know, I know.  Are you a -- are you a grad student? 
R:  No, no, I'm an undergrad.  [MN] I've got a ways to go. [LAUGH]
L:  Are we supposed to talk until the telephone's cut us off? 
R:  Um, I don't know.  They said they would tell us when ten minutes are up, so I don't know if they just like cut us off or -- 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Beeper, I don't know.
L:  Maybe we should pick a different topic.
R:  Mm, such as?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] what do you think about the re- reconstruction of Iraq?
