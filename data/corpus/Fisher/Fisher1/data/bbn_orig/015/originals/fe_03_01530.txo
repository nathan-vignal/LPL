L:  Hello, my name is Lyn.
R:  Hi, my name is Linda. [LAUGH] 
L:  Hi, Linda.
R:  Um, so, did baseball players go on strike? 
L:  Maybe. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I mean, I know they have in the past but they said recently and I'm thinking well, I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You're not sure either? 
L:  I know that there's been pending strikes.  I don't know if they have actually gone on strike.  The last that I'm aware of is -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- pending strikes -- 
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- that they're still in the talks.  Um, I'm kind of lost to the world right now in, ah, -- TV is on limited and, ah, we try not to listen to the news for everything else that's going on right now.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, yeah, exactly.
R:  Okay.  Well, do you think they are over paid? 
L:  No, I think they should get about ten times the amount of money.  
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  How's that for being facetious on a Saturday. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I mean they are definitely over paid, there's no question about that.
R:  Right.
L:  But for today's world, it's what's expected.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, the strike, I can -- I -- I would not understand it if they were asking for more money and that's what the bottom line is to it if they have do with contract negotiations, um, about how long they are able to work, when they are able to work, what kind of benefits, families is included, things to that nature.  I can understand the strike [NOISE] in regards to any type of union job --  
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- but for wages, I don't really think they have a right to.
R:  Yeah, I agree.  And I think that, um, -- well, I know as a fact baseball has suffered in the last five years.  Um, they haven't had the attendance and they haven't had the ratings on TV and that kind of stuff.  So, um, [MN] I think that, ah, they definitely need to just get a reality check. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I don't know -- 
L:  I like the way that you put that.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I was actually sleeping.  My husband just woke me up and gave me the phone. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  When I put my daughter down for a nap -- 
L:  You're -- you're about to -- about ready to say, "Honey you are not gonna believe what I had a talk about".
R:  Oh, it's -- no, this one is easier than the last two I had so anyway.
L:  But is -- is your husband more into sports that he'd be surprised by you just speaking on this topic? 
R:  Um, he's into football.  I don't think any of us are into baseball though.
L:  You know, the general topic that we are given is in regards to professional athletes -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- um, striking --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and the first thing that comes to your mind and the first thing that comes to my mind is baseball.
R:  Right.
L:  So I guess that's -- that is what -- what the news is --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in regards to baseball players and I read -- you know, in history that I am aware of I cannot recall anything, um, to my knowledge, of hearing about any other players besides baseball players striking -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I don't know where that comes from any different in regards to basketball or football, hockey or -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- any of the other sports.
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I think you're right.  I mean, I -- I certainly don't hear about professional ice skaters striking.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Ah, um, I don't know, I mean, unless it's like an injury thing, if they want to get paid out, if, you know, they get injured while playing baseball, but, I don't know, it doesn't seem like, um, that's as rough of a sport as some of the other ones you just mentioned, especially hockey or football, so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yet you would think in regards to, ah, people getting this type of pay and wanting to strike for it, you would think something -- you know, using, ah, [MN] an example of a -- of an ice skater, you know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- they would probably say the same thing, you know, "Why can't -- why are we not getting paid as much as somebody else is getting paid. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, we're doing as much as what they are, we are competing against other people, we are on national television, we bring, you know, audiences, you know, live to our events." 
R:  Right. 
L:  Um, -- 
R:  And in terms of if you wanted to -- I mean, I -- I follow ice skating quite extensively and I know that they are usually in the top three of viewership, you know, when they do have the televised TV events and ice skaters aren't getting near the money that some of these basket- or baseball players are getting, you know, and it's -- there is no union, there is no -- um, you know,  it's not a team per se, it's all individual athletes but, yeah, if you want to talk about how much revenue they bring to the sponsors and things like that, especially, you know, the ice skaters, there's no comparison.  But, I mean, they are still paid well for what they do. [LAUGH] I don't think any ice skaters are starving. [LAUGH] But, um, -- 
L:  Some of them look like it though.
R:  That's true [LAUGH] that's true.  But, I [LAUGH] -- you know, I'm big -- you know, I -- I'm trying to think of the author, but -- oh, Christine Brennan writes, ah, books about, you know, how, um, viewership and, um, how left people are reading newspapers and she thinks that, ah, -- that, um, -- that newspapers should go after women and -- and report on women's sports and, you know, try to get that to increase newspaper readership and -- because that's one of the things that women typically like to watch. [LAUGH] I don't know, but, you know, at least in Denver here ice skating is usually covered on page sixty eight, you know, [LAUGH] it's not a headliner so I don't know. But, yeah, I haven't heard of any other strikes.  Um, I like watching baseball but I -- I guess I just tend to not think about how much money they are paid but I have two young children so we don't really get to the ball park too frequently. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't -- I don't think for fans I don't think it's their main concern. 
R:  Mhm, right.
L:  They are aware of it, there's nothing -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- they can change whether they want to or whether they can, it's the same thing, with, um, with professional, um, athletes of what they get paid compared -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to what people get paid in the entertainment industry -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the bulk of it is -- is just unbelievable amounts of money in comparison to what they expect people to live in, you know, on a minimum wage.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, which is, you know, not nearly possible on today's salaries that aren't minimum wage --
R:  Mhm.
L:  --  aren't any different to what think were ten, fifteen years ago and I think it's the same thing when somebody gets in front of a TV or, ah, goes to a movie theatre and sits there and they don't look at the -- [LIPSMACK] the movie of a television show and say "Hey, look at that actor --"  
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- you know, they are getting paid X amount of millions of dollars for doing this", I don't even think the thought goes through their minds.
R:  That's -- that's -- 
L:  They're aware of it.
R:  That's a valid point.  I never thought of it li- you know, because you want to go see Julia Roberts maybe even though she is getting twenty million per movie [LAUGH] they are probably, you know, making more than -- than some of the athletes, that is a good point.
L:  But --
R:  What -- what burdens me is when they build a new stadium and then they -- like in Denver they built a new stadium and then they tax people.  I don't even live in the Denver county and we have to pay taxes on the stupid new stadium that -- you know, I'm from California, I don't even care about these Denver teams, you know [LAUGH] so that's how that, you know, that kind of thing drives me crazy when you don't even think you'll, you know, be participating and what is going to go on in that stadium and you are getting taxed for it, I don't agree with that because these are definitely private teams, it's not a public Olympic type thing or, you know, I don't know.
L:  And then whose name is on it?
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it's not -- you know, it's not Denver stadium.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  You know, if it was, you know, city, county, some type of government you would -- you would think otherwise -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, you know, who is paying for the stadium and the salaries they are getting paid to play in there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then they want the people to pay for where they are playing at inclusive with the salaries that they are receiving -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and the salary that you are receiving isn't even close to it.
R:  And its poors field, yes, exactly. [LAUGH]  
L:  I think -- 
R:  What area of the country are you in? 
L:  I am from where you were from. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you are from California, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Northern or southern? 
L:  Southern.
R:  Okay, 'cause I know that Packbell Stadium in California, I don't know if they were taxed for that but --  
L:  But is it still Packbell because Packbell is now SBC. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh okay, yeah, I -- I know that's a --
L:  I just got my first phone bill with the new SBC name on it.
R:  SBC? 
L:  SBC, yeah. 
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  Are you near -- near Santa Barbara? 
L:  No, no, no, no, Packbell officially changed their name.
R:  Oh, I know, but where in Southern California are you? 
L:  Oh, LA.
R:  Oh, LA, okay.   
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I went to college in Santa Barbara so. [MN]
L:  But, um, --
R:  Well, um -- 
L:  I think back on the subject with the strikes in itself, I think bottom line to it is what are they striking for. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Then I think that's where -- myself personally, where my feelings come, whether I agree with what they are doing or I don't.
R:  Yeah, and the economy is so poor that I think that you just have to say [LAUGH]"Come on, you know, you should be very happy that you even have a job". [LAUGH] You know, all the engineers that are out of work and, you know, for certainly less money than these players, I don't know, it's terrible, I don't know. 
L:  But is the bottom line to the strike, are they striking for money or are they striking for benefits?  I mean, I don't even know if it's -- if it's union or not.  Anybody who -- if it is union they held the right for their contract negotiations and if they don't agree it's part of being in a union, no matter what type of profession, to be able to strike.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But if the bottom line for professional athletes for a strike is more money --  
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Sorry, you don't have me agree with them.
R:  Yeah, no, I agree, my husband's in a union, um, but at the same time they get to vote and [LAUGH] they should be able to -- if it is, you know -- if they are in a union and they can vote, you know,  Some of them can just sit there and try to convince the other people, come on, just vote, you know, to get the pla- --
