R:  I'm Michael Rosenthal[?].  I go to the University of Texas.
L:  Oh, hi.  I'm Angie.  I'm at Penn.
R:  Penn State?
L:  Pardon?
R:  Oh, where are you from?
L:  Oh, Penn, University of Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, my friend goes there.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Great.
R:  So, what's our -- our topic of the day is airlines I guess.
L:  Yeah, and security.
R:  So, do you find it more secure?
L:  Um, I guess so.  I guess I -- I've traveled since nine eleven and it's, you know, um, I guess longer lines and I've been stopped more to have them check my luggage.  How 'bout you?
R:  I don't know.  It seems to be more like face [LAUGH], they make you -- do it to make you feel better, but I haven't felt an increase in security honestly.
L:  Oh, I see what you're saying, yeah.  Like in terms of actual security?
R:  Yeah.  I -- I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've seen the actual security guy going and checking old grandmas and things and they're checking me for, like, carrying on knives or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  No.  But unfortunately [NOISE] I don't see them, uh, making a real change in the way they do things.
L:  Right.
R:  Though I'd like that they're now scanning, like, act- luggage that goes in the holds [SIGH] 'cause that's kind of important.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Um, but they have been doing a lot of profiling, which is disturbing, um ...
R:  Well, it -- the question is profiling disturbing or is it necessary?
L:  Yeah.
R:  There -- there's a kind of a balance.  Of course, you could say profiling is wrong, but anything -- the first time you ever do anything for a criminal is to profile.
L:  Yeah.  Um, though I don't think it's -- I think it's -- I don't think it's necessary, I find it a tad racist.  When they pull aside, um -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when they say there's random checks, but really they're pulling aside all the Middle Eastern men. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um, and also my friend, she was, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, all international students, you know, non US citizens --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are, um -- you know, have no rights now, and I had a friend who was coming from Korea or something and she was strip searched and, um, like, hit and stuff and she just had no, um, legal rights.  They said that she couldn't do anything abut it and ...
R:  That's pretty bad.
L:  Yeah.  So, I think right now she's taking legal action and, um, hopefully something can happen.  But it -- it's just a disgrace because she has no rights as a -- as a non US citizen.  So, um ...
R:  Well, I'm sure that'd go through the courts.  My Dad back in the day also had problems like that.  But I -- I think it's somewhat expected.  He was a Russian.  So since he had the FBI look at him --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in the eighties -- and they act- -- they strip searched him.  So, basically what he did, he started dressing better.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [MN]  That's true.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I always -- I'm always scared for my father, who is Philippino, but he has a -- his wife is white, so I think he's -- he'll be -- you know, he doesn't get harassed or anything like other Asians might.  So ...
R:  Well, unless you're sheik.  [LAUGH]
L:  What's that?
R:  I feel sorry for the sheiks.
L:  Ye- --
R:  No one -- no one knows what a sheikh is.
L:  Oh, sheiks, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's true.  And, um, just South Asians too.  People don't understand, um, yeah, the differences and so forth.
R:  No.  I -- I don't know.  I -- I can't say I -- I like racial profiling [LAUGH], but for some reason I care for it when I'm flying on an airplane.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Unfortunately.  Because when you think about it, you know, where -- where are us- -- all the attackers coming -- come?  They're coming from one region.  So, it's somewhat understandable that they would do something like that.  When it comes with the air- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when it comes to airlines because it seems to be like a trend with these types of things.
L:  Right.  I know what you're saying.  I mean ... you know --
R:  You know?
L:  -- it makes -- it makes some sense that they would -- that they would do that, and mostly because of how we handle domestic issues.  So, we do a lot of racial profiling with African Americans.
R:  [LAUGH] I think ...
L:  [LAUGH] And I just can't just justify that.  I think that's so wrong.  
R:  But i- ironically enough, you know, a lot of African Americans are probably racial profiling of Arabs at the airport.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...  Of course, you know, like, I -- it -- it depends on what you racially profile for.  There's -- there's stupid racial profiling and smart racial profiling.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, when -- when you're actually like, okay, you know, you've got, like, a black guy, fine, you know, they -- they always arrest them for drug charges.  That's stupid.  That's like, a waste of time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's r- -- that's not equitable 'cause like, you're always ...  But, you know, when you have like airplanes, fine.  Where are the m- majority of the attackers coming from?  Well, they're coming from Saudi Arabia.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Re- regardless of everyone not from Saudi Arabia is a criminal they should at least be put under additional scrutiny.
L:  Yeah.  I don't [LIPSMACK] -- sometimes I think -- well, remember that case where -- I think it was in Georgia or Florida or something when there were, um, a couple, I think they were South Asian or of Middle Eastern descent, and they were sitting in a restaurant and then this white lady overheard them saying things?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And they weren't even saying any of that stuff, but she just made this huge leap, like you -- you've got to hear what you wanna hear, or you think you're hearing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, about like -- they were like, bringing a car down or something like that, and they'd stopped the highway and everyone freaked out and -- I think that when --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- racial profiling happens that -- that's morally -- more so of cases when the government tells us to take, um -- you know, for us to be on the watch and, you know, be active, you know, citizens and so forth --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that we make big mistakes.
R:  Well, I -- i- I don't know.  I can't judge the whole country by lit- little old ladies in Georgia --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because they've -- they've been like that before [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and after.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think --
L:  But I -- don't you feel that the administration is telling us all, citizens --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to be vigilant and, um, you know --
R:  Pr -- pr -- 
L:  -- report -- report, um, unusual behavior and so forth, that makes all of us sort of, um --
R:  Paranoid.
L:  -- paranoid and feel like we -- we have the right or the power to, you know, racial profile ourselves, and we get these poor medical students in all this trouble and they have to, you know, transfer universities and stuff?
R:  [MN] Yeah.  Well, m- most of the public are stupid, so I don't want them doing their own work.
L:  Yeah.  I think i- --
R:  But I -- I prefer that the police, huh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, also get -- are able to do their job.
L:  Yeah.  Do you remember that -- there's another story about I think he, um -- this -- these white people on the airplane saw this, um, person sitting down, um, and they thought he was of Middle Eastern descent and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he was reading -- do you remember that?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And he was -- he was reading, you know, like, "Oh, you know, he's reading Arabic", and "Oh, no", and it turned out he was, like, reading Chinese or something and he was, um, half, um, African American, half white.  Do you remember that?  Did you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I remember that.  Well, people are somewhat paranoid, which is to be expected.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You -- you --
L:  But then -- and I also think that administration drives us to be paranoid.
R:  Well, that's Bush.  His administration drives everybody to be paranoid.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We -- we have terror alerts.  I -- I think of them more as surfing alerts.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  When- whenever it's red I don't go surfing.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, and when it's green you know, okay, gotta be careful, gotta go caution in the wind.
L:  Right.
R:  It's not like it affects me or something.  You go to like, our university, oh, no, they put extra guards in the guard booth to seven o'clock and it really stuffs terrorists!
L:  Yeah.
R:   'Cause the t- -- the terrorists go through, ask the guard for directions before blowing themself up.
L:  Hm.
R:  [LAUGH] Or killing people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, like logically, okay, you know, this -- this makes me feel better.  When you think about it, it doesn't matter.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Of course, you know, now we take off our shoes at the airport.  Because, I mean, they couldn't catch a guy that had a bomb in his [LAUGH] shoe.
L:  Right, sure.
R:  Of course, w- would you profile that guy, he looked kinda cr- -- if I saw that guy I would've -- I would stop him 'cause he looks crazy to me.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah, that's hard.  It's such a -- yeah.  I guess if it's on the basis of someone looking creepy.  [LAUGH]  I mean, like, some type of -- like someone looking suspicious or something rather than by the color of his or her skin.
R:  See, it's -- it's hard to tell what -- who looks suspicious or not.  Everyone has a different definition of suspicious.
L:  Right.  I know.
R:  You know, I -- I couldn't care a less about someone doing drugs or what not, they're not going around killing everybody usually.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, when it gets to me being blown up on airplanes I'm paranoid.
L:  So, have you flown since nine eleven?
R:  I fly all the time, which makes me like, very unhappy to fly.
L:  Oh, really?  So, you get a little, um --
R:  Everyone gets para- --
L:  -- anxious?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, everyone gets paranoid when they fly.  Like, uh, before I had f- -- a fear of flying 'cause I, like, had bad experiences with airplanes.  You know, they drop a thousand feet and you think you're gonna die.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's, like, great!  It makes you feel real good the -- and then you go.  You didn't have to [inaudible] like [several inaudible words], terrorists with jack knives trying to kill everybody.
L:  Yeah.
R:  All you had to deal with some mechanical failure.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Um, yeah, I've flown like, maybe six times since nine eleven.  Or, no, maybe more than that.  Oh, no, no.  I flew -- yeah, I flew like, probably fifteen, twenty times or something, 'cause I do a lot of traveling and, um, I've -- I don't know why, I -- I'm not like, scared or anything and I -- actually what I do is I, um, make sure that the white people aren't like [LAUGH] -- aren't like, harassing the people of Middle Eastern descent while they're in the airport.
R:  [NOISE] Huh.  I don't think I've ever noticed that.  America's pretty liberal.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, in general unless you go to somewhere in the deep south [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R: -- [MN] and then you get -- which I lived --
L:  Is Texas the deep south?
R:  Well, for parts of it, it is.  If you live in a major city it's not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If you live in Austin or Houston it's not a big deal.  You have to go to the Boonies[?] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LAUGH] that -- that accounts for a lot of the south, you know, you go to Georgia.  Go to like, out there you have -- you still have plantation country.
L:  Yeah.  I went to -- I was Atla- -- in Atlanta the other month and it was really nice there.  I was actually surprised, because I was a little scared --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I thought it was the south or something.  But it was actually pretty nice.
R:  Yeah, the south is decent as long as you avoid [SIGH] small towns or the -- where -- there still are quite a few small towns where there's like, five hundred people and everyone knows each other and they got the rumors or what not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  When you're living somewhere like Houston there's millions of people, not a big deal. [NOISE]
L:  What -- what's the climate like out
