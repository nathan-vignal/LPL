R:  Uh, this is Grant.
L:  Hey, this is Neil.  [COUGH]
R:  [COUGH]
L:  All right.  So, the strikes by professional athletes.  
R:  Uh, huh!
L:  Um ...
R:  Ridiculous!
L:  Ha, I guess.  I'm a big sports fan.  So, I can't live without my sports but, yeah, I think it's kind of -- I think it's kinda silly, like, get paid a lot of money to just have fun, you know.  [LAUGH]  So ...
R:  Exactly.  It's a tremendous, uh, salary that they do bring in and, you know, I mean, it's -- it's basically the entertainment industry.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's pretty much entertainment.  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, you know, it's -- it's -- it's out of the realm of normal sports.  So, it now becomes -- you know, when you go pro it becomes, uh, uh, entertainment, you know, show business.  So, um --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- it's like movie stars, the better -- better stars command higher pay for their movies and, uh, you know -- and the rest.  But, uh, you know, going on strike [LAUGH] --
L:  Ha.
R:  -- when you're getting how many million dollars a year? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I, mean, maybe -- maybe the -- maybe the underpaid -- I -- I don't know if there is such a thing as an underpaid athlete 'cause I -- I think -- I've -- I've seen, like, out of the -- the four major sports in -- in the United States, uh, hockey, baseball, basketball, you know, I think -- I think they have pretty high minimum salaries.  So [LAUGH], I don't think they have --
R:  Well, ab- absolutely.
L:  -- to complain.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  They've got a --
L:  So ...
R:  -- they've got a very -- very, uh -- very liveable salary even -- even if -- you know, the guys that are just starting out.  
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, I don't -- I don't understand why they would, uh -- why they would even consider striking.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I mean, I really don't know what I'd do -- I mean, I hate when -- I hate when -- like, I remember last -- last season base- -- in baseball, I mean, they were about to strike and [COUGH] -- I don't know it seems kinda ridiculous I guess.  Um, I don't know even what the terms were to that strike.  So, it was -- it was something like they're being taxed too much or -- I don't know.  What was it?  Do you know what it was?
R:  Well, they just didn't like the -- being fined and penalized [LAUGH]!
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And they wanted more money.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  That's what it all comes right back to I guess.  I mean --
R:  Yeah, yeah.  But, you know, it, uh -- you know, like football players, you know, they -- they get -- they get fined for certain violations they commit but, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, those guys are -- are hauling down some big bucks and, you know, well, you know, if you're gonna mess around with the -- with -- in the big league you -- you can expect to have big fines with big, uh, salaries.  So, what -- you know, what do you want?
L:  I mean, I guess that's the absurdity[?].  They're breaking the rules and they're playing in front of millions of people, like, on national TV.  I think -- I think they should have some sort of [SIGH] -- a certain set of rules like, you know, behavior that they should abide by I guess.  If they're gonna p- get paid that much money and -- and then misbehave, act -- act, you know, without class on the field.  So, I guess it's -- it's -- I guess those rules are there for a reason I guess.  Huh.
R:  Yeah.  Maybe they got the idea to strike because, uh, all these, uh [COUGH] -- all the fields are -- are -- you know, naming rights are being sold to big corporations --
L:  Oh, the sponsorship --
R:  -- so, they figure well, what the heck, you know?
L:  -- oh, God.  Huh.
R:  Yeah.  They get -- they get the employee mentality and decide that they can go on strike, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Ugh.
R:  But, yeah, how many stadiums do you know, uh, you know?  There are like -- well, here in Denver, you know, uh, Broncos Mile High Stadium, well, that's no more, that's now called Invesco Field.  So ...
L:  Invesco Fields, yeah.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  So, uh, you know, wh- what can you say?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I -- I liked the old Mile High -- keep -- they kept the old High name.  But, yeah, I -- I remember that debate going on and --
R:  Yeah.  Well ... [COUGH]
L:  -- there's such a lot of sponsorship now.  I mean, that's what pays for their salaries and I -- I guess high ticket prices [MN].  Five dollar hotdogs and, huh -- and sponsorship.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess that's what -- that's what keeps them in, [LAUGH] you know, professional sports.
R:  Well -- well, yeah.  Well, the -- the club gets a -- a cut of their -- of everything, all concession sales and everything basically that goes on, um, you know, in the -- in the field, uh, including, you know, tickets and stuff like that, but --
L:  Definitely, yes.
R:  -- but, uh, you know, the players I think it's just a matter of greed, um --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- you know?  A lot of them have a good lifespan, you know, as far as, uh, their playing ability.  They can go on for ten years and still -- you know, still perform.  Others -- others are kinda short term and maybe they're -- they're figuring they need to make, uh, you know, three lifetimes' worth of, uh -- worth of salary.  So, you know, in twenty years when they retire [LAUGH] --
L:  Hm.  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, they could be like [COUGH] -- like John Elway[?] and buy all the oil dealerships in town and stuff.
L:  Yeah.  That's right.  Here he is -- he has a pretty big cu- cut in the auto deal- -- auto industry in Denver.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, he's -- he's got his fingers in just about every manufacturer's dealership.
L:  Wow!  [LAUGH]
R:  He's got -- got a -- he's got a John Elway, uh, dealer for every make of car just about.
L:  Wow!  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  And he's --
R:  And he's not hur- -- he's not hurting at all.  [LAUGH]
L:  H- I guess he might be missing football, but he's not missing the money.  [LAUGH]
R:  No, no --
L:  Maybe not.
R:  -- he's got other stuff that's doing it for him.  So ... [COUGH]
L:  I mean -- I mean, sometimes you have these players that say they're -- they're not about money and they're not -- they're just about having fun, playing the game, ha, winning, ha.  But then -- but then you take their salary away, I don't know how -- how many of them will stick around for that -- with that, ha --
R:  Yeah.
L: -- with that view I guess.  I mean ...
R:  Yeah, but -- but, you know, as far as going on strike, that kinda takes the -- you know, the sportingness out of sports.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I think so.  I think definitely -- I mean, this is -- I mean, as -- as big -- I mean, I'm -- I'm a big fan.  I was just finishing watching the NBA playoffs right now and this --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just, you know, like you have these guys, ha -- they wouldn't be there if they weren't getting paid.  I don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how many -- how many hundreds of thousands of dollars per game.  Ha.  So ...
R:  Well, I don't, uh -- I'm not a big sports fan unless, of course, uh, the Broncos are actually doing something, or the Nuggets are doing something.  But, uh [COUGH], this time around nah.  [LAUGH]
L:  No, I know.  [LAUGH]
R:  But, uh --
L:  Broncos, I mean, they usually --
R:  Now, the Av- --
L:  -- they usually ...
R:  Now, the Avalanches is a different story, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's a -- they're all right.  But, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, these other guys I don't know.
L:  They've been go- yeah, they've been good for a while.  Ha.
R:  Yeah.  [COUGH]  So, that's always -- that's always a good thing to watch.  But, nah, we're one of those people that stay glued to the TV set.  But -- but, uh, you know, as -- you know, I just -- I just can't understand what they do or talk about.  When they went on strike that was just -- that was just beyond me.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I didn't think they could go on strike.
L:  [MN]
R:  You know, why -- why would they go on strike, you know?  Is there such thing as a union?  Do they have a players union --
L:  I g- there is -- there is --
R:  -- that calls them to go on strike?
L: -- Yeah.  There is a union I think.  I mean, um, I know there's the Players Association, I think that's a union.  But [LAUGH], I mean, honestly they're really not I guess -- I mean, they might be helping out the economy and -- and good cities but, you know, like, they're not -- they're not going down in the coalmines or -- or in the steel factories, you know, doing some really dangerous stuff I guess.  So, I don't know what they have --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- to argue about right there.  Ha.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And they say their job is dangerous!  Maybe -- I mean, maybe you play baseball, ha, you can get hit by a ball or something.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Like Roger Clements.
R:  Yeah.  Well, the safety equipment they have now is -- is so much better than it was twenty years ago.  So --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- [COUGH] you know, I mean --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- they -- and they got -- they got, uh, you know, all kinds of -- all kinds of, uh, perks and bennies on the side and -- and, you know, they're -- they can sign for, you know, various products and endorse- -dorsements and, you know, they get --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Ha.
R:  -- money coming in from all -- all these manufacturers, you know, for endorsing their products and stuff like that.  So, you know, it ...
L:  Well, look at Michael Jordan!  Ha.  
R:  Exactly.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, and -- and the rest of them too, you know?  And -- and for ... so, for a -- for a professional athlete to go on strike is -- is kinda silly.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I've -- i- i- [COUGH] -- I really don't see ... especially baseball.  Baseball is supposed to be the American pastime and then -- and then you have these guys just -- just throwing it all away I guess.  I mean, that -- that just made -- this -- this past fall it just made me -- it just made me sad that -- to see that these baseball players, you know, like they say it's an Ameri- an American sport and, you know, it's about the fans, not about -- not about -- not about the money or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not about the businesses, but it -- it just ended up being that way I guess --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about the money.
R:  Right on!
L:  And this has disappointed me.  I mean, I thought a lot of these guys that -- that would be against striking, that would just like to play without money and, I mean, they were advocating the strike.  So, I mean [COUGH], you've got Alex Rodriguez here in Texas, ha, getting paid a quarter of billion dollars and he says it's not about the money, but [LAUGH] it's hard to believe.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  Hard to believe.
R:  Or ... yeah.  It's not about the money!  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I -- yeah.  It -- it is hard to believe.  [COUGH]  You know, if I was -- if I was getting that much I'd, you know -- I don't know if I could say that.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm a little too honest.  [COUGH]
L:  I mean, maybe -- maybe he was -- he's good, but not that good.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not -- not for a quarter of a billion.  There's -- there's a lot more important people in this world and they don't get paid that much, they don't get the recognition.  So, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's -- that just shows how dominated by business --
R:  Well, uh, yeah.  Exactly.
L:  -- sports really is.  You go to the stadium and they have all these advertisements and, ha -- and such.
R:  Yeah, well, maybe they -- maybe they're -- they're uh, developing the attitude of these, uh [COUGH], CEOs and the rest of these -- these huge companies that -- that, uh, fleece the stockholders and take off with all the cash, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, ha.  Remember the Enron thing in Houston?
R:  Well, exactly, yeah.  That kinda stuff.
L:  Enron Field.  Ha.  That wasn't even their money, you know [LAUGH], they didn't have the money to back it up, but they -- they got the rights to the stadium, ha, somehow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Somehow.
L:  That's what funny.
R:  Well, they did, huh.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  [COUGH]
L:  That's a strange view.  That's a different topic I guess.  [LAUGH]  But ...
R:  Yeah.  Well, I don't know what they -- this -- this, uh, uh -- the subject they have us talking about.  There's only so much you can say about it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  Ha.  I guess.
R:  You can ex- -- you can express an opinion and that's -- you know, that's, uh -- that's it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You could beat it to death also.  But -- but, uh --
