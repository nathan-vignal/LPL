L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, well, our topics gonna be, uh ... nine eleventh --
L:  What significant changes or something?
R:  Y- exactly.
L:  Okay.
R:  If -- all right, if you'd like to go first you can.
L:  Uh, okay.  Uh, what is this -- I guess it's supposed to be like, i- in, um, in relation to it?  Because significant changes have changed but I don't think it's because of September eleventh, but I guess it has to pertain to it?
R:  Exactly.
L:  Hm.  Well let's see.
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, I just graduated college and --
R:  Oh wow, okay.
L:  Yeah, and, uh, it's really hard to find a job now, so maybe that's, um, affected it a way.
R:  Economics downfall.
L:  Yeah, it's really hard.
R:  Right, the economic downfall.  Okay.  Right.  Well, um, I'm actually still in high school and, um [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, like, pertaining to college like, I was actually going to be a business major although since nine eleven I don't know how long it's gonna -- the whole economic downfall is gonna extend 'til.  Like, how long our economy is gonna be low.  Like, my father, he's like, struggling with his business.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So it seems like, a -- he's like, independent business owner of convenience stores and our money has been like, we've been in debt basically, and so I don't know which career path to choose.  And so what do -- what did you just graduate, uh, what was your major?
L:  Uh, I graduated in, um, broadcasting.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah, in television and radio writing and broadcast journalism.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  Yeah, where do you live?
R:  I actually live in Dallas.
L:  Oh okay, so do I.  All right, good.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh you do?
L:  Yeah, I do.  I -- I'm -- I'm on seventy five right now, I'm driving, it's trafficky.
R:  Oh, sounds good, that's okay! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm at my house.  Okay.  And, um --
L:  I guess they, um, they match us up on where our locations are.
R:  Yeah, I'm bet, I bet, yeah.  Well actually, I heard the -- I heard about this from, um, uh, [LIPSMACK] my friend.  He was like, "Yeah, you can -- it's like an incentive, you get like, money by doing this".  I was like "Oh --"
L:  Yeah, you get ten bucks.
R:  Yeah, exactly!
L:  But listen, they're gonna listen to us talk and they'll be like, "Okay, they're not talking about our subject, so we just --"
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, um, let's see, what am I doing now, okay, right now, since I can't find a job after college because the economy is so bad, I, uh, am doing this crappy administrative job.  I'm a college graduate, dammit, and I [LAUGH] should have a better job than this, but I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I'm at a modeling agency and an advertising agency and sit here and do work that monkeys can do.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's pretty like, "Type this up --"
R:  Oh wow.
L:  "-- print this out, blah blah blah", you [inaudible] education to do anything!  It's so hard.
R:  Yeah?  Oh my gosh.  Uh, but it's so ridiculous because, um, well, you know, my whole family has been struggling with this.  My sister, she's twenty five and, um, she graduated as well like, a year ago.
L:  Uh.
R:  And she actually got laid off her job.
L:  Yeah, a lotta people gotten laid off.
R:  Yeah.
L:  See, I don't [several inaudible words] found a job.  I'm twenty one, so I'm ... and I'm, uh --
R:  You, you're twenty one?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And you haven't found a job.  Wow, that's sucks.  [several inaudible words].  But, um --
L:  Yeah, like, I graduated college early, like, I graduated in three and a half years, thinking that, you know, I'm gonna like, have a career like, you know, uh, no, totally not!
R:  Oh man.
L:  I got nothing!
R:  That's crazy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's -- that's bad.
L:  So, um, and so you are in Dallas, Dallas?
R:  Yeah, a suburb of Dallas.
L:  Are you going --
R:  Uh, Irving.
L:  Oh, okay, I live in Garland.
R:  Like, um, in, uh, in the suburbs and everything, I mean [NOISE], you know, [MN] since we looked at our lives like -- like Americans, basically, we live it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so mundanely and we don't really pay attention to everything that's been going on.  It's like, it's kinda hard to realize for myself actually, a high school student --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- rather than experiencing it, it's kind of hard.  But since my father has experienced it, like, I kinda feel where he's com- -- do you have like, any family situations like that?
L:  Well no, I don't -- I don't really have any family situation.  My parents are almost retired and, I mean --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And so it's like, [LIPSMACK] yeah, yeah, l- like my parents have their money but I mean, I -- I need to make money for myself.  Uh, it was like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and next week I'm going to go to New York, and I can't wait to go to New York because, um, I'm gonna go to like, Ground Zero, and I wanna see that and ...
R:  That's cool. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Like, so, yeah.  On the [inaudible] side I'm going to New York next week and it's -- it's cool.  So I'm gonna go do that, so I guess that has something to do with our -- our topic, is me going to New York! [LAUGH]
R:  I guess! [LAUGH]  So, um, in addition to nine eleven, um, the whole [LIPSMACK] -- what else comes in play?  The race issue.  Like, uh, you know, well, I'm actually, uh, uh, Indian, and --
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, I'm, um, I'm Chinese --
R:  Oh you are?
L:  -- and Hawaiian.  Yes.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, well, um, some people kinda mistaken me for a Muslim.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know?  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're like, in school, in high school, like, uh, one guy came up to me and was like, you know, they -- they just make these smart comments and stuff like -- this was last year though, but this -- this wasn't it -- it was just that week of chaotic, you know, like everyone was --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like, you know, worried.  And some guy came up to me and kind of threatened me, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like, in the high school.  Inside high school.
L:  Well, people are ignorant.  I mean, you know, it's just like --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- even if you in high school, uh, it's like, well then you'll learn, when people get out, people are just as stupid.
R:  Right.
L:  But, I mean, if you go to college and then, you know, you won't stay [inaudible], uh, face that as much, like, ignorant people.  But there are still stupid people out there but yeah, it's scar- --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I mean, it sucks.  Like, I -- I know.
R:  Were you, um, yeah, were you involved in anything in, uh, college, for this?  For this deal, for this whole nine eleven thing?
L:  Oh.  Well, um, let's see.  Well, [MN], do you remember what -- how, like, that day?  Because I remember -- well, I was in -- I was in, uh, class.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And this girl came in late and she said -- and she was talking to her professor, she said, "Hey, some -- someone ran a plane into the Empire -- the, um, the World Trade Centers" and everyone --
R:  Right.
L:  -- was like, "What?"  We go, "What are you talking about?"  We all thought she was just stupid and we didn't know what she was talking about.  We were like, "Whatever, shut up".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It was eight o'clock in the morning, it was so early.  And then -- then we go out like, everyone in the campus was like all looking on -- looking at, um, at TVs and everyone was really dismal.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  I was like, "Oh wow".
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I didn't know that that day would be like, a -- but everyone was like, "That's so stupid, what's that about!" you know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, but, yeah, it [MN] --
R:  Ooh, it was -- yeah, it was such a shock.  That's exactly what happened to me.  Actually, our teacher came up to us and she was crying 'cause, uh, her daughter was in New York --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and it's like, it's affected so many people.  But, if you don't know a person there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then I don't know if it actually can affect you in any way, you know?
L:  Well, it's affected -- i- it affects us in like, small little ways, uh, like, you know, we don't think about it, but it actually does.  Like, what with the, um, you know, with the job situation and, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and more people are going to school or going back to school now because it's hard --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- that, um, because, uh, because no one can find a job, so they're like, "Well, I might as well just go back to school".  And so a lot of people are going back to school.  I have a lot of friends that -- that are graduating but are just going to go to graduate school.  And it's just like, 'cause you can't find a job out there so you're like, "I'll just go back".  So ...
R:  Exactly.
L:  [several inaudible words], huh.
R:  Yeah, like, um, I actually take, uh, night classes at community college and there's been so many more like, older and older, you know, percentage of people that their response was like, at the beginning of the year, "Why did you come back to school?" everyone, like, "Oh, because I'm not finding like, any job in my field" or "I got laid off" or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  "Something happened".  You know?  And it's just, man this just sucks, it sucks ass! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you'll find -- like, I mean, even in community -- but in community college you'll find older people in there anywhere, and after work or -- but yeah, I -- I'm doing the same thing, I just -- I just have this crappy administrative, secretary job that I have a degree, but it's hard to do anything, 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- especially what I'm doing, 'cause I -- I wanna be in the entertainment industry and -- and, um, the music industry and -- and the -- and like, writing and stuff like that, and it's really difficult because, um, people are getting laid off in the -- in the next [inaudible] l- like western ride because people don't wanna go out and be entertained anymore, 'cause they don't have enough money to do that.  And so I -- that's -- that's a loss for me, so that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, that's just --
R:  It's [inaudible].
L:  And I wanna move to New York and everyone's like, "Oh, New York's n- dangerous now", whatever!  But I wanna move to --
R:  Well [LAUGH] --
L:  -- move to New York because that's -- that's where all the, um, media is, and that's what I wanna do, so ...
R:  So -- so do you think we should actually just -- because there's two types of people now.  There's like, those who give everything into it, like, give all their interest into the whole topic and the subject, and there's others that live subconsciously and don't even care about the whole situation.  I mean, I don't know which [NOISE] way to go towards.  Like, 'cause at times I'm like, man, look at all this that's affecting us.  And on the other hand it's like, shouldn't we just live our lives the way that we lived 'em before?  You know, it's -- it's --
L:  Yeah, we should but we c- -- we -- we can, but at the same time it's like, uh, like, some -- some things that we just can't do any more, or like, it's hard to do.  I remember when I was sitting -- I was sitting waiting for the, um, one of the -- the buses to go around campus, and this dumb sorority girl was like, "Um, I don't understand what went on with this, I mean, it's not like its affecting me any, so I don't care about it".  And it's like, "Well, girl, it affects all of us as Americans".
R:  That's exactly -- exactly what I was like -- because I went to the salon the other day and there's this, uh, woman talking about, um, the whole situation about Iraq, which is somewhat related to, you know, nine eleven --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- +terrorists -- t- you know, terrorism and -- and the whole link into Iraq.  I don't even know how it's linked together, I mean, I don't even believe Bush whenever he says it's linked together, but it's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- anyways [LAUGH].  But, um, uh, yeah, she just goes, "Yeah, I don't care.  I -- I may as well -- if I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die.  Those soldiers aren't helping me, so I don't really care and duh, duh, duh, duh".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, it's just like --
L:  That's so good! [LAUGH]
R:  It is!  I was like, man, I could
