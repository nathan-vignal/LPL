L:  Hi, this is Mary.
R:  Hi, this is Anita [LAUGH].
L:  O- Okay, what's going on?  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  We've got to talk about airport security, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, what do you think about the airport security?
R:  Well, since I've never flown, I don't intend to fly [LAUGH], um, guess it really doesn't make that much difference, but, um, I think that'll make it a little bit tighter.
L:  Uh, yes, uh, I know, uh, we -- we went to Hawaii last year and, uh -- I mean they -- my -- my sister's kids, they made them take their shoes and they -- they checked in about two or three times --
R:  Oh, my --
L:  They take their shoes and everything off --
R:  -- gosh.
L:  Uh-huh.  I got a boy who's handicapped they didn't make him take his shoes off.  He started taking his shoes off, they said he didn't have to, so that was kind of nice.
R:  Yeah, they've got to make special, you know, stuff for people [SIGH].
L:  Well, you know, some people had a whole body search and other people didn't.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I mean, they could -- they could take almost anything on -- you know, on the plane.
R:  I just sort of wish that they would do that kind of security in schools --
L:  Yes --
R:  -- or restaurants, or grocery stores [LAUGH].
L:  Well -- well, yeah, but I mean schools especially because th- -- probably -- they probably take a lot of guns and knives and stuff like that to school on the bus and stuff like that and that's not right.
R:  Well, I used to teach and, um, they had weapons on them, um, some of the girls would carry razors.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  I had them open one of my boxes one time with a razor out of her shoe [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, my god.
R:  I had -- don't do that any more.
L:  Oh, I kn- --
R:  I quit.
L:  Well, just like before the -- you know, that nine, one, one, incident they said they, uh, somebody they -- somebody said they saw something on the plane -- uh, one of the planes, they thought they we- -- they looked kind of funny, you know, kind of like they was, uh -- but they never thought about -- any more about it.
R:  Yeah, uh, it's too spooky.  That's one reason I don't want to fly 'cause we're right over the flight pattern, um, the big jumbo jets go right over our house.
L:  Oh, my son used to live down near Charleston it was like that all the time.
R:  And I can stand here and watch them and the whole time they're going over, I'm going, "Stay up, stay up, stay up" [LAUGH], you know.
L:  Oh.
R:  It just frightens me to think of those big old things falling.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I guess that's why I won't fly, I just ...
L:  Well, I never flew either.  I'm -- I'm sixty five and I th- -- like that's the first time I've ever been in a plane.
R:  Now, I'm fifty one --
L:  But --
R:  -- and I don't feel like I'll -- I mean, you know, I know there's more car crashes than airplane crashes --
L:  That's what they said, there's more accidents and more people getting killed on the road.
R:  But, the thing of it is, if a plane crashes you're not going to step out and walk away, um, [LAUGH] you've got a better chance of survival I would think.
L:  I don't know.  I said, I was going to, uh, to Nashville one day and by g- we -- a couple of weeks ago and a semi, uh, flipped over, you know, and flipped on top of a car.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And that were --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- traffic was held up for about four or five hours --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- before they got it cleaned up.  They said, " There's a -- there's a car underneath of it  --"
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  And that's a sh- -- that's sad.
R:  My husband drove the tractor and trailer.
L:  Oh, that -- that's sad though.
R:  He's gone now, so -- I know --
L:  I mean, it can happen any time.
R:  He's -- he's killed three people --
L:  Oh, my --
R:  -- but it was never his fault.
L:  Oh.
R:  And that's -- I know that's hard to live with when you're the driver.
L:  Yes. I mean like they say, uh, now an, an eighteen wheel can't stop on a dime.
R:  No, those things are very hard to stop --
L:  So, I mean, I --
R:  -- especially when you've got forty five thousand pounds behind you.
L:  Yeah, I know, I we- -- I was a semi [inaudible] what makes me so mad when you're going down the road like that, I mean, uh, you know th- -- it goes down to one lane or something like that they tell you to, you know, go down on one lane, people don't go down they just keep right on going as far as they can get in it and then they expected to get in.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  That makes me so mad -- but I don't know I -- I think the airport -- air- airport, you know, airport security is a lot better.  It could be -- sometimes I think it could be better but I don't think if -- if they sh- -- if they could carry- carrying on detectors, maybe they should carry -- the pilots or the stew- stewardesses carry on detectors on the -- on the plane.
R:  I think they ought to have some kind of weapons on the stewardess, or once they shut that pilot cabin- uh, door, it can't open.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, because --
L:  Well.
R:  Well, I don't think there'll really be anything like there was before because people aren't going to take that.
L:  Well, people are aware right now.
R:  Well, used to they'd say, "We're going to hijack the plane", take it to Cuba, they'd, um, let the people off, send the plane back --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, but, that other time they didn't [LAUGH].
L:  That was so sad then because they said some- uh, what was it -- somebody got a cellphone in to call his mum, says, you know, he was -- he was getting hijacked --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that he was going to get killed they won't see each other, th- th- he won't see her any more.  Now, that's sad.
R:  Yeah, I'd m- --
L:  They should've let the people off.
R:  I don't think I'll ever get over that day anyway.
L:  Oh, that was so sad though.  But, you know, it could happen any time.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  Y- I know my son -- he's in the, uh, reserves and he said he won't hang a yellow ribbon on his house.
R:  Really?
L:  Because he says he's afraid that they're going to -- terrorists are going to come and attack his house.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  He says a lot of places won- -- he's in Nashville and he says a lot of places won't, uh, won't hang the ribbons out because they're afraid that's just like a -- a, you know, "Come on, come on, come on, get me", you know.  It's a -- th- that's just like an invite for the +terrorist -- terrorists.
R:  You know, I never thought of that.
L:  And I got --
R:  God --
L:  -- the yellow ribbons, but I -- I n- -- I didn't put one on my house yet.  I thought if anything --
R:  Now, where you from?
L:  I'm from Tennessee.
R:  Well, I'm North Carolina, so...
L:  Oh.
R:  I talked to a lady last night from California [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, yeah.  I -- I -- we had to go away last night and n- -- and I got home I found there was a message on my answer machine but I -- I -- I w- didn't get a chance to d- do the survey.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, [SIGH] I -- we -- we had to go -- we had to go to Nashville and we didn't get home until after one o'clock in the morning --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I didn't get a chance to do it, but this I know -- this is kind of interesting.  You get to talk to other people about other subjects like this.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I don't know that many people even in this State and out of State, you know, I just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- don't get around much, so ...
L:  We went -- we just -- we just came back from Myrtle Beach.
R:  Oh.
L:  Couple of weeks ago.
R:  I love that place, oh.
L:  It w- -- it was nice.  We stayed up there and, um, uh, you know it was very ni- -- we -- we stayed at --
R:  Where did you stay?
L:  Um, Har- Harbour Lights.  It's a Bluegreen Resort.
R:  Oh, that's pretty.  We always stay at Captain's Quarters.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  That's gorgeous [SIGH].  If I could fly down there, you know, they've got, um, airport down there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- where it used to be the airforce base.
L:  Oh, you know, that's a shame too about -- th- a lot of these airforce bases are just shut down --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  They're just empty.
R:  That was dumb.
L:  Yeah, I know, there's a lot -- there's -- there -- there's so- -- there's one down in S- South Carolina too -- it's  it -- you go by there it's just -- there's nothing there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Those homes -- those homes could be nice homes for people.
R:  Yeah, that was, uh, right out at Myrtle Beach Airforce Base and you can see -- when you go down seventeen you can see all those empty homes.
L:  Yeah, I -- I know it.
R:  It's just for nothing it's -- it's just not right.
L:  I know, but ... yeah.
R:  We needed that protection.  You know they could have helped during this terrorist attack.
L:  Uh, yeah -- no, they thought that war was just about over or something like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- this, but then they -- then they said they got bombed again.  Aft- -- you know, they've --
R:  Well, I'm sorry --
L:  -- they've got to keep their guard up.
R:  I don't care what they say, there's always going to be a war --
L:  Oh, I know it.
R:  -- because somebody's going to want power.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And there's going to be a terrorist --
L:  I didn't care for -- I don't care for Bush, but I mean, that's the way it goes.
R:  Well, one of the guys that was at the head of this terrorist attack thing went to school here in North Carolina.
L:  You know that's -- th- that's what they said -- that's what they -- that he was coming over here United States and go- going to school and stuff like that th- then, you   know, doing it in  secret before they did the terrorist attack.
R:  Well --
L:  It --
R:  -- I tell you, it scares me to death.
L:  Well, just like that, you know, in the Oklahoma bombing, I still don't think he was all at fault --
R:  No --
L:   Y- I think -- I -- I -- he had to be tied, tied in with this too.
R:  Well, I know when my husband -- he was driving local at the time when that bombing happened up in New York --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and his -- I could hear his dispatcher, he came on there and he said, "You all go on like you are, just don't go in Greensborough, stay out of there.  If you see anybody with a towel on their head, run over 'em". [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I know.  Dow- down here there's a couple of peop- uh, a couple of people working in a fast food restaurant just got that, you know, that like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they're -- they're -- they're rude, they don't speak to you they don't do nothing to you.  They just do the business and that's it --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- they don't smile, they don't do nothing.
R:  I don't know, I -- I'm just so wary of any place I go any more.  I've -- I've just got to where I stay on my own .
L:  Uh -- no, uh, it's too bad -- too bad they can't do like a -- like a -- a radar or something like that to check on people like a -- I haven't -- no I g- -- when you go to a -- a courthouse or stuff like that you go through this there, um -- like a, you know, check point or something like that.  They check everything on you.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I know my sister told me --
R:  [SIGH]
L:   -- I'd better have my -- my son's pills in a special -- you know, a bottle that has a prescription nabel, uh, label, because if I just have plain pills they won't let me take them on --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- the plane, so, but  --
R:  Well, I know I had to go for court duty and they did us with a wand up and down --
L:  Yeah, that's what -- that's what they did at the airport too --
R:  And, uh --
L:  -- certain people, but not everybody --
R:  -- we could not carry a purse.
