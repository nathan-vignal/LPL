R:  Hi, my name's Lisa.
L:  Hi, my name is Bea [LAUGH] how are you?
R:  Pretty good.
L:  That's good.
R:  How are you today?
L:  Fine.
R:  So, we're to discuss baseball --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- salaries and strikes.
L:  Um, baseball, uh, professional athletes, should they strike?
R:  Yeah.  Um, I don't -- I don't know it seems to hurt in the long run the whole, you know, major league baseball and then they just charge more for tickets afterwards.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's -- that's true.  I -- but the only reason I think they might just strike if they don't get paid enough because I figure like twenty years of work time for the average person wouldn't affect their body like it would an athlete.  That's the only reason I think they might need a little bit more money just because --
R:  Yeah, more money but --
L:  -- te- ten years out of their life is like [LAUGH] a lot of years.
R:  But --
L:  Even though they do get paid big bucks though.
R:  Yeah, some of 'em get paid a huge amount.  
L:  Mhm, goodness.
R:  I would never earn in my lifetime what they made in like two or --
L:  No.
R:  -- three years.
L:  And that is a lot of money but there is -- some of them are greedy.  They are, very greedy.
R:  And it -- I don't think the strikes are really helping like the little guys unless they could like have the minor leagues, you know --
L:  Well, it's not because, you know --
R:  -- benefit from some of it.
L:  [NOISE] So --
R:  And it -- I think that a lot of the trickle down effect, like all the little, you know, coffee shops and restaurants around the stadium, they really suffer during a --
L:  That's true, they suffer because they don't get no business.
R:  Yep.
L:  [inaudible] and that's a family that's not making -- probably making their mortgage.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] You know, but in two or three or four weeks however long they're on strike.
R:  Yeah, it's the daily grind for them, you know --
L:  Yeah, it'll be trickled down to everybody.  If you go to the game, you know --
R:  Yep, everything costs more, the prices are just getting outrageous.
L:  [NOISE] That's true.  Well, I don't -- in a way I don't think they should strike.
R:  Yeah, that's a -- I think more of that, you know, just one on one negotiation with each --
L:  That's true but then --
R:  -- member would, you know, be better for the, I think, the overall good of baseball.
L:  Yeah, that's -- yeah, and then you'll find it's the ones that's paid a lot of money that wanna -- that'll be hollering the most.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true. 
L:  Yes.  You'll never find the little man who are hollering 'cause there's some underpaid players but they just happy to be playing.
R:  Yep.  But, yeah, so I -- I just really don't agree, you know, and I think it's especially noticeable with baseball because I -- you know, there's no such thing as the minor league football that I know of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and so I -- you know, everybody that I know has turned from the major baseball games and they --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- just got to the minor games now.
L:  Yeah, arena football, that's the only kind of second football they have.  They play it in an arena, they don't play outside at all.
R:  Ah.
L:  They should be hollering about raises.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Because they don't get -- they don't get paid nothing, hardly nothing at all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They play AAA, the baseball team.
R:  Yeah, that's 'cause -- and those people really suffer, you know, just their hopes and dreams of wanting to play in the major leagues and they really put up with, you know, living on a bus for --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- six to eight months a year and --
L:  They -- they need it.  They the ones that need a pay raise.
R:  Yeah, they need the money but they don't go strike because they don't wanna dash their hopes of --
L:  [LAUGH] That's true.
R:  -- playing in the big -- big leagues.
L:  [NOISE] That's true.
R:  Yeah, and I -- I think that most people that I know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with, um, the last strike are just like totally turned off baseball, nobody's really interested and then they also --
L:  No, because I know our stadium was empty and usually is -- well, it used to be kinda -- kinda full, Gundarena[?].
R:  Ah.
L:  Or should I say -- no, Jacob's Field, that's what it is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't go.
R:  Yeah, it's -- in Cleveland it's the Jacob Field new.
L:  Yes, and it used to be full but this past -- since they've been playing no one gonna probably show up.
R:  Yeah, I think the statistics for Cleveland when it was first opened everybody wanted to go just to try out the stadium but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it wasn't to see the ball game, it was more to see the stadium itself.
L:  And they hadn't really played a good game in a long time, not since Mark -- Mike Hargrove was the, uh, coach of the team, uh, you know, the manager of the team.  Now, don't -- nobody don't hardly know none of the players 'cause all of them have gone.
R:  Oh yeah, that's true.
L:  Well, nobody hardly know the players.  If they lose my [inaudible] gonna go to the -- to the little person.
R:  And also then with the stadium building is all -- you know, did the taxes go up in your area?  I know in the Pittsburgh that Allegany County has a higher sales tax in order to help.
L:  Oh, yes, they talked about raising our taxes but, uh, [NOISE] we'll vote for 'em on the fifteenth, the fifteenth of -- of May, um, we have a vote.  But I don't think they wanna -- I don't think the people gonna pass this tax.
R:  Yeah, they did it in Pittsburgh and --
L:  Because they wanna raise your house tax and --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  -- taxes on your house and new --
R:  Yeah, they just did the sales tax in Pittsburgh so, you know, like if you go into buy a TV the tax is seven percent --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- whereas the rest of, you know, outside that county it's six percent state sales tax.
L:  I think they need to tax the -- the major league.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  The games will be more money.
R:  And then -- and now even there's less games on TV because they're selling 'em to the -- you know, the --
L:  Cable channels.
R:  -- cable channels.
L:  Yes.  And not everybody subscribe to the cable and that's bad.
R:  Yep.
L:  But my tax dollars go to help pay for the stadium but I can't watch it on television.
R:  Yep.  And -- and they had to do it because financially they needed the --
L:  The money.  Yeah.
R:  -- the -- the money to pay those salaries.
L:  They get -- they get greedier, greedier and greedier.
R:  Yep.
L:  And you wonder where it's gonna stop --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] So, that's --
L:  -- you know. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, so that's why I think the, you know, the strikes are really hurting.
L:  It is, it do hurt -- hurt a lot of people when they do that.
R:  And it -- it really brings to the attention of people just how much some of those guys are getting paid.  And, yeah, you can see that they should maybe, you know, earn two or three times the amount of the average person because their careers are only, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a third or half as long but --
L:  But not in no millions and millions of dollars that's what --
R:  Yeah, millions of dollars of year.
L:  That's ridiculous.  That's ridiculous.  I can understand endorsements, yeah, but not just from playing the sport alone, they shouldn't earn no millions of dollars.  They should -- there should be a cap on -- on that, it really should.
R:  Yeah, yeah, that would be good, a cap on salaries and try -- you know, then they could have some leverage to keep the strikes from happening --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and saying, "Hey, look, yeah, well, you know, here's the lower paid guys, we'll up there but --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- you top guys will just have to suffer with your millions".
L:  Suffer, right.  Because this ridiculous.  Two million dollars for a season or six years or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- three years and I don't know that's -- that's too much money.
R:  Yep and then they just think of a reason a couple of years later to -- they want more than, you know, what they got out of the last strike.
L:  I don't know, it seems like the more they get, the more they want, exactly.
R:  Yep, 'cause it works, you know, for them.  They go on strike they get their like -- little crying babies having a temper fit
L:  Mhm.  I wish I could -- could, uh, make what they make.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  I wouldn't want -- never wanna go on no strike and probably cuss out somebody that's talking about going on strike, you know, we're going on strike --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we've got enough money to survive in this world.  No.
R:  [LAUGH] That's right.  No, no, don't tell anybody what we've got, they'll want some of it [LAUGH].
L:  Yes, we make enough -- they make enough money to survive in this world and then some, to support families, the money these, uh, baseball and basketball players make.
R:  Yep.
L:  But, no they get it as tax write off though.  Uh-huh, and they give a lot of it to charities that they know --
R:  Oh yeah, it makes them, you know, just --
L:  Have to pay less in taxes.
R:  Yep.  They get a tax break on it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it makes them look good and --
L:  Yeah.  They're still doing better than not- nobody else.
R:  Yeah, so I really think that the strikes are, you know, just bad for baseball in particular and bad for most of the other sport.
L:  It is, and the small people that's working the stadiums they is -- because they got a job, the hotdog vendors and the cap sellers, tee shirts, and they make a living -- some of 'em make a living off -- off that, um -- off selling --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- selling what they sell.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Doing this -- doing that season.
R:  Yep, and I know a lot of, you know, like in Pittsburgh, the college kids they get a job for the summer, you know, being one of the hotdog vendors in the stadium itself.  That's how they're supporting themselves --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to go through college.
L:  Mm, yes this -- it's seasonal, uh --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- work.  
R:  And seasonal jobs are getting, you know, harder to find so that's just another --
L:  Well, yes, there's lots of --
R:  -- bad point of that.
L:  I think they -- they're going to be crying in a minute because there's no one going to be going to hardly no games --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- in a while.  They're really gonna be crying.
R:  Yep.
L:  Things are about to get very bad.
R:  But then there's -- you know, some corporations buy those season tickets and, you know, I'm sure that'll keep up that --
L:  Oh, yeah and they bought up loads of boxes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's over a hundred thousand dollars for that little bitty --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- box.  The only thing they get in those boxes is, uh, what like waitressing, they get somebody to come up there to serve them.
R:  Yep.  Yeah, it's like, you know, uh, having a dining room in a hotel.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, up -- in your room.
L:  That's so true.
R:  And, you know, you hav- -- there's a waitress assigned to it, or waiter, and --
L:  I used to go see the games but I stopped going to them 'cause tickets cost too much, when they went up.
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  I mean to go to Jacobs Field, uh-uh.
R:  We -- we just go to the college ball games now.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, yeah, that'd be better 'cause their tickets are just ridiculous, [inaudible] tickets ridiculous.
R:  Yep, I -- I'd much rather pay two bucks [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] me too. [NOISE] If I could just pay --
R:  Yeah, and be able to see the whole --
L:  [inaudible], uh-uh, that's too much money.
R:  And I think ...
