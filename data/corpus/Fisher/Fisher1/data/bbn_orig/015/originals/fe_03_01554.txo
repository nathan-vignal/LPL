R:  Nine one two nine two seven si- [NOISE] --
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  How ya doing?
L:  I'm good.  Who are you?
R:  This is Betty.
L:  Hi, Betty.  I'm Linda.
R:  Okay.  Hold on a minute.  I've got to tell my husband a quick thing.  Nine two seven six nine three two. [PAUSE] I'm -- I'm sorry.  I was on a phone call when they clicked in --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and if I clicked back to them then I'd lose you.  So I'm --
L:  Betty, where are you living?
R:  In -- in the DC area.
L:  In -- in Washington DC?
R:  Yes.  Where are you?
L:  I'm -- I'm in Tulsa, Oklahoma. 
R:  Oh, wow!  Okay.  And -- and --
L:  Okay.  So, our topic of the day is pro athletes' --
R:  -letes --
L:  -- current wages?
R:  Right.
L:  Okay.  I think they make too much.
R:  Oh, I know they make too much.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  The poor people are doing without!  They're getting richer. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I tell ya i- it's ridiculous though some of the things they strike for.
L:  I know.
R:  Either more money or ... I just don't feel like, you know, I should have to work these many days, things like that.  Look -- look at these -- these soldiers we have going to war for twenty thousand dollars and thirty thousand dollars.
L:  I know.
R:  Putting their lives on the line.  It's ridiculous.
L:  I mean, I know they make a lot of money, you know, with football and basketball, you know, professional sports and stuff.  But I -- I think they make way too much money.
R:  I think we need to count some salaries here.
L:  I do.  You know, uh, like, American Airlines they're going under and -- and they're reducing their debt.  Well, I think everybody needs to do their own thing -- you know, their, uh, their part and -- and cut salaries, the high paid salaries --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- back across the board.  I mean, sports and --
R:  Thank you.
L:  -- and, you know, airlines.  I think ou- there's a lot of professions out there right now that are -- are making --
R:  Oh, way overpaid.
L:  -- overpaid.  Definitely.
R:  The service jobs --
L:  Definitely overpaid.
R: -- these people are so working so hard and getting --
L:  Nothing.
R:  -- some of em, you know, barely minimum wage.
L:  Yep.
R:  And that's ridiculous.  They've got families to feed.
L:  I know.
R:  Th- these guys b- [SIGH] they live rich [MN] and they live fast lives.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I know a lot of their careers are short lived, but [SIGH] if you conserve you're gonna to be rich for the rest of your life.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  I -- I tell you.  We did twenty seven years with the military and just retired and we thank God we can make our house note.
L:  A- a- amen!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
R:  You know, that's -- we -- we wait on that retirement check every month so we can pay our house note.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They gotta --
L:  So, you were in the military for twenty seven years?
R:  Yep.  To- -- a total of twenty seven years, my husband and myself.
L:  Wow!
R:  Yes.
L:  Wonderful.
R:  And we feel so blessed, uh, because I -- I can grew up in the south in the sixties --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  --  when there was a black and a white issue.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And do you remember how ...?  I remember when they were talking, um, [LIPSMACK] I saw the special where Jackie Robinson was the first black to come into baseball and all the [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] disturbances it caused.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But then him being a good athlete i- i- it's a shame.  People look at your skill  before they look at you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as a person.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, you and your husband must've served in -- in Vietnam?
R:  The Vietnam era.  Yep.
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  I'm a Vietnamese era vet.
L:  -- we're in about the same age group I believe.
R:  [LAUGH] Were you -- are you guys military in any way?
L:  Uh, no, I'm not.  But, I mean, I -- I gr- -- I gr- I was born in fifty one.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I'm -- I'm fifty one.
R:  Well, my husband was born in fifty three, and I was born in fifty seven.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we just took a tour, um, [MN] we've been here five years and never toured DC.
L:  Really?
R:  And I went to that Vietnam wall and cried.
L:  Mm, I bet.
R:  I -- I cried.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I had so many of my friends that were killed in that war.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- uh, it was a sad thing all the way around and now we're having to go through this one and -- and, you know?
R:  My husband did the first desert storm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And since we've retired he cannot be called up unless there's a massive recall.
L:  Right.
R:  Um ...
L:  Well, we came close this time I guess.
R:  No.  We would love to go back in.
L:  Really?
R:  Oh, God, there's so many vets are so patriotic right now.  [MN]  They- -- they're being flooded with calls of people asking can they go back in.
L:  Yeah.  Even -- even if the wages aren't what professional football players make. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It's the love of your country.
L:  I know.
R:  And these -- I tell you these  athletes don't care about anything.  They -- they have no soul, no pa- -- no -- no patriotic feeling.
L:  Mhm.
R:  E- everything comes so easily to these people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they're made heroes  because they play basketball?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Football?
L:  Or football.  It seems like those are the two biggies.  Baseball is getting pushed out, but, um ...
R:  [SIGH]  L- look at these poor -- I mean, we're sending young people home in body bags.
L:  They could be -- they could feed a third world country --
R:  Country.
L:  -- on their income.
R:  Thank you!
L:  You know --
R:  Thank you!
L: -- they really could.
R:  I -- I tell --
L:  I -- I think that's pretty ridiculous.
R:  Maybe they should have a service obligation to -- back to the community.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They -- they say they, um, with all these commercials where they go in and they read to the schools and they donate money, but they -- they don't even need half of those --
L:  But is it enough?  Is it enough, you know?
R:  It's -- it's -- it's not enough.
L:  It's -- I don't think --
R:  It's not.
L:  -- it's enough.
R:  I mean, half of their salary should go toward someone +impoverished.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I- if you could just support one family along with yourself --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- that would be so good, that would be a --
L:  Especially --
R:  -- a blessing.
L:  -- if they're making that kind of money with -- when they're not hurting for anything --
R:  Oh, [MN]
L:  -- and -- and -- and you and I are struggling to make our mortgage payments and -- and our -- our food bills and ...
R:  I've -- I've got a child in her third year of college and she wants to be a doctor.
L:  Yeah?
R:  And we're paying for it 'cause --
L:  High dollar.
R:  -- we- we're not  a minority anymore [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- 'cause all the money's gone.  They don't have a- the -- the funds that they used to have when I was in school to help pay for college.  
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  The parents are paying for it now.  And it's hard.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You want to give your children more than you had.
L:  That's right.  That true.
R:  But these athletes they live for the moment and living for the moment is what's killing the majority of them.  Half of them are on drugs.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I- I'm a social worker.
L:  Steroids and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- drugs and --
R:  I tell ya they --
L:  -- broken homes and ...
R:  They're -- they're always in a conflict, in court, beating up someone, or [MN] abuse at home.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, but ...
L:  I think that money will do that to ya if you have an abundance of it where you can do whatever you think you want to do, any time, anywhere, any place, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think money will do that to you.
R:  Y- it does.  It does.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I don't think it would do that to the average person if --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- they've got, uh, uh, values.
L:  Because they have to work for everything they get.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they -- they learn to appreciate it so much more.
R:  And -- and what's so strange about it, the majority of these athletes came from ghettos, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- impoverished areas, and they've forgot where they came from.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Th- th- -- well, one of the first things they do when they get on television, "Hi, Mum" waving.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, okay, that's good, recognize Mum.  But now let's recognize some of these people that still don't have electricity.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Able to feed their kids.  Yes, they're way overpaid.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And when they went on strike I was so glad to see people step in to keep some of these areas going.  W- why not have a national pay up time?
L:  And look at the price that they charge the public for a ticket --
R:  Oh, God!
L: -- to get in to see those games.  No wonder their wages are so high.
R:  I would love --
L:  You know, those auditoriums and those fields, they hold lots of people, thousands.
R:  I'm on the waiting list for the Red Skins, um, season passes, right?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, it's like a twenty year waiting list.
L:  Oh, my Lord!
R:  So, they came up -- they added some more box seats in on the second leveling and sent me a note and said, uh, "You can buy box seats".  So, I called to enquire how much they were.  Thirty five hundred dollars a seat!
L:  A seat?
R:  A seat!
L:  Oh ...
R:  Every year you pay and it goes up e- every year as well.  I can't pay thirty five hundred dollars.  That's my house note three times.
L:  Oh, Lord!
R:  But these guys, I mean, they have box seats and they have their friends in them.  You know -- [MN] [SIGH] I don't know -- I guess it's all about the money now instead of the ac- -- the enjoyment of the sport.
L:  But, you know, as long as people are still willing to pay that thirty five hundred dollars a seat they're going to continue to get the income that they want for the -- for the professional pl- ball players.
R:  You know, you could actually get that financed [NOISE]?  You could actually get that financed.
L:  Really?
R:  Some loan companies will finance it for you because it's -- that's an asset.
L:  Mm.  I did not know that.
R:  And then there was an article, um -- I was on the Internet the other day.  This lady wanted to go on vacation with her husband and she had -- they had, um, season passes for, um, one of the clubs in Chicago I -- the football team, I think the Bears.  And so she put it on the Internet to sell that one game so they can go on vacation.  Do you know they took the man's season passes away because that's illegal to do?
L:  Mm.
R:  It's strictly for your use.  You cannot sell them.  And he took them to court and he actually lost because it said on the back of the ticket, which no one reads, "This is for your personal use only, cannot be resold".
L:  I didn't know that.
R:  I- I didn't either.
L:  That's interesting.
R:  [MN] 'Cause we've had friends give us tickets to go places --
L:  Well, I --
R:  -- to these things.
L:  -- I kinda think though, if it goes back to the public and the public start saying no to the high prices that, you know, some of these prices will eventually start coming down, and I think it will anyway because the economy right now is getting so bad, and I think -- I think in order for these guys to do what they love to do they're -- they're going to have to take a little bit less
