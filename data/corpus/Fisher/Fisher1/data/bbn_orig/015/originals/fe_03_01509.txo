R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, how are you doing?
R:  Good.  My name is Matt, I'm from Bellingham, Washington.
L:  Hi, my name's Greg.  I'm -- I'm actually from California.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um.
R:  So, [SIGH] I guess the topic is, ah, what changes have we made in our lives since September eleventh.
L:  Yep.  I -- I -- I guess I have to say I haven't made any. [LAUGH] I just kind of live my life as usual since September eleventh.  How about you? 
R:  Yeah, I would say that I haven't, um, made any substantial changes, um, but, you know, what's interesting is, you know, I'm -- I -- I -- I try to be conscious of, you know, of my upbringing and everything that, ah, comes into play as far as my opinions of, you know, you know, the current events and everything, and, ah, I have noticed that I've become more aware, like I take a second look whenever I see, um, like someone that -- that looks like they're from an Arabic background driving in a car, you know, um, coming my way or something like that.  I -- I take like a second glance.
L:  Yeah, I'd say I do that too.
R:  And I think that that's, you know, I don't -- I don't know whether that could be considered racist or whatever, but it's, ah, a generalization that I'm making subconsciously.
L:  I'd --I'd say I do the same things but I -- I don't -- I think it's more of just increased awareness, I don't think it's racist.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I mean, I mean, it's kind of scary enough position where you don't have -- have another choice because of the -- the corporate world behind the terrorist attacks.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  
L:  They've kind of made a bad name for their fellow comrades.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Although they didn't do it intentionally, that's what -- that's happened.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think the only changes I've really made are the ones that are really out of my control such as like going to the airport and having free security and stuff like that -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I think those things are good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just -- just to make people responsible and ideally make you actually safer, enough to feel safer.
R:  Yeah.  Um, [COUGH] yeah, I wouldn't say that I've limited -- I mean, I don't travel all that much anyway but I haven't limited my travel, really.  Um, I'm willing to deal with the, ah, increased security, you know, at, ah, airports just, I mean, it's nice to know when you get on a plane that somebody doesn't have something in their shoes.
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely.
R:  Um.
L:  That's more comforting that way.
R:  I've, um, -- I'd say one change is that I've -- I mean, prior to September eleventh, I cared a little bit less about the news, you know, and -- and tried -- I try more to get a variety of sources of news now, you know, and I kind of seek out news more so than I did before.
L:  I'd -- I'd say I do the same things but I've always been kind of interested in current events in the news so I -- I guess sometimes I get more glued to it but that's only because I think I have more free time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause I'm not in school so I have more free time to watch the news.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And keep up with what's going on in the world.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I find that local stuff any more, just letters going on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I like to keep up with those things because you never know, something -- some knowledge might come in handy for whatever reason.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Plus it's kind of fun just to know what's --
R:  Yeah, oh yeah.
L:  -- going on around here. 
R:  It's good to stay up on everything as best you can.  Boy, there's just so much information coming at you these days --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- so it's hard to keep up with it.  Um, have you noticed -- one thing I've noticed and this is just in terms of, like, a change of attitude, I've become much more suspicious of, ah, the intentions of our governing body, you know.  I've just -- I've become much more hyper aware of, okay, now, what are the reasons behind what these people are saying are the reasons?  Um, and, you know, I've always kind of been that way but I'm much more so over the last couple of years.  
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Have you noticed a change like that?
L:  Oh, yeah, I've -- I'm actually always -- I mean, not critical of everything that the government does but especially since Bush became president I've been a lot more critical because I don't agree with anything he does.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's just my opinion.  I mean -- I mean, you may be quite the opposite but -- but it sounds like you seem to have a similar point of view.
R:  Yeah.  I really don't -- I -- I have a hard time trusting, um, the intentions of the administration, you know.  I mean, I -- it appears that most of their decisions, when -- if you dig deep enough are pretty self serving.
L:  Oh, yeah, I -- I fully agree with that.  Mm, I think that, ah -- I think it's quite evident that Bush is going into Iraq for the oil.  I mean, there's -- to me there's no question about that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because weapons of mass destruction were supposed to be the reason for the war.  We haven't found any of that and the war technically is kind of over.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we still haven't found any of that and now he wants to get the, ah, oil embargo lifted off of Iraq so they can sell their oil.
R:  Yeah, surprise, surprise, huh?
L:  [inaudible] and wants it, yeah, and there'd be no other reason why he wants it off so soon.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  Yeah. Um, --
L:  So I don't know, I don't think anyone can be trusted any more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you look at France and Russia, they didn't want to go to war because they have interests in Iraq.  It's not because they're against the war, they -- they have things there that they're connected to, like training.  Military people are selling them things and other things they're not supposed to be doing that they didn't want to uncover.
R:  Right, right, right, right.  Yeah, um, well -- 
L:  I just -- [inaudible] the governor of your state ran for president, he seems pretty, ah, on top of things. 
R:  Gary Locke?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  He -- um -- 
L:  A good guy, I've seen him on TV.
R:  Yeah, I think that, ah, he's a reasonable man.  He, ah, seems to -- 
L:  He seems to see things from every angle, not -- not from a self motivated point of view.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  He -- at the very least he studies a problem and you may not agree with his -- with his conclusion -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but [MN] I have faith that he has fully stated a problem and he has taken the path of, you know, least consequence, um, and sometimes those -- I mean, that's why we have politicians to, eh, make the hard decisions, you know.
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  And, ah, so, yeah, yeah, he -- I would love to see him right -- run for higher office.
L:  Does -- does your state have any issues like California does with their governor though where they do some things that seem very suspicious?  I mean -- -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --  the Governor of California is a Democrat, he's not a Republican but I'd -- I'd say he is very similar to Bush.
R:  Mm.
L:  He does things that are very -- very self motivated and for his own -- his own interest.
R:  The Governor of California is Grey Davis, right?
L:  Yep.
R:  Yeah, yeah, oh, God, and he was involved in that whole mess with, um, the power companies. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, he, like, profited from that too. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Um, [COUGH] well, right now, I don't know of anything like that in my state but, um, he recently had to make a really tough choice.  I don't -- I guess we're kind of getting off topic here, um, -- 
L:  That happened last time I did one of these too just because there's only so much you can say about whether or not you've made a change since September eleventh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, either you did or you didn't, right? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And if you didn't, there isn't much more to expand on.
R:  Yeah.  Well, he -- he made a controversial decision recently on a -- on a coal plant that, um, was going to go in in the Fraser Valley which is just east -- well, it's kind of about, oh, a couple of hundred miles north east of, ah, Seattle.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, pretty much on the Canadian border and there's a -- um, we have some pretty serious power problems up here right now that are shutting down our aluminium plants and, um, they're looking for alternatives to hydro electric power being as, you know, the glaciers are melting and the -- the, ah, you know, hydro can't always be depended on.
L:  That's a problem [inaudible] the snow remains all the time? 
R:  What's that?
L:  That's a problem up there in that it rains and snows all the time?
R:  Even though the, ah, -- well, we still have plentiful supply.  I think that they are just really looking to -- I'm -- I'm just giving the general argument that -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, the masses are -- are saying, you know, that -- I think that if [NOISE] -- if conservation were put into place much more so then we wouldn't have any problems at all, but, you know, um, anyway, there's -- there's this appearance of a power shortage coming up in the next five or ten years and, ah, not nearly like California, you know, but they're trying to look ahead a little bit, and so there's argument for a coal, ah, coal plant, basically, ah, to produce electricity, um, came forth and Governor Locke had to vote on it, um, and, ah, he ended up voting for it, [NOISE] um, which I disagreed with because it's going to put a lot of pollution in that valley, um, a lot of coal pollution, um, but he made a lot of other industries in the area, um, ah, basically --
