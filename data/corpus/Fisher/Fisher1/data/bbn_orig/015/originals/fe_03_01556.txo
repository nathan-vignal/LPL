L:  Hi, I'm Christine.
R:  I'm Lenora.  How are you?
L:  Well, I'm fine.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How about yourself?
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, how do we feel about, uh ...?
L:  Professional athletes going on strike.
R:  Yeah.  I don't think they should. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think they get paid too much money. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I agree with you.  
R:  [MN]
L:  I -- I think for what they do they make far too much [LAUGH] money. 
R:  Yeah, I'd also do.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean -- oh -- no, no ... there's not that many people that get up to that statue of, uh, level, rather -- of play.  But still, I mean, I don't think they need to -- the rates they've -- y- they charge for tickets and the -- the amount that, uh, you know, parking and everything else go to the stadium and to the games.
L:  I agree.  I agree.
R:  And --
L:  I -- I live in a -- in a state that has not so great sports teams.
R:  Oh! [LAUGH]
L:  And unfortunately because they're not so great they don't have the money to really bring in some good players.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think if they were to cap, you know, salaries and kinda make it more of an even playing field, you know, for every team to be able to bring in -- in decent players, I think we would do much better. [LAUGH]
R:  I do too.  I mean, um [NOISE] I live in Florida.  But, uh [NOISE], you know [LAUGH] -- well, I don't root for Florida teams, but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] In fact, uh, the one that I root for, the Florida coach went to bat fifty [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the Redskins. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  But, like -- and we didn't like him. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So we had to tooth smacker! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  But, uh, no, I -- I do -- I -- I think they get entirely too much money And, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  The pay -- the fans they don't really, uh, the things that they have for sale, uh, you know, little cups and things like that, that, uh, are too expensive as far as I'm concerned.
L:  I agree.  I have -- I've not been to a sports -- a professional sports game in ages.
R:  [LAUGH] I haven't been to one -- this is gonna to tell my age -- but in Washington DC [LAUGH] to the -- the senators.
L:  It's been a while. [LAUGH]
R:  That was baseball. [LAUGH]
L:  It's been a while. [LAUGH]
R:  It has. [LAUGH]
L:  I think -- yeah, 'cause I think probably the last professional game that I went to I was in high school.
R:  Yeah, well, that's -- that's about, you know --
L:  And that's been, you know, fifteen years since I was in high school. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well, I've been a little bit further than then. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, uh, no, I -- I have four sons and, uh, when my husband was here, oh, [LIPSMACK] uh, they -- he built a room on the back r- -- back of the house and it was football day I got kicked out because I got too excited [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They made me cook instead of watching the football game. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no! [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I get violent when I get excited. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, not violent, but  enthused let's say.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Let's put it that way.  But, oh, no, they, uh -- I think when they, uh, had that, uh ... what was it, a couple of years ago they had that strike --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, for the football and, uh -- I mean, it was, you know -- messed up everything, you know?
L:  Yeah, absolutely.
R:  And, uh --
L:  Absolutely.  And I can see, you know, transit workers going on strike, I can see hospital workers going on strike, you know, but people that make their living playing sports --
R:  Yeah.  No.
L:  N- no.
R:  I don't think so.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, uh, I mean --
L:  It's like actors going on strike.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  I think you make too much money to begin with.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  For what you're doing you're -- you're -- you're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- being paid for a natural talent rather than a ...
R:  An acquired or a t- -- a learned talent.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.
R:  Mhm
L:  Something that you had to work for.  This is something that comes to you pretty naturally.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  And, yes, you have to put time and effort into it, but I put time and effort into what I do and I don't make, you know [LAUGH] ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Nobody's offering me twenty million dollars to do what I do. [LAUGH]
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But they do, they -- they're overpaid and over compensated and the -- the fringes that they get also, I mean, are outrageous.
L:  I agree.
R:  I mean, um --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- they, uh, I mean, I could see one of us buying one of those travel buses that they travel in, some of 'em, in all for --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ridiculous.  But --
L:  And once that, you know, once they get into professional sports then, of course, they're travelling by plane.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know?  And they're flying first class and they're staying in four star hotels and they're ...
R:  And they act -- they -- they treat everybody else like they're beneath 'em --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they're -- they're actually their fans who put 'em there in the first place.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  [MN] You know, it just --
L:  You shouldn't be catered to in such a way.
R:  No.
L:  You know, if the -- if the fans weren't there  you wouldn't have a job.
R:  Right.
L:   You know?
R:  That's true.  And --
L:  And it's like why did you get into playing this to begin with?
R:  Yeah.  And --
L:  You know, why are you playing?  Are you pursuing this as a career because it's something that you really enjoy?
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  Or are you pursuing it for the money?
R:  And, you know, a lot of them they -- they literally went to college on a sport scholarship.
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  And, uh, then they didn't -- I mean, not all of them, but I'd say the majority of 'em -- didn't take advantage of the scholarship itself --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they just went for the -- the getting into the sports itself.
L:  Right.  Absolutely.
R:  Which is, I think, wrong in the long run too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which a lot of them found out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because they didn't have what they thought they had.
L:  They didn't have what it took. [LAUGH]  That's right. 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, you know?
L:  Or the ones that get into professional sports and, you know, can only play -- or because they get hurt.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  And it's like what were they-- 
R:  And that's another thing, they get, uh, all the -- the top doctors and -- and, oh, you know, um, you know, bone and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, um, even the exercise equipment and everything that they, uh, the techniques that they use and all are the top --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, it's not, you know, what the ordinary person can get.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which is wrong.  I mean, I think it should be to the -- everyone, not just --
L:  Sure.  Sure.
R:  -- the elite.
L:  Shouldn't be catered to just because you're an athlete.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  No matter how good you are.
R:  Yeah.  Or, um, uh, I know we had a couple of 'em that, uh, had incidents down here at, you know, like bars at the -- down in Orlando --
L:  Oh, ab- -- yeah.
R:  -- and things of that sort and, uh, it was kind of  covered over, but yet it wasn't covered over, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  They, uh, let enough out to satisfy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that they did something wrong, but it wasn't, you know -- and then it was, oh, well, it wasn't that bad.
L:  It -- it wasn't that bad, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And that's, you know ... I think the -- the perks are too much for the -- what they do.
L:  Yeah, I -- I agree.
R:  And I think given the right to strike [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, I agree.  I agree.  You know, I mean, yes, you need to be -- maybe they need to unionize, you know, as -- as players they need to unionize to be able to have a say in what the owners can do and a say --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in what the management can do, and what their agents can do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  So, yeah, I agree with that as a collective bargaining agent, yeah, they should be able to do something like that.  But to be able to walk out when your job is --
R:  They've gotten --
L:  -- to provide a service for the fans --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  And they're -- they're actually walking out on the fans themselves --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- instead of the -- the owners.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause, uh, I mean, the owners don't -- they don't do nothing.  If they do strike they don't do anything but raise ticket prices to --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- to, oh, compensate the f- -- the owners for the strike.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So, they're not out anything.
L:  I mean, it -- it seems like if they go out on strike they should in turn compensate all those fans that weren't able to attend the game that they bought the ticket for because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there was no game.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  And there's a lot, you know, season ticket holders and stuff that, uh, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- don't -- they don't get anything back.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh --
L:  And, I don't think that's right.
R:  No.  No.  I mean, I don't -- I -- I just wonder sometimes about the  equilibrium and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- as far as --
L:  [COUGH] Excuse me.
R:  -- you know, what's right and what's wrong.  And, well, that's like, I don't think they should be looked at as heroes.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, they're not heroes, they're --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they're just excellent players.
L:  I would say they're somebody with an exceptional skill.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know --
R:  And, uh --
L: -- that they're able to -- to expand on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  And -- and really perfect.  But, u- maybe there should be something in there, you know, that kinda says, you know, "If you're going to play and you're making all this money, you have to give back".
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  That -- I mean, that should be part of the -- part of the athletic creed, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you're going to play and you're going to make all this money, you have to come back into your neighborhoods and teach these kids that have this -- that little bud of talent --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, how to expand on it, how to -- how to work with it and make it grow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  I know we have --
L:  And so do and some, you know -- some say, "Screw ya".
R:  Yeah.  We have one that, uh, come out of Apoca[?] in Florida --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, he's in the big leagues and, uh, he comes back every year and does for his community.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I'm seri- -- I mean, really does for the community --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, is really -- i- it's refreshing to see somebody come back and do it.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Instead of standing there saying, "Well, I'm not getting my raise this week.  So, I'm going to sit here and say, 'No, I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing'".
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  And, uh, that's -- it's almost as bad as the Police Department striking. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But, you know, I can see 'em -- and I -- I can see to a certain extent they all get together and they sit down and they say, "Okay.  This is how much we think our talent itself is worth for the actual skills that we're employing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and this is how much we feel we should be compensated for the time that we're away from our families" you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  The travel time and -- and all of that kind of stuff, and then you add in what it would cost for room and board and -- and what not --
R:  Hey, my husband was a truck dri- -- a cross country truck driver --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and he was gone five days a week.
L:  Oh, my goodness!
R:  And, uh, you know, um, we didn't get +compensated for it -- compen- --
L:  Yeah.  Compensated.
R:  There you go!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My ITs are getting in front of my [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
