L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  My name is Robert White.
R:  My name is Carolyn Champion.
L:  Well, glad to know you.
R:  Nice to speak to you.
L:  Are you, uh, satisfied with the airport security?
R:  We- -- I think so.  I don't do a lot of traveling, but I think -- I think they've, um, got it down pretty good.
L:  I think so.
R:  Maybe they can speed it up a little.
L:  By the way, what part of the country are you in?
R:  I'm in Anchorage, Alaska.
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, how about that.
R:  Where are you?
L:  I haven't been up there in years.
R:  Where are you?
L:  I'm in Portland, Oregon.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, my neighbors are gonna move to Portland pretty soon.
L:  Uh-huh.  You sound like a Southerner.
R:  Oh, I just came from Alabama about eight years ago.
L:  Uh-huh, [LAUGH] okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess I spotted you right then.
R:  I guess.  That's pretty far south.
L:  Say again?
R:  I said, "That is pretty far south", Alabama.
L:  Yes, about as far as you can get.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's -- that's interesting.  I've always been able to tell pretty well the part of the country people come from.
R:  Yeah, I -- I'm not real good at that.  I can tell if they're -- you know, have a Spanish accent or Italian or something like that.  Can't hear a southern accent at all.
L:  You can't?
R:  No --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- not unless it's fakey, you know, unless it's a put-on deal.  Actors and so forth can't do it and --
L:  What part of the country do you think I originally came from?
R:  Oh, jeeze.  I have no idea.  You probably ca- --
L:  Well, I'm a mid-westerner.
R:  Oh, Oklahoma?
L:  Iowegian.
R:  [LAUGH] Do what?
L:  From Iowa.
R:  Iowa?  Okay.
L:  Yep.  Well --
R:  Well --
L:  -- you know, uh, I suppose we're supposed to stay to the --
R:  Subject at hand, right [LAUGH].
L:  Subject at hand.  The only thing that bothers me about, uh, the airport security, and this is perhaps just kind of sour grapes, is they make me take my shoes off.
R:  [LAUGH] Just make sure your socks don't have holes in 'em.  Uh, I hope they get it so they can speed it up and still be, um, a- uh, what am I trying to say now?  You know, thorough.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Speed up the -- the process but be thorough about it.
L:  Well, yes, but it's interesting, I have a belt buckle --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- that's heavy metal and three times out of four is they'll spot it and I have to take it off and so forth --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but why don't they catch it every time?
R:  I don't know, but I -- I have a wheelchair -- I use a wheelchair and they catch it every time [LAUGH], you know --
L:  Yes, I would [LAUGH] think so --
R:  -- they make you [LAUGH] --
L:  That'd be pretty hard to miss.
R:  Right, they have me stand up and, you know, take the cushion out and all this kind of stuff and -- and it's a hassle but, you know, you -- you could let something slip through that way, you know, if you didn't check.
L:  Well, I agree with you that, uh, we should have good security.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Although it makes me dang mad that these characters over there are causing this.
R:  Right.  They're winning in a way.
L:  Yes, they are.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I'll tell ya, our press they sure give you a distorted idea of, uh, well of everything, but particularly the airport security and the situation in Iraq.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I am very much anti-media in that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they seem to, well, [COUGH] if you'll pardon my French, screw things up.
R:  Right, ambulance chaser type things --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and, uh, I've -- I have been listening a lot to -- of -- to Fox and, uh, they seem, I guess they are pro-Bush.  Maybe that's -- I'm not sure that's what it is, but they're trying to tell both sides of the issue.  They don't just do like so many of the others just, you know, it's -- we're just wasting our time, we didn't have any business over there and all of that kind of stuff and anybody that thinks it's okay for somebody to send in -- a hu- human being through a shredder, they need their head examined.  You know, I think we need to go over there and get rid of him and everybody else that thinks like that.
L:  Well, I have to agree with you.  I spent twenty years in the Navy, so [COUGH] I'm somewhat, uh, oriented toward our armed forces --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I can't understand why France and Germany and Russia were objecting to us going in there and getting rid of that character.
R:  Well, I don't know either.  Well, yes I do.  They were making money.
L:  There you go.
R:  And you bet if they make money then they don't want to bother it.  But, we've been having problems with France sin- -- at least since World War Two because my dad fought in World War Two and, boy, he didn't have anything good to say about the French.
L:   Well, I did too.  I'm eighty two, so, [COUGH] you can probably see I was of the right age for that --
R:  Right, mhm.
L:  -- and the French have been, oh, kind of like a spoilt child.
R:  Yes.
L:  Although, I have several good, uh, friends in France.
R:  Yeah, my husband has some good friends over there and I heard this one guy saying that the problem with France is it's becoming a Mu- -- another Muslim nation and so, you know, they don't like Americans.  They -- I don't know if a lot of, uh, Muslims are moving in or if a lot of the population is turning to Muslim -- the Muslim religion, or what's going on, but he was saying it's gonna be another Muslim nation in, you know, in a few years.
L:  Well, I don't think that that's going to be.  France is pretty much a -- a Roman Catholic country --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and at least of the native Frenchmen I don't think --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you're gonna get too many Muslims.
R:  Well, that's what I was saying, they may be moving in and over running the place.
L:  Well, speaking of moving in, I saw figures the other day that there's about seven million Muslims in this country.
R:  Yeah, but then a lot of the nati- -- you know, a lot of our people, turned to that religion.  I mean, some have come in but then we've got, you know, people that are just changing religion and go- and going to the Muslim religion.  They see -- they --
L:  Well, I don't know too many, um --
R:  Well, the most famous one I know is Moham- Mohammed Ali.  He's -- and then I've heard other people, just in conversation why -- it's a peace-loving religion so they -- they go to that.  And it may be a peace-loving religion but the people that are, um, well, they don't stand behind it, you know, like they're over there fighting us right now and they inst- -- well they came over here and blew up two buildings and killed so many people, well those guys were Muslims and they're not practicing what they preach.
L:  Well, although, you know we're Christians, or most of us are.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, uh, we do the same things, but I think that, um, the point is well taken that these people are not practicing their religion.
R:  Right, and --
L:  But I'm not worried about the, uh -- my personal safety --
R:  I'm not either.  They could --
L:  I tell you I've lived long enough that if I go tomorrow I figure I've had a good run and that's it.
R:  And yeah and you'd probably -- and be better off in the -- in the interim, you know, you'd just be better off if --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in the end than you are gonna -- than you are on earth putting up with those guys.  I don't believe you're gonna have to deal with them if you go to heaven.
L:  Well, since I don't believe in either heaven or hell --
R:  [LAUGH] Well --
L:  -- I guess I -- I'm worried about now.
R:  Yeah.  Well --
L:  But, uh --
R:  -- you're getting close to the end you might really think about that heaven and hell --
L:  Well --
R:  I guess you've been doing that for years but, you know, the closer you get to the e- -- to, you know, being at one place the other, you might, uh, start looking at it bit m- more and trying to figure it ...
