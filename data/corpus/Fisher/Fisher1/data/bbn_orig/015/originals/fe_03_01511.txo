L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, um, my name is Christie Shutsie[?].
R:  Yeah, my name is Sherry Biers[?].  
L:  Um, what do you do? 
R:  Oh, I just, ah, work part time in a bank.  And you?
L:  I'm, um, a first year graduate student.
R:  Oh, okay.  And, ah, --
L:  Have -- have you changed anything since September eleventh? 
R:  Well, I never cared to fly too much and that kind of altered it completely that I haven't did that since then.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, ah, like I say, when the different warnings of, you know, came up during those times, ah, get more apprehensive and cautious of things that, you know, that you do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Different times there has been different alerts and that and wa- watch the -- the news quite more, you know, like in a -- get to be a little more like watching before where I didn't as much, you know, Fox news and different news channels to keep up on, you know, if there's anything that seems suspicious where you're just not quite as, ah, carefree, maybe.
L:  Yeah.
R:  As you normally would have been.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you?
L:  Um, yeah, I -- I -- I guess I've -- my, um, this [inaudible] changed has faded a little bit. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  With time, it's gotten --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- less, ah, prominent but I -- originally I was, um, more afraid to fly.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, but I'm not so much af- I -- I -- I don't like flying anyway so I can't really distinguish any more if it's because of that or -- 
R:  Well, yeah, that's what I mean too, because I didn't anyway, so, but then kind of was put a little bit more, you know, but, ah, ... 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where, I mean, now -- like I say, the different -- I don't know what proximity in the United States you are, but we're in an area that I would say it's a little closer to where things happened in Pennsylvania and so it made a lot of things more, oh, a little closer, you know, to home, some of the things that were happening, the anthrax, a few things -- 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- and, you know, even at a college near us, were left and right there for a while that was really, you know, keeping everybody on their toes and wasn't that far from where the one plane went down, like, maybe about ninety miles.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, my, um, my mom is really concerned especially when they had the, um, [LIPSMACK] the orange warning for the first time and we're having news broadcasts about -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Ah, 'cause they live in the DC area.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So she was worried, um, -- she's worried that they're the -- one of the main targets so she went out -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and bought all the plastic sheeting and duct tape and the, you know, emergency -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- food supplies and -- 
R:  Well, yeah, we got close to, you know, thinking -- I mean, we have stuff on hand that's similar to that, but, ah, we, you know, I can -- like I say, that crossed our minds, ah, you know, getting those things on hand even, you know, for this last time, you know, that's when it went on to, right before the war when it went on to orange, yeah, uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But, ah, like I said, it'd just -- even though you think well this is just another -- there's still just that little inkling there maybe, [LAUGH] because actually right after it happened we had a trip planned -- it happened, let's say on September eleventh and we, ah, were set up to go to Myrtle Beach which would have been the twenty fourth and we, you know, [inaudible] of course, it was going to be a driving trip with another couple and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, and we -- we -- we were there and it was funny, we -- we were near an army surplus store and we conned a -- the other -- the other couple, the girl to go in and just ask [LAUGH] about gas masks.  I mean, you know, where normally you would have thought, "Oh, my word, what a silly thing to do", you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it was right within like I say about ten days or so from happening and, you know, and course they says, "Well, it just -- it wouldn't much help you anyways unless you had it right with you all the time because sometimes you only get seconds" and since most -- a lot of the ones they sell anyways don't have all the right, maybe the filters or this or that so unless you have a new state of the art like the army [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Now, I look back at it I think, "Oh, dear", you know, but at that time right after that, yeah, we -- but it -- it does give everybody a little different food thinking and you did before, like you say, you get lax and nothing happens and you get less cautious. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  Yeah, you do, and -- and, um, I was actually living in Africa when it happened so it was --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- strange because the impact was a little less for --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was still a big impact but it was all, um, I didn't have very much access to TV so --
R:  Right.
L:  I couldn't see --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- what was happening.  It was more, ah, -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- BBC news coverage but then I came home about, ah, two months after -- after it happened and every -- everywhere I went there were flags.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  American flags on cars.
R:  Probably looked different, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and that -- that -- that made -- I saw the -- started seeing the flags in a different way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And when I saw that, it -- it -- it was very moving.
R:  Well, it brought people all kind of together here in a different sense.  Maybe where people were more, oh, you know, wouldn't look at you twice normally or more -- everybody to themselves and I'm going about my business and made people, you know, camaraderie there where everybody was a little more, you know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- friendlier like, ah, but, you know, like, if you had to fly home then a couple of months after that, that was kind of scary for the first time or?
L:  Yeah, it was -- yeah, that was definitely a little more scary than usual -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  --  for me.  Um, but -- but now with -- now as -- the way I see all those flags around -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- has changed since then, um, because they -- they've been, um, like my bank, um, had -- the, ah, bank card that I -- that I got when I moved, um, to Philadelphia had, um, has a American flag on it and that makes me -- doesn't give me -- [LAUGH] give me the same feeling as it did when I saw all the flags when I came home because it's clear a American flag on a Visa card is a much different message and that I don't [inaudible] um, so some- sometimes I feel like that it has been used too much.
R:  Well, I know what you mean.  There are some of the ones you mean like businesses are taking advantage of throwing, um, how would you say it, what's happened or an emblem of it into their buy -- buy -- making it their slogan.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Rather than the genuine- genuineness of what it was, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's a misuse of the flag.
R:  Yeah, that's kind of -- yeah, like I say, it's just like they say, even -- I don't know, I don't know how true it is but Pepsi had a -- somebody had passed on the internet there that, "Oh, they're coming out with a kind of an American type Pepsi can and they're going to have the Pledge of Allegiance on it" but not to, um, to offend their employees they were going to have the Pledge of Allegiance on it but take out the words "under God".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, so they're even kind of using the situation to advertise their product.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I mean, you know, there's -- like I say, there's -- after it's happened, there's -- there's as many people as it brought together there's probably a lot that, how would you say it, took advantage of the situation that happened too, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Maybe in getting, ah, people more scared like, well, you know, you buy -- like you -- buy this and that to protect yourself and you don't know, you know, they're really making money off of it more than helping you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, I didn't -- well, maybe you travel and you would have had different shots and that like a smallpox shot, wouldn't you, being in Africa or not?
L:  They -- no, they didn't give us smallpox shots.
R:  Didn't you?
L:  No.
R:  But I know now they're becoming available.  Of course, I guess they're just to the health workers now.
L:  Would you get -- 
R:  I -- 
L:  Would you consider getting --
R:  I -- I don't -- 
L:  -- one or -- 
R:  I don't know.  See, I'm at an age where I believe when I was in school I think I had one but I don't think -- I don't think really it's something that lasts that long, you know, as we're -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Before they stopped giving them, you know --
