R:  Hi, my name is Samantha. [NOISE]
L:  Hi, my name is Marilyn Writh[?] 
R:  Hi.  How are you this evening?
L:  Good.
R:  Good.  Um, we're supposed to be speaking about the strikes of professional athletes which I believe is just a cry for attention to get more pub- publicity and get their names out and to make people end up paying them more attention so that they make more money and just media time.
L:  Um, I tend -- I tend to think it's probably the same thing.  Ah, I think they're completely overpaid but at the same time, um, what they do, their talent I guess, ah, is hard to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- hard to duplicate, so, um, is it worth -- is that type of uniqueness actually worth as much?  I don't think so. I think there's not --
R:  I don't either, and the fact that they were to strike over something as petty as most of them do just doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever.
L:  Yeah, I agree.  I mean, if -- if we didn't have the type of, I guess entertainment, it's not going to affect world peace, it's not going to affect any type of economic situation, um. 
R:  Exactly, it's purely entertainment.
L:  Yeah, ah, so I agree.  I don't think it's actually something that's necessary.  Um, I mean, yes, they'd have to support families and such like that but we are also supporting them with not worth two million, three million, four million, contracts per year so -- 
R:  Right.
L:  Um, [NOISE] --
R:  I mean, I find myself [NOISE] watching many sports but it's not for purpose of to see who strike that day or who did whatever, it's purely an entertainment.
L:  Yeah, it is.  Um, I mean, th- th- there's some of course people that they employ in terms of the, um, stadiums and such and they do have, um, -- their job depends upon the performance, the -- actually events happening, um, but it is -- most of them are I think the type of labor where it can be [MN] found anywhere else.
R:  Right.
L:  So, um, we can't be found as maybe a manager of a team and such, but again, how hard is that?  I don't know, and --
R:  And I see other people losing out because when one person strikes, that's another that doesn't make their money for the day.
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  So it's not fair to them in that respect just because somebody is whining about something they didn't get or something that they want that's really just not even within reason.
L:  Yeah, and --  and it's -- it's also very irresponsible, the fact that they don't -- they didn't take that in consideration.  It's -- it's more what I'm not getting as opposed to, well, what can I be giving --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if I just take two million a year as a salary as opposed to three? 
R:  Because there are athletes that contribute so much to different charities or events but then there's the ones that complain constantly because they're not getting, but they're not giving anything to get anything back.
L:  [MN] Yes, I agree.  Um, I agree and it's -- it's -- I know, it's just [SIGH] the -- most of the, ah, who I find or what I understand from the professional athletes is, you know, their goals were mostly to play the sport and not obtain so- any kind of education as well, so, um, if their livelihood is dependent upon them actually performing --
R:  Right.
L:  Then I don't think they should bite the hand that feeds them also, and it tends to actually al- also upset the -- the [MN] fans, ah, and I think in the way that we're upset at them.
R:  Right, and there are die hard fans that are determined to go to this game or that game because it's important to them.  They lose among many other people.
L:  Yeah, but I think also with that type of situation, though, if, um, you know, I think it's something that they're upset about at first.
R:  Right.
L:  But I -- unlike other sorts of events, um, they'll get over it.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  
L:  And it will -- it will just -- okay, well, it's just the way it is now and go on with life and we'll bowl as opposed to go to a game, um, or do something else.  So what I think sometimes the athletes don't realize is that [NOISE] you have some die hard fans but you're not a cult, it's not a -- a following to the point where they're going to -- these people are just going to lay their lives out for you.
R:  Yes, it's not a necessity.
L:  No.
R:  By any means.
L:  No, not at all, not at all.  So with them striking and, you know, you'd think some of the families would get involved -- their families and tell them how ridiculous they're being but maybe their families are actually pushing them to make more money.
R:  And are just as money hungry as they are.
L:  Right.
R:  Because they get tied into these big homes and expensive cars and jewellery and whatever else.
L:  Exactly.
R:  It's hard to let go.
L:  And, you know, with that, I find interesting also the ones that, you know, there's very few athletes that are just really exceptional.
R:  Right.
L:  Like the Michael Jordans or the, um, -- or the whatever in baseball but, you know, I -- I think maybe a- as the pay scale I guess they do get paid more than the average, but the average who might not hit a ball all season, will make a million.
R:  Right.
L:  And exactly what did you do besides nothing?
R:  They are the first ones to complain. 
L:  Exactly. [NOISE]
R:  Because you don't hear of any Michael Jordans or Tiger Woods or anybody like that complaining.
L:  No, they don't because they're good. 
R:  And they're the true stars.
L:  Right, right. 
R:  You see them, the newspapers have them.  It's all over the internet but some no name new guy will be the first one to stand up and say, "Well, this isn't fair".
L:  Right.
R:  "I need more, I want more".
L:  For doing nothing.
R:  Right.
L:  Hasn't hit a ball all season, hasn't caught anything all season, has not made a play all season and also, though, something else, it is a season.  It's not a year time -- a -- a full-time job.
R:  Right.
L:  They perform during [NOISE] I think two months out of the year, the rest are in some kind of training camp.
R:  Or doing nothing.
L:  Or doing nothing and, ah, teachers who only have three months off, do not get -- get -- get paid for those three months then.
R:  Right, they're left to fend.
L:  They are the essence of our -- of our society, so I -- it's just -- I think it's very -- ah, it just makes them look like very poor -- they have poor character, they have poor, um, judgement.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And it's just greed.
R:  It is.  I agree one hundred per cent because I could see teachers complaining or anybody else that has to fend for themselves for this many months out of the year to make money to feed their families.  These other people have money handed to them and they still complain.
L:  Exactly.  I mean, look at even the airline industry where the pilots, mechanics and stewardess who are professionals at --  at -- and actually have a very, um, um, specific trade that they do.  They took a cut in order to keep their -- their industry moving.
R:  Right.
L:  And keep their jobs.  And these people --
R:  But I see that as being a devotion where a lot of these sports players fall into something.  They became a high school star which moved them to being a college star.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And all this ego.  It's a complete ego trip.  They are told, "You're the best in high school" and may have been mediocre in college and then end up getting a pro job and then that's it.
L:  And then there's nothing else for them to do.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, or to become sports announcers. 
R:  Because they haven't gone to college or anything.  They skid through college just to be able to play these sports.
L:  That's right, that's right, and their -- and their skills as in writing, reading, mathm- mathematics is just poor.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And -- and they have no where else to go at that point if something happens and then they have the gall to strike and ask for money when they have no other skills unlike these other professionals who have very specific skills, very needed skills, um, are taking pay cuts.
R:  Right.
L:  To keep their industry moving.
R:  And to keep themselves going.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because you have to look at it from an inside kind of place where you could see, well, if they don't have a job, their families stave to death.
L:  Right.
R:  They lose their homes, they have nothing, so you take the pay cut to feed the mouths in your house.
L:  And I think also a lot of it has to do with the fact that, ah, unlike, baseball, if the airline industry fails, business starts to fail.
R:  Right.
L:  Where you need to go to seminars and meet -- have meetings and such.
R:  Then everybody -- 
L:  Suffers for that.
R:  Right.
L:  It trickles down where if there's not a baseball game, oh, well.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's the end of that.
R:  Too bad.
L:  Yeah, and, all right, well, we'll watch Seinfeld today, you know, it's -- it's --it's not significant. [NOISE] What else?  I had another point and I forgot about it.
