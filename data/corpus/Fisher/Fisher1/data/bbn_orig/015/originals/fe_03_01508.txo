L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name is Herb.
R:  Herb?  
L:  Yes.
R:  Hi, I'm Amy. [NOISE]
L:  Hi, Amy.
R:  Hi, where you from?
L:  Um, I live, uh, like Fur Rock or Oaklands, right out --
R:  Oh, right outside of Philadelphia?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, okay. 
L:  Where you from?
R:  Um, I'm actually -- I got to Temple University.
L:  Oh okay, I went there myself.
R:  You did?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are you not there anymore?
L:  No, I graduated a couple of years ago.
R:  Oh, what did you graduated from -- for?
L:  Um, what did I go to school for?
R:  Oh, yeah, what, uh, major?
L:  Um, real estate.
R:  Okay.  Okay, that's cool.  I'm in a English major.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  All right, so, um, I'm sorry my roommate was talking and the topic was -- what was it?  The --
L:  Um, September eleventh.
R:  Okay.
L:  And they wanted to know what, if any, changes we had made --
R:  [NOISE] [MN]
L:  -- um, I guess in our lifestyles since then.
R:  Ah, okay.  Um, well, jeeze, I haven't even really even thought about something like that but, uh, how about you?  Like what about you?
L:  Um, I don't know if I've made any changes.  I know one of the things that maybe I've done a little differently is, um, um, my son -- I have a son and his mother lives in New York --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, he lives with and I know -- I guess the only thing we have done differently is, um, right when it happened of course he, uh -- and I guess it kinda changed the frequency that I took him up there to visit.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, like right after it happened, of course, like the city was almost like cordoned off so it was just kinda hard --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to get up there so we didn't, uh, make any trips there for probably two or three months afterwards.
R:  Oh yeah?  How old is your son?
L:  Um, he's eight.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, he, um, he has been living with me since he was born and, uh, even now it's st- -- like while the war was going on I know I was a little leery about taking him up there.  When the war first started, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I didn't know what to expect, if there was going to be any terrorist attacks or --
R:  Right.
L:  Um, even the demonstrations, I guess, uh, kind of kept me from going up there so I -- I was kinda like waiting to see --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what would happen before I took him to New York.
R:  Rea- -- oh wow.  Well, I guess that is kind of a difficult choice make.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Especially.  Um, well I don't really have anything that particular -- I don't have any family that lives up there so, um, really what it was for me is I didn't know what happened until --
L:  Right.
R:  -- halfway through the day 'cause I was at classes.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  And so after it happened my roommate at the time told me about it and she -- um, nobody really was relating to what actually happened.  We were all just kinda like, "Okay" you know, maybe like when that bomb went off, like, back in the early nineties?
L:  Right.
R:  We all kinda thought it was something like that.
L:  Right.
R:  And she eventually was like, "No, it's not there any more, you  know, it's gone".  And it pretty much hit me in the sense though -- it was really -- it was just kinda like something that was surreal and you really had to think closely of who was the most important people in your life because you don't know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when they're gone.
L:  Right.
R:  Just as, you know, you would have that decision to have to make about your son and -- and it is like decisions where you had to put more thought into things so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's kinda how it was for me.
L:  Okay.
R:  So -- and I haven't -- I've been up there -- I just was up there a few weeks ago so it was the first time I'd been there since --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- since it happened.
L:  Right.
R:  But, uh -- so, um, you know, I really can't say that there's much of a change I would --
L:  Right.
R:  -- have particularly made but just the fact that it was something that ever since then, you know, you hear nine eleven or something like that and you know exactly what it is and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it's a thing that everybody can relate to now.
L:  Yeah, and I --
R:  So --
L:  -- I think it something that, um -- it's funny like almost everyone you know in some way either knew someone or like they can tell you a story.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I know for me personally I had a friend I went to school with, he went to Temple also, and, uh, he had, um, developed kidney failure --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- maybe four or five years back --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so he had to wait for transplant for years and, uh, I remember his mom called me the -- September twelfth, early in the morning --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and she said that, uh, Lonnie's in the hospital and they -- she said that they think they found a kidney for him.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  And right away the first thing came to my mind I thought, "Uh-oh, I bet it was someone who -- who died in nine eleven".
R:  Right.
L:  And sure enough it was.  It was a -- a guy his age, a young guy, who had worked in the World Trade Center.
R:  Wow, that's really touching.
L:  And -- yeah, so I guess that, I guess, always is on my mind like I can't help but when I see him sometimes I just think about that and wow, he's -- you know, some- someone -- he's directly affected --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- by what happened --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, on September eleventh.
R:  Like in so many bad things there was somebody's angel.
L:  Right, right, exactly.
R:  Like they didn't know it was gonna happen and somebody was there to --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, in that kind of way, I kinda -- you know when I look at him --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think, "Wow, you know, your life changed or was extended because --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- of someone else's, you know, ended that day".
R:  Exactly.  Wow, I never even thought of it as something like that 'cause, you know, right after it happened everyone was giving blood and stuff --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and, like, it just kinda passed over my head that -- like I gave my blood and I just kinda felt it was something that people did, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just bec- -- out of the pure benefit and like the fact that it was so touching right away and, wow, you see I never actually have heard a story like that, you know, that it was -- it was actually something -- as sad as it was something good came through.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, is your friend okay now?  Is he doing better?
L:  Yeah, he's -- he's almost -- I mean it was ironic because the kidney he got was almost like a perfect match for him.  Like a lot of times, you know, they -- you -- your body can reject th- -- you know, somebody else's organ but in his case they were amazed.  They just thought that, um, the person may have been related to him it was so close.  I mean they couldn't tell him who it came from but, uh --
R:  Really?
L:  -- they were able to let him, like, write a letter to the family --
R:  Oh good.  I was gonna ask that.
L:  -- just thank 'em and stuff like that.  And they just, uh, gave to 'em like anonymous- anonymously but, uh --
R:  Oh good.
L:  Yeah, so that's something that I -- I always think about every time I -- I see him.
R:  Yeah.  That is something.  It's something I think a lot of people think about and even today, like, with the fact that there's a war and, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the terrorist in itself that people just continuously, like, can relate to what actually happened to us 'cause, I think, uh, Americans themselves underestimate what --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what we -- how powerful we really are --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and how a simple, like, blink can take away so -- so much --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that we're not as powerful because, you know, we're -- we're weaker than we probably think we are.
L:  Right.
R:  So, do you have any friends over -- across seas or anything or ...?
L:  No, uh-uh.  I had -- only had one friend who was in the military but he's -- he's back.  He was in Japan for a little while --
R:  Oh okay.
L:  -- but now he's back here.
R:  Oh good.
L:  You know, one thing I did, uh, think of too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, just, uh, on another topic which is, I think, the one thing that has happened is, um, flying habits.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, like right afterwards, you know, I didn't fly for a while --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I've -- I've gotten back to flying regularly now but I know that I'm just, I guess, how earl- -- how often or ho- how early I get to the airport stuff like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That has changed.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, and also, um, I guess being a little bit more, like, alert or, you know, it's funny 'cause the first time flew after that, like, I could just feel that everybody's on the plane like looking at everybody else like, "Mm".
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know what I mean like ...?
R:  I had the exact same problem actually.
L:  Right, uh --
R:  Where do you -- do you fly a lot, like around?
L:  Pretty much.
R:  Okay.
L:  Like back and forth to Miami, um, California, places like that.  I -- I had -- the job I have now like will send me to different places so --
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, I mean, I'm comfortable about it, it never really bothered me that w- -- but I know that, you know, right away if I just had, uh, always looking at people a little differently or ...
R:  Right. Right.
L:  Or wondering like, you know, okay we'll what are -- even it -- it crosses your mind.  Like even on a plan- -- okay, well if someone were to try do something what would I do?  Would I --
R:  Exactly.  
L:  -- would I try --
R:  Like how would you get out of it?
L:  Yeah, would I try to react or help out or ...?
R:  I was the same way.  Actually, I didn't even think about that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but that's like a perfect thing.
L:  Right.
R:  I had -- I went to, um, last year, two thousand two I went to Rome for spring break and when I was coming back, uh, I was on the plane and they had an hour delay because one of the bags wasn't checked.
L:  Okay.
R:  Like it went through.
L:  Right.
R:  And immediately I just -- I -- when I was waiting to get on the plane they had to stop a man 'cause he was trying to get on.
L:  Okay.
R:  And immediately it was, like, ran through my head like where is this guy --
L:  Right.
R:  -- is on our plane, you know, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that is something that -- it's just something that you think about in the back of your head but I didn- -- it didn't even occur to me until you just said something now that there really is -- like, we're more cautious of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- how things go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Huh.
L:  That's something I -- I can- -- like even now I -- I just can't help but think about it.  You know just the way they -- it's not as bad as when it first was but it's just the way that you have to go through these checks now and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, even when I -- when -- um, I fly with my son a lot too and even one time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I was flying with him and the- -- and just the scrutiny that they went over him and, you know, that had never happened before.
R:  Right.
L:  Like they were, like, asking to take his shoes off because what they do is it seems like I guess, um, every so many people they randomly have to just stop, whoever the person is.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, they give you old person, young person in his case.  And I was, you know, annoyed because they were like putting him through all this and I guess I was trying to understand and be understanding --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I just thought they were just, uh --
R:  At the same time it's like an eight year old kid [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, exactly.  And they were like being insensitive 'cause he was like, you know, "Dad" you know, and they were like kinda keeping me away from him --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I'm like, "Okay, well I don't you doing it but let me stay near so he knows 'cause he doesn't know, you know, exactly what's going on" so --
R:  Exactly.  Like he's not used to that.
L:  Right, right.  So, he was kinda like -- you know, he wasn't crying but he was looking like, "Okay, well why ar- -- what are they doing to me?"
R:  Right.
L:  So, uh, that part is a lot different so I know that even now I'm always kinda like "Oh well, I hope I don't have to -- I hope he's not the person that gets picked" or either one of us because I don't even like him to have to stand and watch them, you know, like make me go through that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- while he's like away from me for a little bit.
R:  Has he, um, changed in any way, like now that you have -- you're more cautious about traveling him and bring him up to New York stuff, do you feel like he's changed at all?
L:  Um, a little bit.  I -- I know that when it happened -- for him, he was old enough to know, I guess he was six then, and he knew -- uh, the first thing he came home from school, they sent the kids home early from school that day, even here in Philadelphia.
R:  Yes.
L:  And he came home and he -- the first thing he told me was that he had cried.  He said, uh, they said that, um, um, something in New York had blown up.  And, you know, they not realizing how big New York is, the first thing he thought was, "Oh, I hope my mom- -- my mommy wasn't hurt" so --
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I assured him that she wasn't -- she worked nearby but not, you know, close enough to be -- to be directly affected --
R:  Oh good.
L:  -- by it.  
R:  Good.
L:  But, uh, I was explaining to him that she was fine and, of course, we can't talk to her that day 'cause the phone lines --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- I mean, you couldn't even call in New York, it was bad for a while.  But I noticed that, uh, he was aware of that and I know, even now, he -- whenever the mention anything about terrorists or anything that's the first thing he thinks of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or he'll mention, "Uh, is my mom okay?" or, you know, it -- it -- did you talk to her, or, you know, did she call?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I guess he -- he does think about it a long those lines but, uh -- I gu- -- he understands, like I always try to point out to him, like, we're gonna, you know, be more careful about when we travel and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just to -- maybe the way we travel.  Like before a lot of times I would go up on the train and things like that and sometimes now I'll --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- drive just to be a little bit in control of like mov- moving around.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I guess that -- that has affected me a little bit too.  So, um -- and I think he was fine, as a matter of fact, like I said, other ...
