L:  Hello.
R:  Hello?
L:  Yes.
R:  Hi.  My name is May.
L:  Oh, hi.  My name is Tim.
R:  Tim?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hey.  Um, I didn't really hear the question.  What was it?
L:  It was about ...
R:  The topic.
L:  -- uh, do you think airport security will, uh, lessen the threat of terrorism?  I think.
R:  Uh-huh.  Is that --
L:  I think that's what it was.
R:  -- that meaning here?
L:  Uh, I've, huh, I have no idea.  Just that's -- that was just the basic question.  Is what -- how you think --
R:  R- --
L:  -- a- a- airport security will, uh, lessen the threat of terrorism.
R:  Oh, right.  Okay.  Um, so where you calling from?
L:  I'm from Dallas.
R:  Okay.
L:  What about you?
R:  Me too.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  Have you ever done this before?
L:  No, I've never done this.
R:  Yeah.  I done one. 
L:  Oh, right.
R:  I think they just use the people that -- that live in our -- our area and to talk.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  'Cause right now I'm -- I'm, um, seventy five.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Anyway, um, okay, so airport security.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Right.  Do you wanna go first?
L:  Um, I'll let you to go first, so I can just see how it goes.  Huh.
R:  Okay.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, the -- I mean, it doesn't mat- really matter, they're just listening to what we're saying.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, okay.  So, uh, I think it sort of lessens terrorism and it does 'cause see, they go through, you know, people's crap.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [inaudible] as well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because every single time I go through there they have to shove me over and search through all my shit that I've folded so nicely.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [several inaudible words] okay.  And so, um, it's really annoying.  I mean, but I guess it's --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's safer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I guess it's cool that it's safer, but just every single time it's kind of annoying.
L:  Yeah.  [MN]
R:  I don't know.  Have you gone through any of those experiences?
L:  Um, yeah, the same thing has happened to me like -- I mean, if you like -- you have to, like, have your stuff with you all the time.  I mean like, if I've left -- leave it behind for like, one second they'll be like, "Oh, you're gonna get that and we've gotta check through everything" and like, they had to go through my stuff and all that, you know?
R:  Yeah, I know.  I have to go through that next week 'cause I'm gonna fly again and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I know that they're gonna shove me over to the side and I'm gonna be like "Excuse me".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I asked them one time why they kept -- just keep shoving me over.
L:  Ah.
R:  And they said, "Oh, it's -- it's random.  You just happen to be the lucky winner every time".
L:  Oh, it -- it --
R:  Like, I'm sure it is.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, really?  I didn't know they do that.
R:  No, I -- I doubted it.  I -- I doubt it.  I think it's just the way I look and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they're like, "Mm, she's shifty looking".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] I don't know.
L:  That's crazy.
R:  [LAUGH] It's [inaudible] it's crazy, I don't know.
L:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I'm a total sweetie.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] But -- um --
L:  Hello?
R:  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  So, are y- -- what, how old are you?
L:  I'm eighteen.
R:  Oh, you're eighteen.  Okay.
L:  What about you? 
R:  I'm twenty one.
L:  Oh, really?  That's cool.
R:  Yeah.  So ...
L:  Where do you -- what school do you go to?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, I just graduated.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Um, yeah, I just graduated from South West.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Yeah.  So, now I'm not doing anything.  But, um --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
R: -- but that's why I'm gonna go next week -- I'm gonna go to New York next week and go to, um, job interviews and stuff like that.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  So, hopefully I can get a job.
L:  Oh, [MN] that's cool.
R:  But then again I'm annoyed that I have to be at the airport for --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  More hassle.
R:  -- oh, God, an hour and a half early.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I missed my flight last time and it pissed me off.
L:  'Cause of the whole security thing or ...?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Oh, my God!  Are you kidding?
R:  'Cause the security took way too long and I was like, "Uh, my flight's leaving" and ...  I mean, I got there --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- a little bit later, but still.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, like, that's ridiculous.
R:  Had -- had they not searched through all my crap and had the lines not been so insanely long I would've got on my plane and left.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But no.
L:  Oh, my gosh!  That's crazy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've never really had that much of a problem with it.  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hm.
R:  How often do you fly?
L:  I mean, I don't fly that often.  But like, maybe four or five times a year.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, have you flown since -- this past year or anything?
L:  Yeah, I did, and, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they really -- they really didn't do anything.  I don't know.
R:  Ah.
L:  Nothing like -- nothing too ran- -- like, nothing out of the ordinary.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Seemed like the same sort of usual.
R:  Uh, it's just always the lines are always way longer to me now and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they have to check your ID five times or whatever like, you know, when you first go in and when you get on the plane and when you're about to get on the plane, and it's annoying.
L:  Really?  Yeah.  They didn't -- they didn't do all that.  Like, for me, I mean, I went like, uh, the Christmas after nine eleven and like, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- nothing really hap- -- 'cause I g- -- I got my tickets from online and I guess -- so, I had like, an electronic thing.  They didn't do --
R:  Uh-huh.
L: -- they only checked my ID like, as I was going through baggage claim and then when I was like, giving my -- giving my ticket.  That was the only time they checked my ID.
R:  Yeah.  I think it was like, uh, they're on ex- uh, they got in trouble like, a -- a few weeks earlier when I went, I think.
L:  Ah.
R:  Like, one of the times I went and flew somewhere --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so they were [MN] like, security Nazis.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  But, I mean, I guess it does [MN] -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, to get back on the subject, I guess it lessens terrorism because they go through all that crap.  But, I mean, I -- I've --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I remember, uh, hearing something about how some guy got on the plane with a couple of knives.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like, oh, hey!
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's kinda scary.
R:  So, maybe they just get tired and -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  I guess it's kinda worth --
R:  It's kinda --
L:  -- worth all the stuff, the extra stuff that they do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  And ... just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- way longer on my time, damn it!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, yeah ...
L:  I mean, to the extent that you miss your flight that -- that kinda sucks.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it does.  Total loss!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, yeah, the last time I did this one I did, uh, a little survey thing like, uh, the other week.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they, um -- and I talked to some random girl in Irving and she -- and we had to talk about how nine eleven affected us.  So, I think we -- all these little survey things have to do --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- with like, terrorism and crap like that.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And nine eleven and, uh, the plight of it, and --
L:  Oh, all right.
R:  -- how it affects us.  So, that's what ...
L:  Oh, [inaudible] I was talking to my sister, she said something about like, they -- they ask you about nine eleven, and they'll ask you about like, your opinion on like, uh, TV, uh, reality TV shows and stuff.
R:  Oh, I haven't gotten any of that yet.
L:  Oh, you haven't gotten that, oh.
R:  I mean, I do other surveys --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like, not for this, but I usually do other random surveys online and stuff --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that I get money for.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's for all sorts of crap, but --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- for this one mainly that's what I'm thinking that's all it is.  They're getting our opinions --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- on crap.
L:  Yeah, I guess so.
R:  Who told you about it?  Your sister?
L:  Uh, actually my friend from Austin.  [inaudible].
R:  Oh, yeah, mine too.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [MN]
R:  I used to live there.
L:  Oh, really?  That's cool.
R:  Um, yeah.  Then I graduated.  So, now I'm back here in Dallas.
L:  Oh, I see.  [LAUGH]
R:  On Six Seventy Five.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  That's cool.
R:  But, you know ...
L:  Like, have you made any -- have you made any -- any referrals yet or anything?
R:  For what?
L:  For this.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Uh, I made one.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So, that's a whole dollar for me.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, one dollar.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My friend got like, sixty bucks the other day.
R:  Damn!
L:  Yeah.  'Cause he like, he ...
R:  I thought we were only allowed to do three of these, um, calling things.
L:  Oh, I mean like, no.  Yeah, you get -- uh, but like, if you refer up to twenty people --
R:  Oh, that's right.
L:  -- and you -- you get like, twenty dollars plus an additional five dollars 'cause every ten people you get you get a bonus of five dollars.
R:  That's nice.  [SIGH]
L:  So you get a additional thirty dollars, plus the thirty for the phone calls.  So, yeah --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- I'm trying to get as many people --
R:  I bet they're gonna listen to ours and be like, these guys aren't talking about --
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  -- the subject.
L:  I guess so.
R:  So, that blows ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  I -- like [MN], um, I guess after this war thing, I don't know if it's gonna, uh, gonna lessen --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- or if it'll be more heightened.  I mean, I can't really tell the future.  I just know that it's annoying for me --
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.  
R:  -- because [SIGH] ...
L:  Huh.
R:  I'm of a different race and I have to go through ...  
L:  Uh, oh, what nationality are you?
R:  I'm Asian.
L:  Oh, [MN] well like, what kind?
R:  Um, I'm Chinese.
L:  Oh, you're Chinese?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's cool.  I'm -- I'm Indian.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, the last girl I talked to was, um, Indian as well.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mm.
L:  Do you know what her name was?
R:  No.
L:  Zetel[?] maybe?
R:  [MN] No, it was, um -- it was Jay.
L:  Oh, I know her.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, [several inaudible words] yeah.  And I remember that because -- the only reason why I remember that is because, um, i- it rhymes with mine.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  With my name.
L:  That's cool.
R:  I thought it was cute.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Anyway ...
L:  That's cool.
R:  So, yeah, I guess maybe they're -- they're pairing us up in, um -- by city and races and asking us stuff.
L:  Unreal.  I guess so.
R:  Oh, the lottery's thirty five million.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I should go buy a lottery ticket.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um ...
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know.
R:  Yeah, well -- well, I -- I'm driving so it's -- it's the [inaudible].
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Anyway --
L:  Cool.
R:  -- um, yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  What else?
R:  Okay.  I don't know.  [LAUGH]  How -- how long is ten minutes?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Wait, [inaudible] I'll have a look at my phone.
L:  Uh, how long has it been?
R:  Oh, we're almost there.
L:  Okay, cool.
R:  We have one more minute.
L:  All right, good! [LAUGH] 
R:  All right.  So, you haven't had any problems?
L:  No, not really.  
R:  I ...
L:  Th- [MN] -- I --
R:  And we both agree that -- well, I guess, as long as we come to a -- a decision.  Do we think that, uh, airport security, uh, lessens the risk of terrorism?  Yes or no?
L:  Well, they -- I think that airport security like, it's okay to have like, tightened security, I mean, just to ensure the safety of the passengers and stuff.  I mean, I don't -- I don't like, disagree with anything.  I'm -- I'm sure.  Um, I think it's a good thing to have.
R:  Yeah, it's a good thing I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah, I mean, all and all it is a good thing.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  Let's say that.  So -- so now they can write that down.  You guys can write that down now --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the research people that listen -- that are listening.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um ... and, um ...
L:  Um ...
R:  [MN]
L:  It's [several inaudible words] --
R:  Yeah, but it's always, uh, but it's always been the same, I -- I [several inaudible words], they do the same stuff, they go --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, scan -- they scan everybody the same.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just the random pickings of [inaudible] that they tick off.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, [several inaudible words].
L:  That was crazy -- did you hear about that thing where the guy had the bomb in his shoes and stuff?
R:  Oh yeah, in his shoe?
L:  Yeah, it's crazy.
R:  Yeah, that's -- see, that's ... when --
L:  Um --
R:  -- they go through me and see that nothing's wrong but then they don't -- they don't search the guy with the bomb in his shoe.
L:  I know, right.
R:  There's something wrong there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.
L:  [MN]
R:  So ... so --
L:  Yeah, it d- -- it seem --
R:  -- and you don't have any stories or anything?
L:  Uh-huh?  No, not really.
R:  You don't have any?  No?
L:  N- no.
R:  Nothing?  Uh.
L:  Not really.
R:  Yeah, I'm pretty much out --
L:  [LAUGH] Me too.
R:  -- when it comes to the ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I've told all I can tell about my annoying airport stories.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  On going through.
L:  Yeah, it's kinda --
R:  Every single time.
L:  Yeah.  It's kinda unsettling when you think they would -- if -- you -- you think they'd be able to find a guy's -- a b- -- like, bombs in this guy's shoes, but they didn't even find that.
R:  Yeah.  They made me take my shoes off, I remember that.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah, I was like, I [MN] whatever, for sure.  And --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So they would -- the -- like, not every single time but I
