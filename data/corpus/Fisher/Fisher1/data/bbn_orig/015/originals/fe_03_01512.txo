R:  Hi, my name is Cleaton Stiver[?], I'm from Nazareth, PA which is around Allentown, PA.
L:  Hi, I'm, uh, Neil Patel, I'm from Austin, Texas.  I got to school here at the University of Texas [inaudible].
R:  Oh, cool.  I'm going -- I'm currently going to school at Pen State University.
L:  Oh cool, cool.  Two big schools, right [LAUGH].
R:  Yes, yep.
L:  Yeah, so, uh, September eleventh now, huh?
R:  Yeah, yeah, um, actually it's kinda funny, I was just talking to someone earlier about the same topic but, uh, yeah, as far as, uh, affecting my life goes, um, it really hasn't changed it that much.  Uh, I'd say the biggest thing would be it's made me maybe be more aware of the events that are going aro- -- going on around the entire world.
L:  Very definitely, definitely.
R:  Um, uh, as far as flying goes, um, I'm really not that, you know, scared you could say or I -- you know, I'm not afraid of flying really from it, um, I mean the way I look at flying is I -- I still look at it as the safest way to travel and, uh, I'm also a devout Christian so, uh, the way -- the way I look at it too is, you know, if the good Lord wants to take my life well, then he must have a good reason for it and I'm not going to argue with him so so be it but, uh -- I mean I'll still get on a plane and -- if I have to and, uh -- well, I mean, I'll have maybe a slig- -- just bit of, you know, extra fear in the back of my mind --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- but, uh, overall it -- you know, I really haven't -- I haven't -- my life has not been changed that much from the events.
L:  Definitely.  I mean, um, [MN] I'm actually an Indian, uh, like from Indi- -- my parents are from India and that --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  I was born here in a American, in Dallas, but, uh, I mean other than getting some, you know, a little bit more hassle at the -- at the airports, you know, those -- they're pick on -- they're pick on anybody that looks, you know, Pakistani or --
R:  Right, so that must be --
L:  -- Persian --
R:  -- that might be, you know, tough for your parents or --
L:  That might be a little tough but, like, really, I mean I've -- that's happened to me a couple of times.  I've been searched a little extra --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- but like -- I mean other than that like outside the airport, I mean, honestly you're -- you're -- you hit it right on the head that you -- you're more aware of the events going on in the world.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know what I mean, there's -- before -- before, uh, nine eleven I didn't know where Kabul was, you know.  I didn't -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- if somebody asked me what Kabul was I would be -- I thought it would be a dish or something, you know, but -- [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, yep.
L:  But, uh, yeah it's made me more aware of the -- of the international issues.  I think it's like more important than some- sometimes, you know, like some -- you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it just -- it just makes you more educated, I think.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh -- yeah, I mean, it -- it's had its negative effects but, I think, it's made us more aware about the issues going on the world.
R:  Right.
L:  I guess.
R:  Yeah, and -- and I -- well, I'm also happy to see -- I mean I  -- I think overall security measures have -- they've -- they've really -- they've done a pretty good job with beefing up --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- the security.  I mean, you know, it might be -- I mean, you see, you to an airport now and it takes hours, you know, obvious to -- to search people.  I mean sometimes they say you have to take out all your belongings from your --
L:  Mhm.
R:   -- your, um, suitcase and whatnot --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, you know, the thing is -- I mean that's gonna make it more safe to fly so, you know, I -- I -- I wouldn't have a problem with that if it was gonna take me an extra two hours, um, at least I know that, uh, they're gonna -- I mean if somebody's gonna try and do something they're gonna catch 'em.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  It makes -- just -- it's just more safe, you know --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- I  -- I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just some security that you have.  I mean, really I am -- I am a little bit more wary of -- of -- of terrorist attacks, I mean not -- not -- not airplanes running into buildings --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- really but more sort of, you know, like, [several inaudible words] going on all these suicide bombs that --
R:  Right, yeah, exactly.
L:  That could happen --
R:  Yeah, they're gonna try and find other ways, yeah.
L:  -- at any time.  That could happen at any time and nobody would ever know about it.  It doesn't take much planning, it just takes some crazy guy, you know --
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  -- to pull the strings [LAUGH].
R:  Yep.
L:  And we're dead.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that's what I'm really just -- I fear but hopefully that won't happen 'cause the people are, I guess, [inaudible] like the terrorist organizations know where we'll find 'em so -- [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, yeah, exactly.
L:  [MN]
R:  I -- yeah, I think overall too with the -- the -- the organizations, um, within the Government that they're crea- -- obviously the homeland security thing was developed after, uh, you know, the September eleventh issue and I -- I think they've been doing a good job with, you know, trying to find every terrorist group out there or any possible connections with terrorist group and -- and taking care of them, you know, dealing with them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, that -- that makes, you know, that makes me more -- feel more safe as well, um, but that -- I mean, I -- if anything I -- I feel more securer, more safe now as opposed to more -- being more scared or, you know --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- after that event occurred, just because it's -- it's made, you know, so many -- so many of these people who deal with this stuff, you know, beef up their -- their -- their measures of controlling it.
L:  Yeah.  That sounds like -- I mean, what -- what do you feel about -- what do you feel -- how much are you willing to give up to -- to have just a little bit more security.
R:  Um, I'd be willing to give up a lot, I'd say, um, you know, it's, uh, if it means -- let me think.  Well --
L:  I mean, I ask because -- 'cause -- I mean as a -- as a minority here in America I mean I'm just -- I'm thinking -- I'm just more susceptible to -- people will find out.  I mean, I guess if -- if -- if the FBI want to find out who I really am they're know that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm -- I'm a -- I'm a Hindu American and I'm not a --
R:  Right.     
L:  -- I'm not a Muslim or anything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, I mean, I don't think that should be a way to profile people but I think that's -- I mean, it's -- the truth is -- it's -- it's -- it's -- it's Islamic fundamentalist, you know, and -- and terrorism extreme etcetera are the ones that are blowing up the cities and -- and, you know, crashes planes into buildings --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, I mean, the- they might be on the right side but I don't -- I don't think it's -- it's really right to say that.
R:  Right.
L:  They're the only ones that are capable of committing a terrorist attack --
R:  Oh exactly.
L:  I mean, Timothy McVeagh [LAUGH].
R:  I mean somebody that's, uh, a regular American, I mean, can d- -- can do what, uh, you know, those are the people overseas -- the -- the, um, for instance, Osama bin Laden and his group, you know.  He can -- somebo- somebody that's an American can do that exact same thing, um --
L:  Exactly, somebody that can -- for somebody that believes in Osama bin Laden ties, I mean --
R:  Exact- Mhm, yeah.
L:  I -- I think there's plenty of people here that are --
R:  Oh yeah, definitely.
L:  -- more pro Palestinian than [LAUGH] and, uh, especially at UT.  Austin is a really liberal campus and --
R:  Yeah, well that's the same here at Pen State.  
L:  Yeah exactly.
R:  I mean it's a big school
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- there's a big diversity on the campus.
L:  Exactly, so I mean there's just plenty of people that are -- that are just fanatic about [LAUGH] free Palestine --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean that's -- that's what, I think, a really big thing coming.
R:  Yep.
L:  And, I think -- I think -- I thin it is right to give I mean, like, a little bit of, uh, more attention to Palestine I mean but -- but I think that shouldn't be a cas- -- that shouldn't be a cause for, you know, causing a lot trouble, mischief, in the world but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean --
R:  Well, yes and now with the whol- -- the whole war thing that just occurred and with Iraqi and then you have those countries being thrown in to the whole gist of things now too and investigating them more.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And obvious there was always the possible linkage between Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein as well.  So --
L:  Oh yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  It's scary, huh, it's scary --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- what these people can do but [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- hopefully, uh -- hopefully, George Bush knows what he's doing.  I think -- I think I'm pretty confident in what he's doing --
R:  Yeah, I am too.  I -- I -- I think he's doing overall a good job.  I mean obviously every -- I think every leader has their strengths and their weaknesses, you know, you're going to have that with anybody --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and their downsides but you -- you just hope that -- I mean they certainly -- I trust that the person that got that position, you know, they -- it's not like they're a slacker or anything like that, um --
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  -- you know, they --
L:  George Bush seems like he cares [LAUGH], it does seem like it.
R:  Exactly, yeah.  Mhm.  And --
L:  I'd like to pass that --
R:  -- something like this, something that's gonna affect, you know, every individual person in not just America, but the entire world, you know, they -- that means them as well and so they're gonna do whatever they can to, uh -- to, uh, control it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and make things better.
L:  Let me ask you, I was -- I was, uh, watching the Today Show, a couple of months ago actually, and, uh, they had -- uh, Kitty Craig was interviewing Bill Clinton and, uh, she asked him what his biggest regret was when he was in term -- when he was in -- when he was President.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he said -- and he said, "Not catching Osama bin Laden".  I mean does that make you cringe or what?  I mean, 'cause --
R:  I -- I'm sorry what -- did you say he -- what he wasn't doing?  I'm sorr- --
L:  No, no he -- he had a -- Bill Clinton, I mean, he admitted that he had Osama bin Laden.
R:  Oh, oh okay.
L:  But, uh, I don't know some -- some -- something,  I don't know he couldn't get him so -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I don't know that just -- that just makes me, you know, that just makes me kinda cringe there, you know, I mean, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  We didn't do enough in the past to -- to prevent these kind of -- these kind of attacks though. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  May be there might -- may be we might be, you know, like in twenty years -- maybe not now but in twenty years --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and the President --
R:  And it's --
L:  -- at that time will -- will also like maybe start slacking -- maybe -- maybe take things for granted and --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- and it'll happen again.
R:  Yeah, and it's -- it's unfortunate that it took, you know, the September eleventh attack to make things, you know, our -- our security measures and whatnot and dealing with terrorists is it's unfortunate that it made that, you know, get better, you know, so, I mean, it's -- that -- that's the case in a lot of stuff, you know.  Unfortunately you have to pay the price in order to -- to, um, make things better but, uh, let's just hope that we -- we keep improving those -- those measures and they just -- they keep on getting better and better as each day goes by so we don't have to deal with anything like this again.
L:  Mhm, yeah.  Well, let's just hope [LAUGH].
R:  Yep.  
L:  'Cause, uh --
R:  I feel pretty confident that it -- that it will I guess that I mean it -- overall I don't -- I mean maybe that's -- the first couple of days after the -- the whole attacks, especially because the one plane crash was, uh, was very near here, it was, you know, maybe about an hour or so away from here --
L:  Oh really, yeah.
