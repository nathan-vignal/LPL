R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  This is Diana.
R:  And this is Jamilla.  Um, airport security.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  Have you -- have you, um, +visited the airport since nine eleven?
L:  Yes, I just went yesterday.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] How was it?
L:  Well, um, I had gone to meet my niece and because of nine eleven I couldn't get up to where she was at.  So, we didn't get to meet until, um -- and she was leaving for, um, Madrid [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And she was young.  So, I -- I didn't like that.  They need t- -- I like the security, I understand it.  But they need to have some sort of an alternative --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- for people, you know, to be able to get in touch with people who are just on layovers.
R:  Right.  Okay.  So, she was on a layover?
L:  [MN]
R:  I have -- um, I have not -- um, I don't really fly too much.  But I do have, um, a couple of friends and coworkers that had -- have to had to travel since nine eleven.  One coworker, for example, they checked her shoes.  Um, they -- these were supposed to be random checks, but she just happened to be checked for everything this particular flight.  They checked her shoes, they checked her body, they check- -- they checked her luggage.  Um, she almost missed her flight.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, just certain things like that.  Um, I do appreciate the fact that they do these random checks, but you just may not check the right person.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] So, for her that was -- I think that was an experience for her.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, if they're going to -- if it's -- you know, 'cause she almost missed her flight --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then they need to make the public aware that, you know, you really need to come an hour or two hours just in case.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  Because otherwise -- you know, if she had of missed her flight I'm pretty sure they wouldn't have paid for that or given her [LAUGH] another flight for free.
R:  [NOISE] Exactly.  So ...
L:  So ...
R:  And as far as the -- like, the shoe bombers, I don't know.  I don't think that, um, they should -- I [MN] -- I -- I would think that they would have some kind -- some kind of equipment that once you walk through it they would be able to check your shoes that way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Instead of you having to take off your shoes.  That could take up a lot of time.
L:  Yeah.  I'm also wondering bec- -- well, see the thing of it is, is if it's not, um, a metal then they won't be able to pick it up with a metal detector.
R:  Right.
L:  And I -- I believe that the guy who had the shoes didn't have metal in it, it was plastic --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- explosives and things like that.
R:  Right.
L:  So it may have not been able to be picked up, even if they would've, you know, ran it through an x-ray or something because it's not metal.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- I just think it's really tough for them to [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- keep it safe.
R:  [NOISE] I'm not sure what they could do to -- to improve airport security.  Um, I'm not really sure.  Like I said, I don't fly a whole lot.  I just hear other people's experiences.  So I'm not really sure what could be done to increase that.  Yeah, you tell people to come two, two and a half hours, you know, before their flight, but sometimes it takes a little bit longer than that.
L:  Mhm.  Well, I've never flown.  So ...
R:  Oh, okay.  [SIGH]
L:  The first time that I was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really in a major airport was yesterday and, um, just the enormity of the people, I have no idea how they are keeping it safe [LAUGH] because any- everybody running every which way and [SIGH] all these different people going everywhere and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it just seems that it would be impossible to do.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  And they're also -- they're also having, um, t- -- it's to the point where you cannot -- like you said, you couldn't see her for her layover.  Even if you drop someone off at the airport you have to drop them off at the front door.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it's -- I don't know how they're doing it with, um ...  I had a friend that took her daughter, her daughter I think was twelve, [LIPSMACK] to the airport and she couldn't go too far with her, and I don't think that that's right, you know, that's a child --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that -- that needs that -- that parent there with them up until the flight.
L:  Mhm.  Or they need to have some sort of a place that the parent and the child can wait --
R:  Right.
L:  -- far enough away, for -- for everybody to feel safe, until -- and then get somebody to come and, you know, take the child directly to her airline.  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  To the gate and everything.  Because that's what I was worried about, because my niece had never flown before and she had flown down from Pittsburgh and then she was going to go on to Madrid and she, you wanted, her aunt there [LAUGH] to, you know, talk to and -- for the four hours that she was gonna be there.
R:  Oh, wow!  Four hours.  How old is she?
L:  She's, uh, fifteen.
R:  Okay.  
L:  But still, you know, 'cause she ...
R:  Yeah.  That's a long time.
L:  And she'd never flown and ...  So, I mean, they had where you could page people, but she --
R:  [NOISE]
L:   -- you know, she's not going to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- know to listen, and it's so busy and so we never did hook up.  [LAUGH]  So, it just -- it -- it was just very -- it wasn't just as inconvenient --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it was just -- there should've been something that they could've set in place, like somebody to go --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and physically get her, to bring her to me.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  Or to physically go and to get her a message or, you know, something like that.  'Cause if I would've known -- I didn't even know that you couldn't get up to where -- I knew you couldn't get, you know, on the airline obviously.  But I thought, well, people will come off --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- and then, you know -- you know how you saw it on TV where they hug and all that stuff, and I thought well, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- then ...
R:  Yeah.  They cut all of that out.
L:  Yeah.  I didn't know that until yesterday.  [LAUGH]  So, then it was we couldn't even get past the atrium.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So ...  But, I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- I understand it.  I just think that they need to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have it better organized.
R:  Right.  Uh-hum.  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, I haven't flown since -- I'd say I haven't flown for maybe about five or six years.  [NOISE]  I just don't really like flying on airplanes.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I try to stay away from it as much as I can, as much as I can I try to stay away from the airports, and I think since nine eleven it's gotten a whole lot worse.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Just my whole security, my feeling of -- of security just is not there regarding the airports.  I do not -- like I said [NOISE], I don't know what they could do that would make me feel more secure in the airports.
L:  I can't think so either because I was worrying anyway about the airplane crashing.
R:  Right.
L:  Now I have to worry about it either being blown in -- you know, up or driven into something and --
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's just too -- I'll just drive [LAUGH], you know, even if it's long distance I would rather drive because then I'm in control of my vehicle and I can, you know, keep secure because it's my vehicle.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
L:  So, I don't know either.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think that that's probably why a lot of people aren't flying.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that --
R:  Except for, like, business.
L:  Yeah.  And even then I think that -- 'cause I just knew somebody who --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- drove from, um, Philadelphia --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- down to Atlanta instead of flying.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I mean, they would have to make it so that there weren't any incidents and -- but there's, you know, incidents where people get guns on, you know, just to --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- test the system, or knives, or -- I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's more important than, you know, somebody having nail clippers.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  And if they can -- if they can catch the nail clippers, why can't [LAUGH] they catch the guns or the knives?
R:  The guns and the knives.  Right.
L:  That's what I worry about. 
R:  Yeah.  And then with the war going on, I would say that I would -- my -- my security level would probably more heightened now because they're gonna retaliate I'm sure.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We don't know when, we don't know where, but [SIGH] -- I don't know, maybe they're focusing on the airports, and that's not where they're gonna go.  Maybe they're -- you know, they'll do something different.  But it -- it still -- it still remains clear that they did it once and they can do it again.
L:  Mhm.  That's what I'm worried about [MN] 'cause they'll go to the one place that we aren't covering.  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  And so we need to either cover everything or there's no way we can protect ourselves. 
R:  [PAUSE] Okay.  Um, yeah, I guess we really don't have a whole lot to say about it because [LAUGH] neither one of us fly too much.
L:  Mm, no.  But, I mean, we -- most -- you know, we both agree that we're not gonna fly [LAUGH] --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- because of -- you know, it makes it more likely we're not going to fly because of the security risks and the [SIGH] -- what they, you know, put into place we don't really feel that is, you know, catching everything and so it's just an inconvenience for the ones who don't need to be inconvenienced, and the ones who are dangerous get through.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.  Exactly.
L:  So, I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- that's certain things that they would need to think about.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And like you said, those checkpoints, they should have checkpoints where you could meet in the middle somewhere [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] and then you'd have to go back through -- you know, the people that are going back into the airport or -- or so -- the -- the parts of the airport, that are going back on to the plane would have to be checked again.  But I think that they should have a middle point where you can come out, not so much out of the airport, but out of the terminal just so that you can see someone that you may be looking for, or for layovers.  They should have a -- a medium point for layovers.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, they could do something as simple as, um -- 'cause I knew my niece's name, I knew the flight number, I knew the gate she was supposed to be at.  So, if I had all that information then go ahead and search me.
R:  Right.
L:  Make sure I don't have anything.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I was fine with that.  I thought for sure they'd do that.  And then let me go back.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because they- they've already searched me and I knew who I was gonna meet.  So, it's not like a random person just wanting to go through.  And even, you know, if you have to leave your driver's license or if you have to leave some sort of, um --
R:  ID.
L:  -- collateral --
R:  Right.
L:  -- yeah, with them then --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --you know, whenever I get through seeing her then --
