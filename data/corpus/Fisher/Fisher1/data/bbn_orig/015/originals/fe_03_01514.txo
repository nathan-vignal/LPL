R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Pamela.
L:  Hi, I'm Manny.
R:  Hi, Manny.  So, I guess we get to talk about September eleventh.
L:  Yeah, I think so.
R:  So, what --
L:  Um, is this your first time doing this?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, it's not, okay.
R:  Is it yours?
L:  All right -- what's up?
R:  Is it yours?
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  Oh okay.  Well, all we do is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- discuss how we feel about the changes --
L:  September eleventh.
R:  Huh?
L:  [NOISE] So, we just discuss -- I don't know, hold on a second.
R:  About -- 
L:  Yeah, I don't know.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, what was that?
R:  [LAUGH] We just discuss about what aff -- has there been any affects on -- on your life since eleven -- or September eleventh?
L:  Oh.
R:  If not -- if so, what kind -- or the people around you or ...
L:  I guess -- I mean, the only really affect, I mean, like every time I fly it takes a while longer and, um, stuff like that.  I mean I feel bad about it but [NOISE] other than that I don't really know what to tell you, like it hasn't really affected me that much.
R:  What about the people around you?
L:  Um, I mean, it was a -- it was -- it was terrible and I even went to New York to go see it and everything but --
R:  Did you really?
L:  -- other than that -- yeah.  Well, I -- I went to see that and my sister --
R:  What was it like?
L:  Well, it was, uh, it just empty like -- it was just like people were looking at it and it was just like a big hole and -- but I only went like, like seven or eight months after it happened, I never got time to go like right after it happened.  And so they had done all this construction on it.  Hold on a sec. [NOISE].  Yeah, and so, uh, I mean there wasn't much you couldn't -- you couldn't even tell that, you know, a bomb went off or everything. [NOISE] There were still people -- there were still people looking at it like whe- -- they were still looking at it like they didn't know what was going on but, I mean, obviously everybody knows what went on.
R:  Really, it was that -- it was that dumbfounded [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.  But it -- it looked the same to me it just looked like everybody was like, "Hey, what's going on over here?" but, you know, everybody knew.
R:  Well, what about friends or family or anything?  Did it affect them?  Anything --
L:  Uh, it affected one of my friends because his dad was in the building, or his uncle was in the building or something like that.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  But luckily he left that morning before it happened.
R:  Oh you're kidding.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, I mean, that's pretty much the only thing that it's affected me in.
R:  Really.  No --
L:  Yeah, how's it affected you?
R:  Well, in ways that, you know, you think about if that was your family member that kind of thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I have a religious background, non denomination background, and, uh, I just leave it up to the Lord my life is so I don't really stress out about it.  If it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen with or without us no matter where we are, you know.
L:  Yeah, that's true, yeah.
R:  Unfortunately, yes it does hurt, death in family does hurt deeply, I don't know if you've had death in the family.
L:  Did you -- did you -- you didn't know anybody that it -- that was in it or anything, did you?
R:  No, actually I knew people -- the Oklahoma bombing.
L:  Okay, yeah, my mom went to see that right after it happened.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  This goes in the family, doesn't it?
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No, it's just like it's terrifying and you don't really understand it until you go see it and, you know, it's just like you see it on TV and it's -- like I saw the second plane hit it while I was watching it live.
R:  Yeah, so did I.
L:  And, like, it didn't really register, you know.
R:  Yeah, it seems like a sh- -- another TV program --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that you see on TV or a movie, doesn't  it?  It just doesn't seem real --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but it's been real when you went though?
L:  Yeah, I mean it -- it --
R:  Did it make a difference?
L:  Yeah, I think it did.
R:  How did it make a difference?
L:  Well, it as just like -- I mean I saw it in real life and I was like, "Wow, it really did happen, wow" you know, like all these people -- like I'm standing on the same ground that so many people have died, you know.
R:  Yeah, a lot.  But then if you think about what's happening overseas right now it's, uh --
L:  Yeah, that's true.  But see that --
R:  -- in all.
L:  -- that again is like --
R:  Like a movie?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Something that hasn't -- doesn't really touch you until it hits your family?
L:  No, it hasn't really touched me and it -- I still -- I just feel like it's a movie or something, you know.  And, I don't know, maybe it's just me I -- I ask people --
R:  No, that sounds really normal.
L:  -- about it as well.  I don't know, it sounds terrible when I say it but really like I have nothing -- like I watch it and I'm like, "Oh this place got bombed, this place bombed".  I really wouldn't understand it until they -- hold on, hold on one second [NOISE].  Sorry, about that.
R:  That's okay.  You sound like a bachelor.
L:  What's up?
R:  You sound like a bachelor [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it's just I'm throwing a keg around my place today, having some friends come over.
R:  Oh, you're kidding me and you get the phone call, huh?
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, I got it twice and my phone was dead and so I was like, oh, you know, stuff this see what's going on.  I'd never done this though, just see how it is.
R:  Yeah, this is pretty much all they do.  They have different topics and this is the topic they're picking this time.  Let's see but, uh, no it really hasn't affected -- the only thing that affected me was knowing the pain that these people are going through --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that are alive, you know.  Um, I did, when I was, uh, when our car was broken into in our home, understanding the feeling of you have no control.
L:  Yeah.  Our -- my house burned down when I was like, um, sixteen or something.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  Yeah, [MN] and that was pretty --
R:  That feeling of invasion --
L:  -- scary.
R:  -- and so on.  That fear factor, I think, uh, the people there they just don't know when the next bomb's gonna hit, you know?
L:  Yeah, I mean, I feel like a bomb could hit anywhere, here as well, you know.
R:  Oh yeah, where are you?
L:  I'm in Austin, Texas.
R:  Really?
L:  The capital and I live like right next to the capital pretty much.  Like --
R:  I'm in Washington State.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so we're a little bit apart.  That's weird.
L:  Yeah, pretty [inaudible].
R:  But the next thing that's gonna happen is abruptly, um, the voice computer thing's gonna come back on --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and give us time to say goodbye and then that's the end of it. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, and then I probably won't hear from you ever --
R:  Ever again.
L:  -- again.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's interesting.
R:  Interesting [several inaudible words] didn't it? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH].  Um, how old are you?
R:  -- things.  I'm a lot older than you [LAUGH].
L:  I'm twenty one.
R:  I probably have ki- -- yes, I have children your age [LAUGH].
L:  Oh great.
R:  My name's Pamela Anderson though. [LAUGH]
L:  What's up?
R:  My name's Pamela Anderson though.
L:  Your name is Pamela Anderson!
R:  Yes, it is.  Pamela E Anderson.
L:  So, I guess -- so I guess you get a lot of comments about that, huh?
R:  Oh yeah, big time.  But, uh, I wish I had the money but I wouldn't want the headache --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- to go with it.
L:  I -- I bet you get enough of a headache as it is from just your name.
R:  No, it starts nice conversations and so on.
L:  Just in conversations and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah, people say I'm better looking than her but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah, right. [LAUGH] Uh-huh.  I don't have her -- her bombshell body. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but I mean she's done so many like implants and all kinds of other stuff.  I don't know if it's all that bombshell.  I don't -- I don't personally like her all that much, I think she's --
R:  Well, without the makeup it's kinda scary.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, but, uh, anyways back to our feature seeing we get recorded on this.
L:  Oh.  I'm sorry --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- how do they contact -- do they contact you again or how does this work I need to [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah, they call you -- they call you -- the, um, it's just if they find more people then they start calling again.  They build up a -- a certain amount of people over a couple of months or whatever and then they do it again.  This is my third phone call.
L:  How -- how lon- -- how many times have you done it?
R:  Three.  You'll be my third.
L:  Three times.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh okay, all right, this is my first.  So, I didn't --
R:  That's okay, I felt like a bumbling idiot the first time I did it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] By the third you kinda get it down a little bit, I think.
L:  Oh I see.  Well --
R:  But, uh, it --
L:  -- it's kinda interesting.  You talk to someone who's completely random for ten minutes and it's like meeting somebody in a bus stop or something, right?
R:  Yeah, it is.  Or -- or in a bar or wherever, you know.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  And it -- it's just -- I don't know you kinda get to know 'em a little bit and then you wanna have conversations beyond that but you're not supposed to.
L:  Oh, that's interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, this is probably being recorded or something, or what?
R:  It's very much being recorded.
L:  Oh, okay.  All right.
R:  And then there's, uh -- they have a study -- class studies off of it.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  Ah! [LAUGH] 
L:  Interesting.
R:  So, watch what you say.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'll keep that in mind next time [LAUGH].  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'll try to stick to the topic.  I guess they probably kick out people that don't stick to the topic or something [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, I don't know.
