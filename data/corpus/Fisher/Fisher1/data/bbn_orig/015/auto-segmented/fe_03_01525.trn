WELL FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND IT WAS STRICTLY FOR MORE MORE MONEY BUT  (fe_03_01525-B-0008)
I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA  (fe_03_01525-B-0009)

BUT STRIKES I THINK ARE A BIT RIDICULOUS  (fe_03_01525-B-0014)
N- WELL IN PROFESSIONAL  (fe_03_01525-B-0015)
SPORTS NOT IN GENERAL BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT GO ON STRIKE HAVE VERY VALID REASONS  (fe_03_01525-B-0016)
THEY CAN'T PAY THEIR BILLS  (fe_03_01525-B-0017)
I TOTALLY AGREE YOU MAKE A MILLION DOLLARS AND WANNA GO ON STRIKE SO YOU CAN MAKE TWO MILLION  (fe_03_01525-B-0018)
AND JOE BLOW THAT'S ON STRIKE IS LUCKY IF THEY BRING HOME FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR  (fe_03_01525-B-0019)
ME TOO  (fe_03_01525-B-0020)
VERY VERY ANNOYED AT YOU KNOW MOST PEOPLE IN THE U._S. LIVE BELOW THE POVERTY LINE  (fe_03_01525-B-0021)
AND YOU JUST YOU JUST RAISE THE BAR  (fe_03_01525-B-0022)
AND NOW YOU WANT MORE  (fe_03_01525-B-0023)
NOT ONLY DO YOU GET SALARY FOR BEING AN ATHLETE BUT YOU ALSO GET A SALARY FOR ENDORSEMENTS  (fe_03_01525-B-0024)
PUBLIC SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS AND YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT HAVE A CONTRACT FOR THREE AND A HALF MILLION BUT YOU MAKE FIVE MILLION A YEAR BECAUSE YOU'RE IN A NIKE COMMERCIAL  (fe_03_01525-B-0025)
SO  (fe_03_01525-B-0026)
YOU MAKE EIGHT AND A HALF MILLION YOU YOU PAY IN MORE IN TAXES THAN TEN PEOPLE TOGETHER MAKE IN A YEAR'S TIME  (fe_03_01525-B-0027)
AND YOU DON'T HAVE A VALID REASON YOU CERTAINLY WANT MORE MONEY  (fe_03_01525-B-0028)
AND THAT TO ME MAKES SENSE  (fe_03_01525-B-0029)
WELL IT'S IT'S SUCH A  (fe_03_01525-B-0030)
THEY THEY SET SUCH A REALLY SAD BAD EXAMPLE FOR LIKE [NOISE] HIGH SCHOOL KIDS YOU KNOW THEY'RE LIKE OH I WANNA PLAY FOOTBALL OR BASKETBALL SO THAT I CAN BE THE NEXT JORDAN OR  (fe_03_01525-B-0031)
YOU KNOW WHOEVER ELSE SO THAT I CAN MAKE THAT EIGHT AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR  (fe_03_01525-B-0032)
IT'S IT'S A VERY BIG PROBLEM THEY FORGET THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF GOING TO SCHOOL  (fe_03_01525-B-0033)
AND I MEAN IF YOU LIVE FOR MONEY YOU'RE GOING TO BE REALLY REALLY SAD ONE DAY [NOISE]  (fe_03_01525-B-0034)
MONEY DOESN'T BUY HAPPINESS  (fe_03_01525-B-0035)
NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU HAVE OBVIOUSLY YOU STILL WANT MORE  (fe_03_01525-B-0036)
BUT THE STRIKES I DON'T UNDERSTAND IF THEY HAD VALID REASONS LIKE  (fe_03_01525-B-0037)
YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE STRIKE BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T MAKE ANY MONEY OR BECAUSE THEY'RE BENEFITS GOT CUT OR BECAUSE THERE'S YOU KNOW PREJUDICES AND SEGREGATIONS AND  (fe_03_01525-B-0038)
THOSE ARE VALID REASONS  (fe_03_01525-B-0039)
ATHLETES  (fe_03_01525-B-0040)
I DON'T REMEMBER AN ATHLETE'S STRIKE YET THAT WASN'T FOR CONTRACT DISPUTES AND MONEY  (fe_03_01525-B-0041)
I REMEMBER AN UMPIRE'S STRIKE AND I GUESS THAT AFFECTED 'EM  (fe_03_01525-B-0042)
BUT I FIGURE THAT UM-  (fe_03_01525-B-0043)
MHM  (fe_03_01525-B-0044)
WENT ON STRIKE ONCE ONCE THAT I CAN REMEMBER  (fe_03_01525-B-0045)
AND AND I'M SURE YOU KNOW THAT AFFECTED THE GAME BUT  (fe_03_01525-B-0046)
THEY WERE EASILY REPLACED BY SOMEONE WHO WOULD CROSS THE PICKET LINE AND  (fe_03_01525-B-0047)
YOU KNOW WHEN THE ATHLETE'S GO ON STRIKE IT'S DONE AND OVER THERE'S NO ONE THAT CAN REPLACE THEM  (fe_03_01525-B-0048)
AND IT'S STRICTLY FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES SO I I DON'T  (fe_03_01525-B-0049)
I I GUESS I JUST DON'T GET IT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01525-B-0050)
THERE'S NO WAY I COULD I COULD SEE MYSELF  (fe_03_01525-B-0051)
RAISING THAT KIND OF A STINK  (fe_03_01525-B-0052)
WELL MONEY DOESN'T LET YOU FORGET YOUR STRUGGLES  (fe_03_01525-B-0053)
AND AND I'M SURE WE'RE ALL HAPPY WHEN WE PROGRESS TO THE NEXT LEVEL BUT BUT THERE'S GOTTA BE THERE'S GOTTA BE AN END TO THE MADNESS AT SOME POINT  (fe_03_01525-B-0054)
IT REINFORCES THE GREED IN OUR SOCIETY  (fe_03_01525-B-0055)
EXORBITANT  (fe_03_01525-B-0056)
PARDON  (fe_03_01525-B-0057)
I SAID EXORBITANT SALARIES AND RIDICULOUS STRIKES AND WE PAY HOW MUCH IS A HOW MUCH IS A TICKET TO A PROFESSIONAL GAME LIKE SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS MAYBE  (fe_03_01525-B-0058)
YOU KNOW WE  (fe_03_01525-B-0059)
WE WORK REALLY HARD TO MAKE SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO TO AFFORD TO WATCH YOU  (fe_03_01525-B-0060)
AND THEN YOU WANNA TAKE THAT BIT OF ENTERTAINMENT FROM US  (fe_03_01525-B-0061)
FOR WELL I'M IN MEMPHIS TENNESSEE AND WE JUST GOT OUR OUR FIRST PROFESSIONAL TEAM  (fe_03_01525-B-0062)
THE  (fe_03_01525-B-0063)
THE GRIZZLIES YEAH BUT  (fe_03_01525-B-0064)

AND YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE YOUR MONEY BACK GIVE YOUR TIME  (fe_03_01525-B-0068)
YOUR TIME MATTERS A LOT MORE TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE MONEY THAN YOUR MONEY DOES  (fe_03_01525-B-0069)
UH-UH I THINK DEFINITELY THAT THAT SHOULD BE WRITTEN INTO THE CONTRACT AND YOU KNOW THEN THEY CAN STRIKE BECAUSE MAYBE THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT [LAUGHTER] 'CAUSE  (fe_03_01525-B-0070)
THEY HAVE TO GIVE UP THEIR TIME BUT  (fe_03_01525-B-0071)
NOT FOR MORE MONEY  (fe_03_01525-B-0072)
I DON'T GET IT  (fe_03_01525-B-0073)
WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT RUNNING UP AND DOWN  (fe_03_01525-B-0074)
SWEATING HUFFING AND PUFFING  (fe_03_01525-B-0075)
COULD MAKE THAT KIND OF MONEY AND THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY ARE THE BACKBONE OF AMERICAN SOCIETY  (fe_03_01525-B-0076)
OFTEN GET OVERLOOKED  (fe_03_01525-B-0077)
