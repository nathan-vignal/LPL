AND THEY WOULD SAY OH MY GOD YOU'RE GIVING ME A CHOICE HERE RIGHT AND  (fe_03_01576-B-0048)
HOW MANY PEOPLES COME THROUGH AND HOW MANY AIRPORTS ACTUALLY ALLOW TO HAVE THIS KIND OF THING TO MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR THEM YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN BECAUSE THERE'S SOME PEOPLE THAT TRAVEL AT LEAST MAYBE  (fe_03_01576-B-0049)
