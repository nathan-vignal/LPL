SO WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ON SPORT STRIKES  (fe_03_01521-A-0004)
THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_01521-A-0005)
HONESTLY LIKE FOR SOME SPORTS I CAN SEE IT BUT I'M VERY MUCH AGAINST BASEBALL FOR THE AMOUNT OF STRIKES THEY'VE HAD FIRST IN THE LAST LIKE TEN YEARS AND THEY ALWAYS COMPLAIN AND THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE SUCH A HARD [NOISE] THEY DON'T REALLY EXERCISE ALL THAT MUCH  (fe_03_01521-A-0006)
I DON'T  (fe_03_01521-A-0007)
BASEBALL PLAYERS AS COMPARED TO LIKE EVERY OTHER SPORT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE HOCKEY PLAYERS THEY PLAY MORE GAMES THEY'RE ACTUALLY ACT LIKE THEY'RE PHYSICALLY ACTIVE AND ARE IN DANGER OF INJURY LIKE A BASEBALL PLAYER THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU IS YOU GET NAILED BY A BALL  (fe_03_01521-A-0008)
AND LIKE THEY SIT AROUND YOU KNOW YOU HIT A BALL FINE YOU RUN A BASE YOU RUN A BASE YOU'VE DONE FOR THE DAY  (fe_03_01521-A-0009)
WELL CONSIDERING HOW MANY TIMES THEY'VE STRIKED IN THE LAST TEN YEARS HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED THAT LIKE IT USED AMERICA'S LIKE BASEBALL USED TO BE AMERICA'S PASTIME NOW NO ONE CARES ANYMORE THAT'S WHAT I'VE NOTICED SEEING THE NUMBER OF TIMES THEY'VE STRIKED I THINK IT'S BEEN FOUR OR IS IT FIVE I'VE LOST COUNT  (fe_03_01521-A-0010)
