ALL RIGHT THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I'VE GOTTEN THIS TOPIC AND I KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT IT  (fe_03_01528-A-0003)
SO IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PLEASE FEEL FREE TO TELL ME [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01528-A-0004)
YEAH I [SIGH] I KEEP HOPING I GET A DIFFERENT TOPIC UM [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01528-A-0006)
I JUST DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS UM  (fe_03_01528-A-0007)
WELL THAT'S ESSENTIALLY HOW I FEEL LIKE I I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE JUSTIFIED OR NOT BUT I HAVE A HARD TIME FEELING SYMPATHETIC FOR SOMEONE WHO WORKS YOU KNOW ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE DAYS AND AND MAKES MILLIONS OF DOLLARS  (fe_03_01528-A-0008)
UM  (fe_03_01528-A-0009)
LIKE I [MN] I JUST DON'T FEEL SYMPATHETIC FOR THEM YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN  (fe_03_01528-A-0010)
WELL THAT'S THE PART THAT REALLY GETS ME IS WHY SHOULD THE TAX PAYERS PAY FOR THE STADIUM IF IF THESE FOOTBALL TEAMS AND AND BASEBALL TEAMS AND BASKETBALL TEAMS HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY EMPLOY- PLAY PLAYERS [MN] PAY PLAYERS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01528-A-0011)
I'D TAKE MY TAX MONEY OVER [LAUGHTER] A FOOTBALL GAME ANY TIME  (fe_03_01528-A-0012)
YEAH  (fe_03_01528-A-0014)
WELL I MEAN PART OF UH PART OF THE PROBLEM I HAVE  (fe_03_01528-A-0015)
WELL PART OF THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS QUESTION IS I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SPORTS BUT THE OTHER PROBLEM I HAVE IS I THINK THAT THE SALARY CAP THING IS WORKING INCREDIBLY DIFFERENTLY IN THE DIFFERENT SPORTS  (fe_03_01528-A-0016)
UM  (fe_03_01528-A-0017)
LIKE I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW SO VERY LITTLE ABOUT THIS IN FOOTBALL  (fe_03_01528-A-0018)
THERE ARE LIKE  (fe_03_01528-A-0019)
I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE SALARY CAPS PER SE I THINK WHAT THEY HAVE IS THAT IF YOU SPEND MORE THAN X AMOUNT OF MONEY ON PLAYER SALARIES THEN YOU HAVE TO PAY SOME LIKE TAX TO THE N._F._L.  (fe_03_01528-A-0020)
AND I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE OF TEAMS THAT DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S WORTH IT TO THEM  (fe_03_01528-A-0021)
UM BECAUSE THEY'RE YOU KNOW THE REALLY REALLY BIG TEAMS UM BUT MOST TEAMS DON'T BUT THEN LIKE IN BASEBALL IT'S JUST I THINK IT'S LIKE A FLAT  (fe_03_01528-A-0022)
CAP THAT YOU CAN'T SPEND MORE THAN X AMOUNT OF MONEY UH THE OTHER THING I DON'T KNOW IS I KNOW I REMEMBER READING WAY BACK WHEN HOW MUCH MONEY THE LOWEST PLAYED  (fe_03_01528-A-0023)
LOWEST PAID PLAYER IN BASEBALL MADE AND IT WAS ENORMOUS IT WAS HUGE  (fe_03_01528-A-0024)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01528-A-0025)
BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT'S THE SAME FOR OTHER TEAM OTHER SPORTS LIKE FOOTBALL FOR EXAMPLE  (fe_03_01528-A-0026)
LIKE I'M NOT SURE THAT THE LIKE EIGHTH STRING QUARTERBACK FOR A FOOTBALL TEAM MAKES ANYWHERE NEAR AS MUCH MONEY AS UH THE GUY WHO SITS ON THE BENCH FOR YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01528-A-0027)
THE BASEBALL TEAM  (fe_03_01528-A-0028)
MHM  (fe_03_01528-A-0029)
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD POINT  (fe_03_01528-A-0030)

YOU ALREADY KNOW WHO'S GOING TO WIN YOU ALREADY KNOW WHO'S GOING TO LOSE  (fe_03_01528-A-0032)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01528-A-0033)
[NOISE] YEAH I GUESS IF YOU KNOW NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT THAT WAY AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING I HAD THOUGHT ABOUT BEFORE IF I WAS REALLY A FAN IT WOULD REALLY FRUSTRATE ME IF THE BEST TEAMS JUST BOUGHT THE BEST PEOPLE AND NO ONE ELSE REALLY EVER HAD A CHANCE TO BE THE CHAMPIONS  (fe_03_01528-A-0034)
