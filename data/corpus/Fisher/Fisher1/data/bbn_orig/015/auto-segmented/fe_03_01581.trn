[NOISE] MARY LEWIS  (fe_03_01581-B-0001)
YES  (fe_03_01581-B-0002)
[SIGH] DOES IT UH DECREASE  (fe_03_01581-B-0003)
[SIGH] I THINK IT DOES  (fe_03_01581-B-0005)
TO AN EXTENT  (fe_03_01581-B-0006)
OF COURSE IT'S KINDA SCARY THAT THEY HAD SOME GO THROUGH AIRPORT SECURITY [LIPSMACK] AND  (fe_03_01581-B-0007)
I'M THINKING SPECIFICALLY SOME AGO TIME AGO ABOUT SOME GUY WITH  (fe_03_01581-B-0008)
RUBBER SOLED SHOES OR SOMETHING THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS SHOE  (fe_03_01581-B-0009)
[LIPSMACK] OH YEAH THE PEOPLE  (fe_03_01581-B-0010)
MHM  (fe_03_01581-B-0011)
[SIGH] AS LONG AS THEY ARE THERE UH DISCREETLY  (fe_03_01581-B-0012)
[LIPSMACK] UH AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE RECENTLY I TOOK A FLIGHT A FEW MONTHS AGO AND I WAS STANDING IN LINE  (fe_03_01581-B-0013)
AND SOME GUY CAME AROUND AND WAS GONNA BOARD THE PLANE AND THEY TOLD HIM HE HAD TO THE OTHER SIDE WHERE  (fe_03_01581-B-0014)
THEY WERE CHECKING PEOPLE [LIPSMACK] AND THE LADY SAID OH HE'S SECURITY  (fe_03_01581-B-0015)
HE'S WITH  (fe_03_01581-B-0016)
I FORGOT WHAT IT WAS AND I THOUGHT NOW THAT'S REAL SECURE EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO HE IS NOW  (fe_03_01581-B-0017)
YEAH SO I I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE KIND OF SECURITY I'M THINKING OF [LAUGHTER] I THOUGHT YOU KNOW THAT'S THE FIRST ONE THEY'RE GOING AFTER [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01581-B-0019)
BUT DON'T ADVERTISE WHO THEY ARE [LAUGHTER] YEAH YOU KNOW LET 'EM WONDER  (fe_03_01581-B-0020)
[LAUGHTER] NOW I DO THINK THAT ALL THE UH SECURITY HAS SLOWED DOWN THE CHECK IN TIME AND SUCH THAT AND THEY DON'T TELL YA A LOT OF IT IN ADVANCE  (fe_03_01581-B-0021)
BECAUSE THAT PARTICULAR FLIGHT WHAT I DID WAS I WENT I TRAVELED FROM HOUSTON INTER CONTINENTAL  (fe_03_01581-B-0022)
AND I I ALLOWED FOR A LOT OF EXTRA TIME WHEN I WENT THROUGH THE GATE  (fe_03_01581-B-0023)
THE ALARM WENT OF COURSE  (fe_03_01581-B-0024)
AND I GOT THROUGH [SIGH] AND IT WAS MY SHOES  (fe_03_01581-B-0025)
AND I SO WHENEVER I FLEW BACK  (fe_03_01581-B-0026)
UH I AUTOMATICALLY TOOK MY SHOES OFF BEFORE I WENT THROUGH THE  (fe_03_01581-B-0027)
SECURITY THING AND I THINK THEY OUGHTA YOU KNOW POST LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WOULD HELP PEOPLE TO GET THROUGH QUICKER BECAUSE IF I'D KNOWN TO TAKE MY SHOES I'D HAVE PUT 'EM IN THE LITTLE BASKET [MN] SENT 'EM THROUGH AND IT WOULDN'T HAVE HELD ME UP [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01581-B-0028)
YOU KNOW SO LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT COULD HELP TO SPEED IT UP TOO  (fe_03_01581-B-0029)
OH YES YES SEVERAL TIMES  (fe_03_01581-B-0031)
[SIGH] WELL THIS THE LAST FLIGHT I TOOK WAS UH FOR THANKSGIVING AND IT WAS UM  (fe_03_01581-B-0032)
[SIGH] [LIPSMACK] AMERICAN AIRLINES  (fe_03_01581-B-0033)
AND BEFORE THAT I'VE ALWAYS FLOWN SOUTH WEST OR CONTINENTAL  (fe_03_01581-B-0034)
AND I HAVEN'T FLOWN EITHER ONE OF THOSE  (fe_03_01581-B-0035)
IN OVER A YEAR I DON'T FLY A LOT BUT UM THAT'S THE ONLY SECURITY THAT YOU KNOW I'VE EXPERIENCED LATELY SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THE OTHER ONES ARE  (fe_03_01581-B-0036)
[SIGH] I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE WHAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT A TERRORIST IS GONNA DO  (fe_03_01581-B-0037)
HE'S GONNA TAKE THE GUN AWAY FROM THE PILOT SO THAT JUST GIVES HIM ANOTHER GUN  (fe_03_01581-B-0038)
[SIGH] I THINK MAYBE YOU KNOW UH A STUN GUN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT MIGHT BE OKAY  (fe_03_01581-B-0039)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01581-B-0040)
THAT'S TRUE THAT'S VERY TRUE  (fe_03_01581-B-0041)
YEAH IT TAKES SOMEBODY A LOT SMARTER THAN ME TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS  (fe_03_01581-B-0042)
[LAUGHTER] BECAUSE  (fe_03_01581-B-0043)
YEAH  (fe_03_01581-B-0044)
THAT'S TRUE WHERE I WORK THE PEOPLE TRAVEL EXTENSIVELY FOR THEIR JOBS AND AND NONE OF THEM SEEM TO BE WORRIED ABOUT IT THOUGH  (fe_03_01581-B-0045)
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A GOOD SIGN OR A BAD SIGN  (fe_03_01581-B-0046)
MHM MHM  (fe_03_01581-B-0047)
[SIGH] TEXAS  (fe_03_01581-B-0048)
HOUSTON  (fe_03_01581-B-0049)
YEAH  (fe_03_01581-B-0050)
AND THEY HAVE I DO KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THEY'VE DONE HERE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT EVERYPLACE ELSE BUT THEY HAVE STARTED HAVING  (fe_03_01581-B-0051)
UM VEHICLE CHECKS ON THE WAY TO THE AIRPORT  (fe_03_01581-B-0052)
[LIPSMACK] YEAH AND  (fe_03_01581-B-0053)
[SIGH] AND I WONDERED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I'M SURE THAT YOU KNOW IT IT DOES HELP SOME BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE  (fe_03_01581-B-0054)
[MN] YEAH BUT YOU HAVE TO OPEN YOUR TRUNK AND EVERYTHING YEAH  (fe_03_01581-B-0055)
MHM  (fe_03_01581-B-0056)
YEAH THEY  (fe_03_01581-B-0057)
THEY ALSO HAVE RANDOM CHECKS THEY DID THAT BOTH BOTH TIMES I WAS FLYING  (fe_03_01581-B-0058)
AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S LIKE EVERY FIFTH PERSON OR WHAT BUT THEY'LL PULL SOMEBODY OUT AND THEY'LL LOOK IN THEIR SUITCA- OR THEIR CARRY ON BAGS AND THEY'LL CHECK THEIR SHOES AND EVERYTHING  (fe_03_01581-B-0060)
AND IT WAS KIND OF STRANGE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO  (fe_03_01581-B-0061)
[LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_01581-B-0062)
NO WAY TO TELL WHAT KINDA PEOPLE THEY WERE PULLING OUT  (fe_03_01581-B-0063)
I MEAN LIKE MOST OF THEM THAT I SAW WERE LIKE GRANDMOTHERS [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01581-B-0064)
AND THAT'S  (fe_03_01581-B-0065)
THAT'S THE REASON THAT I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW EVERY CERTAIN NUMBER  (fe_03_01581-B-0066)
BECAUSE WHENEVER I LANDED IN UM OH I CAN'T REMEMBER WHERE I SAINT LOUIS I THINK IS WHERE I  (fe_03_01581-B-0067)
HAD TO CHANGE PLANES  (fe_03_01581-B-0068)
UH AND THEY CALLED THE THE FLIGHT WAS DELAYED FOR A LOT OF REASONS AND THEN WHEN THEY FINALLY DID CALL FOR THE FLIGHT  (fe_03_01581-B-0069)
A LADY AND I STOOD UP AT THE SAME TIME AND SHE SAID OH GO AHEAD AND SO I GOT IN LINE IN FRONT OF HER WELL THEY PULLED HER OUT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01581-B-0070)
I THINK I THINK IT'S JUST YOU KNOW A RANDOM NUMBER THAT THEY THEY PULL OUT EVERY  (fe_03_01581-B-0072)
YEAH  (fe_03_01581-B-0073)
MHM  (fe_03_01581-B-0074)
[SIGH] YEAH AND THE PROBLEM IS IT DELAYS IT TOO BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO S- GET OUT OF LINE  (fe_03_01581-B-0075)
YOU HAVE TO LET THEM GO THROUGH ALL YOUR STUFF AND YOU KNOW THEY TAKE A LITTLE WAND AND EVERYTHING  (fe_03_01581-B-0076)
AND  (fe_03_01581-B-0077)
YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE ON A FLIGHT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE RESERVED SEATS  (fe_03_01581-B-0078)
LIKE THAT'S THE WAY SOUTH WEST IS FOR ONE THING YEAH THEN YOU'RE ONE OF THE LAST ONES TO BOARD AND YOU HAVE TO SIT WHATEVER'S LEFT OVER  (fe_03_01581-B-0079)
AND SO YOU KNOW THAT'S AN INCONVENIENCE  (fe_03_01581-B-0080)
AND I REALIZE YOU KNOW THEY'RE DOING IT FOR SECURITY REASONS AND EVERYTHING SO  (fe_03_01581-B-0081)
I TRY AND SAY OKAY YOU KNOW DON'T  (fe_03_01581-B-0082)
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT BUT I KNOW THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT VERY IRRITATED TOO  (fe_03_01581-B-0083)
MHM  (fe_03_01581-B-0084)
[LIPSMACK] AND I GUESS EVERYTHING THAT THEY DO LIKE THAT THOUGH TO INCREASE SECURITY WE SHOULD WE SHOULD JUST ACCEPT AND AND NOT  (fe_03_01581-B-0085)
GET IRRITATED WITH BECAUSE IT'S FOR OUR OWN SAFETY  (fe_03_01581-B-0086)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01581-B-0087)
THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_01581-B-0088)
I DO KNOW  (fe_03_01581-B-0089)
ONE OF THE GUYS I WORK WITH TOLD ME THAT H- EVERY TIME HE GOES THROUGH AN AIRPORT THEY [LAUGHTER] THEY GIVE HIM THAT YEAH  (fe_03_01581-B-0090)
AND HE WAS VERY VERBAL ABOUT IT ONE TIME  (fe_03_01581-B-0091)
AND HE SAID THEN WHEN HE GOT ON THE PLANE HE LOOKED ROUND ALL AROUND HIM IS AIRPORT SECURITY PEOPLE [LAUGHTER] SITTING ON THE PLANE  (fe_03_01581-B-0092)
I TOLD HIM I SAID THEY'VE GOT YOU RED FLAGGED  (fe_03_01581-B-0093)
[LAUGHTER] AND AND HE WAS THE KIND THAT YOU KNOW IT WAS INCONVENIENT BECAUSE  (fe_03_01581-B-0094)
IT THREW HIM LATER GETTING ON THE PLANE AND HE DIDN'T LIKE TO HAVE TO TRAVEL ANYWAY  (fe_03_01581-B-0095)
UM YOU KNOW SO HE HE WAS VERY VERBAL WITH IT BUT I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S CALMED DOWN SOME OR NOT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01581-B-0096)
BUT YOU KNOW ALSO AND IT'S RIGHT AROUND THE TIME HE TOLD ME ABOUT THAT HE TOLD ME HE GOES TO LOUISIANA A LOT AND HE TOLD ME THAT THEY'D HAD A SHOOTING IN THE AIRPORT  (fe_03_01581-B-0097)
OVER THERE YEAH AND IT WAS RIGHT AFTER I HAD BEEN OVER THERE AND I TOLD HIM I SAID WELL I'M CERTAINLY GLAD I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT BEFORE I WENT  (fe_03_01581-B-0098)

UH UNLESS YOU HAVE A TICKET  (fe_03_01581-B-0105)
AND I'M  (fe_03_01581-B-0106)
YEAH AND I'M SURE THAT HAS THAT HAS HELPED SOME AS WELL YOU KNOW BECAUSE  (fe_03_01581-B-0107)
A LOT OF PEOPLE COULD GO THROUGH JUST PRETENDING TO SEE SOMEBODY OFF OR SOMETH-  (fe_03_01581-B-0108)
