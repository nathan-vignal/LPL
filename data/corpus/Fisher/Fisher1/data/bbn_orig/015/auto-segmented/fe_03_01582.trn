HELLO  (fe_03_01582-B-0001)
MY NAME IS DEE I'M FROM ATLANTA  (fe_03_01582-B-0002)
OKAY  (fe_03_01582-B-0003)
UM WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ANNE ON THE AIRPORT SECURITY THESE DAYS  (fe_03_01582-B-0004)

HAVE YOU PURPOSELY BEEN AVOIDING FLYING  (fe_03_01582-B-0006)

YEAH  (fe_03_01582-B-0008)
YEAH  (fe_03_01582-B-0009)
I THINK THAT UM IT WAS LONG OVERDUE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE IT LONG TIME AGO  (fe_03_01582-B-0010)
YOU KNOW UM MOST OTHER COUNTRIES EVEN THIRD WORLD [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW HAVE BEEN PUTTING FORTH SOME TYPE OF EFFORT TO DETER TERRORISM AND WE DIDN'T  (fe_03_01582-B-0011)
YOU KNOW IT WASN'T A PART OF OUR VOCABULARY AT THE TIME WELL IT WAS BUT WE JUST DIDN'T RECOGNIZE IT WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING AND I THINK IT'S VERY MUCH NEEDED  (fe_03_01582-B-0012)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_01582-B-0013)
UM YOU KNOW TO ME THAT'S A REAL THIN LINE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHO IS TO SAY WHAT'S ENOUGH  (fe_03_01582-B-0014)
AS IT STAND NOW YOU HAVE TO BE THERE YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF HOURS AHEAD OF TIME 'CAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THE LINE IS GOING TO BE YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING  (fe_03_01582-B-0015)
BUT THE THING IS UM TO ME THAT'S A REAL FINE LINE THERE WHO KNOWS HOW FAR TO GO  (fe_03_01582-B-0016)
YOU KNOW TO ME IT'S BETTER THAN IT WAS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING BEFORE WE WAS JUST SITTING OUT THERE AND ANYBODY WHO EVEN THOUGHT THEY WANTED TO DO ANYTHING THEY HAD NO PROBLEM SUCCEEDING AT IT  (fe_03_01582-B-0017)
SO YOU KNOW NOW WE ARE PUTTING FORTH SOME EFFORT AND UM TO ME WE SHOULD ALWAYS CONTINUE THAT I MEAN TO ME THIS IS THE NEW WAY YOU FLY NOW  (fe_03_01582-B-0018)
AND I THINK THAT IS THE WAY IT'S GOING BE TOO BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY CHANGED THE DOORS ON THE COCKPIT  (fe_03_01582-B-0019)
TO UM MAKE 'EM REINFORCED AND I SAW ON THE NEWS THE OTHER DAY THAT TODAY WOULD BE THE FIRST DAY THAT THEY GRADUATED A CLASS OF PILOTS THAT HAVE PERMISSION AND HAVE BEEN GIVEN LESSONS ON HOW TO USE A GUN  (fe_03_01582-B-0020)

THEY ARE NOT MAKING THE PILOTS TAKE THE CLASS BUT UM YOU KNOW IT'S A VOLUNTARY THING  (fe_03_01582-B-0022)
THE CLASS WAS FULL AND THEY'RE GOING TO START ANOTHER ONE AT THE END AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SUMMER I THINK  (fe_03_01582-B-0023)
SO YEAH I THINK THEY NEED SOME TYPE OF PROTECTION FOR THEMSELVES BECAUSE WHO KNOWS THERE ARE SO MANY CRAZIES RUNNING AROUND  (fe_03_01582-B-0024)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01582-B-0025)

WELL TO ME IT DEPENDS ON THE WAY YOU LOOK AT IT AND THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IF I SEE PEOPLE MORE PEOPLE AROUND UM I SEE YOU BEING REALLY CAUTIOUS ABOUT WHAT'S IN MY BAGS TO ME THAT MAKES ME FEEL SAFE  (fe_03_01582-B-0027)
IT IS A PAIN  (fe_03_01582-B-0028)
'CAUSE IT'S TIME CONSUMING  (fe_03_01582-B-0029)
BUT INSTEAD OF STANDING THERE YOU KNOW WITH YOUR MOUTH STUCK OUT ABOUT IT AND YOU KNOW MUMBLING IN IN A BAD MOOD YOU KNOW JUST ADJUST TO IT THIS IS THE WAY OF LIFE  (fe_03_01582-B-0030)
AT THIS POINT TO ME THIS IS THE WAY OF LIFE UM IT'S NOT EVER GOING TO GO BACK TO BEING THE SAME  (fe_03_01582-B-0031)
I HOPE NOT [LAUGHTER] LOOK WHAT HAPPENED WHEN WE WERE SO LAX  (fe_03_01582-B-0032)
BUT YOU KNOW THEY UM THEY'RE NOT DUMMIES THEY SAW US SITTING OUT IN THE OPENING WITH NO PROTECTION PLAN OR WHATEVER FOR TERRORISM GO BECAUSE THEY I GUESS WE THOUGHT WE WERE TOO BIG FOR IT  (fe_03_01582-B-0033)
