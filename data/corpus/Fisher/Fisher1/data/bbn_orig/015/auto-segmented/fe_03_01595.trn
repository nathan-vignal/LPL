TERRORISM WITHIN THE UNITED STATES FROM  (fe_03_01595-B-0058)
PEOPLE THAT ARE BORN HERE  (fe_03_01595-B-0059)
THAT HAVE GRIPES WITH THE GOVERNMENT BEFORE THEY START GOING AROUND LOOKING FOR ALL THESE TERRORISTS IN THE WORLD BECAUSE [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_01595-B-0060)

LIKE THAT GUY THEY ARRESTED BECAUSE HE MADE SOMEBODY HEARD HIM MAKE A STATEMENT TO HIS WIFE OR WHATEVER  (fe_03_01595-B-0078)
I THINK SOME PEOPLE GO A LITTLE BIT OVERBOARD WITH HOW THEY PERCEIVE TERRORISM  (fe_03_01595-B-0079)
