OKAY  (fe_03_01540-A-0006)
UM  (fe_03_01540-A-0007)
AH I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE SPORT UM SUCH AS BASEBALL WHICH DOES NOT HAVE A SALARY CAP AND I THINK THAT'S ALL RIGHT BUT I THINK IT'S MORE FAIR IF THERE IS A SALARY CAP  (fe_03_01540-A-0008)
IN MY OPINION  (fe_03_01540-A-0009)
YES  (fe_03_01540-A-0010)

I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY ON THE SUBJECT REALLY  (fe_03_01540-A-0019)
AH  (fe_03_01540-A-0020)
I'M NOT SURE IF THERE [NOISE] IS A SALARY CAP ON HOCKEY BUT AH THEY DON'T MAKE AS MUCH AS THE OTHER ONES IT'S NOT AS MUCH OF A POPULAR SPORT AS BASEBALL OR FOOTBALL OR BASKETBALL  (fe_03_01540-A-0021)
YEAH  (fe_03_01540-A-0022)
YEAH I'M SURE THEY GET GOOD SALARIES BUT I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S A SALARY CAP OR NOT THE AVERAGE THE AVERAGE IS PROBABLY LOWER THAN  (fe_03_01540-A-0023)
THE OTHER SPORTS LIKE BASEBALL AND FOOTBALL AND ALL THAT  (fe_03_01540-A-0024)
IT'S JUST NOT AS POPULAR IN THE STATES  (fe_03_01540-A-0025)
BASEBALL I THINK IS WELL I THINK  (fe_03_01540-A-0026)
I THINK SOCCER IS UP THERE IN INTERNATIONAL PLAY  (fe_03_01540-A-0027)
BUT IN THE STATES I THINK BASEBALL WHICH IS AH  (fe_03_01540-A-0028)
LIKE IN THE RANGERS ALEX RODRIGUEZ MAKES  (fe_03_01540-A-0029)
A LOT OF MONEY I THINK HIS CONTRACT WAS WELL OVER A HUNDRED MILLION  (fe_03_01540-A-0030)
YEAH WHICH IS REALLY HIGH HE'S ONE OF THE HIGHEST PAID PLAYERS I THINK  (fe_03_01540-A-0031)
YEAH IT IS  (fe_03_01540-A-0032)
IT'S PART OF THE CONTRACT YEAH A NUMBER OF YEARS I FORGOT WHAT I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT IT'S STILL AN  (fe_03_01540-A-0033)
EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT  (fe_03_01540-A-0034)
SO  (fe_03_01540-A-0035)
WHEN THEY WHAT  (fe_03_01540-A-0036)
YEAH YEAR ROUND  (fe_03_01540-A-0037)
AH YEAH I AM SURE THEY DO BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO PRACTICE AND ALL THAT THEN IT'S JUST THEIR CAREER  (fe_03_01540-A-0038)
BUT  (fe_03_01540-A-0039)
GO AHEAD  (fe_03_01540-A-0040)
NO THEY HAVE A SALARY CAP  (fe_03_01540-A-0041)
FOOTBALL HAS A SALARY CAP ALSO  (fe_03_01540-A-0043)
BUT AH BASEBALL DOESN'T SO YOU CAN WHOEVER IS THE RICHEST THAT'S WHY THE YANKEES EVERYONE SAYS THE YANKEES WIN ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THEY PAY ALL THEIR PLAYERS A LOT OF MONEY AND EVERYONE WANTS TO GO THERE  (fe_03_01540-A-0044)
SO THEY END UP WINNING  (fe_03_01540-A-0045)
YEAH THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE ACTUALLY  (fe_03_01540-A-0046)
ALSO ON THE DEMAND OF THE TEAM HOW GOOD THEY ARE DOING  (fe_03_01540-A-0047)
THE SPORT MAYBE IT COULD BE NEW SO THAT COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE PRICE  (fe_03_01540-A-0048)
[NOISE] GO AHEAD  (fe_03_01540-A-0049)
AH IF WELL IF THEY WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP THEN THEY GET MORE MONEY ACTUALLY  (fe_03_01540-A-0050)
THE LEAGUE WILL GIVE THE TEAM MONEY WHOEVER WINS  (fe_03_01540-A-0051)
THE TEAM ACTUALLY GETS MORE MONEY BUT IN SALARY CAPS OF COURSE THE SALARY CAP WILL ALWAYS BE THE SAME  (fe_03_01540-A-0052)
AND I THINK YOU GET YOU ALSO GET AH MORE MONEY IF YOU GET IN THE PLAY OFFS  (fe_03_01540-A-0055)
AND GET INTO THE FINALS AND THEN WINNING THAT'S EVEN MORE SO THERE'S DIFFERENT LEVELS OF WHAT YOU GET EXTRA  (fe_03_01540-A-0056)
BUT YEAH  (fe_03_01540-A-0057)
YEAH THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY IN SPORTS THAT'S WHY BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCH IT  (fe_03_01540-A-0058)
SUPERBOWL'S THE NUMBER ONE WATCHED SPORT  (fe_03_01540-A-0059)
YEAH  (fe_03_01540-A-0061)
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY ON THE SUBJECT  (fe_03_01540-A-0062)
[LAUGHTER] TEN MINUTES IS A LONG TIME FOR THAT  (fe_03_01540-A-0063)
YEAH EXACTLY  (fe_03_01540-A-0064)
INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS MAKE MORE MONEY IN THE SPORT OF SOCCER THOUGH  (fe_03_01540-A-0065)
BECAUSE I IN MY OPINION I'M PRETTY SURE  (fe_03_01540-A-0066)
IT'S TRUE THAT SOCCER IS THE NUMBER ONE SPORT IN THE WORLD  (fe_03_01540-A-0067)
YEAH IT'S JUST NOT NUMBER ONE IN THE STATES  (fe_03_01540-A-0068)
BUT EVERY EVERY COUNTRY AROUND THE WORLD PLAYS SOCCER  (fe_03_01540-A-0069)
YEAH WE HAVE A SOCCER LEAGUE IN IN AMERICA BUT IT'S JUST NOT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT AS POPULAR AT ALL  (fe_03_01540-A-0070)
I MEAN IF IF YOU LOOK AT THE PLAYERS A LOT OF THE PLAYERS  (fe_03_01540-A-0071)
THE EUROPE THEY HAVE THE BEST LEAGUES OF SOCCER  (fe_03_01540-A-0072)
AND I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE SALARY CAPS EITHER SO  (fe_03_01540-A-0073)
THEY CAN PAY THEIR PLAYERS AS MUCH AS THEY WANT BUT A LOT OF THE RETIRED PLAYERS FROM EUROPE COME OVER TO THE STATES AND PLAY IN THE AMERICAN LEAGUE  (fe_03_01540-A-0074)
BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE TALENT ISN'T HERE THE TALENT IS IN EUROPE OR OTHER PLACES  (fe_03_01540-A-0075)
SO  (fe_03_01540-A-0076)
THIS IS MORE POPULAR BUT YEAH THE SOCCER PLAYERS INTERNATIONALLY GET A LOT OF MONEY SPECIFICALLY IN EUROPE  (fe_03_01540-A-0077)
YEAH  (fe_03_01540-A-0079)
RIGHT NOT AT ALL IT GOT A LITTLE BIT POPULAR DURING THE LAST WORLD CUP AND AND AH U._S._A. MADE IT INTO THE PLAY OFFS BUT THEY DIDN'T GET VERY FAR YEAH  (fe_03_01540-A-0080)
YEAH  (fe_03_01540-A-0081)
EXACTLY IT GOT A LITTLE BIT POPULAR FOR THAT BUT THE POPULARITY WENT DOWN REAL QUICK  (fe_03_01540-A-0082)
YEAH DIDN'T LAST LONG AT ALL I LIKE TO PLAY SOCCER SO I HOPED IT WAS GOING TO GO UP BUT IT DIDN'T WORK OUT  (fe_03_01540-A-0083)
AH WELL THE SALARY IF YOU LOOK AT IT IT IS STILL PRETTY HIGH COMPARED TO OTHER CAREERS PEOPLE PEOPLE WOULD STILL PLAY I MEAN YOU KNOW LIKE THE MINIMUM MIGHT BE LIKE A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS  (fe_03_01540-A-0084)
AND THAT'S A LOT  (fe_03_01540-A-0085)
YEAH SO REGARDLESS I THINK PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS GO INTO SPORT BECAUSE THE SALARY LEVEL IS STILL HIGH  (fe_03_01540-A-0086)
THIS IS COMPARED TO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE SAME SPORT SOME MIGHT GET A LOT MORE THAN OTHERS WHEN THERE IS NO SALARY CAP  (fe_03_01540-A-0087)
THAT'S THAT  (fe_03_01540-A-0089)
THEY DID  (fe_03_01540-A-0091)

HIGH SALARIES  (fe_03_01540-B-0004)
FOR ATHLETES  (fe_03_01540-B-0005)
OKAY  (fe_03_01540-B-0006)
YOU THINK IT'S FAIR IF THERE IS A SALARY CAP UM SO DO I  (fe_03_01540-B-0007)
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE MOST OF THE TIME WHEN THEY MAKE UM AN ABUNDANT AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY HAVE MORE PROBLEMS YOU KNOW AS FAR AS UM DRUG USE AND CRIMINAL BEHAVIOUR  (fe_03_01540-B-0008)
YOU KNOW FOR SOME AND PERHAPS THE MONEY ITSELF COULD BE A FACTOR  (fe_03_01540-B-0009)
NO SO  (fe_03_01540-B-0011)
IS THERE A SALARY CAP ON HOCKEY OR DO THEY MAKE AS MUCH AS THE OTHER PROFESSIONALS DO  (fe_03_01540-B-0012)
REALLY  (fe_03_01540-B-0013)

THAT SEEMS A BIT MUCH  (fe_03_01540-B-0020)
AND THAT'S JUST FOR ONE SEASON OR THAT'S FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS  (fe_03_01540-B-0021)
RIGHT NOW DOES THAT INCLUDE LIKE WHEN THEY UM THAT'S LIKE THAT'S YEAR ROUND  (fe_03_01540-B-0022)

SO THEY'RE PAID WHEN THEY ARE ON OFF SEASON TOO  (fe_03_01540-B-0024)
MHM  (fe_03_01540-B-0025)
I WOULD THINK THAT BA- I ACTUALLY THOUGHT BASKETBALL WAS THE HIGHEST PAID  (fe_03_01540-B-0026)
MHM AND FOOTBALL ALSO  (fe_03_01540-B-0027)
OH OKAY  (fe_03_01540-B-0028)
MHM  (fe_03_01540-B-0029)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01540-B-0030)
YEAH BUT THE HIGHER PERSON GETS PAID DOESN'T IT MAKE IT MAKE US PAY MORE FOR THE COST OF A TICKET  (fe_03_01540-B-0031)
MHM  (fe_03_01540-B-0033)
SO IT'S A TEAM  (fe_03_01540-B-0034)
IF THE TEAM HASN'T ONE A CHAMPIONSHIP IN A FEW YEARS THEN IT MEANS EVERYBODY'S SALARY WILL DROP  (fe_03_01540-B-0035)
OKAY  (fe_03_01540-B-0036)
SO IF THE TEAM WINS THEY GET THEIR ORIGINAL SALARY THAT THEY SIGNED ON FOR PLUS AN ADDITIONAL JUST FOR WINNING  (fe_03_01540-B-0037)
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY  (fe_03_01540-B-0038)
MHM  (fe_03_01540-B-0039)
WOW  (fe_03_01540-B-0040)

TEN MINUTES TO TO TALK ON THAT SUBJECT  (fe_03_01540-B-0046)
WELL WHY IS IT THAT THE INTER- WHY DO YOU THINK IT IS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS MAKE LESS MONEY  (fe_03_01540-B-0047)
MHM  (fe_03_01540-B-0048)
OH SOCCER IS NUMBER ONE SPORT IN THE WORLD  (fe_03_01540-B-0049)
OH OKAY  (fe_03_01540-B-0050)

I DIDN'T KNOW THAT  (fe_03_01540-B-0059)
I ACTUALLY WOULDN'T EVEN THINK YOU KNOW I DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT SOCCER ACTUALLY WHEN THEY SAID THAT YOU KNOW WHEN THEY BROUGHT UP THE SUBJECT  (fe_03_01540-B-0060)
BECAUSE LIKE YOU SAID IT'S NOT TOO POPULAR HERE  (fe_03_01540-B-0061)
BUT THAT'S ALL WE DIDN'T WIN THOUGH WE JUST MADE IT TO THE PLAY OFFS  (fe_03_01540-B-0062)
WELL I GUESS THAT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING  (fe_03_01540-B-0063)
MHM  (fe_03_01540-B-0064)
WOW DIDN'T LAST LONG HUH  (fe_03_01540-B-0065)

AS MANY PEOPLE WHO WOULD PARTICIPATE IN SPORTS IF THEIR SALARIES WERE ACTUALLY LESS  (fe_03_01540-B-0067)

WELL THEY REALLY GAVE US A TOUGH TOUGH SUBJECT HERE  (fe_03_01540-B-0074)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01540-B-0075)
I KNOW IT WOULD MAKE THINGS A LOT EASIER ESPECIALLY SINCE I AM A WOMAN AND I I MEAN I KNOW SOME OF OUR SPORTS AND  (fe_03_01540-B-0076)
EVERYTHING BUT I DIDN'T EXPECT A QUESTION LIKE THIS  (fe_03_01540-B-0077)

AH I LIKE THE NETS BUT THEY'RE NOT MY FAVORITE  (fe_03_01540-B-0085)
NO THEY'RE NOT MY FAVORITE I MEAN IVERSON IS GOOD AND ALL LIKE THAT PLUS I THINK LOTS OF TIMES WHEN THEY MAKE THESE HIGH SALARIES IF YOU NOTICE THEY TEND TO BUY THEIR WAY OUT OF UM SITUATIONS THAT THEY GET IN  (fe_03_01540-B-0086)
AND THEY'RE THEY'RE PUBLIC FIGURES  (fe_03_01540-B-0087)
FOR THE MOST PART FOR PEOPLE THEY ARE BASICALLY PUBLIC FIGURES  (fe_03_01540-B-0088)
AND THAT DOES THEY THEY ARE AN IMAGE FOR CHILDREN WHETHER THEY REALISE IT OR NOT  (fe_03_01540-B-0089)
AND I THINK THAT  (fe_03_01540-B-0090)
MAYBE ALONG WITH ALL OF THAT SALARY THEY SHOULD HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITIES AS TO LIVING UP TO A CERTAIN  (fe_03_01540-B-0091)
STANDARD  (fe_03_01540-B-0092)
YOU KNOW BECAUSE A LOT OF KIDS  (fe_03_01540-B-0093)
THINK WHAT THEY'RE YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY ARE SPORTS PLAYERS THAT THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG AND THEN WHEN THEY DO THE KIDS TRY TO COPY 'EM  (fe_03_01540-B-0094)
SO I THINK IF MAYBE THEY HAD A LITTLE BIT MORE RESPONSIBILITY ALONG WITH THAT  (fe_03_01540-B-0096)
YEAH WHETHER THEY WANT TO BE OR NOT  (fe_03_01540-B-0097)
EVERYBODY EVEN FOR ADULTS THEY'RE ROLE MODELS FOR ADULTS TOO  (fe_03_01540-B-0098)
AND LOTS OF TIMES THEY DON'T REALISE THAT  (fe_03_01540-B-0099)
AND SOME OF THEM I MEAN THEY ARE IN LIKE DARYL STRAWBERRY FOR ONE  (fe_03_01540-B-0100)
[LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW HE'S IN AND OUT OF REHAB I MEAN IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYBODY DON'T GET ME WRONG BUT  (fe_03_01540-B-0101)

YOU KNOW AND HE JUST CONSTANTLY DOES THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER WHERE IF IT WAS YOU OR I  (fe_03_01540-B-0103)
IT WOULDN'T BE TOLERATED  (fe_03_01540-B-0104)
YOU KNOW WOULD NOT BE TOLERATED AND I THINK THAT ALONG WITH THOSE HIGH SALARIES THEY SHOULD HAVE MORAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND A LOT STIFFER ONES THAN WHAT THEY GIVE THEM THEY LIKE SLAP 'EM  (fe_03_01540-B-0105)
