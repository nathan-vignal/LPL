YOU CAN'T HARDLY PINPOINT SOMEONE 'CAUSE I I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT YOU CAN'T HARDLY PINPOINT SOMEONE AS TO WHO'S GIVING TO CHARITY AND WHO ISN'T BUT IT'S EASY TO PINPOINT THOSE WHO ARE LEADING THE STRIKE FOR MORE PAY  (fe_03_01531-B-0041)
THOSE WHO ARE OUT THERE IN MEDIA SAYING LOOK YOU KNOW I GET OUT OF HERE AND THROW A BALL ROUND SO THAT MAKES ME A MULTI MILLIONAIRE AND I'M NOT MAKING ENOUGH MONEY SO GIVE ME SOME MORE  (fe_03_01531-B-0042)
AND I THINK THAT'S RIDICULOUS  (fe_03_01531-B-0043)
AND I THINK THAT THEY COULD GET OUT THERE AND PLAY THE SAME TYPE OF FOOTBALL OR THE SAME TYPE OF BASKETBALL OR WHATEVER SPORT ON THE SAME INCOME THAT A TEACHER OR A NURSE MAKES  (fe_03_01531-B-0044)
THEY MAKE MORE THAN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  (fe_03_01531-B-0045)

IT'S IT'S  (fe_03_01531-B-0056)
RIGHT IT'S A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY  (fe_03_01531-B-0057)
AND I THINK EDUCATION SHOULD BE  (fe_03_01531-B-0058)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01531-B-0059)
THE- THEY'RE TRYING TO PASS A LOTTERY HERE IN OKLAHOMA SO THAT MORE MONEY CAN GO TOWARDS FUNDING EDUCATION AND THERE ARE A LOT PEOPLE OPPOSING IT AND YOU KNOW I'M ONE OF THOSE THAT WILL SAY WELL  (fe_03_01531-B-0060)

ANYTHING GENERATED BY THE LOTTERY WILL GO DIRECTLY TO EDUCATION  (fe_03_01531-B-0064)
I THINK THAT'LL HELP TO A POINT  (fe_03_01531-B-0065)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01531-B-0066)

YOU FIGURE YOU KNOW THE ATHLETES THEY'VE GOT A BETTER SHOT AT HITTING THE MILLIONS BY JOINING UP [MN] IN COLLEGE OR HIGH SCHOOL OR WHATEVER HOPING TO GET A PRO CAREER THAN ANY ONE PERSON DOES HITTING IT IN THE LOTTERY  (fe_03_01531-B-0068)
AND UNFORTUNATELY THE UNITED STATES DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT DOING THE SOCCER AND THAT'S THE BIGGEST SPORT WE HAVE IN THIS AREA OF OKLAHOMA  (fe_03_01531-B-0069)
THAT'S SOCCER MHM  (fe_03_01531-B-0070)
