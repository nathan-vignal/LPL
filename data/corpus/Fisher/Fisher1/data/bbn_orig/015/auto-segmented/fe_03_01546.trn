HOWEVER IT YOU DON'T LIKE YOUR PROFESSION  (fe_03_01546-A-0036)

IF IT DO STRIKE IF STRIKES HELP CHANGE THE PROFESSION THEN  (fe_03_01546-A-0048)
YOU KNOW I'M ALL FOR THAT  (fe_03_01546-A-0049)

UM YOU KNOW WE WANT PEOPLE TO GO IN THOSE PROFESSIONS SO  (fe_03_01546-A-0051)
THEY NEED TO GET TOGETHER AND TRY TO CHANGE THAT SITUATION  (fe_03_01546-A-0052)
YES BUT I THINK FOR PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES  (fe_03_01546-A-0053)
THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO COMPLAIN [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01546-A-0054)
[MN]  (fe_03_01546-A-0055)
I DON'T HAVE ANY SYMPATHY FOR THEM [LAUGHTER] THEY GET SO MANY PRIVILEGES YOU KNOW THEIR PROFESSION CANNOT BE AS BAD AS NURSING OR TEACHING  (fe_03_01546-A-0056)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01546-A-0057)
YES  (fe_03_01546-A-0058)
PLEASE YES  (fe_03_01546-A-0059)
YEAH LOOK AT THE POLICE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01546-A-0060)
YOU CAN SAY THAT THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING YOU KNOW UH PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES THEY THEY'RE A PRIVILEGED GROUP 'CAUSE VERY FEW PEOPLE GET TO BECOME PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES  (fe_03_01546-A-0061)
NO THERE'S YOU YOU KNOW VERY FEW MAKE IT TO THE TOP I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S THE PERCENTAGE ONE PERCENT TWO PERCENT  (fe_03_01546-A-0062)
OF ALL ATHLETES  (fe_03_01546-A-0063)
SO YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01546-A-0064)
THEY'RE ENTERTAINERS GET OVER IT [LAUGHTER] NO THEY SHOULDN'T STRIKE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01546-A-0065)

YES YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT  (fe_03_01546-A-0075)
BUT A LOT OF TIMES WHEN THEY'RE WHEN PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES STRIKE THEY'RE NOT STRIKING BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING TREATED UNFAIRLY THEY'RE THEY'RE STRIKING BECAUSE THEY WANT A FREE AGENT UH OR THEY WANT MORE PAY  (fe_03_01546-A-0076)
MHM  (fe_03_01546-A-0077)
[LAUGHTER] BUT THEY DO [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01546-A-0078)
THIS IS IT'S TERRIBLE HOW THIS SOCIETY UH VALUES CERTAIN PROFESSIONS MORE THAN OTHERS YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01546-A-0079)
[MN]  (fe_03_01546-A-0080)
MHM  (fe_03_01546-A-0081)
YEAH WELL I'M I'M THINKING ABOUT THE BASEBALL STRIKE THAT THEY HAD I DON'T KNOW A YEAR TWO YEARS AGO THREE YEARS AGO AND THEY DIDN'T PLAY [LAUGHTER] BASEBALL  (fe_03_01546-A-0083)
MHM  (fe_03_01546-A-0084)
WHO'S MAKING MONEY OFF OF THEM YES  (fe_03_01546-A-0086)
HI TINA THIS IS RAHOD  (fe_03_01546-B-0001)
UH YEAH I THINK IT WAS ABOUT UH RECENT STRIKE BY PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES  (fe_03_01546-B-0002)
ATHLETES I THINK THAT WAS IT DID DID YOU HEAR SOMETHING ELSE  (fe_03_01546-B-0003)
RECENT STRIKE BY PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES THAT'S WHAT I THINK I HEARD  (fe_03_01546-B-0004)
IS THAT WHAT YOU HEARD  (fe_03_01546-B-0005)
SO  (fe_03_01546-B-0006)
WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ON THAT  (fe_03_01546-B-0007)
I I'M BY THE WAY  (fe_03_01546-B-0008)
LIVE IN ATLANTA HOW ABOUT YOU  (fe_03_01546-B-0009)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_01546-B-0010)
ACTUALLY I'VE JUST MOVED FROM BOSTON  (fe_03_01546-B-0011)
MY MY OPINION IS  (fe_03_01546-B-0014)
SAME BUT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT LIKE I THINK WE SHOULDN'T GENERALIZE THIS JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE PAID HIGHLY  (fe_03_01546-B-0015)
I THINK LIKE EVERY OTHER PROFESSION LIKE EVEN IF SOMEBODY GETS PAID LESS OR MORE  (fe_03_01546-B-0016)
YEAH THAT'S  (fe_03_01546-B-0017)
HEY YOU MUST BE A TEACHER [LAUGHTER] ARE YOU  (fe_03_01546-B-0018)
OKAY WHAT I MEAN TO SAY IS THAT REGARDLESS OF THE PROFESSION AND REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH YOU GET PAID  (fe_03_01546-B-0019)
IF THERE IS SOMETHING UNFAIR YOU SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO  (fe_03_01546-B-0020)
STRIKE JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE PAID HIGHLY YOU CAN TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF SOME LET'S SAY SCIENTIST WHO IS  (fe_03_01546-B-0021)
WORKING HIS LIKE WHOLE LIFE TO DO SOMETHING VERY NOBLE AND SOMETHING AND HE GETS PAID VERY HIGHLY FOR HIS EFFORTS  (fe_03_01546-B-0022)
AND HE GETS SOME UNFAIR TREATMENT  (fe_03_01546-B-0023)
AND THE UNION OF SCIENTISTS DECIDES TO  (fe_03_01546-B-0024)
MAKE STRIKE THAT THEY SHOULDN'T LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IT SHOULDN'T INTERFERE WITH THEIR WORK SO MUCH AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO ACCORDING TO THIS LOGIC YOU WILL SAY THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE PAID HIGHLY THEY SHOULDN'T STRIKE  (fe_03_01546-B-0025)
SO  (fe_03_01546-B-0026)
SO THAT'S WHERE I DIFFER I THINK  (fe_03_01546-B-0027)
WHETHER WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO STRIKE OR NOT OR WHETHER IT IS RIGHT OR WRONG SHOULD REALLY DEPEND ON THE CAUSES OF THE STRIKE  (fe_03_01546-B-0028)
YEAH THAT THAT'S IF THEY ARE STRIKING BECAUSE OF WORKING CONDITIONS  (fe_03_01546-B-0029)
YEAH AND SECONDLY  (fe_03_01546-B-0030)
WHAT IF SOMEBODY APPLIES THIS LOGIC TO A TEACHER'S UNION STRIKING ON SOMETHING THAT HEY IF YOU DON'T LIKE JUST GET OUT MHM  (fe_03_01546-B-0031)
SO SO IN THAT CASE BASICALLY YOUR REASONING HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES  (fe_03_01546-B-0032)
YOU ARE SIMPLY SAYING IF SOMEBODY IS NOT HAPPY JUST LEAVE IT  (fe_03_01546-B-0033)
SO THAT IS A APPLICABLE TO TEACHERS EVERYWHERE  (fe_03_01546-B-0034)
THAT'S A THAT'S A VERY SIMPLIFIED APPROACH I WOULD SAY I MEAN YOU MAY LIKE A PROFESSION YOU MAY WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT AND YOU HAVE REAL QUALIFICATIONS FOR THAT  (fe_03_01546-B-0035)
BUT BUT IT MAY BE THAT SOME THINGS ARE WRONG IN THAT PROFESSION  (fe_03_01546-B-0036)
AND TO PROTEST THAT  (fe_03_01546-B-0037)
STRIKE IS UH IS LIKE A PEACEFUL WAY IN A DEMOCRACY  (fe_03_01546-B-0038)
SO  (fe_03_01546-B-0039)
NOT TAKING THAT RIGHT AWAY FROM YOU AND TELLING YOU THAT HEY IF YOU DON'T LIKE GET OUT I THINK  (fe_03_01546-B-0040)
I THINK THAT THAT'S THE MOST SIMPLIFIED APPROACH [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01546-B-0041)
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF NURSES YOU ARE A TEACHER SO MAYBE YOU WILL RELATE BECAUSE MY WIFE IS A NURSE  (fe_03_01546-B-0042)
LIKE A PROFESSION WHERE IT'S MOSTLY DOMINATED BY WOMEN AND  (fe_03_01546-B-0045)
SO THERE ARE SOME CONDITIONS WHICH ARE BAD AND ALL  (fe_03_01546-B-0046)
SO WHY NOT  (fe_03_01546-B-0047)
SO BUT YOU'RE LOGIC WILL SAY THAT HEY DON'T LIKE IT LEAVE IT AND GO DO SOMETHING ELSE  (fe_03_01546-B-0048)
BUT I WOULD SAY NO  (fe_03_01546-B-0049)
I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE  (fe_03_01546-B-0050)
I WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE LITTLE BIT  (fe_03_01546-B-0051)
HOW YOU THINK ABOUT ATHLETES OR ANY CELEBRITIES  (fe_03_01546-B-0052)
AND THAT THAT IS THAT DON'T JUST THINK THAT THEY'RE EARNING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS LIKE FIRST OF ALL I'M NOWHERE NEAR THAT PROFESSION SO I HAVE NOT PERSONAL INTEREST THERE BUT THEY GENERATE THAT IT IS BASICALLY AN INCOME GENERATING PROFESSION  (fe_03_01546-B-0053)
THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF MONEY BUT BECAUSE OF THAT A LOT OF JOBS ARE CREATED  (fe_03_01546-B-0054)
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WORKING IN THAT INDUSTRY  (fe_03_01546-B-0055)
NO THAT THAT'S TRUE BUT THAT'S THAT'S NOT A YARDSTICK I'D LIKE LIKE THAT YOU CAN SAY ABOUT NURSING ALSO THAT  (fe_03_01546-B-0056)
DON'T STRIKE THERE ARE PROFESSIONS WHICH ARE EVEN WORSE LOOK AT CONSTRUCTION WORKERS OR LOOK AT MINING WORKERS  (fe_03_01546-B-0057)
NO SO THAT'S WHERE ONLY THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR CAN STRIKE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01546-B-0058)
AND DO YOU THINK THEY JUST BECOME LIKE THAT I THINK  (fe_03_01546-B-0059)
THEY HAVE THEY  (fe_03_01546-B-0060)
NOT EVEN THAT JUST ONE PERSON PITCH  (fe_03_01546-B-0061)
SO THEY HAVE WORKED HARD FOR IT AND SURE  (fe_03_01546-B-0062)
NOW NOW THEY'RE IN THAT POSITION SO THEY'RE REAPING THE RETURNS LIKE  (fe_03_01546-B-0063)
IF THERE IS SOME UNFAIR TREATMENT  (fe_03_01546-B-0064)
I THINK THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PROTEST IT  (fe_03_01546-B-0065)
I GUESS THAT'S WHY THIS DISCUSSION THAT EVERYONE CAN HAVE THEIR OPINIONS  (fe_03_01546-B-0067)
WELL YOU KNOW UH WHAT TINA UH I MEAN I HAVE MIGRATED TO AMERICA SO I'VE LEARNED THE THINKING HERE  (fe_03_01546-B-0068)
BUT THIS KIND OF UH THINKING IS MORE IN SOCIALIST COUNTRIES AND ALL  (fe_03_01546-B-0069)
AND BECAUSE OF THAT THINKING  (fe_03_01546-B-0070)
THEY DON'T  (fe_03_01546-B-0071)
THEY DON'T RISE I MEAN HERE IT'S LIKE COMPETITION BE THE BEST YOU CAN  (fe_03_01546-B-0072)
AND  (fe_03_01546-B-0073)
AND YOU WILL THE BEST REWARDS YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SOMEBODY RICH OR SOMETHING YOU'RE A TEACHER SO YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THIS CONCEPT ANYBODY CAN BE ANYTHING  (fe_03_01546-B-0074)
IN MANY COUNTRIES  (fe_03_01546-B-0075)
THE LEADER OF THE COUNT- IF YOU HAVE TO BECOME THE LEADER OF THAT COUNTRY YOU HAVE TO BE BORN IN SOME OF THOSE FAMILY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT  (fe_03_01546-B-0076)
BUT BUT HERE YOU CAN BE A FARMER'S SON AND YOU CAN BECOME THE PRESIDENT  (fe_03_01546-B-0077)
SO SO SURE IF YOU HAVE THIS TALENT  (fe_03_01546-B-0079)
AND YOU ARE REAPING THE REWARDS THAT'S GREAT I MEAN SURE WE CAN BE  (fe_03_01546-B-0080)
SURE WE CAN BE ALSO THAT HEY THAT GUY'S MAKING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS BUT ULTIMATELY THAT PERSON SOMEHOW DESERVED IT  (fe_03_01546-B-0081)
AND REGARDLESS OF THE FACT HOW MUCH THAT PERSON IS MAKING  (fe_03_01546-B-0082)
I THINK IF THAT PERSON IS TREATED UNFAIRLY  (fe_03_01546-B-0083)
HE HAS THE SAME RIGHTS AS A POOR PERSON  (fe_03_01546-B-0084)
BECAUSE YOU CANNOT MHM  (fe_03_01546-B-0085)
EXACTLY THAT'S WHY I SAY THAT REASON  (fe_03_01546-B-0086)
WELL IF THEY ARE STRIKING UNFAIRLY THEN I'M SURE LIKE SOMEBODY CAN SAY HEY GET OUT  (fe_03_01546-B-0087)
SO AGAIN IT'S THE REASONS OF THE STRIKE THAT ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHO IS STRIKING  (fe_03_01546-B-0088)
SO OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE A REVERSE DISCRIMINATION  (fe_03_01546-B-0089)
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT NURSES AND TEACHERS WE ARE SYMPATHETIC BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CELEBRITIES  (fe_03_01546-B-0090)
WE SAY HEY THEY MAKE A LOT OF MONEY LET'S  (fe_03_01546-B-0091)
NOT GIVE THEM ANY MORE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01546-B-0092)
WELL  (fe_03_01546-B-0093)
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THAT WOULD BE A REVERSE DISCRIMINATION  (fe_03_01546-B-0094)
EVERYONE STRIVES TO BE IN THEIR SHOES SO IF YOU MAKE THAT  (fe_03_01546-B-0096)
PROFESSION UGLY IF YOU TAKE ALL THE PRIVILEGES AWAY FROM THAT PROFESSION THEN NOBODY WILL  (fe_03_01546-B-0097)
TRY TO REACH THOSE HEIGHTS SO AGAIN MY OPINION IS IT DEPENDS BECAUSE I AM NOT I GUESS THE TOPIC WAS THE RECENT STRIKE  (fe_03_01546-B-0098)
SO I THINK  (fe_03_01546-B-0099)
I'M NOT EXACTLY FAMILIAR WITH WHAT WAS THE REASONS PROBABLY SOMETHING LIKE AS YOU ARE SAYING THEY WANTED A FREE AGENT OR WHATEVER [LAUGHTER] SO AGAIN  (fe_03_01546-B-0100)
MHM YOU KNOW IT'S NOT ONLY THE PLAYERS WHO ARE MAKING MONEY  (fe_03_01546-B-0101)
PLAYERS ARE WORKING FOR A CLUB THE CLUB IS OWNED BY SOMEBODY WHO IS MAKING PERHAPS LIKE UH MILLIONS AND BILLIONS  (fe_03_01546-B-0102)
SO  (fe_03_01546-B-0103)
YEAH SO PLAYERS ARE TECHNICALLY EMPLOYEES OF THAT CLUB THEY WORK FOR A BOSS  (fe_03_01546-B-0104)
SO  (fe_03_01546-B-0105)
