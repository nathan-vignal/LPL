SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS FOR WAGES SOMETIMES THEY'RE FOR  (fe_03_01562-A-0063)
MAYBE A CONDITION YOU KNOW CERTAIN SAFETY CONDITIONS LIKE IF IT WOULD BE IN YOU KNOW NASCAR OR DIFFERENT THINGS SO I COULD SEE IF IT'S IN SOME LINE LIKE THAT  (fe_03_01562-A-0064)

PEOPLE WILL SAY IF THEY HAVE SOMETHING THEY LIKE THEY'RE QUICK TO FORGIVE I GUESS  (fe_03_01562-A-0074)
YES RIGHT  (fe_03_01562-A-0076)
BUT USUALLY IT CAN'T BE BECAUSE AN IN GENERAL THING  (fe_03_01562-A-0077)
WOULD BE BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS  (fe_03_01562-A-0078)
BEING OFFERED A SEPARATE AMOUNT SO I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER HEARD OF JUST OH I'VE HEARD ONE PERSON THEY USED THE WORD HOLD OUT LIKE ONE PARTICULAR PERSON YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN  (fe_03_01562-A-0079)
BUT IT AIN'T A STRIKE BECAUSE NOBODY'S GETTING THE SAME AMOUNT SO USUALLY LIKE I SAY WHEN THEY DO GO ON STRIKE I AM NOT SURE LIKE I SAY WITH THE BASEBALL ONE  (fe_03_01562-A-0080)
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN EVERYBODY WAS GETTING A SEPARATE AMOUNT SOME COULD HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH THEIR WAGE AND SO AND IT HA- HAD TO BE SOMETHING ELSE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN  (fe_03_01562-A-0081)
BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE AN INDUSTRY WHERE WE WILL SAY EVERYBODY'S MAKING BLANK AN HOUR AND WE'RE YOU KNOW WE ALL WANT A BLANK AN HOUR RAISE IT IT HAD TO BE A LITTLE MORE TO  (fe_03_01562-A-0082)
HI MY NAME IS KENTON ROBERTS  (fe_03_01562-B-0001)
MHM  (fe_03_01562-B-0002)

IS EVERYTHING OKAY ON YOUR SIDE  (fe_03_01562-B-0005)
ALL RIGHT WELL AH TO REITERATE THE TOPIC THEY WERE SHE WAS ASKING WHAT OUR OPINIONS WERE ABOUT AH  (fe_03_01562-B-0006)
ATH- ATHLETES GOING ON STRIKE  (fe_03_01562-B-0007)
YEAH I REMEMBER THAT AH I THINK IT WAS A STRIKE ABOUT WAGES RIGHT  (fe_03_01562-B-0009)
YEAH  (fe_03_01562-B-0010)
FOR ANY KIND OF STRIKE  (fe_03_01562-B-0011)
I DON'T REMEMBER VERY MANY STRIKES YOU KNOW I DON'T I DON'T REALLY LOOK AT YOU KNOW MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL STRIKES AS MUCH AS SOME OF THE OTHERS  (fe_03_01562-B-0013)
IN MY OPINION THOSE BASEBALL PLAYERS GET PAID A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN YOU'D THINK FOR WHAT THEY DO  (fe_03_01562-B-0015)
IF YOU WERE PUT IN THE IN A HOLISTIC SENSE  (fe_03_01562-B-0016)
BASEBALL PLAYERS DON'T ACTUALLY PRODUCE ANYTHING  (fe_03_01562-B-0017)
YOU KNOW THEY DON'T MAKE COMPUTERS OR DESIGN OR MAKE OR OR CREATE CURES OR  (fe_03_01562-B-0018)
ANYTHING LIKE THAT THEY ENTERTAIN  (fe_03_01562-B-0019)
MHM  (fe_03_01562-B-0020)
YEAH  (fe_03_01562-B-0021)
ALSO MY OPINION AH  (fe_03_01562-B-0023)
ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW HOLISTICALLY THEY DON'T MAKE ANYTHING  (fe_03_01562-B-0024)
YOU KNOW WAGES ARE KIND OF SET BY  (fe_03_01562-B-0026)
A DEB- DEMAND AND SUPPLY AND DEMAND LIKE YOU KNOW THE AVERAGE REVENUE COMES IN THROUGH THAT KIND OF THING  (fe_03_01562-B-0027)
BUT AH IT ALSO REFLECTS ON THE WAGES  (fe_03_01562-B-0028)
AND YOU KNOW PROFESSIONAL SPORTS LIKE YOUR BASEBALL AND FOOTBALL AND  (fe_03_01562-B-0029)
YEAH EVEN THAT ONE TOO  (fe_03_01562-B-0031)
THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE SPORT  (fe_03_01562-B-0032)
YEAH  (fe_03_01562-B-0033)
YEAH  (fe_03_01562-B-0034)
REALLY THOSE INDUSTRIES THAT DO NOT PRODUCE ANYTHING I THINK THEY'RE BASICALLY RUN ON DEMAND LIKE PEOPLE  (fe_03_01562-B-0035)
LIKE PEOPLE THAT REALLY ARE INTO THE SPORTS  (fe_03_01562-B-0036)
THEY WOULD ALMOST DEMAND IT IT'S CONSIDERED PART OF THE DEMAND I SUPPOSE  (fe_03_01562-B-0037)
SO THERE IS A HIGH  (fe_03_01562-B-0038)
WANT  (fe_03_01562-B-0039)
TO PUT IN DIFFERENT WORDS A HIGH WANT FOR THESE SPORTS TO SEE THESE PROFESSIONAL LEAGUES GO AT IT  (fe_03_01562-B-0040)
SO IT CONTROLS THESE WAGES THEY LIKE ALL THE PEOPLE WHO GO TO THE GAMES  (fe_03_01562-B-0041)
PUT IN A A PRETTY GOOD CHUNK OF MONEY AND IT GETS POOLED AND DISTRIBUTED SO THERE'S A LOT OF REVENUE IN THERE AND AS FAR AS THOSE BASEBALL CONTRACTS ARE CONCERNED AH  (fe_03_01562-B-0042)
WELL A CONTRACT'S A CONTRACT IF THEY SIGNED ON IT IF THOSE PLAYERS SIGNED ON IT THEN  (fe_03_01562-B-0043)
THEY AGREED TO IT  (fe_03_01562-B-0044)
MHM  (fe_03_01562-B-0045)
YEAH  (fe_03_01562-B-0046)
MHM MHM  (fe_03_01562-B-0047)
WOW  (fe_03_01562-B-0048)
MHM  (fe_03_01562-B-0049)
I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE EVER HEARD OF ANY NASCAR STRIKES  (fe_03_01562-B-0050)
MHM  (fe_03_01562-B-0051)
MHM BUT NOT SO MUCH ON WAGES BUT MAYBE THE CONDITIONS  (fe_03_01562-B-0052)
YEAH THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN IMAGINE IT EITHER I MEAN  (fe_03_01562-B-0053)
IF SOMEBODY COMES UP TO YOU AND OFFERS YOU FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OVER SIX YEARS TO WORK HARD  (fe_03_01562-B-0054)
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THEY PLAY FOR MAYBE SIX HOURS PRACTICE FOR MAYBE TWENTY THIRTY FORTY A WEEK  (fe_03_01562-B-0055)
THAT'S THAT'S STILL A LOT OF MONEY THAT'S MAYBE LIKE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS AN HOUR THEY'RE BEING PAID  (fe_03_01562-B-0056)
SO I'M SURE NOBODY COMPLAINS SO BADLY ABOUT THAT BUT MAYBE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01562-B-0057)
BUT MAYBE LET'S SAY ONE YEAR INTO THE CONTRACT YOU'RE CUT AND YOU DON'T GET LIKE YOU DON'T GET PRO RATED FOR YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOU'VE WORKED FOR FOR THAT AMOUNT OF THE YEAR  (fe_03_01562-B-0058)
THAT WOULD BE PRETTY DISAPPOINTING AND AH  (fe_03_01562-B-0059)
ANGRY ESPECIALLY IF YOU'VE HAD A INJURY  (fe_03_01562-B-0060)
SO BASICALLY YOU WORK FOR THESE PEOPLE YOU DON'T GET THE MONEY AND THEN YOU'RE LEFT CRIPPLED WELL MAYBE NOT CRIPPLED BUT LEFT IN A WAY THAT YOU CAN'T WORK FOR ANOTHER BASEBALL TEAM  (fe_03_01562-B-0061)
MHM  (fe_03_01562-B-0063)
YEAH AH  (fe_03_01562-B-0064)
SO I GUESS DO YOU THINK WE COULD BOTH AGREE THAT AH  (fe_03_01562-B-0065)
IT WILL BE RIGHT FOR THEM TO STRIKE IF THEY HAD IF THERE WAS SOMETHING UNFAIR ABOUT THE CONDITIONS OF THE CONTRACT  (fe_03_01562-B-0066)
YEAH THAT WOULD HAPPEN WITH JUST ABOUT ANYTHING  (fe_03_01562-B-0067)
