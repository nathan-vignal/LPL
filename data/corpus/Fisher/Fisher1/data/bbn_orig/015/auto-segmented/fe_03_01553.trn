OH HI OKAY TOPIC OF CONVERSATION AH DID YOU CATCH THAT ABOUT THE PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES STRIKING  (fe_03_01553-B-0003)
I MEAN I DIDN'T I DIDN'T EXACTLY CATCH EXACTLY WHAT THE TOPIC WAS AS FAR AS  (fe_03_01553-B-0004)
MY OPI- MY OPINION ON THE THE WHOLE  (fe_03_01553-B-0006)
STRIKING THING IS I THINK THEY HAPPEN YOU KNOW THEY'RE PRETTY PRETTY MUCH OVERPAID BUT I DO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE REASONS THAT THEY DO IT  (fe_03_01553-B-0007)
IT'S YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU WOULD THINK THAT AH THEY COULD FIND ANOTHER WAY YOU KNOW TO AH YOU KNOW COME TO SOME SORT OF A COMPROMISE RATHER THAN STRIKING  (fe_03_01553-B-0008)
I DON'T THINK IT HAS AS MUCH TO DO WITH MORE MONEY AS OOH YOU KNOW IT'S THE POWER I THINK THE YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A POWER STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE OWNERS AND THE AH ESPECIALLY THE UNIONS  (fe_03_01553-B-0009)
YEAH THE PLAYERS UNIONS DEPENDING ON THE SPORT  (fe_03_01553-B-0010)
UM YOU KNOW DIFFERENT SPORTS I BELIEVE YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT REASONS BEHIND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND I GUESS I HAVE MORE UM  (fe_03_01553-B-0011)
SYMPATHY FOR SOME SPORTS VERSUS OTHERS BASEBALL PLAYERS I DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF SYMPATHY FOR WHATSOEVER BECAUSE THEY DON'T THERE'S  (fe_03_01553-B-0012)
THERE'S TOO MUCH UM INEQUITIES IN THE WAY THE BASEBALL PLAYERS ARE ARE BEING PAID AS FAR AS AH  (fe_03_01553-B-0013)
THEY DON'T HAVE UM WHAT AM I TRYING REVENUE SHARING AMONGST THE TEAMS TO EVEN THINGS OUT SO THAT MAKES IT PRETTY UNCOMPETITIVE BETWEEN THE TEAMS SO YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I THINK BASEBALL IS DYING  (fe_03_01553-B-0014)
WELL FOOTBALL THEY HAVEN'T HAD A STRIKE IN A WHILE I DON'T THINK THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT BECAUSE FOOTBALL NUMBER ONE DOES HAVE REVENUE SHARING I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU SEE PARITY IN THE LEAGUE  (fe_03_01553-B-0015)
YEAH WELL I MEAN THAT'S  (fe_03_01553-B-0016)
THAT'S THE REASON BEHIND IT BUT  (fe_03_01553-B-0017)
I MEAN BEFORE THEY HAD THE BASEBALL UNION PER SE THE OWNERS DID HAVE WAY TOO MUCH POWER THEY DID YOU KNOW ABUSE THE PLAYERS BACK IN THE YOU KNOW EARLIER PART OF THE CENTURY UP RIGHT THROUGH  (fe_03_01553-B-0018)
INTO THE SIXTIES WHEN THEY HAD THE FIRST STRIKE  (fe_03_01553-B-0019)
SO I MEAN AT THAT POINT I I WOULDN'T AH YOU KNOW I DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEM STRIKING ONLY IN THAT AH  (fe_03_01553-B-0020)
YOU KNOW I THINK THEY KIND OF NEEDED TO BUT THAT WAS ALSO THE POINT AT WHICH AH PLAYER SALARIES STARTED TO INFLATE TREMENDOUSLY  (fe_03_01553-B-0021)
WELL NOBODY IS  (fe_03_01553-B-0022)
STRIKING THAT I KNOW OF RIGHT NOW AND HONESTLY WITH THE PLAYER STRIKES AND EVERYTHING I DON'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO PROFESSIONAL SPORTS ANY MORE OTHER THAN FOOTBALL  (fe_03_01553-B-0023)
I HAVEN'T BEEN A BASKETBALL FAN FOR EONS  (fe_03_01553-B-0024)
EVER SINCE I WAS A YOUNGSTER AND BASEBALL TOO ALTHOUGH I STILL YOU KNOW LIKE THE GAME LIKE TO PLAY IT IT'S KIND OF A BORING GAME [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01553-B-0025)
I MEAN  (fe_03_01553-B-0026)
I'VE I'VE BECOME MORE OF A SOCCER FAN BELIEVE IT OR NOT FOR SOMEBODY I MEAN I'M LIKE FORTY YEARS OLD FOR SOMEBODY TO PICK UP ON SOCCER YOU KNOW AT AN OLDER AGE YOU KNOW YOU'D EXPECT SOMEBODY LIKE ME TO BE A BASEBALL FAN BUT  (fe_03_01553-B-0027)
THE FACT THE PLAYERS AT THIS POINT THEY ARE NOT THE BIG STARS YET AND I THINK THEY THEY WORK HARDER  (fe_03_01553-B-0028)
YEAH I I WAS KIND OF GETTING THE UM THE IMPRESSION THAT THIS MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A REAL COMFORTABLE TOPIC FOR YOU [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01553-B-0029)
OH YEAH WHERE WHERE ARE YOU FROM  (fe_03_01553-B-0030)
OH  (fe_03_01553-B-0031)
I WOULDN'T HAVE I WOULD NOT HAVE PICKED THAT OUT I MEAN UM  (fe_03_01553-B-0032)
ESPECIALLY NASCAR TENDS TO BE A SOUTHERN TYPE OF THING TOO  (fe_03_01553-B-0033)
NO WELL I HONESTLY I DON'T FOLLOW THEM EITHER IF THEY IF THEY'RE ON STRIKE I'M NOT PAYING MUCH ATTENTION I'M STILL AT THE POINT WHERE I PARTICIPATE IN A LOT OF SPORTS SO I DON'T REALLY  (fe_03_01553-B-0034)
PAY ATTENTION AND WATCH WHAT'S ON T._V. LIKE I SAID FOOTBALL I'M A FOOTBALL FAN I'M  (fe_03_01553-B-0035)
I'M IN WISCONSIN HERE  (fe_03_01553-B-0036)
SO IF YOU LIVE HERE YOU KNOW YOU BLEED GREEN AND GOLD EVERYBODY'S A PACKER FAN YOU DON'T HAVE A CHANCE [LAUGHTER] BUT OTHER THAN THAT I'M JUST OUTSIDE OF MILWAUKEE BUT AS FAR AS BASEBALL GOES I COULD CARE LESS IF THE BREWERS STAY OR GO  (fe_03_01553-B-0037)
RHODE ISLAND WHAT KIND OF YOU KNOW WHO WHAT WHO DO YOU FOLLOW IN RHODE ISLAND THE NEW YORK TEAMS  (fe_03_01553-B-0039)
OKAY  (fe_03_01553-B-0040)

RED SOX  (fe_03_01553-B-0042)
OKAY  (fe_03_01553-B-0043)
NO YOU'VE GOT TO GO BY WHAT YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW FOLLOW  (fe_03_01553-B-0044)
I MEAN IN SOME AREAS ESPECIALLY ON THE EAST COAST WHERE A LOT OF THE LARGER METROPOLITAN AREAS ARE CLOSER TOGETHER YOU CAN HAVE PEOPLE IN THE SAME AREA FOLLOWING DIFFERENT TEAMS AND IT'S A BIG FIGHT WHEREAS HERE  (fe_03_01553-B-0045)
YOU KNOW IN WISCONSIN IT'S LIKE YOU'VE GOT ONE TEAM FOR EVERY SPORT YOU KNOW AND THAT'S IT THERE'S NOT REALLY MUCH TO AH ARGUE ABOUT  (fe_03_01553-B-0046)
YOU GO DOWN LIKE MY WIFE IS ACTUALLY FROM ILLINOIS SO AND BASEBALL THAT'S A BIG FIGHT BETWEEN THE SOX FANS AND THE AH CUBS FANS  (fe_03_01553-B-0047)
SO YOU KNOW BUT UP HERE THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT  (fe_03_01553-B-0048)
YOU KNOW THAT'S MORE OR LESS YOU LISTEN TO A SPORTS TALK SHOW AND ALL YEAR ROUND IT'S FOOTBALL YOU KNOW THEY DO TALK ABOUT HOW BAD THE BREWERS ARE OR HOW GOOD THE BUCKS AREN'T BUT  (fe_03_01553-B-0049)
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING YOU KNOW LIVES AND DIES BY THE PACKERS AROUND HERE ALTHOUGH COLLEGE SPORTS YEAH COLLEGE SPORTS ARE PRETTY GOOD AROUND HERE TOO  (fe_03_01553-B-0050)
UM THEY DO HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FOLLOWING FOR AH COLLEGE BASKETBALL WITH MARQUETTE AND COLLEGE HOCKEY IN WISCONSIN BUT AND FOOTBALL OF COURSE AGAIN  (fe_03_01553-B-0051)
BUT NOW WE ARE GETTING OFF TOPIC BUT HOW LONG CAN YOU REALLY TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW PLAYER STRIKES [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01553-B-0052)
I MEAN I CAN'T EVEN I'M A I'M FAIRLY UP ON SPORTS BUT I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE LAST TIME  (fe_03_01553-B-0053)
IT WAS LIKE TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT A POSSIBLE LOCK OUT IN AH  (fe_03_01553-B-0054)
BASEBALL AND IN IN MY OPINION  (fe_03_01553-B-0055)
BASEBALL DOES NEED REVENUE SHARING BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO GET A TEAM LIKE MILWAUKEE OR CINCINNATI OR PITTSBURGH TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE WITH A NEW YORK TEAM THAT HAS ALL THE MONEY  (fe_03_01553-B-0056)
BUT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED I MEAN BASEBALL IS JUST NOT IT'S NOT THAT EXCITING A SPORT YOU KNOW THEY JUST BUILT  (fe_03_01553-B-0057)
TWO YEARS AGO A BRAND NEW STADIUM HERE IN MILWAUKEE AND IT'S AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED I'M A TRADITIONALIST AND IT'S GOT THAT THE THE DOME THAT OPENS AND CLOSES AND THAT'S BEEN A THAT'S BEEN A FIASCO HERE THE THING ALL LAST YEAR IT LEAKED  (fe_03_01553-B-0058)

BUT I WENT TO ONE GAME AND IT JUST HAPPENED IT WAS A CUBS GAME BECAUSE MY WIFE WANTED TO GO SEE THE CUBS I COULDN'T CARELESS ABOUT IT ACTUALLY SEEING THE BREWERS AND I DIDN'T LIKE  (fe_03_01553-B-0061)
AND I USED TO GO TO A COUPLE OF GAMES EVERY YEAR AND I DIDN'T EVEN LIKE GOING THERE BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE YOU WERE IN A BIG GARAGE IT'S JUST NOT BASEBALL  (fe_03_01553-B-0062)
YEAH WELL I MEAN I GREW UP GOING MY DAD PLAYED BASEBALL WE HAD A LOT OF BASEBALL LEAGUES IN THE AREA IN THE SUMMER TIME MY DAD WAS A BIG BASEBALL PLAYER I PLAYED BASEBALL AND I GREW UP WITH IT OUT AND IT WAS  (fe_03_01553-B-0063)
YOU KNOW KIND OF A COMMUNITY THING EVERYBODY WENT OUT TO THE BALL GAME ON SUNDAYS AND YOU KNOW THERE WASN'T AS MUCH OTHER THINGS TO DO AND THAT WAS THAT WAS REALLY NEAT BUT NOW  (fe_03_01553-B-0064)
YOU KNOW THERE'S SO MANY OTHER SPORTS AND I GUESS IT'S SOCCER HAS TAKEN OFF HERE I DON'T KNOW IF SOCCER'S BIG ON THE EAST COAST I KNOW AH UM NEW ENGLAND HAS A BIG AH M._L._S. TEAM  (fe_03_01553-B-0065)
