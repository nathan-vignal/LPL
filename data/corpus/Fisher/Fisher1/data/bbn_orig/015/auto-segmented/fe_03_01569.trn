YOU KNOW THEIR GOALS WERE MOSTLY TO  (fe_03_01569-A-0033)
PLAY THE SPORT AND NOT OBTAIN SO- ANY KIND OF EDUCATION AS WELL SO UM IF THEIR LIVELIHOOD IS DEPENDENT UPON  (fe_03_01569-A-0034)
THEM ACTUALLY PERFORMING THEN I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD BITE THE HAND THAT FEEDS THEM ALSO AND IT TENDS TO ACTUALLY AL- ALSO  (fe_03_01569-A-0035)
UPSET THE  (fe_03_01569-A-0036)

IT WILL JUST OKAY WELL IT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS NOW AND GO ON WITH LIFE AND WE'LL BOWL AS OPPOSED TO GO TO A GAME UM OR DO SOMETHING ELSE SO  (fe_03_01569-A-0041)
WHAT I THINK SOMETIMES THE ATHLETES DON'T REALIZE IS THAT [NOISE] YOU HAVE SOME DIE HARD FANS BUT  (fe_03_01569-A-0042)
YOU'RE NOT A CULT IT'S NOT A A FOLLOWING TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST GOING TO LAY THEIR LIVES OUT FOR YOU  (fe_03_01569-A-0043)

NO NOT AT ALL  (fe_03_01569-A-0045)
SO WITH THEM STRIKING AND YOU KNOW YOU'D THINK SOME OF THE FAMILIES WOULD GET INVOLVED THEIR FAMILIES AND TELL THEM HOW RIDICULOUS THEY'RE BEING  (fe_03_01569-A-0047)
BUT MAYBE THEIR FAMILIES ARE ACTUALLY PUSHING THEM  (fe_03_01569-A-0048)
TO MAKE MORE MONEY  (fe_03_01569-A-0049)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01569-A-0050)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_01569-A-0051)
AND YOU KNOW WITH THAT I FIND INTERESTING ALSO THE ONES THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S VERY FEW ATHLETES THAT ARE JUST REALLY EXCEPTIONAL  (fe_03_01569-A-0052)
LIKE THE MICHAEL JORDANS OR THE UM  (fe_03_01569-A-0053)
OR THE WHATEVER IN BASEBALL BUT  (fe_03_01569-A-0054)
YOU KNOW I I THINK MAYBE A- AS THE PAY SCALE I GUESS THEY DO GET PAID MORE THAN THE AVERAGE BUT THE AVERAGE WHO MIGHT NOT HIT A BALL ALL SEASON  (fe_03_01569-A-0055)
WILL MAKE A MILLION  (fe_03_01569-A-0056)
AND EXACTLY WHAT DID YOU DO BESIDES NOTHING  (fe_03_01569-A-0057)

FOR DOING  (fe_03_01569-A-0062)
NOTHING  (fe_03_01569-A-0063)
HASN'T HIT A BALL ALL SEASON HASN'T CAUGHT ANYTHING ALL SEASON HAS NOT MADE A PLAY ALL SEASON  (fe_03_01569-A-0064)
AND ALSO THOUGH SOMETHING ELSE IT IS A SEASON  (fe_03_01569-A-0065)
IT'S NOT A YEAR TIME A A FULL-TIME JOB  (fe_03_01569-A-0066)
THEY PERFORM DURING [NOISE] I THINK TWO MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR THE REST ARE IN SOME KIND OF TRAINING CAMP  (fe_03_01569-A-0067)
OR DOING NOTHING AND  (fe_03_01569-A-0068)
AH TEACHERS WHO ONLY HAVE THREE MONTHS OFF DO NOT GET GET GET PAID FOR THOSE THREE MONTHS THEN THEY ARE THE ESSENCE OF OUR OF OUR SOCIETY SO  (fe_03_01569-A-0069)
I IT'S JUST I THINK IT'S VERY  (fe_03_01569-A-0070)
AH IT JUST MAKES THEM LOOK LIKE VERY POOR THEY HAVE POOR CHARACTER THEY HAVE POOR UM JUDGEMENT  (fe_03_01569-A-0071)
AND IT'S JUST GREED  (fe_03_01569-A-0072)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_01569-A-0073)
I MEAN LOOK AT EVEN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY WHERE THE PILOTS MECHANICS AND STEWARDESS WHO ARE PROFESSIONALS AT AT AND ACTUALLY HAVE A VERY UM  (fe_03_01569-A-0074)
UM SPECIFIC TRADE THAT THEY DO THEY TOOK A CUT IN ORDER TO KEEP THEIR THEIR INDUSTRY MOVING AND KEEP THEIR JOBS AND THESE  (fe_03_01569-A-0075)
PEOPLE  (fe_03_01569-A-0076)
MHM  (fe_03_01569-A-0077)
AND THEN THERE'S NOTHING ELSE FOR THEM TO DO  (fe_03_01569-A-0078)
YEAH OR TO BECOME SPORTS ANNOUNCERS  (fe_03_01569-A-0079)
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT AND THEIR AND THEIR SKILLS AS IN WRITING READING MATHM- MATHEMATICS IS JUST POOR  (fe_03_01569-A-0080)
AND AND THEY HAVE NO WHERE ELSE TO GO AT THAT POINT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS AND THEN THEY HAVE THE GALL  (fe_03_01569-A-0081)
TO STRIKE AND ASK FOR MONEY WHEN THEY HAVE NO OTHER SKILLS UNLIKE THESE OTHER PROFESSIONALS WHO HAVE VERY SPECIFIC SKILLS VERY NEEDED SKILLS  (fe_03_01569-A-0082)
UM ARE TAKING PAY CUTS  (fe_03_01569-A-0083)
TO KEEP THEIR INDUSTRY MOVING  (fe_03_01569-A-0084)
YEAH  (fe_03_01569-A-0085)
I THINK ALSO A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT  (fe_03_01569-A-0087)
AH UNLIKE BASEBALL IF THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY FAILS BUSINESS STARTS TO FAIL  (fe_03_01569-A-0088)
WHERE YOU NEED TO GO TO SEMINARS AND MEET HAVE MEETINGS AND SUCH  (fe_03_01569-A-0089)
SUFFERS FOR THAT IT TRICKLES DOWN WHERE IF THERE'S NOT A BASEBALL GAME OH WELL  (fe_03_01569-A-0090)

HI MY NAME IS SAMANTHA [NOISE]  (fe_03_01569-B-0001)
HI  (fe_03_01569-B-0002)
HOW ARE YOU THIS EVENING  (fe_03_01569-B-0003)
GOOD  (fe_03_01569-B-0004)
UM WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SPEAKING ABOUT THE STRIKES OF PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES  (fe_03_01569-B-0005)
WHICH I BELIEVE IS JUST A CRY FOR ATTENTION TO GET MORE PUB- PUBLICITY AND GET THEIR NAMES OUT  (fe_03_01569-B-0006)
AND TO MAKE PEOPLE END UP  (fe_03_01569-B-0007)
PAYING THEM MORE ATTENTION SO THAT THEY MAKE MORE MONEY  (fe_03_01569-B-0008)
AND JUST MEDIA TIME  (fe_03_01569-B-0009)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01569-B-0010)
I DON'T EITHER AND THE FACT THAT THEY WERE TO STRIKE OVER SOMETHING AS PETTY AS MOST OF THEM DO  (fe_03_01569-B-0011)
JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME WHATSOEVER  (fe_03_01569-B-0012)
EXACTLY IT'S PURELY ENTERTAINMENT  (fe_03_01569-B-0013)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01569-B-0014)
I MEAN I FIND MYSELF [NOISE] WATCHING MANY SPORTS BUT IT'S NOT FOR PURPOSE OF TO SEE WHO STRIKE THAT DAY OR WHO DID WHATEVER IT'S PURELY AN ENTERTAINMENT  (fe_03_01569-B-0015)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01569-B-0016)
AND I SEE OTHER PEOPLE LOSING OUT BECAUSE WHEN ONE PERSON STRIKES THAT'S ANOTHER THAT DOESN'T MAKE THEIR MONEY FOR THE DAY  (fe_03_01569-B-0017)
SO IT'S NOT FAIR TO THEM IN THAT RESPECT  (fe_03_01569-B-0018)
JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY IS WHINING ABOUT SOMETHING THEY DIDN'T GET OR SOMETHING THAT THEY WANT THAT'S REALLY JUST  (fe_03_01569-B-0019)
NOT EVEN WITHIN REASON  (fe_03_01569-B-0020)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01569-B-0021)
ATHLETES THAT CONTRIBUTE SO MUCH TO DIFFERENT CHARITIES OR  (fe_03_01569-B-0023)
EVENTS BUT THEN THERE'S THE ONES THAT COMPLAIN CONSTANTLY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GETTING BUT THEY'RE NOT GIVING ANYTHING TO GET ANYTHING BACK  (fe_03_01569-B-0024)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01569-B-0025)
RIGHT AND THERE ARE DIE HARD FANS THAT ARE DETERMINED  (fe_03_01569-B-0026)
TO GO TO THIS GAME OR THAT GAME BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO THEM THEY LOSE  (fe_03_01569-B-0027)
AMONG MANY OTHER PEOPLE  (fe_03_01569-B-0028)

YEAH [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01569-B-0030)
YES IT'S NOT A NECESSITY BY ANY MEANS  (fe_03_01569-B-0031)
AND ARE JUST AS MONEY HUNGRY AS THEY ARE  (fe_03_01569-B-0032)
BECAUSE THEY GET TIED INTO THESE BIG HOMES AND EXPENSIVE CARS AND JEWELLERY AND WHATEVER ELSE IT'S HARD TO LET GO  (fe_03_01569-B-0033)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01569-B-0034)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01569-B-0035)
THEY ARE THE FIRST ONES TO COMPLAIN  (fe_03_01569-B-0036)
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HEAR OF ANY MICHAEL JORDANS OR TIGER WOODS OR ANYBODY LIKE THAT COMPLAINING  (fe_03_01569-B-0037)
AND THEY'RE THE TRUE STARS  (fe_03_01569-B-0038)
YOU SEE THEM THE NEWSPAPERS HAVE THEM IT'S ALL OVER THE INTERNET  (fe_03_01569-B-0039)
BUT SOME NO NAME NEW GUY WILL BE THE FIRST ONE TO STAND UP AND SAY WELL THIS ISN'T FAIR  (fe_03_01569-B-0040)
I NEED MORE  (fe_03_01569-B-0041)
I WANT MORE  (fe_03_01569-B-0042)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01569-B-0043)

OR DOING NOTHING  (fe_03_01569-B-0045)
RIGHT THEY'RE LEFT TO FEND  (fe_03_01569-B-0046)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_01569-B-0047)
IT IS  (fe_03_01569-B-0048)
I AGREE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT BECAUSE  (fe_03_01569-B-0049)
I COULD SEE TEACHERS COMPLAINING  (fe_03_01569-B-0050)
OR  (fe_03_01569-B-0051)
ANYBODY ELSE THAT HAS TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES FOR THIS MANY MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR  (fe_03_01569-B-0052)
TO MAKE MONEY TO FEED THEIR FAMILIES THESE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE MONEY HANDED TO THEM AND THEY STILL COMPLAIN  (fe_03_01569-B-0053)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01569-B-0054)
BUT I SEE THAT AS BEING A DEVOTION WHERE A LOT OF THESE SPORTS PLAYERS FALL INTO SOMETHING  (fe_03_01569-B-0055)
THEY BECAME A HIGH SCHOOL STAR WHICH MOVED THEM TO BEING A COLLEGE STAR  (fe_03_01569-B-0056)
AND ALL THIS EGO  (fe_03_01569-B-0057)
IT'S A COMPLETE EGO TRIP THEY ARE TOLD YOU'RE THE BEST IN HIGH SCHOOL AND MAY HAVE BEEN MEDIOCRE IN COLLEGE  (fe_03_01569-B-0058)
AND THEN END UP GETTING A PRO  (fe_03_01569-B-0059)
JOB AND THEN THAT'S IT  (fe_03_01569-B-0060)
RIGHT BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T GONE TO COLLEGE OR ANYTHING  (fe_03_01569-B-0061)
THEY SKID THROUGH COLLEGE  (fe_03_01569-B-0062)
JUST TO BE ABLE TO PLAY THESE SPORTS  (fe_03_01569-B-0063)
OH YEAH  (fe_03_01569-B-0064)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01569-B-0065)
AND TO KEEP THEMSELVES GOING BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT FROM AN INSIDE  (fe_03_01569-B-0066)
KIND OF PLACE WHERE YOU COULD SEE WELL IF THEY DON'T HAVE A JOB THEIR FAMILIES STAVE TO DEATH  (fe_03_01569-B-0067)
THEY LOSE THEIR HOMES THEY HAVE NOTHING  (fe_03_01569-B-0068)
SO YOU TAKE THE PAY CUT TO FEED THE MOUTHS IN YOUR HOUSE  (fe_03_01569-B-0069)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01569-B-0070)
THEN EVERYBODY  (fe_03_01569-B-0071)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01569-B-0072)
