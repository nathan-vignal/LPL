UH UH THE ONLY THING I COULD PROBABLY ADD TO THAT IS IN THE RECENT MONTHS THAT I HAVE FLOWN YOU WILL RUN INTO UH  (fe_03_01589-A-0016)
SITUATIONS WHERE UH AS YOU SAID GRANDMA AND GRANDPA IT AMAZES ME  (fe_03_01589-A-0017)
AND THAT'S ONE REASON I SAID IT IT AMAZES ME HOW THESE SECURITY PEOPLE SEEM TO CHECK EXACTLY  (fe_03_01589-A-0018)
THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I WOULD SUSPECT THEY SHOULD CHECK IT JUST SEEMS UH I MEAN WE CAN'T STEREOTYPE PEOPLE BUT UH  (fe_03_01589-A-0019)
I HAVE SEEN SOME CHECKING THAT IS JUST OUTRAGEOUS  (fe_03_01589-A-0020)
WHEREAS I HAVE SEEN SOME THINGS GO THROUGH THE GATES THAT I JUST AM APPALLED BY THAT I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WEREN'T EVEN LOOKED AT TWICE SO UH  (fe_03_01589-A-0021)
THERE'S A L- LOT INVOLVED THERE AND I DON'T KNOW THESE ARE S- SUPPOSEDLY PROFESSIONALS  (fe_03_01589-A-0022)
THAT UH CONDUCT THESE THINGS I DON'T KNOW HOW GOOD THEIR TRAINING IS BUT  (fe_03_01589-A-0023)
IN MY INSTANCES I HAVE SEEN SOME PEOPLE THAT UH  (fe_03_01589-A-0024)
THERE IS NO WAY I WOULD H- HARASS OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT THESE INDIVIDUALS UH  (fe_03_01589-A-0025)
'CAUSE [LAUGHTER] LIKE YOU SAID THEY'RE GRANDMA AND GRANDPA THEY AIN'T DOING ANYTHING TO NOBODY  (fe_03_01589-A-0026)
AND UH IN OTHER ASPECTS I'VE SEEN PEOPLE THAT YOU'D THINK THEY WOULD TRY TO STOP AND CHECK OUT AND THEY THEY DON'T SEEM TO THEY LOOK THE OTHER WAY  (fe_03_01589-A-0027)
SO I AM VERY LEERY ABOUT HOW WELL THE AIRPORT SECURITY ACTUALLY IS TO BE VERY HONEST WITH YOU  (fe_03_01589-A-0028)
I I BELIEVE WE WERE SUPPOSED TO HIRE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF UH  (fe_03_01589-A-0029)
WORKERS TO TAKE CARE OF THIS AFTER UH NINE ELEVEN  (fe_03_01589-A-0030)
AND UH  (fe_03_01589-A-0031)
I I BELIEVE THIS HIRING MUST BE GOING ON I'M NOT SURE I HAVEN'T SEEN AT MY LOCAL AIRPORT I HAVE NOT SEEN NOTHING UH  (fe_03_01589-A-0032)
TOTALLY CHANGED UH AS FAR AS THAT GOES IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE'S JUST MORE TIME RESTRAINTS AND UH  (fe_03_01589-A-0033)
IT'S REAL HARD TO IDENTIFY BUT THEN AGAIN BEING A  (fe_03_01589-A-0034)
NORMAL U._S. CITIZEN IT'S NOT MY JOB TO SIT THERE AND IDENTIFY WHO MIGHT BE A  (fe_03_01589-A-0035)
TERRORIST OR  (fe_03_01589-A-0036)
UH BE DOING THINGS SO  (fe_03_01589-A-0037)
I JUST THINK IT'S SOMETHING YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK INTO A HECK OF A LOT MORE THAN WE HAVE ALREADY WE I DON'T THINK WE'VE PUT A HECK OF A LOT OF TIME AS YOU SAID I BELIEVE THERE'S OTHER ALTERNATIVES AND I DON'T KNOW WHO'S LOOKING INTO 'EM BUT I'VE REALLY NOT SAT BACK AND THOUGHT ABOUT IT ALL THAT MUCH OKAY [NOISE] [NOISE]  (fe_03_01589-A-0038)

MHM OH NO I KNOW IT IT IS A DIFFICULT JOB I'M NOT DENYING THAT AT ALL IT IT'S JUST AS I SAID UM  (fe_03_01589-A-0042)
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE MAYBE THE TRAINING OR SOME ASPECT OF IT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO A LITTLE FURTHER  (fe_03_01589-A-0043)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01589-A-0044)
CORRECT  (fe_03_01589-A-0045)
YES IT IS IT DEFINITELY IS  (fe_03_01589-A-0046)
MY-  (fe_03_01589-A-0047)
RIGHT MY EXPERIENCE I WAS A MILITARY POLICE OFFICER SOME YEARS AGO  (fe_03_01589-A-0048)
UH AND I DID A._W._O._L. ESCORTS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES MEANING RIDING PRISONERS ON COMMERCIAL JET AIRLINERS  (fe_03_01589-A-0049)
UH I DID HAVE TO CARRY A WEAPON ON THE PLANE I HAD THREE WAYS OF DOING IT ONE WAS UH GIVING THE LOADED WEAPON TO THE PILOT EVEN AT THAT TIME OKAY B. RIGHT OR KEEPING MY WEAPON WITHOUT THE AMMUNITION  (fe_03_01589-A-0050)
OKAY  (fe_03_01589-A-0051)

LAST INTO THE BACK ROWS UM  (fe_03_01589-A-0053)
EVEN AT THAT TIME THIS IS BEFORE [NOISE] ALL THIS OCCURRED IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE WAS  (fe_03_01589-A-0054)
NOBODY REALLY ALL THEY WANTED TO DO IS GET TO THEIR DESTINATIONS AND IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE A BIG DEAL TO ANYONE  (fe_03_01589-A-0055)
AS FAR AS THAT GOES AND UH  (fe_03_01589-A-0056)
I KNOW THAT'S NO ANSWER THAT'S IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT I FEEL AND UH I JUST THINK TRAINING'S GOT TO BE MORE EXTENSIVE AND SCREENING OF THE PEOPLE HAS TO BE A LITTLE MORE EXTENSIVE  (fe_03_01589-A-0057)
OKAY  (fe_03_01589-A-0058)
OH I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT  (fe_03_01589-A-0059)

BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF HEALTH RISKS AS FAR AS THAT GOES SOME PEOPLE JUST CAN'T  (fe_03_01589-A-0067)
WELL RIGHT ANY TIME YOU INSTILL FEAR IN SOMEONE  (fe_03_01589-A-0068)

I DO TOO UH BUT I I THINK PRETTY MUCH THAT IT THAT UM  (fe_03_01589-B-0008)
IT IT IT SHOULD BE REFORMED IN A WAY WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TO UM LIKE YOU KNOW GRAB GRANDMA GRANDPA IN THEIR GOLDEN AGE IF THEY GET READY TO GO AND TAKE A FLY  (fe_03_01589-B-0009)
UM TO SOME UM LIKE UM MONTEGO BAY OR SOME PLACE LIKE THAT YOU KNOW WHERE THEY NEVER BEEN BEFORE AND THEY SAVED UP ALL THEIR MONEY I MEAN OF COURSE WE KNOW  (fe_03_01589-B-0010)
WE KNOW THEY'RE NOT NO TERRORISTS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT UM  (fe_03_01589-B-0011)
BUT THEN  (fe_03_01589-B-0012)
YEAH WE- WELL THAT'S TRUE TOO WE WOULD HOPE NOT BUT THERE'S NO WAY OF REALLY TELLING YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN BECAUSE UM THEN THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT IS IS IS A KIND OF DEGRADING  (fe_03_01589-B-0013)
ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT THEN WE DO NEED THAT BECAUSE  (fe_03_01589-B-0014)
THAT STOPS A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLES FROM GETTING YOU KNOW HURT  (fe_03_01589-B-0015)
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN SO I MEAN I CAN'T I CAN'T REALLY KNOCK THAT OR WHAT HAVE YOU  (fe_03_01589-B-0016)
BUT HOWEVER I WOULD LIKE TO TRY TO FIND SOME WAYS TO IMPROVE IT WHERE  (fe_03_01589-B-0017)
YOU KNOW I MEAN THERE'S GOT TO BE ANOTHER SOLUTION OR SOMETHING OR OTHER LIKE THAT OTHER THAN THE SOLUTION THAT WE HAVE OR WE CAN STILL USE THAT SOLUTION AND ANOTHER SOLUTION  (fe_03_01589-B-0018)
TO WORK UM WITH IT UM WHERE PEOPLES CAN FEEL STILL COMFORTABLE AND UH SECURITY CAN STILL DO THEIR JOB AS WELL UM I WAS THINKING PRETTY MUCH OF FINDING HOW  (fe_03_01589-B-0019)
UM THE SECURITY PEOPLE FEEL THAT WORK SECURITY IN THE AIRPORTS HOW DO THEY FEEL ABOUT IT UM  (fe_03_01589-B-0020)
YOU KNOW DO THEY HAVE SOME TYPE OF IDEAS OR WHAT HAVE YOU BUT SOME CHANGES COULD BE MADE TO MAKE PROGRESS A LOT BETTER OR TO MAKE IT BETTER THAN WHAT IT IS YOU  (fe_03_01589-B-0021)

UM BUT I FROM THE YEARS THAT I HAVE WORKED AS AS AS AS AS UM Y- Y- YOU CAN'T JUST WORK I MEAN YOU CAN GO ON INSTINCTS ON CERTAIN PARTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND AND THE- THEN THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE I BELIEVE  (fe_03_01589-B-0028)
ON THE PEOPLES THAT WORK SECURITY ALSO  (fe_03_01589-B-0029)
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO CONSTANTLY LOOK YOU KNOW IT'S PRETTY MUCH LIKE A TRAFFIC CONTROLLER YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP YOUR EYE ON THAT SCREEN  (fe_03_01589-B-0030)
YOU KNOW AND SEE WHAT'S COMING UP YOU DON'T WANT THE PLANE TO CRASH INTO ANOTHER WELL YOU'RE KEEPING YOUR EYE ON UH ON THE SCANNER TO MAKE SURE NO METALS IS COMING THROUGH THERE AND THEN IF THERE IS ANY KIND OF WHAT HAVE YOU  (fe_03_01589-B-0031)
AND THEY ONLY HAVE WHAT IS IT PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES OR SOMETHING OTHER LIKE THAT THAT THEY USE  (fe_03_01589-B-0032)
THAT DOESN'T EVEN SHOW UP SO IT MAKES IT EVEN MUCH MORE HARDER YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN  (fe_03_01589-B-0033)
YEAH RIGHT  (fe_03_01589-B-0034)
YEAH WELL I I I AGREE WITH THAT UM BECAUSE SOME KIND OF SUBTLETY HAS TO BE UM HAS TO WHEN WHEN YOU SURE THAT A PERSON IS NOT BRINGING NOTHING ON  (fe_03_01589-B-0035)
YOU KNOW WELL YOU WANT THEM TO ALSO ENJOY THEIR TRIP AND IF THE THE THE NOT TO FEEL LIKE THEY BEING THREATENED WHEN THEY GET ON A PLANE  (fe_03_01589-B-0036)

BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING CAN GO B- SOMETHING CAN GO WRONG WITH THAT BUT PUTTING 'EM OUT AS YOU WOULD KNOW OF YEAH I I WOULD SAY THAT THAT WAY THE OTHER UM CIVILIANS THAT WOULD BE ON THE PLANE  (fe_03_01589-B-0053)
