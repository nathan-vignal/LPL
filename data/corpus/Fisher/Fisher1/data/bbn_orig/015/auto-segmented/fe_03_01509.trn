HI MY NAME'S GREG I'M I'M ACTUALLY FROM CALIFORNIA  (fe_03_01509-A-0003)
UM  (fe_03_01509-A-0004)
YEP I I I GUESS I HAVE TO SAY I HAVEN'T MADE ANY [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01509-A-0005)
I JUST KIND OF LIVE MY LIFE AS USUAL SINCE SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH  (fe_03_01509-A-0006)
HOW ABOUT YOU  (fe_03_01509-A-0007)
YEAH I'D SAY I DO THAT TOO  (fe_03_01509-A-0008)
I'D I'D SAY I DO THE SAME THINGS BUT I I DON'T  (fe_03_01509-A-0009)
I THINK IT'S MORE OF JUST  (fe_03_01509-A-0010)
BUT I MEAN  (fe_03_01509-A-0012)
THE THE CORPORATE WORLD BEHIND THE TERRORIST ATTACKS  (fe_03_01509-A-0014)
THEY'VE KIND OF MADE A BAD NAME  (fe_03_01509-A-0015)
FOR THEIR  (fe_03_01509-A-0016)
FELLOW COMRADES  (fe_03_01509-A-0017)
ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN'T DO IT INTENTIONALLY THAT'S WHAT THAT'S HAPPENED  (fe_03_01509-A-0018)
I THINK THE ONLY CHANGES I'VE REALLY MADE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE REALLY OUT OF MY CONTROL  (fe_03_01509-A-0019)
SUCH AS LIKE GOING TO THE AIRPORT AND HAVING FREE SECURITY AND STUFF LIKE THAT BUT I THINK THOSE THINGS ARE GOOD JUST JUST TO MAKE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE AND IDEALLY MAKE YOU ACTUALLY SAFER ENOUGH TO FEEL SAFER  (fe_03_01509-A-0020)
THAT'S MORE COMFORTING THAT WAY  (fe_03_01509-A-0022)
I'D I'D SAY I DO THE SAME THINGS BUT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN KIND OF INTERESTED IN CURRENT EVENTS IN THE NEWS SO I I GUESS SOMETIMES I GET MORE GLUED TO IT BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE I THINK I HAVE MORE FREE TIME  (fe_03_01509-A-0023)
'CAUSE I'M NOT IN SCHOOL SO I HAVE MORE FREE TIME TO  (fe_03_01509-A-0024)
WATCH THE NEWS AND  (fe_03_01509-A-0025)
KEEP UP WITH WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD I FIND THAT LOCAL STUFF ANY MORE JUST LETTERS GOING ON  (fe_03_01509-A-0026)
AND I LIKE TO KEEP UP WITH THOSE THINGS BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW SOMETHING SOME KNOWLEDGE MIGHT COME IN HANDY FOR WHATEVER REASON  (fe_03_01509-A-0027)
I MEAN NOT CRITICAL OF EVERYTHING THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES BUT ESPECIALLY SINCE  (fe_03_01509-A-0030)
BUSH BECAME PRESIDENT I'VE BEEN A LOT MORE CRITICAL BECAUSE I DON'T AGREE WITH ANYTHING HE DOES  (fe_03_01509-A-0031)
THAT'S JUST MY OPINION I MEAN  (fe_03_01509-A-0032)
I MEAN YOU MAY BE QUITE THE OPPOSITE BUT BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU SEEM TO HAVE A SIMILAR POINT OF VIEW  (fe_03_01509-A-0033)
OH YEAH I I FULLY AGREE WITH THAT MM I THINK THAT AH  (fe_03_01509-A-0034)
I THINK IT'S QUITE EVIDENT THAT BUSH IS GOING INTO IRAQ FOR THE OIL I MEAN THERE'S TO ME THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT  (fe_03_01509-A-0035)
BECAUSE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THE REASON FOR THE WAR WE HAVEN'T FOUND ANY OF THAT AND THE WAR TECHNICALLY IS KIND OF OVER  (fe_03_01509-A-0036)
AND WE STILL HAVEN'T FOUND ANY OF THAT AND NOW HE WANTS TO GET THE AH  (fe_03_01509-A-0037)
OIL EMBARGO LIFTED OFF OF IRAQ SO THEY CAN SELL THEIR OIL  (fe_03_01509-A-0038)
AND WANTS IT YEAH AND THERE'D BE NO OTHER REASON WHY HE WANTS IT OFF SO SOON  (fe_03_01509-A-0039)
AND  (fe_03_01509-A-0040)
SO I DON'T KNOW I DON'T THINK ANYONE CAN BE TRUSTED ANY MORE IF YOU LOOK AT FRANCE AND RUSSIA  (fe_03_01509-A-0041)
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO WAR BECAUSE THEY HAVE INTERESTS IN IRAQ IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE AGAINST THE WAR  (fe_03_01509-A-0042)
THEY THEY HAVE THINGS THERE THAT THEY'RE CONNECTED TO  (fe_03_01509-A-0043)
LIKE TRAINING MILITARY PEOPLE ARE SELLING THEM THINGS AND OTHER THINGS THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO UNCOVER  (fe_03_01509-A-0044)
I JUST THE GOVERNOR OF YOUR STATE RAN FOR PRESIDENT HE SEEMS PRETTY AH ON  (fe_03_01509-A-0045)

MHM OH DEFINITELY  (fe_03_01509-A-0050)
DOES DOES YOUR STATE HAVE ANY ISSUES LIKE CALIFORNIA DOES WITH THEIR GOVERNOR THOUGH WHERE THEY DO SOME THINGS THAT SEEM VERY SUSPICIOUS  (fe_03_01509-A-0051)
THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA IS A DEMOCRAT HE'S NOT A REPUBLICAN BUT I'D I'D SAY HE IS VERY SIMILAR TO BUSH  (fe_03_01509-A-0053)
HE DOES THINGS THAT ARE VERY VERY SELF MOTIVATED AND FOR HIS OWN HIS OWN INTEREST  (fe_03_01509-A-0054)
YEP  (fe_03_01509-A-0055)
OH YEAH YEAH HE LIKE PROFITED FROM THAT TOO  (fe_03_01509-A-0056)

I MEAN EITHER YOU DID OR YOU DIDN'T RIGHT  (fe_03_01509-A-0058)
AND IF YOU DIDN'T THERE ISN'T MUCH MORE TO EXPAND ON  (fe_03_01509-A-0059)
MHM THAT'S A PROBLEM THE SNOW REMAINS ALL THE TIME  (fe_03_01509-A-0060)
