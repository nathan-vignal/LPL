MY NAME IS MIKE  (fe_03_00591-A-0001)
UM SO WE JUST ENGAGE IN CONVERSATION THEN [NOISE]  (fe_03_00591-A-0002)
YEAH UM [LIPSMACK] WELL MY PERSONAL THOUGHTS ARE THAT UM  (fe_03_00591-A-0003)
WE SHOULD ENGAGE WITH THE UNITED NATIONS WE SHOULD FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE PLANNED UM INSPECTIONS TO COMPLETION  (fe_03_00591-A-0004)
AND IF THE PARDON  (fe_03_00591-A-0005)
THEN I THINK THAT THE BEST STEP FOR THE UNITED STATES WERE TO UM  (fe_03_00591-A-0006)
WOULD BE TO FORM ALLIANCES WITH NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES TO PUT ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC PRESSURE ON [SIGH]  (fe_03_00591-A-0007)
IRAQ IN OTHER WORDS MAKE IT ECONOMICALLY BENEFICIAL FOR THEM AND ALSO  (fe_03_00591-A-0008)
SOCIALLY  (fe_03_00591-A-0009)
[SIGH] UM BENEFICIAL FOR THE LEADERSHIP I DON'T THINK GOING IN AND [SIGH] STARTING A WAR IS GOING TO  (fe_03_00591-A-0010)
MAKE IRAQ FEEL ANY MORE SECURE ABOUT ITSELF AND THEREFORE GIVE UP ANY MEANS OF DEFENSES  (fe_03_00591-A-0011)
I AGREE UM BASED ON THE PAST RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IRAQ AND THE UNITED STATES [SIGH] UM MAINLY THEIR ALLIANCE TO FIGHT IRAN  (fe_03_00591-A-0012)
A LOT OF INFORMATION AND TRAINING WAS PASSED ON TO IRAQ THAT AMERICA HASN'T MADE PUBLIC AND SO IT'S ANOTHER VERY GOOD POINT YOU MAKE [SIGH] I THINK AMERICA COULD INFORM [SIGH] THE UNITED NATIONS  (fe_03_00591-A-0014)
UM A LOT MORE THAN IT HAS ON WHAT POTENTIALS TO EXPECT FROM IRAQ IN TERMS OF THEIR [SIGH] THEIR WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION  (fe_03_00591-A-0015)
UH YEAH I ALSO AGREE TO WITH UM THE INNOCENTS THAT REALLY BOTHERS ME I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY EVEN TRULY A WAR IT JUST SEEM MORE LIKE AN [SIGH]  (fe_03_00591-A-0016)
UM AN AGGRESSIVE MUSCLING OF A SOVEREIGN NATION TO  (fe_03_00591-A-0017)
OBEY THE WILL OF UH OF ANOTHER  (fe_03_00591-A-0018)
[SIGH] UM EVEN IF THE LEADERSHIP OF IRAN IS OF IRAQ SORRY IS VERY INCONVENIENT IT NEVERTHELESS IS A SOVEREIGN COUNTRY  (fe_03_00591-A-0019)
SO [LIPSMACK] YEAH I AGREE [SIGH] HA I DON'T UNDERSTAND AT ALL THIS RUSH UM I THINK WAR SHOULD BE THE MOST SERIOUS OF DECISIONS  (fe_03_00591-A-0020)
AND UM JUST LIKE WITH A  (fe_03_00591-A-0021)
A CAPITAL TRIAL BASED ON PERHAPS A PERSON'S UM COMMITTING OF A MURDER THEY HAVE [SIGH] MANY MANY APPEALS [SIGH]  (fe_03_00591-A-0022)
THEY HAVE NO LIMIT OF TIME JUSTICE IS THE PRIMARY CONCERN AND THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE THE CONCERN OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT AT THIS TIME  (fe_03_00591-A-0023)
YEAH THAT THAT IS A GOOD POINT BUT UM  (fe_03_00591-A-0024)
IF THEY  (fe_03_00591-A-0025)
YOU SEE THE IF THEY DO HAVE ALL THIS AMAZING SATELLITE UM TECHNOLOGY IF THEY DO [SIGH]  (fe_03_00591-A-0026)
UM MAINTAIN THEIR THEIR FLYING ZONES OVER THE NORTH AND SOUTH OF IRAQ I THINK THAT THEY WOULD BE EASILY IN A POSITION TO MONITOR ANY  (fe_03_00591-A-0027)
UM OF THE SCALE OF MOVEMENT REQUIRED TO MOVE STORAGE TO MOVE UM LABORATORIES THOSE KINDS OF THINGS  (fe_03_00591-A-0028)
S- SO I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT OVERNIGHT IRAQ COULD CHANGE AND GET AWAY WITH I THINK THAT AMERICA WOULD BE VERY CAREFULLY OBSERVING FROM EVERY MEAN THEY EVERY MEANS THEY HAD [SIGH]  (fe_03_00591-A-0029)
THAT'S TRUE BUT UH THE MOVEMENT ITSELF UNLESS IT WAS DONE WITH  (fe_03_00591-A-0030)
PREEXISTING UNDERGROUND TUNNELS WHICH  (fe_03_00591-A-0031)
TO MY KNOWLEDGE WHAT I'VE READ DON'T REALLY EXIST IF THEY MA- MADE A CONVOY OF TRUCKS  (fe_03_00591-A-0032)
IF THEY UM  (fe_03_00591-A-0033)
[LIPSMACK] UH ESTABLISHED A NEW STORAGE SITE I THINK UM  (fe_03_00591-A-0034)
EVEN THE SM- SMALLEST OF BUILDINGS ITS CONSTRUCTION COULD BE  (fe_03_00591-A-0035)
MONITORED FROM  (fe_03_00591-A-0036)
COMPREHENSIVE SATELLITE IMAGING WITH FLYOVER RADAR SCANS [SIGH]  (fe_03_00591-A-0037)
UM OR EVEN OLD FASHIONED INTELLIGENCE GATHERING  (fe_03_00591-A-0038)
UM YEAH I I DO KNOW THAT JUST A SMALL AMOUNT OF CHEMICAL CAN CAUSE A LOT OF DAMAGE [SIGH]  (fe_03_00591-A-0039)
BUT I I STILL DON'T SEE THAT THIS WHOLE IDEA OF A SOVEREIGN COUNTRY BEING ATTACKED BY ANOTHER  (fe_03_00591-A-0040)
WITH JUST ALLEGATIONS IS DISTURBING TO ME AND UM  (fe_03_00591-A-0041)
AND UNTIL IT'S PROVEN  (fe_03_00591-A-0042)
[LIPSMACK] YES I I DON'T THINK WAR I THINK [SIGH] IF WE PUT AS MUCH EFFORT INTO DIPLOMACY WITH NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES OF IRAQ WHO H- WHO SHARE A [SIGH] RELIGIOUS UM SIMILARITY AND ALSO A CULTURE BACKGROUND [SIGH] THEN I THINK WITH THEIR  (fe_03_00591-A-0043)
GENTLE LEANINGS  (fe_03_00591-A-0044)
THEY COULD UM MOLD  (fe_03_00591-A-0045)
A DIFFERENT MAYBE A SENSE OF SECURITY WITHIN IRAQ SO THEY WOULDN'T FEEL THE NEED TO POSTURE AS THEY ARE RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_00591-A-0046)
[LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I DON'T KNOW I THINK THAT UM  (fe_03_00591-A-0047)
INSTABILITY IN THE MID EAST HAS ACTUALLY BEEN  (fe_03_00591-A-0048)
SOMETHING USEFUL TO THE UNITED STATES IT'S ALLOWED THEM TO BUILD AN IN- INCREDIBLY LOPSIDED POWER IN THE STATE OF ISRAEL  (fe_03_00591-A-0049)
WITH ALL THESE ALLEGED ENEMIES AND I THINK THAT IF THERE WAS PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST UM  (fe_03_00591-A-0050)
AMERICA WOULD HAVE A LOT LESS OF A  (fe_03_00591-A-0051)
A MILITARY PRESENCE AND THEREFORE A LOT LESS OF A  (fe_03_00591-A-0052)
UM  (fe_03_00591-A-0053)
A DECIDING VOICE SINCE WE HAVE NEVER REALLY SEEMED TO APPROACH THINGS DIPLOMATICALLY WE'VE HAD AL- THIS COUNTRY HAS ALWAYS USED ITS MUSCLE [SIGH]  (fe_03_00591-A-0054)
AND UM  (fe_03_00591-A-0055)
[LIPSMACK] I THINK THAT IF IT WERE TO  (fe_03_00591-A-0056)
MOVE TOWARDS DIPLOMACY WE'D GET A LOT MORE DONE  (fe_03_00591-A-0057)
[SIGH] THAN WHAT IT'S DEMONSTRATED SO FAR JUST WITH FORCE I FIND THE [LAUGHTER] THE ARAB PEOPLE TO BE IN THEIR HISTORY A VERY RESILIENT AND REMEMBERING RACE  (fe_03_00591-A-0058)
WELL YEAH I I I ALWAYS LINK DIPLOMACY WITH SOMETHING OF BENEFIT TO THEM SO  (fe_03_00591-A-0059)
UM MIL- UM ECONOMIC AID AND DEVELOPMENT UM  (fe_03_00591-A-0060)
ON A SIMILAR PAR WITH WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH ISRAEL [SIGH] IF WE WERE SHOW THOSE SAME  (fe_03_00591-A-0061)
UM  (fe_03_00591-A-0062)
IF THAT IF WE SHOWED THE SAME WILLINGNESS TO HELP DEVELOP SOME OF THOSE OTHER POORER COUNTRIES OF WHICH IRAQ IS ONE  (fe_03_00591-A-0063)
[SIGH] EVEN THOUGH THEY DO HAVE A UM A REVENUE FROM OIL IF WE WERE TO GIVE THEM  (fe_03_00591-A-0064)
OTHER MEANS OF UH DEVELOPING THEMSELVES WE'D ESTABLISH A FRIENDSHIP BASE NOT JUST TALK AND RHETORIC BUT ACTUALLY AN INVESTMENT OF OUR TIME MONEY AND EXPERTISE AND TECHNOLOGY [SIGH]  (fe_03_00591-A-0065)
MORE LIKE A  (fe_03_00591-A-0066)
A SITTING DOWN AND EXPLAIN TO THE [SIGH] THAT WE WE AREN'T AN ENEMY TO BE FEARED AND HENCE ARMED AGAINST  (fe_03_00591-A-0067)
MY NAME IS AMANT  (fe_03_00591-B-0001)
NICE TO MEET YOU  (fe_03_00591-B-0002)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00591-B-0003)
SO THE TOPIC IS UH ABOUT DISARMING IRAQ  (fe_03_00591-B-0004)
BUT WHAT IF  (fe_03_00591-B-0006)
GOING THROUGH THE UNITED NATIONS DOES NOT GET YOU THE RESULT  (fe_03_00591-B-0007)
THAT UNITED STATES EXPECT  (fe_03_00591-B-0008)
CORRECT AND THAT IS MY OPINION TOO AS FAR AS  (fe_03_00591-B-0009)
BECAUSE WAR NOT ONLY BRINGS HARDSHIP TO A LOT OF INNOCENT PEOPLE  (fe_03_00591-B-0011)
THERE ARE FAR GREATER CONSEQUENCES  (fe_03_00591-B-0012)
IN TERMS OF UH  (fe_03_00591-B-0013)
INNOCE- LOTS OF INNOCENT LIVES BEING DESTROYED AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT KIND OF WAR WOULD IT LEAD TO  (fe_03_00591-B-0014)
LIKE HOW LONG IT WOULD LAST HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD DIE  (fe_03_00591-B-0015)
AND UH  (fe_03_00591-B-0016)
IT IT MAY SPREAD OVER TO MORE THAN JUST IRAQ LIKE IT MAY SPREAD OVER TO NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES  (fe_03_00591-B-0017)
ISRAEL MAY BE INVOLVED SO YOU ARE NOT VERY SURE LIKE HOW THE WAR'S GOING TO BE FOUGHT  (fe_03_00591-B-0018)
BUT YES  (fe_03_00591-B-0019)
[LIPSMACK] THE ONE THING THAT'S DISTURBING ME IS WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION  (fe_03_00591-B-0020)
AND UNITED STATES SHOULD BE FORTHRIGHT IN  (fe_03_00591-B-0021)
GIVING OUT DETAILS OR OTHER EVIDENCES OF  (fe_03_00591-B-0022)
THAT KIND  (fe_03_00591-B-0023)
SO THAT WHATEVER IRAQ IS PORTRAYING  (fe_03_00591-B-0024)
UNITED STATES CAN TELL THE WORLD THAT THAT IT'S NOT CORRECT RIGHT  (fe_03_00591-B-0025)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00591-B-0026)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00591-B-0027)
NOBODY IS SAYING THAT SADDAM IS GOOD OF COURSE LIKE EVERYONE KNOWS  (fe_03_00591-B-0028)
HE HAS DONE LOTS OF UH THINGS THAT ARE NOT APPROPRIATE BUT YES UH  (fe_03_00591-B-0029)
ATTACKING ANYONE WITHOUT EVIDENCE OUR WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION  (fe_03_00591-B-0030)
MAY CAUSE HARDSHIPS TO EVERYONE  (fe_03_00591-B-0031)
RIGHT BUT YOU MAY HAVE TO ALSO CONSIDER  (fe_03_00591-B-0032)
THE  (fe_03_00591-B-0033)
THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT THEMSELVES WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION THEY HAVE MAYBE THE INFORMATION THEY HAVE IS TOO STRONG  (fe_03_00591-B-0034)
OR TOO OR  (fe_03_00591-B-0035)
WHAT YOU MAY CALL  (fe_03_00591-B-0036)
THAT THE INFORMATION MAY BE  (fe_03_00591-B-0037)
MAY BE SO STRONG THAT THEY CAN'T PASS IT ON OVER TO THE COMMON PUBLIC  (fe_03_00591-B-0038)
BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS THE FEAR THAT IF INFORMATION IS SPREAD OUT THEN  (fe_03_00591-B-0039)
MAYBE THEY KNOW WHERE THE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION  (fe_03_00591-B-0040)
IT MIGHT GIVE TO THEM A CHANCE TO JUST RELOCATE THOSE WEAPONS SOMEWHERE ELSE  (fe_03_00591-B-0041)
RIGHT BUT WHAT ABOUT CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS LIKE FROM WHAT I HEARD IT COULD BE  (fe_03_00591-B-0043)
CONCEALED IN A SUCH A SMALL AREA THAT EVEN THE SATELLITES WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DETECT IT  (fe_03_00591-B-0044)
RIGHT [SIGH] MAYBE THEN WE ALL THINK THAT SOME THINGS NEED TO BE CHANGED BUT THE MANNER IN WHICH THE CHANGE HAS TO BE DONE SHOULD BE DIFFERENT A BIT DIFFERENT  (fe_03_00591-B-0045)
RIGHT BUT HASN'T UNITED STATES TRIED THAT FOR A LONG TIME AND THEY MUST SURELY HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT ALL THOSE POSSIBILITIES BEFORE DECIDING ON THIS COURSE  (fe_03_00591-B-0046)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00591-B-0047)
YEAH BUT JUST DIPLOMACY SOMETIMES DOES NOT GIVE YOU THE DESIRED RESULT  (fe_03_00591-B-0048)
THAT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THAT UH THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ AND THE UNITED STATES GET CLOSER CLOSER TO EACH OTHER  (fe_03_00591-B-0051)
OF COURSE LIKE  (fe_03_00591-B-0052)
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ENGAGING THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ  (fe_03_00591-B-0053)
SADDAM WOULD ALWAYS COME INTO PROMINENCE HE'S ONE GUY WHOM WE WOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH IF UNITED STATES HAD TO DEAL WITH IRAQ  (fe_03_00591-B-0054)
AND THE U._S. IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH DEALING WITH HIM AS THINGS STAND RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_00591-B-0055)
