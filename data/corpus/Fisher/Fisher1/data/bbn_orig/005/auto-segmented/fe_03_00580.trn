HI I'M LINDA  (fe_03_00580-A-0001)
[LIPSMACK] [SIGH] THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD POINT [SIGH]  (fe_03_00580-A-0002)
[SIGH] I THINK IT'S ALWAYS A PRIORITY TO UM  (fe_03_00580-A-0004)
JUST AS FAR AS MASS WEAPONS OF DESTRUCTION GOES TO DISARM ANYBODY WHO HAS THEM [SIGH] BUT UM [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_00580-A-0005)
I THINK WE MIGHT BE MAKING IT INTO A MUCH BIGGER DEAL THAN IT IS [SIGH] U._N. INSPECTORS ARE OVER THERE THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB AND YET THE UNITED STATES IS STILL INSISTING THAT WE NEED TO GO OVER THERE AND WE NEED TO GO OVER THERE NOW [SIGH] AND THAT KINDA CONCERNS ME [SIGH] [SIGH]  (fe_03_00580-A-0006)
[SIGH] RIGHT YEAH [SIGH] I I DON'T THINK WE'RE GIVING THE U._N. INSPECTORS ENOUGH CREDIT [SIGH] BECAUSE BEFORE THEY WENT OVER THERE [SIGH] WE WERE  (fe_03_00580-A-0008)
[SIGH] CONSTANTLY SAYING THAT IRAQ HAD WEAPONS AND THEY WERE HIDING 'EM AND THEY WERE GETTING READY TO USE THEM  (fe_03_00580-A-0009)
[SIGH] AND BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT WE THOUGHT THE U._N. WOULD EVER GET IN THERE BUT NOW THAT THE U._N.'S IN THERE AND THEY'RE NOT REALLY FINDING A WHOLE HECK OF A LOT WE OUR ATTITUDE STILL HASN'T CHANGED [LAUGHTER] WE'RE STILL SAYING THE SAME THING THAT WE SAID BEFORE THEY WENT IN THERE  (fe_03_00580-A-0010)
[SIGH] [LAUGHTER] RIGHT PLUS I MEAN U._N. INSPECTORS CAN'T BE EVERYWHERE AT ONCE [SIGH] IF IF IF THEY'RE LOOKING IN ONE PLACE THERE'S NO NOTHING THAT SAYS THAT HE CAN'T MOVE THEM FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER PLACE TO ANOTHER PLACE WHILE THE U._N. INSPECTORS ARE THERE [SIGH] [SIGH]  (fe_03_00580-A-0011)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_00580-A-0012)
[SIGH] RIGHT CONSIDERING IT I MEAN IT'S A HUGE COUNTRY I MEAN [LAUGHTER] TO SEARCH AN ENTIRE COUNTRY YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE SEARCHING YOU KNOW [SIGH] UH A SMALL CITY OR ANYTHING FOR SOME WEAPONS I MEAN YOU YOU HAVE TO SEARCH AN ENTIRE COUNTRY THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A WHILE [SIGH]  (fe_03_00580-A-0013)
YEAH EXAC- EXACTLY [SIGH] IT IS A TOUGH THING [SIGH] I AGREE UM THAT THE UNITED STATES MIGHT BE TOO INTERESTED IN GETTING INTO ANOTHER WAR [SIGH] I MEAN  (fe_03_00580-A-0014)
I THINK THAT UH PERHAPS THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF A FAMILY CLEAN UP PROJECT GOING ON BECAUSE [SIGH] WE HAVE THE SON OF YOU KNOW  (fe_03_00580-A-0015)
GEORGE BUSH SENIOR IN OFFICE [SIGH] WHO COULDN'T QUITE GET SADDAM AND NOW THAT HIS SON'S IN THERE IT'S KIND OF LIKE HIS SON'S TRYING TO FINISH UP THE WORK HIS FATHER COULDN'T [SIGH]  (fe_03_00580-A-0016)
[LAUGHTER] [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_00580-A-0017)
EXACTLY YEAH HE WOULD HE WOULD TURN IT AROUND ON US [SIGH]  (fe_03_00580-A-0018)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00580-A-0019)
THAT'S R- YEAH THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A VERY BIG CONCERN IS IS JUST HOW MUCH THEY'RE WORTH TO US IN AS FAR AS OIL GOES  (fe_03_00580-A-0021)
[SIGH] BUT I THINK AS AS  (fe_03_00580-A-0022)
LIKE UH THE QUESTION IS AS TO [MN] I- IRAQ BEING A PRIORITY  (fe_03_00580-A-0023)
I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS ON OUR PLATE RIGHT NOW THAT ARE REALLY NEED TO BE TAKEN CARE OF FIRST WHERE IRAQ WOULDN'T BE AT THE TOP OF THE LIST BECAUSE WE HAVE LOTS OF TROOPS OVER IN AFGHANISTAN RIGHT NOW [SIGH] AND IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE THEY'VE ALMOST BEEN PUT OF A BACK BURNER  (fe_03_00580-A-0024)
[SIGH] WHEN THEY'RE OUT THERE PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE FOR WHAT OUR PRESIDENT IS TELLING 'EM TO AND NOW YOU OPEN UP IRAQ'S DOOR [SIGH] AND THEY'VE ALREADY SAID THAT THEY HAVE NO PROBLEM PUTTING US ON A TWO FRONT WAR  (fe_03_00580-A-0025)
AND THAT REALLY CONCERNS ME TO USE AMERICA'S RESOURCES IN TWO DIFFERENT FRONTS LIKE THAT [SIGH] IT SEEMS LIKE YOU WOULD [SIGH] IT WOULD BE AT A DISADVANTAGE FOR OUR OUR MILITARY FORCES [SIGH] TO NOT CONCENTRATE ON ONE WAR AT A TIME  (fe_03_00580-A-0026)
RIGHT EXACTLY [SIGH] YEAH 'CAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE GONNA [SIGH] THEY'RE GONNA THROW THE NATIONAL GUARD OVERSEAS AND AND ONCE YOU START THROWING THE RE- NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVES IN [SIGH] NO ONE'S LEFT HERE AT HOME [SIGH] SO  (fe_03_00580-A-0027)
[SIGH] [SIGH] IT AND YOU KNOW WHAT CONFUSES ME AND WHAT MAKES ME THINK THAT MAYBE HE'S GOING INTO IRAQ FOR A PERSONAL FAMILY REASON [SIGH] IS  (fe_03_00580-A-0028)
BEFORE U._N. WENT OVER THERE [SIGH]  (fe_03_00580-A-0029)
WE WERE SAYING THEY HAVE ALL THESE WEAPONS WE NEED TO GO OVER AND WE NEED TO STRIKE NOW  (fe_03_00580-A-0030)
U._N. WENT OVER THERE THEY SAID NO WE'RE NOT FINDING ANYTHING [SIGH] MEANWHILE NORTH KOREA RAISES THEIR HAND AND SAYS HEY WE HAVE WEAPONS WE HAVE A MILLION WEAPONS WE HAVE LOTS AND LOTS OF WEAPONS AND WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING [LAUGHTER] WE JUST KIND OF PUT THAT WE'RE LIKE YEAH OKAY  (fe_03_00580-A-0031)
WHATEVER AND WE JUST KIND OF SHUN THEM ASIDE WHEN [SIGH] I DON'T UNDERSTAND IF IF WE'RE SO CONCERNED ABOUT WEAPONS AND THAT'S OUR REASONING FOR GOING INTO IRAQ [SIGH] THAT WHY AREN'T WE SO CONCERNED WITH NORTH KOREA  (fe_03_00580-A-0032)
YEAH  (fe_03_00580-A-0033)
RIGHT I 'CAUSE I MEAN HE [MN] GEORGE BUSH HAS SUCH [SIGH] AS HE AS HE PUTS IT HIS IMMINENT WAR ON TERROR  (fe_03_00580-A-0034)
[SIGH] AND IT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE HE'S NOT GIVING EVERYBODY HIS EQUAL EFFORT YOU KNOW HE HE  (fe_03_00580-A-0035)
ATTA- UH HE WENT AFTER AFGHANISTAN AFTER THEY CAME AFTER US PUT A HUNDRED PERCENT INTO THAT [SIGH] AND THEN JUST ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WAS LIKE WELL MIGHT AS WELL GO TO IRAQ [SIGH] IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE SENSE IF THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE OUT THERE WHO IS BLATANTLY YOU KNOW PUTTING  (fe_03_00580-A-0036)
PUTTING AMERICA AT RISK AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES [SIGH] THAT ARE IN AMERICA'S INTEREST [SIGH] TO NOT GIVE THEM ANY ATTENTION THE WAY THAT HE HAS AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ  (fe_03_00580-A-0037)
HI MY NAME'S LANA [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_00580-B-0001)
HI LINDA UM [LIPSMACK] AS FAR AS IRAQ GOES I THINK THAT WE HAVE SOME OBLIGATION [SIGH] TO  (fe_03_00580-B-0002)
DISARM THEM  (fe_03_00580-B-0003)
BUT MY FEAR IS THAT IF WE DO UM THEY WILL PUT  (fe_03_00580-B-0004)
WOMEN AND CHILDREN BEHIND THEIR GUARDS AND  (fe_03_00580-B-0005)
WE WIND UP KILLING INNOCENT PEOPLE  (fe_03_00580-B-0006)
YEAH I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT TOO I ALMOST HAVE THE FEELING THAT UM  (fe_03_00580-B-0007)
[SIGH] [LIPSMACK] OUR GOVERNMENT THINKS THAT UM THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO SOLVE IT  (fe_03_00580-B-0008)
AND I I THINK THAT WE NEED TO GIVE THOSE INSPECTORS A LITTLE MORE TIME [SIGH] TO UM TRY TO FINISH WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND SEE IF IRAQ WON'T COOPERATE  (fe_03_00580-B-0009)
[LAUGHTER] [SIGH] I AGREE UH I THINK THAT WE [SIGH] EXPECTED THEM TO FIND MORE THAN THEY HAVE [SIGH] I CERTAINLY FEEL SOMEWHAT THAT THERE ARE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION IN THAT AREA  (fe_03_00580-B-0010)
I DON'T THINK WE'LL EVER FIND THEM THERE'S TOO MANY PLACES THAT THEY COULD BE HIDDEN IN THE SAND IN  (fe_03_00580-B-0011)
IN MOST ANY PLACE IN THAT TYPE OF COUNTRY THAT WE REALLY AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW UM [SIGH] SADDAM ACTUALLY THINKS  (fe_03_00580-B-0012)
[LAUGHTER] I AGREE I I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT UM WE [SIGH] ARE JUST SEEM TO BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO START TO START ANOTHER WAR THERE AND UM WE ALREADY HAVE OTHER PLACES THAT ARE [LAUGHTER] ARE ALREADY UM  (fe_03_00580-B-0013)
IN NEED AND  (fe_03_00580-B-0014)
[SIGH] I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO LET THE INSPECTORS SEE WHAT ELSE THEY CAN COME UP WITH AND AND GIVE THEM SOME TIME WE HAVEN'T GIVEN THEM MUCH TIME  (fe_03_00580-B-0015)
[SIGH] YES AND I I THINK SINCE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN THERE FOR SO LONG THEY'RE ALMOST STARTING OVER FROM DAY ONE [SIGH] AND THEY HAVE TO START AT THE BEGINNING AND THEY HAVE TO GO LIKE YOU SAID FROM PLACE TO PLACE TO PLACE AND  (fe_03_00580-B-0016)
[SIGH] THAT'S GOING TO TAKE THEM MORE THAN THIRTY SIXTY DAYS I THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE THEM A FEW MONTHS AND I I REALLY THINK WE NEED TO GIVE THEM [SIGH] A LOT OF RESPECT FOR EVEN GOING BACK OVER THERE  (fe_03_00580-B-0017)
[SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT WAY [LAUGHTER] AND UM [LAUGHTER] I I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS HIS JOB TO DO UM  (fe_03_00580-B-0018)
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT  (fe_03_00580-B-0019)
IRAQ  (fe_03_00580-B-0020)
WOULD ACTUALLY STRIKE US FIRST I THINK IF THEY WENT AFTER ANYBODY IT WOULD BE IN THEIR AREA BUT AGAIN [SIGH] I AM CONCERNED MOSTLY BECAUSE OF HOW WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THINGS OVER THERE THAT [SIGH] UM HE WOULD  (fe_03_00580-B-0021)
PUT THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN BEHIND HIS I THINK THEY'RE CALLED PALACE GUARDS OR I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY THEIR TITLE [SIGH] BUT I FEEL LIKE UM  (fe_03_00580-B-0022)
[MN] IF WE DID HAVE THE WAR  (fe_03_00580-B-0023)
AND TRIED TO DISARM HIM THAT WAY THAT SO MANY INNOCENT PEOPLE WOULD BE BE KILLED EVEN THOUGH THAT IS HIS WAY AND THEN COMING BACK AND SAYING WELL LOOK WHAT YOU DID AND WHO YOU KILLED  (fe_03_00580-B-0024)
AND THAT- THAT'S THE TOUGH PART BECAUSE THEN WE WE GET THE BLAME IN GOING BACK OVER THERE AGAIN  (fe_03_00580-B-0025)
[SIGH] I JUST DON'T KNOW I I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE ANSWERS [SIGH] FROM UM OUR GOVERNMENT  (fe_03_00580-B-0026)
TO REALLY [SIGH] S- SEE BOTH SIDES UM WE'RE JUST KIND OF LOOKING AT OUR SIDE AND WE KIND OF HAVE TO TAKE WHAT IS IS IS SAID [SIGH] THAT COMES OUT OF IRAQ UM THROUGH OTHER NEWS MEDIA [SIGH] UM  (fe_03_00580-B-0027)
[MN] WITH KIND OF A GRAIN OF SALT 'CAUSE WE JUST DON'T KNOW W- WE WE AREN'T THERE AND  (fe_03_00580-B-0028)
WE HAVEN'T BEEN THERE AND I'M I'M ALS- ALSO WONDERING IF SOME ONE OF THE REASONS TOO THAT WE MIGHT NOT WANT THAT DISARM THEM BE THAT BE THAT THERE IS SOMETHING THERE TO DISARM [SIGH] IS TO GET A HOLD OF IRAQ'S OIL AND THEREFORE [SIGH]  (fe_03_00580-B-0030)
ACTUALLY NOT DO JUST THE DISARMING BUT ACTUALLY TAKE OVER THE COUNTRY FOR THE OIL [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_00580-B-0031)
I I FEEL THE SAME WAY AND I MY OTHER CONCERN IS THAT [SIGH] WE SEEM TO ALWAYS REBUILD THESE COUNTRIES AFTER WE DEVASTATE THEN  (fe_03_00580-B-0032)
AND THAT JUST SEEMS TO TAKE FROM OUR OWN ECONOMY AND [SIGH] IF WE'RE GOING TO GO OVER THERE AND DO SOMETHING I THINK WE NEED OTHER PLANS UM  (fe_03_00580-B-0033)
[LIPSMACK] IN PLACE  (fe_03_00580-B-0034)
[SIGH] FOR THIS REBUILDING AND THEN IT SHOULD NOT ALWAYS FALL BACK ON US [SIGH] AND AS FAR AS AFGHANISTAN GOES YES I THINK OUR TROOPS UH [SIGH] OVER THERE SEEM TO NEED MORE SUPPORT THAN WHAT WE'RE GIVING THEM AND I ALSO WORRY THAT [SIGH]  (fe_03_00580-B-0035)
GOING TO A WAR WITH IRAQ WOULD SPREAD OUR MILITARY AWFULLY THIN [SIGH] AS FAR AS ACTUAL MILITARY UM MILITARY TO PROTECT OUR OWN COUNTRY  (fe_03_00580-B-0036)
[LIPSMACK] YEAH I AGREE AND I THINK THAT UM [SIGH]  (fe_03_00580-B-0037)
WITH THE WITH ALL THE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD [SIGH] THAT UM  (fe_03_00580-B-0038)
WE CAN'T SOLVE THEM ALL [SIGH] AND IT SEEMS LIKE THAT IS THE ONLY PLACE THAT UM [SIGH] [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_00580-B-0039)
OUR PRESIDENT SEEMS TO WANT TO GO TO DO DISARMING [SIGH]  (fe_03_00580-B-0040)
SINCE HE'S TAKING CARE OF WHAT HE FEELS IN AFGHANISTAN AND I JUST DON'T KNOW [SIGH] WHERE HIS PRIORITIES ARE IN THAT RESPECT AND THAT THAT CONCERNS ME AS [SIGH] HIS REASONING AND IS IT JUST THE [MN]  (fe_03_00580-B-0041)
THE DISARMAMENT [SIGH] UM WHAT ARE HIS PLANS IF HE GOES IN [SIGH] HE'S JUST NOT GIVING US A LOT TO GO ON [SIGH] TO [SIGH] DO THE UM TO ACTUALLY AGREE WITH THE GOVERNMENT  (fe_03_00580-B-0042)
[SIGH] UH I DON'T KNOW AND I AND WE FOUGHT SUCH A BIG WAR IN NORTH KOREA AND THERE WE OR SOUTH KOREA TO TO HELP [SIGH] UM THEM AGAINST THE COMMUNIST REGIME IN NORTH KOREA SO [SIGH] WHAT ARE WE GOING TO FIND UM  (fe_03_00580-B-0043)
WITH IRAQ IF WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW NORTH KOREA TO HAVE  (fe_03_00580-B-0044)
[SIGH] WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION [SIGH] UM WHY IS IT WRONG FOR IRAQ THAT I I JUST UM [SIGH] I I SEEM SOME WISDOM IN WHY IT COULD BE WRONG  (fe_03_00580-B-0045)
BUT UM YEAH YOU IF YOU WEIGH BOTH HANDS IT YOU KNOW IT REALLY WOULD BALANCE OUT TO SAY IT'S OKAY FOR SOME AND NOT OKAY FOR OTHERS  (fe_03_00580-B-0046)
YES I I DEFINITELY AGREE WITH YOU [SIGH] BECAUSE UM IF IRAQ DOES HAVE THESE  (fe_03_00580-B-0047)
THEY SHOULD YOU KNOW AND WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW NORTH KOREA AND WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW CHINA OR WHOEVER [SIGH] TO HAVE THESE TYPE OF  (fe_03_00580-B-0048)
