R:  Hello, I'm Michelle.
L:  Hello, I'm Terri-Lyn[?].
R:  [SIGH] Um, how're you doing?
L:  I'm good, how are you?
R:  All right.  This is, um, I think gossiping is the worst.
L:  [SIGH] [MN] Mm, [SIGH] I think it would be a toss up between gossiping and smoking.
R:  Okay, well, I smoke, so  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'd have to [SIGH] go [MN] on that one.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  So 
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] no, and I'm allergic to cigarette smoke, so  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay, so that's understandable.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  And, um --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- overeating [SIGH] I tend to do when I get depressed.
L:  Me too.
R:  So, [LAUGH] but where are you from [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- anyway?
L:  I'm in Minnesota.
R:  I'm in Texas.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, wow.
R:  This is so cool.  How did you find this, on line?
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  Same here.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know how this is supposed to work, I mean --
L:  Well, I guess we're supposed to talk about the -- the topics [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] You know, so [SIGH] -- so, I -- I know that, [PAUSE] [MN] you know, we talk about you know, which ones are worse. [SIGH] 
R:  Okay.
L:  Hm.
R:  Alcohol, I used to drink a long time ago, but since I have a child now that's two years old I haven't drank since [SIGH] I got pregnant with her, so 
L:  [SIGH] That's good.  Yeah, actually alcohol would have been my next choice [SIGH] as I have a child with fetal alcohol syndrome and I see the dangers.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I haven't drank since [SIGH] -- since I was pregnant with her.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] And she's --
R:  I mean, I was --
L:  -- thirteen now.
R:  -- just a st- yeah, I was just a social drinker, you know, before, but -- and it wasn't like, you know, I'd have it around the house, but if I was around, you know, other people, I'd drink.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But now, it's like, nah, don't even faze me.
L:  [MN] 
R:  Ah, exercise, I'm, uh, that'd be way on the bottom of my list.  Huh.
L:  Yeah, and I'm in a wheelchair, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I can exercise my fingers. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, well I have no excuse, I just [SIGH] don't do it.  She gives me enough exercise [LAUGH] --
L:  [SIGH] Well --
R:  -- running around with her [SIGH] so -- because she's --
L:  Yeah, I think chasing a two year old is exercise.
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And then, what was the other one?
L:  Gossip.
R:  Gossip, oh, yeah, especially [SIGH] if you know it's not true and you're just doing it maliciously, you know?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  It's just -- and you can ruin a person's life.
L:  [SIGH] I can see that, I can see your point [MN] oh, and [SIGH] gossip can hurt even if you know it's true.
R:  Yeah, true.
L:  Even if it's true. [SIGH]  You know, if someone puts, um  tells you something in confidence and you [SIGH] tell other people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's real painful. [MN] 
R:  Yes, it is.  So, I've -- I mean, I hate to say this, I've found I've made more friends on line, and they've kept my secrets, you know, as far as I know --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- than here around -- yeah -- my neighbourhood, you know, the people I know here, so there's no one I really can +confide in, so 
L:  Yeah, I don't really try.  You know, you try once or twice and people don't keep your confidences so -- so I stopped trying. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, end up having surface friendships. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah, or people you thought were your friends --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, you know, come to find out they're the ones backstabbing you and talking about you.
L:  I think it's the most widespread problem.
R:  Yeah, I agree.
L:  'Cause it crosses every [SIGH] race and gender and, um, financial group.  You know, it doesn't matter how rich you are or -- [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- anything else.
R:  Or how poor or whatever or what color --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and [SIGH] it doesn't m- m- matter if you're male or female, it crosses both genders --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so even though females tend to gossip more than men, but that's just my --
L:  Not around here.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [SIGH] Yeah. [SIGH] men are real chatterboxes around here. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] That's very un- unusual, I mean -- or maybe it's not, I just -- I'm just n- not around a lot of men, like, since -- since I've had her.  I'm a single mom, and men are kinda like [MN] well, my shit left, so, anyway.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] That should tell you enough.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Well, I've been a single mom for fourteen -- four- almost fourteen years, so [SIGH] --
R:  How do you do it?
L:  -- you kind of get over it. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] How do you do it?  I mean --
L:  I don't -- I -- my daughter [SIGH] i- um, she is -- she's high needs.  She's been sick her whole life --
R:  Oh, bless your heart.
L:  -- and I spend most of my life in my apartment with her [SIGH] and, um -- so there are so many times where I'm the hot item of gossip, you know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- because [SIGH] how does anyone know that a child -- a parent of a child with fetal alcohol syndrome isn't still drinking, and how can you trust this person and --
R:  Yeah, I understand, yeah, understand. [SIGH] 
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] I've got a site for you [SIGH] if you want it, that if you want to, you know, just have someone to make a lot of good friends, a lot of people just to listen to you and i- if you like keeping a diary, and it's a free place, and it's called free open diary dot com.  I've made wonderful friends all around the United States --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and, uh, believe it or not, I had a cyber baby shower.
L:  Oh, how neat.
R:  And I got stuff -- I mean -- and it wasn't for them to send me stuff, you know, it wasn't even that. 
L:  Just making friends.
R:  Yeah, I made friends and I -- I mean -- [SIGH] I have [COUGH] I have -- both my parents have gone, so [SIGH] I have one lady, she's like a mom to me and I got --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- like ten thousand sisters, [LAUGH] you know, that are -- even -- not even blood.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  But if you want, you know, a good place to go and just, uh -- you can go under an anonymous name --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- and just, uh, to pour out your heart when you have nobody else to talk to, th- that's the place to go.
L:  That is really neat, that [SIGH] sounds like a place I'll visit.
R:  So  but, uh, I enjoyed this conversation.
L:  Yeah, I have too --
R:  So 
L:  It's kinda neat, we're -- we're on the total opposite poles of this country. [SIGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And, I don't know how you believe about prayer, but I'll keep you in my prayers.
L:  I believe very strongly in prayer. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  I believe it's how I've survived. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, and another place you might like to go is, um, it's a place called modest needs dot org. [SIGH] 
L:  What is it?
R:  Modest -- modest -- M.O.D.E.S.T. needs dot org. [SIGH] It's a place where people, [SIGH] um -- like if you need assistance in different stuff, you know, financially --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and then they have a -- a Yahoo group where these women are phenomenal.
L:  Hm. [SIGH] 
R:  And the same thing, a lot of Christian women in there.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I mean just [SIGH] wonderful place.
L:  [SIGH] Well, that- that's really exciting, thank you. [SIGH] 
R:  So.
L:  Thank you very much.
R:  You're welcome.
L:  [SIGH] Do you know about how long we're supposed to have of -- the phone conversation, or ?
R:  Mm mm.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  I have no idea.
L:  Yeah, I know they're recording us. [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't care.
L:  [LAUGH]  I don't either. [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, [LAUGH] you know, but --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- but, um, I guess it's for a study.
L:  Yeah, it is.  They coll- they'll collect information on how people -- how strangers, um --
R:  Connect.
L:  -- connect, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Which is kinda neat.
R:  Yep.  So --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  I don't kn- I don't know if it's going to be a one time thing or a couple of times or  [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, I read the email and it said there would be three -- three phone calls.
R:  Yeah, I couldn't find my pin number [SIGH] --
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and so I had to run to my computer --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- find my email, tripped over toys, --
L:  Oh. [SIGH] 
R:  -- ran back [LAUGH] and put it in, and [SIGH] -- and I thought, "Oh, did it hang up?"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And then they had to find somebody that connected for the study --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I went on their -- on hold too long, maybe about three minutes, so that wasn't too bad.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  Good.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  If, um, [LIPSMACK] you like, um, like I said -- and hopefully we'll get connected again --
L:  Yeah, that would be really nice. [SIGH] 
R:  So.
L:  If you're ever on i- on that free open diary site and you see somebody called Tavita Joy, that's me.
R:  Okay, I'll look for you.
L:  Okay.  
R:  All right, then, well, b-
L:  That's -- that's usually my sign in name.
R:  Okay, Tavita Joy.  All right, I'll look for that.
L:  That's great.
R:  And you, God bless.
L:  Thanks, you too.
R:  All right.
L:  All right.
R:  Bye bye.
L:  Bye bye.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE]
