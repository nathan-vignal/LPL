R:  Maria --
L:  Hi, there, I'm Ian Hathler[?]
R:  Maria MacRae[?]
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  Good.  What, uh, reality shows do you watch?
R:  Uh, Joe Millionaire, American Idol.
L:  Oh, yeah? [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I like that Joe Millionaire, and, uh, Man versus Beasts.
R:  What's that?
L:  The Man versus Beasts thing?
R:  Yep, that thing was stupid, dude.
L:  I don't know, I kinda liked it.
R:  I didn't like it at all, I thought it was --
L:  It was -- [NOISE]
R:  -- um, like really --
L:  It was -- 
R:  -- dumb.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  Yes.
L:  What -- what other shows?
R:  [SIGH] Um, I watched Survivor the first season.  I didn't like any of the other seasons.  I tried to watch --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the Africa one, but I just couldn't get into it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, it got boring, I think.
R:  I think so too, 'cause after the --
L:  They kept doing --
R:  -- first one it's just not as good, like, on any of them.  That's why I'm so nervous about American Idol being not good.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH]  I've seen a couple of American Idol shows.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah. [LIPSMACK] 
L:  It's good.
R:  I like it.
L:  I kinda like Real World.
R:  The Real World? 
L:  That's [MN] -- 
R:  The Real World and Road Rules are cool, I've watched them for a long time.
L:  Not this, uh -- not th- this one so much, but some of the past ones have been really good.
R:  Yeah, the Las Vegas One? [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's kinda cool, 'cause that's where I'm from, so ...
L:  [NOISE] Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, that's where I live, so, it's cool.
L:  Why do you think people watch them?
R:  [SIGH] Um, I don't know.  Because they like the drama, I think.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Yeah, and the ones --
L:  But --
R:  -- you can vote on, they like to be a part of it, like, they feel like they doing something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Yep.
L:  They're more exciting than their own life, and they can, like, relate to these people, I think.
R:  Yeah, probably. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or they just see, "Well --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I wouldn't do that if I was in that situation" or --"
L:  Right.
R:  -- something like that. [SIGH] 
L:  It's interesting how you, like, do stuff that, like, I wouldn't do, like, if your parents are watching and, like, friends are watching, you know?
R:  Oh, I know, like the Meet the --
L:  Like --
R:  -- Parents show, I'm just like, "Oh --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- no". [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, like, some of the real old [inaudible], they just, like, sleep around and stuff and --
R:  [SIGH] I know, that's just crazy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] But people like to watch that stuff, it's kind like a soap opera, but it's like [MN] something more they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- relate to 'cause it's actually happening, it's not fictional.
L:  [NOISE] That's only on, like, once a week, so, like, you get excited about it and stuff.
R:  Yeah, it's like, something --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you look forward to.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Yep, but I like them, they're cool.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] Yeah, I don't know.  I like -- I like Fear Factor too.
R:  Yeah, we watch Fear Factor a lot.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] A good show, I think.
R:  [NOISE] Yep. [SIGH] I could never be on that show --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- though.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Never.
L:  N- no?
R:  Hell, no.
L:  No, I like the one -- the celebrity one.
R:  The celebrity --
L:  They had, like --
R:  -- one?
L:  -- Penn and Teller -- they, like, Penn and Teller, and they had, um, the guy from the Brady Bunch?
R:  Yeah, I liked the --
L:  I think Greg it was.
R:  -- Penn and Teller one.
L:  Yeah.  Um, I don't know.
R:  They're cool, I like them, they're something different.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  It's real, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's good.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I don't know.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Mm.  You watch a lot of 'em, or just ...?
R:  Um, most of 'em.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I'm trying to -- it's -- it's tough to fit in, you know?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I got to pick one, usually, because sometimes they're on on the same night.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, it's like [NOISE] -- now there's, like, one every night on, you know?
R:  [SIGH] Almost.
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] it's crazy. [PAUSE]
R:  [NOISE] Almost. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But -- which one's your favorite?
L:  Um, I like th- th- the Battle of the Sexes, like, uh, when they do, like challenges for the Real World and Road Rules and stuff.
R:  Yeah, the Real World and Road Rules. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's cool.
L:  'Cause -- like, you haven't seen some of the characters and [MN] like, the one at -- the recent one where, like, they get into fight and stuff.
R:  Yeah, I missed that one, I seen the one --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- where Parker almost got thrown off the show, though.
L:  Yeah, that was -- that was the one I've seen, that was pretty good.
R:  Yeah, there's another one, I guess. [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And I seen one where, like, he's gonna get married there or something.
L:  Oh, who's that?  Who's gonna get married?  Puck?
R:  Puck, yeah.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Wow.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I don't know, it's crazy.  Which one's your favorite?
R:  Um, probably right now, Joe Millionaire.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I heard that he's, like, really a millionaire, though.
R:  [SIGH] Really?
L:  It's a big -- yeah, it's a big prank, just to get people to watch. [SIGH] 
R:  [NOISE] I don't know, but --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- I know if he's driving a bat car or whatever the hell, even a construction worker makes more than nineteen thousand dollars a year.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  Always, I mean, unless you only work, like, once --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a week. [SIGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  He probably owns --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that company.
L:  Like, they won't be so poor any more, I don't think. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  I kinda like those girls getting all those diamonds and [NOISE] necklaces [NOISE] and stuff.
R:  You do --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- or you don't like it?
L:  [NOISE] It's good, I mean [NOISE] like, it's weird how, like the girls get all these [NOISE] necklaces [NOISE] because they don't really care at the end if ... [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, there was only --
L:  Maybe. 
R:  -- one girl on it I like now. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah? [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which one do you think's gonna win?
R:  I don't know, probably that one with the short curly hair, the little brunette girl.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  The one it looks --
L:  What's her name?
R:  -- like he sleeps with.
L:  Oh, I don't know.  Isn't it Mojo?  What's her name?
R:  Melissa M, I think, or something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like that.
L:  Yeah, I think [SIGH] he'll pick her, I think. [NOISE] [SIGH] Other one is -- I don't know. [NOISE] 
R:  So, I'll have to wait and see.  There's only four left, so it can't be much longer.
L:  Yeah.  The -- yeah, it'll be soon. [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] [SIGH] Oh, reality TV.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  It's nuts.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah, are we supposed to keep talking, or ...?
R:  What?
L:  Are we -- do they tell us when we're done, or --
R:  I don't know, that's what I was just gonna ask --
L:  I'd already done this --
R:  -- you.
L:  What?
R:  I don't know, I don't when we're done.
L:  [NOISE] All right, oh. [NOISE] 
R:  Mm. [SIGH] [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm. [NOISE] 
R:  Hm.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I don't know, it didn't say on the instructions.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Are they -- [LAUGH] [inaudible] like that? 
R:  I know. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So, where -- where are you from?
L:  Huh? [SIGH] Las --
R:  Where are you from?
L:  -- Vegas.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, you watch the Real World, huh?

R:  No, I've never just, like, passed any of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- them on the street or anything.
L:  Oh. [NOISE] I see.
R:  [NOISE]
