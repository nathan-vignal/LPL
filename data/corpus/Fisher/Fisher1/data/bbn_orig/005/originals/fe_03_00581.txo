R:  Bill.
L:  I'm Jo- [LAUGH] I'm Joanna Smith.
R:  Fergus Fitzwilliam[?].  Where are you from?
L:  I'm from Hazer[?], West Georgia.
R:  Well, I, uh, used to live in, uh Covington.
L:  Um, wh- where are you from now?
R:  [SIGH] Living in Southwest Virginia --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- outside of Pennington, or Pennington Gap, I should say.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  I think they should bomb Iraq. [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Well, I think they need to be careful that -- yeah, I think that we need to [SIGH] --
L:  We ought to do something [MN] about it.
R:  [LIPSMACK] De-
L:  We should have done --
R:  -- definitely.
L:  -- something about it.
R:  I think we definitely need to do something to [SIGH] send a message to Saddam Hussein, either, you know, put him into line, or take him out, one or the other, yes.  And in a short order.
L:  That's exactly right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] You know, I think we -- we should --
L:  If they'd done a while back it s- this wouldn't have happened.
R:  Pardon?
L:  If they had done something before --
R:  [SIGH] Before, yes --
L:  -- you know, a while back --
R:  -- when they were in -- when they were in there before, if they had have made sure they got him, right, we wouldn't be where we are today. [SIGH] 
L:  That's correct. [SIGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] No.
L:  Have you participated in this type of study before?
R:  No, actually, this is my very first call.
L:  Mine, too.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I got one the other day and I didn't take it. [LAUGH] But I -- I said I'd take this one tonight.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, yeah, figured it would be worth checking into. [SIGH] 
L:  It might be.
R:  Yes. [SIGH] Um --
L:  My daughter lives in her, um, Western Virginia, [LIPSMACK] just outside of Washington.
R:  Mm, [LIPSMACK] I've heard of it, I'm not sure, we've only lived around here a couple of years so I'm not real sure, [SIGH] um --
L:  It's near Herring[?], Virginia.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yes, uh, that sounds familiar. [SIGH] See, I know, [SIGH] um, they've -- they've called up some of the national guards around here getting ready to send them over there, you know, it [SIGH] it definitely looks like it's coming. [SIGH] 
L:  That's right. [SIGH] They've called up the people from Fort Stewart and [SIGH] several other bases around down here. [LIPSMACK] They've already gone, too.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, man, [SIGH] because I think, um, my youngest son's, um, his girlfriend's uncle, um, I believe they go -- when do they go, next week? [NOISE] Yeah, they -- they go out next week.
L:  Oh, I just hope they don't have the draft.  I don't know if they'll do it or not.
R:  [SIGH] I know, I -- I, you know, [SIGH] if -- if we're going in, um, we really do need to be prepared for some long term engagement and I don't think, [SIGH] um, you know, I don't really think it's going to be something they can do real fast.  I think, compared -- compared to wars in the past, I think it could be, you know, done rather rapidly, but it still -- it's going to take some time. [SIGH] 
L:  And a lot of troops.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yes, yes.
L:  From different countries, too.
R:  [SIGH] That -- it -- the worst thing too is, you know, at some point, you know, how far are we going to push him before, like, he -- he did before, he -- he goes to blowing up the oil wells, going to, you know, blowing up factories, or whatever, [SIGH] because, I mean, he is -- [SIGH] he is the type of leader to go to that extent, he -- he's proven that.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And he's not concerned with himself or his people.
R:  [SIGH] No, no, he's -- he -- you correct --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- he -- he shows very little concern for his own people, [SIGH] um, it -- it -- that's, you know, also shown partially [SIGH] when, uh, I know -- when -- during Desert Storm, they talked about how he controlled everything right down to the TV, so [SIGH] I mean, he's on there every day saying, "Oh, we're doin' good, we're doin' good" and [SIGH] we're just blowing the heck out of him. [SIGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] That's right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I mean, I don't think he has his own people's support as much as he did either, [SIGH] um, there's -- I -- I've been [SIGH] looking here a little bit lately, I've had a little time, I've, uh, recently I've -- I've returned to school this fall, I'm attending college, so I don't [SIGH] -- don't have a lot of TV time, but [SIGH] I -- I've noticed here lately they've been talking a little bit about that, [SIGH] which I know, you know, in our -- our news media -- it can be manipulated as well, but [SIGH] you know, they're saying how, you know, he doesn't have [SIGH] his own people's support like he did before.  There are more of -- of his own people asking [SIGH] more and better questions.
L:  [LIPSMACK] That's right. [SIGH] How old are you?
R:  [SIGH] I just turned forty this last December. [SIGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, that's still young. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] oh, yeah. [SIGH] [MN] Everybody teases me, but it's, you know, they -- it ain't nothing but a thing, there's another day. [SIGH] I'm liking -- I'm still young, I'm still going.  I don't have -- I don't really have any complaints. [SIGH] 
L:  Well, are you going continue your education?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, for -- I'm -- I'm figuring for at least the next couple of years. [SIGH] But my wife and I've -- we've been together [SIGH] eighteen years now and we've got the two boys and they get out of highschool in a couple of years and [SIGH] well, one of them likes, you know, I mean, it's -- it's -- with stuff going on in Iraq and all this, it kind of gets real all close to home.  Our eldest boy, he's looking real strong going into the naval academy and, [SIGH] you know, there's -- there's something -- we're looking -- [SIGH] you know, he really wouldn't be s- I don't think seriously lookin' at any kind of combat for at least six years, but [SIGH] that- that's still, you know --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- with -- with the type of people in general we're dealing with, some of their -- their beliefs and [SIGH] how strongly their -- their convictions -- how strongly they believe in stuff, it [SIGH] -- I can see that six years down the road from now we're still fighting --
L:  [LIPSMACK] When we've --
R:  -- I, you know, I certainly hope not, they, uh -- [SIGH] I saw this morning a little bit that the US, they're [SIGH] at least, what they're saying that they are -- do have plans on trying to get in and getting troops stationed at oil wells and -- and such like this to help protect 'em, but, [SIGH] you know, it's -- he went in ahead of time there and planted his wells with -- I guess when he invaded Iran, one of the first things he did there was plant --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- dynamite at -- at the wells, [SIGH] so, you know, I don't know.
L:  Well, do you think that literature that they're dropping will do any good?
R:  [SIGH] I think, uh, it's -- it's really hard to say, it's, you know -- it -- it may -- if -- if it even, you know, know brings a couple of questions into a few -- a few minds, then, you know, it- it's worth it, it -- it is [SIGH] -- it's another step before we go in and start shooting, so --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- yeah, [SIGH] you know, I can -- I can -- you can hope that it does some good, and -- and looks -- you know, heck, even if it only does reach one, well, that's, you know, something.  [SIGH] Can I get right back to you real quick?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'll be right back. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] [COUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] I'm back.
L:  All right. [SIGH] 
R:  But, [SIGH] yeah, I just -- I barely caught something about that again this morning.
L:  Oh.  I think they're [MN] dropping leaflets that tell 'em to listen to different radio at different times, you know, they'll be broadcasting.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I -- [LIPSMACK] you know, and it -- you know, it's really scary, I think, you know, in this war and they're putting all [SIGH] Americans kind of -- the, um, American government has issued a warning, you know, to get everything in order, you know, and no matter where you are to -- if you're an American out of the country to -- to be ready to [SIGH] jump on a plane and come home --
L:  That's right.  
R:  -- so --
L:  We have a -- a daughter and son in law in, um, [LIPSMACK] let me see, I forgot, [LIPSMACK] Saudi -- Saudi Arabia.
R:  Oh, boy.  Yeah, [SIGH] I wouldn't want to be there. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] I wouldn't either, but they -- they're there.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] Hopefully they'll be --
L:  And [MN] they're not very scared.
R:  [SIGH] Pardon?
L:  They're not scared of it.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, [SIGH] yeah, you know, it's -- hopefully they're [SIGH] doing what they should be doing. [LIPSMACK] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  You know, I'm kind of [SIGH] a pretty firm believer in -- in -- in God's will and everything, you know, things -- things happen and [SIGH] there -- there are some things that you can control in some ways and some things you can't, so, [SIGH] you know, hopefully they're [SIGH] doing what they feel they need to be doing and [LIPSMACK] -- and, you know, they'll be taken care of.  [SIGH] You know, I've -- I've had a brother, he was in the army and luckily he got out just before Desert Storm and [SIGH] hopefully, like I say to my boys, well, hopefully this'll be over before they get to that age, I have to worry about, but --
L:  Yes, my daughter got out right before Desert Storm.
R:  [SIGH] Well, I'll tell you, a lot of kids these days have a lot of fantasies about fighting and such, I mean, [SIGH] just look at our -- our cities, you know, got kids shooting kids and -- you know, all the time. [SIGH] But they've got a lot of fannies -- fantasies about it.  Hopefully they can -- you know, won't have to realise too much of the reality. [LIPSMACK] I think we got some -- [SIGH] some kids and some generations that th- this is going to be a real eye opening for, [LIPSMACK] but a lot of the younger people have it real easy these days, and [SIGH] --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, do you think the draft will be any good?
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] The people are getting --
R:  I feel, I don't know --
L:  -- angrier and [MN] --
R:  -- I'm just -- I've been --
