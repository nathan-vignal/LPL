L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, I'm Summer.
L:  [LAUGH] Hi, I'm Christina.  I'm sorry, your name?
R:  Summer.
L:  Summer.  [SIGH] Um [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- all right, good to talk to talk to you.  This is -- I haven't done this yet. [SIGH] 
R:  Neither have I.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, good.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Okay, what's your favorite holiday? [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Ah, Valentine's Day.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, really?
R:  Yes.
L:  Why?
R:  Huh?
L:  Why?
R:  Why?  I'm a big romantic.
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Well, [MN] good, it's just -- it's coming around the corner. [SIGH] Um, [LIPSMACK] I think mine is probably -- I don't know, I kind of like Thanksgiving --
R:  Thanks-
L:  -- [SIGH] because it doesn't have any, [SIGH] um, [LAUGH] stuff associated with it except for just eating. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Ah, that's why I don't like Thanksgiving. [SIGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Really?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I get too fat around Thanksgiving and Christmas.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, that's true actually, it does.  Um, [SIGH] so, that's a -- that's the down point, I suppose.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah. [SIGH] 
L:  So, um, [SIGH] let's see [SIGH] --
R:  The create a holiday thing?
L:  The create a holiday thing. [LAUGH] [SIGH] What holiday would you create?
R:  Leave mom alone weekend.
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] I think that's a good idea.  I'm actu- I'm not a mom, so, [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] I don't think I would create that one.  I don't what I would do, actually.  I, um -- you know, I feel like we have plenty of holidays. [SIGH] Oh, I know, they have a holiday in, um, [LIPSMACK] Europe, well, or in -- in Italy and some other countries which is, like, International Woman's Day, and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they just, you know, celebrate women, and that's --
R:  [SIGH] Oh --
L:  -- it, and --
R:  -- I used to live in Germany, and I've never heard of that.
L:  Oh, really?  Well, maybe --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- they don't have it in Germany, [LAUGH] but, um, [LIPSMACK] but they definitely have it in Italy, and the tradition is that they -- [SIGH] they get, um, a particular kind of flower, it's like this little yellow flower that looks like goldenrod, or something.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that grows, you know, around -- it's in March, I think, and it grows around that time [SIGH] of year, [SIGH] and, um, and they sell the stuff in all the little florist shops, and it's no big deal, but you're supposed to give all the women you know a little bouquet.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Maybe something like that here. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, exactly, that's the holiday that I would create, or, I mean, I wouldn't create it, but I would at least transfer --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] So, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] what do you usually do for Valentine's Day --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- since it's your favorite?  Do you have a tradition?
R:  [SIGH] Ah, I don't have any traditions, because this is my first Valentine's Day with my fiance.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] I'm hoping to give him a positive pregnancy test. [SIGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] That would be cool. [LAUGH] 
R:  But other than that, I just try to be as sweet as I can.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] I, um, I used to be married and my ex husband and I went -- before we got married actually started a small Valentine's tradition --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] um, we --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- just got lobsters.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  We went to the little seafood market and got lobsters and, um, after, you know, letting the cat play around with them on the floor for a while --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- we, um, cooked them. [LAUGH] No --
R:  You let your cat play with lobsters?
L:  Well, you know, there claws were sort of rubber banded up.
R:  I think my cats would flip out if they saw a lobster on the floor.
L:  Oh, yeah, I know. [LAUGH] No, no, no, I've always had -- always had really, [SIGH] you know, hop[?] kind of cats, [SIGH] but that was it as far as --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- as far as -- as far as tradition went, and I don't know what [SIGH] I'm going to do this year.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] This year I'm just praying that my poor fiance is not in Iraq. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Oh, is he in the military?
R:  Yes, he's military. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, I was going to ask you, is that why you were in Germany?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  I met him there. [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes. [NOISE] 
L:  Wow. [SIGH] 
R:  [NOISE] It's beautiful.
L:  Were you living there?
R:  I was living there, yes.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And he was in the military there.
L:  I see.
R:  Germany's beautiful, especially Kaiserslautern --
L:  Really?
R:  -- and they got some really wacky holidays there, like, um, they don't celebrate Halloween, they celebrate Fasching, which is kind of like Mardi Gras --
L:  Really?
R:  -- where they just have these wild and crazy parties where the -- everybody dresses up in wild costumes, [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] what's another holiday they --
L:  And what time of year is that?
R:  That's, like, this time of year right now, February. [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, wow.
R:  And then they have, oh, what's another one?  Well, it's not really a holiday, but they do it, like, two or three times a year --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's like a Junkin[?], I think they call it, [SIGH] because they have to pay taxes on their stuff that they own in their houses, like, right down to their TV and VCR and, ah, coffee pots.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, they put whatever they don't want out on the street --
L:  Oh, really --
R:  -- and people just drive aro-
L:  -- to avoid that. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, and people drive around and [SIGH] pick up whatever they want.
L:  [SIGH] Do they do that -- now, do the people who pick it up have to pay the taxes on it?
R:  [SIGH] No.  
L:  Oh, that's good. [LAUGH] 
R:  It's old, 'cause when you buy stuff there's a value added tax, it's --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- like fifteen percent on everything.
L:  Exactly, I know --
R:  [SIGH] Yes.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] it's terrible. [SIGH] 
R:  Yes, I know.
L:  Um, yeah, [SIGH] I think that, you know, there are definitely holidays that they have in other countries that they celebrate more, like, even Carnival, [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, yes, that's my goal --
L:  -- um, you know, that would --
R:  -- for my honeymoon.
L:  -- that would be a good holiday thing to import, and we only really have it here down in New Orleans.
R:  [SIGH] Well, no, in Savannah, Georgia, they have a Saint Patrick's day holiday that they basically shut the whole town down, [SIGH] and all down town you can't drive through it.  They have a --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- they have a huge parade.  'Cause that --that's where I'm from, Savannah, Georgia.
L:  [SIGH] Really?
R:  [SIGH] And -- yeah, they close the schools down, they have a huge parade, it's a four day weekend, [SIGH] and it's just a drunk fest that whole entire weekend.
L:  For Saint Patrick's Day?
R:  For Saint Patrick's Day.
L:  Are there [MN] -- are there a lot of Irish down there?
R:  Ah, we're the second most populated city with Irish people.
L:  Oh, your kid- that's next to Boston?
R:  No, next to New York.
L:  Really?
R:  Really.
L:  Wow, I didn't know that about Savannah.
R:  Yes, it's just one huge party [SIGH] and nobody sleeps.
L:  [SIGH] That's funny. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, 'cause my mom owns a bar and I work for her and [NOISE] it's crazy. [NOISE] 
L:  Wow, um -- [LIPSMACK] well, what else, what other kinds of holidays can we talk about?
R:  [NOISE] Um.
L:  This is very -- this seems so weird [LAUGH] to be doing this.
R:  Well, I think some of the greeting card companies [NOISE] just make up holidays, like, secretary's day. [NOISE] 
L:  I think you're right.  Secretary's Day, Grandparent's Day, um, and --
R:  Swedish Day.
L:  -- it's -- it's -- Swedish Day.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] I, you know, I guess I like the idea of Swedish Day, but I would never buy a card for it.  I don't know -- and how would you even celebrate it?
R:  It's supposed -- it's just a greeting cards [NOISE] made come a holiday.
L:  [SIGH] Really?
R:  Yes. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  No, I, um, I don't -- I don't really buy into that.  In fact my --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- my family [SIGH] over the past --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- several years has -- thinks I'm -- I'm sort of the -- the black sheep --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- when it comes to holidays --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- because --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I never ever buy greeting cards [SIGH] and send them, except for, you know, Christmas cards that I send out to --
R:  [NOISE] I don't even do Christmas cards, I make 'em.
L:  -- a list of people.  Hm?
R:  [NOISE] I make --
L:  You --
R:  -- my own.
L:  You make your own?  I think --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- that's a great idea.  [SIGH] I'm -- or, you know, even if you do the ones with the little pictures on them or something, that's kind of personal and nice.
R:  What I do is I buy the scrapbooking materials and the little, ah, paper puncher things to [MN] give the fancy edges [SIGH] and I take family portraits and use those for the pictures.
L:  Oh, that's a great idea.  That's a -- really a good idea, and I -- I should probably try that.  I've know people who've painted their own and -- but these are people who are much more artistic than I am, so I have --
R:  I'm not artistic. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- to rely on what's commercially available. [LAUGH] 
R:  I can cut and glue.
L:  Cut and -- that's great, that's a good idea, I might -- I might have to steal it from you. [LAUGH] [SIGH] Um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but otherwise I don't -- I don't really buy in to the, you know, Hallmark cards, prefabbed poetry --
R:  No, those are just --
L:  -- kind of --
R:  -- pretty --
L:  -- culture.
R:  [MN].  Ah, what's another holiday?  Easter, I like Easter.
L:  Do you?
R:  Yes, 'cause that's the one time of year that they sell my candy in the egg containers, the chocolate covered marshmallows.
L:  OhXS.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] I like the little Cadbury chocolate eggs.
R:  [SIGH] Ooh, I don't like those, I think they're gross. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] They are kind of gross, but I like them anyway. [SIGH] Um, my mom -- [LAUGH] speaking of Easter, my mom always had -- her favorite, um, Easter candy was [SIGH] those little peeps.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know, the sugar coated marshmallow things.
R:  [LIPSMACK] We used to have marshmallow roast with those.
L:  Yeah, ooh, what happens to the sugar?
R:  [SIGH] It basically gets hard and burnt.
L:  [SIGH] That's great. [LAUGH] 
R:  They're good that way, they're not good plain.
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] I bet they would be a lot -- I think it would be an improvement. [SIGH] Um, yeah, my [MN] I don't know, that was -- that was always the classic -- the classic Easter holiday candy for us --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but I don't really -- I don't do Easter too much. [SIGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Mine was black jelly beans from my dad.
L:  Licorice?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh.
R:  Those are my favorite.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, wow.  No, see I'm not -- I'm -- I don't know, I'm not a big candy eater.
R:  [NOISE] I'm not a big candy eater, but this is certain holiday candies that I like. [LIPSMACK] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So, every year for Easter he sends me, like, a one pound of black jelly beans that'll last me all year.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, that's great.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  No, what about, um, what about Halloween?  I guess if you have kids you -- you, um --
R:  Oh, I go all out for Halloween. [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you, really?
R:  Yes, 'cause [SIGH] my daughter's four and she just now got into it.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah, this is the age where she's sort of approaching, you know, consciousness of holidays.
R:  Oh, she's very conscious of it.  
L:  And what --
R:  She's not even got the candy in her basket, and she's like, "All right, I want to go some place else".
L:  Really?
R:  And I'm like, "Okay".  She's like, "More candy".
L:  [LAUGH] Does she eat it?
R:  [SIGH] No. [SIGH] 
L:  No. [LAUGH] it's just -- it's j- you know, [SIGH] I think my -- 
R:  Well --
L:  -- I have some nephews who are like that, and they're about the same age, and I think that their goal really is to just [SIGH] amass candy [SIGH] and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not really eat it, just to sort of look at the bigness of the pile.
R:  Well, she doesn't eat it 'cause I don't let her have it.
L:  I see.
R:  [NOISE] I put it up and she gets it every now and then.
L:  Yeah, I think that's a good idea, so it probably lasts for a good long time.
R:  Yes, and now my brother, he won't eat candy at all.  He just likes getting the candy and filling up my mother's, [SIGH] uh, candy jar [NOISE] on her coffee table.
L:  [LAUGH] That's a good idea. [SIGH] Um --
R:  You see, he likes potato chips, so every year after Halloween my mum buys him one of those big boxes with all the different flavored potato chips in -- in the small bags.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] And trades him that.
L:  Oh that's a good idea.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] No, do you, um, if it -- so, your daughter dresses up for Halloween and do you do it too?
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Do you dress up, or do something?
R:  I did it when she was little.  
L:  Yes.
R:  She was a baby cow and I was a momma cow. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Oh, that's very cute. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] But, other than that, no.
L:  [LIPSMACK] 'Cause my sister, who has, uh -- I don't have any kids, but my sister has three little boys [SIGH] and she always dresses up and she's very creative and very artistic, so every Halloween she makes lasagna which is a traditional Halloween food at her house, don't ask me why. [SIGH] And, [LAUGH] um, [SIGH] and she --
