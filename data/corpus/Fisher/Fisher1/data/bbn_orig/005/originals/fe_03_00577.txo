R:  Hi.
L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Tina.
L:  Hi, I'm Johnny[?]. [NOISE] 
R:  Nice to meet --
L:  Pleased to meet you --
R:  Yeah, you too.
L:  -- sort of. [NOISE] I mean, not sort of pleased, but, you know --
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
L:  -- [NOISE] sort of meeting you. [NOISE] 
R:  Um, so we're supposed to be talking about --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- reality --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- television, then?
L:  [NOISE] Apparently. [NOISE] 
R:  Okay, that --
L:  [NOISE] But, uh, um, [NOISE] I would -- I would just say right off the bat that, um, [NOISE] it's a great mystery to me, [NOISE] and I feel uncomfortable about that.  It's, um, [NOISE] that I -- I can't see [NOISE] people always enti- entire sort of -- sort of -- [NOISE] social and political and cultural implications [NOISE] of something like that. [NOISE] That's just the way it is. [NOISE] I -- I mean it's just -- it's all very [NOISE] -- it just is a big mess for me. -- like --
R:  Is it reality television shows you mean?
L:  [NOISE] Well, just trying to figure out why people -- why, you know -- why --
R:  Yeah, expose themselves.
L:  -- [NOISE] they'd [inaudible] 
R:  Expose themselves?
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] Expose them- themselves on --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- national television.
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Sorry? [NOISE] 
R:  You mean, like, why people would want to [SIGH] bare themselves on national TV?
L:  Uh, not so much that, I mean I can --
R:  Their mind.
L:  -- I can [NOISE] sort of understand that a little bit [NOISE] it was more that it -- it's so, uh, [NOISE] you know, popular, like --
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  -- like big money now. [NOISE] 
R:  There's a couple of --
L:  People --
R:  -- programmes I like to watch, but I'm not --
L:  Which ones?
R:  Um, [SIGH] well, I watch, like Joe Millionaire and, um, it -- do -- the --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- other reality --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- based show I watch is that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, [SIGH] oh, I don't -- like, American Idol, if you can call that reality, [SIGH] but I don't -- I don't know too much about that, it's more of a --
L:  [NOISE] Star search, kind of?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, that kind of deal --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I watch --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that island -- what was it, Paradise --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- Island thing, or whatever, yeah and I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I thought --
L:  [NOISE] I think I saw that --
R:  -- it was pretty neat.  
L:  -- once or twice.
R:  Yeah, I thought that was pretty neat.
L:  That's the one with the couples, and they sort of --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- they -- they're couples --
R:  Right.
L:  -- before they come on and then they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they go out on these dates and then [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, no, the whole -- that show, in particular, I sort of -- I don't know, it's sort of it's like they're the sort of pure reality shows, I guess, which are, like, glimpses of these people in the fish bowl, chewed up, and --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and then there's the sort of reality dating shows that [NOISE] -- that one [NOISE] -- I don't know, I've -- [NOISE] maybe I've just been, um, [NOISE] -- just fascinated [NOISE] by all those dating shows, but, yeah, but [NOISE] those where you sort of, like, [NOISE] you're going on a date [NOISE] and you know that your significant other is going to be watching a video of it later, I mean, I -- I --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I know.
L:  Who -- I can, like, still cannot figure --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- out who in the hell would ever agree to that. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] I sure wouldn't, I know that.
L:  [NOISE] I don't know.  I mean, like you said, the -- I could do it, you know, but not with someone I was in love with, uh, that's just --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, because I -- I --
L:  [NOISE] Why not just say, "Yeah, I want the relationship to end right now". [NOISE] 
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Um, I don't care for like, the Survivor show --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I -- I just think that's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] pushing people way beyond limits --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that they need to even prove. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] I guess I have to say that -- [NOISE] I mean, I find it fascinating for the whole [NOISE] survival issue and then [NOISE] you know, um, I have to admit that, you know, part of it is that they usually have a couple of cute women in [NOISE] --
R:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah.
L:  -- [NOISE] scanty clothing, so [NOISE] --
R:  Well, sure, sure.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I don't know. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  My gosh.
L:  [NOISE] Did you ever -- [NOISE] I'm sorry?
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Go ahead.
L:  [NOISE] Did you ever watch Big Brother? [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I did. [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Boy that's [SIGH] been a while ago.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, I liked --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  -- that too. [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] That was pretty weird.  I guess the first time that I saw it was -- I was in, um, Germany [NOISE] and it was sort of -- [NOISE] for the, you know, when [NOISE] the first season came on and it was this big deal. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] And they wrote about it all the time and [NOISE] you know, and if -- [NOISE] and -- German TV, it's kind of funnier because, you know, [NOISE] you know, they have cameras in the showers and they don't censor anything and [NOISE] --
R:  [SIGH] Oh, really?
L:  -- [NOISE] you know, they were --
R:  Really?
L:  -- [NOISE] they were showing, um, [NOISE] you know, they'd -- they'd show couples having sex, you know, couples in the house --
R:  You're kidding?
L:  -- [NOISE] I mean, are they --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- being -- I think there was some couple where they -- they were just like, "Yeah, let it all hang out". [NOISE] But the first season, it was -- it was this couple and, you know, you just saw the sheets moving and you heard a lot of "Yeah --"
R:  Right --
L:  "-- yeah". 
R:  -- right. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] But, um, that was -- it was like a huge hit that -- that -- that first season. [NOISE] There was this one, uh, [NOISE] this one guy who became [NOISE] like a -- a national [NOISE] celebrity, like in [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, complete, I'm -- I'm not -- I'm trying to think of -- I want to say Truman Show, but it's not exactly like that [NOISE] but [NOISE] he became huge. [NOISE] It's -- it's -- it's really -- funny, he's like [NOISE] of Macedonian origin or something [MN] --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- [NOISE] his name was Slavko[?] [NOISE] --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- [NOISE] and he became famous in the first couple of weeks. [NOISE] They were having some conversation around the house where Shakespeare came up [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [NOISE] and he was like, "Who's Shakespeare?" [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] And an entire nation sort of, their jaw -- the collective jaw of the nation just --
R:  Yeah, no --
L:  -- dropped. [NOISE] 
R:  -- kidding, I'll bet, I'll bet, I imagine.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] And just --
R:  Oh, that's funny.
L:  -- from that one line, he became this huge celebrity, he just sort of -- [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- everyone just loved to watch it and just, like, see how dumb he was gonna prove to be that week and [SIGH] [NOISE] --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  -- [NOISE] and he wasn't like a retard, [MN] you know, [NOISE] he was just -- I mean I shouldn't [NOISE] --
R:  Just truly --
L:  -- [NOISE] I shouldn't put it --
R:  -- didn't know.
L:  -- that way, but you know. [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] What --
L:  [NOISE] He wasn't -- he -- he -- he wasn't [NOISE] -- he wasn't actually stupid, he was just kind of -- had a little bit of a [NOISE] what's the word, jaw head, I guess. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Well --
L:  [NOISE] Kind of dumb --
R:  -- see that -- that --
L:  -- tough more than just dumb. [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] I liked that Big Brother show, because [SIGH] I like to see how people learn to interact with several different people over the course of time.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  How they became --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] friends or enemies, [SIGH] you know, you have to learn to live with people.
L:  [NOISE] Yes. [NOISE] 
R:  If you're stuck in it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- cell --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Anyway. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] I think -- [NOISE] yeah, well, then there's the whole strategy thing too, [NOISE] it's nice to watch that and -- [NOISE] and, uh, you know, they had them just playing to the audience at home the way --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- [NOISE] you do on that show, as opposed to Survivor. [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] Well --
L:  [NOISE] But -- you want to go on?
R:  I -- there --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- there's also --
L: [NOISE]  
R:  -- the, um [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- extreme shows that they try to get people --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to eat bugs and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- jump off buildings --
L:  Yeah, it's -- I kind [NOISE] --
R:  -- and stuff like [LAUGH] that, huh?
L:  [NOISE] I have a little of a roach phobia, so I tend to stay away from [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] that's Fear Factor.
L:  [NOISE] -- shows like that.
R:  Like, Fear Factor.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah, exactly. [NOISE] 
R:  That's a reality based show. [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But I couldn't do any of that stuff --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's kinda neat to watch --
L:  [NOISE] I don't what exactly --
R:  -- the extremes.
L:  -- [NOISE] is supposed to be reality based about that show, it's sort of [NOISE] --
R:  [SIGH] Well, it's just I think it's neat to see the extremes --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that people will go to for money.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  That's really --
L:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- what it all boils down to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] what people will do for money.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  All them shows are.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I guess that's -- I mean it's [LAUGH] -- it's definitely not [NOISE] -- for me, the -- the fascinating part is [NOISE] what [NOISE] will people do.  Is it [NOISE] you know [NOISE] -- they'll -- [NOISE] we know that some people will do anything for money. [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] I guess it's always just a question of what [NOISE] this particular person -- how far this particular person will go. [NOISE] 
R:  Right. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  See, I won't do much --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in the way of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- eating bugs or stuff for money.  No way, mm mm.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. 
R:  I will pass. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Yeah --
R:  [SIGH] But it's --
L:  -- [NOISE] eating bugs for money, I would -- I'd probably draw the line, but, you know, but then, who knows? [NOISE] Some people do it just by -- for their summer on Outward Bound or, you know, like, whatever, but [NOISE] --
R:  [SIGH] You know, it's neat for some people to be on shows like that to show how physically fit they really are, [SIGH] or how pretty --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, that would be fun. [NOISE] 
R:  -- pretty they really are or, you know, whatever it takes to be on that show just to say they made it. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R: I know a lot of people who've become famous -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- off of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- being in them reality shows, too.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] So --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, it's uh, [NOISE] -- do you -- do you mean you know a lot of people personally?
R:  Excuse me?
L:  [NOISE] Did you mean you know a lot of people person- personally --
R:  No, no, no.
L:  -- who've become famous?
R:  No, no, no, no.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.
R:  [SIGH] I'm talking about people that have been of them shows, they've gotten --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, TV show contracts --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and commercial contracts, you know, things like that, where they've gone on to --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. 
R:  -- become famous after --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, this guy, Slavko --
R:  -- being on a reality show.
L:  [NOISE] Yes, this guy, Slavko, you know he had -- he -- when he got voted out of, uh, the Big Brother house, you know, of course, [NOISE] within a week they had -- he had his own, it was like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- Slavko's best, Slavko's world. [NOISE] 
R:  Do you what?  Um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I think I might know -- well, [SIGH] there was a guy that was voted off of some show that has his own sitcom now --
L:  [NOISE] Huh.
R:  -- and I didn't know that, but --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- uh, somebody was telling me about it, because we've seen a commercial for it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] and they told me he was on one of those reality shows [SIGH] --
L:  Hmm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- and got a -- you know, got --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- found, so to speak --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] and [LIPSMACK] has got famous from it, from being a little comedian on his, [LAUGH] you know, [SIGH] through his little stint on TV.
L:  [SIGH] Mhm.
R:  But it's mostly, I think, for people's fifteen minutes of fame and money.  I think that's what that's all about, really. [NOISE] [SIGH] But it's --
L:  It's --
R:  -- entertainment, I guess. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I mean it's, uh ... I guess the two hundred and fifty million people who [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's not everybody can have their fifteen minutes, but it's still pretty amazing how -- how, uh, [NOISE] prescient that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that prediction turned out to be.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I know. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] But it's -- it's -- I mean, now it's just sort of --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- I mean, the -- the sort of running joke in our whole society it seems is just [NOISE] the --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- crazy things [NOISE] some people can become famous for. [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] Mhm.
