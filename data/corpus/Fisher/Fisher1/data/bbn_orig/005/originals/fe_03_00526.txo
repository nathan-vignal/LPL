L:  Hi, my name's Laurie.
R:  Hi, I'm Maureen.
L:  Hi.  [SIGH] 
R:  Hi.
L:  Um, are we supposed to say now what our answer is?
R:  [SIGH] I suppose.  This is my first call, so I --
L:  Me too.
R:  -- really don't know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay, I'm -- I think smoking.
R:  Okay.  Well, I smoke, so I have to --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- disagree. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I have asthma, so there you go.
R:  [LAUGH] I have to go with gossiping, I just think it creates so many problems in the end.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Hurts a lot of people.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah, I -- well, I -- I agree with that part, but 
R:  Yeah, well, I guess that as a smoker I can't agree with you.  Well --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but then again, actually I can, because it really is bad, but I do it anyway.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I know, it's one of those really hard --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- things -- it's a -- well, it's a horrible addiction, it --
R:  It is.
L:  -- once it grabs a hold of you, it's very difficult to stop.
R:  Oh, especially --
L:  My --
R:  -- when you've been doing it for so many years.
L:  Many years, yeah.
R:  Exactly.
L:  My -- my parents smoked for a lot of years and then, when I finally got pregnant, I just -- I said, you know, "I just can't -- can't be round it any more, you're going to have to --"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I went to their house and I said, "You're going to have to go outside [LAUGH] if I'm going to come and visit you".
R:  Oh.  You w-
L:  So, there you go, and then they both stopped because they knew they couldn't be around th- one of my children has a genetic disorder too, so couldn't -- and he's prone to cancer, so [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Oh.  [SIGH] 
L:  -- I just said, "Can't do it around my kids" so they quit.
R:  Oh right.
L:  But, you know, they had a good reason, so 
R:  Well, that's it, I mean, not only don't you do it, but when you can get two other people to quit --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that's great.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] There you go.
R:  A crusader.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah, do what you can do.
R:  That's it [LIPSMACK].  So, I'm really not sure, like I said, I've never done this before, so I don't know what they're -- 
L:  What's next?
R:  -- looking for, or 
L:  I guess we just wait for the next question, maybe, if we -- I don't know what they do.  Maybe they throw the next question at us.  It looked like something interesting to do though, so 
R:  That's what I thought, and I've actually done, um, surveys for [SIGH] this same company.
L:  Have you?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh interesting.  Just on the internet?
R:  [SIGH] Yes.
L:  Oh, like w-
R:  I've done several in the past, and they usually are very interesting --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I enjoy doing them.
L:  Okay.  What state are you in?
R:  [SIGH] I'm in North Carolina.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Wyoming.
R:  Oh, wow.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- well. I've never been to North Carolina, and you've probably never [LAUGH] been to --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- Wyoming.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] No, I haven't.  Actually, I grew up in New York, that was --
L:  Oh, did you?
R:  I've only been in North Carolina for [SIGH] a little over a year.  [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, ahah.  How did you get there?
R:  Um, [LAUGH] that's a long story.  I had an end to a twenty year marriage --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] yes, and it was [SIGH] quite devastating --
L:  I'm sure.
R:  -- and I just decided to [SIGH] start over.  My son is, you know, twenty two years old --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and, kind of left him the house. [LIPSMACK]  So, of course I still pay the bills --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  -- but [LAUGH] -- so -- and just decided, you know, I had some friends down here, and I figured I'd give it a shot and --
L:  Well, what a courageous thing you did.
R:  Yes, and I -- I really do love it, but I'm finding that, you know, every several months, at the most -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I have to go back for a few weeks --
L:  Sure, well --
R:  -- because I just miss it so much.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I'm sure he misses mom too, so  
R:  Well, he won't admit it, but he does.  [SIGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] He likes --
L:  If you're --
R:  -- mom to come home and cook and clean the house. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, is he your only child?
R:  Yes.
L:  Ahah.
R:  Yes.
L:  Twenty two.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH] 
L:  You must have had him when you were a child.
R:  I was twenty.
L:  Yeah, see?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, you're about my age then.
R:  I'm forty two.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I'm forty three.
R:  Ahah and --
L:  But I have little ones --
R:  Little ones, s- s- so --
L:  -- so, there you go.
R:  No, there's something to be said for that, living your life first and then having them [SIGH].  My sisters were much older when they had theirs --
L:  [SIGH] W- What --
R:  -- and I think it's nice to have them young too, because now I'm still young enough --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to do what I want.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
R:  So, um --
L:  Oh, I -- I think there's pros and cons both ways.  Part of me --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- wishes I would have done it sooner, 'cause now I'm going to be old [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Wh- [LAUGH] [SIGH] so --
R:  [LAUGH] How old are they?
L:  -- you know, well I'm already old, but you know --
R:  How old are yours?
L:  -- when they -- when they grow up.  I'm s- forty three, and so, you know, when they're -- when they're leaving college, I'm going to be [COUGH] older, so --
R:  Ahah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- so, pros and cons both ways.
R:  Mm, yeah.  Oh, I guess that I don't have any regrets.  I mean, you know, my sisters are finding, you know, a little difficult now, especially my youngest one -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] -- my youngest sister, she waited quite late [SIGH] and she's got her hands full.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  How many does she have?
R:  She has two, but they were both born with a lot of, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- stomach problems --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and th- that kind of thing, so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they didn't sleep through the night and they were in and out of the hospital --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, how hard.
R:  They never told her that there was a good chance the second one would have the same problems, or she --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- said she never would have had another one.  [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, that's just heart breaking.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it's something inherited?
R:  Yes, yes, I mean they're doing --
L:  Do you know what it is?
R:  I don't recall exactly [SIGH], but I mean, she would come over and feed them a bottle, and they would try to take a little bit and then they would just scream because of the pain.
L:  Oh.
R:  And they were in and out of the hospital, you know, for not eating and that kind of thing, and --
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, it was pretty bad.  They're older now.  They're, uh, almost three and six now.
L:  And are they better or not?
R:  And they're better, but I don't know if, you know, it has anything to do with it, but they're very whiny children. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Great.
R:  [LAUGH] Very difficult to deal with.
L:  [LAUGH] Boy, that says a lot from somebody who doesn't even live with them to have -- [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Exactly.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Very loud, very whiny, just --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- as I said, very difficult to deal with.  They're a handful, [LAUGH] so -- and I'm used to m- you know, mine was just so quiet and entertained himself --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that kind of thing, so 
L:  Oh, she sounds like she has her hands full.
R:  And she works about sixty hours a week.  [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  And her husband works mostly nights and weekends, so when she's, you know, off of work, she's with the kids by herself -- 
L:  Sure.
R:  -- so, there's like no break.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, she's a stressed woman, isn't she?
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And how far away do you live from her?
R:  [SIGH] Oh well, actually, I was about two hours from her.  She's in Connecticut --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- [SIGH] but now, of course, I'm more like ten or eleven hours from her. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  But, you know, like I said, I go back to New York every few months --
L:  [NOISE] Sure.
R:  -- [SIGH] and, you know, I figure that will be for the rest of my life, or as long as I'm in North Carolina, because, you know, that's where my family and [SIGH] a lot of my friends are, so [SIGH] I'll never let go.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's good.
R:  [SIGH] Yes, I just kind of bounce back and forth and [SIGH], you know, kind of have the best of both worlds, I guess.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Well, that's good.
R:  Oh, it's nice.  [NOISE] Oh, I hear yours now.
L:  Yeah.  They're entertaining each other, so, there you go.
R:  Oh, that's a good thing.  How far apart are they in age?
L:  Two years.
R:  Ooh.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Well, see, this is what happens when you're old and you have kids, you have to [LAUGH] hurry up --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and get it done. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, two years, though, that's a -- that's fighting age when they get a little older.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, they'll -- they'll probably be best friends and, um, and they're just close enough to pick on each other at the same time, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's a good thing and a hard thing, so --
R:  Mm, yeah, I'm the middle of three girls, and --
L:  Oh, jeeze.
R:  -- my older sister is only eleven months older than me.
L:  Oh, your poor mother.
R:  Yeah, and my younger sister is only two years younger.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  So, yeah, she had them boom, boom, boom, pretty much [LAUGH], so --
L:  Was she young too when she had hers?
R:  [SIGH] I think, uh, she was twenty three when she had my older sister --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- the first one.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, yeah [SIGH] and three girls -- growing up as three teenage girls, w- w- we just did not get along.  [LAUGH] 
L:  How many bathrooms did you have?
R:  Um, actually --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- we had a large house.  We did have three bathrooms [LAUGH] so --
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  But it wasn't even that, it was just too close in age, you know --
L:  Sure. [NOISE]
R:  -- you're just fighting over everything all the --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- time.
L:  Yeah.
R:   [SIGH] Of course --
L:  Are you close now?
R:  Yes, yes, we are now, but, you know, we're older and a little more mature I'd --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- to think.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Sure.  Well.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, and the funny part is my parents, when they got married, decided [LIPSMACK] they were going to have four boys.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] [LAUGH] Okay, [NOISE] and they finally gave up after the third girl.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's what I figured.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, jeeze.
R:  That's what I figured.  [SIGH] 
L:  Well, there you go. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah, I'm glad I just had the one, though.  I figure one was enough for me.
L:  [SIGH] You're glad what, I'm sorry?
R:  I just had the one.
L:  Oh. [NOISE]
R:  So, one was enough for me.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah.  [NOISE]  Well, it can be li- y- means you can spend more time with them, which is nice. [NOISE]
R:  Right, and [NOISE] I stayed at home too, until he was about fifteen. [NOISE]  I didn't work outside the house.  [SIGH] 
L:  Ahah, and what do you do?
R:  [SIGH] I'm a bookkeeper, [SIGH]. 
L:  Ahah.  For --
R:  [LIPSMACK] So --
L:  -- what kind of company?
R:  Well, right now I'm working for a painting business that actually a friend of mine owns.
L:  Oh, that works out nicely. [NOISE]
R:  It works out very well, so when I need to go back to New York, I can --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- still handle the job, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it works out quite well.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And it's one of those professions that you can pretty much do wherever you go.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Exactly.  In fact, one of -- th- that was another reason why I chose to come down here, because within a few months [SIGH] -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of my marriage ending, the place I was working went out of business.
L:  The place that you were working, what, I'm sorry?
R:  They went out of business.
L:  Oh, jeeze.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] Yes, so --
L:  How scary is that?
R:  -- I said, "Okay, [LAUGH] let's see".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Is this an omen, that I'm supposed to be moving on, or what?
R:  [LAUGH] Life is changing drastically [LAUGH] in a short time.
L:  Wow.
R:  So 
L:  Well, that's I -- ki- sounds like it kind of came i- i- in a -- at a time that kinda helped to make a decision to make big changes in your life.
R:  [SIGH] That's true.
L:  [NOISE] Yes.
R:  It did, and you know, [SIGH] some people say, "Well, you really haven't made a decision, you're kind of going back and forth" and I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- said, "Well, it's working --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for me right now.
L:  Sure.
R:  So -- [SIGH] and my son was very dependent on his mom, being that I was a stay at home --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- mom.
L:  Sure. [NOISE]
R:  And this has given him a chance --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to get a little more independence --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- without being left totally on his own.
L:  Ahah.
R:  He's got --
L:  Kind of that in between stage.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  So, he's learned to grow up --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- quite a bit in the last -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, year and a half, which is nice.
L:  Yeah.  Is your husband around him?
R:  Yes, mhm.
L:  That's good, so he kind of [NOISE] has both parents still.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, he's, um, you know, he's still a little angry with his dad that the whole thing ended because his dad, I guess, mid life crisis --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- decided to have an affair.  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
