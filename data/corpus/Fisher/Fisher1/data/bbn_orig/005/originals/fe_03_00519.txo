L:  Yeah, my name is Pen.
R:  Hi Pen, my name is Kathy.
L:  Yeah, how you doing Kathy?
R:  Good.  How are you today?
L:  All right.  What --
R:  Excellent.
L:  What -- what do you think on these habits?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh boy.  What's the worst?  I would probably have to say smoking.
L:  Smoking?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I think it interferes with other people's space and the rest of them really don't.  I mean, they're all not great habits.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But smoking, um, I don't know if you've ever been out on a date with somebody who didn't smoke or did.  I don't smoke so going out on a date with somebody who does is -- it's very -- it's -- it's -- it's rough because they, you know, have the smoke in your face the whole time and ... [LAUGH]
L:  What -- what they don't even ask you?  I thought most people that smoked these days are so, uh, so hesitant to do something without getting --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- uh, permission all up and down the line.
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, I guess, uh, I guess I've been out with some great guys.  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess that -- that was the first and only date then, right?
R:  [LAUGH]  That was it.
L:  Aside from their smoking, how was they?
R:  All finished.  Um, [LIPSMACK] what about you?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What do you think?
L:  Well, I don't know.  I think, uh, I think not exercising could be a problem 'cause --
R:  Mm.  Yeah.
L:  -- you can get away with a lot of overeating and a lot of smoking and a lot of abusing yourself, but if you exercise okay you're probably --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- gonna have some other decent, uh, decent health habits to help keep you right.
R:  Yeah, that's a good point.  Um, I'm an exerciser myself so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [COUGH] I do know what you mean.  I don't know that I would call that a bad habit though -- like, somebody's personal habits.
L:  Well, not exercising is what they listed at the beginning, I believe.
R:  Right.  Yes.  No, they definitely did.  But the only reason I didn't think of that one really is because I don't know that I would call that, like, a bad personal habit.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, that's more of like a personal choice that you make for yourself.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That -- that -- that was my take on it.
L:  Yeah.  [COUGH]  What -- what -- what did you think about -- is this your first time you've been on a -- one of these phone calls?
R:  It is.  It is.
L:  Yeah, it's my first time too.
R:  Is it?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I wonder what they're looking for?  They're probably recording us and looking for s- -- I don't know if they're looking for speech patterns or vocabulary, or what the heck they're trying to figure out with this thing.
R:  I think the way we interact is --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- the way that they're -- they're trying to see when you speak with a stranger how you interact, I think.
L:  I got no problem talking with strangers.  I go out of my way to talk with strangers.
R:  [LAUGH]  Very friendly.
L:  Pure -- well, I was brou- -- I was born up in a small town so ...
R:  Oh.
L:  That's -- that's -- you know, that's kind of my way.  That's kinda -- 
R:  Where were you brought up?
L:  Huh?
R:  Where were you brought up?
L:  In -- in -- in Alexandria.
R:  Virginia?
L:  Alexan- -- Virginia.  Mhm.
R:  Oh, okay.  I had a girlfriend who went to, uh [LIPSMACK] ...  Oh goodness, she went to college in -- somewhere down near there.  'Cause I passed through there when I went to visit her.  A little while ago.
L:  Mm.
R:  I'm sorry, I don't remember the name of the town.  [LAUGH]
L:  It wasn't Alexandria 'cause there's no colleges in Alexandria. [LAUGH]
R:  No, no, no.  I passed through Alexandria.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, I remember --
L:  Well, it could've been -- could've been Merrymount.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Merrymount.
R:  Wait, and she went for music.  That's a good music school, right?
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  She went -- she plays the oboe.  
L:  Yeah, that's up in -- that's up in North Arlington [MN] right -- right across the, uh, [COUGH] right across on one of the bridges from DC so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, that's a pretty high dollar school, too.
R:  Yeah.  Well she was very blessed.  She got a, um, scholarship to go there so ...
L:  Mm.  [MN]
R:  That was the only -- but then she wound up interning in DC not in her field, and now she's working, um, at like a concert hall so she's not playing.  She's a little frustrated about the situation [LAUGH] right now.
L:  Mhm.  Well, I guess there's not a huge market for oboe players, even though you might be very skilled.
R:  I know.  I know.  I think you have to play with, uh -- it's not really a solo instrument --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you have to play with a orchestra.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which makes it difficult for you to find, you know, the right orchestra to play with.  Auditions are always tough, so ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  So, yeah.  That's all I have to say about her.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [COUGH]  But, uh, yeah, I think that's, uh -- that's kind of a interesting, uh, interesting experiment what they doing.  I hope -- I hope they would, uh, be willing to put up whatever their findings are so we can take a look and see what it's about.
R:  That's what I wanted.  Yeah.  I hope they do.  Um, at least, like, afterwards tell us what it was about and what they were looking at.  I would love to hear that stuff.
L:  Mhm.  Are you one of the paid people on this thing?
R:  I'm not sure.
L:  [MN]
R:  I think so.  I think they mentioned that you get ten dollars a phone call or something?
L:  [COUGH].  Mm, could be.  I know they said something --
R:  Uh-oh, are you smoking?
L:  I know they -- I know they said -- yeah, I'm smoking.
R:  Uh-oh!  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm smoking.
R:  I hope I didn't insult you.
L:  Oh no, not at all.  
R:  Okay.  I really did not mean to.
L:  You got -- look, you got to be -- you got -- you got -- look, you got to be thin -- thick skinned to be a smoker these days.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, I know.  If -- if you hear about what's going on in New York right now.  Some New Yorker, and the stuff that's going on with the, uh -- 'cause Mayor Bloomberg just banned smoking in all public places.
L:  Huh.
R:  You can't smoke anywhere now.
L:  That's ridiculous.
R:  I kn- I -- I kind of agree with you.  Um, you know, I [MN] -- like I said, that it's -- it's offensive to me, like, when people blow it in my face and stuff.  But to cut --
L:  But that, uh --
R:  -- it out of bars and you can't smoke at concerts anymore.  Like, it's crazy.
L:  Mm.
R:  I think people have to be able to smoke a little bit.  You know, I mean, be --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Be, uh, wary of what's around you but I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like you said, I think a lot of smokers are right now because of what's going on. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, but yeah, not anymore in New York.
L:  Oh.  But -- but the last thing I heard about Bloomberg and smoking he was -- he was counting the benefits of marijuana.
R:  Oh, I never heard about that.
L:  You never saw that?
R:  No.
L:  One -- one of the -- one of the clients I do some work for -- work for, is a -- is a lobby group down in DC.  They're called the --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- NORML, N.O.R.M.L.
R:  Okay.
L:  National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  And they've been around for a long time.  And, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, uh, they -- they had a -- they had a little blurb at one of his, uh, one of his news conferences.  You know, somebody asked him -- it was sort of off the cuff.  [SIGH]  You know, like, uh, asked him if ever he smoked marijuana.
R:  Okay.
L:  And he said -- he said, uh, he said, uh, "I did and I enjoyed the heck out of it".
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  And the people at NORML got a hold of that [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] and, uh, the Mayor seemed to go along too, because they -- they would -- they were doing a lot of, uh, billboard advertising and bus advertising and stuff with a picture -- a picture of Mayor Bloomberg up there with that big quote next to him, uh ...
R:  Oh, my goodness. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, no.  I definitely -- how I could not --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- have heard about that?
L:  Oh, they got a lot of -- they got -- they got millions and millions of dollars worth of free publicity behind that, on top of the half million they spent for their own publicity, but they was on -- it was on Letterman and Leno and everybody.  Saturday Night did a thing on it. 
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  I guess this was back in April of last year.
R:  You know, but they -- people in the public like -- like politicians really have to be careful what --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they say.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you know, it's like with my kids.  You know, I got -- I got three sons.  They, uh -- oldest one's -- oldest one's eleven.  And, uh, got one nine and got one eight.  And, uh --
R:  Oh, boy.  You're a young father.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well I got -- got started late but, uh, got on a good roll.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Got on a good roll.
R:  And you have experience behind you.  
L:  Mhm, well that's --
R:  So I'm sure you'll be a wonderful dad to them.
L:  Yeah.  Well they -- well they -- well they -- you know they turning up -- turning out pretty good so far.
R:  Yeah, good.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Bless you.
L:  But we have these discussions about drugs and, shit, I grew up in the seventies.  You know, I got out of high school in nineteen seventy one.
R:  Right.
L:  And, uh, you know, the [COUGH] the -- the biggest thing I tell 'em is, you know, not -- you know, not just smoking pot is -- is not good for you.  It's not -- it's definitely not good for you but -- but the biggest thing is -- is [COUGH] when I was a kid smoking pot the quality and the potency of the stuff that's out there now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's just absolutely outrageous.  Absolutely outrageous.
R:  It's no good?  I have no -- I'm sorry I have no idea.
L:  Now -- now you got all this premium stuff out there.  Man, they got -- they got these --
R:  Oh, it's very good.
L:  -- hybrids and -- they got all these hybrids and people, you know, growing 'em in the grow lights, and, you know, picking out the best ones.  And they got names for all of the stuff.  I mean we used to talk about, you know, one toke -- you know, one toke killer pot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Back in our day, and it would definitely give you a buzz but you smoke some of the stuff that's out there now and it'll just knock you out.
R:  Really?
L:  It is so much stronger than what we -- that we have today.  So -- so rather than, you know, trying to [COUGH] trying to do the dad thing and say it's bad for you.  I tell them, "Look, you know, it was bad when I did it and it's--
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- you know, thirty times as bad now".
R:  Even worse now.  Yeah.
L:  Thirty times as bad now.  Because at least when I was doing it you would get happy.  Right?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  You know, when I smoked pot you get happy and --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you get -- and you get the munchies.  You smoke the stuff that's out there now and you're a zombie.  
R:  Yeah.  It does.  It ki- it kicks your butt.
L:  I mean you're a zombie.  I mean just one little -- you know, just one little puff [MN] you know, because I -- I -- I been out with some friends of mine, you know, a while back.  And this guy had some stuff, of course the price is quite a bit different too.  You know, we talk about the good old days about the nickel bag.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  Right.  Well, what was a nickel bag these days is about seventy five dollars.  
R: I know.  [LAUGH]  Oh, gosh.  It's so different.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  My parents, um, graduated a little -- a little later than you.  I'm young.  I'm only twenty three.  
L:  Mm.
R:  But my parents graduated a little, um, a little later and they also went through the whole, you know, smoking pot back then and my father dealt a little bit.  It was crazy.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, when he was a kid but, yeah, he said a- as we were growing up -- he w- -- they were so honest with me and it really helped me to, like, more understand the bad side of it and why not to do it instead of them just being, like, you know, "Don't do it, it's not good for you" like you're saying.
L:  Mm.  Mhm.
R:  Because that doesn't get through to kids, you know.
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  Getting through -- what got through to me was that they were so honest and truthful and they were like, "Listen, it's -- it's -- it's awful.  The stuff that's around is bad and it kicks -- it messes with your head". 
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] You know, so, yeah, it's definitely --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's no good.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Yep, but you know another -- another good line I use with my kids is -- you know they always trying the same stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I tell my oldest one, I say, "Look, [SIGH] you can't get over on me.
R:  [LAUGH]  I did the same stuff.  [LAUGH]
L:  You can't -- you can't get over on me.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because let me put it to you like this
