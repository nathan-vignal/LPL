L:  My name is Mike.
R:  My name is Amant[?].  Nice to meet you.
L:  Um, so, we just engage in conversation, then?
R:  Right.  So, the topic is, uh, about disarming Iraq.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, um, [LIPSMACK] well, my personal thoughts are that, um, we should engage with the United Nations.  We should follow through with the planned, um, inspections --
R:  Right.  Um --
L:  -- to completion, and if the --
R:  But what if --
L:  Pardon?
R:  -- going through the United Nations does not get you the result that United States expect?
L:  Then I think that the best step for the United States were to -- um, would be to form alliances with neighboring countries to put economic and diplomatic pressure on [SIGH] Iraq.  In other words, make it economically beneficial for them, and also socially, [SIGH] um, beneficial for the leadership.  I don't think going in and [SIGH] starting a war is going to make Iraq feel any more secure about itself and therefore give up any means of defenses.
R:  Correct, and that is my opinion too, as far as war with Iraq is concerned, because war not only brings hardship to a lot of innocent people, there are far greater consequences, in terms of, uh, innoce- lots of innocent lives being destroyed, and you don't know what -- what -- what kind of war would it lead to.  Like how long it would last, how many people would die, and, uh, it -- it may spread over to more than just Iraq, like it may spread over to neighboring countries.  Israel may be involved.  So you are not very sure, like, how the war's going to be fought.  But, yes, [LIPSMACK] the one thing that's disturbing me is weapons of mass destruction and United States should be forthright in giving out details or other evidences of that kind, so that whatever Iraq is portraying, United States can tell the world that -- that it's not correct, right?
L:  I agree, um, based on the past relationship between Iraq and the United States, [SIGH] um, mainly their alliance to fight Iran, [SIGH] um, a lot of information and training was passed on to Iraq that America hasn't made public, and so it's another very good point you make. [SIGH] I think America could inform [SIGH] the United Nations, um, a lot more than it has on what potentials to expect from Iraq in terms of their -- [SIGH] their weapons of mass destruction.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, yeah, I also agree to with, um, the innocents.  That really bothers me.  I don't think  that this is actually even truly a war, it just seem more like an, [SIGH] um, an aggressive muscling of a sovereign nation to obey the will of, uh -- of another, [SIGH], um, even if the leadership of Iran is -- of Iraq, sorry, is very inconvenient, it, nevertheless, is a sovereign country.
R:  Right.
L:  So.
R:  Nobody is saying that Saddam is good.  Of course, like everyone knows, he has done lots of, uh, things that are not appropriate, but, yes, uh, attacking anyone without evidence our without justification may cause hardships to everyone.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I agree. [SIGH] Ha, I don't understand at all this rush, um, I think war should be the most serious of decisions, and, um, just like with a -- a capital trial based on, perhaps, a person's. um, committing of a murder, they have [SIGH] many, many appeals, [SIGH] they have no limit of time, justice is the primary concern and that doesn't seem to be the -- the concern of the American government at this time.
R:  Right, but you may have to also consider the -- the American government themselves, what type of information they have.  Maybe the information they have is too strong or too -- or what you may call -- that the information may be -- may be so strong that they can't pass it on over to the common public, because there's always the fear that if information is spread out, then maybe they know where the weapons of mass destruction, it might give to them a chance to just relocate those weapons somewhere else.
L:  Yeah, that -- that is a good point, but, um, if they -- you see the -- if they do have all this amazing satellite, um, technology, if they do, [SIGH] um, maintain their -- their flying zones over the north and south of Iraq, I think that they would be easily in a position to monitor any, um, of the scale of movement required to move storage, to move, um, laboratories, those kinds of things --
R:  Right.
L:  -- s- so I don't think it would be something that overnight Iraq could change and get away with.  I think that America would be very carefully observing from every mean they -- every means they had.
R:  Right.  But what about chemical and biological weapons?  Like, from what I heard, it could be concealed in a -- such a small area that even the satellites wouldn't be able to detect it.
L:  [SIGH] That's true, but, uh, the movement itself, unless it was done with preexisting underground tunnels which, to my knowledge, what I've read, don't really exist, if they ma- made a convoy of trucks, if they, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, established a new storage site, I think, um, even the sm- smallest of buildings, its construction could be monitored from comprehensive satellite imaging with flyover radar scans, [SIGH] um, or even old fashioned intelligence gathering, um, yeah, I -- I do know that just a small amount of chemical can cause a lot of damage [SIGH] but I -- I still don't see that -- this whole idea of a sovereign country being attacked by another with just allegations is disturbing to me, and, um --
R:  Right, [SIGH] --
L:  -- and until it's proven --
R:  -- maybe then we all think that some things need to be changed, but the manner in which the change has to be done should be different -- a bit different.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yes, I -- I don't think war -- I think [SIGH] if we put as much effort into diplomacy with neighboring countries of Iraq who h- who share a [SIGH] religious, um, similarity and also a culture background, [SIGH] then I think with their gentle leanings they could, um, mold a different -- maybe a sense of security within Iraq so they wouldn't feel the need to posture as they are right now.
R:  Right, but hasn't United States tried that for a long time and they must surely have thought about all those possibilities before deciding on this course?
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I don't know.  I think that, um, instability in the Mid East has actually been something useful to the United States.  It's allowed them to build an in- incredibly lopsided power in the state of Israel, with all these alleged enemies, and I think that if there was peace in the Middle East, um, America would have a lot less of a -- a military presence and therefore a lot less of a, um, a deciding voice, since we have never really seemed to approach things diplomatically, we've had al- this country has always used its muscle [SIGH] and, um, [LIPSMACK] I think that if it were to move towards diplomacy we'd get a lot more done [SIGH] than what it's demonstrated so far just with force.  I find the -- [LAUGH] the Arab people to be, in their history, a very resilient and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- remembering race.
R:  Yeah, but just diplomacy sometimes does not give you the desired result. [SIGH] 
L:  Well, yeah, I -- I -- I always link diplomacy with something of benefit to them, so, um, mil- um, economic aid and development --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, on a similar par with what we've done with Israel [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if we were show those same, um, if that -- if we showed the same willingness to help develop some of those other poorer countries, of which Iraq is one --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] even though they do have a, um, a revenue from oil, if we were to give them other means of, uh, developing themselves, we'd establish a friendship base.  Not just talk and rhetoric, but actually an investment of our time, money and expertise and technology [SIGH] more like a -- a sitting down and explain to the [SIGH] that we -- we aren't an enemy to be feared and hence armed against.
R:  That -- that's absolutely essential, that, uh, the people of Iraq and the United States get +closer -- closer to each other.  Of course, like -- but when it comes to engaging the people of Iraq, Saddam would always come into prominence.  He's one guy whom we would have to deal with if United States had to deal with Iraq, and the US is very uncomfortable with dealing with him, as things stand right now.
