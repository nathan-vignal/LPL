R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Hi, my name is Stacey.
R:  [SIGH] Hi, I'm Vicky. [LAUGH] I don't know which is worse. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] They're all pretty bad. [LAUGH] [SIGH] 
L:  Yes, um, definitely they're all pretty bad. [NOISE] 
R:  Yes, they are.  Probably no exercise is the worst, [SIGH] that's my opinion I think, really, [SIGH] because I smoke, well, that can't be too bad. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] In my --
L:  Well, I --
R:  -- opinion anyway.
L:  Well, I smoke and drink coffee, so -- [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- it's just right.
R:  Yes, it does.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  Definitely smoking.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah, my mom's got lung cancer, so, you know, it -- smoking i- is -- is bad. [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  And what were some of the other ones again?  I -- I [SIGH] I don't re- [SIGH] they gave us a list of several things. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] Wasn't it overeating was one?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, overeating was one, but I don't have a problem there actually, I'm trying to gain weight.
R:  [LAUGH] I've got a big problem there. [LAUGH] Oh. [SIGH] Maybe they're all bad.
L:  Yeah, really. [LAUGH] 
R:  When you really think about it. [LAUGH] For some people or another, [SIGH] huh?
L:  [NOISE] I agree, you know, because I've had no role model.  I guess you could say monkey on our back, or what have you. [SIGH] 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  They gave us a weird one to do too, so  [LAUGH] At least for my -- this is my first time --
L:  [NOISE] Mine as well.
R:  -- to do this. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So, I don't know. [LAUGH] Pretty weird.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That it is. [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Yes, this is. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Anything for a buck, you know? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And just give you a topic and you just --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- talk away.
R:  All right, here, discuss -- okay. [LAUGH] And I said, "Okay, I- I'll try it. 
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  I'll try it. [SIGH] I don't see why not. 
L:  So, you said you smoke as well?
R:  Yes.
L:  How long have you smoked?
R:  Oh, since I was a kid.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  You know, when -- here my mom, she has lung cancer, and I still won't quit.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, she actually --
R:  That's bad.
L:  Yeah, my father actually --
R:  It is --
L:  -- died of cancer.
R:  Oh we have it here[?]. [SIGH] Oh, I know it's bad.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  But, you know, you're hooked, you're hooked.
L:  Yep.
R:  [SIGH] It really is a bad thing.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  Pride. 
L:  Have you ever tried to quit?
R:  Yes.  Oh, yes. [SIGH] I saw what my mom's gone through for the last two years, and now she's in the last stages of liver cancer.
L:  Oh.
R:  And it -- it's not pretty.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.
L:  See, I couldn't imagine, you know, I don't know whether --
R:  Seeing her not be able to breathe --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's emphysema, lung cancer and -- and the liver cancer too, so -- and then with [NOISE] -- with the combination of all of them is -- it's -- it's all horrible.  And I've seen it fir- first hand, so 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And my grandmother, she had emphysema too, and she couldn't breathe, COPD[?], and was on a breathing machine or oxygen all th- all the time.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Starving for breath, so, you know, I -- I [LAUGH] ought to quit. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] I mean, I have tried several times, and the patches don't work for me, the gum doesn't work.
L:  Yeah, I've never really tried any of the, I guess you could say conventional methods of trying to quit.
R:  Mm. [SIGH] It just --
L:  I don't know, I really don't -- I don't have the drive.  That's what it seems like sometimes.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] I just enjoy it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, I really do.
L:  Yeah, and I want an excuse to go outside on breaks. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, the non-smokers, they just sit there.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Don't think I'd manage.
R:  And then on top of that, I'm a nurse aide too, so, you know?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I get it all the way round. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, goodness.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I can imagine your line of work, so 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Oh, heavens, yes.
L:  And you hear it from your patients, I'm sure.
R:  Oh yeah, [SIGH] they gripe too.  "Why do you smell like cigarettes" and other things.  "Look what you smell like".
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] You know?
L:  I know --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- especially when you come in from smoking.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Try to scrub down head to toe, you know? [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's funny you mentioned that --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  I had a -- I -- I'm sure you've heard of, like, Scruff McGruff, ah, you know, crime --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- dog?
R:  The crime dog, mhm.
L:  Yeah, I ordered a magazine online for my little nephew --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and they were talking about not smoking in there, and they actually compared the smoking to licking an ashtray --
R:  [SIGH] [MN] 
L:  -- so that's what he says to me when he sees --
R:  Oh, God.
L:  -- me smoking, "Ah, you're licking an ashtray, Titi".
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my God, gross.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  But, yeah.
R:  Thank you. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm, rub it in.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  They -- they really try to get on me too about quitting.
R:  Yeah, I got a granddaughter who's seven, who'll be eight and [SIGH] she's on me too.  They re- they're on that stuff at school now, I'm telling ya. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  I thought they were bad when I was a kid in school, but no. [LAUGH] I mean, we still got to smoke in highschool.
L:  Really? 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Wow.
R:  We did, we got to, you know, smoke outside -- "Go to the smoke hole".
L:  Mm.
R:  And, nah uh, I was so glad they didn't have that when ev- when my daughter went. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] But she smokes too.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] See with me, I started off stealing cigarettes out of my sister's pack --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- it always starts off like that, you know, but -- and then you progress to buying a pack, or what have you, but --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- and you're hooked at that point.
R:  [LAUGH] Cigarettes were thirty five cents a pack when I started smoking.
L:  [SIGH] Gee.
R:  [SIGH] So, yeah, I'm old now, I'm only forty four. [LAUGH] 
L:  And they were like in -- twenty in the pack back then?
R:  Ahah.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Wow, what has happened?
R:  [LAUGH] The taxes. Uh -- they -- see, ev- even the -- the government wa- well, wants us to quit that bad.
L:  I see.
R:  Taxes are just so bad, ahah.
L:  Mm.
R:  The national health care.  See, they can just go there everywhere.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Go into every kind of direction.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They blame cigarettes for everything, you know.  I mean, we all actually can't really go to a bar any more and smoke.
L:  Or a restaurant for that matter, anywhere.  You get people, you know, [SIGH] and --
R:  Well, I still --
L:  -- I don't have a --
R:  I know where to go to eat to have w- well, to smoke in a restaurant. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, you know, after you've eaten, you want to sit back and have a cigarette.
R:  Relax.
L:  Yeah, oh.
R:  Especially at a bar or club.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  I mean, that just goes hand in hand, a drink --
L:  Do they don't have --
R:  -- and a cigarette.
L:  -- that where you're at?
R:  Ahah.
L:  Well, they have a few places here, in New York, but, I don't kn- yeah, that's true, they're getting rarer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and rarer.
R:  You just got to know where to go, you just got to go to the smaller places --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know?  But I -- but I -- But I heard New York's getting pretty bad about it, yeah.
L:  Yeah, oh, my gosh, eight per cent sales tax. [NOISE] 
R:  Well, see, I buy -- a carton of cigarettes for me is eleve- I mean, twelve dollars.
L:  Mm.
R:  I but it at the Indian smoke shop.
L:  Wow.
R:  But they're generic.  I used to smoke Cools.
L:  Ahah.
R:  [SIGH] And Wood -- [SIGH] I want one right now. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] You know, oh, I'd give anything to have a real ciga- that's what --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I call a real cigarette.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But I'm smoking generic because the price is so high.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I can buy two cartons for the price of one.
L:  Wow, that's true. [NOISE] 
R:  You know, so I -- [MN] 
L:  [MN] Why -- why don't you check out online sometimes too?  You find some pretty good deals with the free shipping and stuff.
R:  [SIGH] But I still get mine cheaper at the smoke shop.
L:  At the Raz[?]?  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.  [SIGH] Yeah, and we just got 'em everywhere here.  I l- I'm in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And it's like Indian capital of the world --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- almost, you know?
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH] I mean, they got smoke shops in little wee holes in the walls.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You're right in the heart, huh?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Wow.
R:  And all the casinos and all that stuff too, [LAUGH] so 
L:  Well, how's the weather there?
R:  Um, it's cold.
L:  Really?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.  I think --
L:  We're still -- 
R:  -- I think we're due to be like thirteen in the morning.
L:  Oh, wow.  Sounds like --
R:  Like --
L:  -- us.
R:  -- we'll have a cold like f- like for two or three days [SIGH] and then there'll be a -- you know, fully graduate to sixty and then, damn, we're back down again.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I mean, it just goes from sixty to twelve --

L:  Oh, yes, and it's still snowing.
R:  No. [LAUGH] Oh, I love snow.
L:  Oh, goodness, I hate the snow.

L:  [NOISE] Yeah, can y-
