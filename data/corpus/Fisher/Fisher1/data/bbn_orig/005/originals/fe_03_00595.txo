R:  [NOISE] 
L:  This is Pam.
R:  Hi, Pam, this is Joan.
L:  What was your -- what did you say?
R:  This is Joan, and --
L:  Joan, okay.
R:   -- where are you from?
L:  I'm from Michigan.
R:  Oh, I'm in Long Island, New York.
L:  Long Island, New York?
R:  Yeah, and I bet we're colder --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- than you are. [SIGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] I think you are --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- 'cause I [MN] -- I think we get the weather first and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then you get it. [SIGH] 
R:  But two days ago they said it was colder here than it was in Juno, Alaska. [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, I --
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  -- didn't hear that.
R:  -- [SIGH] but, uh --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- now, we're supposed to talk about the holidays?
L:  Holidays, yeah.
R:  Okay, how did you [LAUGH] get through yours?
L:  Well, uh, no snow here in -- I'm in Pinconning, Michigan, which is kind of, [SIGH] they say, on the index finger knuckle. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, we only had a little tiny dusting of snow.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK] And usually family gets together, um, my husband's side of the family and we get together usually on Christmas day [SIGH] and then my side of the family, we pick another, um, day because my older brother works for a travel agency so he's all the time on tours --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- so we have to find a weekend day when he's --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- not scheduled for work.  How about you?
R:  Well, um, my side of the family's all gone, I'm the last one -- I have my children and my grandchildren --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] and, uh, we spent it at my daughter's and got caught coming home in that major snowstorm. [SIGH] 
L:  Oh. [SIGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] What's usually a twenty minute took us, I think, two hours [SIGH] and for --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- while there we all weren't sure we were going to make it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But all in all it was an -- [MN] a nice holiday. [SIGH] I always enjoy [SIGH] -- well, now that have grandchildren, it's fun again, [SIGH] and once --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my children grew up, you know, [SIGH] Christmas was just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- giving presents and getting presents and [SIGH] -- but now it's fun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, now you can try to figure out what you can get the little ones and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and watch 'em --
R:  Oh, I love -- that's it, I just love to --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- watch them open presents. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, yeah, how many children do you have?
R:  I have two daughters, yeah.
L:  Two daughters, and then how many grandchildren?
R:  Two.  Two boys.
L:  Two, mhm.
R:  So, I'm [SIGH] now learning --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what it's like to have boys in the house.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's a totally different thing than --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- having two girls in the house. [SIGH] 
L:  Right, yeah, [SIGH] um, as far as, uh, [LIPSMACK] what did he say?  We're sup- if we could create a holiday?
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- what would you do for that? [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- I've been racking my brain, I -- I don't know what hol- what holiday I would -- oh, universal peace day, where everybody in the --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- world would stop fighting. [SIGH] That, I think would be wonderful. [SIGH] 
L:  That would a good one.
R:  I'm praying for that one.  I don't think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'll see it in my lifetime though. 
L:  [LIPSMACK] No, and I'd probably say let's do one for our pets.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes, my -- my cat would love you. [LAUGH] 
L:  So would mine. [LAUGH] [SIGH] What type of a cat do you have?
R:  I have -- I -- I don't know what she is, but [SIGH] as long as I [SIGH] do the right thing she lets me live in her house. [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.  That's the personality that they get, I think.
R:  Yeah, she'll be fifteen in March, [LIPSMACK] and she --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- still rules the roost. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] Right now we currently have a -- about a four and a half year old Maine Coon.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  Yeah, she's a gorgeous little doll.
R:  Oh, my grandfather used to have one.
L:  Well, I can't say -- I can't say little.
R:  No, I would imagine --
L:  She's a --
R:  -- not.
L:  -- no, she's a large female, um, [LIPSMACK] probably about sixteen and a half pounds.
R:  Oh, my. [SIGH] 
L:  But she's, you know, solid.  She's -- at -- that breed is real big.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, but, like, you said yours was fifteen?  We -- our previous cat before got this Maine Coon, [SIGH] uh, Dusty, I had gotten her from my husband's mother, just a barn kitty, but she had longer hair, we had her for nineteen and a half --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  -- years.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, well --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- mine's still going strong, and --
L:  Mhm. [SIGH] Inside cat, though?
R:  Oh, yes, [SIGH] yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, [SIGH] we used to have outside cats [SIGH] and it's too heartbreaking, they get hurt and they get lost --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and [SIGH] I didn't want to do that any more.
L:  Yeah, and you expose them to --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- too much --
R:  -- that's what I mean.
L:  -- um, other --
R:  Right.
L:  -- cats' fights and fleas and everything --
R:  Yes, oh, I've been --
L:  -- else outside, so 
R:  -- through that one. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I remember one year everybody in the family went around scratching. [SIGH] That was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- horrible.  What's your cat's name?
L:  Cheyenne.
R:  Oh, what a pretty name.  
L:  Yeah.  What about yours?
R:  Sheena, she's the queen of the --
L:  Sheena?
R:  -- jungle.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
R:  When we got her in --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- [SIGH] one of the animal shelters here, [SIGH] my daughter and I went to pick out a kitten, [SIGH] and as we opened the cage to pick out a kitten, [SIGH] she put --
L:  She picked you out?
R:  She climbed out of the cage, climbed onto my daughter's shoulder --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- walked over to my d- my shoulder, [SIGH] and I said, "Oh, well, I guess we got our cat". [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And she's run our lives ever since. [SIGH] Oh.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But --
L:  Well, and what they can do, you know, just their personalities and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- everything [SIGH] --
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- they really can go -- see, what other holidays ?
R:  Okay, I'm trying to think, uh, [SIGH] we already have children's day every day. [SIGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] trying to think what else?
L:  Maybe they could do one like you said, one for universal peace --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but maybe one for, um, [LIPSMACK] like, lend a helping hand or something.
R:  That would be nice.
L:  On that day everybody, throughout the whole day, whatever you're doing, you try to be helpful to somebody.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I know --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I know a lot of people that are pr- are practising that random ki- acts of kindness --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- [SIGH] which I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is a wonderful idea.  When I was [SIGH] growing up, that was just accepted, everybody did that. [LAUGH] 
L:  Did -- yeah, yeah, and we've gotten away --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- from it.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I know I grew up with my grandfather living in a room and everything in, like, a little area that we had built off the back of the garage.  He helped my mother and father build our house --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] and we had a real good sized bedroom with a bath and everything, you know, a TV and that back there, but he'd come down in the house by us during the day and in the evening -- if we were there, you know, [SIGH] and you'd gain a real respect, but [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] I think, what I try to do, because I grew up with him, I never had a babys- we never had babysitters.
R:  No, I didn't either and neither did my children. [SIGH]
L:  Mhm, [LIPSMACK] and I think, um, what I always try to do, [SIGH] um, people -- it's funny how people look at you right now, if I go to the grocery store [SIGH] and somebody is picking the groceries out of their cart and putting them in their vehicle, [SIGH] and they've got the cart just about empty and I need --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I'm going to use the cart in the store anyway, I'll say to 'em, "I'll take your cart back in if you're done".  They look at you like --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- " [MN] Oh, [LAUGH] okay". [SIGH] Or, you know, be in the store and help --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- somebody.
R:  But I'm finding --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I'm, as you've probably guessed, I'm not very young, [SIGH] and I do find now, like in the, uh, supermarkets --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, elderly people will help me if they see I'm struggling to reach something or get --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- something, [SIGH] whereas the younger [SIGH] people get annoyed with me and hit me with their [LAUGH] carts --
L:  If you --
R:  -- because I don't get out of their way fast enough.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I will -- if I need help, [SIGH] uh, I notice it's the older people who come to my aid. [LIPSMACK] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I guess because that was something we learned as children.
L:  Yes, I think so, I think that's true, Joan.
R:  Yeah, and that -- and it seems that this -- the new generation isn't teaching their children that. [SIGH] I have seen --
L:  No.
R:  -- so many rude little children --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or little children that are in stores screaming because they want something and their mothers [SIGH] are ignoring them [SIGH] and then will --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- hit their mothers.  Oh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if I had ever raised my hand to my mother, [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] You'd be looking to see if you still --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- had your hand, wouldn't you? [LAUGH] 
R:  You betcha, and, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it wasn't a bad way to be raised, I'll tell you.
L:  No.
R:  [SIGH] It gave me an appreciation --
L:  No.
R:  -- for [SIGH] just about everything, people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people, [SIGH] living things, [SIGH] gardening. [LIPSMACK] You mentioned a, uh, garage.  Do you [SIGH] have any sort of farmland?
L:  Are -- we have about three and a half acres of land --
R:  Oh, lucky you.
L:  -- yes.  It's -- it's not farmland, thought, it's, uh, wooded --
R:  Yeah, oh.
L:  -- you know, but my husband grew up on a farm, you know, so his dad still has probably about a hundred and twenty acres of farmland.
R:  Oh, my, you --
L:  He doesn't farm, but they run it all.
R:  Yeah, oh, you're so lucky. [LAUGH] I -- I was raised in the city and moved to Long Island --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about forty years ago, [LAUGH] and I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have almost an acre and I wish I had about three times that size.
L:  That's pretty good, though --
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  -- for your area there probably, huh? [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Well, when I moved out here on Long Island, [SIGH] uh, it was basically potato farms. [SIGH] It wasn't built up.  Now, it's -- they're building --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- on every scrap of land. There's nothing -- [SIGH] no open land left, which is a -- a --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- shame. [LIPSMACK] But I enjoy living here and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- every [SIGH] -- I've already got my -- my seed catalogues out because spring will be here --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [LAUGH] and I'll be planting.
L:  Mm.
R:  It's getting harder and --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- harder for me to dig now, though. [SIGH] 
L:  Well, but, I guess, do what you can --
R:  Yeah, that's what --
L:  -- you know, uh --
R:  -- I do and now my gr- one grandson is twelve [SIGH] so I'm going to --
L:  Get him int-
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- interested.
R:  -- [LAUGH] uh, sucker him into digging for me.
L:  Yeah, well, that's you want to do, you know, spend that time --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- with them, and -- and share that with them, 'cause that's --
R:  Well, I learned to plant and everything [SIGH] from my grandfather [SIGH] by working --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- along side of him, [SIGH] so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I -- as I said, I think that's a good way to raise children.
L:  Yes, it is --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- yeah. [SIGH] I don't plant any garden, [SIGH] um, we have deer that come through here --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- where we are, and rabbits.
R:  Oh, well, you wouldn't --
L:  So --
R:  -- have any of that --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- lasting very long. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] No, I'd rather not feed them that way, so, um, and just with working it's too much to try to keep the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- weeds and everything out of it, and our soil is more sandy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I said I can stop at the, uh, farmers' markets and the different markets easier than I can try to keep the weeds out
R:  Yeah, sure.
L:  -- of the garden. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I -- I'm retired of course, so I had -- that's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my main [LAUGH] occupation, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] I do enjoy it, it gives me exercise, fresh air [SIGH] and [SIGH] it would be much cheaper for me to go to --
