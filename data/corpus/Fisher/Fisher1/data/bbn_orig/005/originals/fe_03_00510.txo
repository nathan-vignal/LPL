R:  Um, [MN]
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi there.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Nicole and I'm from Wisconsin. [NOISE]
L:  You're Ni- -- you're Nicole?
R:  From Wisconsin.
L:  From Wisconsin.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, I'm from [MN].  My name is Richard and I'm from Mississippi.
R:  Oh.
L:  Down in the deep south.  You're way up north in the cold country.
R:  Yeah, it's -- we -- 
L:  But it's gotten --
R:  It's cold but no snow.  [LAUGH]
L:  It's gotten cold here too and, of course, uh, they want to talk about illness and, of course, uh, the weather in this -- in this city changes a lot and people have a lot of -- there's a lot of allergies and related problems and -- and now the flu season's hit, kind of, here around where I live.
R:  Mhm.  I don't -- we have a lot of cold and flu going around here also.  I usually don't get sick when the weather changes --
L:  Really?
R:  -- because I work -- I work for a dentist so I -- I think it's because I'm exposed to a lot of germs.
L:  That's good.
R:  You know, a little amount of germs on a daily --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- basis so then it kind of builds an immunity.
L:  Mhm.  Well I've -- I've been fortunate this, uh, this winter so far.  I've been -- I started taking vitamins, uh, from, uh, a multivitamin from GNC.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, take, uh, a thousand milligrams of, uh, Estra[?] C, vitamin C.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so far, uh, you know, I hope [MN] I'm -- I'm gonna say, uh, subjectively I'm -- I'm through that that may be +happening but, uh, so far I've escaped, uh, any kind of sniffles or colds so far.
R:  Mhm.  I think a lot of it -- we've had a really mild winter here, this past week has been colder and today it was below zero. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  But this entire winter we've probably had [inaudible] of an inch of snow, which is really odd for here.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So I think of -- and up until three weeks ago had even into the sixties.
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  And so I think the mild winter has really helped a lot of us up here not to have a lot of colds either.
L:  Like -- that's what had happened -- it got sixty degrees here today and -- but, uh, we're kind of experiencing a lot of the, um, the, uh, the northern cold blast coming down here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I guess arctic blast where they're expecting, uh, nine degrees, uh, by Friday morning and twelve degrees, and that's pretty unusual.  That's pretty cold down deep south.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you know, the -- the weather fluctuating the way it is, it's going to make a lot of people sick. 
R:  [MN]
L:  You know warming up in the sixties and getting cold again.  And -- even the, uh, the ground is so cold in the at- -- the air -- the ambi- -- air is so warm the -- your concrete and your patio and all that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- is sweating.  
R:  Right.  [several inaudible words] cold.  [LAUGH]
L:  But, so far -- so I would -- I would think it, since you work for a dentist and you -- you are, uh, around a lot of people with germs and stuff like that, maybe it's helped your immune system.
R:  That's kind of --
L:  To, uh, to resist.
R:  -- how I'm thinking.  Before I started working in with healthcare --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I would get [MN] -- I do smoke and I would get bronchitis [NOISE] probably twice a year for sure.
L:  [MN]  Mhm.
R:  And I have -- I've had it once since I -- in two years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um ...
L:  Well, I used to take allergy shots.  I had it -- my family, uh, we do suffer from allergies.  Most people do around this area because we --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- have a -- we have a kind of a -- the humidity is so bad in the -- in the summertime and also we have a wet cold --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the wintertime, so allergies are pretty bad --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in this area.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The grass pollens, tree pollens and everything.  But mainly that's the, uh, as far as mainly that's what we suffer mostly from is, um, congestion, drainage and sneezing and eyes itching and stuff like that.
R:  Right.  So, what do you think about the cold lasting a week if you don't go to the doctor and seven days if you do?  Or vice versa, whichever way it was.
L:  Yeah.  Well, usually, uh, you know, we catch a cold usually, uh, we give it a day or two, you know, and but if you see that you're not getting better or worse then we probab- -- we go to the doctor.
R:  Yeah, I think, you know they were saying with a co- -- um, a cold is mostly a viral thing.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And there is no cure for a virus.
L:  That's true.
R:  So if --
L:  That's true.
R:  Unless there's a bac- -- you know like bronchitis is a bacterial thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which is why they can give you an antibiotic to kill the bacteria.
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  So ...
L:  That's -- that plagues us.
R:  Going to a doctor would help that.  [LAUGH]  But ...
L:  Uh, yeah.  We have, uh, we have -- we've been -- we've been plagued with bronchitis quite a -- I mean, well, I won't say a lot but we do, probably --I have, uh, four children and, uh, usually a couple of 'em -- my elder son, he suffers quite a bit with allergies and bronchitis.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, he -- he -- he takes, uh, quite a bit, uh, some medications that, um, maintain his drainings in his +respiratory system and everything like that.
R:  Mm.  Okay.  [MN]
L:  Are you talking on a cellphone?
R:  Yeah, I am, it --
L:  You are?  It sounded like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you're kind of breaking up a little bit and -- so I can't -- you can hear your voice come in waves.
R:  Sorry.  [LAUGH] [LIPSMACK] [MN]
L:  So they want to talk -- they want to talk to [SIGH] about illness and about going to the doctor?  Is that what I understood in?
R:  Mhm.  And I think we talked about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- illness and going to the doctor.  [LAUGH]  I don't --
L:  So far, uh, we haven't, uh, we haven't been to the doctor in a good while.  Most of my members of the family so far are, uh, thanking the good Lord, so we haven't been -- we haven't been ailing too much this winter.
R:  Mm.  I'm -- was ill this past summer, it was, but I haven't been at all [MN] this winter, yet.
L:  Yes.  Uh, I think I had a, uh -- I had a -- a physical done and my blood work showed up I have kind of elevated cholesterol a little, so I'm having to take some, uh -- my doctor talked me into taking some, uh, uh, cholesterol medicine.  What is that med-  [NOISE] -- Provocol.  Yeah.  So I've taken it for fourteen months so I'm fixing to go back and get my blood checked and see if -- see if my, uh, total cholesterol has gone down and my LDL.
R:  Mm.
L:  So I'm kind of concerned about that.
R:  Well, I hope everything works out.
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, thank you.  But, uh --
R:  Mm.
L:  It sounds like you working for a dentist you, uh, probably stay pretty busy?
R:  Um, I've -- we usually run from quarter to eight in the morning until about quarter to six at night.
L:  Good gracious.
R:  At work.  [LAUGH]
L:  Are you a hygienist?
R:  Um, I'm a dental assistant.  I'm the person that --
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  -- assists the doctor.
L:  You assist, okay.
R:  Or the dentist.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, I understand.
R:  Is this your fir- --
L:  And what's your --
R:  I'm sorry.  Is this your --
L:  I'm sorry, you --
R:  -- first call?
L:  Uh, yes it is.
R:  Okay.  
L:  Is this not -- is this your first?
R:  This is my first call too, so I'm just wondering --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- how long 
L:  It's --
R:  -- they want us to talk [LAUGH] or ... 
L:  Uh, my wife signed me up and she told me for ten minutes.  
R:  Okay.
L:  So, uh, you know, I don't know how s- you know, [NOISE].  Uh, I don't if it's -- she -- uh, my wife's just asking me is -- she doesn't know if -- if something's going to cut in and tell us we're through or whatever.  I don't know.
R:  That's what I'm --
L:  Or, uh ...
R:  -- wondering because --
L:  It's, uh --
R: -- I think we talked about our questions.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I was -- I was asking my wife, I know it's through Penn State University.
R:  R- right.
L:  You know.  And I was kind of wondering, uh, they said the language department?  Just what they --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- want and what they want in a study and what they're wanting to get out of this -- this studying by -- by getting -- getting, uh, people to talk to each other about a certain subject.
R:  I think some of it is, maybe, that they're studying how people, you know, I'm twenty and obviously you're older than me, that's why you [several inaudible words] four kids.
L:  Oh, you're -- you're twenty years old?
R:  Right.
L:  Well, uh, you got, uh, quite a unique, uh, accent.
R:  Oh, thanks.  [LAUGH]
L:  Are you a -- do I sound very southern?
R:  Yeah, I can tell that you're from the south.
L:  Can you tell?  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Um --
L:  [LAUGH]  Not quite as bad -- not quite as bad as some people in, uh, some people are pretty bad about southern --
R:  Mm.  Well --
L:  -- accents.
R:  -- my fiancee's, um, future brother in law is from Mississippi also. 
L:  Oh, is that right?
R:  So, I could -- I could kind of, you know, guess that it was around that area that you were from.
L:  Uh-huh.  You could --
R:  And --
L:  -- tell I was from the south?
R:  I could tell, yeah.  [LAUGH]  But --
L:  Well --
R:  -- I think one of their --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- purposes is that they want to see, you know, comparing someone from the north with someone from the south.  A male --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and a female and someone that's young and someone that's a little older --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- than them.  And seeing --
L:  Well, I --
R:  -- [inaudible] interact together.
L:  You said you're twenty.  So I'm, uh, I'm a good bit older than you.  I'm -- I'm forty eight.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I'm twenty -- I got twenty eight years on you.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  And so I think that's probably what --
L:  But I -- I -- I just, um, I just, uh, got off, uh, on graveyards and I get a long break.  I don't have to go back to work 'til Monday so I --
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  I get to do a little R. and R.
R:  Well, that sounds nice.
L:  Rest and relaxation.  
R: [MN]  My -- well, my normal day off is Wednesday, so I'm looking forward to that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Excuse me?
R:  My normal day off is tomorrow, so I'm --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- looking forward to that.
L:  Tomorrow?  Tomorrow's --
R:  Mhm.  Wednesday.
L:  Wednesday.  So you get Wednesday off?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, you -- do you -- go you get the weekend off?  Saturday and Sunday?
R:  One Saturday a month we work.
L:  Oh, one Saturday a month you work.  Okay.
R:  But only eight to noon.
L:  Well, we've, you know, I know we're not splo- supposed to, uh
