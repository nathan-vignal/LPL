L:  [LIPSMACK] Hi, my name is Zoe.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Hi, my name's Cal.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Hi.
R:  How are you doing tonight?
L:  I'm fine, how are you?
R:  Pretty good.
L:  I was almost asleep.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, I was just watching the evening news and watching the weather and [LIPSMACK] watching how nasty cold it is all around the country.
L:  Where are you at?
R:  In South Dakota.
L:  I'm in Atlanta, so it's not as bad.
R:  Oh, you're nice and warm down there, right?
L:  Yeah, we're only eight degrees down here.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah, we're -- we're above zero here, but not by much, I think it was about sixteen or eighteen degrees [LAUGH] is all. [SIGH] So --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it -- it's pretty -- pretty chilly.
L:  Yeah, I lived in cold places too. [SIGH] But right now I'm in Atlanta --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- outside of Atlanta.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, I mean we're -- I guess I was down there [SIGH] well, I guess that's a few years ago for some computer training at Marietta --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I remember I was so impressed by how green and lush and beautiful everything is down --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- around that Atlanta area.
L:  It's a lot different.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH] [SIGH] I thought, "Man, this -- this is nice".
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] I guess we're supposed to talk about our topic, I guess.
R:  Yes, uh, [SIGH] so, do you watch reality TV shows?
L:  Some, not a whole not, not lately.  I used to when they first came out, I guess.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I guess I'd have to [SIGH] honestly say I [SIGH] -- really, I guess, I don't think I've ever seen any of the versions of Survivor or -- or any of those.  I guess the closest I've come to reality TV shows, I watched some of the episodes of The Bachelor. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Thought that's kinda dumb. [LAUGH] 
L:  I haven't seen that much of it either, but, huh, I guess some people likes it.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, appa- apparently the TV ratings are high enough, apparently [NOISE] --
L:  Popular.
R:  -- there must be a lot of people like 'em.
L:  I think it's because they can relate, I guess, or --
R:  Could be.
L:  -- or somebody's being dirty or [SIGH] scheming or something.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  I guess the only ones I've kinda watched and used to kinda watch and enjoy, [SIGH] you know, when they used to have some of the -- the cop type ones, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they'd actually go along with the cops out on -- and do their drug busts and [SIGH] that kinda stuff.  Some of those were kinda -- kinda --
L:  Yeah, those are --
R:  -- interesting, but --
L:  -- good.  I like those better too.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Boy, I thought I was the only one that wasn't normal for a while.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  'Cause everybody liked them, and I'm like, "Well ..."  But I like the cop ones, yeah.
R:  Yeah, that kinda shows you, I guess, really, kinda some of the -- [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some of the bad stuff they have to put up with.  I think, "Boy, I'm glad I'm [LAUGH] not one of them". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] They put up with a lot, some of it.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  Especially in today's society.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, yes.
L:  Atlanta's bad. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I -- I think -- think it's pretty much [SIGH] -- pretty much universal any more.  It's, you know, I think it used to be the cops were respected, and [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- any more I guess they're -- they're the bad guys, they're -- they're spoiling our fun and [LIPSMACK] ...
L:  Well, some of them are down here are, like, jerks, but most of 'em are really good, they put up with a lot of stuff.
R:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I tell you I think -- I don't think I'd have the patience to -- to be a cop with some of the stuff they have to put up with, and ...
L:  No, me either, I couldn't do it, but I like to watch them shows.
R:  Yeah, they're -- they're -- they're -- they're fun.
L:  No, they're fast.
R:  So- some -- so- some of those chase scenes. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, there's a lot of 'em down here in Atlanta. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, [SIGH] I've -- I've -- I've often wondered about some of those [SIGH] chase scenes though, if they're -- if they're real or if they're staged for the -- the TV cameras 'cause some of 'em just [SIGH] seem almost more like a -- like a movie than --
L:  Yeah, they do. 
R:  -- you know, than --
L:  Makes you wonder some times.
R:  Uh-huh. [SIGH] [PAUSE]
L:  In fact, I was driving one day and one of the cops were chasing somebody who was driving all over.
R:  Oh, my. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] But that's the only one I've ever, you know, that -- mm yeah, some of them you -- it makes you wonder if they're staged.
R:  Yep. [SIGH] That's kind of scary, when you're out there driving and they're -- yeah, they're [LAUGH] chasing somebody. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] What time is it there?
R:  [SIGH] Oh, I've got, uh, nine -- nine twenty, nine twenty --
L:  It's eleven --
R:  -- five.
L:  -- something here.
R:  Ooh, that's right, you're on Eastern Standard Time, aren't you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, we're on -- we're on Mountain out here.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, I just --
L:  Does it get cold a lot out that way?
R:  [SIGH] Oh, [SIGH] normally not so bad, but boy th- th- this -- this winter we've had some -- [SIGH] some really cold weather.  In fact, I guess we, [SIGH] like last, you know last night, [SIGH] it got down below zero.  I think it's the first -- fist time this year that we've been below zero and [SIGH] it's weird 'cause it seemed like a -- a week ago we were in the -- [SIGH] in the [SIGH] sixties and [SIGH] you know, this week it's been cold and, I guess we're talking [SIGH] by Monday we're supposed to back up in the fifties again, but --
L:  This weather has been crazy all over the country.
R:  [LAUGH] Yes. [LAUGH] Yes, that -- that -- that's what you do is have a reality show about people --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- coping with the weather.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] It's even, uh -- it's even been cold down here for this part, it's not usually this cold.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I guess -- yeah, I guess on the news last night, they were talking that [SIGH] they said the only two states that -- that, uh, [SIGH] weren't below freezing or, uh -- were, uh, [MN] Hawaii and -- and, uh, Florida.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Like, man, forty eight states below freezing, that's --
L:  I know, that's unusual, usually. [PAUSE] 
R:  Exactly, I guess, you know, you think, uh -- I guess we always think of, like, you know, Georgia and down there, you know, as being nice and warm. [SIGH] 
L:  Mm.
R:  You don't think of it getting cold down there. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I think it was like [SIGH] twenty something this afternoon --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- and then it's down.  It doesn't really bug me because I lived in Colorado and New York and some places, Boston, it doesn't bug me too much, but since I've been down here I guess it does now. [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] Yes, I guess 'cause I think of the -- the high humidity and [SIGH] then it gets cold like that and [LAUGH] it seems --
L:  Well --
R:  -- a person would really feel it.
L:  It gets hot down here during the summer, but the last couple of summers have been cooler for Atlanta. [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Unbelievable.
R:  Yes. [SIGH] [LAUGH] Yeah, I remember when they had the Olympics down there, and, uh, didn't have water fountains at the Olympics, you had to buy bottled water.
L:  Mm.
R:  Uh, [SIGH] but that's kind of a [LAUGH] --
L:  Was you down here?
R:  Huh?
L:  I wasn't here then, but was you -- did you come down here, or --?
R:  Oh, no, I -- I had some friends who were down there.
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah, and they -- they -- they said they had -- had a pretty good racket going.  It was so hot you had to have something to drink and --
L:  Yeah, they said it was hot that year. [SIGH] 
R:  [LIPSMACK]  
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, my daughter was down there, ooh, I think [SIGH] three -- three years ago they had [SIGH] -- had an international, uh, Lutheran -- Lutheran youth gathering down there, so she went and -- and she -- she's a Coke collector, so she got to go to the big Coke museum down there --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and she was pretty -- pretty thrilled with that.  Yeah, in fact, I remember, I guess -- guess the year -- when I was down there, that was when they were [SIGH] -- were first bringing out [SIGH] cherry Coke and [SIGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and [SIGH] they had it on all the machines down there, and I tried one and thought, "Wow, this is good stuff".  And they said, "Yeah". That was apparently -- that was one of the test markets to, you know, see how it went over and it wasn't long after that that it went nationwide and turned out to be a big -- [SIGH] big seller for Coke, but ...
L:  Mm.
R:  [SIGH] So, how long are we supposed to keep talking?
L:  I don't know, for ten minutes, isn't it?
R:  Oh, is it ten minutes, okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  I wonder how long we've talking, I'm about, like, half asleep, I'm probably boring to you.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, I j- I j- v- [MN] I think -- think you're doing great so far. [LAUGH] 
L:  Things we do to talk about money, I guess. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh.
L:  This is kinda neat, though.
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, ima- imagine getting -- getting paid for talking to -- talking to strangers.  Get -- get to meet some new people, maybe. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Reality TV, though. I just not into that so much, 'cept like you, the cop shows, I like watching that.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, 'cause I used -- used to have a -- have one of those -- used to come on here like -- like every [SIGH] -- every night after the news, it was called Cops --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and seemed like they had a little bit of everything.  They'd have, you know, like, the drug enforcement officers, you know, with their -- their battering rams, you know, and break down a door, you know, get in on a -- on the [SIGH] drug people and they'd [SIGH] all -- I guess there were all different kinds of arrests and stuff, and [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- some of it you really kind of felt sorry for the -- for the people and, like -- like -- and I watched an episode one night, [LIPSMACK] the poor guy was [SIGH] -- was so just drunk, so bombed out of his mind [SIGH] that, uh, he couldn't even stand up, couldn't hardly even -- even talk and, [SIGH] you know, here they were drunk, you know, he was -- [LAUGH] he was driving. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, and so they busted him and, you know, the cops were not, you know, just real happy with him being in that state and being out there in a car and --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I say, "Yes, I am glad I'm [LAUGH] -- I'm not out on the same road with that joker", but --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but still you kind of felt sorry for him, because the guy was so pathetic that just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  And yeah, Atlanta's usually on 'em, too. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [LIPSMACK] 
R:  [SIGH] [LAUGH] Oh, heck the other reality shows I guess [SIGH] -- well, how was that one -- they had that one that was [SIGH] -- didn't they have one on a cruise ship, or something?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, yeah, I think I remember that, though I can't remember --
R:  Like, I've seen -- seen commercials for it and [SIGH] I think we've had, what, Survivor one, two, and, I don't know what version of Survivor [SIGH] they're --
L:  Oh, I think --
R:  -- up to by now.
L:  -- they've had three or four.  I don't know, this is too long to watch.  They had that Big Brother, I never really watched it either.
R:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] And then that -- and now it's only -- they're advertising one now, uh, it's a celebrity Survivor, apparently they got [SIGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- a bunch, uh, of, uh, [SIGH] TV or movie stars or something that they're [SIGH] throwing out on an island to see how they do.
L:  That one could actually be interesting, maybe --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- seeing how long they last.  I'd probably get bored with it after a couple of shows, but --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- that one might actually be [LAUGH] worth it.
R:  [SIGH] [LAUGH] Yeah, 'cause I guess, actually, the closest thing that some kind of reality shows that it was kind of fun to watch was, you know, Who Wants to be a Millionaire, that's kind of fun, but -- I don't know if they consider --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that a reality show or not.
L:  [SIGH] I haven't seen that come on lately, except during the day time, the daily one now.
R:  [SIGH] That's right, they are having the -- who's -- who's the hostess they've got on that too, she -- she seems like she was pretty nice.
L:  Oh, I can't think of her name.  Meredith?  No, I can't think what her name is.
R:  Yeah, I know, she -- she -- it seems like she does a really good job of, you know, kind of get-
