L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Hi.
R:  [LAUGH] Hi. Um, gosh, I'm -- I'm Michelle and I'm in Virginia.
L:  Hi, my name is Rae, I'm in Maryland.
R:  [SIGH] So --
L:  Oh -- yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] This is kinda weird.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Uh, [MN] so, I guess, I mean I've watched a couple of them, like Survivor.
L:  Mhm, [LIPSMACK] uh --
R:  Uh --
L:  I -- I watched Survivor in the first season, but, um, I didn't watch it too much after that.
R:  It got pretty stupid after that. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, it's like a train wreck, you have to watch.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You have to watch, you can't turn away once --
L:  You --
R:  -- once you have it on, you have -- you have to watch it.
L:  Yeah, yeah, oh -- [LAUGH] [SIGH] 
R:  Um, did you watch any other ones?
L:  Uh-huh, I watch, um, [LIPSMACK] I was watching --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- The, um, Great Race. [SIGH] It -- it was a show about a race.
R:  Yeah, I've seen that one in the past, I never really got into it too much.
L:  Yeah, no, see I liked that one because, um, me and my son w- watched that together.  The Amazing Race, that's the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- name of it. [SIGH] And that was pretty fun [LIPSMACK] because --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- if you missed the show you could always catch up on it.
R:  Right.
L:  And then, lately, like, this week, we've been watching, um --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- American Idol Show.
R:  I was going to watch that, I missed it.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] because it's so funny at the beginning when everybody's trying to audition and [SIGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] -- and a lot of people just can't sing. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah --
L:  [SIGH] And --
R:  -- I saw the previews. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know -- personally, I don't want to get on the wrong side of Simon.  Uh -- [SIGH] 
L:  Mm, no.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Not at all. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I could see me standing out there and he's telling me my singing was hideous. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] And I would not be very happy. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, if I want to be +humility -- humiliated, I can find another way.
L: Yes [LAUGH] exactly. [LAUGH] 
R:  D- do you ever watch, um, oh, what the heck is the name of it?  Fear Factor?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I love Fear Factor. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] I have to turn away sometimes, though, in the eating stuff.
L:  Yeah, I don't see how they can do that.  Now, I mean [MN] I like money as much as the next person, but some of that stuff they get asked to do, I don't think I could do [NOISE] it. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Some of the things they have to eat is just nasty. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's just totally gross.  The last time I watched, they were eating the ostrich eggs.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, yes, it's nasty.
R:  In a big huge glass.
L:  Yes, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ooh, it was nasty, and the -- and the bugs they have to eat, and they'd be crunchy and still --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- alive, and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I'm like, "No [LAUGH] way".
R:  [LAUGH] Squirt. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I -- I don't know -- I don't know about you, I -- like, I guess [MN] it's kind of like a vicarious thrill watching to see how bad somebody wants money, huh?
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I think that's why a lot of people watch it, because it's just, like, everyday people on these shows and [SIGH] you know, they're not big movie stars and maybe just the general public can, um, relate better to that, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  Because I can imagine myself on some of those shows, but --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I don't think I could actually do it, but --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- I could imagine myself there.
R:  Yeah, I can imagine myself the first day.  After the first day I'm it -- that's it.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's right.  You know, [LAUGH] go. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I keep telling myself, "Well, maybe I'll do that, I can get some money for my kids, and ..."
L:  Yeah, I think that too.
R:  Or not. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Luckily --
L:  Lots of them --
R:  -- I don't qualify for the bachelor shows.
L:  [LAUGH] No, me either.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] those drive me crazy, I love to watch them just to watch people make total idiots out of themselves.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know if I w- would want be on TV choosing my husband, you know?
R:  [SIGH] No, no.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I think the -- when -- the funniest was also one of the -- probably the dumbest is that, um, Joe Millionaire one.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Have you -- have you seen that one at all?
L:  Uh-uh, uh-uh. 
R:  [SIGH] I watched half of one show.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Number one I don't think -- I don't think he's all that anyway, but, um, I don't think he's all that great.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, um, he j- I watched it, and these women on there just, I don't know, I mean --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it- it's kind of a sign of desperation when you go that far.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] I think so too, I really do.  I mean, who's that desperate that [SIGH] I mean, what happened to the old-fashioned way of finding an -- a -- a -- a husband or a wife. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Well, th- these people don't want the husband, they want the money that goes along --
L:  The money --
R:  -- with him.
L:  -- yeah.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] I would do Millionaire, yeah, but I -- I thought the catch of the show was he's --
R:  He -- he --
L:  -- not a millionaire.
R:  [SIGH] Exactly, that is the catch. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  He's actually -- he actually grew right up rou- round here, where I'm at.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  And, uh, I don't know anything about him more than what -- what I've seen just on TV --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the ve- you know, few chances I've seen him, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I know he grew up around here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He went to high school around here and everything.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] I remember on the internet somebody was saying that they saw his mother in the bank or something. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, it's partly -- it -- I don't know, I think his family still -- I don't know if his family still lives here or not.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know, I don't -- I don't keep up with that. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] No, uh-uh, uh-uh.  Too much --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- other stuff to do. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, well the only ones I really like though is I like Survivor --
L:  Mm. 
R:  -- I like [MN] sometimes, I mean, some -- it -- [SIGH] it's -- it can be a totally stupid -- and the people that are winning, it drives me crazy because he just -- you can see what's happening --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and, um, Amazing Race is pretty neat because you -- I think that's probably one of the more real ones --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because people just argue, the couples just argue, they don't c- after a while they don't care if they're on TV or not --
L:  Right --
R:  -- they're just going --
L:  -- they sure do.
R:  -- to let it all hang out. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, they do, yeah, but they have to work together if they really want to win.
R:  Right, by the time they've --
L:  It is really good.
R:  -- gotten to the third part they -- they don't care anymore if they're on TV, they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- don't care who's watching --
L:  No.
R:  -- they're going to let the other partner have it whether they like [LAUGH] --
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- it or not. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, that's exactly right. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] I think that one would be fun.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  There's no way I'd go and do it --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but I think it would be fun.
L:  I don't think I'm physically fit enough to do any of those shows. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I m- I might be able to handle some type of, uh, [SIGH] brain part, but that's about it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  The logistics, there we go.
L:  Right, right. [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't even know what other ones there are out, there's so many now.
L:  Mhm. [SIGH] There's just too many of them.  I know they have one, I think it's on Fox, where [SIGH] they have a l- lot of cele- celebrities from, um, a while ago, all living in one house.  I think that one's --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- over.
R:  -- is that like a Big Brother Celebrity House or something?
L:  Yeah, tha- it was like that, yeah.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  All those egos in one place, that's a lot.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it sure was.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] But I missed --
R:  No, I've -- I've never ever --
L:  -- that one.
R:  -- seen that one.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  [COUGH] I wonder how long we're supposed to talk about this.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I read online that, um, it's supposed to be fifteen minutes --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and after the fifteen minutes is up, a recording will come and let you know.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [COUGH] And they said it would be best to wait for the recording, 'cause then that way you know that you, um, talked long enough.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I was talking to somebody o- online last night, and she did hers last night on something else and, uh, she was off the phone like in five minutes or something.
L:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK] Oh, yeah.
R:  So, [SIGH] I guess they try to keep it geographically together.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I was on hold for a good ten minutes --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- while I was waiting.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow, 'cause I wasn't on hold that long and actually this is my first time.  I just signed up earlier -- I signed up this morning, actually.
R:  I did it late last night.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] 'Cause she was telling me about it and --
L:  Yeah, everybody online was talking about it at some of the sites that I go -- some of --
R:  Where do you go?
L:  -- the free sites.
R:  Hey, well, this is not what we're supposed to be talking about, is it?
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  Where do you -- where did you find out about it? [LAUGH] 
L:  On -- on a free sample site.
R:  Which one?
L:  Big, big savings.
R:  Yes, that's where I got it too.
L:  Me too, [LAUGH] yeah.  I go there every day.
R:  Are you a member on there?
L:  Yes.
R:  Which one?
L:  But I don't post that much, I'm Esoteric. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  But I rarely, rarely post.
R:  Yeah, I don't remember seeing your user name, because I'm on there all the time.
L:  No, what's your name?
R:  Me Woman.
L:  Me Woman?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah --
R:  I'm on there all the time.
L:  -- I think I might have seen your name before, ac-
R:  Go into chat, it's fun.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  It can get dangerous sometimes, but it's fun.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  It's not so bad, it's not like the other chats, like Yahoo and all that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's pretty -- pretty -- real well regulated in there.
L:  Yeah, it is, it is, yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Anyway, that's not what we were supposed to be talking about. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But that's where I found out about it.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, me too, same place.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Anyway, let's see, what else, um --
L:  Let me see, I don't know any other more reality shows.  Um, I don't [SIGH] let's see, we talked about --
R:  We got Big Brother --
L:  Fear Factor, yeah.
R:  -- that one was funny.
L:  Yeah, that was good, that was funny, yeah.
R:  But, um, I kind of -- I k- I kind of think, "You know, I could do that".
L:  Mhm.
R:  "I can -- I can do that".  I would probably end up telling somebody off with- withi- within --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- two days, though.
L:  Yeah, but I probably could be best at that too, [SIGH] because I could be in a houseful of people and just not even notice --
R:  [SIGH] Just as though you're there --
L:  -- they're there.
R:  -- on your own.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  I just grab my books and say, "The heck with everybody --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- else".
L:  Yeah, I could do the same thing.  Act like I'm there all by myself. [LAUGH] 
R:  But the thing is that they -- you can't do that, though --
L:  Mm, mm.
R:  -- because they won't -- they won't let you do --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- people get upset when you --
L:  They would just --
R:  -- do that.
L:  -- vote you out. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, "Why -- why she's keeping to herself, she thinks that she's better than us".
L:  Right.
R:  "No, I just don't feeling like dealing with you --"
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  "-- leave me alone". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] See --
R:  "If I can tune out --"
L:  -- second life for me.
R:  "-- my kids, I can tune you out too". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you sound just like me. [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't have the patience for the stupidity, I think that's -- that's the problem, there's no way I could do it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I would -- I would go off on somebody --
L:  Yeah.  I would t-
R:  -- it -- it would take -- it wouldn't take me long at all.
L:  Yeah, 'cause some people act so [MN] -- you just have to say, "What is wrong with them?" [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] Mhm.  [SIGH] That's like this --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- last Survivor, you know, I -- I watched this last one.  I didn't watch -- I don't think I watched the one before --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I watched this last one, and I'm just looking at these people thinking, you know --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [SIGH] "You get on p- on TV and you act totally stupid --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- and you say you're not like this in real life, so --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- why are you acting like that now?"
L:  On TV, right, and it's not like they don't know they're on TV, you'd think they would try to act a little more civilized. [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  I mean, it -- I -- I -- I -- I don't know, I mean, I g- I g- I guess after a while you tend to forget, but at the same time, if you tend to forget and you keep [SIGH] telling everybody you're not like this all the time, you're --
L:  Mm, right.
R:  -- not like this at home, you're not like this at home --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- well, "Why are you different on the island?"
L:  Right, and it kinda makes it kind of hard to believe. [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly, exactly.  You know, [MN] you have wonder, "Okay, well, you're like this consistently on the island --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- you're g- like you're a jerk to everybody consistently on the island, and you're --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- selling -- tr- trying to sell us this story[?] good --"
L:  Mm. [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- that you're sweetness --"
