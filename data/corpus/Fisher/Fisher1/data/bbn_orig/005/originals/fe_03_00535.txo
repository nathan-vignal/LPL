L:  Hey, how are you?
R:  Hi, this is Lisa.
L:  Hey, I'm Bevan, how're you doin'?
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] Good. [SIGH] That's a interesting topic.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Which is worse?
R:  Ah, yeah, hard to say.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, well, I guess you got to think of some of the possibilities that, you know, [NOISE] you -- you look at, [NOISE] um, if you want to say what's worse, you need to look at what the, um, effects of it are. [SIGH] Um, what did it say?  It said gossiping --
R:  Smoking.
L:   -- overindul- smoking, drinking.
R:  Overindulgence. [SIGH] 
L:  Overindulgence.
R:  And non-exercising.
L:  Okay.  I think they're -- to me they're all bad, but the reason why --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I would say that gossiping is worse --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is that, for the most part, gossiping -- it hurts other people.  That's what I would say. [SIGH] if you look at like, um, smoking, [LIPSMACK] you're hurting yourself.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, there is the -- there is the effect of secondhand smoke, [SIGH] but still, that's -- that's a conscious choice that you're making, you know?  Overeating's the same, drinking alcohol, the same.  Gossiping, um, you're taking someone else.
R:  [SIGH] That's true, you're right.
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  Does that mean you smoke and drink?
L:  Me?  No, I do neither.
R:  Well, good for you.
L:  Thanks.  Do you?
R:  Yes. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.
R:  I don't gossip, though. [SIGH] 
L:  Hey, good stuff.
R:  Because it is -- 
L:  [SIGH] [MN] 
R:  -- it's bad, people get hurt. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, is -- is that what y- is that what you would think, or would you ?  I mean, I know there's some people who [SIGH] they s- they smoke and drink and they say i- it's wrong but it's a habit.  What's your opinion on that?
R:  [SIGH] Well, um, it is bad, um, as -- I don't know about you, but I'm in Florida -- [SIGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we just passed a thing that you can't smoke in bars or restaurants --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and, uh, that's all fine and well, but they're --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- starting to suffer [SIGH] the consequences.  People don't go out as much.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] So, I have been meaning to look up and see what -- what happened in California, you know, they did that --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- a few years ago. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] They did that in -- I'm -- I'm in South Carolina now, but I'm originally from Minnesota   And Minnesota they did that -- they had, I think it was only after a -- either -- either -- I think it was like after certain hours they could smoke, or something like that.  And I don't -- I don't know what the long term effects are.  My brothers -- both my brothers smoke, and I know that my brother, once upon a time, he said he would only go to B- he wouldn't go to McDonalds, but he would only go to Burger King, because Burger King still -- or Hardee's, because Hardee's still had a smoking section then.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So, they -- they lost my brother, but that's -- see, in -- in the long term, I don't know.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, see, restaurants, I don't have a problem with restaurants at all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, because I agree, if I was eating and I didn't smoke, I wouldn't want to smell it. [SIGH] 
L:  Aha.
R:  The bar thing is kind of different.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Y- You know, and the two do --
L:  They've made it illegal to smoke in bars?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  Unless they don't serve food. [SIGH] Well, [MN] then that creates other problems, then you have a bunch of people who don't eat and they're partying all night, y-
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  That's not kind of -- yeah, that's not maybe the situation most people, or some people --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- want to be in.
R:  Right.
L:  Is that what you're saying?  Uh, okay.
R:  So, you know, it -- it ought to be like separate --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- but equal, kind of thing.
L:  Yeah, I kind of -- you know, like, I never dreamed that I would -- I would -- I'm n- I don't -- I don't go to bars, but I -- I would kind of think, you know, that, like, goes together in the fact that, you know, if you want to get together after, you know, a hard day's [SIGH] work, you know, you get together with a couple of friends and you go -- you get like a whole -- a scotch and a cigar or something, but um, um, and not just that, but that -- that might show my, ah, inexperience in the area, but, um --
R:  [SIGH] No, no, you're right, though, 'cause the way it is now, [SIGH] you just kind of being -- ev- every place has a different rule, whether you tip up the barstool and you go out front --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- or -- or, you know, they have little placards that you put down.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] It's really bizarre, because most of the places, out front, [LAUGH] you know, what's wrong with this picture?
L:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH] Well, here's a question for you to think about, uh, tell me what you think?  I went to, um -- I'm actually a grad student [LIPSMACK] and I went to -- I'm studying Russian, and I went to -- it's kind of like a Russian club or place to go and just practise your Russian in the evenings.
R:  Okay.
L:  And it's -- it's at a coffee shop.  So, I went to the coffee shop and I laid my coat down on the -- it was actually on the table.  We were sitting at a bunch of different tables.  Well, they all wanted to come to this one bigger table so we could sit around and talk for a little bit.
R: Okay. 
L:  So, I set my coat down on the table, and then everything -- I was there for an hour.  I got up, I took my coat and I walked to the library and I smelled cigarette smoke and I thought, you know, "Someone's smoking in the library or something".  I said, "How can that be?"  Or someone really -- someone who smokes a lot has been in -- 'cause it was really strong.  It wasn't like, you know, y- you, kind of, sometimes you think, "Oh, someone's smoking".  Um, but it w- it was really strong and then I [MN] ah, I don't know what I did, but I caught like, a whiff when I raised up my arm to get a book or something, I smelled my coat, [SIGH] and it was my coat.  And the reason it was so strong is that it was so close to me.  Um, so, do you think that's an issue?  Like, do people who ?
R:  Well, I bet that happens a lot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I really do.
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  And --
L:  I'm j- I'm just curious what you're thinking.
R:  Yeah --
L:  Um.
R:  No, um, and I -- I bet that happens a lot, and I feel [SIGH] equally as bad for the people who don't smoke and go home smelling like smoke, as people who do smoke and -- but still want to go out and have a good time or go --
L:  Okay, yeah.
R:  [COUGH] 'Cause in -- in my group of friends -- 
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- I'm the only one that smokes. [SIGH] 
L:  Okay.
R:  So, we go to lunch, it's always, you know -- and used to be you go to a non-smoking and I would always do it outside and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, however that worked.  And I am very conscious of -- I'm almost fanatical and knock the head off.  I will not throw the butt on the ground, [SIGH] um --
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah, that's wrong.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] And, um, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] but, you know, it -- you -- sometimes you just gotta -- [LAUGH] especially if you're -- you're drinking, you're out and you're social, you're [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but there ought to be equal  you can go here, you can go there and not just the flat --
L:  Right.
R:   -- you can't do it anywhere. [SIGH] 
L:  Right. [LIPSMACK] 
R:  But [MN] --
L:  I almost kind of think that [COUGH] maybe -- well, I don't know if it would really make sense, I'm trying to think -- I was thinking about, you know, if you make, like, certain, uh, stipulations where you said, "Okay, here we -- that this restaurant i- restaurant or the bar can decide --"
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- if they're allowed or not and then they just realise, "Okay, if you don't like smoke, then don't go there".  But then, that's going to create a problem because then you're going to have restaurants who are going to cater to either one or the other and then [SIGH] that might cause --
R:  Right, but that also would work on supply and demand, right? [SIGH] If you're a smoking restaurant and people don't go, then, "Wait a minute". [LAUGH] Real quick --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're going to go to non-smoking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] So, it's really hard to say.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, um, but you're very right about the gossip, that's very bad.
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] that was -- that's what I was thinking, just -- I just, you know, spur of the moment like.
R:  And, uh --
L:  Not, uh --
R:  Not exercising is pretty bad too. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, as a grad student, do you have time for that?
L:  Exercise?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I do, but not as much as I -- like when I was an -- I was an undergrad, um, I -- I was able to work out six days a week and I loved it.  Um  and I loved it 'cause you -- you know, you feel great, [SIGH] you, uh -- I wake up in the -- I w- I would wake up in the morning, you know, like five thirty or six and I felt wide awake [SIGH] and then, you know, when I got sick, I was only sick -- instead of sick -- being sick for a -- a week or two weeks, I was sick for, like, two days, or something and I got better.  It wasn't as bad.  But now I guess grad school -- um, last semester I got in for three days a week, but it was only for like twenty minutes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but, on the other hand, part of it is I don't overindulge, um, and I don't, uh, uh, I have a high metabolism --
R:  [MN] Oh --
L:  -- so --
R:  -- well, you're lucky that way then.
L:  Um, yeah, yeah. [SIGH] But I also, like, I don't have, you know, I -- I don't have tons of junk food or candies.  It's not kinda like I overindulge.  I'm really kind of on the opposite, I'm kind of starving. [SIGH] I, uh, live on Rama[?] noodles and macaroni and cheese.
R:  [LAUGH] Is that really true?  That college kids --
L:  Um.
R:  -- do that?
L:  For -- for me -- for me it is, just because, um, I -- I have a graduate assistantship --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, [SIGH] uh, I don't have a student loan, I really don't want a student loan, um, just because I'd rather get time just to be able to get into the work field and, [SIGH] um, without paying things off and having that over me.  I plan on getting married next summer, and I don't want to, [SIGH] you know, have that to worry about too, [SIGH] and, because of that, [COUGH] um, when they take the tuition out of my check, I get paid a hundred bucks a month --
R:  No way.
L:  -- which --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Which is tough when you consider the fact that, um, you know, I've got rent, which is -- I have dirt cheap rent.  I'm living in a laundry room and I'm paying a hundred and fifty bucks a month.  So, already I'm fifty bucks short. [SIGH] I've also got gas, also I got, you know, food and -- I have to work on Saturdays, like, doing yard work and stuff.
R:  [SIGH] Wow.
L:  Um, so -- so right, so it's not like I'm overindulging, and I can't, you know, go out and buy a box of chocolates or a twelve pack of, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- coke or something and just go at it, but --
R:  But, wow.
L:  Even if I could I wouldn't, but that -- see, that's -- see, part of that's personality, like --
