R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Hi, I'm Marla.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I'm Jenny, how are you doing?
R:  Fine. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Have you done this before?
R:  No, this is my first time, how about you?
L:  Oh, this is the second call I've got.
R:  Really?
L:  Now, let me tell you first that supposedly [SIGH] I -- I think I screwed up on the last one 'cause I've heard that you're supposed to talk until they tell you to stop.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, it's about ten minutes.
R:  Okay, well, I guess we can start talking, they want us to talk about --
L:  Iraq.
R:  Right, if we -- if we think, uh, what our thoughts are about -- if we think that --
L:  Should be disarmed.
R:  Right. [SIGH] Well, [LAUGH] --
L:  Or do you think it's a priority, or not?
R:  [SIGH] Um, I do, [SIGH] uh, but it's so hard to know what to think and believe, because you're -- we're -- I mean, I feel we're hearing all these different sides, and [SIGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I don't know [SIGH] how much has been filtered out by politics and [SIGH] -- and things like that.
L:  [SIGH] Well, yeah, I'm worried too that George is pushing too hard, [SIGH] that, um, I think he should wait for the inspectors to do their job for a l- you know, a little while at least, they --
R:  I definitely --
L:  -- haven't been over there that long.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I definitely think that. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] And he's like, "Let's go, let's go now" and the whole world is not behind him on this.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, [SIGH] I think he should wait because, um, [SIGH] um, things like this take time, in other words it -- and plus, even if -- I feel if they are resisting [SIGH] that if they push slowly and give them time, [SIGH] you know, until they are at the very last straw.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, patience is important.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, well, I don't think we should attack them [SIGH] unless they have a UN sanction, because then that makes you no better than they are.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, not only that [SIGH] but if we attack too soon without other countries --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] uh, that --
L:  That's why he needs a UN sanction.
R:  Y- yeah, that's just too risky because [SIGH] if we wait long enough until we get more evidence, probably [SIGH] the important countries, they'll be convinced --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but if they don't --
L:  We have got to give them a chance --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you keep pushing like this -- it's like he's Mr Texas Highshow here, he wants to run off and, you know, shoot from the hip and everybody wants to just wait and give the inspectors a chance.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, [SIGH] uh, yeah, I agree with that.  I think that, um, [SIGH] the, you know, [SIGH] w- time really isn't not on our side because it's not like [SIGH] you know, they're threatening or have done something, you know, so [SIGH] it just seems -- I agree about hurrying, [SIGH] um, because we are talking about human lives.  My son is seventeen --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] he's going to be eighteen in May, [SIGH] so, of course, that's going to bother me.
L:  He's going to have to [MN] sign up for the selective service.
R:  Probably and I even heard --
L:  Well, that's a lie, he has to sign up.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I heard something about -- I thought the draft wasn't even --
L:  No, there is no draft at this time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but you have to register if you're a man.
R:  Oh, is that what it is?
L:  Yeah, at least that's what it always was.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
L:  [SIGH] On your eighteenth --
R:  But --
L:  -- birthday.  Unless they've changed the law, it was always --
R:  [SIGH] Well, no, that might --
L:  -- you had to -- you had to register --
R:  -- that might be, and so --
L:  -- because my niece is in the national guard right now --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and when nine eleven happened [SIGH] she had just started her first year at college, three weeks later she's down New York City, working on the pile and guarding the dang city.
R:  Really?
L:  Her entire first year of college was awash.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  She was down the entire year.
R:  [SIGH] Well, yeah, and, like, I think that if we get -- it's kind of like a court, um, [SIGH] a court thing.  You know how the -- all the evidence needs to be out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and [MN] he seems to have part of it, [SIGH] but --
L:  He's too much of a rush.
R:  Yeah, too much of a rush, and --
L:  If he lets those inspectors do their job, I mean, there's only so many places they can hide the stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and if they keep pushing and pushing, they're eventually going to catch him.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, right, and the --
L:  They can only keep moving it so much.
R:  Right, and there's a chance the longer they push him, [SIGH] you know, it -- th- there's a chance they may change their mind and realise, "Okay [SIGH] you know, when other countries hear this and they've given us opportunity after opportunity --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- there's a chance we may not even have to go to war". [SIGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  If they do -- you know, change their mind as far as giving in because they real- -- and, as we know, the more countries that join, the more likely they are to not want to go to war 'cause they'll realise that they're just so outnumbered it's ridiculous.
L:  I know, but it might reach a point where, [SIGH] I don't know, because the stuff they have can be carried around in tanker trucks, and one tanker truck [LIPSMACK] is enough to kill half the damn state --
R:  [LIPSMACK] The --
L:  -- or half the country, like anthrax.  One tanker truck of anthrax could kill half the world --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it's not hard to hide a tanker truck, unfortunately.
R:  [SIGH] Well, you know, what I'm wondering is you're saying that Iraqis are [SIGH] hiding it by -- by driving it around?
L:  Yes.
R:  Well, what I don't understand is this: w- like [SIGH] if we send a whole bunch of people over there, you know, twenty four hours a day, [SIGH] the country's not that huge, it's not like, you know, the United States [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or anything --
L:  This is true.
R:  -- [SIGH] why couldn't they keep a watch on every tanker truck there is?
L:  Well, then you're talking thousands of people, not just the few dozen that's over there.
R:  [SIGH] W- yeah, well, here's the thing, [SIGH] um, if you think of it technically, it's either a thousand -- thousands of people go over or we risk hundreds of thousands in war.
L:  [SIGH] Well, see that -- 
R:  You know.
L:  -- that's -- that's an option, but the problem with that is well, they have accepted a few dozen, maybe a couple of hundred, will they accept a thousand foreigners poking about their country, making 'em show their papers, "What's the hell's in your truck?" [SIGH] They might not accept that and then if they refuse to accept that, what do you do, go kick their butts?
R:  [SIGH] Well, yeah, if we do that, then we'd have to have war.  Where -- I agree we're putting ourselves in a corner, unless they tried to sl- you know, [LAUGH] slowly bring in -- you know what I'm saying, I mean [SIGH] of course, that's -- we don't know all the details, but, right, if you did, like, a thousand over there, but unless they, you know, try to push him slowly, like, "Well, you know, we're going to have to bring a hundred more over" you know, and I don't know they'd go to war on that, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, you're right, the minute they said, "No more" [SIGH] you know, people over, they'd have to -- there'd be another step --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, but th- you know, then they'd have to do even more [SIGH] but, you know, it just --
L:  Yeah, where's the last step?  That's the problem.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, yeah, but I basically -- I think over all, when you have the majority of Americans, the majority of the world not really agreeing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with you yet [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Then it's a mistake, definitely.
R:  -- then it- it's got to be, and Bush [MN] sounds a little deluded.
L:  Yeah, you can't go off on your high horse and -- [SIGH] I mean, yeah, he's the president and yeah he's supposedly going to do what's right for the country, but sometimes I get the feeling that he's just trying to make up for his father's mistake in not kicking the guy's ass and finishing off in the first place.
R:  [SIGH] Well, that's true, uh, that could be true, and also, [SIGH] um --
L:  Or the supposed plot to kill his father.  Is he, like; just after revenge?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, you know, that -- that's a thought, but, I don't know, it's just it seems that of course the people whose family's lives are going to be concerned --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but [SIGH] you know, it -- he doesn't seem to care about that, he almost seems a little bit immature [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- um, and --
L:  Yeah, he's -- yeah, he's just like a little boy, gotta -- gotta do it now.
R:  Yeah, and, you know, some people even thought at first that he might have been doing it to secure the next election, [SIGH] you know?
L:  Well, except for his popularity's dropping, [MN] I mean, right --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- after nine eleven it was supposedly at ninety percent --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] but the only reason it was at ninety percent was because of nine eleven and [MN] everybody in the country was, like, one solid unit, them against -- you know, us against them.
R:  Yeah, you have to do that.
L:  -- and, uh, now he's down to, [LIPSMACK] I think I read in the paper this morning, fifty nine percent, which is still abnormally high for somebody in his position at --
R:  But it --
L:  -- this time --
R:  -- but it's dropping --
L:  -- of his presidency --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] but it is slowly dropping.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  But, I mean, he -- if he screws us up, he won't get elected again --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- but he's also ignoring the economy.
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] oh, [LAUGH] hell.
L:  I mean, it's like he's trying to draw away the attention away from it, it's like, "We're not stupid, this isn't working".
R:  [SIGH] Well, yeah, it -- you know, [MN] when you said that it brought a thought, you're right. [SIGH] It -- if he is doing it to distract the economy, [SIGH] we aren't that dumb, [SIGH] I mean, [LAUGH] you know, Americans, we're not going to be that easily distracted, [SIGH] and it -- it -- it's like he -- maybe he thinks we're that dumb, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, he does have some people for this, far as -- I mean, for people that aren't -- don't agree with him because of [SIGH] the -- he j- still does have that high fif- that fifty nine percent, [SIGH] but, um, that's an interesting thought, that he might [LAUGH] be doing it to distract from the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- economy, [SIGH] but he might get himself in a worse mess.
L:  Yeah, well, yeah, war used to be a great fixer of the economy, go to war, everybody's got jobs, lots of money, all this manufacturing going on to support the war effort, [SIGH] but war isn't the same as it used to be.  Now it's all falling from a plane, planes cost, you know, how many freaking millions and billions of dollars each?
R:  [SIGH] That's true.
L:  Every one of those freaking rockets cost a million dollars, they're talking like, what, thirty billion dollars if they have to fight this war?
R:  Yeah, it's totally different now.
L:  Yeah, it's not the same thing at all.
R:  Yeah, and our --
L:  And then he's doing all these stupid tax cuts.  I think what the hell is with that?  I'd rather pay [SIGH] uh, my extra two hundred -- I mean, I just noticed my pay check [SIGH] went up two dollars, so I went and checked it out, and like, oh, federal tax rate went down, that's stupid. [SIGH] so, I'm getting an extra two dollars a week.  Whoa, that's a hundred and four dollars a year, I'd rather the government keep it along with two hundred other million people's hundred and four dollars a week, [SIGH] and pay off the national debt.  This is -- I mean, they're saying they have a surplus, [SIGH] they have no surplus.  If you have a hell of a debt selector, you have no surplus.
R:  That's true.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  It's like telling your credit card company, "I'm sorry, I have a surplus this week, but you don't count, you don't get any of the money".
R:  [SIGH] Well, you know, because of that, that's why a lot of the middle class -- right, the chunk out of the middle Americans [SIGH] aren't really as much behind Bush, and of course, we know that [SIGH] the real majority [MN] did not vote for Bush --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he was the m- he didn't get there by the majority, [SIGH] um --
L:  Yeah, the Electoral College process is stupid.  That was great back in the seventeen hundreds --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] when you had no communication, no fast rapid transit.  You don't have that crap now --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you should go right to the direct one person one vote thing.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, [SIGH] and, uh, the thing is --
