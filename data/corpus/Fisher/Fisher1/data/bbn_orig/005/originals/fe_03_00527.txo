R:  Hello?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Tracey.
L:  Hi, my name's Kathy.
R:  [LAUGH] Hi.  [SIGH] Um, you want to go first?
L:  Oh, no. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I-
L:  Have you -- have done one of these before?
R:  [MN] Nope, this is my first one.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my first one, too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I just actually responded to the email just seconds ago, [SIGH] so, um, but, I'll -- I'll go ahead and say gossiping.  Um, my personal opinion is that [SIGH] with gossiping, especially, uh, in an office setting and everything, you can -- you can ruin people's, [SIGH] um, you know, their reputations.  Um, sometimes the gossip ruins people's lives because it -- it interferes with them personally an- and certainly can interfere with them professionally.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah, that's really true, an- and w- I -- I think what's really bad about gossiping [SIGH] is so often it gets repeated and it gets repeated inaccurately. [LAUGH] 
R:  Absolutely. [SIGH]  You know, you tell -- tell something and down the line it -- it makes it through fifteen people and it's now turned into a [SIGH] a two hour story instead of a two second statement.
L:  [LAUGH] Really.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Like that telephone game. [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Yes.
L:  You ever play that?
R:  [SIGH] Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] And that --
L:  [SIGH] That can be so funny at parties.
R:  [SIGH] That's a -- that's a perfect example of it. [NOISE] [MN] Now, I don't know if this goes on to a second question, or if [NOISE] we're supposed to talk --
L:  No --
R:  -- each of the --
L:  -- we're -- we're supposed to talk abou this for ten minutes.
R:  Oh.
L:  Until [LAUGH] -- until the recording comes on and tells us our time is up.
R:  [SIGH] And is that the only thing it does, is one question?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, just the, uh, just the one question.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  And so --
R:  Well, let's see, we had gossiping, um, I don't see caffeine addiction as a major plague in society. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] No, not really.
R:  [LAUGH] It's more of a -- a personal choice than I think it is -- a [NOISE] -- an --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, it can sure cause --
R:  -- affliction.
L:  -- medical problems for people.
R:  True.
L:  Well, some people are -- are so sensitive to caffeine, you know, they end up getting hyper and -- and, uh --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- rubbing the people the wrong way. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's true. [SIGH] I mean they did mention alcohol, and I think that that's more of a -- a potential hazard.  It [MN] -- you know, if it's moderate and -- and handled in a responsible setting, then that's one thing, but [SIGH], um, you know, you put teenagers and alcohol -- I volunteer in a rescue squad, and [SIGH] -- and we see too many of the --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- alcohol involved accidents. [SIGH]  And, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you get the domestic situations and things like that, and that's just kind of a bad combination.
L:  [SIGH] We have lots of problems with alcohol in our area.  [SIGH] I live in Las Vegas.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I live in New Jersey, but I'll tell ya I love Vegas.
L:  Oh, do you? [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] It's -- it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a fun place to visit. [SIGH]  Uh, b- but the -- the problem being, especially with, uh, the casinos giving out free drinks all the time.
R:  Yes.
L:  [SIGH] And people get angry, and people get -- you know, if they've been drinking, they get [MN] even more angry and more hostile from losing.
R:  [MN] That's right, and they lose their tolerance for -- for the other people.
L:  Mhm, [SIGH] and then they leave the casino and they've been drinking and they're angry and they drive like crazy.  It's just unbelievable.  Uh, [MN] we see people walking out of the casino, they can't even walk straight.
R:  I -- I know exactly --
L:  You know?
R:  -- what you mean.
L:  Mm, then they get in the car, and th- I mean they're muttering all the way out the door because they're mad --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] and you know, and you watch them burn rubber out the parking lot, and you wonder what's going to happen to the rest of their family when they get home. [SIGH] 
R:  Yes, that's true, that's true.
L:  If they make it home. [LAUGH] 
R:  That- that's the problem, and like a --
L:  Like, we have just a terrible accident rate here.
R:  Really?
L:  Oh, yeah, from [SIGH] -- well, you know, the majority of the people that live here gamble, and, you know, every five minutes a cocktail waitress is going by, saying, you know, "Cocktails, cocktails". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes.
L:  And they're free.
R:  Yes, I know when --
L:  So, they pay a lot --
R:  -- when we've been there --
L:  -- of people.
R:  -- we've seen some of the people that -- that should have been removed long ago.
L:  [SIGH] Well, a lot of people that wouldn't normally drink, or drink that much, end up drinking more than they would --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- for one reason, because it's free and another, because they're frustrated. [SIGH] 
R:  Yes, uh, I know exactly what you mean.  You know, like I say, we've visited there quite frequently and [SIGH] -- and you see it constantly, just watching, [SIGH] um -- especially the younger crowd, I think, because it's like, you know, they don't have to spend eight dollars on a drink at a -- at a bar, they're -- they're free --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, of course, the casino's out to make the buck and [SIGH] if you're drinking you're hopefully not going to notice you're losing as much, or [SIGH] be stupid with what you bet and --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know, they're going to make money, especially --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I know -- you know, like, I play blackjack, so you sit at a table and if you've got [SIGH] someone that's -- that's three sheets, they have no clue what they're betting for or against or what they're doing and, you know, of course the House is going to continue to win.
L:  Oh, I know, you ought to see some of the silly things we see people do [SIGH] when it comes to playing, like the video poker machine. [SIGH] You know, th- they make really crazy plays. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, part of it is the fact that they're so drunk that they [LAUGH] don't know what they're doing.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Which brings up another personal habit of -- of smoking. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  Which, ah, [MN] so many of the people in the casino do [SIGH] and they just sit there and chain smoke one cigarette after another, [LAUGH] you know, it's [MN] drag on the cigarette, you know, sip on the drink. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, yeah, they kind of go hand in hand.
L:  They do, and I think a larger percentage of people that smoke -- well, I know, I've -- I've heard from statistics that we've got more smokers here in Nevada than most other states.
R:  Really?
L:  It's a personality type, [MN] you know, the type that -- that goes for the gambling, uh, is a risk taker, you know, and that's what smokers are too.
R:  Right, and it's kind of one addiction hand in hand with another.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah, and then the alcohol fits right in [LAUGH] as well.
R:  And then you get -- and then you tie that right into the gossiping, because it ties right into the story telling. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Kind of all goes hand in hand.  Yeah, I'd- I -- I mean, I -- you know, they -- they gave us that list, and I mean you can go down several of them and -- and even hit on the, you know, obis- obesity topic, and I mean, there is -- there's people that can't help the problem and then there's people that can help the problem and, um, you know, I just, I -- I don't know if you saw on the news that they had the -- the girl suing McDonalds?
L:  [SIGH] Another one?
R:  It's the teenage girl, she's eighteen or nineteen, suing McDonalds because they made her obese.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, I heard something about --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- that.
R:  And, I mean, she -- she was eating phenomenal amounts of food daily there.  You know [SIGH] um, the average person would have, say, you know, a meal of the chicken fingers, and she would go there for -- for lunch and order three plus, you know, two Big Macs, and -- and, you know, a whole bunch of french fries and onion rings, and then, you know a couple of shakes and [SIGH] that was her normal lunch, and she did this daily, and you know there was no warning that she might get obese from it, so she's suing McDonalds.
L:  Oh, that's so crazy. [SIGH] 
R:  And, you know, I mean, and -- and that's where, you know, the obesity comes into the problem and society, is -- is from that kind of a -- a setting, you know, I mean it's one thing if -- if circumstances has -- have caused it, you know, beyond your control but if you can change it I think -- there's too many options out there today for you not to change, [PAUSE] [LIPSMACK] but 
L:  Okay, I know overeating and obesity are [LAUGH] also -- and not -- and lack of exercise [SIGH], which is another thing that's -- was also listed on this question. [SIGH] Those are all things that, uh, are -- are major problems here too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You get the buffets, you know? [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  [SIGH] You don't get --
R:  Just five ninety nine. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] You don't get much exercise sitting in front of a video poker machine or a blackjack table. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, you don't, no, you don't.  And of course there you can eat twenty four hours a day, non-stop and it's quality food and --
L:  Oh, yeah, and you -- [MN] all you got to do is play the machines with your club card in, you know, and you get points and they'll give you free [LAUGH] buffets for 'em.
R:  Yep, yep, I know when we're out there we, you know, [SIGH] we usually use the comp towards our -- our room, but, um, you know, because the buffets are so cheap, but still, I mean, you -- you decide, "Okay, well, I've been gambling all night, so I'll eat breakfast at four o'clock and go to bed.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, of course, what do you do?  You eat and you sleep for a few hours right after you eat, which is, you know, one of the worst things that you can do.
L:  Yeah, buffets th- and people have a tendency to overeat, because, you know, it's there, it's free, you've paid for it, basically.  You know, took free to get more [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:   -- you know [LAUGH] more and more, [SIGH] and you think, "Well, I want -- I want to eat my money's worth" you know, [LAUGH] so --
R:  [LAUGH] I know.
L:  -- you go get another plate. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. I know, well, "They took me for a hundred dollars, so [LAUGH] I'm going to eat my hundred dollars worth of food". 
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I've heard that, [SIGH] I've [LAUGH] -- I've heard people say that. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I -- I always love the people that try and -- and put it in their -- you know, the -- the women that try and put it in their purse, or -- the men are handing it to 'em to put it in their purse to take it back for later. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, we see lots of that. [SIGH] We saw a man one day, [SIGH] he had these big baggy pants [SIGH] [MN] with pockets, big pockets on them [LAUGH] and he was taking these -- [SIGH] these sandwiches and wrapping 'em in napkins [LAUGH] and stuffing --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- 'em in his pockets [LAUGH] and he put so many in there, he just looked hilarious. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, my heavens.
L:  [SIGH] You know, we see people do that constantly. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, my -- my -- I -- I always say, you know, "I- if you're that desperate, take it". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] You know, for whatever the circumstances there are, just -- just take it. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Well, we saw --
R:  Because they obv- they obviously are desperate enough for whatever reason, whether it's, you know, they've -- they've lost money at the casino, or [SIGH] you know, they're having difficulties --
