L:  
R:  Hi, I'm Heather.
L:  Hi, I'm Donny.
R:  Hi.
L:  How are ya?
R:  Good, how're you doing?
L:  Oh, I'm okay.
R:  Good.
L:  So, I guess we're supposed to talk about the personal habits? [SIGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] All right, which do you think is worse?
R:  I don't know, probably smoking, to me, it's just a big annoyance.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I kind of agree with you there.
R:  It's, you know, stinky and smelly. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And it gets in your clothes, and in your hair. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly, it's like, you can avoid -- you know, you can avoid the others, but smoking just kind of -- if you don't like it and you're out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you can't deal with it.
L:  Especially if you go out and you wanna, you know, go to a restaurant, a nice restaurant, and they have a smoking section which some of them still do -- [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it kinda drifts over into where you are in a non smoking section.  It's a pain.
R:  Yeah, even if you want to go out, you know, to a bar or whatever and just have a drink, it's like, if you don't smoke, you're -- you're there anyway, you still have to--
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- smell it.
L:  Yeah, you go home smelling like it. [LAUGH]
R:  -- deal with it, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so.  How long have you been doing the surveys?
R:  This is actually my first one to do.
L:  Okay, me, too. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, is it?  Okay, [LAUGH] so neither one of know what we're doing, that's great. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know, it's like okay, I got this thing in an email, and it's like, "Oh, get ten bucks a survey, okay, that's fine". [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay, I'll do that, yeah.  Yeah, I signed up, like, before Christmas, but this --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- but this is the first phone call I've gotten, so 
L:  Oh, I signed up last night. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  I just -- maybe the bunch of people signed up when I did, and -- who knows?
L:  Cool.
R:  Yeah, smoking's definitely the biggest annoyance for me.
L:  [MN] Yeah, me too, me too, definitely.
R:  Can't really deal with that. [LAUGH] 
L:  Nah, I think that after smoking, now --
R:  Oh, there are some states are putting laws out now that you can't smoke in restaurants, which --
L:  Oh, we have no smoking at almost everywhere here.  But what state are you in?
R:  I'm in Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, okay, I'm in Maryland.

R:  Oh, okay, I grew up in Maryland, actually.
L:  Oh, okay, what part?
R:  I was born in Frederick.
L:  Okay. 
R:  What about you, where are you?
L:  I'm down in -- actually, I'm a little south from you, I'm down in, um, the Greenbelt area.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  But, um, actually I was just doing a contract not too far from Frederick.
R:  Okay.
L:  And so, you all get [NOISE] most of the snow up there.
R:  Yes, they get -- they get a lot.
L:  Yes, indeed.
R:  Seems like the Washington and [inaudible] area gets nothing, and Frederick does, stuff.
L:  Oh, man, but our schools close all the time. [LAUGH] So 
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  [LAUGH] No, it's not. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, no?  'Cause -- [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah, I have a child in school, and it's like, okay, every time I turn around, the schools are closed.
R:  Yeah, and it stuffs the work -- I know.  
L:  And it's frustrating.  [LAUGH] So --
R:  That's like, my son's home sick, it's like, okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, man.  [MN]  How old is your son?
R:  He's three.
L:  Oh, ok- ooh.
R:  So, he's little.
L:  That's the only one?
R:  For now, yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, see, that's the good age, you know?  
R:  Another smoking annoyance, though, you go out and you're pregnant, and it's like, you know? [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, that's a huge one.
R:  You feel like you can't go here or there, because somebody might be smoking, and stuff.
L:  No, that made it very hard when my wife was pregnant, because it was like just the smell of cigarette smoke made her nauseous --
R:  Yes.
L:  And it made her even more nauseous, because she was pregnant, it was like, oh, God, there was nowhere that we could go, and back in -- my son is nine and back then --
R:  So, back then people smoked --
L:  -- they didn't have the laws --
R:  -- everywhere.  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- so, you could smoke in restaurants, you could smoke --
R:  So, you can -- anywhere.
L:  -- wherever, and it was like, finding somewhere to go, if you just wanted to go out and have a nice little meal out, you know, with her being pregnant, and smoking was allowed everywhere, it was just a pain.
R:  It is, I know --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- like, you know, when I was pregnant with my son, it's like, "Okay, now where can we go that, you know, I'll be able to eat and breathe?" [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, you avoid caffeine, you avoid alcohol, you avoid everything for the baby, and you go somewhere and everybody's smoking around you and you're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like okay.  My sister in law -- actually my brother in law just got married --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  -- and, ah, at the -- I remember at the reception she finally had to leave because everybody was in there smoking and she's like --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- you know, "I can't" -- she's pregnant, she's like, "I can't stay in here".  I'm like, "Go, see ya". 
L:  Yeah, that's ridiculous.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] And I love to watch the smokers, like, this time of year, as they huddle up outside. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, they're all -- [LAUGH] outside the building.
L:  You know, I kind of want to -- yeah, it's like you see this group of people --
R:  Puffing away.
L:  -- huddled up around a match.  [LAUGH] It's like, kind of wonder -- when will they get it?
R:  Yeah, this is attractive, this is someone I would want to date --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  It's like every -- every other hour or so, they got to run outside, and you know, get into this group hug, and it's like there's one little match [LAUGH] you know, they pass it around.  It's like, okay.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I would be a -- if I was a smoker, I would be quitting this time of year, it's so cold [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- it's like, "Uh uh". [LAUGH] 
L:  They claim the cold air and the --
R:  Nothing to worry about.
L:  -- uh, cigarette tax.
R:  Yeah, nothing's worth standing out in the cold for ten minutes.
L:  Oh, no, not at all.  Oh, man, I can't see how people can really afford to do it any more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, 'cause I don't know what they cost up there, but I mean, we're up to -- [SIGH] I've seen some packets high as five dollars and some change for a pack.
R:  Well.
L:  And, I mean, if, you know, --
R:  That's a lot of money.
L:  -- a chain smoker who's smoking a couple of packs a day [LAUGH] --
R:  Right -- right, you're talking, yeah, ten, fifteen bucks a day, is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's so much else you could do with that money.
L:  Well, yes, indeed.
R:  Nice vacations, [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, you save --
L:  Yeah, I know [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that money up for a year, it --
L:  Pay some bills. [LAUGH]
R:  Go to the Bahamas or something. [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, if you're spending ten bucks a day on cigarettes, I mean, hey, guess what?
R:  Yeah, you could go buy a CD for the cigarettes you just smoked.
L:  You know, just -- or just put it towards your children's educational fund, or something, I mean, --
R:  Something.
L:  -- that's, what, fifty to seventy dollars a week? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, when you figure, just all the time, I mean, like, if you're at work, you're sitting at work with a smoker, every, like, twenty minutes or so, they're going down to -- to go smoke a cigarette, and you're still sitting there working, it's like, "Hey, wait a minute here". [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  Is this fair? [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, and -- and you don't get a break unless you're a smoker --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, 'cause there's -- I mean --
R:  You can go out and have a cigarette --
L:  -- what else do you do?
R:  But, yeah. 
L:  No, but, [SIGH] you got to love 'em, though. [SIGH] 
R:  I want a break too, I don't know, read a book, or whatever, you know? [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay, I don't smoke, can I get the same ten minutes every hour?
L:  You know, just go out -- just give me a break so I can just go for a walk. [LAUGH] 
R:  Really, something. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Get away.  Give up.  So, what kind of work do you do?
R:  I am basically a stay at home mom --
L:  Okay, cool.
R:  -- although I also work part time for a financial company.
L:  Cool.  So, on the flip side, I'm a stay at home dad, so hey. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, that's cool.  Do you like that?
L:  Yeah, it- it's kinda fun.  I mean, if -- if something is kinda growing -- I did, um, land administration for about fourteen years, and branched out and started my own consulting company, so, that's been -- it's been fun.  It's a challenge from time to time, but it's been fun.
R:  It's definitely like, now that my son is in pre school, it has been a wonderful, wonderful thing for mum. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] That's the best part.
R:  Just to get that -- you know, it's only two hours twice a week, but it's still just -- you know?
L:  I do.
R:  Time without someone sitting on top of you [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] 
R:  -- pulling your hair, you know? [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] That is definitely one of the good things --
R:  Just some me time --
L:  -- about it.
R:  --with nobody bothering me is definitely nice.
L:  Yeah.  No, I don't get see my -- I've actually been wondering where he is, cause usually he's home from school by two thirty, and it's about the time that I start seeing him, and, okay, two thirty comes, and he does his homework, and then we play. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's cool.
L:  So, I'm free until he finishes his homework. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, this is like, not really free, because you've got clients bothering all day, but --
R:  But still, yeah.
L:  Oh, and I have to -- I guess now I make room for these sporadic phone calls [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, really.
L: -- for this survey. [LAUGH] 
R:  Hey, it -- it's -- it's a --
L:  It's like I didn't really think the thing working, with -- you know, you fill out all those things on line, and it's like, "Okay, [SIGH] so I just --"
R:  Yeah I'm filling it out, and I'm like, "Nobody's ever going to call for this, this is like [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, and I don't quite --
L:  And then, what do you know, today she calls and she's like, "Are you ready to give it a go today?"  I'm like, "Sure." [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] There you go.  Now, that's ten bucks.
L:  No problem.
R:  [LAUGH] I guess if you do enough of them, hey -- [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, well, you know, --
R:  -- it's work.
L:  -- being an at home mum, it's like that's something I can do, at home, when, you know, he's doing whatever.  It's not like -- you know, working part time to go pay for daycare or whatever, doesn't make sense.
R:  That's true.
L:  My part time job works out perfect, because when my husband comes home, I leave, so you don't have to get daycare, or whatever, but -- childcare to work part time doesn't make sense.
R:  Oh, no, not at all.
L:  You pay more than you make.
R:  That is true.  You know, my mother has a home daycare, she's had it for years, and I look at what she charges, or what the parents pay there, I'm like, "My God".  I mean, is -- I think she's up to a hundred and fifty a child per week.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you know what it is?  I [NOISE] my friend did that for a while, and the insurance that you have to get is so outrageously expensive --
R:  Oh, man.
L:  -- that you got to charge a lot because the insurance is like --
R:  Insurance is high.
L:  -- you know, cause it's -- it's people's children.  I mean, that's -- that's a lot of insurance you need for that.
R:  You have to comply with all the state rules and regulations are followed --
L:  Yeah, the permits and all that stuff, it's expensive to do apparently.
R:  It is.  I mean, she's been doing it for a while, but, you know, it -- it's expensive.  I mean, I've watched the cars go up, and I'm like, I'm so glad that she has a daycare so I don't have to pay if we have [LAUGH] another child.
L:  Really? [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, we got a hundred and fifty bucks per week, yes -- ooh, this is steep paying.
L:  It is, it's -- it's a lot, I know.
R:  So, how long do we have to do the, um, I guess, the call?
L:  I don't know.  I thought ten minutes, but I didn't even read what time it was when we started.  [LAUGH] I don't know if they cut --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- us off automatically, or what.
R:  [LAUGH] I have no idea.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I sat on hold --
R:  [LAUGH] I think it's been about ten minutes, but I'm not sure.
L:  Probably, 'cause I sat on hold for like about  I guess it was like five minutes on hold, --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- while they looked for someone.
R:  Yes, they must have gotten -- they must have called me after you, 'cause it was, like, right on as soon as --
L:  Oh, 'cause they had me on hold and, um, they came back about three or four minutes after I'd been on hold, and it was like, "If you want to continue to hold and wait for someone, press one".
R:  They must have been having a hard time finding somebody who would -- who was home, or something.
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] 
R:  I got this message, "If you're home and this is you, and you want to talk about the topic, press one now" --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] 
R:  -- or whatever, [LAUGH] and then -- and then your pin number and --
L:  Oh, that works.  I'm looking at the email they sent, uh, let's see, [PAUSE] yeah, I don't see anything.  [LAUGH] So I guess we just --
R:  Doesn't say if it'll cut us off -- [LAUGH] 
L:  -- keep on talking. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
