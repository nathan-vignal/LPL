R:  Ah, hi, my name's Beth.
L:  Oh, hi, Beth, I'm April.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH] 
L:  Hi. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, this is an interesting topic.
L:  Oh, yes. [LAUGH] 
R:  Ooh, jeeze, oh, he listed a lot of things, oh.
L:  I'd probably say gossiping, uh, my personal opinion.
R:  Gossiping?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, yeah, oh --
L:  'Cause that's hurting other people, I think --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think pretty much everything else he listed is self inflicted. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well. I might -- you know, I tend to agree with you, because --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, you know, s- it -- you know, secondhand smoke is one thing, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- oh, you know, I think that's a habit that's a little harder to break because it's an addiction --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- as is drinking and, you know --
L:  I don't know, I know a few people who gossiping could be classified as an addiction.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, you know, I come from a long --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I come from a long line of proud gossipers, so --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, it -- it was actually a -- a habit that I had to look at and -- and try to break --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, [SIGH] but, oh.  Hm, okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know, what little bit of adult contact I have [MN] is usually, um, a sounding board. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay, for --
L:  I -- I stay at home with my kids, and -- and I babysit a girlfriend of mine's kids and -- pretty much she sounds off at me whatever happens throughout her day, so [LAUGH] that's pretty --
R:  Right.
L:  -- much what I'm at with daily.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  And so, tell me, who would you repeat [NOISE] -- oh, Budgie, sorry.  I just stepped on the cat -- [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh God.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, no one -- no one over the age of eight, I promise you, would hear anything that you [LAUGH] have to say, so  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, right.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Oh and, you know, um, I'm part of a twelve step programme, and we had to do a moral inventory of ourselves --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for the fourth step, and, you know, gossip was one of the main things that I put down that I wanted to change about myself --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and [SIGH] course I don't smoke and I don't drink, and [SIGH] so   I exercise, so, I can't remember what else [LAUGH] he said. [LAUGH] 
L:  I think, uh, smoking, drinking, not exercising and drinking a lot of caffeine.
R:  Right.  Ok-
L:  [MN] if I don't have the caffeine, I have a really bad withdrawal headache, so I can't do without my tea -- not a soda --
R:  Right.
L:  -- can't handle the soda -- bad on my stomach, but tea, if I don't have my tea during the day I get really bad headaches [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so  [LAUGH]  Smoking, I quit doing that a long time ago, whe- when I was pregnant the first time, so 
R:  Oh, well, that's good --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  Well, I mean, in that case, you know, if someone was pregnant --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and smoking --
L:  Oh, then I'd, yeah --
R:  -- or -- or drinking, then definitely it would be a habit --
L:  Oh absolutely.
R:  -- that --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  --that would be harmful to someone else other than themselves.
L:  Mhm, that's true.
R:  Well, where --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- are you at?  I noticed they seem to --
L:  I'm in South Alabama.
R:  Oh, okay, well, I'm in Kentucky, so they didn't exactly get divergent viewpoints.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Not too much, no, but --
R:  And I grew up in Florida, so 
L:  Mhm.
R:  But --
L:  I'm -- I'm righ- I'm actually on the Florida Alabama line.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  Pretty much where -- I mean I'm closer to Florida than -- I m- I'm in Alabama, but I -- I stay in Pensacola most --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- of the time, so   [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.
L:  That's where everything is, 'cause all there is out here where I am is cows, so  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.
L:  But, uh, my husband's --
R:  Cows?
L:  I like being where there's more cows than people, it's just nicer that way.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I understand.  I grew up in Orlando, and I live in a not too large town, now, but --
L:  Really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The only place I think I've been in Kentucky is Paducah.
R:  Oh, well, I'm about an --
L:  I had an aunt --
R:  -- hour from there.
L:  Yeah, I had an aunt up there.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah, I'm in Hopkinsville --
L:  Mm, no.  [SIGH] 
R:  -- which if you have gone to Paducah from Alabama, then you've probably --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- passed right by.
L:  Probably, probably, it's been ages.  [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, I hear babies?
L:  [NOISE] Yes [NOISE] and Scooby doo.
R:  [LAUGH] Scooby doo. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I have two toddlers and my eight year old daughter's home from school, her tonsils flared.
R:  Oh, jeeze.
L:  So 
R:  Well, how long have we been talking, do you [LAUGH] think?
L:  I don't know, I think the robot comes on after ten minutes --
R:  Right.
L:  -- is the w- what I remember, but, um --
R:  Well, do we -- [LAUGH] 
L:  M- back -- I'm back on topic, if I can [NOISE] get on that way.  I had a girlfriend --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whose doctor told her -- she smoked over a pack a day --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he told her as long as she cut back to ten cigarettes a day while she was pregnant, she'd be fine.  I thought that was appalling.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  I thought that was --
R:  -- pretty insane.
L:  -- ridiculous.  [LAUGH] He said the shock to her body of quitting cold cu- cold turkey would be worse to the baby than just cutting back, which -- I didn't see that at all.
R:  I don't see that, no.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, I mean, it seems like most of the people that do quit smoking --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- quit cold turkey --
L:  Right, if that's --
R:  -- if they're --
L:  -- the only way.
R:  -- successful at it, and yeah --
L:  I was lucky that my -- my body chemistry [NOISE] changed pretty much to the point the minute that I was pregnant -- I didn't know I was pregnant when I quit --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I found out about a month later --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- so -- but I -- it just got to -- you know how your tastes change for food and drink when you're pregnant?
R:  Right.
L:  Same thing happened when I got pregnant, with cigarettes.  They made me physically ill the next time I tried to smoke --
R:  Oh, well.
L:  --it just -- literally disgusting --
R:  Definitely -- 
L:  -- so 
R:  to your advantage.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  Yes.
R:  Kinda like, you know, I worked for the court system for years, and back when I first started, they were giving antabuse[?] to --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to people, hoping that --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  --if -- if they became violently ill when they drank --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they would not drink.
L:  Right.
R:  Of course, aversion therapy doesn't really work on alcoholics, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, [SIGH] um, because they're used to being ill from the effects of drinking --
L:  [NOISE]  Exactly.
R:  -- so -- but, yeah, I would think that if you -- if it tasted horrible when you smoked, because -- I would think that taste would be the majority of it?
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- I --
R:  Wouldn't it?
L:  I didn't enjoy being [LAUGH] physically ill from something that -- it -- it was a casual thing to start with, just, you know, 
R:  Right.
L:  -- at work and -- and -- and out, not generally at home and not -- you know, every [SIGH] so often.  I mean, you know, to the point where I was throwing cigarette packs out -- I kept them in my silverware drawer and throw 'em out after a while.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  But, yeah, we- well, it -- it wasn't a really big thing.  I told my husband I don't really have an addictive nature I don't think, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but that -- it was easy for me to drop once that I'd got just ill, just completely ill.  I mean, we used to pick up a young man, uh, that worked with my husband --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and take him to work in the morning, and he wouldn't be smoking in the car, but just him getting in the car with it on his clothes, made me just sick --
R:  Oh, that's odd, yeah.
L:  -- sick [LAUGH] to my stomach, so just the smell of it was nasty.  Um --
R:  So, is it still that way, or ?
L:  It's still that way, [SIGH] yeah, um -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my girlfriend that -- I babysit her kids, uh -- her and her husband are both heavy smokers, and I just practically strip her children naked when they get in the house and put everything, their car seats and diaper bags in the corner and leave them --
R:  Right.
L:  -- there [LAUGH] and -- and put --
R:  Well --
L:  -- clothes -- put the other clothes on, because I -- because it just reeks off of everything.
R:  Right.
L:  So.
R:  So, I mean, really, her habit affects you in a -- in a pretty dramatic way.
L:  Yeah, yeah, it does, and --
R:  So, even though, if she's not smoking around you, you're -- it's still --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- affecting you, so 
L:  Yeah, that's just, you know -- drinking, I can't say that I've stopped, but since I've had children, it's, you know, I just threw away last year's m- ah, drink mixer --
R:  Oh [LAUGH] okay.
L:  -- from last New Year's Eve, right before this Christmas --
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  So, you know, [SIGH] can't say it's a major thing --
R:  I d- I don't think --
L:  -- in this house anymore.
R:  -- I don't think it's a major effect on your life, nah [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, your priorities get shifted so major when the kids come too, you know, it's the diapers or a six pack.  Hmm, let me see.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm glad I don't smoke, and I'm happy we can afford to live -- it's not like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's expensive as it is now. [NOISE] It's, you know, how can you [LAUGH] feed yourself and your children and spend a hundred dollars a week on cigarettes?
R:  Right.
L:  It's just crazy.
R:  Well, I mean, you know, actually that would -- could be an effect on a family by it, other than the secondhand smoke, or --
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, because --
L:  Financial.
R:  -- you know, if you're addicted to cigarettes and unable to quit smoking, then, you know, your family could be doing without --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- as a result of it, so  [SIGH] But, I --
L:  That kinda throws that back in that line. [LAUGH] 
R:  Hm?
L:  I say it kinda throws it back in that line, and out of self, ah --
R:  Right.
L:  -- desecration, I would imagine.
R:  Right.
L:  Thank you dear, thank you, thank you. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Hang on one second.  But, ah, yeah, I don't know.
R:  But, you know, as far as -- as, you know, gossiping, which we both said, you know, hurts other people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh  you know, like I said, I come from a long line of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of proud gossips that almost feel that I'm denying them something if --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I decline to gossip, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  I've got an aunt that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- continuously tries to get me to talk about a former co worker.  You know, what have I heard, what have I heard, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and it's -- it's finally -- I guess some of 'em'll realize when I've -- I've resigned.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, from the -- from the gossip club or something, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because they -- you know, it -- it -- it actually gets easier after a while just because they quit coming --
L:  They stop asking.
R:  -- to me because --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- they don't get --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the satisfaction, you know, but, oh, you know -- you know, when he listed, um -- I just thought -- I didn't even think of caffeine, because, you know, I'm like you -- I do that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I used to be really bad.  I used to go through a couple of, ah, Dr. Peppers a day when I worked in retail --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, you don't realize that you go through  you know, I'd go through three or four twenty ounce Dr. Peppers [NOISE] in a day, and they were --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, like, a candy bar a day -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's horrible, but, ah, --
R:  Oh, well --
L:  -- I can't -- I can't handle it now.  I don't know if it's just from being away from it, or just getting older, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, when we're -- when we're out on our weekends at -- you know, we run the roads and everything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we'll stop and everybody'll get a pop at the gas station and, uh, if I go more than once, oh, I pay for it all day long.
R:  Right.
L:  It just -- it just kills me, just the bubbles just kill me, I guess.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, gee.
L:  I can't have too many carbonated drinks, I guess.
R:  Right.
L:  But the caffeine -- I have to have my tea if I can't have anything else.
R:  Right.
L:  Go ahead, you can get some.  Go ahead. [NOISE] Yeah, you can get one.  Getting my --
R:  [NOISE]
