L:  Hello.
R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] Hi. [SIGH] 
R:  Hi.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  What are we supposed to do?
L:  [SIGH] I'm not sure, this is my first time doing this.
R:  Mine too. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I'm Cheryl.
R:  My name is Melissa.
L:  It's nice to meet you.
R:  You too.  So, we're supposed to talk about what we think should be done with Iraq?
L:  Yeah, I think so.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know.
R:  What do you think?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Um, I don't know, I don't think we should go to war yet, because we don't really have proof of anything, do we?
L:  [SIGH] I don't think so, and I agree with you on that.  In fact, I mean --
R:  I think it's kind of scary to send ours -- our, you know, hardworking people over there when there's -- I mean, what are we fighting over, if they're not  you know?
L:  [SIGH] I --
R:  I don't know.
L:  I agree, in fact, I talked my son out of joining the army because of that.  I don't want him over there.
R:  It's very scary. [LAUGH] Uh, um --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] This is awkward.
L:  Yes, it is. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] 'Cause I don't know what to say. [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, I guess I -- I am worried about terrorism, if that's why they think they should go after Iraq, but I don't -- I think that they should defend the United States first before we go invading another country.
L:  I agree with that.
R:  I think that we should tell 'em off. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, [LAUGH] this is weird. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] It's extremely weird.
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Um.
L:  What do you guys think? [NOISE] 
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Should we go to war with -- with Iraq?
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I have a houseful of people, I'm asking their opinion. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  What, Jason? [SIGH] My boyfriend says, "No".  Everyone here --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- says no.
L:  What do you think, Byron[?], should we go to war? [NOISE] [LAUGH] She said that we should nuke them and steal all of their natural resources.
R:  Oh, God. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I hope she was kidding. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [COUGH] That's one of the things that I'm most afraid of. [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] I'm not ready to die yet. [LAUGH] 
R:  Me either. [LAUGH] Um, I guess I would just worry about what's going to happen with the people that they have that are in our country already. [LIPSMACK] What are they going to do when we go to war with their country?  I mean, are they going to go crazy on us and, like, start plotting another huge terrorist attack, or ? 
L:  I really honestly --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- believe they will.
R:  [SIGH] I think so too, and I think that our government isn't doing, um, I guess, enough to secure us in our own country, but they're willing to send all of our people, who could defend us, [NOISE] over there. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] -- I agree with that. [NOISE] [SIGH] I'm so not used to this.
R:  I know, [LAUGH] it's very, very awkward. [LAUGH] 
L:  It's so easy when you can talk to somebody that you know, it's just --
R:  Right.
L:  -- really awkward talking to somebody that you've never met before. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  It's also a very, like, weird topic. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] It's a live person, what they do is they call you up, you enter your PIN and then they connect you with another person that signed up to do the study, and then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] you talk to them about the subject that they choose --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- and you get paid for doing the study. [NOISE]  Where are you at?
R:  I'm in Michigan --
L:  In --
R:  -- where are you?
L:  I'm in Kansas.
R:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH] Is it cold? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I signed up for this time because this way I'm not on the computer at this time.
R:  Oh.
L:  She asked why it was eleven o'clock. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, it's quarter after twelve here [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and so  yeah.
L:  You're a night owl too, huh? [SIGH] 
R:  We are actually [LAUGH] -- we are out dumpster diving. [LAUGH] 
L:  You're what?
R:  Dumpster diving.
L:  You're dumpster diving?
R:  [NOISE] Yes. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  You're as bad as me.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] I do the same thing.
R:  We went to Big Lots. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] And they threw away all of their Christmas stuff.
L:  Oh, are you serious?
R:  I swear.
L:  I wish I was there.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  She said Big Lots threw away all their Christmas stuff. [NOISE] She's in Michigan.  We can't get to Michigan, it would take too long, [LAUGH] besides, I think she'd have --
R:  So, do you think we get into trouble --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- if we don't stay on topic? [NOISE] 
L:  [LAUGH] I have no idea. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  We'd better get back on the topic. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  [SIGH] We're in Iraq, um [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  I don't think they should 'cause I don't -- I don't want to be nuked.
R:  [NOISE] I know. [NOISE] I -- I think it's scary that we could lose so many people for such --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I mean, what are we losing them for, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What's the purpose?
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  And then last time we went to war, they didn't even kill Saddam Hussein who is the mastermind, I guess, behind [NOISE] the whole thing anyway, so 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, and I don't understand why they can't kill him, I mean, they have satellites that can track people, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- zoom in on them and see them picking their butts --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so why can't they --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- find one guy and get rid of him?
R:  I know, and then, do you think, like Osama bin Laden is connected with him?
L:  I think so, I think they're all in cahoots.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] I don't know, I just think they ought to do a better job of patrolling our borders and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, checking air flights, and [SIGH] I've seen people that are griping about how long it takes to get on an aeroplane now, and [SIGH] I think to myself, you know, "What's a few hours extra making sure that you're going to have a safe flight to get wherever you're going?"
R:  Right.
L:  And I have to --
R:  I actually -- no, I have to -- I'm sorry. [LAUGH] 
L:  Go ahead, I was --
R:  Um, I was listening to the news tonight, and they said that in Michigan, like, five to ten percent of, um police officers in each county, like, if the national guard does have to go, um, to war, are going to be taken away from our police force.
L:  Oh, seriously?
R:  -- so w- and they're not going to get anybody to fill their positions, because, um, those people are guaranteed their spots when they come back --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so, um, they're going to work short staffed and not even be able to fulfill their basic duties, is what they said.
L:  I think that's stupid.
R:  [COUGH] I think so too, because who's going to protect us when they retaliate? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I think this would be a perfect time for them to come over and do stuff, knowing that we've got all our people over there.
R:  Right. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] What are we supposed to do when we're done talking, do you know?
R:  Um, I think a recording comes on and says, "Your ten minutes are up, you have thirty seconds to say goodbye". [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, it's a ten minute phone call?  See, I didn't even know how long this was supposed to go on.
R:  Yeah.  How did you hear about it?
L:  [SIGH] I got on the internet last night, and looked up paid surveys, 'cause I'm disabled and can't work.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And this would be the perfect thing for me to do, 'cause I'm on my computer all the time. [SIGH] 
R:  Me too. [LAUGH] 
L:  And this is, you know, just a little extra cash that I can use.
R:  Um, have you checked out, like, the, um, freebie and coupon websites?
L:  Uh-huh. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's where I heard about it. I get a lot of --
L:  I think that's where I found it too.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  Peanut, go lay down right now.
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  Got a dog nosing my dinner.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Go lay down. [SIGH] [NOISE] I don't know. [SIGH] I just -- I don't war just to break out.  I thought -- somebody told me that we were already at war.
R:  Really?
L:  I had --
R:  See, that's scary, because I think they hide a lot of stuff from us, too.
L:  Oh, yeah, you know they do.  They don't --
R:  I know.
L:  -- tell us the whole truth. [PAUSE] [SIGH] Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  I don't know.
L:  Hey, you guys help me out here, because I can't think of anything to talk about --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- with Iraq, so, we got ten minutes we have to talk.
R:  [SIGH] I think we've been on her about eight, so 
L:  [NOISE] My friends aren't very helpful. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] [SIGH] I don't -- do you have any kids?
R:  I have two kids --
L:  How do you --
R:  -- five and two.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, mine is twenty -- he'll be twenty -- shoot, he'll be twenty three in a couple of days, and I don't --
R:  That's how old I am. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I'm forty.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, really?
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] And I definitely don't want him going to war, 'cause I don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know, [SIGH] he keeps talking about --
R:  And then --
L:  -- wanting to go protect the country and all that stuff, and I don't think -- I honestly don't have faith in my government or [SIGH] the military, [SIGH] I don't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- think so long of 'em. I think that's part of the problem is we butt our noses into too much that's not our business.
R:  Exactly, and we spend money everywhere.  What the heck. 
L:  I kn- and they can't --
R:  There's homeless people.
L:  Right, and they don't take care of people here at home, and that's what really --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- upsets me.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Do you think they'll reinstate the draft if we go to war?
L:  I hope not, because I'm gonna do everything that I -- [SIGH] I don't know if they --
