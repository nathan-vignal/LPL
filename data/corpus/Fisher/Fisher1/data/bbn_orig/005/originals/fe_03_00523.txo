L:  Hi, I'm Barb.
R:  Hi, I'm Chris, how're you doing?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, hanging in there. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] This is a little strange, huh?
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Um, I think, um, -- I don't know --I -- I would think, um, probably, s- s- s- -- uh, smoking.
R:  Yeah, I was -- I was trying to think about it in -- in terms of, you know, what hurt yourself and what hurt other people, so I was sort of thinking, you know, something like smoking, or -- or alcohol, or gossiping, you know, something like that.
L:  Yeah, gossiping's pretty bad, too. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Although I do have a -- sometimes I do tend to do that, but, um, yeah, I would say gossiping's pretty bad too.
R:  Yeah, I think that's pretty normal --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- especially for females. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah, uh, yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  We'll, you know, we- that's how we -- how -- sometimes how we communicate is talking about others, so --
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  Yeah, oh.
L:  I don't know, this is -- oh, um, where -- where are you from?
R:  Um, I'm living in North Carolina at the moment.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Wow.  How long have you been there?
R:  Oh, about sixteen years.
L:  Oh, wow, and what part of North Carolina?
R:  Um, the middle, um, of North Carolina --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- so, around Rawleigh, so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- my -- my dad was in the Navy, so I've lived lots of different places. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  This is actually the longest I have been in one place, so 
L:  Wow, yeah, I can imagine.
R:  Mm.
L:  So.
R:  Yeah, it's sort of strange talking to a, you know, a stranger about personal habits, huh?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I know, --
R:  I was like, "Oh, okay".
L:  I was li- I was wondering, as soon as it said personal habits, I'm like, "Uh-oh, are they going to ask me what my personal habits are and ?" [LAUGH] 
R:  Right -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right, I guess we're supposed to discuss -- discuss -- what did they say?  What -- what did we think was worse, so 
L:  Yeah, and -- and I would say, I don't know, smoking's pretty bad, drinking's bad, of course, gossiping.
R:  Yeah, I -- I would think, you know, everything that they listed is bad, because it hurts somebody, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if it's -- it -- whether it's your -- you know, yourself personally, healthwise, or, you know, other people --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- as far as feelings, and getting hurt, whatever -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- passing on things that shouldn't be passed on. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, and not exercising, that's a big one too, but I'm bad at that too.
R:  I -- I -- I -- I'm very bad at not exercising, I, you know, put it on my list of things to do, you know, all the time --
L:  I know.
R:  -- and it, you know, just sort of gets passed over --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- oops, don't have time for that. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, exactly.  I have -- I have two smaller kids, and so it's -- it's kinda hard to fit that in, but it is, you know, it's important, but 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's important to show your kids that you want to take of your- yourself, too.
R:  Yeah, I think that's -- that's probably [SIGH] very important in that time flies by, I mean, my kids are both in college, so it's a little too late at this point for me to  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, really, wow, wow, yeah.  That's -- yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] At this point they have picked up whatever bad habits I have given them.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ooh, boy.  So, um, yeah, um, [MN], you know what, I -- I actually, um, I used to smoke, and -- and my parents, you know, they were like -- my dad smoked too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and my mum is, like, so against it, and she's always saying, "You know, you have to -- you know, to take care of your body more and, like, don't -- don't smoke, it's bad for you".  So, like, that -- I mean, that's a huge problem, I think, for me.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Both of my parents smoked when I was growing up, and I used to, um, you know, like, if I had to write a report on something, I'd do it on, you know, like, you know, the horrors of smoking, and make them proof read it for me. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, really.  Did it work? [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Not really, not really.  I think eventually my dad gave it up, 'cause, you know, he just wanted to be healthier and my mum just got -- didn't give it up until she got really sick one day, and --
L:  Oh, gee.
R:  -- you know, couldn't smoke for a while, I guess, and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- finally gave it up.  But I kept saying, "You don't want to smoke in front of your grandchildren, do you?  Do you want them to smoke?" [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] really.  Wow, yeah, that's -- that's kinda hard.  But you know what, I think nowadays, like, um, like I have a girlfriend that actually smokes, but she just got pregnant again for the second time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she quits those nine months but, as soon as she has the baby, like, she's, you know, smoking again.  Of course, she doesn't smoke around the kids, but I'm, like, thinking, you know, if you can give it up for nine months, I think you could just --
R:  You --
L:  -- give it up.
R:  You would think so --
L:  But --
R:  -- because, I mean, it's not just [MN] when you're pregnant, I mean, they're around all that secondhand smoke, so you would think that would be bad for them.
L:  Exactly, and --
R:  I know I had a sister in law who was like, "Oh, I'm gonna smoke, it makes the baby smaller, and it'll be better for me".  And I'm --
L:  Oh, great.
R:  -- like, "Okay, and why are you having children?"
L:  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that's not good. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's not good, yeah, wow.  I can't believe that.
R:  Mm, I know, my daughter keeps saying, "Well, how do you give up things like caffeine while you're pregnant?"  I'm like, "Well " [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] You either do or you -- yeah, I know, that was a big one, but, you know, like caffeine, I don't know, like, I think that I -- I'm okay with a cup of coffee in the morning, and like, even when I was pregnant with my kids, my -- my doctor said, you know, "Don't -- don't worry about it if you have a cup a day --"
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's not going to be bad".  But, I mean, I would imagine if you -- like smoked a pot, or -- yeah --"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  --smoked -- or drank a pot a day, that would --
R:  Right.
L:  -- be pretty bad, but, I don't know.
R:  I guess so, I don't know.  I g- at this point in time, I couldn't imagine giving up my Coke, so 
L:  Yeah, exactly, yeah, it's kinda hard to just go, like, and give up the caffeine.  For me, at least, I n- I need at least a cup a day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I don't think that's so terrible -- terrible. [MN] 
R:  Right, well, I think all the things on this list are, like, things that, you know, people know they shouldn't do --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- but they tend to be things that, um 
L:  You just --
R:  I guess, uh, can be sort of addictive, or, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or you get, you know, you -- you -- you get something else out of them besides just -- just doing them, so --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- they're hard to give up.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  I don't know.  It would be nice if I could give up all those things, at least, you know, the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the, um, you know, or start doing the things that I should be doing, but I don't know. [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Mm.  So, how old are your kids?
L:  Um, four and two.
R:  Four and two?  Oh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I remember those days. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, they're -- actually my daughter is -- is the two year old, and she's now just starting to realise that she can fight back with her brother, so  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ooh.
L:  So, she's -- and he's not liking it at all, but I'm thinking, "You know what, he kinda deserves it". [LAUGH] 
R:  My -- my daughter was also the youngest and they're a little under two years apart, and she got to the point where she was very good at playing the victim and it took us a while to realise that she [LAUGH] was doing it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my God, [LAUGH] that's funny.
R:  She liked to get her big brother in trouble. [LAUGH] 
L:  Ooh, I -- I used to do that, too.  I had a brother that was two years older than me, and I was always getting him in trouble.
R:  Mm.
L:  Now, it's -- I don't know, he's probably -- he's probably like -- h-- h-- he's probably getting back me somehow, you know, he -- or he probably will --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- get back at me somehow --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- and get me in trouble for something.
R:  [MN] 
L:  I don't know. [SIGH] 
R:  I was an only child, so I was totally unprepared for -- [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, wow, yeah, that's got to be --
R:  Al- altogether.
L:  Yeah, I have three brothers and a sister, so -- and we sat -- and I was the youngest, so I was, like, always picked on -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it seemed like, so -- and then when I got older I got, you know, a little wiser, but  [SIGH] 
R:  [MN] Mm, so I wonder how -- how -- how much they want us to stick [LAUGH] to this topic.
L:  I don't know, --
R:  I don't -- how long can you --
L:  -- I -- I heard it --
R:  -- about, you know, um 
L:  Yeah, I don't know.
R:  -- things like overeating and smoking and gossiping.
L:  Yeah, I mean, it's pretty obvious, like, a- any of th- any of those things are, you know, bad things to do.  I mean, I think it's just all a matter of how much you do it, too, you know what I mean?  Like, if you -- I mean, if you have a glass of wine a day, I mean, I don't think that's bad --
R:  Oh, no, uh-uh.
L:  -- but, um, you know, you know, overindulging yourself on anything, you know, with fat, um  I don't know.
R:  I suppose even if -- with smoking, if you could keep yourself down to a cigarette a day or something --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it probably wouldn't be horrible either, but I don't --
L:  Right, and not -- and do it outside, or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, something, you know, anything like that.  I mean, an- and with, uh, [SIGH] I don't know, with exercise, I mean, as long as you -- I mean, as long you're like, not, like, sitting on your butt all day, I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think that you're doing something, but, I don't know.
R:  Yeah, running up and down the stairs twenty times a day [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly, with --
R:  -- mopping floors --
L:  With my kids --
R:  -- and all those kinds of things must count for --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- something. [LAUGH] 
L:  The vacuuming -- exactly, all those things, I think that's a little bit of exercise, but I think, yeah -- but I think if you're not doing anything at all, that's pretty bad, but 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I don't know, an- and -- I don't know what else they were saying.
R:  Yeah, I tried to jot a few down, but they sort of rattled them off pretty quickly, there.
L:  Yeah, I don't know, I just -- I just remember, like, smoking and overeating and all those things came in mind, 'cause of course they're not good for you --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but  [PAUSE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, this -- this is supposed to be for ten minutes, right?  I -- I think they're supposed to like, come in and -- and this is all recorded, too, right? [LAUGH] 
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I had -- I had heard that they come -- at some point they come in and say, you know, wrap it up, or something along that line, and let you know that you're getting at the end, so  [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Bu- is this your first call?
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Yeah, mine too.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
L:  I wasn't -- I wasn't even, like, I just got the pen today, so I didn't even expect to get a call today.
R:  I did too, and I'm like, "Okay, when did I say I was available?" [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I know, I couldn't remember either.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But usually, I say, like, in the afternoons, because my kids are in school in the morning, so -- so [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, I thought I had said two to five, but I wasn't sure myself, so  [SIGH] 
L:  So, um, let me see, what else?  I don't -- I can't even think what else that they were saying.  Um, I don't know.
