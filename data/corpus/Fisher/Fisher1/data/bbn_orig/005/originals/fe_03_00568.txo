R:  [LAUGH] Right on the Louisiana border.
L:  Oh, okay. [SIGH] 
R:  Down on the coast, you know, like, Gulf of Mexico.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, we were, um, in Dustin, Florida, over the summer.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's really nice. [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, it's pretty good, except for hurricanes coming.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  My mom lives right Outer Banks, so --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, they get, um, [LIPSMACK] tornadoes and stuff from the hurricanes and [NOISE] flooding from the tide waters.
R:  Mhm. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, we have tornadoes, but not too many. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Hey, you can have some of our snow. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] It's only, like, nine degrees here. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, my goodness, [SIGH] I wouldn't --
L:  What is it there?
R:  -- tonight's supposed to be one of the coldest nights of the year for us, it's --
L:  And what is it?
R:  -- going to get, like, twenty two.
L:  Wow. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's like shorts weather right now. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] We're not used to this, though -- to us it's just freezing.
L:  Yeah, there's snow on the Outer Banks which is -- they're not used to that. [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.  Oh, we never get snow.
L:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Never. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  Wouldn't know what to do if we did. [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] My daughter's name is Misty.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, I don't meet too many of those. [LAUGH] 
R:  Really? [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  I think when I was in highschool, there was, um, a couple -- I graduated with over five hundred kids --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] and so, in the whole school, there was over a couple of thousand, I think there were, like, three of us.
R:  [SIGH] You're kidding.
L:  Yeah, there were, like --
R:  Must be a popular --
L:  -- I think my --
R:  -- name down here then, because [SIGH] in Misty's class -- it's a really small town --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but there was about sixty of them to graduate and there was five Mistys.
L:  Wow. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  How old is she?
R:  Twenty four.
L:  Oh, okay. [SIGH] 
R:  How old are you?
L:  Thirty two.
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  I think it --
R:  Uh, uh, it --
L:  -- skipped -- it --
R:  -- wasn't as popular then as it was later --
L:  No.
R:  -- I guess, I don't know.
L:  Yeah, 'cause the only girls that were named Misty were younger than me when I was in highschool.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Your mum was just ahead of her time. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, actually it was my dad. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  It might be a southern thing, 'cause he was from, um, Eastern Kentucky. [SIGH] Who knows?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh. [SIGH] So, what all are we supposed to do on this?
L:  Okay, we're --
R:  Since I --
L:  -- supposed to like --
R:  -- don't even know anything.
L:  Yeah, it's, um, the reality shows we're supposed to talk about.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, and why we like 'em. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I like 'em because it's, like, real life.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And people just act so stupid, especially in the MTV ones 'cause they don't have to censor as much as the --
R:  Oh, I know, I've watched --
L:  -- other --
R:  -- the Osbournes --
L:  -- network, yeah.
R:  -- some, and it's, "Beep, beep, beep" a lot, [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] I don't know, you just get to see how other people live.
R:  Uh-huh.  You don't --
L:  And it --
R:  -- watch The Robber[?]?
L:  [SIGH] No.  I tried to watch it but I just [NOISE] not [SIGH] I don't know, I don't like the ones where everybody is like trying to be sneaky and backstab. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, I know, that's pretty --
L:  [SIGH] But I have watched that Joe Millionaire one, that one's [NOISE] pretty funny, knowing that -- he --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- doesn't have any money.
R:  Uh-huh, that's kind of funny. [SIGH] 
L:  I can't wait till the -- [SIGH] the end, when they find out for sure that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he doesn't have money. [SIGH] Even though, um, [NOISE] his, uh, [NOISE] butler guy didn't even know that [NOISE] he wasn't a millionaire [NOISE] until he was, like looking at a Mercedes or something in a magazine --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he was like, "Oh, I wish I could get that".  [SIGH] And the g- and his butler's, "Oh, well, why don't you get it?" and he's like, "I c- I don't have any money". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Oh. [SIGH] What about that one of -- where they all had to live in that house together?
L:  Oh, yeah, Brother. [SIGH] 
R:  What -- yeah, that's what -- 
L:  Big Brother.
R:  -- Big Brother, yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you ever watch that?
L:  [SIGH] I watch that a little bit, but [SIGH] I don't know.
R:  That was a bunch of backstabbers too.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Always.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, yeah.  That's -- I --
R:  I watched it a little, but I never --
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  -- really watched them all the time. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, I don't really like those too much.  I don't really watch the ones on the network.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Uh, b- it -- the, um, Bachelorette one, though, I watched [NOISE] that the first time, it was pretty good.
R:  The what one?
L:  [NOISE] Bachelorette.
R:  Oh, I didn't.  I missed that. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  And did you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like it?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, it was pretty good.  My eleven year old liked it too. [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  We were, like, flipping between that and some other show.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  You must have a little one too?
L:  Yeah, she's two. [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  Ooh.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [SIGH] She's a handful.
R:  [SIGH] I'll bet.
L:  [NOISE] She's supposed to be in bed. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, I don't have any grandkids yet, so ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, do you just have the one daughter? [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] I have another one that's --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  -- she's twenty one, but [LIPSMACK] -- 
L:  Yeah. Well, good.
R:  -- neither one of them's married --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- yet, so ... [SIGH] 
L:  Least they're waiting. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, they're both smarter than me.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I had Misty when I was twenty, so ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I was twenty when I had my first daughter.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I just have two.
R:  Yeah, mm, that's --
L:  What Kylie[?] --
R:  -- for the male.
L:  What?  What? [NOISE] Don't worry about it. [NOISE] [SIGH] Oh, they're nosey.
R:  [LAUGH] "I want to know".  I heard that. [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Oh. [SIGH] 
L:  Just go away, okay. [NOISE] It's none of your business. [SIGH] And to think that this is being recorded and others are going to listen to us. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  That's horrible. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  They'll never call us again. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Well, my first call I got last night [NOISE] and I wasn't home, I had to go get my husband from work, [SIGH] and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I didn't get it.  I didn't think they were going to call me again.
R:  [SIGH] You know, I was surprised it was so soon --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I just got my thing today with my PIN number.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was -- when they called --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I was really surprised.
L:  I just hope they really pay us. [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  Me too.
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] But if they don't, it's -- who cares [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I get to talk on the phone. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] But I sure hope we get --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- money. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, me too. [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] I'll do anything for money. [SIGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Oh. [SIGH]
