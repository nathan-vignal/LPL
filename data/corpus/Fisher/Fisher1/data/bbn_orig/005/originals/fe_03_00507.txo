R:  Hey, this is --
L:  [MN]
R:  Lee Fong.
L:  Hi.  Um, uh, myself I'm Anouja.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And --
R:  So, uh, where -- where you from?  Where -- I from China.
L:  Uh, well, I'm from India.
R:  Oh.
L:  Okay. And, um, are you in State College?
R:  Mm.  Yes.
L:  Okay.  Are you a student here?
R:  Well, I -- I'm -- I'm here in South Carolina.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Okay.  Um, um, so how do you find the weather here?  Um, isn't it warm- -- isn't it colder than last winter?
R:  Oh, yes.  Sure.
L:  Um, I think we've had some, um, freezing temperatures and for a long period of time, and we had a pretty mild winter last year so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN]  Do you fall sick during winters?  Change of weather and things like that?
R:  Well, uh, as for -- I, myself, I had, um, I just feel the -- the weather is getting colder, as in nastier.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, I mean, we get a colder winter.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I -- I -- I have -- I -- I think it- it's okay for me.
L:  Oh, okay.  Because, um, where I come from, you know, um, we don't see such cold, um -- we -- we don't see such cold temperatures, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN]  I tend to fall sick, you know.  Especially, catch a cold or cough or a sore throat or something.
R:  Oh [MN] --
L:  And, well, um, I usually keep some, um, syrups handy to help me with cold and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What do you do if you fall sick?
R:  Well, uh, I think it depends because I -- I barely caught a cold.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, have you recovered from your ...?
L:  Oh, yes.  Um, I think, um, most of the times, like, uh, for cold and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't like taking a medicine.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because I feel, um, the medicine kind of subsides it and it causes more congestion.  So ...
R:  Yeah, maybe.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, when I'm suffering from a cold I like to, um, do some +cold therapy, like maybe take a steam with some Vicks in it or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN]  Or, you know, probably inhale some -- something like that, you know.  Just mix it in hot water and inhale it so it opens your air passage and everything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because I think --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um, medicines really don't help me when I'm suffering from a cold.  And, um --
R:  Yeah, that maybe a good way, I think.  
L:  Yeah.  Because, you know, i- when you just take the medicine it kind of just so -- it causes more congestion.  It makes you -- it makes it more difficult to breathe because, you know, your air passages, and all I feel --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it just kind of gets blocked and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- stuff like that.  But --
R:  And you get addicted to -- to the medicine.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, well when I get coughs and stuff [inaudible] I think I prefer to gargle and things like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, so take some hot water, saline water, gargle.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that helps me a lot, I think.  So, do you believe in medicines?
R:  Oh, [MN] ... except for -- for really big troubles.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yes.  For -- for -- for little stuff like a cold --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- some cough.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't take any m- medicine.
L:  Oh, okay.  So --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And generally if you get a fever or something?
R:  Oh.  Yes.  I might be -- you -- you might -- I mean -- m- I might need some medicine --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for a fever.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Well, um, usually what happens with me with, you know, like change in temperature especially temperatures as low as sixteen degrees, fifteen or twelve degrees --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, you know, if I expose myself to the cold a lot I tend to get a headache that's [inaudible] --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know, like my --
R:  It normally happens, yeah.
L:  Yeah, so ...
R:  Especially if you suffered from the windy weathers.
L:  Yes.  So I tend to get a headache, so I have to keep my ears and my head warm so that I don't get, you know, sick because then that makes my whole system just, you know, from bad to worse.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that's -- that's one problem that I feel.  And plus, I think, um, the other thing with such low temperatures is that, uh, you know, my fingers they tend to become numb.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Fingers and toes tend to become numb.
R:  Oh, yes.  Yes.  
L:  So, I just -- I think I need to just, uh, you know, wear lots of, um, woolen socks and gloves all the time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I think I'm not so used to the [LAUGH] temperature here but I'm kind of getting used to it, so ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, how's the weather in your hometown?
L:  Uh, well, we get some thing, like in winter we -- we rarely go down below like, let's say forty.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Thirty eight, thirty five.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, that's the maximum that we reach in -- even in the peak winter when we -- I mean, that is the place where we stay.  
R:  Mhm.
L: Where there are places in India that do get snow fall in the winters.  But, well, we are far from there.  So ...
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  Yeah, so ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um ...
R:  As for me I have got used to the colder weathers actually.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mm.
L:  How long have you been here?
R:  Well, I've been here for two years.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [MN]  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  Well --
R:  So how 'bout you?
L:  Yeah.  I- I also came in, um, fall, two thousand one.  So, it's --
R:  Two thousand one?
L:  Yes.
R:  So almost two year.
L:  Yeah.  So this is my second winter here.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I remember nicer winters, uh, [inaudible] warmer here.  
L:  Mm.
R:  Because I barely wear the heavy clothes, but this winter I -- I get to wear some --
L:  Exact --
R:  -- clothes.
L:  Yeah, because, you know, this winter's more cooler than la- -- and another problem [LAUGH] that I feel here is driving around in snow.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  That's really difficult.  How -- do you find that difficult?
R:  Well.  We -- we barely get snow here.  So even --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- although it's cold it, uh, during some times --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but we barely get some -- and one bigger advantages here is that once there is snow --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there's no school.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's good then.
R:  [LAUGH]  That's good.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's good.  We don't have it here because then everyday would be a holiday here.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes.  So, is it snowing right now?
L:  Yes.  It -- oh, well, it did snow, like, day before yesterday.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, uh, the snow that piled up hasn't still melted, so the temp- -- I mean, it's like still cold.
R:  Yes.  It's really cold, e- especially after the snow.
L:  Yeah.  So ...  We do get flurries off and on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I mean, I think, yeah, every second day, every third day we do get some flurries or some sleet or some snow.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So it just, you know -- it's -- it's -- I think the temperature has never, uh, gotten beyond twenties [LAUGH] you know, in the past --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- week, ten days, so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's how it -- 
R:  Usually when the snow is melting then it's getting freezing cold.
L:  Oh, very much.  And that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- is the time when my fingers, I can't write.  M- many times I can't drive.  I can't feel much --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because my fingers, they just go numb.  A- --
R:  Do you take any, mm, anti +freezing medicines?
L:  No.  [LAUGH] 
R:  For your skin?
L:  Are there any anti freezing medicines?  I don't know.  Are there?
R:  Yes, I guess so.
L:  Oh, I'm not aware of any.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Uh-huh.
L:  No.  I don't take that.  I just like to keep -- I mean, I just like to wear thermals inside and just --
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  -- cover myself a lot.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, as much as possible so that just my eyes are exposed because --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I'm like, quite sensitive in the sense I -- I would turn red and, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just feel numb all over.  So I have to take care of my -- myself [LAUGH] in the winter.  So ...
R:  Yeah.  I guess the better thing, uh, to, uh, to take care of you is that, um ... minimize your time outside.
L:  I think so.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But then you know, student life is such that you just can't stay indoors.  You have something or the other all the time happening, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, uh, what are you studying here?
R:  Well, I'm studying chemistry.  
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  So, um, well my -- my major is psychology.
R:  +Psychology?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh-huh.  That's quite different, right?
L:  Yeah, well ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Not so different but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- yes a little interesting.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, I mean, that's what I was always passionate about, so ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I -- that's why.  But I never knew that the place I'm coming to, that's State College Pennsylvania, it's going to be so cold.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, huh.
L:  So, otherwise, I would have, kind of, uh, maybe selected down south, Texas or something, you know.  I would rather stay -- 
R:  How about Florida?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, Florida [inaudible] I'd like!  [LAUGH]
R:  Weather ne- --
L:  But I'm not sure --
R:  Weather there never going down.  You know.
L:  Ye- yeah.  But I'm not --
R:  Below thirty.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but I'm not sure whether they have good schools there for my --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, subject.
R:  Mhm.  Oh yeah, that's right.
L:  Yeah, so I'm not, like, really --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- sure about that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, mm, have you ever been to State College?
R:  Sorry?
L:  Have you ever been to State College?
R:  Uh.  No.  I -- I haven't yet.
L:  Okay, um.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, well --
R:  I have made a couple of travels to Washington, to New York, like that.  But I haven't stay in Pennsylvania.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Never.
L:  Okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, we just like, maybe, four hours or four and a half hours drive from --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- New York.  So ...
R:  Oh, yes.  Yes.
L:  Yeah, so ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And -- I mean, it's a -- it's a small town though.  It's a -- it's a university [MN] -- a university town. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  With -- I mean basically students here, we don't have very much of --
R:  Oh, that -- that'd be nice.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  That -- that would be nice.
L:  Yeah, because, you know, we have some forty thousand students on campus.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  And, I mean, during the -- during holidays, like winter break or summer break, I'm in this cold -- this --
R:  Oh, you have winter breaks?
L:  Yeah, we do.  We do have, like, around two weeks of winter break.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, that's important I think.  [LAUGH]  Because everybody needs to, like, kind of go back and --
R:  Is that around the Christmas and, uh ...?
L:  Yeah, we have holidays like, um, mm, starting twentieth, somewhere around, 'til the second week of January.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, so
