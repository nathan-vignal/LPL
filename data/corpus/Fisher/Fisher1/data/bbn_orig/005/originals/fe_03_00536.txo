R:  Hey, I'm Eric.
L:  Hey, this is Barapi[?].
R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hello, yeah.
R:  Hey, what's up?
L:  Oh, I'm doing good, how are you?
R:  I'm pretty good.  Are you, um, I -- are you speaking with an accent?  I've -- I've got a handless phone on, I can't really hear too well.
L:  Oh, is it -- give me a second, all right?
R:  Sure. [PAUSE]
L:  Okay, I'm talking through a cellphone.
R:  Oh, okay, that's -- that's better now, I went to a different room.
L:  Oh, okay.  Are you able to hear now?
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's it's better.  I -- I got out of the noisy place.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, okay.
R:  So, is -- is this your first call?
L:  Aha. Uh-huh.  How about you?
R:  Yeah, this is my first call, so I'm not really sure, uh, what we're supposed to do.  I guess we're supposed to talk about, [SIGH] uh, which of those things is the worst.
L:  [SIGH] Yes, about, uh, smoking or alcohol or gossiping, whatever you feel is the worst among those, you need to talk about that, I suppose.
R:  [SIGH] Okay, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  ,-- well, you want me to go first, or do you want to talk about it first?
L:  Anything would be fine, your wish.  Actually, where are you from?
R:  I'm from USF, uh, University of South Florida, it's in --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- Tampa.
L:  Tampa?  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Ahah.

R:  And you?  Where are you from?
L:  [SIGH] I'm from India.
R:  Okay.  Are you in the United States now, or is this a worldwide project?
L:  Oh, actually I'm in the United States right now, I'm in -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- Washington DC.
R:  Oh, I see, okay, so, you're in -- you're in DC?
L:  Ahah.
R:  [SIGH] Okay, that's cool. [SIGH] How old are you?
L:  Me?  Aged twenty three.
R:  Oh, okay, that's nice.  I'm nineteen. [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] okay.  What are you doing?  What are you studying?
R:  Um, criminology, actually.  I'm --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- studying to, uh, go into law enforcement.
L:  Oh, oh, oh, okay, that's great.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Okay, let's go about the topic today.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay, sure.  Um, [SIGH] I don't even remember all those things that they said.  I think, uh, I don't think -- I think --  I g- I -- I guess I'll do mine by a process of elimination since there were so many.  Um --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- drinking alcohol, obviously, I don't think is really a big deal, although drinking excessive alcohol, I guess, is, uh --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- is pretty -- is -- i- it can be harmful.  Especially those people around you, if, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if anyone becomes violent or abusive --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, that's definitely not a good situation.  But, uh, overall I don't think that's a major, [LIPSMACK] um, problem.  [SIGH] I think smoking isn't, uh, too healthy [SIGH] since it hurts the people around you, like, regardless of, [SIGH] um, you know, what you do, you know, your attitude -- unlike alcohol [SIGH] and, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it really serves no purpose and it's just a waste of money --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, basically.  That's my view of smoking.
L:  Oh, okay.  Like among all of these, what do you find the worst one? [LAUGH] 
R:  The worst one, I'm -- it's, um, [SIGH] it's kind of a toss up, I mean, none of them are -- are atrocities, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I guess, uh, I guess smoking is -- is probably one of the worst [SIGH] with, um, [LIPSMACK] maybe not exercising because, um, you know, I think everybody should exercise.  I'm a big, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like fitness --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, activity, stuff like that.  But I -- I would probably say smoking because that hurts the people around you, and that's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, um, you know, it's -- it's plu- prolific in our society and, you know, and, uh, I -- I think that's probably one of the worst. [SIGH] What about you?
L:  [SIGH] About me?  Oh, I feel coming to business[?], smoking, alcohol and all.  First thing I don't like is smoking at all.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Yeah, and also they asked a question about gossiping too, that also I don't like at all.  It's a big, uh, mistake people do by gossiping about others and --
R:  I know.
L:  -- make the feelings hurt. [SIGH] So, gossiping also I don't feel is good.  And coming to drinking alcohol, it's okay because, in the present society, alcohol [inaudible] like that.  If they drink a little, [SIGH] that's fine, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [MN] greater going to extremes is too bad --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it's just ruining so many people's lives [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's a different story.  But if it's [inaudible] turning[?] it, that's fine, that's n- that's not --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  -- a big thing.  [SIGH] And, uh, about smoking, it should be [SIGH] the way that [inaudible] I feel like we shouldn't, uh, like, [SIGH] support smoking, people who smoke --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because it's not at all good for the people around --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and also [SIGH] like, the person in point of health.  So, I don't like smoking much and --
R:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] Yeah, me either.
L:  And about gossiping, also I don't feel good about that because --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  --it hurts the other person's feelings a lot.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, [SIGH] so, I -- I see so many people are, like, getting depressed about, uh, gossiping --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because [MN] we feel low when somebody talks ill about us, so [SIGH] I don't like gossiping too and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- smoking, uh -- uh --uh, no -- no -- not -- not -- not my --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] I guess I don't view gossiping as bad, but that's because I'm a guy, probably. [SIGH] 
L:  Well -- [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, I jus- I just view it as, uh, like, human nature, where --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people are just going to talk about other people behind their back.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it's -- it is bad, mm, but people are going to do it regardless, you know, and there's [SIGH] I'm unlike -- like, smoking or alcohol, it could never be [SIGH], um, you know, made illegal or anything [LAUGH] like that and I just guess it's just, you know, something that people have to deal with, in my opinion.
L:  Yeah.
R:  For better or worse.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  Like, uh, [SIGH] uh, the place where I work, uh, it's, uh, like, non, uh, smoking building, where I work --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- because, uh, they had so many problems before with people who smoke and all --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so -- so now it -- no-one is allowed to smoke in the building --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, it's a non-smoking building, so it's --
R:  Cool.
L:  -- good. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] and, uh, like [SIGH] uh, we have our Friday parties --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where people will go like, uh, to a nearby restaurant or hotel or something like that and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there people enjoy -- they have a good Friday [LAUGH] sort of thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] so, there they have -- their fags, they have alcohol and all, but that's okay when it's there their personal celebration or something like that, but not, uh, when we are around people.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, yeah, or people that don't, like, appreciate it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, or approve of it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] Well, that's cool. 
L:  So --
R:  That's cool.  Yeah, we have pretty similar views, it seems like, as far as less smoking, you know, is -- is probably one of the least healthy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, activities that they listed.
L:  Yeah, many people die because of smoking too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because of -- they get cancer or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like that.  Lung cancer and, uh, [SIGH] uh --
R:  Yeah, and even people that don't smoke -- that are just around people that do smoke.
L:  You do?
R:  No, no, people that around people, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people that don't smoke, that are around people who do smoke, can also get those diseases [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  -- and cancer --
L:  -- true, that's true.
R:  -- and stuff.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true, so you need to be careful.  Do anybody in your family have this habit?
R:  [LIPSMACK] No, no.
L:  No. that's good.
R:  Yeah, and yours?
L:  Ah, no. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  No.  Like, in India, like, women don't smoke.  That's a big advantage --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and very few men, uh, smoke.  They do -- it's very hard to control them, but that's okay --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if there was some point or that [inaudible] they would so.  But women, rare, it's like --
R:  Yeah
L:  Like [SIGH] like ten people in hundred people smoke.  Like women don't smoke at all in our country.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, [SIGH] it was -- it's weird in college, like, as soon as I came to college, like, everybody in college smokes it seems like, you know, compared --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to high school.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, it's how old you are, [inaudible] for a fun night thing --
R:  Yeah, I know --
L:  -- without smoking.
R:  -- it's weird.
L:  It's weird, all right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  Like, there's a guy, uh, like, uh, he, uh, does his internship at the place where I work --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and [LIPSMACK] he's very young, like he's just fifteen year old, and for every [SIGH] ten minutes he goes outside --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the building just to smoke.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, so, it's so strange, some younger people are habitually [inaudible] their firstor[?] smoking and --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Yeah.  So, Eric, how do you find Florida?
R:  [SIGH] I like it.  It's, um, you know, I've -- I grew -- I was born here and I grew up here and I have -- I haven't left for more than, you know, maybe a month or two [SIGH] at any --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- one time, [SIGH] uh --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- you know, so it's [MN] [LIPSMACK] it's what I'm used to and, you know, therefore I don't see the nice things, [SIGH] uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that probably other people from up north would find [SIGH] you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it is -- it's pretty much warm all the time, like, I g- I was wearing [SIGH] like a teeshirt and shorts today, [SIGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, you know, and I -- I know, up north, people are probably [SIGH] bundled up.
L:  Ahah.  Oh yeah, so I am too.   -- I'm talking to a future lawyer?
R:  I'm sorry? [NOISE] 
L:  I'm talking to a future lawyer.?
R:  Oh, um, maybe -- maybe down --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- the road.  Right now I'm just looking at, uh, law enforcement, uh --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, police work.?
L:  Ahah ha.
R:  Probably being a cop, but maybe in the -- maybe in the future I'd like to become, uh, an attorney.
L:  Ooh, a cop?
R:  Yeah, maybe in the future, not right away.
L:  Yeah, you are still too young. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah. [SIGH] 
L:  So, how quickly are we going to end this call?
R:  [SIGH] I [LAUGH] I really don't know.  I -- I know v- you know, very -- probably l- much less than you do about it.
L:  Ahah.
R:  I -- I mean, I haven't gotten an email or anything.  I got an email and that's how I got my PIN, and I think that was -- that was it.  I guess we just say bye. [LAUGH] I'm not --
L:  How did you come across this? 
R:  -- really sure.
L:  How did you come across the survey?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  How did you come across this?
R:  [SIGH] Um, one of my friends sent me the link --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- to, like, sign up.
L:  Mhm hm.
R:  How did you -- how did you find o- out about it?
L:  Same -- same too, same too.  Yeah, so, I -- I, like, the email doesn't mention like, uh, but this, uh, like --
