L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Um, my name is Jennifer.
L:  Hi, Jennifer, my name's Hazel.
R:  Hi.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, hi there.  I, uh, agreed to talk on this, uh, topic today, I -- but I've only actually watched one episode of Survivor and --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- I'm n- not a avid, uh, viewer of TV, per se.
R:  Oh, interesting.
L:  How about yourself?
R:  I actually love the reality shows --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] -- and I like them a lot better than regular shows, you know, like Frasier or -- or other kind of sitcoms and dramas.  Um --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- I'm actually a sociologist, and so I think that's kind of why I like to watch them, because it's just -- every one is a study in human behavior --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- and so that's what I study as my job.
L:  That's wonderful.  I'm a psychologist, I'm a research, uh, a -- a --
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  -- social psychologist.  We do research and get people to change their behavior [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, so I am interested in teaching and things like that and I find that -- I find -- what I watched the bit of -- the snippets that I've watched, I find it quite frustrating [SIGH] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- uh, I -- as are soap operas, they're absolutely inane, [SIGH] um, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, um, the -- the reality TV, um -- um, I guess I haven't watched enough of it.  I'm -- I'm finding this new one, this idea about Joe Millionaire --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- [SIGH] uh, that's -- that's [LAUGH] been quite tantalizing.  Have you watched any of that?
R:  [SIGH] I have, actually, I've been watching that.  Uh, I thought it was a pretty interesting thing for them to base it all on a lie and so I just wanted to tune in and sort of see how they were going to make it work, [SIGH] uh, and I actually have kept watching.  It's been pretty interesting, um [LIPSMACK], y- yeah, it's -- y- it's a really strange idea, and kind of demented, but --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, uh, you don't -- I -- you don't feel so bad for the women, because you know that they're there just to get all this money --
L:  [LAUGH] Gold diggers.
R:  -- and so, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right.  So, uh, it's interesting to see [MN] that, you know, it's formulated as [SIGH] love versus money and, is he going to find someone who cares about him enough to not care about the money and the deception, and [SIGH] it's -- it's a -- it's an interesting one, I don't know.
L:  [SIGH] I guess seeing people, uh, live, uh, you know, make online decisions, uh, um, [SIGH] my sister's addicted to -- was addicted to Real Life, the MTV show [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, I never saw that one.
L:  No, I've seen bits of that and it -- that is really, can I say dumb?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh, the dialogue that y- I'm -- okay, so, I'm fifty one years old --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- so I'm watching twenty one year olds negotiate --
R:  Right.
L:  -- relationships so, m- that's probably part of it. [SIGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  Even though I -- I love MTV, uh, VH1, I love all that stuff, the music, but, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] that, I guess it's, um, a -- a d- a different stage of my life [SIGH] and I guess I shouldn't be so frustrated with these kids --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- as they, uh, flounder through, [LAUGH] you know, these new discoveries. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, well --
L:  Um --
R:  -- you know, it's not only age, though, because I'm only twenty five, and I think that some of the ways that they interact with each other are -- are just insane on --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- any of these shows where there are young people --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, I mean it -- it -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's pretty ridiculous, I fully agree.
L:  They're pretty cheesy, I mean, some of the stuff they say and -- and, you know, they're playing for TV [SIGH] --
R:  Right. [MN] 
L:  -- and so you say, "They can't be so vacuous in real life, please tell me" but --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- but of course we've all met people that are full well that vacuous in -- in --
R:  Right --
L:  -- real life.
R:  -- right, absolutely.
L:  So, um, yeah, I was -- I watched almost thirty years ago w- before you were born Jennifer --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- the Loud Family, the original reality TV --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- which was fascinating.  Every week they'd come on for, I guess, for an hour on public television, [SIGH] and there was this whole family that took about all of, you know, twenty minutes to get used to the cameras [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if that long, and then their lives started to unfold and -- and unravel. [SIGH] And that was -- that was fascinating, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- now, you know, I was just re- that was real, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in fact one of the -- the w- son came out, he was gay.  The w- the husband and wife, I think they got divorced, the -- the, you know, the kid -- the young girl is standing around saying, "Jeeze Louise" [SIGH] you know, all this --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and on TV too --
R:  Yeah, wow.
L:  -- so, but now, I was just reading something in the newspaper about some contestants, a reality TV, it was, um, it was Class Reunion --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, actually, uh, as I suspected, [SIGH] uh, they -- they found a bunch of people, not all of them even graduated in that year [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but they coached one of them, "Okay, we want you to play the part of the nerd who always after the -- the class beauty [SIGH] --"
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, you know, blah, blah, blah, [SIGH] and, you know, this person who happens to be a -- a -- a college professor [SIGH] uh, said, "No, I don't think I'm going to do that" you know? [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  So, a lot of it is hokey, you know?
R:  Right, right.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, um, but -- but you're enjoying, you're going to be -- now how -- how much longer?  I know Joe Millionaire started, [SIGH] uh, is it still running?
R:  Uh, it is, yeah, there's another episode on Monday, I believe, so if you wanted to check it out, it's on at nine, uh --
L:  Nine o'clock, huh?
R:  Well, uh, Eastern, I don't know where you are, but, uh, [SIGH] uh, yeah it's -- I don't know, they d- they d- haven't even said how long it's going to last, because --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they kind of had to play it by ear, since they didn't know if the secret was going to come out, uh, along the way.  You know, it's unlike something like Survivor where they have a routine and they know when someone's going to get voted out each time and so they [MN] know exactly how many episodes they're going to have, so --
L:  [SIGH] Wait a minute, now, this y- this was filmed a while back, right, just like --
R:  Well, yeah, I suppose that's true, so I guess --
L:  I mean, like everybody in the country knows, I mean, I'm -- I'm thinking that we're watching things that were filmed a while ago --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and we all are hip to it, but these women were deceived, like two or three or six months ago --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] and they're going to get to be full well, you know, [SIGH] uh, right on nationwide TV, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- "Oh, whoa, I'm -- I'm married to like a pauper -- a guy that makes about nineteen thousand dollars a year". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  -- or "I'm -- I'm going to be married to " [SIGH] yeah.  So, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, I think, uh, I think -- I think it's interesting, I'm glad -- I'm glad people have the guts to get up there and do it, uh, that's --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- that's one thing. [SIGH] But it d-
R:  [SIGH] Well, maybe guts or maybe st- stupidity or something.  I mean, I can't imagine wanting to be on some of them.  [SIGH] I could imagine wanting to go on something like American Idol, where it's giving you a legitimate opportunity --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in theory --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- but, uh, you know, some of these other ones, like Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire, and all those kind of things, I just -- I -- [MN] it's humiliating --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't see why you would go on something like that.
L:  I think so, but, you know, you figure you've been dating a bunch of jerks and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- oh, well, maybe you'll be on TV, get to be famous and actually meet somebody sexy.  Is this Joe Millionaire, is he kinda cute, does he have charisma or something?
R:  Yeah, he's cute.  He seems like a really genuinely nice guy actually, he's not the kind of person that you normally see on these shows --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who is normally really aggressive or --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, n- n- needs the limelight or -- he just seems like a really nice --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- person, actually.
L:  Ahah.  Well, that -- at least that, you know, somebody will end up, maybe, with a nice guy if they can handle it. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, well the question is are any of the women nice, because they don't really seem like it. [MN] 
L:  They don't, they --
R:  No.
L:  -- don't really seem, uh, they're kinda like barbie dolls I would imagine, huh?
R:  Yeah, and just, you know, talking all about if they need a man with charm and elegance, and he didn't like his foie gras and so one of the girls was all disgusted -- he didn't have any taste, and you know, these kinds of people.
L:  Oh, that's -- uh, they sound a bunch of -- oh, they sound a bunch of gold diggers, see, that's --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- one thing.  [SIGH] they didn't put -- put any, uh, you know, real, uh, [SIGH] homespun Rebeccas and Emilys in there or anything --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I guess, huh?
R:  [SIGH] Or it maybe that, you know, he let me them go earlier because they weren't as aggressive in really wanting to bag the man.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, he s- chooses them?
R:  He -- he doesn't choose the original pool, but he sort of gets to know them a little bit each week, and then he has to choose some to stay on and some to go.
L:  Oh, I see, so he does --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have a say in this as to how things are going to turn out?
R:  Yes.
L:  [SIGH] So he could be missing the -- the good ones and choosing the, uh, platinum, you know, c- plated ones, huh?
R:  Right, and I think he has done that with a few of his choices.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, well.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Oh, well, well I wonder if they put, um, the, you know, the Jerry Springer and all that crap in the, um, [LIPSMACK] in the reality -- are --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- those reality show, or those ?
R:  I don't know.
L:  I don't know how much reality th- th- they're, you know, blessed --
R:  Right.
L:  -- with either.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] Um, but those people certainly see- you couldn't imagine that [SIGH] you know -- well that's s- that's s- how -- how on -- why on earth would you go and air your dirty laundry [SIGH] on TV, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a- again, there's a whole lot of pumping up behind the scenes saying, "Well, go ahead, say that.  Yeah, go ahead, start this fight.  Go ahead, p- put it up there that she slept her, you know father, da, da, da, da, da". [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, I -- well, I think it's partially just the opportunity to get a free trip to some other city and stay in a nice hotel and [SIGH] y- y- you know [MN] probably if all your friends know that you're just going on there to tell a funny story, then --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- maybe you don't care.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, I'm sure that's all of it, so that explains why the people go on, but what explains why people watch? [SIGH] I mean [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you're watching 'cause you're a sociologist, you're fascinated w- with -- with human behavior, so am I.  I simply don't have time to watch it [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, uh, like I said --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- these people drive me crazy.  Why do you think it's so popular?  These are, like the number one shows in the US.
R:  It -- yeah, it's probably just voyeurism --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that, you know, the ability to see someone that is worse -- supposedly worse of than you, you know --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- they're -- everyone's cheating on them or -- or whatever their problem might be, and then you can get a little boost and --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- feel good and smart and [SIGH] everything like that.
L:  Well, see -- see that's what I would definitely would credit those, uh, like, uh, you know, bottom -- bot- uh, bottom end shows, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the Jerry Springers and all that.  These people, you know, look like they've just rolled out of their trailers this morning [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, um, uh, the people, like, you know, Who Wants to -- I don't watch them, but I've seen the Darva Congers etc --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- you know, and they look like -- they look like they, you know, they, mm, [SIGH] they look like a different class of people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, um, [LAUGH] in th- in th- indeed the, uh, the -- the -- the Kathy Lee and this other n- numskull that's talking with Fill- Phyllis Re- -- Fill- Fill- what ever his name is.  Philbin, --
R:  Regis Philbin, yeah.
L:  Regis Philbin, [SIGH], you know, pretty -- [SIGH] pretty vacuous, basically chit chatty Kathies, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but actually, you know, somewhat attractive, looks like they could have a life if they really worked at it. [SIGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  So, I d- I d- um, so, um, but people are able to say, "Jeeze, what an airhead, jeeze, what a loser, jeeze".  I'm, like, I guess the -- the -- there's one that is -- is on a boat -- where they put a bunch of single people on a boat --
R:  Right, Temptation Island.
L:  -- some of -- so, you know that, okay, --
R:  yeah.
L:  -- Temptation Island, so, who's going to hold on to their boyfriend and who's going to get, uh, thrown over? [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Right. [MN] 
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  That's just really, y- you know, those are the ones I don't get because I don't understand how you get so emotionally involved in something that's so contrived --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, I mean, if you you're going on a boat to stay together with your boyfriend, and if you do so then you --
