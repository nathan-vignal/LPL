L:  Hi, I'm Kim.
R:  Hi, I'm Kat[?], um --
L:  Pat?
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Okay.
R:  Hi, um, out of those choices, probably drinking alcohol excessively would be on the --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- top of my list.
L:  Oh, okay, if you say alcohol excessively, I would probably have to agree, although, I'm [SIGH] death on gossip, so 
R:  [NOISE]  No, I don't know.
L:  I guess it depends on if you're sitting on your couch at home drinking alcohol [LAUGH] excessively, or --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- driving a car. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I guess -- see my problem is I look at [SIGH] if you're drinking you're going to be going out driving and, you know, then you have a problem.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  And if you're always drinking [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  Gossip.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, I don't know, a little bit here a little bit -- I guess excessively --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, what --
R:  -- might be a problem, but --
L:  -- kind of gossip is it?  [LAUGH] [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- you can always, you know, walk away and not have to listen to it.
L:  That's true too, and smoking, you know, well, [NOISE] you're killing yourself, and it's expensive and [SIGH] --
R:  But you're --
L:  -- overeating.
R:  -- not hurting someone else. [SIGH]  That's m- 
L:  Well, that --
R:  -- my problem --
L:  --depends on --
R:  -- with the alcohol is that it --
L:  -- if they're breathing that or not.
R:  You know, the jury's still out whether or not that's [SIGH] really true.
L:  Yeah.  Overeating and not exercising, well [SIGH] that's your choice.
R:  Well, that only hurts you.
L:  Yeah, that doesn't hurt anybody but you.  But, yeah, I don't know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's the hardest question I think I've ever heard.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  It's like, "Well which is worse?  Well, hm".  After seeing a few lives messed up by alcohol, there --
L:  A few?
R:  -- I have a problem.
L:  Well, I've seen some lives messed up by smoking, I've seen some lives messed up by alcohol.  I g- guess it depends.  I don't have any problem with anybody drinking as long as they're [SIGH] doing it themselves.
R:  Yeah, oh --
L:  Yeah, the family, I mean, are you spending your money on cigarettes and alcohol instead of diapers?
R:  [LAUGH]  Then we have a problem, [SIGH] other than that --
L:  Yeah, I've --
R:  -- I mean  [SIGH] 
L:  That's a little --
R:  Well, they come up with --
L:  -- too hard a question.
R:  -- some strange questions. [NOISE] 
L:  And I can't remember the other choices.
R:  Gossiping.
L:  Exerc- gossip?
R:  It seems to me if somebody's gossiping, then you just walk away, you don't have to listen to 'em.
L:  It's kind of a vicious thing to do though. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, but I've done it. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, so have I. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  We had somebody at work --
L:  I've also been --
R:  -- who was --
L:  -- the recipient --
R:  -- really bad.
L:  -- of it, though, and it's not quite as -- [SIGH] I guess it depends on if it's true gossip or not. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, there's that to look at too, because sometimes it's just malicious gossip and then -- even a little bit of malicious gossip is not good.  [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] No, that pretty much --
R:  But if it's --
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  We need more details.
R:  [LAUGH]  Okay, folks who is doing the questions.
L:  Either that, or I can just moralize anything away, I guess it doesn't matter. [SIGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] I think anybody can moralize just about anything.
L:  Well, that's probably true. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I mean, because the other people will say, "Oh, it doesn't matter if you get drunk every night if you're not married and, you know, as long as you just stay at home". 
L:  Which is probably true, I guess [NOISE] if it's only hurting you, I guess it doesn't matter [SIGH].  It doesn't matter if you smoke four packs of cigarettes a day if  [SIGH] you're the only one and the money's not supposed to be going some place else.
R:  [SIGH] Can you imagine an apartment, though, if somebody smoked four packs of cigarettes a day?
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  Oh, God.
L:  I've probably been in apartments where people smoked four packs of cigarettes a day.  So, it actually [SIGH] -- course I've been in apartments where they drank a lot too, and [SIGH] booze don't smell much better.
R:  Mm, I can't even imagine four packs a day, and I used to smoke.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  It's funny --
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] how things change once you have children.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  Yeah.
R:  Like suddenly nothing is good any more, no, can't do any of that.  [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE]  Let's see -- overeating, exercise, smoking and drinking excessively -- I guess excessively is the keyword there. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, 'cause anything in excess is a problem.
L:  Yeah [MN] food in excess is overeating -- [SIGH].  Laying on --
R:  Although --
L:  -- the couch to excess, that's -- that's exercising. [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, but you have to look at how much overeating are they talking about.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, are they talking about the --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- people that sit at home and they're four hundred pounds and they don't --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- get off the couch besides to, you know --
L:  Or are they talking about --
R:  -- shovel some more? 
L:  -- y- thanksgiving dinner? [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess that makes a little difference too.
R:  And --
L:  When you get a lot --
R:  -- lack of exercise, well, tsk, come on, okay, and right now it five below outside, I am --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- not going outside for anything.
L:  Nine below with the wind chill here.
R:  [LAUGH] Where are you at?
L:  And now it's snowing.  Pennsylvania.
R:  Mm.  We're in South Dakota.  No, s- it's not snowing, because it's too cold to snow, it's thirty two below with the wind.
L:  Ooh.
R:  Yah.
L:  No, see --
R:  So, they said --
L:  -- I was going to go -- I was go swimming at the Y tonight, actually [SIGH] since I have a problem with overeating, [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm not leaving my house today. [SIGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, it's like, "Oh, go outside?  For what reason?"
L:  And now I'm looking and I don't think that I'm going to walk outside after swimming, I think I'm going to sit home on my couch, and call --
R:  And they told --
L:  -- somebody up and gossip.
R:  -- us tonight [MN] before the wind we should get down to twenty two below.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  Those are the nights the dog just looks outside and says, "I don't need to go, it's okay --"
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  --I want my box".
L:  My dog doesn't go.  The cats still cry to get out, but hey. [SIGH] 
R:  My dog has a little box and she'll go in the garage --
L:  Well, that's --
R:  -- in the little box.
L:  -- where I found the cat the other morning [LAUGH].  The --
R:  She just -- 
L:  -- dog, no --
R:  -- didn't --
L:  -- the dog's up in the bedroom.
R:  Mm.
L:  She's not stupid.
R:  No, our dog's not dumb, either and she's so funny --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- she goes outside wearing -- we have a little, um, Sharpei, and she goes out with a little flannel hat on her head.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, no, we have a big [SIGH] German Shepherd Great Dane [SIGH] and she still doesn't go outside.
R:  Dogs are funny.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Remember like [LAUGH] --
L:  And the cat's --
R:  The cat --
L:  -- sitting at door --
R:  "I have a fur coat".
L:  -- wanting to go outside now.
R:  [MN] Well, this is the first and only dog we've ever had, so it's funny.
L:  Well, this is our first dog [SIGH], I'm kinda waiting for her to -- [SIGH] she's thirteen.
R:  [SIGH]  That's old for a bigger --
L:  Yeah, she shouldn't --
R:  -- dog.
L:  -- still [PAUSE] [SIGH], yeah, that's what the vet --
R:  Well, hopefully --
L:  said. [MN]
R:  -- we shouldn't have a problem with exercise, we have dogs. [SIGH]
L:  Not my -- my dog doesn't walk [LAUGH] much any more.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  The dog has a problem with overeating [LAUGH] and exercise? [LAUGH] 
L:  Well that's -- well, the vet said don't worry a bout it any more. [SIGH]  [LAUGH]  I asked her last time 'cause I felt kinda guilty but -- she has arthritis real bad now.
R:  No, and at that age [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there's no sense in pushing 'em.
L:  The vet said, "She's lived, leave her alone".  [SIGH] 
R:  My cat passed --
L:  Perhaps you'd like a beer --
R:  -- away and she --
L:  -- and a cigarette.  [LAUGH] 
R:  My cat was seventeen and she was the same way, she got -- started getting secretary spread as she got older --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and when I took her in and the vet's like, "W- Well, she's old".  I was like, "Yeah, but she's only getting it there in the hips.  What is this?". [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that -- my c- my dog because I'm like, "She just doesn't like to walk anymore". And the vet was like, "You know what, you won't when you're ninety either, leave her alone. [SIGH]  She's done".  Now I just wake up every morning and make sure she's still breathing.
R:  Oh. 
L:  Huh, baby, mm?
R:  [SIGH] They're still babies though.
L:  Yeah, she still acts like she's two half the time.
R:  Mm, my cats are probably like "Hm, lazy, come on".  Mm, our --
L:  Do they come on with a --
R:  -- dog's funny.
L:  Do they come on with another question?
R:  Mm, no, only one, [MN] they want us to still figure out who's the worst people.  I don't know, anybody who does anything to massive excess. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know what their idea of excess is though?
L:  Yeah, well, is excess --
R:  I mean, is it excess --
L:  -- a cake?
R:  -- when I'm baking cookies and I keep eating one per dozen?
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Must make sure each batch is good, right?  [SIGH] 
L:  When I eat my half of a large pizza, is that excess?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Is it okay 'cause I only do it once a week, I don't [SIGH] --
R:  It's good to know --
L:  I mean on Thanksgivings --
R:  -- we're not the only ones.
L:  -- my God, I'm a glutton.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's like, it's -- it's winter, I'm supposed to gain weight --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it keeps me warm.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But, mm, I don't know.  To me any excess -- as long as you're not hurting somebody else.
L:  [NOISE]  I guess I was --
R:  You know?
L:  -- th- I guess I would have to go, if I had to choose one, [NOISE] [SIGH] I would choose alcohol, just because the minute you say drinking excess, you start thinking about people driving [SIGH].
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]  Even if they're not driving, they tend to get nasty and rude and -- once they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- get to -- start to excess.
L:  They tend to lack judgment, which leads to a whole bunch of other behaviour, so if I had to choose one I would [SIGH] -- if I had to choose just one [LAUGH] I would choose that.
R:  You notice they didn't give us drugs.  Now, if they gave us drinking and drugs together then we could just go, "Boom, that's it, bye, see ya".  [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah, did they say drugs?
R:  I don't think so.  [NOISE] 
L:  I don't think they did either.  [SIGH] No, I think --
R:  It's funny that they put --
L:  -- alcohol.
R:  -- they put overeating, and not exercising in there.
L:  Yeah, those two go together.  Who cares if you overeat all the time if you're, you know, [SIGH] [LAUGH] jogging twenty miles a day.
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, no, but that can hurt your body, though.
L:  Okay, jogging was a bad thing.  Walking --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- twenty miles a day [LAUGH].
R:  [SIGH] But you know the people that --
L:  Non-impact --
R:  -- over exercise --
L:  -- aerobics.
R:  -- over exercise until they stop their periods?
L:  Yes.
R:  I mean, you're hurting your body just as much that way.
L:  But you don't do that -- you don't do that if you're eating enough then.
