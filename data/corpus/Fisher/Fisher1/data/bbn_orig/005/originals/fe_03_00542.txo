L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Mary. [SIGH] 
L:  Stacey.
R:  Hi, Stacey.
L:  Hi, Mary. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] [MN] Uh, are you into speech therapy?
L:  Um, no.
R:  No.  Do you know anything about it?
L:  [NOISE] Um, no, I can't say that I do.
R:  I know a little bit because my husband had Lou Gehrig's disease and, um, [SIGH] it's very difficult for them to talk, so he had to go to speech therapy for a while, so I know --
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  [MN] W-
L:  I had a cousin, um, that had to go through it, but I -- I really didn't know too much about it.
R:  Mhm.  It's -- it's kinda difficult, but it's good and it's good for young children, you know, that are going to school.  A lot of times, they can't [SIGH] say the words right.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  Mm. [LIPSMACK] Um, what else were we [LAUGH] supposed to talk about? [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah.  They asked about what we thought was worse --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- gossiping or --
L:  Mhm.  I think, uh, gossiping.
R:  Microwave[?]. 
L:  I think that was the first one, that --
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  -- was the worst.  
R:  Gossiping is bad, I think, and it really hurts a lot of people.
L:  Yeah, it really does, and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- people feel mayb- I guess it makes them feel good when they can sit in a group and talk about -- [NOISE] talk bad about other people.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] But it, um, it's -- it's [NOISE] --it's very evil, I think.  I think it -- it was the most evil thing th- that he listed.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And it can do so much --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- harm, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And spread like wildfire. [SIGH] And hurt people that they don't even know what's going on.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I really believe that.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Where do you live?
L:  In Louisiana.
R:  Do you? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I live in Nevada. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Ahah.  
L:  We're ducking a -- a serial killer over here right now.
R:  You're what?
L:  [NOISE] We have -- we have a serial killer on the loose.
R:  Really?
L:  [NOISE] Yes.
R:  You're kidding, has he killed a lot?
L:  No.  Um, well, they've -- they've linked him to four deaths in the last year, um, but they have, like, twenty five unsolved [SIGH] in the --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- last ten years that they don't know if he was involved with any of those.
R:  Oh, my God.  Did they catch him, or ?
L:  No. [NOISE] All they have is a sketch.  They just had one eyewitness, [SIGH] um, it's going to be on America's Most Wanted this Saturday.
R:  Really?
L:  Yes.
R:  I'll watch it.
L:  And, um, the last girl that was killed, I actually worked with her.
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  Um, so if it's like -- I mean, it's like, it's a state of frenzy right now down here.  Everybody's, like, scared to [SIGH] go to the store and [SIGH] um, just, you know, any -- needs to go anywhere by themselves, women are taking -- self-defense classes right now are booked until, like, March [SIGH] and, um, it's -- it's -- it's very crazy down here.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  So, just everybody's in a constant state of paranoia, [SIGH] and --
R:  I go-
L:  -- they're actually, um, kind of -- uh, a lot of the families and -- and people that are scared down here, they're -- they're going to, like, Washington DC and, [SIGH] uh, trying to get in touch with CNN and stuff, because it's really not getting a lot [NOISE] of national coverage. [SIGH] We're getting very little national media --
R:  I hadn't --
L:  -- involved.
R:  -- heard -- I hadn't heard about it.
L:  Oh, right, and, um, [NOISE] they're -- still say, you know, they're about to get more involved, someone's going on primetime, uh, have a tentative, um -- it's tentatively scheduled to air an interview with one of the parents of the girls, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:   -- that, you know, that was killed, and, um, they're having t- they had, um, [LIPSMACK] they have a woman missing right now, she's been missing for a week from --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- the same city that I'm in.  They don't know if -- you know, they haven't found anything -- everything's [NOISE] up in the air.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  But it's just crazy down here. [SIGH] You're probably hearing about it, I would say, within the next month after the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the national people get -- really get their hands on it.
R:  Mhm.  I'll watch it, America's Most Wanted.
L:  Yeah, it'll be on, uh, Saturday.
R:  Saturday?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I know, it's [SIGH] crazy what these people are doin'.
L:  I know.  I know.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I don't what all we're supposed to talk about, do you?
L:  I don't. 
R:  They --
L:  I just -- you did it on the internet?
R:  Ahah.  Did you? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, it said, ah, they were supposed to ask, like, our opinion about stuff.  I guess that was the only question they had.
R:  Yeah, they s- they said, um --
L:  And what do y- you -- you get a reward?
R:  You're supposed to, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- your name go in and they draw or something, yeah, ahah, or you get so many points or something and you can buy stuff or whatever.
L:  And what was the name of the website?  I plum [NOISE] forgot.
R:  It was Fisher or something, wasn't it?
L:  Yes, yeah.
R:  But, when they -- when they called on my phone they said that the subject was speech therapy and we're supposed to talk about speech therapy. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um --
L:  Well, why did it ask about gossip?
R:  I don't know why they asked about that and everything else, I don't know why. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Um, talk [LAUGH] about either one. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, it's -- it's -- this is my first one, so --
L:  Mine too.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm all new to this, I don't know.  I was hoping somebody would know what they were they were doing, [LAUGH] 'cause --
L:  No.
R:  -- I don't.  They'll probably never pick me again. [LAUGH] 
L:  So, do they, like, record us, and then 
R:  I think so, ahah, I think so.
L:  [NOISE] Hm.
R:  But I -- as far as gossip, I think it's so malicious, you know, and myself I have [NOISE] done that.
L:  Oh, well, we all -- we all have, you know?  I mean, we [MN] all have.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, of course, yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  It's --
R:  Yeah, you know, [NOISE] you can't help but do it. [NOISE] 
L:  It's -- I think it's kind of human nature, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  You find out -- you k- kinda can't help [NOISE] it sometimes.
R:  Yeah, just -- 
L:  You know, and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it -- and we don't realise --
R:  Spread another little story. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, we don't want like -- realise how bad it really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really hurts people sometimes.
R:  Mhm.  And then, on that -- on speech therapy, my [NOISE] -- I have a niece and she has a little boy and [SIGH] [NOISE] the minute he was born, he had a stroke --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] and, um --
L:  Oh, god.
R:  -- it's really weird, you know, a- and b- because of that [SIGH], uh, [NOISE] one hand is all doubled up and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and his feet, like, [NOISE] his -- he walks on his toe -- I mean --
L:  How old is he?
R:  -- he bends his toes under [NOISE] you know?
L:  Oh, God, how old is he?
R:  Well, right now, he's two years old and they've --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- been trying to get all kinds of help for him.  [NOISE] He -- but he doesn't say anything, he doesn't -- can't talk, he has no [SIGH] sp- you know, he needs speech therapy real bad.
L:  Oh, I'm so sorry --
R:  And, um --
L:  -- to hear that.
R:  -- nobody's doing anything for him or anything, and [SIGH] it's just, [SIGH] [NOISE] I'm gonna try to get on the internet [NOISE] tonight and see what -- I have dogs [NOISE] I'm sorry --
L:  That's okay.
R:  -- see what I [NOISE] -- you know, what I can find out for 'em.  They also said that they thought he might have that +cerebral palsy, [NOISE] [SIGH] and, uh --
L:  Is he going through a neurologist --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm sure, huh? [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] No, you know, the doctor won't refer him to one.
L:  That's crazy.
R:  Yeah, I know.  He --
L:  He needs to see --
R:  -- referred him --
L:  -- a neurologist.
R:  Ahah.  He referred him to a -- a bone doctor today. [NOISE]
L:  A bone doctor?
R:  Ahah.
L:  Okay.
R:  [SIGH] But --
L:  He needs to go to a neurologist too, if, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you have a stroke.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, and see what's going on up there, you know. And why he can't -- why he can't talk and [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, he just -- the only thing he can say is, "No" you know, although he's round other --
L:  Do y'all have the Kid Med programme, do you know?
R:  The what?
L:  Kid Med.  I don't know if that's something just in Louisian- it's like Medic Aid. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] Um, it's separate from Medic Aid, I believe.  I- it -- it is separate from Medic Aid, um, but it's Kid Med and it's a free therapist bank, I don't know if it's just the state of Louisiana, but that they [SIGH] um, [NOISE] it's free, and they check, um, [NOISE] usually, like, the charity hospitals do it, or the health units [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and they just [NOISE] check all the [NOISE] development, overall, like, [NOISE] everything, they do a full screen, um, and they refer them to -- you know, if the development [NOISE] is not on track, they'll refer them to the appropriate doctors.
R:  Right, that's great.
L:  And --
R:  I'll tell her about that, and she can check into it.
L:  Yeah, look into that --
R:  [SIGH] Um --
L:  -- 'cause they might -- they might also have it over there.
R:  Yeah, because her doctors won't refer her to a neurologist or anything.
L:  Yeah, that baby needs to go to a neurologist.
R:  Mhm.  You know, and 'specially  you know, I can't understand why a doctor has let it go on this far, you know, from being a baby they knew it --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- you know --
L:  Does she have insurance?
R:  [SIGH] Uh, no, she [NOISE] doesn't have insurance.
L:  That's probably why they won't refer her then --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's how they are. [SIGH] I work at an --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- answering service.  I answer for a lot of doctors, I know how a lot of 'em operate [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and that's the one p- it's -- it's a good [NOISE] -- it's the system, it's the way it works, you know?
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  [SIGH] Um, does she have Medic Aid, or d --?
R:  She has Medic Aid, ahah.
L:  Okay, yeah, she needs to definitely call Medic Aid [SIGH] um, and [NOISE] um, see if they have Kid Med or any programme like it that checks the development [NOISE] [SIGH] and see if she can get referred, or even call 'em and say, "Hey, I [NOISE] need to be referred to a neurologist.  You know, my baby's two years old and blahsy blahsy". [NOISE] So -- I have Medic Aid too, and, um, I have a five month old [SIGH] and [NOISE] Kid Med is awesome.  You know, they -- they check everything thoroughly, very --
R:  Really?
L:  -- thoroughly.
R:  Huh. [SIGH] They -- they live in Texas, you know, so that's right next door to you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, I know Medic Aid is nationwide. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, so [SIGH] I -- I'll tell her.
L:  Mm-kay.
R:  [SIGH] You know, I don't whether we should talk about gossip [SIGH] or we should talk about speech or what?  [LIPSMACK] I wish they would have told me a little bit more
