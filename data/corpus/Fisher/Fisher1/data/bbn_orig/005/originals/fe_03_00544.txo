R:  [LIPSMACK] Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Karen [LAUGH] how are you?
R:  Hi, I'm Sarah, how are you doin'?
L:  [LAUGH] I'm fine.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  This is weird, have you done it before?
R:  No, I have not.
L:  Uh, no, me either, so --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- first time.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Sounds good.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, personal habits, huh?
L:  Mhm.
R:  There were a lot listed, I don't [SIGH] --
L:  I don't really know what I think is worst.
R:  Mm.
L:  Partly because, um, [PAUSE] I -- I think all of them except gossiping --
R:  Gossiping?
L:  -- um, [SIGH] well, gossiping affects other people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whereas all the others affect only the person themselves --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- I think.
R:  So, do you think it's worse to affect other people than it is to affect yourself?
L:  [SIGH] Yes.
R:  Mhm, really?
L:  [MN] [SIGH] 
R:  But don't you think in some sense that by hurting yourself you're hurting others?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, [SIGH] I'm not sure.  In w- what way do you mean?
R:  Um, [SIGH] I -- I just think, like, [SIGH] um, off the top of my head, the smoking example, um, like, you're hurting yourself in the sense that, you know, you're caus- you could cause yourself cancer, or you could, um, pay a lot of money for it, uh, it could be like a very addictive habit, um, but at the same time you can be hurting others, because one, you know, like, as a non-smoker I hate walking behind people that smoke, like, I can't stand that [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but then, at the same time, like, if I had, um, [LIPSMACK] like a friend or family member or a partner or someone that I was close to, I wouldn't want them to be hurting themselves either.  So it kinda like goes both ways that you're hurting yourself but, at the same time, you're hurting others.
L:  [SIGH] Well, disregarding the fact of -- of y- o- of -- of a dislike for somebody else smoking because you don't like the smell of it, [SIGH] um, that, you know, a family member of yours smokes, it's kind of his choice, her choice, to -- to do that and, um, [LIPSMACK] it -- it -- then you're disliking that they're doing something that you don't want them to do --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- rather than [SIGH], um, their habit actually directly affecting you.  Um, there's -- [SIGH] what you said about, uh, their smoke affecting you, but, um, [LIPSMACK] it's more really, um, [LIPSMACK] th- that becomes a -- a -- a losing of control, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of somebody else, you know?  [SIGH] Where i-, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, when -- if -- if you're gossiping about somebody, you're actually entering directly into their life and being, um, [SIGH] critical of them in some sense or another. [SIGH] Um, I -- I confess I'm saying this, and I still gossip about [LAUGH] my friends --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, [LAUGH] --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- [SIGH] but I just, you know, so much more [SIGH] interactive, um, in a way that, [SIGH] um, you're choosing to -- to shape the value of somebody else, by -- by the things you're saying, [SIGH] because you're not just thinking it to yourself, you're sharing that with somebody else and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that personal view -- so it's going backwards and forwards and [SIGH], um, a way of touching somebody else's life [SIGH] and -- and also a third person and -- and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- then perhaps fourth or fifth, you know, that -- that gets a lot bigger than, [SIGH] you know, say, not exercising.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, [LIPSMACK] I didn't think that exercising was [SIGH] one of the --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- ones that I'd find, [SIGH] um, like the most disgusting or whatever it was that we were sus- like the personal habits that I would least like, [SIGH] because I mean, I don't know, it -- it -- it's their choice, like you were saying with the smoking, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, sure, would I like people to exercise and be healthy?  Yeah, but [SIGH] I mean, people are going to do things to harm themselves and others, um, whether it's drinking or smoking or gossiping, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I guess that's just another one of those [SIGH] things I don't I think I criticize as the top one because lots of people are just -- I mean, there are lots of people that don't enjoy exercising, and they do it for the wrong reasons, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they might not even enjoy the activity, but they're trying to fit, like, social norms --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- and, you know, being a certain figure or size or something like that, and it's not --
L:  [SIGH] That's very true, they're -- they're giving in to pressure, uh, by the media, and -- and, um, that -- that's not really a good thing. [SIGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, in a wider sense, um, [SIGH], the lack -- I mean, I -- I exercise a lot and, I -- [LAUGH] I enjoy it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but [SIGH] in a -- in a wider sense, uh, coming from the country I come from --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it -- a lack of exercise is going to shorten your life, so, [SIGH] um, because i- i- if you're an unexercised heart, you're an unhealthier one than [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than -- than -- than and exercised --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, [LIPSMACK] where we have socialized medicine that's paid for, um, [SIGH] out of everybody's taxes, then [SIGH] the people that don't exercise are actually, um, [SIGH] going to be using up more of my taxes on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, medical care, for example. 
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I can see that.
L:  [SIGH] Because they're -- they are not going to do that, and I think, what you were saying about, uh, having, um, you know, say a member of your family smoking, a member of your family that wasn't exercising is then going to cause somebody else worries, so I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- suppose, [SIGH] fr- from that point of view there's, um, [MN] -- it's worse --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or it's -- it's a -- it's not such a good thing.  But really I'm so into personal choice [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'd -- I'd rather people choose whether they, [SIGH] uh, they're going to shorten their life by four or five years.  And let's face it, you shorten the [SIGH] worst end of your life; it's not the best end of your life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- now, do you?
R:  Yes.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  I -- I -- I often talk with -- 'cause I work with children, and -- and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I discovered that, you know, they smoke or they drink, and often, like, you know, just from my perspective, I just try to allow them to see where I'm coming from [SIGH] and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- how much I enjoy life, and I'm -- and I know, like, there are facts that, you know, if you smoke, you're going to decrease your life, or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] if you don't exercise you're not going to be as healthy, and, like, trying to get youths to understand that, [SIGH] um, I mean, maybe it's just my flaw and I see like, not just the here and the now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think lots of youths these days think that, you know, "It's right now, or it's never going to happen" and they --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- don't care so much about the consequences later.
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Yeah, [LIPSMACK], but I think that's youth of all ages, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think we're [MN] -- e- everybody goes through that, uh, very, um, present and only in the -- in the now, um, stage of -- of your life, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] um, I think -- I think you're right, w- w- we act by example and try and persuade others to -- to -- to, [SIGH], um -- and look at the benefits, but [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] -- in the end it is, I suppose, totally about personal choice, and that if you inform people, [SIGH] um, then they have a choice, so what you were saying that you do --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, then I think that's, um [MN] an important thing to give somebody a wider choice.  Perhaps if they grew up in a family that never exercised or where everybody smokes, then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] they don't have a choice, um, and you'll wipe -- they don't have a model, an idea, um, it doesn't occur to them that that's a -- a choice particularly that they can take, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think you're doing a -- a good thing in exposing people to things like that.
R:  Thank you.
L:  Mm.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I -- I find it, um, that I had some of them thinking, "I was going on one direction, but I -- I lost it". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But just about, like, it -- it's hard to get to the point where, I mean, I think at times people think, you know, their way's the right way, it's the only way.  And when people are in, um -- ex- like trying things, or doing things that, [SIGH] in your eyes you see as wrong --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that, um, you know, they're harmful to either themselves or others, and, it's difficult to let them make their own decisions --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- because you have your own beliefs that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, you're -- you know, you're -- you're doing this to yourself, you're doing this to others, [SIGH] you know, you try to make improvements but -- and th- and it's the person's individual choice and that's, like, so difficult to give up.  But 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, that's what every parent has to face when their children grow up, isn't it?  Like their --
R:  Mm
L:  -- [SIGH] decision to go as they please.  But my mum still tells me. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] And she's seventy.
R:  Wow.
L:  [SIGH] Um, yeah, well, that means that I'm older too.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, so -- but I -- I think, going back to the total question of what they asked us to discuss, was there another one?
R:  [SIGH] Um, [LIPSMACK] obsessive eating, maybe?  Something --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- about eating?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think that was -- 'cause I think it was along the, like, same lines as exercise, eating, alcohol --
L:  [SIGH] That's right, yeah.
R:  -- smoking and gossiping, that I can remember. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Oh, and lying.  H- was lying one?
L:  Lying?
R:  Um, no, maybe it was gossiping, maybe that's the --
L:  Gossiping, yeah, I think that was the only different --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Um, [PAUSE] [SIGH] I suppose, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] yeah, overeating, hm -- [SIGH] I mean, how much effect can that have on somebody else?  Again it goes back to that, well, if it's a member of your family and they going to die of it, you know?
R:  Mhm.
