R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, this is Crystal.
R:  Hi, this is Rachael.  So, which do you think are the worst? [NOISE]
L:  Mm, I'd say --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- depending on the person, I'd say smoking.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I -- I think smoking too, but it does depend on the person, 'cause [SIGH] I guess overeating could be worse if you were a diabetic. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But smoking, I think, affects others around you.
L:  Well, alcohol --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- could be really bad too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So.
R:  But they didn't say, like, alcoholism, did they?  They just said drinking alcohol.
L:  They just said drinking alcohol.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  But some people can become over excessive on that too.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  And just --
R:  But I think probably smoking is the worst, 'cause there are warnings out and [SIGH] health violations, you know, health -- health codes and things like that, like -- and, um, I don't know.  Where are you from?
L:  I, uh, I live in North Dakota.
R:  I live in South Florida, and in South Florida we're doing, um -- we've just passed a law saying that eating establishments [SIGH] are not allowed to have [SIGH] [NOISE] if they're, um -- they're not allowed to have smoking sections any more, uh, like, as of [SIGH] I think it's September two thousand three.
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] We -- we just went through, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- this last year where --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- i- in public, um, restaurants and stuff that they're not allowed to smoke.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, right now, North Dakota's try- um, the rep- um Republican side of our, um, House, um, is trying to ban, um, smoking in the state.
R:  The whole state?
L:  The whole state.
R:  Wow.  I mean, I think that's really hard, that's like prohibition --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, like, I don't know, I think that could cause it to be, you know, like -- and also that's hard because [SIGH] th- that's kind of almost a, uh, federal law, like the age limit, I guess, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the age limit with drinking. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, I know in Canada, it's nineteen.
L:  Yeah, here it's twenty one.
R:  Yeah, here it's twenty one. [NOISE]
L:  But the -- it's like they're trying -- but see kids are smoking way earlier than that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and so they're trying to just smash it out completely.
R:  Wow.
L:  And, uh, once -- well, see, if it becomes illegal --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they're going to want it more.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They've --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- gone and illegalized it.
R:  Yeah, that's true also; it makes it, like, more appealing if it's something illegal.
L:  Mhm, and right now, they're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, with other drugs --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's like, "Okay the only way that this is going to stop --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is if we make it legal". 
R:  [NOISE] Right, or decriminalize it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  But --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- well, it -- it seems like [MN] here it's -- smoking and drinking is like the worst out here, because --
R:  Yeah, we have a lot of --
L:  -- we have --
R:  -- smoking and drinking too.  Like, I think it's -- I also lived in North Florida --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think it's worse in South Florida, I guess 'cause we're a big city and maybe there's more people and I notice it more --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but like, even if you're outside, I feel like you can't get away from it. [SIGH] If you're sitting outside and somebody walks [NOISE] by you, you still smell the smoke and it still gets in your lungs.
L:  Yeah, it will.  
R:  [MN]
L:  In North Dakota, it's [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the town I live in, which is minor, is probably --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot smaller --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- than [LAUGH] your type of cities --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's -- it depends on who's outside and so forth and not -- I don't think that the majority smokes.  I think most of 'em don't smoke --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but you still have problems with it.  Like, when you go out to a bar, 'cause the bars still -- the bars are still allowing them to smoke in the bars.
R:  Right, as long as it's a standalone bar?
L:  Yeah, and as long as that there is circulation going on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with the, um, fans and stuff --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so okay for people who don't smoke.  But I found out that most people who smoke usually end up at the bars while the other ones are hiding outside 'cause they don't want to go in. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  'Cause like --
R:  How y- [SIGH] --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  How young do you think kids are starting to smoke up there? [NOISE]
L:  Up here?  Um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Six, seven.
R:  Really?  I mean I would --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- say, like, maybe high school, which is like probably fourteen. [SIGH] Um, but also middle school which would probably be like eleven at the -- at the [NOISE] oldest.  I mean, I could be completely wrong and that's just like my observation.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But we have, like, the laws have gotten more strict lately. [NOISE] They'll send in -- the cops will hire kids [SIGH] and they'll send them in to try to get to, like, see who's selling minors cigarettes and things like [NOISE] that.
L:  Yeah, they do that here too. [SIGH] Um, it's like -- but in h- like, my husband, he started smoking when he was, like, six years old.
R:  Wow.
L:  I've never touched a cigarette in my life [SIGH] and my brothers, they both smoke.  They started smoking when they were like, I'd say ten, nine.
R:  Yeah, my grandmother started smoking when she was eleven, but that was in the thirties.
L:  Mhm, and --
R:  And it's completely ruined h- I mean she has no kidney function any more, she's on dialysis three times a week, so 
L:  Mm, yeah. [SIGH] Well, I'm trying to get my husband to quit -- quit because a lot of his problem is in his lungs [SIGH] and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in his metabolism, in that, with, um, smoking [SIGH] you can damage a lot of those things, so we're trying to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- find ways that he can get back in -- or in order with his health and stuff.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] Uh, like, i- i- if you stop now, there's so much -- it's so much easier to combat whatever diseases may come of it.
L:  Yeah, [LIPSMACK] but it's, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- being -- being an older woman, like, uh, in your nineties or whatever, if you quit smoking at that age, you could die within a couple of weeks or poss-
R:  Right, 'cause you're dependent on it.
L:  W- well, I had this gran- this, um, this, um, grandmother who smoked throughout her whole entire life and then, two years before she died, she quit smoking.  They found out afterwards that she had osteoporosis and so forth, and her heart just, like, stopped on her, and I just, like, "Okay". [SIGH] You know, I would rather her [MN] stayed smoking if that was going to happen, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  She would have been somewhat heal- happy about it, but she knew that she had to stop.  
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- but I think helped --
R:  -- and I mean, you know, she didn't have anything else wrong that might have, you know -- there's so many different factors?
L:  Yeah, it -- plus it messes with all your system.  I have had many relatives die, um, because they've -- they smoked, they quit, [SIGH] they found out they had cancer or whatnot and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a couple of years later they were dead.  I used to -- I -- as a child I just stayed back from that, I was like, "No". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, don't even start if you can help it.  The easiest way to quit is to never start. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you have any kids? [NOISE]
L:  I have one daughter.
R:  Do you smoke around her?
L:  Um, she's two years old and we -- and with my husband and stuff, he doesn't -- I ma- make it that he does not smoke around her.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So that [MN] -- and he's supposed to be smoking outside.  So, that way she has no contact with the smelling it or anything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Unless she's, [MN] like, co- she comes really close to him, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Well, you got -- I grew up with my mom and my grandmother and a lot of their friends smoking and, like, they smoked inside the house a lot, and I have asthma because of that, but then later on they all -- they moved it outside.  Um, like, we still allow people to smoke on our porch, you know, but not in the house or [NOISE] in the cars.
L:  Mhm.  I think, um --
R:  Um --
L:  -- it's the case that you see a lot more people smoking outside now, because of the people who've decided not to smoke.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  And so you're -- 'cause they don't want, um, any diseases to happen --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or whatever and they've become more understanding -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I think, like --
R:  Yeah, especially, like, now they have all those truth commercials out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] and I think those really help a lot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Educate people, but --
L:  Yeah, they have -- they have one here that says, um, because of North D- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they tested all of the North Dakota kids and stuff and what they were doing and what they were not doing and so forth --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and you know, most of the -- most of the kids lied on their tests -- on their --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- quizzes.  And the -- it -- one of them says, um, oh, what is it?  It's, "If you, um -- if you think that your peers are doing it, you're wrong, they're not doing it.  The census, blah, blah, blah, has -- has said that they're not doing it.  So, that doesn't mean that you have to start doing it".
R:  This is the thing that --
L:  -- [inaudible] 
R:  -- most kids said that they don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so that [NOISE] you shouldn't do it either.
L:  Mhm, and then, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I was just like, "You know, everybody knows that -- that whatever these kids did or took, um, on the test or whatever for the census, most likely they lied, because a lot of kids at nine and ten are smoking, drinking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, building[?], um, [MN] or doing pot and so forth, um --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I find that --
L:  drinking, or --
R:  -- in South Florida, a lot of kids would rather smoke marijuana than cigarettes.
L:  Mhm.  Well, right now, in North Dakota, we're having this big, huge, um, thing going on where -- Ford County[?] where I live is, like, the biggest meth county, so far.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They've, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- shut down a lot of meth, um  oh, meth --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, labs and stuff like that.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And they even had to arrest a kid who was, like sixteen years old because he got a, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a thing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of pot fr- um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- from the airport.  It was like, a ten thousand --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- dollar thing of pot.
R:  Wow.
L:  It's just like, "Okay". [LAUGH] And they w-
R:  [NOISE] And you think an equal number [NOISE] of kids are doing drugs and smoking, or are you think, like, smoking leads them to doing drugs? [NOISE]
L:  Well --
