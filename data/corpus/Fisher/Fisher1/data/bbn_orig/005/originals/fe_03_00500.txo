R:  Sharon.
L:  Hi, Sharon.  I'm Kim.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  I'm in Washington State.
R:  I'm in Ill- Illinois.  Just --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- north of Chicago.
L:  Wow.  Okay.
R:  Have you done this before?
L:  Uh, I've done two surveys, yeah.  This'll be my third one.
R:  Okay.  This is my first.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, do you ask me the questions?
R:  Uh ...
L:  No?
R:  [MN]  Um, do you have the, uh, uh, [SIGH] disorder in the winter?  Is that what they ...?
L:  Um, I think it's just about general illness.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Self will.
R:  I thought maybe it was about seasonal, uh, illness [several inaudible words].
L:  Oh, no.  Yeah, I know what you're talking about.  No, I don't think it's about that.  I think it's just, like, what did it say?  What do you do to keep yourself well?
R:  Uh, exercise and take vitamins.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And ...
L:  And drink a lot of water.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yeah.  Um ...
L:  And ...
R:  Wash my hands a lot.
L:  Yeah.  There you go.  That's a good one. [SIGH]
R:  And, um, just extra vitamin C.
L:  Have you been sick this year?
R:  Yes.
L:  You have?  Yeah, I had the flu for about a week.  I don't know if it was the flu but it felt like the flu.  [LAUGH]
R:  I had a sinus infection for over a month, and everybody else in our area also did.  
L:  Mm.
R:  When they got -- this was in November and December.
L:  Yeah.  Could be weather related too.  You know, because it's colder back there and ...
R:  Right, damper.
L:  M- yeah.  We have the rain out here so ...  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yeah, um.
L:  [NOISE]  So are you a -- are you a college student or ...?
R:  Oh, no, no.  
L:  You're just a participant?
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, see, so am I.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I've never been linked to a participant before.  This is the first time.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Usually they link me to a s- -- a researcher that asks me the questions.
R:  Okay.
L:  But, obviously, it took -- did it take your PIN number?
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, it took mine too, so they must be recording, so we're okay, I guess.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Um, [MN] I just noticed, um, I belong to a health club and just about everybody at the health club stays healthy during the winter if they work out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at least twice a week.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Compared to people who don't work out.
L:  Right.  
R:  [MN]
L:  I think that makes sense too.  Build your immune system and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ...
R:  And extra juice.
L:  Right.
R:  And such but, um, the vitamin C. and then as soon as I get a cold, um, I'll take the Coldeze[?] tablets.  
L:  Mm.
R:  And they seem to help.
L:  Right.  It may help boost the immune system a little bit.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH]  What was that last question they asked?  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I can't remember.
R:  [SIGH]  About how often we've gotten sick is one, and then ...
L:  Well, maybe, yeah, maybe that was it.
R:  Um, i- if you go to the doctor you have it a week and you still --
L:  That's right.  The seven --
R:  -- the cold is seven days.  Um ...
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  No matter, uh, I don't think you can take anything, um, the doctor would give you that will get rid of the, uh, cold anyway.  Antibiotics won't work.
L:  Right.  So you're just --
R:  No doubt.
L:  -- wasting your time because it's viral and ...
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  And generally I end up getting sick when I do visit a doctor's office or a hospital.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Simply because there are so many germs.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Right.
L:  And that generally I try to avoid that period.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  I'll take -- uh, another thing that I've done, um, [LIPSMACK] is I keep, uh, baby wipes in the car.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I have --
L:   That's a great idea.
R:  -- for about fifteen years and my husband does too.  So, if we're out shopping --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- as soon as we'll get in the car we use baby wipes.
L:  Yeah.  You know, Goldie Hawn uses rubber gloves to pump her gas.
R:  Oh.
L:  She keeps a container of rubber gloves in her car.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And doesn't touch anything that's publically used unless she has rubber gloves on.
R:  Oh.
L:  Isn't that funny?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  But, yeah, that's great.
R:  But [MN] the baby wipes have just been e- excellent.  And my husband's a referee for basketball, and he referees seven days a week, and as soon as he gets in the car he uses the, um, baby wipes because the ball players are sick and then they're handling the basketball.
L:  Mhm.  That's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's great.  A great idea.  
R:  So that has really been, um, a plus too.
L:  Mhm.  [SIGH]
R:  Um.
L:  Well, I'm healthy now so hopefully I make it through the rest of the winter without --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- any [several inaudible words].  I haven't had -- I haven't gotten sick sick in a long, long time.  I think I've had bronchitis once, maybe, in the last fifteen years.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, in generally I stay pretty healthy through the winter.
R:  Yeah, I do too --
L:  Um ... [SIGH]
R:  -- if I -- yeah, I usually do get to the, um, the health club and work out at least a couple of days a week.  But we were on vacation and I came back and I had a sinus infection and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it was very hard to get rid of.
L:  Yeah, and I think stress has a lot to do with it, too.  If you're stressed you're gonna -- you're immune system's down and you're more susceptible to getting sick.  You know, like, if somebody's ill in your family and you're having to deal with it.  
R:  Right.
L:  And going to the hospital or doctor's office all the time, you're gonna end up probably getting sick too, because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.  It's like I said, I normally always get sick whenever I go to urgency care with someone because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- somebody in there's got a virus.  And I then end up breathing spores or something.
R:  Well, and -- and I notice too when you go to the doctor's office they're always washing their hands before they see you.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  Too.  From room to room.
L:  Right.
R:  They, um -- at least that's what I've noticed there, before they even, um --
L:  Good point, yeah.
R:  -- touch you.  But there's just germs on every handle that you're touching when you're going out shopping or ...
L:  And -- yeah, and money, too.  That's the other thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Some people, uh, just have like a phobia of even touching things that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- somebody else touched, like a pen or ... you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um.  Shopping cart.  [LAUGH]  I don't -- there's a lot.  If you got to thinking about it there's a lot of things that -- that general population uses.
R:  Right.  And then another thing, if you're out, um, [LIPSMACK] don't touch your nose or your eyes or your mouth because that's the best way to pick up the virus.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  But, that's right.
L:  Well, I think we covered a lot of points on this topic.
R:  Yes.  
L:  Is there anything --
R:  I don't know, do they tell you when to end or what?
L:  Uh, no.  We end it.  
R:  [MN]
L:  So, it's just, uh, when --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- unless there's anything else you need to add to it.  Usually it doesn't go for more than five minutes, so ...
R:  Oh.
L:  I think we've been on for almost seven, so we're okay.
R:  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Well, we're --
L:  Um.
R:  -- freezing here.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's below zero so ...
L:  Oh, well.
R:  We're, uh, getting tired of it.
L:  Stoke the fire and [LIPSMACK] grab some hot chocolate --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- and stay warm.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Cuddle up.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  
L:  All right.
R:  Thank you.
L:  Well, it was nice talking with you.
R:  Yes, you too.
L:  Okay.  Bye bye.
R:  Bye bye.
