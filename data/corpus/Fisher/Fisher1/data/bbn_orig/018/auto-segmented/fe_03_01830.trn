UM I DO FIND THAT AH THERE IS ALWAYS PROS AND CONS FOR EVERYTHING UM COMPUTERS HAVE TAKEN OVER YOU KNOW NOT JUST TAKE- I DON'T MEAN TAKEN OVER I MEAN COMPUTERS ARE THE FUTURE ACTUALLY THEY'RE THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE  (fe_03_01830-B-0004)
AH THERE'S A POINT TO LEARN COMPUTERS BUT WE CAN'T HAVE COMPUTERS DO THE WORK FOR US  (fe_03_01830-B-0005)
YOU KNOW FOR INSTANCE YOU KNOW TH- THE THING WHERE THEY GO OFF IN HIGH SCHOOL THEY TALK ABOUT CALCULATORS YOU KNOW AH AGAIN RELY RELY ON CALCULATORS TO THE POINT LIKE FOR ME I'M I'M MY AH  (fe_03_01830-B-0006)
YEAH SAME SAME HERE I'M MEAN I I'M GOOD AT  (fe_03_01830-B-0008)

AH I I STAYED AWAY FROM CALCULATORS I USE MY BRAIN ONLY AND I FOUND THAT I GOT STRONGER IN MATHEMATICS LATELY AH AH I'VE  (fe_03_01830-B-0011)
BEEN A BIT WORKING YOU KNOW WORKING A LOT I DON'T HAVE TIME TO REALLY SIT THERE AND REALLY WRITE THINGS DOWN I JUST A CALCULATOR  (fe_03_01830-B-0012)
SO I USE A COMPUTER IN THAT SENSE I USE A COMPUTER TO FOR CHILDREN TO THINK FOR THEM  (fe_03_01830-B-0013)
YOU KNOW ADD THINGS UP SET THINGS UP GRAPHS FOR THEM UM  (fe_03_01830-B-0015)
IT'S [MN] GOOD FOR EM TO LEARN TO USE IT BUT IF THEY RELY ON USING IT ALL THE TIME THEY [NOISE] IT IT THAT HANDICAPS THEM NOW THEY LEARN HOW TO USE GRAPHS FOR INSTANCE GRAPHS  (fe_03_01830-B-0016)
CONSTANTLY AND THEN LEARN HOW TO USE ON THE COMPUTER BUT STILL WORK ON  (fe_03_01830-B-0017)
ON GRAPHS YOU KNOW WITH PEN AND PAPER  (fe_03_01830-B-0018)
THAT WOULD BE EXCEPTIONALLY BENEFICIAL THERE  (fe_03_01830-B-0019)
YEAH  (fe_03_01830-B-0020)
YEAH  (fe_03_01830-B-0021)

EXACTLY UM I KNOW THAT EXAMPLE BUT FOR THIS AH I'M I'M A MUSICIAN I PLAY GUITAR AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS MOSTLY GUITAR  (fe_03_01830-B-0023)
UM I'M FINDING AH NOWADAYS TECHNOLOGY IS TAKING PLACE OF A LOT OF THINGS THE TRICKS AND STUFF THEY USED DO IN THE PAST FOR INSTANCE AH WE HAVE A THING ON THE GUITAR CALLED THE WHAMMY BAR [MN] ONE OF THE TREMOLO BAR  (fe_03_01830-B-0024)
UM WE CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS WITH IT YOU CAN DROP OR RAISE A TUNE A TONE ON IT  (fe_03_01830-B-0025)
NOW THEY HAVE COMPUTERIZED DEVICE THAT DO IT FOR THEM  (fe_03_01830-B-0026)
ALSO A WA PEDAL NOW THE THING IS IT'S THE ONLY SET SO MUCH YOU CAN'T IMPROVISE OR REALLY DO SOMETHING  (fe_03_01830-B-0027)
YOU'RE NOT AS FLEXIBLE BUT THE PROBLEM IT'S IT'S GOING TOWARDS THAT WHERE NOW A LOT OF MUSICIANS DON'T HAVE THE EAR DON'T HAVE THE SKILL THEY'RE USING AH  (fe_03_01830-B-0028)
MACHINES  (fe_03_01830-B-0029)
TO PLAY TO PLAY TO ENHANCE THEIR PLAYING  (fe_03_01830-B-0030)
IN THE SENSE OF BEING PART THEM [MN] WE CALL IN  (fe_03_01830-B-0031)
IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY UM THEY'LL  (fe_03_01830-B-0032)

AH THAT TAKES THAT MEANS THERE IS LESS SKILL NEEDED  (fe_03_01830-B-0035)
UM  (fe_03_01830-B-0036)
WELL AND IT LOST THINGS AS HARMONIZES WHERE IN THE PAST MUSICIANS USED TO UM  (fe_03_01830-B-0037)
[MN] TWO GUITARISTS WOULD HARMONIZE A SOLO THAT REQUIRES A- AN UNDERSTAND OF HARMONY PERFECT TIMING  (fe_03_01830-B-0038)
AND A LOT OF PRACTICE THAT RIGHT THERE IS A SKILL BEING DEVELOPED UM WELL THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY  (fe_03_01830-B-0039)
UM YOU CAN FOR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS YOU CAN BY A PROCESS THAT DOES EVERYTHING WA  (fe_03_01830-B-0040)
LIKE A WA PEDAL TALK BOX EVERYTHING AH WE WE PUT THAT  (fe_03_01830-B-0041)
I GUESS THAT THAT W- THAT DIRECTION THAT PHILOSOPHY INTO THE SCHOOLS WE'LL WIND UP WITH KIDS COMING OUT AND THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IS SUFFERING  (fe_03_01830-B-0042)
NOT NOT JUST FINANCIALLY HERE I'M AT THEY'RE DOING A LOT OF CUTS  (fe_03_01830-B-0043)
AH BUT THE KIDS ARE SUFFERING EVEN WITHOUT THE CUTS UM  (fe_03_01830-B-0044)
THEY'RE NOT WORKING THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE AS INTO  (fe_03_01830-B-0045)
INTO SCHOOL I MEAN KIDS ARE NEVER REALLY INTO SCHOOL BUT THEY ARE EVEN LESS  (fe_03_01830-B-0046)
I MEAN WHEN KIDS USED TO IN THE PAST PLAY GAMES LIKE HOPSCOTCH OR GAMES OF A  (fe_03_01830-B-0047)
A YOU KNOW PLAYING BALL OR ANY KIND OF TEAM SPORTS NOW THEY'RE IN- INDOORS WITH A A NINTENDO  (fe_03_01830-B-0048)
SO NOW THEIR ACTIVITIES ARE SITTING DOWN IN FRONT OF THE T._V.  (fe_03_01830-B-0049)
[MN] EXACTLY UM A LOT OF THAT TOO AFFECTS THE BEHAVIOR UM WITH DEVELOP AH DEVELOPING AH  (fe_03_01830-B-0050)
SOCIAL SOCIAL SKILLS AH THEY'RE LEARNING SOCIAL SKILLS BY PLAYING MORTAL COMBAT RATHER THAN PLAYING THE SPORT TEAM SPORT WHERE  (fe_03_01830-B-0051)
THEY HELP EACH WORK AS A TEAM  (fe_03_01830-B-0052)
NOW THEY'RE JUST DOING IT AS A FIGHTING THING UM THIS IS YOU KNOW PLUS WITH OTHER INFLUENCES COMING IN  (fe_03_01830-B-0053)
THIS IS CAUSING A A MAJOR IT'S CAUSING A PROBLEM WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THE DISTRICT THE SCHOOL ITSELF I MEAN I HAVE WORKED IN MANY SCHOOLS AS A SUB AND I'VE SEEN AH  (fe_03_01830-B-0054)
AH YOU KNOW YOU SEE THE REPERCUSSIONS OF AH  (fe_03_01830-B-0055)
THESE HABITS THAT THESE K- YOU KNOW KIDS ARE INVOLVED IN  (fe_03_01830-B-0056)
UM YOU'LL SEE AH LOT OF TH- THERE MIGHT BE SOME LITTLE SOCIAL GATHERINGS BUT THEY'RE MORE CLIQUISH THAN BEFORE MORE CLOSED IN AND KIND OF LIKE HOW THE GANGS ARE REALLY CLOSED IN WITH THEMSELVES AND HOSTILE TO OTHERS  (fe_03_01830-B-0057)
EVEN THESE KIDS ARE NOT IN IN GANGS THAT WAY OF THINKING THEY'RE STILL COMING OUT UM YOU SEE A LOT MORE PROBLEMS A LOT OF  (fe_03_01830-B-0058)
KIDS ARE MORE LIKELY TO DITCH NOW THAN BEFORE WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL  (fe_03_01830-B-0059)
ARE BEEN AUGMENTED AND EVEN AH WEREN'T EXISTING WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL AND GRADE SCHOOL WHEN I WAS IN GRADE SCHOOL I'D WALK IN TO AH  (fe_03_01830-B-0060)
CAMPUS AND I FELT SAFE  (fe_03_01830-B-0061)

AND A GUN  (fe_03_01830-B-0063)
SIXTH GRADER  (fe_03_01830-B-0064)
THIS IS A SIXTH GRADER AND THAT'S  (fe_03_01830-B-0065)
YEAH AH IT ACTUALLY DOES TIE IN WITH THE SUBJECT OF COMPUTERS BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT WHAT SELLS COMPUTER GAMES  (fe_03_01830-B-0067)
MOSTLY VIOLENT GAMES  (fe_03_01830-B-0068)
AND SO NOW THE KIDS ARE BEHAVING IS WHAT THEY SEE AND WHAT THEY HEAR IN THEIR MUSIC WHICH B- BASICALLY WHAT THEY'RE LISTENING TO IS COMPUTERIZED I MEAN LIKE THE RAP ALL THE STUFF IS JUST COMPUTERIZED RUMMAGING  (fe_03_01830-B-0069)
UM EVEN THE POP MUSIC NOWADAYS  (fe_03_01830-B-0070)
UM THERE'S THERE'S CONS THERE [MN] WHEN THE COMPUTER DOES THE WORK FOR THE PERSON  (fe_03_01830-B-0071)
UM  (fe_03_01830-B-0072)
PEOPLE ARE LESS NOT THEY DON'T THINK FOR THEMSELVES  (fe_03_01830-B-0073)
UM  (fe_03_01830-B-0074)
YEAH AND AH  (fe_03_01830-B-0075)
BUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS  (fe_03_01830-B-0076)
HAVE A A LINE DRAWN  (fe_03_01830-B-0077)
HERE IS WHAT A COMPUTER CAN DO FOR YOU BUT DO IT FOR YOURSELF  (fe_03_01830-B-0078)
UM WHERE I'M T- OR WHERE I'M WORKING AT THE KIDS RIGHT NOW ARE JUST LEARNING HOW TO TYPE AND HOW TO US AH WOR- YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01830-B-0079)
THE BASIC FUNCTIONS THERE'S NOTHING REALLY I DON'T SEE ANY THREAT IN THIS  (fe_03_01830-B-0080)
I DON'T SEE THEM UM  (fe_03_01830-B-0081)
IN THE BRAIN OF THIS ACTUALLY IN THIS SENSE IN THIS CLASS IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL  (fe_03_01830-B-0083)
UM IT'S WHEN WHAT COULD LATER ON YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01830-B-0084)
UM  (fe_03_01830-B-0085)
WITH YOU KNOW WHAT CAN HAPPEN LATER ON RIGHT NOW THE WAY I SEE IT I'M FOR COM- COMPUTER EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS I'M ALL FOR IT I JUST THINK IT SHOULD BE AH  (fe_03_01830-B-0086)
LOOKED AT UNDER A MICROSCOPE  (fe_03_01830-B-0087)
AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DO NOT OVERDO IT OR DO NOT AH CROSS THE LINE THAT SEEMS TO BE CROSSED  (fe_03_01830-B-0088)
[MN] NOT TO BE CROSSED I'M SORRY YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01830-B-0089)
BECAUSE AH AS YOU KNOW COMPUTERS GET MORE ADVANCES JUST FOR THE COMPANIES TO MAKE MONEY  (fe_03_01830-B-0091)
THEY WANT TO BE NOT JUST USER FRIENDLY BUT EASIER FOR THE PERSON TO JUST GET THEIR JOB DONE  (fe_03_01830-B-0092)
AND DOING THAT IT'S JUST LIKE FOR INSTANCE IN THE PAST WHEN PEOPLE BEFORE MACHINES WERE MADE PEOPLE WERE A MUCH BETTER FIT THEY HAD TO DO THINGS CARPENTERS HAD TO EVERYTHING WAS HAND TOOLS  (fe_03_01830-B-0093)
NOWADAYS WE USE MACHINES  (fe_03_01830-B-0094)
UM I MEAN WHEN [MN] BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN THEY HAD A SHOVEL TO PULL  (fe_03_01830-B-0095)
TO DO WORK THERE'S THE PROS AND CONS ON THAT I MEAN THEY GOT MORE WORK DONE WITH THE MACHINES BUT NOW YOU SEE PEOPLE WITH MORE HEALTH PROBLEMS BEING INACTIVE AND WE DON'T WANT THIS HAPPENING WITH UM  (fe_03_01830-B-0096)
OUR CHILDREN'S B- MINDS  (fe_03_01830-B-0097)
BEING AH CLOSED MINDED NOT ABLE TO HAVE CRITICAL THINKING  (fe_03_01830-B-0098)
SO COMPUTERS NEED TO BE THE SLAVES OF THE PEOPLE IN THE SENSE BECAUSE THEY'RE MACHINES YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01830-B-0099)
BE BE IN OUR CONTROL WE NEED TO BE THE CRITICAL THINKERS  (fe_03_01830-B-0100)
BUT THEY NEED TO BE LIKE THE ONES THAT DO THE SOME OF THE QUICK ADDING UP BECAUSE THEY CAN THEY CAN CALCULATE VERY QUICKLY  (fe_03_01830-B-0101)
BUT AS LONG I MEAN I WAS JUST WATCHING TODAY A A THING ON T._V. ABOUT  (fe_03_01830-B-0102)
HOW MACHINES ARE GETTING SO ADVANCED IN TWENTY YEARS THEY MIGHT BE REPLACING PEOPLE  (fe_03_01830-B-0103)
EXACTLY EXACTLY FACTORIES I MEAN WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE GOING OUT OF WORK  (fe_03_01830-B-0104)
