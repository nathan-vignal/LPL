HI TERESA I'M LARRY  (fe_03_01861-B-0001)
SO AH DID YOU AH TEACH OR DO ANYTHING WITH WORD PROCESSING  (fe_03_01861-B-0002)
HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED WHAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A KID THAT HAD A HARD TIME LEARNING TO SPELL THE OLD FASHIONED WAY AND A NEW FASHIONED WAY WHERE HE HAS A WORD PROCESSOR WITH A SPELL CHECKER  (fe_03_01861-B-0003)
SO THAT INSTANTLY HE KNOWS WHICH WORD IS MISSPELLED RATHER THAN NOT EVEN KNOWING WHICH WORD  (fe_03_01861-B-0004)
IS MISSPELLED TO LOOK UP BEFOREHAND  (fe_03_01861-B-0005)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01861-B-0006)
YEAH WELL IT SPOILS YOU I AH I HAD A A REAL HARD TIME WHEN I WAS IN GRADE SCHOOL I INJURED MY HANDS REALLY BAD  (fe_03_01861-B-0007)
AND IN THE SECOND THIRD AND FOURTH GRADE I MISSED PROBABLY TWO THIRDS OF THE TIME I DON'T REMEMBER LEARNING SPELLING  (fe_03_01861-B-0008)
SO I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A HORRIBLE SPELLER AND AND WHEN YOU'RE A HORRIBLE SPELLER YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH WORD IS SPELT WRONG TO LOOK IT UP TO SEE  (fe_03_01861-B-0009)
REALLY  (fe_03_01861-B-0010)
YEAH YEAH THERE'S A LOT OF WORDS WITH IS AND ES IN THEM THAT YOU HAVE TO GUESS WHETHER  (fe_03_01861-B-0011)

THEY THEY NEED TO LEARN HOW TO DO THE OLD FASHIONED RESEARCH  (fe_03_01861-B-0020)
AND THEY SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM COMPUTERS WHEN THEY'RE DOING RESEARCH  (fe_03_01861-B-0021)
UM MATH COMPUTERS I THINK ARE WONDERFUL  (fe_03_01861-B-0022)
MY WIFE IS WELL SHE'S A PHYSICAL A PEDIATRIC PHYSICAL THERAPIST BUT YEARS AGO SHE WENT TO WORK FOR THE SCHOOL SYSTEM AND SHE WORKS WITH AH  (fe_03_01861-B-0023)

HE HAS TO BE ABLE TO SEE BUT ANYHOW OH HE'S A QUADRIPLEGIC  (fe_03_01861-B-0027)
AND HIS HIS SKILLS WERE NO HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY SKILLS WHATSOEVER AND THEY CAME UP WITH A THING THAT THERE'S A MONITOR THAT THERE'S A A DEVICE THAT SITS ON TOP OF THE MONITOR AND THEN HE WEARS A  (fe_03_01861-B-0028)
A KIND OF A HEADSET THING WITH STRAPS AND STUFF AND I BELIEVE IT'S AN INFRARED THING THAT SHINES AT THE MONITOR  (fe_03_01861-B-0029)
AND AH WHATEVER WINDOWS APPLICATION IS ON THERE HE CAN MOVE HIS HEAD AROUND AND IT WILL MOVE THE CURSOR AROUND ON THE MONITOR  (fe_03_01861-B-0030)
AND WHEN HIS HEAD COMES TO A STOP FOR MORE THAN A PROGRAMMED PERIOD OF TIME IT'S THE SAME THING AS CLICKING ON A MOUSE  (fe_03_01861-B-0031)

SO THIS KID WENT FROM FROM A YOUNG PERSON THAT'S VERY BRIGHT ACTUALLY AH BUT HAD BUT WAS LIVING IN A IN A  (fe_03_01861-B-0033)
IN A IN AN ENVELOPE WHERE HE HAD NO STIMULATION OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER NO COMMUNICATION COULDN'T TALK COULDN'T AH I THINK HE COULDN'T TALK THAT WAS WHAT IT WAS BUT HE WAS QUADRIPLEGIC THAT COULD BUT ANYWAY ALL OF A SUDDEN HE LEARNED THE LANGUAGE  (fe_03_01861-B-0034)
