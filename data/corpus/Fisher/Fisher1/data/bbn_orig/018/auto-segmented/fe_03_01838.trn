EQUATIONS AND THINGS AND THEY COULD LEARN YOU KNOW IT WORKED BETTER THAN ME OR THEM DRAWING THEM ON THE CHALK BOARD  (fe_03_01838-B-0053)
I COULD PROJECT THEM ON THE SCREEN WITH THE COMPUTER AND THEY COULD PICK UP THE PATTERN SO MUCH MORE QUICKLY  (fe_03_01838-B-0054)
THAT WAY AND SO IT WAS A TIME SAVER  (fe_03_01838-B-0055)

MEAN THEY STILL DO THAT TOO BUT  (fe_03_01838-B-0072)
THERE IS SO MUCH MORE AVAILABLE AND  (fe_03_01838-B-0073)

AND THEY JUST MAKE LEARNING MORE FUN AND EXCITING AND AND AND AGAIN FROM THE TEACHER'S POINT OF VIEW USING THEM AS A REWARD  (fe_03_01838-B-0083)
FOR THINGS YOU KNOW YOU GET TIME ON THE COMPUTER AS A REWARD I THINK THEY ARE A GREAT TOOL FOR THE TEACHER  (fe_03_01838-B-0084)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01838-B-0085)

PROBLEMS WITH HAVING THEM IN THE CLASSROOM AND  (fe_03_01838-B-0092)
RIGHT WELL I THINK YOU KNOW BEING IN IN THE CLASSROOM I THINK THAT'S UP TO THE TEACHER TO MONITOR AND  (fe_03_01838-B-0093)
KEEP CONTROL OF AND AGAIN ON THE OTHER HAND IF A CHILD'S  (fe_03_01838-B-0094)
YOU KNOW CA- SHE CAN USE THAT AS A REWARD  (fe_03_01838-B-0095)
YOU KNOW AS LONG AS THEY ARE MONITORING  (fe_03_01838-B-0096)
THE CONTENT THAT THEY ARE FINDING ON THE INTERNET AND I THINK MOST SCHOOLS EMPLOY A FILTER  (fe_03_01838-B-0097)
