WE OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT WAS NOT REAL GOOD AT INTEGRATING THE COMPUTER OR THE ACCESS TO THE COMPUTERS IN ALL OF THE DIFFERENT CLASSES UM I THINK  (fe_03_01812-A-0026)
WE MAKE A BIG MISTAKE BY SAYING OKAY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU KNOW AN HOUR AN HOUR AND A HALF OF COMPUTERS BUT YOU NEED TO HELP THAT STUDENT INTEGRATE THOSE INTO THE OTHER CLASSES  (fe_03_01812-A-0027)

MHM MHM  (fe_03_01812-A-0034)

ESPECIALLY SOCIAL GRACES OF SOME SORT  (fe_03_01812-A-0059)
