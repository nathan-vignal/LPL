WITH REGARD TO FAMILIES YOU KNOW ALL THESE NEW AND  (fe_03_01880-B-0063)
AND  (fe_03_01880-B-0064)
UNUSUAL IDEAS  (fe_03_01880-B-0065)

WHEN WE WERE KIDS  (fe_03_01880-B-0073)

I THINK I THINK  (fe_03_01880-B-0081)
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT YOU CAN TEACH YOUR CHILDREN AS FAR AS A FAMILY GOES IS THAT A FAMILY LOVES EACH OTHER NO MATTER WHAT  (fe_03_01880-B-0082)
