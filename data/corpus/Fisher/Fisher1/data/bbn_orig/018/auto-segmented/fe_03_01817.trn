SAME HERE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01817-B-0004)

OKAY SO WHAT DO YOU THINK OF COMPUTERS AND EDUCATION [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01817-B-0006)
WELL MY I HAVE I HAVE TWO KIDS AND MY SEVEN YEAR OLD HAS COMPUTER LAB AT SCHOOL BUT THAT'S PURELY EDUCATIONAL  (fe_03_01817-B-0007)
UM THEY FOR READING A STORY OR DOING A MATHS GAME AND AT HOME THEY HAVE GA- THEY HAVE GAMES BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY  (fe_03_01817-B-0008)
THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING VIOLENT EVERYTHING BASICALLY IS EDUCATIONAL IN IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER I I MEAN I THINK IT'S HYSTERICAL THAT MY SEVEN YEAR OLD CALLS IT  (fe_03_01817-B-0009)
KEYBOARDING HE DOESN'T EVEN CALL IT HE DOESN'T EVEN CALL IT TYPING I MEAN I BARELY MADE IT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL TYPING AND HE'S GOT COMPUTER LAB IN FIRST GRADE  (fe_03_01817-B-0010)

IT'S A SIGN OF THE TIMES I MEAN I JUST HOPE IT DOESN'T LIKE YOU HAVE LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY CLOCKS THAT REPLACED REAL CLOCKS  (fe_03_01817-B-0012)
SO YOU CAN'T LEARN HOW TO TELL TIME I I DON'T THINK THAT COMPU- I DON'T THINK COMPUTERS CAN REPLACE TEACHERS BUT  (fe_03_01817-B-0013)
THERE'S THERE'S NOTHING LIKE SEEING YOUR CHILD BEING ABLE TO CONCENTRATE FOR THAT LONG ON A GOAL ORIENTED TASK SO I I THINK THERE'S A PLACE FOR THEM IN EDUCATION  (fe_03_01817-B-0014)
AHAH  (fe_03_01817-B-0015)

HE I MEAN HE KNOWS HE KNOWS  (fe_03_01817-B-0023)
HE KNOWS HOW TO DO EVERYTHING THE ONLY THING IS WHEN THEY'RE DONE WITH THE COMPUTER THEY INSIST ON TAKING THE C._D. OUT  (fe_03_01817-B-0024)
AND THEY'RE ALWAYS GETTING THEIR FINGERPRINTS ON I THINK THAT'S MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT ABOUT COMPUTERS AND EDUCATION IS THAT THEY HAVEN'T DEVISED A WAY TO LOCK THE HARD DRIVE  (fe_03_01817-B-0025)
SO THAT ONCE YOU PUT THE C._D. IN THE CHILD CAN'T TAKE IT OUT  (fe_03_01817-B-0026)
UNTIL YOU'RE READY BECAUSE I'VE HAD MY COMPUTER BROKEN AND I'VE HAD C._D.S RUINED  (fe_03_01817-B-0027)
