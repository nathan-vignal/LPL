ON THE INTERNET THAT MIGHT BE THE EASIEST AND CHEAPEST WAY OF YOU KNOW LEARNING OR PRACTISING THE LANGUAGE  (fe_03_01856-A-0043)
COMPARED TO TRAVELLING ABROAD OR HAVING A NATIVE SPEAKING TEACHER AROUND  (fe_03_01856-A-0044)

AND THEN JUST YOU KNOW GATHER SOME INFORMATION OR JUST COPY PART OF THE  (fe_03_01856-A-0059)
PAPERS AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET WHICH IS NOT ETHICAL AT ALL IN MY OPINION  (fe_03_01856-A-0060)

UM  (fe_03_01856-B-0013)
BASICALLY MY THOUGHTS ON THE MATTER ARE  (fe_03_01856-B-0014)
IF COMPUTERS ARE OVERUSED IN THE CLASSROOM ESPECIALLY FROM A YOUNG AGE  (fe_03_01856-B-0015)
THEN THEY HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF HURTING THE CHILD'S UM COGNITIVE SKILLS AS FAR AS  (fe_03_01856-B-0016)
YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO SPELL WORDS CORRECTLY RATHER THAN YOU KNOW LIKE A SPELL CHECK WHICH ALL WILL CHECK THE WORDS KID'S WORDS  (fe_03_01856-B-0017)
OR JUST ACT- LIKE LITERACY IN GENERAL BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW A LOT OF COMPUTER PROGRAMS AIMED AT CHILDREN AREN'T REALLY GEARED TOWARDS  (fe_03_01856-B-0018)

YOU KNOW THAT  (fe_03_01856-B-0029)
YEAH  (fe_03_01856-B-0030)
