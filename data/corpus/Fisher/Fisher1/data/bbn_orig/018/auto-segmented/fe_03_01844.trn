YEAH BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THERE'S THERE'S NOTHING THERE'S NO PROGRAMME YOU CAN GET TO BLOCK KIDS FROM PLAYING YOU KNOW SHOCK WAVE VIDEO GAMES OR SOMETHING ON LINE  (fe_03_01844-A-0033)
YEAH YEAH IT'S GOT A POINT I MEAN  (fe_03_01844-A-0034)
UNRESTRAINED USE OF THE INTERNET OR OF COMPUTERS IN THE CLASSROOM PROBABLY WOULDN'T BENEFIT ANYONE  (fe_03_01844-A-0035)
UM AND THAT REALLY YOU KNOW HAS TO BE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED AND STUFF  (fe_03_01844-A-0036)
I MEAN YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS IN LIKE YOU KNOW GRADE SCHOOL AND STUFF COMPUTERS WERE LIKE JUST COMING OUT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01844-A-0037)
LIKE WE HAD THE OLD LIKE THE APPLE TWO ES ALL THROUGH LIKE SEVENTH GRADE YOU KNOW AND THEN  (fe_03_01844-A-0038)
UM I MEAN I'M SURE IT'S A LOT DIFFERENT NOW MY MOM'S AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER IN HER CLASSROOM THEY'VE GOT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01844-A-0039)
I REMEMBER LIKE WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL SHE TEACHES AT THE SCHOOL I WENT TO WHEN I WAS THERE THERE WAS ONE ROOM AND IT HAD LIKE FIFTEEN COMPUTERS IN IT NOW SHE HAS SIX COMPUTERS JUST IN HER CLASSROOM AND THEY'RE ALL THEY'RE ALL HOOKED UP TO THE INTERNET AND THE KIDS SPEND SO MUCH TIME ON THEM AND STUFF  (fe_03_01844-A-0040)
SO IT'S KIND OF  (fe_03_01844-A-0041)
IT DOES IN SOME WAYS UM KEEPS THE KIDS OCCUPIED AND STUFF BUT I MEAN I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_01844-A-0042)
IT KIND OF TAKES A DIFFERENT TYPE OF TEACHER TO USE THE COMPUTERS A LOT TOO YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01844-A-0043)
YEAH YEAH EXACTLY  (fe_03_01844-A-0044)
EXACTLY AND IT'S ALSO KIND OF HARD TO INCORPORATE THE TECHNOLOGY IN TWO TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM SETTINGS  (fe_03_01844-A-0045)
YOU KNOW BECAUSE [COUGH] THERE'S  (fe_03_01844-A-0046)
THERE'S ONLY SO MANY WAYS YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01844-A-0047)
USE THE COMPUTER IN MATH CLASS WHEN YOU'RE TEACHING MULTIPLICATION YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE USING THE COMPUTER TOO MUCH YOU KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO GET KIDS ADDICTED TO THEIR CALCULATORS LIKE THEY CAN'T DO SIMPLE MATH IN THEIR HEADS  (fe_03_01844-A-0048)
SO THERE'S YOU KNOW I MEAN MAYBE USING A COMPUTER TAKES AWAY FROM YOU KNOW HUMAN INTELLIGENCE IT IT BASES TOO MUCH ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  (fe_03_01844-A-0049)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01844-A-0050)

YOU KNOW I MEAN WHEN YOU CAN'T HAVE HAL- HAVE CALCULATORS THEY CAN DO THAT HIGH LEVEL OF MATH IT ALMOST MAKES MATH CLASS OBSOLETE  (fe_03_01844-A-0054)
WHICH  (fe_03_01844-A-0055)
BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU DON'T TEACH MATH YOU DON'T TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO THINK  (fe_03_01844-A-0056)
SO IT'S KIND OF A  (fe_03_01844-A-0058)
RIGHT SURE THEY CAN TYPE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE GOING FOR  (fe_03_01844-A-0059)
RIGHT THEY CAN JUST TYPE EVERYTHING IN  (fe_03_01844-A-0061)
I MEAN YOU KNOW I'VE TAKEN CLASSES WHERE YOU KNOW I THINK YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE HAVEN'T UNDERSTOOD BUT THEY CAN STILL DO OKAY BECAUSE THEY CAN TYPE THINGS INTO THEIR CALCULATOR YOU KNOW AND COME UP WITH ANSWERS THAT ARE CLOSE OR WHATEVER  (fe_03_01844-A-0062)
