HELLO MY NAME IS EVELYN  (fe_03_01895-A-0001)
HI KAREN  (fe_03_01895-A-0002)
HI I'M IN NEW YORK  (fe_03_01895-A-0003)
HOW'S THE WEATHER THERE TODAY  (fe_03_01895-A-0004)
OH THAT'S GREAT IT'S NICE HERE TODAY TOO  (fe_03_01895-A-0005)
YES I'M HAVING MAJOR FAMILY DRAMA BECAUSE I WAS AN ONLY CHILD AND I AM GETTING MARRIED AND SO I HAVE INHERITED TWO ELDERLY PARENTS AND UM SOME VERY VINDICTIVE BROTHERS  (fe_03_01895-A-0006)
AND UH  (fe_03_01895-A-0007)
UH IT'S JUST DIFFICULT BECAUSE THIS IS HIS SECOND MARRIAGE AS IS MINE BUT I DIDN'T HAVE THESE ISSUES BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE ANY SIBLINGS AND I CERTAINLY DIDN'T HAVE AN EX-HUSBAND OR CHILDREN OR ANY OF THAT TO DEAL WITH  (fe_03_01895-A-0008)
YES IT IS GETTING READY TO CHANGE  (fe_03_01895-A-0009)
DID YOU MARRY WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER  (fe_03_01895-A-0010)
OKAY  (fe_03_01895-A-0011)
WOW HOW DID THAT MIX THAT'S REAL FAMILY MIX  (fe_03_01895-A-0012)
MHM  (fe_03_01895-A-0013)
YEAH HE HAS THE SAME KIND OF SITUATION MY UH HUSBAND TO BE HAS TWO DAUGHTERS WHO ARE IN THEIR TWENTIES AND AND I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE TRAUMATICALLY EFFECTED OR IF THEY JUST DECIDED TO TAKE UP THEIR MOTHERS CRUSADE  (fe_03_01895-A-0014)
BUT UH THEY'RE REALLY GIVING HIM A HARD TIME COMPLETE WITH MAJOR COLLEGE DEBTS  (fe_03_01895-A-0015)
AND PAYING OFF ALL OF HER OTHER DEBT  (fe_03_01895-A-0016)
AND GIVING HER THE HOUSE AND GIVING HER MONEY OUT OF PENSION AND IT'S REALLY BEEN QUITE TRAUMATIC THEY'RE THEY'RE ALSO VINDICTIVE JUST IN THE WAY THEY COMMUNICATE OR RATHER DON'T COMMUNICATE WITH HIM  (fe_03_01895-A-0017)
THE LATEST ONE HAS HAS DECIDED TO HAVE A WEDDING CEREMONY SO SHE SENT HIM AN INVITATION WITH THE DAY AND A TIME CUT OUT  (fe_03_01895-A-0018)
SO HE HAS NO WAY OF KNOWING  (fe_03_01895-A-0019)
WHICH WHICH I CUR- PERSONALLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T INVITE HIM AS DAD TO COME TO THE WEDDING UH SHE ASKED HIM TO CATER AND SERVE AT THE WEDDING  (fe_03_01895-A-0020)
BECAUSE HE'S A COOK SO SHE ASKED HIM TO CATER AND TO SERVE AND UH AND OF COURSE TO HAVE ME COME ALONG  (fe_03_01895-A-0021)
AND CATER AND SERVE AND HE SAID NOPE I JUST WANT TO BE DAD I'LL PAY FOR IT CATERING  (fe_03_01895-A-0022)
I'LL DO WHOEVER YOU LIKE BUT I'M NOT COMFORTABLE BEING IN MY OLD HOUSE WITH MY EX-WIFE AND MY NEW WIFE TO BE ALL UNDER THE SAME ROOF THEY DON'T GET ALONG AND IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK AND THIS IS YOUR DAY  (fe_03_01895-A-0023)
SO SHE  (fe_03_01895-A-0024)
SO SHE STORMED OUT OF HIS OFFICE AND SAID I NEVER WANT TO TALK TO YOU AGAIN AND THAT WAS ALMOST A YEAR AGO  (fe_03_01895-A-0025)
AND THEN THE INVITATION SHOWED UP SO I'M LEARNING A LOT ABOUT THIS ABOUT HOW FAMILY ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE THAT WILL HURT YOU  (fe_03_01895-A-0026)
BUT I LEARNED THAT ALSO FROM MY OWN UP BRINGING FROM MY FAMILY AND I HAVE ALWAYS KEPT BY DISTANCE WITH FAMILY AND CREATING MY OWN FAMILY MY OWN WORLD OF FRIENDS AND PEOPLE THAT I LIKE TO BE AROUND  (fe_03_01895-A-0027)
BUT THIS IS THIS FAMILY DYNAMIC OF FEELING LIKE IT'S OKAY TO MISTREAT YOU  (fe_03_01895-A-0028)
BECAUSE YOUR BROTHER YOUR BLOOD OR YOUR INDISPENSABLE BECAUSE YOU'LL ONLY HAVE ONE BROTHER IT JUST SEEMS A LITTLE ODD TO ME  (fe_03_01895-A-0029)
SINCE I'M AN ONLY CHILD I WOULD THINK YOU WOULD CHERISH YOUR SIBLING AND DO YOU BEST TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO WORK TOGETHER ESPECIALLY ON ISSUES OF ELDERLY PARENTS  (fe_03_01895-A-0030)
WHICH IS  (fe_03_01895-A-0031)
THAT'S GREAT  (fe_03_01895-A-0032)
SURE  (fe_03_01895-A-0033)
SURE  (fe_03_01895-A-0034)
SURE AND I THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FAMILY THAT'S SUPPORTIVE AND UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE VENTING  (fe_03_01895-A-0035)
AN A AND A SIBLING RIVALRY THAT AT FIFTEEN WAS OKAY AND AT TWENTY FIVE IT WASN'T OKAY BUT YOU KNOW IT WAS UNDERSTANDABLE BUT AT FIFTY FIVE IT'S JUST PATHETIC  (fe_03_01895-A-0036)
SO [LAUGHTER] I'M WHAT I AM SENSING AND SEEING FROM THIS FAMILY IS THAT THEY UM THEY VERY MUCH LIKE TO STAY IN ROLES HE IS THE YOUNGEST SON  (fe_03_01895-A-0037)
AND AND HAS ALWAYS SORT OF BEEN MISTREATED AS THE YOUNGEST  (fe_03_01895-A-0038)
AND HIM GROWING UP TURNING FIFTY DIVORCING AND REMARRYING HAS THROWN SUCH A MONKEY WRENCH INTO THE FAMILY DYNAMIC  (fe_03_01895-A-0039)
BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS HE CHANGING TO STAND UP FOR HIMSELF AND TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR HIS LIFE WHICH MEANS LEAVING BEHIND A PSYCHOLOGICALLY STRANGE RELATIONSHIP THAT VERY MUCH EMULATED THE FAMILY DYNAMIC  (fe_03_01895-A-0040)
[LAUGHTER] OF COURSE AND UH SO THEY REALLY  (fe_03_01895-A-0041)
ONE IT PUTS FEAR INTO THEM ABOUT THE KIND OF PERSON HE'S BECOMING IT SHOWS UP WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY SETTLED FOR AND NUMBER TWO IT UPSETS THE FAMILY DYNAMIC BECAUSE THEY EXPECT  (fe_03_01895-A-0042)
NOT ONLY TO CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO MISTREAT HIM AS THE YOUNGEST BUT NOW THE NEW WIFE SHOULD ACCEPT THE SAME BEHAVIOR BECAUSE SHE'S THE WIFE OF THE YOUNGEST  (fe_03_01895-A-0043)
AND I DON'T TOLERATE THAT VERY WELL  (fe_03_01895-A-0044)
YES  (fe_03_01895-A-0045)
I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS  (fe_03_01895-A-0046)
SURE  (fe_03_01895-A-0047)
OH YEAH I'M SEEING A LOT OF THAT NOW  (fe_03_01895-A-0048)
WELL THAT'S ACTUALLY GOOD BECAUSE IF THERE WAS ANY MONEY INVOLVED THAT WOULD OF BEEN EXACTLY THE TIME THAT IT BLEW UP  (fe_03_01895-A-0049)
SURE  (fe_03_01895-A-0050)
YES I QUITE AGREE I QUITE AGREE I HAVE PARENTS ARE IN THEIR EIGHTIES AND THEIR THEIR FAIRLY HEALTHY AND THAT THEIR ALL THEY'RE SORT OF INDEPENDENT WE DO THEIR SHOPPING  (fe_03_01895-A-0051)
AND THEY TAKE CARE OF THEIR HOUSE THEY JUST SOLD THEIR HOUSE THEY WERE VERY FORTUNATE THEY LIVE UP HERE IN NEW YORK IN UP STATE COUNTY IN A COUNTY THAT SEEMS TO BE WILDLY POPULAR WITH CITY FOLKS THAT WOOD STALK AREA SO THEY LITERALLY SOLD THEIR HOUSE IN ONE DAY  (fe_03_01895-A-0052)
AND YEAH IT'S PRETTY AMAZING  (fe_03_01895-A-0053)
AND  (fe_03_01895-A-0054)
AND THEY SOLD IT FOR ABOUT THREE TIMES MORE THAN THEY PAID FOR IT SO THEY'RE SITTING ON ASSETS THAT THEIR YOUNGEST SON  (fe_03_01895-A-0055)
THE ONE WHO'S ALWAYS PUSHED ASIDE IS A FINANCIAL PLANNER SO HE TRIPLED OR QUADRUPLED THEIR SAVINGS WHEN THEY RETIRED AT SIXTY AND NOW HE SOLD THEIR HOUSE FOR THREE TIMES MORE THAN HE HAD IT BUILT FOR TWENTY YEARS AGO  (fe_03_01895-A-0056)
SO NOW THEY'RE SITTING ON A REALLY NICE NEST EGG AND THEY'RE MAKING A CHOICE TO MOVE OUT OF STATE UH 'CAUSE WE'RE MAKING THE SAME CHOICE  (fe_03_01895-A-0057)
AND THEY DECIDED OUT OF ALL OF THEIR CHILDREN TO MOVE TO WHERE WE'RE MOVING AND IT YOU KNOW WHILE IT WAS NICE WE CONSTANTLY MADE THEM UNDERSTAND THEY SHOULD MOVE TO WHERE EVER THEY WANT TO MOVE THEY HAVE THREE SONS PICK ONE AND MOVE NEAR THAT SON  (fe_03_01895-A-0058)
THERE'S NO PRESSURE HERE ALL THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT YOU'RE CARED FOR  (fe_03_01895-A-0059)
BECAUSE YOU CAN NO LONGER LIVE ALONE THEY DON'T LIKE THE WORD ASSISTED LIVING  (fe_03_01895-A-0060)
BUT IT REAL TRUTH IS THAT THEY DO NEED ASSISTANCE THEY JUST DON'T WANT STRANGERS DOING IT CAUSE WE DO THE SHOPPING  (fe_03_01895-A-0061)
WE CHECK IN ON THEM OCCASIONALLY WE COOK FOR THEM UM WE CERTAINLY ARE MONITORING BEHAVIORS WITH MEDICINES DOCTORS VISITS AND WE TAKE THEM TO THOSE THINGS SO  (fe_03_01895-A-0062)
IT'S REALLY BECOME QUITE A POINT OF CONTENTION FOR THEM TO BE MOVING TO THE SAME PLACE WE'RE CONTEMPLATING MOVING WHY I HAVE NO IDEA SO THE VERY CHILDREN WHO CLAIM THEY LOVE THEIR PARENTS SO MUCH  (fe_03_01895-A-0063)
ARE UP SET WITH THEIR PARENTS AND TAKING IT OUT ON THEM FOR MOVING TO WHERE WE'RE MOVING WHICH I ALSO DON'T GET [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01895-A-0064)
