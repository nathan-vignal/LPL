SO I AM A BIG [MN] PROPONENT OF THE SAME THING IN FACT I THINK THAT  (fe_03_01884-A-0025)
YOU KNOW AS FAR AS FAMILIES GO I THINK FAMILIES WOULD BE IN MUCH BETTER SHAPE I- I'VE OFTEN SAID THAT I THINK WE SHOULD LEGISLATE [MN] THAT NEW MOTHERS HAVE TO STAY HOME UNTIL THE CHILDREN ARE THREE [NOISE] IF THERE WAS A LAW THAT AH SAYS THAT  (fe_03_01884-A-0026)

BUT WE'D MADE THE DECISION AND I THINK THAT'S THE OPERATIVE WORD IN FAMILIES IS YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION  (fe_03_01884-A-0038)
THAT THE CHILDREN COME FIRST AND MY CAREER IN FACT RECENT WELL NOT RECENTLY IN THE LAST TEN YEARS WHENEVER I HAVE INTERVIEWED FOR JOBS I EVEN HAD MEN TO SAY TO ME YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01884-A-0039)

I HAVE NO PROBLEM I JUST THINK A PARENT [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01884-A-0043)
A PARENT I DON'T CARE IF IT IS MALE OR FEMALE THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME ANY DIFFERENT I THINK THAT WHOEVER IS THE PARENT SHOULD  (fe_03_01884-A-0044)
TAKE CARE OF THE CHILD IT SHOULD NOT BE WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS NOTHING VESTED IN THAT CHILD'S BEST INTERESTS I  (fe_03_01884-A-0045)

[MN] EXACTLY AND AND I THINK THAT SHE FEELS IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH TOO HAVING BEEN RAISED BY A STAY AT HOME MOM I THINK THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE TOO IN FAMILIES THAT I SEE TODAY IS THAT  (fe_03_01884-A-0058)
THE GIRLS THAT ARE MY THE WOMEN NOT GIRLS BUT THE WOMEN THAT ARE MY DAUGHTER'S AGE THAT ARE HAVING THE CHILDREN NOW  (fe_03_01884-A-0059)
A LOT OF THEM DID NOT HAVE A STAY AT HOME MOM SO THEY DON'T SEE THE VALUE IN IT IT'S REALLY PEOPLE WHO ARE MY AGE THAT ARE IN THEIR FORTIES WHO HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING A STAY AT HOME MOM YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01884-A-0060)
