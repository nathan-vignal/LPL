EDUCATION  (fe_03_01818-A-0008)
MM OR DO THEY HELP AND HINDER  (fe_03_01818-A-0009)
YES THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S WHAT I UNDERSTAND  (fe_03_01818-A-0010)
I THINK THEY DO BOTH  (fe_03_01818-A-0011)
LIKE MOST THINGS [LAUGHTER] YOU CAN ABUSE IT IT CAN BE  (fe_03_01818-A-0012)
IMPLEMENTED  (fe_03_01818-A-0013)
YES  (fe_03_01818-A-0015)
[NOISE] THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE UM AND IT'S ALSO IT CAN BE VERY GOOD FOR UM ADDITIONAL ASSIGNMENTS OR FOR SELF PACED STUDIES  (fe_03_01818-A-0016)
FOR SELF PACING  (fe_03_01818-A-0017)
WHEREAS CERTAIN INDIVID- CERTAIN STUDENTS MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL DRILLS THAT NEED BE DONE THAT THE REST OF THE CLASS DOESN'T NEED TO HAVE SO THEY IT IT CAN BE DONE SO  (fe_03_01818-A-0018)
YOU KNOW YOU CAN HELP ENHANCE THE CONCEPTS GOING ON [NOISE]  (fe_03_01818-A-0019)
WELL WHEN I TOOK IT IT WAS ALL PAPER AND PENCIL  (fe_03_01818-A-0021)
I HAVE TAKEN SOME OTHER TESTS SINCE THEN THEY WERE ON LINERS  (fe_03_01818-A-0022)
IT'S IT'S NOTHING LIKE TAKING TAKING SOMETHING ON LINE AND REALIZING THAT YOU'RE GETTING GET INSTANT REP- FEEDBACK AS TO WHAT YOUR SCORE IS  (fe_03_01818-A-0023)
WELL THAT ESPECIALLY WITHIN EDUCATION UH  (fe_03_01818-A-0025)
[MN] THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT HAVING TO PUT A THOUGHT PROC- HAVING TO THINK ABOUT YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS AND BE ABLE TO  (fe_03_01818-A-0026)
EXPAND THAT INTO THE WRITTEN WORD THAT'S MORE DIFFICULT TO DO ON THE [NOISE] COM- ON ON THE COM- ON THE COMPUTER OTHER THAN A WORD PROCESSOR OF COURSE  (fe_03_01818-A-0027)
[NOISE]  (fe_03_01818-A-0028)
WELL ONCE AGAIN IT'S HOW YOU HAVE IT PROGRAMMED ALSO BECAUSE YOU CAN SET UP THINGS LIKE ALMOST LIKE THE THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ASPECT  (fe_03_01818-A-0029)
SO THAT AS YOU GET MORE AND MORE INTO IT IT CAN [MN] LEARN AS YOU'RE DOING AND ALSO FEED GIVE YOU AS YOU SELECT DIFFERENT KINDS OF ALTERNATIVES [NOISE]  (fe_03_01818-A-0030)
GO DIFFERENT PATHS THAT WAY  (fe_03_01818-A-0031)
BUT SOME OF THAT HAS TO BE PROGRAMMED IN TO BEGIN WITH UM  (fe_03_01818-A-0032)
AND ALSO BUT IT HAS HAS TO BE APPROACHED THAT WAY ALSO  (fe_03_01818-A-0033)
THE OTHER THING TOO IS THAT ESPECIALLY IN THE IN THE EDUCATIONAL MATTERS I HAVE DONE SOME SOME TEACHING  (fe_03_01818-A-0034)
BUT A COMPUTER DOESN'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHEN YOU SEE A CH- SEE A CHILD FINALLY FINALLY IT HITS HITS THEM LIKE A TON OF BRICKS AND THEY'RE STARTING TO CATCH THE CONCEPT  (fe_03_01818-A-0035)
AND BUT ONCE THEY GET TO MIDDLE SCHOOL THEY NEVER REMEMBER ANYTHING HAPPENING IN SCHOOL  (fe_03_01818-A-0037)
[SIGH] UM I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THEY HAD THERE WE HAD ALL HAD COMPUTERS AT HOME TOO  (fe_03_01818-A-0039)

SO AT DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE DAY THE CHILDREN WILL BE GOING USING DIFFERENT ASSIGNMENTS IN A DIFFERENT PART OF THE CLASSROOM TO SPLIT S- S- S- SPLIT IT OUT  (fe_03_01818-A-0041)
