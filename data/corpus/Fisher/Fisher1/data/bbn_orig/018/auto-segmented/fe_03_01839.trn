HI MY  (fe_03_01839-A-0002)
GO AHEAD [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01839-A-0003)
CHRISTIE  (fe_03_01839-A-0004)
I'M IN KNOXVILLE TENNESSEE  (fe_03_01839-A-0005)
OH WOW COOL SO WHAT ODD HOW THESE THINGS BRING US TOGETHER [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01839-A-0006)
OKAY WELL THEY SAID COMPUTERS AND EDUCATION  (fe_03_01839-A-0007)
I THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO KNOW [LAUGHTER] I DON'T KNOW GO AHEAD  (fe_03_01839-A-0008)
YEAH  (fe_03_01839-A-0009)
YEAH I AGREE WITH THAT I ONLY WELL LET'S SEE I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL AND I DID A YEAR AND A HALF OF COLLEGE EITHER WAY I NEVER TOUCHED A COMPUTER  (fe_03_01839-A-0010)
IN EITHER PLACE WE HAD TYPEWRITERS [LAUGHTER] WE DIDN'T USE COMPUTERS THEY WERE JUST STARTING TO BE POPULAR ENOUGH TO EVEN GO  (fe_03_01839-A-0011)
IN SCHOOLS BUT I WASN'T IN THE COURSES THAT HAD THEM [MN] WE AH  (fe_03_01839-A-0012)
AS FAR AS COMPUTERS IN SCHOOLS AND ALL I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC BECAUSE IT IS THE WAY THE WORLD IS GOING ANYWAY  (fe_03_01839-A-0013)
THE KIDS ARE GOING TO NEED TO LEARN HOW TO USE THIS AS QUICK AS THEY CAN WE ALREADY HAVE TWO IN OUR HOUSE AND WE HAVE THE KIDS ON THEM  (fe_03_01839-A-0014)
NOT ALL THE TIME BUT THEY PLAY EVERY GAME THEY PLAY IS EDUCATIONAL THEY ONLY HAVE A COUPLE THAT ARE JUST GAMES  (fe_03_01839-A-0015)
SO I BELIEVE THAT COMPUTERS AND EDUCATION HAVE THEY  (fe_03_01839-A-0016)
ARE GOING TO WALK HAND IN HAND  (fe_03_01839-A-0017)
AND FROM WHAT I HEARD ON THE NEWS THEY SAID THAT IT  (fe_03_01839-A-0018)
WAS LIKE CALIFORNIA OR SOMETHING HAS ALREADY GONE TO A TOTALLY COMPUTERIZED CLASSROOMS  (fe_03_01839-A-0019)
YEAH SOMEWHERE I DON'T KNOW IT MAY BE JUST A PROJECT THAT YOU KNOW THAT THEY ARE DOING  (fe_03_01839-A-0020)
TO SEE HOW IT GOES BUT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTOOD THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A PROFESSOR BUT ALL THEIR TEXTBOOKS TYPE STUFF'S GOING TO BE ON THE COMPUTER THEIR TESTS ARE COMPUTERIZED IT IS ALL LIKE YOU JUST GO IN YOU SIT DOWN YOU SIT AT A COMPUTER ALL DAY  (fe_03_01839-A-0021)
WHICH I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS GOING TO BE THE WAY TO GO  (fe_03_01839-A-0022)
BUT IT WOULD BROADEN OUR IT WOULD MAKE IT CHEAPER ON THE SCHOOLS TO OFFER THINGS  (fe_03_01839-A-0023)
IF THEY COULD USE THE COMPUTERS THAT WAY  (fe_03_01839-A-0024)
FOR CERTAIN THINGS  (fe_03_01839-A-0025)
OH YEAH  (fe_03_01839-A-0026)
WELL THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL I FEEL LIKE IT'S THE WAY  (fe_03_01839-A-0027)
KIDS HAVE TO BE TAUGHT AND IF THEY ARE NOT TAUGHT YOUNG BY THE TIME THEY ARE TEENAGERS HIGH SCHOOL AND EVEN READY TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD IT IS GOING TO BE SO FAR AHEAD OF THEM  (fe_03_01839-A-0028)
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO KNOW WHICH WAY'S UP BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS OUT THERE ON THE COMPUTER ON THE INTERNET SOMEWHERE AND IT JUST TAKES THAT EDUCATION TO DIG IT OUT  (fe_03_01839-A-0029)
AND A LOT OF TRIAL AND ERROR AND [LAUGHTER] A LOT OF THOSE OTHER SEARCHES THAT YOU DO THAT YOU JUST YOU'D NEVER GET NOWHERE AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HIT THE RIGHT WORD PATTERN  (fe_03_01839-A-0030)
AND YOU FIND OUT MORE THAN YOU EVER THOUGHT YOU COULD FIND OUT  (fe_03_01839-A-0031)
ANYWAY [MN] BUT I THINK I MEAN EVEN THE LIBRARIES HERE WHERE I'M AT ARE COMPUTERIZED NOW  (fe_03_01839-A-0032)
WE DON'T HAVE THE CARD CATALOGUES AND ALL THAT STUFF WE [LAUGHTER] USED TO LEARN IN SCHOOL YOU HAVE EVERYTHING IS ON A COMPUTER DISK  (fe_03_01839-A-0033)
IT'S JUST AMAZING WHERE IT'S GONE TO  (fe_03_01839-A-0034)
YEAH WITH MORE ONE ON ONE SUPERVISION NOT  (fe_03_01839-A-0035)
THIRTEEN OF THEM IN A ROOM GOING ANYWHERE THEY WANT TO GO  (fe_03_01839-A-0036)
I AGREE WITH THERE TOO I THINK THE INTERNET AS FAR AS IN SCHOOLS IN A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD WORK BUT  (fe_03_01839-A-0037)
IN GENERAL KNOWING THE KIDS AROUND HERE NO [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01839-A-0038)
THEY ALL WANT TO ALL THEY WANT TO LEARN ABOUT IS THE MOVIE STARS AND THE  (fe_03_01839-A-0039)
[MN] YOU KNOW THE SAME THINGS EVERY GENERATION HAS LIKED BUT WE HAD MAGAZINES WE READ AND INSTEAD OF READING MAGAZINES THEY JUST GET ON A COMPUTER AND DO IT THAT WAY  (fe_03_01839-A-0040)
YOU KNOW AT LEAST THEY ARE READING SO THAT PART'S NOT THERE AND THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF TYPING AND ALL THAT'S THERE BUT  (fe_03_01839-A-0041)
THEY WOULD DO IT IN SCHOOL ALL HOURS OF THE DAY IF THEY HAD THE ABILITY  (fe_03_01839-A-0042)
YEAH  (fe_03_01839-A-0044)
YEAH HASN'T IT [LAUGHTER] WE HAD ALL THE TEXAS INSTRUMENTS THE COMPUTERIZED TOYS THE SPEAK AND SPELL THE MATH AND  (fe_03_01839-A-0045)
SPELL I GUESS IS WHAT YOU CALL IT IT WAS SPEAK AND MATH I THINK MY PARENTS WERE BIG ON THE TEXAS INSTRUMENT EDUCATIONAL TOYS BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE A COMPUTER  (fe_03_01839-A-0047)
I WAS BORN IN SIXTY NINE  (fe_03_01839-A-0048)
SO I'M NOT MUCH OLDER THAN YOU BUT ENOUGH [LAUGHTER] JUST ENOUGH THAT WE I DON'T KNOW WE DIDN'T HAVE A COMPUTER AND THE FIRST COMPUTER THAT MY GRANDPARENTS BOUGHT FOR THEIR BUSINESS FILLED UP A ROOM  (fe_03_01839-A-0049)
AND I THINK THEY BOUGHT IT IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES AND IT WAS THE SIZE OF LIKE A TEN BY TWELVE BEDROOM  (fe_03_01839-A-0050)
YOU KNOW IT WAS JUST GIGANTIC IT WAS LIKE WATCHING THE UM OLD T._V. SHOWS WHERE IT TOOK UP A WHOLE ROOM  (fe_03_01839-A-0051)
FOR ALL THOSE BIG WHEELIZED LOOKING COMPUTERS AND ALL IT WAS THAT KIND OF A THING  (fe_03_01839-A-0052)
BUT WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO TOUCH IT  (fe_03_01839-A-0053)
THEY NEEDED IT IT HELPED WITH THE BOOK WORK AND IT HELPED WITH THEIR STUFF BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THAT INTERNET ACCESS THEN  (fe_03_01839-A-0054)
AND WHEN IT CAME TIME TO UPGRADE IT YOU KNOW TO THE SMALLER VERSIONS WHERE THE GUYS KIND OF PUT IT ON THEIR DESKS AND OH MY GRANDMOTHER IS LIKE NO THE ONE WE HAVE STILL WORKS IT'S FINE AND SHE KIND OF GOT LEFT IN THE DUST  (fe_03_01839-A-0055)
BECAUSE NOW COMPUTERS ARE HAND SIZE  (fe_03_01839-A-0056)
AND  (fe_03_01839-A-0057)
THAT OTHER ONE IS SO OBSOLETE I DON'T EVEN THINK THEY COULD FIX IT IF ANYTHING EVER HAPPENED TO  (fe_03_01839-A-0058)
IT IT IS SO OL- IT IS ONE OF THOSE THAT JUST YOU KNOW WILL BE IN A MUSEUM SOME DAY [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01839-A-0059)
BECAUSE I THINK IT IT WASN'T THE FIRST COMPUTER THAT CAME OUT BUT IT IS ONE OF THOSE FIRST FEW  (fe_03_01839-A-0060)
THAT CAME OUT FOR BUSINESSES GENERALLY YOU DIDN'T SEE PEOPLE IT WASN'T A FAMILY SIZE  (fe_03_01839-A-0061)
BUT SHE OH SHE JUST THOUGHT SHE WAS SOMETHING GETTING THAT BUT THEY DID THEY WERE ABLE TO STORE MORE INFORMATION AND DO THINGS QUICKER  (fe_03_01839-A-0062)
SO EVEN THEN THE COMPUTERS WERE GREAT  (fe_03_01839-A-0063)
LIKE HERE IN TOWN I SUBSTITUTE TEACH OVER HERE AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL MY KIDS GO TO AND THE KIDS MY SON PLAYS ON A COMPUTER EVERY DAY  (fe_03_01839-A-0065)
HE HAS MATH GAMES AND READING GAMES AND SPELLING AND HE HAS TO KEEP GOING TILL HE CAN GET IT RIGHT TO GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL  (fe_03_01839-A-0066)
AND I THINK THOSE ARE GREAT THAT IS WHAT I HAVE HERE AT MY HOUSE  (fe_03_01839-A-0067)
BASICALLY THE SAME GAMES AND THEN SOME AND I THINK THE KIDS HAVE LIKE ONE MINUTE TO PACMAN BUT I NEVER SEE THEM PLAY IT THEY DON'T WANT TO GET ON THERE AND PLAY THE GAMES THEY LIKE DOING MORE THE THAT READER RABBIT  (fe_03_01839-A-0068)
THEY LIKE READER RABBIT BECAUSE THE RABBIT TALKS TO THEM  (fe_03_01839-A-0069)
AND TEACH EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE LEARNING SOMETHING THEY THINK IT IS FUNNY BECAUSE IF THEY MESS UP HE'LL SAY NO NO NO WE GOT TO GO BACK AND WE GOT TO HUNT FOR THE INFORMATION  (fe_03_01839-A-0070)
TO MAKE THIS WORK AND THE KIDS LOVE IT  (fe_03_01839-A-0071)
YEAH THEY JUST PUT IT IN ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO THEY GOT THERE'S AT LEAST ONE COMPUTER IN EVERY ROOM  (fe_03_01839-A-0072)
AND THEN  (fe_03_01839-A-0073)
I THINK HERE JUST THE LAST THIS YEAR I BELIEVE IT WAS  (fe_03_01839-A-0074)
BILL GATES WITH MICROSOFT DONATED SO MANY COMPUTERS  (fe_03_01839-A-0075)
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS  (fe_03_01839-A-0076)
NATIONWIDE OR JUST SELECT AREAS OR IF YOU HAD TO BE A POVERTY SCHOOL BUT EACH TEACHER GOT ONE OF THOSE  (fe_03_01839-A-0077)
AND SO MOST OF THE TEACHERS I THINK ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE TEACHERS UP THERE AT THE SCHOOL HAS THE INTERNET ACCESS TO THEIR COMPUTER BUT THE STUDENTS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE THAT  (fe_03_01839-A-0078)
BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY CANNOT PROTECT THEM  (fe_03_01839-A-0079)

INTERACTION WITH WITH THE TEACHER AND OTHER CLASS MATES I MEAN I GUESS IT DOES DETRACT SOMEWHAT FROM AH  (fe_03_01839-B-0018)
PEOPLE HAVING SOCIAL INTERACTION WITH THEIR PEERS BUT FOR THE MOST PART I MEAN IT DEFINITELY HELPS WITH EDUCATION BECAUSE  (fe_03_01839-B-0019)
