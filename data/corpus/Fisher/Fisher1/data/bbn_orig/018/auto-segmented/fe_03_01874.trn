HI JENNIFER I'M I LIVE IN FLORIDA  (fe_03_01874-A-0003)
OH NICE SPEAKING WITH YOU I I I GUESS THE TOPIC IS FAMILY WHAT IT MEANS TO US [NOISE] YOU WANT TO START OR DO YOU WANT ME TO START  (fe_03_01874-A-0004)
OKAY [LAUGHTER] UM  (fe_03_01874-A-0005)
TO ME LET'S SEE AH FAMILY IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF ONE ANOTHER  (fe_03_01874-A-0006)
UM WHO ARE THERE WHEN  (fe_03_01874-A-0007)
YOU NEED TO TALK TO SOMEBODY OR A PAT ON THE BACK OR CONGRATULATIONS OR A PICK ME UP WHEN YOU SEEM TO HAVE TRIPPED AND FALLEN ON YOUR FACE UM I THINK IT'S SOMEONE TO  (fe_03_01874-A-0008)
A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT THAT UM SHARE  (fe_03_01874-A-0009)
UM UM I THINK WE SHARE EVERYTHING  (fe_03_01874-A-0010)
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING THAT YOU DON'T SHARE REALLY  (fe_03_01874-A-0011)
[LAUGHTER] THA- THAT IS VERY TRUE THAT IS VERY TRUE  (fe_03_01874-A-0012)
UM I THINK THERE'S JUST DIFFERENT COMPONENTS TO A FAMILY UM  (fe_03_01874-A-0013)
SOME FAMILIES ARE SINGLE PARENTS AND SOME FAMILIES HAVE MULTIPLE PARENTS AH WITH WITH DIVORCES THAT YOU KNOW YOU'LL HAVE TWO SETS OF MOMS AND TWO SETS OF DADS  (fe_03_01874-A-0014)
SO I WOULD CONSIDER THAT'S AN EXTENDED FAMILY [NOISE]  (fe_03_01874-A-0015)
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT SOMETIMES YOU'RE IN FOR THE ADOPTED FAMILY THAT UM YOU PICK UP ALONG THE WAY YOU KNOW BUT  (fe_03_01874-A-0016)
UM SOMEONE THAT LIVES NEXT DOOR BECOMES AN LIKE AN ADOPTED GRANDPARENT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I THINK I THINK THAT KIND CONSTITUTES A FAMILY MEMBER  (fe_03_01874-A-0017)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01874-A-0019)

YEAH  (fe_03_01874-A-0024)
IT'S A BACK UP SYSTEM  (fe_03_01874-A-0025)
I DON'T THINK IN IN A FAMILY SITUATION UM THAT THERE'S ANYTHING THAT'S TOO BIG OR TOO LITTLE  (fe_03_01874-A-0026)
TOO SILLY OR TOO SERIOUS THAT CAN'T BE ADDRESSED AS A FAMILY UNIT  (fe_03_01874-A-0027)
I  (fe_03_01874-A-0029)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01874-A-0030)
I ALSO THINK YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU CAN MAKE ADDITIONS TO YOUR FAMILY OF COURSE THI- IT WOULDN'T BE A BLOOD RELATION BUT  (fe_03_01874-A-0031)
SOMETIMES YOU MAKE FRIENDSHIPS WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE SO CLOSE THAT THEY ALMOST BECOME BROTHERS AND SISTERS TO YOU OR OR MOMS AND DADS TO YOU  (fe_03_01874-A-0032)
[NOISE] AND AND THAT THAT IN ITSELF WOULD CONSTITUTE A FORM OF A FAMILY UM LIKE I SAID EARLIER  (fe_03_01874-A-0033)
NOT NECESSARILY A BLOOD FAMILY A BLOOD LINE BUT A FAMILY NONETHELESS LIKE IF YOU BELONG TO A SPIRITUAL GROUP WHETHER IT BE A CHURCH OR WHATEVER THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER FAMILY UM [NOISE]  (fe_03_01874-A-0034)
RIGHT RIGHT AND I THINK IT'S JUST A A MATTER OF OF SUPPORT I THINK UM  (fe_03_01874-A-0035)
WHETHER YOU HAVE THE SUPPORT SYSTEM IN PLACE OR YOU DON'T HAVE A SUPPOR- SUPPORT SYSTEM IN PLACE WHETHER YOU FEEL THAT UM  (fe_03_01874-A-0036)
YOU'RE NOT ALONE I THINK THAT'S GOT A LOT TO DO WITH IT IF YOU'VE GOT FAMILY OF SOME KIND THEN YOU DON'T FEEL ALONE  (fe_03_01874-A-0037)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01874-A-0038)
