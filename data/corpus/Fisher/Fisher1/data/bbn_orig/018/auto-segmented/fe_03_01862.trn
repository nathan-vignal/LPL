MHM YEP  (fe_03_01862-B-0039)
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT  (fe_03_01862-B-0040)
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE THING THAT THAT'S WHY IT'S GOOD FOR THEM BECAUSE IN A WAY IT'S AH BECAUSE OF THAT PLAY FEELING I MEAN KIDS LEARN BY PLAY  (fe_03_01862-B-0041)
AND SO WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S A GAME AN EDUCATIONAL TYPE GAME  (fe_03_01862-B-0042)
THEN AH THEY LEARN THEY LEARN 'CAUSE KIDS ARE LIKE A SPONGE YOU KNOW THEY SOAK IT UP  (fe_03_01862-B-0043)
AND SO I KNOW THERE WAS UM  (fe_03_01862-B-0044)
A LADY I WAS TALKING TO THAT SHE WAS SAYING OH IT YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T IT DETRACTS 'CAUSE IT'S VERY ONLY ONE SIDED  (fe_03_01862-B-0045)
AH BUT YOU KNOW WHEN IT WHEN THEY'RE INTERACTIVE I DON'T SEE HOW THEY'RE ONE SIDED IF THEY HAVE TO RESPOND AND ACCORDING TO HOW THEY RESPOND LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE MATH THE MATH ONE THAT SHE HAD WAS REALLY GOOD THEY WERE THEY WERE ALL GAMES  (fe_03_01862-B-0046)
LIKE THERE WAS ONE THAT WAS THE  (fe_03_01862-B-0047)
RABBIT WAS ON A TIGHTROPE  (fe_03_01862-B-0048)
AND THERE WAS A BUCKET OF WATER UNDERNEATH  (fe_03_01862-B-0049)
AND THERE WAS A HIPPO AND AH SHE HAD TO FOR EXAMPLE AT THE BEGINNING SHE HAD TO IT WAS EITHER YOU START WITH SIMPLE NUMBERS LIKE ONE TWO OR THREE  (fe_03_01862-B-0050)
AND  (fe_03_01862-B-0051)
AH THE RABBIT WOULD BE HOLDING UP  (fe_03_01862-B-0052)
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF BLOCKS AND IF IT IF IT WAS THE FOUR BLOCKS  (fe_03_01862-B-0053)
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO CLICK ON THE WATER SO THAT THE RABBIT WOULD DUMP IT DOWN BECAUSE THAT WASN'T THE NUMBER LET'S SAY IT WAS THREE BUT IF IT WAS THREE YOU'D CLICK ON  (fe_03_01862-B-0054)
AH THE HIPPO AND THEN THE HIPPO WOULD DO LIKE A BALANCING ACT HOLDING THE THREE BLOCKS  (fe_03_01862-B-0055)
AND SO  (fe_03_01862-B-0056)
IT WAS REALLY GOOD AND THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE THAT WAS  (fe_03_01862-B-0058)
UM  (fe_03_01862-B-0059)
THINK IT WAS THE SEAL  (fe_03_01862-B-0061)
A SEAL THAT'S LIKE JUGGLING  (fe_03_01862-B-0062)
AND IT'S LIKE ADDING AND SUBTRACTING AND SO IT GOES UP IF YOU DO THE FIRST ONE IT GIVES YOU MULTIPLE CHOICE YOU GET TO PICK ONE PLUS ONE IT WILL GIVE YOU A CHOICE ONE TWO THREE FOUR IF YOU GET IT RIGHT IT WILL GO ONE PLUS TWO  (fe_03_01862-B-0063)
AND THEN IF YOU GET IT RIGHT IT WILL GO ONE PLUS THREE  (fe_03_01862-B-0064)
AND AH IF YOU GET IT WRONG IT WILL START OVER AGAIN ONE PLUS ONE SO IT'S LIKE REPETITION  (fe_03_01862-B-0065)
UNTIL THEY GET IT ALL RIGHT AND THEY GET A EVERY TIME THEY GET SOMETHING RIGHT THEY GET A COUPON  (fe_03_01862-B-0066)
AND THEN THEY GO GET GO TO CASH IN IT'S LIKE YOU SET UP LIKE A CIRCUS  (fe_03_01862-B-0067)
AND SO EACH THING IS LIKE A CIRCUS ONE  (fe_03_01862-B-0068)
AND THEY GO CASH IN THEIR COUPONS TO GET SOME LITTLE FIGURE FROM  (fe_03_01862-B-0069)
THE STORE SUPPOSEDLY YOU KNOW LIKE SOME WOULD BE WORTH THREE SOME WOULD BE WORTH SIX AND SOME NINE SO IN A WAY TOO IT GETS THEM INTO  (fe_03_01862-B-0070)
AH HOW MUCH THEY NEED TO TO BUY OR TO TO CASH IT IN AND SO IT GETS THEM THINKING IN THAT WAY TOO EVEN  (fe_03_01862-B-0071)
SO I REALLY AM FOR THE COMPUTERS BECAUSE I THINK IT REALLY HELPED THEM  (fe_03_01862-B-0072)
MHM  (fe_03_01862-B-0073)
YES  (fe_03_01862-B-0074)
MHM  (fe_03_01862-B-0075)
THAT'S RIGHT AND THEN IT'S NOT NOT WORTH YOU KNOW LIKE I PERSONALLY AM NOT FOR FOR EXAMPLE THE THE VIDEO TYPE GAMES WHERE ALL THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE  (fe_03_01862-B-0076)
CLICKING AND CLICKING TRYING TO  (fe_03_01862-B-0077)
TO SHOOT DOWN THE CAR THE WHATEVER I I DON'T I'M NOT FOR THOSE 'CAUSE I DON'T SEE THOSE THEY'RE THEY'RE ADDICTIVE BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY VALUE TO MY THINKING  (fe_03_01862-B-0078)
WHEREAS THE OTHER EDUCATIONAL TYPE PROGRAMS I THINK THOSE ARE GREAT YOU KNOW [MN]  (fe_03_01862-B-0079)
YEAH  (fe_03_01862-B-0080)
MHM  (fe_03_01862-B-0081)

WELL IF YOU YOU GET IT UM AND YOU SIT DOWN WITH HER AND YOU KNOW THEY CATCH IT UP SO QUICK  (fe_03_01862-B-0087)
THE FIRST THE FIRST THING THEY THEY HAVE TO LEARN LIKE I PUT THE THE MOUSE ON ITS SLOWEST  (fe_03_01862-B-0088)
UM YOU KNOW HOW YOU CAN GET IT SO IT MOVES FAST OR SLOWER ON THE SCREEN AND SO I PUT IT ON THE SLOWEST 'CAUSE ONE THING THAT  (fe_03_01862-B-0089)
TO BEGIN WITH IS THE HAND EYE COORDINATION YOU KNOW THE KNOWING THAT WHEN YOU MOVE YOUR HAND THAT MOVES THE MOUSE  (fe_03_01862-B-0090)
SO THE FIRST PART IS WHEN THEY CATCH ON ABOUT THAT AND THEN THEY HAVE TO LIKE FOR EXAMPLE MY UM  (fe_03_01862-B-0091)
MY FIVE SHE JUST TURNED FIVE TWO DAYS AGO BUT SHE STILL HAS A LITTLE BIT OF PROBLEM GETTING IT YOU KNOW SHE HAS TAKES A LITTLE WHILE WHILE SHE GETS IT CENTERED EXACTLY WHERE SHE WANTS IT BEFORE SHE CLICKS  (fe_03_01862-B-0092)
AND SO IT TAKES A WHILE FOR THAT HAND EYE COORDINATION  (fe_03_01862-B-0093)
YEAH YEAH  (fe_03_01862-B-0094)
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT YOU KNOW THEY THEY HAVE TO THINK IN THEIR MIND THAT ACTUALLY WHAT THEIR HAND IS DOING IS MOVING THAT LITTLE MOUSE TO BEGIN WITH IT'S KIND OF HARD FOR THEM TO GET THAT  (fe_03_01862-B-0095)
AH WELL FUTURE SHOP  (fe_03_01862-B-0096)
OR A AND B. SOUND  (fe_03_01862-B-0097)
OR PLACES THAT YOU KNOW EVEN EVEN PLACES LIKE  (fe_03_01862-B-0098)
WALMART OR I JUST LOOK AROUND TO SEE WHERE YEAH YEAH I JUST LOOK AROUND TO SEE WHERE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01862-B-0099)
THEY HAVE THEM AND AND CERTAIN ONES  (fe_03_01862-B-0100)
LIKE AH RIGHT NOW THAT THEY'RE OLDER MY MY DAD BOUGHT MY OLDER DAUGHTER THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS  (fe_03_01862-B-0101)
ONES WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT AH SHE'S GOT THE ONES THAT WAS UM  (fe_03_01862-B-0102)
ABOUT THE WILD ABOUT THE ANIMALS ANIMAL KINGDOM  (fe_03_01862-B-0103)
AND SO  (fe_03_01862-B-0104)
SO THAT WAS KINDA NICE 'CAUSE IT HAS GAMES BUT BESIDES THAT THEY LEARN THINGS  (fe_03_01862-B-0105)
AND SHE THOUGHT THAT WAS GREAT SHE REALLY ENJOYED THAT ONE  (fe_03_01862-B-0106)
AH SHE DOESN'T ACTUALLY SHE USED TO SHE WENT THROUGH PHASES  (fe_03_01862-B-0107)
UM WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER SHE WANTED TO BE SHE WAS ON IT A BIT EVERY DAY SHE LIKED PLAYING THOSE GAMES BUT NOW THAT SHE GOES TO SCHOOL  (fe_03_01862-B-0108)
SHE'S KIND OF  (fe_03_01862-B-0109)
MORE INTO TO PLAYING WITH HER FRIENDS AND YOU KNOW SO SHE DOESN'T DO IT AS MUCH ONLY ONCE IN A WHILE  (fe_03_01862-B-0110)
SO IN A WAY YOU KNOW LIKE SOME PEOPLE SAY OH IT'S ADDICTIVE AND EVERYTHING BUT YOU KNOW SHE PLAYED A LOT MORE WHEN SHE WAS  (fe_03_01862-B-0111)
WHEN SHE WAS AH ALONE OR WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER BUT NOW THAT SHE'S IN SCHOOL SHE SHE'S NOT AS INTERESTED TO ONLY DO IT ONCE IN A WHILE BECAUSE SHE  (fe_03_01862-B-0112)
