YEAH JUST ACCEPT WHAT HAPPENS AND WHAT GOES ON IN LIFE  (fe_03_01871-A-0050)
[COUGH] DO YOU HAVE A BIG FAMILY  (fe_03_01871-A-0051)
SEE WE BOTH MOVED AWAY SO WE HAVE NO CONNECTIONS HERE  (fe_03_01871-A-0053)
IN OUR TOWN I MEAN WE LIVE IN OHIO SO WE HAVE NO CONNECTION TO ANYBODY HERE  (fe_03_01871-A-0054)
[COUGH] IT'S JUST FUNNY BECAUSE OUR KIDS WILL BE THE FIRST ONES AND THEY'VE LIVED IN ONE AREA THEIR WHOLE LIFE SO THEY CONSIDER THIS IS WHERE THEY'RE FROM  (fe_03_01871-A-0055)
AND AH  (fe_03_01871-A-0056)
THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT THEY WILL ALWAYS FEEL BUT REALLY THEIR FAMILY IS NOT FROM HERE OUR FAMILY IS FROM EAST [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01871-A-0057)
AND AH IT'S JUST ODD HOW IT I THINK THAT NOW THE WORLD IS EVERYBODY IS JUST LIKE IT LIKE YOU SAID THE FAMILY IS JUST YOU AND YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR PARENT  (fe_03_01871-A-0058)
BUT YEARS AGO IT WAS MORE THE WHOLE COMMUNITY WAS YOUR FAMILY  (fe_03_01871-A-0059)
THE WHOLE TOWN BECAUSE YOU WERE RELATED TO EVERYBODY  (fe_03_01871-A-0060)
YOU KNOW [NOISE] YOU WOULD DARE NOT SAY ANYTHING TO YOUR NEIGHBOR IT MIGHT BE A COUSIN  (fe_03_01871-A-0061)
THEY KNEW YOUR PARENTS [LAUGHTER] AND THEY WOULD CALL AND TELL ON YOU HEY HE DID THIS  (fe_03_01871-A-0062)
[MN] SO THERE'S THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE TO THE CHANGE OVER ON FAMILIES  (fe_03_01871-A-0063)
THEY ARE MORE ISOLATED  (fe_03_01871-A-0064)
I THINK THE THE WHEN TOWNS STARTED UM  (fe_03_01871-A-0065)
NOT REINFORCING IN KEEPING THEIR THEIR CHILDREN HOME BY GOING KEEPING UP WITH THE TIMES YOU KNOW LIKE UM  (fe_03_01871-A-0066)
[COUGH] TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OUR SMALL TOWN UM HAD NO JOBS FOR THE CHILDREN MOST KIDS DIDN'T WANT TO LOBSTER FISH OR THEY DIDN'T WANT TO CLAM DIG  (fe_03_01871-A-0067)
OKAY OUR TOWN DID NOT WANT TO  (fe_03_01871-A-0068)
[NOISE] MAKE AN AIRPORT SO THAT YOU COULD BRING IN REVENUE YOU KNOW LIKE HAVE PEOPLE COME TRAVEL TO THE TOWN  (fe_03_01871-A-0069)
HUNTERS YOU KNOW AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO THEY WOULDN'T GO WITH THE FLOW WELL THESE KIDS HAD TO MAKE A LIVING AND THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE A LIVING IS TO JOIN A SERVICE AND LEAVE THE AREA SO THEY LEAVE THE AREA AND YOU LOSE ALL YOUR TIES WHEN YOU MOVE AWAY  (fe_03_01871-A-0070)
YOU DON'T HAVE THE TIES TO YOUR FAMILY YEAH SURE YOU LOVE AND YOU TALK TO Y- YOUR PARENTS BUT YOU LOSE TOUCH WITH COUSINS  (fe_03_01871-A-0071)
AND IF A TOWN DON'T GROW  (fe_03_01871-A-0072)
AND YOUR KIDS ALL LEAVE YOUR TOWN  (fe_03_01871-A-0073)
ALL THEIR CONNECTIONS ARE GONE THEY'VE STARTED SOMEWHERE ELSE YOU KNOW SO THE THE TIES ARE ALL BROKEN  (fe_03_01871-A-0074)
IF THE YOU KNOW THE IDEA IS IF YOU WANT YOUR  (fe_03_01871-A-0075)
KIDS TO HAVE THAT NEAT  (fe_03_01871-A-0076)
LITTLE SET UNIT YOU NEED TO THE TOWNS NEED TO ADVANCE  (fe_03_01871-A-0077)
KEEP THEIR KIDS  (fe_03_01871-A-0078)
ABLE TO SUPPORT THEMSELF TO STAY WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO LEAVE  (fe_03_01871-A-0079)
YOU KNOW MOST PEOPLE WHEN YOU TALK TO SMALL PEO- PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN SMALL TOWNS WILL EITHER LEAVE HOME IF THERE'S NO YOU KNOW I CAN'T MONEY BACK THERE  (fe_03_01871-A-0080)
