IT'S A LOT EASIER FOR THEM JUST PHYSICALLY BECAUSE OF THE PHYSICALITY I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT IT'S A LOT EASIER FOR THEM TO SIT AND TYPE A COHERENT SENTENCE THAN IT IS FOR THEM TO WRITE A COHERENT SENTENCE  (fe_03_01813-A-0031)
AND THE SCHOOL RECOMMENDS THESE LITTLE COMPUTERS THAT ARE MORE OR LESS JUST WORD PROCESSORS AND FOR SOME OF THE KIDS THEY REQUIRE THAT THEY HAVE THEM AND CARRY THEM TO CLASS TO TAKE NOTES ON BECAUSE THEY HAVE SUCH ISSUES  (fe_03_01813-A-0032)
WITH TRANSLATING  (fe_03_01813-A-0033)
WHAT THEY'VE DONE  (fe_03_01813-A-0034)
