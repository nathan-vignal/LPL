L:  Hello -- 
R:  Hi, my name is Margaret Green. 
L:  Hi, I'm Michelle Bracket.
R:  Hi, Michelle.
L:  [MN] How are you? 
R:  Okay -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  Um, the topic is education, is that correct? 
L:  Ahah, I've n- -- this is the first time I've done this, so -- 
R:  Me too [LAUGH]  
L:  Oh, okay [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, it's about -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- computers whether they help or hurt education.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I think they help tremendously.
L:  Yeah, I do too, I think that, um, -- I think that it's important that they learn to do things without computers --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but also to do things with them because I mean you can't find a job unless you have that kind of skill.
R:  That's right and it also teaches you to how research.  There is so many, ah, um, search engines you know, Goggle, Yahoo, ah, --
L:  It makes it so much easier because when I had to do research and do it at had library it takes so much longer --  
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- you don't want to do it and you don't have as much access.
R:  Right.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, yeah, I think it -- I think it helps a lot.
R:  I think it helps -- I -- I think it helps a lot.  It's helped me greatly when I was going to college --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ah, and afterwards and I work on a computer all day long at work and I know that it helps me and, um, my grandchildren use computers -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to research, to, um, ah, just to, you know, [MN] pull down files, anything that will assist them in their, ah, homework and, ah, you know, to -- it's just -- I think it's great, I really think it helps education, I can't see it harming in any way.
L:  Yeah, the only -- the only problem I had is when I was in college --  
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- [MN] I was an education major --  
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and the only drawback is people who don't have the money to buy computers --  
R:  Right. 
L:  -- because I put myself through college [NOISE] and I didn't have the money --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to buy a computer --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- and so it was kinda -- I was kinda behind --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- everybody else because I didn't have all the recourses and I mean that is one thing in college but it's different --  
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- like when you are at a level where you're younger --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- and so I think that's the only drawback and there needs to be some kind of way to be able to help people who can't buy computers to be able to buy them so that they're not that much further behind because the longer -- the later you wait to start using it that mu- you're that much farther behind and they're so expensive.
R:  Right -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- fortunately there are libraries, you know, at least out here in Miami there's enough libraries that you can go to and access a computer if you don't have one --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and there are other, um, agencies that have computer labs available to you.  What state are you in?
L:  I'm in Indiana.
R:  Indiana --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- okay, here I'm in Miami Florida --  
L:  Oh, yeah, I've been there [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [LAUGH] and, um, you know, there's a lot of resources so that if you don't have one and -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- now in school they are supplying -- Governor Bush is supplying, ah, public schools --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- with computers, so the children --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- learning at an early age how to use the computer -- 
L:  [NOISE] Are they -- do you have trouble, um,  -- see, that's the funny thing because like I have a friend who lives in Miami now, she just moved there not too long ago --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she tries to go to the library to use the computers so -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that she can check her email and stuff --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because you have to pay, like, a certain amount of money to go to the cyber cafes and she doesn't want to do that and pay every single time because she doesn't have the money to buy a computer yet cause she just moved [MN] --
R:  Well, yeah, where is she at because the [inaudible] library is free.
L:  Yeah, it's free but she says has to wait a really long time to get on --
R:  Oh.   
L:  -- because there's -- there's always a big long waiting list.
R:  Well, what she should do is find out the schedule and find out when is the, um, you know, what hours are -- are they utilized the least --  
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- and then perhaps she can use them on what days, whether it's weekdays they're heaviest or --  you know, she's going to have to find out from b- [inaudible] or from another library what are the heaviest traffic hours for those computers --  
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- so that she can, ah, you know, try to work around that and possibly get in there and, ah -- you know, hand held, um, you know, the phones, ah -- do you have a, um, cell phone? 
L:  Ahah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, well now they have cell phones where you can just access your -- you know, your computer from -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, get your emails and everything and just, you know. 
L:  [NOISE] She thought about doing that.
R:  Ahah.
L:  But like in the case of students, like if they had a waiting list shouldn't -- should they have, like, -- they should be allowed to go and get on right away.
R:  Well, sure --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I don't know how -- where she's going and --  
L:  I don't know she lives in South Beach.
R:  Is she doing research for a -- for a, ah, project for school -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- or? 
L:  No, like at her case she's just going to check her emails and stuff but, like, if she were a student that would be a big problem, you know, --  
R:  Mhm.
L:   -- like if you had, like, a lot of homework to do or something and you went to the, library and there was, like, an hour and a half waiting list, you know. 
R:  Well, my grand daughter uses -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- computers in schools but she also goes to the library and she doesn't have a problem, so South Beach is a pretty -- if she is going to South Beach, see, there's a lot of tourists there  --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  And I'm sure they're all g- trying to get to a computer to access their emails -- 
L:  Right. 
R:  -- so she needs --  
L:  And she doesn't -- 
R:  -- go to an area -- 
L:  -- have a car, so she can't go -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- anywhere else really.
R:  Or is she in a complex where they have computers -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- available or is she at a hotel, or? 
L:  No, she is in a complex but they -- it's not really a --  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- it's not a real nice one.
R:  Oh.   
L:  -- cause she just moved there, so she --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's kind of temporary housing, so --  
R:  Well, she can also go to, you know, thrift shops where some children buy computers --  
L:  Oh, really?   
R:  -- thrift shops.  Yeah, they have thrift stops, ah, um, and at thrift stops she needs to look at thrift stops because they have -- they're not the latest --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- computers but they'll do --  
L:  Oh, no, yeah.   
R:  -- you know, for her purpose.  She needs to, ah, look at that and, ah, also look at the papers because there is always people selling computers, a neighbor -- neighbors, a newspaper that's for children also, ah, a- accessing and then there's, ah, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- all these -- so many.  Then there's the computer show that comes into town once a month --
L:  Oh, yeah.   
L:  -- and they also -- I've had my, ah, granddaughter go there and I've gotten her a new computer from there and it's, you know, very -- very reasonable --  
L:  Oh, that's good --
R:  -- so, I don't know if she has -- if she doesn't have the money for it she can always go to a flee market and also there are places that give you computers --  
L:  [NOISE] Really?
R:  -- for -- yes, she needs to, um, --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- she needs to get --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ah, um, familiar with the, ah, um, Miami [inaudible] -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, department of, ah, -- I think it's --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ah, wow, I can't think of it off hand right now -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- but they  -- she can just call Miami [inaudible] County -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and get through their offices and find out --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ah, what -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- who should she be calling to see if she can get a computer  --
L:  Oh, that's --  
R:  -- because I know they give them away.  There's -- there's companies that just give computers --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- donate computers --
L:  Oh, I have to tell her that [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- you know, bec-, yeah, please let her know because I know that -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- right now it's so important to -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- have a computer especially if you're in school -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- every household should have a computer.  I think it's that important for, um, you know, children and -- and students. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean they can -- I mean they can save you a lot of money too because she doesn't really have the money to be calling home --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- she doesn't have the money to have a cell phone --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I mean she can email for free --  
R:  Sure.
L:  -- you know, and keep in touch with everybody because her parents are here and her family's here --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, yeah, if there is a place that would give them away and I think that's the -- the same in the case of students like especially -- like I know when I was in college, like, --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because I paid for college it was so hard like buying a computer was not possible cause I mean I had trouble buying food you know, [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] 
R:  I remember those days. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] When you're worried about what you're going to eat [LAUGH] --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- the last thing you can think  --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- about is --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- buying -- 
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  -- a computer  -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- even though it would have helped me so much --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know? 
R:  Right.  I just think it's, ah, it -- it's just, you know it's, ah, it's, ah, I should th- think it's one of the top priorities that a student should have on their mind [MN] you know, on their list to obtain a computer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and really there is so many resources she's new to Miami but if you like I can give you my number and she can call me and I'll try to help her locate a computer.  
L:  That's so nice of you. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  What's your name? [NOISE] 
R:  My name is Margaret Green.
L:  Margaret.  Oh, that's so nice.
R:  And my phone number is -- is three o five --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- nine four seven -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- four nine eight seven and she can call me at any time and I'll --
L:  I'll tell --
R:  -- help her --
L:  -- her that.
R:  -- locate a computer.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, that's so nice, thank you very --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- much.
R:  And what's her name? 
L:  Her name is Amanda. 
R:  Amanda? 
L:  Amanda Major.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, and -- and -- and getting back to education on -- as far as, ah, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I think it's a positive move, I think it's necessary to have a computer and I think children really, ah, benefit by learning -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- how to use a computer.  In fact I read an article not too long ago that it stimulates their thinking, like computer games --  
L:  Yeah and it --
L:  -- and it helps them, you know, calculate and it helps them, ah -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- with their homework -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- actually when they get into study, it helps them think clearer. 
L:  Oh, and I think you're behind if you don't have that experience --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- like, because then when you -- when you go up into the higher grades and people already know how to use them --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it puts you that much further behind.  I think it would be great if like, because, you know, schools recyc- or schools buy new computers on a pretty regular basis --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- I sell computers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, like, all my clients are schools and government agencies --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they have, like, budgets to --  
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- buy new systems.  Every certain amount of time --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- they have to budget it out.  So, like, sometimes they have systems that, you know, they're going to replace that aren't even broken yet --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I think it would be great if the schools started, like, giving those systems to students or, you know, --  
R:  What --
L:  -- or people who needed them.
R:  Exactly, exactly.  I know they give to the handicapped --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, but they should extend that --  
L:  Yeah, they should.
R:  -- I'm -- I'm pretty sure that there -- because I know that they give away computers, you know, like I say they're not the latest model, they don't have -- may not have --
