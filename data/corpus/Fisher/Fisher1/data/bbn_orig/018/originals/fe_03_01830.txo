L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  [several inaudible words] so, we're talking about, um, education in -- in computers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay, I -- I actually I work for a school, um, high school.
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  Yeah, and where I work at they do, ah, we do computers.  Actually I go from classroom to classroom -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and when one of the classroom I go to is a, ah, a computer education class.
L:  Ahah.
R:  Um, I do find that, ah, there is always pros and cons for everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, computers have taken over, you know, not just take- -- I don't mean taken over, I mean computers are the future, actually they're the present and the future, ah, there's a point to learn computers but we can't have computers do the work for us.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, for instance, you know, th- the thing where they go off in high school they talk about calculators, you know, ah, again rely -- rely on calculators to the point, like for me I'm -- I'm, my, ah, weakness is in mathematics --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because I rely on calculators like you wouldn't believe.
L:  I had to have my calculator, I can't use my brain, cause I'm use it being there.
R:  Yeah, same -- same here, I'm mean I -- I'm good at, ah, like for instance music and English, ah, mathematics is my weakness, now, I rely on computers for my mathematics that's suffered.  For a while I was using, um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ah, I -- I stayed away from calculators I use my brain only and I found that I got stronger in mathematics.  Lately, ah, ah, I've been a bit working, you know, working a lot I don't have time --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to really -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- sit there and really write things down I just a calculator.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I use a computer in that sense, I use a computer -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for children to think for them, ah, you know, add things up -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- set things up, graphs for them, um, it's [MN] good for em to learn to use it but if they rely on using it all the time they [NOISE] it -- it -- that handicaps them.  Now, they learn how to use graphs -- for instance graphs constantly and then learn how to use on the computer but still work on -- on graphs, you know, with pen and paper that would be --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- Exceptionally beneficial there.
L:  And [NOISE] I agree [NOISE] cause, ah, when [NOISE] I was in school [NOISE] nowadays everything is going to computers and if I didn't learn it in school then I probably wouldn't have learned it at all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And like now work at work we have to put all the stuff in the computer and I'm like, mhm, and it does have its pros and it's cons.  Like you said with maths you're using the calculator, that's, you know, put a downer on a bunch of us because now we rely on that calculator cause it's just so convenient.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because I know I rely on it, I'm like, I can't think, let me use the calculator.
R:  [LAUGH] same here, same here, exactly.
L:  Cause it -- it's easy but yet there's big pros and cons because you rely on it so much you don't want to actually use your brain, you know, you -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- just want to rely on that computer, that machine, so ... 
R:  Exactly, um, I know that example but for this, ah, I'm -- I'm a musician.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I play guitar and other instruments, mostly guitar.  Um, I'm finding, ah, nowadays technology is taking place of a lot of things, the tricks and stuff they used do in the past.
L:  Mhm.
R:  For instance, ah, we have a thing on the guitar called the whammy[?] bar [MN] one of the tremolo bar, um, we can do a lot of things with it, you can drop or raise a tune -- a tone on it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now they have computerized device that do it for them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Also a wa[?] pedal, now the thing is it's the only set so much you can't improvise or really do something, you're not as flexible, but the problem it's -- it's going towards that where now a lot of musicians don't have the ear, don't have the skill they're using, ah, machines to play to play -- to enhance their playing in the sense of being part them [MN] -- we call [inaudible] in -- in the music industry, um, they'll have -- the devices will replay what they're playing as they're playing it, makes it play -- sound like they're playing faster.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, that takes -- that means there is less skill needed.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, well, and it lost things as harmonizes where in the past -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- musicians used to -- um, [MN] two guitarists would harmonize a solo that requires a- an understand of harmony, perfect timing and a lot of practice that right there is a skill being developed.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, well that has been taken away.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, you can -- for five hundred dollars you can by a process that does everything, wa -- like a wa pedal, talk box everything, ah, we -- we put that I guess that that w- that direction that philosophy into the schools we'll wind up with kids coming out and the school system is suffering --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not -- not just financially here I'm at they're doing a lot of cuts, ah, but the kids are suffering even without the cuts.  Um, they're not working -- they don't seem to be as into -- into school.  I mean kids are never really into school but they are even less.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean when kids used to in the past play games like hopscotch or games of a -- a, you know, playing ball or any kind of team sports, now they're in- indoors with a -- a Nintendo.
L:  Yep.
R:  So, now their activities are sitting down in front of the TV [MN] --
L:  And that's why, you know, like with sports and that they rather sit in front of the TV than go out there and play football and sports and keep the money for your support programs.
R:  Exactly.  Um, a lot of that too affects the behavior, um, with, develop, ah, --  
L:  Yep.
R:  -- developing, ah, social -- social skills, ah, they're learning social skills by playing mortal combat rather than playing the sport -- team sport where they help each -- work as a team.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now, they're just doing it as a fighting thing.  Um, this is you know -- plus with other influences coming in, this is causing a -- a major -- it's causing a problem with the school districts -- 
L:  Yep.   
R:  -- the district -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the school itself.  I mean I have worked in many schools as a sub and I've seen, ah, ah, you know, you see the repercussions of, ah, these habits that these k-, you know, kids are involved in.  Um, you'll see, ah, lot of -- th- there might be some little social gatherings but they're more cliquish than before, more closed in and kind of like how the gangs are, really closed in with themselves --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and hostile to others.
L:  Yep.
R:  Even these kids are not in -- in gangs that way of thinking they're still coming out.  Um, you see a lot more problems a lot of kids are more likely to ditch now than before.  We've seen a lot of the problems that when I was in high school are -- been augmented and even, ah, weren't existing when I was in school and grade school.  When I was in grade school I'd walk in to, ah, campus and I felt safe.  Um, this last year I was working in an elementary school and a child brought some ammunition.
L:  Phew, gosh. 
R:  And a gun.
L:  Oh.   
R:  Sixth --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- grader.  This is a sixth grader --  
L:  That's --  
R:  -- and that's -- 
L:  -- what's the worlds coming to now because --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- phew, -- 
L:  And, um, --  
L:  -- that's a whole other subject [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, ah, it actually does tie in with the subject of computers because if you think about it, what sells?  Computer games, mostly violent games --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and so now the kids are behaving is what they see and what they hear in their music.
L:  Yep.
R:  Which b- basically what they're listening to is computerized, I mean like the rap, all the stuff is just computerized rummaging, um, --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- even the pop music nowadays.
L:  Yep.
R:  Um, there's -- there's cons there [MN] when the computer does the work for the person, um, people are less not -- they don't think for themselves, um, --  
L:  They allow a computer to do it.
R:  Yeah, and, ah, --
L:  [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  -- but what we need to do is have a -- a line drawn, "Here is what a computer can do for you, but do it for yourself". 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, where I'm t- or where I'm working at the kids right now are just learning how to type and how to us, ah --  
L:  Mhm [NOISE] 
R:  -- wor- you know  --
L:  The basic functions?
R:  The basic functions there's nothing really -- I don't see any threat in this, I don't see them, um, becoming, ah, [inaudible] in the brain of this.  Actually in this sense, in this class it would be beneficial.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, it's -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- when -- what could later on --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, um, with -- you know, what can happen later on.  Right now the way I see it, I'm for com- computer education in schools, I'm all for it, I just think it should be, ah, looked at under a microscope.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And make sure that we do not --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- overdo it or do not, ah, cross the line that seems to be crossed -- [MN] not to be crossed, I'm sorry, you know, ah, because, ah, as,  you know, computers get more advances just for the companies to make money they want to be not just user friendly but easier for the person to just get their job done --  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- and doing that it's just like, for instance, in the past when people -- before machines were made people were a much better fit -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they had to do things. carpenters had to -- everything was hand tools.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Nowadays we use machines. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I mean when [MN] back in the days when they had a shovel to pull -- to do work  --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- there's the pros and cons on that --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I mean they got more work done with the machines but now you see people with more --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- health problems being inactive.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And we don't  --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- want this happening with, um, our children's b- -- minds --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- being, ah, closed minded not able to have critical thinking.  So, computers need to be the slaves of the people -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in the sense because they're machines, you know. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Be -- be in our control, we need to be the critical thinkers, but they need to be like the ones that do the -- some of the quick adding up because they can -- they can calculate very quickly.
L:  Yep.
R:  But as long -- I mean I was just watching today a -- a thing on TV about --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  How machines are getting so advanced -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in twenty years they might be replacing people.
L:  Yeah, especially factories and things.
R:  Exactly, exactly --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- factories, I mean we have a lot of people going out of work. 
L:  Yeah, because of ma-
