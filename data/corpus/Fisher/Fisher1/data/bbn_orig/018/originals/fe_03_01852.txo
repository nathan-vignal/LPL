R:  I'm Abraham.
L:  Hi, this is Suzie.  How are you?
R:  Oh, I'm fine.
L:  Good.
R:  I was, like, -- I heard the beep and I was, like, am I supposed to wait for it to stop or something? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I was waiting for it to stop so I could go, and then I realized it's not going to.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So how are you?
R:  I'm good.
L:  Good.  Have you done this before?
R:  No.  So, first time.
L:  Okay, well neither have I.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So [LAUGH] we're supposed to discuss education and computers, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, so what are your thoughts about whether it improves the, the, ah, learning experience, or harms it?
R:  Um, I think it's a good thing.  Um, as long as you can -- as long the students can stay focused on the task at hand.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Computers haven't really helped -- I've had classes where you've had to use laptops in class and do research in class, and things like that, and also just the internet being the advanced resource it is, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, to begin with I think that's why it's a good tool.
L:  Mhm.
R:  As long as you can, you know, go -- find val- val- what, sort of valid sources [LAUGH] and, um, you can tell them apart from, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just people just getting on the internet and putting whatever they want to.
L:  Mm.
R:  And other than that I think it's a pretty good resource.
L:  Yeah.  I, I think it definitely enhances the learning process.  It, you know, I -- um, I think that if kids spend too much time on the computer, it can cause just as many problems as if they spend too much time in front of the TV in terms of they have to be entertained --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or they're totally desensitized to the violence or the violent images that they see, and, um, it doesn't even affect them after a while because they spend so much time looking at these games that they might be playing, or, um, websites that they're visiting.  And, um, I also think it leads to inactivity and [NOISE] obesity if they spend too much time in front of the computer.
R:  True.
L:  So, I think that, in moderation it it's a good thing.  Like you said, the internet is, ah, an incredible invention that we didn't have when I was in, well, high school.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We did in college, I'm not that old, but yeah.  So I would of loved to have that when I was growing up through elementary and junior high and high school.  It would of helped incredibly. [NOISE] It would of been much easier to do at home. [NOISE] Just one second, sweetie.
R:  That's very true.  I see what you're saying.  If you combine that with the TV and, oh, that's trouble.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But yeah, um, me personally, I, I do so much work for school on the computer, it's like, I try my -- I try not to spend too much time -- like, I usually don't have a lot of time to just be on the internet and just look around --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so from my experience it's mostly work.  But, um, yeah, I definitely see what you mean.  'Cause I didn't really have it when I was little either, so I didn't have it 'til high school, so ...
L:  Oh, okay.  Now are you a --
R:  I know where you're coming from.
L:  Are you taking classes now?
R:  Yeah, I'm on my last semester at college.
L:  Oh, okay.  What are you studying?
R:  Marketing and international business.
L:  Oh, okay.  What, what university do you do to?
R:  Temple.
L:  And where's that? 
R:  In Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, okay. [NOISE] Okay, just one second, sweetie.  Can you take your baby over there, please?  Thank you.  So, um, yeah.  I don't -- I don't see how, um, the, ah, -- well, I do see how computers could harm the learning experience, but I think it's minute, ah, in comparison to how much it enhances it.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The best part is being able to have, ah, like magazines and newspapers and everything like that all cataloged in -- right at the click of a mouse.
L:  I know.
R:  As opposed to, you know, going to a large library or, ah, a -- like a, a -- one of those places where they keep, ah, all the old newspapers and magazines in stock and things like that, those places aren't really, you know, not everybody can find a place like that.  So -- and not --
L:  Right.
R:  -- all libraries have every publication.  So having it at the click of a mouse is so convenient.  You know.
L:  Right.  Exactly.  The only other, um, -- there's a million upsides, um, but the only other downside that occurred to me is, um, the lack of, ah, proper socialization.  You don't have to interact with people as much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You don't have to [NOISE] actually talk to people as much, whether it be a tutor or a teacher or a librarian or what have you.  Um, it's much easier just to get everything done without ever speaking to another human being, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.  You know what, I know exactly what you mean, 'cause I -- well, I tried to take a on line class this semester.  It didn't really work out too well.  It's a combination of the teacher and his style, I had him before, I knew how he was.  But at the same time it was really hard to, um, to, you know, ask questions, if you need to ask a question, or, ah, if you wanted to meet with people in class, it's not like you see the same -- the same people every other day, like you had to find time in your schedule to go meet the people and things like that.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You had to find time to go into the teacher's office after, go meet him, but it wasn't that kind of interaction, so it did make it a little harder to learn.  So I had to switch out and get a regular, you know, old fashioned class. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] an old fashioned class.  
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  Wow, that makes me feel old. 
R:  Oh, I'm sorry.  
L:  But yeah, I, I totally understand what you mean.  It, it can just be so isolating, you know, --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  You would never have to -- well, whether you were working or studying or writing a paper or whatever, you just would never have to talk to another human being. 
R:  Exactly.  
L:  But I'd never actually -- 
R:  Especially with these -- 
L:  -- taken one of those on line courses.  I -- so I've never experienced it myself.  But I can imagine that it would be more difficult.
R:  Yeah, I didn't even make it a week, I don't think. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah?
R:  Nah. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But you see now then, now they got, um, -- you can get your degree completely on line.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  They complete on line universities and all that.  That's -- that one's beyond me.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So, um, --
L:  Yeah, I think it's -- you know, the more I think about it and talk about it, the more I think it's kind of a toss up.  At first I thought, well of course it enhances the educational experience, but now I'm thinking, well it's [LAUGH] kinda fifty fifty.  Since there's a lot --
R:  Yeah.  You can only go so far towards -- I, I don't see how to get a complete education on line is really gonna work.  That's kinda hard.  It takes a lot away from the process that I just couldn't see myself doing it.
L:  Yeah.  I would think definitely if you got an entire degree on line, that you would definitely be lacking because part of the whole experience of education is going to the university and interacting with people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and meeting people, and getting in study groups, and -- that's the whole experience, and if you're just in your apartment or in your house with your on line classes --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you're not getting even a third of it, I wouldn't think.  You'd get --
R:  No.
L:  -- the knowledge part down, but there again we're back towards the, the socialization part.  You're not -- Lauren, please don't write on that. [NOISE] Okay, thank you.  But yeah, the socialization part you're not getting.
R:  Definitely.
L:  And, um, well, a million other things that I could spend the next twenty minutes listing.
R:  [LAUGH] Definitely.  I mean, the only thing good about that is that it forces you to study harder 'cause you don't have that interaction, you have to study harder to understand things or else you're not gonna get it.  You're not gonna, you know, you're not gonna do well.  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I couldn't imagine having gone through these last four years without that interaction, the social interaction.  It probably -- it's the best part of being here in school.
L:  I know.  I know.
R:  You meet so many people.
L:  That's true, that's -- yeah.  You would be missing out on so much, I would think it would make the learning process very dry and boring.  And if you had a question it certainly wouldn't be very easy to get it answered.  You couldn't necessarily stay after class.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I'm sure they have -- I don't know how, but I'm sure they have ways set up on the on line -- get your degree on line to ask questions, but, you know, do you have to wait twenty four hours --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- for a response? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Email, I suppose they'll get back to you at some point.
L:  Exactly.  And then if that brings up another question, okay, you send another email, and then you wait another day -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that, that would get very tedious and very annoying, I would think.
R:  Yes.  Yes, yes, yes.  So [MN] I'm sorry.  Um, yeah, you made me really realize how -- like, I thought it was -- I, I, I, I, ah, had to broaden my idea of the whole computers in education 'cause when she first said that I'm just thinking, "Oh, you mean like using Powerpoint and everything", but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- once you bring the internet in it's a whole nother monster.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
R:  'Cause I definitely use Microsoft Office a lot, 'cause actually being a business major --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- doing all types of presentations and papers, and, you know, things like that.  But, um, we -- yeah, when she started talking about the internet, that's where -- that's a whole nother monster.
L:  Well yeah, it opens up the whole world to you at your fingertips.  It's -- it's incredible if you really think about, what did we do before the internet?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just amazing.
R:  And I -- and it's all -- and it's so fast now too, that --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you can get everything.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Like
