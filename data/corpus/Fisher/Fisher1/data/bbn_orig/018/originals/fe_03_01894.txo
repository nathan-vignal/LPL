R:  [inaudible] 
L:  Hi my name is David Cullen. 
R:  Hi I'm Ally. 
L:  Hi Ally and where are you from? 
R:  Um, I'm from, um, Box County Pennsylvania but I go to school in Monclaire in New Jersey.
L:  Oh, okay and I'm in Fort Lauderdale Florida.
R:  You're what? 
L:  I'm in Fort Lauderdale Florida.
R:  Oh, wow.  Pretty far.
L:  So how would you like to begin with this? 
R:  Um, I don't care -- uh, well the question was what does family mean to you?  Is that what they said? 
L:  What -- what was that again? 
R:  What -- didn't they say the topic was what does, uh, family mean to you? 
L:  Right -- correct.  Um, --
R:  You can start if you want.
L:  Um, well --
R:  [NOISE]  
L:  I'm -- I'm married and I -- I have been married for quite a while and I have a three year old son and I try to basically get involved with my family because, um, family means a lot to me you know and, um, I try to be around a much as I can as I can if I work out of my home.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How about you? 
R:  Um, yeah my family is really important to me like, um, I think -- I've -- like I've always kind of felt that I'm closer to my family than a lot of my friends or like other kids my age like my -- like my parents are really cool like they're two of my best friends and I have a brother that's a year and a half older than me and a sister that's four years younger and we're all just really close because we get along really well so.
L:  That's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, you know as long as you can stay close to your family, um, they help you out through thick and thin and [inaudible] good times and bad times but that's what family life is all about you know you go through good times and you go through bad times.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you know, uh, as life goes on you know people's lives change in their family lives as well as their personal and, um, I hope it counts, um, go on life and, um, that's part of life and family.
R:  Yeah I feel like -- like knowing that they'll be there that make -- makes me like more willing to try new things and like and go off and do things like I'm -- I'm, uh, studying abroad next year in Spain like five months and I think if I wasn't like that close to my family I would be kind of scared like you know I'll leave the -- the like people would forget about me or something.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Like I'll get back and they'll just be there you know.
L:  They give you guidance and that's important you know, it's important to you know if they're going to give you some type of direction that they might see or might thinks to help you to make your life a little bit easier and it's good to experience all different parts of a world especially overseas and the capabilities.  I've been to Madrid, uh, also and it's a nice community.
R:  Have you really?
L:  And people are friendly. 
R:  Yeah did you -- did you spend a lot of time in there? 
L:  Actually I spent two weeks here on business and, um, I got to learn the culture, and understand that people's lives are more relaxed in a lot of sense and they have determination which is important because that builds stability.
R:  Yeah I can't wait to go, I'm so excited.  I'm going to Brazil -- The University of Brazil.
L:  Oh, that's interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you are going to be studying what? 
R:  Um, I'm, um, majoring in communications, um, but I'm going to be taking like some general education things like -- but I'm -- I think I'm taking like some world history and literature courses and stuff.
L:  Well that's good and also possibly a little political science will help a little too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know it gives you different views of how cultures are all over and you'll have a better eye to seeing it than just one sided unfortunately.
R:  Yeah I know that they said they have, uh, one class that's completely dedicated to like, um, travelling around and learning about the cultures of like the surrounding areas.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You get -- you get free credits for learning about like --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  Which is pretty interesting and it's really cool because it will be so easy to travel around to different places like -- like Portugal and France and everything.
L:  Well they -- they look at life a lot differently than we do here in [COUGH] America.  But then their lifestyle is a little bit different than what we were brought up with so -- but it will be a nice time.
R:  Yeah what -- what are some of the differences that you noticed?
L:  Well I think it was a little bit more slow paced than here in the United States we're -- we're not basically believing that we have to go from one place to another place and, uh, we don't have time for different features maybe even sometimes family we don't have time for because we're that busy.  There is a little bit different, family is important in a lot of ways differently than here because they make time a little bit more than what we do unfortunately.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So you'll have a good time and, um, these communications are always good because you're learning about different aspects of life and family depending on where you live in the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- United States or in the world.
R:  Yeah definitely.  I used to [inaudible] but you don't sound like you're from Florida. 
L:  No I recent --
R:  Are you originally from there? 
L:  Oh, no I was originally born in Brooklyn, New York.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  [inaudible] that's a long time ago but I've lived in Florida for about twenty five years.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  It would be a lot worse if I wasn't.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you definitely sound like -- like lot of the people up here.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well I was born in -- I was born in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the City of New York and, uh, everything was so fast paced and now I'm just trying to relax myself.
R:  Yeah, well Florida's a good place to do it. 
L:  Yeah, have you ever been to Florida? 
R:  Yeah I've been there a couple times, just -- well mainly like to Disney World. 
L:  Oh, okay but it's a little bit warmer than what you're used to.
R:  Oh, yeah, definitely.
L:  Yeah, well we don't -- we don't get the humidity as -- as it is up in the North.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And in Pennsylvania you get a lot more humidity than we do [inaudible] near the water a lot so temperatures might be around the same but it's not as hot.
R:  Yeah I spend my summers um, at the Jersey Shore.  [inaudible]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Especially like humid down there it's still cold here, I'm freezing.
L:  Well it'll start getting warmer [inaudible] like in May and June.
R:  Yeah it -- it's just crazy there will be like a couple days where people are walking around in like shorts and T shirts and then the next week everyone's wearing their winter coats again.  It's really unpredictable.
L:  Oh, okay so, um, have you done a lot of these communications? 
R:  Uh, like this -- this phone study? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  No I've never done this before.  A -- a friend of a friend had a thing about it and he -- he was really suggesting it and asking people to do it because he has like a referral code that he gets -- I think he gets money if people do it.
L:  [NOISE] Right and you can -- you can also also get a little money too and learning about different [inaudible] that could be towards everybody.
R:  Yeah, I figured why not.
L:  So they usually come in on the communications I guess.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah I guess I don't know -- now I have friends asking me to do it cause they want the money. 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  College students will to anything for money.
L:  Oh, for sure.
R:  My brother was a -- he did a study on different nasal sprays and he was like testing them and we're like, "Aren't you worried about side effects?" and he's like "I get paid like sixty bucks I don't care".
L:  [NOISE] That would be great anyway to make money is always important.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  [NOISE] So this is the first time you have done one?
R:  Yeah this is my -- my first call.  I -- I wasn't sure uh -- that happened pretty soon because I just signed up for it yesterday.
L:  [NOISE] Right I signed up for it a couple days ago, this is actually my first call also.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, it's interesting I think it's going to be good for, um, everybody.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I don't know -- I don't know if they come in on the line or directly just disconnect the call at ten minutes.
R:  Yeah I don't know, um, they said it's a -- it's a study for like -- it's just studying how people talk to each other when they don't know each other when they have an objective.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  Or what 
L:  [NOISE] Well they want to see how people think unfortunately but -- that's -- makes [inaudible] everybody.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Alright I guess, um, after the call I guess someone hangs there will be a buzz or something like that.
R:  Oh, has it been more than ten minutes?
L:  I think it's been about fifteen minutes.
R:  Oh, okay, um, I thought they said that someone comes on the line.  I don't know maybe I -- maybe I misheard them, but it says like they'll like disconnect the call and then you can have a time to make comments or something.
L:  I'm not even sure myself cause like I said we're both our first time.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  My wife is going to start doing it also.
R:  Oh, she's doing it too. 
L:  What was that?
R:  Your wife's doing it too you said.
L:  Yep.  [NOISE] It's good -- it's [NOISE] yeah well I'm still looking for the form itself [NOISE] okay after ten minutes [NOISE] email -- basically after your twelve to eight minutes stop the subject, you can read feed back [NOISE] yeah -- well I only -- the thing I think about is this thing will be good for everybody to learn how people look at life and family and [inaudible] world and you?
R:  Yeah, I think it will be a really interesting study.  I'd be interested to find out the results of what they can conclude about like absolute strangers just talking to each other for like ten minutes and probably be very beneficial.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  I know I learnt stuff like that as a communications major all different studies about the different ways people communicate and different depths and demographics and stuff.
L:  [NOISE] Alright well it's nice talking to you.
