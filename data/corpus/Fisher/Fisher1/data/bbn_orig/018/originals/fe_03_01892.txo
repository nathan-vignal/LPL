R:  Oh, wow I have family up there. 
L:  Really? 
R:  Yeah I can't remember the name it's a small town, begins with a P [inaudible] or something -- I don't know what it is.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible]
R:  No -- I don't know it's something -- it's a very, very small town where they don't have any Walmarts or anything --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- like [inaudible] drive like a mile away to get to -- I mean on hour away in order to get to the city.
L:  Oh.
R:  I can't remember the name [inaudible] [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I have some relatives up from Bolder and Denver and stuff like that, they moved down here.
L:  Oh.
R:  So I've been over there before.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Cool.
R:  So what does family mean to you?  Do you have a family? 
L:  Um, yeah I have a husband and three kids.
R:  Three kids, wow I have a fiancee and one child, she's two. 
L:  Oh.
R:  Two and a half, so I'm at that stage right now.
L:  Yeah -- you having any more kids? 
R:  Um, probably later once we get married and all we're thinking about having some more kids.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know it's hard -- you know bringing her up in this crazy world.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah I know.
R:  You know, um, -- um, I did this topic earlier today -- um, -- well I think family -- my -- my grandfather -- one of my grandfathers that lives in Florida, he just passed and my father -- my grandfather that's living here he's real sick.
L:  Oh.  
R:  So family is very important to me especially when I'm -- I'm twenty five.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I see that my family's growing smaller.
L:  Right.
R:  Great uncles and all are leaving me, you know friends sometime are passing and you know when you're younger you don't have that -- you don't even see that -- you don't even know what it is.
L:  Right.
R:  And what's more with September eleventh and all of that just makes you appreciate what you have small or big.
L:  Yeah it does and I guess --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you never know when family may be gone.
R:  Exactly so you have to appreciate it now, and I mean I -- I don't live that far from my grandfather, but he does like -- he doesn't ever want me to go over there it's always something.
L:  Oh.
R:  So -- you know he's just old and wants to do things by himself and I want to be there for him. 
L:  Right.
R:  You know and --
L:  Cause when he's gone he's gone.
R:  Right and I call him every day to hear his voice cause you never know when somebody's last words -- not just him cause I know he's sick but even my mother cause she travels you know on the interstate a lot and I mean you never know what -- what could happen and my father he travels a lot on aeroplanes for business, and you know especially you know September eleventh I mean I bring it up all of the time it's like you never know if you're gonna at the wrong place.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  That's true
R:  At the wrong time, and even myself travelling with my daughter just going to the grocery, I mean you never know and it's like I think everybody is suspicious to me now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I always look at people and think you know, I wonder if this person is about to pull [inaudible] you know and -- I mean I remember driving on September eleventh cause I had to go return a movie and people were driving like they were crazy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'm like calm down you know I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- why do you have to act like this and -- and curse me out or whatever and you know you don't -- I mean everybody thought the world was ending. 
L:  Right.
R:  And there was no peace.
L:  No.
R:  I mean there was still hatred you know -- you look at somebody -- you know I got cursed out the other day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  When you're driving and you get flipped off --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it's like is it really all that.
R:  Right, can't we all just get along?
L:  Yeah exactly.
R:  Cause you never know when it is our time. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You might flip that person off and a mile down the road and then they get in a big old car wreck you know -- I mean.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, and then you say oh man --
R:  I shouldn't of done that.
L:  -- and you always have to think they're probably a nice person, they might just be having a bad day.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  Right.
L:  And they have a -- they probably have a family obviously somebody probably loves them and 
R:  Right -- right.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  But I mean I know that I strongly -- you know I did -- you know I mean I had a child out of wed lock and I kind of went against my parents -- you know -- I had to drop out of college, and then I ended up -- I'm back in it now.
L:  Right.
R:  But they supported me through everything you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE]  they're really -- really good parents and I have to always thank them for that you know at first they weren't all there for me, but I mean they came through.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They handled it better than I thought they would and now you know this is their grandbaby you know -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- they want her all of the time and you can have her.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, but I -- I love my daughter she's -- she's wild and I stay home during the day with her.  [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, yeah.  And I go to school and, um, -- it's hard -- hard living like this but, um, --
L:  It is.
R:  We'll make it.
L:  I'm a nurse so I  -- so families change all the time.
R:  Mhm -- oh yeah.
L:  Cause people get in a car accident and horrible things happen to them and then all of a sudden you see their family come together --
R:  Right.
L:  -- around this one person who's been injured horribly and um -- I guess they don't realise what they have until they --
R:  It's almost gone.
L:  -- almost -- yeah.  You know they come close to losing a family member.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  So it's kind of neat to see that.
R:  Right yeah my boyfriend he had taken a fall in his job and they thought he was gonna die.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he wasn't talking to his mother then, and now they're -- they're close.  They're very, very close cause she realised --
L:  Mhm.  
R:  You know she almost lost her son, you better like get through our differences right now.
L:  Right.
R:  And some people have that chance which is lucky you know my mu- -- my friend's mother she just passed but they knew she was very sick, and she got a chance to tell her what she had to, but a lot of people they don't have that chance.
L:  Right -- right -- that's true.
R:  That you should always be close no matter what.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  You know so -- 
L:  I'm --
R:  -- I'm close to my parents.
L:  I think a lot of people should let bygones be bygones.  You know how some people hold a grudge for years and years?
R:  Right.
L:  My mother in law's like that.
R:  Right.
L:  She doesn't speak to her mother because of something that happened twenty years ago that she can't even remember.
R:  Right.
L:  And that's sad.
R:  Right exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You just have to like -- cause you never know when they're gone.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Then you're gonna wish that you would of just settled that problem.
L:  Yeah and it was probably something totally ridiculous.
R:  They probably don't even know what it is.  [LAUGH]
L:  No she really doesn't.  She doesn't remember what it was about.
R:  So forget it.
L:  Yeah but she won't talk to her because her mother won't be the first one to call.  Like oh man.  [LAUGH]
R:  But the phone works both ways.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  You know so I mean what's she gonna do -- if you don't want to pick up the phone, pick up a pen.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know you do whatever you can especially you know all of this stuff others -- I don't -- I don't think I know anybody out there but like when I was in college, a lot the mail they would go every month to their little thing you know and, um, -- I -- I really want to contract them to see if there is anybody cause that was part of my family cause I mean your friends are your family too that's how you choose your family.
L:  Yeah definitely.
R:  And I would like to know if there is anybody that is over there but I just you know -- I just -- it's my fault because I don't try to contact.  I have email addresses that I could go ahead and figure is out but I -- but I don't -- I just [LAUGH] -- there's other -- I think that there is other things that are more important but really it's not because they need me to write a letter.
L:  Right.
R:  You know they haven't heard from me in five years.  Hearing a -- you know getting a letter from somebody you know, wow I'm thinking about you I support you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that would be nice.  It's just I'm lazy.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah I know it's hard sometimes to just take the time but then yeah they are worth the time.
R:  Right they are especially I feel so bad when I see all the families up on there and it's like I could make a difference I need to call them up too.
L:  Right.
R:  To say well even though they're not part of my family now, they were.
L:  Yeah -- definitely.
R:  But it's hard.
L:  Friends are definitely part of family.
R:  Right and I mean it's still sad you know cause I try to stay very, very close.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  With mine the ones that are here and the ones that are far away those are the ones that I am losing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I never really got a chance to be close with them and then I started feeling bad.
L:  Right.
R:  Because now it's too late --
L:  Yeah it does make you feel bad.
R:  Um it was just too late you know because I don't fly.  I've -- I flew when I was young and I just had bad experiences and then when I got older I just never flew again.  I think the last time I flew was in ninety six.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And when my grandpa was sick I wouldn't fly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  To go see him because I just -- I was scared to death of flying and [NOISE] you know now he's gone and I wish you know if I would of just gotten on the plane and just to see him.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I just -- it's just a fear of mine [LAUGH] I just can't fly.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's nothing to do with September eleventh or anything like that.  That is just my personal fear and --
L:  Uh.  
R:  And I've just had bad experiences [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know and I don't know -- I want to -- I need the get passed all of that cause I'll never go anywhere if I don't fly.
L:  Right.
R:  You know I used to fly to Colorado every summer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, we'd go -- I went to [inaudible] and Denver you know the -- I would go in the summer time and then we would go on the mountains up there that were snow all --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know all year.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  So 
L:  Maybe a nice short flight to see somebody would help you.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah I had boyfriend -- yeah I mean I had a boyfriend he had a plane.
L:  Oh.
R:  His dad had a plane and he was gonna go fly around the city and I would not -- wouldn't go.  [LAUGH] And that was just a little bitty plane just going over the town and I just -- I don't know.
L:  I don't know about that.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know not knowing -- it's like I'm scared and I don't want my daughter to go.
L:  Right.  
R:  I don't know because it's something that I don't like and I don't want to put her in something -- I don't know I'm scared of the unknown -- I'm scared I don't have control.
L:  Right.
R:  Let's say you're  you're safer in a plane than in a car, but I think I have control over my car sometimes you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah you do too cause you're the one driving.
R:  Right but then there's crazies out there so I just feel safe cause I mean I think I have control --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- over what I'm doing [LAUGH] like I to be the one driving too I don't like somebody else cause it makes me nervous.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right yeah it makes me nervous too.
R:  So -- yeah you run out of things to talk about in ten minutes.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  [LAUGH]
R:  But you have -- you have you have, um, -- how big is your family you have a husband
