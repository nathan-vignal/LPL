L:  Hello? 
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name's Gina.
L:  I'm Pamela.
R:  Hi.  Where are you from?
L:  Um, I'm in Utah right now.
R:  Utah.  I'm in Texas.
L:  Oh, okay.  Where at in Texas?
R:  Close to Dallas.
L:  I'm sorry, what?
R:  Close to Dallas.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Cool.  No, I'm about an hour and a half north of Salt Lake City.
R:  Oh.  Huh.
L:  So.  That's really -- I live in a valley, it's, it's really pretty up here, between the mountains.
R:  Yeah -- is that where you're from?
L:  No, my dad was in the Air Force. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know where I'm from. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I understand completely.  My dad was too.
L:  So. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's how I grew up.
L:  Yeah, people are, "Where are you from?"  I'm like, "Well, your guess is as good as mine". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, what do you mean?  Where do I live or where was I born? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Well, exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, ah, --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- the topic.  Computers in education.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do they --
R:  I wish they had them when I was being educated. [LAUGH]
L:  They did when I was in elementary school, like Macintosh had, you know, donated all -- I was in the age of the Macintosh donated all the Apple computers to the schools, and so that's what we learned on in elementary school and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, ah, --
R:  Well, I was in, let's see, was it ninth or tenth grade, I think -- I think it was tenth grade.  They just had those brand new floppy disks out --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they didn't have the plastic cover, you know, they had the paper --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- casing. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  And that's what they had.  If that dates me, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I think computers are great for school.
R:  Oh, --
L:  I mean, the world of information that they received and --
R:  Yes, my son is in fourth grade, he just did a report on another city in Texas, and --
L:  It's so much easier, 'cause I remember in elementary school when we wanted to write about another ci- city, we'd always write to, like, the Chamber of Commerce of that city, for them to write back and give us information.
R:  Yeah, and hope you got it back in time for the report.
L:  Oh, exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, that was what was so great, I sit down there and showed him how to, to find the Chamber of Commerce, and that's what he did, he emailed them.
L:  Yeah, oh yeah, email. [LAUGH] It's like, --
R:  And the very next day he had his information in the mail for his report, you know, and --
L:  What would we do without email? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I know, I know.
L:  Oh, I -- we live off email, and when I was, um, I'm stay at home now -- I'm a stay at home mom, but when I was working --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I wouldn't even ever see my boss except for email.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's how we correspond --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and so, yeah, I mean, it's so impersonal now, but you get a lot more -- I mean, a lot more information a lot faster.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So he's just learning, and, um, my sixteen year old's pretty good, they all have computer labs, you know, and oh well, of course, in all the schools they all do now.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, that's just standard.
R:  Yeah.  And I think it's a good thing.
L:  I do too.
R:  I really do.
L:  I mean, it's really evolved into -- wow, you can even -- I couldn't even imagine ten years ago what it'd be -- you know, computers would be so dominant now and what --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you get and what you use them for.
R:  Right.  And they almost have to teach it in school because it's a common everyday thing now.
L:  Oh yeah.  Absolutely.
R:  It's just something that -- it just is a part of your life now, so.
L:  Abs- -- and you know, they do, they do a lot of classes for, you know, older, seniors and elderly people --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- because it's such a way of life that, you know, oh, email?  How -- what's -- you know, how do I do that, and to even, yeah, a sixth grader it's, like, common knowledge.
R:  Right.  That's how my parents are.  We keep saying, "Why don't you guys get the internet, you know, [LAUGH] we can email these to" -- they live in Missouri.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Like, "We can email these pictures to you", and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "Well we don't know anything about it".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And my dad's sister, he tells -- she told him, she says, "It's because you don't want to know --"
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  "-- you don't want to learn". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well that's the nice thing about -- with my parents, they're, you know, back in Nebraska and, and I have two small girls and so I -- you know, we always email pictures and, and that sort of thing -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's -- you keep in touch a lot easier.
R:  Yeah, I think it's great.  We've -- I also have a daughter that's -- she's just turned one, and we were looking on there for, um, games for her.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And she has just, like, in the last month, has gone from the keyboard banging to where she knows how to grab the mouse, and she's learning how to move it around, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] See I'm afraid to do that with Rose, my two year old. 
R:  Yeah, well, I tell you, the big drawback is, she wants on the computer all the time. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I bet.  'Cause I, 'cause I -- we're all -- my husband's in -- he's getting his masters and so he's doing his homework all the time on the computer, and I'm alw- I research, I look up -- I read a lot --
R:  Oh, I do too.
L:  -- on the computer --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- look up stuff and research, and, and I've learned so much, I just, I'm, like, a sponge for learning different things, and --
R:  Oh, I understand completely. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I've learned -- oh, especially with my, you know, my last pregnancy I was on there just reading about, you know, dulas[?], and all sorts of things, and now I want to become a dula[?], so I'm, like, doing all my research on the internet, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm just learning so much, and I'm really glad it's -- for me being a stay at home mom, it's great to have that source of, you know, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for me it's my education, almost. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.  Exactly.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.  We kinda debated about putting her up there and seeing what she could do, but, ah, --
L:  There's a web site called knee bouncers dot com that is great for toddlers.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  Knee bouncers dot com.  They, like, go on there and they, like, when they hit the keyboard and stuff like that it makes music or whatever, and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's really fun.  And [LAUGH] so their banging is actually doing something. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right. [LAUGH] Yeah, that's kinda how these little software programs that we found, ah, for her, are -- there's -- you know, whatever key she hits will do something else, and --
L:  I go to nic junior a lot too, because there's little games on there that they can play.
R:  Yes, yes, that's my fourth grader, nic junior all the way.
L:  Oh yeah.  My daughter's just used the computer, she's like, "Dora, Dora". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] yeah. [COUGH]
L:  Oh, it's like, yeah, education and computers go in hand in hand, I think.
R:  I do too, nowadays, they almost have to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's just now way around it.
L:  Oh yeah.  I just think, I mean, in the classroom, I mean, students can -- [NOISE] there's one class that was going and, and being email pen pals with people over in Kuwait, you know, and it's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- not just -- that's really neat to have that.
R:  Yeah.  Well I'll tell you another big thing that I think is great, where my, my two older ones, um, if they can go to the library and look things up, or if we can do it at home --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for the reports and things -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- I don't have to drag my one year old to the library and disrupt everybody at the library while we're looking through encyclopedias.
L:  No kidding. [LAUGH]
R:  You know? [LAUGH]
L:  I, I know when I was in high school, though, in my senior year there was a lot of problems with plagiarism and the internet.
R:  Yes.
L:  Because teachers don't really have a resource to know if that's actual plag- plagiarism --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because you know, before computers it was easy to -- [MN] super easy to know whether it was -- they were copying it right out of a book, but now the resources are so unlimited that -- I know that's been a big problem in high school.
R:  Yeah, I bet that is.
L:  But I think the, the positive outweighs the, the negative by far.
R:  Yeah, and I know too, on the plagiarism thing, we always had to write down our source exactly.
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  So the teacher could go back.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I think, you know, maybe if they kinda still pushed that a little bit, like my sixteen year old, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if they would have to write down the web site, you know.
L:  They do, they have a -- they have the -- in the English -- in how you write some of the reports, the little booklets, I can't -- I can't remember what it's called, but they have the exact way of how to resource the web site, or, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to write it down.  So --
R:  Yeah, so maybe -- I don't know, I agree with you though, I just think that there's probably just almost no way to -- you know, for the teacher to go check every single little report.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And -- but still --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think it's a good thing.
L:  Definitely. [SIGH] And I -- overall, you know, it's great just having that resource, the internet, to, you know, with my parents, that's just a big thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Keeping in touch with them better.
R:  Yeah.  We use it for everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just, like my son just got a burn on his leg the other day, you know, and looked that up on the internet.  Well I decided, okay, he really needs to go to the doctor.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And it --
L:  I do that all the time if I'm sick, I'm like, "Okay" -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And we're new to this area, and I didn't know where the children's hospital was, where the doctor had told me to take him.
L:  Mm.
R:  So what'd I do?  I sat down on the computer and brought up map quest, you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, now I know where I'm going.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, it's, it's a good thing.
L:  Sure, definitely.
R:  I think we keep straying from education, but I, I think it's all tied in.
L:  Yeah, oh, 'cause you learn so much with the internet and that's, you know, part -- educating yourself and learning the different things and keep -- um, keeping an open mind, and I think the more you learn -- I mean, learning, you learn every day, and that's part of educating yourself.
R:  Right.
L:  Um.  Mm.  It seems like the ten minutes is probably almost up. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] probably close to.  I know sometimes -- is this your first call?
L:  No, I --
R:  No.
L:  -- gosh, I've had several.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, this is only my third, but it still -- it seems like even the first two, you'd just get warmed up to the topic and that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- little tone comes on. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I was afraid I'd really kinda get into it, start talking about something and then get that beep.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So.  But I've been so tired lately too, so I don't even know how coherent I am.
R:  [LAUGH] Very.  You're very coherent. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Much more than the last woman I talked to. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I've had some interesting people too. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
