R:  Hi.
L:  Hello, hi. 
R:  Hello, I'm Maria Gozin[?], how are you? 
L:  Fine, you said your name is what now? 
R:  Maria.
L:  Maria, I am Richard from, ah, Mississippi.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  What -- what state -- what state? 
R:  I'm in Seattle, Washington.
L:  Settle Wa- ooh, ooh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We're quite a distance from each other.
R:  Yes, we are.
L:  [COUGH] Do you get a lot of rain -- you get a lot of rain in Seattle, don't you? 
R:  Oh, we get a lot of light, yeah.
L:  A lot of rain.  Well, right now, it's -- it's in Mississippi it's spring time.
R:  Oh.
L:  And everything's green and the flowers are blooming.  It's real pretty this time of the year.
R:  Yes, we have -- we -- 
L:  But we hate the summertime down here.  The humidity is so bad it -- you can cut it with a knife.
R:  Yep. [LAUGH]
L:  East [inaudible] near here.
R:  No, it's always nice here. 
L:  My wife -- my wife and I hate summertimes in the -- in the south.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Especially in Mississippi.
R:  [LAUGH] No.
L:  But we -- we're supposed to talk about computers and education.
R:  Very good.  So what's your -- so what's your view?
L:  [LAUGH] Well, ah, well, one thing I have a son, a freshman in college in Mississippi State University, and he has, ah, he's declared his major as a computer science -- 
R:  Good for him.
L:  -- degree, so he's -- he's doing real well in college right now.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  At Mississippi State and then so hopefully he's got a friend that just, ah, [COUGH] he's a freshman too and he's co-opping.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So what they do like that, he -- he -- ah, they work with him and they try to find him a job, so he -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he went to work for I think the, what was it, Security Administration [NOISE] NSA, National Security Administration, in -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- Leesburg, Virginia or something like that.
R:  Oh, very good.
L:  So that's good.  What, ah, -- as far as computers, we have, ah, -- we have three computers in our home but I'm the least knowledgeable of all.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because I'm -- I'm -- when I -- I'm forty nine years old and so when I went to school, you know, we didn't -- we didn't have computers.
R:  Right.
L:  But, yeah, the -- I have four children and they all -- they know more about computers than I do.
R:  Yes.
L:  So I have to ask them.
R:  That's how it is, that's right. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] You have children? 
R:  I have one.  He's three and a half, he's three and a half. 
L:  You have one, three and a half? 
R:  Yeah. He has full --
L:  Oh, okay, well, that's great.  You got your hands full then with a three and a half year old.
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  You sure do.
R:  Yes.  He's, ah, ver- very computer savvy already so -- 
L:  I know.  These, ah, no, -- this generation growing up now, with children, they're -- they learn in school now, they have computers in classes and -- 
R:  Uh-huh, right. 
L:  -- and -- and plus the kids growing up with the Nintendo's and all that kind of stuff.
R:  Right, right. [NOISE]
L:  So they go to it, it's easier for them.
R:  Yes.
L:  But anyway, ah, interstate -- 
R:  Yes. [NOISE]
L:  Say, this is my second time I've got to talk through the Penn State programme.
R:  Oh, very good.  Well, it's my first time.
L:  Is it, first time?
R:  And I haven't been home for the last three 'cause they've been trying to call me, so -- [LAUGH] what --
L:  [LAUGH] Well, you -- you -- you say you're computer savvy? 
R:  Um, yeah, well, I --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I -- I -- I was doing my PhD when I, ah, got pregnant so after I had my son, I stopped when he was one.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Um, I'm taking a little break so I can raise him for a while.
L:  Oh, okay. P --
R:  And maybe when he starts school then I'll go back.
L:  [COUGH] When do you plan on going back and getting your -- getting you PhD? 
R:  Um, we -- I -- I might think about it.  At this point, I'm not sure since, you know, financially it's a lot of -- 
L:  Yeah, I understand.
R:  A lot of -- 
L:  You and the children.  I know it.
R:  Yep, and I have to think about his future first, so -- [LAUGH]
L:  That's right, that's right. 
R:  But, um, but as far as computers are helpful in the education --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- yep, I would think computers are helpful in the education. Like --
L:  Oh, no doubt.  I mean, the, ah, information that you can find on computers now -- 
R:  Right.
L:  On the -- the world wide web is just tremendous.
R:  Mhm.
L:  There's a lot of good and of course there's a lot of bad.
R:  Yes.  
L:  But I think this force the education -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Computers are here to probably going to get a lot more technical than what -- what they are now -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- in the future.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, it -- it gives the general population more, um, for education, there's more resources on hand which -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- allows them to, um, um, to have more, um, um, how can I say this, more information on finger trips, basically.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So they don't, you know, they -- they can pretty much find anything about anything that -- that anybody might want to know.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, and also it's interactive programmes in schools that can, um, you know, the kids can benefit from for education purposes for, you know, either math and writing and everything.  So -- 
L:  Ah.
R:  -- I -- I really think it's beneficial but like everything, it can get to be too much and they forget.
L:  Ah, yeah. I know the -- I know they stress at -- I know they stress the three Rs, you know, reading, writing and arithmetic.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And now and they had to include computers nowadays.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Kids, ah, just for instance, you know, if you want to -- if you want to try to go file an application in a lot of companies, a lot of companies will send you to a computer to fill out your application -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- if you can't fill out an application on a computer, they don't -- they won't even consider hiring you.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  So it's -- it's gotten that -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, [COUGH] the -- you have to know something about computer nowadays.
R:  Yep, yep.
L:  Too.
R:  I'm like you, I never did the computers until I was in my twenties.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So -- 
L:  Well, are you -- you're not as old as I am though, I don't think.
R:  No, I'm very close. [LAUGH]
L:  You're not, you're not even close, you're probably in your thirties, aren't you? 
R:  Oh, no, I'm in my forties. [LAUGH]
L:  Are you, okay?  Wow. 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I just didn't start having children as early as you did.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, you know, I've got -- I've got a twenty year old, he [inaudible] twenty.
R:  Oh, my gosh. 
L:  And a sixteen, a thirteen and a ten.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So my -- my youngest is, ah, a girl, she's ten.
R:  Oh, very good. 
L:  So, but they all -- they all like computers.
R:  Yes.
L:  They -- they fight over who's going to get on the Internet.
R:  Yes.
L:  And do this and this shit to chat and all that, so -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But it's good for 'em to learn a lot about computers and stuff.
R:  Mhm, yes.
L:  Of course my wife, she home schools.
R:  She home schools?
L:  Home schools.
R:  That's very good, very brave of her.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And does she use computers in her -- her schooling?
L:  Yeah.  My -- my wife, she pretty -- she's pretty much, ah, computer savvy herself.
R:  Mhm.
L:  She's learned a lot, so, um -- 
R:  Good.
L:  Ah, my son, he's doing real well in college.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So far this semester he's got a -- he's got a -- so far he has got a four point oh grade average.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So he's doing real well.
R:  Very good.
L:  So we're proud of him.
R:  Yeah, very good.  And what do you do?
L:  But -- I work at a chemical company, Georgia Gulf Corp-  Corporation.
R:  Ah, uh-huh, very good.
L:  We -- we make, ah, PVC resin plastics and stuff like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So I've worked all over and I've worked the lab.  I've worked in a bunch of different places in the plant.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that's where I work.  You knew -- 
R:  So you don't have any need for computers then? 
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, ah, we run computers at -- at the plant.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I'm just saying I'm not as computer savvy as some people, but --  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but you -- the kind that you -- you learn a certain system and that's how it is.
R:  Right.
L:  But as far as trouble shooting and things going wrong, uh-huh, I'm lost.
R:  Uh-huh, very good.  What -- what is your, um, -- what is your wife's experience?  Ah, what does she say about using the computer?  Does she use computer to home school the kids or -- 
L:  Oh, yes, yes.  She gives them assignments and to -- to, ah, do things on the computer and they look at certain things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they do research and they do little -- little term papers and stuff like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So they -- they -- they -- they do pretty well.
R:  That's good, that's very good.
L:  You've got a little -- you've got a ways for your children to start school, you have got -- you said a three and a half, what -- they start in kindergarten in -- in Washington at five years old? 
R:  Ah, they -- yeah, they start at five, yeah.
L:  At five? 
R:  At five.
L:  Some ways in Mississippi.
R:  He's got -- he's actually almost four so he's going to be not, ah, -- next fall but the fall after, he's going to go so -- 
L:  Ooh, that will be -- [LAUGH] 
R:  -- next year this time, he should be enrolled. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so ... 
L:  Yeah, Seattle.  I imagine Seattle is probably the -- the population of Seattle has probably got same as the whole state of Mississippi.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Seattle has probably got two million or more? 
R:  Ah, yeah, more than that, yes, about that. 
L:  [LAUGH] That's about --
R:  I don't remember exactly how much -- ah, two million maybe, yeah.
L:  Most -- mostly your courses -- I don't know, have you ever been to the south, in the south, southern part of the United States? 
R:  Um, ah, no, not really.
L:  You haven't. Yeah.
R:  I mean, I -- I've been in Louisiana.  I don't know if that's considered the south. 
L:  Louisiana, yes, I got a sister that lives in -- she lives in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh, very good, yes.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's as far as I've gone. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, so, you know, talking -- talking about computers and education for ten minutes.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It seemed like it's kind of hard to do that which my -- [COUGH] I have a certain limited knowledge about that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But anyway, the -- the -- ah, the south, you know, most of the south, Mississippi especially, is kind of -- it's very rural, rural area.
R:  Mhm, uh-huh.
L:  It's, ah, sparsely populating.
R:  Oh, it is sparsely populated.
L:  Yeah, it's not very -- I live in a little town, population of about seven thousand people.
R:  Oh, very good.
L:  It's a little small town.
R:  That's -- that's nice though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You have -- so you have a public library with Internet resources and all that? 
L:  Oh, yeah, yes, yes, yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's -- I live at -- it's an old town.
