R:  Hello, this is Lindsay.
L:  This is whom?
R:  My name is Lindsay.
L:  Hi, Lindsay, I'm Deb.
R:  And you're Deb?
L:  Deb, D.E.B.
R:  D.E.B., nice to meet you.
L:  You too.
R:  So, what, our topic is education, computers in education, eh?
L:  Yes, that's what it sounds like.  [MN] You wanna go first? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I don't have a -- anything prepared to say.  Um, I think it's, um, it's, you know, computers have become prevalent in our society and I think it's important that our kids understand how to use them and, um, I'm sort of amazed by how, um, excellent my son has become very, you know, over the years, and it's been interesting to me.  He's, he's fifteen now, and my daughter's, um, twenty, and a col- um, a sophomore in college --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and just in the four years between them, he's actually almost sixteen, um, um, it's -- it's -- he was introduced to them much earlier on in his education.
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, it's been very -- I think it's been easier for him to be off and running with it.
L:  Oh, I, I think you're right.  I have seven year old twins.
R:  Oh, you do?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, ah, one's a boy and one's a girl.
R:  That's a handful.
L:  And -- yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah, it is.  And I'm amazed also at how, how quickly they've, they've picked it up.  My son much more than my daughter.  
R:  Oh.
L:  And I'm amazed because he, he has basically self taught himself, ah, more than what I even know.  And, you know, I'm, I'm thirty eight and have worked with computers for years.
R:  Right.
L:  But this kid is just a whiz on it.  And, um, they have -- they of course have the computers at school and they have computer science, they're in first grade, and they do have a computer science class now.  And I, I think that's great, you know, because they, they do need that because, you know, we are such a, um, information highway society at, at this point, um, but I think they need to learn the basics before we put them on the computer, you know.
R:  Oh, I think you're absolutely right.  In fact, um, it's interesting you'd say that.  I, I have a friend who's son was asked, um, this was -- this was quite a while back, but when he was in maybe third or fourth grade, he, um, was such a, ah, competent user of the computer, that he never really -- he was sort of resisting learning how to write properly.
L:  Yes.
R:  And his teacher ended up insisting that he not turn in typed papers, that his -- that anything -- his work needed to be handwritten -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so that he could master, um, how to use, you know, the pen and ink.
L:  Yeah.  And, and that's fair.  I, I think that's very fair.  You know, 'cause what I'm seeing now is, you know they, they know how to do everything on the computer, but you, you know, if you ask them to sit down and write two and two, you know, they're not as quick.
R:  Yes.  Yeah.
L:  You know, so --
R:  And I, and I wonder about research skills, um, it's sort of -- it's -- you know, I remember, you know, as a child myself going to the library and wandering around the, the, um, you know, the stacks --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and kind of wandering from book to book and doing, doing a lot of wandering around the pages reading and, and doing my own research, and now it's -- if research is reduced to simply doing Google searches, um, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I wonder if something is lost in the translation.
L:  You know, I, I think you might -- you know, that that's a very good point also.  I do know that, that the school that's around here, and we're northern Virginia, and, um, and it's a fantastic school, the school is only four years old --
R:  Is it a public school?
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I was raised in a private school.  So, you know, I was so scared to put them in a public school.  But, um, this has been just a godsend, because they do have -- they do have library on Mondays, they do have the Dewey decimal system, they do have, um, you know, the card catalogs and that kind of thing, so they are still teaching them that.
R:  Well that's good to hear, because my children are a little bit older and, you know, of course they did have the library experience too, so --
L:  Right.  Well, you know, we go -- we go down to the library at least once a week, myself and my children --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- 'cause I'm a huge reader, and, um, we still -- "Okay, what kind of books do you -- are you looking for today?  Are we looking for insects, are we looking for sports?  Okay, here is -- um, up on the wall is a poster, and it has, you know, zero to ninety nine is this, you know, five ninety nine to -- or five hundred to six hundred is this category".  So, um, we go there and decide what kind of books that we're going to look for, and then go through the stacks that way and figure it out.
R:  Oh, you sound you're pro- like you're providing lots of enrichment to you children. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, you know --
R:  It's so -- just wonderful.
L:  -- you kinda sorta have to because there's not -- all the public schools that are as good as this one.  So you know, I kind of feel like the parents are the back up.
R:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.
L:  And, um, and if -- you know it also helps me, because, you know, I'm not the brightest egg in the basket either.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know [LAUGH] so it's kind of like, you know, this is -- ah, if this is what I can give them I'm gonna give them what I can, because they're certainly outgrowing me in a hurry.
R:  Well, what was your exposure to computers, um, in your own education?
L:  Um, I was not exposed at all until I went back to sc- until I went back to school to get my second degree.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, um, I, I didn't have any kind of, of, ah, computers skills --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- given to me in school.
R:  Well, and it's interesting because you know, for us, for us, I'm a little bit older than you, but, but still, um, the -- it's all been on the job education, computers in education -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and it's just the world is so different than it was only ten years ago.  Just --
L:  Well you have the -- one of the, the things that I think is impending the education system as far as computers go is that you have these, you know, older people like you and I, you know, whose experience wins out over the education.  You, you still have the education, but you've got the experience to back it up.  
R:  Yes.
L:  But yet you have these kids that are coming out of college, you know, or not even graduated from college yet who are getting, you know, um, double the salary that you are because their computer skills are what's needed.
R:  Right, right. 
L:  You know, and, and it's kinda -- well, that's kind of, um, desensitizing, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, feeling marginalized even though we've got all this great experience.
L:  Right.  So, so that -- that I kind of get a little annoyed about. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's funny.
L:  But I think that's just a -- you know that's the technological advances you kind of have to take a little bit when you get a little bit, you know.
R:  Mhm.  Well, I, I've, um, -- was exposed to, um, computer technology fairly early on in my career because I -- we're in northern California in, um, the Bay Area.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, gosh, one of my early jobs was, was working for a company, um, that had a very early version of electronic mail, um, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- this is back in the early eighties, before, you know, before almost anybody had a computer on their desk -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and everybody was pretty much reliant on mainframe.
L:  Right.
R:  So it's been part of my, my, um, computers have been sort of part of what I do for a long time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but nonetheless we didn't have a computer at home for a long time.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  You know, up until -- well, until, I guess early nineties is when we first got a computer.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I, I think that's about what we did also.  But I do have to say that, you know, I'm -- I went back to school again and, ah, for, for something else, and it made my life so much easier to have it because last -- or two semesters ago I took an on line history class --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and everything was on line.  I didn't have to go in to the classroom at all, I can do everything when I had the time to do it, and um, all the research was done on line and it was, it was a remarkably beautifully thing.
R:  Well that's -- that's really exciting for you.  I have -- you know, I have a friend who's very close to retirement age, she's an English professor --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and her husband was recently transferred to Honolulu, she teaches here in the Bay Area --
L:  Right.
R:  -- at a junior college, and she has one more semester of teaching to go before she can take an early retirement, and she's thinking of trying to do her class, um, go ahead and move to Hawaii, and continue to teach her class here [LAUGH] but do the whole thing on line.
L:  Right -- oh, and --
R:  And, and she's -- I think she's going to be able to pull it together.  She's still sort of breaking through red type -- tape at --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the faculty level, um, -- 
L:  Oh, it's wonderful, because the class I took was in San Diego, and I'm in northern Virginia.
R:  Perfect.
L:  And, like I said, I had -- um, you know, as far as computers in education that way, love it.  You know, because I learned so much more than sitting, sitting in a classroom listening to someone drone on about something that I've already read.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  You know, and, and --
R:  Plus the logistics of getting there, um, --
L:  Ex- exactly.
R:  Yeah.  Although, you know, I, I guess I put a high value on the interaction that goes on, you know, the discussions and, um, --
L:  You know, I, ah, I think I just am one of those that tend to learn better on my own -- 
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  -- than, than one who is constant -- you know, consistently preached to.
R:  Yes.
L:  And, um, this --
R:  What was it -- what, um, field of history was it?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  What, what aspect of history was the class?
L:  Oh, it was the, um, American history to reconstruction.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it was absolutely fascinating because we, we got to dig into a lot of stuff that you just don't cover in class, like, you know, the myth of the cowboys in the wild west, you know, and that kind of thing, and we wrote a paper on that, and then we had quest- you know, specific questions that we had to
