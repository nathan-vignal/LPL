R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Hello? 
R:  [MN] Yes, hi, good evening, hi.  Ah, my name is, ah, Norma Jane Browse[?] 
L:  Hi, I'm Roy.
R:  Hi, Roy.  Um, okay, the, ah, oh, topic, ah, that I just found out about is computers in education.
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay, [COUGH] now, ah, my voice is a little husky cause, ah, it's the, ah, change of the season [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Because I know when it's kinda damp my voice gets a little husky.  Okay, now, ah, [COUGH] um, I really think that's a good idea because, ah, I know, ah, when my daughter was in, ah, grade school, um, they insisted, and I think it was in fourth grade that she learn computers and, ah, I really, ah, it helped her considerably when she went to college and had to work on computers for some of her classes.  Um, I, ah, think it's good that the kids are learning today in school.  I think they should have for every kid in school that they have a computer, ah, programs because it helps with their, well, their school work and you can really learn a lot, ah, you know, from, ah, the computers, you get a lot of information out of them.
L:  Yes --
R:  I --
L:  I've grown up with computers all my life.  I'm in college right now.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And computers really simplify life.
R:  Right.  I don't have a computer, ah, but, ah, my daughter does, my brother does.  He's going to, ah, university -- he's going to Temple, he's going to be an engineer and, ah, he had to buy a new computer and he has to learn on the computer because he never used computers before and my daughter and her fiance had to teach him and some other students at Temple --
L:  Oh, okay --  
R:  -- but, ah, he's, ah -- he's doing good with that, it's just taking him a while to, ah, get into computer programs and then, ah, write programs for it.   
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  Oh, but -- 
L:  -- I think in school, like in grade school they should teach children like basic computer skills -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- like word processing and how to make -- use Microsoft Office and Windows and stuff like that.
R:  I know cause as I say my daughter, ah, when she was, ah, -- my daughter daughter's twenty six now.  When he was going to Henry School Elementary at the time, ah, they, ah, I think they were just starting to use computers and, ah, that's when she first, ah, started using em in school and grade school and I know it helped her a lot.  Because my brother, ah, started to go back to, ah, college become an engineer, he had no concept and, ah, she helped him and, ah,  work out programs and stuff and because of her knowledge, ah, it helped my brother and I really -- I think it is because, ah, I think what have I seen on TV they have places now for young kids to go and learn computers and, ah, the benefits they can get from it, ah, with their school work if they wanna look up a project or something, ah, you know, on the, ah, computer, ah, about a subject they like, I think it's great --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- you can look up, ah, all kinds off things on the computer today; health issues, ah, any issues, you know, that come up that, ah, child is interested in.
L:  That's true.  With the internet they have online encyclopedia, dictionaries -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you can search for anything you want and that's what makes the learning process so [MN] nice.
R:  It is, it's really great.
L:  It makes it a lot easier.  You can even go to a li- like the local university library online see if they have a book in -- in stock on the --
R:  Okay  --
L:  -- shelf, you can see if it's checked out.  I think it's great, so -- 
R:  Yeah, I didn't know that -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- that's even better.
L:  Well, I know they do that at my university, I don't know about the local libraries [MN] --
R:  Oh, what university do you go to?
L:  The University of Oklahoma. 
R:  Oh, okay, that's great, okay.
L:  And I think computers are great.  I've been -- like I've been using them more and more and more now.
R:  Ahah.
L:  And each of my classes whenever I turn something in it has to be typed up on the computer.
R:  Okay.
L:  Because, like, when normal students just write stuff out [MN] they make it really sloppy or some -- some of them don't have good handwriting.
R:  I know.  I know my brother, ah, oh, ah, [MN] I think he likes computer better because my brother doesn't rel- he can write but basically used to print [LAUGH] and, ah, you can get, ah, I think it's good because you can get the information off the computer and what I've seen, ah, on TV you can send, ah, oh, ah, oh, my boyfriend, ah, his nephew sometimes call for the computer --  
L:  Yes, I've done that before --  
R:  -- and I've [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- well, that's -- that's, ah, interesting, I've never heard of that before.  That's an interesting concept and then you can send, um, what is it, pictures? 
L:  Pictures and videos -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you can do [several inaudible words] --  
R:  I think that's -- I mean I -- I haven't looked at this stu- -- I mean I [inaudible] computer but the more I notice -- read about and watch it on TV and what they can do, it's just so amazing and they've really it's -- I think it's a good thing, absolutely and I think, ah, I think they should have it in every school in our city.  I mean it I -- I think it's good for all the kids especially [several inaudible words] the kids and -- and, oh, in neighborhoods where they don't have, ah, ah, you know, a good library they can use and I think the li- I live in Philadelphia, there's a little library downtown and where I go to the library [several inaudible words] market and the kids can use the computers but they have to take turns, you had to, you know, sign up.  But I -- I definitely with all schools and schools especially in maybe neighborhoods that aren't too good because maybe the kids, ah -- oh, they can enjoy the computer, they can, ah, get all kinds of information, ah, you know, it become a thing and I think really all schools in our city and all the cities should have, ah, starting I guess third fourth grade, maybe even younger to have computers if the school system can provide for, I think it's a great thing to have.
L:  I've been to a few schools where in kindergarten they have computers --
R:  Wow -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that's even better.
L:  -- they have little programs like the color program --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and the numbers program and like the typing tutor.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I was really surprised at how smart these kids were.
R:  What school was that? 
L:  This was a, ah -- this was a local private school I saw one like that --  
R:  Ah, that seems great.
L:  -- in a local public school they had I think in first grade --  
R:  Ah.
L:  -- they had it -- or they would use the alphabet -- you know, do like literature and English --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- and everything and simple math programs.
R:  Well, I think the younger the better today because I -- I realized  -- I don't have a computer, never learned one but I realize today that more and more, um, um, all kinds of things are done on computers where years ago it used to be handwritten and, ah, they're -- computers are like, ah, the thing of the future, I mean it's like now and, ah, the younger the child today learning computers it's good because this is what a person is gonna need to [several inaudible words], um, and whatever kind of job you use you're still gonna have to have a computer to put in the information whether you're an engineer, a teacher whatever it is.  I mean this is the way the future is today --
L:  It is -- 
R:  -- [MN] you know, this is the -- the coming thing.
L:  Yes, and if you're teaching a child early on it's a lot easier for them to learn.
R:  Oh, I agree, I agree.  I think that's, ah, you know, a good idea.  I mean my daughter had the advantage when she went to grade school, it was a good school and they had computers and, ah, you said now they start in kindergarten, that's even better.
L:  I mean I was really surprised.  My school didn't have computers till around third or fourth grade.
R:  Ahah.
L:  And then we only had -- like we had one or two in maybe every classroom.
R:  Okay.
L:  Now when I go back to the that school, my elementary school, every classroom it's five and then they have computer labs all around the school.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, I mean now they have more money to invest in computer --
R:  Right.
L:  -- now that they see the potential -- 
L:  Mhm.  
R:  -- for it.  Before they just took a chance on it to see what was going to happen.
R:  Right.
L:  And every -- any job you get you're gonna to use a computer somehow.
R:  Oh, I know, I know it's true because, ah, I know my brother, ah, he was telling me that [several inaudible words] engineer, but, um, a lot of the work he's doing in college right now, um, has to come off the computer because he's doing something called like capstone[?] and it's something -- I think he's trying to tell me like if you, ah, -- oh, we're building a pro- -- ah, a building you had to put down estimates and, ah, what equipment would cost and, ah, the -- what you would have to buy and, ah, you know, measures and this and everything now he said, ah, almost all subjects have to be, ah, put in a computer and printed out and then he had has to do, ah, computer programs and, ah, couple of students at Temple has helped him when he couldn't do it himself when my daughter wasn't around, but, ah, he's realized his computer, ah, he never had it in, ah, -- oh, and he went to c- -- he went to Central High School in Philadelphia, I don't think, ah, I don't think they had them then.  They might've but he didn't take it up.  But now I know my daughter was in school, ah, she had -- I think she went to computer class a couple days a week and that was I think in fourth grade.
L:  Yeah, I had a computer class too where we did basic word processing --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then later in high school the classes were more developed where I had to create presentations and things like this, make graphs and everything. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Really that helped me out later on in col-
