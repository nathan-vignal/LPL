L:  Jeff Bose[?].
R:  Hel- hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  I'm Anuja[?] and who's this?
L:  This is Jeff Bose.
R:  Hi.  Um, where are you based right now?
L:  Uh, in Tomah[?], Wisconsin.
R:  Oh, really?  I'm -- I'm talking from State College, Pennsylvania.
L:  Okay.
R:  And nice talking to you. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  Okay.  Um, so do -- do you want to repeat the topic of the day?
L:  Uh, yes.
R:  It is?
L:  Excuse me?
R:  Do you want to repeat the topic of the day?
L:  Uh, computers and education.
R:  Yes, like, how does it improve education or not. 
L:  I think it improves education.
R:  I -- I think so, too.  I -- I mean I don't think without computers there would -- we would be where we are right now.  What do you think?
L:  No, I think, uh, especially the internet has a lot, um, --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- a lot of courses you can take on line.
R:  Definitely.
L:  Uh, and you don't have to go out of states -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to, you know, go to college.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  I guess, so to speak.
R:  Very much.  Very much.  Um, so how much have you -- have you done your education already?  Have you -- 
L:  Uh, I've done two years of, uh, post high school.
R:  Oh, great.
L:  Um, -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and I would like to do some more on line if I can.  I did one course on line.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, I -- I'm definitely for computers and I, er, I do think, I mean it -- it -- it's just not about education and on line degrees and things.  I think it makes a whole lot of other things so much easier.  Your software packages, you know, they help you in your -- in your different subjects.  Like, I was a psychology major -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I used this as BSS, which is the software, uh, program for social sciences, to do my statistics and research and everything and I think if I didn't have that I would take ages to, you know, -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- complete my work, so I definitely think it's a boon to education.
L:  Oh.  I mean how much so, though?  I mean how much education -- 
R:  Well, so much so -- well, so much so that -- are you asking me that? 
L:  Yes. 
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I think so much so that if it weren't for that, I would be, you know, it wouldn't be so much efficient, so much quicker because you're dealing with large pools of data -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and, well --
L:  On the computer, correct?
R:  Well, if -- if there weren't computers -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then you're dealing with large amounts of data and human error is bound to happen and, you know, it saves time, it's more accurate and I get my statistics and my results calculated in, like, you know, -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in a matter of minutes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And because I'm all the time dealing with research data, like sampling and I've -- I've dealt with sample sizes as huge as five hundred.  Uh, you don't want to be sitting and calculating the means and averages, you know.
L:  Yes.  Oh, yes.
R:  So -- oh, yes, so I -- I definitely think at least in my education it's helped me a lot.
L:  Yeah.  It -- it's helped me in mine quite a bit, too.
R:  Oh.  Yeah.  What's your major? [SIGH] 
L:  Uh, well, actually I have a minor in fire science.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and I took part of that on line.
R:  Oh, okay.  That's cool. [MN] I haven't done any on line, um, education or any correspondences, cour- courses or anything on line, but I do think -- I think people do actually -- I don't know how much of a success is that, though, just on line courses.
L:  Um, well, I did one class.  Uh, it -- it helped me.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, um -- 
R:  And, I mean, do you -- is everything clearer and if you need anything is it all there?
L:  Uh, yes, it is. [MN] The course that I took actually had a video -- 
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  -- of the professor -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, talking and it was about a half a second behind, you know -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, uh, he was giving his, you know, instructions and everything and assignments right over line, I could just do it right on line.
R:  And was it interactive, like, could you ask him questions?
L:  Oh, yeah, I -- I could.
R:  No, really, so is -- was it more like a video phone call? 
L:  I -- I had the video but he didn't know who -- who I was.
R:  Right.  Okay.  All right.  Well, that must be fun, though.
L:  Ah, it was definitely interesting.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  And I don't know, I'm -- I'm -- I'm an internet bug as far as shopping is concerned.  I do a lot of my shopping --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- as well on -- on the internet, all my books and everything, Amazon dot com.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I mean -- and you get better and cheaper deals, so why not? 
L:  Oh, yeah.  Airline tickets as well.
R:  Oh, yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, everything.
R:  [MN] I mean you can just compare rates, you can just compare things, you can -- you can check, you know, things in stores and just sitting at home, you know.  You don't even have to travel all that much, so -- 
L:  Oh, one thing I do like is, uh, like, the public records searches -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- on individuals.
R:  Oh, yes.  Yes.
L:  Um, I -- I think that helps out quite a bit.
R:  Oh, yes, because, um, you just -- you just have a vague idea of such and such person and you want to know where exactly in the United States [MN] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then you just do a people search.  Wow, that's -- that's -- that's wonderful, really.
L:  Yeah.  Y- you know, there's ways you can look up, uh, phone numbers on line and to tell you -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, who -- who it is, when they last used this.
R:  Absolutely, absolutely and I think most of your email correspondences with your professors and your fellow students and everything -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think it just happens, you know, on the internet because y- -- it's not feasible to actually practically meet everybody all the time to do your, you know, -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to get together and do work, so most of it happens I think on line, everything is just, you know, you divide your work on line and then you just -- just send your files and that's it.  I mean, what do you think about that?
L:  Yeah.  I, you know, I -- I think so.
R:  Well, how many -- how many calls have you done in this special study? [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, one.
R:  Really?
L:  The first one.  This is my first one.
R:  Oh, really? [LAUGH] How's it going?
L:  Uh, decent.
R:  [LAUGH] Where did you hear about this?
L:  Uh, actually, um, my mother, uh, through the computer.
R:  Oh, really?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Again, see? [LAUGH]
L:  She -- she lives -- she lives out of state -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so --  
R:  Oh.
L:  She had, um, hooked me up through it and I f- filled out all the information.
R:  Okay.  Okay, because, see, again I -- I -- I learnt about this study from -- from the internet, too, you know.
L:  Okay.
R:  And then -- see, that's a great thing.  Otherwise the world becomes so small with computers and the internet, what do you think?
L:  Um, yeah.  I -- I think it probably would.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Uh, the communication wouldn't be as well.
R:  Exactly.  I mean, it's just wonderful, see?  Where are you and where am I and both of us know about the same study just through the computers and internet.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  So, I mean I -- I -- I personally cannot imagine what our lives would be without computers.  I don't -- 
L:  Uh, yeah, I -- I couldn't either, like, -- 
R:  [MN] Yeah, but even if it's games or it's just to pass your time, free time -- 
L:  Well, I -- 
R:  -- there's just -- there's just ample -- ample entertainment. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes, so ... 
L:  I can remember as a child, as a little child, my mother always having a computer and it was huge, you know, -- 
R:  I know.
L:  -- and it wasn't nearly, you know, twenty years ago, wasn't nearly -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as what it is today.
R:  Right, but still you needed it then, too.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.  So, you can imagine now how -- how much more hooked and how much more dependent we are now.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Yes, so, it just goes like that and, I mean, I've ordered -- uh, we had our world cup cricket matches going on so I ordered them all on the internet and I was sitting home and watching them -- 
L:  Really?
R:  -- you know, instead of paying for the satellite and instead of paying for the, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, and that was -- it -- it was a whole lot cheaper.  So, I guess it's -- it's such an integral part.  Well, they want us to link computers only to education, but I think, I don't know, it's just so important in every aspect. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I mean ev- -- when you go on the computer anyways, um, [MN] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- aren't you pretty much just educating yourself -- 
R:  I think so, too.  Absolutely.
L:  -- no matter what you do on it.
R:  Absolutely, because there's everything new that you -- I mean, every time you -- you log in there's -- there's something new that you learn every time, you know -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about some place somewhere, about some company somewhere, or just anything.  My -- my husband's doing his job search these days and it's all -- it's all on Monster Trak[?] and, you know -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he hasn't been [inaudible] anybody, he hasn't gone personally and submitted his resume anywhere -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I think it's -- it's just a great thing to have happened to us and we are just lucky. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, I totally agree with that.
R:  Yeah. [MN] We're luckier than our parents were because they had to [inaudible].  They didn't have so much, uh, you know, advantage -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so much of this thing, so -- and, um, I definitely think -- but I also think, though, that, uh, not only does it kind of make -- make life easier for us.  At times it also has a potential to, you know, kind of, mm, lead us astray -- 
L:  Ah, -- 
R:  -- because of, [MN] you know, like sites, pornography and stuff like that.
L:  Ye- yeah.  Um, well, I think that, you know, wherever you go, um, [MN] you know, especially pornography on the internet --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- wha- what I do think, though, uh, I think they should have, um, stricter regulations on something like that.
R:  I'm sure parents do exercise that when they have small kids at home.
L:  Um, because I know it's -- it's pretty easy to get on those sites, too.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know that.  I mean, you can just -- you can pay a measly amount and just subscribe to, you know, regular stuff and all that.  Well, as far as that is concerned, I guess, [MN] it's a little, you know, dicey as to whether, you know, everybody should have access and how -- how -- how properly should they use it, but other than that I think I've only seen good in computers and internet.  I mean, other than that I don't think it -- it -- it affects us, you know, in a bad way or anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, [MN] people -- I think people have the choice to either do it or not do it.
L:  Yeah.  Uh, you know, I think they -- I don't know, uh, you know, that's the iffy question.
R:  Yeah.  I mean we shouldn't blame it on internet or the computer so much but people should exercise their own kind of choice, you know, whether they want to get into that kind of stuff or not, so -- 
L:  Yeah, I mean knowing right from wrong.
R:  Yeah. [MN] So it's -- it's -- [MN] all in all I would -- I would definitely support the computer and [inaudible] favorable, um, you know, -- 
L:  Yeah, I definitely would, too.
R:  Yeah, because it -- it -- I don't know if today you tell me even to spend probably twenty four hours I would feel, wow, in spite of the television, in spite of the newspapers, I'm still kind of, you know, I'm missing something, I'm -- you know? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's -- it's so normal for you to just -- just log in and check stuff on line and -- 
L:  New- newspapers from around the world, um, -- 
R:  Yeah, exactly, like my home country.
