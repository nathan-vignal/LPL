R:  Hi, I'm Shera.
L:  Hi, I'm Patty. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  Hi there. [LAUGH] So, um, the topic is computers in education?
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, I guess I think, um, they're very important, um, since that's pretty much the way of the world these days.  Um, yeah, I have a little boy who's three and he's already pretty good at, at handling the mouse. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  So, um, what do you think?
R:  Um, I think that they can be very useful and, and they're a really good tool, um, to learn how to use in terms of being able to access information.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, determine, like, which information is, like, useful and what is, you know, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just junk that's out there.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, and in terms of communicating people from different parts of the world who have different backgrounds, that's an incredibly useful thing in education, to, um, be in touch with people who are from different places, in terms of geography and in terms of class and race and all those --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- things.
L:  I agree.  That's where I used to go to a book, [LAUGH] an encyclopedia and look things up, it's right on the internet.  I mean, you can look up anything you need.  Um, --
R:  And everything gets updated so quickly.
L:  Yes, yes.  That's true.  Yep.  Um, I have a stepdaughter who actually was here and she had to plan a trip over in Europe, and she was telling us exactly how many miles and -- it just varies, like you said, it's a useful tool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, I don't know where she would of got the information, you know, she would of had to go to the library to get all that. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  And maps and, you know -- whereas it was right there, you type in your destination and, um, where you want to go, how you want to get there, and up it pops.  She had the mileage, how much the air fare would be, everything was right there.  Yep.
R:  It's incredible.
L:  Yep, it sure is. [LAUGH] I wish it did -- it would of been more popular when I was younger. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But then there's also, um, the aspect of it that's, um, that I think is pretty useful to spend a lot of time, um, talking to other people, like face to face and interacting with people and not machines -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so like, finding the balance between.
L:  That's a good point.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a real good point, is people maybe are going to [LAUGH] forget how to communicate, you know, as -- in person.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, if they're doing everything over the internet and over the computer.  That, that's a good point too.  I never thought of that.  Hm.  And also, something that might worry me also is maybe that maybe it's almost too easy, you know, you can look at that aspect too.  I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well then, um, I mean, I, I went to school pretty recently, and I don't know very much about the way that, like, the library system works --
L:  That's --
R:  -- how to, like, look up different books on different topics.
L:  See, that, that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what I was talking about, is you probably never even learned it, did you?
R:  No.
L:  Because --
R:  We didn't learn it.
L:  Yeah.  It, it's not necessary, it's pretty much outdated. 
R:  Right.
L:  But then again a person should know, you know, yeah, I learned something called the Dewey decimal system --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and how, how they're -- [LAUGH] the numbering and all that, and that was years ago.  And, yeah.  They probably don't even teach that anymore.
R:  No, they don't.  I just heard of it 'cause my mom.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, yeah, I have a friend who's a librarian and, um, --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- she talks a lot about how, um, people don't use, like, libraries nearly as much as they used to because --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- everything is right in the computer.  You don't have to interact with people, you don't have to leave your house if you have it -- the internet in your house.
L:  Right.
R:  And, and you can just get away with being so lazy and not ever talking to people --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- and not having to, like, really use any skills.  Just like, you know, bringing up a search engine.
L:  Yep.  That, that's true.  That's very true.  Hm.  It's interesting to think about.  And, and if, if we're using it so much now, what's it gonna be like, you know, I always think twenty years.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, how advanced -- I mean, gosh, everything will be automated and, you know, you'll be able to -- I mean, you already can pay your bills on line, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, banking.  You can do your banking. [LAUGH] You're never going to have to go to any of these institutions anymore.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  That, that's true.  Um, even, even music, um, you can listen to songs, you can listen -- before you buy a CD you can go to the web site, or the, the CD and listen to it, you know, you can get a sample right over the internet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, yeah.  It allows, allows consumers to listen and make decisions before they even buy anything.
R:  Yeah, it's -- yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] So ... beneficial, and yet, you know, there's probably drawbacks too. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So.  Um, I'm trying to think of something else. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, well I know that children are learning about computers earlier and earlier.  I mean, I think they have them in their kindergarten classes now --
R:  Yeah -- wow.
L:  -- I'm not sure, but I know there -- it's -- when I --
R:  I have -- I have a memory of third grade.
L:  Really? 
R:  We had a computer class, and I remember my teacher was Mrs Allen, and um, and we had to make the -- a turtle go around -- it was called Logo, where we had to make a turtle go around the screen and make a box.
L:  Oh, funny.
R:  And then we had to fill it in.  And so we had to learn the commands for that.
L:  Oh, my gosh. [LAUGH]
R:  And, you know, we learned how to touch type, but -- and, and that's really useful to me, to know how to do that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, I've never used Logo -- I guess they didn't know that everything was gonna, like, um, that like it wouldn't be useful to teach people computer programming that way, because --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, everything gets, like, changed and updated all the time.
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, you know, like I've never needed to make a turtle go around anything.
L:  [LAUGH] You've never used that since, huh?
R:  Right.
L:  Well, can I ask you, did you ever take a typing class, or key- would they have called it keyboarding?  You know, did you learn to type? 
R:  We, we learned to type in, like, in third grade, and then my mom got a --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- um, program to teach me and my sister --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- how to type at home.
L:  Okay.  So you were learning that early.  I mean, that's early to me, 'cause I didn't --
R:  Yeah, that's very early. [LAUGH]
L:  -- learn that 'til high school, and I learned on a typewriter.  So that's how things have changed.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  I mean, um, we had these electric typewriters that were really heavy and clunky and -- so, [LAUGH] I don't think anybody even uses those anymore.  I know that now it's keyboarding and it's computer classes, and -- gosh, third grade.  So you're probably really good at [LAUGH] typing, by the time you were in sixth grade or something, you know.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That -- that's changed.
R:  I remember, um, in -- starting in high school, um, all of the papers that we were submitting for any class, they all had to be computer ty- like, computer printed.
L:  Really?
R:  Which was really, like, problematic 'cause a few kids didn't have computers 'cause their families didn't have money.
L:  Right.  So what --
R:  They had to, like, spend all of their afternoons at school working on the papers.
L:  Ah.  See that's -- yeah.
R:  And, um, -- it was really -- it was really problematic.  That's another problem, is that, um, it's really good when there's like, these tools that people can use and they can't afford to have them in their own homes.
L:  Right.
R:  But it's a problem when they aren't, like, publicly available but they're required for students, because then --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like, people are in the situation where they're, like, --
L:  They're in --
R:  -- they have no choice but to, like, to have more money than they have --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they just don't.
L:  That, that's true, and, and -- that's true.  Not everybody is so lucky to be -- have one at home, and you know, right -- if they're going to a library or something, or school, of course they only have certain hours where they can [LAUGH] use it.  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, yeah.  That's true too.  Um, I, I wonder too, I don't know what the ratio would be of children who have their own computers in their rooms, or how --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- you know.  That could cause a problem too, as far as not -- not the education part, but games and that kind of thing. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I mean, when you're, when you're working on a typewriter, you're either, like, typing or you're not typing.  But on --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a computer you can be typing and, like, -- my mother, she was in rabbinical school, and she was studying to be a rabbi, and she would, you know, be studying for her tests and writing papers, and she spent all of her evenings playing computer games because she, like, -- you know, like it's so easy to procrastinate --
L:  Yes, that's true.
R:  -- and so easy to distract yourself.
L:  'Cause it's right at your fingertips.
R:  Yeah, it's just, like, this fun toy.
L:  Right.
R:  That's also, like, homework, or whatever it is.
L:  Right, right.  That, that's a good point too.  Um, you know how many games of Solitaire do you get with your programming?  You know, a lot. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah that's a good point.
R:  And the internet is, like, such a distraction for me.
L:  [LAUGH] I've found out the Ebay --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- kind of a distraction.  You can buy anything you want.  You know, you can -- it is amazing.  You can just spend hours and hours on end. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  For sure.
R:  And again, you can spend hours and hours on end and never see a person.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah, that, that's true.  Isolate you a little bit, and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.  I know when we first got a computer my -- well then boyfriend, he spent hours and hours, and, and yet he taught himself how to use the computer.  So, you know, he never took a computer class or anything as far as education --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and he knows way more than I do.  I mean, I've taken classes and -- but he knows as far as, you know, how to load this or do that, or, you know,
