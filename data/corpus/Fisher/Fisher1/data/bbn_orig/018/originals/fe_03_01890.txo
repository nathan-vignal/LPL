R:  -- but we get some good days and then we get some bad days.
L:  Yeah -- you know, actually, probably, you're about the same as we are, right?  I mean, you know, give or take, I don't think there's that much difference.
R:  No --
L:  Um, but I think it's supposed to start warming up a little bit now by the weekend.
R:  Oh, that'd be nice.
L:  Yeah, I know, you know it seems -- we had really nice weather a couple of days, it was like seventy, seventy five, and then --
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  -- and then it dropped to fifty, so, I mean, it was, like, a really in between, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, but what can you do?
R:  -- be- -- and then, then, circus is here --
L:  Oh, --
R:  -- and I get to -- get to take the grandchildren to the circus --

L:  Oh, that's exciting!
R:  Yes, yes --
L:  Oh, good.  Is that their first?
R:  No --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- actually, we have -- one, two, three I think about five grandsons.
L:  Oh, nice, well, maybe you'll get a granddaughter, now, huh?
R:  It would be very nice --
L:  [LAUGH] not that she would be spoiled or anything like that. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you see, um, his wife, now she has, um, four sisters, I believe --
