L:  Hello?
R:  Hello. 
L:  Yeah, hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Kia, how are you? 
L:  I'm doing great Kia, how you doing? 
R:  I'm okay.
L:  This is Craig.
R:  Good.  Um, so what do you think about computers and education?
L:  [LAUGH]  You couldn't have picked, like, a worse topic for me to talk about. [LAUGH]  I just don't -- I -- wh- what do I think about it?  Um, it all -- it's -- I -- I don't know if I have ten minutes to sell on it [LAUGH] but, um, it -- 
R:  I'm a teacher, so, you know.
L:  Oh, okay, well then you can ask me questions. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I think it's -- it's a matter of how you use them whether they help or -- or hur- -- or hinder education.  Um, it -- I mean, I think computers can be ver- -- could be a very good educational tool but I also think, you know, you can use it for a lot of stuff that, um, [LAUGH] you know, inhibits learning.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, well, you know, I teach kindergarten, so ... 
L:  Oh, do you?  Okay.
R:  Really I have to say they can't get into really anything that harms them, but I don't have to take -- I teach in a public school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I don't have the technol- -- like, my computer is, the kindergartens get the oldest computers and the rest of the grades get the new --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ones with all the gadgets.
L:  I guess they figure the five year olds aren't going to really, you know get- --
R:  But they have learning stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I would buy stuff for my classroom.  I couldn't -- only fit one game, like, Jump Start, which is really --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in education it is used a lot.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  I can use that.  I cannot use not a thing else.
L:  Really?
R:  Or my -- its -- there is not enough room.  And I had --
L:  Oh.  Where do you teach at?
R:  I teach in Philadelphia public school.
L:  Oh, really, okay.
R:  And [LIPSMACK] it is just, you know, I -- I -- not all public schools are like this but I don't like the fact that I don't have it.  They need to get -- I have kids that are on the lower end --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- academically and I would love to sit them in front of the computer and help them learn math or, you know, something like -- else like that.
L:  Mhm. Mhm.
R:  Because at that tender age, um, it will get them -- I knock myself out trying to teach them, even though I have thirty. 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  If it helps them learn it then I'm, like, ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, well, I think it's -- I -- I -- my opinion is it is all a matter how you use it. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I mean, I'm not really too computer literate myself.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  But, I mean, I just -- just thinking about that, I -- I -- you know, I live in Camden County over in Jersey.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, you know, I just hear about, um, you know, I read something where Cherryhill schools are equipping fourth graders with laptops now and I just thought that's, like, really unfair that these districts with, you know, lots of money.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like Cherryhill.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, [LAUGH] they are getting laptops for fourth graders.  [LAUGH] 
R:  We need some.
L:  When you probably have, like, ten year old computers there for a kindergarten.
R:  Oh, my computer is more than ten years old.
L:  More than ten years old, you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  More than ten -- yeah, it's, like, what about the --
L:  You've got, like, a Vic twenty or something. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  It is, like, I know that computer I know was probably made in the early nineties and it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yeah, it's not fair.  It is, like, well what about these children and some of them start off behind the eight ball.  See the mo- -- the communities where it's affluent --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then they give them stuff like that, but the communities -- they hav- --
L:  Sure.
R:  You know, they say they give extra mon- -- I haven't seen it yet.
L:  No.
R:  But for the ones that don't -- that start off behind the eight ball, you know, not having all the advantages of money.
L:  Of course not, no.
R:  Then they're not really getting it because some of my kids don't have a lot of money.
L:  Yeah.  Well, you know what, I mean, you become better equipped, you know, for, you know, a career if yo- -- you get started earlier with --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, the highest technology and, you know, you're better equipped whereas if you are in, you know, more of a low income district, you know, you're not as equipped and, you know, -- how -- how do you expect your ever to catch up, you know. 
R:  Yeah, really because I --
L:  You know, if you're never -- you know, if you're never going to provide the funds for them to be --
R:  Yeah, to be where the other kids are.
L:  -- equal.  Yeah, exactly, exactly.  I just knew from when I went to col- -- I mean, I went to high school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in an area that wasn't -- it's not -- it wasn't as urban as Philadelphia.  I mean, it was like a small urban town.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know if you are familiar with New Jersey at all?
R:  Oh, real- -- yeah.  Think so.
L:  Burlington City is the name of the -- is the name of the --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] County.  Um, up by Willingboro, Mowharely[?], those areas.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and I just remember when I got into college just, you know, the people who went to those schools were just so much better equipped for college.  It took me actually two years to actually catch on to, like, how to do, like how to study, [LAUGH] how to write papers.
R:  With the k- -- yeah.
L:  I never learned that stuff in high school.
R:  Yeah.  You know what, they gave up typing by the time I wen- -- graduated in the early nineties.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they gave up typing and it was, like, I really didn't have computers in high school but it was when it was sort of becoming popular.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I had a word processor I had done at home to write papers and, um, you know, like the Smith Corona, it wasn't a typewriter but the word processor?
L:  The thing -- yeah, yeah, I remember them, yeah.
R:  I learned how to use it and it was, like, I -- I learned as it was sort of coming in is when I learned.
L:  Mhm.
R:  How to use it in college, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- now I'm in graduate school and now it's a must.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
R:  Like, you know, I got a computer because it's a must.  I have to be online, some of the classes are online.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, it is, like, -- well, I mean, --
L:  Well, that's it -- I mean, --
R:  What's --
L:  It's the same thing about being online.  I think online can be educational, you know, depending on what you choose to look at. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah, because I -- believe me I get --
L:  [LAUGH] Unfortunately there's also a lot of pornography on line, so ... [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, I even get solicitations, like, --
L:  So do I. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- emails, and it's like --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And some of them are just disgusting.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I wouldn't want my kids -- like, the kids at school they have a email account and then get, like, some -- I mean, just, just some of this is wrong, like, ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, especially sending it to, like, people that are, you know, real young and don't even understand it, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I just remember one time I got an email and one of the things that were said in it, "If you receive this by error and you don't want to receive these any more", and I'm just, like, well [MN] -- and this was like something that was really just -- it was regular -- worse than just regular pornography, I'm not even going to say what it was.
R:  It's like, "Oh, God!" 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] And --
R:  I wouldn't want my students to get that.
L:  And I'm just, like, -- it was, like, if you -- if you -- like, what makes -- like, they said that in the letter and I'm, like, "What makes you think I don't want to receive this any more?  [LAUGH] Of course I don't want to receive this". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I don't know where they get their list from -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- because I'm not even -- I go online for my graduate school class because what it does is my, um, -- it's a speciality, where I go, and what it does is it allows people -- like, I have one class online.  Some of them are on campus.
L:  Mhm.
R:  At Pennsylvania College of Optometry.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  But some of them aren't -- 
L:  Oh, is that what you are going to school for?
R:  I'm learning how to teach visually impaired children.
L:  Oh, great. 
R:  So what it does is we have people in our class, because you had to go online, discussion boards, from, like, New Mexico.  We had them from all over.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, we had people, so it was, like, okay, well, at least I'm getting to know people.  I mean, like, people from all over can benefit --
L:  Yeah, sure.
R:  -- because they don't have the program everywhere.  So that meant that it's sort of, like, closing the gap and helping people because they really need teachers -- 
L:  Sure.
R:  -- of the visually impaired.
L:  Sure.
R:  So it is sort of, like, ...
L:  How does an online class work?  I mean, does the professor actually con- -- like, conduct it?  I mean, I've never --
R:  Yes.  I had a discussion board, you got to choose your group that you were in.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And one group had to make products, like, brochures.
L:  Okay.
R:  You know, about services.
L:  Yeah.
R:  One group had to do different activities and then one had to get online and talk about stuff.
L:  Okay.
R:  I chose the wrong group because I chose the one that, um, you had to do activities.  I thought, "Oh, this won't be hard".  Lord have mercy.
L:  [LAUGH] But -- 
R:  I had to do this that and another thing and, you know, and you could talk to people -- it was really cool 'cause you could talk to people from all over. But --
L:  Yeah.  That part of it -- yeah, to me it seems, like, I don't know -- I -- I -- I would have to actually go on it and see what it's like.  To me it doesn't seem like I'd rather -- I'd rather be in a classroom, [LAUGH] you know, than -- 
R:  You know what, I thought I would but the thing is this class they don't offer it on campus.
L:  Well, sure, sure, you can't do that.
R:  So I had no choice.  It was, like, okay, I'm getting my masters, this is my program.  If it is not offered on campus then, you know, it's, like, okay. 
L:  You have no choice, yeah, sure, I understand.
R:  Quit -- you know, it's, like, don't cry, you know, it's not offered on campus.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just do it by computer even though I'm like -- I'm somewhere, like, fifteen minutes away from there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, you know, I still, you know, just like everybody else, but we have people who even drive.  Like the people who drive for classes sometimes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Come from Delaware.  I mean, I'm talking three hours away.  New York.
L:  Oh, yeah, you're not talking Wilmington, [LAUGH] you're talking, like, Scatter Rover's Beach[?] or something. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Um, New York City.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Somebody came from New York City, drove down once a week for a class.
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  You know, three and four hour trips but when they have an online course it benefits them because they don't have to make that trek down here.
L:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Exactly.
R:  And they can do it --
L:  There are advantages of it.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Sure.
R:  For them.  But the teenagers, I don't know, because my brother's a young teen- -- well, he's about to graduate and go to college.
L:  Okay.
R:  And it was, like, well, would he do -- I know some of the stuff they can get into and if they were at school --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I think they need to be monitored.
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]  I -- I -- I agree, or there needs to be blocks on some, like, -- I know, like, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know you can put blocks on --
R:  Blo- --
L:  -- the type of website you can go to.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, that definitely needs to be done. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's what it needs to be.  Because teenagers, even if they are just, you know, insecure.  Teenager, you know you were adolescent, you have hormones, you are [inaudible].
L:  You are just going to mess around, yeah.   
R:  So messing around and -- 
L:  You are just going to goof off, you know.  Like I do when I'm thirty two I goof off, you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, you're going to do it if somebody is not supervising you, of course.
R:  Mhm.  Go --
L:  I was much worse when I was seventeen, yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah, well, I know -- I remember that was -- I'm twelve years older than him.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So it was, like, I remember when I was seventeen though and even girls are different than boys but still it is like a curiosity and then --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- they can get on -- if they're supposed to be online maybe researching something, what if they slip into a site? 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  He's never, um, he -- at my parent's house it is more of a he's on the computer, he might be researching something, or he's allowed to talk to his friends but he's never aware.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He thinks that he's alone, like, nobody -- somebody will walk in the room, we don't care, like, you know, it's not his bedroom.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's an office.
L:  Yeah.
