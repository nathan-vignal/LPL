L:  Hello. 
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello. [LAUGH] How are you doing?
R:  I'm fine, thank you, and yourself?
L:  Fine.  My name is Richard and I'm from Mississippi.
R:  My name's Glen, I'm from Tampa, Florida.
L:  Tampa, Florida, well.  We're both from the south, but you're [LAUGH] you're from a l- --
R:  I didn't think that, you know -- you got an interesting topic, but I didn't think they had, ah, computers in Mississippi yet.
L:  You didn't know that?
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH] Well what'd you think Mississippi had then?
R:  Well, last time I was in -- well, actually -- no, that was -- yeah, that was Mississippi.  I was, ah, in a store and they guy, ah, walks up to the counter --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and asks the cu- asks the cashier, she says, "I'll have an RC and a moon pie" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and the guy says, "You must be from Mississippi".  He says, "I am, how do you know?"  He said, "'Cause this is a hardware store, buddy".
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, we have a few computers.  Ah, at least we got three at my own home anyway.
R:  [LAUGH] Anyway.
L:  So, um, -- so, you know, some of us in Mississippi know a little bit about computers.
R:  [LAUGH] I've got a couple --
L:  But not all.
R:  -- I got a couple --
L:  Huh?
R:  -- of good friends that work at, ah, work in the steel mill business, and they're in, ah, --
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, up in Mississippi Alabama area.
L:  Oh yeah, yeah.
R:  Alabama's good steel country.
L:  Yeah, I know there's steel mills in Birmingham -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Alabama.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And Mississippi, I'm trying to think where, I don't know, maybe in south Mississippi, maybe.
R:  You got kids?
L:  Ah, I got four.
R:  I got three.
L:  Have you?  I have --
R:  Yeah.  Twelve, ten and five.
L:  Oh, I've got one twenty, sixteen, thirteen and ten.  I got one a freshman in -- at Mississippi State University --
R:  Oh, -- 
L:  -- and he's --
R:  -- congratulations.  That's cool.
L:  Well, he is -- as a matter of fact, he is -- his degree, he is going for a computer science degree.
R:  Ah.
L:  So he, he's -- that's what he's going for.  Right now he's doing --
R:  Yeah, well I go to USF part time, and --
L:  They --
R:  -- they've talked to me -- I'm with the College of Engineering, they've talked to me about going into, ah, --
L:  Really?
R:  -- into a computer sciences, but --
L:  That's the University of Southern Florida?
R:  South Florida.
L:  South Florida --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I live five minutes from the campus.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, ah, -- yeah, it's --
L:  That's where they --
R:  -- it's amazing.  I actually hadn't -- hadn't really had any experience with computers until about, I don't know, about ten years ago.
L:  Well, you know, I'm -- well, I'm probably older than you then, I'm forty nine years old.
R:  Ten years.
L:  Of course, when I went to school there was no computers.  And you know, ah, --
R:  When I was a kid -- and I'm comparing to when I was a little kid and my five year old daughter, I didn't know from a computer.  And my --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- little girl comes wandering in the house and she starts the computer up, throws a disk in it, and she's playing these interactive, ah, -- playing with these living books things.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  And they're amazing.
L:  Yeah, I know with my kids, they know a -- they know a lot more about a computer than I do.  Course I have, ah, I've tried to pick up tidbits here and there, and I can surf the internet, but [MN] if you have a lot of -- any kind of problems or -- I can't fix the computer, if it crashes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm like, "Yeah, I have to call my son".
R:  I ask my twelve year old.  He knows more. [LAUGH]
L:  That's what I do, I have to call my children to come and help.  If it freezes up or something like that, what do I do?
R:  Well, kicking it like you're hitting a television set doesn't work anymore.
L:  Look, one thing about computers though, they're here to stay and, and even they're making our jobs even, even much easier and, and better.
R:  What I found with them that makes them so useful to me is how fast you can move information around.
L:  Right.  No doubt about it.
R:  Unbelievably fast.  I can, I can type up a document, email it to a guy, he'll have it immed- he'll literally have it immediately.  He can print it, and if he needs -- if I need a signed copy back, I can have it back the following morning.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Or you -- they've even got ways to electronically sign them and I can have it back immediately.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just -- it's, it's amazing the amount of time that they save.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But what impresses me most is how, ah, you take little kids as young as -- as, as soon as they can -- they've even got the -- these little mouses for little kids to use.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because their hands aren't so coordinated and they start -- they can start using them as little -- as young as like two years old.
L:  Well, see all these kids now, they growed up with the Nintendo world and all these -- so they play games and they're -- and that's good for their, um, ah, coordination.
R:  Hand eye coordination.
L:  Hand eye coordination.  You got it.
R:  Yeah, one of the funniest things thing --
L:  People want --
R:  -- I saw, my -- we were cleaning out my garage, and my wife had her -- a, a collection of, ah, of ah, of vinyl records, thirty three and a thirds from when she was a little kid.  And --
L:  Good gracious.
R:  -- my son says, "That's the biggest CD I've ever seen in my life". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] He ain't -- yeah, he didn't grow up with the vinyl world like we did.  The forty fives, and the, yeah, things like that.
R:  God forbid he ever saw an eight track tape.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, we grew up in the eight track tape era.  I did.
R:  Mhm.
L:  For sure.  Well, ah, you said you did -- what is your profession?  What do you do?
R:  I'm in industrial manufacturing.
L:  Industrial manufacturing.
R:  And -- but when -- I'm actually working right now on a, a, an engineering degree.
L:  Oh.  That's good.
R:  Yeah.  I've got --
L:  Well --
R:  -- decided to go back to sc- go to school.  At the age of thirty six, I said, "It's time to go to school and get a degree".
L:  Well, you know, that's -- I commend you.
R:  It's --
L:  That's a -- that's pretty good, you know.  You --
R:  It's the hardest thing I've ever done.
L:  -- it takes a -- it takes a lot of commitment, yeah.
R:  It's --
L:  Especially being married and having children and everything, that's tough.
R:  Oh, I throw a wrench in it.  My wife's in the PhD program at the same time too.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So, yeah [LAUGH] so --
L:  Oh, well that's good.
R:  Well it --
L:  She need -- she need to get that doctorate degree, that'll help her.  That'll --
R:  Well, I look at it this way: when she gets done, she can go to work. [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.  And [LAUGH] support you for a while, ain't you.
R:  But, ah, it --
L:  Well, I work at a -- I work at a chemical company.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, Georgia Gulf Corporation.  It's a -- we make, ah, PVC plastics and stuff like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And plastics, you know, like if they make computer hous- ah, hardware and stuff like that.
R:  Right.
L:  That's what we make at, at the plant.  I've worked all over in the lab and stuff like that.
R:  That's cool stuff.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Amazing --
L:  Yeah, it's a --
R:  -- what you can do with plastics now.
L:  -- pretty good job.  For round here in Mississippi.  You know, we live in -- of course you know some [inaudible]
R:  Florida is no better.  The job market in Florida is horrid.
L:  Is it?
R:  It's just, it's --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- the companies down here do not pay for talent.
L:  They don't.
R:  No.  I can make -- if I was to -- if I were to go up in the north east with my background, I could command a job that pays two fifty to three hundred thousand a year.
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  Down here I'm lucky to find seventy.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  They just don't want to pay down here.
L:  [MN] Mm.  Well you sure wouldn't get anything --
R:  And the cost of living isn't that much different.
L:  No, no.  I agree with that.  Yeah.
R:  And if it wasn't for my wife being in a PhD program, I'd be packing up and going already.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, you might as well consider it, if you can make that kind of money -- 
R:  You can't -- well --
L:  -- with you, with you --
R:  -- I'm tied to -- right now we're tied to the area because of school, and I'm not about --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to have a long distance marriage.  That doesn't work.
L:  Yeah.  No, I agree with you there.  That's true.  That's true.
R:  I've done enough working out of town to know that I'm not interested. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, you know, you know, seventy thousand, it's a -- you can make a living -- 
R:  Ah, you live.
L:  -- at seventy.
R:  You eat well.  And three years down the road she'll be done.  It's not that far away.
L:  No, that's true.  Tampa, Florida.  That's, ah, home of the, ah, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, world champions, aren't they, football team.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You a Buccaneer fan?
R:  I watch them on TV.
L:  Do you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not much of a football fan, then?
R:  Ah, it's -- first of all you can't get in the stadium --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- 'cause it's sold out.
L:  Really?  And you can't even go to the games, can you?
R:  No, you can't get there.  There's just -- there's seven --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- seventy two thousand seats, and every single one of them is sold.
L:  Sold out to the rich people?
R:  It's -- yeah.  It's, ah, --
L:  To the ultra rich. 
R:  -- predominantly season -- it's season ticket holders.
L:  Yeah, season ticket holders.
R:  There are no -- there's no general admission, and the waiting list for season tickets is --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- a mile long.
L:  Good gracious.
R:  But, ah, --
L:  Well, I'm like you, I -- if I've -- I watch them on television, that's about as far as I go. 
R:  I mean, if I could get the opportunity to go, I'd go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it just -- there's no oppor- there's no opportunity there.  So we watch it on TV.
L:  What is the population of Tam- Tampa?  Bay area?
R:  Greater Tampa Bay Area, which is Tampa, Saint Pete, Clearwater --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, it's -- right now it's around two point four million.
L:  You know, that's probably about the entire population of Mississippi, did you know that?
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] Mississippi's probably had -- we probably got about -- somewhere between two and a half to three million --
R:  Well here -- here's --
L:  -- for the whole state of Mississippi --
R:  -- the problem.  We got two point four million people in the Tampa Bay area.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A third of them are retired.  A third of them are children.
L:  A third are retired and a third are children.  Good gracious.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Wow. [LAUGH] I live in a little small town, about seven thousand people.  So --
R:  That's nice.
L:  But it's an old town, you know, work's got -- we got a lot of antebellum homes, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- magnolia trees.  It's a pretty old town.
R:  Well, what we're planning on doing is looking for, once my wife has her PhD, looking for a, a college town somewhere.
L:  A college town?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah --
R:  I like North Carolina.
L:  -- I don't live too far --
R:  North Carolina --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Tennessee.
L:  Oh, that's pretty up at -- pretty up there in North Carolina and Tennessee.
R:  Oh, it's gorgeous.
L:  Up around that area's a beautiful area.
R:  Mm.  See, we don't get season changes here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm tired of green. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You want some season changes?
R:  I want some season changes --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- I've never actually got -- I've never actually seen it.
L:  Oh, I do.
R:  My kids are getting old enough.
L:  I like season change.  But I -- think about it, I -- you know, at my age, I'm getting where I can't take summertime as much.  I hate summertimes in Mississippi.  The humidity.  It kills me.
R:  Well, in Tampa, summertime starts in
