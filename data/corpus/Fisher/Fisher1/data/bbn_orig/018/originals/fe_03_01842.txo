R:  Hello, this is Regina speaking.
L:  Hi.  My name is Christina.
R:  Hi, Christina, how are ya?
L:  I'm good, how are you? 
R:  Okay.  So, let's see, they said the topic of -- well, for me this evening -- is, ah, computers -- basically computers in schools, whether they hurt or harm education.
L:  Ahah. [NOISE]
R:  Okay.  Well, personally I'm -- let's see, personally I would say I grew up in, like, the cusp of the computer age.  Ah, I went to high school during the, ah, the mid eighties, from eighty four to eighty seven, so that is when computers were really starting to make an inroad.  That's when Apple was popular, when Apple was the big thing, and so one of the first things I actually learnt other than the basics of the keyboard was actually early computer programming which was Basic. I don't know if you remember Basic way back then?
L:  No, actually, 'cause I, um, I went to high school in [MN] the mid nineties.
R:  Okay.  So for you it was, like, it was a totally different thing.  Computers were just already on the scene, technology was just improving whereas when I went computer technology in the classroom was just getting started and everybody I knew who was taking a -- a computer class wasn't really so much about learning, ah, software because software really hadn't taken off, it was about learning programming, whether it was DOS or Basic or -- actually, I think I had friends that learned, ah, Cobol. [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  This -- this is -- this is really dating me in some respects but, ah, -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- personally I think, um, just -- just starting off learning from that was just a springboard to, ah, getting more involved in, ah, other types of, ah, computer technology.  I mean, at -- at this stage of the game if we did not have computer technology it is almost like going backwards to -- to -- to everything that we do from, um, doing business at your bank to checking your bank statements, to writing your papers.  I don't think I -- I know of anybody who is going to sit down at a typewriter now. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And literally type on to a piece of paper and having to deal with correction ribbon if they make a mistake to be perfectly honest.  And let me not just hog the conversation here. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, I -- I remember when I was in high school we did a little bit of the programming and learning to -- to do all that and, um, it was -- it was confusing, you know, 'cause, like, we were used to the software and all that and then trying to figure out how to do all that other stuff was just -- it didn't work. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I -- I -- I guess I can -- I guess I can get what you are saying because now I'm so -- I'm so caught up in it now.  If you were to ask me to try and sit down and learn computer programming now I would be, like, "You've got to be kidding". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, because you're so used to what you have now.
R:  Yeah, and -- and --
L:  Used to how easy it is.
R:  Right.  And, ah, now -- I'm -- I'm trying to keep to the topic, does -- does it hurt or harm education.  I don't see computer technology harming education in any way because for, ah, you know, for the toddlers and their little -- what I like to call their little play computers, not that they would have a laptop or anything like that, but those little simple basic comp- -- ah, I forget, what are those preschool type computers that they have where they can just learn the -- the play basics of letters -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and numbers and what not, to maybe your first or second grader getting on to, like, a basic computer and playing age appropriate, ah, games or doing age appropriate educational programs.  They have so much software out there that it's impossible, I think, not to find something on a -- on a, ah, technological level that's not going to intrigue their minds.  Whether it's art or music or [LIPSMACK] goodness what -- they just have so much stuff and I, myself, don't have any children as of yet but I just see, um, -- I just see where kids take off with it.  I mean, I was thought to be the technological whiz to my parents because I'm always the one that has to sit down and -- and type the letters or --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- with my boss who's -- who -- who -- she grew up in the age of Wang.  I'm like, "Wang?" [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, as- ask a modern day high schooler now, "What's, like, Wang?  What's Wang?"  Wang is like one of those early computer, ah, com- computer companies.  They still exist but don't ask me what they are doing now. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Well, I think, like you said, you know, the computers are good for education but I think that they can also harm.  Like, when I went to school and I had computer classes most of the time all we did was get on the internet.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And chat rooms and things like that.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think that that aspect can hurt kids if they're allowed to do that because they are not learning anything useful.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  I see that is -- that is the other flipside to the coin because the other people -- the other reason why people love computers so much is access to the worldwide web and it is just, ah, I don't c- -- I don't want to call it a big waste land but for a kid it is like a big old candy store.
L:  Right.
R:  And I can get whatever I want, ah, if your parents or your teachers aren't looking over your shoulders to say, "Why are you here?" [LAUGH] "What are you doing?"
L:  Yeah, and so many sites that are inappropriate have names that would be for -- you know, like, if you are looking up the government's website and you type in a little something wrong.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Then something inappropriate comes up and if a kid comes along that, you know, what are they to do?
R:  Yeah, it's, like, they're just going to sit and -- an average typical kid is just going to wind up finding out what he can find out.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  An- and the funny thing is is that, ah, you know, you try to pol- -- you try to police it, parents try to police this, teachers try to police it, they try to put in -- for every, ah, precaution that you try to take somebody is always trying to get around it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  So it's -- so it's basically just a constant fight but I would say in general I don't think anybody wants to go back to the day of, ah, of a whole lot of pen and paper.
L:  Right.  In general computers, I think, are just wonderful.
R:  Yes.  I -- that -- that I couldn't -- that I couldn't deny you more -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- because I like the fact that I can do my spreadsheets, do my research, ah, type my articles, research my grants -- well, they are not my grants they are for my -- our boss.  I do other work in terms of trying to research grants for her arts and education 'cause she's like a small five oh one C. three and I feel for her so badly because, um, she's much older than I am.  She jus- just hit the cusp of sixty and all she did was Wang, and Wang was entirely different.  We are not even talking about office productivity software.
L:  [LAUGH]  Right.
R:  Which she could use desperately, but for her everything is, ah, -- the only thing she really mastered was email.  I'm like, "Well, it's a step in the right direction", and I had to show her how to do it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  It's a step in the right direction but I'm thinking in a business sense your productivity just sinks.
L:  Yeah, yeah, computers -- 
R:  W- w- without knowing your office productivity basics.  I don't know a person around who doesn't have, um, [LIPSMACK] -- who doesn't have office, some type of office, with Excel and Windows and what not, and, oh, it -- it -- it makes me cringe some of the stuff she tries to do.  I'm like, oh, --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- not only do you need to take some classes, believe me when I tell you but I don't think I see that forthcoming. [LAUGH] [inaudible] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, but in -- I think you also have to know a thorough knowledge of everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because I started to work for my boss, like, a year ago and the person who worked for her before me had -- they had different databases and access.  Well, instead of using one database and kind of clearing different information from that database, they had, like, twenty different databases.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it was horrible.  Like, if you wanted to enter in information you'd have to enter in the same information in twenty different databases.
R:  Ooh, painful. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, yes.  And so, you know, then I kind of was, like, "Wait a second.  [LAUGH] This isn't working". [LAUGH]  So ...
R:  Yeah, but the thing is it works for them. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  But it's -- but it's so unproductive.
L:  Yeah.  It's repetitive.
R:  And tha- -- yes, and -- and that's the thing with, ah, computers in education in general.  Ah, you streamline the -- the whole process and you can correct your errors at the same time and with whatever software you can study whatever subjects you wa- -- whatever subject you want and it -- it to me is just plain fascinating.  It's, like, and -- and the funny thing is it's just the springboard to, ah, learn -- ah, just extend yourself into other technological aspects to be perfectly honest.  I mean, started, ah, going online and looking up stuff on the internet and then it's, like, I wound up finding about, um, different types of technologies just because of that doggone thing they call a microchip. 
L:  [MN] 
R:  And the microchip is where it all just got started. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And -- and it's funny.  Some technologies shrank really small.  I mean, -- yea- -- oh, -- yeah, people are still holding -- people were holding on to their, ah, walkmans when I went to school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Walkmans were the big thing and now it's like everybody is, like, -- I don't see anybody carrying a walkman.  Everybody is now still holding on to their CDs where other parts of the country are, like, "What are you holding on with that for?"  It's like you've got mini disks now or MP three.
L:  Yeah, the MP three.
R:  So it feels, like, -- except I don't see too many of those.  I -- I see --
