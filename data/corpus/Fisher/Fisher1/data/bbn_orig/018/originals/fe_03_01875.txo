R:  Hey, how are you?  My name's Ben.
L:  Elaine Rogers.
R:  Um, how are you doing today? 
L:  Fine.
R:  Good.  Um, have you, ah, made a phone call, you know, doing this, ah, study before? 
L:  No.
R:  Okay.  Me neither.  Ah, so we're supposed to talk about family for, ah, for ten minutes, I guess, right? 
L:  Yes.
R:  So, ah, [NOISE] 
L:  Well, I have five sons.
R:  Oh, really?  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  One of them was killed.
R:  Sorry to hear that.
L:  One of them's in Cleveland with the carnival. 
R:  Yeah, wow. 
L:  And one of them walked across America, just printed a book. 
R:  Walked across America?
L:  He's in the process.
R:  Wow.  That's a -- that's a pretty long walk.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I mean -- [LAUGH]
L:  Twenty thousand miles.
R:  So is that, um, -- I mean, it -- it -- does that take a couple of years to walk across America? 
L:  Six years he planned --
R:  [inaudible]  All right. 
L:  -- 'cause he doesn't walk in the winter time.
R:  Did he -- did he manage to get, ah, some corporate sponsors? 
L:  Yes. [SIGH]  
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  There's a tent sponsor that supplies all the tents.
R:  Okay.
L:  He has a website.
R:  Yeah.  Wow, that's pretty neat.
L:  It's Shel[?] Tilley[?] hikes dotcom.
R:  Wow.  Well I hope --
L:  His book's on there for sale.
R:  Okay, great.
L:  My other son restores old cars, antiques.
R:  Mhm.  And -- and -- so you said you had one -- so you have four sons that are still, ah, living or ...
L:  Yes.
R:  And, ah, one works for the carnival? 
L:  Yes.
R:  So what -- what, ah, -- what -- what does he do?  Does he --
L:  For Bates Brothers.
R:  For Bates Brothers?  But does he have an act or does he --
L:  No.
R:  -- he manages --
L:  He ru- runs the machines and stuff.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  The rides.
R:  Wow.  Well, that -- that's pretty neat.  That's -- and what about your fourth son?
L:  He's laying in bed at the moment.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Is he not feeling well or is he just, ah, --
L:  Nah, he's just --
R:  -- sleeping in?
L:  -- dropped out.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Do you have any suggestions?
R:  Um, well, I -- I'm -- [LAUGH] I don't know yet.  How old is your son?
L:  Thirty something.
R:  Thirty something?  Does he, ah, -- did he finish high school and college or ...?
L:  Yes.  Finished high school.
R:  Okay.
L:  Went to the navy.
R:  Well?  Did he ge- -- did he learn something about, ah, --
L:  No.
R:  In the navy, nothing?
L:  No.
R:  No electrical engineering or anything like that?
L:  No.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I don't -- I don't know.  I think, um, -- I -- I think a lot of companies probably look, ah, favorably upon military experience, wouldn- -- don't you?
L:  If it's a good military experience.
R:  Yeah.  He did -- he didn't -- he didn't stay in the navy long enough? 
L:  No. [NOISE]
R:  No.  Okay.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, you can -- he can always -- you know, have -- he's got to -- you have to start somewhere, so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you have t- -- I guess, ah, you know, he might want to think about taking classes in, ah, to be -- to become, ah, you kno- -- a nurse, ah, technician or ...
L:  Well, he's a terrific chef. [NOISE]
R:  Well, then -- then he -- I guess you should try to get a -- you know, try to get a job first maybe just -- just doing short order cooking and then see if he can move up from there, make enough money to take --
L:  Well, the first thing he has to do is get over the booze.
R:  Yeah. W- -- 
L:  Because you can't do anything when it's in control.
R:  Well, I mean, does he -- does he, ah, -- I mean, I -- I have a little bit of -- I dri- -- I drink a little too much probably myself, so ... 
L:  Well, he's tried several times.
R:  Really?
L:  And it doesn't seem to work.  I don't know what to -- I wish there was a magic pill you could give 'em.
R:  I guess you got to -- just got to try again, that's all.
L:  That would be great.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  It can be tough because, ah, I'm sure he feels like he, ah, he needs to catch a break.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, if -- if he doesn't --
L:  Yeah, but he has to make his own breaks.
R:  Yeah, you have to make your own break, but even -- sometimes even if you're trying to make breaks they just -- it just seems like nothing ever works out for you.
L:  Well -- 
R:  But you've got to keep trying.
L:  -- my son that walked across America was married.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And on Christmas Eve this wife decided after five years she didn't want to be married any more. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So he went bananas.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  For a little while. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then he hiked the Appalachian Trail.
R:  Yeah, I've want- -- I want to do that.  That sounds like a lot of fun.
L:  And he found out life can be pretty wonderful.
R:  Yeah?  Well, that's -- yeah, it's a nice, ah, -- it's a nice -- I mean -- I -- I -- I've heard -- I know people who -- he did the whole Appalachian Trail?
L:  Yeah, he did.
R:  Yeah, okay. 
L:  He went from Georgia to Maine. 
R:  That's about -- that's a -- well, that's a coup- -- that's a couple of months at lea- -- that's maybe longer than that.
L:  He worked for Colgate Palmolive.
R:  Okay, sure.
L:  And he went into the boss one day and he said, "I want three things.  Six months leave of absence --"
R:  Sure.
L:  "-- a promotion and a raise", and the boss just laughed at him.
R:  Yeah, right. [LAUGH]
L:  When he told him what he wanted to do, Colgate gave it to him.
R:  Yeah? 
L:  Now look where he is.
R:  Wow, that's great.  That's great.
L:  So you got to make your own breaks.
R:  Yeah, that's true. I --
L:  [SIGH]  
R:  I don't know, it's -- it's, ah, -- times are tough right now, though, with the economy, what it is, right?
L:  Well, I'm an old lady.  I'm on social security.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I know all 'bout the economy.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I'm -- I'm, ah, -- I'm a third year, ah, student at, ah, law school in, um,  --
L:  Oh, that's great. [NOISE]
R:  But I'm -- I'm graduating in a couple weeks and I've -- I've been trying all year to try and find a job and haven't been able to find one, so ... 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, well.
L:  Well, call the government. [NOISE]   Get in on the Iraq deal.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I could -- I could, ah, -- I could go be a JAG in the, ah, the navy or the airforce.
L:  I watch that show every week.
R:  Yeah? 
L:  I think that's the best show on TV.
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, a lot of people like it, you know. 
L:  Yes.  That'd be a good deal.
R:  Yeah, but I think, ah, -- I -- I don't watch the show a whole lot.  I've -- I've watched it a few times but I think it's not -- you know, it's a good job.
L:  Watch it.  It might change your mind.
R:  Yeah?  Okay.  I will. Right.
L:  Yeah, I really like it.
R:  Yeah.  So -- so you're, ah, -- you're retired?
L:  Yes.
R:  You're don't -- you're not working any more?

L:  Well, I got a computer my son bought me for Christmas.
R:  So ha- -- have you started using the internet? 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah?  Yeah, it's -- it's great.  It's -- there's a lot of information out there on the internet.  Sometimes it can be a little hard to -- to fin- -- I mean, it's -- you don't -- you -- it's har- -- sometimes it can be hard, hard to find the information you want.
L:  You can find anything you want on that thing.
R:  Yeah, [inaudible] you can but there -- it's tough because you know there's so much out there, there's a million different websites but, ah, that -- that might -- you know, some of them might be interesting to you but it's hard to find out about them, right?  But, ah, -- yeah.  Yeah.  Or some, um, -- I -- I have two brothers.  Ah, I've got a younger brother who's, ah, going to start law school and, ah, older brother who's a doctor here in town, in Philadelphia.
