R:  Hello? 
L:  Hi? 
R:  Hi, how are you doing [LAUGH] this is kinda weird, ha?  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- ah, my name's Jason.
L:  I'm, Ruth.
R:  Hi, Ruth.  Ah, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- computers and education -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- why don't you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- not exactly -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- one of the -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- topics I was hoping to get --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but why don't you go ahead and talk first.
L:  Well, computers and education definitely, definitely help education.  [NOISE] there is so much you can learn on the internet, they're -- they're -- they're useful in typing, research, everything.  I can't imagine sending my kids to a school that did not use computers.
R:  Nor could I, um, I -- I couldn't agree with you any more, um, I think they've done nothing but broaden the, you know, perception of what is out there and it's brought a lot of things that -- that we never would have learned about that we read about in books but it was just that, it was maybe a picture in a book and now, I don't know, there -- it just seems like it's -- it's has broadened the avenue of information.  I probably sound like a cliche there, but, um, --
L:  It's true.   
R:  -- I'm not a teacher or anything but, um, I at times -- I -- I was in -- in school for teaching and I could not imagine -- I actually taught a class last night, but --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but I could not imagine --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- not having -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- computers at a, ah, --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- at my disposal --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- or at -- or at -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- my disposal as a college student, I didn't necessarily have em growing up until high school but, um, I couldn't imagine being [NOISE] in grade school now and not having a computer.
L:  It's funny, my daughter is in preschool and they use computers [NOISE] --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- all the time.  I can't  -- I just -- it's just there is so much they can do, there's [NOISE] so much they can [NOISE] access --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- [NOISE] and it brings -- it brings [NOISE] the information to life --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's [NOISE] 
L:  Right.
R:  -- I just can't imagine life without computers.
R:  No, neither could I and I -- I don't know that I would have initially -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- said that because I was, you know, --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- computer --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ignorant for the first -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- few years when they started really, um, being more broadly used, um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I was kind of afraid of them -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, um, my nieces and -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- my nephews kinda knew more about em than I did -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- initially and -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- now I too I -- I have a three year old and she is, um, she's awesome at the computer and she's learned so much --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- through, you know, colors and shapes and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- linguistics and  --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know just -- just pretty --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- everything that she does on there --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- she's learning and, ah, you know [MN] and often motor skills and all --
L:  Oh, yeah [NOISE] 
R:  -- that, you know -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so, it's very important I think, especially with -- with -- with younger kids now to get em before they are jaded, um, because -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I know when I started that I was -- I was very, you know,, very nervous about -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- what to do and I -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- remember taking keyboarding in high school -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and being like I -- this is just -- this is so bizarre, I don't -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but I guess that was before the internet, I'm thirty three, so -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I graduated in nineteen eighty eight and I guess like, um, early eighties, eighty four we started -- we had, like, two computers in our school and now, ah, I actually recently went back to a, um, [LIPSMACK] -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- actually a couple of years ago I well to my reunion and [MN] every classroom had, you know, fifteen, twenty, forty of em in each classroom -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that's pretty cool. 
L:  [NOISE] I -- computers I -- I've been on computers as since as long as I can remember. [NOISE] 
R:  Wow. 
L:  [NOISE] it's just I -- I -- I just can't imagine life without them, [NOISE] I know that sounds so -- so odd, but ... 
R:  No, it really doesn't sound odd [LAUGH], you know --  
L:  Well, I'm like, -- I'm -- I'm only twenty three, so --  
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  -- it's just been [NOISE] -- it's been such a part of my life since as long as I can remember --  
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- I can't -- I can't remember like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [NOISE] I think is it from, like, middle school on computers [NOISE] have always been in the classroom we've always used them.
R:  Right, and I'm assuming that you probably at that point, you know, after a few years you knew a lot more about them than your -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- parents probably? 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Unless they were, you know, obviously in the -- in the computer field, but -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- people, um, I guess you're parent's age -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- especially like they were --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- initially --  
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.   
R:  -- it was like this -- this -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- weird thing -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- there was a movie a long time ago called Two Thousand And One A Space Odyssey --  
L:  Good movie.
R:  -- and -- yeah, it's an excellent -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- movie and that was, like, the first exposure I ever had to a computer -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- or what a computer did --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and especially it's so funny --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- how they used to be, like, these humongous, large things --  
L:  [NOISE] Now they're so little.
R:  Now [LAUGH] they're so little, you're right, you know --
L:  It's amazing.
R:  -- you have em on a cell phone it's like, it's amazing.
L:  I, ah -- I was taking this class last semester [NOISE] and my teacher or my professor was telling us [NOISE] about these little microscopic like pa- -- computers like the size of a -- a grain of sand -- 
R:  Wow.
L:  -- they were developing.  I -- it's just --
R:  That is so unfathomable, you know --  
L:  -- it just amazes me they used to take up entire rooms -- 
R:  Right.   
L:  -- now they're the grain of a --
R:  Now they're a tiny grain, that's -- that's amazing  --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it really is amazing [NOISE].  Um, you said your -- you have a daughter in preschool? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [MN] do they --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- computers I'm assuming at preschool and [MN] like you said they -- they all use them -- 
L:  Yep.
R:  -- and access them -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it really helps motor skills I think too -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I mean my daughter initially when she started messing around with this she was like one and a half I guess, or --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- something like that, just because we did she would, like, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- hit the keyboard and now she, like, knows how to double click and how to right click --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- it's -- it's so cool --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's so cool to watch kids --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- on computers because -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they're learning the entire time, you know, --  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and they don't even know they're learning which is even more of the beauty of it.  So I -- I think they're an absolute necessity, I could not see --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know a lot of, like, ah, people who live more rurally, I mean I'm not saying that they can't --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- learn, but --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the, um, the scope of what they can -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- learn is just so minimalized --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- compared to what, you know, mainstream schools --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's just --  
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- yep, definitely.  So, I think all the money and all the funding that goes --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- towards internet --
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  -- uses, absolutely money well spent.
L:  Definitely.  I mean I'm [NOISE] all for computers -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and education.  As far as the internet [NOISE] I'm al [NOISE] all for it as long as they [NOISE] provide certain safeguards.
R:  Absolutely, yeah that's --  
L:  That's --
R:  -- mandatory, you know --
L:  -- it's essential.
R:  -- [MN] ah, it is essential because we don't want em, you know, learning how to use em for the wrong reasons, although they figure that out, you know, [LAUGH] --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- as they go I'm sure how to do that but, um, yeah, there definitely needs to be, you know, lots of network security in schools --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in school systems, um, 'cause ...  
L:  [MN] I was just, ah, back at my high school they now make students sign an internet usage policy [NOISE] --  
R:  Really?
L:  Before they're allowed access to any of the computer labs.
R:  Saying that if you don't use it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- probably you risk, what, like, um, --  
L:  [MN] It's no access.
R:  Oh, you get no access? 
L:  No --
R:  It's like, -- like a once and done type thing? 
L:  N- -- um, I think it's two strikes you're out.
R:  Wow.
L:  Which -- I'm  -- I'm -- I think that's -- that's essential.
R:  Right.
L:  For high school for all of them [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Right.
L:  Sleepy girl, sleepy girl.
R:  You -- you're daughter is going to sleep right now? 
L:  Yes, she's laying on me. [LAUGH] 
R:  I just actually just put my three year old to bed, she's in there, ah, listening to music and playing of course, but --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- it's, ah, [NOISE] pretty cool --
L:  But computers definitely have -- 
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- to have them [NOISE] 
R:  Absolute, absolute --  
L:  [NOISE].
R:  [MN] are you -- have you done this for -- is this, like, your first call, or? 
L:  This is my first call.
R:  This is my first call too [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  At first I didn't answer the phone and I was, like, "U of Penn, what the heck?".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I actually -- I'm a -- I'm a children and family therapist and I, um, -- I make some referrals to University of Pennsylvania to, like, their anxiety clinic and whatnot --  
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and, ah, when I first saw them, like, "Jesus --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- is this going to be a call about a client [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- and if it is it is probably an emergency" --  
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  -- but, ah, then I got  -- I immediately called back, so.  I guess you do three calls a day? 
L:  Ah, I -- this is, like, the first time they've ever called me, so I --  
R:  Right, okay.  It's -- it's -- it's pretty  [MN] as we're thinking about that --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, they're using computers as an educational tool to learn about --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- us because the computers are making these phone calls --  
L:  That's -- 
R:  -- and picking the topics, that's pretty interesting --  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- it's kind of ironic.  Yeah, like you said it's just so hard to -- to even fathom --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a school --  
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- or any kind of education system, be it like, you know, even like a low cost, um, no cost to you like Head Start program --  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- because they even have 'em, like, --  
L:  Yep [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, so, I could --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- not --
L:  [NOISE] all [MN] --
R:  -- imagine  -- imagine not having them.
L:  I'm trying to think all of the Head Start programs all -- they all have computers --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- in our area.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, I mean even like, um,  you know, hospitals that I go in and psychiatrist wards --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- And, ah, --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- [MN] all kind of providers, you know, --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- every place has computers, it's like not even just --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like education, like people --
L:  [NOISE] [MN]  
R:  -- are educating themselves while they're at other things I mean at, like, coffee houses and --  
L:  Oh, yeah [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, you can be in a waiting room waiting for your car to get serviced and you can go online --  
L:  Mhm [NOISE] 
R:  -- and really you're educating yourself.
L:  It's [NOISE] -- it's just an essential that of life now [NOISE] 
R:  Ab- absolutely, absolutely, so, ah, --  
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  Now, I think we're, like, right around our ten minute mark too --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and it soundings like, you know, you have your daughter there, that's -- that's awesome.
L:  She's [NOISE] got a little bit of a cold, [NOISE] so she's cuddling up [LIPSMACK]. 
R:  Very clingy? 
L:  Well, when she's sick she is.
R:  Right, yeah, --
L:  So ... 
R:  So is my daughter.  I have a five month old too --  
L:  Oh.   
R:  -- it's pretty cool, so, yeah --  
L:  Great age.
R:  Um, yeah, it is, it's a really cool age, she's starting do all kinds of, ah, cool stuff,  you know, being able to grab things on the first try, I don't know --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just the noises he's making and stuff  --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's really cool -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I'm very lucky, very, very lucky.
L:  [NOISE] oh, sounds like it.
R:  Yeah, so, um.  This is actually -- you have one child? 
L:  I actually have two --
