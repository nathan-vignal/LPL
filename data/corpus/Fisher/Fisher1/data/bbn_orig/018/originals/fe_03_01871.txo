L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name's Feralita[?].  Ah, --
R:  My name's Matthew.
L:  Hi, Matthew.  So what does family mean to you?
R:  Ah, ah, I guess probably immediate family, just when -- if I was to think of it I would just think of my father, my mother and, ah, my two siblings.
L:  Ah, mine is -- [NOISE] I do genealogy so I feel, like, we're all related and if you're from a small town everybody is related to each other.
R:  Oh.
L:  I see that -- I can see the connections, especially [COUGH] when you get back a couple hundred years [NOISE] you can see how people start to relate to each other.  That, you know, it's more than just -- just your immediate family.  It goes further beyond that. [NOISE]
R:  I would always love to, ah, to do that.  My family has, ah, roots in Ireland and actually relations -- blood relations still on the same farmhouse that my great grandfather emigrated from.  I've always wanted to go out there and experience that and meet them, but I -- you know, I come from fairly -- just I live in a suburb of DC and so it's just, you know, real, you know, isolated sub- suburbia where you, you know, people co- -- especially Washington where it's a real transient area.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  People come and go and stuff, so.  I mean, -- 
L:  I --
R:  I guess -- you know.
L:  [NOISE] I don't know, everybod- -- everyone is like that.  I noticed when I -- my husband and I are both from -- I was born Detroit [NOISE] but he was born in Maine, and our -- both our families were born in the same town in Machias[?] and, ah, you know, connecting area, mine's Machias and his was Jones, um, port and I notice that we have a lot of coll- -- connecting lines and the further I get back the more they connect.  And, you know, I thought, "You know, I'm from Detroit, how the heck can I be that closely related", you know?  [NOISE] But when you start doing that you start finding out that people are more connected than they think they are. [NOISE] [COUGH]
R:  Would it -- would [inaudible] that old adage.  I think -- I had a professor today tell me that he was four handshakes away from, ah, John Stuart Mill. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Just because of, you know, the whole six degrees of separation thing.  Everybody is so closely related to everybody else in that sense.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm not so sure how much that actually, you know, holds, you know, 'cause, I mean, you coul- -- you could say that but at the same time I -- you know, I don't have --
L:  You have to have proof. 
R:  I don't have any connection in --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in any social sense, any real feeling sense beyond, you know, --
L:  It's the same when you start doing all that and you get back and your families you start seeing -- like, you said your family is from Ireland, you know, and you'll go back and read your family's last name and you'll find out that in Ireland a lot of their families, ah, had towns.  Like, your family was O'Bryan, you know, they had a whole town of O'Bryans. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Actually its, ah, -- we're Dwyers and it's -- from Tipperary County.  I'm not quite sure where in Tipperary County but we -- we -- that whole side of my family originates from there.
L:  [NOISE]  So I think that's really fascinating.  I love to research people's families.  I d- I could do that all day long, [LAUGH] and I spend -- 
R:  Wel- -- w- -- yeah.
L:  -- many hours reading census reports and, I mean, I just enjoy doing it.
R:  One of my -- one interesting thing, I would love to be able to take the time some time and do a gene- genealogy thing, because that -- that -- that's one side of my family.  The other side of my family, um, is Jewish and during world war two they emigrated over here and di- -- changed their last name, destroyed all the records just in case, you know, America lost the war.
L:  Yep.  They di- -- th- that was very common. 
R:  So I don't even know, I don't even know what happened, like, you know, if you were to, you know, establish yourself, you know, regionally, like, I'm from, you know, Germany or from Ireland, I don't know where half of my -- my genes come from.
L:  Well, I think once you get back you find out they came from everywhere. [LAUGH]  I mean, because I always thought -- my dad's family was German.  My mom's family they emigrated here in the -- before the Mayflower.  You know, they came over there, they had that first boat that came over before everybody thinks of the Mayflower, but they came over before that in the sixteen hundreds and when you start doing all of that, you start reading all this, you think, when you get back further, her family came from England, [LAUGH] and they came from Ireland, because I guess over in Europe everybody -- they came from everywhere. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then you just find out people are just more connected.  You thin- think how foolish it is for people to get so upset over religion, you know, it's so trivial because we were all probably related, you know.  [NOISE] If you go back far enough everybody's related, and it's just -- it's just really weird when you start seeing it.  I used to think of, you know, my little town and you thought, well, if you met another person with your last name you're related, you know, [LAUGH] because it's a small town and then you realize, you know, this really is common.  You are all probably related. [LAUGH]
R:  That's interesting.
L:  When you go back far enough.
R:  Yeah.  Did --
L:  It's just getting back that far. [NOISE]
R:  That's -- that's an interesting way to think about it because I spent a good deal --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of this semester last semester learning about hu- -- the evolution of human rights and one of the sticking points, especially from a western perspective, is rather than, you know, we should disregard, you know, the -- the -- the dehumanizing aspects of, you know, what you classify yourself as.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, rather instead of viewing yourself, you know, as -- as viewing yourself as isolated as everybody has their own individual autonomous sphere in that i- it would be necessary for those group -- group identifications and collective identities to -- to kind of almost, you know, fade away.
L:  Right.
R:  In order for that to -- as opposed to taking the perspective that that were -- you know, rather, you know, this is actually someone who somewhere along the line is actually, you know, related with in that sense being able to humanize them.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  [inaudible]
L:  I don't know, I just -- I just enjoy doing it.  My husband thinks I'm silly but I just enjoy doing it and I love finding other families and just finding out, you know, how they all came here and what's their reason for being here and it's interesting.  I mean, it's just -- I could live my whole life doing this. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  Researching for other people.
R:  That -- that's great.  I -- I -- I'm still searching for what I want to do with the rest of my life.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So I would love to be able to find something that interested me that much, so ...
L:  Well, you're probably really young, right?
R:  Yeah, I'm real young.  So -- 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I've got some time.
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, I'm like -- I'm fif- -- getting close to fifty, so ...
R:  Okay. [MN]
L:  And I think they say the average person that researched their family is in their forties, so it's the time to renew and look back. [LAUGH]  So you've got lots of time. 
R:  Yep.
L:  I have young kids, too.  I have a son that's -- well, he's twenty and a daughter that's, oh, she's going to be thirty [NOISE] [LAUGH] and, ah, you know, they're just now trying to decide what they want to do in life. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, she's thinking, "I'm going to be in the medical field".  My son, he wants to do computers. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  And me I don't -- I really just go with the flow. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  That's probably really the bes- -- the only way you can actually enjoy yourself, if you just accept things and go with the flow.
L:  Yeah.  Just accept what happens and what goes on in life. [COUGH]  Do you have a big family?
R:  Um, in -- five people in my immediate family.  My dad's side's a big family and my mom's side is pretty much.  So, my dad's side's all interconnected and real close and cousins all live within the same area that they've -- they've lived when they first came over, I guess three generations ago.
L:  Oh, I see. 
R:  So --
L:  That's great.
R:  -- a fairly close area.  So it's nice.
L:  See, we both moved away so we have no connections here in our town.  I mean, we live in Ohio so we have no connection to anybody here. [COUGH]  It's just funny because our kids will be the first ones and they've lived in one area their whole life so they consider this is where they're from and, ah, that's probably what they will always feel but really their family is not from here, our family is from east. [LAUGH]  And, ah, it's just odd how it -- I think that now the world is -- everybody is just, like, it -- like you said, the family is just you and your, you know, your parent.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But years ago it was more the whole community was your family, the whole town, because you were related to everybody, you know.  [NOISE]  You would dare not say anything to your neighbor, it might be a cousin.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They knew your parents [LAUGH] and they would call and tell on you, "Hey, he did this".  [MN]  So there's -- there's a big difference to the change over on families.  They are more isolated.
R:  What do you think's the cause of that?
L:  I think the -- the -- when towns started, um, not reinforcing in keeping their -- their children home by going -- keeping up with the times, you know, like, um, [COUGH] to give you an example, our small town, um, had no jobs for the children.  Most kids didn't want to lobster fish or they didn't want to clam dig.
R:  [MN]
L:  Okay?  Our town did not want to [NOISE] make an airport so that you could bring in revenue, you know, like have people come travel to the town, hunters, you know, and stuff like that.  So they wouldn't go with the flow.  Well, these kids had to make a living and the only way to make a living is to join a service and leave the area.  So they leave the area and you lose all your ties.  When you move away you don't have the ties to your family.  Yeah, sure, you love and you talk to y- your parents but you lose touch with cousins.  And if a town don't grow and your kids all leave your town, all their connections are gone.  They've started somewhere else, you know.  So the --  the  ties are all broken.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If the -- you know, the idea is if you want your kids to have that neat little set unit you need to -- the towns need to advance.  Keep their kids able to support themself to stay.  Why would they want to leave?  You know, most people when you talk to small peo- -- people that live in small towns will either leave home if there's no -- you know, "I can't money back there".  You know, "I had to go, I had to go to the big city". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Do you think it's possible, though, to be able to move all that -- that type of industrial tech- technological opportunities into small towns without either they themselves, like, getting bigger or, [MN] you know, just not physically possible to actually do that, to move centres of eco- econom- economy into --
