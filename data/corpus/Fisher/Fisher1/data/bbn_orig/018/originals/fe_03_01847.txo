L:  Hey, how's it going? 
R:  Good, I'm Dawn, how are you?
L:  I'm good, my name's Bevan.
R:  Kevin?
L:  K- Bevan, with a B.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, tell me your name one more time?
R:  Dawn.  D.A.W.N.
L:  Dawn, okay.  Nice to meet you, Dawn.
R:  Nice to meet you too.  Um, computers in education.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, --
R:  Would you like to go first?  Yeah? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I could talk a lot about it.  I'm in gr- I'm in grad school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And in -- ah, I'm studying ESL.
R:  Oh, that's interesting.
L:  English -- yeah, English as a second language.
R:  Ah, yeah.
L:  And, ah, that one of the big things is computers in education, does it work and does it not work, and, um, do -- have you worked with -- I don't, I don't know any of your educational background, do you work with computers at all in education, or do you have --
R:  I have, ah, I work -- at home I have heavy computers, and um --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- when I did work, um, I'm right now taking care of my children, but when I worked I worked at a university, and I wasn't teaching, but, ah, we've had the computers in the workplace, and then, um, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's been a long time since I've been a student, but -- [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, okay.
R:  There were -- we had computers then, but not as much, but --
L:  Yeah.  I -- well, I mean, I guess the advantage and disadvantages that -- and advantage to using computers is be- -- like you said, you just use them, you have it at home and use it all in the workplace, it's kind of a necessity right now.  Um, --
R:  I think that --
L:  -- to, I mean, to know computer skills.  But, um, besides, I mean, just learning computer skills, a lot of what they're trying to do is actually use computers to make the education process better.  In the fact that -- I mean, the internet has some advantages -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, that -- with the information that the students have available, they can run out and --
R:  It's wonderful.  It is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You can get --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- anything.  I'm -- it spoils you to just run over there and look anything up -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- instantly.  Are you studying to be a -- to teach at a --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- like in a public -- you want to teach, um, --
L:  Well, I want to teach overseas.
R:  Oh, that'll be -- I,  I have a friend who did ESL, but she was doing it at a, um, she was working with college students, um, -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- not necessarily in the -- in a grade school, in a -- younger students.
L:  Okay.
R:  So.
L:  Yeah, I -- and I would -- I, I can't wait to go overseas, I just love being over there, I love working with, ah, [NOISE] internationals -- but other thing is, I spent -- I've spent a lot of time in, in classes on using computers -- are you still there?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay, okay.  I heard a click and I didn't know if I lost you.  I'm sorry about that.
R:  Well -- 
L:  Um, --
R:  -- our phone line tends to click a lot, but --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I'm still here. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, okay, I just wanted to make sure I didn't lose you and I'm talking to nobody.  Um, I spent, like, a lot of time in classes that use -- that talk about using computers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they talk about, like, using chat rooms and then, you know, you can -- if you wanna teach English to students overseas --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you can find classes, like I could find -- I have friends over in America here who teach high school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I could get them who teach high school, and then I could go overseas and have my English class, you know, get on a chat room with the students in America, so you know, they're actually talking with native speakers.
R:  Oh, that would be --
L:  And --
R:  -- interesting, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And then -- I mean, so one of the ways if you want to learn a language is to actually [NOISE] talk to people who use the language.
R:  Mhm, sure.  Yes.
L:  And --
R:  [LAUGH] Definitely.
L:  Yeah, yeah, and that's great for, for them, and then it's great for the American students, you know, just to get a little more of a cultural understanding --
R:  Well yeah --
L:  -- of --
R:  -- it's good for, like if somebody was -- if you were in France and you had some students that were trying to learn French --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and then they could speak English -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- to them some too.  So it's kinda like --
L:  The --
R:  -- they used to do the pen pals, but the computers --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- would be a lot more, um, efficient, I think, [LAUGH] effective.
L:  Yeah, it's more -- it's more efficient.  It's a little more -- 'cause you can get, it's more of a conversation instead of just a, um, just you know, the writing and then you've got to wait for --
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  -- for so long.  Um, and the, the -- there is some big disadvantages though.  One is -- I plan to teach in more poor countries --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, I've been -- I've been to China and I love teaching in China, and China's a l- it's not, I won't call it a poor country, but it's a developing country.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, if I go to a place like, um, you know, India or the Philippines or, um, you know, there's even an opportunity for me to work in an orphanage in Morocco, ah, using computers will just be out of the question, because, you know, they don't have the money or the resources.
R:  That's true.
L:  Or -- and you know, that's something that I, I -- because I want to work overseas I've tried to put everything into perspective, and teaching computer skills is one thing, but then trying to use it so much, um, --
R:  Yeah, you'd have to know another -- you couldn't just have everything based on, ah, --
L:  Well, yeah, yeah, it'd have to have -- I have -- the problem is just the access.  You know, there's almost -- in, in a number of places -- in -- the internet's, I mean, getting pretty widespread but, I mean, as far as, you know, if you -- it's kind of a different story, like when I taught at -- in China, you know, you think of the schools in America and that's just what we know, but then, you know, like living over there and our school was a cement block, you know, and the win- there -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- were no windows, it just, like, cement holes in the wall, you know, and --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So go over there and then -- there was internet access, there were like a lot of internet cafes are pretty popular over there -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but then to be able to have, you know, if you're teaching a class with sixty kids, you know, they're not going to to have -- the university's not gonna have a sixty computer computer lab that just, you know, that you just don't have that.
R:  Well, even if they had, there'd probably be a competition among all the --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- different students trying to get in to --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- to use it, so you couldn't count on it -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- using it too heavily in the curriculum.
L:  Yeah.  So, there -- there's, there's a lot of really good advantages, there's a lot of disadvantages that are just --
R:  I have a five year old who's about to start kindergarten, and, um, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- he is very -- of course he'll be going to school here, so we gotta do the computer thing very heavily.
L:  Right.
R:  But my husband's a programmer, which is another --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- he's exposed to the computers at home constantly. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  So that we've got, like, four in the house, the lap- two laptops and two desktops, and -- so he's just inundated with computers constantly, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when I -- I did teacher training ten years ago, or twelve years ago I think, and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- that was very different than -- there wasn't, um, -- they had, like, the one computer lab in the school, they didn't even have them in the classrooms at that time.
L:  Right.
R:  And, I didn't -- I don't think I even took a computer class at all in my training, so --
L:  Yeah.  I -- ah, when I went to undergrad I just, I just graduated last year from undergrad, this is my first year of grad school, and I had, ah, I had a class on computer applications, like how to use Word and Micro- and Excel and those things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And how to get around.  But I mean, I n- outside of that I never had it in class.  Like I never used it in a class.  I'd type things up, but I mean besides that I never used it.
R:  Oh, I see what you mean.  It wasn't part of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the -- they weren't teaching you on the computer.
L:  Right, right.  And, like, something they're doing -- well, like, with the -- especially in younger kids, like with your -- your son, you said?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Who's just going into kindergarten?
R:  Yes.
L:  Like, they have educational software, so, you know, it's not like they're gonna teach them how to use Word and stuff and how to use a computer, but they'll use a computer, you know, with, um, [MN] I don't know, to teach them sounds and teach them colors and --
R:  Oh, yeah, we've got that --
L:  But --
R:  -- he's already on that now.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So he does a couple of different --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they have them with everybody, all the popular characters so they're interested that way, and then they've got the educational stuff --
L:  Right.  And --
R:  -- in there.
L:  Yeah, and like, ah, elementary and high school especially, I mean, you're gonna get those, those kind of -- they're -- it's gonna be the computer more for educational purposes, and then -- I ha- I don't know too many people in the universities that, ah, use computers besides this teaching application that -- as far as I know.
R:  Well, I worked, um, in financial aid when I was in college --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, we didn't require it at the school I was at, but there were other schools in -- I live in [inaudible]. There were other schools in [inaudible] that required the students to have a laptop.  That was part of their, um, their fees --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- part of their budget.  So they were smaller schools.  The school I worked at had, like, twenty five thousand students so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- didn't get into that, but the smaller schools that was like their little -- their niche that, ah, everybody would have a laptop and they would be doing the -- and this has been --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- oh heavens, it's been six years.  So, they were just starting to do that, to, um, [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah, it's become really popular now.  I go to a large school school too, so we don't have that, but --
R:  Yeah, we had the -- we had one computer lab [LAUGH] with not that many computers, [LAUGH] so --
L:  Okay.
R:  I guess they figured you would find a computer somewhere else to type your papers on or something, but --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I'm in a large university and we have a lot of computer labs too, but then, you know, you think about it, I guess I'm thinking when you go down into elementary school and stuff -- not even elementary school but even high school, I mean, how many high schools have, like, enough computer labs with access for all the students to be able to use?  
R:  [MN]
L:  At the moment it's not widespread enough that I know that -- at least in -- especially in poorer communities and poorer schools.  I mean, that's one thing to consider, you know, the -- just having access to that stuff for the students, that's gonna take a lot of money, you know, to --
R:  Even, um, --
L:  -- open up all these --
R:  -- we live in a good school district, but even in the classrooms they have, like, a few computers --
L:  Right.
R:  -- which I think is nice they have them in each classroom 'cause when I was student teaching it was one computer lab, and they would have the classes, you know, going in and out --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- um, and they'd have, like, the computer, you know, teacher person, and the -- I did elementary so it'd be that the kids would be doing keyboarding and stuff like that.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, but they didn't have any in the classrooms at that time -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- it's always a -- my husband was excited to hear they had them in the classrooms.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'll be interested to see what they, um, see what they do with it.
L:  Yeah. Y-
