L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Um, I'm -- my name's Kevin.
R:  Um, Luka[?].
L:  How are you doing? 
R:  I'm good.
L:  Um, yeah, so -- 
R:  So are we supposed to talk about computers and education?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, um.
L:  What -- first -- first impression, good or bad? 
R:  First impression good.
L:  I agree.
R:  Okay, why?
L:  Well, because I think it's -- it's a good way to entertain the classroom, um -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, there's a lot of things that can be ease -- taught more easily using the computer, um, you know, for people who are more visual in- -- you know, there's better graphic models using computer than, you know, just drawing on the chalk board or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And for students that have, like, disabilities and stuff, you know, maybe computers, you know, for hearing impaired people or something like that it would be easier.
R:  Absolutely, sure.
L:  What about you? 
R:  Well, I think it also levels the playing field in a lot of ways because you can actually get the resources, get the computers in the classrooms.  Ah, you can get information into, say, inner city classrooms that might not otherwise get there.  Um -- 
L:  Ah.
R:  -- international news, um, science, you know, that -- that will not necessarily be brought there by educators.
L:  Very true.
R:  You know, with -- who has less experience, yeah. 
L:  Kind of spreads the resources across the country, too.
R:  Exactly, exactly, you know.  But then the other side of it [LAUGH] you can't always get computers into this classroom, yeah. 
L:  That's true, yeah, and it's very expensive.
R:  Very expensive.
L:  So -- 
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  What about in higher education?
R:  Higher education, oh, gosh, it's getting ridiculous.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They're -- they're telling people to show up with laptops, you know. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I mean -- 
L:  But then you show up with a laptop in class and you spend the whole time talking as a messenger and not actually paying attention to the teacher, you know.
R:  [LAUGH] Are you a student?
L:  Am I a student?   
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Yeah, it's a bit -- it's a bit, um, we weren't doing that when -- when I was there, but, yeah, that's what I hear.
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  Yeah, if that's what happens.
L:  So much goes on on the computer now that, you know, I can't go a single day without turning my computer on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because I'll miss whatever's going on, you know.
R:  Exactly.
L:  But to me, you know, teachers are assigning things on line and having to take tests on line and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  To, you know, just emails and stuff.  I mean, I -- if I don't check my email for two hours, I -- I miss things going on, so you know.
R:  Oh, exactly, right.  I mean, when was the last time you got a call from a professor? 
L:  Yeah, no, never, never happens.
R:  Mhm, exactly.
L:  And, I mean, you know, too much time on your computer, you know, it's like eighty degrees and sunny outside but you have to be stuck inside checking emails and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, doing things on line which is, you know -- it's a -- it's kind of a waste kind of -- well, it might help with the education aspect.  It kind of -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ties you down and chains you to something and makes you -- your eyes bug out from staring at the computer screen all day.
R:  [LAUGH] You can say that, yeah.  But how much time do you actually spend working on the computer and how much do you spend, you know, just talking with people or -- or looking up things that really have nothing to do with your classes?
L:  See, yeah, well, that too, but, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The more they bring into the computer, the more time you're going to waste time, you know, playing computer games or whatever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, playing Solitaire on the computer.
R:  Yeah.  Well, what about that?  What about keeping kids from accessing things that they shouldn't be accessing on -- on, you know, the Internet in class, even if it's not -- you know, not like, pornography or anything like that necessarily, even just computer games? 
L:  Yeah, because there's so many -- so many different things like, there's -- there's nothing -- there's no programme you can get to block kids from playing, you know, shock wave video games or something on line.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Exactly.
L:  It's got a point.  I mean, unrestrained use of the Internet or of computers in the classroom probably wouldn't benefit anyone.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and that really, you know, has to be carefully considered and stuff.  I mean, you know, when I was in, like, you know, grade school and stuff, computers were, like, just coming out, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, we had the old, like, the Apple two Es all through like, seventh grade.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah. 
L:  You know, and then -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, I mean, I'm sure it's a lot different now.  My mom's an elementary school teacher.  In her classroom they've got, you know, I remember, like when I went to school, she teaches at the school I went to.  When I was there, there was one room and it had, like, fifteen computers in it.  Now, she has six computers just in her classroom.
R:  Wow.
L:  And they're all -- they're all hooked up to the Internet and the kids spend so much time on them and stuff so it's kind of -- 
R:  Oh, that must make her life so much easier.
L:  It does in some ways.  Um, keeps the kids occupied and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I mean, I don't know.  It kind of takes a different type of teacher to use the computers a lot too, you know.
R:  As I say, yeah, somebody has to teach the teachers how to use the computers.
L:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
R:  Especially when you deal with a lot of 'em or, you know, a lot of them older, you know, may be even those to retirement aren't necessarily interested in learning the new technology.
L:  Exactly, and it's also kind of hard to incorporate the technology in two traditional classroom settings.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, because [COUGH] there's -- there's only so many ways you can -- you can, you know, use the computer in math class when you're teaching multiplication, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  If you're using the computer too much, you know, you are going to get kids addicted to their calculators like they can't do simple math in their heads.
R:  Exactly.
L:  So there's, you know, I mean, maybe using a computer takes away from, you know, human intelligence.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It -- it bases too much on artificial intelligence.
R:  Or practical application.
L:  Right.
R:  Mhm, mhm.  And that's to going to be harmful even just in -- in terms of the institutions that are already in place, things like the SAT where I think you can use -- actually, I'm not sure if you can use a calculator on SAT any more but I know you can't use it on your, ah, GRE or G maths.
L:  Right.
R:  When you get to that level and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- 
L:  I mean, they have calculators now, like, the -- the newest level of calculator.  I mean, i- there's no point in having a class in multi variable calculus when you can just type it in into your -- into your, um, calculator and it does it for you.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, I mean, when you can't have hal- -- have calculators, they can do that high level of math.
R:  Right.
L:  It almost makes math class obsolete.
R:  Mm.
L:  Which -- but at the same time, if you don't teach math, you don't teach people how to think, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  So it's kind of a -- 
R:  Well, they miss the general concept.
L:  Right.  Sure, they can type but that's not what we're going for.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.
R:  Mhm.  They don't even really need to memorize formulas any more.
L:  Right, they can just type everything in.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I mean, you know, I've taken classes where, you know, I think, you know, some people haven't understood, but they can still do okay because they can type things into their calculator, you know, and come up with answers that are close or whatever.
R:  Mhm, mhm, yeah, yeah.  I know it helps kids with learning disabilities, so, I actually work in a school and that's one of the things I do is, um, try to purchase software for our kids with, um, dyslexia in particular.
L:  Oh, wow, that's really interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I know my -- my mom had a student who had, um, like a muscular disorder.
R:  Ah.
L:  Um, so he couldn't write.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but they got -- actually got some computers and stuff so that he could type everything on the computer, um, so it -- it was really interesting.  They, like, got him a special keyboard and stuff --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- that the keys are really far apart so that he didn't need precise movements.  He just used more general mom- movements to type in stuff.
R:  Oh, that's really cool.
L:  Yeah, it was really interesting and, you know, -- any- anyone else would have written it off as a kid who, you know, I mean, it's too bad but he's never going to get far in life.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, you know, they're given the opportunity to show that he can, you know, write papers and he can, you know, make intelligent -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- additions to the classroom -- 
R:  And he can be -- 
L:  -- despite his disability.
R:  Yeah, and he can be -- yeah, he can be in the classroom.
L:  Right.
R:  Right, which is a big change. 
L:  He doesn't have to be in a special classroom.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, he doesn't have to be in a group of all, you know, special needs kids or whatever.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think, you know, that immersing them in the general population of computers would definitely aid that in many ways.
R:  Absolutely, absolutely.  I don't know, I don't know if they need the Internet in classrooms necessarily, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, that seems to be the big push.  It's not just to get the -- the computers in the classrooms necessarily but to get them -- them hooked up immediately.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible] everybody wants to do.
L:  I don't -- I don't necessarily see, you know, they are like oh, it's this vast information network and you can get so much -- well, I mean, not really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, you can get the information, but there's not anything on it you couldn't get by going to a library.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, I mean, it's not -- I don't really see how that enhances the learning environment.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, yeah, it's easier to do research and stuff on line than it is in a library but why not -- why do they need that in every classroom, you know? 
R:  Right, right, or else we're going to wind up with, you know, whole generations of kids who don't know how to use the library.
L:  Yeah, I mean, I already know -- knows how to use it with the Dewey Decimal system.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, like people are like card catalogue, what's a card catalogue? 
R:  [LAUGH] exactly.
L:  You know, I mean, and I mean, ten years down the road, my kids won't remember, you know.
R:  Mhm, exactly.  And that -- there's no way we're going to be able to get everything on line so there will be just volumes and volumes and volumes of information that will just be missed.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It just won't be out there.
L:  No one will bother with it any more.
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  You know, like, if I'm writing a paper and I can get, you know, these articles on line, but then these I have to go to the library and get, I'll just skip the ones I have to go get, you know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'll just use the ones on line because I don't have to go to the library.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You mean, I mean, it kind of -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know, it would almost kind of impede progress in the classroom.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  But -- 
R:  Yeah.  What about plagiarism?
L:  Yeah. I was just --
R:  We get -- we actually had a case of that originally, yeah.  What were you going to say? 
L:  I was just -- I -- I thought of that, but I'd forgotten.  Um, I mean, they make it so much easier when you can, like, pay, you know, ten bucks to download a paper --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- off the Internet and just never even have to do it.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, and it's really untraceable, you know.  I mean, how would anyone find out? 
R:  Pretty much.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.  Look, the only way we found out actually was that the kid was -- was just -- obviously not that brilliant and -- and put the site where he'd gotten the information in his bibliography. [LAUGH]
L:  And he -- yeah, checked it out and it was all right there.
R:  And there it was, yeah, but if you don't do that, I mean, no, I mean, I don't see --
