R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  I'm, I'm Tom.  
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you doing?
L:  I'm Tanya.
R:  This is great.  This is the most shiny happy topic we could have possibly been given, I think.
L:  That's right.  It's an easy topic.
R:  So, how's things with you?  We're -- I suppose we're supposed to talk about family.  You want to start, or shall we be more polite?  I don't know how this thing's supposed to work, so whatever.
L:  I mean, that's the topic, but you know, how -- this is supposed to be natural conversation -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- so whatever questions you want to ask.
R:  Yeah, you know, I don't -- I don't know.  Family's w- I, I'm not around my family right now, so it's tough for me to say.  Like sometimes they're sort of irritating, ah, which is, ah, which is why I'm in Puerto Rico, and then sometimes I miss them, which is why I go back to Saint Louis.
L:  Right.
R:  So I don't know.
L:  They know what buttons to push, you mean.  When they irritate you.
R:  Well I don't -- you know, I mean, it's just, ah, I mean, not irritate in a bad way, it's just, you know, I mean, there, there's a point in time where it's like, ah, -- oh Christ, I don't know.  They're just [MN].  They talk too much most of the time, actually.
L:  Well, certain things irritate you, I totally understand.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I had a friend, and you know, we were talking about this, and he said, you know, "I only have so many years with my mom, and the things she does drives me crazy, but I kinda overlook them, 'cause I just want to enjoy the time that I have with her".  And I kinda look at things like that when my mother's irritating me, I think, you know what, I should -- just need to back off and just relax.
R:  [LAUGH] I guess that makes sense.  My -- well, yeah.  I -- you know, for a long time I've lived with my grand- um, like, my grandma moved in with us after my grandpa died, right?
L:  Mm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And so for a long time she was around.  Like most of my growing up experience.  And so my mom was always the sister role, kind of thing.  You know, like we were always at each other's throats, and my grandma was always kind of there like, being the matronly one to both of us, and like, pleasant. [LAUGH] And my dad just kind of like stood on the sidelines and, like, watched us argue, basically.  So, um, so I don't know.  I don't know, I guess, I guess it's -- family's the big word, that's like, I don't know.  What about dogs, do dogs figure into family?
L:  Um, I think so, definitely.  Animals --
R:  Or cats, I'm sorry, I don't know, you might be a cat person --
L:  I don't have any animals --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- but I grew up around animals, so definitely it is.  I mean, look how people have relationships with their animals.  Definitely part of the family.
R:  You know they have pet health insurance, now?
L:  I'm sorry?  You have --
R:  They have health insurance for pets.
L:  Oh, I can understand that.  If you're taking --
R:  For turtles even, though.  And -- it's all right.
L:  Well, if you want to pay the money I'm sure someone's gonna take it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, think about how much -- how expensive it can be, you take your animal to the vet, and that little, you know, problem, it's expensive.
R:  I guess.  I don't know -- well down here in Puerto Rico it's really not so difficult.  You just go in and they chop them up and they give them to you still sedated, and, ah, it's not such a br- big deal.  But -- so I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  But I, I remember in the States, yeah, it's quite the, ah, quite the ordeal.  That's okay.
L:  But stas- statistically speaking people spend more money on their pets than they do their children.
R:  Are you serious?
L:  Yes.
R:  That's ridiculous.
L:  I work for a company and we had some products that were going on the market and we did some major research, and it's amazing.  I don't remember what the average cost per person, but it's more than on -- on kids, and that's including, like, daycare service for your children and that.
R:  Do you have kids?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, okay.  Do you -- are you married or anything?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, --
L:  But my -- a lot of my friends have kids.
R:  I see.  I see.  Yes, I, I have not- nothing.  I have a dog, and I have a cat, and I have two kittens that live outside our apartment that we're feeding, um, --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but the dog tries to eat them, so we have to, like, take preventative measures.  They -- they've never learned the lesson, they still try and sneak inside, and the dog still tries to eat them, and they just -- they haven't learned.  It's been, like, three weeks.
L:  That's a good thing.
R:  Yeah.  Carrying on.
L:  Well, now, what took you to Puerto Rico?
R:  Ah, well -- I'm getting my masters degree down here.
L:  Got it.  Cool.
R:  And so, and it was really cheap, you know, I mean, I priced it in the States, it's like a hundred and seventy dollars a credit, down here, right.
L:  Are you serious?
R:  Yeah, so it was like, okay, I can't turned that down.  Um, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I have my comprehensive exams tomorrow, which is why, like, I'm doing this, because I'm trying really hard not to study for them.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  Yeah, it's horrifying.  Ah, so yeah, that was basically it.  It really wasn't to get away from my rents.  I mean, we're -- you know, that's fine.  It's just like I spent -- you know, I'm twenty six and I spent, you know, whatever, twenty two years, I guess, around them, and it's just, ah, I mean, it's good to have them there, I guess, but ah, I don't know.  I mean, there's -- [MN] I'm an only child so my mother's like super -- oh, protective stuff.  So --
L:  Well, but you know, I think another thing is if you want a particular behaviour out of her or a certain -- you have to, you have to command that.  
R:  That's true, I suppose.  But at some point, you know, um --
L:  You have to get out of --
R:  -- I have to be able to wear dirty jeans if I want to.  I mean, that -- there's just, there's just certain things. [LAUGH] Like I don't want to be -- whatever.  Yeah, whatever.  I mean, she's great, I love her, but goddamn.
L:  Yeah, but she will treat you like a child -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that child parent relationship.
R:  I know.  I guess that's the thing.  That's how it works, yeah. 
L:  You never change.  But if you, you know, -- you have to be careful too, because you could be really sensitive, and then if you say the wrong thing she'll be really mad at you for a long time. [LAUGH] 
R:  I just think she needs a hobby.  That's my own personal --
L:  May- yes.  Yes.  Are all -- only child, you're gone, yeah, yeah.  Time to do something else.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, you know, I mean, she has a -- she works for the federal courts, right, like she has this, like, fairly like, -- I don't want to say important, I don't know how important it is, but it's this job that, like, keeps her fairly busy, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's, like, I don't know, she doesn't have a lot of friends, so consequently she just has to email me like seven times a day.  And it's, like, "Jesus Christ, will you stop emailing?".  It's -- and you know, it's not that I don't like to hear from her, like I -- you know, I like emailing my mom, it's all fun and good, but it's -- there's never any content.  It's always, you know, like, "Are you washing your clothes?  Are you blah".  I say, okay.
L:  [LAUGH] No, I think she has too much time on her hands.  Too much time.
R:  You wouldn't think that would be the case.  But it's all right.  My dad just retired and he's getting -- she's driving him nuts as well.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like, yeah.  I guess it's just -- I don't know, I think it's one of these cute, like, golf course things, the honeydew -- you've heard about the honeydew stuff.
L:  They honeydew list?
R:  The ho- yeah, it's like, --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  So, yeah.  So I guess that's -- I guess it's supposed to be funny or something.  I don't know.
L:  Well, you know, well.  I don't -- what can you say.  Now, is your dad enjoying your retirement?
R:  Yeah, he -- it's great.  Like, well, I mean, he's spending -- he was a public school teacher for thirty three years, in the same classroom with the same paint job, you know, and so I think anything that's not the seventh grade math classroom --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is probably A okay in his book. [LAUGH] But I read this really horrible thing, I was reading The Economist and they had an obituary from some -- I think he was an engineer.  And he had this wonderful quote where he -- he was a hundred and five, he was, like, the oldest working engineer in the world or something, he'd just passed away.  And he had this quote where it said, ah -- I watched -- this is like, "What's your key to longevity?", and he said, "Well, you know, I watched all my friends retire, and then they started playing golf, and then they started playing golf and drinking, and then they just stopped playing golf and started drinking, and then they died".  And it's like, I, I fear the same for my dad, 'cause he's starting to, like, drink Manhattans and, ah, that's got me scared, 'cause I don't want him to die, 'cause he's -- you know, you know, you don't want them to die, so.
L:  Yeah.  My mom was a teacher, she retired quite young.  Yeah, she put her thirty years in and got the heck out of there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I thought, "You know, you're too young to retire.  You need to do something".  And she was like, "No way.  I'm not going back and I'm not gonna get another job", and, ah, she's finally now -- she's of regular retirement age, but she retired at like, fifty two.
R:  Wow.  Yeah, my dad -- I think my dad retired right around fifty four or something like that.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And so how old is she now -- is she bored yet?
L:  Ah, no.  She absolutely has too much stuff going on.
R:  Are you serious?  What does she do with herself?
L:  Well, you know, she's on a few boards, and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- she has her yard, and her friends, and they, you know, travel, and so -- I -- they have a nice, ah, lifestyle.
R:  Yeah, that sounds pretty good.
L:  I'm hoping that I can live that same type of lifestyle when I --
R:  Well, you know, my grandma's eighty, and I, I, I heard that she just drove to Washington DC for some reason.  She's like -- I think she's the president of, like, the, ah -- her local chapter of the veterans of foreign wa- no, the American Legion of Auxiliary, I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so she's always putting in all these, like, you know, volunteering at the veterans' administration hospital and all this stuff, and, like, totally just has -- I think along the same lines, like, has this full social calendar and we all just don't have any idea.  She'll just wake up one day and go, like, "I'm going to Michigan", and we'll be, like, "Wait, hold, wait, how -- why are you going to Michigan?"  And like, "Oh, I've got stuff to do".  And it's like, "Okay".  So she's eighty and she drives in her little Kia up to Michigan, and --
L:  That great.
R:  -- really cute.  Yes, see we admire her greatly for that.
L:  It keeps you, keeps you young, keeps your mind active, and keeps you going.
R:  I guess so.  So, are you -- have you ever been -- I don't know, 'cause I've got a fiancee now, right.
L:  Yep.
R:  And, ah, I don't know, I think she wants kids, but, ah, [LIPSMACK] I don't know if I want kids.  Do you want kids?  Is that a mo- is that a woman thing, the kid wanting thing?
L:  I think that is a woman thing.
R:  Yeah, okay.
L:  I think it is.  And yeah, don't wait too long.  I mean --
R:  I know.  But I've always said, you know, we can adopt little Asian babies, I mean, worst case scenario.  Like there's lots of little babies out there to be had.
L:  There's not -- I don't think it's quite the same.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess I just don't get it.  I don't know.  Anything that can, like, --
L:  Oh, yes, you're not --
R:  -- you know.
L:  -- you know, in that mold. 
R:  I know, I -- well, yeah.  And she's a little bit older, she's like, thirty, yeah.
L:  That's a good time for women, between thirty and thirty five.
R:  Yeah, that's what I've heard.  So --
L:  After that you start pushing it.
R:  And you have little -- yeah.  Yeah.  You have to pay a lot of money, I think.  Her sister actually, like, had to spend, like, twenty five thousand dollars -- this insane sum of money, I forget what it was, like, to have a baby, right?
L:  Why? 
R:  I don't -- she was actually on Fox News with that one irritating guy with the, like, whose eyes are way too far apart.  I know, I don't watch Fox News either, she showed me the video tape.
L:  Sure.
R:  Um, but yeah, it was one of these irritating Fox people, and evidently the system that they used to have this expensive baby was, you know, ground breaking or what have you, and so.
L:  Oh, so it was like, -- she was having, ah, she needed medical assistance?
R:  Ah, insane amounts of medical assistance and like, I don't know -- I don't know if it was, like, a drug issue, I don't know if it was, like, a going in and, like, fixing things issue, I have -- I really don't have any idea.  All I know is that it was a lot of money, they finally had this baby, it's all fine and good, and then like, um, seven months after they had this expensive baby, like, they just happened to have, like, a free baby. [LAUGH] You know, it was just born, -- 
L:  I've heard that --
R:  -- I guess, four weeks ago or something.  So --
L:  Yeah, couples can spend, you know, ten thousand dollars a pop for in vitro and all that, I mean, so think about it, twenty thousand, maybe it's not that much. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I guess it's like, buy one get one free kind of thing, or -- I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH] yeah, that's tough.
