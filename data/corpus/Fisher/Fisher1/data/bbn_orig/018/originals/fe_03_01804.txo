L:  Hello? 
R:  Hello.
L:  I'm Brandy.
R:  You're who?
L:  Brandy.
R:  I'm Laryn[?].
L:  Hi.
R:  So we're supposed to talk about what?
L:  Um, computers in education. [NOISE]
R:  Well, I think they're good to a point.  I think they, ah, help alleviate the teachers' jobs --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- somewhat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And to a point they're detrimental.
L:  'Cause they take away pen and paper?
R:  That's right.
L:  I feel the same way.
R:  They take away --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the brains.
L:  Yep.
R:  'Cause today's kids couldn't add two and two and come up with five.
L:  Nope.  Have you ever done this before?
R:  Have I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- done what we're doing now?
L:  Yeah.
R:  No.
L:  Oh, okay.  Me either, so.  Um, did you get a chance to use a computer in school?
R:  Ah, there weren't any such things when I went to school.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, I got to use them when I was in school, but they weren't as sophisticated as they are now. [NOISE] And ...
R:  Well, my first, ah, experience with any type of a computer was when I was in the military and I was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a radio teletype operator.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  That's going way back.
L:  My daughter is in the second grade, and she uses a computer at school, [NOISE] and she likes it because she gets to play on the computer there.  She don't get to play on one here.
R:  Well, I have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I have nieces and nephews that are a lot more literate than what I am.
L:  Yeah.
R:  All I have done is just to teach it by myself.
L:  Well, we have [NOISE] an internet, or that we have the internet, but it's not that, um, -- my daughter don't get to play on it.  I don't think little kids [NOISE] should be on it.  So ...
R:  Well, they teach it to them in school though.
L:  Yeah.  But they can get on them and get into [NOISE] places that they don't need to be on.  And so I don't think -- I'm just worried about her getting on to a real bad site though talking to people she don't need to be talking to.  And so [NOISE] --
R:  Well, there are --
L:  -- but she's only -- huh?
R:  -- there are programs which you can get which you can regulate --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what your child can get into and can not get into.
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] but kids are getting smarter and they can get past those things.  And figure out passwords to be able to -- like she could get in [NOISE] there and get my password and get on through me, and go anywhere on the internet.  And -- but she's only eight.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think -- [NOISE] maybe in a few years we might set her up her own little thing with all the regulation.  But, I don't know.  I know some kids, like [NOISE] kids that are autistic and stuff, um, I've got a brother in law that's in the fifth grade and he's autistic, and he learns a lot from using a computer.  Um, [NOISE] but he can't stand for a teacher to stand there and tell him what to do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But if they put the computer in front of him and program, um, a game or something to tell him what to do, he'll do it [NOISE] without any problem.
R:  Well, well that's a good point.
L:  Oh, yeah.  He, he's very touchy when it comes to people telling him what to do.  But he likes to play games and [NOISE] stuff on the computer and -- so I guess it's got their good points and got their bad points somewhere.
R:  Well yeah, because it, it doesn't make them use their --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- brains to, to look.  Of course they have more, ah, references available to them.
L:  Oh yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So for kids that are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the remote areas, that's good.
L:  Yeah, but when you live three miles from a library it's bad.
R:  Well yeah, but when you're eight -- only eight years old, three miles is a long way.
L:  Oh, yeah.  But I don't work, so if [NOISE] she needs to go to the library any time I'll take her.  And -- but like, when I was a kid, we used encyclopedias, and -- I don't know.  [NOISE] I don't know.
R:  Well, I don't know.  Maybe they'll come up some day where --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you'll just have a press of a button or something and you can get your answers.  How long are we supposed to be talking?
L:  I think [NOISE] ten minutes.
R:  Oh, Lord.
L:  And they're recording it too, so ...
R:  Well ...
L:  We're gonna make for a good listen.  [NOISE] I don't even remember signing up for this, so ...
R:  Well, I signed up for it, a friend of mine emailed me and told me she thought that I would enjoy doing this course.  I enjoy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- doing surveys.
L:  Yeah, I do too.  Um, I like to sit down and either -- I've had some sent to me and I've done some on the internet.  And I haven't done a [NOISE] phone one yet.  But ... you sound like you're from the north.
R:  From the north?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm from Iowa.
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] you're from the north.  I'm from Alabama.
R:  Mm.
L:  So ... but, I don't know.  Probably [NOISE] here in a few years they won't have any books in school, they'll just have computers.
R:  Well, I don't know.  They've --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they've come up with a new thing where they don't have to cut trees down now to make paper, so --
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's cool. [NOISE]
R:  But, but they'll come up with something.
L:  Yeah.  I know you -- um, we can access our local, um, like the books and stuff on the [NOISE] internet from the library.  Um, I got something sent home from school saying that we can log into the library and check out virtual books.
R:  Yeah, I think we --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- can, we can do that somehow.  I think --
L:  Well I think --
R:  -- I think, I think we're entitled to, ah, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- connect to our library here.
L:  I thought that that was kinda [NOISE] neat.  Although, there's -- they don't have all the books in the library on it yet.  So you can only check out a few.  But I've got some [NOISE] family members that live, like, out in the boonies, um, in the very far back woods, and they don't have a library close to them, and, and I have them my number [NOISE] on my card so that they could let their kids get into the library.  And they thought that that was neat.
R:  Well, that's where computers come in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- good on that part.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause their library's like sixty miles from them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They live out in the back woods.  And they --
R:  Well, they can --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- download books too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Off the internet.
L:  Yeah.  If you've got the capabilities and the soft -- the hard drive and the memory -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then you can do that.  But ... [NOISE] um, I don't know.  I kinda [NOISE] wish when I was in school that we would of had more on the internet.  'Cause I didn't like studying, I didn't like reading books -- then, I do now. 
R:  Well, I've always enjoyed reading books.
L:  [NOISE] But ... and I've helped my daughter look up stuff on the internet, um, for like science projects and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, [NOISE] and she enjoys that.  But she enjoys going to the library and getting books from there.
R:  Well that's good.
L:  And -- oh, yeah.  She likes [NOISE] to learn.  I'm blessed there.  But I don't know.
R:  Yeah, I have a seven year old niece that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- enjoys school. 
L:  That's a blessing.
R:  And she -- I'm sure she knows how to use the computer, I don't know if her folks ever
