R:  Hello.  Um, this is Toni Mae[?] King.  Um, I'm a student at the university of Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH]  You're going to know good on this subject.  Ah, I'm Karen Maguire, [NOISE] and, um, I'm in Florida.
R:  You're in Florida? 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  Where are you? 
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  Where are you?   
R:  Um, I'm in Philly.
L:  Where's that? 
R:  Where's Phill- -- Philadelphia? 
L:  Oh, in Philadelphia, I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you. [NOISE]  
R:  Oh.  That's all right. 
L:  All right.  So, ah, --
R:  Well, um, um, what is it?  Computers in education?
L:  Right, and I -- I bet you're going to be good at this 'cause you go to school, but go ahead. [NOISE] 
R:  Um, well, I have good things and bad things to say about computers, I guess, in education.  Um, for me it's a wonderful thing because -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- basically my entirely life is centered around, um, you know, internet and I do -- I'm using raising on the -- on the computer some papers to research to sometimes classes.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So, um, I think, um, computers facilitate, um, education, um, and, you know, the negative sense I guess, um, because of the extensive use of computers, um, there is not so much of -- of a hands on learning.  Like, I don't go to the library as much because I can get my books at -- I mean, I can research on the computer, you know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  [MN]  What do you think?
L:  Well, I think it's very good, very good what you said.  [NOISE]  Um, I think it's excellent.  I think it is an excellent tool.  I think that [NOISE] our kids are just so much smarter from it because, ah, they're so --
R:  You think they get smarter?
L:  Oh, yeah, 'cause I think there is just so much at their fingertips to, ah, --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know, access, ah, [NOISE] to learn so many good programs [NOISE] and, um, I think it is very helpful.  But on the other hand some of -- on the computer can be very dangerous to our children.
R:  Right.
L:  And even to adults because there is just too much wrong stuff there, too.
R:  Right.
L:  Things that they shouldn't be able to, you know, [NOISE] see.
R:  To access.
L:  Right, and that's why I, you know, don't like some of it, so ...
R:  So overall would you be against, um, computers in learning or would you be for it?
L:  No, I -- I -- I would be definitely for it but if it really came right down to kids I think it should be, like, chaperoned sort of thing. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE]  You know, it should be blocked.  I think it should be blocked, definitely blocked on the computer.
R:  Yeah, but the -- the -- the thing about blocking is [NOISE] -- oh, so you mean so parents should be responsible for what --
L:  Right.
R:  -- their kids --
L:  Right, right, but I think it is an excellent tool and I think it has made our kids so much more aware and smarter [MN] and I don't know where today we'd be without them really, [LAUGH] --
R:  You know, I --
L:  -- because we've all become so accustomed to them, you know, it's like, "Wow, where would I be", you know?
R:  Yeah, I would have to ag- -- agree -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- with you because I really don't -- like, just personally I don't -- like, the first thing I do when I get up is go on the computer and, you know, check my email, check my assignments.
L:  Me too.
R:  Whatever, you know.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  I -- I send papers to my professors through email.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, I don't even have to go to class.  I just, you know, send it to them.
L:  [inaudible] [NOISE] 
R:  So in that sense it's really helped me a lot, but in the other sense why don't I just get up and walk to class and, you know, give it to my teacher myself? You know, so, um, -- 
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  But I -- I think it would save time, you know, and -- and give us sort of like a -- like a freedom in that way, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  And it is just so convenient.
R:  It's -- it's very -- 
L:  So convenient.
R:  It's -- it's very convenient, it's extremely convenient. I would have to agree with you on that, yeah, so, um, --
L:  Right again.  And also it has a -- a -- like a world out there of anything you'd want.
R:  It has -- it has -- it has what?
L:  You know, I mean, a world out there of anything you would want to learn.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I mean, you can even see where you can take classes on the internet.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, you know, ah, there's all kinds of things that it offers.
R:  Right.
L:  And, ah, you know, even, like, into cooking, because, you know, I'd be into cooking, you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  Oh, my goodness, it's endless. [NOISE]  And I'm also a crafter, and so it is endless which you can, you know, learn.  They even tell you how to make crafts on the internet. Ah, --
R:  Right.  You can learn everything on the internet.
L:  Yeah.  So that -- that, I think is -- is -- I think it just makes everybody smarter.
R:  Yeah.  It -- it -- it -- [NOISE] I think it does or like -- and then like you were saying, though, [NOISE] there's a lot of things on the internet that -- [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm, make you -- yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, make you --
L:  Make -- make somebody too smart that don't need to know some of that stuff, right?
R:  Exactly.  Like, you know, -- 
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- five year -- not five but even -- even high school kids, things that they are exposed to that really, you know, they --
L:  Right, just --
R:  -- don't need to be exposed to.
L:  Right.  Like -- like, for me I do have a block on my -- my internet. [NOISE]  
R:  Okay.
L:  I have a Christian internet.
R:  Okay.
L:  And it is called seven eleven online.
R:  Okay.
L:  And we don't have to deal with the pop up things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which I hate them things because I've been on, you know, the regular internet and sometimes they pop up and they are very bad.  And so our kids would be sitting there, you know, and something pop up, I mean they are not even doing anything wrong and yet they are going to see it, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- there could be a danger in the chat room thing too, ah, which wouldn't be too cool [NOISE] for them to be, you know, there with that.
R:  Right.  Right.  Exactly.
L:  So, like I say, I-- I just think it should be filtered. [LAUGH]  There is no other way.
R:  Yeah, yeah. 
L:  You know, there's just no other way. I mean, I -- I --
R:  Yeah, and anoth- another thing that I think -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- is, um, that it should be, although it is more widespread in the US, I think that, you know, there are certain populations and certain people who don't have any access to, you know, computer access.
L:  Right, right. 
R:  And this is very detrimental to their development, you know, as, um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, citizens, because, you know, as the world gets more, you know, you know, more, what do you call it technolo- -- you know, technology based.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Um, people who don't have any, um, any, you know, command over the internet would be at a very, you know, large disadvantage --
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  -- to people who have, you know, grown up in a school system -- 
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  -- where, you know, internet --
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- or not only internet, but just computer use is -- it's very wide spread.
L:  That's right. [NOISE]
R:  So, um, I think --
L:  But I find it's -- go ahead, I'm sorry.
R:  No, sorry, continue.
L:  Go right ahead.  No, go ahead.  Go ahead [inaudible] finish.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, so I think, you know, that, you know, we have a long way to go in terms of kind of equalizing the distribution of, you know -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- computer access.  
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  Because there's just -- I just think it's very unfortunate that some people, you know, don't -- don't know how to use --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a computer 'cause when they go to get jobs or when they go to --
L:  Oh, forget it, mhm.
R:  -- you know, apply for college or whatever.
L:  Mhm, mhm, mhm.
R:  Yeah, it's going -- they're not going to have that upper hand and --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- and it's -- you know, even if they are very bright and even if they are, you know, smart --
L:  Right, right.  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- you know, a lot of times, like, you know, in applying for different programs or whatever they will ask you, like, what's your, you know, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, how good are you using, like, certain computer programs -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- or, you know, and --
L:  You can't even go be a waiter without knowing how to do the computer.
R:  Ba- -- exactly.  Basically.
L:  I mean, ev- even -- even a cashier any more without knowing how to do the computer because everything is computer.
R:  Exactly.  So it's [NOISE] -- it's a very big part of our, ah, society and, um, -- 
L:  Right, but then I find out the -- the older generation they are afraid of it, they don't really know anything about it. [NOISE]  They stay away from it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, they are just not even interested in it.  They just think, "Oh, --"
R:  Right.
L:  -- all this technology", and they don't even, you know, [NOISE] so I think --"
R:  Right, because, I mean, 'cause they went through it to their entire schooling, their entire education.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  With no -- no kind of, you know, computer at all.
L:  That's right.
R:  Everything had to be handwritten, if not typed --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- typewritten and either --
L:  [MN] And they don't know how to use it and they don't even want to learn. [LAUGH] 
R:  They don't.  
L:  Nope. 
R:  Because they are kind of, you know, trying -- very against this whole --
L:  Right, mhm, mhm.
R:  -- you know, computerized world which in a way I can see, you know, where they are going.
L:  Right.
R:  Because if everything is on the computer then, you know, what else is left out there? 
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  You know, like, but --
L:  But again, like you said, if you don't learn it or if you don't know it as -- as a young person -- 
R:  Exac- -- that's -- that's the second -- exactly.
L:  -- you don't stand a chance in this world any more. [LAUGH] 
R:  You don't, so ... 
L:  At least people around here.
R:  So you really don't have a choice. 
L:  That's right.
R:  Really but, I mean, you know -- I mean, some people don't have a choice [NOISE] and they can't use it 'cause they don't have it but, I mean, you know, if you want to be anything and do anything.
L:  Well, I think they even teach little kindergarteners, ah, the computer.  I think they start off that young in schools, teaching them, ah, how to use it.
R:  Oh, really?  I don't know much about, um, [NOISE] about, um, lower -- lower classes and their use of compute- -- actually, yes, I do because, like, now, like I know that even before kids start going to school parents get, you know, --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know, these computer programs --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that teach them, you know, how to --  how to read.
L:  Them Abc's and all that stuff.
R:  Exactly, colors and all those things. 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah, it's a great tool.  It's a great tool.
R:  So from very early on they're already, you know, -- 
L:  Mhm, smart.
R:  And pl- -- exactly. They're already [inaudible] 
L:  And it's so amazing some of these kids --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I was in a furniture store once and there was this little boy.  I'd say he must have been about, I don't know, six or seven I'd say.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He's doing this video game on this computer because they had it for kids to, you know, waste time and be good or whatever.
R:  Right.
L:  And he was doing [LAUGH] so good and I just stopped and I looked at the little boy and I thought, "Man, you're good".  He goes, "Oh, yeah, I can kill this and I can do that", or whatever they were doing and --
