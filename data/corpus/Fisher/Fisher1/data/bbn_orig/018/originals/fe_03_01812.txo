L:  Hi.  I'm Dietta[?].
R:  Hi.  I'm Amy. 
L:  Hi, Amy.
R:  How are you?  
L:  Just fine.
R:  Good.
L:  Are -- are you, uh, familiar with ed- education, computers and education? [LAUGH]
R:  Um, well, I did all my, uh, research papers on computers and stuff -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- did a lot of research, uh, on computers.  I think computers are good. [SIGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  Personally. [SIGH]
L:  In -- in the education, uh, system?
R:  Well, I've only -- you know, I'm -- I'm thirty, so I only use computers in hi- -- in college pretty much, you know.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  I'm too [MN] -- I'm not young enough to have used them elsewhere.  How about you?
L:  No, way past that.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  In fact, we didn't even have them when I went to college. [LAUGH]
R:  Exa- -- yeah.  I mean, I know like my son who is a year and a half he already is interested in the computer.
L:  Yes.  Yeah.  I think -- 
R:  Amazing.
L:  -- I -- I really believe that computers can be a real asset but I think we have to be careful not to let them replace, um, the -- 
R:  People.
L:  -- one on one contact --
R:  Oh, I agree.
L:  -- and the interaction.
R:  I do agree with you there.
L:  Because I think that's where part of our whole social issues are coming from, is that we're not -- we're not used to having our kids interact with people.
R:  Oh, I agree, too.  It's like, you know, people spend too much time either playing video games or watching TV or -- 
L:  Right. 
R:  -- staring at too many little boxes, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, and then they don't learn just even regular social graces.
R:  Exactly.  You do have to learn how to get along with other people.  That's, uh, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's as important as learning how to program your computer or -- or -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- research things on line or whatever.
L:  Yeah.  Well, and those are pretty easy to learn, really. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  Those are good things to learn but they're not the -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- be all and end all of the ... [LAUGH]
L:  And I know on, uh, some of the chat rooms and different things, forums that you go to, I mean people, they don't even know how to spell, they don't know how to phrase things so that it's not offensive and those are basics that you can learn.
R:  I agree.  It's kind of scary when you read things that people write and you're like, " [MN] can't you -- can't you spell --" 
L:  Wow.
R:  "-- a simple word?" [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I have read notices that I didn't even understand what they were trying to say, [LAUGH] you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the way it was phrased.
R:  I know what you mean.
L:  But I -- I have -- I used to be on a local school board, so -- 
R:  Oh, wow. 
L:  -- we had a lot of issues about around computers and I think we -- our school district was not real good at integrating the computer or the access to the computers in all of the different classes.  Um, I think we make a big mistake by saying, "Okay, you're going to have, you know, an hour, an hour and a half of computers" -- 
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- but you need to help that student integrate those into the other classes and our school district wasn't able to do that.  We didn't -- couldn't afford it.
R:  Yeah. [inaudible] There's a lot of money, you know, issues.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I know.  My son is not in school yet so I haven't had to deal with that, I've only -- 
L:  You'll learn. [LAUGH]
R:  God, I don't even want to think about it.  I haven't had to even think about it yet, but I don't --
L:  Yeah.  Well, what we found was that a lot of the issues was that the teacher, it's -- [inaudible] you know, the older teachers especially and some of the younger ones were not familiar enough and were not trained in their education to become teachers to utilize the computer within their curriculum that they set up.
R:  Yeah, that's hard if, you know -- because kids a lot of times know more than you when you're older -- 
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- about computers, you know.
L:  Well, they -- they have access to too much information and I think one of the things we need to teach our kids is -- is that everything that's on -- on the internet is not fact. [LAUGH] And --
R:  No, I know.  Actually, so much of it isn't.  So much is just [LAUGH] --
L:  Right, and they have to be very careful because I know we have kids that will, you know, show up with a report that they have taken from a bogus site that had a diff- -- you know, a whole -- not a reality base. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's -- that's definitely not good.
L:  No.
R:  I think you definitely have to balance them, like actually going to the library, too, and looking at actual, physical books.
L:  Oh, I know.  I know, but [MN] it -- 
R:  But then there's stuff that you can only find on the com- -- you know, especially like, I went to school in Montana so it was definitely nice because we didn't have the world's best library.
L:  Yes.  Well, where I live right now we don't even have a library system.
R:  Oh, wow! 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yes, I didn't, you know -- 
L:  That -- yeah, that's the internet's --
R:  That makes it hard.
L:  -- my access to any information, um, -- 
R:  Sure.
L:  -- and we only get, um, um, weekend delivery paper delivery because I live way out in the country -- 
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and they just don't -- so you -- you know, if I didn't have the TV and the internet I would have no access to current information. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Like what's going on? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I mean really.
R:  Totally.
L:  So, well, the other advantage is that -- I mean the computer system is expensive and to keep it upgraded and all of that, but I [MN] -- also the encyclopedias that we used -- sets we used to have to buy [MN] were expensive. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, God, they were so obsolete, like, in five minutes, too -- 
L:  Yeah, and y- -- 
R:  -- and don't they cost, like, one million dollars.
L:  Well, they were very expensive at the time -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and -- and compared I haven't even -- I imagine there are -- I -- I don't even know if they sell them any more, except to schools or institutions.
R:  Yeah, I think just to libraries and things.
L:  Yeah, because I certainly wouldn't invest in one, a -- a set of encyclopedias because we've got -- 
R:  No, because they're just not -- you know, as soon as they print them they're wrong. [SIGH]
L:  Well, they were -- yeah. 
R:  Stuff is changing so much.
L:  Right, they were out the date before we got them, [LAUGH] so, but I think in education we have to be real careful in -- in supplying not just computer literacy.
R:  Yeah, I think that it's good to take advantage of the things computers can do for you, but not to think that, you know, it replaces other things.
L:  Right, especially social graces of some sort.
R:  Yeah, people definitely -- 
L:  That's what I -- that's what I see in a lot of the teenagers, they just do not know how to --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- handle a -- an irate situation, you know, or a confron- confrontation of any kind, other than just the computer game response of bapping[?], [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Yeah, give you a smack.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  It's like, "No, that's not the best way to handle things, actually".
L:  Yeah, well, it -- it makes it pretty difficult to deal with someone like that.
R:  I know.  I told my -- I told my husband -- he plays some computers games that are a little bit violent.  I'm like, "You know, if our son is in the room I really don't want you to play those games". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, right. [LAUGH]
R:  "You know, that's really not the best, uh, thing for him to be learning".
L:  Well, it -- it just -- it makes it too easy, it's just like anything else, that even if you, you know, focus on something that -- that is, um, bad, or -- or not with really the way you should be thinking, then that's the way you are going to react in a situation, because you've thought that through and it's ingrained in you and those computer games do that.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  That's --
L:  You know, they just keep it there and -- 
R:  There's definitely some better things to ingrain in people than [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Well -- 
R:  -- "Oh, let's just shoot everybody" and all that kind of stuff.
L:  And that's looks like what's happening a lot, but -- but part of that I think goes back to the fact that we're not, in our state anyway, we don't fund our education the way we should, you know.  We demand --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Actually, where we live in Washington we, uh, we had our school, uh -- uh, where I live in Issaquah[?], they had the school start, like, two weeks late because all the teachers were striking.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They're, like, the lowest paid teachers in the whole state and it's, like, one of the most expensive districts to live in. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And having teachers who are -- who can't afford to put their kids -- their kids are, like, on the free school lunch program -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- because they can't afford to buy food for their own kids. [MN]
L:  So -- so you have a great, um, -- 
R:  That's not right, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, but at least there's a process to provide them some food, with --
R:  Yeah, well, that -- it -- it's good they have that, but it's just -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I mean they had teachers who were trying to strike and we actually had parents who were going and -- and marching against the teachers saying, you know, "We're sorry about your raise and all, but we don't want to have our kids home, you're like inconveniencing", you know, "We -- we work at Microsoft".
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Well --
R:  We have [inaudible] at work.
L:  [LAUGH].  I don't know.  The --
R:  Kind of scary.
L:  The [MN] -- it's -- it's just not a good system. [LAUGH]
R:  No, they need to do something with it, although -- 
L:  Well, a part of it I think is -- is coming about and you live in Washington state, I take it.  I do --
R:  Yes, so actually we probably have more computers than most people because Bill Gates, you know, that's what he does.
L:  Well, I live in Washington State, too. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Oh, you're in Washington.  It seems like ev- everybody I talk to -- talk to so far is in Washington.
L:  Is that right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, probably because we're so ingrained with computers and react to notices. [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, that's probably -- that's probably true.
L:  Yeah, so ... but -- 
R:  Everyone here has a computer.
L:  You know, I -- I am amazed, though, that a lot of them do not.
R:  Hm.
L:  How many people do not have one and are not interested in -- in -- in it at all, even people that [MN] younger people, you know, that had them in school and that kind of stuff.
R:  Oh.  Nearly everybody I know has a computer, like everyone. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, uh, I know most people have them but they don't utilize them, you know.  I sent an email to my niece that's over on the coast and she has computer systems and the whole bit -- 
R:  Ah.
L:  -- but I -- she doesn't check her email but probably twice a month. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow.  
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  I tell half of my friends, I don't even talk to them except by email, like, or in person, you know.
L:  I -- yeah. [MN] Right.
R:  The telephone is kind of obsolete these days, you know.
L:  Well, and I was amazed that I even agreed to do this because I'm not a telephone talker.  I --
R:  Yeah.
