L:  Hi, this is Betsy.
R:  Hi, Betsy.  My name is Tonia.  
L:  How are you doing?
R:  Okay.  Is this the first time --
L:  This is kind of cool.  [LAUGH]
R:  Is this the first time you've done this?
L:  Yeah, you 
R:  Me too.
L:   how about you?  You too?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Cool!
R:  Yeah  uh --
L:  A friend of mine did it this morning.  
R:  Oh, 
L:   so, I knew what it was all about 
R:  Yeah.  My friend just emailed me, um, last night, so  she said it was legitimate, so  I thought, "Oh, interesting!"
L:  Great! So, 
R:  Where  where are you at?
L:   so, what does family mean to you?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I guess we're not supposed to talk to each other, we're supposed to talk about the 
L:  Right.
R:   subject.  Um, 
L:   'cause if we don't, we don't get credit.
R:  Uh, right.  Exactly.  Well, um, what family means to me is, um, [MN] people that help you out, they're there for you, you're there for them, um, 
L:  Yeah, to me it doesn't mean, whether you're blood related, in -- in my mind, it's you know, who's there at all times.
R:  Right.  'Cause we have [MN] people in our family, I mean, people that have been, like, remarried, and you have, like, stepkids, or -- but we have, like, relatives that I don't even know how we're related, but 
L:  Yeah, exactly.  
R:   technically, we're related, but  [LAUGH] [MN].
L:  Yeah, I mean, 
R:  But, um, 
L:   I consider family, you know, whoever is there for me or whoever I'm there for no matter if they're blood or not 
R:  Right.
L:   um, just whether  they're really good friends, they're family.
R:  And more specifically, I guess, um, you know, the people you come home to every day.  The people that see you at your worst 
L:  Yep.
R:   and your best, and the people that you tell things to that you wouldn't tell anybody else [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.
R:   ask for help with your problems, and 
L:  Exactly, and, of course, my daughter.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  Got to include this one, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- she [LAUGH]  even though she is thousands of miles away from me, she will always be family.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Oh, yeah, she's off in college.
R:  Oh, wow.  See, my kids are younger, so, um, you know 
L:  Lucky.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  uh, usually I'm saying they're older because a lot of people that I talk with have, you know, babies, and things and, um, 
L:  Yeah, my baby's twenty one. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] well, my baby's nine, and my other baby's fourteen.  So, 
L:  Oh, 
R:   I -- I'm getting there, but yeah, they're still  they're still home.  
L:  Yeah, but I mean, I'm like, my house tournament's online.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, and, to me, most of the people that I meet there, a lot of them are family.  I mean, there've been times when  one of the girls got stuck in South America and we all think of her, she calls me big sis, and we all got together and got her money to get out of there.
R:  Wow.
L:  That's the way everybody was, --
R:  That's great.
L:   when my fiance had a heart attack, they all sent  sent us money.  It was unbelievable, I mean, everybody takes care of everybody else, and to me, that's family.
R:  Oh, yeah, 'cause you can have family members, of which I actually have one, that is not there for you, and this is, 
L:  Oh, yeah! So do I.
R:    this is close family.
L:  Yeah, I mean 
R:   you know, that just uses you for things so 
L:  Yeah, I got, you know, 
R:  [SIGH]
L:   the rest of my quote unquote real family is like that and so, you know, to me, that's nothing, but to -- to me, the [MN] -- the family is where your heart is, that's really what it's -- what it's at.
R:  Definitely.
L:  You know?
R:  So ten minutes is a long time.
L:  I know!  [LAUGH] 
R: [LAUGH] So is that, that all we're supposed to talk about, what family means to us?
L:  I guess 
R:   or 
L:   so, that's what they told  that's what I heard on the r- -- on the robot.
R:  Okay, yeah, hm, --
L:  You know.
R:  -- 'cause I was on hold, I guess, did you come right on?  I was on hold, and then they brought you on.
L:  Um, well, th- they asked me a whole bunch of questions and then they brought me right on, --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:   asked me what kind of phone I was using, and 
R:  Right, right.  Yeah, I did that too.
L:  Yeah 
R:  Interesting.
L:  But, um, 
R:  So.
L:  Well, anyway, I guess we have talked about family.
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't know really how much 
L:  Well, my animals are family!
R:  Well, that's true 
L:  You know 
R:  -- I have two cats, so.
L:  Oh, I've got my cat.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:   and my ex fiance took custody of the dog, but she's still my family.
R:  [LAUGH] and my cats actually  they actually act like my kids, too, because one minute they are getting along and they're friendly and loving, the next minute they're, like, fighting and meowing at each other  [LAUGH]
L:  Of course!
R:   I mean, they act just like kids.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, they do.
R:  Except for one thing different, when -- when I come home, if my kids are home first, and I come home, um, you know my younger one might say, "Hey, mom, how are you?", my older one, nothing, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But my cat 
L:  But your cat is always there.
R:   yeah.  Running to the door, "Meow, mommy, mommy!" [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  See, I'm glad somebody loves me still.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I can -- can definitely hear them recording.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Keep getting little blips.
R:  So I guess they're going to use this 
L:  [COUGH]
R:   for some sort of class or something.
L:  Yeah, I guess it's Penn State, ah, it seems like it's a Penn State site 
R:  Yeah.
L:   um, which is good  that's where I'm at.  I'm in 
R:  Oh, really?
L:   Pennsylvania, yeah.
R:  I'm in Maryland.
L:  Ah! So what they, I guess, what they do, you know, they, they see how strangers, can communicate with each other, I guess.
R:  Yeah, pretty good, I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, I like it, I think it's interesting.
R:  I was wondering what the topic's going to be about.  I sa- -- I thought, "Oh, my gosh, well, you can always refuse", but I thought, "Gosh 
L:  Yeah.
R:   I-I hope I don't get these calls that have to do with some topic I have no idea anything about".  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, exactly, you know, I mean, so far, so good.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] yeah, so, so, so where, where is your family today?  What's going on with 
L:  What's going on?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Let's see.  My cat's sleeping, 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:   ah, my daughter 
R:  Gee, imagine that.  [LAUGH]
L:   was that you?
R:  Yeah, I said, imagine that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.  Um, my daughter's off at school, and, um, that's about it that's around here now.
R:  Well, well, I  I just got home from work, I work part time 
R:  Mm.
R:   um, so I just got home from work, and my husband's at work, my son just got off the bus, but my daughter I have to go pick up soon, I was, like, "Well, I'm glad this call came when it did and not a little bit later, because I got to go and, ah, pick her up from school from 
L:  Yeah, I --
R:   one meeting".
L:  -- put down between four and eight, and, boy, they called right on the dot.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, I put, 
L:  [MN]
R:   I put different time, I put I could be called at four and then I put, like, t- -- nine or ten tonight, because I have to go pick her up at school from one 
L:  [MN]
R:   thing, and I got to get all her softball stuff collected and take her to her softball game.
L:  Ah.
R:   so, that's family, running around constantly.
L:  Exactly.
R:  That comes first.  
L:  Mommy's taxi service.
R:  Yes, that comes first [LAUGH]
L:  I had a sign for my car that said that.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  My daughter bought it for me for my Mother's Day present one year 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:   Mommy's Taxi Service.
R:  That's true.  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  If it's some  especially some seasons, I mean, especially this season, spring is the worst, because every single night except Friday night  one of them, -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:   one of them has either soccer or softball, and then, on the weekends too.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well, we're going to have added members to the family here.  My roommate has a female cat, and mine was an all male cat when I fir- -- when I first moved here, and 
R:  Mhm.
L:   we're going to have kittens any day now.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Oh, so they got together, huh?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yes.  [LAUGH] I can't wait, I want -- I wanted to have a baby for my baby.
R:  Oh, that's so cute!
L:  Yeah, and hopefully 
R:  Well, see, my cats are fixed, [MN] I got two girl cats, and they're also declawed, so they don't 
L:  So they're not  
R:  -- well, they're not supposed to go out.
L:   he's already declawed, my isn't.
R:  Right.  And mine thinks he's a dog.
R:  [LAUGH] I think my little one thinks that, too, because she eats anything.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, anything.  She tries to get in your plate, in your bowl, whatever you're having, she doesn't care, she's crazy.
L:  Oh, that's wild.
R:  [LAUGH] The older one, she's pretty laid back, she's your basic cat, you know, she's kind of snobby, and she sleeps a lot  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. Yeah.
R:  Well, she's cool.
L:  Well, right now, my online family is -- you see, I hurt my back at work, and so, they're all, um, I'm getting more ICQ's, emails, phone calls from everybody, if I'm not --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:   online  this is the way that family is to me.  If I'm not online, for more than a week, I get phone calls from everywhere, from Australia 
R:  Really?  Ah, --
L:   to Hawaii, people worrying about me, --
R:  Oh, my gosh.  
L:   whether I'm alive or not:  Are you okay?
R:  Now see, I -- yeah, I could spend all day on the computer, but I got to go to work 
L:  Mhm.
R:   but, um, but, yeah, I was actually, that's what I was doing when this call came in, was going through my email, and there's so many, and, and I hate not to read 'em, but sometimes you just don't have time 
L:  Oh, I know.
R:   I mean, you know, I mean, that could be, that could take up your whole day, just reading all the 
L:  Well, if it wasn't 
R:  -- communications.
L:   for my computer, I don't know how I would talk to my daughter 
R:  Well, that's a good thing.
L:   'cause I couldn't afford to call Arizona all the time 
R:  Yeah, really.
L:   but we're talk- -- we talk constantly on here, on the computer, all the time.
R:  Yeah, that- that's a good thing, that's one good thing about having it.
L:  Oh, yeah, like 
R:  Sometimes there's just too much information, now, and I'm on it every single day, at 
L:  So am I.
R:   work and at home, so.
L:  Oh, you're at work, on it at work?  Now that's what I --
R:  No, I'm not at work now I just got home, but 
L:  Ah.
R:   but yeah, I mean, it's just, like, it's so much information, I mean, I go to college too, and then, when I'm trying to do something, it can never be concise, you know, I mean, yeah, it's nice not having to go out to the library, so I shouldn't be  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:   I should be grateful, but at the same time, um, you know, I -- it's just so much information, you could be there forever searching and searching, but -- but another good thing about having family online [LAUGH] or friends that are family is, I have a friend that does home schooling, 
L:  Mhm.
R:   actually, she's the one that told me about this thing, um, and so, she has to look up a lot of information for her children, you know, for teaching them 
L:  Right.
R:   different things  
L:  I did that with my daughter.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I did home schooling, yeah.
R:  Oh, wow.  See, I didn't do that, but I had, um, you know, my son had this thing to do, and I'm, like, searching on the internet, and I can't find what I want, you know, I just wasn't having much luck, and it was really stressing me out, and --
L:  Mhm?
R:   and then, ah, you know, I happened to mention it to my friend, you know, just saying, "Oh, my gosh, I got to do this", and la du da du da, and --
L:  -- it took her thirty seconds.
R:   and yeah, she's, like, "Oh, here, let me email you this", and she gives me this link, and it had all these things about science projects, it was 
L:  Mhm?
R:   grade appropriate, and, ah, it was so awesome, I was, like, "Oh, my gosh, you made my day.  You made my week!" [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:   because I could have been on there forever searching for that.  I think that some of the stuff that they have these kids do today is just unbelievable.
L:  Really, I mean 
R:  What's that beeping?  Is that you?
L:  That's me 
R:  Oh! [LAUGH]
L:   that's my daughter. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  Speaking of daughters 
R:  I thought it was, like, the 
L:  No.  That's my, that's, that's 
R:  -- thing. [LAUGH]
L:   my instant messenger, it's knocking, it's my daughter just, I see, wanted to know how I was feeling. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, see?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:   the perfect example.
L:  Yes, [SIGH] I mean, um, like I said, if it wasn't for this, I mean, I don't know how I would have been able to afford to talk to her.
R:  Yeah. 'Cause that could add up really quick.
L:  I've got my brother online, I've got my nephews on line, my father who are all  we're all over the United States.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  So, it's like, this is --
R:  You remember that stuff they had going around not long ago, about how they were going to
