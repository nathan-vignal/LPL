L:  Well my, um, my parents are kind of close by, so -- 
R:  That's great.
L:  -- we do a few things with them, and my two sisters, and yeah, so.
R:  Very good.  Unfortunate, my, my mom's grandparents always kind of lived close, like we were always like an hour away from them, but my dad's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- parents live in Greece, so --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- we only get to see them once every few years.
L:  Oh, wow, that's interesting.

L:  Stay close.  Keep in touch.
R:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um.  Do you, when, do you have any, let's see, like, carried over traditions from when you were a child that you're doing with your family now that you have one?
L:  Oh, yeah, well, like, Easter, um, you know, we just hid the eggs and Easter baskets and --
R:  Oh, you hide the Easter baskets too?
L:  -- it was really cool.
L:  Yes.  Oh, yeah.

L:  Yes.
R:  Like they're the hardest thing to find.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right now, since they're still kind of little, we kind of, you know, we hide them in kind of obvious places.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Nice.  Do you dye eggs, or do you ...
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Right. 
L:  Yeah.  You know, I haven't done that in a long time, too.  [LAUGH] You know when we were little, that was kind of like a family tradition.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, yeah.  Girls love that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Keep that going. [LAUGH] Yeah.  You know, just getting together with, you know, grandparents, is another thing we did for holiday.  Yeah.
R:  Your husband, uh, your in-laws, do they live close too?
L:  Yeah.  Just like a few blocks away.
R:  Oh, that's really great.
L:  I know.  So, it's really cool.  Yeah, we were with them on Saturday, and then we went over to my folk's house on Sunday.
R:  Right.
L:  And had dinner.
R:  And do you live in Pennsylvania too, or is this like a nationwide ...
L:  Mm, this is a nationwide thing I think, yeah, 'cause I like in Washington state.
R:  Washington state?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Rock on!  Can I tell you that I, one day, I'm moving to Oregon. 
L:  Oh, you are, really?
R:  Like, I know that's not Washington, but it's close.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's cool.
R:  You guys are close.  It's always been my dream, I d- --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- to move to Oregon.  I don't know, I lived in, I've lived in a lot of different places, and most recently I lived in Arizona last, that was like a far west --

R:  Oh, right.  I taught second grade at, uh, [several inaudible words] it was a private school.
L:  Oh, okay, that's cool.
R:  Yeah.  So what made you decide to uh, move to Washington? 
L:  Well um, it was actually, my dad's a home builder.  
R:  Oh, right.  
L:  So my senior year of high school, he just decided to go where they were, you know, having a housing boom.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So [LAUGH], so we moved up here.  And I, I wanted to go to the university of Washington anyway.
R:  Nice.
L:  So that kind of worked out well.
R:  And you obviously like it, because you're still there.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I really do.  Yeah.  The weather, you know the weather's okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  But um, yeah, it's really, you know, I like the, you know, all the vegetation --

L:  -- activities and stuff, and, you know we're just south of Seattle, in Tacoma.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  Yeah, where they just had the, the mail scare. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I read about, with the powder in the envelope?
L:  Yes, yeah.  Luckily, it turned out to be nothing.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  Glad, yeah.  So, but ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Where are you thinking about moving in Oregon?
R:  Um, you know what, I've honestly never been there.
L:  Oh.
R:  So it's kind of like a crazy thing, but I mean this has been in my head forever.  I just --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  When I, whenever I finally like, settle down, I want to have a house in Oregon.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  Like it's just, everything I've heard is always good, and I, I love the outdoors, I want to have like tall gardens and --
