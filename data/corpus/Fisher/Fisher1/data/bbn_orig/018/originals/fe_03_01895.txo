L:  Hello my name is Evelyn. 
R:  Hey Evelyn this is Karen. 
L:  Hi Karen. 
R:  Hi, I'm in North Carolina. 
L:  Hi, I'm in New York. 
R:  In New York, oh, okay --
L:  How's the weather there today? 
R:  Oh, beautiful. 
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  Absolutely beautiful. 
L:  It's nice here today too. 
R:  Good.  Right we're talking on families. 
L:  Yes, I'm having major family drama because I was an only child and I am getting married and so I have inherited two elderly parents.
R:  Oh, my. 
L:  And, um, some very vindictive brothers, and, uh, -- uh, it's just difficult because this is his second marriage -- as is mine, but I didn't have these issues because I didn't have any siblings and I certainly didn't have an ex-husband, or children or any of that to deal with. 
R:  So your definition of family is getting ready to change. 
L:  Yes, it is getting ready to change. 
R:  In a big fashion -- gracious.  Well I -- my family was, you know -- I have a sister, um, we're all very close knit -- we live close together so when h- -- when I married I had, um,  he had a brother and a sister and they still live near by.  His mother lives near by, so we're all -- didn't have any major issues with family there, um, 
L:  Did you marry when you were younger? 
R:  I was twenty one when I married. 
L:  Okay. 
R:  So and it is my first marriage [inaudible] and it is sixteen years now, um, -- almost seventeen.  Um, so I don't have that second  family issue -- although my sister who married a second time and it's her husbands third time and he had grown children and not quite grown children and she had young children, so --
L:  Wow how did that mix.  
R:  [MN]
L:  That's real family mix. 
R:  Yeah it -- it's most everybody has been acc- -- has accepted my sister.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, the oldest daughter is like twenty five now, um, -- she still has a hard time with it, um, but they fortunately they don't all live near by -- they live miles and miles and miles away so they don't have to see each other on a regular basis. 
L:  Yeah, he has the same kind of situation, my, uh, husband to be has two daughters who are in their twenties, and -- and  I don't know if they're  traumatically effected, or if they just decided to take up their mothers crusade --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- but, uh, they're really giving him a hard time -- complete with major college debts, and paying off all of her other debt and giving her the house and, giving her money out of pension and it's really been quite traumatic -- they're -- they're also vindictive just in the way they communicate or rather don't communicate with him.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  The latest one has -- has decided to have a wedding ceremony so she sent him an invitation with the day and a time cut out.  So he has no way of knowing.
R:  Oh, my gracious. 
L:  Which -- which I cur- -- personally didn't understand because she didn't invite him as dad to come to the wedding.
R:  Right. 
L:  Uh, she asked him to cater and serve at the wedding, because he's a cook so she asked him to cater and to serve.
R:  Wow. 
L:  And, uh -- and of course to have me come along and cater and serve and he said, "Nope I just want to be dad, I'll pay for it catering" --
R:  That's right
L:  "I'll do whoever you like, but I'm not comfortable being in my old house with my ex-wife and my new wife to be all under the same roof.  They don't get along, and it's not going to work, and this is your day."  So she  --
R:  That was very smart. 
L:  So she stormed out of his office and said, "I never want to talk to you again" and that was almost a year ago. 
R:  Oh, wow. 
L:  And  then the invitation showed up.  So, I'm learning a lot about this -- about how family are the first people that will hurt you. 
R:  Right.  You are exactly right. 
L:  But I learned that also from my own up bringing from my family --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I have always kept by distance with family --
R:  The family.
L:  -- and creating my own family -- my own world of friends and people that I like to be around, but this is -- this family dynamic of feeling like it's okay to mistreat you --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- because your brother -- your blood or your indispensable because  you'll only have one brother -- it just seems a little odd to me.  Since I'm an only child --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I would think you would cherish your sibling and do you best to try and figure out how to work together especially on issues of elderly parents.
R:  Right. 
L:  Which is --
R:  And I think -- I know in -- in -- in my particular situation I'm -- I'm closer to my family than I probably am to any one, um, and I can tell them any thing, um, -- even my aunts and uncles because we're in the south and we -- everybody that I consider my family lives within a twenty mile radius of each other.  So we're all very close --
L:  That's great.
R:  -- but -- but on the other token  there are things that I say and do to my family, that I wouldn't dare say to a co-worker or do to one of my friends. 
L:  Sure. 
R:  Um, and I think it's that sounding board that we feel like -- okay they'll still love us and still care about us if we are very ugly to them just a vent.   Where as we couldn't do that with your friends. 
L:  Sure. 
R:  And you push your family and that hard situation because they get hurt -- you hurt your family not necessarily meaning to but knowing that's just a good sounding board.  Um, --
L:  Sure.  And I think there's a difference between a family that's supportive and understand that you're venting an a -- and a sibling rivalry that at fifteen was okay, and at twenty five it wasn't okay but you know it was understandable, but at fifty five it's just pathetic.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  So [LAUGH] I'm -- what I am sensing and seeing from this family is that they, um, -- they very much like to stay in roles.  He is the youngest son, and -- and has always sort of been mistreated as the youngest and him growing up, turning fifty, divorcing and  remarrying has thrown such a monkey wrench into the family dynamic.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because not only is he changing to stand up for himself and to do what's right for his life which means leaving behind a psychologically strange relationship that very much emulated the family dynamic.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right. 
L:  Of course and, uh, so they really -- one it puts fear into them about the kind of person he's becoming -- it shows up who they are, and what they settled for, and number two it upsets the family dynamic because they expect not only to  continue to be able to mistreat him as the youngest, but now the new wife should accept  the same behavior --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because she's the wife of the youngest.
R:  The youngest. 
L:  And I don't tolerate that very well. 
R:  Yeah, and you know those -- those roles --  and I think you find those in families and I guess when you look at us and other creatures of the world, we're a lot like other animals that, you know -- when you have our own little clan of people you've got that [inaudible] and you have got the person th- that takes care of the others, and -- and you've got the little groups within groups that -- and when something up sets that balance and it's like -- oh, something's, you know --
L:  Yes. 
R:  Some families can -- can get through that and others can't -- I know in my family, my grand mother just died last month and --
L:  I'm sorry for your loss.
R:  Oh, thank you and there were three daughters, my mother and her two sisters and they all got along, but they didn't get along always --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- and you know one was thinking the other was doing more than the other for th- you know grandmother I'm t- -- I'm taking on all of this weight and you're not and --
L:  Oh, yeah, I'm seeing a lot of that now.
R:  Yeah, I think the death actually brought them closer.
L:  Well that's actually good because if there was any money involved that would of been exactly the time that it blew up. 
R:  Right.  And you know my gra- -- grandmothers estate had been dwindled down -- it was never very large, but because she died at home and for the last two years they have been paying sitters and medicate -- what paying like a thousand dollars a month, and it was taking them about three thousand dollars a month --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- to pay for round the clock, um, care so what money she had made and put aside dwindled down. 
L:  Sure. 
R:  And, um,  of course the will had pretty much established the tangible things and every thing else was split and so I mean it was never really a question -- they all pretty much knew -- they knew how much was there but they had taken all over her finances, so that was never really an, uh, issue it could have been if it had been several years ago before.
L:  Yes, I quite agree.  I quite agree -- I have parents are in their eighties and their -- their fairly healthy and that their all -- they're sort of independent -- we do their shopping. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they take care of their house -- they just sold their house, they were very fortunate they live up here, in New York in up State County in a county that seems to be wildly popular --
R:  Oh, wow. 
L:  -- with city folks that wood stalk area so they literally sold their house in one day.
R:  Gracious.
L:  And yeah, it's pretty amazing.
R:  That is phenomenal.
L:  And -- and they sold it for about three times more than they paid for it.
R:  Oh, man.
L:  So they're sitting on assets that their youngest son the one who's always pushed aside --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is a financial planner, so he tripled or quadrupled their savings when they retired at sixty and now he sold their house for three times more than he had it built for, twenty years ago. 
R:  Gracious.
L:  So now they're sitting on a really nice nest egg and they're making a choice to move out of state, uh, 'cause we're making the same choice. 
R:  Right.
L:  And they decided out of all of their children to move to where we're moving and it -- you know while it was nice we constantly made them understand they should move to where ever they want to move -- they have three sons, pick one and move near that son.  There's no pressure here -- all that we want to make sure is that you're cared for because you can no longer live alone.
R:  Right.
L:  They don't like the word assisted living --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it real truth is that they do need assistance --
R:  That's what they need.
L:  -- they just don't want strangers doing it. 
R:  Right. 
L:  Cause we do the shopping, we check in on them, occasionally we cook for them.  Um, we certainly are monitoring behaviors with medicines, doctors visits, and we take them to those things, so it's really become quite a point of contention for them to be moving to the same place we're contemplating moving.  Why?  I have no idea -- so  the very children who claim they love their parents so much are up set with their parents and taking it out on them for moving to where we're moving. 
L:  [inaudible] Which I also don't get.  [LAUGH]
R:  Then that could become an issue, uh, -- you'll are taking all of -- all of their money.
