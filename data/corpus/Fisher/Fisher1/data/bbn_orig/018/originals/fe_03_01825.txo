L:  Hi -- 
R:  Hello -- 
L:  -- I'm -- I'm Paulette.
R:  Hi, I'm Janice [NOISE] how are you? 
L:  Okay, how are you? 
R:  Good, um, I guess we're supposed to discuss computers.
L:  Computers and education.
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH], um, do you have children? 
L:  [NOISE] Yes, I have six year old twins.
R:  Okay, I have a -- a little older -- my children are a little older, I have a seventeen year old and a fifteen year old.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Um, what's your feeling on this? 
L:  Well, considering I've just changed my children to a school whose emphasis was on technology [LAUGH] --  
R:  Ahah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I would say I'm sort of for the technology -- you know, the computers in schools. 
R:  Okay. [MN] 
L:  And we've got, ah, right now there is almost one computer per student --
R:  Oh, really --
L:  -- at this point, yeah.
R:  -- that's very nice.  That's very nice.  Ah, we don't have quite that, you know, that kind of technology here yet in our school system, but I mean they do have computer labs for the kids and pretty much everyone has to have one at home, um, I have -- I have a, um, I think computers are great, you know, I really think that they're the way the world is going, um, as far as education I think that they're -- they're terrific, I -- my issue with them is as a parent is more in the social aspect than on the educational one -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ah, your six year olds, I'm sure you haven't dealt with this yet but when you get -- they get a little older that's their entire social situation.
L:  Oh, no, I have not had to deal with that yet, no -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- I'm not looking forward -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- To that.
R:  Well, they don't -- they won't call, there is no talking, all their talking is done on the computer -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in groups like they interact on the computer --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- and --
L:  Chat rooms and --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stuff --
R:  -- well, not e- even instant messages and things like that and, like, if I say to my children, "Why don't you see if so and so is home" and they'll say, "Okay, I'll go and see if they're online". 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Like, they would never think to pick up a telephone.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  They wouldn't, [LAUGH] neither one of them and --  
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and everybody that -- that I know that has children that age feelings the same way, so as much as I think they're wonderful for, um, educational purposes and -- and obviously the internet has, ah, created a whole vast in- you know, situation of knowledge, ah, and information that was never available.  Ah, at one point my children were doing a report, one of them was doing a report on koala bears --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they actually accessed a zoo in Australia. 
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  You know, they were talking to, you know, one of the zoo keepers there --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- and the information obviously was tremendous, so I mean you can't -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't see how anybody. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- can --
L:  [NOISE] I think with anything with children you have to, you know, set your limits.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They can --
R:  [MN] Well, yeah, at home obviously, but ... 
L:  I mean like with me -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I'm -- I'm an anti video game parent --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as I'm seeing with the video games even at this age.
R:  Are they boys or girls? 
L:  One of each.
R:  One of each, wow.
L:  Yeah, so I'm -- I'm watching to see how they would much rather sit [NOISE] run to the TV screen with it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- whereas they need to be outside playing an--  
R:  Mhm.  Well, I had that on the computer with my son --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because he was very much into -- as much as the video games he was into him on the computer --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- and he would play over the internet.
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- and he would play with people in, you know -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- all over the world, he --  
L:  Oh, neat --
R:  -- which is interesting in that he learned a lot of things from these people because they do have some interaction as well as gaming --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I didn't feel the amount of time invested in these -- 
L:  Well, I work at a school and I know like with our -- with the internet access we have some very stringent blocks [NOISE] -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of what they can do at school.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, -- well, I like how they have it set up at school and, you know, I have even looked into putting those blocks on my children's computer as they age.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to ensure they can't access anything [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, well, [MN] what happened here was when you did that, when I did that -- or years ago, and I'm assuming that, ah, obviously technology just moves at such a pace that's incredible, but when I did it with my children, when I did put limits on the computers and you had you know, parental guidance and controls -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- they couldn't go anywhere --  
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- because websites have to be rated --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- in order for the parental control to kick in.  So, half of the websites aren't rated.  It doesn't mean they're X rated it just means they're not rated.  So, even if it's a purely educational site -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- if it doesn't have a rating on it, they couldn't access it.
L:  Maybe they have that problem.  Ah, it will not allow you into chat rooms though at all --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- which --  
R:  Which is fine, because I think those are horrible.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I watch with a friend of mine's son -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- ah, he was in there chatting -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- with someone supposedly his age and they were saying things that were far beyond I thought someone they're age would --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- know about --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I started saying, "Well, ask him about this, this, this and this" and they knew the answers to it and I said, "You're not talking to -- 
R:  Really? 
L:  "-- to a fifteen year old" [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah, you have to get -- you have to be real careful with this.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean I, um, [LIPSMACK] I told both of my children, you know, that, um, as much as I'm not looking to invade their privacy totally, they're not allowed to have email accounts without having access to it.
L:  Right.
R:  And I periodically check --  
L:  Which you should --
R:  -- I check what they're sending as well as what they're getting.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, because I can't --  you know, and I've said to them, "It's my job to keep you safe". 
L:  Right.
R:  And I don't think you can -- you have the -- the capability at even fifteen or seventeen to know at this point what's safe or not safe or who is what they -- you know, this is a totally blind situation, you have no idea who you're talking to.
L:  That's it.
R:  When you are on these, you know, computers and -- and people you know, they email each other instant message each other all the time and [MN] you know, sometimes they'll say, "Oh, so and so gave me your name or number" and you know, I also tell them do not give anything --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- any information.  But I mean as far as the schooling is concerned I can't imagine how a school can even exist at this point without the technology.
L:  They can't.
R:  I -- I don't see how -- how it's possible.  I mean the advantages I just think so far outweigh.
L:  Now, you're probably old enough, you remember Lost in Space.
R:  Yes, mhm.
L:  There was a particular episode that has been brought back to my attention lately where all the kids were sitting in front of video scenes being taught. 
R:  Really? 
L:  And I thought, you know, it's kind of, you know, funny about that's --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, where it's almost going.
R:  Oh, yeah and you know, a -- a friend of mine has as [LIPSMACK] son in college, one of his courses was given over the television set to his dorm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He didn't even have to get out of bed.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It was just videoed right to his dorm.  I mean it's just an amazing world.  I -- I personally don't agree with that, I think that is a bit far fetched, get out of the bed, but, um, I do think --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that the -- the, ah, information and the ability to move throughout the world for these kids is -- is just incredible.  I also happen to like -- I have one in my home, obviously we have more than one in my home --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- ah, because we have, you know, those arguments.
L:  [NOISE] Yep.
R:  Um, and when they do reports or any kind of projects for school, you can access just about any library, including the library of congress and they can do this on their time whether it's seven at night or eleven at night or six in the morning and there is no such thing as it's closed.
L:  Right, and we did that and -- and just looking for projects --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- something new and interesting, "Hey, let's see what we can find" --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- done that already.
R:  Yeah, we, ah, -- I have found that I don't think that they could have gone through school to the point that they're at a this -- my son going to be a senior -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I can't imagine how they could have done it without a computer -- 
L:  No, not at this point --
R:  -- for reports.  Even -- e- I have to tell you teachers won't even accept anything that is handwritten any more and back up, I mean they even want it half the time on disk.
L:  Oh [LAUGH]  
R:  They don't even print anything, they just give the teacher the disk.
L:  Wow, no, where not that --
R:  Yeah, I mean it's just an amazing thing, or they download it in school.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  You know, or they research at school and they send it home to my computer at home, they email to themselves they can send information, it's just unbelievable --  
L:  Now, do you get a lot of parent -- par- -- you know, the -- the PTA does a lot of things over the computer --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they announce things to us and we don't have --  
R:  The communication -- the communication that it's, you know, created is just so much easier, except for the fact that unfortunately it doesn't make people interact and that's the only problem that my husband and I have.
L:  Right, you're not getting the human interaction --
R:  Yeah, you know, he says we are raising a generation of non communicative typists.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  They can all type huh- two hundred words a minute -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I mean my son can type you know, unbelievably.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But he wouldn't, you know, he wouldn't pick up a phone to have a conversation.
L:  No, that's --  
R:  You know, he -- I mean he will but for the most part his conversations are typed -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they're not, you know, verbal and -- and that's a scary thing for us -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, we look at that and we say, you know, "There is going to be some repercussions".  I really believe that somewhere down the line -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- there is going to come out to be repercussions from -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that part of the -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the computer.
L:  [NOISE] We haven't had that -- thank goodness haven't that part yet --
R:  Well, they're young yet.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, they're -- they're too young [NOISE] for that area.
R:  Mhm, but I mean if I say, "Go and call so and see if they want to come over" -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they'll go, "I'll check if they're online" -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- never call.  I mean -- and I have to say, "The telephone, use the telephone, I mean what's wrong with the phone?  No, no, I'll go see if they're online" -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and I find that even parents and -- and I find myself even sometimes it's easier to email someone [MN] in an unwind situation than it's to call up and go through the "Hi, how are you, and how'd the family" and -- if I just need to send you something real quick [MN] I can email it to you in ten seconds.
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  And we don't have to go through a whole conversation.  So, it's, um, it's interesting from that point of view the ramifications [LIPSMACK] of it, but -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- as far as our schooling goes [NOISE] I -- I think that the -- the future is definitely going to be every--
