L:  Hello? 
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name is Sucrete[?], and I have strong feelings about computers in education.  Who are you?
R:  Um, I'm Charlie McSweeny[?], and, ah, ah [LAUGH] I have mixed feelings about computers in education.  But, ah, I guess, ah, they're mostly positive.
L:  Well, mine are pretty positive too.  I've been a college instructor and a student for a long long time, and ah, I tell you, when I was in college and when I have been studying mostly languages, I have yearned for the days of, of, of computers, and recently when I've been studying Hindi, ah, a foreign language for me, I'm a native English speaker, I have yearned for a good computer program that I could just sit with that would drill me and have endless patience for my endless mistakes and not get bored with my nonsense so that I could study my Hindi with a computer.
R:  Uh-huh.  I --
L:  What has been your experience, or lack there of?
R:  Well, you know, I, I never thought about, ah, an application for, ah, language, and it seems like that would be a really excellent, ah, um, really excellent for any language because of the, you know, the way you can work with a computer.  Um, my experience has been, um, ah, not as -- personally, ah, I never had an opportunity to use computers when I was in school --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but, um, my son does a lot, and, ah, and I do, you know, for business reasons, but, um, um, I, I suppose that, um, -- at first I was opposed to computers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know how detailed [LAUGH] we're supposed to be here, but ah, I'm not a Luddite, but, um, I, I really -- I don't like the impersonality of it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And also the, ah, -- it was really frustrating to me to work with a computer because, um, you know, it's their way or no way.
L:  Yeah, I'm not a computer person generally, I don't like them and I -- I too find them just tedious.  They're so literal minded and you have to, yeah d- -- as you say, they have -- you've got to dot every i and cross every t, and go through every little tidgy[?] step.  I find them tedious in the extreme, and, and I'm not comfortable with them.  I too am of a generation --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- where we didn't have them, and I don't particularly like them.  But for the kind of, you know, endless boring stuff that language entails --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're, they're just priceless.
R:  And, and they're, they're -- my, um, my son for a while, um, we home schooled him --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and we, we got [NOISE] his program on computer, ah, his, his curriculum one year, and, um, there's a lot of things where it worked really great.  Um, ah, and ah, especially with spelling and, um, ah, geography or social studies, you know, ah, --
L:  Mhm, mhm. 
R:  -- in where he could learn where things were around the world, and um -- but um, um, -- 
L:  I do a lot of research nowadays in my work, and, ah, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I also just love it for, for the incredible convenience.  You know, I remember as a graduate student, you know, having to use an old fashioned library with card catalogs, and just, just feeling how, how difficult it was to, to just physically get hold of the information I needed and, and how I, how threatened and frightened I felt at, at just, just feeling that I never was getting to the bottom of things.  And the internet is such a joy, both for the ease and, and the feeling of, of being able to get to the bottom of things.  Of, of being able to, to put your finger on, if you work hard at it, all the information that's ever been gathered on a -- on any arcane topic that, that you can conceive of.  I mean, if you gotta find a -- an octagonal leopard skin covered pool table that exists somewhere in the world, you're probably gonna be able to find the location of the darn thing through the internet.
R:  Yep.  You're right.
L:  And [LAUGH] you know, in a library, with, with paper, it's gonna be a task. [LAUGH] You know, you gotta go through inter library loan and the card catalog, and, you know, X million number of indices, and even the librarians won't know how to help you half the time.  And the internet is such a joy for that.  And, and that's -- that's revolutionized education.
R:  Yeah, ah, for education it, it -- I, I think it really is the -- well, for all ways, but, ah -- in a lot of ways, but, but education especially it's, ah, I think a really good, um, um, medium.  And in, um, in -- in, you know, in the classrooms for elementary and, ah, high school and middle school, um, you know, it's really, um, makes it -- it -- I -- this gene- the generation that's in school now, and you know, the grades I just mentioned, they seem to be born with a -- able to interface with a computer much better than in our older generation.
L:  Mhm.  How old was your son --
R:  You know, --
L:  -- when he started learning to use the computer?
R:  Well, I mean, before the computer he was playing video games.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so, he probably started doing that when he was seven.
L:  Really?
R:  Six or seven.  And he started using the computer maybe two years ago at about age ten.
L:  What did he learn first?  Handwriting or typing?  I'm curious.
R:  Well, ah, --
L:  You know, in, in terms of motor skills.
R:  -- to be honest he, he -- to be honest he doesn't really know how to type on it -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- completely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, ah.  But, um, he can figure out things that I can't, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, just -- he can look at the screen and just, ah, he just has -- is adept at it, and I think a lot of kids nowadays are, ah -- they can, you know, they can -- they're more in tune with --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the technology.  And, um, with the speed that it, it can go at also.  Um, --
L:  How was -- how has the computer influenced teaching reading and, and writing, in your experience with, with a child?
R:  Well, um, it has -- hasn't helped him so far as far as writing goes.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, you don't write when you use a computer.  That's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, you obviously write intellectually, but you don't pra- you know, you don't use your hand to write at all.
R:  No.  And, ah, his, um, handwriting is definitely not, um, -- it needs -- it needs a lot -- leaves a lot to be desired, and, um, I don't think, um, um, -- well my son's probably not a good example. [LAUGH] Ah, school is something that he has to get out of the way to play.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He doesn't have that desire to learn yet.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Oh, um, he does, but it's not a priority.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's other things he'd much rather do, so, um, -- and we're working on that.  But it doesn't really involve the computer, so, ah, -- um, --
L:  Well, different -- different people, different human being, I think, you know, have different ways of learning and different --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- subjects they're interested in learning about.  I remember -- I'm not, you know, an academic and a researcher by nature, but for example I remember that I was very slow by my parents' light, ah, to read.  And, and when I thought about it as an adult I remembered that gee, the reading books I was given were so dull, look, there was no reason why I would want to read them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, See Dick Run -- 
R:  Dick and Jane, yeah.
L:  -- was, was so boring that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- why would I want to read that?  If someone would read to me, what they would read was so much [LAUGH] more interesting.
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  But there was no reason for me to read.  And so, why bother?  You know, if they'd of given me something that aroused my curiosity, I might have been --
R:  Yeah, your imagination.
L:  -- a lot faster to read.  
R:  Yeah, you're right.  Exactly.
L:  Um, you know, and so I -- I don't take a lot of, frankly, what, what, you know, people, you know, worry about, my kid in grade school doesn't, you know, or even high school doesn't like school.  Well he, you know, give him something he wants to learn that's taught in school, and he'll be all excited about it.  And maybe what he wants to learn is not what's being taught in, you know, eight thirty to three thirty.
R:  Right.  And --
L:  And so doesn't mean he's dumb or lazy, it just means he's learning in a different way than what's being offered in a classroom at this point in his life. [LAUGH]
R:  And, it's interesting --
L:  Or with a computer. [LAUGH]
R:  It's interesting that you mentioned, ah, learning, ah, ways that kids learn because, ah, we're in the process of taking him out of public school and putting him a Montessori school.
L:  Mm.
R:  Because, ah, he -- they just don't -- well, the classes are too big and they just don't, um, you know, they aren't able to work with them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in the ways that he learns, that he
