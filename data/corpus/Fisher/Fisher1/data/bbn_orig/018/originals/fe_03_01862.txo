R:  Hi, my name is Cindy. 
L:  Hi, my name is, ah, Christine.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  And, um, ah, where, where are you, ah, from?
R:  Ah, I live, ah, in, in Canada, in British Colombia.
L:  Canada.
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, I'm in California.
R:  Oh, wow.  Nice -- a lot warmer, I imagine.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Um, so have you done this before?
R:  Ah, yeah, I did it once, once before.
L:  Uh-huh, me too.  
R:  Okay.
L:  I just did it once before.
R:  Good.
L:  And, ah, I think we just talk about the, um, the topic --
R:  Mhm, that's right, okay.  Um, well --
L:  The question --
R:  -- I, I personally have, ah, two, two kids.  One's in, ah, um, she'll be starting kindergarten, so she's in preschool, and the other one is in grade one.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um, I had, ah, my, um, my oldest, ever since she was little, I had a computer.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  And, ah, I got some programs for her, and I thought it helped her, personally.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I thought -- I think it helps.  If you get the right, you know, the right kind of programs.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  'Cause I know when, for example, with the math and the reading, I got some programs that were really good and helped her get quite, ah, skilled in math and, and so on, 'cause she thought they were fun and would do them and it would help her with her math and, and with the reading.
L:  Wow.
R:  And so I personally think that it, it does work.
L:  Did you get those Leapfrog kind, or what kind of, um, which brand?
R:  I got the Reader Rabbit.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, one I --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- um, I think that's one kind.  And, ah, I think the other kind was something like that too.
L:  Oh, how old was she when she started?
R:  Well, when she was really small.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ah, she was a year old, I guess.  I got one -- a little Pooh one, Winnie the Pooh.
L:  Oh, uh-huh. 
R:  And, ah, I would, you know, point to the different things and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we'd click on, you know, would pop up, the really --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- really small kid type things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And she caught on really fast.  And --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- by the time she was, she was four --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I could leave her there to click around, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- go off and do something else, and she could handle it.
L:  Oh.
R:  And she was like, really quick at that.
L:  Oh, I see, yeah.
R:  And my other daughter --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that turned five --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- she, she's really good at it too.
L:  Oh, she's already doing that too?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I think, I -- I'm for computers too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I have a two and a half year old.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she already likes, um, she wants to see what we're doing -- 
R:  That's right, yep.
L:  -- when we're on the computer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then she asks us, ah, you know, what letter the keyboard -- on the keyboard.
R:  Right.
L:  She says, what, you know, "What is it?  What is it?  What is it?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then we repeat to her, "It's J, or, it's W", like a hundred times, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  That's right. [LAUGH]
L:  She asks --
R:  They keep asking.
L:  What is that -- yeah, they keep on asking, and then she'll be tapping on it many times.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then she'll be tapping on S, and she'll say, "S S S S S S S" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Yep.
L:  And she thinks it's a game.  I mean, she thinks it's a play.
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  Yeah, yeah. 
R:  And I think that that's one thing that -- that's why it's good for them, because in a way it's, ah, because of that play, feeling.  I mean, kids learn by play.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so when it's, when it's a game, an educational type game --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then, ah, they learn -- they learn.  'Cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- kids are like a sponge, you know, they soak it up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so I know there was, um, a lady I was talking to that she was saying, "Oh, it, you know, it doesn't -- it detracts 'cause it's very only one sided, ah, but you know, when it -- when they're interactive I don't see how they're one sided, if they have to respond". 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And according to how they respond, like, for example the math, the math --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- one that she had was really good.  They were -- they were all games --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like there was one that was -- the rabbit was on a tightrope.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And there was a bucket of water --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- underneath, and there was a hippo.  And --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- ah, she had to, for example at the beginning, she had to, it was either, you start with simple numbers like one, two, or three --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, ah, the rabbit would be holding up a certain amount of blocks.  And if it, if it was --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- the four blocks, she was supposed to click on the water.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so that the rabbit would dump it down, because that wasn't the number.  Let's say it was three.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But if it was three, you'd click on, ah, the hippo, and then the hippo would do like a balancing act holding the three blocks.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I've seen that --
R:  And so --
L:  -- rabbit thing.
R:  Yeah.  So it, ah --
L:  Somebody had it, uh-huh. 
R:  It was really good, and then there was another one that was, um, like a, I think it was the seal.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  A seal that's, like, juggling.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's like adding and subtracting.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  And so it goes up, if you do the first one -- it gives you multiple choice, you get to pick --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- one plus one, it will give you a choice --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- one, two, three, four.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  If you get it right it will go, one plus two.  And then if you get it right it will go one plus three.  And, ah, if you get it wrong it will start over again, one plus one, so it's like, --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- repetition.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Until they get it all right, and they get a -- every time they get something right --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they get a coupon.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  And then they go get -- go to cash in, it's like, -- you set up like a circus.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so each thing is, like, a circus one, and they go cash in their coupons to get some little figure from the store, supposedly, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like, some would be worth three, some would be worth six --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and some nine.  So in a way too it gets them into, ah, how much they need to, to buy or to, to cash it in --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so it gets them thinking in that way too even.
L:  Oh my God.
R:  So I really am for the computers, because I think it really helped them.
L:  Yeah, I think when they enjoy the program --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they'll really improve.
R:  Yes.
L:  And if it's too, um, boring or complicated, or it's a little, um, too easy or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- too difficult maybe, they'll lose it -- um, they'll lose attention.
R:  That's right, and then it's not --
L:  So -- 
R:  -- not worth --
L:  -- it's not --
R:  -- you know.  Like, I personally am not for, for example, the, the video type --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- games -- 
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  -- where all they're doing is they're clicking and clicking trying to, to shoot down the car -- the whatever.
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  I, I don't -- I'm not for those, 'cause I don't see those -- they're, they're addictive, but they --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- don't have any value to my thinking.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Whereas the other educational type programs --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I think those are great, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah, I heard that, um, the video game of, ah, role play --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or building cities --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- those kind of video games are, ah, a little bit -- um, you have -- you really have to use your brain.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  And you really have to do a lot of thinking.
R:  Right.
L:  Then those are a little bit different, I think.
R:  Yeah, mhm.  Better.  Type --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I've been thinking about getting a computer program for my daughter.
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  Yeah, she's, she's gonna be two and a half, so --
R:  Right, right.
L:  And she can talk, yeah.
R:  Well, if you, you get it, um, and you sit down with her and, you know, they catch it up so quick.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The first, the first thing they, they have to learn, like, I put the, the mouse on its slowest, um, you know how you can get it so it moves fast or slower --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- on the screen, and so I put it on the slowest --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause one thing that to begin with is the hand eye coordination, you know.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  The knowing that when you move your hand that moves the mouse.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.
R:  So the first part is when they catch on about that, and then they have to, like for example, my, um, my five -- she just turned five two days ago --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but she still has a little --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- bit of problem --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- getting it, you know, she has -- takes a little while while she gets it centered exactly where she wants it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- before she clicks.  And so --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- it takes a while for that hand eye coordination.
L:  Yeah, that mouse is pretty difficult.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  'Cause it's kinda huge, but the, the little arrow --
R:  Yeah, that's right --
L:  -- is all over the place.
R:  -- you know, they, they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have to think in their mind that actually what their hand is doing is moving that little mouse.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  To begin with it's kind of --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- hard for them to get that.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah, I'm thinking, where do you usually, um, buy -- go buy your softwares?
R:  Ah, well, Future Shop.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Or A and B Sound.
L:  Oh.
R:  Or places that, you know, even, even places like Walmart, or I just look around --
L:  Oh, the -- just the --
R:  -- to see where --
L:  -- anywhere.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I've seen it at --
R:  Yeah, I just look around to see where, you know, they have them and, and certain ones.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like, ah, right now that they're older, my, my dad bought my older daughter the Magic School Bus ones --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- where they talk about -- ah, she's got the ones that was, um, about the wild -- about the animals, animal kingdom.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so --
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  -- so that was kinda nice, 'cause it has games, but besides that they learn things.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And she thought that was great.  She really enjoyed that one.
L:  Oh, and how long does she, um, is she on the com- computer?
R:  Ah, she doesn't actually --
L:  Usually.
R:  -- she used to, she went through phases.  Um, when she was younger --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- she wanted to be, she was on it a bit every day.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  She liked playing those games.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But now that she goes to school --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- she's kind of more into --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to playing with her friends, and you know, so she doesn't do it as much, only once in a while.
L:  Oh.
R:  So in a way, you know, like some people say, oh, it's addictive and everything, but you know, she played a lot more when she was, when she was, ah, alone, or when she was younger.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But now that she's in school, she, she's not as interested.
L:  Oh.
R:  To only do it once in a while because she
