L:  Doreen Bornia[?]. 
R:  Hi, my name's Fred.
L:  Hi, how you doing?
R:  Ah, not bad.
L:  [LAUGH]  So we have to talk about family now?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, [MN] well, I come from a big family.  I have six siblings.
L:  Ahah. 
R:  Um, [MN] they're all -- five are older one is younger.  Um, I have one brother, five sisters and, um, --
L:  Do you like being in a big family? 
R:  Yeah, um, --
L:  Do you have -- do you -- are you married? 
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  No.  So you don't have a big family of your own yet.  Neither do I.  I'm -- I come from a small family.  I just have one brother.
R:  Ahah.
L:  And I'm not married either.  I don't have kids.  I have two cats. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  So how old is --
L:  That's my family.  
R:  How old -- 
L:  Me, I'm thirty eight years old.
R:  How old is your brother? 
L:  He's twenty.
R:  So are you two very close? 
L:  Not really.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  Because we grew up, you know, with, ah, separate fathers.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  'Cause my mother got remarried.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  When I was -- when I was younger. [NOISE] So, I wasn't really around that much.  
R:  So you have, um, a -- a stepfather?
L:  Yes.
R:  So how was -- how was that?
L:  Um, he's an idiot.
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I don't like him.
R:  Ahah.
L:  I don't like him very much 'cause he doesn't treat my mother very well, so I don't like him.
R:  So, who do you consider to be part of your family?
L:  My mother. [LAUGH]
R:  Just your mother?
L:  My mother and, ah, my friends.
R:  Did your father pass away? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  He passed away a while -- a long time, about fifteen years. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, my father passed away when I was pretty young.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So it was mostly just my mother raised us.
L:  Yeah.  Wow, that's pretty hard.
R:  Yeah, but, I mean, all my siblings are, like, a year apart.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So we're all about the same age.
L:  Right, so that's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  At least you always have somebody to talk to if you had a problem.
R:  Yeah. And --
L:  If mum wasn't around or whatever. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and, I mean, we usually went to the same school and had some of the same friends and, um, my younger sister she -- I mean, I guess I was the closest to her because she was the closest, um, [MN] I guess the closest in age to me.
L:  Mhm.  And how old are you?  I mean, I didn't ask you.
R:  Ah, right now I'm twenty three.
L:  Oh, you're young!
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  You're a young puppy.
R:  And, ah, --
L:  You sound older.
R:  [LAUGH]  [inaudible]
L:  [LAUGH]  And what state are you calling from?
R:  Massachusetts.
L:  Oh, I'm in Brooklyn, New York.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  How's the weather over there today?
R:  Ah, a little windy but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  At least it's not snowing or anything.
L:  Yeah, thank -- thank the Lord for that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, getting back to the other -- to the -- to the rest of the subject at hand, you were saying?
R:  Yeah, she's -- um, yeah, so actually she ended up going to the same college as I -- as I went to and, um, I don't -- I don't know if she's going to live in the same city, though.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's -- it's interesting, I mean, now that I've graduated, um, you know, I'm starting to have my own life.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I mean, I don't know if I'd get married any time soon or anything but -- 
L:  Well, you're young.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Enjoy life.
R:  Yeah, so ...
L:  [NOISE] Get plenty of women first.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, you know, and then -- you know, get your -- sew your wild oats and then -- then think about getting married.
R:  Yeah, I mean, --
L:  Because you don't want to regret life, you know what I'm saying?
R:  Yeah, but, I mean, for right now, um, -- you know, I mean, I go home to visit, -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, but, I mean, I just graduated from college and when I -- 
L:  Mhm.  What did you study? 
R:  Ah, computer science.
L:  Oh.  Do you have a job yet, or ...
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  So when I graduated I was trying to decide where I wanted to live and, I mean, I went to school in Boston so a lot of my friends are still here.
L:  Right.
R:  So I decided to stay around here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and two of my sisters still live here too.
L:  Right.
R:  So, but, I mean, I don't know how I would feel about -- you know, if I -- if I had to move to a different city where I didn't know anyone --
L:  Yeah, that's hard.
R:  Yeah, so ...
L:  Yeah, that's very hard, to -- to get up and just leave and, you know, leave all your friends and family behind and you don't know anybody, that's hard.  That's a -- that's -- you've got to be a big risk taker for that one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know if -- if I would be able to do that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Leave my friends and my family behind. [MN]
R:  So do you visit your family very often?
L:  Oh, yeah, my mother -- ah, I see my mother every day.
R:  Oh, that's great. 
L:  [LAUGH]  Me and my mother are close.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  Yeah.  We fight a lot but -- but -- who -- what family doesn't?
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, I guess --
L:  Especially when you're close you always fight a lot.
R:  Oh? 
L:  It always seems to be that way.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah. [MN]
R:  I think -- I think I usually get a- along pretty well with my mum.
L:  Yeah?  
R:  Um, -- 
L:  You never fight? 
R:  Ah, not really.
L:  No?
R:  Um, I think my other siblings -- [LAUGH]
L:  They -- they take the brunt of it, right?
R:  Yeah, well, [MN] --
L:  Or she's just too tired to fight, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  I mean, I think, um, [LIPSMACK] I guess I don't argue a lot in general and -- 
L:  Oh.  Are you a laid back kind of person?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And --
L:  Let me guess, you're a Virgo.
R:  [LAUGH]  No.
L:  [LAUGH]  'Cause usually Virgos are pretty laid back.
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  I have -- my boyfriend, he's Virgo, he's so laid back he doesn't -- he doesn't like to get into confrontation at all.
R:  Yeah, I don't either.
L:  So, -- so, yeah, any -- you have a -- a girlfriend or ...
R:  Ah, no. [LAUGH]
L:  You're just a single guy, just --
R:  Yeah, I have a cat actually.
L:  Oh, you have a cat too?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is it a boy or a girl?
R:  [LIPSMACK] It's a girl.  Her name is Sophia.
L:  I have two boys.
R:  Oh, what are their names?
L:  One is Oreo.
R:  [LAUGH]  Okay.
L:  He looks like, ah, he's like a -- you know, black and white.
R:  Ahah.
L:  [MN] And, ah, the other one is Tiger.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He's a pure bred, pure bred, ah, American short hair.
R:  Ahah.
L:  Yeah.  He's -- he is one years old and he's bigger than the on- -- than the older cat who is -- which is seven.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So do you have any other relatives nearby?
L:  Um, I have cousins not too far from me, they're about, mm, forty minutes away.
R:  Okay.
L:  Out, and, um, I have a lot of family in Puerto Rico.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And most of my friends are not here, they're -- they've all moved away.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I only have one friend and she's married and she has kids.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So I don't really see my friends -- 
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- that often as well because they're all married and they have kids -- 
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and I'm the only one what doesn't have kids.
R:  Ahah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Usually when people get married and they have kids, you know, that's their priority in life, you know, they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, they stick with their -- you know, with people who are either married and they have kids and, you know, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they really don't see their friends tha- -- you know, their single friends that often.  I -- I don't know, at least in my case that's the case.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I see them, you know, I only see her once every couple of months.
R:  Yeah, they're probably pretty busy.
L:  Yeah.  You know, when you have kids, you know, that's your priority -- 
R:  Yeah.  Do you think -- 
L:  -- and you work.
R:  Do you think you want to have kids?
L:  No -- 
R:  No?
L:  -- kids for me. [MN]
R:  Definitely not?
L:  No.
R:  Okay.
L:  No kids for me.
R:  Yeah, I don't think I want kids either.
L:  Well, the reason being I don't want kids is because I have -- I have a -- I have a sickness, I have, ah, rheumatoid arthritis.
R:  Oh. 
L:  And, um, I take a lot of medication.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And if I were to have a child it would be very, very complicated.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So it's -- because I would have to stop all my medications.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I would have to be drug free completely for, like, six months before I even try.
R:  Right.
L:  To have a baby.
R:  Right.
L:  And by the time that happens I won't even be -- I won't even be in the mood to have sex. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because yo- -- I would be in so much pain.  So forget about that -- that notion.  And, um, my boyfriend, I told him, I said -- he -- I -- he wants kids but he knows that, um, you know, really it's not -- my body won't be able to handle it.  So he's pretty understanding but, still, usually men want children no matter what.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  You know, most -- most -- most men want children, so ... 
R:  Oh.
L:  And I tell them all, I says, "If you, you know, really want a child then I suggest you find somebody else", and they say, "No, no, no, no, no". [inaudible] --
R:  Well, what about adopting?
L:  I'm -- I'm open to it but he's not.
R:  Oh. Mm.
L:  He's the type of person he has deep family values and, you know, he's like, well, you have to be married and you have to -- you know, "I want a kid of my --  my own".
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm like, "Okay". 
R:  But, you know, there's so many people in the world having kids, you know.  I mean, there are a lot of people that don't have parents.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [MN] I don't know, if I ever -- if I ever was in a place where I wanted to have children I -- I would probably adopt, I think.
L:  Yeah. [COUGH]  Yeah, th- -- I -- I -- I'm definitely would be open to it -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because there's a lot of children out there who don't have any parents.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Who don't want them, you know, and there's a lot of wanting kids out there.  With all -- with all -- so many things going on today, kids need, you know, a good stable home, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Especially kids who don't have any parents.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, what else can we talk about?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, --
L:  How did you get into this study anyway?  This is jus- --
R:  Oh, well, actually, um, my -- my work is, um, is the company that's doing the study. 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I thought if you work for the company wouldn't you be ineligible for it?
R:  Ah, no, they're just collecting data.  It's really -- I mean, like, they -- they asked us not to, um, [LIPSMACK] like, get paid for it but --
L:  Oh, so you are just doing this out of the kindness of your heart? 
R:  Oh, yeah, and, I mean, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] [LAUGH]  I mean, like, I -- I -- I know people who are working on the project and so they need -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- they need people.
L:  Ahah.
R:  How'd you -- how'd you hear about it?
