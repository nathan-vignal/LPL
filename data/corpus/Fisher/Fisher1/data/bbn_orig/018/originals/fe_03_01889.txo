R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is Debby Sower[?].
L:  Well my name is Jim Crawford.  I live in Indianapolis, Indiana.
R:  I live in Augusta, Kansas, which is east of Wichita, Kansas.
L:  Okay. [LIPSMACK]
R:  And our subject is family.
L:  Yes.
R:  Well, my family means the world to me. [LAUGH]
L:  So does mine.
R:  I'm married, um, been married nineteen years, have an eighteen year old son and a sixteen year old daughter.  And this is my first marriage, my husband's second marriage, his first marriage was only like a year long. [LIPSMACK] And I have a boy and a girl.  Have a dog. [LAUGH] I don't know what all we're supposed to say.
L:  [MN]
R:  [MN]
L:  This is only the second call.  I did one yesterday on how com- -- how I felt about computers in education.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I talked all about my family in that one, too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I've been married, wow, twenty eight years.
R:  Wow.
L:  I have five children.  And I've devoted my life to my children.  They are ... 
R:  Your world. [LAUGH]
L:  My world.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have a twenty six year old son, who just finished medical school.
R:  Wow.
L:  He just got married.  He lives, [MN] he's a captain of the air force, he's a, he's stationed at, ah, [several inaudible words] air force base with, um, I'm sure you're gonna, ah, that's about a mile and a half from Fort Walton Beach in Florida.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Somebody has to take that duty.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  So he didn't, he didn't have to go over to Iraq or anything?
L:  No, and we were, we were grateful for that.
R:  Oh, thank god, yes.  No kidding.  
L:  [MN]
R:  That's my son is just now talking about going into the army, and, when he first started talking about it, I wasn't very thrilled about it, but now that the war's pretty much over, I'm all for it. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] I understand how you feel.
R:  I think it would, I think it would be very, very, very very beneficial to him, um, I'm sure as you know having children of your own, the kids these days, and, just seem to have no respect for anybody or anything, and, I think the army or, any type of military I think would do him a lot of good.  
L:  I think so too.
R:  [MN] Did it help your son a lot?
L:  [MN] He was, I've had, I had five of them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And --
R:  He was probably one of your easier ones.
L:  He was such a good child, a good person that, it wasn't even realistic.
R:  That's how our daughter is.
L:  I mean, he would come home from college, and, and lecture his brothers and sisters about, "Dad works hard, you should respect him".
R:  Aw.
L:  Uh, he'd make them go to church, when he came home from college with him --
R:  How neat.
L:  -- ah, it was, like I said, he's not even reality. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's wonderful.
L:  He went to college on a, on a graduate school, on a full ride, half academic and half athletic.  He swam division one athletics for four years, and still, well, his freshman year he had a, playing soccer he got a full con- he had a concussion and was taken to the hospital --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  -- in an ambulance.  And, he was devastated, because he got one B.
R:  Oh, gosh. [LAUGH] So he's a perfectionist on top of everything else.
L:  Yeah, he was.  He was, ah, really from talking up to his coaches afterwards, and the coaches that competed against him --
R:  Mhm.
L:  They said, "The thing that we loved about that kid was, if you look at him, at how big he was" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- "and how strong he was, there was no way that kid could swim that fast". [LAUGH]
R:  Isn't that amazing?
L:  There was no way in the world he could go, be that fast.
R:  Gosh.
L:  But it was just, you talk about ul- -- the ultimate overachiever.
R:  That's great.
L:  So --
R:  So what are your other children doing?  And how old are they?
L:  Now my second son is twenty four years old, his name is Keith.  Um, he's just finishing graduate school.  He ah, he went to the same school as my oldest son.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which is Xavier University in Cincinnati.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, after that, he went to graduate school and he had a, he had a full ride in there as a, um, he wants to be a coach.
R:  Oh.
L:  He got a graduate assistant position and his graduate assistant was the assistant managing women's swimming coach at De Pawl[?] University.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Which is a, it's De Pawl with a W., it's a small, private, division three school, which means --
R:  I've heard of it before, I don't know why, but I have heard of it. [PAUSE]
L:  But --
R:  So he's the assistant swim coach there?
L:  Right.  For two years when he was, and for that, he got to go to graduate school for free, and they gave him a little cottage to live in, and they paid him.  He could eat in the school cafeteria for free, and they gave him five hundred dollars to live on.
R:  Wow.
L:  And actually, you know to you and I five hundred dollars is nothing, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he said, after being a student, an undergraduate student with no money, he thought five hundred dollars, he was rich.
R:  No kidding. [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  Ah, my third child is, um, a daughter, she's twenty one, her name is Kristen.
R:  So you have all K's?
L:  Yes.
R:  That's, we have K's too.  My husband is Kurt with a K., and then both of my kids are Kristofer[?] and Kayla, [NOISE] with K's.
L:  That third, that Kayla, I've never heard of that one.
R:  [NOISE] Really?  Can you hang on just one quick second?
L:  Sure.
R:  Hello? [NOISE]
L:  I'll just keep talking so they get their money's worth.  Kristen is, um, just graduating, is graduating in May, and, um, she wants to go to law school.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  She, um, she, ah, really is a real ultimate achiever.  She went to Xavier, and was a walk on as a swimmer, and after two years her junior, she was elected captain of the team, and now she's on scholarship.  She's graduating [inaudible] in her grades in college --
R:  Can I call you back in just one second? 
L:  -- are -- 
R:  Okay, I'll call you right back.
L:  -- are much, much better. 
R:  Sorry about that, that was my doctor's office [LAUGH] .  I'm getting --
L:  Okay.  I, I just kept talking to give them their money's worth.
R:  Okay.
L:  It was like I was talking to you, so I'm sure they'll be happy.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] Yeah.  I'm getting ready to have back surgery, and that was them calling back.
L:  Ow.
R:  Okay, so your daughter is Kristen?
L:  Kristen, right.
R:  Okay.
L:  Kristen's graduating from Xavier also, you know, wow, gonna be next month.
R:  Goodness.
L:  She, um, she's even more of an overachiever than her older brother.
R:  Really?
L:  She, um, she's a criminal justice major, and she's graduating with a three five one G.P.A., which is much higher than the grades she ever got in college.  And I asked her, I said, "Well, is this easier?"  She says, "Oh, no dad, it's much harder, but when you're taking courses you're interested in, it's easy to study".  And she was also a swimmer too.  She walked on, mostly because the coach knew the bloodlines, and knew her two older brothers.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And looked at this big girl.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And figured, "Well heck, I'll just let her walk on, it's not gonna cost me anything.  And besides, both brothers swam for me".
R:  Mhm.
L:  Junior year, she was elected captain of the team, and he put her on scholarship.
R:  Wow.
L:  Now she's graduating with three five, and she's probably gonna go to Indiana University law school.
R:  That's great.  That, and then, you have two other ones besides those two?
L:  Right.  Third, the fourth, my third son, and his name is Kyle, and he's a sophomore, again at Xavier University.  He's taking, um, information systems, which is computer science with a business slant. [MN]
R:  Uh-huh.  Is he there on scholarship also, or ...
L:  Well, he's the one that, of the, the interesting thing this is, he was the one that didn't go there on athletic scholarship.  He had a half academic scholarship.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And advice I can give you, people think that if you go to school and play athletics, it's gonna hurt you.  I found it the other way around.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I found the athletes stay disciplined.  The older three were all on athletic scholarships, and they went, basically with half academic and half athletic scholarships.  And they were busy and they were disciplined.  This guy, [MN] I think he has too much time on his hands.
R:  [LAUGH] That's what I think happened to my, our son.  Too much time on his hands.
L:  And, um, he had an academic scholarship which he lost, because his, he al- almost flunked out his freshman year.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  He salvaged that, but his, his grades weren't high enough to keep his academic scholarship.
R:  Oh.  So, are, has he picked his grades up now and doing better?
L:  Oh, they're up.
R:  Are they?
L:  But, um, ...
R:  Did he just, play too much his freshman year, or ...
L:  He was really enjoying himself.
R:  Was he?  Did he get involved in the alcohol and everything? [LAUGH] [MN] That's my --
