R:  No.
L:  Well, um, I was told we're supposed to talk about education.
R:  Ahah. 
L:  But I was also told that it's just to, uh, listen to our language style. [LAUGH]
R:  Ho.  Wow!  So the topic is does computer harm education.

L:  [LAUGH] Are you close to a beach? 
R:  Mm, no, Ma'am.
L:  No.  Oh.
R:  No, we're -- I'm at -- well, eighty eight miles.  If you consider that close, then that's close.
L:  Oh.
R:  But for the -- other than that it's just, you know, land, that's it -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, like, lakes and stuff.
L:  Yeah, to me eighty eight would be close. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] well, I don't like to drive that far, so ...

R:  Yes, Ma'am.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I took it -- um, I took accounting and then I was at the Votech when I was, like, dual enrollment in high school and I was, like, "I think this is what I want to be".  
L:  [MN]
R:  Even though it was stressing me out, I loved it.
L:  Well, good.
R:  I really did.
L:  That's so nice you can find something when you're young that you know you already like.
R:  Yeah, [inaudible] and I've been hooked on school ever since.

L:  Well, that's just great.  I bet you're going to be a huge success.
R:  I hope so. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  All this work for nothing wouldn't be right.
L:  [LAUGH] No.  That won't happen.
R:  I know.  I hope so. [NOISE]
L:  This is kind of interesting, isn't it, they ask you where you were born and everything?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they do.  Oh.  I wonder how they do this.  Do we get paid for this?
L:  Yeah, you get paid ten dollars for this. [LAUGH]
R:  Do you? 
L:  Yeah, that's what they said. [LAUGH]
R:  What, each phone call and then they send you somebody -- they send you a cheque or something?
L:  Ahah.
R:  Wow! 
L:  How is that for easy money?  That's easier than the library, isn't it? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Do you think we can talk tomorrow, too? [LAUGH]
R:  I think so, too.

R:  Yeah, I stay with my grandma.  I'm a grandma's baby.
L:  Oh.  So you had to toe the line for grandma, huh?
R:  Yes, Ma'am. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I'm a grandma's baby.  I don't want to leave, really, but, you know, I've got to eventually leave.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I go to, um, sort of, like, a university right now but in college, I commute to college.
L:  Oh, so you're living with grandma now and then going to college?
R:  Yeah.  I didn't want to leave.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's okay.
R:  I mean, I got accepted to, like, the Universities of Miami and Tampa and stuff, but then I get to [inaudible] and I didn't want to go.
L:  Oh, that's sweet.
R:  So I stay home with my grandma. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm, that's sweet.
R:  Yeah, real sweet. [inaudible]
L:  My -- my boys weren't like that.  I think they wanted to get away from me. [LAUGH]
R:  At first I was, like, that, I wanted to get away, but then it just, I don't know, I just didn't want to leave.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  I really didn't want to leave.  So how much do we get paid for the little, um, things on line, that we -- no, we don't talk, they just tape, you know.
L:  Well, you know, I haven't -- I don't know anything about that.  I haven't -- have you done some of that? 
R:  Yeah, well, you just press buttons on the, um, phone.
L:  I haven't done that.
R:  I did that the night before, um, they connected me to you.
L:  Oh.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, I didn't get that. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Wow! 
L:  I'm going to have to look into that. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm going to see how long I can do this because there might be some good money.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, just might.
L:  Yeah.  I'm going have to look at this, too.
R:  I know I just signed up for something yesterday.  I was, like, "Okay, whatever", and [LAUGH] because it was, like, just looking for my, um, opportunities and stuff -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- extra money on the side -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to help out my grandma and stuff, so, you know, anything for grandma.
L:  I bet grandma's proud of you, isn't she? 
R:  I think she is.
L:  Oh, I bet she is. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I'd be proud of you if you were my daughter. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  I just had boys. [LAUGH]

L:  Yeah, this is fun.
R:  Yeah, you get to meet people from over to -- way from everywhere, I guess. 
L:  Yeah, I guess so.
R:  And I know everybody's not going to stay on that conversation thing [MN] they're talking about, the [inaudible] about the little education or something. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know they know better than that.
L:  Well, you know, I think it -- it's just kind of get -- to get people to talking -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- about whatever, so they can listen to how we talk. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You sound like this other lady I used to work with at Burger King.  She was, like, the manager there.  She was so nice.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh. 
R:  She was, like, a grandma.
L:  Yeah.  I would be, like, your grandma, I guess. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No, I'm not that old.  I'll be, like, your mother. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, because my mum's, like, um, forty, something like forty, forty one, forty one or forty two, because I'm twenty one.
L:  You're twenty one? 
R:  Yes, Ma'am.
L:  Oh, my boys are, uh, eighteen and twenty.
R:  Are -- are you serious?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Wow! [NOISE] I thought they would be something like twenty, twenty five. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] It just seems like they were babies yesterday.  Life just goes so fast.
R:  Yeah, life does.  I know tonight I gotta do, like, seven term papers. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  I'm going to get my brother to help me read this stuff.  There's, like, seven, plus I got, like, an exam on Friday.
L:  Oh.  
R:  So, like, you know.
L:  So y- your brother helps you out, huh?
R:  I'm going to try to see if he could, because he play football so I really don't know.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] He might just want to come home, take a bath and go to bed or something --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- knowing him.
L:  So, do you have a boyfriend? 
R:  Me? 
L:  Ahah.

R:  He's nice.
L:  Mm, good.  He better be nice to you or I'll beat him up.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow!  This is so neat.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- 
L:  You know, that's funny, you know, I've signed up for things before and sometimes you never get called or sometimes you rarely get called.
R:  Ahah.
L:  But we both got -- got called the first day.  That's really interesting.
R:  I think they're going to call every day that you put, like, whatever day you can do it, [inaudible] I put every day down on mine.
L:  Oh.
R:  That's why -- 
L:  Did you put more than one time -- one telephone time per day? 
R:  Ahah.  That's what I did.  I don't know how many times they going to do it.
L:  Oh.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Is thi- -- is this your first call you said, right?
