R:  Hi, my name is Joyce.
L:  Hello Joyce, my name is Brian.
R:  Ah, okay.  And, ah, what does family mean to you?
L:  Family means to me, let's see.  Well I come from an Italian background --
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I'm one of three boys.  Ah, grown, born, grown up in the suburbs of Philadelphia.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] Ah, worked all my life.  Watched my father work himself practically to death.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] didn't have the chance to uh, have any children yet myself.  Thirty eight years old.
R:  Mhm.
L:  How about yourself? [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, I have ah, actually, I have two so-, I have three sons, I have two sons at home, two teenage sons, um, I'm an old mother, as my last son was born when I was ah, forty years old.  I'm fifty five now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I have a fifteen year old and a seventeen year old son and a thirty year old son, so, so tho- -- that, that's family to me, but also I think of my extended family.  Um, don't have any, no, no grandparents left, but I have a dear old aunt who is ah, ninety years old, [MN] who -- 
L:  Wow, God bless her.
R:  Yeah, yeah, and so she's real important to us, and so, I think about all that extended family, and um, yeah, cousins, I, we're kind of a small family.  You say you come from an Italian family.  Is it, ah, do you have a lot of, ah, aunts and uncles, or ...
L:  Yes I do, I have um, oh my mother's side we have um, oh, boy, five, six, seven, scattered all over the nation.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, my father's side, um, there's his brother, and a couple associated uncles from the depression back in the day.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  When, um, [LIPSMACK] when more than one family would occupy a house.  Actually, kind of like the Irish ritual.
R:  Sure, sure. 
L:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, actually, known ever since I was a child.  That they're, they're actually blood, and I've never had to actually, you know, rely on them for anything, but I, I still do keep in touch with them.
R:  Right, right.  And you, you live the same place you grew up in Philadelphia?
L:  Yes I am.  Right now, currently, yes I am.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Do you think that's important as far as keeping clo- -- family ties?  Do you think it's your family that's kept you close there, or ...
L:  Um, actually I would say my, my situation, my present situation at the time as far as with work and, um, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and my mother.  Ah, basically I moved back in with my mother to help her out.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, my father recently passed away, left a, a major trucking company in her hands.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  My mother's seventy years old, basically didn't have a clue about it.
R:  So, so you're, you're the one who, now, now did you said you have, how many siblings? 
L:  I have, I had, well, um, two other brothers, two older brothers.  I was, I was the baby.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, my eldest brother recently passed away about ah, two, three years ago.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  And my --
R:  And he must have been young.
L:  Pardon?
R:  He must have been very young then.
L:  Actually, he's three years older than me.  He would be, what, forty one now.
R:  Way, way too young to die.
L:  Well, he had some complications.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But that, that happens, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  It's, um, just some things you know, parents can't do some things, you really can't control of.  And --
R:  Right.
L:  -- he spent his life the way he wanted to.
R:  Ah, ah.  So -- 
L:  But, um, but my brother --
R:  But obviously you, your family's very close to you, very important to you if you, you and your mum are to be together now.
L:  I, I would say yes, but you get to that point in your life where it really, you know, you wish you weren't in the situation you're in.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I understand that too, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes 'cause I lived many years away from, I was born and raised in Cleveland, and I lived from the time I was eighteen until, oh gosh, till I was forty eight, forty nine, about six years ago.  I, I did not live, ah, close to my family, and now ah, and then when my, actually when my mother got, became ill, ah, we moved close to my family, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, so I was here, and she passed away a couple of years ago, but it was ah, good to be, good to be close, close here when, you know, ah, during that time when -- 
L:  Yes indeed.  I, I definitely agree with you.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But I, I found that, that my years that family is more or less tighter when they're further away. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well I consider, I consider my sister my best friend.  I have only one sister, and, and we've never lived in the same town since we've been adults.  She lives in Washington, and yet ah, we ta- --
L:  State or D.C.? 
R:  Washington D.C.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, ah, we probably talk on the phone three or four times a week, and, ah, now of course with email, we email each other too, but if, ah, I, yeah, so far as, ah, she's probably the one person, the person I depend on the most, ah, besides my husband.  But you know, but I mean in terms of a blood relative, um, you know.
L:  Is she younger or older than you?
R:  She's older, she's three years older than I am.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, you know, like I said that, she's, she's very, very important to me, and, um, you know --
L:  She --
R:  -- as are, as are my children.  Yeah, yeah, they're, they're really an important part.  But I also think that, you know, the extended family of, ah, cousins and, ah, aunts and uncles and all of them have been very important, even though we haven't had a, a, a lot, ah, we, neither of us, neither of my parents were from big families.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, you know, that- are you Ital- are you a hundred, are you Italian on both sides of your family? 
L:  No, my father screwed up the bloodline.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, my mother is, um, partially Dutch and Irish.
R:  Ah, ah, how, how good.
L:  You know but, um, it, it, it can be a very volatile mixture.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Well I think, I think ethnicity in family is always interesting, because I thought yeah, my, my mother was Ukrainian and my father was a German, and I know that, you know my mother was the first person in her family, all the other, ah, her sister married a, a Ukrainian and you know, that, that whole idea of if you marry the same ethnic group, and I know, yeah, you know that --
L:  Yeah, yeah well we are the melting pot, I think that's went out, that went out the window a long time ago.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right, yeah.  Certainly, certainly the kids, you know, and then they have, you know, my husband's from several different ethnic groups, so then yeah, yeah what happens when you ah, you know, what does it mean?  But yeah, the whole old idea of what family was when um, when there was a single ethnic group was, is kind of interesting, and that whole kind of mixture of, ah, customs and traditions that you find when you have --
L:  Does all your children still live with you?
R:  Ah, my thirty year old is actually on the west coast.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So he's, uh, he's on his own.  Ah, I'm wait- waiting for his grandchildren there, but I think it's gonna be a while.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He's not married and, ah, doesn't show any signs of getting married, married for a while.  So I, uh, yeah, you know, always, always would have loved to have had a daughter, and so I figure I have to wait for a granddaughter now. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, the granddaughter pressure, I hate that.
R:  [MN] But, um, yeah, but then the other one, the other two are here, here at home, and yeah, um, one is at junior high school, ah, starting to think about college and, and going off, and all of those things.  But, ah, like I said, so, so I think that that, that whole issue -- what do you think about the whole idea that, that, ah, of family in terms of, ah, oh, how, how would, I guess that, that whole idea that you choose people who, ah, choose their family, you know say well, well the family that I was born into as opposed to my friends, who become family.  Do you think friends can ever become as close as family? 
L:  Oh, definitely.  Most, most, most, ah, definitely.  There's no doubt about that.  Um, in the family, in the Italian family kind of state of thinking, um, I, I hate to put it like this, but it's just a basic generalization that water is thicker than blood.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, the fact is that very easily to accept someone as ah, a family member, from an outs- outside family of course, and ah, actually just treat them better, or if not, um, as your own.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, personally I, I, I take people for their face value.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, as long as there's not any kinda ulterior motive involved then, ah, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- take them for what they're worth.  Um, like, like I explained, my, you know, my father growing up in the, in the depression, um, they, they shared the house and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the, a guy, basically a stranger, I consider him my uncle to this day.
R:  Ah, yeah, yeah.
L:  And, ah, oh my God, he had, ah, nine, ten, eleven kids.
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  So, all them are, you know, [LAUGH] I, I have a problem when it, what the official label is of someone who's your uncle --
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  -- and their offspring have offspring.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  So one separated, or whatever that is.
R:  Yeah, yeah, keeps going.
L:  Oh, my God, it's up there in the hundreds.
R:  Oh, I bet.  I bet.
L:  You know, and maybe if I, if I hear from them maybe once or twice a year, I'm lucky.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  But it's always a good sign, I mean like with, especially with email, we keep in touch.
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know?
R:  Well, it, it's kind of, I think it's interesting, in terms of, of especially the closest part of your family, I was just thinking when you were talking about it, about being, you know, sometimes I think we're at our best and we're at our worst with our family.  You know, you kind of, those are the times where ah, you know, you say things to your family that you probably wouldn't say to other, to other people. [LAUGH] You know, you --
L:  Well, I, I say things that I wouldn't to other people that I wouldn't tell my family.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  Um, personally it's just, I, I wear my emotions on my sleeve and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't hold nothing back.
R:  Ah.  Ah.
L:  And sometimes I can be a Godsend or I could be hell.
R:  I, I bet.  Yeah.
L:  You know?  Like it could be, could be the best of both worlds or it could be the worst of all.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, and that's it's, that's absolutely insane.  Um, [LIPSMACK] ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah.
L:  It's very, very hard to explain in ten minutes, that's for sure.
R:  Oh, it is, it is.
L:  You know?
R:  I think, yeah and I --
L:  So how long have you been married, if you don't mind me asking?
R:  I have been married for, ah, --
