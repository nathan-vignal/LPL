L:  Hi.  My name is Carol.
R:  Uh, this is Mary.  How --
L:  Hi, Mary.
R:  How are you doing? 
L:  Fine.  This is the strangest thing.  Have you done one of these calls before?
R:  Uh, yes, I've done two of them.
L:  Oh.  Well, this is just the weirdest thing I've been around, but okay, here we go.
R:  [LAUGH] Uh, matter of fact I've missed I don't know how many phone calls.  Uh, I think I've missed, like, four or five this week already. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, this is so interesting.  Ah, well, anyway, so where are you today? 
R:  In Mississippi.
L:  Oh, I'm in Texas, so -- 
R:  Oh.  That's who I spoke with the last time I talked, a lady in Texas.  
L:  Uh-huh.  Fine.
R:  She was right out of Houston, Texas. [MN]
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, I'm out of Dallas, so that's pretty cool.   
R:  Oh.
L:  Whatever we are doing it for, I guess it's some graduate school study or something.
R:  Right.  It's a linguistics study, I think.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, okay.
R:  I didn't quite understand what the question was.
L:  It was computers and education, do they help or hurt education.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  That was my understanding of the subject, so ... 
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh, you know, I don't -- do you have kids in school? 
R:  Ah, well, we home school and we use computers, so -- 
L:  Oh, great.
R:  -- I would say they're quite handy. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, now, I don't think that it should just be totally computers, I mean, you know, I think they need other things beside computers -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but in the world we live in now, I believe computers are very important.
L:  Oh, I do too.  I -- you know, my daughter, I have one daughter who is twenty one and she's mentally handicapped and I have another one who is in a school for kids with learning differences and -- and, um, [MN] you know, but it -- she's in high school, she's freshman in high school and they really rely, I think, too much on the internet for, like, research.  I don't think they are telling kids enough that a lot of what you find on the internet may or may not be true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and that you really have to go back and -- and do careful research, but they're only freshmen -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I guess that, you know, right now they're trying to teach them how to use the resource as opposed to, um, worrying all about, you know, dotting all the Is and crossing all the Ts.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I know my son, he is in his first year in college -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, at Mississippi State and I know he doesn't do any research except for on the internet for all of his papers and things. 
L:  Mm.
R:  Uh, sometimes you wonder, eh, you know, what's wrong with books, [LAUGH] ah, the library. [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Well, now, he probably has access, though, on line access to all the Mississippi, ah, library.
R:  Probably so. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And it might be -- 
L:  But you're right.
R:  -- it might be the same difference but I think it's still good to know how to go and look into a book, you know, how to find things in a library.
L:  Well, absolutely, because what you find on the internet nine times out of ten is pretty surface level stuff.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  You know, and -- and if you're ever wanting to get your PhD or anything like that, not that I have one, but -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, you're going to be having to go back and do research from orig- -- even original sources -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, so are we teaching them [MN] -- from that perspective of research I do think that we are too reliant on just flipping the internet out there.
R:  Yeah.  There's another thing I think about computers, too.  I know, uh, well, when mine were in public school, which they've been out of public school for six years, I have four children, and uh, they're -- my youngest is ten and then I have one thirteen and fifteen and then the, like I said, the one, he's -- he'll be twenty in October and he's in college, but before they ever got out of public school, at least the older ones, uh, they got to the point where they didn't even write anything.  It was all, you know, um, typed on the computer -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I said, "I don't know if that's teaching them", like, good handwriting skills and, uh, things like that, because they were not required to do any writing, you know, here in our school system, so --" 
L:  Well, and with the school that my daughter goes to, that's the, uh, um, school for kids with learning differences, a lot of those kids have issues with [MN] processing information through their brain and onto paper.  It's a lot easier for them just physically because of the physicality -- I don't know what it is -- but it's a lot easier for them to sit and type a coherent sentence than it is for them to write a coherent sentence -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and the school recommends these little computers that are more or less just word processors and for some of the kids they require that they have them and carry them to class to take notes on because they have such issues with translating what they've done, so in that case the school just considers computers to be invaluable.
R:  Mm.
L:  And, uh, I know I'm -- I sat down when -- I'm a journalist, or I used to be [LAUGH] before I went into real business and I sat down when I was seven years old and typed my first story and I've never been able to do anything except --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- on a typewriter.
R:  Oh, me. 
L:  You know.  So, it was, uh -- I -- [MN] I kind of agree with you but I don't think in today's world it's -- you don't need to -- you don't need to [LAUGH] write any more. 
R:  Yeah.  If the -- I guess it's getting to be a lost art, maybe. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, the other thing I've been impressed with, too, is in my daughter's school they're not only using the computers but they're doing a lot of programming learn- learning and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're doing -- they're learning -- they've been through Excel, they've been through Word, they've been through, uh, Microsoft, um, whatever the database program is and, uh, they've also learned HTML language and written their own web sites and so I'm -- I'm real impressed --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- with what they're doing.  I hope that there's advanced classes because she's doing really well in it. 
R:  Yeah.  Well, my son is in computer engineering in school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so he does a lot of that type thing -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- plus more.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, he's way above my head, I'm afraid. [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Exactly.  Yeah.  But, uh, you know, I -- I think in a lot of ways, yeah, back to the topic, they are definitely helping because I -- number one I think they make learning more fun for the kids.  I mean it's a whole lot more fun to create a project and go cut and paste pictures and sometimes I think, though, they get so involved in the project that they miss the point.
R:  Yeah.
L:  At least that's what I've noticed with my daughter and I'm like, "Why are you doing this and why are you finding this --" 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and what -- what are you trying to communicate here?"  She'll go, "I don't know, I'm just cutting and pasting stuff". [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, goodness. [LAUGH] Oh, well.  
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Maybe somewhere they're learning something.
L:  I -- yeah, I guess. [LAUGH] Whys are tough for kids with, uh, with ADD and other issues, so, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're like, "Why?  I don't know why --" 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- I just want the grades.  Let me out of here". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, me.
L:  But, uh, I don't know, [MN] you know, so I'm -- I'm impressed, too, like, they were telling me that my older daughter, um, she just landed a job at Walmart and they have a pretty com- -- uh, comprehensive computer based learning program for people who work at Walmart, apparently.  I guess you have to learn the history of the store and the procedures and the rules and she's been making hundreds on her test they've been giving on the computer, so I think for kids who are challenged they're just wonderful.
R:  Mm.
L:  Really.
R:  I wouldn't have thought about that being at Walmart like that -- 
L:  I know.
R:  -- but you just don't ever know, do you.
L:  Everybody, you have to do it now, you know -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you can't get by without it.  What kind of school do you have? 
R:  Well, we go by the, uh, Abecker program, most of it, anyway.  Are you familiar with that?
L:  No.  Uh-uh.
R:  Well, it's in -- uh, they have a college, uh, Pensacola Christian Academy -- 
L:  Ah.
R:  -- and, uh, they do a home school program -- 
L:  I see.
R:  -- from there, plus we do a lot of extra stuff, too, that they're interested in specifically, so it works out real nicely for us.
L:  So you have a home school there? 
R:  Ahah, we do.  Mhm.
L:  I see.
R:  Our school system here got really bad, uh, I don't know, we had -- there was a lot of, um, problems with problem children and [MN] every time I'd go -- of course my oldest son, he was very intelligent and h- he, you know, he'd get through of what they were doing and the teacher would tell me, "Well, you're going to have to bring him something to do, you're going to have to find something for him to do", and I got to thinking about it because this kept on happening and also my second daughter, also, because they were having so many problems with other children, like as far as discipline problems and, you know, keeping them caught up and I got to thinking, "Well, if I'm going to have to find something for them to do, I might as well do it myself". [MN]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, uh, we ended up home schooling and it's, like I said, so far it's worked out real nicely, you know.  We had no problem him getting into college or anything, you know. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I know that was a big thing for, uh, a lot of our friends and stuff saying, "Well, how will he ever get into college", you know, but I mean college don't care, you know.  As long as you do well on your ACT test, they don't care.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Well, now, I know here in Dallas, because we live in such a big town, there are a lot of, um, uh, social activities and -- and sports and things like that, also for kids who are home schooled, so -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you do have, uh, events and things, enrichment I guess they would call it, places that you can take them.  I mean I would never be able to sit down and teach --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- my own kids, ever.
R:  Well, you think that, but you probably could. [LAUGH]
L:  No, no no.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  No, not my kids, uh-huh. 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I have the patience, um, not the patience, so -- 
R:  Well, they -- at -- at times mine have gotten, you know, uh, I don't know, it's kind of like y- you have to push, but overall I don't have to because they know what the alternative is and they were not happy in the school system.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And so, you know, they know the alternative and y- -- generally they will sit down on their own and I didn't even have to say, "Okay, this is school time", you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just they sit down and they, you know, they have certain things that they, you know, like we have a schedule -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and as long as they meet that schedule, you know, um, it's okay, but usually they're way ahead, you know.
L:  Ah, yeah.  Well, that's great.  That's just wonderful.  Yeah.  So I don't know -- I, um, -- so are you -- do you have -- do you fight over the computer or do you have just one, for example? 
R:  Well, we have three computers.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, um, --
