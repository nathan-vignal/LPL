R:  Hi? 
L:  Hi, this is -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- Margie in Idaho.
R:  I'm Cornish[?] and I'm in Philadelphia [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, great, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Oh, -- 
R:  Have you done one of these before? 
R:  Yeah, I had done one, like, last week or something. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay -- 
R:  Have you done one? 
L:  I've done -- this would be my third one.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, are -- 
R:  Um, -- 
L:  -- you, um, currently in school now? 
R:  Mhm, I'm in college right now.
L:  Are you -- so you are working every day with computers probably? 
R:  Yes, I work -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- every single day all day just about --  
L:  Yeah and -- 
R:  -- on computers --
L:  -- what do you think of them? 
R:  Um, I think they're a great tool, like, especially for research and -- and I guess my school, like on our library internet we have a database we can, um, get into, like, newspaper articles, sociological journals, like, a lot -- like different types of, um, educational journals --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- so, for a lot of my research papers I can do a lot of my research from in my room online versus, like, going to the library and even when I need to get books I can just search for my library catalogue in my room and write down the call number, so --  
L:  Oh, my --
R:  -- I guess it's beneficial [LAUGH] --
L:  That's amazing -- 
R:  -- it's an asset.  I can do all that just from sitting at my computer while even just watching TV and still, you know, and then w- maybe while I'm by the library going to class I can just pick up the books that I need -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you can place things on hold and -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- basically you can do everything from a computer nowadays and I think it's great tool.  I -- I think it also can be, like, -- like hinder because a lot of people just use, like, um, the internet recourses and --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and they don't even look at where they're getting the work from --
L:  Oh, yeah.   
R:  -- and, you know, that could be a problem, um, for the source of information how, um, credible it is.  But I try to use a mix source in books and internet, you know, -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- teachers like that nowadays. 
L:  When I was in school it was the early -- late eighties and early nineties and so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- computers were just beginning to -- to come to the surface.  In fact I -- I did a lot of my term papers on a typewriter -- on a typewriter --  
R:  Oh, wow.   
L:  -- in the library.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, to -- to, you know, hear what you can do is just amazing to me -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, because I can't even conceptualize that, although I have a computer in my home and connected to the internet on DSL and, you know, I'm -- I'm on it all the time kind of thing and, ah, amazed that my almost four year old is, ah, -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- very computer literate -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and --  
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and I think that, ah, you know, any more it's -- it's for educational value it's -- it's important.  It's not only important, it's probably critical because if someone is not computer literate -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [MN] they're gonna be -- they're gonna fall behind you know -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- even in elementary school any more.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, [MN] you know, I -- I -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] I don't -- I have a hard time seeing it as a hindrance in education with the exemption like you said, you know, finding term papers online and, um, [LIPSMACK] wasting time probably, but that's not -- you know, that is more a personal thing than it's, ah, [MN] a problem with the education system.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, and I think, um, it also is a helpful tool because even when, like, -- when I was in elementary school we had, like, -- you know, computers were different then and that was, like, ten years ago but we still had little workshops on, like, -- in our computer labs and we do, like, spelling and there was, like, math games and stuff like that so, that could be really helpful because I think it helps makes learning fun --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- cause aside from the teacher doing the game you actually have, like, these little, like, cartoon characters on the computer, like little cats and animated doings like, "Oh, yeah, you got that question right", so, --  
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- you know, it kinda have those like, um, -- you know, they have the handhelds that means you can do it at home, you have that for computers also now and I think that's helpful for kids and I think learns, um, teachers I guess good computer ethics and it's not just for, like, to be on the internet but it also can be, like, --
L:  Mm. 
R:  -- like a learning tool --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- at such a young age.  
L:  Yeah, see --  
R:  -- I think that's neat.   
L:  -- for me I don't even know about that kind of stuff because I kind, ah, like I said when I was in college it was just beginning to come into it and my son is not there yet as far as learning all that kind of stuff so that'll be new and exciting and amazing to see for me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Are -- are you studying computers?
R:  Excuse me?
L:  Are you studying computer science, or?
R:  No, I'm -- I'm thinking about being a sociology major.
L:  Oh.   
R:  Or maybe a psyche major or something like that, but even in that, like in the computers, like, even for a lot of my classes and we doing research and things like that -- like I said we do research on the internet and, um, we are have to do, like, use the programs to, um, make data tables and graphs and -- and it analyze our data for us, like it compares variables --
L:  Right.   
R:  -- and all those kinds of things. 
L:  All those statistics -- st- statistical analysis.
R:  Yeah, yeah, all that stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, like before we had to do it hand held you had to know if the computer can do everything for me [LAUGH] -- 
L:  I know [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and then tells me, like, -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- "What distance is this?" I mean looking at it, so.
L:  For me -- for me I had, um -- my degree is in political science and I did have to take a st- statistics class.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I call it sadistics because I hated it so much but, um, and it was all computer generated but, again, you know, like I said it was just the beginning of -- of everything being computerized and so we had to do both, I had to do it by hand and then I had to do it on the computer --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, ah, I can see -- definitely see the advantage to the computer.
R:  And even though not just, um, PC computers like -- like, even, like, calculators are computerized --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- like, you have the [MN] the Texas Instrument, like the TI eighty three and those kinds of things --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and there's -- I think it's, like, a TI eighty nine that, you know, how teaches are always, like, "Oh, show your work" and you don't know what the answers, like, unless you're using the calculator, well, like the TI eighty nine actually, like, shows you the step by step process of --
L:  Oh, my God.   
R:  -- so, you can easily copy that and they still not doing the work themselves --  
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and, like, you can program, like, formulas and answers that the teacher tells you to memorize into your, like, um, calculators so when you go to a test things you're supposed to like know outside you can go into a part of your calculator and the formulas are right there when they expect you --
L:  Do the professors know about this? 
R:  Um, yeah, the teachers kn- it's funny because at my high school they -- they're the ones that told us about it, they was, like, --  
L:  Ah. 
R:  -- "Yeah we all know if you're cheating but, [MN] yeah, we're are telling you about it anyway".  [LAUGH] But it's like if we really wanted to catch anybody they had on there, like, we would get in trouble, but they encourage it as a tool also because it's, like, yeah, a lot of fun just to memorize it.  But I also thought it was, like, detrimental because I'm just, like, I know this stuff but they know it by heart now. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know all that stuff and like, with us it was just like, "Oh, what does it say on my calculator I forgot that formula". [LAUGH] Right, so, ... 
L:  And did you say your -- your dorm room or your sorority is all, um,  -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- ah, you -- you can get online there? 
R:  Yeah, [NOISE], um, the way my -- my university works all the dorms -- all the off campus dorms are hooked up [NOISE] to, like, -- it's like a DSL thing, you know, we all get free internet, um, access [MN] if you have a computer in your room, like, [several inaudible words] so, I have a laptop, but I can just --
L:  You have to bring it with you? 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But there's, um, also in the dorm there's, um, -- there's computer labs so even if you don't have a computer you can go to computer lab --  
L:  Oh.   
R:  -- and everyone has a password and things and the email, everyone can have an email account so, you know, that access is right there for free, or I guess it is part of our tuition because they charge, like, a technology fee. [NOISE] 
L:  Right.
R:  But, all of this is at my fingertips because I can just really sit in my room and do all my homework and research and papers and things like that and, [NOISE] like, not go anywhere but to class.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Wow.
R:  So, that's actually --
L:  That's amazing --
R:  -- helpful and that's a good tool and I think -- I think we have that internet access because they -- they know it's such an [inaudible] tool, but there is a lot of problems with it because people download, like, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we also have, like, tech- -- um, other, um, problems with people, like, downloading from the internet so some people download, like, pornography [NOISE] -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or movies or music --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- which are all copyrighted so, at the school -- like I think they get -- well, depending on what you, um, [LIPSMACK] download it sends things, like, the school technology office and if they come to your room and they see on there you can get in trouble.  Some people -- there's -- there's some cases at college that people have got suspended from it --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they don't know how to limit their access, which is kinda a crying shame that you want to do those things, but a lot of people it's kinda [inaudible] things they're really not look at it -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and they get in trouble.  So, I guess -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- it could be a downfall of it --  
L:  Well, you can download, like, Cazar[?] or, well, of course not any more but Napster and stuff like that --
R:  Yeah.   
L:  -- onto the computer and then use the university --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the university's server?
R:  Yeah -- 
R:  Wow.
R:  -- they use it -- like, because all -- because that is where you get your internet access from, like, I don't think you can have an alternate internet access here -- 
L:  Oh. 
R:  -- maybe, um, -- 
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- maybe through a phone line probably -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- but not through the -- like a cable network, which is much, much faster.
L:  Ahah.
R:  And, like, even -- like I have one class where, um, like my homework is posted online and I can get, um, [inaudible] copy on my computer screen lectures, you can download the lecture notes on off line --
L:  Oh, my God. 
R:  -- it's called, like, [inaudible], so, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, I don't know if you can actually, um, have a class online, like, the teacher and we all sit in our rooms, like, on the computer, but, like, homework assignments or we can hand in homework assignments through the internet and everything like that.  Even jobs nowadays you can -- you don't even have an interview or bring in your resume and cover letter like it's just like, "Oh, send it to my email" [LAUGH] --  
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and it is just like really just based on you whatever you wrote without them even seeing you and to, like, to actually want you to come in and maybe -- or, like I even got hired one time just from being -- I'm like, "They don't even know what I look like" [LAUGH] --  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- or, I could be a child who stole, like, my big sister's -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- resume cover letter, but, so that's -- 
R:  Wow -- 
R:  -- crazy.
L:  -- that's amazing.  Well, then it sounds like it's a very beneficial tool --  
R:  Yeah --  
L:  -- Computers, I mean, ah, --
R:  -- it's really just what you do with it. 
L:  That's amazing [LIPSMACK].  Well, I look forward to -- to, ah -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- exploring that more when my son gets into school.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because we just -- it's all just fun right now, you know, you know, all my internet access is, well, you know, it's a little bit of this online --
