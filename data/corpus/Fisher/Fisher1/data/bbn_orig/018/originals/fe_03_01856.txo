R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  How's it going?
L:  Good, good, thanks.
R:  My name is Shan.
L:  My name is Heun[?], Korean name.
R:  Okay.  Ah, --
L:  So we are supposed to talk about education?
R:  Yes.
L:  But what aspect of education are we supposed to talk about?  I missed it, I just missed it.
R:  Um, she said -- ah, "How computers affect education in the classroom, does it make for a, um, more advanced learning process, or, um, is it kind of slightly a handicap" or something like that.
L:  Okay, I see.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, right.
R:  Um, basically my thoughts on the matter are if computers are overused in the classroom, especially from a young age, then they have the possibility of hurting the child's, um, cognitive skills as far as, you know, being able to spell words correctly, rather than, you know, like a spell check which all -- will check the words, kid's words.  Or, just act- like, literacy in general, because of the fact that, you know, a lot of computer programs aimed at children aren't really geared towards, um, critical thinking or, or, um, extensive reading, it's just point and click, or small problem solving skills, you know.
L:  Right.  But, um, but, um, I mean, for example the internet has provided a lot of, you know, new information. 
R:  Oh, definitely.  I, I don't disagree with that at all.
L:  So it's got a lot of -- a lot, a lot of benefits as well.
R:  Yeah, there are --
L:  You, you have a good point, you have a good point, but um, depending on what kind of subs- what kind of subjects you are teaching.
R:  Mhm.
L:  For example, like in teaching foreign languages, you know, um, it's, it is hard to interact with the native speaker.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But by having the internet access, or, you know, some CD rom programs --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- students might be able to, you know, be exposed to the target language more easily --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- without paying much -- without travelling to the target country.
R:  Yeah.  Well, um, I guess what my point is, there has to be that balance between, um, the teacher and the computer.  Um, using the computer more as the tool and a supplement for the education, rather than trying to replace the teacher.
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  You know, that --
L:  -- that's true.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Right.  There should be some human, you know, subjectivity --
R:  Definitely.
L:  Human touch, you know.
R:  Definitely.
L:  Right.
R:  If you lose the human element of learning, then you, you definitely detract from the overall benefit of the education.
L:  Right.
R:  You can sort of become --
L:  I cannot really hear you, are you watching something on TV, or --
R:  Oh, no, no, I'm, I'm just, ah, -- my house has, um, a loud echo.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, hardwood floors.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.
R:  Is that better?  Um, ...
L:  Yes, now it's better, much better.
R:  Okay.
L:  Okay.
R:  But, um, yeah, I definitely think that computers are a great thing as far as, um, the amount of information that is available through the computer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, the ease of use of a computer.  I mean, they're so much more interac- ah, interactive and user friendly now than they were when, say, I was a kid, you know, back in the days of the, the Tandys and the Radio Shacks and the Commodores and things like that.  So, it definitely helped me in a small way back then, and I can see definitely that without computers right now my education would be fairly limited as far as the resources that I'd have, you know.
L:  Are you a stu- student now, or ...?
R:  Yes, yes, I am.
L:  Okay.  Where are you studying?  What are you studying?
R:  Um, I'm studying my generals right now, I'm getting ready to finish them in another semester, and then I'm going to study film making.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I, I heard that people in communication or film making, they also use computer a lot, like computer software programs a lot, right?
R:  Definitely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Especially -- especially, um, since a lot of movies are made digitally now.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm doing graduate studies in education now, especially in language -- applied linguistics --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so teaching for the languages in a classroom setting, you know, has been affected -- influenced a lot by computer technology as well.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it plays very important role in, in our computer technology.  Like distribution of, you know, CD roms to each classroom.
R:  Mhm.  So, um, when -- English is your second language, correct?
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  Okay.  Um, and when you learned English, did you use, ah, computers a lot in your education of English, or were you exposed to it more through, um, social interaction, um, to the classroom, or say through cassette tapes, or did you travel abroad to learn it?
L:  Well, you know, um, reading news articles or, you know, or for ed- obtaining information about English speaking culture and countries -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on the internet.  That might be the easiest and cheapest way of, you know, learning or practising the language.
R:  Yes.
L:  Compared to travelling abroad or having a native speaking teacher around.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- but when I was learning English, um, I did some chattings on the internet, or, you know, reading news articles on the internet.  But other than that, not as actively as many, you know, young children are doing nowadays.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It wasn't like a -- mostly [inaudible] not the older mores.  But nowadays many programs have, you know, interactive, older, you know, practise -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with the computer programs thanks to, you know, high technology nowadays.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, I mean, computer -- you know, has a lot of benefits, you know, without charging --
R:  Oh, I --
L:  -- too much, you know.
R:  Yes, absolutely.
L:  In terms of time and finance.
R:  I love, um, getting on the internet to do research because of the ease of being able to find it, rather than, um, spending days and weeks inside of a library doing that.
L:  Yeah, I heard about that kind of a story, a lot of college students --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- rather than go to the library and do their own research, they just go on to the internet web search engine and type up their, you know, their paper topic, and then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just, you know, gather some information or just copy part of the papers available on the internet, which is not ethical at all, in my opinion.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That aspect ... hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Oh, yeah.  So in that aspect it's not necessarily positive, you know.
R:  True, very true.  Um, it definitely makes a person a little bit lazier, um, but at the same time it provides more than what would be available in the hard copy in your library, because you, you get to draw off of, um, information from around the world, rather than just what's available in your local library.
L:  Right.  But the issue is, you know, many students just copy --
R:  Oh, yes, yes.
L:  -- a piece of, you know, papers available on the internet, rather than, um, they write their papers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- based on their own deflections or their own thinking after --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- their, you know, reading, extensive reading in the library.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Even college students, I mean, university should be the place where people, you know, have to learn, you know, do -- how to do research, or --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- how to --
R:  Well, that, that would definitely fall into one of the pitfalls of ease of computer use and the widespread availability of it, but, you know, that, that's definitely a self judgment call as far as, um, policing and all that.  I mean, um, you can't really, ah, what's the -- what am in trying to say here?  Ah, you can definitely hold a person accountable for that, but ultimately it is up to that person themselves whether they're -- are going to, um, put in the effort to do it for themselves, their research and, um, the reading and the extensive, ah, absorption of the material to formulate their own thoughts on the topic, you know.  Ah, that's one thing that a lot of universities don't really teach, is, you know, how to effectively research a topic, um, that I think it's definitely left up to the students in a lot of ways for a lot of years definitely
