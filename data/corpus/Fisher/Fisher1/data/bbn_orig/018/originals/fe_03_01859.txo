L:  Hi, this is Kim. 
R:  Oh, hi, I'm Anne.
L:  Anne.  Hi, Anne.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  Is this your first call?
R:  Yes, it is.  Is it yours?
L:  Um, no, I did the same call earlier today.
R:  Oh, okay.  So you have an idea of what we're supposed to do? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, kinda.  I didn't get any feedback so I don't know, but I guess we're supposed to be discussing computers in -- well, yeah.  Computers in education, if it helps or if it's harmful.
R:  If it's helpful or harmful?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would definitely say helpful.  What do you think?
L:  Oh, I would definitely say helpful too.  Most definitely.  'Cause, I don't know how, unless -- it's kind of a dumb question, I think -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because I don't know how it could really be harmful, because our society is run by computer.  I mean, you know, we have computers in everything now.  Everything's computerized.  So, I don't -- you know, if you don't have education then you're not going to understand how to do that, and, um, I don't see how education about computers could be harmful.
R:  I guess it could be harmful in one way, if you start them too young, like I know, um, when I went through most of my college years --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I typed my papers.  So I had to actually --
L:  Right.
R:  -- know how to spell, I had to actually [LAUGH] know how to do the punctuation -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and see, now days, it's starting even in fourth grade some schools have them actually handing in, you know, they can use the word processors, they're using computers, and the spell check is checking it for them, and they even have, you know, so many of them that show you your proper punctuation, you know.  And so forth --
L:  That's a good idea.  I hadn't even thought about -- excuse me [MN] sorry about that.  I hadn't even thought about that.  I was thinking, how could it be harmful, but yeah, you're right, 'cause it -- oh, [MN] sorry, I had another sneeze there.
R:  [LAUGH] That's okay.
L:  Um, it's allergies.  You know, [MN] goodness it's allergies.  Anyway, um, I didn't -- I hadn't really thought about how it could be harmful, but yeah, you're right, it takes all the work out of it for them -- I have, um, preschoolers and they have a computer in their classroom.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Now, I'm sure they don't -- they don't, they don't use any kind of, um, you know, word processing, any kind of, you know, processing, um, software, but they, um, they play on the computer.  They have two computers and they're on it regularly, and my children know how to control a mouse and stuff, and that's not from learning at home, 'cause I'm really careful and I don't like them on the computer because they can mess about.  But they -- but when I occasionally let them play a toddler game or something, they already know how to control the mouse and how to click and stuff.  Which is amazing, 'cause they've learned that in, in pre ki- preschool.  You know, and just --
R:  Well, I have to say even that we -- 'cause we live in such a, ah, computer age and they see it all around, and even the video games and stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my son is thirteen, and I home school my children.  
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I don't know, I don't know a lot about computers, that's something that I, I'm actually planning to send him for some computer courses --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but just over the years, just having the computer in the home and, and just little bit that we've taught him, that he's picked up from here and there, um, he's amazing, what he figures out himself.  So I guess --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sometimes, um, you know, it causes them to think more --
L:  Right.
R:  -- makes them a little bit more, um, you know, um, electronical minded, you know.
L:  It seems like kids are smarter these days too --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't know why.  They have, I guess they have so many -- so much more, um, opportunity than we have, and, um, you know, so much -- when we, we learned, we did everything by hand and, you know, we didn't have -- we didn't even use calculators, you know, really.
R:  Right.
L:  It was a treat to use calculators.  And now they're required to have a calculator in math class.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or at least mine is.  See, mine go to public school.  I've got, um, I've got twins that are in preschool, and then I've got a, um, sixteen year old who just turned sixteen, he's in tenth grade, and so he's had a lot of computer classes, um, he's had computer, um, oh, computer applications, and all that stuff, and he knows the, um, Powerpoint, and the just regular basic classes in high school, you know, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- junior high and high school, so he's been doing Powerpoint for two years, Excel, um, you know, MS Word, um, Publisher, I mean, he can devise a web site, he devised two web sites, it's been almost two years since he did that, so -- and knows enough to help -- and that's not even really taking any special classes, that's just what they basically teach them.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it's amazing what they learn.  Um, I know that my, my, um, library here, where I live, um, they offer free classes.  You might think that's something you'd think about was for your kids, but um, I live in Tulsa, which is, you know, a big city, and so pretty good size and they offer, um, free computer classes at the library, and they have, um, MS Word and they have the different, you know, intro, intermediate, advanced.  They have Excel, um, they offer, um, Publisher and, um, all the different software programs, um, through our library, free.  You know, as a service and stuff.  And I've been taking some classes through that, because I've been self taught, and I'm just, you know, when I use my, um, software at work, my, um, word processing software, I do everything the long way, you know, like when I go on to do edit or whatever, I copy and paste and that kind of thing, I did it the long way instead of easily clicking on the icons and doing it the way they actually teach you in school.
R:  Right.
L:  So, anyway --
R:  Yeah, I know, I need to learn more.  My husband had, um, had, you know, was -- actually went to some of those crash courses where you go for two days.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, and he learned quite a bit and taught us some, but, um, I need, I need to really better myself as far as computers, especially for teaching the kids.
L:  Right, exactly. 
R:  But I live here -- I live in Chicago, so we do have a lot of resources available, but we're --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- kind of waiting to the summer before we, um, stick on anything like that, so we're just working on the general academics right now.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, although we -- I do use my computer in my home schooling, I have a phonics program -- 
L:  Yep.
R:  -- because I have, um, all the different ages, I have a -- I have a two year old and then I have a -- one that's seven, and she's in second grade, and then my, um, nine year old is in fourth grade, and my son is thirteen and he's in seventh.  And so --
L:  Oh, you have three that you're home schooling --
R:  Right.
L:  -- is that right?
R:  [LAUGH] So that --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- when I'm, when I'm working with one -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- or using this one, I use my computer as a very helpful resource, because I have, like, a phonics program and my seven year old will sit on there and she'll do her phonics with the computer for a while, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  And we have, um, a writing program, a creative writing program.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And like, my seventh grader, he's a boy, and he's not as -- you know, girls can talk for hours and they can write papers that you have to cut in half because they [LAUGH] put so much in them, you know, too many details --
L:  Right.
R:  -- boys, you know, I tell him, it's like, "Give me the instant replay like you do at your baseball games", you know [LAUGH] because that's the only time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he can give you word for word, you know, and every little detail.  But I have a creative writing program that they use on the, um, to Reading Rabbit they use on the computer, and he really enjoys that.  And so that's been real helpful to me, 'cause it's not like pulling teeth to get him to write something --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if I tell him to go turn on the computer and do the Reading Rabbit.
L:  Right.  Well you know, another program, um, they have that teaches you all the different -- I don't know -- are you very familiar with the word -- the, um, the word processing software like Wordperfect and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- MS Office?  You are familiar with all those?
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  Oh, okay.  I was gonna say, they have those, um, those, oh, computer professor ones --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that you can do at home, and they're really really cool.  It's just like being in a classroom, and, um, they teach you all that kind of stuff too.  But, anyway.
R:  I know.  Another way that the computer [LAUGH] actually is helpful is, um, I don't keep encyclopedias any longer.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Um, we use the Competence Encyclopedia on the CD rom, and we also do internet, ah, searches for some of our stuff so that we don't have to have, you know, two shelves of big heavy books. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Well, you're really knowledgeable about this stuff because my -- I guess I just forget that, you know, 'cause mine go to public school and I work all day, and I just forget about how much they learn, they learn so much in school that, um,-- but I'm not teaching them, you know, so, wow.  I didn't -- I hadn't -- um, that part of it.
R:  Yeah, I just -- I feel sometimes though that, you know, because I lack as far as -- like, I don't even type properly, you know, I've never had proper, you know, courses in that, and so that is the next step I want to get my son, especially.  I guess I should start the girls too so that they don't grow up with, you know, hunting and pecking, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  I'm gonna get them, um, you know, some type of software probably in the fall that will actually teach them --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, proper positioning for the keyboarding and stuff, and um, so that they can be faster and so forth --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because I do lack in that area, you know.  And ...
L:  Yeah.  Well that, that, um, the library classes, you'd be surprised, there were a lot of kids in that.  I mean, not little kids, but there were a lot of, um, ten, I mean, about half the class was, um, -- well maybe not half, maybe a third of the class was like ten year old, eleven year old, twelve, thirteen, all in that age group.  And then you had a lot of older, really really older people like, you know, my grandparents' age, um, that were, you know, having to learn computers because they were having to go back out in the workforce, maybe either they've been out of the workforce for a long time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and so they knew how important it was to, you know, be educated as far as computers go, and I just think that, you know, you, you kinda take it for granted, because I watch them sit down at the computer and start kinda working at it and there they don't know what to do.  They really don't.  They don't -- some of them don't even know how to turn it on.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, and so you just forget, you know, like, 'cause I just -- you know, I work with mine all day long, I just, you know, I forget, you know, they -- how, how it comes so easily to me but other people sit down and they're having to really totally learn this to, you know, to get a job because you can't get a job, if you don't know computer skills.  You know, I mean, depending on what the work is, but if you're trying to go for -- well, any kind of administrative kind of job of course, but if --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you're -- basically anything.
