R:  Hello.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi.  I'm Vila[?].
L:  You're Phillip?
R:  Vila.  It's a nickname.
L:  Vila, hi.  I'm Susan.
R:  Hi -- hi.  Nice to meet you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, where are you? [several inaudible words] 
L:  Um, I live in Florida.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Washington State.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, uh, education.  I was a teacher -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- [LAUGH] so, but it -- it was prior, um, computer era.
R:  Oh.  I'm a computer guy. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well, then this might be interesting.
R:  Because I actually work, uh, on the data that they collect from to study -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And build speech recognition systems and see how well we do in trans- -- building machines that transcribe these conversations.
L:  Oh, okay.  That's -- that's neat.
R:  Yeah, uh,-- 
L:  Well, I -- 
R:  So, when I first heard the topic, it's interesting you said you were a teacher -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- because I thought, you know, computers are probably irrelevant and what's really important is the teachers, you know, like the one thing that can make education good or bad is good or bad teachers.
L:  To -- to a great degree, I -- I agree with you there, but, um, I guess people have to learn how to adjust in the world and the world --
R:  Right.
L:  -- is computer literate.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I'm computer semi literate. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I've got one, I could do my email and I could, you know, search on a few things, but I know my grandchildren -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- all use them, but not to the exclusion of, um, everything else. 
R:  Right.  Yeah.  I -- I think, yeah, it's important that, you know, as I say, a kid graduating from high school is able to use a computer so in those terms I think there should be a subject of education, like something you learn to use and be proficient in. 
L:  Well, my kids -- my grandch- -- my oldest is thi- thirteen.  My youngest, uh, is -- is, like, two [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so I mean -- I mean they -- they're more, even the four and five year old, are more proficient in it than I am. 
R:  Right.  Yeah.  I mean kids pick it up really quick. 
L:  Yeah, and they -- the -- the thing that I always thought when I went to school -- 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  -- and this -- and this maybe will have something to do with, definitely with the topic, I -- I always felt that the -- where -- where education was lacking was not necessarily teaching -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but in teaching people how to find things, because the brain can just hold so much at any one time -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- so I think the computer is an excellent tool.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I never learned how to read newspapers properly -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- which was, of course, that was our main way of edu- -- of, um finding, you know, um, of communication -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- years ago because I -- I'm little bit older, obviously [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I -- the TV and television just had come, you know, when I was -- I was a kid -- 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  -- television had just come out.  It certainly wasn't the, um, information source that it is now.  So, I definitely think computers need to be in education and taught.  Um, you know, obviously the personal touch is important, but I can't see how anyone is going to make it without it.
R:  Right.  No, I -- I just, you know, I think that it's just, uh, important not that -- it's important to learn people to use computers as tools.  I was -- when I heard the question, what first came to mind was, like, you know, using computers to kind of almost replace teachers, like, -- 
L:  Oh, I didn't think of it that way.
R:  -- instead of, you know, investing in getting better teachers, to just, you know, say, "Okay, let's just get a bunch of computer labs" and, you know, that's going somehow magically make kids learn better, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Okay.  [MN] I hear you.  In that respect, yes, I think you're right.  I -- I don't think there is any substitute for a good teacher.
R:  Right, but definitely they should --
L:  I -- I didn't think of that at all.  I didn't -- see, I heard the question differently.
R:  They -- right.  I mean, I think [several inaudible words] I mean, but I've -- I've talked to people who seem to think that, you know -- 
L:  That they don't need the -- the -- the, um, human touch?
R:  Right, that, you know, that --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's the end all and be all and that somehow -- 
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- and I think as far as teaching kids to use computers as tools.
L:  Right, that's why then I think that I'm -- I'm more on your side -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- in that respect.
R:  Right, and even that I think -- 
L:  I didn't think of it at all as c- -- as computer being the -- the sole source of learning -- 
R:  Right -- 
L:  -- not at all.
R:  -- or -- or you want like a medium of learning, like replacing text books with, like, computer programs and things like that. 
L:  Basically that -- that -- it -- it could help there.
R:  You think so.
L:  But I think more -- more up to date stuff.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  You know, because you -- you can't keep up with history any more -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- through the text book.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, and [MN] probably use it as good for teaching [inaudible] and stuff like that, but I mean as far as maths we used to think when we -- when the kids took our computers -- not computers, calculators -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- that [inaudible] in a way it has hurt them, because they -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- don't have -- they may not know how to add, they depend on the calculator -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- but long as the calculator will always be around, it will help, but I still think they have to have an understanding -- 
R:  Right.  Exactly.  I mean --
L:  -- and the only way you can do that is with the personal touch.
R:  Yep.  Yep.  And the other thing I was thinking was, you know, if you -- I think there's, uh, probably going to be a big difference, um, as far as, um, rich kids and poorer kids go because with richer kids they're probably having access to a computer at home and kind of, um, you know, they will pick it up almost by themselves -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because they have been exposed to it, whereas poorer kids who don't have access to a computer at home, I think they're the ones with the most to gain from, you know, computers being taught at school.
L:  In school.  Mhm.
R:  Because -- [MN] 
L:  -- right, because then they will have the access to it -- 
R:  Right.  I mean --
L:  -- or even at a library and maybe, you know, stir their interest in it. 
R:  Right, and the public library, for example, I think is a great idea -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- because, I mean, growing up I was lucky enough to -- you know, my -- 
L:  How old are you?
R:  I'm -- [LAUGH] I'm twenty eight.
L:  Yeah.  Okay.
R:  And -- 
L:  My -- my son is thirty eight, so it gives you an idea.
R:  Right.  So, um, I -- I actually grew up to Sri Lanka, which is kind of a developing country, but I was lucky that my dad bought a computer when I was in third grade and I got hooked onto it and so, even though I didn't have exposure to computers at school, like formally, I'd play around with it at home and use it for various things and, you know, we didn't have internet or anything like that, but just -- just -- even just playing games on the thing really helped me -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- kind of get used to using one.
L:  Right, not be afraid of it.  The first time --
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  -- I ever touched one was when I -- I -- I worked, started work about nine years ago -- 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  -- at -- I [MN] not being -- I -- I stopped being a teacher when I moved down here.
R:  Right.
L:  I raised my children.  I used to be from New York. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um, I went -- I got a job in -- in sales -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but the, you know, in a very easy computer, basically, very basic -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- type thing, and, um, once I learned not to be afraid of it, that I couldn't, you know, that it could find things, then I was at ease with it -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and which helped me become more at ease with the one at home.  I still can't find, when I send something somewhere, I often can't find it and I'm surprised when I can.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know if someone would just sit down with me, I could -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, um, for what I need it -- it works.
R:  Right.
L:  As I said, I'll probably get my kids here to help me -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- my grandchildren to help me some day.
R:  Yep.  Yeah. 
L:  But, uh, no, as replacements, no, I'm -- I'm completely against that.
R:  Right.
L:  But as an addition to and an important addition to, I think that they need to have computers.
R:  And, like, do you -- how -- how early and how much do you think?
L:  How early?  As much as they are willing to bear.  I -- I said I have a [MN] a little, um, one granddaughter who's -- well, now she's five but when we went to one of the museums -- 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  -- hands on museum -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and she was able to go -- they had a computer geared toward that age -- 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and they weren't afraid of it at all.  I mean, and it was just simple things, you know, it had pictures -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, and [MN] if something that matches it, you know, matching colors, matching, um, shapes -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- letters, uh, they -- they can start very early.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  My -- my two year old, uh, granddaughter, um, she's helped her parents use it so I'm sure she's not going to be afraid of it at three.
R:  Right.
L:  And they do have enough gear -- well, you're in the business, you must know they gear computers way down.
R:  I didn't know that, actually.
L:  Oh, they do, yeah.  They have programs for li- -- uh, for preschoolers -- 
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- [inaudible] and it's not scary.
R:  Right.
L:  It's actually fun, they actually enjoy it and then by that time they are ready to [MN] have it an information tool --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- they're not afraid of it.
R:  Right.  Yes. [inaudible]
L:  They learn how to use the mouse.
R:  Yeah.  The what? 
L:  It -- it's much easier, type thing.
R:  The one thing I have seen is, uh, language learning programs.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And there I've seen, like it seems to really help because, um, it listens to you pronounce words and tells you when you, you know, it helps you get the accent down right and -- 
L:  Oh, they -- they actually -- I didn't know they had that.
R:  Yeah, like the -- I was playing around with a Spanish program and it just makes you repeat and then, you know, it will play back what you said and how you should have said it.
L:  See now we both learned something.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You didn't know there were preschool and I didn't know there was computers that can hear.
R:  Oh, well, yeah, the reason I knew about it -- 
L:  Well, basically, you know, and -- 
R:  -- is because that's exactly what I work in, so, [MN] so I -- I was keeping track of things, what -- that it actually gets used to -- used for -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but, um, yeah, and I thought that was a kind of really neat -- 
L:  So it can actually teach -- you can actually learn a language on the computer.
R:  Yeah, you can really learn a language but I still wonder whether -- so these are designed primarily for people who -- who are not taking a language class or just sitting at home and trying to learn a language and I still wonder whether, you know, how well that would integrate into a class where there's a real live teacher.
L:  Right.  It would be -- I think that would be a little bit difficult.  They could learn the basics, but -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- the slang words and the expressions and stuff probably -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- wouldn't translate very well.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Um, I guess, you know, if I was a teacher and I had thirty students in a Spanish class, then this would kind of help because, you know, it's hard to -- hard to give the kind of attention with that many.
L:  Right.
R:  So I guess it would be kind of like a multiplier.
