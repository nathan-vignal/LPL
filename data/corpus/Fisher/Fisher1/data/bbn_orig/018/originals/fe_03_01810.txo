L:  Hello.  This is Lee.
R:  Hi.  I'm Tony. 
L:  Hi, Tony.  How are you?
R:  All right.  What was the topic again?
L:  The topic was whether computers enhance education, whether they help with the educational system within the country.
R:  [MN] Okay.  What do you think? [COUGH]
L:  Uh, I think they're -- they're a major part of the educational system and --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- the amount of information that's available to people that are in -- in school is incredible and there you are with the internet, the world wide search.  You can pretty much find anything you want without even leaving your -- your home or your school and the ultimate goal is to -- is to get as much information as you can to make our lives as easy as possible.  I mean you certainly have the option then to -- to go to libraries in search of other books -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but what the computer can do is just remarkable, when you look at the amount of time that -- that you and I spent when we were at school -- 
R:  Yeah, I know. 
L:  -- going -- going to libraries and Xeroxing and using mic- -- the micro- microfilm -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and making copies of that, so I think -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, educational purposes can help -- to help people of all ages and there is [MN] -- there are programs for -- for children that have learning -- learning differences that can help them get through school in a much easier way, so I think it's very positive.  What do you think, big Tony? 
R:  Uh, well, let's see, uh, I work in an office and I work on a computer all day. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I'm doing -- I'm doing computer networking now, so ... no, I think it's -- it is good but then also I think to a certain extent it's going to take the kids away from going to the library and doing things, you know, manually and will kind of make them lazy in a way.  It's just like you have in the video games that we have, like X Box and stuff, and I know me growing up, you know, coming from a poor family, we had to make our toys and we were always out in the streets, you know, having fun with our friends -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but most of the kids nowadays are always at home, either on the computer or on the video games because, like, my, uh, stepdaughter, first thing she does when she comes in is she hops on the computer and she IMing everybody and she's not doing nothing else, it's either the computer or the phone, you know -- 
L:  Mm, but -- 
R:  -- and I mean it -- it has -- I believe it has plus to it and it also is going to have this negative effect on society kids, you know. 
L:  But as far as -- it's not so much what -- 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- it's going to have -- what it's going to have an effect on -- on society, but what about for educational purposes?
R:  Oh, for educational -- oh. 
L:  For educational purposes.  I understand what you're saying as far as society is concerned, where children -- 
R:  Yeah.  Well, for educational, yeah, of course.  I mean a kid at school can, you know, learn everything they have to learn on the internet, talk to other people who's in class somewhere else, you know.  I mean, that's what I use the internet for, I get -- for educational purposes.  I mean I get all my information now because I go to school, you know, go to junior college.
L:  What are you studying? 
R:  Oh, I'm studying to be a -- a drug and alcohol counselor.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, [COUGH] I mean -- 
L:  That's pretty -- pretty amazing what you can pull up off the internet that would help you with your -- with your studies and just general information about what your career is going to be.
R:  Yeah.  Mhm, but it saves me time to going to the library, too. [LAUGH]
L:  I understand it saves you days and days and days, hours and hours and hours that you can -- 
R:  Well, also, too -- also too, I mean I have been on the internet to where, when I'm looking for something, I don't get exactly what I'm looking for and that costs a lot of time, too, causes me to be on there a lot of time when I really want to get in there and get out, you know what I'm saying?
L:  So the search engines don't always take you to the point that you want to go to.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you wind up going around searching -- 
R:  Right, a circle.
L:  Until you find the right web site --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that you need to retrieve that information from.
R:  Mm.  Yeah.  And someti- -- and then sometimes they say if they ask for educational purposes, I was going -- I was doing a thing like transference and counter transference and I went to a couple of web sites of other universities and you had to have passwords -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to get in their -- into their library, you know, I'm saying so.  I mean it's great, I'm not going to deny that it -- it won't help the kids, you know, um, just for, I don't know, for educational, yes.  I mean there's really nothing more I can say on that. 
L:  That's fine.  [several inaudible words] where are you?  What city are you in? 
R:  I live in California.
L:  What -- what city in California? 
R:  Oh, Semetel[?].
L:  Which is near? 
R:  Uh, -- 
L:  What major city? 
R:  San Francisco.
L:  Near San Francisco.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So what's Semetel, within an hour of San Francisco? 
R:  Oh, yeah, about an hour.
L:  About an hour from San Francisco?  That's a beautiful part of the country.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Where you from? 
L:  If you have lots -- if you have lots of money out there it's a beautiful part of the country. [MN] [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, they sell a lot of computer stuff out here. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, to the Silicon Valley [inaudible] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  It's not -- it's not happening like it once was, is it? 
R:  Oh, no.  I mean, but one thing, you know, like, um, I love computers.  I'm -- matter of fact I'm fixing a couple of computers, uh, on Friday.  I took the day off to fix a -- a couple of computers, you know, um, because it's fun, you know, [inaudible] the insides and outsides of [inaudible] but, you know, it's just like everything, you know, stuff that things come and go --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I believe that -- I believe computers are going to be back again and Silicon Valley is going to be up again.  Just right now they just need to find another way around it.
L:  Right now it's kind of a down time.
R:  Yeah, you know, uh, --  
L:  I'm -- I'm calling you from -- I'm in Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Just three thousand miles away from where you are.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I've never been there.
L:  Never been there. 
R:  No.
L:  Have you been -- have you been east of -- of California? 
R:  No.  
L:  No.
R:  I have never -- I've been out of California once when I was, like, five years old.
L:  Well, you sure you don't remember that because that was a couple of years ago.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and I'm too old to remember most of it.
L:  [MN] You gotta -- you gotta get out of California, you gotta get out of [inaudible] California once in a while.
R:  Oh, man.  Oh, no, I'm -- I'm too afraid to fly, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, listen, it only -- it only hurts when it hits the ground.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I got to keep that in mind. [LAUGH]
L:  While it's going in the air it's a free ride.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, you're -- you're -- you're safer flying than you are driving, my friend.
R:  [LAUGH] That's what they say. [LAUGH]
L:  [several inaudible words] When your num- -- when your number's up, your number's up. 
R:  No matter what you do, huh. [LAUGH]
L:  No matter what you're doing.  Flying high, that's all [inaudible] [LAUGH] that's all I say. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, I -- I fly all the time, all the time.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I haven't -- haven't got -- haven't had a cra- -- have not been in a crash yet.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I've not walked away from a crash that I have -- then have to worry about.
R:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] 
L:  I've had some crashes in cars, but not planes.
R:  [several inaudible words] on the topic or somewhere -- somewhere else. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] No, I don't think they -- why?  Do I -- have you talked to anyone before on these things?
R:  Uh, this is my second time.  I signed up to it yesterday.
L:  Yeah, I just signed up, er, on Sunday, Monday.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  What's today, Wednesday?  Yes, I signed up on Monday and I got -- received a call last night.  We didn't stay on the topic for more than three minutes.
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible] Why, did you stay on the topic last night for a long time?
R:  Uh, well, we did the whole ten minutes on the topic.  Ours were on, uh, uh, did we feel that -- do I feel that the United States is still threatened by other nations.
L:  That's exactly what my -- that's exactly what my topic was.
R:  No, okay.  And see that wa- -- 
L:  They don't expect you to -- they don't expect you to stay on the topic for ten minutes.  They just want to just hear how you speak on the telephone, I believe.
R:  Uh, -- oh, okay. [LAUGH] [inaudible] because that --
L:  [MN] What do I know?  I'm -- I'm just another -- another informant like you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Another respondent like you, I should say -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- not informant.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Informants are all different, Tony.
R:  Yeah, I know, I know.  Trust me. [LAUGH]
L:  Informant and respondent --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- whatever -- what -- whatever -- whatever.  So you're going to the drug and alcohol counselor.  That's pretty cool.
R:  Yeah.  Well -- 
L:  That's admirable of you.
R:  [NOISE] Well -- well, yeah, because, uh, you know, um, I've been in recovery.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I've been -- I've been clean for almost five years.
L:  I'll drink to that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, uh, you know, my whole life has changed, you know -- 
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, because I've been at, you know, I've been to the penitentiary a couple of times and -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- lived on the streets and everything and my whole life is so much better now.
L:  Oh, that's -- that's good.  You're on the -- you're on the right road and I think you'll be -- you'll be fine.
R:  Mhm -- 
L:  You'll be fine.
R:  -- long as -- long as I keep my head up. [LAUGH]
L:  That -- that -- that's right, just keep your head out of the bottle and everything else.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
