L:  Hello? 
R:  Hi, I'm Teresa.
L:  Hi, my name is Barry.  Ah, I guess the topic is computers in education. 
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Um, I think they're good, ah, I definitely think in terms of the internet, ah, how much research you can do, ah, in such a short time period.  Ah, you can pick up the information that, ah, ah, would take you hours in a library to obtain.
R:  Hm.  Barry, I'm, I'm sitting here in the library, ah, that's where I work, and we use computers, and, ah, right now we have adults and, and children who are, um, a lot more interested in subjects that they didn't think about before because, like you said, they can easily, you know, find the research material on line.  I agree with you a hundred per cent.
L:  Ah, the, the we- ah, or wealth of information, plus, ah, for example if you buy a, um, an encyclopedia, it becomes out of date unless you get, ah, ah, new, ah editions, or, ah, -- to it. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you can get, you can, you know, ah, belong to some encyclopedia, ah, internet, ah, organization and you'll get the most up to date information, ah, each year.
R:  I totally agree, and, um, I like the tutorials that, that come with the computers, because we have, ah, little kids, you know, starting out from six years old, who are completely computer, ah, literate because they could, you know, they could find study materials or find information on any topic, um, and it's also a, a real good argument for, like, little kids on knowing how to read, because, you know, every kid wants to play with a computer, right?  Um, so the, the very fact that they can read, you know, is, is relevant.  Um, what part of the country are you in?
L:  Um, I'm in Atlanta, Georgia.
R:  You're in Atlanta, Georgia?  You sound like you're from New York. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, I am from New York. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, see I moved here from New York, and when I accessed the New York Public Library there, you know, they, they didn't have computer when I moved here to Tennessee, but you know, it, it's exciting to see how many school kids, you know, and teachers come in here and use the library to access the internet.
L:  Well, I think that's -- it's one of the most innovative, ah, um, machines that have come over the last thirty or forty years, because if you look back, for example cars, although certainly cars nowadays are more, ah sophisticated, they basically still, you know, if you had a thirty or forty year old car that was running it would still get you there --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- but computers are completely, ah, you know, wasn't around at all, ah, just a little while ago, and now we run our spaceships on it, and, ah, the information, as I said, ah, that you can get, I mean, you can look at the news and, ah, get completely up to date.  You can go to the stock market --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, ah, get up to date quotes.  Of course sometimes there may be a little bit of delay in a few minutes, but, ah, basically, ah, get a world to research on just about anything that you possibly could want.
R:  I remember when I was in school and my teachers were always telling me, ah, when you didn't know how to spell a word or you didn't know how to pronounce a word, you know, ah, go find a dictionary and look it up.  And, and as a kid in school that was sort of discouraging.  But, you get on the internet, you look up Miriam Webster, and, and there it is.  Ah, you try to spell it and you have no idea, they'll show you every variation of the word, and, ah, the thing I like the most about that is if you have a sound card in your computer, all you have to do is just, you know, click on the little sound icon and they will pronounce it for you, you know.
L:  That, that I wasn't aware of.
R:  Oh, it, it's wonderful.  You know, because--
L:  I, I, I, I'm a very poor speller, and what I love is the spell check when I send an email.
R:  Spell check is terrific.
L:  And, ah, they'll come up with, you know, if you mis spelt do you mean this or do you mean that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and even correct your grammar along the way.  
R:  I, I like spell check myself.
L:  Because you send something out and you don't -- and all of a sudden, if you, if you don't have the spell check on it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you realize later, God, I don't believe I, I wrote that [LAUGH] so incorrectly, and it -- but the spell check picks up an awful lot.
R:  Well, Barry, I remember back when I was in school, you know, ah, if you really wanted to impress the teacher, you would have your mom type out that book report for your teacher.  And like, ah, now here at Davis [inaudible] Library, we have so many kids, you know, who, who want to learn how to word process.  Who want to learn how to type better.  Who, who spend time in the library im- improving their typing.
L:  I remember when they used that little white out.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] People don't do that anymore.  They put them out of business, ah, you can correct your own thing and, ah, in fact go back and use it as a template and --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- and, ah, you know, write something even over that sometimes, ah, you can go in and, ah, ah, find stuff that -- parts of it and paste it and copy it and whatever you need to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- from one document to another document.
R:  I feel like, um, computers in regards to education, um, it, it's the closest thing to science fiction that I can even think about.  You know, like back in the sixties they used to say, well you would have subterranean houses now, or you would have, like, so many innovations which have never come to pass.  And it took computers a while to get -- to, um, get compact enough for everybody to have them in their home, and it took the prices a while to come down, but the very fact that so many, ah, schools around the nation -- ah, I don't know if you have that program in Atlanta, but they have it here in Tennessee, and I've seen it in surrounding states, where, ah, stores will tell their customers, if you bring in the receipts we will contribute, you know, a certain amount of funds to schools so they can afford computers.  I think that's terrific.
L:  The only negative thing are all these spam and advertisements that you get sometimes.
R:  The spamming?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  All these little pop up ads, but um, you know, you can go ahead and actually get a, a GED on line, or even a --
R:  I didn't know that.
L:  -- ah, college degree.
R:  I didn't know you could get your GDN -- GED on line.
L:  I, I think so.  At least I know the college part you can, because --
R:  Cool [inaudible].
L:  -- I, I get these emails all the time that you can have a home study course and do a lot of it on the computer.
R:  Well you've inspired me to actually do a search on getting your GED on line, 'cause, ah, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I have a friend who's looking to get his GED.
L:  I may be -- I, I have to say there I may have misspoke on the GED, but I know for college, I get these emails all the time where you can, ah, do your course work --
R:  Phoenix University?
L:  -- and I, I assume at some point you, you might have to go there and take the test or something like that, but I'm not sure.  I've never done it that way.
R:  Well, I, I think that you can go to any college, if you're doing, like, an on line thing, you can go to any college and have them act as a proctor so you can take the paper test.  You know, 'cause I've taken some correspondence courses.  Um, hm.  We have, ah, seven computers here at the library, and, and I have to tell you, the, the kids are more excited about the computers than they are the books.
L:  Do you control what they can pick up on the internet?
R:  Ah, yeah.  We have the four or five, ah, computers which access the internet, we have, um, certain controls set up.  But I have busted, you know, a twelve year old trying to pick up chicks on a chat room --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- he's permanently banned.
L:  What'd he say, he was twenty one? [LAUGH]
R:  You can't take -- 
L:  Usually the old men are trying to pick up the young girls.
R:  You can't -- no, it was a young boy trying to pick up adult women, so it goes both ways.  You can't change human nature.
L:  God, he's a little advanced for his age.
R:  You can't change human nature. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That surprises me.
R:  Well, you got to admire his ingenuity, you know. 
L:  Well, I guess, you -- yeah, I guess, that, yeah, that's possible.
R:  You know, I'm not tickled to death with him, but, ah, [SIGH] computers open doors.
L:  And I think you even get an education, ah, when you go to some place, ah, like Ebay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, where you start looking at items that are for sale --
R:  True.
L:  -- and, and there are things that you never even knew even existed.  And, ah, when you buy something, ah, it's kind of, ah, pushes you to find out more about it.  So, ah, it leads, ah, to you, ah, to research it.  And --
R:  That brings up a valid point, Barry.  Even if you're not using your computer for education, you get one anyway.  'Cause let's say you're looking up something like what kind of butterfly is eating my plant in the garden, it'll lead you to, you know, like, mountains of information you didn't think you needed to know, like what kinds of plant the butterfly won't eat, or where the butterfly comes from.  It educates you going from one subject to the next.
L:  And, and when you go, for example, and, and a simple thing like, ah, maybe paying your taxes or paying your water bill, you go on site and -- or, or you start to learn much more about your sewers or, ah, whatever ever information they have there, because, ah, ah, they built the site to, ah, to educate their customers --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- so they won't complain about the, you know, the cost sometimes.
R:  Um, I have a friend who, ah, sent me a link around Christmastime, I don't know if you seen this or not.  It was President Bush's Scottie dog.  It had a little camera on it as it went through the White House, you know, and -- the Scottie dog's name was Barney, and I remember thinking, what is Barney cam, right, so as -- when I clicked on this link I found out that the White House has their own web site, which I did not know.
L:  Oh, definitely.  I'm, I'm sure -- in fact, I'm sure every senator and representative has a web site.
R:  Um, I've been spending some time writing to our senators here in Tennessee about the environment, and I think it's cool that, like, you know, kids who feel strongly about an issue can not only research it, but actually send a letter to George Bush and a letter to the White House and a letter to the representatives of the state.  Um, it, it don't get any better than that.
L:  Well, the other thing I like, and this may be slightly off the
