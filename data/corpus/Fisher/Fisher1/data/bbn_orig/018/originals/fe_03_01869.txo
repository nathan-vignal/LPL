R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, I'm Jackie.
R:  I'm Alexis.  How are you? 
L:  I'm fine.  How are you? 
R:  Pretty good.  This is my first call.
L:  Mine, too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  My daughter did this yesterday and she's like, "Here, you have to sign up for this, this is lots of fun".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, [LAUGH] but then she got computers and she's, like, "Oh, I don't know if I like these topics".
L:  [NOISE]  Oh.
R:  But family's pretty good. [NOISE]  I think that is probably an easy one, um, to talk about.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Go ahead.
L:  Um, I -- I guess what family means [NOISE] -- I -- I guess it's different what family means to us individually, or ...?
R:  I guess, probably.  Maybe what your views on -- on family are, or, I don't know, ah, 'cause it just says what -- yeah, what does family mean to you.
L:  I guess family is pretty important to me.  Um, I have, right now I don't have any children or anything, I just -- I live with my fiance, we are getting more married in a few months, and I have a pretty small family, just, you know, um, mum and dad and two brothers.
R:  Yeah, ahah.  Yeah.  That's what -- we have a -- we have -- I just have a daughter and a son, and my daughter got married two years ago so God bless your mother 'cause -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] they're -- we're really going through it right now. [NOISE]
R:  And it only gets worse, let me tell you.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  But I think I kind of feel the same way.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, my mum died when I was young.
L:  Oh.
R:  So all I had was my dad.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I think I really like having family close to me, like all my family I want to live within -- and I know this is unreasonable -- within, like, fifteen or twenty minutes of where I live.
L:  Oh.  Well, that's how it is -- I'm -- I'm in -- I don't know where you're from -- I'm in West Virginia and it's sort -- 
R:  Oh, we're in Pennsylvania.
L:  See, it's sort -- where I live it's sort of a small area.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So everybody lives close to everybody here and that's important to me too, because my mum didn't have a very good relationship with her parents growing up.
R:  Ahah.
L:  And my grandmother just died, like, -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- two years ago and they didn't really patch things up, so it's important to me to keep a good relationship with my family.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  To make sure --
R:  I think when you see that, um, you know, when you come from a background where you see, like, -- like, with me losing my mum it was just so important to me to have a good relationship.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I probably didn't realize that until I was older, you know, and how much I would miss her.
L:  Right.
R:  So, you know, I feel bad for your mum because I know what that -- what that's like. [MN]
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  You know, and then my dad passed away a couple of years ago and we were very close, but, ah, that was hard -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even though we were close I felt like I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.  So I think family and family values are probably pretty important -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to us, you know.
L:  You see, my mum's family, um, they were German and she has several brothers and sisters who she never met because her mother had -- she had children in Germany before --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, before she moved to the States with my grandfather who was a soldier.
R:  Ahah.
L:  And they -- her -- her mother, my great grandmother, wouldn't let her bring her younger children and she --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- said, "That it would be disruptive for them to have to leave their country and everything", so she left her children there --
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  -- and she saw them once before she died, so ...
R:  Oh, that had to be hard.
L:  It is, especially since, um, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my mum didn't have a good relationship with her mum and then there's, you know, knowing that you have family that you've never met.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, brothers and sister, not just distant.  So -- 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- I think it's important to keep all of your family close [NOISE] and make sure, you know --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, we have -- yeah.  Because I think -- well, my dad was raised in an orphanage.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So he didn't have anybody, and my mother had eight brothers and sisters but they all had various forms of cancer, so there's only two of them left.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- and they all died when I was young.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] You know, except for the two that are left who, thank goodness, are in their eighties and doing very well.  Um, so I try to keep, you know, -- remember to try and keep in contact.  Um, I think people's lives get really busy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, they just don't take into account what's really important.
L:  Definitely.  I, um, -- I'm in college right now.  I moved away just -- it's just about an hour away from home.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I don't get home to see my family as often as I'd like, not because of the distance just because I get so busy with work and everything.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  There's so much to do.  So much else that you have to do.
L:  Mhm.  The plan- --
R:  You just have -- mhm.
L:  Obviously planning the wedding --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- is really good because it's -- it's made me go home, and -- [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, I have to go home and work on stuff.
R:  I know.  When are you getting married?
L:  [NOISE] Um, July twenty sixth. 
R:  Of this year?
L:  Ahah.
R:  Oh, wow.  Okay, -- 
L:  I'm  a -- 
R:  -- so -- so you're in the final [NOISE] decision making time.
L:  [NOISE]  Mhm, we're in the home stretch here --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- trying to get everything set up [NOISE] and ordered and I still don't have my wedding dress altered and ... [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  Oh, it all falls into place, you know.  I mean, we didn't get the wedding dress altered -- or we got her dress altered but her bridesmaids -- her maid of honor came from Australia.  She met her when she was in the fifth grade, they started writing as pen pals.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they kept writing all through college and everything, my daughter's thirty, and so she got married when she was twenty eight. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So she called her and she's like, "Would -- would you like to be in a wedding?"  And she's like, "When?"  She said, "I'll be there".  So we were like, "Oh, jeez".  So we had to have this stranger in our house -- 
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- for two weeks.
L:  Oh.
R:  But -- that was hard.  Like the two weeks of -- before the wedding when everybody's nerves --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- are at an end and, you know.  I've got a bride who's crying and ... [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no. [LAUGH] 
R:  But somehow you manage to get through all that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  My best friend just got married in, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in December, on the fourteenth, and it was crazy trying to get everything important -- she had a small wedding, too.  I mean, it was a very small wedding but it was still so much work. [MN]
R:  Yeah, it is.  All the little details and -- and then meshing your family with your fianc's family.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Does he have a big family? 
L:  No, it's only, um, -- it's just him and his parents and his brother.
R:  Oh, well that's not so bad.
L:  Yeah.  He doesn't have any other siblings or anything.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  His mum has a -- a large extended family, though.  She has eleven brothers and sisters.
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  So there'll be a lot of cousins coming in for the wedding.
R:  Yeah, but I'm looking at it from the mother's aspect too, because my daughter -- my son is now -- he's twenty six and now he's pretty seriously involved with a young woman who is extremely nice but, like, now I'm seeing it from the other side.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, they always say, huh, what is it, a -- a daughter -- a daughter's a daughter all of her life, a son is a son until he takes a wife.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  They say that and the- -- the- -- for Easter he went to her house for Easter dinner and I was, like, "Oh", you know, and my daughter was so upset and she said, "Well, that's it.  We'll never see his kids".
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  You know, and they're just dating! 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But it -- it -- it's kind of funny.  So you have to remember that from your mother in law's point of -- of view. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, definitely, definitely.  We actually, um, I spend most -- we spend most holidays with his family because my family is small, they don't do anything major.
R:  Okay.
L:  So -- so I could go to my family's things and it's over in about an hour.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And then I usually go to his parents.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Because, see, we don't do a whole lot but -- [MN] because there's only us.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it was, like, really the saddest Easter I think we've ever had because he wasn't here and I -- and, you know, I like family around but I -- I can understand that he has to put a good foot forward and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, make this family. 
L:  Well, this is just him and his brother.  His mum, you know, she's obviously not having any more kids. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  So ... 
L:  So I've made sure that she's involved with the wedding planning and stuff because I know this is the only, probably the only wedding she will ever get to be involved with, so ... 
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  I don't think his brother is ready to settle down any time soon. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's what -- [LAUGH] that's funny because [MN] my son in law he was raised by his grandmother and two aunts.  Um, his mum left when he was three.
L:  Oh.
R:  And she showed up, like, -- she sort of came back into their lives, like, six months before the wedding, and at that point we were, like, so stressed out and -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and you're trying to be nice and I said -- she said she wanted be invited to the wedding and I said, "You haven't seen this kid --" 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in, you know, fifteen years or more", 'cause, I mean, he's thirty four, so, [MN] "And then all of a sudden you want to be invited to the wedding", and I thought, "All right, back off.  This is his mother and you don't know what the history is, so, you know, let them come to the wedding".
L:  Mhm.
R:  So she came to the shower and that was the first I met her and she seemed like a really nice woman and he said to h- -- to him she's just a stranger -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but he did it for his aunts because his aunts said that was -- you know, they wanted her there.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  And then it -- it came about, it was really hard because she came there to the shower and he has a sister that he wasn't raised with, she took the sister and left him.
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] And -- so she came to the shower too and I thought, "Well, maybe this will develop into a relationship", but it hasn't.  But then she came -- she wanted to come to the wedding and I thought, "Well, that's fine".  But then she asked to invite, like, her brother and her best friend.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I was like, "No way".  And then I -- like, then I hit the ceiling.  I'm like, "No, wait a minute.  We're paying for this".
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, these people were basically strangers and, so then I was like, "Well, you know, it's fine, whatever Joe wants is fine", and that's what I just kept saying.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What does he want, because I thought if he says yes then that's fine, you know, if not -- but I did let his aunts -- his aunts got involved in the shower and the wedding and stuff because that was basically his mother.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN]  But our wedding invitation read like a book. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Be- because on our side it was just us but on his side he had his two aunts and his dad, you know, and [LAUGH] it's, like, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I think his grandmother's name was on there, and I thought, "Oh", but --
