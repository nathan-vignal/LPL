L:  Hello?
R:  Hello. 
L:  Hi.  My --
R:  My nam- --
L:  Go ahead. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] What's your name? 
L:  Christie. 
R:  Yeah, where are you at?
L:  I'm in Knoxville, Tennessee.
R:  Okay.  My name's Amy.  I'm in Portland, Oregon.
L:  Oh, wow!  Cool.  So what -- odd how these things bring us together. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Well, they said, "Computers and education".
R:  Yeah, whether we think it is, ah, harmful or beneficial, I guess. 
L:  I think that's what they want to know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well --
L:  I don't know.  Go ahead.
R:  Let's see, um, I really -- I don't have a lot of education, I just, um, completed high school, graduated high school and that was it.  I really didn't get a lot of, ah, education on the computer at, you know, -- in high school and I have never been to college.  Um, I feel, like, ah, having a computer in my home is very beneficial to me.  I can research pretty much any subject I want on the internet and come up with, ah, you know, information [LAUGH] whether it is relevant or not I can always look at --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the source, but without my computer I really would be, I think, cut off from the information superhighway. [MN] 
L:  Yeah, I agree with that.  I only -- well, let's see.  I went to high school and I did a year and a half of college.  Either way I never touched a computer in either place.  We had typewriters. [LAUGH]  We didn't use computers.  They were just starting to be popular enough to even go in schools but I wasn't in the courses that had them.  [MN]  We, ah, -- as far as computers in schools and all, I think it's fantastic because it is the way the world is going anyway.  The kids are going to need to learn how to use this as quick as they can.  We already have two in our house and we have the kids on them not all the time but they play -- every game they play is educational.  They only have a couple that are just games.  So I believe that computers and education have -- they are going to walk hand in hand and from what I heard on the news they said that, it was, like, California or something, has already gone to a totally computerized classrooms. 
R:  Really? 
L:  Yeah.  Somewhere -- I don't know, it may be just a project that, you know, that they are doing to see how it goes, but from what I understood they are going to have a professor, but all their textbooks type stuff's going to be on the computer.  Their tests are computerized.  It is all --  like, you just go in, you sit down, you sit at a computer all day, which I don't know if that is going to be the way to go, but it would broaden our -- it would make it cheaper on the schools to offer things if they could use the computers that way for certain things.
R:  I think that there should still be, you know, some supervision with the teacher present to gui- -- help guide them.  I mean, you can't replace the, you know, one on one, um, --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- interaction with -- with the teacher and other class mates.  I mean, I guess it does detract somewhat from, ah, people having social interaction with their peers, but for the most part, I mean, it definitely helps with education because most jobs that you get these days you need to have some sort of computer knowledge.  And tha- -- it's just going to be increasing in the future, um, the need for computers and without that training you're really going to be left in the dust.
L:  Well, that's the way I feel.  I feel, like, it's the way kids have to be taught and if they are not taught young by the time they are teenagers, high school and even ready to go out into the world, it is going to be so far ahead of them they are not going to know which way's up because everything is out there on the computer, on the internet somewhere, and it just takes that education to dig it out.  And a lot of trial and error and [LAUGH] a lot of those other searches that you do that you just -- you'd never get nowhere and then all of a sudden you hit the right word pattern.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you find out more than you ever thought you could find out anyway.  [MN]  But I think, I mean, even the libraries here where I'm at are computerized now.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  We don't have the card catalogues and all that stuff we [LAUGH] used to learn in school.  You have -- everything is on a computer disk.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just amazing where it's gone to.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't think that, um, children under the age of eighteen should have, um, exposure to the internet at school but they should definitely get on the computer at school.  Um, the internet is more for, you know, something you should experience at, you know, at home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  With more one on one supervision, not thirteen of them in a room going anywhere they want to go. 
R:  Yeah, absolutely.
L:  I agree with there, too.  I think the internet as far as in schools in a special circumstance would work, but in general, knowing the kids around here, no.  [LAUGH]  They all want to -- all they want to learn about is the movie stars and the [MN] you know, the same things every generation has liked but we had magazines we read, and instead of reading magazines they just get on a computer and do it that way.  You know, at least they are reading.  So that part's not there and their knowledge of typing and all that's there but they would do it in school all hours of the day if they had the ability. [MN]
R:  [LAUGH]  Let's see, I was born in nineteen seventy four and my parents did buy a computer when I was young, we had a Texas Instrument.  I don't even think the internet was around at that point and, um, you know, we had a lot of games that were for educational purposes.  We had --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- math games and reading games and, um, memory type games and that's -- that's really all that we had.  We didn't have a lot of, ah, you know, games for entertainment on the Texas Instrument at that point.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Things really have changed since the Texas Instrument came out.
L:  Yeah, hasn't it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  We had all the Texas Instruments, the computerized toys.  The Speak and Spell, the math and, ah, spell I guess is what you call it.  It was speak and math, I think.  My parents were big on the Texas Instrument educational toys but we didn't have a computer.  I was born in sixty nine, so I'm not much older than you but enough -- [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- just enough that we -- I don't know, we didn't have a computer and the first computer that my grandparents bought for their business filled up a room, and I think they bought it in the early seventies and it was the size of, like, a ten by twelve bedroom.  You know, it was just gigantic.  It was, like, watching the, um, old TV shows where it took up a whole room for all those big wheelized[?] looking computers and all.  It was that kind of a thing.
R:  Do you feel --
L:  But we weren't allowed to touch it.
R:  Do you feel it was beneficial to have that then?
L:  They needed it.
R:  Oh.
L:  It helped with the book work and it helped with their stuff, but they didn't have that internet access then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And when it came time to upgrade it, you know, to the smaller versions where the guys kind of put it on their desks and, oh, my grandmother is, like, "No, the one we have still works.  It's fine", and she kind of got left in the dust because now computers are hand size and that other one is so obsolete I don't even think they could fix it if anything ever happened to it.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It is so ol- -- it is one of those that just, you know, will be in a museum some day. [LAUGH]  Because I think it -- it wasn't the first computer that came out but it is one of those first few that came out for businesses generally.  You didn't see people -- it wasn't a family size, but she -- oh, she just thought she was something getting that.  But they did -- they were able to store more information and do things quicker.  So even then the computers were great.  They, ah, -- like, here in town I substitute teach over here at the elementary school my kids go to and the kids -- my son plays on a computer every day.  He has math games and reading games and spelling and he has to keep going till he can get it right to go to the next level.  And I think those are great, that is what I have here at my house.  Basically the same games and then some and I think the kids have, like, one minute to Pacman but I never see them play it.  They don't want to get on there and play the games.  They like doing more the -- that Reader Rabbit.  They like Reader Rabbit because the rabbit talks to them.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And teach -- even though they are learning something they think it is funny because if they mess up he'll say, "No, no, no.  We got to go back and we got to hunt for the information to make this work", and the kids love it.
R:  So your students do have access to educational programs at school then?
L:  Yeah.  They just put it in about two years ago they got -- there's at least one computer in every room and then I think here just the last -- this year, I believe it was Bill Gates with Microsoft donated so many computers.  I don't know whether it was nationwide or just select areas or if you had to be a poverty school, but each teacher got one of those, and so most of the teachers, I think one out of every five teachers up there at the school has the internet access to their computer, but the students are not allowed to use that because they said they cannot protect them --
