L:  Hi, I'm Donna. 
R:  Wendy, how nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you too.  I'm up in Saint Paul, Minnesota.
R:  Oh, New York.
L:  Oh, great, great.  How's the weather out there? 
R:  It's a little cold today [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, you've got some nice warm -- warmth coming --  
R:  I hope so.
L:  -- it is about seventy today.
R:  Ah, great.
L:  So, we're supposed to discuss education and whether computers hurt it or help it.
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, I don't -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- know about you, but I think they help it.
R:  I ag- -- I agree, I actually see both sides of the story.  I would say they definitely help it because with the internet and everything -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- computers in the classroom, you know, kids have access to so much education.
L:  Exactly.  See, but you can [several inaudible words] adults.  My husband took, um, online classes from the University of Phoenix --  
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- I guess that would qualify under -- what we're talking about.
R:  Definitely.
L:  And that was very paper heavy, very, very computer heavy, um, -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- lots of, um, interaction like on, um, chat programs and -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- and lots of looking up things.
R:  Right, and -- and it gives people who are maybe in a remote location access to greater education.
L:  Oh, absolutely and as far as kids go they're great I think as long as the -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- school puts, um, filters and blocks on certain --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- things.  Well, my -- my husband has as daughter whose twelve, twelve and a half and, um, she lives in a very remote location in central Minnesota and I don't even know how many people are in the town, maybe twelve hundred, maybe not even that many and it's amazing the things that these children list, um, themselves as and they're doing a lot of it -- or they were doing it from school, um, you know, um, like AOL prog- -- I don't mean AOL, like Yahoo profiles and all that --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but they put blocks on that and they also used to list, they figured it was a safe, you know, a safe environment so they used to list the bus schedules on there but they found out, well somebody could just look that up and kidnap children --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so they took that off, but as far as -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- accessing the computer, whether it's internet or whether it's just word processing, I think it's great.
R:  Oh, definitely but on the other hand the access to the internet it makes children, since they have it it's easier for them to do their reports and their  --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- homework and that, they can just, you know, just download reports right off the internet and not actually do the work.
L:  Sure, they've got even a site I think it's called something like clip notes dot com or -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- something like that --  
R:  Oh, yeah [LAUGH] 
L:  But you know [MN] in elementary level anyway the teachers are pretty damn smart --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, as you get higher up I'm sure the kids change some of the words and plagiarize that way but, um, --  
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- [MN] I just basically know about, you know, the elementary end of it and, um, see that -- that does a lot of good and it teams them also skills how to problem solve, how to trouble shoot and how to type on a basic level.
R:  Oh, definitely.  I mean -- I mean I'm in upper level education now and I definitely utilize the computer to do all my research --  
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  -- and it would have taken me, like, a thousand --
L:  Oh. 
R:  -- more just to go for the book and everything, so it --  
L:  Can you imagine having to go to a library and look everything up that we look up? 
R:  It's -- it's -- it's crazy, [several inaudible words] you -- any question, you know -- you know, kids are always so inquisitive and wanting --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- to know things and, like, now they can just get the answer really quickly --  
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and that's great and it encourages em to, you know, want to learn and find out things.
L:  Oh, exactly and then it's great for opening discussions too --  
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  -- but -- but as far as, like as I said, as far as computers go I'm very, very heavily into, um, putting on filters whether it's at home, um, or at school or even the library.
R:  Oh, absolutely when there's kids around you definitely need that.
L:  Well, his -- his ex wife doesn't understand how to put it on so -- I -- I try to explain to her and so did my husband how to even just put a password on, password protect it --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- period, you know, because, ah, the child has signed up for a dating service, she's twelve.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, that -- it wasn't amusing at the time.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And, um, [LAUGH] but, you know, I said, "Just password protect it, you don't know how to put filters or restrict sites or even buy a program, go to the store, buy a program that -- that restricts all that, you have to enter password for it". 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And she's still as far as I know hasn't done that.  But as far as education, oh, I don't -- I think that -- I wish I would of had of had it  --
R:  Oh, def- -- yeah --
L:  -- in high school.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'm -- I'm forty three, how old are you? 
R:  Twenty four.
L:  Oh, you're young, you're --  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- my son's age.
R:  But I mean they were just starting to put computers in the school when I was going through.
L:  We had, like, I think it was about two computers I wen- I graduated -- it was my master's school was seventy eight --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- and they had, like, two terminals in the whole school and they were for mainly just entering attendance and it was -- I mean there wasn't -- there was no internet or anything like that, um, it was for, like, entering attendance, doing spreadsheets --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and all that kind of stuff and we could go in there and we could play games like Pong --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, on our [LAUGH] days off --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you're too young to remember Pong.
R:  I've heard about it.
L:  Yeah, yeah, it was like a basic slow tennis.  I don't know how to explain it  --
R:  No, no, I know what it is --
L:  -- it was so stupid, but that is what we could do on, you know, on the computer, um, but I also believe that -- that kids should have access to home computers if at all possible.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Um, some schools like higher end schools, you know, something we can't afford, actually give the kids laptops to use.
R:  Wow.
L:  And, yeah, I think that's great and they should be able to, but I do think even in, um, in lesser, lesser -- how should I say this -- in poorer places.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- for -- for lack of let better place, or bet- better term, that they should have better, um, fees -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- because I know that we have DSL and it's expensive --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and a lot of people can't even just a dial up --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what are they -- I don't even know -- what they run now, like twenty dollars a month?
R:  Well, I have actually -- I access it through my school I can dial up to my school computer are it is free for me.
L:  Oh, yeah, my -- my niece too she's at, um, North Western -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- and she can, um, go through her laptop --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [MN] whether she is at home or whether she's, um, you know -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- at school or whatever, but just regular elementary school kids can't do that --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- but if you -- but if you get them started early enough if you expose them to it, they're not going to be afraid of it.
R:  Oh, no, it's -- it's the greatest tool of this century -- of the century [MN] --  
L:  Oh, yes, absolutely [NOISE].  I don't know how we did without it.
R:  [LAUGH] I already -- I can't even remember that far [LAUGH]  
L:  Well, I tell you my dad was in the army in the fifties and that is how he got into computers, um, one they had people in line and as they came to the front of the line they said, "You go to the left, you go to the right, left, right" and -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- and the ones, like, on the right went to Korea, the ones on the left went to Germany and he went to Germany and he learnt how to get into computers, he's -- he's been into computers since the fifties --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, we always sort of grew up around [LAUGH] technology -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- and none of us are afraid, except for my mother --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- she -- she could learn, you know, and she should, um, but she can't type, so [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah, it's also great to teach the older generation the computer --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- because that way they can stay in touch with their families and --  
L:  Well, I was very surprised [NOISE] mum did -- when she lived in Wisconsin she did take a -- a course at the senior center, it said, "Basic computers".  Now, that to me would mean learning how to basically type, maybe some chat programs and learning how to at least access the internet.  They went in there and they taught -- they were trying to teach them Excel at the higher level --  
R:  Ah.
L:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] Powerpoint --  
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and stuff like that, and I'm like this is seniors class of absolute beginners --  
R:  Right, and when are they going to use Powerpoint presentations [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I know, what are they going to do?  Hold a presentation right there, you know, at the senior center.  This is what I learnt, nothing -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know. [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But [MN] it can be great for the seniors and I know that my -- my dad still hunts in packs but I would like to talk to him sometimes online.  In fact, he'll hide from me.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  He has AOL and I'll see him when he pops up and he won't answer me, he'll become like he doesn't see me because he can't really type even though he has been in it all these years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, let's see.  What other vein haven't we covered that they'll wanna hear?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, like I said, my husband did the, um, University of Phoenix online.  Very expensive, at least we thought it was, but excellent, um, they downloaded everything for you, they had instructors and you had virtual classrooms --  
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- they -- the ad part about that is if somebody didn't pull their own weight they -- just like in -- I suppose in college for you [LAUGH] --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- if they didn't pull their own weight you had to do it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or -- or the whole team loses --  
R:  [MN]  
L:  -- but, um  --
R:  It also -- it also helps where -- where it will be -- if you look at it from the teacher's perspective, I mean it helps them with less -- in making lessons in more creative ways and --  
L:  Oh, exactly, exactly and the teacher -- actually there was some real, um, a couple of really decent teachers, I mean really, really made you think.  I -- I guess it is like in life and others that were just sort of, "Read these chapters and give -- you know, you guys each give me an individual paper on this, um, tell me how you research it, put it in this format --" 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- and then I also want a group paper done by Tuesday" --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and no -- no real specks on that so you had to get creative, um, and decide how far you wanted to go on that and most of the time it was really, you know,  the people were pretty good about it, um, but like I said it was very expensive, I think we paid, um, about fifteen hundred dollars a class.
R:  Wow.
L:  I -- my understand- I think the classes were four credits each which, you know, and they're five weeks long but they're every day.  I mean you have to be on the computer -- he would -- I don't even know how many hours he -- he gets off at work at like, at four would start at six and he'd be working until midnight, you know -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and so, um, but he -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- was just getting back into it.  But it is a way for people to get back in especially if they can get the -- the student loans --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, [LAUGH] even apply for those online --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, our taxes are online n- now.
L:  Oh, yes, absolutely I do mine online it even tells me when I mess up. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, "We cannot accept this".  "Okay, why?"  And you pay online.  I pay my bills online but I also think that kids should learn how to do that too.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I remember in seventh or eight grade we had to learn how to write a check and nowadays you should learn -- have to learn to write a paper check and -- and pay online I think.
R:  Definitely.
L:  And learn sec-
