R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name's Ed. 
R:  I'm Terry.
L:  Hi, Terry --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- nice to talk with you.
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, as far as family is concerned we have an extended one.  We have five children, hers, mine and ours.  And how many children do you have? 
R:  We have five children, his, mine and ours. [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah, that's wonderful.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, we have a boy and a girl from the first marriage, I have a step son and then we have two girls from this marriage.
R:  That's so funny because we have, um, -- he has two girls from his marriage, I have a son from my own marriage and then we have two girls. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, it's a small world.
R:  It really is.
L:  Actually we met through -- my -- my second wife, we met through an organisation called Parents Without Childre- -- Without Partners and this was in New York and, ah, we were both in charge of, ah, children and family activities and I just, ah, got to the point, being single at the time, of being on the first name basis with the animals at the zoo, I figured it -- got to be something else I could do with the children.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, ah, we went to plays and, ah, different activities and when I finally realised that a second family or children from a divorce family are no different than other children if you do it that way -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- then they've grown up real well, we haven't had any problems, no drugs or anything and our kids are thirty six, thirty five, thirty one, twenty seven and twenty five.  How old are yours? 
R:  Um, ours the -- from oldest to youngest twenty three.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Twenty one, those are his girls.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, my son is twelve and then we have got two little ones seven and five.
L:  Oh, God bless you, so you're -- you're still in the stage of, um, like, ah, brownies like to, ah, -- 
R:  Oh, yes, girl scouts.
L:  Yeah, well we -- with the girls we did drill team and it was really good because being able to be there for them in any kind of weather and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  And being able to participate and my wife did the French braids on their hair so ... 
R:  Oh fun.
L:  I don't know if you will ever get to this point and she was, ah, girl scout troop leader, ah, den mother, ah, trainer so she got involved that way. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, we're still pretty new, in that we're still in the brownies so we're still kind of working things out.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But now as far as raising all the kids together goes our oldest, I mean, they're both married and they're -- they have got their families and we never had the problems, you know, that I hear my friends talk about, oh my step daughter this -- my step kids, they have never been my step kids, they have always been my kids.
L:  That's right, yeah and, ah, -- 
R:  They have always been my kids.
L:  Bobby I call son so I mean, he's just part of the family and, ah, -- 
R:  That's my husband's name. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well.
R:  It's a small world.
L:  It is a small world.  Ah, where are you calling from, I -- I don't know if we can a- ask this question.
R:  I'm in Oklahoma.
L:  Ah, well, we're neighbors, I'm in Texas.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  As a matter of fact we were just up to Pryor Texas to the Will Rogers race tack, we were with Good Sams and we -- three hundred and sixty three of us camped there.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And we went through the Good Sam, ah, I mean the Will Rogers museum was very emotional.
R:  Yeah, we've been there.
L:  I mean, just very emotional.  And speaking of family, the kids from the Will Rogers Junior High School twelve and thirteen year olds played a jazz, ah, concert for us at a +jamboree and they were tremendous.
R:  Oh, that sounds great.
L:  Just excellent.  As a matter of fact the following morning, on Friday morning they appeared on channel six up in, ah, tha- that area.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] small world.
R:  Really.
L:  This is my first time doing this so ... 
R:  Mine too.
L:  Um, but, ah, yeah, a- as long as, ah, you talk to them, you -- you hear them out, you regard them as, um, individuals and listen to them.
R:  That's the most important thing is listening.
L:  Ah, it certainly is because when the kids, and you know this now, when the kids get to being the teenage years they think they know everything. 
R:  Right.
L:  [COUGH] And -- and --
R:  Right 'cause whenever I -- I married my husband, his girls were twelve and fourteen.
L:  Oh, that was something, okay.
R:  And I was only twenty so it was kind of like kids raising kids and it was rough at times but, you know, you look back on it and it could have always been worse and it was never really that bad.
L:  Well, and -- and again you -- they respected you and all that so ... [NOISE] do you have any pets or anything? 
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  Yeah, we got a little toy chihuahua here that's making the chow next door go crazy so ... [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Well, we've got three cats, we are cat people. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, you are cat people, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yes.
L:  And the kids get along with the animals and the animals get along with the kids? 
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  Well, that's good, well, that's good.  Um, yeah, it's -- it's just -- oh, that's funny, Oklahoma 'cause we took our time coming back from Pryor because it was raining, this was last, ah, Saturday, and the storms and all that and, ah, everything was fine.
R:  Yeah, I -- the -- the weather is always crazy here and there.
L:  Oh yeah, that's true but, ah, we've been, ah, -- we've been twenty four years here in Texas so it hasn't been bad, we've really enjoyed it so ... 
R:  I've lived in Oklahoma all my life.
L:  Oh, so you're one of those native Americans? 
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, good.  Is your husband from that area? 
R:  Um, yeah, he was -- he was actually born in Japan. 
L:  Oh, well good.  
R:  He -- 
L:  Well, as a matter of fact I have something in common.  I sold Toyotas for eighteen years.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, ah, very good products and, ah, let's see [inaudible - not English], ah, a few other things I know but not too much.  I couldn't con- converse with them to that extent.
R:  Oh, he could.  He move- they -- he was in the mil- -- his parents were military so when they moved back here he was like five.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.  
R:  But ...
L:  Well, we were originally, if you can't tell, I parked my car in Harvard yard and my wife is from New York so ... 
R:  I can tell.
L:  You can tell? 
R:  I can tell.
L:  But the girls are all over the place and real Texans and we've got, ah, -- out of the five we've got two married, one probably within a year, ah, three have houses, the fourth one is getting a house probably in August.
R:  That's great.
L:  And, ah, the fifth one is the world traveller.
R:  Oh, that's great though. 
L:  So ...
R:  That shows what good parenting skills can do.
L:  Well, yeah -- 
R:  You know, whenever they grow up and have a sense of being and responsibility.
L:  Yeah, that -- that is true and, ah, -- well, you have got two on your own.  Do you have any grandchildren? 
R:  Um, our oldest daughter has two granddaughters -- I mean, two daughters I mean.
L:  Yeah, we have two granddaughters and one grandson but they are in Connecticut so we are going to see them this year.
R:  Oh, how fun.
L:  Take a trip up there but, uh, well good.  Well, family is true and I was a boy scout so being in girl scouts and being a da- -- a -- in other words, the two youngest are boys --
R:  Great.
L:  -- so they are in cub scouts or are they in girl scouts? 
R:  The brownies are girl scouts.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, they're brownies so they're on -- yeah.  Well, that's good, um, --
R:  We make sure they are involved in all kinds of, you know, community and things like that.  My -- our seven year old is disabled so some things, you know, she can't do but ... 
L:  Well, as a matter of fact, well, here is something else we relate to.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Ah, the Good Sam chapter has two charities, Special Olympics and dogs for the deaf.  So, our chapter was the second chapter nationwide -- international of the Good Sams and we, ah, donated I think it was like seventeen hundred dollars to Special Olympics.
R:  Oh, wow, that's great.
L:  So, last year were very into that and any of the +jamborees they divide any of the, um, charities for the raffles we have between the two charities.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So God bless him.
R:  That's great.
L:  And just -- just enjoy.  Well, my goodness, so, ah, they are going to, from what I understand, they are going to beep us, let us comment et cetera.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, this is -- from what I understand you can, ah, make a call an hour and, ah, as a matter of fact what you are doing right now my wife's into considerably and she's got my -- me involved and we've been doing this since October.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  And it's just fascinating.  
R:  Ah --
L:  So, we do it for various charities, I mean various stores, restaurants.
R:  Well, that's great.
L:  And, ah, yeah, well, we are both retired so we're going to be travelling for about seven weeks.  A couple of months from now we are going to --
