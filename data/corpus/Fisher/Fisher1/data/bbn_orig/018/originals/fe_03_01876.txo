L:  Hi.  I'm, ah, Karen Maguire from Florida.
R:  Hi.  I'm Melda from San Antonio, Texas.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I did not hear what she said when, um, she said the topic of the day.
L:  Okay, it's the family and what that -- it means to you.
R:  Okay.  Well, you want to go first?
L:  Sure.  Well, I -- I feel like, um, [NOISE] the family is very important to, ah, to me.  I'd say to everybody because it's -- it's a way that we're just bond -- bonded altogether, and we definitely have much in common [NOISE] and, ah, it gives you a feeling of, ah, belonging and security and they're just part of you.  I mean, [MN] they're your blood line [LAUGH], they're part of you, and, ah, I just don't know where we'd be without family.  So, we just all need each other and help each other, and, ah, help each other survive.
R:  Oh, I definitely agree.  Um, I don't have any children.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I'm divorced.  I've been --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- divorced for a long time and I moved back to Texas, um, where my family is.  I lived, um, in the north east during the time that I was married, which was a long time, and, um, my family is very important to me.
L:  Sure.
R:  And, um, [MN] I do have some very close friends, mostly in New York.
L:  Oh.
R:  That are like family.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] anyway it's, ah, -- I -- I don't think that our families are as close as they used to be.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  Um, I think everybody is too busy.
L:  Right.
R:  There're too many things to do. [LAUGH]
L:  Definitely.
R:  Like the internet.
L:  Right, definitely.  Definitely.
R:  And, um, anyway I think families have, um, lost a lo- -- a lot of their closeness.
L:  Right.  Right. [NOISE]  Right, well, I think that a family that, you know, goes to church and, ah, stays together prays together type thing.  You know, I -- I think it is different there than today 'cause the family's just, like you said, they are too busy and all that kind of stuff but, ah, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, I think before also they also used to live closer together. And, ah, -- u- --
R:  Used to what?  Oh, live closer.
L:  Right. And they also --
R:  That's true.
L:  And they also lived together sometimes.
R:  That's very true, yeah. 
L:  And they did have -- they -- they just depended on each other I guess more but now they just -- they're -- they're working and they're busy and they -- yes, you're very true about that, [NOISE] they just kind of have drifted [NOISE], but I guess not -- 
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- all of them.  Some are real close, some just aren't.
R:  That's true.  That's, ah, -- I -- I totally agree.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Tell me again what state you're in? 
L:  I'm in Florida.
R:  Florida.  Oh, what --  
L:  Good old sunshine state.
R:  -- what part?
L:  Fort Lauderdale. [NOISE]
R:  Oh.  My sister lives in Illamirada[?]. 
L:  [NOISE] Oh.  Where's that?  That's probably --
R:  Did I say it right?
L:  -- north Florida.  I don't know.  Tha- that's probably norther. No?
R:  No, it's in the Quays. 
L:  Oh, it's halfway. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  It's, ah, -- 
L:  Oh, down there.
R:  -- in the upper Quays.  Um, I think it's like a fantasy world where she is. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.
R:  And, ah, anyway she loves it there.
L:  So she doesn't get to be around your parents, your family then?
R:  Well, my parents, um, have both passed away.
L:  Oh, oh.
R:  Yeah, we lost, um, -- well our father died in eighty four and then our mother passed away -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the end of two thousand one.
L:  Oh.  
R:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] anyway, she, um, -- she was -- had a really good spirit. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  But she had heart problems and, um, [LIPSMACK] she was really a tough cookie, and never complained at all, but she, um, --
L:  So were you close to her at all?
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  Oh.  Right.
R:  And, um, as a matter of fact I was with her when she passed away -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I felt that -- I -- I was the only one that was there at that time and I felt very fortunate.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And, I can't explain it.  I've, you know, have never experienced anything like that before and, um, in a way I thought it was easier on me than it was on my siblings, you know, --
L:  Right, because you were --
R:  -- with her passing.
L:  Right, you had time to accept it and you had time to deal with it better.
R:  Well, I saw that, you know, she died peacefully.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, that was very important, well to all of us, but, anyway, I was there and, um, -- 
L:  That's the sad part about a family because when you have to lose your family members it's like no other, 'cause we're so close to them --
R:  [MN] I -- I know.
L:  -- that it -- it's just so hard to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to lose them like that.
R:  Yeah. [MN]
L:  It -- you know, a part of us goes, I think, with them. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But then at the same time you feel, you have this feeling that they're still there with you.
L:  Right. [NOISE]  Right.
R:  And, um, I didn't have any unresolved issues with my mom -- 
L:  Good, good. 
R:  -- and, um, a couple of my siblings did.  I mean, it wasn't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, um, [LIPSMACK] -- 
L:  That's sad.
R:  But anyway and I -- I -- I'm sorry that they did.
L:  Right.
R:  I think that that's hard.
L:  Mhm, yeah.  Well, I -- I think -- I think, you know, in order for your family to mean a lot to you you've really got to work at it. [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.
L:  Sometimes it doesn't come easy.  I mean, you have to -- you have to be forgiving--
R:  That's true.
L:  -- and you have to be giving and you have to just, you know, not -- not hold grudges or else, you know, that bonding won't even be there any more.
R:  That -- that's very true.
L:  You know, and --
R:  Do you still have your parents?
L:  Just my mom and she's ninety, so, you know, we won't have her --
R:  Oh, bless her heart.
L:  Yeah, I know.  She's in a home right now.  We have her --
R:  Is she close to where you are? 
L:  Yeah, and we have her well taken of, you know, because she needs to be taken care of.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But she, too, will be passing on soon I'm sure.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  My dad passed, like, twenty some years ago.
R:  Really? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  Have you always lived in Florida?
L:  Ah, no, I'm from Connecticut.
R:  Oh.  I was going to say --
L:  Right -- right next door.
R:  -- everybody in Florida is --
L:  That's right, from somewhere else.
R:  -- not from Florida. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, my son.  My son.  He is definitely from Florida. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  So he's a real Floridian.  His dad was, ah, from Florida, too.
R:  Oh, really?  Oh.
L:  Yeah, so that's -- you know, that -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  It does happen now. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  My, ah, ex husband lives in Florida.
L:  Oh. [NOISE]
R:  And, um, he lives up by or Orlando and --
L:  Oh, that's nice up there.  It's much nicer than down here.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Down here is [MN] a mess. [LAUGH]
R:  Anyway, um, he and my sister, my ex husband and my sister, ah, they see each other and, you know, every so often.
L:  Oh.
R:  They're not that close to each other but, um, anyway, they do, um, stay in touch which is fine with me.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And even if I did divorce him he is a nice person. [LAUGH] But --
L:  Right, right.  Well, at least you didn't have any children.
R:  I had my reasons! [LAUGH]
L:  Right, but at least you didn't have any children [NOISE] because when you have children and you divorce it's a very difficult thing.
R:  Yes.
L:  And they're very affected [NOISE] because, I did.
R:  [MN]
L:  I -- I -- I was divorced -- I'm married now, but I was divorced and it really hurt my son.
R:  Oh.
L:  A lot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it -- it's just not a good thing, so you are very blessed not to have had children.
R:  Yeah, well, I've always --
L:  [NOISE]  Unless you were going to stay with your mate.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's hard enough but then when you have to divorce --
R:  I've always said, "God knew what he was doing when he didn't give me any children --"
L:  There you go.
R:  "-- because I would have spoilt them rotten". [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  Oh, well, it's hard to be a single mom, you know.
R:  I -- I'm sure.
L:  And then you really do need your family then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I -- I was a single mom for sixteen years.
R:  [COUGH]  Really?  [MN]
L:  Yeah.  And it was very, very hard on one person.
R:  Oh, wow. 
L:  It does really take two and that's another reason why families are so important, because it takes really two of you to raise a family.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  And one it just doesn't work too well.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sometimes it doesn't work at all. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's --
L:  Most of the time it doesn't work at all, unless you have your immediate family helping you, like your mom and your dad. [COUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, they have the grandparents to influence them.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  And -- and I think that for -- especially for a boy it's so important to have a grandfather --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, to help and, you know, then they seem to come out better.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But I didn't really have that at all.
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  And, um, --  
R:  I think, um, the influence of good grandparents is important.
L:  Oh, very important.
R:  Even if the parents stay married. [LAUGH] Ah.
L:  That's -- oh, that's right, that's right, because grandparents have a way of just loving kids like parents don't. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. 
L:  They have more patience -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and more time and it's just different.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they -- they know, they've learned a lot from their own --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- mistakes and so they, ah, they know what to do now with the kids.  It's kind of late for them but they can always give it to their grandkids. 
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  Right?
R:  [COUGH]  Oh, pardon me.  Um, have you done a lot of phone calls?
L:  No, I just started and I don't really even understand them. [LAUGH]
R:  [COUGH]  Oh, pardon me.  I'm sitting here by an open window.
L:  Um, tell -- tell me, how -- how do you get paid the ten dollars, do you know? 
R:  Um, I did the first phone call in January and those, ah, checks -- ah, they sent a letter about it.  They're supposed to be coming out within the next week or two. 
L:  Are you supposed to do this on different telephones and that's how you get paid or something?  Five different phones?  I didn't understand that. [NOISE]
R:  Um, I ha- -- I know they have something about doing five different phones but I haven't gotten an email on doing that.  Ah, -- 
L:  [NOISE] Do you still get paid if you don't do it on five different phones?
R:  No.  I -- I don't think so, but I'm -- the way mine is set up I'm only given --
