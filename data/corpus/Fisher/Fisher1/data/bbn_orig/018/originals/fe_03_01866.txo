L:  Toby. 
R:  Hi, my name's Amy.  Um, nice to meet you.  Anyway, um, I guess they want us to talk about what family means to us.
L:  Yes.  Have you done this before?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, okay.  I had done one early -- like, um, a couple of days ago.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Okay.  Um, I guess I could start off saying I'm twenty five years old and I have one daughter, she's two and a half.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, um, that's my little family. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  And, um, family means a lot to me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, especially with everything that's going on in the world, it makes me a lot closer with her, you know.  I mean, especially kidnappings and this and that, you know, you gotta keep your eye on, you know, your child and, you know, and with the war going on it makes you want to be closer -- makes me want to be closer with my family because you --
R:  Right.
L:  -- never know.  September eleventh, people --
R:  You kind of value your family more.
L:  -- yeah, just go to work.
R:  Mhm, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And they come home.  Or tragic accidents that they have -- I'm from New Orleans --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I mean, they have accidents, shootings -- you go to French quarter, you know, you -- your mother might go to the French quarter to go, you know, have something to eat or something and come out and get shot.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So you have to treasure what you have because, you know, it might not be there tomorrow.
R:  Right.
L:  And --
R:  Well, I'm twenty two years old.  I actually live with my boyfriend Adrian, and I -- it's sort of a chosen family more than my biological family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I've just graduated from college, so I've sort of been able to make my own decisions about my family for the first time, and to me, um, I guess like you were saying about the war, it does make me kind of value people that are in my life more, some of my friends are actually serving right now, so it kind of -- it does make me think about the safety of my family and where they are, and stuff like September eleventh did make me think, you know, where is my family.  At the time, actually on September eleventh my dad was flying in a plane, my biological father.  Um, and, you know, I was really worried about him.  It made me realise that really our time here is limited, our time with our families is limited, and it also started me thinking about eventually my parents are going to die, both my mom and dad are alive right now, um, so it made me just kind of reconsider my family, you know, and what they mean to me, and what it would be like to have them not here anymore.
L:  Right.  That's the unexpected tragedy.
R:  Yeah.  Especially something that huge, I just -- I don't know how I, I would deal with something like that, you know, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it's not just in an attack against your family, but almost like an attack against everything we stand for is really what it was.
L:  Exactly.  And all the people that are sitting there protesting when there's people out there, and that's their families out there, and they see that on television and they're like, why is somebody objecting against my child and my family and their beliefs?
R:  Yeah, I actually --
L:  'Cause everybody that's there wants to be.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I have, um, one of my ex-boyfriends actually is serving in Iraq right now -- 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and it kind of -- we were engaged for a while, and we broke up, um, he married someone else, but while he -- he actually just a couple of days ago sent me a letter saying, you know, that one time we were engaged, we were really close, and I want you to know that whatever happens to me you're still important to me and I hope that, you know, nothing I did during the course of our relationship hurt you in any way.  And that really -- well, it was really touching, but it also kind of made me think, you know, it's really a dangerous situation, and a couple of my friends are married and one of my best friends, her husband is over there.  And --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- yeah.  To her it's kind of -- but it's this brand new family.  They actually got married about a week before he was shipped out.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  Um, and to her --
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from, ah, Charleston, South Carolina, but I live --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- in Ashville, North Carolina.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So you're over there, you're far from me. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Quite a bit, actually.
L:  Yeah, you know more -- I don't know if I know anybody, 'cause like, I went to college and a lot of the boys did go, you know, they were in the army and they do their little month thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I don't know if any of them are out there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, I need to find out if anybody's out there, 'cause then it makes you start thinking, hey, I knew this person and -- 
R:  I wonder if they're --
L:  -- whether or not they're not family --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with the word family, what does that mean, you know, like my best friend, I love my best friend with all my heart, I consider her my family.
R:  Right.  That's how I feel.  I think you choose your family.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't think -- like, I don't think just your biological family is your family.
L:  Blood, right.
R:  Um, I think that your friends are, like, a family you create.
L:  Correct.
R:  And to me, since -- um, I've been living on my own since I was about fifteen, I moved out, um, so I've sort of been choosing my family since then. 
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and at school I know definitely my roommates became like sisters to me, and I've been out of school now almost a year, and I still keep in really good touch with them.  I talk to them probably more than I do my -- my blood family.
L:  Right.  
R:  Um, -- 
L:  But I mean, it's very hard, 'cause you, you start thinking about people that were your family maybe years ago that are out there, and if something happened to them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then you're like, "Oh, my God", that was part of me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, especially when I was in college and partying, you know, that was my family back then, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- now I've settled down a little bit, you know, and --
R:  Have kind of a different life, yeah. 
L:  Right, but I mean, still, that is -- that would affect me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if something happened to them.  And I just think family's important, blood, distance --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or just friends.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you have to treasure them.  'Cause you never know what's gonna happen to them.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I mean, I lost -- I lost somebody that was part of my life way back --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when I was in my college years, and I find out that she's gone, and I mean, I don't even know her anymore.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and it was like, a big shock -- well, I mean, you know, it wasn't a shock, I mean, [MN] but she -- it was just like, I wished that I could a been there and maybe helped her.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  You know, and --
R:  I know exactly how you feel.  Actually a friend of mine committed suicide, um, --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- a few years ago.
L:  Yeah, see they don't know if she committed -- it was a drug overdose, like, we don't know if she committed suicide or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if it -- how it was, you know, and I've had a couple -- you know, living in New Orleans it's not that common to have drug overdoses.
R:  Right.
L:  And there's been a couple in my life.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and I'm fortunate enough to not have -- to draw myself out of that when it got that bad --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when things started getting bad that I walked.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because I didn't want to be a part of that lifestyle.  And luckily for me --
R:  Right.  I think that's really good.  Yeah.  My friend that, um, that died actually, she -- this is a really strange coincidence but she was living in New Orleans at the time, and she was going to school, um, and, and she was one of the people, she was one of my best friends, and we were really close, but she had sort of started down a path in her life that included a lot of drugs, a lot of bad decisions, and even though she was still -- I would still consider her a part of my life, part of my family, one of my best friends, but I was sort of having to separate myself from her in a lot of ways -- 
L:  Right.  Yeah, you have --
R:  -- because of that.
L:  -- to distance yourself when they make bad choices, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you can't tell somebody what to do, you know, we're older.  We're not little kids anymore when we tell somebody, you know, don't do it, and they're going to listen to you, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  You have to try to take their mind off, you know, go to different places that don't have that type of things --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that's what I would do.  But I mean, I just distanced myself because it started getting too bad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that was part of, I guess, my family back then, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and you still -- you have feelings.
R:  Do you have any brothers and sisters?
L:  No, I don't.
R:  I have, um, I have an older sister who is two years older than me --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and I have two younger brothers, and one of my brothers actually is kind of what you were talking about, you sort of have to -- I had to separate myself from him.  He has a lot of drug problems, he has discipline problems, he's been in and out of juvenile hall and jail -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and it's really kind of -- it's funny because both of my parents are really well educated and --
L:  Right, mine too.
R:  -- you know, sort of -- my mom's a teacher.
L:  Oh, mine is too.  What a coincidence. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow.  She actually has just stopped teaching high school very recently.
L:  Oh, okay.  Mine's middle school, so.
R:  Yeah, wow.  That's a job that --
L:  And I went into that, but I just -- I'm in paralegal now.  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I distanced myself from [LAUGH] teaching all together.  That's not a choice that I wanted to make, you know.
R:  Yeah, there's -- teaching tends to run in families, I've noticed.
L:  Right, yeah, my best friend, her, her mother's a teacher and she's a teacher, they teach at the same school.
R:  Wow, that's kinda cool.
L:  So it's like, a little family there, you know, it's my best friend, my mom knows her, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, my mom helped her get the job, her mom, and it's like we went to that school also.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So she -- you know, most of the teachers they have retired, or, or passed, you know, since then --
R:  Right.
L:  -- 'cause I mean, it's been a while.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, she does know a lot of the teachers, and even -- and you know, and that's, that's like a family there because when I go up in there, even the teachers that I didn't have, I know them all from my mother.
R:  Right.
L:  And that's her little family.  Like, my mom calls her students, she calls them her kids.  
R:  Yeah.  Actually, so did my mom.  Um, I don't know if I would actually want to work with my real family [LAUGH] or not though.
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  Um, I love them --
L:  It is something --
R:  -- but I think we'd drive each other crazy.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Um, but luckily, you know it's kind of funny that I think in the past hundred years American business has totally changed.  It used to be all family businesses --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and now in most businesses you couldn't work with your family, even if you wanted to.
L:  Right.
R:  And actually we were talking about that, um, my boyfriend works with his mom.
L:  Oh.
R:  They work in the same company but in a different department.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Which is -- for them it means they spend more time together they wouldn't otherwise spend together.
L:  Right.
R:  They ride to work together.  I think it does make them closer, and they get along really well, so I think it's okay for them.  But --
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We're planning a wedding over
