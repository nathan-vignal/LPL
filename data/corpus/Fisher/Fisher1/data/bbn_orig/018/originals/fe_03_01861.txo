L:  Hi, I'm Teresa. 
R:  Hi, Teresa, I'm Larry.
L:  Hi, Larry.  Oh, well I worked in the schools as a substitute teachers, and I actually actually got to work in the computer lab, but I do know that kids enjoy them a lot, and they, um, learn quite a bit from them.
R:  So, ah, did you, ah, teach or do anything with word processing?
L:  Ah, yes, we did.  We did.
R:  Have you ever considered what the difference between a kid that had a hard time learning to spell the old fashioned way and a new fashioned way where he has a word processor with a spell checker so that instantly he knows which word is misspelled rather than not even knowing which word is misspelled to look up beforehand?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It definitely spoils you. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well it spoils you.  I, ah, I had a, a real hard time when I was in grade school, I injured my hands really bad --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and in the second, third, and fourth grade I missed probably two thirds of the time.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't remember learning spelling.
L:  Oh.
R:  So I've always been a horrible speller.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, and when you're a horrible speller, you don't know which word is spelt wrong to look it up to see.
L:  Exactly.  Both of my [PAUSE] are like that.  They don't -- they're not good spellers at all.  And you can -- my dad always used to tell me, "Get the dictionary".  Well, when you don't have an idea --
R:  Really.
L:  -- what the second letter is going to be, that's not helpful, is it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a lot of words with Is and Es in them that you have to guess -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- whether, you know, whether it's I.E.A. -- I.E.D. or E.D., you know.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and, um, you can spend a lot of time in the dictionary --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but I have, since I started using, ah, a word processor, my spelling has improved a hundred per cent.
L:  Uh-huh.  And, and I think you can still learn from it, because when I misspell a word and I, you know, and it pops up and tells me, and then I always spend a little extra time looking at it trying to remember it for next time.  But, ah, --
R:  You've got a -- you've got a beautiful accent, did you know that? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no I didn't. [LAUGH] It's a southern accent, I guess. [LAUGH]
R:  I was gonna suggest maybe Texas or something, but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Where are you from?
L:  Alabama.
R:  Alabama.  Well, that's close to Texas. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah.  That's close. [LAUGH] We have about the same accent, I think.  Pretty much.
R:  But, you know, kids can get carried away in school on computers and waste time.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  They, they need to learn how to do the old fashioned research.
L:  I agree.
R:  And they should stay away from computers when they're doing research.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, math, computers I think are wonderful.
L:  Mhm.
R:  My wife is, well, she's a physical -- a pediatric physical therapist, but years ago she went to work for the school system.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And she works with, ah, with severe handicapped all the way to mildly handicapped kids.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, ah, she has -- there's two or three situations, one in particular, you got a thirteen year old boy that can neither see nor hear -- an, hold it. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  No, he has to be able to see.  But anyhow -- oh, he's a quadriplegic.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And his, his skills were no -- he didn't have any skills whatsoever, and they came up with a thing that there's a monitor that -- there's a, a device that sits on top of the monitor, and then he wears a, a kind of a headset thing with straps and stuff, and I believe it's an infrared thing that shines at the monitor.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, ah, whatever Windows application is on there, he can move his head around and it will move the cursor around on the monitor.
L:  Wow.
R:  And when his head comes to a stop for more than a programmed period of time, it's the same thing as clicking on a mouse.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, so this kid went from, from a young person that's very bright actually -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, but had, but was living in a, in a, in a, in an envelope where he had no stimulation of any kind whatsoever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  No communication, couldn't talk, couldn't -- ah, I think he couldn't talk, that was what it was --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but he was quadriplegic that could -- but anyway, all of a sudden he learned the language.
L:  Oh.
R:  And all the next thing you know he was, he was communicating.  They'd start off with, what do you want for lunch, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and go down through different layers of Windows, but, ah, he finally learned how to use a word processor, and he'll never -- probably never be able to hold down a job anywhere, but it made a happy person out of somebody that was just, just completely bored --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- and couldn't communicate, you know.
L:  Wow.  That's amazing.
R:  [SIGH] So --
L:  They just don't teach like they used to do.  You know, they don't teach spelling in school --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- I have one that's eighteen years old who can't spell.  Never did a book report or an essay except --
R:  Well --
L:  -- for when what he did research on the computer, and then you just print out what you want to print out, you don't research it, you just find it and print it.
R:  That's right.  And, and you use somebody else's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- cognitive thinking --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and everything.  So, yeah, --
L:  I mean, they don't even teach kids how to study anymore.  It's frustrating for parents, I can tell you that.
R:  Oh, for sure.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But you know, my, my mother, she, she died at ninety five not too long ago.
L:  Wow.
R:  But she was, she was raised in northern Wyoming, ah, born in nineteen oh seven.
L:  Oh.
R:  And she went to one of the proverbial -- it was a two roomed schoolhouse, the big kids were on one half of a -- actually a partition, ah, it was ah -- no kindergarten back then, but one through eight.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, ah, so they had most of the kids -- they had the bigger kids on one side and the smaller kids on the other side, but one teacher.
L:  Wow. [LAUGH]
R:  And she had a, a monitor for the older kids, somebody that would rat on anybody that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- played up.  But, ah, anyhow, she did all the, the course scheduling and everything all herself, she wasn't married, and by the time those kids out of there -- came out of there they could absolutely diagram a sentence, they were all skilled at, at, ah, -- I don't think they went above algebra.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But if they took, ah, -- they could pass any test that they're asking today.
L:  Wow.
R:  That kids are taking today.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because if they didn't study the teacher would hand them a note, the note would go home to the parents, and ah, and, ah, all --
L:  And the parents --
R:  -- heck would break loose. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh, that's it, exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  There was no such thing as slothfulness.
L:  No.
R:  If you tried hard and couldn't do it, that was one thing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but if you didn't turn in something, ah, number one, ah, that you were a public -- publicly ridiculed about it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because with, you know, -- and I don't -- my mom never said what they did for discipline, I think they left it up to the, to the parents.
L:  More than likely, and the parents probably knew what to do, too. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well it was from a --
L:  And weren't afraid to. [LAUGH]
R:  It was from a community where everybody knew everybody.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, but there's no excuse for, for what -- I don't blame the teachers for anything --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- you can't -- you can't force a kid that says, "Screw you" --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- to study, you know.
L:  That's right.
R:  I'm, I'm a bus driver from a big town -- in a big town of Portland, Oregon.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And on a sunny day, and if tomorrow was a sunny day --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I could go out to any big shopping mall at one o'clock in the afternoon and there'd be a hundred and fifty high school kids hanging out.
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  You know.  And, ah, you cannot teach somebody that refuses to learn how -- anything.
L:  That's right, that's right.
R:  And that's where we are today.
L:  It's awful for --
R:  So how long has it -- how long has it been since you taught?
L:  I quit two years ago.  I was actually doing a couple of the high schools here, and where the kids are bigger than you are and they don't mind pushing you up against a wall, and they pushed me one time too many, and I said, "To heck with that". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I quit.
R:  But, um, we have had seven foreign exchange kids go through our house --
L:  Oh, man.
R:  -- in the last twelve or thirteen years.  I have five kids, my oldest is twenty seven now, but ah, the last young lady that was here was from Belgium.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, ah, the Belgians, she studied as hard as she could over there, she crammed, she had no extra time, everything was school --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and she got Cs.
L:  Mm.
R:  And over here, she goofs off, she goes to all the school stuff, she, ah, plays baseball, ah, school baseball, and, and has a very very good rounded social life --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and is enjoying life and is getting a four point oh.
L:  Wow.
R:  You know.  And over there, if you use the F word in the hallway --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and a teacher hears you, chances are you're gonna lose a letter grade --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- from the last class you were in.
L:  That's it.
R:  The kids wear ties to school.
L:  Good.
R:  They're well mannered, they don't have long hair because if you do have long hair it's not acceptable in the school district, and the school districts are run by nobody but the school district.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  There's no federal intra- intervention, there's no other, ah, state, ah, scholastic boards and stuff like that, you know, but, ah, the individual school get -- districts get to determine everything.
L:  Wow.
R:  It doesn't hurt a thing.
L:  No.  I mean, here, I mean, it's just like they have the code of conduct, you have to sign that you read it as a parent and as a student, and then nothing in the book is enforced.
R:  Yep.
L:  There's two schools here that have good principals.  I mean, these principals rule the school.  But that's the only two schools.  And when you go over there to substitute, you have no problem.  Nobody back talks, nobody did anything wrong.
R:  Well that's nice.
L:  Totally.  I mean, so you know, it depends on who's running the school, for one thing.  And a lot of the principals around here just don't give a flying flip anymore.
