R:  Hi, my name's Lisa.
L:  Hi.  This is Sue, Lisa.  How are you? [NOISE]
R:  Good, how 'bout you? 
L:  I'm good, thank you.
R:  Good.
L:  So what does family mean to you?
R:  Um, I don't know.  I live, like, three thousand miles away from my family.  It seems like, you know, --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- a whole country away.  Um, I live on one coast and they live on the other and, um, [MN] I don't know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Family means a lot, I guess.  I wish I lived closer.  How 'bout you?
L:  Well, fortunately I'm very close to most of my family.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  I, um, -- I'm married and have two children at home, one and -- one and eight and, um, my parents live nearby.  My husband's parents live nearby.  Sometimes a little too close for comfort. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, the only one we have out of state --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is, um, my sister.
R:  Oh.
L:  And she's -- she's quite a ways away.  She's in Arizona, so --
R:  Oh, that's where my parents are.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Arizona.
L:  So you must be on the east coast? 
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, I'm in New Jersey.
L:  Okay.  I'm in Michigan.
R:  Oh, wow.  Um, [MN] --
L:  But my family means everything to me [NOISE].  Boy, they're really important people.
R:  Yep.  [MN] How, um, how many brothers and sister do you have? 
L:  I have a sister that's older and a brother that's younger, he was adopted.
R:  Mm. [MN]
L:  So, um, at age thirty three I'm the baby and now they have, um, -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- a sixteen year old next month.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm an only child, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Only child and you're that far away from family? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  All of your family?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Does everybody live away?
R:  Yeah, yeah, -- 
L:  Wow. 
R:  -- everybody.  Um, yeah, we recently moved to New Jersey, it's where my, ah, boyfriend's family is.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And it seems, like, here on the east coast they don't value family as much as, um, you know, we did in the mid west.
L:  Ahah.
R:  I'm originally from Missouri.
L:  [MN] Okay.
R:  And, you know, family here to them is, like, you know, if they're busy or watching a movie or, you know, talking on the phone, you know, it can wait till later.  And I recently lost an aunt, um, before we moved back to New Jersey and, you know, realize how important things are now. So --
L:  Kind of puts everything in perspective, doesn't it?
R:  It sure does. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  It sure does.
L:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm very, very lucky.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Um, even the family that is away, like, on my husband's side, um, it's just down in Illinois. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah. Yeah. 
L:  So it's -- it's nice, you know.  We can jump in the car for a few hours and go and visit them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because he has one grandmother living and then of course there's aunts and uncle down there and, um, I guess if I list the way family is for me is Arizona would be my sister, Florida is my aunt, otherwise everybody is there, and my mom's one of seven.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.
R:  [LAUGH]  Are you going to have that many?
L:  No.  I've got all I'm having.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I love my kids, don't get me wrong.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  But, um, -- 
R:  Two's enough.
L:  -- I've had two labors and two deliveries and that's it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They were hard. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you have kids?
R:  No.
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  No, it's just hard enough taking care myself. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I can't imagine.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they're work.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] [MN]  How long have you been married?
L:  They're definitely work. [NOISE]  Are you there?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  I got a call waiting and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I read on that thing that it could throw you off.
R:  Oh, I see.  Have you done this before?
L:  No, this is my first call.
R:  Oh, mine too. [LAUGH]
L:  And the topic of family I thought, well ...
R:  Yeh, you can do that.
L:  I guess you can't go wrong there. [LAUGH]
R:  No, no.  I'm wondering, you know, I'm wondering why -- why that, but, you know, that's okay.
L:  Well, I did -- I did see on there they have several different topics. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, really? Oh, but ... 
L:  Mhm.  But I -- I think that's a -- I think family is definitely a good one to start off with.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Um, [inaudible] --
L:  Everybody has one, I think.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  For the most part.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Um, are you considered mid west in Michigan there?
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, are you?  Yeah.
L:  But it's kind of silly, it's not mid west, but ...
R:  Yeah.  Have you ever been to the east coast? [LAUGH]
L:  No.
R:  Yeah, there --
L:  No, we have family -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- being married in New York in July, we gotta call.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  We, um, -- it's definitely different living in -- on the east coast. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, when you said something about your boyfriend's family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  How they're -- they don't seem as family geared.
R:  Yeah, they're --
L:  I think there's a lot of truth to that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Geographically.
R:  Yeah.  Whether or not, you know, anybody geared really, you know, family or otherwise, they just aren't ...  It doesn't seem, like, they are into socializing and, you know, -- 
L:  [NOISE] Mm. 
R:  We've been here a year, and, you know, no friends, no -- you know? 
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  It's -- it's just not the same as --
L:  When you -- when you were with your family did you do a lot with them?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  We did -- we do a lot.
R:  Yeah, yeah. But --
L:  I'm very close to my -- my parents and we go out to dinner and we get together for every holiday.  Um, it's hard -- 
R:  Oh. Yeah.
L:  -- chopping it up between both sets of parents sometimes.
R:  Oh, yeah, I know.
L:  And with the kids, you know.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  Yes. I --
L:  Tired baby and ... [NOISE]  And sometimes, you know, sometimes it makes it harder because it's more stressful trying to get to both sets of parents.
R:  Right.  You've got to run here on Thanksgiving and then try --
L:  And then -- yeah, and there -- both always have dinner at the same time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So it's, like, you know, I'd rather have a separate cook out in the summer and get together and then remember the meaning of the holidays.
R:  Right.
L:  Appreciate the family that you are with.
R:  Right.
L:  Because sometimes I just like to be home with my kids.
R:  Yeah, yeah, especially on Christmas morning.  I'm sure your kids --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- don't want to -- [LAUGH]
L:  The kids open their gifts and its like, "Okay, you can't play with them we got to run off to grandmas".
R:  Yeah.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or pack up your favorite and [LAUGH] let's go.
L:  No, we can't even do that because they get so many gifts.  I usually to have --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- we have to come home between parents house and unload the car.
R:  Oh, I see.  Oh, my goodness. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they're not spoilt.
R:  [LAUGH]  It doesn't sound like it. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] You know, this is really hard to talk about just one specific subject for so long, even though it is family.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  You know?
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Ten minutes didn't seem long. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I guess I'm not sure what they're looking for.
R:  Yeah, I'm not either.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [PAUSE] I don't know.  Well, we're kind of, you know, in the holidays here now, we've been here about a year.  You know, we just kind of celebrate by ourselves.  It's kind of peaceful, you know.  You don't have the stress of -- like you do, running here and there, but still kind of miss it, you know.
L:  I was -- yeah, I was away for one holiday and -- and I missed -- I did, I missed my family.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  It was tradition broken after all those years.
R:  Right.
L:  Of not being with them, and it was hard.
R:  [MN] Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Didn't bother them probably [NOISE] as much as it bothered me, but ... 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, yeah, the one who's away I think it bothers. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  Yep.  Interesting.  And it's -- and it's constantly growing.  I guess that's the good thing about having siblings and so many aunts and uncles is there's always a new cousin in law, or niece in law, or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- brother in law or sister in law, a new niece or a new nephew.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We've got so -- you know, between both sides of the family there's just kids a galore and there's aunts and uncles galore, especially, like I said, my mom being one of seven. 
R:  Oh, I know. [LAUGH]
L:  And, of course, my husband's, um, mom is one of five.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  His dad was an only child and then my dad's side is not -- they're all up north north.
R:  Oh.
L:  [MN]  And they -- [PAUSE]  It's a whole lot of commotion, too.
R:  Yeah, I bet. [LAUGH]
L:  But it's fun chaos.
R:  Do you all have family reunions and ...?
L:  Mm, no.  Um, on -- on my side of the family we get together, like I said, for every holiday and then in the summer we'll just have a few cook outs here and there.  So we're -- we're together probably [NOISE], um, well, you know, all the major holidays and then a few times in the summer.  So -- and we're all close enough in proximity that we all stay in touch for the most, you know, except for -- except for my aunt and my sister.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We all stay in touch.  Well, we do stay in touch with my sister, too, don't get me wrong but ...
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, we're all just a hop skip and a jump away.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I bet your sister likes to come back to Michigan in the summer.
L:  She does. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But she doesn't get to come up a lot.
R:  Oh.
L:  They've -- they've travelled all over because he was in the navy.  Now they've retired in Arizona.
R:  [MN] Oh, I see.
L:  Which, no, it's not by water but he retired and then they moved there.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, um, she's got four kids. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah, so, you know, there's three nieces and a nephew right there. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  But she -- they -- so they -- you know, it's expensive --
