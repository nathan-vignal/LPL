R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name is Betsy.
R:  My name is Ray.
L:  Hi.
R:  Okay, this is my first time doing this, I don't really know what I'm doing.
L:  Yeah, well likewise, but, um, I guess the question is, ah, "Do computers enhance or harm education?"
R:  Right.
L:  I don't -- or improve.  It's improve.
R:  Okay.
L:  Whatever.  Um, so what do you think?
R:  I think it improves education.
L:  It does?
R:  I think so.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Ah, it just -- is it just computers, or the internet as a whole, or ... what do you -- ah, how do you take the question to be?
L:  Um, I -- the whole thing.  You know, anything that gives you ac- ah, you gain access to using a computer, whether it be software or the internet or what have you.
R:  Well, I think it improves education because it makes things a lot easier, and it just makes it faster and allows people to learn a lot more.
L:  I think it can be used to enhance a person's education, but I think if you rely on it too much you miss the basics, and you know what they say, "Garbage in, garbage out" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- same thing, um, you know, if you wanted to solve a complicated math problem you need to know -- you still need to know basic math to understand what you're doing.
R:  Oh, I totally agree.  I don't think that -- I mean, obviously you can't just, you know, type it in and, you know, get the answer.  You should know exactly what you're doing, but -- 
L:  Yeah.  In other words it's not a substitute for, you know, the basics.
R:  Yeah, it shouldn't be a substitute for education, it should just help enhance it.
L:  Yes, exactly.
R:  Improve [inaudible] ability.
L:  Well, I think a lot of people look at, um, computer usage as, as the, the answer to our problems -- the problems that we have with education today and certain kids not being well educated.  Hence you have this rush to get, you know, a gazillion computers in schools where, um, performance just hasn't been up to snuff at all -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on testing.  So, I'm not sure that it's the, the best answer.  Like I say I think it's a useful tool, just like anything else, but, um, I don't think it's going to solve the problems that we have with our education system.  Um, --
R:  Probably not.
L:  What experience do you have with using computers?
R:  I have used computers for the past fifteen years of my life, I guess.
L:  Could you -- could you speak up just a bit, please.
R:  I was saying I've used computers for the last, like what, twelve years of my life.  I use a computer every day.
L:  Really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And what do you do with, um, is it part of your job, or --
R:  Actually I'm a student.
L:  Oh, you're a student.
R:  Yeah.  So I mean, it's my everyday life.
L:  Really? 
R:  Checking emails and whatnot.
L:  Oh, God, I know, keeping in touch with the rest of the world.
R:  Yeah.  The email is just -- I mean, I think that's one of the things that's really enhanced, is the fact that you can send an email and get in touch with fifteen people at the exact same time instead of having to call each person and tell them something.
L:  Well, that's true.  It's funny 'cause as far as a, a work tool is concerned, I don't know how I could do my job without it, but, um, I'm still on the fence as far as, you know, it being the best thing in the world for education.  Um, --
R:  Well, I think if used properly it can be.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, overall it's like, you know, if the question was, would you -- if you were having a -- if you had a school, would you want to have computers in it?
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  I mean, you know.
L:  Yeah, if -- and to anybody who's going to work in today's society needs to know how to use a computer.
R:  Exactly.
L:  For sure.  Um, ...
R:  So, overall I think it does enhance the whole education system and the education of individuals, but if used improperly it could hinder your learning ability, aptitude, and the like.  I mean, you name it.
L:  Yes.  Definitely.  Gee, I think we've covered the topic thoroughly.
R:  I think so too.
L:  I know.  I don't know how [LAUGH] how, how do we go on for ten minutes on this?
R:  I have no clue.
L:  I --
R:  I know some of the other topics are a lot, ah, easier to debate upon, or you know, get into it.
L:  Discuss at least, yes.
R:  Yeah, I mean, education is -- I mean, to me it's kinda clear, as far as with the answers to the question --
L:  I don't think there's an issue of answer, it's just a matter of pretty much of opinion. [MN]
R:  Yeah, I mean, our opinions seem to coincide with each other, so --
L:  Yeah to -- for the most part.  They, um, they really narrow -- when they initially called me they said, "The topic was education" and I have a gazillion things to say about education, but they narrowed the topic down extremely by saying, "What do you think about computer usage in schools".  I'm like, "Oh, okay". [LAUGH]
R:  Well how about, what do you think, ah, at what age should kids start using a computer in school?
L:  Um, well I think they should be introduced at a very early age, just for, um, -- 
R:  Early as in like first or second grade, or --
L:  Ah, yes, because, um, -- unfortunately yes, I, I do, I do believe so.  Because kids start getting on to the internet very quickly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, one of the things that I found is that, you know, younger children, they start getting on to the internet by themselves and they read all sorts of -- anybody can have a say on the internet.
R:  Right.
L:  And they don't have to be, you know, very smart or even very ethical, and anybody can say anything that they want to, and kids go out to these websites and they think that what they're reading is absolute fact when a lot of that stuff is just garbage of -- it's someone's opinion.  And, um, no -- being able to -- it's like, it's like being able to go to a library and use that correctly, you have to know your sources, you have to understand your sources, their background, their education, the same thing with being -- accessing information off the internet, you have to know who that person is, what their background is --
R:  Right.
L:  -- why they should be considered an expert in that field, and um, the kids learn how to use the library at a very early age, and so I think they should start, um, learning how to use the computer in the same way, be introduced in the same way.  So perhaps it wouldn't be such a fascination that it was.  I mean, kids have a tendency to get on line and do things that they shouldn't.  Let's just put it that way.
R:  You don't, you don't think that leads to them doing -- having a lot of shortcuts as far as, ah, classes like math -- math is like, you know, the primary thing that I'm thinking of.  If you can type in anything on, you know, any, like, Excel program and get an answer to something, you know, don't really have to understand the basic concepts behind it.
L:  Well that --
R:  And that's just my --
L:  The, the -- I don't think that that isn't a -- oh, God, I don't even like them using calculators in classrooms for math, let alone a computer.  
R:  Right.
L:  You know, one of the things that I find is that, you know, you know, just even with fractions, percentages and decimals, I mean, they can't do them in their head.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, they, they always have to have that calculator and they have no idea if they're spitting the wrong answer out because they've plugged the wrong numbers in, and you should be able to put in numbers and have some reasonable idea of what the answer -- what the answer is going to be close to.  And if you know your math, then you know what that answer is.  I'm not saying it's a substitute, I'm just saying they should learn how to use it properly at a young age.
R:  Okay, I agree.
L:  You know, they need to be introduced to it, and introduced to it, you know, the same way that you introduce kids to reading, writing and arithmetic.  And here's another tool.  You use a library as a tool to do your research and, and get sources for papers whatever.  And you use this computer here to get another source of information.
R:  Right.
L:  But I think they need to be taught at a young age.  And kids -- basically the kids are fascinated with computers.  So, the sooner you introduce them to the proper use, the better off they'll be, you know.
R:  I agree.
L:  There -- I mean, there's all sorts of software out there for the little kids.  They, um, they start touting it at a very very early age, so if the schools are going to be on board with, you know, computer usage, well, you know, start at a young age and teach them how to use it wisely.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I don't know.
R:  Yeah, I totally agree.  I mean, I agree in that sense, overall computers definitely enhances the whole learning experience and can definitely make things a lot better.
L:  It's really -- my, my, my son has been telling me all through junior high school and high school that we had to have access to the internet, and I was, "No" -- I was not happy about that.  
R:  Mm.
L:  And we have a computer, but I just didn't want access to the internet.  And, ah, I have that at work and I really don't need it at home.  And he said, "He couldn't possibly get through high school without it".  And low and behold, he has.
R:  Oh, he has?
L:  Yes, he has.  And he's done very very well for himself too.  I mean, it's just old fashioned research, going to the library and, you know, if worst comes to the worst I look up stuff for him on -- at work, or, um, he'll go to one of his friends' house, or he'll we -- they have a, you know, very sophisticated lab, computer lab at his high school so he can go there and look the stuff up also.  But you know, when you've got, you know, a kid that's home by himself all the time, and you know, 'cause I work full time, and there's access to the internet, you know, I mean, when they're young, you just worry about that.
R:  A lot of garbage comes off the internet.
L:  Oh, lot a lot a garbage.  And they have these websites where kids write gossip down and it just gets distributed all over the place too, and I was just -- some of the stuff that was out there was just pretty appalling.
R:  Yeah, it's pretty -- yeah, I totally agree with you on the strength of that.
L:  Mm.
R:  The internet is definitely something you need as far as a research tool goes, but it's a lot of -- you waste a lot of time with it.
L:  Oh, definitely.  Definitely.  Um, no, um, are you in college?
R:  Yeah, I'm in college.
L:  Yeah.  Are you, um, what are you studying with, ah, computers?
R:  Well, I'm a business major.
L:  Oh, are you really?  Oh, good for you.
R:  So.  I mean, I pretty much have to use a computer every day.
L:  Yeah, well I, I would imagine you would be.
R:  So, um, --
L:  Now, where do you go to school?
R:  University of Texas.
L:  Oh really -- are you calling from Texas?
R:  Yes, I am.
L:  Oh, that is so cool.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Where are you located at?
L:  I -- we're up in Connecticut.
R:  Oh, okay.  Wow, okay.
L:  It is, ah, quite a -- quite a distance.
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  So, wow.  And your name again was?
R:  Ray.
L:  Ray.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, you were -- are you on a cellphone?
R:  Yes, I am.
L:  Yeah, I could tell.
R:  Is it hard to hear me?
L:  I beg your pardon?
R:  Is it hard to hear?
L:  Sometimes you bobble in and out just a bit.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But cellphones are notorious
