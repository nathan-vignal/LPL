R:  Hello? 
L:  Hi.  My name is Louise. 
R:  My name is Jennifer.
L:  Hi, Jennifer. I'm -- 
R:  Hi.
L:  I live in Florida.
R:  And I'm in Virginia.
L:  Oh, nice speaking with you.
R:  Good to talk --
L:  I -- I -- 
R:  -- to talk to you.
L:  I guess the topic is family, what it means to us. [NOISE]  You want to start or do you want me to start?
R:  Um, go ahead.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] Um, to me, let's see, ah, family is a group of people who are very supportive of one another, um, who are there when you need to talk to somebody or a pat on the back, or congratulations, or a pick me up when you seem to have tripped and fallen on your face.  Um, I think it's someone to -- a group of people that -- that, um, share, um, -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I think we share everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think there's anything that you don't share really.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Sometimes you can't help but share. [LAUGH]
L:  Tha- -- that is very true, that is very true.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I think there's just different components to a family.  Um, some families are single parents and some families have multiple parents, ah, with -- with divorces that, you know, you'll have two sets of moms and two sets of dads.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I would consider that's an extended family. [NOISE]
R:  Yes. 
L:  And then you've got -- sometimes you're in for the adopted family that, um, you pick up along the way, you know, but, um, someone that lives next door becomes an -- like, an adopted grandparent or something like that.
R:  Right. 
L:  I think -- I think that kind constitutes a family member. [NOISE] 
R:  Right.  Um, [LIPSMACK] to me family is, ah, I first -- first of all, I think about my own family and think about really family causes me the most happiness and the most str-  stress. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Of everything in my life.  You know, family causes me the most happiness, the most stress.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, so, it's like a rollercoaster of  emotions and, um, that's how I identify myself first and foremost as a mom and a wife.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  And, so, to me family is the most important thing in my life, um, and then I guess next I think, when I think about family next I go to, like, my mom and my dad, that's -- that family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, think about the support that they all give me.  I'm -- I'm more supportive towards my family that I live in the hou- -- you know, my family with my kids, I'm more of the support one and then my parents and sisters give me lots of support.  So, it kind of -- it's kind of a, ah, we fall back on each other becau- -- when I get worn out from supporting this family -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. Yeah.
R:  -- they help me, you know, build my -- build me back up and help me so I can be strong and help my family.  Um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  It's a back up system.
R:  Mhm, yeah, they really are, and, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] what else?  Ah, and, you know, along the same lines with bef- -- what I was saying before, you know, they -- well, I guess, you know, there's nothing -- well, I guess that would be the same thing as I was saying before.  Um, --
L:  I don't think in -- in a family situation, um, that there's anything that's too big or too little, too silly or too serious that can't be addressed as a family unit. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I --
R:  That's just somebody you can be yourself, you can always be yourself around your family.
L:  Right.
R:  And they're not going to think, ah, that you're, you know, anything negative usually about you and just accept you for who you are, and -- 
L:  I also think you can -- you can -- you can make additions to your family, of course thi- -- it wouldn't be a blood relation but sometimes you make friendships with people that are so close that they almost become brothers and sisters to you, or -- or moms and dads to you. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  And -- and that -- that in itself would constitute a form of a family, um, like I said earlier not necessarily a blood family, a blood line, but a family nonetheless.  Like, if you belong to a spiritual group, whether it be a church or whatever.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That would be another family, um, -- [NOISE]
R:  People that you rely on.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think it's just a -- a matter of -- of support, I think, um, whether you have the support system in place or you don't have a suppor- -- support system in place.  Whether you feel that, um, you're not alone.  I think that's got a lot to do with it.  If you've got family of some kind then you don't feel alone.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  I remember, ah, when I went to college I went to a state where I didn't know anyone.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] I remember think- -- you know, I had room mates and everything but still it wasn't the same and I remember thinking -- and I was far away, on the other side of the country from where my home was.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Where my family was, and so I remember thinking, you know, "If I were to get in a car accident, you know, and need to go to hospital, would anyone -- there'd be no one here that would really be worried so much", you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] so, you know, family is, you know, -- it -- I did feel more alone when I was without my family, when I didn't have --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- those family ties, and then eventually living out there I met my husband, my -- who was to be my husband, and his family became my family and, so, I just felt so much more support, you know, local support and -- and my whole attitude just changed, so ... 
L:  Oh, there -- there -- there's a security level involved as well.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  Um, I think that's very important.  Um, I also think that sometimes, [NOISE] families, blood families, um, can also be like you said, the negative part of your life where they -- they are the cause of stress.
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  Um, and then it depends on how we handle it.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  Because  I --
R:  Well, right now -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the mom to two young kids, so I have a lot of --
L:  Ooh.
R:  I have a three year old and an eight month old, so ...
L:  Oh, my gosh!
R:  So, I -- you know, like I said, it cau- -- nothing causes me the most, you know, as much happiness as my kids and my -- my husband and -- but no- nothing causes me as much stress as trying to, you know, deal with my three year old's hundred thousand questions and deal with her whining --
L:  Oh, I know. 
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Oh, sure, because my -- my baby is going to be twenty five in about, um, a week and a half.
R:  Wow!
L:  So, um, when I look back and I remember what -- what was very important, ah, family wise, you know, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [NOISE] the amount of energy [NOISE] we -- I used then certainly is very different than what I use now.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] More then was the parenting that was needed, um, and the family participation in raising the children, you know, um, --
R:  Right.
L:  Wi- with my own parents helping me and -- and their father and all that, but now my job is just that I can sit back kind of and just be mom.
R:  Right.
L:  Which is kind of neat, you know, because -- 
R:  More supportive than --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Less physically demanding. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Oh, it's still demanding because when they get bigger their problems seem to be, um, bigger.
R:  Right, that's true.
L:  Um, and, you know, like when they are little and they fall and you kiss their boo boos and it's okay.
R:  Right.
L:  Wh- when they get older, their boo boos sometimes get bigger and it's like, "What the heck were you thinking?" [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right. Well, I think --
L:  You know? 
R:  -- now it -- wi- -- you know, the mo- -- being the mom of -- or a parent of young children, I'm -- I -- it's a more -- it's more of a physical challenge.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I stay home with my kids and, so, I'm with them all day long and, um, it's just a constant, you know, bluh[?] bluh, like, just physical and then I feel like my mom's is more -- where my mom is now -- 
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- um, it's probably kind of where you are where her children are older.  Hers is more an emotional, you know, --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- there's mor- -- more emotionally demanding than physically demanding.
L:  Well, yeah, because we can't fix -- we as -- we -- parents to growing children, we can't, um, we can't just reach out and put a band-aid on it.
R:  Right.
L:  Or -- and -- and we're really limited as to how much information, you know, um, yo- you -- what you try to do is yo- you give them an opinion without [LAUGH] giving them an opinion.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know?
R:  Without being too forceful, right.
L:  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  That makes it very difficult sometimes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But nonetheless you're still family, so that gives you kind of the right to -- to have an opinion.
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know?  Um, and -- and it -- you know, um, and this is just my opinion, maintaining a family, um, as -- as fam- -- well, a family unit say, is, I think, one of the most difficult jobs that we have in our -- in both of our lives because it is so very important to be maintained.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think it is a very difficult thing to keep in some kind of balance or some kind of check.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  [NOISE]  Um, be- because there's so many variables.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  Um, if we could live on -- each of us live on an -- our own island and make our own rules and no one else would, you know, interfere with them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, we wouldn't have to worry --
R:  Right.
L:  -- about stuff, but that's not the way it is.  So that, I think, is an added stress, too.
R:  Right.
L:  To keep our family safe.
R:  Yes.
L:  Right?
R:  You try to protect. [MN] 
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  You know, on all levels. [MN]
L:  Oh, definitely, because this is a really, um, wacky world. 
R:  Right.
L:  Um, the things that you're facing now with your little ones I didn't have to face, and the things that I faced --
