L:  You have a big family then.  
R:  I sure do. 
L:  You all live together.
R:  I sure do, yeah.
L:  That's great.
R:  Yeah.  So, what would -- what -- what is in your opinion, what would you consider family?  Would that be people that just, ah, relate -- blood related or would it be extend to more, um, --
L:  Oh, -- 
R:  -- close friends and --
L:  Yeah.  For -- yeah, to me family is close people in my life.  I mean, I consider my best friend family.
R:  Mhm. [MN] 
L:  You know what I mean?  It's not like a thanks- -- I don't believe it is like a Thanksgiving type of thing where the family is going to get together.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's who we truly care about.
R:  Right.  I think I share the same feeling, too.
L:  Yeah.

L:  Right.
R:  Who live nea- near us and those are the people that we really, ah, um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- rely on in times of, ah, trouble or, you know.
L:  Because they're your family, right. 
R:  Yes, exactly.  So that's more on our -- um, so, I mean, family when we're away from the -- the blood related ones. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, yeah, yeah.  
R:  So ...
L:  I -- I'm -- I'm the same way.  I have -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  I have -- I'm a single -- well, I'm a single mu- -- well, I'm not.  I'm married but I'm kind of separated --
R:  Oh, sorry to hear that.

R:  Mhm. 
L:  Ah, dysfunctional family I'm having right now. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.

R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Um, this is my first husband.  I've -- I -- I didn't get --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- I was, you know, in high school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I was eighteen when I had my son and --
R:  I see.
L:  You know, I chose -- I wanted to make a family of my own.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  I wanted -- I wanted to have a family so that I could, you know, make my own traditions for Thanksgiving and Christmas and -- 
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- all the stuff like that because some day our older family -- some day we are going to be the ones in charge of that because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- everybody else will be gone.
R:  Right. 
L:  We grow up.
R:  Right.
L:  We grow up.
R:  Right, right.
L:  So -- so, yeah, I chose to make a family of my own.  So I have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my son and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's the only child I will ever have.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But my family, my personal family is also -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Not -- not very involved because my -- well, I'm thirty two and both my mother and father --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- remarried when they got divorced.
R:  Mm, mhm.
L:  And they -- I was a single child until I was eighteen -- until I was seventeen years old. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  So, right now, as of -- I mean, I have a brother that is the same age as my child.
R:  Mm, really?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, yeah, I was an only child in my family --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then all of a sudden one day I was an adult and I had six brothers and sisters.
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Yeah, my mum has twin sisters and my dad and his --
R:  [SIGH]  Ah.
L:  -- well, the twin girls, they are sixteen.
R:  Yeah, wow.
L:  My dad and his wife have twenty one year old, a twenty year old, -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, a fifteen year old.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, well, another child who died at birth.
R:  Yeah.  Wel- -- yo- you know, these days the word family I guess --
L:  [MN]
R:  Is meant quite different from the past, because in the past you used to be a family just mean a mother, a father and --
L:  The children.
R:  -- their kids, you know. 
L:  I agree, I agree.
R:  Whereas these days with -- you know, how the society, are they, I mean, there a lot of div- -- unfortunate a lot of divorce happening, you know.  It's a common thing now.
L:  Right, yeah, it -- it really is.
R:  You know, divorce and remarry.  So your family becoming quite an extended one [LAUGH] because most of the time your -- you have, ah, um, father or mother who remarried.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then you have your step brother or step sisters.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know.
L:  It's a good -- it becomes a big blended family.
R:  It sure does. [LAUGH]  It sure does.
L:  That was the word I was looking for, blended.
R:  Blended, right. [LAUGH]
L:  It's 'cause -- yeah, it -- it gets very blended nowadays and it really does. And -- 
R:  Mhm, mhm.  Yeah.  In a way it's good if, you know, the adults could keep the good terms, you know.
L:  Right, keep peace, yeah.
R:  Yeah, because I have -- I do have a friend who have quite an extended family because she has divorced and remarried at least twice, I think. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well, my -- my mother was five times.
R:  Oh, my gosh. [LAUGH]
L:  Messed up, dysfunctional family we're talking about.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's why I never got married.  I said, "I'm never going to do that".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's -- it was crazy.  That is crazy family.
R:  Oh, ahah. 
L:  I -- I mean, that's dysfunctional.
R:  Oh.  Well, --
L:  So twice is nothing. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't think so. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  No, my -- my friend she -- she used to joke, "Oh, our family is a dysfunctional one", but then truth is they -- they're able to kind of make it work -- I mean, not -- not in a perfect world.
L:  You get stro- -- 
R:  -- but -- but in a way they can still make it work where, you know, --
L:  You become stronger.
R:  -- they kind to feel, like, -- yeah, exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Civilized to each other and they help each other.  So --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in a way that's good, you know.
L:  Right.  It helps you to, um, -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  It -- it helps you to get along with -- 
R:  Mhm. [MN] 
L:  -- all different types and situations and I -- I think it has helped me as an adult.
R:  That's great.  Yeah, that's great.  Mhm.
L:  Because, you know, like -- like I said, I have done everything different than my mother did with me.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Because I -- I watched all that and it made me as a stronger person I am -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- having such a big huge family -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when I became an adult. So --
R:  Yeah, you know, you learn.  You learn from, um, from your family.  So ...
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I don't -- my -- my son --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- doesn't have the family that most little -- that most teenagers have.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because his grandma and grandpa are busy taking care of their own young kids.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They don't want to babysit, they want me to babysit! 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So -- so, it really -- [LAUGH]
R:  That's funny.
L:  You know, it's -- it's really true.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  I mean, yeah, my -- they are, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're busy taking care of their own kids.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They don't want to -- sure, they love their grandson. 
R:  Right, right.
L:  That's their family but, hey, they don't -- they don't -- they're not begging --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They're not the grandma and grandpa that are begging, "Oh, can we take the kid?"  They're going, "Take mine, please!" 
R:  [LAUGH]  That's -- that's the twenty first century family, I can say.
L:  Exac- -- yes, yes.  I -- yeah.
R:  Oh, funny.  But, you know, thank God for, um, friends and, ah, you know, just people who are close to us.
L:  Right.
R:  Because a lot of time you can rely on them. 
L:  Definitely.
R:  Ah, if your family can't be there for you, so.  For us, um, especially we'r -- because we are far away from, ah, --
L:  Your home.
R:  -- our family.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, relatives, close relatives, we, um, we have our own group of friends who are -- who are also -- most of them actually don't really have their -- a close family, ah, living close with them.
L:  Okay.
R:  So we ended up, like, bonded like we are their family.
L:  You are kind of in the same situation.
R:  Yeah. Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  So it's -- So you have a lot to relate to.
R:  Right.  So if -- if you -- if you come to, like, our Christmas or Thanksgiving gathering it will be most like our family and then bunch of friends. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, because they're family, yeah.
R:  Right, right.
L:  You consider them -- yeah, you just consider them family. 
R:  Right.
L:  A part of the family.
R:  Yeah, because to them they are -- they're our family, so ... 
L:  Yeah, I -- I agree.  I was just going to say --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like -- like lots -- I mean, even shelters -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and stuff like that nowadays.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It doesn't matter, you don't have to be family because everybody is considered family if you care about somebody.
R:  Mhm, exactly. Yeah.
L:  I -- you know, that's how I feel about that and --
R:  Yeah, and, unfortunately, from time to time you do have problems because you are close to them, just like family.
L:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Then you have a little bit of, ah, bickering and [inaudible] -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- but then, then you really realize, okay, these are really people who we're comfortable with.  You're even comfortable to the extent of bickering with them. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We wou- -- you know, that makes me -- that makes me actually re- -- it reminds me of a -- a situation I had yesterday.
R:  Ahah.
L:  I -- I consider my best friend my -- she is my family.
R:  Mm, mhm. [MN]
L:  So it doesn't matter.  I would do anything for her because she's just like my sister.
R:  Mm, mhm.
L:  And yesterday I actually said to somebody, well, her and I, we -- we kind of had an argument.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I said to another person that I was telling her about just things that I don't want to get in -- get involved with -- 
R:  Mm, mhm.
L:  -- with -- with this stuff and I said, "But you know what", and this is what I said, I said, "It's a good thing, though", I said, "Because, you know, she's my best friend and I love her 'cause -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- she's just like my sister.
R:  Mhm.
L:  She's fam- -- she's part of my family".  I said, "But", I said -- I said, "That's the kind of" -- I said, "That's a good thing, though, because I can tell her off -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I can get mad at her, I can tell her whatever I want -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- and she'll still know that I love her!" 
R:  [LAUGH]  Right.  Just like, ah, you're with your blood relatives, I guess. Yeah. 
L:  Exactly.  It's just being close.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's being honest.  You're telling the truth, being -- being a true friend, a family --
R:  Mhm, mhm. 
L:  -- you know, type of situation.
R:  Mhm.  Well, that's -- that's great.  We even have a neighbor, this is our next do- next door neighbor that we are very close to.
L:  Mhm.
R:  A really great bunch of people and, ah, we really are open to each other, you know.  We share our, um, feelings, even, um, -- they -- they share with us their times of trouble.  Like right now they -- actually it was just a few days ago they were sharing with us about their, um, financial trouble and, you know, that -- I -- I believe that is something that you don't really share with, um, just anybody, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You --
