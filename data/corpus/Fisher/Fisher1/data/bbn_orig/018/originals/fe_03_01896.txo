R:  Hi
L:  Hi. 
R:  My name is Kerry. 
L:  My name is Marian. 
R:  Oh, nice to meet you. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So we're supposed to talk about what family means us.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay.  Um, you wanna go first, or do you want me to, or 
L:  Um.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Family, right now I want to kill my two kids.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Everybody wants me the minute the phone rings. 
R:  [LAUGH] That's how it always works doesn't it?  [LAUGH] I've got a little boy, he's, um, he's four and that's usually -- he's really good right now he's watching cartoons, but usually whenever I get on the phone that's when I'm wanted.  [LAUGH]
L:  Definitely.
R:  [LAUGH] But, um, well our family -- well what does is mean to me -- well, um, I think it's the most important thing there is, um, -- I think someone that's there for you and like som- -- you know what I mean?
L:  Yes I do.
R:  Who's always -- always there for you -- unconditional love.  Um, gosh it's hard to really describe it isn't it? 
L:  It is. 
R:  I mean I don't really know how to 
L:  My family they mean th- -- they're the most important part of my life. 
R:  Yeah that's -- that's how mine are.  You're from New York aren't you? 
L:  Massachusetts. 
R:  [LAUGH] I can tell. 
L:  [LAUGH] Where are you from? 
R:  I love your accent.  I'm from Arkansas.
L:  Oh.
R:  Can you tell?  [LAUGH]
L:  Well I know -- knew you weren't from around here.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I -- your voice -- your accents and stuff. 
L:  Um, my parents are very much of my family, um, -- my husbands parents live in Florida, and my children, you know, they talk to them on the phone politely once a week, but it's j- not the same because they don't really see them -- they don't have that closeness. 
R:  Yeah.  My mum, she's um, I was like right next door to my parents so you know that's -- you know, a lot of people are like, you know how is that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it's really -- great my mum, she's -- she's my best friend and, I get along good with my dad, and I think they're the most important things in my life, and my little boy -- and I wish my sister and me were a lot closer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We um, -- we're like twelve years apart.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So you know we didn't really grow up a lot together and every thing, but still I love her to death, and you know.  I guess when people, I don't know get married and get their own lives and stuff, just working and stuff like that it's -- get caught up in every day things, it's kind of hard to take time cause you don't have it. 
L:  See my -- my husband used to make fun -- my -- my sister was nine years older than -- me she passed away five years ago.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  And every morning I'd talked to her and then I'd see her at my mothers house because both of us, you know live within am mile of my mother. And he has three brothers and a sister and like, you know we see them on Christmas -- it's like totally different than the way I was brought up.  [PAUSE] Are you there? 
R:  Yeah.  I think that phone it sounds like it was about to disconnect, or something.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But um, sorry to hear about your sister. 
L:  Thank you.
R:  That's really hard. 
L:  And when I was young I used to be like I was the -- an only child with a sister because she got married when I was twelve, so she was out of the house. 
R:  Yeah, that sounds like me I guess me and my sister, cause she was about the time -- well no I was younger than that -- she was -- I was five I guess when she left.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And I was twelve yeah, but [PAUSE] I always wanted um, brothers and sisters my age to play with.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes me too. 
R:  When I was growing up.  But um, I couldn't imagine -- I don't know I guess on the topic of family and what it means to you, I could -- you know how like fam- -- I don't know there was um, this older lady that goes to -- goes to church with us, and she's -- I won't say that she's probably like eighty or ninety, but she never married so she never had any kids or any thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you know, just kind of wondered if she gets lonely and stuff, you know. 
L:  Yes. 
R:  Cause you know, I don't know. 
L:  I know, I can't even picture someone, you know having -- not having the same feelings towards their family as I do. 
R:  Yeah.  [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE] Can we make it pass five minutes -- I have my timer on.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Five more to go.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  This is interesting isn't it? 
L:  It is. 
R:  Is this your first time or --
L:  Yes. 
R:  This is my second.  [LAUGH]
L:  I missed my first two calls so I was finally home today. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Cause I was out with my family.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My sons play hockey, and one of them was in a tournament. 
R:  Oh.
L:  This week. 
R:  Interesting.  So how old are your kids? 
L:  Thirteen an- and seven. 
R:  Thirteen and seven.  So how are the teenage years? 
L:  Um, so far good. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Just got them interested in instant messaging.
R:  Oh.
L:  So now they're talking and talking and talking -- but he's like he a lot of times he wants to s- -- just be home and I think he thinks I'm gonna do something good without him.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well that's good -- it sounds like you are really close. 
L:  Yeah.  Does you son go to um, school or anything?
R:  Well --
L:  Preschool? 
R:  -- he did um, but um, he's -- he's not now, I had to have surgery. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, like in November, so I'd pick him up from school and every thing and I haven't returned back to work -- I was, um, a substitute teacher. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And um, well any way he um, -- he's gonna start kindergarten this year, and he's really excited.  He just thinks he's a big boy.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Now do you have full time kindergarten or half days? 
R:  Um, full time. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you all have half days there? 
L:  Um, when my older son started there were half --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- but now they're full -- full days.  There's a big difference in what they learned also. 
R:  Yeah.  When he was you know -- when he us in preschool they were -- they were already teaching him like cursive letters -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and stuff and I just couldn't -- couldn't believe it.  I was like, "oh, my goodness" but he knows his letters and he can count to think about twenty, and he um, gets on the computer on word pad and he'll do some typing and he can do his name, and he's -- he's really smart. 
L:  Yeah that's amazing. 
R:  Yeah.  But he's ex- -- he's excited he just had his um, shots yesterday.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He had to have three shots for school, so he had those and he was really -- he was really big.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So how long have you been married? 
L:  I've been married for seventeen years. 
R:  Oh, wow. 
L:  How about you? 
R:  Well I'm not married. 
L:  Okay. 
R:  I am not married right now, but I- -- I'm dating someone.  We've been -- we've been dating um, this August will be two years. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And we're talking marriage and stuff.  He's a -- he's a great guy, I didn't think there were any good ones left. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Cause after um, -- well anyways Zachary's biological father he was just a -- oh, he was terrible. 
L:  Could you repeat that please? 
R:  My son's biological father --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- he was just terrible.
L:  Oh.
R:  He doesn't -- he doesn't have anything to do with him -- he signed away his rights and stuff. 
L:  Feel like my phone -- I'm on a regular phone but it -- your voice was like fading in and out. 
R:  I think it might be my phone line it's been messing up. 
L:  Um, I didn't get married till I was thirty two. 
R:  Oh, really. 
L:  So ar- are you -- are you young? 
R:  I'm twenty six. 
L:  Mhm.  So don't be in the hurry.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And a lot of them were making fun of me because I wouldn't change my maiden name and it was because all my friends were getting divorced before I even got married. 
R:  [LAUGH] Well I think I'm like probably about the only one probably my age who hasn't been married yet here.
