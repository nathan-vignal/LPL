L:  Hi, my name is Val, I'm from New -- New Jersey. 
R:  Hi, my name's Darlene, I'm from Lancaster.
L:  As in Pennsylvania?
R:  Yes.
L:  Very good.  So, um, how many calls have you done so far?
R:  This is my first one.
L:  Okay, this, this is my second, I did -- did one last night.
R:  Okay.
L:  So.  What do you do?
R:  I'm a nurse.
L:  Okay.  I happen to be a -- an education administrator.
R:  Okay.
L:  So.
R:  So I guess you would think computers are pretty important.
L:  Well, it, it kinda depends.  I mean, I, I wasn't sure, you know, how specific they were gonna get with the topic of education.  Um, you know, I think, I think technology education is port- important, um, I'm not sure, you know, I, I don't think computers are going to replace teachers as an instructional tool.
R:  Right.
L:  I, I think they're a nice thing to, um, you know, just to be able to supplement, to be able to, you know, have kids drill and practise so that the teacher can maybe spend one on one time with kids.  But, you know, I don't, I don't see them as being, you know, the be all and end all of education.
R:  Right, I would agree with you on that.  Um, I guess I just look at it -- I mean, I know I didn't really have computers growing up, um, too much, with, you know, my education and stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, not until later actually when I was in nursing school and stuff, so I guess I look at it now, um, you know, all the elementary schools and all that kind of stuff are being taught right away of how to use the internet, and I agree with you, I don't think computers are going to replace a teacher, and I don't think anything -- anybody can replace that.  Um, I guess I just kinda feel like though they are a good, good source of information.  Um, just more on the lines I guess -- more with the internet aspect -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that, you know, things are so much easier at hand.  But I guess on the same time you kinda lose the aspect of a library, um, you know, for kids to do their own type of research in that aspect.
L:  Well, I'll tell you what though, I mean, you know, I mean, libraries are nice, but you know, the, the quality of information you have at your fingertips with the internet is pretty amazing.  And, and, you know, you, you can find things on the internet that, that you have no idea really where to start even looking for in, in the traditional research front, research process.  And, and so, you know, I think the internet's important that way.
R:  Yeah, once again, as I said, I know I used it a lot just in some of my research projects for, for my nursing education and stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it definitely was a lot easier because, I mean, I had obviously the comforts of my own home that I didn't have to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to go to the university and stuff and do that, because I was a non traditional student, did live at home, and, you know, commuted to school and everything.  So it's like, I had all that resources right there.
L:  I'll tell you what, I mean, you know, speaking of that, you know, for -- for post secondary education computers are really becoming kind of important.
R:  Mhm.
L:  As you've experienced.
R:  Yeah, I guess a lot, a lot of stuff's actually being done on -- maybe not necessarily on line, but the teleconferencing type things are now being done through them for a lot of the post -- as you said there's graduate schools and all that kind of stuff, people are able to do that kind of stuff now.
L:  Well, I know where I've taken at least one, one course on line, my husband's taken a course on line --
R:  Now, do you like that?
L:  Um, well I mean, you know, there, there are, there are benefits and there are, there are drawbacks.  But, I, I know I was satisfied with the course that I took, um, I -- my husband though took music appreciation and I'm guessing that, you know, maybe, maybe he would of liked to have been in a traditional setting, you know, with, with traditional instruments even.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, he had access to the computer keyboard and also, you know, a musical keyboard, but I don't think that was the same for that particular course.
R:  Right.  Yeah, you know, I think that would be kind of weird, especially that kind of course, not to actually be in a classroom where you could actually experience the live instruments and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, depending on how advanced it is and everything.  That's one -- I mean, I never, I haven't done any type of, of courses ever, you know, on line or anything like that.  I do know it's a lot easier, though, to type the paper on the computer versus the typewriter. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I know it.  It's incredible.
R:  Those, those mistakes you used to make on a regular typewriter, it's just so much easier to correct on a computer, especially with the spell checks these days.
L:  Oh, yeah.  And that's another thing, you know, that technology gives people access to higher education that, that wouldn't of had it before.  'Cause again I work in special ed, and, and you know, with, with, like, the voice recognition technology emerging, a lot of my kids who have dyslexia or other types or learning disabilities, you know, can now, like, dictate their papers to the computer.
R:  Okay.
L:  And of course, you know, they've always had access to books on tape, you know, and things like that to assist kids in college with their learning disabilities, but with the computer technology's just made it that much easier.
R:  Right.  Now, what grades do you teach?
L:  We have anywhere from fourth grade through high school.
R:  Okay.
L:  We're a private residential school.  Um, do --
R:  Is that -- I'm sorry, go ahead.
L:  I was going to ask if you have kids of your own.
R:  No, I do not.
L:  You know, if, if you've seen the impact first hand one way or the other.
R:  No, I haven't -- I actually haven't, you know, other than what I've used it for and stuff.  Um, I know I, I actually have quite a few nieces and nephews --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I know they all use it, and I know, I mean, it's -- as I said, just kind of about the typewriter aspect, it's, you know, when I was younger and doing the papers like that, you know, I used to get my mom or my dad to help me type it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- where I know, I know, like, my nieces and nephews nowadays, you know, they do it all themselves because it is so much easier just to use the keyboard itself.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, on the computer versus an actual typewriter.  But no, I haven't actually seen it.  I -- I think some of the downfalls of it is though, I do, do hear a lot of my, um, siblings telling me that their children get on -- just, you know, get on the internet just to do the chats.
L:  Right.
R:  So it's not being used for an educational purpose which, in my, you know, in our family's homes I don't think the computer is full -- you know, fully bought for educational purposes, it, you know, was bought for other reasons, but I think sometimes they do take too much time when they're at home, just to get on the chat lines that are available, and you know, it's like, -- I don't think it's really affecting any of them, but, ah, once again I don't see it first hand.
L:  Right, I know, it's you that -- you know, there's a concern that, that kids in general are becoming much less active --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not only because of computers but because of TV, VCR, DVD, video games.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, all that stuff.  
R:  Definitely.  It is.  I mean it's -- I, I do see it, especially with my one nephew, I mean, he'd rather just, you know, play the, the Playstation and the Gameboy and stuff like that, um, now he doesn't actually get on the computer too much, but he has all the other games and he does -- doesn't do the activities, the outdoor activities.  Um, which once again I don't know how much computers would really affect that -- you know, I guess if you get the games for that too.
L:  Well, you know, I just know that, you know, when I was a kid, I mean, my parents didn't want me -- want us watching TV and there wasn't anything else to do.  You know, I can remember being thrown out of the house on a nice day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Go --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- play.  You know, we'd have to go out and figure out something to do.
R:  Yep, yeah, I -- I remember those days well. [LAUGH] And I don't think there's anything wrong with that, I just think kids too nowadays need to be pushed more to go out and do that and not sit in front of the TV or wha- you know, whatever their other sources and stuff.
L:  I'll tell you what, I was speaking with a first grade teacher the other day, and again I don't know if this is, this is the function of computers or what it is, but she was saying that her kids, she's noticed the decrease in creativity over the years.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  That, you know, kids are far less imaginative now than they were when she first started teaching.  And she's ten years older than I am, so she's been teaching about twenty five years at least, I bet.  So, you know, she, she says that even when she does an art project she hates to show a model, 'cause if she shows them a model they'll do exactly what she's done.
R:  That's kind of interesting.
L:  Rather than, you know, trying to, trying to do a variation on what she's done.
R:  Right.
L:  But again I don't know if that's a function of computers or --
R:  Or just even.
L:  Or just, you know, all the medial bombardment.
R:  Right.  Now, do you have any children?
L:  No, I don't.
R:  Okay.
L:  Just the ones I teach.
R:  [LAUGH] That's probably enough sometimes.
L:  It certainly is.  But um, you know, it's, it's worked out well over the years, 'cause again I work at a residential school, so, um, you know, I take kids out on weekends sometimes, and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- it's kind of like having grandkids, you know, it's like, if you want a kid I can have a kid.  If I don't want a kid --
R:  Give them back. [LAUGH]
L:  Give them back.
R:  That's not a bad deal. [LAUGH]
L:  Not at all.  Not at all.
R:  It is kind of a shame, you just kind of sometimes wonder what, you know, what will happen as we get older and these are -- this is the generation that will be taking care of us --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- and it's just kinda like, you know, what's going to happen?  As you say, you know, is it -- is it the sign of technology that's kinda getting kids less -- whether it's motivated or innovated, you know, to, to learn and do things on their own
