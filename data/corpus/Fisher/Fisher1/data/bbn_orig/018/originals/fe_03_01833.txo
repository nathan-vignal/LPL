R:  Hi -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- my name is Karen.
L:  Hi, my name is Joan.
R:  Hi, Joan.
L:  How are you? 
R:  I'm fine.  How are you? 
L:  Good, thank you. [MN] 
R:  Good.
L:  Where you calling from? 
R:  Arizona. 
L:  Arizona, okay.  I'm from New York.  And do you have children in school? [NOISE]  
R:  No, all my children are out -- 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- thankfully. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I have a, um, ten year old that's in school. [NOISE] 
R:  Well, what do you think about computers in school? 
L:  I think they're great. [NOISE] 
R:  I do too.  I have a seventeen year old who graduated two years early --  
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, she went to a -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, alternative type school that -- it was computer based --  
L:  Oh, really? [NOISE] 
R:  -- and, um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they use computers for everything -- 
L:  [NOISE] Wow. [NOISE] 
R:  And, um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that they could work at their own pace.
L:  [NOISE] Sure. [NOISE] 
R:  And, um, they had other kids who were slower and, you know, other kids who were faster and things like that and she was able to graduate at sixteen, so -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- yeah.
L:  Now she's that far ahead --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- already.  That's wonderful, that's wonderful. [NOISE] 
R:  Right [LIPSMACK] so, yeah, I -- I think they're a great idea.
L:  Yeah, I think they're -- they're good.  My daughter goes to  -- she's in, ah, gifted program at school that, um, you know, they do a lot of things on the computer but more creative than educational right now but, ah, ... I always say, I keep saying for m- -- I -- I work for an attorney's office and I know that there's just so many things in the computer -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- system that I don't even know --  
R:  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  -- and she -- if I go to try and do thing something on the computer she's -- she's eleven and I call her and she can help me with it --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know [NOISE] so, basically she  -- I think they -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- use them almost every day in school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, [NOISE] but [LIPSMACK] I think it's a wonderful idea. [NOISE]  
R:  [NOISE] I do too.  The only thing that -- that bothers me is them -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- not being able to -- if they depend on them so much that they can't -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- um, do things, um, in their head --  
L:  Right, right, [MN] --  
R:  -- or like look up something in a dictionary --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or -- or a thesaurus themselves --  
L:  There's no more going to the library and doing your reports --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.  Basically they do most of it -- most of the research at home now --  
R:  Right --  
L:  -- you know. 
R:  -- and times that's good because parent a lot of times don't have time to take -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- them --  
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know, if -- if you have a two -- two parent working family --  
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, and you have kids who need to go to the library after school --  
L:  Yeah, sure.
R:  -- um, it -- it is really hard --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, so I guess that is a double edged sword --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- kind of, because it's a good idea --  
L:  I mean I know when I was younger y- I could just go to the library by myself at that age and think nothing of it.  I don't think -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I would really want her to be there by herself, you know --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, and like you said if I'm working and then come home from work to make dinner and go to the library after work [LAUGH] --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I have a two year old [LAUGH] --  
R:  Oh.   
L:  -- you know. 
R:  That makes it hard.
L:  Yeah, yeah, she's --  
R:  That -- that doesn't make it very easy  for you, it makes it convenient for you to --
L:  It does.   
R:  -- to not have to take your two year old out --  
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- also, um, I just -- I just don't want a generation of um, people --  
L:  That that's all they know --
R:  -- who don't know how to add things -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- or subtract things and, you know -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that they always depend on --
L:  Right, right, because that's all they know -- 
R:  -- on a machine, they consider --
L:  -- you know, now especially if you're just starting school now basically -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, because I remember when she started I think she was like in second grade when they first started it and she was, you know, so upset that she couldn't type and now three years later she can type almost just as fast as I can.  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah, yeah, you know.  So, that -- that way I mean they're definitely -- they're definitely learning a lot from it [MN] and in our school they said, you know, they sent a letter home if you want permission for your child to go on the internet for --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- certain things, like -- I -- I guess some parents don't want their kids on the internet at all --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, and of course the school says that they, you know, they block anything that they shouldn't be going into, but I mean I know from just having the computer here even though she's blocked there's things that pop up on the computer that she shouldn't see [NOISE] -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and that's -- that sets -- that the worse part it's like I have to be, you know, I have to check on -- all the time --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- just to see where she's going or if somebody --  you know, she'll be talking to someone one night and I'm like, "Well, whose this person, I don't know they just instant messaged me".  I said, "Then you say good bye to them right now" --  
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- you know, you don't know who you're -- 
R:  That is scary  --
L:  -- talking to.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'm -- I don't know -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- if they're allowed to do that at school --  
L:  I don't think they are --  
R:  -- or not -- 
L:  -- i don't think they have the instant message or anything.
R:  -- um, I don't think I would like it because I don't think if -- as you said, I don't think that one teacher could, um, --  
L:  [NOISE] yeah, keep an eye on, ah -- 
R:  -- where thirty children are --  
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  -- at one time and what's on their screen. 
L:  Right, right.  I know that they, you know, they -- they had meetings about it and everything even before they would allow any sort of internet access at the school, you know, and then there were -- there were parents that -- that, no, they didn't want their children to be it on at all, and they said, "Fine", you know, "Then your child won't definitely be on a computer that had one", you know. 
R:  [NOISE] I think that's a good idea.
L:  Yeah, yeah, definitely.
R:  You know, I know even with my seventeen year old when she's on the computer I -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I stop by and look and --  
L:  Yeah, oh, yeah, -- 
L:  -- And see, so, what --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  What she's  --
L:  Yeah [NOISE]  
R:  -- what she's doing on -- 
L:  [NOISE] yeah.
R:  -- it because you don't know people --  
L:  No, you don't.
R:  -- you know [LAUGH]  
L:  You don't know [several inaudible words] they think they're chatting with another teenager and are it's a forty year old guy, you know, --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- you just hear of too many nightmare stories --  
R:  Mhm, exactly.
L:  -- for that and that [NOISE] way -- it's -- it's -- oh, my cell -- my phone is starting up, I'm just going to go switch to my other phone --  
R:  Okay.
L:  I'm talking too much today [NOISE] Are you still there, [NOISE] Hello? 
R:  I'm here.
L:  Okay, good [LAUGH].  I didn't want to lose you. [MN] But how many children do you have? 
R:  I have two.
L:  Two, okay.
R:  And then I have two step children.
L:  Okay, mm, that keeps you busy I'm sure -- 
R:  Oh, yeah -- 
L:  -- now, do you use the computer yourself --
R:  -- one granddaughter [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, wow.  How old is she? 
R:  Um, sixteen months.
L:  Oh, yeah, my son will be two in a couple of months that's a cute age --  
R:  Oh, she's great.
L:  -- you know, but he'll sit -- he'll sit on my daughter's lap when, you know, when she'll go into, like, Sesame Street and stuff like that and he -- he already wants to be on the computer, you know.  So, it's by the time they go to preschool nowadays they probably do know how to use the computer -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know. [NOISE]  
R:  Yeah, I've seen some small ones, um, you know, for toddlers --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that are called My First Computer or something like that.
L:  Right. 
R:  And I wondered about buying her one. 
L:  Mhm, that -- 
R:  You know does -- 
L:  -- that -- that's probably --  
R:  -- does it get her ahead? 
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- you know, does she have an advantage if she uses it, you know, when she goes to school? 
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] and probably will because, you know, nowadays if you don't put your children in preschool by the time they get to kindergarten they're behind, you know, they're teaching them how to [MN] almost read before they even get to kindergarten some children --  
R:  Yep.
L:  -- you know, so --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- I mean I think it's gonna be a very computer based world even --  
R:  [NOISE] it is, and I think of  --
L:  -- I mean -- it is so much more, you know, and I know there is so much more there to learn but -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- I can't fit that into my schedule [LAUGH] but I would love to learn more --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know. [MN]  
R:  Well, I was kinda forced to because, um, -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I'm disabled and I'm -- I, um, -- I'm not able to work outside my home --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so, the income that I do make is now off the internet --  
L:  Okay. 
R:  -- [NOISE] and, um, that was, you know, people find that fascinating that I'm able to earn any kind of income --
L:  Sure.   
R:  -- off the internet --  
L:  Sure -- 
R:  -- [MN] 
L:  -- do you do all different kinds of things like that this?
R:  Um, yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, um, b- but a lot of different things.
L:  Right, right. 
R:  So, um, but, um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I think computers in school are a great idea --  
L:  Oh, [MN] you have to there them nowadays, you know -- 
R:  Um, -- 
L:  -- you really do -- 
R:  -- ah, --  
L:  -- and -- 
R:  -- I -- I think the children who don't are going to be behind in the --  
L:  Absolutely  --
R:  In the real world  --
L:  -- absolutely and I'm sure there is a lot of schools out there that don't have them, you know --  
R:  Because of money issues.
L:  Right, right, you know --  
R:  You know, it's not cheap to set up, um,  -- I'm sure it is not cheap to set up a network --  
L:  Oh, not at all  --
R:  -- you know, for each school.
L:  Yeah, no.  It's got to be very expensive and if you -- you don't have the money in your budget, you know, or you just heard something on TV on [MN] Long Island, New York and they just said a school -- you know, not -- not too close but they -- they just had four hundred thousand dollars worth of vandalism  --
R:  Oh, --
L:  -- or their computers -- 
L:  -- my gosh.
R:  -- were ruined.  Yeah, right, so you know how long that is going to take em --
R:  That's a -- I mean that's almost half a million --  
L:  Right.   
R:  -- dollars  --
L:  Right, yeah --  
R:  -- you know. 
L:  -- so, --
R:  -- that is a lot of money.
L:  You know, that's gonna be -- all -- all those children, you know, who knows how long it's going to take them to, ah, -- to get that money back to the get the computers, so --  
R:  But the -- the children who, you know, don't have them in their schools because their school systems are poor --
L:  Right  --
R:  -- like in the hills of Virginia --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, you know, places that are kind of backwards still and we do have a lot of places like that still.   
L:  Yeah.
R:  And in the United States even though it's kinda unbelievable --  
L:  Sure, sure.
R:  -- um, but, um, I know several people who I've -- who I've talked to on -- on online --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, um, their church has dir- a dirt floor --  
L:  Wow.
R:  -- you know -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- you know, um, she's -- she's posted pictures of some of the homes around there and, you know, and they're -- they're shacks --  
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and some of them don't have running water, some of them -- 
L:  Oh, my  --
R:  -- don't have --
L:  -- goodness --
R:  -- electricity and it's --
L:  So, they probably have no clue what they're even missing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because they don't know about it? 
R:  And how far behind are their children --
L:  Sure.   
R:  -- gonna be?
L:  Exactly.
R:  When they go out into the real word an- and how much of a chance are they going to have to get out of there -- 
L:  Right, right, well, that's it, that's a cycle that repeats itself.
