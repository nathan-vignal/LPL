R:  Hi, my name is Andrew Couch.
L:  Hi, this is Tina Johnson.
R:  Hi, Tina, how --
L:  Hi --
R:  -- are you?
L:  Good, how are you? 
R:  I'm doing all right. [MN] 
L:  [NOISE] Um, --  
R:  Well  -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- okay, so, the topic is -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- computers how do they enrich our lives -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I would have to say, well, right now I'm sitting here in front of my laptop and, ah, it's become extremely helpful to me.  [NOISE] I'm a college student so, I have to use computers, ah, almost every night either to type a paper or to do research on the internet or, ah, a lot of my professors have gotten to the point where [MN] they like to communicate frequently to me by email and I -- I go to the University of Tennessee Knoxville and they -- the university has an online system where professors can post assignments and quizzes and you can look up your grades and they have discussion boards running so in a way computers have become pretty integral in my education and, ah, I -- I feel comfortable using computers.  I grew up using computers so, I have to say I -- I like them, I think they've enriched my life pretty good.
L:  Oh, I have, um, [NOISE] -- Do you hear an echo? 
R:  No, [NOISE] I'm fine.
L:  [MN] Okay, I have the same kind of experience, I'm a graduate student in Massachusetts, um, and not only do I use my computer, you know, for all of my assignments and to communicate with my professors, I also use it for research [MN] our library has, um, online data bases so I don't e- even have to go to the library most of the time now to get the articles that I need, um, for research and I use it for communication with my friends too [MN] back in Virginia so, um, more than just my education it's, a vehicle for communication.
R:  Yeah, I work with, um, I work at the Federal Court house here too while, ah, I'm not in classes and [LIPSMACK] sometimes I -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- look at old files and I can see where they've typed -- where they've had to use a typewriter and type things in and they -- they -- sometimes some of my bosses and other people that, um, I work with who are older than me tell me about how they used to have to use type with a computer -- um, typewriters all the time and how they like using computers so much.  In fact, there are computers in the court rooms today so a lot of times the people that go into the court rooms with the judges will be doing other tasks on their computers while the judge is listening to a case.  So, I guess in that way it allow them to be more efficient --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, how they work, so.
L:  Yeah, I couldn't imagine editing, um, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- some of my papers [LAUGH] by hand.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I couldn't imagine the time that it would take.  I -- I guess, um, it allows me time because I work too --  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, that, you know, I wouldn't have to sleep [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Right, um, --  
L:  -- you know how that is [LAUGH] 
R:  -- now, you said you were a graduate student, so, ah, h- -- may I ask how old you are? 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I know that's inna- that's not appropriate to ask, but --  
L:  I'm twenty nine.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, did you learn typing when you went to, ah, high school? 
L:  No, ah, --  
R:  Okay.
L:  -- when I was in high school they didn't have, ah, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- actually they started a computer program my senior year -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and I wasn't -- I was on a different track and it wasn't part of my curriculum so I taught myself.  Actually I taught myself [LAUGH] I got a job at an internet service provider, ah, working for them and I lied [LAUGH] --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- to get the job and said that I had com  --
R:  Oh, you told them you were computer proficient? 
L:  Yes.  So, I had to learn very quickly, um, on the job.  I tho- -- I know that's horrible, but --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you don't know me [LAUGH] 
R:  That's right, I'll probably --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- never run into you --
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  -- so, don't worry about it, don't being embarrassed --  
L:  [LAUGH] so, --
R:  -- I wo- -- ah, go ahead.
L:  No, but that's my story --  
R:  Okay, um, --  
L:  -- that's how I learned.
R:  -- I was, ah, well, I'm -- I'm twenty two I'm getting ready to graduate my senior year here at UT and, ah, I started learning how to use a computer when I was still in elementary school. 
L:  Wow.
R:  We played, ah, little computer games, really simple computer games like organ trail [NOISE] and others which [MN] I remember back then seemed so amazing but nowadays I see commercials for computer games and it's -- it's -- I don't see -- I can see how some people could sometimes get confused between which is the reality and which is the -- the -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, the real world, but, um, so I've -- I've been using computers since, ah, ah, since then but my -- my parents and, ah, they like to take -- they take pleasure I think in telling me, you know, when ye- -- I'm working on a -- when they hear m- -- you know, I tell em I'm working on a paper they say, you know, "Well, you're lucky cause when I was, you know, in school we'd have to -- it would take us twice as long" --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and, you know, how everything was just horrible and all that and they were so deprived I guess --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- or whatever --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but, ah, ...
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Is this the first time you've ever done one of these Fisher calls? 
L:  Yes [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay, me too.
L:  Yeah, well --  
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know, extra money for school --  
R:  Sure, you can't beat that.
L:  Mhm, no, but I have a little brother whose twelve [COUGH] --  
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and he started when he was like in preschool.
R:  In preschool?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  And I used to teach, ah, ah, an after school program --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and all the kids first to fifth grade all of them knew how to use a computer.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I would  -- I would have to say that for the most part I fall on -- on the side of -- of, you know, teaching kids how to use the computers and -- and, you know, I mean I certainly, you know, know more about computers like my mom is just -- she -- she knows more now than she did a couple of years ago, but a couple of years ago I mean, like, I had to show her how to turn it on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and things like that.  So, I have no problem with kids learning how to use computers.  I -- I would have to say though sometimes my concerns do fall on the side of people who say, "Well you know, kids don't, you know, they're not going to go outside because they've got --"  
L:  Oh.   
R:  -- TV and the computer" and all that kind of stuff --"  
L:  [MN] I don't by into that --
R:  Really?
L:  -- because I'm a psychology student --  
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and I haven't seen any data to support that argument --  
R:  Really? 
L:  -- I would have to see -- ah, what I have seen are, um, is research to the contrary that it is helping students.
R:  Really? 
L:  Yeah.  So, [MN] unless I see something that I guess because of my nature as a scientist, I -- I have to see proof [LAUGH] --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- before I believe it and I just don't believe that that's true.  I think that, um, that it may replace television time, ah, and I think that it's better than that television because it's more interactive.  I -- I don't think the television is bad either, I don't think PBS is bad for kids --  
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- or the Discovery Channel --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, um, especially what I've seen is that there is a lot of, um, programming for children with disabilities --  
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- that allows them access to the world that they didn't have before --  
R:  Right, I've heard about that --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, you're actually saying that instead of it taking more time away when the kids could be playing it's just in reality what is happening is that it's slowly kinda slowly supplementing or taking out that TV time -- 
L:  Well, --
R:  -- in some way?
L:  -- that's what I would say --  
R:  Okay.
L:  -- parents have to intervene and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- say, "You can only have, you know, ten hours a week in front of a screen". 
R:  Right.
L:  But, you know, that's something that parents are just gonna to have to deal with, plus --  
R:  That's true.
L:  -- the population and I think only one per cent, ah, of people own personal computers, so, it hasn't reached -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a proportion that, um, would even cause any kind of, you know, epidemic of people not leaving their homes.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  In my opinion [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, that's, ah, why  -- I guess that's why they -- they do this phone survey.  That's a valid point I had never really -- I had always I guess taken the, ah, argument for granted when people said, you know, this is just going to be more stuff in front of the TV but as you say I mean you -- you're saying that you've seen research that that indicates that it will probably merely just replace some of that time? 
L:  I would think so, yeah.
R:  So ... 
L:  I mean that's what I've seen, so unless I see something to the contrary --  
R:  Right.
L:  I mean kids are becoming a lot more overweight and that is a problem -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I don't think  -- I think that has to do with the fact that -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- parents aren't home and cooking for their children and kids are eating at school and in after school programs instant kind of food and stuff.
R:  Does your -- ah, does any of your, ah, sociological research deal with children? 
L:  Yeah, it -- 
R:  Oh, --
L:  -- um, my major right now is child development --
R:  Okay.   
L:  -- cognitive development --  
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so, um, ... 
R:  So, do you actually end up [NOISE] doing studies that involve -- I mean have you ever been involved in a study that involved children using computers? 
L:  Actually next semester I'm talking a class called, "Technologies of the self" and it's in the child development department --  
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and it, ah, looks at the role of technology and developing lives in the lives of children.
R:  Okay, now you said -- you said the title of the class was "Technology in the self", will that study specifically how technology has affected kinda more rural, poor, um, southern areas? 
L:  Um, I don't know, but --  
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I'm from the south, so my tendency I guess is to -- and -- and -- and I've not, you know, I would think we would look at the popula- different populations.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, but you're right, each research study is specific to a population --  
R:  -- -lation, okay.
L:  Yeah, so someone would have to undertake that.
