L:  Hello? 
R:  Hello, my name is Angela.
L:  Angela? 
R:  Yes.
L:  Hi, how are you --  
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- my name is Colin, how are you? 
R:  Oh, very nice to meet you.
L:  Very nice to meet you.  Are you from the South? 
R:  Yes, I'm in Tennessee.
L:  Oh, wow, I didn't realize that this was a, ah, all over thing.
R:  Oh, where are you located? 
L:  I'm in Philly.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Well, this is -- like my understanding this is run from the Penn. 
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  The -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the Penn University.
L:  Right, so I -- I thought maybe it was something like that [MN] --  
R:  No, it -- it's nationwide.
L:  Where in Tennessee are you? 
R:  I'm in north east Tennessee.
L:  North east -- 
R:  Um, -- 
L:  Like near Virginia? 
R:  Yeah, ah, --  
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  -- real close to Bristol Virginia.
L:  Sure.
R:  Bristol Tennessee, Bristol Virginia, real close to there.
L:  I've driven whatever that highway is that would, like, lead to Nashville --  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- eighty one, is it? 
R:  Yes, that's it.
L:  That's it.
R:  Yep.
L:  So, we've got this, ah, -- 
R:  Education and --  
L:  -- computers -- 
R:  Computer.  
L:  -- And education.
R:  Yeah, I think they're real important.
L:  Do you? 
R:  [LIPSMACK] I really do.
L:  Why? 
R:  Why?  Because, um, [LIPSMACK] most third graders know more about a computer than I know [LAUGH], so, I don't think it --  
L:  Right, but does that make them better educated?  
R:  I think so, because the -- computers are part of our life.
L:  Right.
R:  I couldn't live without my computer -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that's how I found out about this survey thing, you know. 
L:  That's a good point.
R:  And, ah, the internet is important, I learn a lot from the internet.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I think -- I think computers -- 
R:  But it needs to be supervised. 
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] I think com- computers are -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a, ah, good tool --  
R:  Yes.
L:  -- for education.  I mean I -- I've seen them work in great ways as far as first of all providing, um, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- access to, you know, as you mentioned to a wide variety of information --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that might not be available and I think as kids go -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- through school, I'm -- I'm a little -- I'm -- I'm a little suspicious or suspect -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- of what kids t- you know, learn in school.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, and so if a kid is motivated -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- I think it gives them a lot of opportunities or interested or is -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- exploring, um, to learn -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- kind of different perspective on things.
R:  Right.
L:  A- as well as just like kind of a wide var- ah information that, you know, that you just can't cover in school because there's limited time and --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- such.
R:  I think it's a good tool to let children learn at their own pace, like they may be able to go above and beyond with a computer where a teacher might have to stay behind and help a -- a student that may have trouble in a certain area, but if they're on a computer, like, in a, you know, supervised session they may be able to get more done [NOISE] at their own pace --  
L:  That's a good point.
R:  -- on a individual type basis.
L:  [MN] 
R:  Um, ... 
L:  I think that is probably true.
R:  Well, we had I [several inaudible words] I'm thirty --  
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and we started having computers in the school probably around the fifth or sixth grade and, you know, they have em in preschool --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know, we had the old Apples and stuff like that.
L:  Sure.
R:  [LAUGH] We didn't have exposure -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- to normal PCs until I was really in high school.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, ah, so -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and I've always been really interested in computers and my husband has also.  I mean he was on the computer and the -- what we know on the internet before most people even knew what it was --  
L:  Yeah, yeah. 
R:  -- his dad was the director of computers at our local university, so that had a lot to do with it.
L:  Okay.  Well, I mean [MN] -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that's absolutely true.  I, ah, got a couple -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- of years on you -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- And you know, the difference in computer training --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, in a couple years makes a difference, um, --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- and so like, you know, I mean I -- you know, I saw computers in [MN] high school --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as, you know, word processing tools --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- generally and it wasn't really until -- I -- I don't know I mean it wasn't until I was in my mid twenties that I really used a computer for --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [MN] any kind of you know, access -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- ah, anything but, you know, kind of word processing.
R:  Right.
L:  I'm a little -- I was a little behind the times but, um, -- well, all right, [MN] I guess here -- here's the thing, you know, part of this -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- discussion [MN] I mean -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I -- I don't know who can go out and say that computers -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- are not a good thing, or not --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, a good tool.  So, what do you think that, like, -- [LAUGH] w- w- why do you think they ask this question as far a- there must be, like, -- like, what are the possible draw backs of computers I guess? 
R:  [NOISE] Mm, --  
L:  It's f- -- you know, is related --
R:  Well, they don't -- 
L:  -- to education.
R:  -- they don't have as much -- they don't have as much, um, [LIPSMACK] group interaction they more -- they'll isolate, ah, in the school they will isolate children more because they will be more just by themselves on the computer instead of, like, in a group.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
R:  Um, like, you know, they might learn math on the computer where I learned it in a group, you know, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we all got together and figured -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- how to do this problem and -- 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- and now they sit down in front of the computer and the computer helps you to figure out the problem.
L:  Yeah, see, there's -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- certain aspects -- I don't know if you have children, I -- I don't -- 
R:  I -- I have one.
L:  You do --?
R:  Ye- --  
L:  -- so, like, see, I don't like --
R:  He's only six weeks old though so, -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I haven't experienced school -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- with him yet --
L:  [MN] [LAUGH]  
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah, all right -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- well, I gotcha --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- um, but you know what I'm saying, like I haven't seen, like, that aspect of the, ah, -- of the thing where it's actually interactive type stuff -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- On the computer, you know -- 
R:  Mm.  
L:  -- I -- I mainly know it as, like, well, you know, you can learn about, you know, birds and the [inaudible] island -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- by going to this website or that website, and that's great -- 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- but you know, the interactive stuff is -- is interesting too.  [MN] I think one reason why I tend -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- not to think -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- ther- it's going to be too big a problem is that -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- I mean, all right, the problem with a computer is that a lot of types, you know -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- there's no authority.  I mean there is information on the --  
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- on the web or something that someone is getting --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, you know, how do we -- how do we know, how can we judge that against truth?  I mean cause -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- anyone can put anything on the web --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean so [MN] that's great in the sense of it disseminate information but, you know, it -- it could also disseminate lies, you know, [MN] --  
R:  Mhm.  I think as far as school goes -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they really need to monitor what they have access if there's granny access to the internet, um, you know, to only certain websites so they can't get such false information -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- or, you know, learn that three plus -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- three plus three is really six instead of three plus three is ninety six or something -- 
L:  Right. 
R:  -- you know, cause I mean you can teach that.
L:  Yeah, I mean I guess -- I guess [MN] the thing is, like, is that, you know, but in school -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- there -- there's seems to be so little authority now anyway.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, ah, er, you know, like at least not authority I see in a good way.  I mean I think students -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- need, you know, someone that is going to say, "No --" 
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- that is wrong" -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, or, "That is right" you know, where -- something because th- th- they're growing th--
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, it's not -- these are not always, like, just opinions -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, we -- we all have different opinions --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- But there's -- and, so --
R:  There's fact and truth and then there's -- there's not fact and truth [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, so, --  
R:  There's opinion -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- [MN] and lies. [LAUGH]  
L:  Exactly, so, yeah, I don't know I think, um, I think you nailed it there.  I think th- this is -- I mean everything that comes along I -- I -- I generally see as -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- you know, it's there to serve a human need --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and [MN] that's why it was developed, I mean -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, someone saw a need for this and it was developed and from there, you know, it can be abused --  
R:  Exac- -- 
L:  -- but, you know, th- that's not to mean there aren't a lot of really good use -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- for it as well.
R:  That's very true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, do you have, um, friends or family that have children in school? 
L:  Um, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- well, yeah, I [MN] I got -- 
R:  I mean [MN] -- 
L:  -- yeah, I definitely have friends that, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have children in school.
R:  Ahah.
L:  Um, --  
R:  Because I was just thinking about you know, when I'm basing my opinion on is, um, my sister's children and my husband's sister's children, um, you know, and some friends but not -- just from what they've told me, I don't have -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- first hand experience, um, as far as that goes and -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and --  
L:  Well, you know [MN] -- 
R:  -- me personally -- I was going to say just me personally as far as school goes and in college, ah, the computer has been a very helpful tool for me, um, ... 
L:  You know -- you know what the thing is, I -- I just -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- this is the one thing I resent -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- c- computers are great, computers are going to be useful and, you know, the more the merrier, however -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- kid can learn without computers --  
R:  True.
L:  -- and so, it's not like, you know, we can't judge whether, "Oh, you know, If he doesn't have a computer in his classroom that means he is going to be a loser, you know, and never amount to anything" b- --
R:  Because you can become too dependant upon -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- them --  
L:  Ye- -- 
R:  -- you know, they need to learn how to add and subtract without a calculator.
L:  Right and you know what --? 
R:  [MN]  
L:  -- I mean, you know, the main thing is if you go to school you listen, you know, even if you are doing it in long hand on your paper you're gonna learn --  
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but, you know, it doesn't how many computers you have if you go to school -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] you don't have any positive reinforcement at home --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, th- I think those factors are equal if not more important -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to -- to really educating children, ah, and -- and adults for that matter, but ... 
R:  I think it's a very interesting topic [NOISE] um, because of -- you know, a lot of people have strong opinions about it and I'm kind of, you know, either way.  I think they're important to have but they can be abused.
L:  I think I'm in agreement with you, and I -- 
R:  And, so, you know, good and bad --  
L:  Yeah, I mean, it's funny --
R:  I -- I think they're good --
L:  -- because I have a lot of strong opinions on a lot of things [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- this is one that I'm just kinda mellow on. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  You know? 
R:  [MN] But I guess a lot of it has to do with I don't have a child that's in school using one every day, um, and I'm sure that when my -- my child is in school and using one every day it will become more of -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- issue because I think that eventually we won't even have -- some textbooks they'll -- they'll just go to class and do their homework on computers and bring it home on a disk or -- 
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- whatever form of media is at that time and --  
L:  Well, I -- I --
