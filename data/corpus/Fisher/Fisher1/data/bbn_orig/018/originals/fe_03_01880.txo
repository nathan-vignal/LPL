L:  Hi, I'm Theresa.
R:  I'm Kimberley.
L:  Have you done this before?
R:  No, I haven't, have you? 
L:  No, [LAUGH] I feel like an idiot.
R:  I just signed up. 
L:  [NOISE] Me too, yesterday in fact.
R:  Well, I did too actually yesterday, isn't that funny.
L:  Well, I am a stay at home mom and I have, um, three kids, three little girls, actually one of them is big now and has a -- a daughter of her own --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- who lives with my husband and I so my family is pretty much my life. [NOISE]
R:  Ah.  Well, I have one son and I am a part time worker and mostly full time stay at home mom.
L:  Ahah. 
R:  I work two and a half days a week and my son is three and a half and, ah, I'm married and that's my little family.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That and two neurotic animals.
L:  Oh yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  We have two cats and a dog and I guess they would be part of our family.
R:  Well, sure, sure.  They seem like family when they've been with you so long.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then of course we have got grannies and grandmas and --  
L:  Ahah. 
R:  -- all of that so ... 
L:  We -- we moved away from most of our, um, immediate family so ... 
R:  Really.
L:  We kind of got a little bit of breathing room. [LAUGH]
R:  Was -- was it hard though too? 
L:  No, we were ready.
R:  Really.
L:  It was time to go and it was a really small town so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was exciting to get to go see something new.
R:  And I can't wait to get back to my small town. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Isn't that funny.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well ... 
L:  So, what does your son do while he is home with you? 
R:  He, ah -- actually we do, ah, we are looking into home schooling.
L:  Really.
R:  And so we do lots of activities together, we work on our numbers and -- and, ah, he's very computer literate already which is scary.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  But, ah, he's -- he's just a real sweet kid.  In fact it's odd that the topic should be family because we just found out he has a potentially life threatening condition, we found out yesterday.
L:  Oh, I'm sorry.
R:  Oh it's -- it's okay, it's doubtful that it will ever threaten his life but, ah, he -- he might end up having to have a liver transplant.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  And so, ah, it does kind of make you think about family, doesn't it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And how much yours means to you.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  And, ah, it's funny how you -- you don't know what you are missing before you have 'em and when you do have 'em, you just don't know what you'd do without 'em.
L:  Right, it's hard to remember a time without kids.
R:  Yeah, it is, it is.  And that happens so quickly.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  What do you do with your children, do you home school or ... 
L:  No, I'm not brave enough or patient enough to do that. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I enjoy my kids going to school. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They, ah, -- well, my oldest one is seventeen so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she'll be out shortly.
R:  My.
L:  And moving on to college so that will be quite an experience for us. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And actually she's really not home a lot any more since she, you know, got her licence -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and is a Mom and is busy and my other ones are eight and, ah, -- I'm sorry, we've just had a birthday, nine and five so they fight a lot. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, I spend a lot of time refereeing and now we have started, ah, T ball and softball.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they'll do soccer and ... 
R:  We started T ball.  We had our first practice Tuesday.
L:  Yeah, how did it go? 
R:  Went great.
L:  Good.
R:  My little fellow just loved it.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So -- because even though he's sick he doesn't feel or act sick and so that's good.  He -- he enjoys things and just has a good time.
L:  How did you, um, finally come to find out he was sick if he doesn't act like it? 
R:  He kept having elevated liver functions on his blood tests and, um, the doctor kind of blew me off and I pressed and pressed and pressed un- until finally we found a doctor that said yeah, we need to find out what's going on.
L:  Good.
R:  And, ah, we took him to Vanderbilt in Nashville Tennessee.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they finally found it after thirty one hundred dollars worth of tests.
L:  Oh my.
R:  They finally found it so now we know what we're up against so that's good.
L:  And is there medication available? 
R:  No, there's no treatment.
L:  No.
R:  No, it's -- it's just hereditary. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  But -- but we're okay, we're okay and I found that the more -- um, I don't know how you feel about it, but the more problems that come into my family the more I turn to God and -- 
L:  Absolutely.
R:  And that's also a very vital part of our family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The good Lord.
L:  We have a wonderful church family.
R:  Ahah. 
L:  And we were just amazed, I told you we had moved away from our family and they really probably support us more than our biological family just because a lot of them aren't Christians.
R:  Isn't that funny -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- how that begins to happen.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, the family is in danger these days, so I think.
L:  Yes. 
R:  You know, there's so many things that kids are having to deal with -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with regard to families, you know, all these new and -- and unusual ideas.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  And ideas that don't go along with -- with the way I was raised.
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I don't know, it's scary --
L:  And it seems like --
R:  -- you wonder if someone's gonna make it.
L:  Yeah, it seems like if you speak out against it, ah, like maybe your opinion and my opinion aren't valid but theirs is.
R:  Right.
L:  You know what I'm saying? 
R:  Right, oh, I understand.
L:  It's kind of weird.  We didn't have to deal with that when we were younger.
R:  Yeah, it was nice, you know, and family was a very well defined role.
L:  Mhm.
R:  When we were kids and that was good.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think those definitions and those boundaries are good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But -- but we also -- you know, we have people at church and we consider them family and -- and friends that have known us forever and know all the dirty secrets and -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and where all the skeletons are hidden in all their family too.
L:  And they love us anyway. [LAUGH]
R:  Isn't that the truth, isn't that the truth.  I think -- I think that's the most important thing that you can teach your children as far as a family goes is that a family loves each other no matter what.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.
L:  Yes.
R:  That's what I'm trying to teach my munchkin.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I hear yours. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mine is actually headed to granny's because I have the -- the beginnings of a migraine.
L:  Oh, I'm sorry, I get those too.
R:  Ah, yeah. I -- I --
L:  It's really hard to deal with when your kids are needing attention.
R:  Yeah.  Luckily granny is -- is almost always available. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, ah, especially when I'm sick or not feeling well.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I see -- you know, when you get on the phone there's this hormone in kid's bodies that says you've got to get momma off the phone.
L:  [LAUGH] You're right. [LAUGH] 
R:  Or you have to make as much noise as humanly possible.
L:  Yep, I think husbands have that too. [LAUGH]  
R:  You know, I think so.  It's -- it's a genetic thing too.
L:  [LAUGH].  My husband is gone a lot.  He works on the railroad --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I -- we go round and round because he's gone so much and then the kids will start acting really bad after he's gone for several days.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  That's, that's bound to be hard.
L:  Yeah, it's like there's a kind of a power struggle every time he comes home because, you know, I have to handle everything while he's gone and -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and when he walks in he thinks it ought to be the way he wants it. [LAUGH]  
R:  Right, right.
L:  But we're -- we're learning to live with it and he likes his job so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that counts for a lot. 
R:  My husband is kind of the same way.  He's second shift --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and so I'm here the majority --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and, you know, he's on fourteen, off three and so we have the exact same problem.  When daddy's home, you know, I try to defer to him because it's the thing to do but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but it's -- and it's -- it -- it's really odd this is the subject because it is all about redefining family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and I'm not sure I like it.  I don't like the new definitions --
L:  No.
R:  -- I like the old ones.
L:  Yeah, like the June and Ward Clever. [LAUGH]   
R:  Ah.
L:  Not very realistic but, you know.
R:  Not very realistic but definitely good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, something to shoot for anyway.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's all I've ever asked my husband for is a normal life. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  So the railroad's not kind of fitting into my scheme of things but that's okay.
R:  It's a good living at least so ... 
L:  Yeah, it's not bad.
R:  I guess we should be glad for that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You -- do you have -- your family is all very far from you.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah.
R:  That -- that -- while it may be good it -- it can also be bad.  You can't just ship 'em off to granny's when you are having a migraine.
L:  Right, it's hard to get a break.  
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And the kids don't know grandparents like I did and ... 
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] Grandparents can teach a kid so much that, you know, maybe mum isn't patient enough or even have the time to do it. [NOISE]
R:  And it's -- it's a -- it's really important to know where you came from too, I think.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But my Mom lives a couple of hours away [NOISE] so Jacob doesn't see her very much.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, ah, we're lucky to have granny here and granddaddy and they live on a farm.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I --
