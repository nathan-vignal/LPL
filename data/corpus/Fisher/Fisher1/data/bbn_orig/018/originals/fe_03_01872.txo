L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  [LAUGH]  Hi.  My name --
R:  Hi. 
L:  -- is Samantha.
R:  Hi, Samantha, I'm Lou-Anne. 
L:  Hi, Lou-Anne.  Have you done this before? 
R:  I have not.  Have you? 
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  No, how did you find out about it?
L:  Um, a friend of mine emailed me and was like, "Hey, I know you're broke, try this out". 
R:  Okay.  I do mystery shops and so I heard about it on mystery shopping.
L:  Oh, okay.  What's mystery shopping?
R:  Ah, mystery shopping is where you get paid certain amounts of money to, um, participate, you either go to a Fedex store and you have to mail a package and then you have to fill out a report.  You go shop at, let's say, Caribou Coffee and then you have to fill out a report.  
L:  [MN] 
R:  If they were any good, that kind of stuff. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, wow.  How do you --
R:  So --
L:  How do you find out how to do that?
R:  [SIGH]  Go on the internet and go to mystery shopping dotcom or mystery shopping.  Um, I've been doing it since January.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And there's a zillion sites that are there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and so this came up under mystery shopping as one of the sites.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, um, --
L:  Huh.
R:  So we're supposed to talk about family.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  And what family means to each other.
R:  Okay.  Well, you want to start?
L:  Um, [MN] well, maybe, um, I -- maybe I'll -- I could ask you questions like -- like sort of more specific questions and then -- and then -- you know, because it's kind of a hard thing, I think, to approach like immediately as a big subject, you know, like, what does family mean to you, you know?
R:  Okay.
L:  So maybe, like, we could start talking about, like, what kind of families -- you know, like what kind of families we come from or what our idea of family is and, um, -- I ju- -- [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Well, do you want to tell me about your family?
L:  Um, I -- would -- I don't -- will you start?  I just kind of woke up and I'm just sort of, like, getting my day started.  Um, so will you start first?
R:  Okay.  I live in Atlanta.
L:  Ahah.
R:  I have two kids.  I am a stay at home mum and I work part time because family's important to me.  To me -- for me to be around my kids, they're -- um, one's a teenager and one's eleven.
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is more important now than when they were little and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my family is extremely important to me.
L:  Mhm.  What about the family that, like, you came up in, like, were you in -- part of a large family or a small family or ...
R:  I was, um, one of four.  The oldest of four.
L:  Mm. 
R:  And I come from a big Italian family.
L:  Oh, okay.  [MN] Cool.  Ah, well, I guess -- all right.  I come -- I'm the youngest.  Um, I come from a family of four, um, but just, you know, two kids, um, and I don't have any, you know, I haven't had any children and, um, so, yeah -- family -- I definitely think family's important.  I think family also can -- can sometimes, um, you know, it's, like, w- we don't -- you don't get to chose your family, um, but your choice is, like, how to, how to -- you know, a lot of the time I think the challenge is, like, how to be yourself the same time as, like, respect your family and figure out how to work out, um, any sort of differences you might have or, um, that sort of thing.  And, you know, 'cause it's, like, we all go through different stages of life and we all have different points when family -- family, like, as part- -- you know, takes care of -- of different -- different needs, you know? Um, --
R:  [NOISE] Do you still live by your family?
L:  Um, I live in Philadelphia, um, and my -- my immediate family, like my mum and my dad, live in Worcester[?] Massachusetts, um, [MN] and they're still together.  My brother lives in New York, um, and my more extended family tends to live in the New York area, um, some in the city, some in upstate New York, and then other people in Massachusetts.  So, um, it's definitely a part of -- of staying in the same general region.  I mean, I'm -- you know, Philadelphia is like a good five and a half hours from Worcester but it's certainly -- you know, I'm not in France or Hong Kong or -- or the west coast, you know, and I think that's definitely a part of it, for sure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ... 
R:  And I -- see, I hav- -- also have a dif- -- different definition of family that I -- my family lives in Chicago.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I have an extended family here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I lost a brother and a father two years ago.
L:  Mm. 
R:  And without my extended family I would not have made it through because I was able to leave my kids with my friends.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I was able to count on my friends.  They might as well have just been my family.
L:  Mhm, yeah. 
R:  [LAUGH]  Because I would not have been able to do it without them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And my -- my, ah, blood family was taking care of, um, their family so my family down here was able to help --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- take care of me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so ... [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, yeah, it's -- it's so true that, like, you know, your family, like, can go beyond your biological family, you know -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and be, like, your community in lots of ways.  Um, how did you lose your -- your father?
R:  I lost both my brother and my father to cancer.
L:  Mm.
R:  They both had really terrible cancer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Bad, bad -- um, bad situation but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, as far as we were -- we were a very close family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, a lot of families aren't close.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I went to take care of my brother in Texas while my mother took care of my father.
L:  Wow.
R:  So --
L:  In Chicago?
R:  Yeah, my dad was in Chicago and my brother was in Texas.  My brother had a three year old at the time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He was young, he was thirty eight.
L:  Wow.
R:  He had head and neck cancer which is a --  a terrible cancer.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, um, -- so we were close before but, um, it made us even closer because as adults you tend to, you know, go your own ways, you have your own thoughts on things and -- and when you don't see each other all the time, um, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I found out a lot of things about my brother that I didn't know.
L:  Mm.  Like what?
R:  Um, um, like what?  Um, [MN] let's see, how do I -- how do I word it?  Um, he -- he was always really rough and tumble and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, very aggressive and yet I saw this really, really sweet side of him I had not seen before.
L:  Mm, mhm.
R:  So, um, -- and I got to spend more time with him before he died than I probably did the last ten years.
L:  Wow.
R:  Because I lived in LA before I moved to Atlanta.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- and I had my kids, too. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think my kids have a different opinion of family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Than I do.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Because I grew up with all my relatives everywhere.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We had Italian gatherings every single holiday, every other Sunday, and my kids don't have any immediate -- I -- I take it back, I have an aunt who just moved here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But -- [NOISE]
L:  It's not the same, yeah.
R:  -- she works full time -- yeah, it's not the same as growing up with.  I mean, I had twenty cousins and my kids don't even know who they are.
L:  Wow.
R:  [NOISE] se they live all over.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, I had some of my cousins come for Thanksgiving this year, this past year, and my kids are like, "Who are they?"
L:  Wow.
R:  You know, my kids are eleven and fourteen --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and yet they are just meeting them for the first time.
L:  Wow. 
R:  So it's kind of interesting.
L:  Mhm.  Does that -- do you regret that at all, that you can't, um, -- do you sort of wish that they did have the family that you had?
R:  Um, no, I think it's just different.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I wish we were closer because as everybody gets older, you know, you need to start taking care of your parents or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we're going to have to take care of each other and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I think it's -- it's hard -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, when you have aging parents.
L:  Yeah, yeah, for sure.  My brother and I actually just sort of talked about that.  Um, he was -- he was living in -- he's an actor and he was in -- this is kind of fun talking to people that, you know, that you don't know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- about things that you don't normally talk to people about. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly, because who is going to tell anybody?  You're not going to anybody, right?
L:  I know.  It's, like, what are you -- you know, what are you go- -- yeah, exactly.  Who are you going to tell?
R:  Tell, right.
L:  Um, but it's -- you know, if I ask some questions that you don't want to answer, obviously, you know, I would understand, um, and vice versa.  You know, if you feel like asking -- I'm generally, like, a pretty open person.
R:  [MN] 
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But feel free to sort of, if there's something, whatever.  I'm also a writer so I love to tell stories, so, um, [MN] -- 
R:  Oh, good.
L:  Yeah.  So my brother, um, was living in Little Rock, um, for a little while and I was travelling around this past summer and, um, you know, even though he's in New York and I'm in Philly right now, um, we don't ge- -- you know, we don't spend that much concentrated time together and when we're home, we'll often go home for Christmas, um, and for Thanksgiving.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But, you know, there's a hundred other people around so we don't spend much concentrated time, but, um, I spent about five days with him in -- in Little Rock, um, and we for the first time really talked about, like, wh- -- you know, what are -- what are we planning, you know, when -- when our parents, um, start needing us to be around more, um.
R:  [NOISE]  And how old are you guys?
L:  I'm twenty seven and he's -- he's almost twenty nine, um. 
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  But my dad is about to turn sixty, um, in a week and my mum is, like, sixty two.  Um, so it's -- they're -- they're not requiring it yet but we are sort of at the age where we need to start thinking about it, um, and my mum's had -- has had, um, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- she hasn't had any cancer that's spread but she's had, like, pre-cancerous cells in -- in, um, her cervix and she had, like, a lump of -- taken out of her breast, like, you know --
