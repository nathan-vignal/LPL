R:  Hey, good afternoon.  My name is Hank.
L:  Hi.  I'm Patricia.
R:  Hi, Patricia.  What do you think of, uh, u- using computers and education?
L:  [LAUGH] To tell you the truth, I don't know if I have a big opinion about it, um, I suppose it can be good.  I'm not, you know, as long it's not dependent on too much to replace people.
R:  Do you have school age children?
L:  No, I don't.  Do you?
R:  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  But I have grandchildren that use them and, uh, it's just amazing the things that they can -- well, it, you know, can replace a library.   
L:  Yeah, that's a good point.  I mean, when -- back in the old days if we had to go to the -- the library to do research --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- papers and things, now you can do it on the Internet. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, and I lived in a small town.  The library was about as big as a closet, so there wasn't, you know, a lot of choice.  The school had a library and it was very incomplete.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, I -- I don't know.  The thing is I think it's instantaneous, you know. [NOISE] If, uh, -- I know that I've helped my grandson with some projects and he needed -- needed information about Iraq.
L:  About what?
R:  About Iraq, the country.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry, I didn't -- 
R:  And we got the information in twenty seconds, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Mm.
R:  That's, uh, -- you can't quite get in your car and drive to the library and then, you know, go through the reference section.  It's really amazing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm sort of against the use of them for games.
L:  Well, then, that's what I was, um, thinking of.  I think that sometimes they develop educational games, which I think can be good to a point but sometimes it think it might be, um, used too much or, you know, relied on too much.
R:  Yeah, can -- they can be a waste of time, I think.  Uh, maybe, you know, it depends on the game, but some of them are, you know, three quarters entertainment and twenty five per cent education.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I agree.  I think would be much better if they were tilted more towards education and not, um, -- I know that my granddaughter and grandson, they limit TV ti- -- I mean community computer time, uh, for non educational purposes, you know, unless he's doing research or things like that --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he can only use a computer one hour a day.
L:  That's -- that's a good idea, I would think, you know, to have some type of limit.
R:  Oh, you know, they got to get the kids outside.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I just, uh, -- they're a wonderful tool and they are a good instrument but they are not an end in themselves.
L:  Yeah.  Um, that's what -- I -- I'm just thinking to myself -- I'm a computer programmer, um, --  
R:  Oh, wow! [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] and -- but I've not, you know, developed, you know, educational software or anything, but, um, so, you know, I would hate to see them [LAUGH] go kapooie[?] but, [LAUGH] yeah, it's -- I think we kind of -- sound like we have similar ideas on it as far as that they can be beneficial but, um, -- 
R:  I just, you know, I resisted getting a computer -- 
L:  I agree that the computer --
R:  -- very much because I just couldn't see the need for one and, uh, then I was convinced to get a computer and I've had it for like ten years, or not yet, but I've had a computer for ten years and I -- I -- I do, you know, my banking on them, uh, r- reading, research, I read newspapers from overseas, I -- I can speak four or five languages so I kind of -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- keep up with those that way and, um, my one granddaughter is studying German and she has, uh, a computer aided, um, uh, software for German and it's helped her.  She's gotten -- she was getting kind of bad grades, she was getting C minuses and Cs and I bought her that for her birthday and she's been getting As since then.
L:  Oh, right.  And I do think in languages it probably would be a lot more helpful than some other things, just [MN] because you can hear how things should be pro- --  you know, it's -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- pronounced.
R:  You can hear the pronunciation and you ca- -- she can slow it down and there is a program, or it isn't a program, but there's a method in there where she can compare her speech to the computer or the professor, whatever you want to call them, speech pattern -- 
L:   Oh.
R:  -- to make sure that the words are. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- exact, uh, --  
L:  That would be good.  [NOISE]
R:  Not just depending on your voice, I mean on your ears.
L:  Ahah.
R:  Because, you know, German has some sounds that we don't have -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you can usually spot an American by his inability or her inability [LAUGH] to make that -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- make that, uh, sound.
L:  That's interesting because I haven't had much language, you know, oth- other than English training.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I've learned little bits of different things but I was always kind of paranoid [inaudible] like you said.  In my head they sounded one way and I couldn't tell if -- if it was, you know, the way it came out or not -- 
R:  Right, if you were -- 
L:  -- you know, if it sounded right.
R:  -- pronouncing it the proper way.
L:  But that would be kind of cool to have software that could help you. 
R:  Oh, yeah, it shows, uh, you know, uh, I guess a sonic pattern in waves -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and for emphasis and also, you know, the sound quality and the sound itself, the tone of -- not the tone, but the -- the shape of the sound, so to speak.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So with practice you can -- you can --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- just, uh, you know, make it exact so you can duplicate these hard sounds that are unfamiliar to the American ear.
L:  Mm.  I'm going have to tell -- make sure my sister knows about this.  She is home schooling and I heard her talking the other day to her son about, uh, starting to teach him, you know, another language and I know her husband knows Spanish pretty well --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- um, and I -- they've taught him that kind of growing up some, but, um, you know, I will have to make sure she checks into software.  She probably is already planning to for that.
R:  Yeah.  There -- there are -- you can -- on the internet you can get you, uh, comparative values of the different ones ... 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, some I've -- I'm fairly familiar with them because I use them for myself -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and some of them are just worthless, I mean really worthless, uh, -- 
L:  [LAUGH] That would be bad if you get the wrong kind [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, you know, but --
L:  -- and learned it the wrong way.
R:  Uh, Berlitz[?] is famous and I think that's one of the worst quality, uh, language on the internet -- I mean on -- with a computer.
L:  Ahah.
R:  It's just archaic and old.  Um, th- they're all, you know, she'd have to do -- just do a little homework and, uh, they are not expensive.  I think that I paid fifty or seventy dollars for the one for my granddaughter and it goes, uh, -- grandson, and it goes, um, you know, through what would be two college years.
L:  Oh.  Well, that's definitely worth it if it's helped her improve her grades that well.
R:  Oh, yeah.  She's got -- she wants to go to a good college and she knows that she's got to get better than average grades -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, get near straight As and so she got that C in, uh, German and it really threw her, so we got this help and she's pulled it out.  And, you know, geography, I think -- uh, I don't know how old you are, but I think that the younger generation has a great void in terms of geography outside of the United States, you know that I saw a study done a year ago where they couldn't name the fifty United States.
L:  Oh, yeah, I've seen some of those things in the paper and it's amazing.
R:  Thirteen per cent of the people knew where Iraq was.  The students, only thirteen knew where Iraq was.  Uh, they gave them the European countries, I mean Europe without identification, just the outline of the country and very few could fill it in, you know, they just -- they knew England and they knew France and Italy, you know, that was about it, so [MN] I -- I've very -- if you had asked me ten years ago I would have said a computer would, you know, kind of a waste of time but, boy, now, having had some experience with it as you have, I think they are wonderful learning tool.
L:  As I say, the more I learn -- and I actually even though as a programmer, you know, I've been a main frame programmer -- 
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and I kind of -- some of the stuff I thought you don't need some of the -- you know, it's like what you said about, you know, you don't want to keep yourself or the kids from getting outside and doing things, too, and -- 
R:  Yes, you don't want to replace physical education.
L:  -- but the more I use it for different types, you know, different types of things, you know, I'm able to learn from it and, you know, whether, you know, it is not necessarily for, you know, in a school atmosphere, but, um, like you're saying, for research and things like that.
R:  Yeah.  It doesn't have to be formal education.  It can just be, you know, if you have an interest or a hobby or -- or vocation -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you can use it for educational purposes outside of the structure of a classroom and I do, but of course my dear grandchildren use it as an adjunct to do their homework and, uh, it's helped them, so I'm all for it, [LAUGH] as long as you can --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not let them waste time.
L:  But as l- -- as long as they still have to learn how to multiply and things. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Because some, uh, --
R:  Well, you know, I don't --
