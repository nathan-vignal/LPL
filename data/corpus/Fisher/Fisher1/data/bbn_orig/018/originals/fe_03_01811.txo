R:  Hi, I'm Tony.
L:  I'm Cindy.
R:  Hi.
L:  How are you? [MN] 
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, that's a tough question. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um, I don't know.
L:  'Cause yes and no. [MN]
R:  Yeah.  I mean sometimes it can help because, like, I know with kids and they have a lot of questions -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, it's easier to just go look it up than to actually look in a book.
L:  As -- as research goes, yeah, but I also see my nieces and nephews kind of say that's what they're going to go do -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] and go elsewhere on the computer.
R:  Right, but then again it's, like, it's good if, like, the library is closed.
L:  Yeah.  I think it's more helpful, though, I really do.
R:  Yeah.  I mean -- 
L:  It's easier.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  And I think it's, uh, quicker --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- most definitely.
R:  I think that, um, it makes it easier also for, like, reports and stuff -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like it looks neater when they do the projects.
L:  Well, you can print it out and keep an eye on it.
R:  Right, but then again, like, that also, like, takes away from being creative -- 
L:  You're right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- because then you're not, like, coloring and drawing.
L:  They're going to copy pictures and stuff right off the computer.
R:  Right.
L:  Right.
R:  So, and then again it does make kids lazier.
L:  Mhm.  In a way, yeah, that's what I was just going to say.  In a way going to the library is going to make them do a little more research, too, I [LAUGH] think.
R:  Yeah, but not really.  I mean, you go to the library and it takes you, like, forever just to find a book.
L:  That's true.  Yeah.
R:  But then that also takes away from kids knowing actually how to use the library.
L:  Mhm.  I think it's good in the schools, though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think they are monitored -tored enough that the teachers know they're doing their work and I think it's helpful in education.
R:  Yeah, but I mean not all the schools have, like, that many, like, each classroom might just have one.
L:  Mhm, yeah, yeah.  My niece is a teacher and there's one in her classroom.
R:  And all the kids kind of have to, like, crowd around -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and fight.
L:  Yeah.  That's exactly it.  It's not like, [inaudible] little kids [inaudible] sixth grade.
R:  Right.
L:  In high school I'm sure they have more of the computers in there.
R:  Yeah, but I guess they could take turns, like, if they say, "Okay", you know, "Ten minutes each kid" or something like that. 
L:  Mhm.  I think that's what she does, or if she is showing them one specific thing -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's true, they crowd around. [MN]
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean she has a small class, but ... 
R:  But then they could also use it as a reward -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like they could do games and things like that.
L:  If someone did something good, yeah, definitely.
R:  But educational games. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's another drawback -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because kids want to play, like, the action games and like, -- 
L:  Yeah, that's what my nephew kind of did, would steer away from the homework.
R:  It's interesting.
L:  [inaudible] and that is a good question.  I never really thought about it as being really negative as a teaching thing.  I mean, if the kids are being watched and [SIGH] that's what they're doing while they're at school or if the parents are watching at home, it's not a problem.
R:  Right, but then I guess it could also take away because then they, like you said, go visit sites that, like, they're not supposed to be visiting -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and doing stuff.
L:  Or chatting with friends. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly. [LAUGH] Exactly.  
L:  [MN]
R:  I get -- every once in a while I get an instant message from, uh, my little cousin [inaudible] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- "Can you tell me" and I'm, like, "Look, go look it up yourself".
L:  My niece does that all the time. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It drives me crazy, actually. [LAUGH]
R:  It's, like, for her to type it to send it to me, she could type it into a search.
L:  [LAUGH] That's right, she could have searched for it by then.
R:  It's crazy.
L:  I think kids like it, though.  I think -- I think, really, they -- I mean they go on to play but they realize there's so much they can look up also.  Some --
R:  Right, like they never -- they never have, like, an "I don't know" to their question -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- because there's always an answer.
L:  Even if it's something with -- I know I had a foster kid and she was amazed that she could go on and look at Disney stuff -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and some of it was educational, the Disney site.  
R:  Right.
L:  I didn't mind her playing around on there.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] "Hey, you can play games", but I -- yeah, I think it just depends on the child and helps schools.
R:  Yeah.  I guess it also depends on, like, how they're brought up, like, if they're told, "Yeah, you can learn" --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or if they're told, "Oh, just go play".
L:  It's not just for games.
R:  Right.  
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  It's interesting.
L:  Adults too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's a different story. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Because when I was in college I -- I think computers -- well, I'm not -- I'm not really old, but I mean it was just kind of like, -- 
R:  Just starting.
L:  -- you could take the classes, yeah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I didn't, [MN] so I just kind of had to learn on my own for my job. [MN]
R:  Right, yeah.  When I was in school the computers were just starting to come out -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you can do it if you wanted to, but you didn't have to.
L:  Yeah, they didn't push you.
R:  Right, but I think that also, like, it kind of takes away.  I think now it's like, you learn to type -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- before you even learn how to write.
L:  That -- that's true.  I -- I have to admit I just -- I watch them, even my nephew [inaudible] two little fingers, he can really whip through that keyboard. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] I mean --
R:  And I'm just, like, "Wow", like, how do they know how to type so well? 
L:  Mhm.  So actually I have to go with the [inaudible] benefit -- 
R:  Yeah, that's often [inaudible] 
L:  -- because I remember I have to take typing in school and probably now there's [inaudible] typing classes in school, I don't know.
R:  Yeah, probably not.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, they probably just have a computer class --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that teaches them how to type.
L:  Exactly, because there are programs where you can follow along with the guide and -- 
R:  Right.  Press A, press B -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and just kind of type along. 
L:  That is a good point.  It probably eliminates some other classes. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I remember that, too, all my friends were taking it and I was kind of like, you know, whatever. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What class? [LAUGH] [MN] I'll skip that class.
R:  [LAUGH] It's an easy class, though. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] But it's kind of s- -- I think it's easier to learn -- I mean we can take classes through my job, too.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I'm amazed -- I've gone to a few classes and I know the basics but there's people that's actually walked out because they didn't even know how to use the mouse or anything -- 
R:  Wow! 
L:  -- and I was, like, "Okay, [MN] how old are you?" [LAUGH]
R:  That's weird, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know, I've taken one of those exams for, like, a job, like a job required that I take an exam.
L:  Right.  I have that because I work for the state.  We take -- 
R:  And it was weird, though, because I scored, like, high on the advanced and low in the beginner and I'm, like, "That's not possible".
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, but I think the advas- advanced was more, like, keyboard shortcuts -- 
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  -- and the beginner was, like, stupid stuff.
L:  Exactly.  We have tests like that and everyone passes the easy bottom one -- I mean the higher one -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- but the ones below -- 
R:  I don't understand --
L:  -- are more technical.
R:  -- how it works that way, but --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- I guess that's just the way their system is set up.
L:  Because I think I -- I was some basic Excel classes and these people just walked right out -- 
R:  That's weird.
L:  -- and I'm, like, "What?  You got to have to know something". [MN] [inaudible]
R:  Yeah, I mean at -- at least have some kind of contact with the computer.  I mean nowadays everyone -- 
L:  That's why it's -- it is good for them to use it in education because they're going to, no matter what do they down the road.
R:  Mhm.
L:  One -- one of my supervisors is lividly ex- -- she's just afraid of the internet [NOISE] -- 
R:  Wow. 
L:  -- and most of my job is on the internet, so she has no clue 'cause she -- I'm, like, "Just sit with me, it's not that bad".
R:  My aunt is, like, in her eighties and she just got a computer -- 
L:  And she loves it probably. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and she loves it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  She's, like, "It's my new toy, I love this thing", and she's, like, looking at recipes --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and trying to find relatives and ... 
L:  I think that's -- well, if they do start young, then that's what's going to happen.  They are going to be excited, they will have something to do later in life.
R:  And then she just likes it because she can keep in contact with people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because she's so far away.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] That is --
R:  I mean, that's also teaching like a completely different generation.
L:  Well, that's the other good thing.  The kids you see on TV write into the, you know, the air force and the army overseas -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- so that -- that's a benefit.
R:  Yeah, but I definitely think it's, like, taking over.
L:  Well, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's just beyond belief, just, "My gosh".
L:  There's no books any more pretty soon.
R:  No.
L:  Well, you can take college courses on line now.
R:  Yeah, that too.  That's co- --
L:  One of my bosses did that.
R:  Oh.
L:  He just sat there at home, he just read along.  I don't know if I would like that.
R:  Yeah, it's not really that structured.  I mean, you have -- you'd probably have, like, a lot of distractions. 
L:  That's what I said.  We talked about it and I said to him, "You know, I think, yeah, I'd be watching TV, listening to radio, doing laundry". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, you know, exactly, like sitting -- it's hard to sit still for something like that.
L:  Yeah.  You're not told to sit still, so -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I think my mind would just be -- he did it, got his masters degree on line. [LAUGH]
R:  That's crazy.
L:  I'm like, "Wow". [LAUGH] I don't know if -- "I don't know how you did it" because I would be, whatever -- 
R:  Yeah, like, -- 
L:  -- doing the dishes, doing -- playing the dog. 
R:  I don't know who would actually take that seriously, though.
L:  It counts because it's legitimate colleges.
R:  I guess.
L:  It costs more money, but I mean our job paid for it so he didn't care.
R:  Yeah, so he didn't care.
L:  But I'm, like, "Oh, no, I don't know if that's a benefit".
R:  Yeah.  I guess you're learning.  
L:  [inaudible]
R:  It's not the traditional way, but now they do the SAT[?] on line, too.
L:  Oh, I didn't know that.
R:  Yeah.  It's completely converted to computer.
L:  So when the -- the kids go, that's how they take the SAT? 
R:  Mhm.  They go into -- 
L:  No way.
R:  -- they go into -- they go into a classroom and every person has a computer.
L:  I had -- 
R:  And if you want to skip something, you just, like, click on the box that says "Skip" and then you could go back to it later on.
L:  I didn't know that.
R:  But that totally messes up your way of learning because if you are used to learning through a book and then you're being tested on the computer, I think that kind of throws things off.
L:  Yeah.  That is weird.  I didn't know that at all.
R:  Yeah.  That's been going on for a -- at least maybe four or five years now.
L:  Wow.
R:  And in the beginning you had the option -- 
L:  You could do either one.
R:  -- you could take the paper or the computer and now I think the computer is mandatory.
L:  Wow!  That's true, though, because what if you're, like, "I don't know".
R:  I think if you're just so used to using the computer.
L:  Yeah.  You would have to really know the computer to be able to scroll and, like you said, press the boxes and -- 
R:  Yeah, and to go back.  I think that's kind of hard, though, just because they -- I think you're -- when you're learning you're used to your surroundings -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then taking a test on a computer is completely different -- 
L:  Yeah, it is.  
R:  -- because it's not your normal learning surroundings, it's like a different envir-
