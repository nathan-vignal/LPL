L:  Hello my name is Brian. 
R:  Hello Brian.
R:  Hi Brian, [LAUGH] I'm actually married to a Brian.
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Imagine that with a Y or an I? 
R:  With an I.
L:  Oh, I'm the Y.
R:  Oh, the best of both worlds.  [LAUGH] 
L:  This is the first call I participated in so --
R:  Me too.
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, can I inquire how you found out about it? 
R:  It was emailed to me through a mystery shoppers.
L:  Yeah I wonder what that's all about.  I had a buddy drop me the link -- I just signed actually only three hours ago.
R:  Yeah me too.
L:  [MN] Mhm.
R:  This works out really good.
L:  Um.
R:  So are you married? 
L:  Um, well I was once. I'm working on the second one, um, currently engaged to, um, an HR director of a major company in Philadelphia.
R:  Wow.
L:  Twenty four years old, uh, she has a master's degree, and I personally do, uh, tech support for a game on the Internet.
R:  Wow that's cool -- exciting.
L:  Yeah I guess you could consider it that.
R:  Gees I just don't do anything.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So can I ask you where you're located? 
R:  I am in Utah.
L:  Utah, imagine that.
R:  Yeah I'm not too far from Salt Lake.  We're in [inaudible] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's a -- it's beautiful out here but it's, uh, really distressing.
L:  Stressing? 
R:  At times yeah, just different kinds of people and you know if you don't fit in and they kind of shun you.
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  Yeah and Utah stresses the -- the fact that they're all about the family.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  I think Arizona's better for that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So have you got any kids or anything? 
L:  No I don't.  I was married -- my first marriage, um, -- I joined the military, went to California, um, met the woman of my dreams, married her, uh, -- ten years down the road -- I guess I was still in my selfish stage as far as having children.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I really don't understand the fundamentals part still and I'm thirty eight.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  And as far as, um, the future lies I don't really think I will have kids.  How about yourself?
R:  I just have one.  She'll be thirteen later this year and -- and, um, married three times now.  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  Daughter came from the second marriage.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And you know I never thought I would have any kids, never.
L:  Are you are from Utah? 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  Every chance I got -- I got to get away.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Move away but I always end up coming back.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Having a -- having a kid and everything you know is nice here in -- in [inaudible]
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  It's -- it's a nice place but I never actually really thought I'd have a kid.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  [LAUGH] I didn't want one, it just you know -- just kind of happened but -- but, uh, I don't know.
L:  Not to be rude or anything but, um, did you, um, by chance happen it hear the topic we're supposed to discuss? 
R:  Family.
L:  Oh, family.
R:  Yeah and what it means to you.
L:  Oh, --
R:  So are you close to your family, your mum and dad, sisters, brothers? 
L:  Personally no --, um, --
R:  You're good.  [LAUGH]
L:  As -- as of now, um, -- I come from a family with two other brothers, um, -- we basically lived kind of poor.  My father was an entrepreneur, um, very hard headed individual.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Uh, recently passed away.
R:  Oh.  
L:  And, um, started on talking business and, uh, every available chance, uh, [inaudible] school or just causing a general mishap and not being generally supervised -- we were working so [LAUGH] I had some pretty good work ethics.
R:  See I -- I didn't -- I didn't grow up that way.  I  -- I don't know, my life sucked.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well things are different now a days you know.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You go to gaol for five ten years for hitting you kids now a days.
R:  Yep.
L:  You know.  
R:  Yeah --
L:  Actually I come from -- I come from old school where you beat your kids and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you teach them the difference of right and wrong that way.
R:  Yeah -- you know -- yeah and I -- I believe in that, you know your kid mouths off go ahead and smack them.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  You know you -- if the way --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- disrespect you know everybody now a days is oh god.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know and -- and you're afraid to do anything, especially here in Utah, you're afraid to discipline your kid because somebody's gonna turn you in.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah unfortunately.
R:  You know but, um, I'm a middle child of five in my family.
L:  Wow, there's a nice big Utah cliche huh?
R:  Well actually that's quite small, [LAUGH] but, um, my father's an arsehole.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  And, uh, he has since remarried and she's not very nice, so I don't have anything to do with my father or my older brother or my older sister.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  But, um, or my younger sister but the sister five years younger than me, we're best friends and I love my mother, but, um, as far as family go I think it's a little over rated.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah I hear you there.  I -- I definitely hear you there, um, -- I -- I don't know what happened to the majority of our family values now a days but, uh, I -- I always thought I maybe this was something that I -- I share with a lot of people.  The only way you can actually keep control over your family is number one have -- have the correct amount of money to isolate yourself from the world.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  You know and then everything associated with the family values will fall into place.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know that's, um, -- I only met a couple -- few people that really, really had proper up bringings as far as the attention needed, um, [MN] that really kind of live like the American dream.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And was raised in a loving environment I should say.
R:  I long for that.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm trying to -- to do that with my daughter --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know it -- it's really hard you know because Brian my other half isn't her dad.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But she doesn't spend a lot of time with her real father --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and she's my best friend.
L:  Your daughter is? 
R:  Yep and we are very open to each other, we communicate really, really well, I'm not afraid to hug my child.
L:  But don't they say that's bad to be your best friend of your only child -- your only daughter?
R:  Well you know there's a lot of pros and cons on that.
L:  Right.
R:  But you know my daughter knows that she can come to me about anything and she knows that, um, if it's really bad yeah I'll freak out for a few minutes but then I calm down and -- and we discuss it and we work though it.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And she knows that she can always come to me and depend on me.
L:  Cool.
R:  So you know what --
L:  Okay can I ask you a quick question?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Were you that way with your mother? 
R:  No.
L:  Mhm.
R:  My, uh, -- my father did some really bad things when I was a child.
L:  Sorry to hear that.
R:  And, um, you know I've had a lot to over come with that and I did it well and having a child
