L:  Hi, I'm Kim. 
R:  Hi, I'm Jane.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I've never done this, have you?
R:  No, I've not.  This is my first one. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, me too.  So we're supposed to be talking about computers and education?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And what we think about it.  I --
R:  Of course, I, I think it has to improve education.
L:  Oh, definitely me too.  Do you use computers in your job?
R:  All the time, yes.
L:  Yeah, I do too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What kind of work do you do?
R:  Um, I do merchandising.
L:  Merchandising?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm, a, ah, administrative assistant -- 
R:  Oh, are you really?
L:  -- to senior managers, so I use it all the time.  I'm on my email probably, ah, -- well it stays open constantly all day long.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I use a lot of, um, um, well, you know, we do fliers and a lot of memos, and -- so you do like MS Word, and, um, you know, different programs and stuff.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  I can't hardly remember what it was like, though, before I had a computer.  You know, before we used it.  I mean, I guess you had to just -- I used to use a typewriter, I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's weird, isn't it? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  To think about what life would be like without them.  I think them.
L:  Without it.
R:  Um, you know, there's so much information out there on the, on the internet and stuff too.
L:  Right.  And you can learn so much.  I know that we're taking, um, a -- an employee and I are taking, um, some classes tomorrow at the library.  They're free, and they have, like, MS Word, and, um, different, um, computer classes they offer every month -- 
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  -- at no cost.  Yeah, and they were, like, two dollar -- I'm sorry, like two hours a class.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  And so we're doing that, and, um, I'm, I'm self taught, I really didn't have education on the how to use the computer, I've been teaching myself --
R:  Oh, I -- me too. [LAUGH]
L:  -- really?  But you know, there's a lot of little, um, tricks and things that you can learn, like how to use your icons on your toolbar, and I did not know, you know, when I would want to copy and paste, I would go there to, to edit and, you know, do the long way, and so when I took an intro to Word class a few weeks ago, I discovered that the icon's right there, I just have to click on it.  So, it, it really -- going to -- I guess my point is going to those classes, um, really helped, um, educate me on, on what I'm doing and stuff.
R:  Yeah, I do all -- you know, like most of my reports and stuff are done over the internet, so I would be just totally lost [LAUGH] without my computer.
L:  Right.
R:  And I -- yeah, I taught myself too, so.
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  And I think kids today, if they don't have a computer they're gonna be way behind in --
L:  I know.  You know the kid -- my son, though, he's, ah, sixteen, he's in high school, he had -- takes computer tech, um, or business, business -- well, takes computer tech and, um, applications and, um, computer -- business computers I think is what the class is, and he knows so much more than I do.
R:  Oh, I can imagine. [LAUGH]
L:  The kids that come out of school today, they know Powerpoint, and -- I mean, just like even in junior high they know Powerpoint and they know, um, you know, um, ah, what's it, Publisher, and --
R:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH]
L:  -- all the different software programs that I don't know at all.  I thought I knew quite a bit, but I don't know, um, near what he does.  But I've been taking some classes just to, you know, try to learn, um, a little bit --
R:  That's neat though, that the library holds them like that, that is -- yeah, that's bound to help. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It does.  And then, you know, our, um, junior, um, college here, our community college, um, they offer, um, ah, they would have, like their tech- [inaudible] technology center, they offer -- like I guess I told you that I'm from Tulsa.
R:  No, oh, cool.
L:  Yeah.  So where are you from?
R:  I'm from Kentucky.
L:  Oh, wow.  That's nice.  That's kinda neat, talking to somebody from so far away.
R:  [LAUGH] This is --
L:  Yeah, so.
R:  This is --
L:  Yeah, our, um, technology department are -- or colleges, they offer some classes, and then we have the Park Association, they offer computer classes too.  But now theirs are not free, but they're pretty inexpensive.  But it's --
R:  Do you get --
L:  -- nice that the library offers the free ones.
R:  Yeah, I think, I think I'll check into that and see if I can find something here -- [LAUGH]
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- to educate myself.
L:  Yeah, if you live in a, um, a major city, then I'm sure your library --
R:  Oh no, I live way in the boonies. [LAUGH]
L:  You do?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, well.  You know.
R:  But you know, the -- and that's one thing I think's neat, you know, we have, like, one library here, and so, you know, if the kids have -- you know, if they have computers and stuff, they can --
L:  Well, if you're in a small town they might not offer it I guess, but --
R:  Prob- probably not.
L:  Yeah.  But anyway, talking about education, yeah, it's obviously, ah, important to, um, to try and take classes, 'cause I -- when I just did that intro class, I was wasting so much time going and doing everything the long way.  And it's just so much easier.  So tomorrow we're taking the intermediate class --
R:  Taking what?
L:  -- which is -- the intermediate, which is just, like, step two.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah, the class and -- of course these are short classes, they're not long classes, like, -- you know, so they just kind of touch on everything.  You know, but --
R:  I use Excel a lot, and, ah, --
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It provides --
L:  Oh, I bet you do in your job.
R:  Huh?  Well I --
L:  I bet you do in your job.
R:  -- I do, um, a lot of work in, like, retail stores and stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that I do all -- you know, I have reports and stuff I have to do, um, with the Excel, ah, I don't know, like they'll send you a form and you have to fill it out over that, and all my pay is done through -- over the internet.  It, it's all -- you know, it's pretty -- it's pretty cool.  But if I --
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  -- if my computer goes down, I'm just, like, out of business here. [LAUGH]
L:  I hear you.  Me too.  My -- I've got a really old one at work, and um, every so often it'll go on the blink and I can't stay and I can't get a thing done and I'm the crabbiest person around here.
R:  Oh, you too? [LAUGH] And when my computer's --
L:  My boss will be, like, "What is wrong with you?"  And I'm like, "I can't do anything.  I can't do a thing.  I can't send anything".  He's like, "Well surely you can do something".  I said, "All I can do is file" -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- who wants to file?  I can't do a thing without my computer.  I have to have it.
R:  Ah, that's me.  If something happens to my computer I would stay up for days to get it fixed.  Um, I don't know --
L:  Well you can have the, the Excel -- like in Excel, I took a couple of Excel classes.  And to me it was kinda hard to master a little bit.  Um, you know, the program as far as -- I can do it, like sort of those -- the charts, it was kinda intimidating to try to develop the, um, the Excel tables and stuff --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- and get everything just right.  You know --
R:  I would love to be able to take a class and learn more.  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think I learn a little bit, you know, as time goes on, but I'd love to learn more.
L:  Yeah.  Well you're never too old either, um, you know, to learn, because, um, computers are -- well, and you know, in the classes I took too, there was a lot of older people in there too.  It's not young -- really young people, 'cause they're learning that in junior high and high school.  You know --
R:  I think it's --
L:  -- when I was --
R:  -- I think it's cool that they're, you know, that they teach the kids -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.
L:  When I was in college, you know, we were learning, um, -- they were just very simple, it was like creating a computer program, it was like MSDOS.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And you worked in MSDOS.  You didn't work in, um, you know, like in any of these programs.  They didn't have -- 'cause I went to college back in nineteen eighty, ah, seven --
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  So they didn't have -- they -- it's not like it was now.  Now they have the internet, the superhighway, and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they have all this really cool stuff, you know, that they didn't have then, so.
R:  Yeah, I just -- I, you know, I don't know where I would be without the internet.  I think that there's just so much information out there, and just that it -- you know, in a matter of minutes you can find anything that you're looking for.  I think -- I don't know, it has to be a help to the kids, you know, that are going to school.  It just --
L:  I know, they have so much more than we had too. [LAUGH]
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  You know --
R:  Grab out the encyclopedias, and -- [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm, definitely.  
R:  And now all they have to --
L:  So do you get -- go ahead.
R:  Now all they have to do is just, you know, type it in and it's right there for them, so.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  They have it -- I think they have it easier than they think they do, definitely, with the, with the computers and all.
R:  Oh, I'm sure -- yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Do you, um, do you get a lot of your jobs at, at, um, -- on the computer --
R:  On the net?
L:  -- on the internet? 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You do.
R:  Mum, yep.
L:  Yeah, you sound like you do something I do part time.  I do, um -- I was doing some merchandising, but I do, um, mystery shopping too, and so I get --
R:  Oh, I do -- I do too.
L:  You do too? 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I get -- that's how I get the majority of my work is from the computer, and I -- and you know, at first whenever they were having everybody send the reports, like, on the computer, just a few years ago that started, I hated doing that, 'cause I was, like, oh, it's just a hassle, and -- but now, I, I hate having -- if, if anybody -- if you have to send a report that you like faxed or something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I hate doing that -- 
R:  I do --
L:  -- because it's so --
R:  It's so -- to me it's easier to just type -- do it over the net.
L:  Right.  It's so time consuming to fax anything.  Computers are, you know, um, you just can't even put a value on them.
R:  Well, this is really cool, that you mystery shop and stuff.  I do, I do more -- much more merchandising than I do mystery shop.
L:  You do?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Huh.
R:  But, ah, to me it's more -- it's more profitable to merchandise.
L:  Oh, it is.  It's more -- what is it? 
R:  Profitable.
L:  Profitable? 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, I can see that.  I do that part time, and then I found out about this, you know, through something like that too.  But, well cool --
R:  How did -- you're probably in one of my groups, I bet.
L:  I bet.  Are you on shopper match, or --
R:  Huh?
L:  Are you on shopper match, or --
R:  Ah, no.
L:  Huh.
R:  Um, let's see --
L:  The Yahoo groups?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, I'm in some of those Yahoo! groups too.
R:  [LAUGH] This is so cool.
L:  Well -- yeah.  Well, this is pretty cool too, I don't -- let's see, what else can we talk about computers in education.  You're going to check in to the library -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I'm gonna get --
L:  -- and see if they of- offer anything.
R:  I really will.  I think that is really, you know, a neat idea.
L:  I'm going to, um, --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- check and see.  I think my, um, library, they offer Excel and stuff too, and I think I'm going to take a refresher course, um, because -- oh, you know, if you don't use it you lose it, you know, when you take --
R:  That is
