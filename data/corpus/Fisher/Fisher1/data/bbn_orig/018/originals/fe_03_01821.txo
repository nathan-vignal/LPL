R:  I don't know if you have.
L:  Oh, no.  [NOISE]  
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  So, I guess we- we're just supposed to talk for ten minutes about -- 
L:  [NOISE] Do you think -- 
R:  -- education. 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  And computers.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] Um, how does, ah, ed- do you think education improves -- I mean computers improve [MN] education, or do you disagree? 
R:  Okay, ah, do you have --  
L:  [NOISE]  
R:  -- any comments [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Um, yeah, I think computers, um, computers -- shut up Melissa -- [NOISE] I think computers technology improve education.
R:  That they do? 
L:  Ahah.  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, I definitely would say so, and especially for grammar school, elementary school kids it gives them a heads up, those kids that have computers in the school, compared to other kids who don't have access.
L:  Ahah.
R:  Ah, Because they -- they just have more access to things on the internet and, ah, they get more focus maybe, more attention at certain times of ed- -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- ah, attention to certain things that they may need [LIPSMACK] -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and individual study, things like that.
L:  [NOISE] I think it, um, [MN] especially helps, ah, people with [several inaudible words] you know what I mean? 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Shut up, I'm on the phone.
R:  [LAUGH] Somebody trying to get your attention? 
L:  [NOISE] Huh?
R:  Somebody's trying to get your attention [LAUGH].
L:  Ahah, I knew it [LAUGH] -- shut up, stop.  Anyway, how old are you? 
R:  How old am I?
L:  Ahah.
R:  I'm thirty seven. 
L:  Where you calling from? 
R:  Where are you calling from?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Philadelphia.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] same. 
R:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, --  
L:  I don't have much to say though.
R:  I know, I don't know --  
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- the -- the one they had yesterday -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- was on foreign relations, did you hear that one? [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah, --  
R:  [LAUGH] I didn't do it because I really didn't have anything to offer but, um, I'm just trying to -- because I guess they analyze speech patterns for people.
L:  [NOISE] Ahah.
R:  When they're doing this.  How old are you?
L:  [NOISE] Sixteen.
R:  Fifteen?
L:  [NOISE] Sixteen.
R:  Sixteen, oh, [LAUGH] so you probably don't have much to comment as far as school -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- do you have computers at your school? 
L:  [NOISE] Ahah.
R:  And do you get a chance to use them [MN] --  
L:  [NOISE] No.
R:  -- [MN] you don't get a chance at all to use them.  Oh, no, do you have a computer at home? 
L:  [NOISE] Ahah.
R:  And do you use that for school work? 
L:  [NOISE] No. [LAUGH] 
R:  No. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Do you get to go to the library and use the computer or no? 
L:  [NOISE] Ah, yeah I go to the library to use a computer but I choose not to.  
R:  Do you feel comfortable using one, or -- 
L:  [NOISE] No, cause --  
R:  No? 
L:  -- it's complicated.
R:  Oh, really [LIPSMACK] that's such a shame.
L:  [MN] 
R:  I -- I mean having access to a computer and I'm going to kill a couple of minutes for the two of us, okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Ahah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Having access to a computer h- has -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- certainly changed my life because now I get to work from home and I work online.  I get to use a computer and stay at home and do what I need to do and I don't have to worry about, you know, going in a- to an office or anything like that so, um, and I've met people from all over the world through using the computer and I have clients from all over the world so, it's -- it's, um, it's the kind of thing that if you have the kind of personality that you're interested in learning and interested in finding out new things, having a computer is terrific.  I just feel bad that you don't get to use one at school.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  I can't believe they don't even say -- like, w- when you do papers for school, for your homework, let's say they say you have a book you have to read -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to read and you have to do a report, do you go to the library and just get a book out and read it instead of -- or, do you try and -- I mean I can't imagine not using the computer --  
L:  [NOISE] Our, um, our computers don't offer [several inaudible words] um, our school don't offer that type of, ah [NOISE] don't offer that type of information, right?  If you got a report, we don't have no library in our school, you only h- if you have got a report you have to go to the library you can't --  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- use the school, ah, computers [NOISE] -- 
R:  So, -- 
L:  -- the only way to using the school computer is you have, ah, um, if you have class for that, but w- I don't have a class for the computer I don't take the computer.  [NOISE] 
R:  Can you take one if they offer it to you, or you -- you would have to -- 
L:  [NOISE] No -- they had to, ah, the system, ah, picks out a roster and whatever roster they get, whatever roster that's -- 
R:  That's who ends up going?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  [NOISE] So, I didn't -- never get to used a computer.  Never use a computer, can use [several inaudible words] we had to use it for the, ah, subjects -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Hold on. [NOISE] Hello?  Yeah, I'm talking to the Fisher Price, I'm gonna call you back.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Hello?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, when you think about like a- you're planning to go to college?
L:  [NOISE] Ahah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And, you know, you can do your applications online now.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  So, you don't even have to, you know, [MN] when you get applications in the mail or stuff for financial aid -- 
L:  [NOISE] You just -- 
R:  -- all that stuff you can do right on a computer now and submit them over the internet -- 
L:  [NOISE] oh, o- -- 
R:  -- and so, [MN] you could fill out one application and submit an application to say twenty different colleges.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  And I -- I just would -- I'd go bug your guidance counselor at your school [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and say, you know, "I wanna have access to the computer".  It's -- I mean I just think about all -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the cool stuff you miss out on like music -- 
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- that, you know, you can download music and [MN] listen to it that way or you can burn a CD and have music, or I don't know if your friends or if you have an MP3 player you can listen to your own mixes and stuff -- 
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. 
R:  -- so, it's not just about, oh, boring school stuff.  I mean you can have fun online -- 
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- you know, there's contests you can enter and magazines you can read online and, um, I guess the biggest -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- thing I guess they want us to say is education. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  I mean I did [MN] my colleague work I did a lot -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of stuff online too and graduate school so, you can, ah  -- I guess you have to be vocal you have to tell them you want to be able to use a -- 
L:  [NOISE] Computer.
R:  -- computer.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But ... 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So, what are you a junior?
L:  [NOISE] Ahah.
R:  You looking forward to graduating?
L:  [NOISE] Ahah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Hopefully.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, don't say that. [LAUGH]  It's just, ah, only --
L:  [NOISE] I just wanna hurry up and get out.
R:  And then go to college hopefully?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I wanna go to college.
R:  Are -- in Philadelphia, or?
L:  [NOISE] No, I wanna go out the state. [MN] 
R:  Out of state completely? [MN] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Stay on the east coast or go to the west coast?
L:  [NOISE] Um, -- 
R:  Or go down south?
L:  [NOISE] I don't know -- I don't know yet, I'm thinking about it. 
R:  Well, there's good schools here.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I don't want to be in Philly though, I wanna be near my family, I -- 
R:  Did you grow up in Philadelphia?
L:  [NOISE] Ahah.
R:  Oh, that's why.  Nobody ever wants to stay in the same place, but [LIPSMACK] oh, goodness, I don't know what else to say here [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Mm.  
R:  Ah, -- 
L:  [NOISE] They need to take different topics though -- 
R:  I know.
L:  -- [NOISE] ah, the first topic there was something Middle East, they had -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [NOISE] ah, I wasn't really into it.  I don't really have too much to say, this lady just kept asking all these dumb questions.
R:  But for ten dollars you can talk about anything, can't you? [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  I can talk for ten minutes. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] I -- I [several inaudible words] -- she wanted -- she wanted to really get into it.  I -- I wasn't so -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in the -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- conversation.
R:  [LAUGH] "But I have nothing to comment on". [LAUGH] 
L:  No, I just saying -- and I just agree with everything she say and she's like, "You don't have anything to say?" I'm like, "No, not really" -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [NOISE] and she's, like, "Oh", which is saying something -- some other stuff talking about how [several inaudible words] and all this stuff -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [NOISE] she's just talking crazy.
R:  I mean t- this whole thing is pretty cool though I mean as far as them looking at how people speak so differently and analyzing the speech patterns, it's pretty cool, um, I don't know why they need it, but it's interesting.  
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So ...
L:  [NOISE] Gives you something to do.
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  [NOISE] I say it gives you something to do.
