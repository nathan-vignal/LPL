L:  My name is -- 
R:  Hi, this is Amy.
L:  Hi, this is Karen.
R:  Karen, hi. [LAUGH] 
L:  How are you?
R:  What's that? 
L:  I said, "How are you?" 
R:  Good, how are you? 
L:  I'm doing good.
R:  Um, what was the topic, I didn't hear it? 
L:  What family means to us.
R:  What family means to us, mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, well, do you have any thoughts on that? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, um, I have lots of family and I'm -- and we're really a close family. 
R:  Ahah.
L:  And that -- there is dysfunctional families out there and there's normal families but I guess there's always some dysfunction, but anyway.
R:  Ahah.
L:  Um, I have a son and a husband.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then I have my parents are living and I have two brothers and they have a wife and kids, both of them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What about you? 
R:  Um, I have six brothers and sisters but none of us have -- none of us are married or have children yet so ... 
L:  That's a --
R:  I think that --
L:  -- big family though.
R:  Yeah, um, so, I don't know, most of my extended family don't live near us so, ah, we're fairly close, um, and we're spread out all over the United States, um, like Boston, Atlanta.  Um, I live in St Louis, I have a sister in Michigan, so it kind of is challenging trying to meet up.  Generally we don't all see each other except around Christmas time.  
L:  Right.
R:  But, um ... 
L:  If you miss Christmas you miss it, huh.
R:  Well, we keep in touch pretty well through email and things like that so ... 
L:  Well, that's great.  
R:  Um, yeah.
L:  I have a cousin that lives near Boston.
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  Yeah, she lives in a little suburb right outside of Boston but they work in Boston.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, it's a nice city, I've been there a few times.
L:  We haven't been there to see her yet but we're gonna go.
R:  Uh-huh.  Where are you from?
L:  Ah, I'm from Dallas.
R:  Dallas.
L:  The Dallas area, I live in Plano.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Texas.
R:  I've actually --
L:  Where are you from?
R:  -- never been to Texas.
L:  Huh? 
R:  I've never been to Texas.
L:  What part of the country are you from? 
R:  Um, Louisville Kentucky. 
L:  Are you really? 
R:  Well, I was actually born in Oklahoma and then I went to Alabama and then we ended up Louisville Kentucky because of my Dad's job but, um, since then I have lived in the mid west mostly, um, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in Chicago and St Louis so ... 
L:  All my family is pretty much right here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's kind of nice because the kids kind of grow up together.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, as you get married and you have kids and stuff it's kind of like it's -- I guess it's just kind of neat for them to grow up with knowing their cousin's really close. 
R:  Ahah, that is nice.  How old is your son? 
L:  He's six, he will be seven in July.
R:  Wow.
L:  And so we stay quite busy with school.  He's in the first grade and -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- just started playing sports and all that good stuff.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So we have gotten involved in all of that.
R:  What does he play? 
L:  Ah, right now we're playing baseball which is -- ah, it's T ball is what they do.  
R:  Oh, okay, mhm.
L:  He's on his last year of T ball and it's coach pitch this year and then the next year they learn how pitch.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So it's kind of interesting.  It can be kind of boring to watch. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Because they are not very good.  It's -- it's cute when your child is playing but it's kind of like oh the rest of the time. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  But we've been going to games with our nephews and stuff for soccer games.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's pretty interesting to watch them play.  It's more fun to watch them play soccer than to watch like baseball for instance. 
R:  Yeah, I can imagine. [LAUGH]
L:  You stay so busy.  I mean when, you have your child playing soccer it's kind of like that is your life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, it kind of dictates your life for so many of the year.
R:  Do they, um, practise every day or ... 
L:  Every day and they have games every weekend so it's like you can't plan any of your family life pretty m-, you know what I mean, everything -- 
R:  Wow. 
L:  -- has to revolve around soccer and ... 
R:  Oh.
L:  So my husband and I, we kind of decided we are going to steer clear of soccer if at all possible unless our son just really wanted to play.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And thus far we have gotten very lucky because he hasn't been that anxious to play it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  I'm relieved over that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it's a good sport, I'm not saying it's not a good sport -- 
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  -- but it does, it occupies your -- your whole life.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But -- 
R:  Well, being from Kentucky I'm more into basketball myself but not to play, just to watch. [LAUGH] I'm not very sports oriented myself but, um, I try to go running, [LAUGH] that's about it.
L:  Yeah.  My husband likes basketball.  My son has shown an interest in basketball.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, Unless he -- 
R:  Is he going to be, um, -- is your son gonna be in summer vacation pretty soon or no? 
L:  Yes.
R:  Yes.
L:  That's coming up real soon.  We are looking --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at summer camps and stuff right now.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Different things that he can, you know, participate in, to not get bored during the summer.
R:  Oh.  Like sports things or different other things? 
L:  Both.  I mean, we have got some sports -- I have got a basketball camp lined up for him to go to.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then there is just like summer, different theme weeks that they have at the YMCA and I have signed him up for one of those and he's gonna go to a golf and tennis, ah, camp and learn how to play golf and tennis.
R:  Oh, wow, that sounds fun.
L:  So, yeah, I figure, you know, they -- they learn so much faster now.  I'm just amazed at how -- how quickly these kiddos are learning compared to when we were in school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it's like in -- in first grade he has done a research paper on the computer and everything.
R:  Really, in first grade?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's amazing. [MN] 
L:  In first grade and I'm just like whoa, I mean, I was learning my alphabet in the first grade.
R:  Wow.
L:  So it's -- it's interesting, you know, the difference and they're like fun just [inaudible].  Well, you know, he picks up everything else so fast --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we ought to look into teaching him, you know, and giving him exposure to all these different sports and stuff like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- tennis and golf and all that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And get him exposed to it early and maybe help him learn it so it will be easier for him in the later years of his life.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And not be like, you know, me, where I had to learn everything as I got older and it's -- it's harder to learn it.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Well, k- -- 
L:  We don't -- we don't pick it up as fast.
R:  Kids these days are definitely -- right, they're definitely better about the computer stuff. [MN]
L:  Yeah. It's just amazing -- I can't -- I just can't get over how fast they learn.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, my brother's kids were home schooled.
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  Yeah, and they learn really fast too but -- you know, so it's -- I didn't have anybody to compare with -- for him going into, like, first grade and in kindergarten and stuff because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they home school their kids and we elected not to do that because we are in a really, ah, good community with a really good public school system.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so we want to put him in the public schools and we have been very happy with it so far but ...
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I don't know what I, um, -- I haven't really thought about that but I know that -- I don't think I'll end up living in Kentucky but I know that the schools that I went to in Kentucky weren't very good at all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The public schools. [MN]
L:  That's one reason we moved to the town that we're living in because the school system is so good and it's well known that it's good.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So you kind of -- you can research on the Internet and find out what like the average SAT scores and stuff for the school districts are.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Yeah, so that's what we did to find out what the best scores were and the average SAT score here in Plano was eleven hundred and forty six. 
R:  Ah, that's pretty good.
L:  Yeah, that's the average score.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I thought well, that's pretty good, that's higher than our score. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So I'm like okay, that's pretty good.
R:  Wow.
L:  But ... 
R:  I didn't know you could do that. [MN]
L:  Yeah, there -- there was a lot that you can research on the Internet.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, my husband and I, we get on the Internet and research a lot of different things and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so that's pretty interesting.  So, do you have mostly brothers or did you say sisters? 
R:  Oh, I have four sisters and two brothers.
L:  Four sisters.  Are they older or younger? 
R:  They are all younger actually.
L:  Really.
R:  Yeah, but we are all very close in age because we're about a year apart. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  All about a year apart and there's some twins in there, there's a set of twins in there.  Um, not identical though, there's one boy and one girl and, ah, [MN] -- so, I don't know, it's actually -- I didn't feel like, ah, because we're so close in age it's not like I feel like -- well, I'm the oldest but it's not that ... 
L:  You're not that much older than them though? 
R:  Yeah, so it's not like I really -- I mean, I sort have had the big sister role but not as much as you would think --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just because we are all so close in age.
L:  Well that's pretty neat, so how old are you? 
R:  Yeah.  I'm twenty seven.
L:  Twenty seven? 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You're just a young girl.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's pretty good.  I'm forty two.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, -- well, that's neat.
R:  So, how old are your brothers, are they older than you or younger? 
L:  I've got a older brother that's -- he's, um, forty six and I've got a younger brother that's forty.
R:  Uh-huh.  And they all live in your town you said? 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They all live in the same area? 
L:  Yeah, they say -- we're all in the Dallas Fort Worth area but we're all in different little suburb towns.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But still it's close enough for --
