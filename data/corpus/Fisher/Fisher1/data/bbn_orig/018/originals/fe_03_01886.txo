R:  Hi, my name is Jan.
L:  Hi, I'm Diana.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay. [LAUGH] Well, I guess we're supposed to talk fa- -- what family means to us -- is that correct?
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, um, I guess family really means to me the people who are closest to me and support me when there, um, is a need, I don't have a large biological family, so I would guess, my friends, and the people of choice are my family.
L:  Right, that's the same way that I feel 'cause I don't have a big family either, so I mean, it's just like me and my brothers and then, my mom and dad --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- so it's mostly my friends who I consider my family too, so -- [MN]
R:  I mean, they a- are the ones that we- we do [MN] things with, and would have, um, say, [SIGH] Easter, that's who we celebrated Easter with, and we have older people who are, [MN] I guess you would say, in a grandparent role [SIGH] and when my son, um, got married, you know, all these people were at the wedding, it was not like, um, there was that many people from [SIGH] the biological family.
L:  Right.
R:  Is that what it's like in your situation?
L:  Oh, well, I only, I don't, I don't know, [MN] I don't know any of my grandparents or anything like that, the only family that I have is my mom and dad and I have three brothers.
R:  Oh.
L:  -- those are, those are the only ones, and I live far away from them anyway, so I don't even see 'em for holidays or anything like that.
R:  Oh, okay, so, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you live away fr- -- I mean, do you have your own family?
L:  [MN]
R:  Do you have -- are you married or, um, have, you know, a situation away from your family?
L:  Well, I have a boyfriend and that's who, that's who I spend most of my holidays with, I go over to his family's house --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- so I mean, it's the same thing but it's, it's not you know, 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you [inaudible] to your family. I was always close to my family, 'cause there was not many of us.
R:  Mhm?
L:  [MN]
R:  But I mean, is there a reason you can't go home on holidays, is it too far to go, or --
L:  Oh, well, no, I just, I -- it's not that far but I just don't have a way there, 'cause I don't drive --
R:  Ah --
L:  So it's, it's farther away and stuff, and, and I kind of did some, some, some mean stuff to my family, and they're kind of, you know --
R:  [LAUGH] On the out?
L:  A little -- little hesitant about my coming up there,  and stuff, so --
R:  Oh, well, I mean, [MN] well, [MN] do you go to school, or, mm, what do you do?
L:  No, I'm, I'm out of school, I -- I have my own business.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah, I run it  I run it out of my house, so --
R:  Mm? Well, it's funny, because, you know, um, on the internet, there's so many people that I've met through, you know, being on the internet, and I actually feel closer to those people than I do to -- to people that I know in person in my family. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  See, I don't really, I don't really get into that.
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I had for a while and stuff, but I never got really close to anybody over the internet.
R:  Oh, --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- see, that was where I saw about this project, it was listed on one of the, um, the boards, it was listed that they need, um, were looking for, people to, um, participate in this, this project --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that was how I, you know, found -- I mean, was that how you found it?
L:  Yes. Oh, yeah.  
R:  It was on, you know, one of the boards, and I thought, hm, that's interesting.
L:  Yeah, that's how, that's how I found it, so -- [LAUGH]
R:  Really?  It must be pretty new, because, um, I hadn't even heard anything about it.
L:  Well, I did, my first one I did was, like, three, it was back in January, or February was my first phone call that I did --
R:  Boy!
L:  -- so, it's, it's been a couple of months, that I haven't heard anything from, from them.
R:  Oh, and then, like, what did they do, did they -- I mean, they just called me to- -- now, I mean, is that how they called you?
L:  No, I called.  
R:  Oh.
L:  You can -- you -- they'll either call you --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- or you can call into them.
R:  Oh, that's  --
L:  -- because I-I haven't been getting the phone calls for times that I put down.
R:  Mhm?
L:  I'm usually on the computer at that time, so I [LAUGH] don't get the phone call.  So I just call in.
R:  Oh.  Well --
L:  See --
R:  -- it looks like it's interesting --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But you haven't done it since back in January?
L:  Right.  It was January or February was the last time I did it.  Well, they were -- they shut down for a while, 'cause I guess they had some problems --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- and they just started back up, I believe it was, like, last week or the week before.  They just started it back up.
R:  Oh, okay, well, I mean, but did they pay you the money for the January?
L:  No, that, um, they're sending it out at the end of this month, they said.  They're doing checks at the end of this month.
R:  Oh, okay, it looks like it was sponsored by a university, or something --
L:  Right, I b- -- it's  I believe it's through Pennsyl- -- the University of Pennsylvania.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  Well, it seems interesting.  I guess, you know, they have different topics --
L:  Right.
L:  -- and it's [MN] lin- linguistic or whatever, I guess they have somebody transcribe all of the notes, um, and then, I guess they're looking to see what different tones sound like or something.
L:  Right.  Right, that's how I understood it too, so --
R:  Well, it sounds interesting --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- as far as family go, it sounds like you and me are about sparse as can be.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because, ah, you know, the situation, there's been a lot of, um, people in our families that we really just don't see anymore --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we're related by blood and that's about it.
L:  Right.  Well, see, that's how it is for lots, it's like, my mom's family, um, her mom just recently died and she hadn't talked to her in, like, twenty years.
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and her sisters and everything, they just -- they just finally met back up after, like, twenty years, it's just like they never, we never talk to them and stuff.
R:  Boy.
L:  But we, we kind of had a problem with, with my mom's side of the family, when we had moved --
R:  Mhm?
L:  --we put all of our stuff in storage and they went and stole it from us.  So that's why we really didn't talk to them.
R:  Wow!
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, um.
L:  -- so we've had, we've had some problems in our family, and that's why we don't talk to 'em too much.
R:  I don't blame you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't, well, family has got, you know, dysfunction in it, though.
L:  Right.  Oh, yeah.
R:  I mean, I don't, I don't think there is any family that is perfect or even close to it.
L:  Right.
R:  So, you're willing to really, just, not -- I -- I don't really expect too much, um, and, I think in terms of holidays and things, people get their hopes and expectations so high that there's nothing that could live up to it.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Nothing short of, um, the Cleaver family.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Right?
L:  Right. Yeah --
R:   But you know, the people that I know, the people that I meet through -- through my work, um, I, you know, consider them like family, you spend more time with people you're working with than you really do --
L:  Right.
R:  -- with your family.
L:  Oh, yeah, that's how I met a lot of my friends, it's through work and stuff, and it's like or, or school --
R:  Mm?
L:  -- when I was in high school, and it's like, I've known them for over ten years.
R:  Right, I mean, you're with people for forty, fifty hours a week and actually I -- in more confined situations --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so they know more about what's going on in your life, what's going on -- [SIGH] in [SIGH] healthwise, and different things --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so they've been there for support.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's who I, that's the ones, that's people I count on, is, is my friends, I don't, I mean, it's like my mom will help me out, you know, once in a while, and stuff, but I don't, I don't go to her for help, I'll go to my friends.
R:  Oh, and you, I mean --
L:  You know, when I have--
R:  -- you don't any children?
L:  No, [LAUGH] No, I'm too young.
R:  No, I don't have -- I don't have any either.    [LAUGH] well, it's -- I don't know, I-I know people who have children, and a lot of them, they're -- they don't really have much more of a family quote unquote life than people that don't.
L:  Right.
R:  We've met a lot of people that, um, we've more or less just sort of adopted, of adopted type of children, or whatever, and it probably works out better.
L:  Yeah. But see, I tell you, with my boyfriend, his, ah, his nieces and nephews and stuff, they come over all the time --
R:  Oh, --
L:  -- and you know, it's like that's  it's -- they, they -- I consider them my family --
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  -- you know, 'cause I'm always doing stuff for 'em, and everything like that, you know.  So that's the -- that's the  -- that's -- that's the kids that I consider my family.
R:  Yeah, I've got, you know, ki- -- I've got people that I've met through different places and, when it's their birthday, or whatever, we take 'em out to dinner, or they come over, and we have, um, you know, have some kind of little event, and, you know, a lot of 'em, now, they're having, um, graduations and doing things from school, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, you know, I try to honor those people more so than tr- -- just, just because you're related by blood, blood is thicker than water, but so's mud.
L:  Right.  
R:  So -- [LAUGH]
L:  Right, yeah, oh, yeah.
R:  --I don't hold too much credence to that. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:   Do most of your friends have big families, or are they close to them?
L:  Um, some of them do, some of them don't. My best friend, she's, she's only got, she's only got a small family, and she just, she just spends most of the holidays and stuff with them, it's just like four or five of them --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- so, but they don't [MN] -- none of my friends really have a big family.  Which is -- I
