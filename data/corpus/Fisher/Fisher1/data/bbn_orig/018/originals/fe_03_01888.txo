R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name is Jean and I'm in Florida.
R:  Hi, my name's Mary and I'm in Pennsylvania.
L:  Well hi, Mary.
R:  Hi, nice to meet you.
L:  Tell me about your family.
R:  Well --
L:  What does it mean to you?
R:  My family is very important to me, I'm extremely close to both my parents.  Um, I have one younger brother.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, um, [MN] you know, we're all very close.
L:  Do you live near each other?
R:  I, actually, we live probably, mm, about ten minutes from each other.  From my family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just got married last year.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so I was living in New York for, oh, three years, and that was extremely difficult.
L:  I guess, yeah.
R:  Especially on my mom who um, well we called and  emailed, thank goodness for email.
L:  Yeah I know, it saves you a lot of money on the phone bill.
R:  Oh, yeah.  But --
L:  You see, my situation is very different.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I live farther from my parents than anybody else in my family.  I mean, Florida's a big state.  
R:  Right.
L:  They live in another part of the state.
R:  Okay.
L:  Okay, I'm in the modern, blended family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I started out with your regular parents and, and I have one younger brother, and then my mother had the misfortune to die.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, gee.
L:  And my dad remarried a woman who already had two children.
R:  Okay.
L:  And then they subsequently had another child.
R:  So, your, your mom died when you were really young?
L:  Thirteen, yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  A very bad time.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  Right in the middle of puberty.
R:  That's horrible.
L:  Yeah, it was not good.  It's never good.
R:  Oh, no, but that's a rough time.
L:  You know?  But that, yeah, it was very difficult.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, you know, my, my family is what the sociologists call the out of sight, out of mind family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And what that means is, when you're there, you're great.
R:  Right.
L:  And if you're not, you never hear from them.
R:  That's, that's pretty much with all our, the only people we really keep in touch with are my parents and my brother and, and my husband's, you know, immediate family.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But as far as relative's go, it's the ones you see at weddings and funerals. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  But I mean I'm talking my immediate family, I mean seriously.  I visited my parents in January.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The end of January.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we had a real nice time and, and they were even saying, "Oh, could you stay longer?  We would do all these things".  It's like, "No", you know?  "I live where I live, and, I have my work and" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- "I have things I have to do".  And then, literally, months went by.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  And I, I emailed my dad --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I thanked them for the good time.  I didn't hear anything.  You know, he forwarded me some garbage --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I thought, "Oh yeah right", you know?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Finally I emailed him back and I said, "Please don't forward me stuff".  
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  "I want to know what's going on with you".
R:  That's right.  
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So yeah, they're, they're um, I don't know what to say, they're a little strange.  And I've gotten used to it, I mean this is just the way that they are.  Now my brother and I are pretty close.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we stay in touch.  
R:  Right.
L:  My kid sister, sometimes I hear from her a lot, other times I don't.  She's going to graduate school --
R:  Okay. 
L:  -- so she's really busy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And she works full-time.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know, so I'm, I'm like understanding why I'm not hearing from her.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  You know?  And my other sister is very busy with her work, and she's just not very email oriented.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Now are your parents closer to the, to your other brothers and sisters?
L:  Oh, yeah, both my sisters live in the same town as my parents.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And my brother lives like only fifty miles away.
R:  Right.
L:  Where I live is about a hundred and fifty miles away.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So it's like, it's just far enough, especially driving alone.  It takes about three and a half hours.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  You don't go just for one or two nights, you know?
R:  No, no, that's a long trip.  Yeah.
L:  So, you just kind of break, you know?  So, in a way, you know, in a way I'd like to have a closer family.
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  And then in another way, I'm, I'm a really independent person.
R:  Yeah, it's what you're used to, right.
L:  So it's not, it's not a problem.  I mean I'm used to taking care of myself.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know there are times when maybe you'd like to talk something over with somebody?
R:  Mhm, right.
L:  You know, and you can do that.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, like you're, even something simple, you're thinking of buying a washing machine.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  Maybe you'd like to get a little advice.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, families are good for that kind of stuff.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And, you know, and my, my father's funny, because if I ask him for advice, oh, he's very flattered, you know.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  But, um, yeah, they're, they're funny about that.  And, you know, I, I'm sorry I haven't gotten married.  I'd like to get married.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, you don't get married just to get married.
R:  No, no, that's, that's funny that you said that.  My, um, my brother, he has a serious girlfriend now that, you know, all growing up, all through high school and everything, we never met any of his girlfriends, and now this one --
L:  Oh, so finally, he introduces you.
R:  [LAUGH] Finally there's one there that, you know, that he wants us to meet, and so tonight we're going out to dinner with her.
L:  Oh, the first time.
R:  Well, my parents have met her, but this is the first time I'm meeting her.
L:  Uh-huh.  She's probably a nervous wreck.
R:  She probably is.  I'm really nervous too, but it's funny, because even without meeting her, I'm very d- --you know, very defensive, [LAUGH] and very protective of him.
L:  You're protective of your brother, yeah.
R:  Yeah, and so, and we, um, --
L:  Yeah, but, but you know just the fact that she means enough to him that he wants you to meet her.
R:  That's right.
L:  I mean this, this is like a big deal for him, obviously.
R:  It's funny though, 'cause when I was dating my husband, I didn't realize it from their point of view how hard it must have been on him.  You know, seeing his sister -- 
L:  Oh yeah.
R: -- moving to New York with somebody and, everything and now, even my mom's like, she's like now we're on the other side, and I could be, like, the mother-in-law. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  So, it's different, but --
L:  It is, it's, it is, it's very interesting.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is your brother younger or older?
R:  He's younger.
L:  Younger.  Yeah, see I'm the oldest in my family also.
R:  Yeah, so ...
L:  You know.  And it's, it's weird because sometimes people ask me for advice.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because I'm the oldest.  What's weird is when your parents ask you for advice.  Does that ever happen to you?
R:  Not too often.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  They're pretty, they're pretty self-sufficient.
L:  I mean I'm not, I'm not saying it's happened very much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, but occasionally.  Occasionally.
R:  Probably my mom more so than, you know, my dad. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, or, you know, I'm close with my dad, but not nearly, you know like with my mom.
L:  Yeah well, and guys are like, just, I think in general, more hesitant to ask --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for advice from anybody.
R:  Probably.
L:  You know?  I mean you know the, the whole thing about how a guy will drive around for miles --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and never ask for directions.
R:  That's very true.
L:  Yeah.  Weird, but, weird but true.
R:  Yeah that's what, that's what they do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so [MN] ...
L:  So but no, I'm, you know, and it, you know to me, I think the most important thing is, would you be friends with the people in your family even if you weren't related?
R:  That's right, yeah that's it.
L:  I think that's like, you know the really big question and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Definitely for my, with my brother, absolutely I would say yes, you know?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Now, um, I have some cousins that I, no.
R:  Mhm, yeah, me too.
L:  You know?
R:  [LAUGH] Definitely.  Yeah.
L:  I mean it's like, you know we don't, I mean I, but, my one cousin visits in Florida every year.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  And so she always makes this big deal of seeing me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And seeing my brother, and you know, see, and it, and yet, we're not really connecting.
R:  No.
L:  You know, we have this conversation, I'm going, "Why did this woman want to see me?"  You know, I don't know her, I don't know anything about her, I don't care.  But she doesn't have any brothers or sisters.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  She doesn't have, her parents are gone.
R:  Mhm.
L:  She doesn't have any close relatives, so I guess it means something to her, it's like --
R:  Just, yeah.
L:  -- okay, you know, I mean, you know, we have lunch, it's fine.
R:  Right.  Yeah, I have a lot, I actually have one cousin who, I mean growing up we were, we were like sisters, we, you know, spent the night at each other's house --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we were constantly together, and then through high school and that, we just, we grew up, you know and just went, we were in different schools and that.
L:  You drifted away from each other?
R:  So we went, you know, different ways.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then just recently, we, um, an uncle passed away, and so we saw each other at the funeral, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And exchanged email, and wrote, you know, once or twice. [LAUGH] And then --
L:  And then that was it?
R:  -- there's, I have nothing to say to her.  
L:  Oh, isn't that funny?
R:  You know, I like her and everything, but there's just, there's nothing there any more.
L:  Yeah.  See we're, with old friends --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- somebody that you've got this, I mean, I've got friends who, I, when I went on vacation, I saw a friend I had not seen in over twenty years.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But we've stayed in touch, even though all we've done all this time is exchange Christmas cards, and yet when I saw her, it was like not a day had gone by.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  And so in a way, I mean, she's almost closer to me than, a lot of my friend are --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than some of my family members.
R:  Oh, yeah, me too.
L:  Because we have this really good basis of understanding.
R:  That's right.  Yeah, I had, um, a pen pal that I, I had since second grade who's in Australia.
L:  Oh, how cool.
R:  And, um, we, you know, we never met, we wrote, you know for all these years.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, just, she actually came up here for my wedding last year.
L:  Aw! 
R:  And then that was the first time we met --
L:  Aw!
R:  -- and, um, [LAUGH] and it was great, it was like, you know, we knew, you know, meeting at first was a little strange 'cause you're like, "Oh, she's kind of a stranger", but then once you talk to her, you're like, "She knows more about me than [LAUGH] than most people do" --
L:  That is so cool that she did that.
R:  -- than anybody.  Oh, it was great.  But, you know, it's just like, once you start talking and whipping out old pictures and everything, you're like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- "Whoa, we do know each other".
L:  Oh yeah, 'cause you exchange pictures and everything all along.
R:  Oh yeah.  Yeah, so.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we kinda like grew up together and I'm so much closer to her, even though she's, you know, so far away than, you know, a lot of relatives.
L:  That's really funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I, I think that's very neat.
R:  [MN]
L:  Now I, I've had foreign pen pals, but not for a very long time.  Now my sister, my kid sister, married a guy she met on the Internet.
R:  Really?
L:  Yes, from England.
R:  Well I'll be.
L:  Yeah.  You know, and I mean, she's a little odd.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But he was, like, in the computer industry.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He's, like, a programmer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So his social skills were kind of limited.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, he wasn't really good at meeting women.  I have to say her social skills are kind of limited.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But he's a really terrific guy.
R:  Oh.
L:  They seem very happy.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  You know but I would, I would be hesitant.
R:  Yeah I would, I had a friend who um, was talking to somebody on the Internet for a really long time, and then um, she went to meet him, I'm like, "You better take somebody with you".  You don't know who's coming, you know, that's, that's scary. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know, I know.  No, she went, well she --
