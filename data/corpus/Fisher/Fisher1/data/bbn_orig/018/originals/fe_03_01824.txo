L:  Hello? 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Hi, [NOISE] my name is Mary.
L:  Hi, Mary, I'm John, ah, where are you from Mary? 
R:  I'm in -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- New Jersey.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  Ahah. 
L:  I'm actually from, ah, Michigan, I'm in, ah, Michigan State right now.
R:  Ahah, okay. 
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, it looks like our topic is, ah, computers in education --  
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- So, yeah [NOISE] Um, what are your feelings on computers in education, do you think they help or harm? 
R:  Um, I think they definitely help --  
L:  [NOISE] Mm-kay.
R:  -- um, particularly in the school system and, ah, just the ability to research just about anything --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- over the internet -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, I think they can also -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- be detrimental as far as they're just used for games --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- or if you get totally involved with the internet and [NOISE] lose touch, ah [NOISE] with -- with communicating with people and [NOISE] --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] but I think, ah, in limited use I think they're very good.
L:  Yeah, absolutely -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I agree with you.  Um, I'm actually writing a paper -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- right now that's dealing with, ah the technologies dealing with, ah, you know, distance learning and education of that sort you know, where you can take online courses and things of that nature.   
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I thought I heard a baby in the background, have you ever -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- are you a mother, or? 
R:  Yes, yes, I have a four year old and a one year old.
L:  Awesome, awesome.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Have you ever considered doing, like, a distance learning course or anything of that nature? 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yes, actually I have.
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  I've, ah, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- done that with the [NOISE] ah, Empire -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- State College in New York.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Really?  I -- some of my research has mentioned that college.  How did th- how did that go for you? 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Pretty good, um, but I found the course actually harder, um, from a distance learning than actually attending classes, but --  
L:  Really? [NOISE]  
R:  But from a scheduling perspective it was much easier.
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it just-- it required -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a lot more -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- paperwork and, ah, --  
L:  [NOISE] A lot more paperwork.
R:  -- a lot more reading. [MN]  
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  Ahah.
L:  But, ah, like how was the class taught, what kind of, ah, what kind of, ah, curriculum was used for, ah, that particular class? 
R:  Actually it was, ah -- it was systems administration, um, course --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and [LIPSMACK] they sent me the text book and, ah, it was you know, back and forth with some questions --  
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- And, ah, you know, you can do some online chat type of things -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- during the class -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and, ah, I -- it also involved [NOISE] mailing a lot of the paperwork -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to the professor instructor --
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  -- and -- and that's where, um, there was --  
L:  Some of the --
R:  -- a lot of work and lot of -- a lot more projects than you would get in the traditional class. [NOISE] 
L:  I see.  So, it's like less, ah, online and more along the lines of just being -- 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Book study --
L:  -- at a distance --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I see --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I see.  Would you do it again do you think, was it worth it?
R:  Yes, I would, mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  That's cool.
R:  Yep. [NOISE] 
L:  That's really interesting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, um, my perspective on computers and learning is that, ah, I don't know -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- frankly I think they've been kind of detrimental because as you've mentioned one of the pluses is that you are able to research so easily on the internet --  
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- but, ah, I think that encourages a lot of, ah, [LIPSMACK] a lot of cheating --  
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- in all honesty, you know, people just, ah, [NOISE] taking what they find on the internet -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- for face value and then using that as, you know, their own material --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean in the end the internet really promotes [MN] practices such as that I think --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I mean in all honesty I -- I find that -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it has helped me a lot, you know, but I think -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- overall it's kinda -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- cheapened the education system -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a lot of thoughts aren't necessary -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- one's own any more just -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- what they happen to read -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- on the internet and y- -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  How do you feel about that?
R:  [NOISE] Um, I agree with that [NOISE] I also -- [NOISE] you have to be careful --  
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- you have to know -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- what your source is -- 
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. 
R:  -- and you can do a search and read an article -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and unless you know [NOISE] what organization -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- or, you know [NOISE] person you're reading [NOISE] you know -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] I mean it -- it could be completely inaccurate. [NOISE]  
L:  Right, right.  
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  Absolutely [NOISE]  
R:  [NOISE] Yep.
L:  Yeah.  So, do you personally use a computer very often, ah, did you -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- use it at all during your, ah, during your online -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- course or how has that -- how has that worked out for you? [NOISE]  
R:  [LIPSMACK] I used it a little bit. [NOISE]  
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] and I got my degree in nineteen ninety eight and actually -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- since about two thousand I've used the computer considerably more than when I did in college.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] So, you went through college -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, without [NOISE] using the computer so much? 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Wow that's --  
R:  Basically 
L:  I mean I can't even imagine something like that.  I mean it seems like the computer -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- is a real integral part of what I have to do -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- every single day.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Um, how -- how are your classes structured and whatnot and like how did -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- ah, did you have any, like, large lectures or anything like that -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- how was the, ah professor able to communicate with the -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- whole group and -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- outside of class? 
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] Um, [NOISE] just -- just through that chat room and then just though, ah, [NOISE] the mail [NOISE] and --  
L:  Wow.
R:  -- [NOISE] grading the assignments and having them come back. [NOISE]  
L:  Mm.  If you don't mind me asking, where did you, ah, -- where did you go to school? 
R:  [LIPSMACK] I ended up getting my degree from [NOISE] Regent's College --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as I switched jobs -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I -- I was a [NOISE] part time student and --  
L:  Mhm.   
L:  -- I, ah, [NOISE] I would just go to the [NOISE] closest college [NOISE] generally to -- to my work [NOISE]. 
L:  Right, right.
R:  [NOISE] So, I ended up -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- with, ah [NOISE] lots of credits from the State University of New York and then -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a couple of colleges in New Jersey.
L:  Well, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that's interesting.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  Ah, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- So, you only saw the computer come into use really late towards the end of your education? 
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  Wow.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  Um, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- now, had -- I don't know, had you noticed that it was there and like, ah choose -- chosen not to use it or just -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- did it -- I mean I -- I guess I'm kinda interested as to how --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- the computer came into being your use and whatnot? 
R:  Ahah.  [NOISE] It was always available at the schools [NOISE] --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, ah, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- there wasn't too much emphasize placed on it.
L:  Really?
R:  -- but I always had access to the computer labs [NOISE] --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and, ah, my background -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- is in accounting [NOISE] and computers, so --
L:  Okay. 
R:  -- it's kinda interesting that, ah, I didn't use it too much.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] But ...  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I used it a lot for work and research for work --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but not so much for school.
L:  Wow.
R:  And it could also be with the speed of the internet connections.  At this place --
L:  Yeah, it has --
R:  -- I'm -- I'm spoilt --
L:  -- changed quite a bit.  Yeah absolutely, absolutely.  Mhm.  Do you use, ah, the computer for personal use at home now, or? 
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And, ah, I also, ah, teach computer classes -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to preschoolers. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  Ahah and, ah, I bought a franchise and they teach computers -- they specialize in ages two through six --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't really believe in -- two year olds are -- are much too young in my opinion --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know, three is questionable, but I think four is good -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- because in the school systems here now [NOISE] they -- they start using computers in kindergarten --
L:  At such a young age, absolutely.   
R:  Yeah, you know -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the teachers have to spend so much time you know, just -- just getting the children to learn how to use the mouse [NOISE] and --  
L:  Right.   
R:  -- you know, especially some of the disadvantaged kids [NOISE] that -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- never got exposure to it --  
L:  [NOISE] Absolutely --
R:  -- they kinda get left behind [NOISE] the teacher just doesn't have enough time.
L:  Mhm.  I'm -- I'm curious, ah, how -- how have you seen the computers have impacted, you know, did you say you taught preschoolers or was it --
R:  Yes, mhm.
L:  Yeah, how has that impacted their learning in their education and whatnot? 
R:  Um, they -- they go to school more able to, um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they, ah, don't get caught up in, you know -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- how to -- how to turn on the computer --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- how to use a mouse, how to use the keyboard --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, they're better at taking turns.  I mean [NOISE] it's not just technology but just, ah, mm, sharing it [LAUGH] --  
L:  Oh, yeah?   
R:  -- with the other kids. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it -- it's a big thing and then on top of that there's all the, um, [LIPSMACK] where they have [NOISE] through, like, games [NOISE] for math -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and ABCs and --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all that [NOISE] I mean I won't let my daughter [NOISE] spend more than ten minutes on the computer [NOISE] per night --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [MN] I mean I feel really strongly that, you know, it needs to be more of an interactive thing. [NOISE] 
L:  Right.
R:  Um, if I'm sitting next to her [NOISE] it can be a half hour, but she can't spend more than ten minutes by herself [NOISE] -- 
L:  On the computer, even with those educational programs and whatnot you feel that --? 
R:  Yeah, yeah, I think it's just too, ah, [NOISE] you know, slightly better than watching TV but not much more. [MN] [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, interesting -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- interesting.  Yeah, um, some of the -- the research that I've done has shown that like -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- one of the main issues is that -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- whole interaction thing and -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- there have been studies that have shown that sitting in front of a television causes -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- kids really to -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- just space out and lose some of that -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- interaction -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and I'm wondering if, you know, computers are encouraging -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, distance learning -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- just having their kids -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- sit in front of the computer and supposedly learn.
R:  Right, right.
L:  So ...  So you only allow your, ah, daughter computer usage if it's educational, or do you allow her, like, leisure time on the computer at all, or? [NOISE]  
R:  It can be leisure -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and you know, it can be leisure if I'm sitting next to her too [NOISE] it doesn't have to be, ah, through learning your -- your numbers or whatever --  
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- just so there is some interaction, some talking --  
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, going on and, ah, [NOISE] it's the same thing with TV.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] I try to limit it but I'm not quite as successful [NOISE] --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, ah, there --  
L:  I can imagine.   
R:  -- there again if I'm talking to her and, ah, we're talking about the show it's -- it's not such a [NOISE] [MN] um, like a dumb and down just [several inaudible words]-- 
L:  Right, there is mental simulation, I see.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, --
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] What is your major?
L:  I'm actually, ah, a general business pre law.
R:  Oh, wow. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, so, ah, we'll see -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- how that goes.
R:  [MN] 
L:  A lot the, ah, lot of the distance [NOISE] learning and electronic learning is, ah, talking about you know, people getting their business majors and their MBAs through online courses and things of that nature.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Hey, um, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so, would you say you prefer the traditional classroom model, you know, with the, ah, teachers up front and the whole social interaction, or I mean --  
R:  [LIPSMACK] A combination is okay --
