R:  Leah. 
L:  Hello, this is Patty, hi Leah.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH] Um, I guess we just talk about --
L:  Have you done this before?
R:  I haven't done this before, so -- have you?
L:  I did it once before, so I must be an expert by now.
R:  Okay, I'll tell you what, you take the lead then. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I'm actually very interested in computers in education, and think that they can provide substantial leverage.  Um, that's sort of, um, my take on it.  Like tec- books are a technology --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and people complained that they would take stuff away from the teacher, or, um, voice -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but computers are just another way of making technology more accessible.
R:  Um, yeah, I agree.  I think, I'm amazed at how much my -- I have a second grader, um, how much he already knows, and, you know, that he's had computers in the classroom ever since kindergarten, and used them, um, several times a week --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, maybe not every day, but several times a week.  So, ah, I -- I definitely think they can enhance, um, the education that children get, and actually I would like to see, you know, possibly some of the public school system, um, maybe using them a little more so that -- so that the children in those areas can, you know, somewhat be on the same, same level as --
L:  Mhm.  So your kids are in private school?
R:  No, no.
L:  No?
R:  He's in a public school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, but I have, you know visited some other private schools for various reasons, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I'm surprised that [LAUGH] they're even on a different level --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think that, you know, some of the children need to play catch up, um, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when they get into the real world as far as computers are concerned.  So ...
L:  So does he teach you stuff?
R:  Does he what?
L:  Do you still feel, like, you're ahead of him in computers, or has he, um, --
R:  Oh, yeah.  I still feel like I am.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, we kind of limit the computer use at home for him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but for, for quality -- you know, CD, for, you know, educational CDs or things like that, I'm not saying, like, internet, [LAUGH] you know, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't think they should be surfing the internet at school, but I think a lot of the CDs help them, and I just think that the children now are -- they need things so fast anyway, because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of TV and the video games and all that they play with, I think, I think the -- some of the old style education doesn't work with them anymore.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I think a computer's sometimes the only way to get through. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  I, I think one of the problems is that a lot of the people that are attracted to teaching, especially at the low pay scale offered by our grade schools --
R:  Mhm, mhm. 
L:  -- are people who are high touch kind of people who are a little bit insecure themselves, the teachers, with, um, the technology.  Because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they went into teaching because they wanted to deal with human beings, not because they wanted to deal with machines.  They could get a lot more money if they went [LAUGH] into something dealing with --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- somewhere else.
R:  That's true.  Ah, I never really thought of it like that either. [LAUGH] Um, but yeah, that -- that is true.  Um, and I can only relate to that because I'm thinking of being a teacher myself --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, um, and one of my reasons was, well, I like to, you know, get from behind the desk and talk to people more, and interact with -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with other people more.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I definitely agree with that point.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I think that computers are not ever going to replace what a human being can do -- [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  -- with another human being.  But they can hopefully take away the stuff that humans are less good at --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and leverage them more so that they can give more focused to individual contact, you know, so kids -- you know, there's a lot of things that kids need to learn that is sort of drill like.  And if you can put it on a computer so the drills are coming along faster and more tuned to what that kid really needs to study --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- then the teacher can focus more on being the human being.
R:  Right.  Right, exactly.  Um, gee. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, --
L:  So how are you going to go about becoming a teacher?  Is this just something that occurred to you recently?
R:  Um, pretty -- yeah, actually.  I've been thinking of it off and on, and I've actually gone back and forth between being teacher and being a nurse, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the teaching, ah, road is gonna be a little easier, because I already have my degree in English --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'm an editor right now, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's just a matter of going back and getting the teacher -- teaching certificate.  Um, and I, I basically just thought of it because my son's on spring break right now, and I thought, gee, if I was a teacher I'd be, you know, home with him --
L:  On spring break too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] -- but, um, I've been, I've been here in the office, um, doing this for ten years, so I'm just ready for, you know, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like I said, to be out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with the -- and I don't necessarily know if I'd want to, um, be with, you know, younger children or adults or, um, you know, or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, or what kind -- not necessarily an English teacher, maybe a English as a second language teacher --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or a foreign language teacher, so.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I got a lot to think about. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I got a lot to think about.
L:  That's true.  There's a program called Teach for America that, um, allows you to teach a lot quicker than -- I think you start teaching, um, or being a teacher aide while you're taking classes and --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- it's supposed to be a quick route to -- they, they place you, I think, in schools that are -- have trouble finding teachers, the disadvantaged schools --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and that can be both rewarding and stressful --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because those schools are pretty stressed, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the kids -- I'm doing volunteer work now at a, a school that's pretty stressed out, so I've seen some of the Teach for America teachers, and they're -- they come in with a lot of enthusiasm and the kids really need it, because the kids are -- you know, just as smart as the regular basic kids, but they have so much more socially and economically working against them --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- and then the school is so stressed because it has such little resources compared to other places that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the teachers get burnt out fighting up stream, and then eventually tend to move to school systems where their lives are not so stressful.
R:  Right.
L:  But it's too bad for the kids. 
R:  Right.  Oh, well that's a good program.  Thank you for telling me about that.  I, I did a volunteer teaching, um, teaching adults -- actually for computers. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  For adults that had never been, um, never logged on to a computer --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we got them set up with a free Hotmail account, and told them -- showed them how to surf the internet.  Um, it was, like, a five week course -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, for, like, an hour and a half.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and I re- I, I enjoyed that.  You know, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I did, I did volunteer for it just because I -- I wanted to kinda see, you know, how I would like it, and, um, although I know it's a lot different -- those people wanted to be there, they -- [LAUGH] the kids don't --
L:  Mhm, right.  Right.
R:  -- always want to be in the classroom.  But, um, I enjoyed it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so I'd like to explore it a little more.  So, thanks a lot. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I don't know what to -- too much I could say about the, um, um, I -- you know, again negatively [SIGH] I, I would, you know, like you said, I would hate to see -- I mean, and I don't think they ever would replace it, but you see more and more, you know, automation -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, with everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so I wouldn't be surprised at, you know, some kind of automated, you know, if they had to do test taking on the -- in the computer in the classrooms, or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, or anything like that --
L:  Mhm, the drills and the test taking I think are good ways of using the technology, because --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- that is stuff that teachers probably don't like so much anyway. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  And it's hard to be as individualized about it as you can be with a computer.
R:  Right.  Exactly.  So, um, and you know, when I, when I was teaching the -- teaching the adults, um, I kept trying to think back to when I was in school, and I can't even remember the internet when -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- I just graduated in the early nineties and I can't remember if we had the internet in the school or not, and, um, you know, now that's -- it was, like, on every, every computer in the -- because we actually taught in a middle, a middle school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, they let us use their space.  So, um, we were using school, actual school computers.  And, you know, it was on every desk top, and, and, um, I just wondered, like, how -- how much of the -- the classroom time are these [LAUGH] kids surfing the net, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and what kind of blocks do they have there.  Um, but a lot of the kids, like I said again it's a public school, may not have access --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- at home --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- may not have a computer at home -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, um, and again I think they're gonna -- they need to learn about it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they need to, you know, before they get into the real world and, and, you know, people are talking about this and that --
L:  Mhm, mhm. 
R:  -- and they don't have a clue because, um, there's a gap there.  So.  Um, I don't know --
L:  Well, have you
