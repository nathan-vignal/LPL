R:  Hello?
L:  Hey, how are you?
R:  Hi, good.  Hi, I'm Ray.
L:  I'm Patrice.
R:  Hi, Patrice, how are you?
L:  I'm okay, how are you doing?
R:  Oh, so far so good.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Just, ah, got back from, ah, a little trip to see friends in Vegas, so I'm not doing too bad.
L:  Oh -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's -- you're doing pretty sweet then --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you just got back from Vegas, you're fine.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  And they want to know --
R:  So it's just --
L:  -- about computers in education, and you're like, no, I just want to talk about, you know, poker.
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
L:  Poker and hos and stuff. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's like -- they're like family, so it's not really like going to Vegas, you know.
L:  Yeah, no --
R:  It's, ah, --
L:  -- I don't -- I've never been there, I don't know.  Yeah.
R:  The, ah, --
L:  Um, --
R:  -- so.
L:  -- so.
R:  Computers in education, um, I'm for it.  Um, I think, ah, I think it's one of those balancing tricks I think where, you know, it's such a new kind of process, it's going to take several years to kind of iron out kinks et cetera.  Um, but ah, I think the access to information, um, can only make it better.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah, it definitely makes a lot more, um, information available to a broader scope of people.
R:  Yeah.  And that --
L:  But, ah, --
R:  -- can only be a good thing.  Um, --
L:  Yeah, totally.
R:  The, um, -- what's amazing is like, and -- well, like, my buddy that I was visiting, he's got a four year old and an eight year old.  And, you know, they just walk circles around us with some of the stuff, you know.  They're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not so computer -- they're still getting into the computer thing, but you know, like we did, we pretty much just were like gaming all weekend, and, um, you know, they just -- the kids kick our butts. [LAUGH] You know, at this stuff.
L:  What do you mean, with like the video games, or like gaming --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- gaming like role playing gaming, kind of thing.
R:  We did -- well, we did a lot of D and D too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] D and D, are you kidding?
R:  No, no, seriously. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, my God, that's awesome.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  We were -- that was the thing, we were like, --
L:  I was in Las Vegas and I was playing D and D.  It's crazy.
R:  Exactly, I sit up all night there, yeah, eating pizza and drinking, you know, Doctor Pepper and playing D and D. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm doing stuff, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Killer.
R:  You know.  But, um, yeah, just playing like console games and stuff, they were like, you know, they kick our butts every time, you know.
L:  I don't like console games anymore, dude, I miss, like, Mario one, you know what I'm saying.
R:  Oh, right. [LAUGH]
L:  Like, I'm a child of the eighties, like this new high tech, like three D stuff, I'm not down.
R:  Oh, some of that stuff -- I got an X Box, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, I'm, I'm like on some of that, but even, even those games, the games that I like are not like, you know, I'm not into like, Ghost Recon or anything like that.
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  You know, I'm playing, like, you know --
L:  -- see like, you -- you're not of my tribe.
R:  -- platforms.  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  You are not my senorita, like I don't speak your language.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Look, I don't. But --
R:  But the, ah, you know just some -- playing these games -- I kind of got this theory about it how like, you know like on Star Trek, I mean, not to be too much of a geek, I don't watch [LAUGH] Star Trek all the time --
L:  You -- don't lie.
R:  -- but -- but, um, -- [LAUGH]
L:  You don't have to lie.  You're never gonna meet me.  You watch Star Trek.  You play Dungeons and Dragons -- [LAUGH]
R:  No, seriously, I admit to Dungeons and Dragons.  The Star Trek thing, no, no.  But just how, like, you know, you're like, how can these people know all this stuff?  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and because they got, you know, into it at an early age, and they had more -- access to more information at an early age, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's like, so they could build, you know, these systems and do this stuff by the time they were ten, you know.  It's, it's like this -- the common knowledge of, of humans, you know, progressing through these machines.  You know.
L:  Yeah, it kinda freaks me out though, you know what I mean?
R:  It, it does, um, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- in the sense of, in the sense of, like, you're losing a lot of stuff too, I guess.  Um, --
L:  Yeah, I don't know, I still really like books, do you know what I mean, and a lot of people are just like, "I'm just gonna read on the internet" and I'm like, "Right, right".
R:  No, no.  I am such a book orphanage.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  It's like I find things on the street all the time that I'm just like, you know, "This book has no home, I must take it home".
L:  Yeah, see, like, --
R:  Clean it up --
L:  -- I'm an English major, so I'm a nerd.  Like, I'll admit that.
R:  [LAUGH] That's a cool thing, though.  Where you going to school?
L:  Um, Ashland, Oregon.
R:  Oh, right on. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I lived in Portland for a little while.
L:  Oh, killer.
R:  So.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The, um, -- but yeah, that's -- that's -- but the dissemination of those things too, you know, you know, -- 
L:  Oh, vocab.  They're looking for that.  This is a linguistics survey.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Um, the, there was no -- I mean, especially like with the internet, just in the last few years, you know, the dissemination of information amongst, you know, every -- all classes has become just such a phenomenal thing, you know.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  It's like before we really relied on television, and now, you know, we have the computer stuff to really help us, you know, move information around in a way that's not packaged and controlled by people.
L:  Yeah, but it's like, it's like in a way it still is because of all the advertising and -- you know what I mean, like, [SIGH] like if people have internet access through AOL or through MSN then they're going to get, like, a barrage of, you know --
R:  The constant advertising.
L:  Yes.  Yeah.
R:  And as far as -- and I've kind of like a love hate thing about that.  It's like, I hate the advertising, but I've just kind of turned, you know, like tuned it out.  And it helps pay for a lot of that stuff that otherwise, you know, we wouldn't be able to pay for.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it's expensive enough as it is without like, imagine if, if there weren't any, you know, commercials in there or anything, you know, it would be twice as expensive and the people that are -- have, you know, lower income stuff that, you know, can't afford that regularly, you know.
L:  Which is everyone.  Which is me and which is probably you, you know.
R:  Which -- yeah, pretty much. [LAUGH]
L:  You know what I mean.
R:  I pay too much for access now.  It's crazy.
L:  Yeah, like if we're gonna talk about classes, I'm like, they're basically, like the class system in our country's totally messed up, and --
R:  Yeah, it's -- yeah.  It is.
L:  -- we're poor.  I'm poor.
R:  And how -- yeah.  And, and how would, you know, and, you know the -- I just work -- previously -- well, I got laid off last year, but I was working for this conservative think tank, and, um, -- which was really hard with my politics, you know [LAUGH] I just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- liked to keep my mouth quiet, and like, just do my job kinda stuff.  But they, you know, a lot of their stuff, they're proponents of like, getting rid of public school system and doing school vouchers.  You know, or --
L:  Well, most of the public schools -- 
R:  -- you know --
L:  -- like, are owned by Pepsi and Coca-Cola and --
R:  It's getting that way -- 
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- it seems like, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, getting -- they, they were talking about, like, getting rid of, like, the public library system.  And I was like, "Okay, hello, like, you remember eighteen fifty when there was no+, like, [LAUGH] you know.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  The only people who knew how to read were the people who, you know, like were rich.  The only people who knew, you know --
L:  Yeah, you remember, like, sixteen eleven, like the King James bible.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Just right back to that, you know.  And of course they're all with, like, silver spoons, so -- 
L:  Yeah.  They're so --
R:  You know, they don't think about those things, you know.  I grew up, you know, the poor black child, you know, [LAUGH] and had, ah --
L:  What?
R:  I was joking.  It's a reference to The Jerk, you know -- 
L:  Oh, sorry.
R:  -- the Steve Martin movie. [LAUGH] That's okay.
L:  You grew up as a small black child, and it's like, --
R:  "I grew up -- I grew up a poor black child".
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, the, ah, I mean, I did, I grew up, you know, just really poor, like in Texas, and we were on welfare, and, you know, and stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I've seen, like, the other side of that thing, you know.  And just, so you know, the only reason that I got, you know, access to a lot of the stuff I got was because of, you know, social programs.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, I wouldn't be able to do what I do now if it wasn't for those social programs being in place when I was a kid.  Most of the things they're trying to get rid of, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, but um, --
L:  That's freaky, then -- 
R:  -- again, off, off topic I guess, um, [LAUGH] dissemination of information through computer systems and computers in education, you know, I think really just helps, it helps that.  It's like social programs for the self motivated, I guess.  Or to help increase self motivation amongst, you know, kids, rather than just, you know, shoving stuff down their throats.
L:  Yeah, you got it.
R:  You know.  So, it's a good thing.
L:  I think it is too.  
R:  Yeah, really, you know.
L:  But really, what do I -- what do I know about computers or the internet or partying or anything like that anyway, right.
R:  [LAUGH] I guess just as much as any of us know.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know, you only have, you only have as much information, I guess, as you're interested in, so.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know.  That's, ah, -- but even with I believe, you know, like, with your thing too, because you're actually in school, you know I'm sure you do a lot of research on line.
L:  Oh, totally.  Like, I mean, I'll -- half the articles I find, but you don't have to, like, order things from the library any more, you can find full academic scholarly articles --
R:  Right.
L:  -- on line.  Which is sweet.
R:  Right.  And it's right there, since it's [inaudible], you don't have to deal with if somebody else has it check out, or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, this is in our archives and you can't take it out the building, or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.  It's, it's like, lost in their, like, filing system, or any of that kind of stuff.
L:  But I think the scary thing about that is, like, the more, more junk that's out there, the harder the things of actual quality --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- are going to be able to find, and, like, discerning whether --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's valid information or not is gonna be --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- more difficult to --
R:  Like proof of, of, ah, sources, or proof of, like, the factuality of the information.
L:  Yeah.  Like what's published.  Because, like, anything can be published on line, do you know what I mean.
R:  Right, yeah, and I'm always --
L:  So --
R:  -- fighting with my -- like, 'cause my mom's always sending me those things like, you know, gotta support the war kind of crap, you know.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And, you know, I'll send it back to her and I'm like, "Yo know, Mom, this is a hoax".
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know. [LAUGH] It's like, "Look at -- you know, look at this thing or look at this thing over here first
