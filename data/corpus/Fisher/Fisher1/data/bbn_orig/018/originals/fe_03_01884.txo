R:  Hello, my name is Dawn Hunt.
L:  Hi, I am Gwen Frazer.
R:  Hi Gwen, nice to meet you.  I have someone at my door so hold on just a moment please.
L:  Sure.
R:  Okay. [NOISE] Hi, yes, you know what I have a ten minute call.  Do you want to just look at the backyard, do you mind.  It will take just ten minutes.  [NOISE] Sorry about that, I don't want to be rude to the, the call thing.  How are you Gwen and where do you live? 
L:  Ah, I live in Dennyson[?] Texas -- 
R:  Oh, my gosh and --
L:  -- which is at Lake Tectoma[?].
R:  Well, guess where I live? 
L:  [MN] Well, I think you live in the Dallas area.
R:  Yes I do.  How did you know? 
L:  You have sent me some emails before about different focus groups and things like that.  In fact that has how I became part of this.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  Okay well -- that's neat --yeah, because I've seen stuff on the Internet too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well my name is Dawn.  We need to stay on the topic I guess.  What does family mean to you.
L:  Ah, I guess family means all of the loved ones and, ah, people that we hold dear.  I don't think it necessarily has to be, ah, especially by blood.  I think we sometimes can have [MN] good friends that we consider family.
R:  You know what, I agree with you because I -- my parents live in Arizona.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, my sister, I've never been close to but I have a couple of friends of mine that I've been friends with -- actually three girl friends, one twenty years, the other three fifteen years and I think of them as my sisters.
L:  Well I lost both of my parents very young so I --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- have not had a lot of family so I have had to surround myself with people who have become family to me and I think that's why I was so quick to, ah, say, you know, that it doesn't necessarily have to be blood.  I too have just one sister is all of the family that I have left, and she's ten years older than I am and we've never been close, whenever -- so -- 
R:  Now, do you -- are you married yourself with children.
L:  Yes, I am.  I, ah, have a daughter who is twenty seven and have been married for thirty one years to the same man, and, ah, -- 
R:  Oh, that's so sweet.  I've been married for almost ten years.
L:  Ten years, well we have been -- we have actually been together since I was fourteen, so [MN] -- 
R:  Oh, my goodness so just last year. No, I'm just kidding, anyway. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, you know, he -- and actually his family seems as much a family [NOISE] to me as mine does and I think probably because whenever we met I had just lost my father.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, ah, -- and then three years later [NOISE] we got married when I was seventeen and he was twenty one and, ah, and then my mother died the following year so I became very close to his parents and [MN] then later -- 
R:  You obviously have a good marriage too.
L:  Oh yeah, yeah.  And then later actually [MN] had a really good friend that I met later in life that I actually called Mom so that's why I think that sometimes friends can, ah, become substitute family for us, especially like in your instance where they're -- they're a long ways away and, [MN] um, you know, in my instance where you just don't have many.
R:  Exactly.  And I do believe -- I do wish things were like they were back in the seventies where all the moms stayed home -- 
L:  Oh, me too. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know? I know that sounds silly -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and maybe that -- I don't think this is really off topic but, I don't -- you know, families eat together -- I wish life was back like that because I grew up and had a good childhood and it was a very relaxed childhood.  Does that make sense? 
L:  Ahah.
R:  Like, you know, and I wish my life style was like that now.
L:  Well [MN] I was very lucky because I actually got pregnant while I was going to college.
R:  Oh.
L:  And we had never ever relied on my income to keep the household going. [MN] 
R:  Exactly.
L:  So whenever I got pregnant I was able to stay home and I did not work fulltime until my daughter was sixteen years old.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  So I am a big [MN] proponent of the same thing.  In fact I think that, you know, as far as families go I think families would be in much better shape -- I- I've often said that I think we should legislate [MN] that new mothers have to stay home until the children are three. [NOISE]
R:  Huh.
L:  If there was a law that, ah, says that they had to stay at home and could not work but would be funded, you know.
R:  Oh, boy, that would be hard but you know what I think it is people live -- and I will be honest with you, my husband -- and I'm being straightforward with you, he makes twenty five thousand a year.  We cannot live off that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I work from home --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but at least I am home, I am there for my daughter.  Like right now if my daughter says, "Mom, I want you to hold me", she's four, "Mom I want you to spend time with me" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I can be there for her.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I can -- which is great.  But, and you know I'm always there for her.  But I will be honest, I would rather not anything and just -- just take care of her. [NOISE] My husband would like to have another child and it's not that I'm not open to it but I'm thirty eight, I really don't want to have another one because basically I couldn't do everything that I'm doing now and I would ba- -- my husband would have to basically have two jobs because even -- you can live on a budget --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you can live frugally and there's things you can give up because we all live within our means.
L:  Right.
R:  Well, hopefully.  Like, we don't have debt or anything but I think that there's only so much you can live off, does that make sense? 
L:  Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
R:  I mean, you know, see my Dad was a truck driver -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and my Dad was a union man and he always made good income so Mom could stay home.  I mean I agree, I think there is a lot of women that could stay home but their lifestyles in the situation where they can't -- you see, jobs aren't secure.  Like years ago all of our neighbors they had the same job for like twenty years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Nowadays you don't have job security.
L:  No. [MN] But I think people --
R:  And people don't prepare.
L:  Yeah, but -- I think, you know, we could have had a whole lot more than we had when our daughter was little if I had chosen to work. [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But we'd made the decision and I think that's the operative word in families is you have to make a decision -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- that the children come first and my career in fact recent --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- well not recently, in the last ten years whenever I have interviewed for jobs, I even had men to say to me, you know, "Do you regret, you know, not starting a career younger?" and I said, "No, I've got the rest of my life to work".  You know, my family was what was important. You know, -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I was there for everything.
R:  And, it too, -- it just -- I think you have to put everything into -- let's just put it this way.  I think it's best if Mom stays home if you can afford it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and if you can make the sacrifice.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean in some situations maybe some people can't.  Like say for example the woman is a professional and she makes money.  What do you think about Dad staying home --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- like say he if he was -- 
L:  I have no problem.  I just think a parent, [LAUGH] you know, a parent, I don't care if it is male or female, that doesn't make me any different --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think that whoever is the parent should take care of the child, it should not be with someone who has nothing vested in that child's best interests.  I mean -- [inaudible] let's face it, day care workers make minimum wage.  They don't care what's going on.
R:  Yeah.  They don't make much money.
L:  No, and you know, they're there to put in their time and go home, I mean, I'm not -- 
R:  Well, some of them care because I worked at a day care and I really cared about those kids.
L:  [MN]
R:  I mean I didn't even like going on vacation because I didn't want anybody else to take care of them.
L:  Well, but I think that -- -- I think that's more of the norm. I don't -- you know, I -- you know, there -- there are well run day care centres, I'm not going to say they're not.  But in my -- but in my opinion there isn't anything that takes -- 
R:  That compares to Mommy. 
L:  -- right, that takes the place.  In fact my own daughter, you know, plans to have children at some point and I have always told her, you know, "If -- if push comes to shove I will take care of the baby the first year, you know, if you can't stay home".  
R:  Well, not that that's --
L:  I mean, it's that important to me.
R:  Well, not that that's not great, that you want to do that and I'm not saying that your daughter would do this.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But some people take advantage of their parent.
L:  Oh, certainly.
R:  I'm not saying your child would do that.
L:  Oh, no.  Mm, mm, no. She knows, you know, how -- how [LAUGH] -- how deeply I feel about this, and I just -- you know, -- 
R:  Well now, are you working a fulltime job now? 
L:  Yes I do.  I actually office out of my home. Ah, I --
R:  Oh, you do? 
L:  Yeah, I manage a large group of people and so my office is in my home so, um, you know, I do have some flexibility there.  I would not be able to work, I would not work at all if I was to take care of my daughter's child, you know, I would just quit, you know, and take -- or take leave, you know, take a family and -- 
R:  Hopefully she will be able to quit and stay home herself.
L:  [MN] Exactly and -- and I think that she feels it's important enough too having been raised by a stay at home Mom.  I think that's the difference too in families that I see today is that the girls that are my -- the women not girls, but the women that are my daughter's age that are having the children now, a lot of them did not have a stay at home Mom so they don't see the value in it.  It's really people who are my age that are in their forties who had the advantage of having a stay at home Mom, you know. 
R:  Mhm.  My mom -- my mom was a stay at home mom and I -- I had a very nice lifestyle [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Do you want me to hand them to you? Just say please Caroline, and Mom will hand them to you but use your manners. Okay. 
L:  How old is Caroline? 
R:  She's four.  Here you go, Caroline, there you go.
L:  Oh, that's such a sweety. 
R:  She's a cutie pie.  She's so cu- -- she's a sweet little girl.
L:  Well, you know, I -- it's just that families are so important and it scares me to death to think that the families that are -- that have young children, I mean the norm is not you, where, you know, where the Mom or the Dad is staying home taking care of the children [MN] and I keep looking at these kids that, you know, are being shuttled to day care every day that these are going to be our leaders of tomorrow and, you know, their values, and -- and, I mean, you know, let's face it, the day care has the child more than the parents have the child.
R:  You know what, you're right -- you're right. I think a balance is good, like you know, like a mother stay out or [inaudible] and part time -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- that wouldn't be bad, you know?
L:  Oh, no. I mean, I'm not saying that the child has been to sewn to the mom's hip, I mean, even --
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  -- you know, even once Penny was old enough to --
R:  -- but I don't agree with the seven to six thirty
