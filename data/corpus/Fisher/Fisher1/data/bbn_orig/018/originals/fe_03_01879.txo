L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Zoe.
R:  Zoe.
L:  Yes.
R:  My name is Jack.
L:  Hi, how are you? 
R:  Okay, Zoe.
L:  So, what does the word "family" mean to you? 
R:  Oh, I have mixed feelings about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What's it mean to you? 
L:  Um, well, I -- I tend to believe that a family is a group of people who, um, you know, call themselves that, that it can be pretty much self defined, that it's a group of people who live and live together usually but not always and that, um, you know,  feel very -- very tied to each other, whether it's parents and children or siblings or adopted family members, I think it's pretty -- it can be pretty open in my opinion.  My experience is it has been pretty, you know, sort of "normal" family but, um, I -- I feel like, you know, it can be open, open to what -- to what works for -- for folks in the world.  What do you think? 
R:  Ah, family is ties to certain people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Basically.
L:  What kind of people do you think?  Like you say certain --
R:  It would be like your mother or father.
L:  Ahah.
R:  Or, um, what and -- and relatives of them.
L:  Ahah.
R:  Grandparents, ah, uncles and, ah, in laws.
L:  Ahah.
R:  That's all family.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, so I think ... 
L:  Mhm.  What about, um, -- what do you think about families who adopt children, do you think that those children, that their family is their adopted family or their original birth family? 
R:  I think it's their adopted family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because -- 
L:  Why do you think that? 
R:  -- they're the ones they're living with.
L:  Yeah, so families like --
R:  Whereas they got their genes and everything from their original mother and father.
L:  Right.  So in that case it's like ha- --
R:  And then when they find those roots sometimes they find out what makes 'em tick.
L:  Right.
R:  And they should be able to do that at some time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's the way you feel about 'em? 
L:  Well, sometimes I wonder 'cause there's certain -- you know, certain adoptions happen because the mother is in some kind of danger or whatever and it's not always, um, you know, it's not always safe for -- for the mother to be able to make herself known to the children.  If I were adopted I would absolutely want to be able to find out, um, you know, just the basic information, if not be able to meet my birth parents but just at least know, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what was going on in their lives, um, and I think in an ideal world everyone will be able to find out.
R:  Well, they're passing laws to make it easier.
L:  Mhm.
R:  My wife does, um, adopted birth -- birth mother and father searches.
L:  Oh, she does? 
R:  She does that on the side as a hobby.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And if anybody ever gets a hold of her she can find 'em for 'em and she does that for nothing.
L:  Wow.
R:  But not too many people would get a hold of her.
L:  Right.
R:  And when they do they don't want to do the things they are supposed to do to find them.
L:  What -- what -- like what? 
R:  Well, they have to find their birth certificates.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Find different things that only they can do.  She can't look up their birth certificates. 
L:  Right, right, right.  So that takes a lot of work on that person's part, they can't just hand off the job to somebody else?
R:  What?
L:  They can't just hand off that job to somebody else.
R:  Right, they have to do some of the work.
L:  Right.
R:  But she can find the names of the people and all.
L:  Right.
R:  And pretty well locate who the mother is and who the father is.
L:  Ahah.
R:  Or at least who the mother is.
L:  Ahah.
R:  And, ah, if they want to contact 'em they can.
L:  Right.
R:  She can't put 'em in touch with them, they have to call themselves.
L:  Right, so she can get the -- get the information for them. 
R:  Yeah, and if they don't want to call, well, at least they know who it is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If they want to call them.
L:  Right.
R:  She found the birth mother of a friend of ours who was curious about it one day.
L:  Ahah.
R:  And, ah, never has gotten the nerve up in three years to get in touch with her.
L:  Right, so people just want the information but they don't -- they don't necessarily want to find out.
R:  They don't want to know.
L:  Yeah, that's true, that would be scary, can you imagine.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Never knowing and then how much it would change your concept of like who you are and -- and all that kind of stuff.
R:  What's you're, ah, -- what type of person they are and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and their history and stuff.
L:  Right, that's right.
R:  Whether they are college graduates or -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Anything.
L:  Yeah, yep.  I guess a lot of times when adopted people are, you know, doing really well in their lives they don't necessarily want to know if -- if they've overcome some kind of -- 
R:  Handicap.
L:  -- yeah, handicap that their family has, you know, their birth parents had that, you know, they don't even know about.
R:  That's right.
L:  Yeah.  Yep.
R:  [MN] 
L:  What -- what do you think about, um, lesbian and gay families? 
R:  I don't believe in them.
L:  Uh-huh.  So, you don't believe that they should be married or they should have children or -- 
R:  I don't think they should be married or have children.
L:  Mhm.  Why is that? 
R:  Why is that?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because, ah, it's not a natural thing.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  How can two men have a child.
L:  Well, they obviously can't but they could adopt.
R:  How can two women have a child.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And what kind of mo- moral atmosphere would they be living in.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Would they be prone to be gay too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Maybe that isn't their natural instinct even.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Maybe it will be pushed on them.
L:  Maybe, yeah.  I think some people would argue that lots of people whose natural insti- instincts are to be gay or lesbian have, you know, heterosexuality pushed on them because of the way the society works.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So it could -- it could work either way I suppose, yeah.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, well I --
R:  I have to --
L:  What's that? 
R:  That's probably part of upbringing I guess.
L:  Mhm, it can be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was a -- I taught preschool for a while and, ah -- 
R:  A school teacher? 
L:  I -- I'm -- I'm an art teacher right now.
R:  Oh, you're an art teacher.
L:  Mhm.  But for -- for a while I was teaching preschool.
R:  Preschool, yeah.
L:  Yeah, and, um, the school that I was teaching at had a couple of children whose families, um, who -- actually both -- in both cases the child was the, um, daughter of a woman who had a woman partner.
R:  Oh.
L:  So these -- these children had two moms essentially.
R:  Oh.
L:  And in both cases the father was a donor.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you know, their -- their -- the -- the mother carried the child and then the other mother was the partner.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they were a very loving family, I was really impressed to see how well they, um, they worked and, ah, and -- and that both -- both families were very -- very -- worked very hard to have their children have, you know, male men role models in their lives, you know, there wasn't a father in the family that they would -- 
R:  That's pretty hard to do without a father in the family.
L:  What's that?
R:  That's pretty hard to do without a father.
L:  Well, they would make sure that they would have, you know,  the fr- -- the male friends of -- of the mothers would, you know, come over and hang out and do things with the family, um, so that there would, you know, that their daughters would -- 
R:  Men like us.
L:  -- have -- have, you know, have men around in their lives -- 
R:  Sponsors, what do they call them? 
L:  -- even though there wasn't a father.  What's that? 
R:  What do they call 'em, ah, sponsors or what do they call people that mo- -- ah, role models for children, they teach them with their homework and stuff.
L:  Um, um, um, mentors.
R:  Mentors, yeah. 
L:  Yeah, yeah. 
R:  There's mentors and they help too.
L:  That's true, that's true, yeah.  There's a lot -- I mean there's a lot of resources out there for families who don't -- you know, I mean even single mothers, you know, if a father has passed away or through the divorce or whatever the situation is or if they were never married, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, that's -- that's an issue even if -- you know, even if you don't agree with, um, you know, lesbians, couples being parents, that you -- you know, even if a single mother has a child you still have to think about having those positive influences in a child's life so ... 
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Are you close with your family? 
R:  Um, I recently went through a kidney problem. 
L:  Oh goodness. 
R:  Kidney failure.
L:  Ahah.
R:  And I learned a lot about my birth family --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- from that.  There's -- I have -- there was nine children in our family.
L:  Wow, yeah.
R:  And two mothers -- a mother and a father.
L:  Ahah.
R:  And an uncle and all kinds of children.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And not one person was willing to even consider giving me a kidney.
L:  Oh my goodness, wow.
R:  And I have fallen out from them.
L:  Yeah, that would do it I guess.
R:  That really, ah, showed me their interest in me.
L:  That's right.
R:  But my wife gave me a kidney.
L:  Oh that's --
