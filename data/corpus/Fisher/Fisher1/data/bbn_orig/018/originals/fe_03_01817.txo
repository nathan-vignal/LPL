R:  Hi.  My name --
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  My name is Deena.  I'm calling from Florida.
L:  Hi, Deena.  I'm Lesley and I'm in Indiana.
R:  Hi.  How are you?
L:  Oh, pretty good.  It's a nice sunny day here.
R:  Same here. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I -- I bet it is. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It's always sunny here. [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's true. [LAUGH] Uh, --
R:  Okay, so what do you think of computers and education? [LAUGH]
L:  Um, well, uh, I would say that I would think they can definitely be a good thing.  I think they can overdo it.  I really wouldn't want my kids, you know, sitting in front of the computer for hours and hours and hours at a time, but I guess if they're going to -- [LAUGH] it depends on what the kids are going to do anyway.  If they are going to be doing something else, if they're doing something educational in front of the computer, that's probably better than not.
R:  Well, my -- I have -- I have two kids and my seven year old has computer lab at school but that's purely educational, um, they -- for reading a story or doing a maths game and at home they have ga- -- they have games but they don't have any -- they don't have anything violent, everything basically is educational in -- in one form or another.  I -- I mean I think it's hysterical that my seven year old calls it keyboarding.  He doesn't even --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- call it -- he doesn't even call it typing.  I mean, I barely made it out of high school typing and -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- he's got computer lab in first grade.
L:  Oh, boy.  Wow! 
R:  So, it's -- it's a -- it's a sign -- it's a sign of the times.  I mean, I just hope it doesn't -- like you have liquid crystal display clocks that replaced real clocks, so you can't learn how to tell time.  I -- I don't think that compu- -- 
L:  Oh, that's true.  Hm.
R:  -- I don't think computers can replace teachers, but there's -- there's nothing like seeing your child being able to concentrate for that long on a goal oriented task, so I -- I think there's a place for them in education.
L:  Yeah.  Um, I -- I, actually I home school, so education would be up my alley. [LAUGH]
R:  Ahah.
L:  But, um, um, my main complaint with a lot of the, uh, computer -- now, I'm sure, like, when they're doing computer labs at school they probably have very specific things they do -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- but a lot of the educational, um, games, my only complaint with them is that they're very slow, so out of their time they spend doing it they don't get as much as they could just because it's so slow.  I did find there's a, um, a really good maths game called Quarter Mile Maths, um, and it's, uh, -- the whole point of it is to be quick, it's like a race, i- it makes your horse or a car, if you choose, kind of race by how quick you answer the maths problems and it's really good, um, so that I would definitely recommend to anybody, um, especially if they want to, you know, kind of review their maths and have fun and that type of thing.  Uh, [MN] we even play it, the adults, a little bit, so, um, the only thing -- 
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  Go ahead.
R:  No, no, go ahead.
L:  Um, I know, like, with home schooling there are some, uh, on line programs you can do and I'm sure I -- I just -- I hesitate a little because I'm not sure how much time they'll spend sitting in front of the computer, but a problem with us, too, with home schooling is, um, I do a lot of work on the computer so [MN] we need to get a second one for them to do anything, otherwise I'm hogging it more than they could even get a chance to do as much because -- 
R:  Um, how many kids do you home school?   
L:  Uh, well I have three, but one, she's just turning two in a week or two so she doesn't count a whole lot yet. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] But you said you have the one, just the one.
R:  I have -- I have a four year old son and I have a seven year old son, but my four year old's been at the computer since before he's two and -- 
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  He -- he -- he knows how to do America on line -- 
L:  Oh, boy. [LAUGH]
R:  He -- I mean he knows, he knows -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- he knows how to do everything.  The only thing is when they're done with the computer they insist on taking the CD out -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they're always getting their fingerprints on.  I think that's my biggest complaint about computers and education, is that they haven't devised a way to lock the hard drive -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- so that once you put the CD in, the child can't take it out until you're ready because I've had my computer broken and I've had CDs ruined ... 
L:  Yeah, I've had them, uh, where the two year old got a hold of them, got it out and cracked it. [LAUGH]
R:  Hold on one sec.
L:  Yeah, that wasn't too pleasant. [LAUGH]
R:  What, Sam?  What's what noise?  The kids are out in the back yard swimming and I'm on the phone.  Can you wait a minute?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You want to play a computer game?  Ha, ha, isn't that funny?  What do you want to play?  
L:  [LAUGH] Good timing. 
R:  Go -- go pick.  Is that -- is that funny?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Probably heard you talking about it.
R:  The construction one?  It's in -- it's in the kids' office that we call the play room, the kids' office.   
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Now, isn't that funny when they record this, "Mum, can I play a computer game?" [NOISE] but he's going to do road construction which is really cool because it teaches them all about construction and then it allows him to print out pictures that he can color in and it also has little movies inside that show what it does.  I mean, [MN] there's nothing that we have that's -- that's [MN] that's [MN] geared towards any violence or anything, I mean -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- thank God he doesn't know from, like, Game Boy or Play Station or anything.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, they don't know what that stuff is and that's just fine with me.
L:  [LAUGH] I don't blame you, yeah.   
R:  I mean, I'm -- 
L:  We found -- we had gotten a Play Station as a gift, but we, uh, definitely limit it to the -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- non violent kind of things, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  I mean, it's bad -- it's bad enough some of the stuff he watches on TV and I think that he's watching something that's good and then something comes out of his mouth and I say, "Where did you hear that?" and he -- I'm more concerned about, um, TV than I am about, uh, than I am about computers because computers at least I can take a look at the content and control it.  [NOISE] TV is a completely different thing, but I have to tell you off topic -- I mean I know we're supposed to be talking about this -- God bless you for home schooling.  I could last probably a week and then -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and then, like, I consider my -- my kid going to school like his job.  That's his office.  He gets up in the morning -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- he -- he takes his briefcase, he goes to work, because [MN] if I go into school and volunteer something I, like, upset his whole day -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so, that's -- that's his job.  The little one, I -- I -- I'm there every day doing something because I'm very involved in the PTA, but if -- if I had both of them at home, I think -- I don't know what would happen.  I think they would either lock me in a closet [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or -- or something.
L:  Well, some days you do feel like that, that's for sure. [LAUGH]
R:  My neighbor -- my neighbor's home schooling her kids this year and, uh, I don't think she's quite got the hang of it because she's got a really loosey goosey schedule -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and this is accord- -- this is according to the kids and it's fine with me, but one of her kids was held back in public school because she -- she was really having some learning difficulties and the other two are doing great because they're just -- they're smart, bright kids, but -- but the little one, you know, she really needs a lot of structure.  I mean, if you are going to home school you've got to be prepared to, you know, not say, "Oh, let's sleep in" or, "I have to do this or that" and the two older ones have -- I mean, they're older, they're, like, in fifth grade and eight grade, but the third grader, I -- I -- [MN] you know, they -- I -- in Florida at the end of the year they have to take some standardized test --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- to see where, you know, where they are in terms of the standards and the older kids are doing great with home schooling but the younger one, who had problems to begin with, uh, she's not doing so great. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- Mum's -- Mum's going to take some extra teaching lessons, I think.
L:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, [several inaudible words] hard to, uh, hard to keep them r- regulated there, especially if their [inaudible] not really their thing, they don't really like educational things, which if you're having a hard time with it, most people don't like things, [LAUGH] so -- 
R:  What -- what was -- what was factored into your decision to home school your kids?
L:  Um, well, religion would have one part of it, um, you know, that's definitely important to us and obviously the schools are meant to be non-religious [LAUGH], so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, unless of course you send them to a -- a school but we just didn't have any we were satisfied around us here, either, so we didn't feel like that was much of an option, but, um, I -- I like educational things, so, it- it's not hard for me to incorporate them into my life.
R:  I hope you don't think I'm a bad parent. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no, no, no, [LAUGH] no, no, ah, no, definitely not. [LAUGH] I have friends who their kids go to public schools or go it private schools or go wherever.  I have one who -- she keeps rotating.  She sends them to public and then she gets fed up with stuff and then she sends them to a private and then they moved so they couldn't there any more so then she home --
