L:  My name is Karen.
R:  Yeah. My name is Wayne. Hi, Karen.
L:  Hi, Wayne, how are you?
R:  Doing very well in Nashville, Tennessee.
L:  I'm in, ah, Nazareth, Pennsylvania.
R:  And, ah, I understand, the topic is, what does family mean?
L:  Yes.  
R:  Ah --
L:  Well, would you like me to start or would you like to start? 
R:  Oh, certainly, feel free.
L:  [LAUGH] well, um, I guess the most important thing about a family is that you all care for each other, and respect each other as much as possible, um, support each other is a big thing about being part of a family, um, I don't know, what else?  What would you like to say?
R:  Well, I happen to agree with all of those things only because, ah, it's the situation I find myself in. Um, my, ah, my brother and sister are not living where I do but in spite of that, um, we're still incredibly close, and we always have been, and I've always felt very fortunate that was the case. That --
L:  How far does your family live from you?
R:  Ah, roughly five hundred miles.  They live in Florida -- 
L:  Oh.
L:  --  where I used to live, and at one time they lived here.  But, ah, we still stay y- -- in very close contact both, ah, using mail, and, um, visiting each other, so --
L:  Oh, that's good --
R:  Yeah, and, um, --
L:  Well, I have a similar situation, my whole family still lives in New Jersey. It's not as far as yours but my whole family is in New Jersey and they're at least an hour to two hours away; my brother's in Florida, so from Nazareth, from Pennsylvania to Florida, that's --
R:  That's a pretty good hike.
L:  That's a fly, right -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's a flight, and that -- so I usually only see my brother once or twice a year, but we keep in contact with cell phones and e-mail is a great way to keep contact with, with your family, which is I think also important too because that's the only that you know what's going on with everybody.
R:  Exact with a- and if you happen to be fortunate enough to have a close family, you want to know those things.
L:  Right.
R:  I do.
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, um, I think it's an important thing, ah, I can recall once as a youngster giving my mother a little bit of grief because she didn't have more children --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and I can also recall her looking at me as if I really didn't know what I was talking about [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- 'cause it wasn't me having the babies --
L:  That's right.
R:  And it wasn't me that had the responsibility, the awesome responsibility, of raising them, but nevertheless, ah, um, it was just something that I felt at the time, and, and, ah -- just lucky to have the family I do.
L:  Right.  I agree.  I'm lucky also to have my, my extended family, which are my aunts, my uncles, my cousins; we try to get together as much as possible even when, say, my daughter receives communion this year, so it was never even a thought that I would invite as much of my family as I could -- 
R:  Of course.
L:  -- to come, and now -- the same thing, comes down to, everyone lives in New Jersey, so it's a travel for them to have to come, but it's, it's just so wonderful when they can all do it and we can all get together and have such a good time with each other even though we haven't seen each other as much as we would have liked to.
R:  Well, there's the, ah, cliche that absence makes the heart grow fonder --
L:  [LAUGH] That's right.
R:  -- and, ah, in the case of, ah, some families, I think that is the case, is that, you, you, ah, you put more, um, more emphasis on being together when you have those rare moments that you are together.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, say my family used to live here, but, for various reasons, both my sister and my brother, ah, moved back to Florida -- 
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- and, ah, um, I know it was a sad day when, when my brother left town.
L:  Right.
R:  -- and as I say, there are -- there are ways to stay in touch, if you permit distance to, um, disturb what is a good healthy relationship, ah, you've got a problem. [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.  Right. You, you can't use distance as an excuse --
R:  No, no --
L:  -- not to stay in contact with someone.   
R:  Exactly, not at all --
L:   Right, it's --
R:  -- because, 'cause there are too many ways to break down that, that geographic distance, and, ah, to stay in contact with people that you care about.
L:  Right.
R:  Now, um, ah, --
L:  Yeah, that's very important.
R:  Oh, well, I think it is, ah, and try to pursue, you know, make a conscious effort, to, to find out what's going on, even though I'm not there.
L:  Right.  And what everyone is up to.
R:  That's right, and, ah, last year, as I said to my sister, I said, we just, ah, became orphans --
L:  Oh. 
R:  -- because, ah, my father had died when we were all fairly young --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I was only seventeen, and then, when my mother died, of course, we had no parents, at that point we were technically orphans.
L:  [MN]
R:    And, ah, it's, it's strange feeling, knowing that, that what was the foundation of your family is no longer there --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, it left all of us feeling, a little bit, ah, disjointed and that's not to say that, that it hurt our relationship, but, but it did alter the relationship, because what was once the foundation of your family is gone.
L:  Right.
R:  So you, you sort of view family, I think, in a slightly different light once the -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- foundation --
L:  Right, when the foundation is no longer there.
R:  -- yeah, is no longer there.
L:  Right.  But it's -- but an important part about that is that you, you try to follow along in what they have done and keep it together as much as you can --
R:  Oh, exactly.
L:  -- like, I know that when, when my grandmother passed away a couple of years ago, and my father and my aunt and uncle have done the best that they can to make sure the family still gets together on holidays, keeps in contact and keeps in touch with each other as best as they can  even though like you said, the person possible for bringing it all together is no longer there.
R:  That's right, and, and you do, ah, continue the process on, ah, and, ah, --
L:  You do the best that you can.
R:  You know, in -- yeah, well, in my case, too, I'm -- I'm my mother's boy.
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  -- I have, ah, some of what I view as her very good qualities, but I also have some, ah, some qualities, that are, ah, not so good.
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I recognize, um, some of my mother --  
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- in the, the  somewhat less desirable aspects of things that I see in myself, but yeah, it was probably ten or fifteen years ago -- I, ah, wrote her a letter and, um, I didn't really thank her that much for, ah, the fact that there was a roof over my head, and the fact there was food on the table, I never knew what hunger was, um, I thanked her for teaching me to read -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because, as a youngster, that was emphasized, and it's been a lifelong gift that -- that was passed along and it still is, I'm still a fairly serious reader --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it's that that is -- that has been passed along, and, and, it continues to live even after the death of the head of the family, more or less, well, she was the head of the family.
L:  Right.
R:  Oldest living person, anyway.
L:  Right.  Yeah, it's, it's, it's never easy when, when you lose someone [inaudible] -- older or younger in a family.  It's just -- it's just hard to, to, to try to remember things that they instilled -- well, it's not hard to try and remember, it's important to remember.
R:  I think it's important, exactly -- 
L:  To think.
R:  -- exactly.
L:  Right, it's important to remember.
R:  -- and I thought it was important to say those things to, you know, to my mother, because I knew she wasn't going to live forever --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah, and, ah, she passed this, you know, along to her children, and, ah, it has made a difference in the quality of life, I think.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and it's, it's, it's just an important thing.  So family is, ah, is, ah --
L:  -- very, it's, it's very important.
R:  Yeah, it's just, ah, I don't know, I've always felt blessed, you know, very fortunate -- 
L:  Yeah, I have -- 
R:  -- to --
L:  -- too.  I have always felt that I've been really fortunate t- to be given who I have.  You know how they say that you can't pick your family?
R:  No, well, that's right. You don't have much choice.
L:  But I think that if, if, if I would have, if I would have been looking at the people that I have in my family, I probably would have picked them anyway --
R:  Oh, --
L:  Th- there's just -- 
R:  -- yeah, I would have, yeah --
L:  -- so many things.
R:  -- definitely, oh, -- 
L:  You know --
R:  -- yeah, for sure --
L:  -- there's just so many things that we like to do together and, you know, w-we can, like, we can come to see each other after not seeing each other for months, and still feel as comfortable as -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- if they just left the house yesterday.
R:  Right, ah, --
L:  And you know, it's like it- -- the separation is there, but it's not always there. That --
R:  Well, yeah, it's, it's geographic --
L:  Right.  And that's it.
R:  -- and, and if, if, if it's only limited to geography, then your family is psychologically with you.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I know that I played in a band with my brother, we're both, ah, musicians, and, ah, you know, when I do go down, ah, home, to visit my family, I at
