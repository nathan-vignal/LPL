L:  Hello?  This is David.
R:  Hello.  Hi, David, this is Laura.
L:  Hi, Laura.  What part of the country are you coming from?
R:  I'm, um, I'm in Philadelphia.
L:  Philadelphia.  Uh, I'm in Rawley.
R:  You're in Rawley.  Wow.
L:  Almost due south of you.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Yes.  So, com- -- 
L:  Our topic is -- 
R:  -- computers and how they -- 
L:  Education.
R:  And education --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- how they help or hinder.
L:  Or do they help and hinder.
R:  Are good things, are bad things.
L:  Yes, that's correct.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's what I understand.
R:  Yes.  Well, hm, -- 
L:  I think they do both.
R:  I -- I would be inclined to agree.  Um, -- 
L:  Like most things.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You can abuse it, it can be [several inaudible words] implemented.
R:  Mhm.  I -- I taught for a while and was interested in, um, -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in how -- how it worked with students just, you know, um, in terms of -- of, um, get com- -- get computers with kids with some kids and it, you know, engages them and -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- suddenly, you know, it's -- it's not passive and they are all involved but then it's -- it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- can be a huge distraction, it can be the only thing they learn, [LAUGH] nothing else at all. [LAUGH]
L:  That's true.  That's true.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and it's also -- it can be very good for, um, additional assignments or for self paced studies.
R:  For pa- -- self pacing?
L:  For self pacing.
R:  Mm.
L:  Whereas certain individ- -- certain students may have additional drills that need be done, that the rest of the class doesn't need to have.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  So they -- it -- it can be done so, you know, you can help enhance the concepts going on.
R:  Mhm.  I guess it -- it allows for a kind of infinite individualization as long as the computer knows what's going on with you and can kind of diagnose what you need.  I recall taking the -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the GREs on the computer.  Um, they switched all the formats over to computers a couple of years ago and -- and now the whole test kind of formats your version of it, you know, depending on how many you have gotten right so far, so no-one gets the same test.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's very much that story.
L:  Well, when I took it, it was all paper and pencil.
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH] I wish I had taken it then. [LAUGH]
L:  I have taken some other tests since then.
R:  Uh.
L:  They were on liners.  It's -- it's nothing like taking -- taking something on line and realizing that you're getting -- get instant rep- -- feedback as to what your score is.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I think especially with -- with literature, which is what I taught -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you just can't replace the, you know, kind of engagement of a person with a page and the ability to -- I mean especially to write notes and annotate and engage with the text in that way, which, um, -- 
L:  Well, that, especially within education, uh, [MN] there's something different about having to put a thought proc- -- having to think about your thought process and be able to expand that into the written word.  That's more --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- difficult to do on the [NOISE] com- -- on -- on the com- -- on the computer other than --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a word processor, of course.
R:  Yes.  I actually, now that I'm thinking of it, I wonder if computers actually -- because you can only respond to them in a ways they in a way, um, cue you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to respond to them and I wonder if it actually limits, um, what you can learn, um, you know, in -- in ways that are more natural.  I don't know, I guess natural is like the opposite of computer, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, [inaudible] once again it's [inaudible] how you have it programmed also -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because you can set up things like -- almost like the -- the artificial intelligence aspect, so that as you get more and more into it, it can [MN] learn as you're doing and also feed -- give you, as you select different kinds of alternatives [NOISE] -- 
R:  This is, like, almost like, choose your own adventure -- 
L:  -- go different paths that way.
R:  -- sort of like.
L:  But some of that has to be programmed in to begin with.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and also -- but it has -- has to be approached that way.  Also, the other thing, too, is that especially in the -- in the educational matters I have done some, some teaching -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but a computer doesn't necessarily know when you see a ch- -- see a child finally -- finally it hits -- hits them like a ton of bricks -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they're starting to catch the concept.
R:  Yeah.  And I guess you -- you never have kids that, that come home and remember -- they always remember that computer they -- they had in second grade [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and not, you know, the -- 
L:  And, but once they get to middle school they never remember anything happening in school.
R:  [LAUGH] You sound like you have kids.
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH].  Huh.   
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It -- it must be -- do -- do you -- do your kids have a lot of computer involvement in the classroom or did they in their education?
L:  [SIGH] Um, I don't know how much they had there.  We had -- all had computers at home, too.
R:  Aha.
L:  But I think that for the most part they did have computer -- at least several computers in their classroom which they would take time -- [MN] time during the day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  In a lot of s- -- in the school system down here they tend to have centers[?] -- 
R:  Ahah.
L:  So, at different parts of the day the children will be going -- using different assignments in a different part of the classroom, to split -- s- s- s- split it out.
R:  So it -- so they're all kind of doing different -- 
L:  Yes, that's correct.
R:  -- things.  Did -- did you feel pretty good about, um, like, the time taken for computer stuff with your kids?  Did you feel, like, it was a good use of -- of, like, class time or did it -- did it ever feel --
L:  Mm --
R:  -- you know, like they were kind of having endless computer whatever?
L:  No, I don't -- I don't prop- --
R:  I've always heard that.
L:  Like do they have endless computer?
R:  Or just kind of having too much unstructured computer time or that learning, you know, quote, computer was taking away from learning other things.
L:  They -- 
R:  Sounds like you never felt like that.
L:  Well, I hadn't really -- I hadn't really thought about that.  Some of that I think is just most of the time it's been more supplemental just getting used to the -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- doing something and to be able do it and some of the things they do, too, is that they may have accelerated reader tests -- 
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- that are on it for [several inaudible words] supplemental aspects of -- of the schooling.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So is that really computer time?  Yeah, it is on the computer but it's -- you're taking a test.
R:  Yeah.  It sounds like it's a lot, um, kind of based on how it's structured -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and I, yeah, I've -- I've been teaching in -- in the Philadelphia schools and you definitely have, you know, whole classrooms that just have, you know, tonnes of, you know, quote, computer time. 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- when I don't know what the kids are doing.  I think they are just kind of -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.  I- i- it should be a -- it should -- 
R:  It's so much how you use it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and it should be a part, an integrated part as to what the curriculum is actually doing.  Some aspects it's easier to use that for [inaudible] -- I have a scientific background -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that tends [NOISE] to lend itself a lot easier to it than pure literature.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's -- there obviously certain -- certain formats or certain components of literature -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- can lend itself very well to it. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But obviously in, like, help identification of different writing styles, but not necessarily the actual writing itself.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  I think especially in, um, -- I hear teachers complain, especially in the early grades, you know, that it's kind of all about how you use it, that they feel like they are being required to [MN] make sure kids get computer time and -- and because it's really important, I mean everything you end up doing has some connection to it and-- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like you were saying before, like you'd have to be comfortable with the -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah.  You have your --
R:  -- basic feel and, like, not being afraid it's going to blow up -- 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- which I certainly remember, you know, when I first started.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I was older and I thought they were going to blow up all the time [LAUGH] you hit the wrong key.
L:  Mhm.  Well, I have ve- -- I have had computers crashes -- have had them crash before on me -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but it's not because of what I did, but because of the software itself.
R:  Yeah.  It sounds like you also know -- you -- you know a bit about computers.  It sounds like your background.
L:  I've -- I've used them for years.
R:  Sounds like you -- you know some things about programming and networks and all of that.
L:  Yes.  I've done some -- I've done some of that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I try not to do that too extensively.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've been more of a user rather than a tech, a techy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Although I was a techy before -- before they really came around.
R:  Huh.
L:  But [inaudible] that's -- that's -- that's a different story.
R:  Right.  Yep.
L:  But not [inaudible] but, like, it's -- as you were talking before -- talking before, most things there's -- nothing is ever a panacea. [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Any kind of advances that come [several inaudible words] there's good parts of it and there's mis- -- and there's bad parts of it or misuses of it -- 
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I was going to say misuse of key. 
L:  -- and seen some things that if you -- if you don't use it properly you're not going to get the benefit that you -- you would want it to be -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- regardless of what it is.
R:  Yeah, or just poorly structured use or whatever, absolutely. 
L:  Yeah, that's -- well, that's -- that's all -- or that's all been misuse.
R:  Yeah, absolutely.
L:  You're not using your resources appropriately -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- or, like, you know, they're just sitting doing nothing.
R:  Yeah.  Which is really -- it's -- it's too bad if it isn't.  It's not helping anyone.  
L:  That's true.  That's true.  So, you're -- you're no longer teaching?
R:  No.  I -- I -- I write full time now for actu- -- 
L:  Okay.  What -- what are you -- what are you writing? 
R:  Well, I write -- actually I write for an educational institution.  I -- I write for Penn -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, the University of Pennsylvania -- 
L:  Yes. 
R:  -- just various external affairs sorts of things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- 
L:  Mm.  
R:  -- so I do use a computer all day but it's for -- 
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible]
R:  Somewhat +administrationary -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- less than educational [LAUGH] uses.
L:  Right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, I do some -- I do a -- a -- some con- consulting work and I do it just for communication purposes -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and sending, um, doc- -- planning documents and so forth and [MN] [inaudible] it's a great -- well, like, spreadsheets. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] You -- you can't do that -- you can't do that stuff paper and pencil.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  It would just -- it would just take far, far too long.
R:  Yeah.  You're definitely in the area where the -- the computer is [LAUGH] constantly saving your life, I'm sure --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- in all sorts of ways [LAUGH] where, yeah, I -- I do feel, um, I -- I do feel very balanced about it.  It's -- it's not, you know --
