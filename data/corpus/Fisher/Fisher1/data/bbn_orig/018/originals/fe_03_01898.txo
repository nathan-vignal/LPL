R:  Hi, my name is Kelly, from Philadelphia.  Hello?
L:  Hello, hello, sorry.  This is Kelly from, um, Los Angeles.
R:  Hi, how you doing today?
L:  Good, thank you.
R:  Okay.  And they say the topic of the day was family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And what it means to us.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH] I guess that's kinda easy.
L:  Yeah, have you done this before?
R:  Um, I have, two other times.
L:  Do you?  I, I've never done this before.
R:  Okay, well basically what they said was just to kinda, I guess we can chat on our feelings about family, and then we're just supposed to stick with the topic as much as possible.  Um, --
L:  Okay.
R:  And then at the end of the ten minutes, the machine, or some kind of thing like beeps, and then they'll give us a couple of second to say goodbye, and that's it.
L:  Okay.
R:  And then they let you leave feedback if there's anything you liked or disliked about the call, or, whatever.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, okay.  Um, do you have a family?
L:  Yes I do.
R:  I mean, do you have children, or a husband, or --
L:  Yes, I have, um, one daughter and one husband. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, good.  How old's your daughter?
L:  She's, uh, six and a half.
R:  Six and a half.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's nice.  And um, I have, um, I'm also married, and I have a five month old son and eleven year old daughter.  So, and my family means everything to me.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I think that's what, you know, everybody, I, I can't imagine life without my children, my husband, you know, I actually have some friends that tell me that they have no intention of having children and so on, and it kind of baffles me a little bit.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So I'm like, wow, you know, I mean --
L:  Yeah same here.
R:  I nev- --
L:  I don't understand.
R:  I known, like peop- --
L:  I don't know why anyone wouldn't want to start a family.
R:  Exactly, like I say, you know everybody has a career, you know I work, actually this year I've decided to take the rest of the year off until the baby's about a year, which I did not do with my other daughter, um, just to, kind of just to enjoy every moment with my baby, you know, seeing him grow this time, um, with my daughter I actually had gone to school and went into a new job, and so I missed, I felt like I missed a lot, although I know in society today you know, not everyone's so fortunate where they can stay home.
L:  Right.
R:  But, uh, you know it's been real nice.
L:  Yeah I, I stopped working, um, [LIPSMACK] working when my daughter was born.  And then I went back for a year when she was old enough to go to preschool.
R:  Okay.
L:  And then when she started kindergarten, I, I stopped working again.  It just got, you know, there was, it was hard to find someone to watch her after, and I didn't want to bring her to like a house, day care so --
R:  Right.  Right.  Now are you currently still at home?
L:  I'm at home now, yes.
R:  Oh, that's nice.  I hope that I'll be able to do this for at least a year.  And, I haven't decided, um, I'm a nurse, so I'm kind of lucky I have the ability to kind of, I guess do off shifts and things if I need to, because it is more, family in general is more important to me at this point than my career.  You know, I, I don't feel like I have to be there every day, although I, I think I'd kind of like to go back a little bit.
L:  Yeah, I, I, sometimes I'd like to go back, but I'm lucky enough right now, I don't have to.
R:  Right.
L:  And it's mostly just getting out, you know and talking to other people. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly, and that's what, you know, my husband and I say the same thing.  We're kind of in the situation now where I don't feel like I absolutely have to be working, um, which is great.  You know, and I have made, like, some changes in my lifestyle I'd say, you know of course you're a little more, you know, flimsy when what you spend and things like that when you are working and --
L:  Right.
R:  As opposed to not, but I feel the same way.  I mean, you know I, I feel like I should be raising my children, and, and it's also been good for my eleven year old, 'cause she's just getting at that age where, you know, she can get into sports and things like that.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, so it's kind of nice to be home and, and be there for her as well.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Although I don't think she'd mind as much if I was back at work  -- 
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Because I'm not, because I was working a day job anyway where most of the time I was at work I was, you know, she was in school.
L:  Right.
R:  So, um, but, do you have a large extended family too?  Do you and your husband come from large families, or ...
L:  Um, I do, my husband doesn't.  My hus- -- um, um, my side is, I have a brother and sister, and nieces and nephews.
R:  Now do you all live in the same general vicinity, are you all from this Los Angeles area?
L:  No, um, they're actually up north in the Bay area.
R:  Okay.
L:  And that's where I'm from, and then we moved out here.
R:  Okay.  Do you get to spend much time with the rest of your family?
L:  Um, actually we just got back from spending a week up there.
R:  Great.  That's nice.
L:  So yeah, about three, four times a year.  They either come down here or we go up there.  
R:  Very nice.  
L:  So ...
R:  Is it a long drive for you guys?
L:  No, it's about three hours.
R:  Okay.
L:  Well, it depends.  Three to, three to four or five, depending on traffic and all that.
R:  Okay.
L:  So it's, it's nice, we definitely make time, especially for the holidays.
R:  Right.
L:  We always, um, make a point of either going up there or, or everyone trucking down here.
R:  Yeah, and it's really nice to have that.  I know my, my mother's side of the family is very large, um, both my husband and I, we each, um, have one sibling, and our siblings are actually the same age, and I have a sister and he has a brother, but other than that, his family's pretty tiny, um, the family that he does have, um, are located in the area, but they're not very close to one another.
L:  Mm.
R:  And my mom's family on the other side, um, my father's family's fairly small, but my mom's family is like huge.
L:  Yeah, my mom's too.
R:  And there's, there's so many of us, that we have to wear like name tags when we go to things.  
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  'Cause you know, everybody's always bringing their new stuff or whoever along, and it's like, "Oh, my God I'll never remember all these names". 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, you know it's, I feel fortunate that I have that whenever a holiday comes and so on, and, and my husband's really been able to benefit from it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and you know, we bring his parents and his brother and stuff along for like Christmas and Thanksgiving and stuff now, just because they, they've got to really enjoy it because they never knew that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know they always had such a small, you know, kind of ah, not so large gathering when it came to holidays and things with the family and stuff.
L:  Right.  Same here.  My husband, they, he didn't have that.  And now he says he knows what family, you know, what it's about.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, where, the way it should be, that's what he says.
R:  Right.  Exactly.  That's what my husband always says he feels like.  You know he's like, "Wow, you've had this your whole life", and, he's like, "It's kind of like an eye opener for me 'cause we're so used to just doing our thing". 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he's like, "I didn't realize that it could be so neat".  You know, I'm the oldest of all of our, the children and cousins, um, on my mom's side, so, it, it seems like I'm pretty close to everybody because I've known them all, you know all along, and the ones that are close to age, to my own age, like we've been very close, where, you know, we're still friendly, and when it came time for our weddings and things, everyone went to one another's wedding, and you know, we call one another all the time, and so now he's also become close with them and their spouses and, he's like, "It's really neat", you know? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we kind of said the same, I mean I think as far as, as our own, um, ideas as of now since my daughter and son are so far apart in age, our home isn't huge, um to the point where we do not have an extra bedroom right now, so I don't, haven't decided if we're gonna have another child or not.  At this point, um, because we'd probably have to do a lot of arranging in the house to get my daughter into, like, you know, maybe refinish another room in the house, it's her room.  [SIGH] And so --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  But um, I think I'd even like to have one more.  I can't imagine my life without another baby, now that I have him, so ...
L:  Yeah, I am.  We were talking about us having another, but everyone says, "Hey don't wait too long".  But, I mean, what, did you guys plan to have your second child, or ...
R:  Yes, I'm actually, um, I'm actually thirty, and, ah, I had my daughter when I was eighteen, and she's actually, my husband is not her father, but she still has a relationship with her dad as well.  Um, but she's known my husband I guess since she was about four, so we had talked all along in the beginning, um, we've been married three years, and we had like a whole game plan as far as, you know, we had gone out for so many years before we got married, it was like, you know when we got married, we wanted to get the house and we kind of had a game plan, we knew we wanted a year or two to get ourselves settled in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and have our son.  Um, you know, it was like, okay that'll be the perfect timing for the baby.  And it actually worked out, like, to a t.  You know, we decided to start planning when we did, and we're very lucky to, to get pregnant fairly quickly.  Um, and, ah, you know so he was definitely planned, um, and things have worked great.  And our big dilemma now is like, you know, would we want to have another one in the next year or two?  Um, you know, I don't know that I'd want to have any, any sooner than, than that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  However, with my daughter and her age, like if we had a girl, we're gonna run into that issue of, you know, we can't put a baby in a room with her.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] Obviously.  And we're not gonna put the, a girl, I mean we could with him for a period of time. 
L:  Right.  
R:  But then it would be a whole issue, would we want to move into a larger home, or would we want to do some renovations with the home we're currently in, which we've only been in for three years?  We bought it when, right when we had gotten married.  So, uh, it's a little dilemma right now. [LAUGH] But, um, you know and I, and that's what people say to me, "Well, you know, you're thirty", and I'm like, "Well that's young".  You know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know, I wouldn't mind waiting a little longer --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- maybe five years, six years, you know.  Um, it doesn't scare me.  Age to me, you know  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- having children a little bit older, even up to my forties, would not scare me at all.  Um, I think I'd like to have them a little bit younger just 'cause I feel like I could probably enjoy them more you know and have more energy now than I would when I'm like fifty.  [LAUGH] So, um, ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah that's like what our thing is.  We only have a two bedroom, and, you know if we have another child that um, you know, what if it's a boy?  
R:  Right.  
L:  My daughter's [several inaudible words].  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  And that's what, you know, what we were saying.  Like, it can work out for a period of time and then that just becomes difficult.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, you know my husband's like, well people make do and, I'm like that's just our biggest thing, it's just such an age gap that it's like, whoa [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, thank God for my older --
