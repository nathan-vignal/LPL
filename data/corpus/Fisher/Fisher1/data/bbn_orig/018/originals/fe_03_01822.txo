L:  [NOISE] Mm, hi, are you there? 
R:  Hello, yes. [NOISE] 
L:  Hi, I'm Karen I'm in Huston, Texas.
R:  Hi, Karen, I'm Lesley, and I'm in Indiana.
L:  Hi.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.
R:  I just talked to someone in Florida, so now it's neat, I get to somebody in Texas [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] So, the question is do computers [MN] help or hinder education, is that basically --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- what you got? 
R:  Yeah, pretty much.
L:  You wanna start [LAUGH] this thing --  
R:  [LAUGH] sure.  Um, well, I was just talking, ah, to somebody else in, ah, the -- Florida and we had the same, ah, topic too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, [COUGH] we -- we both have younger children, I don't know if you have children or --  
L:  [NOISE] Yes, I have a four year old girl. [NOISE] 
R:  So, you have a younger one too.  I think most of us probably who are doing this stuff usually do. [LAUGH] [MN]  
L:  I also have a twenty year old boy [LAUGH] but --  
R:  Oh, you have one that's -- 
L:  -- [NOISE] Yeah -- 
R:  -- way out there too [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- yeah, those are my only two, but, yes.
R:  [LAUGH] That's neat.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]  
R:  Um, yeah, mine are ten, eight and then I've got -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- one straggler, but not that far -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- she's just turning two [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] [MN]  
R:  Um, well, that's what the other, ah, lady was saying her first grader has a computer lab --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- at school and that's really funny -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- because I didn't take it -- I don't even think they had it at high school, had it after high school.
L:  Ahah.
R:  And, ah, I -- I think most of it is probably pretty good.  I r- really wouldn't want my kids sitting for hours and hours and hours unless that is their thing they're going to be into and working with -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- but I guess it isn't really hurting anything, but ... 
L:  I agree, um, [MN] you know [MN] the question's not very specific, um, I think they're -- 
R:  No.
L:  -- [MN] like t- to me what age are we talking about how much time -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  Is spent on it and I agree about if you're gonna [MN] you know, something that's -- that's work related is definitely gonna be helpful when -- especially when they're in junior high or high school where, um, old enough to get more, ah, into it in -- in more depth [MN] -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- maybe learn some basic programming and, um, that sort of thing.  If they want to maybe it could be an elective type thing -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- ah, get a little head start on -- on college that way and, ah, and we're in also a head start on, you know -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- job skills -- 
R:  Yeah, because -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- definitely not against, ah, -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- computers, I spend a lot of time on them myself [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, me too -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- that's how I found --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- out about this study --
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Exactly --  
R:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, it's like do I -- I can't say they're too bad.  [MN] My biggest thing is a lot of the educational software isn't that educational -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- it is, but it -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- m- my main complaint -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I would say that it's kinda -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't know, it's kinda slow, like the amount -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, they could play it for an hour and I'm not sure they got an hour of learning or anything out of it [NOISE] 
L:  Yes, I know what you mean.  I -- I haven't had much experience with that yet but I've read a lot of other parents' comments on -- 
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- things that they've gotten for their children, particularly [NOISE] young [NOISE] children [NOISE] and I -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I've heard similar complaints [NOISE] that it's just not -- it's not really time well spent and also that the kids get bored with it so quickly and, um, --
R:  Um, ri- yeah, I mean if you have a real little one, I really -- I can't see they need to be on there for, you know, hours a day.  Like the older they get I think that probably makes more sense -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- providing they're doing something good. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, that's -- 
L:  Oh. [MN] -- 
R:  -- what I said, I do have this one software game called the Quarter Mile Math -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- and I really like it, it's, um, it's all about speed -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we home school too -- 
L:  Oh, you do?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have a good friend who does that and -- 
R:  A -- a lot of people -- the other lady, her neighbor does that, I said, "It's so funny now" -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I think twenty years ago it would've been really weird and now when you mention it it's like, "Oh, yeah, I know somebody who does that." [LAUGH]  
L:  Right, well, [MN] it probably is still considered pretty weird by a lot of people, but those people are ignorant, you know [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, [MN] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- not as weird. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  But they at least know somebody before -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they wouldn't have even -- it would've been, not just weird but they would've never even hardly heard of it now at least they -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- are familiar with -- 
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  -- it, it's not -- 
L:  -- I really -- 
R:  -- that strange. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I have great admiration for -- for people -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that do it too, so. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Um, -- 
R:  Um, -- 
L:  -- so, you --  
R:  Um, yeah --  
L:  -- get a chance -- 
R:  -- the Quarter Mile is great.
L:  Yeah, you get a chance [NOISE] to -- you're probably kinda familiar with a lot of those things since y- you [NOISE] -- you use it for education. [NOISE] 
R:  Right, yeah, um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, I get -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- catalogues and go -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- over -- 
L:  [NOISE] Mhm [NOISE] 
R:  -- tons of stuff -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- And that type -- some are geared towards home schooling and some are just -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- general education products that are open -- 
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  -- for a teacher, any kind of teachers or anybody for that matter.
L:  Oh, I was just thinking of specific things that -- that computers could be -- you know, there are some things that are -- that are more efficient on the computer and some [NOISE] things it [NOISE] doesn't matter so [NOISE] much, but, um, [NOISE] it seems like -- like letting the kids have access to things like, ah, online [LIPSMACK] ah, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- reference books.  Melissa get down --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- from there --
R:  Well, that -- 
L:  -- now.  Ah, encyclopedias things like that -- 
R:  -- I -- I would like to get a second one to hook up. 
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]  
R:  -- um, that could be more -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- monitored -- 
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- for the kids -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, yeah -- like, yeah, there is so many great things, like, you can find any kind of reference -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- materials are on the internet -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- there's lots of good stuff -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of course there's lots of garbage -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- too.
L:  Yes, well, [MN] one thing I really appreciate about the internet I mean I can hardly see how I did without it [NOISE] and I'm forty four, you know, th- they didn't have -- they didn't teach computer stuff when I was in school cause seventy seven was my graduation year -- 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah -- 
L:  -- but, I love -- 
R:  -- I graduated in eighty seven -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and I didn't -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- really have anything either, so. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah [NOISE] um, you can [NOISE] things so instantly and [NOISE] sometimes, [NOISE] you know [MN] you know [MN] I guess [NOISE] it has kinda made [NOISE] me lazier too [NOISE] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] because instead of looking up a word -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] and you're physically walking over to my [NOISE] book, you know, dictionary --  
R:  Right 
L:  -- [LAUGH] [NOISE] I'll just go to the [NOISE] Miriam Webster si- site or something and [LAUGH] look it up, you know -- 
R:  Dictionary dot com, I know. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] And --  
R:  Yeah
L:  -- um, [NOISE] well, I guess that's kinda getting off course, but, ah this probably is too, but any time I hear about like kinda alternative things being done in school, one thing always comes to mind is -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that's fine --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- as long as the other more basic things are really being taught cause I -- I really have a concern that the kids that are coming out of schools now are just less educated.  I mean I think the -- really the m- best educated people are the ones, you know, who are now in their seventies, you know, that --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] 
L:  -- who grew up.  My mother back then she said they even had to take Latin [NOISE] which, you know -- 
R:  Right 
L:  -- a lot of people think that's useless, but my mother's very, very good with the English language and she said that when you learn Latin that so much of English comes from that you [MN] -- it helps you, ah, understand what you see are suffix or prefix and you now what it means because you've studied Latin and, um, I'm not saying kids should go back to studying Latin, but [NOISE] my -- my point's more -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- ah, [NOISE] learning computer is fine, you know, use computers in ways that are -- that make [MN] make it more efficient -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, you know, just to be using computers -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- just because it's, you know, [MN] just for the heck of it, you know --
R:  [several inaudible words] that makes it good, yeah, ah, I agree that, um, -- 
L:  I mean teach them -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- teach them how to spell and how to write a sentence --
R:  Yeh [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know [MN] -- 
R:  Right, Spell check is great, but you better have some idea what you're -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- doing on your own. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's right.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's right, that -- that comes in useful and -- and, ah, I guess -- I can't criticize much about math because that was never my strong suit -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- but, um, um, well -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- well, one thing I -- 
R:  Mine neither -- 
L:  -- I do like about kids using computers is because -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- when the -- the emphasis on things like emailing and, you know, at least that's written communication [LAUGH] rather -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- than being always being on the phone, ah.
R:  Um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- Yeah, I don't have -- 
L:  -- anything that helps people write more, you know. [NOISE] 
R:  Um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- yep, there's lots of great opportunities -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that would just -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- never be there [NOISE].  The instant is just amazing -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- what you can -- you know, if your kid has a question [several inaudible words] what is that -- 
L:  Do it right away -- 
R:  -- let's go find out. [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.  
R:  And -- 
L:  -- it used to be when I was growing up my mom would, you know, either have to "I don't know and I don't have time to check" or, you know -- 
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- or we'd have to go to the library [NOISE] -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- and that's what I ca- it's just amazing to me how you don't have to go to the library constantly any more [NOISE] to -- to research things or to, um, I mean -- 
R:  [NOISE] Right, you have a whole massive -- 
L:  [NOISE]  
R:  Library in your -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- computer. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] And it's then a question --
R:  -- I still love the library, but ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, me too, but [NOISE]  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- then guess the question is -- and this is -- okay, this would be a good thing for them [NOISE] to teach kids I think [NOISE] would be how to judge the, ah, source, um [NOISE] you know, you're doing research --
R:  Oh, that's a good point. 
L:  Yeah, because anybody can write anything on the internet so, --
R:  Yes, that's true -- 
L:  -- like teach the kids the critical thinking -- 
R:  Yep.
L:  -- well, critical thinking they should teach it anyway, you know, to, um -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] so that when you read something y- you can kinda judge how, um, how valid it is, you know, partly based on maybe whose putting it out and what they're credentials are and -- like --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- in other words, teach them just not to take anything you read as gospel which -- 
R:  Right, how --  
L:  -- the same with reading -- 
R:  -- can you judge -- 
L:  -- newspapers or anything -- 
R:  -- this the right way -- 
R:  Yeah.   
R:  Um, -- 
L:  And that's one thing I think schools are not very good at and that's one -- I think with home schoolers can teach their kids more to -- to -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to think thems- you know, instead of -- 
R:  Yeah, they have tons of, ah, -- 
L:  -- of just getting information, that critical thinking. [COUGH]  
R:  -- they have tons of programs you can do -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for thinking that's pretty popular -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with the home schooling thing, um, I -- I just bought some at a convention -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- as a matter of fact, I was looking at --
