R:  Hello.
L:  Hi. 
R:  [MN]
L:  This is Cathy.
R:  My -- I'm Jennifer. [SIGH]
L:  Hi, Jennifer.
R:  [MN] This is --
L:  Have you --
R:  -- unusual, sorry, I've never done one of these things before.
L:  I haven't either. This is my first one.
R:  Okay, so we're both new to it then.
L:  Right.  So I'm assuming we just --
R:  Is this --
L:  -- talk to each other about what family means?
R:  I guess. [MN] [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay, and they'll tell us when the ten minutes is up.
R:  Okay.
L:  Oh, how funny. Ah, --
R:  Well, it's a convenient topic.  We're going to a family reunion tonight, so --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Well, we're leaving for one --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- so --
L:  Oh, those are fun.  I love 'em --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- my, um, the family I grew up in, my family never did, um, family reunions.
R:  My husband's grandmother is one of thirteen children, so it's actually like her brothers and sisters are all getting together, and I just had a baby a couple months ago. So --
L:  Oh, how cool. Yeah.
R:  -- they want to go play pass the baby.
L:  Yes, of course, yeah. Well, I've been married for fifteen years and my husband has a very large family. He has two sisters and five brothers, and then with all of their family -- so I get to go to a lot of family reunions, but I never grew up in that.
R:  Neither did I.
L:  [LAUGH]   So --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I love it. I -- is this your only child -- -- 
R:  [SIGH]  
L: -- -- do you just have --
R:  Yeah 
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- I just have a little girl who's a little over three months.
L:  Oh, my granddaughter just turned two months.
R:  Oh.
L:  I have two boys that are twenty one and twenty five -- and, so this is my first grandchild, and I'm loving it [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm?
L:  [LAUGH]  -- just loving it. I --
R:  That sounds a lot like my mom.  
L:  Mhm?
R:  We've got -- I lucked out. I have the first grandchild on my side and my husband's side, and the first great-grandchild on both sides.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah. Now this is the first grandchild on both sides, not the first great-grandchild but the first grandchild. So, she's getting spoilt!  Do you have a boy or a girl?
R:  I have a little girl.
L:  Oh, that's what -- Jodie and Haley had a little girl.
R:  I'll tell you what, though -- the little the girls get dangerous,  because you spend too much money on 'em, and --
L:  [LAUGH] That's like --
R:  'Cause everyone's like "Look at this dress.  She has to have it!" [MN]
L:  Exactly.  You can't pass it up. That's what my daughter-in-law said.  She said "She dresses better than I do!" [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yes.  My child is in, like, Gap, and Old Navy, and --
L:  [LAUGH] And Old Navy, yes [LAUGH]
R:  You know,  and I'm buying these clothes at the local Wal-Mart,  on the clearance rack. [LAUGH] But it's --
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly. But family -- believe me , they're only young once, and just enjoy it and -- mine grew so fast, and here I am a grandma already --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so -- I wouldn't change it for the world, though. I love it. I, um -- and with my job,  I work with clients to help them find jobs --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so it's kind of,  I work when I want to work, so, like, yesterday I took the whole day off and babysat, because I could --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that's wonderful.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  You know, if I was working a forty hour nine to five or something,  I wouldn't be able to spend that time with her, which I --
R:  And I do -- I say I'm a stay at home mom, but it's more like a work at home mom --
L:  Right.
R:  -- kind of thing --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- 'cause we do -- I do a lot of the mystery shopping.
L:  Oh, I love that.
R:  And that's -- that's actually how I got into this.
L:  Is it?
R:  Yeah. 'Cause I was looking on one of my message boards, and, you know, it said do this,  so I got into it, and, um -- but anyway,  like, today, I took -- I went and did a restaurant, so I took my daughter to lunch,  and, you know, I had lunch for free, and 
L:  And you get paid for it.
R:  Yeah, I guess --
L:  Yeah! [LAUGH] Mhm?
R:  My favorite ones, though, are the Steak 'n Shakes, because that one, [MN] they give you up to twenty dollars back.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  See --
R:  Oh.
L:  I don't have any of those in this area, so I've only got to do, like, Sonic and then  I've done a few forums. So you were telephoned? I don't get to do enough of those, you know, I guess I just don't live in a big enough area.
R:  And see, I haven't -- we have Sonics here but I haven't gotten to do one.
L:  Mhm?
R:  But we do lots of pho- -- uh, the cell phones.
L:  Do you?
R:  Yeah, I mean, that wasn't too bad.  Then I -- what's cool, too, they, ah, oh, one company, if they can't use me because of the rotation thing,  they'll call up and they'll ask my husband to do it.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, that happened to me too.
R:  So basically, we just take turns rotating them.
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  And I got free glasses out of Walmart.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I gue- -- I just haven't checked into my mystery shopping stuff enough,  [LAUGH] I guess.
R:  It took -- it took a long time -- well, I was on bed  rest [LAUGH] with my pregnancy --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- and it was like, I can't sit in bed --
L:  No. Gosh, no.
R:  -- for six weeks, so I ended up sitting on the computer --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- and I just researched them all, and once my daughter got old enough to go out with me, that's when I started back into it. [MN]
L:  Oh, that's neat, 'cause they are fun.
R:  And I just, I have the rule, and everybody  I -- you know, when I get hired on with the company,  I just tell 'em I will not do anything unless my daughter can go with --
L:  Right! 
R:  -- so --
L:  And that's why I do this for a living. Yeah. That's neat because I got to stay home with my boys when they were young,  but then, as they got up to school age, then I had to go out and work --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I really miss, you know, all that time with them growing up. So --
R:  I-I just tell everybody, I lucked out 'cause we're one of the rare families anymore that --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- we can live on one income, because my husband --
L:  Right. Yeah. And that is rare --
R:  -- and my hus- -- well,  it's because my husband, you know --  we're forever in debt now. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  But I mean, oh well, who cares?
L:  Exactly, 'cause you're going to look back and remember all the time that you got to spend with your daughter, not look back and go, we didn't have this or we didn't have that because I wasn't working.
R:  Yeah, it's -- and it's one of those things that even, like, I used to tell people, well, I don't get to go to the movies anymore. [SIGH] Well, you know what? I found mystery shopping jobs for the movie theatres --
L:  See? [LAUGH] There you go,  there's, there's ways around it. 
R:  -- and so --
L:  Mhm? 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  That's neat.
R:  The only thing I do without, maybe, is having the newest designer shoes, and who cares about that, so --
L:  Exactly. Yes, ye-, oh yeah, yeah, children are so much more important.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I have, um, I got a little dog, and he goes to Sonic with me and he knows when we pull up, like [inaudible] --
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  -- he doesn't eat the food, but he's just not -- I just don't feed him people food, but he knows when we're there [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh --
L:  I guess when my granddaughter gets old enough, I can start taking her.
R:  Well, there you go.
L:  Yeah. Yeah, I'll have to check back into it -- I haven't done any mystery shopping for a while.
R:  There's a couple of really good websites, that -- one is like, oh, what is it, it's delphi forums dot com?
L:  Mhm?
R:  And that -- there's a section in there, Cathy's Corner, and they have a whole list of different companies, and --
L:  I'll have to check that out. Yeah.
R:  -- and all that sort of stuff.
L:  I signed up for a lot of them on that volition[?], but they just haven't -- I don't know if it's because of  the area I'm in, I just don't, you know, don't have the opportunity, or what it is.
R:  I don't know, we've been getting -- I get flooded with it. It's one of those things when it rains, it pours, and then --
L:  Right. Right. You just don't have any, or -- mhm?
R:  -- it's a famine, [LAUGH] basically.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause there was a month where 
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- I brought in four hundred dollars --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- but then I'll go through months of getting nothing again.
L:  Right. Right.
R:  And we just use that -- it's my daughter's spending money, is what it is.
L:  Mhm?
R:  So --
L:  That's like -- yeah. I, I started selling Avon again so I could do that, and I do the, the surveys, and all the different stuff, and I love the freebie sites, I've gotten all kinds of, um, oh, coupons and diapers, and formula --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- so,  I spend a lot of time on the freebie sites [LAUGH]
R:  I don't even want to think of how much formula would cost. We don't do the formula, so -- [SIGH]
L:  Right. Well, see, my daughter-in-law wasn't going to and then she decided to, so I got on all the baby sites I could find, and she's been getting formula in the mail, and really wonderful coupons. But, oh --
R:  Well, you know, the trick  is to -- with those -- this is horrible, [LAUGH] this is, this is really bad, 'cause I don't ever [inaudible] causing these things, but oh, well --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you can sign up under multiple names with the same address, so she should actually sign up herself, sign up her daughter, sign up you --
L:  I know. I -- Yes. Because I've  got it coming, I've got it [inaudible]
R:  -- under her address, and then put them all under your address as well.
L:  Right. Because I've got 'em kind of coming here, I've got 'em going to the kids' house, I've got 'em going to my best friend's house, I've got 'em going to the --
R:  And you can have --
L:  -- other grandparents' house --
R:  -- and you can use more than one name at each address.
L:  Right.
R:  Because, because when I was getting the sample --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- of, like, the cans, I ended up donating mine to, like, a food shop, because I'm like --
L:  Because you just get too many? Right, right.
R:  -- I'm never going to use them. So -- but I was getting, I think I had over a dozen cans of formula.
L:  Mhm?
R:  Which I mean,  for -- I think is like a month's supply, I don't know, but --
L:  Yeah. You -- just depends on what the baby eats --
R:  The shelters were pleased, they were more than happy to take it, so --
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, because they never have enough of that. And in my line of work I work with SRS clients and I take 'em to those shelters, and they just never have enough baby stuff, so --
R:  Isn't that sad? [MN]
L:  It is.
R:  Like the, the neighbor's kid, he's nineteen and he just got his seventeen year old girlfriend knocked up.
L:  Oh, Jesus.
R:  And her mother encouraged it, because [SIGH] her mom is a welfare mom --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- and I -- I notice, most of people that are on welfare are white --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- and it is a white family. Not that that
