R:  Hello, my name is Janice, I'm in Cincinnati, Ohio.
L:  Hi, my name is Stephanie Seymour, I'm in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
R:  Well, this is the first time I have done this, um, how about you.
L:  Ah, this is my second time.
R:  Oh, okay.  I read about it on, um, one of the mystery shop boards.
L:  Yeah, I -- I was forwarded ah, from -- I was forwarded this from an email, um, from somebody I knew.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, the topic that we are discussing right now is family and what family means to you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I can -- I can start, um -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  I think family is very important to me personally.  Um, I have, ah, -- you know, I'm -- I'm the youngest of four daughters.  My m- mother is still alive and my father had passed away a while ago and, um, some of my sisters I'm a little closer to than others and in -- in some sense it's very dis- -- it -- it is a little disappointing but I do feel that family should come first in some respects, um.  I -- I feel this way personally because I've been working on -- I'm also a writer and I've been kind of working on my writing career and, you know, I -- I know deep down my family does support me, I know my si- -- well, my mother does definitely, she vis- visibly does show her support.  And I'm sure my other sisters do too but, you know, sometimes, like if they go to an event that I'm involved in, sometimes they can't always come because they are always busy or -- and that's understandable and I've had to learn to re- -- to resign the fact that it is the thought that counts sometimes, maybe they -- they wish they could be there or sometimes they can't, you know.  At least two of my sisters feel that way and, you know, my father's side of the family I really don't know that well because I guess my -- my mother wasn't very close to her in laws so there's kind of like a gap there -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in that sense.  So it's kind of like, you know, --  you know, I don't know which one of my aunts or uncles are still alive [LAUGH], you know, that -- that kind of thing so -- and I try to ask my mother about these things and she really doesn't know, so, you know.
R:  Well, I come from a small family of just two daughters.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And my sister lives in Iowa. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, there is really not any contact, um, between us.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  She has got a life in Iowa and I am here in Cincinnati and I believe that through the years we have just become more distant.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And certain family fallings outs have just stuck through the years and I think I have come to see there are families, we have a family that we're born into and then our family of choice.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And when we've needed help or needed support it's been our family of choice -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's really been there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  My husband just underwent a kidney transplant.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He comes from a family of nine.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And out of the -- all the siblings, nobody would step forward to be tested even.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So that was disappointing.
L:  Yeah, that -- that is disappointing.
R:  Right and, you know, so we created, I guess, our own little family of the people that were, you know, supportive of us.
L:  Right.
R:  And we -- we could depend on those people and then it was funny because they there were there to help us if we needed help and then afterwards, um, there were no expectations, no, um, -- there's -- there's people who I consider friends but more like family that I could not talk to them for a couple of months.
L:  Right.
R:  And then pick up the conversation where we left off.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And its like nothing.
L:  Right.
R:  Where I think a lot of people I know their families, there's all this bickering over well, you went to her house on Christmas and you didn't come to my house.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And there's a lot of pettiness.
L:  Yeah, that -- I guess that's one thing I am thankful for on -- on some levels.  I mean -- I mean, there is some pettiness, I mean, you know, unfortunately we have a house full of women.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, as wrong as this sounds sometimes, you can't avoid it.
R:  Right. 
L:  Because I -- 
R:  But they can be -- they will be there for you if you need them, is that --  
L:  Right.
R:  That's good if you feel -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like they will be there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You can imagine how my husband felt --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- when he was needing a kidney and then it's like everybody disappears into the woods.
L:  Yeah, that -- that had to have been heartbreaking I'm sure.
R:  Well, I think I saw it, being a woman I was a little more perceptive to what was not said before it really happened, um.  He was still waiting for them to think about it and I said "This is not a thinking thing, if they're going to do it, they're gonna contact you", and after two weeks I said, "They're not gonna do it", and he's like, "Well, let them think about it a little while longer".  I said "No, no, we just need to get a final no from them", and then they would proceed to test me because they were hesitant.
L:  Right, and -- and I see that -- and, you know, if -- if one of my sisters, you know, they needed help or they needed donation or this or that or whatever, I mean that's one of those things I wouldn't give it a second thought.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'm sure like they would feel that way too and well maybe, like two of my -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- sisters, I don't know about my older sister 'cause she's just off in her own little world.  She -- she had gotten married recently. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And this is how -- my -- my older sister, she's the type of person, she really doesn't contact you, contact anyone unless she wants something from them.  So I heard she's been doing -- she's been a little more friendly ever since she got married -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- according to my mother.  But, um, well, you know, with my brother in law, I met my brother in law for like the first time at the wedding.
R:  What?
L:  Yeah, so ... 
R:  That was kind of ... 
L:  I mean I had another opportunity to meet him before but I just -- I just couldn't at the time but it's just -- I mean, my mother met him once, one of my other sisters met him once and then I have another sister who lives in Norris Town, which is a suburb of Philadelphia.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So she's pretty -- she's like the furthest from us.  Like everybody pretty much lives in the city and, um, yeah, she met him for the first time at that time too.  So, I mean he seems like a nice guy so ...  But, yeah, so it's kind of -- that kind of closeness and I just kind of -- at that time I really had some strong feelings as well as my other sister 'cause it's kind of like I kind of felt left out of the whole process.  And I know it's like it's a whole wedding thing and it's all about, you know, the bride and the groom and everything but it's kind of like, you know, you could have took a few minutes out of your time to bring him around and introduce him to us before you --
R:  Well, I think -- 
L:  -- got married.
R:  -- our  expectations just get so -- our expectations are higher than what it can really be in any given situation with family.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And to expect anything less than being, you know, somehow slighted it seems to be setting myself up for -- for a -- a letdown.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I -- you know, I've tried to become just oh, just matter of fact about it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I lower my expectations, I guess.
L:  Yeah, I've -- I've had to do -- that's something I --I had to learn the hard way too.
R:  Yep. [LAUGH]
L:  It's really difficult.
R:  Oh.
L:  But it's -- I have to tell like this is how this person is, you know, I have to -- I mean, yeah, maybe it's not right and maybe I can complain about it or whatever or think or do this but I'd say that's how it is and it's like, you know, I didn't feel it was -- it was a good thing, you know, to finally meet this guy for the first time on a wedding day but ... 
R:  No, I mean --
L:  I was like --
R:  -- it must have been uncomfortable.
L:  Well, it's like, you know, well, this is how she is, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, did she know him very long?
L:  See here's another thing, [LAUGH] it's like -- see, we're -- I'm not very close with my older sister --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't really talk to her that much 'cause I -- it's just that we have a really pers- -- we have a personality clash --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she just throws me the wrong way. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And this has just happened as I got older and developing my own sense of identity and -- and view of things.  It's just they're very different from hers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it -- you know, I didn't really know much about the courtship or about how -- I mean, I knew they met on -- on the job because I know they work for the same company but I think it was like maybe a little less than a year before they decided to get engaged.  The only reason she really wanted to get engaged -- I mean, she wanted to get married because like her son is going to be going to school in a couple of years so ... 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she's -- she was a single mother, she's not single any more but, you know, she really didn't -- 
R:  You think she's pregnant now? 
L:  No, I -- she's not pregnant now.  I don't -- yeah, I don't think she's interested in having any more children because she's like in her mid forties.
R:  But I mean do you think that's what made the wedding so quick?
L:  No, I think she was just scared of being alone.
R:  Oh.
L:  After her -- my son is -- I mean my -- not my son, I don't have any children, my nephew is not going to college for another two years so it's kind of like she could have had some more time, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  She could have got a dog or a cat.
L:  Well, she's not big -- she's not big on animals.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What's shocking about that is that we -- we always had pets in our house so -- [LAUGH]  
R:  Wow.
L:  -- I guess it was like an exception to the rule. 
R:  Well she got the husband, he's going to take the place of a dog or cat. 
L:  Well, yeah, in that sense but, you know, my son -- I mean -- not my son, I keep saying it, my nephew is still --
