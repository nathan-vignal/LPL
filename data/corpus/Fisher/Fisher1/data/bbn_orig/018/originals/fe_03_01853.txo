L:  He- hello? 
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Alison.
R:  Hi.
L:  Where are you?
R:  I am in Tomo, Wisconsin.
L:  Okay.  I'm outside of Chicago, Illinois.
R:  Really?
L:  I'm not that far I don't think, yeah.
R:  No, about four hours.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Actually, I'm actually driving back from a night class.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Nice and quiet.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, my daughter was just reading me a book, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- for her --
L:  How old is she?
R:  She is eight.
L:  Oh.  Was it for homework or for --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- something she likes to read?
R:  It's homework.
L:  For homework.  Does she use computers in her classes at school?
R:  Um, I know she did when she was, ah, in kindergarten.
L:  Okay.
R:  But I don't know how much they actually do on them now.  I know --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- she uses them here to play games and she goes on, like, Disney and stuff like that, but they have word games and stuff on there.
L:  Right.
R:  Other than that I don't let her on there a whole lot. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, it's hard to monitor what they're doing.
R:  Yep.
L:  I have a two and a half year old, and I just keep -- [LAUGH] I go -- let her go to the Nickelodeon website.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because there are coloring pages and things that --
R:  Right.
L:  That's about all she uses it now.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but I -- I teach English classes, um, at a university for freshmen.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we use computers in the classroom once a week.
R:  Oh.
L:  We meet in a computer lab.  Um, so it's a really interesting topic for me. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I really -- I, you know, I, I believe in it, I really do, because there's a lot that needs to be done on a computer anymore.
L:  Yeah, well all of our -- I mean, even in high school I think -- when I was in high school, most of my assignments had to be typed.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it was -- when I was finishing high school I think it was right at the turn of when people were really starting to use computers instead of using a word processor or a typewriter.
R:  Right.  So how old --
L:  So I know that that's what I do.
R:  -- are you?
L:  How old am I?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Twenty five.
R:  See, I'm twenty nine, so I'm --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I'm just behind you.
L:  Just passed that.  Did you use them in high school at all --
R:  Um, very little.
L:  -- that you remember?  Yeah.
R:  It was, it was all DOS when I was --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- in high school.  So --
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  -- it was really hard to understand. [LAUGH]
L:  The old programs.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Even at -- even, I took, a, um, microcomputers, ah, thing in college --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and even that was -- a lot of that was DOS.
L:  And a lot of, like, programing language? 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Did you have that?
R:  Yeah.  And it was, it was hard.  It was hard to understand.  Now --
L:  That would be --
R:  -- everything's spelled out.
L:  Yeah.  That would be really hard for me.  I mean, the classes that I've had to take about computers have mostly been research based.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, how to do research -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on the internet.  And I think that is an incredible skill, because even if you go out and work, at some point I think lots of people, especially in, like, an office environment --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you have to go on line, or people go on line for fun.  It's like, use AOL.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or whatever to go on line, and I think if you -- you can't not know how to do that now.  
R:  No, you can't.
L:  You have to know. [LAUGH]
R:  See, even, I work at the VA Hospital, and even there, there's, there's -- um, we have to have forty hours of education in -- to get our pay raises.
L:  Really?
R:  And even, even that is all on the internet now.  It's --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Yeah, it's --
L:  You have to take on line classes?
R:  Not classes, you go in and there's, like, um, education tutorials that are mandatory.
L:  Okay.
R:  And we have our own government code and everything that we have to put in, but that's all over the internet.
L:  Is it interesting?
R:  No.
L:  Or is it -- no. [LAUGH]
R:  It's all refresher.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's stuff I've -- I, I do every day and I learn every day, and it's pretty much, you know, you flip through it and then you take the quiz at the end and you pass it and you get your --
L:  And that's it, you're just done.
R:  Yeah, you get your hour of, of however much time and education that you spent, but you only --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- probably spent five minutes of it, 'cause it's all everyday things.
L:  Okay.
R:  But it's all over the internet, and I mean, there was people they had to, had to ask what a mouse was.
L:  Really?
R:  Oh yeah, yeah.
L:  That's -- I'd -- I, I mean, for me that's totally foreign because we used computers, starting in high school really, and then in college they were everywhere.  Um, you know, each dorm had a computer lab, and if you didn't know how to use it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I, I did have a few friends in college who refused to use email because they didn't know how, and they didn't really want to because they didn't know how.
R:  Right.
L:  But it was pretty much mandatory, and I don't know how you could get by now without having any knowledge of it if you're under the age of thirty.
R:  Yeah.  And see, that's, that's a lot of stuff.  Even banking.  I, I can do more -- I don't ever have to go to my bank because either over the phone or over the internet I can do whatever I need.
L:  I know.  Especially with kids.  It's really nice. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.
L:  Because I don't have to run out all the time.
R:  Exactly.  I mean, the drive throughs are nice, but it's -- I can transfer money, I can apply for loans, I can do whatever I need to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- right on the internet, which is kinda scary because anybody can get the number, but --
L:  I, I know. 
R:  -- it, you know, it -- everything.  I can pay my bills.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't actually ever have to leave the house. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, shopping, you can have Peapod deliver groceries.
R:  Yep, exactly.
L:  That's funny.
R:  Well, no, not here.
L:  Okay.
R:  My, my town's like ten thousand. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Are you outside of -- are you north of Milwaukee?
R:  Um, yes.  Do you know where Wisconsin Dolls is?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, probably about an hour past there.
L:  Okay.
R:  About forty five minutes.  I'm right in between Wisconsin Dolls and Lacrosse.
L:  Okay.  We go up to Egg Harbor sometimes.
R:  I have no clue where that is.
L:  It's up in, um, um, like, the peninsula.
R:  Oh, the UP?
L:  Almost all the way up there, but in like, that, um, what's it called?  Oh, I can't remember.  It's just northern Wisconsin.
R:  Yeah.  See, I'm south -- I'm, I'm like, by, ah, I'm heading towards O'Claire, like over towards Minnesota.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Towards the cities.
L:  Okay.
R:  I'm, I'm, like, four hours from Chicago.  It takes me about -- I have a friend that lives in Schamberg, and it takes me probably four hours to get there and about two and a half to get to Minneapolis.  So I'm like, --
L:  Okay.  That's not bad.
R:  Yeah.  No, it's not.  You know, I'm kinda right in the middle, but the town I live in is real real small, so --
L:  Well --
R:  There is --
L:  You --
R:  Huh?
L:  Do you think that makes a difference?  I mean, I live in -- I don't know if you know of Naperville.
R:  No.
L:  But it's another suburb of Chicago, and it's really -- there are a hundred and thirty thousand, I think.
R:  Really?
L:  I think it's the second biggest city in Illinois.  But all the schools have computers.  Like, state of the art computer labs, the elementary schools and junior highs.  But I think it's because it's a huge city.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they have to, and they have a lot of people contributing to the school board's budget --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so everybody has to learn how to use it.  I'm even jealous of my students.  I teach freshmen, and I'm teaching this semester how to write a research paper.
R:  Really?
L:  And I wish I had done -- I [LAUGH] had had this class when I was a freshman in college.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because it teaches them how to do, um, internet research across the board, um, and on how to manipulate, like, Word to do charts and to do, um, tables and things that I didn't learn until I was a graduate student, because --
R:  See --
L:  -- I was never forced to learn how to do it.
R:  Right.  Now, see none of that stuff is familiar with me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I can do the -- as much research as I need to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but that's about where it stops.
L:  But do you need to do more?  I mean, do you --
R:  Um, --
L:  I --
R:  -- right at the very moment, no, because I'm not -- I'm not back in school.
L:  Right.
R:  So I really don't have to.  But, um, if I were to go back to school again, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I, I would have to.  But my, my aunt is actually a, a English professor at TC, so if I need any help with that kind of thing --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- then she's here to help me.
L:  That's nice.
R:  But as far as like, me for research, it's all what I want to look up and what I -- you know, I don't really have to look anything up.
L:  Right.
R:  It's more for everyday living, and -- and, but as far as education goes, yeah, by the time my daughter gets in high school it's probably -- there's not going to be anything they don't do on computer.
L:  I -- the only thing as a teacher that I see that's ne- really negative about computer use is that people cannot spell. [LAUGH]
R:  Can't spell?
L:  Because everybody uses -- can't spell, because everybody uses spell check.  Because everything they turn in has to be typed --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so they just spell check everything.
R:  I never thought about that.
L:  So they don't even think about how to spell things.  It doesn't matter if they put them in wrong because they think spell check will catch it.  Sometimes it does, but sometimes it gives them the wrong word.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like T.H.E.I.R. instead of T.H.E.R.E.  Um, and so I see a lot more of those issues -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- than I think you would otherwise.  Because I think before you had to have somebody spell check your paper manually. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's no, like, machine to do it for you, and so people, I think, are really lazy about it.
R:  Do you get -- do you get, like, a lot of people not sound, like, themselves?  Like, do you do creative writing or anything like that, or is it all research based?
L:  This particular class is research paper, but the other course in the sequence -- this is, like, the first
