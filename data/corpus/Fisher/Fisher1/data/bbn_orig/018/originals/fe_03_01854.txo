R:  Hi, this is Pam.
L:  [NOISE] This is Doris.
R:  Hi, Doris.
L:  Hi.
R:  So we're gonna talk about computers in education, it sounds like.
L:  And exactly right now I'm on a computer. [LAUGH]
R:  Me too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I definitely think it's probably of benefit to have them.
L:  Oh yeah.  Especially everything is, ah, computers now.
R:  Exactly.  I mean, even, you know, if you go to a fast food restaurant it's still some type of computer thing that's got everything in it, and --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- I think the earlier the kids get to get on it, the easier they're going to be able to motivate and go around with it, and --
L:  Yep.
R:  But, um, it is kinda about -- I have some friends that their children are, I don't know, like, maybe in the second or third grade, and they already know more than their -- some of their parents on the computer, and if the parent will be stuck on it the kid already knows what to do to get them out or fix it, and they're just sitting there kind of like, "How old are you now?"
L:  [LAUGH] Mine now, I have, ah, from five to sixteen, and even the five year old knows how to do pretty much everything.
R:  Well, I mean, but it -- it's gonna be so much more helpful, I mean, especially, even at -- in work related things later on in life, I mean, so many thing, everything's going computer, like we talked about earlier, so, I mean they're gonna -- I mean, to them it's just gonna be second nature.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I definitely think that's gonna be a plus, they're gonna be comfortable with it.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And you know, they're not afraid to try it.
L:  No.
R:  And especially if they learn it in school where everything else is taught, they just think that's the way it is, and --
L:  Yep, that's true.
R:  -- it is. [LAUGH]
L:  It's all computers now.
R:  Oh, I know.  Now, um, in the schools your kids are in, do they each -- I know some schools, and I guess maybe bigger areas, every child has its own computer, and then some of them just have the little, um, labs or things where they only have so much time and there's so many computers and the kids have to share back and fourth.
L:  Yeah, that's how my younger ones are, and my older one has his own at school --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that he goes on when he's there. 
R:  Well, I guess they probably -- one things is they start teaching them, and then I guess the better they get along with it they feel they can let them go and be on their own --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- whereas I guess when they're first trying to teach them they just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- want to keep an eye on them. [LAUGH]
L:  Yep, and it's always good to, you know, for your parent -- the kid's parent to have a computer, 'cause I know a lot of times they come home and homework that the teachers, you know, I think they think everybody has a computer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and it's always homework that, you know, they want you to look up stuff on the computer.
R:  Yeah, I don't know, I've heard a lot of the parents say, you know, that now book reports are -- things like that, that they want the kids to turn them in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- from a computer, and I'm like you, I'm thinking, "Well, I know they may" -- and it sometimes appears like that, but everybody does not have one.
L:  No, that's what I say.  You know, I -- like my daughter had a -- it was a twenty three page report --
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  And I'm like, "Thank God we had a computer 'cause if we didn't, you know, there was no way I could get all that information". 
R:  Oh, no.  If you had to go to a library and sit for hours and look it up on a book and go back and forth, just, ah, the speed of the computer being able to find all that thing makes it --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- so much better.  But ...
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But I'd definitely say that it's [SIGH] very good to go ahead and start getting them in school and get them on the computers as soon as they can, 'cause I think the more familiar they are with them, the -- they won't be like us little bit older people who are just a little bit leary of them, and --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  My hus- -- people say, "Well I don't know what button to press" and all this, and my husband's going, "Well what's the worst thing you can do?", and then he found out 'cause he pressed a button and lost everything we had. [LAUGH]
L:  I've done that.  I, I deleted everything, I had no idea that -- my first computer I pushed the delete all --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I deleted, I wiped the whole computer out, I learned.
R:  And it did just what you said. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And you know, I think that's the good thing about the kids, because they'll -- I'm sure they'll do that, but there'll be somebody right there to show them what to do if that happens, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if it happens they won't be, you know, it'll just be -- you know, something natural for them.
L:  Yeah.  And they probably know how to fix it better than what I would. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I think it took my husband [MN] several days to get ours back up.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But yeah, so I think, you know, the more they can do the better they're gonna be job wise and everything down the line, I definitely think the computer's the --
L:  Oh yeah, 'cause one day I mean, everything's totally gonna be computers.  Everything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- out there, so it -- you know, there's gonna be their advantage to learn now.
R:  I know, and like I said, even in school, just different topics things, they can pull it up on the internet.  I mean, my goodness, the information that's readily available at literally the touch of a button --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- if they know how to operate it.
L:  Yep.
R:  So.  I agree.  I think it's a good thing, and, um, I'm hoping they'll do the teachers a little bit better, though.  My husband went to take a computer course --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he knew more than the instructor.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, no.
R:  And I thought that was kinda bad. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  So that's one thing I hope too, that they keep the teachers ahead of the students --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so that, you know, 'cause every now and then there's just some of them that are just so sharp they just pick it up and go right away.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, and if the teacher doesn't have any more information, sometimes I know they'll get a little bored with it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- but, um, ...
L:  Yeah, like my sixteen year old.  They say he has the ability to do the web graphics and web designing, you know, the web pages --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I, I told him "That's something you should follow".  I said, "Because it'll be good.  And, and you can make a lot of money from that".
R:  Oh, my goodness, yes, because I mean, the -- for people who don't know how to do that part of it, I mean, they may know how to use the, um, that computer, but they may not know how to do all that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so they're still going to be needing people for that.
L:  Yep.
R:  And, um, so I think that you're definitely heading him in the right direction and get the training while he's right there in school, and --
L:  Yep, that's --
R:  -- you know, be, be ready to go job marketing his skills, and do some -- something it sounds like he probably likes if he's already got into that.
L:  Yeah, that's what I told him.  I said, even, you know, "You can go" -- I know some restaurants, you know, they, they need the, the menus made up, like the little Chinese restaurants.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I said, "You know, you -- you can do that.  I mean, you can go there and they'll give you the list, and, you know, if they like it they'll, they'll pay you for it and they'll use it".
R:  It's true, I mean, every- almost everybody has got something that they're doing, whether it's either a web page, or what you're saying, the menus for businesses, and -- I mean, if they've got the education to go in there and --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- do that on a computer, I mean, there's endless job opportunities, I think, for them to do.
L:  Yep, that's true.  That -- it's amazing now. [LAUGH]
R:  I agree.
L:  I, I still can't get the -- I mean, I've been on here over five years on the computer, and it's -- just still amazes me --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- how you can do things and how -- just typing on a computer, like in a chat room, you know, and, and they know what you're saying, you know, it --
R:  I know.
L:  -- it's just amazing.
R:  I, I agree totally, just, you know, how does -- how all of a sudden I'm typing something in front of me and then it's at your place.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  How does that happen?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I still don't know how any of that happens, and -- but I -- I'm doing it anyway. [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.  I think that's what makes it, you know, fun and, and addictive.  A computer's very addicting now. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, definitely, definitely.  And so hopefully with some of that -- and that's nothing probably, because it really is -- even after five years it's still so new.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, but that's something and with children get it in school and they get it for twelve years or more, you know, it's just gonna be like any other class they have, or any other subject, and I think they may not be like that.
L:  Mhm, it'll just, you know, -- it'll be normal.
R:  Mhm.  Because I'm like you, when I get on the computer and I'll find something and that'll lead me to something else, and, you know, you think you're gonna be on there thirty minutes, an hour, and I look and it's four or five hours later.
L:  Yep. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I understand all that exactly.  And so that's hoping that some of that too will help the kids, and you know, that the -- with the education they can instill some of that ability in them so that everything is just not sit down in front of the computer and that's all they do, because it'll just be something normal every day hat to them.  They won't think it's probably as thrilling as we are after a little while, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I agree.  It's, it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- absolutely amazing.  And then the fact that they've got now that you can be on your phone line and be on your computer at the same time, and it's just --
L:  Oh yeah. [LAUGH] That's what I have.
R:  Yeah.  We finally had to go to that because it was either that or get another phone line, and it was, "No, that won't work".
L:  No, it's a -- you -- it evens out, you know.  'Cause you would have to pay another phone line, so it all evens out.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  In the end, anyway.
R:  I agree.  And, ah, then of course I figured the more people that do get training on the computers, you know, it's -- all of those prices are gonna go down, maybe eventually everybody will have one in
