L:  Hello, my name's --
R:  Hi -- 
L:  -- Craig.  
R:  -- how are you?  Who am I speaking with? 
L:  This is Craig.  Who's that? 
R:  Craig, okay.  I'm Darren.
L:  Hi, Darren, nice to -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- nice meet you.
R:  Good.  Ah, nice to meet you as well.
L:  Ah, what -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- what was the topic?  It's education, ah, specific -- was it specifically something or just general education?
R:  Well, it's education and computers and I -- I guess --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- it's how [MN] computers play -- what part do -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- computers play in -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the education process.
L:  Ahah, okay.
R:  I guess, that's kinda [NOISE] my guess.  Um, I [COUGH] personally think that [NOISE] computers are extremely important in terms of -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- being able to process and provide, ah, large amounts of information in a very short amount of time.  I think however that, um -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- sometimes they can -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- misused, ah, I know that I -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:   -- um, and -- have been involved in the education, ah, ah, field as a teacher and I've seen kids play games -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and do other things.
L:  [NOISE].
R:  When they're supposed to be doing academics types of stuff --
L:  Yeah [NOISE] 
R:  -- types of things.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  They're playing -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- games and doing other things --  
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- so, I think they can be primarily --  
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- for the most part I think they're a major advantage.  But what about you?
L:  I think they're, ah, [NOISE] I -- I [NOISE] agree  -- ah, you know, I've got a two year old in the background --  
R:  Oh, [LAUGH].
L:  -- and I'm trying to -- trying to [NOISE] --
R:  He wants to -- 
L:  -- okay, buddy --  
R:  -- give his input too --  
L:  -- you want some of that?  Yeah, he wants to give his input too.  You wanna know what he wants, [NOISE] he wants to input some chips in his mouth --  
R:  Oh, oh, --
L:  -- and I don't have any -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [LAUGH] um, [NOISE] I have to say I -- I think computers are a wonderful power tool but that we're still doing some catching up in terms of pedagogical, you know, the appropriate pedagogical techniques to use them in classrooms.  I personally, ah, have been in classrooms where there is a computer in front of every student, ah, --  
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- in -- you know, within graduate school --  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and, ah -- well, I should say it was an undergraduate class but, ah, -- no, it was a graduate class.  Anyway, you know, but at the beginning -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- of that cl- -- the semester everyone was paying attention to the professor -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and by the end of the semester fifty per cent of the people were paying attention to the professor -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and the other fifty were surfing the web and checking their email --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] in general just showing up to be there and then leaving and that's -- I -- I found it distracting being one of the people who was trying to pay attention to the class that, you know, all the screens around me were switching, but I think also,  you know, -- 
R:  [NOISE]  
L:  [LIPSMACK] Once you're -- once you're, um, ah, sort of, ah, you've adapted to, ah -- once you've adapted to that environment maybe that's not such a big issue.  I also know that, um, you know, there's a lot of success using, um, what they're calling cognitive tutors, you know, these sort of intelligent tutoring programs, so, I don't know I think like you said, I think they're -- they're a really wonderful tool, they can be -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- just as disruptive as they can be helpful if they're applied wrong and, um, they're also sort of -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- an inevitably [LAUGH] you know, like --  
R:  Yeah.   
L:  -- in a different way? 
R:  That's true, but that's like anything else I think almost any tool that [MN] that is -- is used to -- to do a certain job or provide a certain function -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- can also be misused and --  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- if it's misused then it's not of -- not of great value in that sense --  
L:  Yep.
R:  -- but that doesn't mean it's no good intrinsically -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, it still has a great -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- deal of -- of value overall.  I mean -- 
L:  Moreover -- 
R:  -- that's what I think.
L:  -- I think also it's a little bit -- there is a little bit of, ah, Pandora's box aspect too in the sense that -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, once you begin to put computers in a classroom or even begin to put computers in front of kids for a purpose of learning, which is certainly a good purpose, ah, there is no going back, you know, you can't decide, "Oh, this isn't working we're going to get rid of these things", so.
R:  Yeah, I -- I agree, [MN] I think for the most -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- part though --  
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- they provide a real, ah, a great -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- assistance to the kids, I mean because like you said you -- you were talking about --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the cognitive -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ah, tutoring -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and I think that works very well, I mean I have --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- some friends now who -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- are teachers and -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- computers do a great job of, um, you know -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [MN] kind of tutoring kids -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in maths and reading and all -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- those you know, the basic, um, skills --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [MN] but I think -- I think they work pretty well but I think, you know -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- just like -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- just like anything else it kind works both ways I guess.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, so, um, --
L:  -- there's a group -- there's a group [NOISE] that comes out of [NOISE], um, Carnegie Mellon  -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- systems --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [MN] designing these systems where the -- the computer is tutoring the students and [NOISE] it's adaptively -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, you know, adjusting what it's teaching the students based on the students' performance -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I think it's really kinda incredible.
R:  Yeh.
L:  [NOISE] So, --
R:  Maybe -- 
L:  -- [NOISE] do you work -- you -- you work in education still?
R:  Um, no, I actually don't I'm -- I'm actually a [MN] consultant.
L:  Mhm.
R:  For, um, [MN], um, [NOISE] I actually work for a consulting firm now, we actually go around and do all types of management consulting for --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- different types of firms and that kind -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of thing.  What do you do?
L:  [NOISE] Ah, I'm -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- ah, graduate research assistant and, ah, part of why I know about this -- these cognitive tutors that are being developed -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at Carnegie Melon is I work with computers -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and logistics -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and, ah, it's an interest of mine is to sort of, ah, see how computers can be used, ah, model the way a human being think or to enhance a, ah, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- cognitive ability to people and so, ah, it's an interesting time -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- an interesting field.
R:  Yeah, it sounds very interesting.  What -- what are you -- are you working on a degree in something, or? 
L:  Yeah, I'm working on a PhD.  Ah, I'm working in a PhD in library and information science, ah, but I'm particularly interested in information seeking behaviors and where people get their strategies for finding information and the degree to which [NOISE] um, those strategies are sort of encoded in our language, [NOISE] which is how [NOISE] I happen to know a bunch of complicational linguists -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- ah, which is how I happen to get an email saying:  "Oh, there's this Fisher project and they're looking for callers." [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] And that that -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- puts me here talking to you, while driving -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- down the road on my cell phone.
R:  Yeah, and -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I am too.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Let me ask you this.  Do you know what the purpose of this study is? 
L:  [LIPSMACK] um, I don't know exactly what they're going to do with this collection but, ah, I know -- I know some of the kinds of things they do, um, with these [NOISE] recordings so, you [NOISE] can -- they'll probably be tran- probably though -- these will be manually transcribed, certainly someone will try running automated, ah, speech recognition against them, [LIPSMACK] um, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they might be analyzed for all kinds of linguistic features like, ah, you know, discourse analysis, um, [NOISE] like when I'm going, um, I'm sort of -- when I'm, you know, you and I have take taking turns [NOISE] talking.  I don't know exactly what they're going to do, you know, with this particular collection but I know that's the kind of things [NOISE] that they have been doing with similar, ah, databases of telephone conversations.  They have been doing it for a few years too.  It's kinda -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- cool [LAUGH]  
R:  Have you done them before? 
L:  No, no, this is the -- well, you're the third call that I've done.  So, I got two calls at home and then they stopped calling me at home and then I noticed they tried calling me a couple of times over the last day or two specifically on my cell phone so I'm guessing they're trying to collect more cell phone data, um, --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- kinda neat.  [MN]  
R:  [MN] Yeah, it --  
L:  How about you -- 
R:  -- is.
L:  -- how did you wind up, ah, involved in this project.
R:  Well --
L:  How did you won't up calling -- 
R:  There's a website called, um, fat wallet dot com. 
L:  Oh, right, I know that website.
R:  You've -- you -- you've checked it out a few times, or ...? 
L:  Yeah, a -- a friend of mine, a college of mine pointed out to me -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- ah, because he's found some incredible computer deals through there and all kinds of incredible stuff -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so, there was something on fat wallet about this? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that's really cool.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  [MN]
R:  Fat wallet has everything.
L:  Yeah, there is another --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- website that I really like too, deal sea, have you ever been to that one?
R:  DOT.
L:  No, deal sea, ah, like dealing cards and then ocean D.E.A.L.S.E.A. dot com and, ah, it's not quite like fat wallet there's not these sort of postings back and forth but there's [NOISE], ah, there's lots of really good stuff that gets posted up there, coupons and great -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- deals [NOISE] and a lot of it [LAUGH] 
R:  You said -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you said d- D.E.A.L. what? 
L:  S.E.A. [NOISE] dot com.
R:  Oh, -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- okay.
L:  -- You know, in ocean of --
R:  It's just -- 
L:  -- ocean of good deals.   
R:  Okay, deal and then sea? 
L:  Right, with --
