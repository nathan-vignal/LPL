R:  Hello? 
L:  Hello? 
R:  Hi, my name's Dawn.
L:  My name is Maryanne, I'm from Massachusetts?
R:  Oh, I'm from Salt Lake City.
L:  Oh, how nice, so, -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what do you think about computers and education?
R:  Um, I think these days it helps, I mean I wish I would've -- they would've had the, ah, computers like today back when I was a kid going to school. 
L:  I think so too -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I -- I think -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's just going to get more computerized as the years go by.
R:  Oh, definitely -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think so too.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, you're not going to be able to get anywhere if you don't have a computer.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, I went to, ah, college for a year and, ah, I didn't have a computer at home and I was just so lost, it makes the work so much harder if you don't have a computer at home. 
L:  Oh, sure.  Even small children know -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- how to use them today.
R:  [NOISE] Yes, they do [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  My daughter is, ah, six years old and [NOISE] she can use a computer fair- fairly well, get around on the internet to, like, the kid's sites and everything -- 
L:  Right.  They -- they -- they know how to do all of that.
R:  Yep.
L:  I have an older daughter and she shows me a lot. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I had to [MN] learn by myself, it would've helped if you would've -- helped if you had somebody -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- that knows what they're doing otherwise it's, whew, it just makes it really hard. [LAUGH]  
L:  I think most of the schools have them.
R:  I think so too, even -- even, ah, when my daughter was going to Head Start a couple of years ago, they had a computer in the classroom.
L:  Right.
R:  It's just -- it's amazing how -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- how fast it's picked up [MN] 
L:  Well, it's so much -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, when they get older to use it for research and -- 
R:  Yep.  
L:  -- and just to -- to communicate -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's -- it's just at the [LIPSMACK] -- right at your fingertips you can find out all sorts -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- of information. [MN] 
R:  Yep, you can --  
L:  Good and bad [LAUGH].
R:  Yes -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- yes, there's drawbacks too, to the bad, yes, there's --  
L:  Ah, there is, yes, that's why -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- I notice when I went to our library today, they even have them set up at the library -- 
R:  [NOISE] Yep, they do --  
L:  -- to use if you don't have a computer at home.
R:  Yep, it's-- they're everywhere --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're everywhere.  And it really helps with education, because, ah, I'm currently going to school, um, -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  --  attempting to get to my degree online, I don't have to attend a class.
L:  [MN] Isn't that interesting?
R:  It's complete online, they send me my books and our class time is like a chat room type of a set up, you do your homework, everything is online.  You don't have -- even to go to college you don't have to go into a classroom now.
L:  Do -- do -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you have to send papers in? 
R:  Nope, we can just do them over the internet.  [MN]  
L:  Oh, goodness -- 
R:  -- send them by email. [NOISE] 
L:  Isn't that interesting?  
R:  [NOISE] Yep.
L:  Do you enjoy doing it that way? 
R:  Oh, I do, I do, I -- I have a hard time being in the classroom setting.  I -- I get kinda uncomfortable around other people a- about -- around a crowd of people, you know, --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and when everybody is focusing on, you know, like if the teacher calls own ya, I'd freeze up.
L:  Oh, God it's just like you're back in fifth grade.
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes -- 
L:  [LAUGH] isn't that the truth? [LAUGH]  
R:  Yep [LAUGH] 
L:  That's just what it's like.
R:  [LAUGH] Yes.
L:  I feel the same way.
R:  Yeah --  
L:  I -- I --
R:  And this wa- go on.
L:  Oh, no, it's -- it's -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's just, you know -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- being in a crowd.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Like having people look at you -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- if you have to make a speech --  
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know. 
R:  Yes, this way -- this way by doing it online you don't have that. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, that's -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- wonderful.
R:  [NOISE] Yes, it is, it's very wonderful, and then, you know, with having two little ones I don't have to worry -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- about finding a baby sitter, or --  
L:  Right, or you can do it -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- at night.
R:  Yep.
L:  Oh, that's very interesting.
R:  Yep.  The computers, I'd be lost without mine, I would be -- 
L:  I would too.
L:  -- completely lost.
L:  I would too.  I -- [MN] you -- you just grow to depend on it more and more.
R:  You do it's --  
L:  [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  -- it's just like a phone or a car.
L:  Right, right. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You can pay your bills, you can just do -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  [NOISE] From sending pictures -- 
L:  Right.  
R:  -- to talking, to -- yeah, everything. 
L:  How many children do you have?
R:  Um, I currently raising two kids.
L:  God bless you.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]  
L:  It's hard in this day and age.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, it is.
L:  To do that, I'll tell you.
R:  It is, especially alone, but --  
L:  Yeah, it's hard.
R:  We manage.
L:  I'm sure you do and I'm glad to see -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that you are going on with -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- your education.
R:  Yeah, my goal is to become -- is to work in law enforcement.
L:  Oh, wow.  [MN] 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. 
L:  I don't know whether I wanna be like a probation or parole officer or a -- a law enforcement officer --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- or work in a jail, or what, but that's where I'm headed -- 
L:  My -- 
R:  -- hopefully.
L:  -- my nephew is a corrections officer.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Interesting.
L:  Yeah, yeah --

R:  [NOISE] Oh, wow.
L:  He -- he does not have pleasant stories to tell.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, I bet he -- 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- doesn't. 
L:  I'd rather see you be a parole officer. [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- yeah, less -- less, ah, risk in- --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- -volved.  
L:  Yeah, and they're just so violent.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
L:  They're just so violent.  I wonder if they have computers in the jails? [NOISE]  
R:  [NOISE] Um, I have read where, um, -- well -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I've heard in the news stories where there's some prisons that did allow jails, ah, inmates to have internet access and [NOISE] they were sending -- it was like some sort of work-- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- force, work job something -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- But then -- but then on top of that, the -- some inmates were, ah, ah, putting personalized information -- 
L:  Mm, God -- 
R:  -- to the stuff they were sending out --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, they -- they lost that.
L:  See, they abuse it. 
R:  Yep, they do.
L:  Cause I mean -- oh, God.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Have you done many of these surveys?
R:  [NOISE]

R:  Oh, there is --? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I had -- I don't know what topics -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I just -- they just call me and tell me what the topic is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I didn't know you could find out.
L:  The one I -- I did the other day was about, ah, -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the war.
R:  Yep, me too.
L:  Oh, -- 
R:  [NOISE]

R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- ah, like the different subjects they have.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Talk to people you normally wouldn't talk to.
L:  Right.  I think that's the purpose -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- behind it -- 
R:  Yep.  
L:  -- you just talking -- 
R:  And, yeah -- 
L:  I'm sorry, go ahead -- 
R:  -- and again it's all due to computers.  I find -- I found out about this online.  [LAUGH]

R:  You're -- 
L:  [NOISE] You -- 
R:  -- very true.
L:  -- can always, y- you know, not --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that I go into the chat rooms -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- because that's a little bit beyond my knowledge [MN] but I -- I would think you could -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- always find someone to talk to if you're -- 
R:  Yep.  [NOISE]  
L:  -- lonely, you need some -- 
R:  [NOISE]

L:  [MN] 
R:  -- do they post like free offers --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- freebies you can get, but you can talk to other people.  Like if you have a problem, there's a vent forum where you can vent, or if you just want to talk and have a question to ask there's a -- there's a forum for just regular chitchat and ... [NOISE]  
L:  Oh, that's interesting -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- now, did you find out about this program through that? 
R:  [NOISE] Through 'em -- yeah, just surfing the web.

R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- it's worth a try".  
R:  Yeah, that's how I found it was through one of the message boards I belong to --  
L:  Right. [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  God, they must have thousands of people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] I wonder -- 
R:  Unlimited it seems like.
L:  -- I wonder what they're going to do with the information? 
R:  [NOISE] You know, I don't know.  I wonder that too, mhm.
L:  Some secret society. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Maybe.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] We're all going to be hypnotized in an occult.  [LAUGH] 
R:  There you go. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] That's true.
L:  Now, I'm paranoid.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I have to be very careful.  Isn't that funny though? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I didn't think it was that widespread.
R:  It is, it's just --  
L:  There -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- must be thousands.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Yeah, millions if not.  [MN] 
L:  Oh, God.
R:  [NOISE] There are lots and lots --  
L:  All typing away on computers.
R:  Yep.
L:  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ten minutes is a long time.
R:  It is [LAUGH] --  
L:  When you have to -- 
R:  -- it is.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Especially when you're kinda-- like when we -- when I was talking to the other person about the war it's like, -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- "Okay, how many things can you say about the war?"  I -- 
L:  Right --
