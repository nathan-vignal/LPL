L:  Hi, my name is Melanie. 
R:  Hi, Melanie, this is Tina.  How are you? [LAUGH]
L:  Now -- good, good.  I am a teacher for, ah, Los Angeles unified school district.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm a graduate student at Tutts University in Massachusetts.
L:  Okay.  And we do use computers, obviously, in our classroom.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Okay, we have, um, what we can an ante room, it's a separate room like, um, off of our main room, it's like a brand new school, um, and we have two iMacs for the children to use, and we have all educational, um, games for them to play on for math, for reading, and you want to know something, they absolutely love it.  A lot of the children are from poor families and they cannot afford to, you know, have computers in their own homes.
R:  Right.
L:  And they do look forward to that.
R:  So --
L:  So you want to know something, it's a great way for them to learn, and it's fun.
R:  Yeah.  I, I, um, I'm a child development major, so I completely agree that it, um, [MN] is a tool that should be used for education of children, but also as a graduate student I would be lost without my computer.  So, you know.
L:  Yeah, and I agree as well because we do our homework, um, we give out weekly worksheets 'cause it's second grade --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we give out weekly worksheets for the students that are done -- are computer generated, so this way, you know what I'm saying, it's already on the, um, word processing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and we just, you know, plug in the days and all the letters, go home, you know, type written to, you know, the parents, and we do have, um, in service classes also, um, for computers.  We also have a computer lab in our school, um, we have a computer club where the children, um, every Tuesday they do go ahead and, um, they can sign up for a different club once a week --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and they teach them how to use the computers, how to type and everything like that.
R:  Wow.  Well, um, did you have computers when you were in school?
L:  No, I'm old. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh -- I'm, I'm -- not young. [LAUGH]
L:  No, I'm in my late forties, okay.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
L:  But my -- ah, I have, I have a child that's twenty years old, um, she's attending UCLA and she had computers, we had a computer lab in her elementary school, and she did have -- um, was it, ah, excuse me, a certified teacher that taught computers --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- once a week.
R:  Wow.
L:  And, um, in the state of New Jersey and to exit New Jersey you do not need computer.  Okay, we had moved in between to California, and she needed a six month computer class in order to exit.
R:  Really, in high school?
L:  Mm.  Yes, in high school in California you need a six month computer class to exit, or you can opt to go ahead and take, um, just take the exit exam.
R:  Right.
L:  Which is what she opted to do.  It took her three hours to do it, 'cause they ask you, you know, Excel, making a spreadsheet and things like that.
R:  Wow.  Well, I think it's good that they do that.  When I was in high school they got computers my senior year, um, but I was on a different track and it wasn't part of my curriculum, 'cause I -- you know, that was already planned the year before, so I didn't get that benefit.  But I do think it's, you know, something I wish --
L:  I mean, the chil-
R:  -- I had gotten in high school.
L:  The, the children use the computers in the library in order -- the Dewey dec- decimal system is no longer in use, everything is -- it's all computer generated.
R:  Mhm, yeah. I --
L:  And see, and that's the wave of the future, I mean, in second grade they're already using computers, they know how to, you know, they know how to put the -- you know, type in the last name of somebody.  It's just amazing, they know to see if the book is already, you know, in stock.  I mean, it's just -- it's great, because, you know, our world is technology and it's advancement, so I think it's great.
R:  Yeah.  Well I mean, they're even using computers in preschools now, so --
L:  Well we aren't -- no, we don't use them in kindergarten in our schools, honestly, they don't start until first grade. 
R:  Well, I used to, um, I was the assistant director of a preschool, and we had, um, computers, and I also ran an after school program and shared a space with ah -- another preschool that had computers.  And my twelve year old brother, when he was in preschool he used computers.  So, um, I'm -- I don't know if it's the norm or not, but, [MN] my experience in Virginia, um, it was pretty widely done.  So I think even with manual dexterity, ah, preschoolers benefit from clicking.
L:  You know, what's funny, was funny was today, um, I had a student stay after school, a few of them, 'cause they like to do their homework if I'm gonna be there, um, and he says, "Can I go on the computer?" I said, "Sure".  I said, "We had no computer, you know, activities [inaudible] 'cause we're testing next week".  I said, "Sure, go ahead, let's go boot it up".  He goes to me, "What happened to the" -- um, he wanted to use an -- um, it's like a phonics kind of thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  "What happened to it?"  I said, "I really don't know.  You don't see it over there?"  I said, "I have no idea who took it".  So he goes, "I think it go stuck in the other computer".  I said, "Oh, they didn't take it out right.  "Okay", I said, "I'll be right over there to go ahead and, you know, retrieve it from the other computer".  So you know what I'm saying, they know all the programs, I mean, it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- amazing what these kids know, and especially those that do have computers in the house.
R:  And they like to st- my, um, little brother loved Jump Start when --
L:  Right, that's what we have, that's what we use.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  That's exactly what we use.  Mhm.
R:  Yes, and he liked to study.  That's amazing. [MN] Because it was --
L:  I mean -- 
R:  -- like a computer game for him.
L:  Right, it's great. 
R:  But he was really studying.
L:  It's great.  I mean, computers are the wave of the future.  I mean, this is it.  Great for -- you know, I know what happened was, um, I don't want to mention the name of the school that I teach in, but the school that I teach in, um, it was -- we celebrated, um, a birthday.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay?  So the, ah, the principal had gotten, ah, a web site on the internet, and said, um, "I rank all the classes", he said, "This is the internet, you're gonna get a grand tour of a certain place.  So, you know, put your computers up, have the kids go ahead and go into -- on the computers, and they can see, you know, this place".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so they're fascinated, or they'll have me go on and say, ah, like give them a project to do for earth day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or they needed to know about Martin Luther King.
R:  Yeah, it's great --
L:  Do you understand?  So I pulled up the computer --
R:  -- for study questions, yeah.
L:  -- you see, and this is second grade.  And --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it's not, believe me, our school is pretty advanced, so the second graders are working, even an average class is working on a third grade level.  It's really not too advanced for them, you know what I'm saying, some of them, you know, I don't allow them to go on the internet without me being there for obvious reasons.
R:  No, I think that's important, yeah. 
L:  But you know what I'm saying, they'll use my computer which is by my desk.  We have three computers in every class.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But they will use my computers as opposed to going to that separate room, and it's, it's terrific, you know what I'm saying, we just pull up things all the time.
R:  Have you been on Ask Jeeves for kids?
L:  No, what is that?  
R:  It's, ah --
L:  Oh, Ask Jeeves, yes, yes, yes, yes.  Uh-huh.
R:  But they have a kids' site, Ask Jeeves has a special kids' site where kids can type in homework questions.
L:  They have homework, they have homework help on the internet, I belong to a -- it's a educators kind of thing, um, Roy Hill has a site, Crayola has a site --
R:  Oh, okay, oh, yeah. 
L:  -- they all have sites for teachers and everything like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I get, you know, lesson plans off the internet, we needed to do like a drug thing, so you know what I'm saying, I said -- oh, I said, "I could" -- 'cause one of the teachers was really creative, she goes, "I got it off the internet".  So you know what I'm saying, they have some really good information on the internet for the teachers as well as for the kids, and we use that as one of our, um, methods.  Okay, we, like, we teach expository writing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's like true factual writing, then we say, "Yes, you can go ahead", you know, we teach them, you know, encyclopedias, you know, books on the related topic as long as they're factual, um, you can go to dictionaries to look up the definition of the word, um, and I said, we could also go on the computer, and -- and I explained to them, we went into the library, because our library has eight computers, I went in and I showed them.  I said, "Here, we're doing dinosaurs".  Okay, so we go to, like, the, you know, we go to Google, and then we press in dinosaurs.  I said, "And look at all of these web sites that, you know, come up".
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I said -- 'cause they had a report, and I said, "You know, if you have a computer at home, feel free to use it.  Go to the library, you could use it there".
R:  Yeah.  It's nice that they're having -- you know, they have them accessible to everybody in the schools and in the libraries.  This, this thing that we're doing right now is an educational thing.  Um, how did you find it on -- did you find it on line too?
L:  I found it on line, that's exactly how I found it.
R:  Did, did you find -- I'm wondering how to find other places like this, other studies like this.  Did -- do you find --
L:  I have no idea, but this one seems really really interesting, whereby it -- that's what I'm saying, it's, it's an educational kind of thing, it's something that I can relate to, like, you know, talking about computers and things like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- how it relates to my job on a daily basis.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I'm interested in things that, you know, I mean, I do some other, you know, market survey kind of things, but they're not, shall we say, educational, [LAUGH] they're, you know --
R:  Okay, so you found it by looking for surveys on line? 
L:  For surveys, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I found it by looking for surveys, yeah.
R:  Well, that's --
L:  But, um, --
R:  Yeah.  There --
L:  You know what I'm saying, but we, we use them in California but it was pretty interesting.  I mean, you know, I don't know what kind of research they're doing, but in California you do need six months of computer in order to exit.
R:  Wow.  What I -- my interest, research interest in school's advanced intellectual development and creativity, so I'm kind of in a different, um, even though I'm, you know, cognitive development all psychology, it's a different area.  But I am interested in how computers aid in, ah, cognitive development.  I'm taking a class next semester called technologies of the south -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's, um, about how computers, um, impact personal development, and, you know, the focus is on childhood because it's in the child development department.  So that ought to be interesting.  I'm interested in, you know, things like, um, how it helps children learn language and communication skills and things like that.
L:  See, you know what it is, children, a lot of children are hands on learners, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they, they love this kind of thing, love to play games -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they just love it -- one of the boys says, I have a Mac at home, I'm a, I'm a
