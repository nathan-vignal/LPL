L:  Hi, I'm Laura.
R:  Hi Laura, I'm Brenda.
L:  Okay.
R:  This is your first time doing this? 
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  Mine too. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Well, do you have family? 
R:  Um, yes, I'm married, been married twenty seven years and, ah, we have four children all grown and five grandchildren and my mother is still alive and I just lost my grandmother in January, she just died in January.  I have one brother and, ah, of course a lot of,  ah, nieces and nephews and cousins.  How about you? 
L:  Not quite as big of a family.  Um, I am married, I have been married for nine years.  I have two children of -- they're four and five and my parents are living and I have one grandma left on my side.  My husband also has his grandma so my children have two great grandmas.  I have one sister and my husband, um, his brother is deceased so he currently has two brothers and one sister.
R:  Where do you live Laura? 
L:  I am in Illinois.
R:  Yeah, I live in Tennessee.
L:  I wondered, I used to visit Tennessee all the time before my family.  My grandparents used to live in Tennessee.
R:  Oh, whereabouts? 
L:  They actually lived, um, in Huntland Tennessee and it's south of Winchester --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- very, very south, it's close to the Alabama border.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm up a hundred miles east of Nashville.
L:  Okay.
R:  And a hundred miles east of Knac- Knoxville approximately so we are just about in between those and upper Tennessee.
L:  Yeah, my, um, my brother in law has just moved to Tennessee, he's in Spurder[?] Tennessee.
R:  Nice area.  We moved here from New York State about, ah, let's see, oh goodness, fifteen, sixteen years ago.  So, any idea exactly what we are supposed to talk about, just family, huh? 
L:  We are supposed to talk about family.  I believe the study is just doing linguistics which is our vocal tones, the words we choose, how we enunciate and articulate.  Um, that's my understanding of what linguistics is anyway so, I'm not sure exactly what they're looking for but they're trying to make the topic something general that everybody can talk about. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, right.  So you have little ones, what did you say four and six? 
L:  Four and five, yes --
R:  Four and five --
L:  -- they are little, they are fifteen months apart.
R:  -- wow.  My daughter has one -- has two that are thirteen months apart and so one's a year old, one is two and then she has one who is five.  So, now, is your -- is your five year old in kindergarten yet or not yet? 
L:  Yes, she is in kindergarten this year.  She will be going to first grade next year.
R:  And how has the younger one adapted to, um, -- are they boys, girls or what? 
L:  It's, ah, -- my younger one is a boy and my older one is a girl.
R:  How has he adapted to his sister being in school? 
L:  Well, they -- um, he is also in school so it's not been a huge ... 
R:  Ahah.
L:  My daughter started preschool when she was three and at the time that was very hard for him when she started because he always wanted to go too.
R:  Right.
L:  And he wasn't allowed to go and that was hard but now he also started school then when he turned three.  Both of my children are in special education.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, so they started younger and, ah, they are both speech language delayed so ... 
R:  But now have you found that, ah, school has helped your daughter? 
L:  Tremendously, yes.  She is, um -- she is still a little bit behind but she is not as far behind as she was.
R:  Great.
L:  So, it has very -- been very -- 
R:  Does she have a hearing problem as well?
L:  No, and that's what everybody says when they are speech language, that hearing is the, you know, most common -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- sector and actually she did not even have an earache until she was four.
R:  My goodness.
L:  And my son has never had an ear infection yet.
R:  Oh, that's wonderful.
L:  So, other things but not an ear infection.
R:  I -- I wondered, ah, we have three boys and a girl, the girl is the youngest and she had hearing problems.  She had ear infections from the time she was two weeks old.
L:  Did she get tubes? 
R:  Ah, she did get one tube and then when that tube came out it caused a hole in her eardrum.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  She's had four operations to close up that hole on her eardrum.  The last one I think she had when she was sixteen and that one held the longest, probably, mhm, three or four years but the -- the membrane was so thin and now she does have another hole in her eardrum so she has a hearing loss but for -- for several years, of course, when she started school she had a problem with speaking.  She didn't have a problem as far as, ah, you know, talking later, learning to talk or talking later, she had a problem with sounds.
L:  Yeah.
R:  With words themselves --
L:  [COUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- understanding what the word was or the concept of it and with spelling, of course, she had a big problem with that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But she has -- she did compensate quite well and she had speech therapy in school which helped her tremendously.
L:  Yeah, it really does help.  I know with my children, they both have expressive and receptive language delays and it has been a tremendous change since they started speech therapy.
R:  Great.  That's great.  Ah, is that something that's hereditary because both of your children have it? 
L:  That's what they said, yes, they don't know, they're -- they're not quite sure what, you know, causes it.  Um, they don't know for sure since there is no problem with the ears why it even happens because that's always when your -- you know, when your children are -- you want to know why. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, of course. [LAUGH] 
L:  And they really can't say, um, and they say they may have some, you know, difficulty with learning, um, because they are behind with their expressive language and receptive language and they said that might, you know, pose difficulties and it has and, you know, my daughter is behind as far as general skills but not extremely far.  But she also has problems with the gross motor skills, you know, she is not as well balanced as other people -- 
R:  I see.
L:  -- her age but now my son has the same thing and he -- his balance is fine. 
R:  Interesting, isn't it.
L:  It's very strange 'cause they don't know exactly what causes it or, you know, why it happens.  It's a very strange thing.
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  And we have been trying to, you know, adjust and figure out what ways that we can help them learn better so unfortunately they just don't quite know.  [LAUGH] They all try and help and, you know, they don't -- they don't have the answer.
R:  Right, right.
L:  They don't have any answers.
R:  Well ... so, what kind of fun things do you and your family do? 
L:  Well, not much this week.  Um, my son has scarlet fever. 
R:  Oh, dear.
L:  And so he is covered with a rash and he is still contagious but right now my -- my daughter is a daisy girl scout, they start that in kindergarten.
R:  Oh, neat, I bet she's enjoying that.
L:  Yeah, two thousand, I'm a -- I'm a co leader for that so that keeps me quite busy. 
R:  Right.
L:  I volunteer in their schools.  It's very important to me to be able to do that and that's one of the reasons why I am home, I am -- I currently stay home with my children.
R:  That's one of the best jobs and the hardest jobs there is.
L:  Mhm, and, ah, I love being able to do that.  I am a former teacher, I used to teach high school English and speech and theatre.
R:  Well, you are well suited for this study then.
L:  Yeah.  It was, ah, it was very important that, you know, I was able to stay home and -- and that's what we did and I've been home.  I had a very bad pregnancy with my daughter and I wound up leaving mid school year, um, on the advice of my doctor --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with my daughter's pregnancy and, ah, I've been home ever since and trying to stay home. [LAUGH]
R:  It -- it's great if you can.  I was a stay at home mom as well and my husband, um, is disabled.  He spent twenty years in the service and got out with a disability and then after that had several heart attacks so, ah, he had to go on permanent disability, ah, even -- well, actually that was before we were married he was on permanent disability.  So, he's always been home and I got to be a stay at home mom too and I was just talking with a friend of mine today that I went to lunch with and we were talking about television and I said one of -- probably one of the best things we ever did for our family was we took the TV out, we had no television for about ten years while our kids were growing up and at first it was like a culture shock. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I can imagine.
R:  Ah, but we learned to play games, to read, um, make up games, do charades, little skits and plays, go places together and as I look back on it I think it probably was one of the best things we ever did for our family, for our kids, was just to take it out because we really just sometimes weren't smart enough to turn it off, disciplined enough so, ah ... 
L:  That's actually something that --  
R:  -- we just enjoyed our family.
L:  Yeah, it does -- TV is a big issue.  I know many of my children's friends have televisions in their bedrooms --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I can't stand that. [LAUGH] I can't stand it at all.  We have one TV in the house, it's in our basement and it's not --
