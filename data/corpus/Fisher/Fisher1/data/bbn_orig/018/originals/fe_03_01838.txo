R:  Hi, my name is Deborah.  
L:  Hi, my name is Catherine.
R:  [LAUGH] I'm in California.
L:  I'm in Ohio.
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, hi. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, hello.
R:  Well, this is my first call, so ...
L:  This is mine too. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  So -- so we are talking about education and computers.
R:  Yes.  Well, I taught high school -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for ten years -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and I use computers all the time and I thought they were a big -- well -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- especially in the math, um, program that I was in, they were a big help. 
L:   Yeah.  [MN] Well, I have two -- [NOISE] two small children and, um, [MN] I don't know how much they use computers at school but I know my son uses a computer a lot here.  [NOISE] When he was younger, um, we bought a lot of those, like, Re- Reader Rabbit.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE]  Games and stuff like that and I think it really helped him to learn. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  Learn a lot.  [MN] 
R:  Right, well I know I have two daughters also, ten and seven, and they use them in school too and just for the keyboarding and being able to, um, -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- type in things, you know.  I mean they are learning the keyboarding on the computer and I just think all of those skills are going to be necessary.
L:  Yeah.  I don't -- I don't think there is any jobs now where you don't -- where you don't have a computer.
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So ...
L:  [MN].  Well, I know my son, um, in their classroom -- well, he just recently switched schools.  At their old school they had, I think, six computers in their classroom and they each took turns during the day.  [MN] They each had, like, a half hour or something where they could play game on it, do math problems and stuff like that and he really enjoyed that and learned a lot from it.  [MN] So now -- now I think they have, at his school they have, um, -- what the heck is it called?
R:  Do they have like a lab?
L:  Yeah.  Like, all the first grade classrooms and the second grade classrooms are together, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  And in the middle they have computers.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think they go out there periodically throughout the day, and they have to type [MN] -- they have to take turns typing newsletters every week.  So I think it really helps them --
R:  Well, that sounds good, yeah.
L:  -- learn how to do that. 
R:  My -- my girls have -- they have computers in their classroom and they each get, ah, one day a week --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- where they can get on it where they rotate with other kids and -- and, you know, even just doing I -- like, I remember when I was teaching the kids that that was when Where In the World is Carmen[?] San Diego had come out.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And, you know, --  
L:  [COUGH].
R:  -- a lot of those they just make learning your geography fun.
L:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK] That's what they just had.  Um, my son's in second grade and they have to do reports, like, big reports.  They had to do a President report.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, most of it they did at school because the computer was there.
R:  Right.
L:  They di- -- they looked up stuff on the internet and they typed the stuff up o- -- you know, there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I think it's a lot, you know, -- when I went to school we didn't have computers in the classroom. [LAUGH] 
R:  Same here. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So -- and I know even when I was in --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- college with a math degree and I had --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- a minor in computer science and things were just starting then.  Things have gone way beyond from even when I was in college, so ... 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  It is really incredible.
L:  That's what I think.  They're -- [SIGH] they're a lot better off now w- with the computers than before.
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  You can get so much more information and do so much more than you could -- could b- before.
R:  Right.  Just -- well, even with the internet as you said and the reports that they are writing and -- and being able to type them up and -- I didn't learn typing 'til high school.
L:  Yep, that's when I did it.
R:  And -- and they're already, you know -- they know the keyboard and are able to do much more than I could have done, so ...
L:  Yeah.  Kids know a lot more than some adults. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] they do.  Well, my youngest she was on the computer at three and just going to town and --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and -- and I know a lot of parents, even some relatives, they worry about their kids, "Oh, they are going to do something that messes it up", and I didn't worry about that and she was, you know, surfing around and going through her games and -- and just learning, you know, with her phonics --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And basic math and ... 
L:  That's where my two year old is now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  She wants to get on the computer every -- every day. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, just because she wants to play a game on there.
R:  Sure.
L:  There's lot -- there's a lot more -- I think computer games are a lot -- you can't find that many educational games besides computer games.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] 
R:  Exactly.  So I'm all for it.
L:  I'm all for it, too.
R:  I'm all up for computers in the classroom and, like I say, I use them for doing demonstrations of math problems where you could graphically see --
L:  Yeah.
R:  --  equations and things, and they could learn.  You know, it worked better than me or them drawing them on the chalk board, I could project them on the screen with the computer and they could pick up the pattern so much more quickly.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  That way, and so it was a time saver.
L:  And they can see -- see a lot more instead of having a --
R:  For the teacher as well, for demonstrations.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, and it's, um, it's a lot easier to type a report on a computer than a typewriter.
R:  Yes. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  As a matter of fact my -- my -- one of my daughters got on my old typewriter --
L:  [MN] 
R:  And, "How come it doesn't work, mum?"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "How come they don't make ribbons any more?" [LAUGH]. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  We should even not even keep it around, but [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what -- we have one that we had to use every once in a while --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just -- 
R:  Well, I remember sitting and typing my reports on this old typewriter and --
L:  Yeah, and you have to type and if you mess up you have to start all over.
R:  Yeah, and plus you could come up with fancy fonts and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  It's -- it makes it funner, I think, even to do the report, that you can, you know, do the different colors and put in pictures and things like that, so. 
L:  That's what my son gets excited when he has to write reports because he gets to type them on the computer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, like, you know, and I think that's good whereas me, you know, I hated writing reports, because I knew I had to type them on the typewriter.
R:  Right.
L:  One time I mess up, you know, --
R:  That's it. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I've got to start all over. [MN] 
R:  All I know I -- my college room mate she used to ask me to type her reports --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- for her because she didn't know how and I did, and, so ... that's great that he's excited about doing the reports even.  That was always just, "Oh, not a report".  [SIGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] I'm sure it won't be that way a- after a couple of years. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I think they have fun searching for information.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Rather than having to look stuff up in the library.
L:  [MN]  Yeah, and it's a lot --
R:  I mean, they still do that too but there is so much more available -- 
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- and ... 
L:  [MN] Yeah, that's what --
R:  So ... 
L:  -- when they had to do their, like, they had to do the Presidents reports, they each got so much time to go --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on the internet every day and look up the stuff and he'd come home with tonnes of stuff.
R:  Mine were doing reports recently on -- on penguins and we actually found sites that had video clips.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Of the penguins and the sounds they make and -- you could never find that in the library before.
L:  Oh, no.  Not even in a movie half the time.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] I mean, nature movies but, you don't find those very easily.
R:  No.  They are not, you know, with the specific breed of penguin or variety of penguin they had and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  So they were having a great old time.
L:  [NOISE] Um, -- hold on.  Let's see, what else. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I think we've -- we both agree they're -- they're a definite asset to the classroom. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes, they are a asset to the classroom.
R:  And they just make learning more fun and exciting and -- and -- and again from the teacher's point of view using them as a reward for things.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  You know, you get time on the computer as a reward.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think they are a great tool for the teacher. 
L:  Great tool across a broad -- a broad range of stuff they can learn, too.  More than [NOISE] they had before. [NOISE] 
R:  Right.
L:  Without going to the library. [NOISE]  You can do most of your stuff at home or at school without [NOISE] going anywhere.
R:  Yes.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  It is right at your fingertips.
L:  [NOISE]  Um, I think we have a long time left.
R:  I know. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  It is not a controversial topic, so ... [LAUGH] 
L:  I know. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I can't really think of any drawbacks or --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- or problems with having them in the classroom, and -- 
L:  [MN]  Well, the only drawback I could see people thinking as, you know, playing games, they won't want their kids pl- -- if they play games or, you know.
R:  Right.  Well, I think, you know, being in --  in the classroom I think that's up to the teacher to monitor.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. 
R:  And keep control of and, again, on the other hand if a child's, you know, ca- she can use that as a reward.
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  You know, as long as they are monitoring the content -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that they are finding on the internet, and I think most schools employ a filter --
