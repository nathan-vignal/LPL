L:  Hello? 
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  Hey. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi, my name is Leah.
L:  My name is Gili.
R:  What's your name?
L:  Gili.  G.I.L.I.
R:  Oh -- oh, hi.
L:  Hi, hi.  Where are you right now?  Like, --
R:  I'm in San Francisco.
L:  Oh, I'm in LA. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?  Oh, cool.  I used to live in Orange County.
L:  Oh, cool. [LAUGH] Okay --
R:  Um, --
L:  -- so we have to talk about is family.  Um, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- tell me, are you married, um, kids --
R:  Yeah, I'm married and, um, I have a little girl who'll be two, ah, in June.  Her name's Chloe.
L:  Wow, that's so cute.
R:  Yeah, she's a total crack up and follows me everywhere, I can't go -- [LAUGH]
L:  And I can hear her. [LAUGH]
R:  -- can't go anywhere -- uh-huh.  I just walked out of the room, and she was, like, "I'm right behind you". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you have any kids, or husband --
L:  No, no.  Um, I got married, like, ah, I don't know, like ten months ago. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  So, I'm a newbie in this. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's cool.  Congratulations, so you're still a newlywed, huh?
L:  Ye- oh yeah. [LAUGH] So probably in, like, a year or so I'll, I'll have one of my own.  Yay. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's cool.  I got pregnant like, a couple of weeks after we got married. [LAUGH]
L:  Really?  Wow.
R:  Yeah, it was a big surprise.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think with all the wedding stuff I probably just forgot to take the pill or something. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's actually likely. [LAUGH]
R:  But it was funny, because everybody thought that, um, that we had -- I was already pregnant or something, which, I mean, if you do the math you could see that I wasn't, but people were expecting us --
L:  It's like, no, you couldn't have had her --
R:  -- to say -- yeah, people were saying, oh, you're probably going to have a pre- say she was premature or something.  But no.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  That is actually pretty cool.  So you started --
R:  Yes, a lot of fun.
L:  -- out your family right away.
R:  Yeah.  You know, it was funny, it's one of those things where if I had thought about it I would have -- I wouldn't of done it, but I'm so glad I did when, when we did it, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, she's just -- she's just a crack up.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And she wakes up, like, laughing and she just does, like, the funniest stuff, and --
L:  Oh, my God, that is so cool.
R:  -- she's a lot of fun.
L:  No, the thing is -- okay, to me, like my husband is, like, the center of my world. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But -- and right now -- and he's from Croatia, so our plan is to go over there at some point, 'cause he wants to visit his family.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And um, so basically we said, okay, once we actually go over there, we'll have -- after that we'll, we'll have kids. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow, that's so exciting though, to actually plan it and you know, wait --
L:  I know, I know. 
R:  -- for it to happen. [LAUGH]
L:  And since it's so far away, it's like, we can't really go for like, a week or two weeks, it's gotta be for like, a month, so...
R:  Oh wow, yeah.
L:  That's why we really have to think about it. [LAUGH] When we're going to do it.
R:  Did his family go to your wedding?
L:  Um, his family?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, his parents live --
R:  Were they able to come?
L:  His parents live here.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's mostly like his aunt, uncle, and his grandparents, and, and my family's from Chile, [LAUGH] so...
R:  Oh, really?  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  Wow, so you got lots of vacation spots. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, but, but that's the thing, it's like I have a lot of vacation spots, but for, like, the, the little holidays, like Easter, it's like, we were family-less.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Like my husband --
R:  But you have each other.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  And when you have your kid, that'll be like, your little family, like we used to --
L:  I know.
R:  -- his family -- my husband's family, they're all in San Diego, so like, we always have to go down there and stuff --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's just nice to kind of hang out with the three of us.
L:  I know.
R:  Like we're always, like, oh golly, you know, we've gotta go down there.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But --
L:  But at least that's like a drivable distance. [LAUGH] So that's good.
R:  It is, yeah.  Yeah, like, we're going down, um, in May.  So, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We've -- now that she's older, 'cause when she was little she hated the car.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  She would just scream her head off, and now we like, we wait 'til nighttime, and --
L:  [LAUGH] When she's asleep.
R:  And we just -- yeah, well right when, like around her bedtime and she goes to sleep, and then we drive half way and we have this hotel, or actually it's like a motel, like a Days Inn --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that we've been staying in for, like, four years, like, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- every time we drive down there we do it this way.  So it's kinda fun, you know.
L:  Wow. [LAUGH]
R:  So, you sound kind of like my age.  I'm twenty -- um, gosh, am I twenty seven?  Yeah, twenty seven.
L:  I'm twenty eight, yay.
R:  Oh, cool, yeah, I'll be twenty eight in October.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's weird, it goes by so fast, like I'm always thinking about her, I never -- I forgot that I exist, you know. [LAUGH] It's like, oh, I'm -- I have an age too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, --
L:  You know -- I kinda wish my husband's family was a little closer.  They, they used to live in, in San Pedro, then they moved to Ontario, then -- and then they moved to Texas, and then they moved -- where did they move?  Man, where are they right now?
R:  Wow, that's a lot of moving.
L:  Right now?  Right now they're in Birmingham, Alabama, and they're gonna be moving to Atlanta, like, in, I don't know, a couple of weeks. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow, really?
L:  So they're moving further and further away.
R:  Yeah, it's kinda hard, you know, like we don't get to go out very often, like, the rare times -- well not the rare times, but the -- most of the time when his mom comes up, you know, it's not for long enough time for us to --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- really go anywhere.  So I think we've actually gone out together maybe three times [NOISE] since Chloe's been here.  Maybe four, I don't know.  But he, he -- like, we like music a lot, so he goes to concerts and stuff, but I don't have anybody that I trust to leave her with --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so I just would rather not even go and be miserable, you know, wondering what she's doing.  We did go to one concert, um, about two months ago --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- when his mom came up.  His mom's pretty cool, like if she has time she'll come up --
L:  And take care of her.
R:  -- if we want -- really want to do something, but --
L:  Well, that -- that is cool.  That's really nice.  Does she fly out there, or --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, yeah, she flies out --
L:  Yeah, it's much easier.
R:  -- actually we had a concert we wanted to go to but then Travis' sister, um, that's my husband, she had just had a baby so she -- his mom was going over there, she lives in Oregon.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So that meant no show for us.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But ... 
L:  There's priorities.
R:  Yeah.  But you know, it --
L:  But at least -- but your daughter, like she recognizes Grandma, right?  And --
R:  Yeah, it's so cool, like before she didn't and now she knows, like, all of her grandparents, she can identify them from the pictures. [NOISE] [LAUGH] Do you hear her?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, she's being like, "Grandma, grandma".  Yeah, she likes the presents they give her, she'll grab them --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- she knows who gave them to her and stuff.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, she's so funny, like it's amazing how much they change in just like a month or --
L:  I know.  I have a nephew, he's like, he's gonna be three in August.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  And -- well, that's as close to a kid that -- you know, that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, and, and he's like, the first kid I've ever seen grow up from, like, the very beginning.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's so awesome.  See, that's so cool to experience before you have a kid, I think.  You know.
L:  I know --
R:  You get to see what it's like and stuff, and --
L:  Yeah, and I was, like, learning.  It's like, okay, he needs this kind of toy, and I can't push his parents to buy it for him, and like for example, I, I have like, this thing that kids need music.  And his parents are --
R:  Yep, that's so true.
L:  And his parents don't listen to music.  So like, I started, like --
R:  Really?
L:  -- pushing little things in there, little -- like, little guitars, and -- [LAUGH]
R:  It really helps them with math, too.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Like in later years, you know.  Like, they've done, like, tons of studies and stuff.  Like they say drums are the best instrument, um, to help with math.
L:  [LAUGH] It's like, -- and, and they always say that parents end up hating the drums, but --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it's good for the kid.
R:  Yeah, well then that's --
L:  So that --
R:  -- it's good he's got you for an aunt then, you can buy all the stuff that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they don't get. [LAUGH]
L:  Too bad I can't see him often.  'Cause he's -- right now he's moving, he's moving with my -- what do you call them, in laws?
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I don't know, parents with, with my husband's parents.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're all moving together, 'cause, well, um, my -- okay, my nephew is my hu- is, is the son of my husband's sister --
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  -- but right now she -- the father's baby is not with them, so she's moving with her parents.
R:  Oh, darn.
L:  So.
R:  Oh, that's sad.
L:  So I don't get to see him that often. [LAUGH] But the kid's damn cute. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, gosh, I love kids at this age.  Like, I mean, they can talk and, like, she makes her wants and needs known, you know, and she's just so full -- like, so vocal and just -- she's so -- like, it's amazing how smart little kids are.
L:  I know.  I know.  And it's -- like, some things that you, that you honestly don't think that they will understand, that they --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- don't know what it is, but they do.
R:  Yeah, you really have to watch what you say around her too, because she will say something and you'll think that she'll have forgotten about it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and [NOISE] like, she'll -- a week later she'll still be saying it, you know, like, oh man, you know.  But she just won't stop.
L:  You know one time I took my nephew out, and we went to the park.  And there were these kids on the slide and they were swearing a lot, and, um, then [LAUGH] when we go home and he, he was walking and then he tripped, and he swore.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I was like, "Oh, my God, no, you learned that word?"  No. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Out of all the words.  I felt really bad.
R:  Yeah, Chloe learned those from my husband.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And she won't -- and it's funny, she knows -- she uses them all in the right context too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's, it's so funny, like I really shouldn't laugh
