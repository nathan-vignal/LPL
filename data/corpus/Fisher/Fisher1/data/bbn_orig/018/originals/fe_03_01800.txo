L:  Hello? 
R:  Hi, how are you? 
L:  Hi.  My name's Cricket, I'm from Southern California.
R:  Hi, my name is Johan, and I live in Illinois.  I'm from Yugoslavia originally.
L:  Oh, right.  Great.  Okay, so our com- our topic is, ah, computers in the school system.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, well I think it's a great thing.  I think that, um, the, the kids need to know everything they can about computers because the way technology is, and by the time they get, ah, grown up or our age, everything is going to be automated, everything's run by computers.  And if they don't learn it at a, a young age, I mean, they're, they're gonna be stuck.  They're gonna be left out in the dark.  Um, I just -- I think it's a great thing.  Um, how 'bout you?
R:  Yeah, I agree.  But I have some little disagreement -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- with computer.  Because when you're on computers you only learn like some proceeds, you know, press this button, press this button, press this, and, like, in that -- the statistic disciplines, you simply don't need to know, like formal or for anything else.  Is simply like putting, putting data in the system and the system do everything for you.  But you don't -- don't know the principles.
L:  Right, right.  Well, I understand that, but in the, in the school system, um, kids on computers, they learn how to type, they learn motor skills, ah, a lot of the children, ah, have attention deficit problems these days, we can't keep them interested, and I would think instead of having them, you know, running wild in the classroom not learning anything, that there's so many programs through the computers out there that would keep their interest, that that way they would at least be learning something, you know.
R:  Yes, that's true.
L:  Um, ah, also being here in California, we do have a lot of computers in the school system, um, you know how we have to pay for -- generally you pay for books or paper and everything --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- year after year after year, or the teachers are having to print out, ah, tests or assignment type things, well if they have the computers, um, I think that's gonna save a lot of money, because everything's gonna be right there on the computer, they don't have to have paper, pencil, um, print outs for tests, they can enter everything right there into the computer, um, well that's gonna save a bunch of money, because it's -- you know, and it's always gonna be there on the computer so they don't have to keep redoing and redoing and redoing, you know, by --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, having to print out stuff, and --
R:  Yeah.  You only have the expense to buy the computer.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Sometimes it's time to upgrades.
L:  Right, right.  Right.
R:  I mean, that's also not cheap, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I'm in computers, they only last three, four, five, six years --
L:  Right, same here. 
R:  -- then you need to buy a new one.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I don't think that's gonna [LAUGH] too much savings.
L:  Well, the only reason you really have to buy new ones, um, pretty much is if you use up your hard drive or your memory, or you're on the internet.  Now in the schools, I mean, sure they have some classes or whatever that might be internet related, but generally, um, the kids aren't even on the internet.  Um, and for what they're using the computers for, you really don't have to upgrade unless you're, ah, changing, ah, the tests or the programs or what they're leaning.  I mean, you know, we could be using the old four eighty sixes right now to sit down and take the same test that somebody took ten years ago.
R:  [SIGH] Yes --
L:  You, you know, so they're really -- I don't think that there's an upgrade issue, um, you know, as for computers in the schools.  Not really.
R:  Well, I have know about Illinois, some schools, because I was learning the English.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So I was the some [inaudible] like.  I was in college having classes, but I was also like in some elementary schools having classes because they don't have enough space.
L:  Right.
R:  So they can like old computers, like four eighty six, and they can do more or less anything with them.
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  They're, like, too behind.
L:  Yeah.  Well, they're too behind, why?  Because -- only if they're on the internet.  If you're just using, ah, a computer for word processing, ah, type things, which most of the schools that's what they're doing, um, you know, they're just running some program or, or test, or having them read some information, um, why would you have to upgrade the computer to be able to just, you know, do basic things?
R:  Yeah, but, but you have other things, not only the word processing.  I think computers can do lot more.  So --
L:  Right, they can do a lot more, but it's a matter of whether the school's going to be having those computers do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, whether they're going to actually be doing on those computers.  You know, as long as they're not surfing around the internet, or they're doing major graphic programs or playing games, or, or you know, video type stuff like that, um, the upgrade on a -- a system like that, um, would be minimal.  You know, um, -- what, every five years you might have to upgrade a computer, um, and by then they'd just trade them in and, and, you know, new ones come out, and it's probably a tax write off for somebody somewhere. [LAUGH] You know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, and by having computers in the schools, ah, also keep other people, ah, employed, people that have to come in and maintain the computers, set up the networking, ah, --
R:  Yeah, the, the --
L:  -- you know, as you said, there -- if they need upgrades, so it's not just a matter of, ah, the kids getting benefit from it, it's, ah, actually benefitting different, ah, branches of society as a whole, you know.  Um, -- I don't know, I think computers in, in the schools is a great thing.  We have them in a -- most if all the schools right here in California.  Um, they've got some kind of computer lab at least in, in the school itself.  I think it would be great that every child had its own, um, computer, you know, at least monitor into the network at their desk.  You know, the heck with the books, get rid of the books, get rid of the paper and pencil, and um, there it is.  It's --
R:  Yes --
L:  -- right there.
R:  Yeah, is, is only wrong that they gonna put some memory chip in the future in the kid's brain --
L:  Right, right.  Right, right, right, right.  Right.
R:  They're gonna end it in that way.
L:  Well, you know, memory chips are gonna be cheaper than having to replace books every year or, as I said, you know, printing out the, the information for each student, ah, for each semester, ah, and on down the line.  Here in California when a kid goes to school, the school supplies the paper, pencil, you know, and things like that for them.  I know, um, other --
R:  Yeah, that, that could be expensive, hundreds --
L:  Right then.  That does get expensive --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- extremely expensive.  But that's something they do here in California now.  You know, you get the computers in on in to each desk, and you don't have to do that, every year, supply supplies for each child.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Huh?
R:  Yeah, that's true.  I know -- I was working for [several inaudible words] and during, like, back to school people are spending enormous amounts of money on supplies. 
L:  Oh, huge.  I remember I was -- I grew up in Washington and, you know, every year my mom had -- would go out for school supplies for the three kids in the house, and I mean, and it's just outrageous, ah, the things that you have to pay for school supplies now.  If the schools had the computers, I mean, they'd be saving people money, it, it'd be employing people, and at the same time, ah, educating our children on the ways of the future, 'cause that's just the way it's gonna be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, we're running out of trees to make paper, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  So, I -- I'm not -- I think there's a lot of good benefits.
R:  Yeah, but see, we are also running out of the sources for the electricity in a way.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So what's gonna be rely -- [LAUGH]
L:  Well, we're gonna run off the sun, and all computers are gonna be solar powered here soon. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  I hope so. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you know, we got the little calculators and things like that, there's no reason why --
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  -- it can't happen that way.
R:  Yeah, they can, but I think they still don't wanna put that to the market.
L:  Yeah.  You know, the, the technology isn't as fast as, ah, change is, you know.  Anything is possible.
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you're in California, at least you have a lot of sun.  We don't have that much in Illinois. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, I just spoke with somebody in New York, and you know, ah, they don't have computers in any of the schools down there.  Well, you know, California, we're probably the most modern state in the United States, and I'm down here in San Diego, ah, the richest -- ah, most expensive place to live in the [LAUGH] United States, darn near, you know, --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- so our kids, um, probably benefit because they do have more than other places, so I guess I gotta look at it that way too.  I mean, we've got great schools and great, ah, SAT scores coming out of our schools down here, and that's because of the way, um, the school systems are able to supply and teach and, you know, provide for our children in, in a classroom structure.  So, you know, I'm sure it's -- it seems like it's pretty different down here than it is everywhere else, so I just have to --
R:  Ah, could be.
L:  Yeah.  You know.  But I think everybody should be like we are. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, in the future I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  In the future, yes.  You guys will catch up with us. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I mean --
L:  You know.
R:  -- it takes time, but.
L:  Right.  In the meantime you know, our children, um, are learning, um, at a faster rate, I hate to say, than, um, possibly the children in your schools, you know, which to me is, is kinda sad, you know.  Um, I think children in all schools should have the same advantage, you know.  I think all the -- all the schools everywhere should be run the same.  Everybody should have the same.  Not, ah, our kids get better education than yours --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, because we've got more.  I mean, it -- which that's, you know, that's not, ah, good, that's kind of a downfall there.  Um, you know, if everybody could -- can afford the computers or at least be the same, then all the kids would, um, grow up learning the same things, you know.  I guess that's the difference between going to an expensive college or just a community college too, at the same time.  You know.
R:  Well, in a way yes, but you know, you're gonna learn
