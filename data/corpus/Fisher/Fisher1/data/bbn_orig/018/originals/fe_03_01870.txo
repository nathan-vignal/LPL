L:  Hi, my name is Stacey. 
R:  Hi, my name is Nancy. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  This is my first call, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Mine too.
R:  Oh, good. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Um, well, tell me about your family, what family means to you. 
L:  Okay, well, um, I have four children.  I've got -- I've got one at each stage.  I've got a sixteen year old, I've got one that will be twelve in November, I have one that just turned two, ah, last week, and I've got one that will be four in August.
R:  Wow. [LAUGH]
L:  So, um, -- [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I got a whole lot of family.
R:  Yeah, you do. 
L:  Um, family to me with my -- with my children, um, and in -- in this day and age, ah, to me, ah, is -- is keeping them busy.  Idle hands, ah, causes them to -- the world wouldn't probably be such a bad place if -- if -- if -- if parents took more time to put them in classes [NOISE], to put them in dance, to put them in gymnastics, to put them in softball, they wouldn't have the, um, the time to get in half the trouble half these kids get into. [NOISE]  So, um, as far as what family means to me is -- is -- is -- is -- is everybody coming together, everybody getting along, ah, everybody putting differences aside during holidays, um, [NOISE] being able to stay home -- I mean, that's a big issue [NOISE], you know, being able to -- my first two I -- I wasn't able to stay home with.
R:  Oh.
L:  And these two I -- I -- finally [NOISE] I was able to stay home with, so that was -- and watch them grow.  So this has been a, you know, a really -- a real new experience for me, because my first two were four and a half years apart and these two are sixteen -- a big sixteen months apart.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So one just quit touching and the other one is touching everything.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you have any children?
R:  I totally get that.  Yeah, I have three.  I have a set of two year old twins and a five year old.
L:  Oh, my goodness! 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my goodness!  
R:  So I get that. 
L:  So you've got two of them touching everything.
R:  Yeah, and I have, ah, I have a seventeen year old stepson but he's not living with us now, but, um, yeah, I get that whole -- the whole different -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- range of what they're doing.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I -- the same thing with the idle hands.  Boy, I mean, you just leave to go to the bathroom and they coordinate and all of a sudden they're emptying out toy boxes in two different rooms [LAUGH] and there's a new door every day we find with crayon on the back of it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, mine are washing dishes in the bathroom sink these days. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, that's kind of fun.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, that's -- that's her -- that's one of my -- Savannah's newest thing is to wash the dishes and the --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- Brandon -- she was washing dishes in the sink and Brandon thought, "Well, I'm not tall enough for the sink, so I'll just watch mine in the toilet".
R:  Oh, there you go.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, water's really popular and we had to get those toilet locks because --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I would go in there and it would be moving, so I knew there was an arm or something in there and I -- yeah, I think family is about keeping them busy and y- -- you're right about the -- getting them involved -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in stuff, especially my five year old, getting her away from her brother  [LAUGH] and sister sometimes.
L:  [NOISE] Definitely.
R:  I think just doing stuff together, too.  Like, a lot of families don't do stuff together.
L:  Yeah, they're -- [NOISE] they're -- you know, that's -- that's true because on the weekends I see a lot of, ah, [NOISE] -- I see a lot of people that, ah, well, she'll go do her thing and he'll go play golf. [NOISE]  
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  And, you know, the kids, "Well, whatever you guys can make plans to do with what your friends [NOISE] are doing", or whatever, and it's, ah, [NOISE] you know, [inaudible] on the weekends we have a pontoon boat. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, neat.
L:  So we get on the pontoon boat [NOISE] and we get, ah, food and we get a -- um, we've got a, like, a little tow behind, um, inner tube and we hook it to the back of the pontoon and it's something that everybody can enjoy.
R:  Oh, that sounds fun.
L:  [NOISE] So, you know, it -- it's -- it's just the time -- it's just -- thirteen, twelve, ah, three, and two trying to find everybody that's -- something that's in common.
R:  Yeah, there's no common denominator there. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  And so you find something.
L:  Yeah, for them to do is a struggle, and, ah, so being on the water they -- they all love being on the water so that worked for us. [NOISE] Here Brandon.
R:  Oh, that does sound like fun now.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  We've just -- I stick mine in the backyard on the weekend but, even -- even just watching them play --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and stuff or trying to be involved.  I stayed home with the twins when they were born and just went back part time this year.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, my goodness.  I couldn't imagine. [NOISE]
R:  But it is har- -- it is hard.  I mean, you know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I don't -- I'm -- I'm glad, though, in a way 'cause when I'm at home I feel, like, if it's all day long it's just -- you'd never get ahead --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I kind of get frustrated and when I have, like, the morning to be with grown ups.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And then [LAUGH], it helps me a little bit, I think, at this stage until they are a little older. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I'm sure.  How old are they?
R:  They're double trouble.  They just turned two. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.  And how old's the other one? 
R:  Five, just turned five.
L:  Just turned five.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Well, we've got -- 
R:  She's going to kindergarten.
L:  Is that one in school?
R:  Um, yeah, she's in -- while I work --
L:  [NOISE]  
R:  -- she goes to preschool and the other two -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- go three days a week and then they stay with grandma. 
L:  Oh.
R:  But it gets them -- they are doing that, ah, not -- not real --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, their talking is a little delayed and I think they are doing a lot of that twin talk.
L:  Oh, they're talk- -- yeah, the -- the one -- they only know -- understand each other?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  One of them does, she's branched out to where she's actually --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- developing her vocabulary, but the other one doesn't and she's, like, the only one who understands her.
L:  They're both girls? [NOISE]
R:  No, boy girl.
L:  And her -- the little girl is more advanced in talking? 
R:  Yep.
L:  [NOISE] You know what, I had -- I have three girls, my last one being a boy, and I -- I foun- -- I've found that, um, that, um, um, my girls have all excelled quicker than the boys.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think -- you know, you've always heard that girls mature quicker than boys. [NOISE]
R:  They're more focused or something.
L:  [NOISE] And -- and it's my girls talked first and Brandon is just now [NOISE] he's -- he's now starting to, "Mommy's there, mommy's there", and this kind of stuff. [NOISE] My other girls were, like, reading their books and things like that by -- [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- by four, so I think it's -- honestly, I think girls -- that -- that's -- that's a fact, that must be a fact.
R:  Yeah, it must be true 'cause -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he's more physical but actually his twin sister, she's -- she's got a lot of agility.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So she gets into more trouble -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- climbing things and stuff, but he likes to break and throw.  That's [LAUGH] pretty much where we are.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Break the heads off things and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- throw them across the room.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And he is obsessed with trains and neither one of them are obsessed --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- with anything.  So our world revolves around when we can encounter some kind of train.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  In a book, on TV, at the -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- mall, it doesn't matter.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  He's like, "Train", all the time and neither one of them ever had an obsession.  They just -- they kind of like a lot of different things but he's so overly focused on this train thing I'm just about to go bananas.  [LAUGH] I've never met a kid like that but I guess they're out there. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah everybody, I guess, they -- they -- they pick everything different. [NOISE] All right, I'm coming sweetie. 
R:  Yeah, I've heard after the train thing, because he's the kind of kid that does that, it will just be -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- something else. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. 
R:  That's what my friends tell me.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Mi- -- 
R:  Maybe it will be super heroes or --
L:  Ah, you see, mine's -- mine went from, um, Bob the Builder to Sponge Bob Square Pants.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  An obsession with Sponge Bob Square Pants now.
R:  Yeah, mine like Sponge Bob but they -- my little guy has, um, Sponge Bob -- I mean, ah, Bob the Builder pajamas and that's really the only thing Bob the Builder that he likes.  He won't take them off in the morning.  I have to --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- come up with some weird thing to get his pajamas off.  But he's holding that shirt on and I'm trying to pull it off because it's got Bob.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But on TV they like Sponge Bob better. [LAUGH]  Yeah, you should see my mornings, they're very interesting. [LAUGH]
L:  That's it.  I'm doing real good with, ah, with potty training my Brandon with the [NOISE] Bob the Builder panties.
R:  How old is he?
L:  Because -- he's two. [NOISE]
R:  Wow!
L:  And [NOISE] -- and I got them -- well, I figured just that, [NOISE] I bought the Bob the Builder panties and right in the very front [NOISE] would be Bo -- was Bob -- a standing Bob.  So I told him, I said, "You can't pee pee on Bob". [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it has [NOISE] -- and it has worked. [LAUGH] [NOISE] So he doesn't pee on Bob.
R:  Has he been two long? 
L:  [NOISE] I -- [NOISE] I've -- I've just --  he decided he wanted, because his sister, you know, is three.
R:  That's so neat.  
L:  [NOISE]  And she uses the potty so he wants to use the potty.  
R:  Oh, see mine have no interest whatsoever. [LAUGH]
L:  But I -- I thought it was hilarious [NOISE], I bought those undies 'cause I just wanted to see him in little boy -- [NOISE] I've never had a little boy, I wanted to see him in undies.  
R:  Yeah, the little boy underwear.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, so I got them and I'm, like, you know, "There's Bob", and he's -- he'll put them on and he'll go, [NOISE] "Bob, Bob".  And I say, [NOISE] "Now, don't pee on Bob's head".  [NOISE] Savannah, quit picking at him.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Quit picking at him. [NOISE] 
R:  Boy, that sounds like my house.
L:  You ought to hear when they're all home together. [LAUGH]
R:  Mine are asleep.  Well, two of mine are asleep, the other one is just, ah, -- 
L:  I wish mine would sleep but, ah, --
R:  I think they get worn out from, um, --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- going to school three days a week.  I -- it just seems like they sleep better since they started doing that.  Only a little morning program but it really ge- -- they really come home they're ready for a nap, that kind of thing and -- the other one, she probably should take one but she doesn't so she's just kind of evil 'til bedtime. [LAUGH]
L:  See, I'm -- I'm so scared of putting mine in day care 'cause I'm -- I don't know where you're at but I'm in Florida.
R:  Oh, I'm in North Carolina.
L:  And, um, we've had so many things, [NOISE] one of the day care centres left a four year old girl -- I think she was four -- they -- they went on a field trip, came back and forgot her.
R:  Oh.
L:  And at Florida, it's, like, two hundred degrees down here, this was last summer, by the time they found her she had passed.
R:  Can you imagine? 
L:  She got -- she -- no.  So, and, you know, it's -- it's -- I'm scared to death of day care.   
R:  We don't -- 
L:  Scared to death of day care.
R:  Well, I teach in a preschool and they -- they're down the hall in, like, a little toddler class.
L:  Oh, so you're --
R:  But I am really, oh, no -- see I -- I can't go back to work full time or anything.  I can't put them in day care, I won't do it.  My mom keeps them a couple of days a week but it's like, yeah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my husband and I have discussed this, and one of them has asthma and every time he gets sick he gets really sick, so I just kind of -- this has been a little bit of a stretch and he has missed more school than his twin sister. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, yeah, I keep my eye on them all day, and, like, any issues come up, boy, I'm, like, all over it. [LAUGH] And, see, that's 'cause I'm right there, but I -- I wouldn't have them going somewhere where I wasn't -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, right there.  Because of those things.  You can't trust other people, not with your kids.
L:  [NOISE]  It's -- it's just -- it's really not -- I watched it on, I think the last show that I watched on this made me completely ill, was the Oprah show or one of those shows and --
R:  Oh.
L:  And here was this grandma, she looked like some -- I mean, she just looked like somebody's grandma.  And, um, you know, children how they latch to their mommies before they go to leave, it was -- it seemed kind of normal but this child was grabbing its mother, like, "She's going to kill me when you leave".
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and the woman --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- had set up, ah, a VHS in her home o- -- on top of the microwave where it pointed directly toward the play pen.  Soon as this woman walked out the door she started screaming and cussing at this child.
R:  Oh!
L:  [NOISE] She was hitting her on top of the head with a newspaper [NOISE], bouncing balls off of her head, and then she said --
