L:  Hi, I'm Holly. 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Hi, I'm Marylouise.
L:  Hi Mary [COUGH].
R:  It's Marylouise [LAUGH]  
L:  Oh, I'm sorry [MN] --
R:  It's all one word. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Okay [NOISE] um, so, [NOISE] --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- as far as computers go in education, um, [NOISE] I think -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that they're important [NOISE] um, that, you know, the internet does require reading probably a whole lot more reading than they would do watching TV. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  And -- 
R:  -- Yeah, and it opens -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- opens a whole new world -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a lot of information's available that would not be normally available -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- ah, to the run of the mill child -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, I don't know if you live in a big town -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- or a small town, but I live in a pretty small town -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the local library just can't keep up. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, ...  
L:  I live in a pretty small town too but [NOISE] um, the -- the closest library you have to drive to, it's about twenty minutes away and --  
R:  Well, yeah, that would be the same here -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and -- and that would mean I would have to provide transportation for the most part --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, it makes it a lot more convenient.
L:  Right.  I think [COUGH] as far as them being in the schools I think that's great because if they don't have a computer at home then [NOISE] they're at least taught the basics and, um, once they get to high school and start taking even more, um, involved computer classes and internet classes [NOISE] I know my son is in [NOISE] the fifth grade and he takes -- and he has, um, internet access at school, um, I know it is protected and everything else and I think it's great for him.  Although we have computers [NOISE] at home [COUGH] and he does most of his, um, [NOISE] computer stuff here but, um -- but there are computers at school and for kids that don't have access at home [NOISE] that's -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- an excellent --
R:  Yes, and they -- and they have improved as far as, ah, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ah, making sure that they have enough available.  M- my daughter is nineteen but I have my niece and nephew that live with me --  
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- um, and they're eleven and seven and -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- when my daughter went to elementary school --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- you know, they had, like, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- two computers and you got -- every other week you got to get fifteen minutes on it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Wow.
R:  So, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, so, it was, ah, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] even in high school, ah, you know, it was -- it was limited -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- she graduated last year, it was limited because of the number of computers and I know now that they're expanding but they still haven't reached the point where -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- everybody -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that needs to have access to a computer.  I mean I -- I look for the day when everybody has as computer -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- at their desk and they're -- the teacher is there and the computer is there and they work.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  Write on the computer? 
R:  Right -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- at the same time -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- with the lecturers, the --  
L:  Mhm.   
R:  -- the -- the visuals, um, I -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I think that would, you know, work out excellently.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I've seen, um, now -- my son was having some issues with reading in elementary school and, um, [NOISE] I bought some programs to help him with reading and he happened to like -- like, ah, you know mummies and Egyptian stuff --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and there just happened to be this program for reading that involved Egyptians -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and I was like, "Oh, this would be perfect", you know, and his reading grade in six months went up, um, an entire grade level [NOISE] and thanks to computers, you know, which I wouldn't have been able to do [NOISE] on my own and no teacher would have been able to do.
R:  Right, because they -- they geared it to -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- something he was very interested in.  That's excellent.
L:  Right, and in -- in my opinion -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- education and computers are great for education -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- because they are interactive -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they make it fun -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and, um, kids can -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- kids learn better when it is fun anyway and anything that is hands on where they actually -- other than writing, the only thing is [NOISE] is that they don't write as much if they're typing instead, um, but I think -- I think that with the new -- with the new, ah, the new way things are now, it's [MN] you know, writing is -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- becoming somewhat obsolete, although reading -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  Is becoming more of a [NOISE] ah, necessity, you know, because of the internet.  You have to read [NOISE] --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to be on the internet and that was an incentive [NOISE] I used for my son.  [NOISE] I said, "Well you have to read to be able to get your codes for your video games on the internet".  [LAUGH]  
R:  That's the -- the only thing that I see with the two younger ones is, ah, an all out -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they -- they get addicted to it, you know -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- you have to really set limits and it's very difficult to set the limits --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, because they want to be on it -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- mor- you know, morning noon and night and -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- some of it's for the -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- right reason and then some of it's just the video games -- 
L:  [MN]  
R:  -- and, you know, I think that -- I think that it's, ah, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they confuse -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the -- they just look at it [MN] as -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- if -- all of it as -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- fun and games. 
L:  Right.
R:  And w- while that does peak their interest it also, um, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I mean my, ah, my niece is -- is somewhat overweight and [LAUGH] I just don't think she gets out enough, you know, she's not outside -- I mean when we were kids we walked, we did this, and we did --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- you know, we were outside playing constantly and I just  -- I do see where that has a tendency -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to be a problem because I don't care what they say -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- these kids have a mind of their own no matter how many rules you send down -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.   
R:  -- you know, [LAUGH] they don't listen -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and they can be very stubborn. [LAUGH]  
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Indeed you got that right.  I mean my son is a little overweight now, um, and thank [NOISE] God though he has sparked in -- he's a -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a boy scout and me and him do that together so, that -- that provides a lot of, um, [NOISE] exercise in the summer and, um, if you get him interested in some sort of outdoor activity usually that will get them to go outside and get, you know --  
R:  Yeah, but I think it depends on the child too -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- my -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like I said, my niece it -- I mean it is like the computer -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that is like her thing -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, with the, um, you know -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [MN] I monitor it but it -- it -- it -- and I limited it but it just -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I mean I find -- I fear getting up in the middle of the night and she gets on the computer for whatever reason.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, to go to the bathroom --  
L:  [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  -- so, that, you know [LAUGH] and I know that's not for educational purposes.
L:  No, she's probably -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- checking her email.
R:  Or something --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, something -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and it just, you know, it's like I said [MN] even though they're -- and -- and I have a --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't know about you, I have this real -- I mean I know there is these guards that you -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- can put on, these pro- programs that you can -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- put on, but I have a real, um. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- fear of downloading things because of the spy availability when you --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- download something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- So [LAUGH] you know [MN] I mean even programs that you buy just don't -- I -- I don't know maybe I'm a pessimist, I just don't trust, you know -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- anything, I mean -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- really have to have a, ah, a lot of word of mouth and a lot of, um, um, -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- checking into and a lot of -- you know, a lot of experts -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that are wiser as me as far as, you know, how these people can get into things because I know when I get on all of a sudden I have this -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I have this new, ah, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- new bar up or, you know, something and I s- I never put that on there -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- how did that get there? 
L:  Right.
R:  So, you know, you just -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, you just [MN] and -- and I did a -- a couple of checks -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- about like porn and -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and there's these porn sites.  Nobody here -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- visits porn sites [LAUGH] I mean where are they coming from --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, you know, so, you know, that I do have, um, a somewhat of a fear of and you know there's -- there's that --
L:  Right.  
R:  -- that kind of hesitancy with it but, you know, I still pretty much -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, allow them because I think that in the future -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if they don't have, ah, education on how to -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- how to work a computer, how to understand some of it, I -- I just wish the schools -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- would get a little more -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, my daughter was majoring in that -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- when she went to college --  
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]  
R:  -- and I noticed that -- that -- I mean even though she knew a lot -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- about web design -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and she still didn't know the meat a- about like how those programs get -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- downloaded --  
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  -- you know? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and it's like I think that there's -- there's this -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- basic -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- what -- everybody should know and that ought to be introduced, you know, -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in the elementary schools. 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- ah, you know, aside from just clicking here and clicking there, I think they need to have some of kind of, ah, understanding -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of the mechanics.
L:  Right.  [NOISE] And I think, um, [NOISE] a lot of the extra curricular, like boy scouts, which I consider part of a ch- -- part of a child's education [NOISE] or a girl scout's [NOISE] um, and as part of a child's education as well as school, um, but in school they teach my son practically nothing, but with boy scouts as far as computers go he learns twice as much. 
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, I mean he -- well, I'm a web designer anyway.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] okay.   
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Good, I'm gonna ask ya -- g- get -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- your number, I can ask you all these questions when I --
L:  [NOISE] I --
R:  -- when I get these stupid things [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- I get all these -- you know, I'm a computer geek and, um, so -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- with boy scouts and stuff my son learns a whole lot more because he wants to get his computer mayor badge or his internet patch and things like [NOISE] that and so, as far as education as far as the internet goes and stuff like that now in school they teach them safety, they teach them basic [NOISE] how to receive and send e-mail --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they teach them how to save files like in [NOISE] Word and -- and simple programs, but they don't teach them anything about HTML, they don't teach them anything about, you know, [NOISE] th- they just don't and I think they should know more and [NOISE] I think [NOISE] schools should have AOL because AOL will block any kind of porn, um, if you set the settings right [NOISE] um, if you set the parental controls and sh-
