R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Ah, I'm Robert Dah[?]. 
L:  I'm Shaquoti[?]. 
R:  What was that again?
L:  Shaquoti. 
R:  Shaquoti. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes, okay.  Um, I think they goofed.  This is the second time I've got a call today.
L:  This is the second time I have too.
R:  Oh, okay.  So I wonder why they're doing that.
L:  I don't know.  You know how much we get paid for this?
R:  Well, that's all right.
L:  Okay. 
R:  Um, um, and, ah, as far as computers harming or helping education, um, I guess it depends on the individual.  Um, I have, um, two sons who -- or two grandsons who are home schooled --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and ah, the, the one is just like kindergarten or pre kindergarten or whatever.  Kindergarten, I guess.  Ah, but, ah, doesn't do a lot.  But the other one is several grades up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah, he is doing almost all of his classes on the computer now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They've bought computer programs and do it.  And, ah, it's good in some ways because he can, he can go ahead and, ah, checks his answers that he puts in, you know, as he goes along on the lesson -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- tells him whether it's right or wrong.  Ah, but a, a kid has to be self motivated to do some [LAUGH] of that stuff too, or someone watching over them all the time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you have any experience with, ah, --
L:  Of course.  I'm a college student.  Um, I think it's ben- beneficial that we have, like, computers, using them and stuff, because it helps me, you know, find stuff that I need help from to be able to type and everything.  You know, I think it's a part of, you know, education and, and it's going to be for a long time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's the way I feel about it.
R:  It probably depends a lot on, on the individual.  If you, if you look things up, ah, go in and, and study and, ah, ah, try to get informations on subjects --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- that's really good.  Ah, some individuals would not pursue it as far as others, I'm sure.  
L:  Yeah, I know what you're talking about.  That's just like if it's of benefit to me -- I mean a benefactor to me in a way because, like, my car just broke down and I'm not going to have any way to get back and forth to, um, school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I'm taking all my classes on line through the computer.
R:  Oh, so you're doing that from home?
L:  Yes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's a good thing, because like the school is actually like sixty miles away and I was driving that until I -- my, um, car broke down.  So, it's a benefactor.
R:  Mhm.  I, I have a couple of friends who are studying for the ministry, and they're actually pastoring churches but still studying to be ordained, and, and ah, they're both doing it on line -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- right while they pastor.  And, ah, so that, ah, it costs the same amount of money, but they're, they're working a full time job while they're doing it [LAUGH] too.
L:  Yeah, it's like you can do that at your own pace, any time of the night or whatever, or on the weekend, you don't have to worry about sitting in a class for hours and hours and missing work and stuff, when you can, um, you know, do both of them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's the benefactor of it too.
R:  Now, ah, can, ah, can you get all of the subjects that you need?
L:  All the subjects, like, on line?  No, not that -- not at the school that I go to, not all the subjects, but at different schools some of them have all the on line subjects.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So ...
R:  That's what I wondered.  Now, these particular individuals I know can -- are getting all of their subjects --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and, ah, and they in fact are -- live -- both live in Pennsylvania and are enrolled in a school in Colorado -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, and can get everything.  But, ah, you in turn can only get part of them, then you'll have to go to the school to finish up, won't you?
L:  Yeah.  I was planning to go back, because that's what my job is, so they understand right now.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know.  My car broke down and stuff.  I was planning to go back, though.
R:  Now, does it still cost you the same amount for that?
L:  Um, I think fifteen dollars extra.
R:  Oh, it costs extra.
L:  That's it, just fifteen dollars extra.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Per class, so that's like, um, sixty dollars.  That's it.
R:  Now, now, if you have a problem, can, can you get it resolved, ah, --
L:  On line, or go through the --
R:  Yeah, yeah.  If you're having trouble understanding something, or, ah, --
L:  You can go through the, um, go through our offices or her office and they can talk to you about it.
R:  But you, you can't get it, ah, from home?
L:  From home?  Oh yeah, you can get from home.
R:  Oh.
L:  Either way they'll help you, that's just like, um, when I didn't have on line classes, but we can talk to our instructor on line or whatever, and if we had any questions or needed any help, we -- he would email us and stuff.
R:  I see.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah, so that worked out pretty good.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  Ah, I know, ah, I had a couple of granddaughters that were en- enrolled in a, ah, computer on line school last year.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, that didn't, ah, work out too good.  They, um, -- the, ah, school itself, it was a charter school, and they were having difficulty getting the money to operate.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, ah, they, they ended up having to bow out of it because it just didn't work out for them.
L:  Wow.
R:  It sounded like an excellent idea.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they, they were set -- they were, ah, giving computers to each student and, ah, ah, you know, sending disks and things and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- doing everything on line.
L:  Well I guess it's good if they can see if the school have accreditation or something.
R:  Yeah, well they were just trying to get started and they were -- they were having financial trouble.  They had, ah, --
L:  Did they have a grant?
R:  Ah, it was a Pennsylvania charter school that was supposed to be paid for from the districts where the students enrolled from.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, but a lot of the districts were balking about giving up the money and sending it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it caused a great shortfall, and, ah, they couldn't pay their teachers and it just, just ran into financial trouble.
L:  Yeah, I understand where you're coming from on that.
R:  But I think this on line would, ah, I think, ah, computer education will probably be the thing of the future, and I think it will be -- it's, ah, good.
L:  Yeah.  I think so too.
R:  Especially if you have a, a wide choice, a wide variety of, of subjects, and, ah, can get all the help that you need.
L:  Yeah.  That, that's a good benefit.  Yep.
R:  So I, I, I expect it will, ah, --
L:  My -- I do the same. 
R:  Ah, what state are you in?
L:  Florida.
R:  Pardon?
L:  Florida.
R:  Florida?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  I could tell, it's a little -- sound a little more southern.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  [LAUGH] I can tell that.
L:  It's that bad?
R:  Well, that's not bad, that's good.  That's all right.
L:  What state are you in?
R:  Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Mhm.  Well, ah, would you continue that, if you could get all your subjects?
L:  Yes, I would.  So I can work more hours.
R:  Um, I suppose there are some schools that you can do that.
L:  Yeah, there are some schools.
R:  I'm not, ah, sure which ones, where they are, but, ah, I, I definitely know there are some that, ah, I've heard of that do that.
L:  Yeah.  There's some schools that does all of them.  Like Alabama AMU, Alabama State, [inaudible] AMU, Florida State, they have on line programs, University of Florida, University of South Florida, they all have on line programs.
R:  Do you know people that are involved in those?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, and how are they, ah, reacting?  Are they --
L:  They actually like it.  They said it was, like, easier compared to, like, what the people was talking about, like in their class, some --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of their friends that went to the regular class, and they, you know, they put facts together and it come out that the internet was easier.
R:  Are they actually getting what they need? 
L:  Yeah.  It's just that it's at your own pace and it's not just, you know, and you can log on or go to it whenever you feel like it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's the internet, it's like, at your own pace.
R:  Yeah.  Gee, that's one like, my daughter, um, ah, did, um, ah, home schooling that way, or did a Christian school, that they had, ah, workbooks where they went at their own pace, ah, like that.  So this is really an advancement, ah, to go to this, I think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think it's really helpful.
L:  It is.  Mm.  Overall, I think computers, you know, they're here to stay.  I don't think they're leaving any time soon.  Until they come up with something better. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
