R:  Hi.  My name is David.
L:  Hi.  My name is Chris.
R:  Hi, Chris.  How are you?
L:  Okay.
R:  I don't know wha- -- how we're going to talk about this for ten minutes.
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  This is a tough one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, [MN] computers are everything now, I guess, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You can't get a job, you can't do anything without a computer, right?
L:  That's true. [NOISE]
R:  But you're talking to a guy -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- who has absolutely no idea -- has no -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- no knowl- -- I'm a lawyer but -- but I have no knowledge of computers at all.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
R:  How about you?
L:  Oh, yeah, I'm on it quite a bit.
R:  Good.  
L:  Last -- 
R:  Tell me about it. 
L:  Well, last couple of years I'm getting pretty -- pretty good at it, actually.  I got a job through the computer.
R:  Where are you calling from?
L:  I'm calling from Pottsville, Pennsylvania.
R:  Okay.  Go on, tell me, keep -- you got a job through the computer?
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  Tell me, how did you do that?
L:  Well, actually, you ever hear of this job as a -- as, um, a mystery shopper?
R:  No.
L:  You never did? 
R:  No.  Tell me.
L:  Well, you go into a store and you pretend you're a shopper and you evaluate the people and you buy something and they pay you for it, though it's actually real and I was on there signing up, I signed up for a job as a merchandiser and I actually work for a company out of Illinois -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- locally, as a merchandiser.  I just go round the stores and put up magazines and -- 
R:  So -- so I guess -- so I guess computers are pretty important in education today. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I gues- -- isn't that what they wanted us -- us to talk about?
L:  Yeah, computers in education.
R:  Yeah.  I guess -- I guess they should have computers now in every classroom.
L:  Actually, yeah, I think they do.  I think they start them pretty young now.
R:  How -- how young do they usually start them?
L:  I know my daughter just started, um, [NOISE] seventh grade.  They had, um, her on a computer and she has a couple of computer courses.
R:  Oh, my God, it's embarrassing.  Uh, can you imagine if your little -- y- your younger daughter knows a thousand times more than me? 
L:  Actually, my little three year old can get on a computer.  I didn't know she was that good.
R:  Oh, you keep sticking it to me.
L:  She can hit this button and that button.
R:  Uh?
L:  It's like, wow! 
R:  Really? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Huh -- let me ask you a question.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I guess I haven't st- -- st- -- how hard is it, uh, for me, if I, uh, if I set my mind to it to learn, you know, do I have to learn how to type first too?
L:  No, I don't type that well. [LAUGH] After you're on it for a while you're just so -- you just get used to a few keys and you can type pretty good, not really great like a secretary [NOISE] but you can type pretty well.
R:  It's also good to have fun with [inaudible], right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, you can talk to people and, uh, you can find out things you never knew about before t- too, right?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, they have a lot of classes out there.
R:  And -- and what kind of computer do you think is the best one?
L:  Oh, let's see, I have a Gateway and that one sucks, [LAUGH] up in my daughter's room and now -- right now we have, um, an HP and I think it's pretty good, that one, have no problems with that, and we have XP.
R:  What is that? 
L:  Hm, um, -- 
R:  How many do you have?
L:  Two.  We had, uh, them -- the -- the Gateway first, then we got a new one and so I gave it to my daughter because she was always on it and we couldn't get on it, so it was better off that way. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Uh, like I said, uh, I'm a lawyer but I -- I wanted to try to get into another field and I can't because -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- everything I try I have to have knowledge of computers -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'm so embarrassed to go to computer school, you know -- 
L:  Mhm.  I know.
R:  -- because everybody is nineteen years old.
L:  That's what I do.  Um, I had a few -- like a few part time jobs and I needed to know, like, Excel, so I would hurry up and go, join the library, grab a book and practice on it before I got the job so I didn't look totally stupid, like, "I don't know what that is", so I knew the basics. [NOISE] I never actually went to a -- one of those classes, either, I just kind of tried to learn on my own.
R:  How long did it take you to, like, ma- -- finally get like pretty good?
L:  Um, not that long, say about a month.  In my spare time I would be on my computer practising different stuff, so ... [NOISE] 
R:  So now, [MN] when your daughter goes to school, she uses the c- computer every day?  They have computers in the classroom?
L:  Yeah, she has a couple of courses.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I know she had the typing but then they put her on computer keyboard now instead of typing.  They changed it to keyboarding.
R:  What does that mean?  I don't know what that means?
L:  Instead of, you know how you're typing in school? 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Now they teach you on the computer.  It's called keyboarding.
R:  So you learn how to type at the same time, you mean?
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  Yeah, but the problem -- but who -- who needs -- who needs how -- to know how to type?  The -- y- you don't see typewriters any more.
L:  Yeah, well, they changed it over to computers, so they do everything on there.
R:  Is she -- she as fast as you?
L:  Oh, no, she's much better.
R:  Oh, you're kidding.
L:  Yeah, she's great. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, is that embarrassing for me.
L:  It's embarrassing, yes, it is, especially when she's standing behind me, I get so self -- self conscious, it's like, "Here, type this for me". [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, -- uh, -- 
L:  It'll be done in one minute, I'll be here for half an hour.
R:  And what do you think she'll be able to do when she grows up with a computer?
L:  Oh, she knows pretty much now.
R:  You know, could you imagine twenty years ago nobody even knew about -- I mean not -- maybe like, twenty five years ago -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- computers were nothing.  Now all of a sudden -- 
L:  It's everything.
R:  -- its -- I don't -- I remember there used to be this thing call Univac, this giant computer, right? 
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  That was like, -- like, as -- as big as a truck and that was, like, the biggest thing on TV and everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And now computers are so small compared -- like the size of portable TVs.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  I mean, you can even get real tiny ones, right?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Ex- explain something -- explain something to me about the, uh, [MN] how come sometimes I see people using computers, right, and I see, like, uh, movies and things on -- on them? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't understand that.  Can you explain that?  You know -- you know what I'm talking about?
L:  Yeah, they have.  You can download a movie from -- on your computer and watch it on your computer.
R:  What -- h- h- how -- how do you do that?
L:  I've never actually done it.  Now we got a DVD player in our computer and I've never used it.
R:  What does that mean?
L:  I can download a movie and instead of watching it on TV, watch it on my computer, which I don't -- I wouldn't -- I don't get that, I'd rather watch it on TV, it's a bigger screen, but I guess to copy it and a movie you want to see and that's already in your DVD player.
R:  That's amazing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you can download music, too?
L:  Yeah.
R:  H- how do you do that?
L:  Uh, well, there's a lot of web sites you can go on and just download the music and play it on your computer, like, um, instead of having a CD player -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just like that and then you can burn your own CD.
R:  And l- let me ask you a question.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If you go to a web site, right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you get stuff off them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  How -- how do they make money, the -- the web site?
L:  Actually, I don't know that.  That one that -- 
R:  Nobody ever do that.
L:  -- just got shut down, they are charging now so everybody went somewhere else. [NOISE]
R:  What -- 
L:  I don't -- I don't know how they do it.
R:  Well, how do they charge?
L:  They don't.  The one I use is free, you actually just go on, down load the music that you want.  I guess it's other users.  Don't ask me how you get it from them.
R:  Ahah.
L:  I don't understand -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that part of it, but it is free.
R:  If you want to find out about a subject, like on a computer -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- how does that work?  [MN] Is there a thing, like, you go to a si- -- there's a thou- -- ten thousand subjects or something you go look up?  Is there a thing that lists like ten thousand subjects you go to?
L:  Uh, what do you mean?  If you want to look --
R:  [MN] Like, I know that computers have every weird subject you could imagine to find.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay.  Let's say you wanted to find -- [MN] pick some weird subject like, um, purple flowers or something, okay?
L:  Yeah.
R:  How would you go about finding out everything you wanted to know about purple flowers? 
L:  [NOISE] What I usually do when I want to find something is just go on to, like, MSN, the web search and just type it in [NOISE] and then push search, like purple flower, or they do have --
R:  Explain that to me.  I -- I don't -- I don't know what that means.
L:  It's called a search engine.  You just go on and type in a word or a phrase and you push search and it brings up everything and every web site that has something do with purple flowers.
R:  Really? 
L:  Or you can go into an encyc- -- uh, encyclopedias, too, but I never went into one for that.
R:  What does that mean?  Explain that to me.
L:  They're just web sites, it's just like encyc- -- [NOISE] like an encyclopedia on line.
R:  How -- 
L:  But I've never used one of them.
R:  And -- 
L:  Instead of having a book, it's right there, in the computer.
R:  A- a- and -- and what does it mean?  You have to buy all this kind of software, too, if you have a computer? 
L:  [NOISE] Usually when you -- you buy a computer package there is a bunch of software in it but the cheaper you go, [NOISE] the less software it has, so then you're after spending like sixty dollars for one program.  They're -- they are pretty expensive.
R:  You have to buy something that's called Windows or something like that?
L:  [NOISE] That's usually installed on a computer when you buy it, yeah.
R:  Okay, and also some time people, uh, if -- if you want to buy a computer for your -- how do you enter stuff that you want to -- how do you organize it and everything?  It explains it to you?  Like if you want -- 
L:  How to use it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, [inaudible] 
R:  Like, mainly what do you use your computer for?
L:  What was that?
R:  What do you use your computer for, mainly?
L:  Email and just to mess around, like type and find out stupid things or if I'm bored. 
R:  Can you tell me how email works?
L:  Actually, well, all you do is -- is in -- in place of sending a letter [NOISE] and it's instant, you know --
R:  And --
L:  -- you don't have to wait three days for a message to get somewhere.
R:  And how does somebody know if they got a message?  They have to look?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And -- and -- and how do you keep it private?
L:  Well, the one we have is MSN, you have to have a password to get on there.
R:  Oh, so you pick a password.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then -- so if you want to write a guy, like, [MN] [MN] [MN] in private, he has a password and you could write to him?
L:  It's on your -- on your system alone.  You have to have a password to get in it and user name, but on certain systems like if you go to a local area connection to get on the internet your whole family can get on there and everybody can see your email, but the one we have, you have to have your own password to get in for every certain person in your household, so it's a little bit more private. [SIGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  So ... 
R:  This conversation has got to be more than ten minutes, hasn't it?
L:  I know. [NOISE]
R:  Do you think they forgot us?
L:  [NOISE] What was that?
R:  Do you think they forgot to shut it off?
L:  I -- I don't know.  It's been -- it's been, like, ten minutes, huh? 
R:  I know, but I'm afraid if we hang up, it won't work.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. 
R:  What do you think?
