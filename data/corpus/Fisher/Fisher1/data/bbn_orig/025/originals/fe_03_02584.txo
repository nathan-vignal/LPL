L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  This is Susan.
R:  Hi, my name's Tracey.
L:  Hi.  Um ...
R:  I wasn't really paying attention when they gave us the topic and all that. [LAUGH]
L:  I wasn't either.  It has to do with, um --
R:  Something about Iraq.
L:  Yeah.  What our -- what -- what our priorities should be in Ir- -- what should we do in Iraq and how do we feel about disarming Ir- Iraq?
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So --
R:  Well, you wanna go first?
L:  [LAUGH] Put the toe in the water?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I'm probably going to be a hard one to talk to because I don't see things in black and white.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, my feeling is, uh --
R:  I've got to speak to them for ten minutes.
L:  -- that we don't -- we are not privy to enough information to make some decisions.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But certainly if we ever want to get to a, uh, place of total world peace then that means that those that -- who truly desire peace can't tolerate tyrants.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, whatever that means to someone is kinda where I am.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I guess it's your turn. [LAUGH]
R:  So, is the war over or what?
L:  Uh, my understanding is in fact I think, uh, Bush is gonna be on TV tonight --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to -- to tell us that the -- the war part is actually over but of course there's still borders that have to be, uh, maintained because--
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there are threats from outside the borders.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh -- but as far as -- as, uh, pushing in and taking over new territory that part of it's pretty much over with.
R:  Yeah.  Mm.
L:  And all the things that so many people that I know were afraid were going to happen didn't happen.
R:  Yeah.  Mm.  Well, what were they afraid of?
L:  Retaliation.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And -- and even -- I mean, everybody was afraid that they did have a nuclear weapon and they did expose it and -- you know, and they would -- they would do something with it but the truth is is that we don't know whether there's -- there -- for all we know there are thousands of square miles of desert where anything could be hidden.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They could still have one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- or they could have imported it to another corner -- country and --
R:  Right.
L:  And detonate -- and detonate it from there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I think the fear of doing nothing is -- is really not a very good reason to not do nothing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Myself.
R:  Mhm.  Okay.
L:  So ... anyway, you're letting me do all the talking.
R:  Yeah. [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I was wondering what ever happened to Bin Laden?  I -- I wasn't paying attention very much in the news and that's all they talked about and then a couple of months later they stopped talking about him and then it was back to Saddam.  What happ- -- where did he go?  They just give up?
L:  Uh, no.  There's -- we certainly have a force still in Afghanistan but, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- nobody knows where Bin Laden is.
R:  Well, I mean, that's all they talked about on the news, like, twenty four hours a day and then they just stopped talking about him.
L:  Well, because I think it's -- it's -- it's simply a continuous hunt and search thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  There really isn't a force to repel like there was, uh, in the current situation.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, I mean, it was just Bin Laden and a few of his cronies --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not -- not the organized militia that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we're doing now.  So, once in a while they say something about it but, you know, that's -- that's another thing.  That's the way the news is.  They --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Whatever the hot topic is at the moment --
R:  That's what they talk about.
L:  That's what they talk about.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and -- and of course the -- the so called war was so juicy because there were so many, uh, opposing factions to it that that kept it really alive and rocking and rolling.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I'm not a news buff myself because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a lot of this stuff I -- I have no control over --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, uh, a lot of it just makes you feel bad so why subject yourself to that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I'm -- I'm certainly not an expert on anything except my own feelings which are --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we don't know enough to make, uh, some decisions and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and we can only make them for ourselves.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  We just have to trust that the government that we choose to live in is doing things the right way.
L:  Well, you see, that's the thing, as long as people don't vote intelligently or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- don't vote at all --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then, I mean, like the old guy said, people usually deserve the governments that they have.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we as a people are pretty lax [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in, uh, a- accountability as far as our representatives go and we, uh, you know, keep voting the same old guys in.
R:  Yeah.  Or you don't vote at all.  You just do nothing.
L:  Well, I can see --
R:  And then complain about it.
L:  I can see why a lot of people don't vote because it's -- they feel helpless.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because the majority tends to follow whoever is going to offer them something and as long as people are looking for a handout that's the way their votes will go.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which means they're controlled.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, I'm -- I'm not prepared to try to change the minds of a couple of hundred million people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can -- I can only control what goes on in my life and the way I treat my neighbors and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and hope that, uh -- that spreads far enough.  I mean, it's interesting to hear people talk about God and love and all the other stuff and wanna either kill, uh, uh, Saddam or President Bush.
R:  Mm.
L:  It doesn't make sense to me.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, where do you live?
L:  I'm in Washington State.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And you are --
R:  I'm in a suburb of Chicago.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] So, how did you find out about this program?
R:  Money and shopping.  Angela.  You ever hear of that.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  Oh, it's like, uh, mystery shopping and, uh, secret shopper --
L:  Oh, okay.  I know --
R:  -- type of --
L:  -- what that is.
R:  Yeah.  Just -- yeah.
L:  Is that something that you do?
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.  So, we go out and try to find, you know, different, uh, companies that are looking for shoppers or try to get scheduled for different assignments and she has a website and she has, uh, an email where she send out -- like, generates information and she will only recommend stuff that she thinks is good.  I mean, obviously, you don't have to take her up on any of her suggestions but she said this was, uh, you know, legitimate and pretty easy so, if you want, sign up and I signed up today and I think they've called me on the first available --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- time that I said I was thinking I'd be home [MN].
L:  Yeah.  Me too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Kinda surprised me because I just signed up yesterday.
R:  Oh, I just signed up today.
L:  That was fast.
R:  Yeah.  How did you hear about it?
L:  Oh, a friend of mine sent me an email.
R:  Yeah.
L:  She's gotta fr- -- she knows somebody that, um, has a group of people that are always looking for ways to generate a little money.
R:  Right.
L:  And they found it and sent it on to her and she sent it to me so I sent it to a couple of my friends.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R: Yeah.  It's kinda the same -- same idea.
L:  I don't know that I really understand, uh, what they're doing but, hey --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Well, it sounded more like it was about linguistics.  Like how people speak, what they say.  I don't know.  Accents, dialects, inflections.  It kinda sounded like that's what linguistics means to me so I thought that's what they were looking for.
L:  Well, that's what the --
R:  I didn't know I'd have to talk about Iraq. [LAUGH]
L:  That -- that's what they say.  Yeah.  My friend talked about, uh, food one night.
R:  Yeah.  Let me talk about food.
L:  [MN]
R:  That would be fun.
L:  But I think the question was whether you'd rather go out to dinner and eat -- or eat at home or something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then it went on from there.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But this -- you know, that's not a very controversial subject.
R:  No.
L:  And this one is.  So, maybe --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that makes a difference in what they're looking for.  I don't have any idea.
R:  Yeah.  [inaudible] people are gonna --
L:  Just as long as I don't start getting a bunch of strange phone calls and strange emails.
R:  Yeah.  It -- well, they said it was secure so I went ahead and believed 'em so, you know, I can always change my email address.
L:  I -- I -- I guess we'll find out, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, I don't know where to go with this.  I pretty much said what my --
R:  Yeah.  I don't have a whole lot more [LAUGH] to say about it anyway.  So --
L:  How -- how are the people in your area in general -- how have they responded?  Has there been a lot of anger and violence and ...?
R:  Yeah, no, I haven't seen anything.  Everyone's just kinda living their life every day just like normal.  Just like, you know -- it hasn't really been too much.  I mean, yeah, a lot more people have, like, flags on their car and, you know, they're wearing the red, white and blue stuff but it's not like anything --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- really overtly, like, dramatic.  It's just common type of thing.  So ...
L:  Well, actually, I think that's good.
R:  I mean, at first there was a couple of -- there wasn't really a riot but they were like mass protests that were right in downtown Chicago and that caused a big mess but that was like a couple of days after the war started but then after, you know, kind of a initial, -- you know, had a few groups just showing some like -- just getting on the media.  Just getting on the news.  It's pretty much quietened down.  Everybody, you know, they go to work just like they did or do whatever they were doing before and, you know, it does --
