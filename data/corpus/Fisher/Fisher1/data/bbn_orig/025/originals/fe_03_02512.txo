L:  Hi, my name is Elizabeth Clay.
R:  Oh, hi.  I'm Kathy Wisaka[?].
L:  Hi.
R:  [LAUGH]  I guess we're supposed to talk about reality TV?
L:  [LAUGH]  I guess so.
R:  I don't watch it.
L:  [LAUGH]  I don't either, actually.  Well, sometimes I do, but rarely.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  I have, um -- I'm trying to think.  I think I watched one of the first Survivors.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And that's it.
L:  I think I watched -- I watch the Real World every once in a while.  [LAUGH]  But that's it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  No, I'm not -- no -- my sister likes it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I -- I just can't.  Most of the people seem kind of pathetic.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  They are.  [LAUGH]  Definitely.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, I'm not good at stuff like this.
L:  Oh, it's okay.  I had to do something sort of like this too, so ...  I was kind of a telemarketer without selling anything, sort of a deal.  [LAUGH]
R:  So is that what we're supposed to do here?  I mean just ...  [MN] I don't know.  Keep --
L:  I [MN] --
R:  -- talking about reality television.
L:  I guess so.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Hm.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Uh.  [LAUGH]  I don't know.  My family -- my extended family seems to like it but ...  I don't know why, I just never really watch it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  No, I've -- I'd heard a lot about it on -- on, um, the radio today.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That seems to be all they wanted to talk about, was that some guy got kicked off of -- I don't even know which one of the shows.  But one of the shows yesterday, and it was just -- devastated people.
L:  Oh, man.
R:  And I don't, you know, it's -- I -- I don't watch it, so I don't really know who or what they were talking about.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's just -- I mean, it's television.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, exac- -- it's just getting old now.  They -- they're coming out with all those different reality shows like the one that's, um, [LIPSMACK] -- oh, what's it called?  Mr. Personality.  That, uh, what's her name, Monica [LAUGH] Lewinsky.  She made up a reality TV show called --
R:  Oh, I think I heard about that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  No, I haven't --
L:  And they all wear masks and --
R:  Haven't seen that one either.
L:  Oh, I didn't watch that one either, but, uh, that one was just going so far, like [LAUGH] -- like they're just, sort of, scrounging around for anything it seems.  I don't know.  Kind of strange.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, see, yeah.  I don't know, maybe other people have just far too much time on their hands.
L:  Maybe.
R:  Or something like that.
L:  Maybe.
R:  I mean I just -- it seems like I'm just scrambling to get the other stuff done.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, maybe watch a little bit of, what I think is better TV.  I don't know that it's good but [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at least it's not people trying to do mean things to other people. 
L:  [LAUGH]  That's true.  That's a good point.  But sometimes it seems like that.
R:  So, I don't know.  I just -- it -- that's -- um, [SIGH] -- oh, for heaven's sakes.  I'm trying -- I don't know what show it is but where the guy is just always saying the -- the mean th-  -- well, any of 'em.  Like the Survivor one.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean that was just like they would always trying to trick each other --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- into getting rid of somebody or, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  I just -- I -- it just to me seems -- all of it seems so mean. 
L:  Yeah, I agree.  Yeah.  Definitely, it's a shallow way to make entertainment.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I think so too.
L:  Yeah.  But I guess if they volunteer.  I mean --
R:  Well, you can make good money.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I guess [MN], you know, you get your, you know, fifteen minutes of fame --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- so you're semi famous, but it seems like it's kind of a pitiful reason to --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to be famous.  You haven't really done anything of any value or quality.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You just put your --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- face out there.  [MN]
L:  It's kind of, yeah.  And like I said now, I just think they're going so far that it's getting ridiculous.  I don't know.  It's like -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- everything is reality now.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bit too much for me.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, uh, the one where they do all the disgusting things, like eating --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- nasty stuff and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  Yuk.
R:  I don't know.  I don't.  I guess I'm just not that desperate.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yuk.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Well, and they had that one with the celebrities that went out back or something, and ...
R:  Oh, yeah.  The quasi celebrities?
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  Exactly.  It had, uh, Joan Collins' daughter in it.  [MN]  Was it Joan Collins or ...?
R:  Oh, Joan Rivers' daughter.
L:  Rivers.  Joan Rivers.
R:  Melissa.  Yeah.  Yeah, well.
L:  And she was bitching the whole time.  I don't know if I can swear on this thing but ... [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, that's not a swear word.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [several inaudible words].  That's, like, um, a descriptive word.
L:  [LAUGH]  That's right.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  She just [MN].  It was, I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here.  That's right.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  See I missed that one too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I heard of it.  'Cause I heard that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- she was one it.  She was on some show anyway.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.
R:  Is that the same one where the guy that got married on the show?
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I don't know.
L:  I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I know in the Real World --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- some guy got married.  They --
R:  Is that the one where they go and live in different houses?
L:  Mm, actually that was the Battle of the Sexes, I think.  It was --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- like, two -- they take the girls and the boys and then, like, they do these competitions, and some guy on there got married.  I don't know.  Because they were in an exotic place, so ...  Real good honeymoon place.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, so they decided they should +wed two people on the show or somebody with a ...?
L:  [MN]  Um, this one guy that was on the show --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and then his girlfriend.  So ...
R:  So, I think the only one that I -- I -- and I didn't watch it either, was that I got a -- kind of, got a chuckle out of was the millionaire one.  Joe -- not -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- Joe Millionaire, but that -- something where the guy wasn't.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it just showed how these -- these women were so shallow.  
L:  Yes.
R:  That, you know, that they were, "Oh, I just love you.  I love you" until they found out he didn't have any money.
L:  Yeah.  And they're just like, "Oh".
R:  All of a sudden they didn't like him.
L:  See, I would've just been pissed that he lied.  You know, like I wouldn't care about the money, but I'd be like, "Oh.  [LAUGH]  It's not cool that brought me on TV and ..."
R:  And then, yeah, and then you did this to me, but see.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's what they get.  Although the one that, I guess, won, or whatever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- got money.
L:  Yeah, they ended up giving them like a million dollars at the end of the show.  So ...  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Isn't that -- just a little bit of casual cash to throw around. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible] stuff like that.  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Why -- why not feed the homele- -- I mean, the hungry or -- or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Home the homeless or, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- somebody house the homeless.  I can't even speak.  
L:  Just add a little more --
R:  Use that money for something good rather than for some of these [inaudible] people that just walk -- you know, walk around, "Give me more.  Give me more".
L:  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was pretty interesting.  Yeah, I only watched, like, one episode.  But I had a [MN] -- a roommate who was really into it.  So I kind of heard it in the background and [MN] junk like that.  [MN]  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  You sound like I do.  I -- this -- that phone call woke me up.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.  I'm just like so tired and, but that's okay.  I know how it goes.  [LAUGH].  Like, "Yeah, I'll do it" because I know how it feels.  [LAUGH]  So ...  You get ten bucks, why not.
R:  Yeah, huh.
L:  [LAUGH] Totally worth it.
R:  Ten minutes is [MN] -- seems to be a long time.
L:  I know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Maybe next time it'll be something that I know something about.  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Talk a little bit more.
L:  Yeah, I ca- -- no kidding.  Phew.  You know.  Let's see, what else?  [LAUGH]
R:  So, yeah.  I would rather talk about why they're doing this [MN] -- this study than, I don't know --
L:  Yeah, that would be --
R:  -- reality television.  [LAUGH]
L:  That would be interesting.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And what -- well, there's some other topics like food and -- or something like your favorite food or something.  I don't know.  Kind of weird.  Kind of weird.
R:  Okay.  So now where's that computer lady voice?
L:  Yeah, really.
R:  Bring me that [several inaudible words].
L:  Get on here.
R:  Or -- or give us a list of the reality things so we can --
L:  Yeah, no kidding.
R:  [MN]
L:  [MN]  Mm.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]  I'm just trying to picture some of the commercials that I've seen of those things.  [MN]
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN]  And there was one where they had, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- them -- oh, gosh, now I don't remember what it was.  It seems like they were running around something way up in the sky.
L:  Oh, jeeze.
R:  Did you see a commercial for something like that?
L:  I don't remember that.
R:  Okay.  But I don't remember what that -- the show was for.
L:  Yeah.  I remember I saw one just recently with, like, they showed like a heel of someone's -- [MN] someone's heel and it was all, yuk, it was all gross and, I don't know.  They were just showing how, like, out back they were and ... [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  Well, that sounds charming.  Let's come back with -- with gross things on our body.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  
R:  Oh.  [MN]
L:  Yeah, it was, like, all infected and ... [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that sounds very nice.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  So that wasn't too yummy.  [LAUGH]  But ...
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't know that I could -- well now I think I'm a bit old to be on any of those things that I wouldn't be --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- physically fit enough.
L:  I wouldn't either.
R:  But I don't know that I would ever have been -- been, um, I don't know if it's brave.  I think maybe stupid enough to go out --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- eat what they did or, I mean, just to do some of those things.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  Right.  Definitely.
R:  Going to the Amazon, I don't think would be such a bad thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But not in the way that they do it and not having to be so mean to everybody else in order to -- to get myself to win.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I'm just not mean like that inside, [LAUGH] you know.
