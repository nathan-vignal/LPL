L:  Hi, my name is Pamela.
R:  Hi, my name is Angela.  Uh, I watch, uh, The Bachelor and I watch -- I -- I didn't watch Mr. Personality, but --
L:  Yeah, that's the one I've been watching.  I haven't watched The Bachelor.
R:  Oh.  I -- I -- I also watched, um, [LIPSMACK] Survivor, too.  I've watched the different episodes of Survivor.
L:  Yeah, diff- -- I haven't watched the whole thing.  Just [MN] little, you know, in between ones I've taped them.
R:  Did you like Mr. Personality?
L:  Oh, I love that one.  
R:  You do?
L:  Mm, yeah.  Because it seems like she's not -- she don't -- she don't see the, uh, the, uh, physical appearance of the person first, so she's going by the personality and how they're acting and when they -- this weekend they were drinking and some of the guys on there didn't even really care for her.  They were cheating on her with, um, the hula dancers they had there --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- dancing for her.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well --
L:  And it was -- it was really funny, though.
R:  Well, that's like, uh, on The, uh, Bachelor.  That -- I think what makes it, uh, The Bachelor so popular is the -- because there are so many women looking for Mr. Right.  You know.
L:  It's true.
R:  And -- and probably just like Mr. Personality too, you miss -- you know, the ladies looking for Mr. Right, too.  
L:  Right.
R:  So, um, it just seems like with The Bachelor they, you know, they [MN] it was just a funny show lately because it seems like he keeps telling each one he's interested in 'em, and then at the last minute it's like, "No, you're not going to get a rose" so ...
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I didn't watch -- which -- when is that on?
R:  Uh, Wednesday night.
L:  Wednesday night?
R:  Yeah.  CBS.
L:  Maybe -- maybe, I'll watch it then.
R:  Mhm.  And then on the Survivor shows, uh --
L:  Did they quit that now or that still going?
R:  No, they still have those on too.  Yeah --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- they still have those on.  But [COUGH] it -- it -- I don't know, I think people have kind of lost interest in it because it has, you know, same old, same old stuff all the time. 
L:  Right.
R:  And with, um, not so many people getting involved with it by watching it because they think, "Oh well, you know, they're just going to do the same thing they did last season".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Whereas they try to get a new place, like Thailand or, you know, um, African safari, or whatever, you know, --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they get 'em to a different, uh, country and everything.
L:  Right.  Did you watch, um, what was that -- the Joe Millionaire?
R:  Uh, yeah, I did watch some of that.
L:  You watched it?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I did watch some of that.  That one was, um, kind of different too because, um, [COUGH] the way the women related to him thinking, you know, he really --
L:  They were all gold diggers. 
R:  -- was a millionaire.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  So, you know ...
L:  That's what it sounded like. 
R:  Yeah.  Each one of them was like that, you know.
L:  And she was the nasty, I think.  She's like the blonde one.  She's -- he's mine.  He's mine.  He didn't pick her, it was funny.
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I thought that was strange, too.  And -- and, you know, each one of them would say, "Oh, you know, I think, you know, he's so fabulous.  And he's so great".  And then afterwards, after they, you know, one of them would go off, and they'd each go off and they'd say --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "Oh, well, you know, he wasn't really that good".  You know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or something like that.  [LAUGH]  And then some would get upset.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, they would.
R:  I think they portray it ...
L:  And some of them are crying.  It was so ridiculous.  They got to keep -- if the jewellery was real, which they claim it was, I don't know, they got to keep each week a different piece of jewellery.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That was nice.  That was nice about it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, 'cause I was wondering about that, too.  You know, when they had each piece, you know, and he'd give 'em each of piece and they --
L:  They claimed it was real.  I mean, I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah -- yeah.  Who's to say, right?
L:  Yeah.  They can't tell.
R:  [LAUGH] Who's to say?
L:  And I watch The Real World.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  That's another one.  
R:  Yeah, I don't think I've ever watched that.
L:  And they get into so many situations and, um, fi- -- screaming and fighting.  They bleep out he cursing and ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't think I've seen that.  What's station is that?
L:  Um, MTV.
R:  Oh.
L:  Out here it's Time Warner Cable channel twenty.
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh.
L:  It's really funny, though.
R:  Yeah.  No, I don't think I've ever watched that one.
L:  No.  But there's --
R:  But I guess that --
L:  -- another one with, um, I don't know the name of it, but it's with, um, the guy from the tires, [MN] something Firestone.  
R:  Oh.
L:  And he's looking for a -- a girl.
R:  Well, that's The Bachelor.
L:  Oh, that's The Bachelor?
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  Okay.  I didn't know if that was --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- The Bachelor or what it was.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's The Bachelor because he's the one that has that big winery and his -- a grandfather used to have tires but --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- now they have a big, um, --
L:  That's him, okay?
R:  -- winery.  And, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Is that your phone or my phone or ...?
L:  N- -- I don't kn- -- no, my phone's fine.  I -- you're -- you're getting very low.
R:  Oh. [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello, hello, hello.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, something happened with -- hello?  Hello?  Hello?
R:  What happened?
L:  I don't know.
R:  Geez, all of a sudden it went real funny.  The phone.
L:  It went -- I heard all static but I have a brand new phone --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so I don't know.
R:  Oh.
L:  I don't think it's this one.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  So what --
L:  You're on a cordless also?
R:  N- no.  I'm on a regular phone.
L:  Oh, regular phone.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, maybe, it was them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.
R:  W- well, what about on the, um, The Bachelor.  The one when they've had -- last season when they had The Bachelor and I think they've, you know, Kristen is, you know, ea- each time they pick somebody but like last time sh- -- you know, they made you think she was going to pick somebody else.
L:  Oh, yeah.  That was stupid.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  That made you watch it though.  
R:  Yeah, I know.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Because they even said that [COUGH] Charlie, the one that wasn't chosen, he even said he thought that, you know, that -- even when he watched it that he -- he could see how the public thought it was going to be him.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, [LAUGH] which is funny, you know, to think that. 
L:  Then they had Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that end- -- then she -- I think -- I don't know if she married him and got divorced or something.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, yeah. Yeah.  
L:  To Garrett Connor, or whatever hell, Comvy[?], or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That was funny, too.
R:  I know.  Yeah.  All different ones.  But I think a lot of people are interested in 'em because they like the -- the excitement and they tune in every week, you know, to watch it.  So I -- I -- maybe -- I really think that people enjoy watching them.
L:  I think it's like a nosy neighbour.  Like you're eavesdropping into people's lives, like bits
R:  Mhm.
L:  And maybe it's m- more adventurous than your own life.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or it's something you might be wishing for.  You know, that they'd rather have the glamorous life like that.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, that they, um, could be lavished with gifts every week or ...
L:  I wish.  
R:  You know, go out and [inaudible].
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  You know, and go these different places and have a -- a sit down dinner served to you every night.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, [COUGH]
L:  Well, I couldn't believe the end of Joe Millionaire 'cause the woman did get a million dollars and the guy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just [inaudible] ending it like that.  
R:  I know.
L:  That was really nice. 
R:  Mhm.  I know, that was kind of the twist to the e- -- whole thing at the end, you know.
L:  Yeah, you weren't expecting it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I think more people are interested in 'em, so I think they'll be adding more and more all the time too.
L:  They should make 'em earlier in the day because all they have is talk shows on and soap operas, which I watch, but it's getting boring.  The talk shows are getting ridiculous.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Mhm.
L:  So they should have them on, maybe, like du- -- even if they have to repeat them for people who can't stay up that late, they should put the reality shows during the day.
R:  Mhm.  That would be a good idea.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  You know, because like you said, with people being home all day, all they watch is the soap operas but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they could just switch off and watch that.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  
L:  I wish they would. 
R:  Mhm.  I -- I think they will.  I'll think they'll add more.  And I think, like, Fox TV is getting into, um, more.
L:  Yeah, they're doing it a lot.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Seems like everytime they're talking about the new s- -- shows they're -- they're reality ones.
L:  But I wonder where you go to audition for these things?  [LAUGH]
R:  I know it.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  I guess they probably get a lot of resumes from people that want to be on those shows.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then, um, [LIPSMACK] -- what was that other one I was thinking of.  Um, Fear Factor.
L:  Oh, that was disgusting. Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  With the roaches and they had these things that were crawling over them.
R:  Oh.
L:  Oh.
R:  It was terrible.
L:  I watched it but it was getting me nauseous.  I had to turn it off.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I'd be like to turning my head, you know, sometime when they'd have different ones that emptied the bugs or what.
L:  Yeah.  That's disgusting.
R:  [several inaudible words] there.
L:  But there was one where, um, oh, maybe it was Fear Factor.  Where you had -- people have swallowed bugs.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Was that it?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Okay.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  That was the fu- -- that was disgusting.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  
L:  I don't care how much money [LAUGH] you're going to get.  
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't think I want to swallow any bugs either.
L:  No -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- and they were eating like, I think, w- worms or something that was alive.
R:  Yeah, and they had the time when they put 'em like in a plastic casket and had all these rats running --
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- across them and stuff.  I thought, "Oh yeah, that'd be the day when I'd be in some casket with a bunch of rats climbing all over me".
L:  Oh, it's disgusting.  [LAUGH]
R:  And they had to put goggles on because the rats would go right toward their eyes and stuff, and I thought, "Oh geez".
L:  Oh, they probably scratch or some --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Yeah, they were eating bugs and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know all different testicles from cows and stuff like that and ...
L:  Right.
R:  Oh.  
L:  [LAUGH]  No, that's okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'd rather stick to the other ones like, uh, Joe Millionaire and stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- where they don't eat those things.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  That is so disgusting.  
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, and then people would try out for that, you know.  Want to be a contestant on that.  And --
L:  Right.
R:  -- try to win money on that.  But those were -- seemed like young kids.  Not young kids but younger people, not so much, um --
L:  Did you see the one that she told the other girls she had a boyfriend and she was only there for the money?
R:  Oh, no.  I didn't see that.
L:  That was on Joe Millionaire.  One of the girls that were in the first beginning of the episode, she said she was only there for the money.
R:  Oh, really?  Oh.
L:  Yeah, but she whispered I think at night, but I don't think she knew it was being taped.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then they found out and they [several inaudible words] basically threw her off the, uh, off the show.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow.
L:  That was funny.
R:  Gee.  Yeah, 'cause I guess they can do that, you know.  I guess they put you through a [LIPSMACK] um, you know --
L:  Like a test or -- or at least you got a sign, probably, something.
R:  Yeah.  Probably a screening process --
L:  Mm, yeah.
R:  -- and stuff.  Because otherwise, you know, people would just be lying.  That was just like the recent one that they did for, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, American Idol where, you know, they found out --
L:  Oh, somebody had a --
R:  -- that that one guy --
L:  -- a record or something?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.  See 'cause they didn't disclose it, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  They have to disclose that stuff and -- and if they didn't then they'd have
