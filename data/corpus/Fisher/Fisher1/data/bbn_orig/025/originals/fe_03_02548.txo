L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  Um --
R:  This is Dave[?].
L:  This is Marlon.
R:  Who?
L:  This is Marlon.
R:  Marlon.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, um --
R:  What do you think of reality shows?
L:  Reality television?  I think it's got a mass appeal because, ah, it's relatively new. [NOISE]  And, ah, people really like the reality.  I guess they're tired of, you know, watching the same old actors and actresses on the screen.  What do --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you think about that?
R:  Yeah.  Um, I -- I, um -- I've watched some of 'em.  I watched Joe Millionaire and the Survivor show.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, I sort of liked the Joe Millionaire show.
L:  Yeah.  Why was that?  Was it really funny, or ...?
R:  Well, it was sort of decent --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and -- but, I think this, um, ah Survivor show is sort of dirty.
L:  Survivor?  Yeah, I think it's, ah -- it's got its days numbered.  I think it lost popularity by a long shot over the other shows.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, 'cause they seem to be pushing the envelope even further.  I don't know if you've noticed, but with Fear Factor the kind of stuff that goes on there, it's really pushing the envelope.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Eating worms and whatnot.
L:  Right -- right. [PAUSE]  Yeah.  Um, so what are the shows you like?
R:  Well, I like to watch movies.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  We get cable and I can have my choice of, um, HBO, Cinemax, Showtime, and the Movie Channel.
L:  Great.  Where do you see, um, the -- the future of reality television?  Do you -- you think it's kind of, ah, you know, gain more appeal, get more popular, or it'll kind of --
R:  I think it'll --
L:  -- fizzle out?
R:  -- be -- I think it'll sort of fizzle out.
L:  Yeah, that's what I think too, um, because you could never have -- 'cause people like, you know -- th- they -- I guess they get -- they -- they tire quickly of the same thing.
R:  Right.
L:  Like, you know, Survivor was, like, really huge and, you know, it -- you would see it in --
R:  We watched that Big Brother show.
L:  Yeah -- yeah -- yeah.  Shows like that are not coming back.  I mean, it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just not happening. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah. [PAUSE] 
L:  Yeah.  I hear the, ah -- the Actors Guild and all these other, um, organizations have a big, ah, problem with reality television because of actors.  Th- -- ah, they're not getting jobs or acting gigs.  What do you think about that?
R:  Some of those reality shows have actors in 'em.
L:  Yeah -- yeah, that's -- that's -- that's another topic I was gonna bring up too.  Um, what do you think, ah -- like, for example you mentioned Joe +Millionaire.  Do you think actual Joe Millionaire was an actor, or was it scripted?  Or do you think it's all based on --
R:  Well, he has been an actor one --
L:  I'm -- I'm --
R:  -- time, hasn't he? 
L:  Yeah.  Do you think it's based on spont- spontaneity or -- or is --
R:  I think --
L:  -- it --
R:  -- some of that --
L:  -- scripted?   
R:  -- is -- is rehearsed.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Some of his speeches to the girls -- I think he was pre- -- those were prepared by hand by the crew or some --
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  -- scriptwriter.
L:  I think so too, 'cause the produ- -- the producers, you know, if they see that the show is not going so well -- it's going as exciting as it should be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think they do manipulate and step in, in order to make it more interesting, you know.
R:  Right.  They probably do that.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, I -- I've heard of, ah -- ah, reality television diversifying now.  I don't know if you've heard about The Real Cancun?
R:  The what?
L:  The latest movie.  The -- The Real Cancun.  It's a movie that just came out about, ah, ca- -- about spring break.
R:  'Bout what?  Spring Break?
L:  Well, yeah.  There's -- it's, like, the very first, ah, reality movie.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's, like -- it -- it's from the -- from the same people that brought, you know, The Real World and all those other shows. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I think it's diversifying --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- in that way --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- into film.
R:  Ah.  I -- I -- I -- I haven't heard anything about that.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  Um, well --
R:  Is -- is it --
L:  -- anyway --
R:  -- out yet?
L:  Yeah, it's out in theaters.  Ah, what city are you in?
R:  Cincinnati.
L:  Cincinnati.  I'm in Los Angles.  So, I guess it might not be there.  Who knows?
R:  It's not here.  I don't think it's here.
L:  Say it again.
R:  I don't think it's here.
L:  Mm.
R:  My wife and mother in law went to a movie last night and, ah, they brought home a list of the movies, and that wasn't one of them.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  They have different shows in different cities.
L:  Right -- right.
R:  Did you like the show?
L:  Did I -- do I like certain shows?
R:  Did you like that show -- that movie?
L:  Yeah.  It was, ah -- it was very interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but it -- it did seem a little bit scripted, like -- you know, like some of the things that -- that were on the movie were, you know, predetermined to work --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- out in a certain way --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in ord- -- for the entertainment value, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, or else, you know -- 'cause you have to think about it.  It would take a lot of time in the cutting room floor to come up with those gems, you know, those precious --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- you know, funny moments or, you know, dramatic moments.
R:  Right. 
L:  But, I -- I think -- I think it's a lot easier if they're just scripted and, you know, kind of manipulated by the producers or directors, et cetera. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah. [PAUSE] 
R:  Reality TV is, um -- well, they're changing it all the time.  I saw -- I watched, I guess, this show The Bachelor.  Have you watched that?
L:  Yeah, I saw The Bachelor.  It was a couple of times.
R:  It was on last night.
L:  Um, I didn't see it last night.  I did see the -- the premiere.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, I think that was, like, a week ago.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, I --
R:  Well, they're down to three girls now.
L:  Oh really?  Wow.  It's getting a lot of -- a lot of publicity.  I know it's -- it's a huge, ah, cash generating machine, I would say.
R:  Yeah.  It's, ah, mostly for young people, I think, um.  It's, like, for --
L:  Well, I --
R:  -- the people twenty to thirty five, I think.
L:  Right -- right. [NOISE]
R:  And, um, maybe even younger, I don't know.  But -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- you're over thirty five or forty that -- that's a little bit old stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, they have a -- I mean, they have all kinds of reality TV now.
L:  True. [PAUSE]  Um, [COUGH] [PAUSE] do you see, ah, Big Brother making a comeback or anything like that?
R:  We sort of liked that show, but it hasn't come back.  Maybe they --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- didn't find anybody that wanted to live --
L:  You know -- you know --
R:  -- in --
L:  -- you know what's rea- --
R:  -- isolation for that long.
L:  Yeah.  You know what's really popular?  It's those, ah, reality dating shows.  Have you heard about those?
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  Like -- like Elimidate, Blind Date, um -- what's that other --
R:  Married --
L:  -- one?
R:  -- by America?
L:  Th- -- no.  The Fifth Wheel.
R:  No, I haven't --
L:  No, these are --
R:  Haven't heard of them.
L:  These are daily shows.  Um, I think it's on --
R:  Every day?
L:  UPN -- on UPN and Fox.
R:  On during the day you mean?
L:  Ah, not during the day.  I guess, ah -- well, here in LA it's -- they come out something like five through seven pm.
R:  Yeah.  No, I haven't heard about any of those.
L:  Yeah.  And those are very, very popular among people my age, ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in their twenties.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, that's -- that's -- there -- there was just one show, like I would say, about -- about three years ago.  It was Blind Date.  Now there's, like, three or four, you know.  So --
R:  I haven't ever heard of them.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  May or -- it may or may not be your thing, but it's -- it's very entertaining.
R:  Yeah.  Is it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh. [PAUSE]  Hm. [PAUSE] 
L:  Um, [COUGH] --
R:  I know some of these shows end up addictive.
L:  Say it again. [NOISE] 
R:  Some of these shows -- you have an addictive -- 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah -- yeah, I know.  It's [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] [NOISE] Hm. [PAUSE] [NOISE] Have you seen the movie, um, The Running Man?
R:  The what?
L:  The Running Man? [NOISE]
R:  Running Man?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Run- --
