R:  Hi, I've never watched a reality TV show.
L:  I hate 'em too, don't worry.
R:  Oh, well, let's see.  Um, um, um, um, okay, so today I was, uh, listening to the, uh, radio, I'm afraid.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I was -- I was -- I'm afraid I was listening -- I think it was -- it was -- it was just, sort of, this mainstream, uh, rock, pop station, I'm afraid.  And --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, um, but it -- that's a sort of like, you know, the -- the like really brash macho, like, DJ guy was, um, um, uh, was -- was going on -- off about, I think it was -- was, um, you know, it was -- was like American Idol, girls in Playboy where he's had a subscription to it for twenty --
L:  Really.
R:  Twenty or so -- no, no, no, no.  I mean I know you hear this, like, you know, girl voice on the other end but a- actually I was -- I -- anyway but it was just the whole -- it was the whole -- whole thing.  Um, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know like fake human emotions.
L:  What's that?
R:  Like fake human emotions.  Like [inaudible] cheesy.  Would you ever participate in one?
L:  Uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.
R:  You -- you would, oh.  Totally why -- why would you d- -- what would you -- which ones do you like?
L:  Uh, what's that CDs you say?
R:  The what?
L:  [MN]  I'm sorry, I lost you.  What's the [inaudible]?
R:  Oh.  Uh, I'm from the -- I'm from the south.  Are there an- -- are there any -- are you -- are you sort of in --
L:  No.
R:  -- the south?
L:  No, I'm in, uh, New York City area.
R:  Oh, you are too.  Um.  Well, let's see.  Um, well, is there -- which one would you like?
L:  Uh.  [MN]  What are talking about?  Wh- which one what?
R:  I think it's like -- I don't know, any TV show.  You would probably know the TV show better, the T- -- the reality TV shows better.
L:  Um.  [LIPSMACK]  I watched, like, uh, Joe Millionaire once or twice.  
R:  Oh, what was that like?
L:  [SIGH]  It was, um, it was pretty lame, actually.  Um.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, I mean, uh, the guy just looked like a neanderthal.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, all the girls they were -- they were, you know, pretty enough but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I don't know.  My -- they're all like carbon copies of the same hot chick basically. And, uh ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, definitely more looks than brains.
R:  Oh, I think --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that's -- I think they [inaudible] --
L:  It was pretty bad.  It was pretty bad.
R:  Oh, really?  Well, I think [inaudible] are important but, um, what happened in that -- in the episode that you watched?
L:  Uh, he was like taking 'em on a train ride.  He took like a couple of them on a train ride, or something like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, he's talking to -- it seemed like he was paying attention to -- to one and the other ones not at all.  Like doing some, like, you know, uh, sexy train ride, like a Orient Express type deal.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Where it was just like, maybe, [SIGH] the six of them on the train, like, you know.  And, uh, I think they also had to, uh, uh, shovel the coal to, you know, get the train going too, so they were driving it as well.  So, it's not like a Amtrak train, it was like a -- like a old school, like Little House on the Prairie train and ...
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, they +were not only, um, on it but they had to shovel coal to make it go too.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, of course, some of the girls like "Ew, my nails.  I'm breaking a nail".  
R:  Oh, yeah, well --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- nail po -- nail polish -- nail polish is all right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  But, um ...
L:  I mean some of them could handle it and some of them were just like "Oh my God.  Like, I have to shovel coal". 
R:  Oh no.
L:  They totally, yeah.  They were missing the point of it, yeah.
R:  Would -- would you participate in, like, a reality TV show?  You said you would, right?
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I guess --
R:  You would?  Like what would you --
L:  For the money.  'Cause I'm greedy, yeah.  Uh, I don't know.  If I could I fit into something that wouldn't interfere with my life too much.  I would do -- I would --
R:  Yeah, something that wouldn't, like, you know, you wouldn't have to, like, move there and live there, like in the Real World for --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- like, a whole year.
L:  You know what, I would probably do that 'cause the house is pretty nice.
R:  Oh, yeah, it was pretty cool.  Like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- okay. 
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Well what about Survi- -- okay, well, oh, wh- which Real World, um, year did you like the most?
L:  Um, probably liked the first one.  Like the, you know, when it first started, like.
R:  Was it Puck[?]?  Was that the first one?  Or --
L:  No, I think the f- -- the first one was in New York.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, it was in Manhattan.  Yeah. They had this -- I -- I know where -- it was this place in Soho.
R:  Really?
L:  Yes.  It's, like, gorgeous, like [LAUGH] real big place.
R:  What was it -- what was that one like?  I didn't -- I love -- I love MTV [MN].
L:  It was, like, a gay guy, a black rapper chick.
R:  Uh-huh.  Go on.
L:  And some pretty boy model type.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, what the fuck else?  Oh, some, you know, long hair type, uh, you know, white guitar player and, uh ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  There was, like, a dancer, like a ballerina type female.  It -- it -- I don't know, it was the first one.  That was the one, uh, that I remember.  I guess that was like in the late eighties.  That's a long time ago.
R:  It is a long time ago.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think I was in high school then.
L:  Right.  Yeah, me too.  Well just out of it or something like that.  But, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I guess that's when I had the time to sit around and watch that.  Or when I actually cared about MTV, I guess.
R:  Right.  Oh, but --
L:  [COUGH]  And it was before, like, every other show was a typical, just one like it, you know.
R:  I would [MN] much rather talk about MTV than reality shows, but I think we have to talk about reality shows.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Shoot, that's too bad.  Okay, let's see.  Um.
L:  Well, the Real World's reality.  That's one.
R:  Okay, good.  Um, what other [several inaudible words].  Let's see I have a -- let's see, um, Real World being [inaudible] make it twenty six is sort of like the cut off.  Um ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  What do you think about, like, people as types?  Like it was interesting you were talking about, like, on Joe Millionaire how, um, like the women seem like carbon copies of each other and then you were also mentioning on the Real World how like [MN], you know, how MTV stacked it with different types.  Like there's only one slot for the white suburban guy and there's --
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  -- only --
L:  Yeah.  That's when I notice, yeah.  It was like, you know, usually one or two token non white.  Well, let me not say that but there's usually like, you know, a token thug in the group, like, you know, whether he's black or white, like one token thug.  Always one goody goody girl, you know, straight up church or whatever.
R:  Right, [inaudible] twenty -- twenty one years old.  Like --
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  -- never [several inaudible words].  Exactly.  Um, I wonder did you ever, like, like any particular character?
L:  Um.  [LIPSMACK]  Not -- not really.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, rea- --
L:  [MN]  Not really.  I'm -- don't worry about that for a while.  Not really.  They were all, uh, mm, the first one's kind of interesting.  Uh, [SIGH] um, [MN] obviously not, because none of them are standing out in my brain right now.  
R:  Um.
L:  I'd have to say no to that.  There's nobody that stood out [several inaudible words].
R:  Well, like, what -- I guess -- I guess why do you think that reality TV is so -- shows are so big?  Like, why do you think that they're -- pe- -- they're getting, sort of, like higher ratings than --
L:  I can -- well I don't know why the higher ratings, but I can --
R:  -- sitcom fiction?
L:  I've -- I've put thought into this.  Um, I know why there's so many of 'em.
R:  Why?
L:  Because, uh, the production of 'em's cheap.
R:  Right.
L:  You got to understand to do a typical hour show, like an hour drama, or something like that, like let's say NYPD Blue or something like that.  It's costing one point five to two million dollars per episode -- per hour episode to make.
R:  Well what's weird is that --
L:  How much would a -- [LAUGH] no, [MN] let me finish my thought.
R:  [MN]  Sorry.
L:  How much would it really cost you to put a camera in somebody's room or follow somebody round with a digital camcorder?
R:  Right.
L:  And just record, like, just let the tape roll.  
R:  Right.  And, like endless people who are, like, pretty much willing to do it for free.
L:  Sure [inaudible] pretty much like.  I mean, you don't have to pay me a million dollars an episode.  I'd do it, like, you know, if you want to get an hour worth of footage off a me.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You want fours worth of footage to edit it down to one hour.
R:  Mm.
L:  Give me, like, uh, buy me a pizza.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you'll do it to --
L:  You don't have to pay me a million dollars and, you know, well, I mean, so that's the reason why there's so many of 'em so ...
R:  That's a very good point.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wonder though, like, [MN] I mean [inaudible] TV stations they get access to the airwaves for free.  And -- but there's -- [MN] so why do they have to, sort of, keep down costs.  [MN]  Um, and I mean, I guess, aren't advertisers still willing to pay like tons just for like a spot, not just on the Superbowl but for like, even like some really horribly graded sitcom.  I think in terms of, like, money in and money out.  Like -- like they could afford -- TV could afford to kind of pay it's own way before so why not now?
L:  It's -- I think it has to do with all the greed.  It's just about corporate greed basically.
R:  Like product placement in Friends or whatever.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, everybody's out to make more money and stuff like that so it -- it's just all greed.  So, um, if you, uh -- if you had a product to advertise it [MN] really wouldn't matter if you put it on like a horrible show or a really popular show.  There's still potential to make a lot of money from just putting on advertising, regardless of whether one million people watch it or nine million people.  If you paid a +load of money for the -- the crappy show --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you still have the potential to make a lot of money.  And you can actually find a niche if you keep doing that as opposed to, you know, putting it on a top rated show which might cost you, you know, three, four, five times what --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it would to be a horrible one.
R:  That's very intelligent.  I never thought of that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I have -- [LAUGH] no, I'm like "Oh".
L:  Yeah.  No, I mean I put thought into it, yeah.  [several inaudible words].
R:  Why -- why, may I ask at all, why you've put so much thought into [LAUGH] it?  Like, I'm impressed.
L:  Uh, no, I just have interest in -- in, uh, production, stuff like that.  It's -- it's -- it's what I do.
R:  Interesting.
L:  Yeah, like TV and stuff like that, production.
R:  Like --
L:  Yeah, film
R:  -- acting and produ- -- that's good.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I mean I've sat around, thought about, you know, stuff like that, yeah.
R:  So you've thought about -- so you -- huh.  Um, well I have, uh, hm, um, well if you could watch like one category of TV only, would it not be reality shows?
L:  It would not be anything except -- if -- what, you want me to pick one or you want me to --
R:  Oh, no or just talk about, I don't know.
L:  Um.  [SIGH]  I would say, like, uh, something, like, uh, action type shows.  Like I could deal with that.  Like maybe, uh, a drama, hour long drama.
R:  You would like that?
L:  Yeah.  That would -- you know, watch that non stop.  Or cartoon
