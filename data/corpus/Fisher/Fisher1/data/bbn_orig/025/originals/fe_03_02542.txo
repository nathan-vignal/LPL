L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  How are you?
L:  Oh, good.  My name's Susan.
R:  I'm Stephanie.
L:  Stephanie?  I'm in --
R:  D- --
L:  -- Hawaii.  Where are you, Stephanie?
R:  I'm in Texas.
L:  Oh my.  World of survivors. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  So, we're supposed to talk about the right -- reality shows?
R:  The rel- reality TV shows.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, I could say myself, personally, I'm guilty of watching a few of 'em.  Um --
L:  Me too. [LAUGH]
R:  A lot of 'em I see on TV, I see the commercial for it and I just say, "Oh, this is trash and I'm not gonna go watch it".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, that -- ah, like, this one that just came out, Mr Personality.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just, you know -- I couldn't get into that.  Um, Who Wants To Mar- -- ah, Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire, I've never been into those.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, now believe it or not, I did find myself watching the one that, um -- um, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] oh, what was it?  Married By America.  And --
L:  I haven't seen that.  I haven't -- the only ones that I have watched is Survivors.  And --
R:  And --
L:  -- I'm pretty much --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- gotten hooked on Survivors and, um -- um, basically I haven't seen any of the other ones.  I -- have you ever watched, like, the one where they have the people locked up in a house, and they --
R:  Ah, the -- ah, I think it's called something like The Manor House or something like that.
L:  They keep --
R:  I haven't watched it personally.
L:  I haven't either.
R:  Um, I saw one not too long ago -- I started out watching it -- where -- it's one with this family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They were competing for one million dollars.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, after a while -- I think I watched maybe two shows of it, and after that it's, like, "Okay. Yeah", you know? [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "Ah, this is not worth too much".  But, um, I'm guilty of watching the ones where I have a vote in what -- you know, in what I see and --
L:  Oh.  Like, um --
R:  -- what goes on and who stays, like American Idol.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, that's not -- that's not a reality TV show.  But, um, the one --
L:  Yeah.  My hus- -- ah, my husband's hooked on that one.  Um --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But I like the Survivors, and it's -- they -- they say one of the questions is why we think they're popular.  And I think they're popular -- people watch those shows because they can actually visualize themselves doing those things.  They actually think that they themselves could participate.  I mean, I -- I think that's why I watch Survivor, is because I -- I think I could probably go there and do it. [PAUSE]  What do you think?  Why do you think they're so popular?
R:  W- w- --the reason I really think they're so popular is because people are just trying to get away from everyday normal life.  
L:  Oh.  From reality?
R:  Um, yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, you know --
L:  They're --
R:  -- they're --
L:  -- watching reality shows to get away from reality?  Actually I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I think you're probably right.
R:  And I mean, because the thing is, is that even though these are reality TV shows --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people -- half the people who watch those shows--
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they don't ei- -- they either don't have enough nerve to even consider doing something like that.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  Or they don't think they have enough ability to do anything like that, so --
L:  Right.
R:  You know, they sit there and they watch it.  And, you know, it's like you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- said, they wished they could do it, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they get so involved in it.  But, a lot of people who watch reality TV shows really wouldn't consider even doing half -- like, Fear Factor.  Half those people wouldn't go on there and eat, you know, goats' brains and --
L:  Oh God.
R:  -- and things like that, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  That's why I don't watch that particular one, because to me it's disgusting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- thing with Survivors when they had the episode where they have to eat the worms or whatever, I -- that's the one I always do missed because that to me is yuk.  Um --
R:  I understand that.
L:  [LAUGH] So, um, let's see.  Um, well, we covered why they -- we think they're popular.  Um, what else -- 
R:  But, um --
L:  -- can we say? 
R:  I mean, I believe they also said, like, to discuss, ah, some of the ones you watch.  But, you know, you basically -- ah, you said you watch Survivor.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  And, um --
L:  -- only watch Survivor.  An- and you?  Which ones do you watch?
R:  Um, I have watched I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here.  Um, like I said, I tend to watch those TV reality shows that I can vote on.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  Ah, I watched Married By America.  Ah, believe it or not, I did get into Joe Millionaire.
L:  Oh.  Did you watch that one?
R:  I got into it right at the end.  Um, I think I might have saw, um -- I saw the last two or three episodes, where he was down to two women.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  Um, and I believe those were the last two or three episodes, so I, um -- I -- wh- what I usually do when it comes to those shows, I watch the first show to see who's all competitive.
L:  Mhm.
R:  No, who all the competitors are.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then after that I, you know, watch the last show to see who won.  You know, because, ah, I think the first, um -- the first guy, ah -- Who, ah -- Who Wants to Marry -- was it a Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire?
L:  Yeah, Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire.
R:   Oh, no -- no --no -- no. It was -- yeah.  I think that was the first show.  But, The Bachelor -- the first Bachelor, that was enough.  Once you --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- watched the first Bachelor you knew how the rest of 'em were gonna go.  You know, The Bachelorette and -- I mean, it's -- ah, I did -- I -- I watched the last show of that.  I did not watch the first Bachelorette --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I did watch the last two shows, when she was down to the last two men.
L:  Did you --
R:  But --
L:  -- watch the new one that's coming out, with Monica Lewinsky?
R:  No, I'm not watching Mr Personality.  Um --
L:  No, I haven't seen it either.  And what do you think about her --
R:  I did --
L:  -- being a, um, person on that show?  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What do you think of them --
R:  I just figure anything that has Monica Lewinsky hosting it is probably trash.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I just, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm sorry.  I just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- really do.
L:  It's very strange that she gets a job, um, or a position doing that just because of having sex with the President.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I -- pretty -- pretty sleazy -- pretty sleazy.
R:  Very sleazy. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Especially for, um, personal gain.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, that's just really awful.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  That's just really awful, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I mean, that was -- that was her main reason.  Um --
L:  [MN]
R:  She knew that when she went into that situation there was a something -- there was a chance of something to happen to her, like it did.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And unfortunately it didn't really blow up as big she wanted it to, 'cause she wanted to get paid --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, out of it.  But I mean, you know, she -- she -- basically she's ruined her life and her career, because look at where she's at now.  She was a intern --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on her way to probably being some type of Congress woman.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she demoralized herself.  But now, you know, she's doing T- -- you know, TV +reality shows on, um, somebody who is supposed to be picking somebody over their personality, of all things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause I don't bet she picked Bill Clinton over his personality.  I'm sure he's a pretty nice guy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, you know, I think if at any point in time if it -- if it was any President she would have did it.
L:  Yes.
R:  So --
L:  Well -- 
R:  I just --
L:  -- anybody --
R:  -- don't think it --
L:  -- in -- in a power position, she would've.
R:  Yeah.  I think helped that he was attractive.
L:  Mm.
R:  So --
L:  You think Bill Clinton's attractive?
R:  Well, it -- when he first got into office --
L:  I -- I -- I -- liked --
R:  I --
L:  -- his hair, and that was all.
R:  Ah, when he -- when he first got into office --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when it -- 'cause of -- after he got out of office, his hair was grey --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that he was -- he was starting to age.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But -- but if -- if you look can look back to nineteen ninety two, I believe --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when Bill Clinton first got elected.  He had that dark hair --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he was very distinguished looking.  He was an attractive man.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He really was.
L:  He is -- he was good looking.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, there's nothing that'll age a man faster than being the President.  If you've never --
R:  Yeah, 'cause --
L:  -- noticed --
R:  -- Bush --
L:  -- when they've --
R:  -- has started to look his age and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he hadn't even been in there two -- three years yet. 
L:  Yes -- yes.  As a matter --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- of fact he's on TV right now.
R:  Is he?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, I think they've shown that here.  Is that the one where he's giving the speech -- the address? 
L:  Yeah, we saw that.  Now he's somewhere else.  They're just showing it on the news.
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  Ah, um, yeah.  But anyway, um, to -- that's a real reality show, watching the troops --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- over there.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.  Um, I don't know.  I think -- and I think that's another thing too, people get so hooked into reality TV shows because it's really hard nowadays to distinguish reality from fiction.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, you -- you -- you know, you see things on Who Wants To Be A Mar -- ah, Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire, and Bachelorette, and, you know, I'm -- I'm, um, A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, what's the other shows?  Um --
L:  Well, there is one that's -- that the kids watch, that's called Jackass or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I -- I keep reading different articles where these stupid teenage kids, and younger, watch those shows and then they do that to themselves, like set themselves on fire.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, s- some of 'em have gotten really injured --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because they watch that on their reality shows, and then they think they can do it, which is really stupid.
R:  Yeah.  And I think -- I mean I think, um, that's -- that's what's so hard about, like -- you know, they call it reality TV shows --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so these kids see Jackass, and they see these guys doing these stunts and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- get injured.  But you know what?  They survive.
L:  Right.
R:  So, why can't we do it, because this is reality TV?  These guys actually are doing these stunts.
L:  That's an excellent --
R:  You know?
L:  -- point, Stephanie.
R:  So, you know -- so why can't we do it, because, you know -- you know, I've -- I've seen a few of those shows and they've shown Johnny Knoxville a few times -- I mean, he's been on crutches and he's had a broken leg and broken arm.  And I -- like I said, these -- I mean, these kids still watch it and stuff.  And --
L:  Yeah.  What is he?  A person like Evil Kenevil or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I've never seen it.  Mm.
R:  So, I mean, you know, it's -- it's -- I mean, they do some horrendous stunts.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, it's real -- I mean, it's just awful.
L:  Hm.
R:  Um --
L:  I -- I've never seen it, but I sure have read a different -- a couple of different times, articles in newspapers about kids who have -- who have, um, really injured themselves, severely, trying to do some of those stunts.  And then their parents turn arou- -- are suing the show --
