L:  Hi, I'm Mary Davis.
R:  Hi, I'm Rachel Strum.
L:  Hi, Rachel.
R:  Hi.  How are you?
L:  Fine.  How are you?
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  We're supposed to talk about arms inspections in Iraq.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh --
R:  And --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  Okay.  Um --
L:  You wanna go first?
R:  Sure. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, basically, I mean, they've already done a lot [LAUGH] now of damage there.
L:  Correct.
R:  I think they should still -- they should have an idea about how much a- arms is there at this point but I think it's more important just to get the right people in charge there and then it wouldn't be such a concern.
L:  Mhm.
R:  What about you [MN]?
L:  Um, well, obviously, yes, they've disarmed Iraq already and it was a major priority for President Bush.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I think that, um -- I think they should do everything they can to help the country rebuild itself.
R:  Right.
L:  And to support the people and to find out what their real needs are.  Um, I think it's important, um -- I think it's important that they evaluate the damage done, you know, like into really t- -- not only relief for food but like the hospitals like they're trying to do and I think they should stay with the project from beginning to end.  The troubleshooting not only, um, you know, to see the effects of rebuilding the city and if it, um -- you know, if i- -- if that -- if that has been succe- successfully accomplished --
R:  Right.
L:  You know to --
R:  I think they have to or we're going to be hated by every country in the world [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.
R:  [MN]
L:  But they're -- you know, the thing that they did after the, um -- the desert storm thing where I felt like they just kind of abandoned the people and so did -- so did the people there and -- you know, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think that -- I hope that they learn from that mistake and not to do it again and also more importantly to make sure that the -- the leadership that takes over understands about, you know, how we totally feel about the weapons capability and, you know, being totally disarmed, so 
R:  Right.  I think there's already some misunderstanding there 'cause I know I've spoken to some -- with people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who can read the Middle East papers in their native languages --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the people there, a lot of them, are already worried that the reason we went into it is oil.
L:  Right.
R:  And if we don't take a real civilian effort and Good Samaritan effort I think that concern's just gonna grow.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Exactly.  Um, yeah, because, you know, maybe -- maybe the answer is just part -- you know, selfish on our part, you know, and that, yes, we want, you know, access to oil and -- and -- and sure I can unde- -- I can understand that part too but, you know, I think that their new government in place should, you know, understand what our needs our and what their needs are and, you know, how to -- how to keep the peace in the Middle East, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and totally, you know, work towards, you know, that compromise is whatever it takes and -- you know, and to involve the United Nations so this won't happen again.  You know, I could see it like being a -- a repeat in Syria if we're not -- you know, if we're not careful and they're not careful and, you know, a -- and, um -- and I just hope we've found Saddam Hussein.  I don't know that we have.  I'm not sure about some of the things that I've seen on the news in the past.
R:  Right.
L:  You know --
R:  Well, now, I mean, the main thing they're toting on the news is who they've arrested each day --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- instead of what's really going on in the country.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  And --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I think it would be a disservice to Americans if they don't keep us posted about that or if they try to hide things that they're, you know, h- -- you know, God forbid, not accomplishing. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] And things like that.  So, um -- so, what else d- do you think?  I know there's -- uh, it's like you could go on talking about these things all day and go off in different directions --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, I don't know how focused we need to stay on 
R:  Right.  Um --
L:  On the question at hand.
R:  Well, I mean, as far as like --
L:  Ten minutes is a long time [LAUGH].
R:  I know.  It is a really long time [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It's like -- um, as far as -- I mean, I think it's a weird thing too is they were happy focusing on arms inspections as far as the topic and it's kind of more of a moot point at this point.
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah.
R:  'Cause -- yeah, 'cause they've already -- I mean, they've uncovered -- you know, they've told us in very, I guess, vague terms that they've uncovered, you know, some weapons and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they've seen different labs but --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, it's almost like even -- I think there needs to be more third parties going in there because it seems like the US is even being too vague about what's in there and that's what they're saying Iraq was guilty of.
L:  Um, uh-huh.
R:  Like, I don't know if it's like -- I don't know if other countries that aren't involved have any idea what they're finding.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, what's happening to it?  Like --
L:  But --
R:  -- is it all going into the United States am- -- um, ammunition homes or ?
L:  I'm sorry.  What --
R:  Is it -- and they're also really not saying what's happening to all the weapons.
L:  Oh, right.
R:  Is the US just collecting it all up and bringing it back [MN]?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or are they sharing or are they leaving some?  Do they have protection or ?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  W- -- you know, if they found something, you know, like biochemicals, what are they doing to safeguard that they're not being sold --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or used by another cou- -- by another country?  You know, what are th- -- what steps is the UN taking or the US or a combination to -- to make sure that it's disposed of properly.
R:  Right.
L:  You know --
R:  Or if it's being kept somewhere?  That's kind of scary 'cause --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- if it's not being [LAUGH] disposed of.
L:  Oh, yeah.  You know, because I think that -- I think that's where other countries have, like, "Oh, we'll just sell these to, you know --"
R:  Right.
L:  Unbeknown to them terrorists and then, you know, u- -- be used against them.  I think that's --
R:  Right.  Then --
L:  -- kind of naive.
R:  -- we'll be doing this in ten years again. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  You know, and then [LAUGH] -- and just through -- you know, they're tra- -- Iraq's track record I think we just need to be more and more careful and I think other countries need to be careful about that too.
R:  Well, I think they're even naively, like, "Oh, yeah, we arrested this person and this person".
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they still don't know where Saddam Hussein is and --
L:  Right.  You know.
R:  -- I mean, the smartest thing he can do right now is act dead [LAUGH].  So, if you don't get everything out of there --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- I mean, he can just -- who knows what's going on behind the scenes.
L:  Exactly.  You know --
R:  The old Iraqi regime.
L:  Uh-huh.  And I'd --
R:  [MN]
L:  I'd really like to -- to -- did she interrupt us?
R:  No.
L:  Oh.  And I'd like to really under- -- you know, [MN] it's -- it's -- you know, it's great that they're finding these things.  It's great they're helping the people but, you know, I'd like to hear more about, like, are any of these people that they have arrested, like, given the man up?  You know, I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I'd really, really like to know whether his sons and himself are alive or dead, you know.  Are they truly in Syria?  Did they get out?
R:  Or are these people -- he has so much control he could be forcing these people to turn themselves in --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- as a big act, like --
L:  Right.  You know, because --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I don't put anything past this j- -- this -- this individual.
R:  Right.
L:  I think he's very, very dangerous and I think they need to, you know [MN] --
R:  And I think the media right now has to make it like everything's going hunky dory.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or people would be really upset.
L:  Right.  Because I -- you know, I could just see the man ge- -- you know, Syria's given him safe haven.  W- what's saying he doesn't have control of that country?
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and what saying he's not going to do it over again or he's gonna pop up somewhere.  You can't tell me that, you know, he -- he didn't escape somewhere and take stuff with him.  I mean, I don't think the man's that dumb [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] So, a- -- you know, a- and it's like --
R:  And there's still enough people there who are so still controlled.  Just they've been controlled by him for -- uh, for years.  They're going to do anything to save him.
L:  Right.  Right.  I mean, that's how they've been brought up as children so it's pretty ingrained and it's -- and it's really -- it's really a sa- sad case but I guess I'd like to -- to assume that our government -- give it more credit.
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  You know, that, wow, they're really tracking him.  Don't worry.  But they don't do any -- they don't take any steps that reinforce -- reinforce that in the media so I don't really know.
R:  Yeah.  It's kind of just scary too because, I mean, the whole Osama Bin Laden thing went away for Saddam and now Saddam seems to -- his name's vanishing more and, like, "Oh, we think we know where Osama Bin Laden is now".
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, it's seems like they're constantly trying to redirect the public's focus.
L:  Right.  R- right.  Yeah.  And on a -- yeah.  I agree.  I don't like that either.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, um, w- what else can we talk about?
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.
L:  I think we've got another minute.
R:  Oh, is it?
L:  Yeah, it --
R:  Okay.
L:  I haven't been timing it but I did just look at my clock and it said two oh nine but, um, you know, yeah, this is kind of like the -- a funny question.  They need to revamp this one. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Because it's -- yeah.  It's a little broad.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Well, m- -- yeah.
R:  Like, are they talking about whether we had a right to send in inspectors at first or ?
L:  Uh-huh.  Or do you think that disarming Iraq should be a major priority for the US?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know, well, --
R:  Well, it's --
L:  -- it already is and --
R:  It should be a priority --
L:  -- it already was --
R:  -- for somebody but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I don't know if was really -- it needed to be the US in the beginning.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I have mixed feelings.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  At first, I was, you know -- which was -- you know, was interesting.  I think the man's scary and I think that they should have paid attention to him a long time ago.
R:  Right.  And they --
L:  You know, we pr- --
R:  -- never really finished the first time so [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.  And if we would have maybe paid attention to that maybe we wouldn't be in this big -- you know, this -- we wouldn't have gotten in this mess even though I think we've handled it just fine.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and I -- I'm really proud of the troops.  Don't get me wrong but I didn't want us to go into Iraq.  I didn't want us to mess with it.
R:  No.  Because it's like you're opening a new can of worms if you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because the people you're dealing with who are on their side are -- who knows what they're capable of.
L:  Mhm.  Because I do under the bottom line think it's -- it's -- you know, that it's -- it's very strong religion and it's about money and power and oil and they don't feel equal, you know, and so I just think that they didn't address some of maybe the real -- the real issues of what was going on with them because I --
R:  Well, the whole thing is just a little too much coincidence, like the Bush and --
L:  Mhm.  'Cause -- yeah.  'Cause when they hit this --
R:  Like when Clinton was in p- power all this wasn't really a problem or [LAUGH] a huge priority.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And now it came right back to being a priority.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So it kind of seems shady.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, so I -- you know, at first I just didn't want them to -- you know, I didn't wanna m- -- I didn't want 'em to mess with it.  Not only for the people and the children there and stuff like that, you know, but because I think it can be -- we're heavily misconstrued when it's about -- you know, when they wanna twist --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it around and focus --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on religion.
R:  Right.
L:  As Osama Bin Laden did with, you know, nine eleven and -- and how it was, you know, fateful to -- to --
