R:  Hi, I'm Bruce.
L:  Hi, my name's Lacey.  How are you?
R:  Good.  Good.
L:  Good.
R: Yeah.
L:  So, we're suppose --
R:  This is my first time on, so I don't really know what's going on.
L:  Me too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, I guess we're supposed to talk about reality based TV shows?
R:  Yeah.  And we -- basically, all we watch here is Survivor.  So, um, I -- I --
L:  Oh.  I don't, sort of, I don't watch much Survivor.  I watch -- what do I watch?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um.  Gosh.  Um, there's one -- oh, what is it called?  Something about, um, [LIPSMACK] [LIPSMACK] Fear Factor, that's what it's called.  Where they eat --
R:  Oh, yeah.  I see -- I -- we've seen that once in a while.  I don't really care for that one.
L:  Yeah, and I don't --
R:  And -- and Survivor's bad enough.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Okay.
R:  But it's interesting.  It gets interesting, you know, [MN] -- when they're pulling their little games w- with each other and ...
L:  Yeah.  I've watched -- I s- -- I watched the first Survivor and it was pretty interesting.  My mom watches it so ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um.  What are -- I don't understand what we're supposed -- are we supposed to talk about?
R:  We're just -- just talk about things for, uh, eight minutes, I guess.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  It -- it doesn't really say what.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They bring up -- bring up a topic, you know, Survi- -- the, uh, reality games but [LAUGH] neither one of us do that.  Are you a --
L:  Right.
R:  -- student at college, I guess?  I don't know we just --
L:  Um.
R:  -- go on and see what happens.
L:  No, I'm -- actually I, um, work here in Hayley, Idaho.  I'm a legal assistant.
R:  Where at?
L:  Um.  Hayley, Idaho.
R:  Oh, Idaho.  Oh, my gosh.  We're in Wisconsin.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We're quite a ways away then.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Oh.  Was -- was Hayley up by Corteline, up that way, or where is that?
L:  Um, we're down south further.  Um --
R:  Oh.  By Boise?
L:  [inaudible].  Yes, we're close to Boise.  We're like, two hours away from Boise.  
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  All right.
L:  Um.  Sun Valley, Idaho?
R:  Y- [MN] like, I -- we've driven through to it many times so ...  But I -- I -- I kind of know that southern part, the, uh, interstate down there.  But ...
L:  Yeah, um, big ski resort.  It's --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  We -- we worked in campgrounds out in Washington and Oregon, and we'd go through there quite a bit.
L:  Oh, right on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We went to Oregon this last, um, November actually.
R:  Oh, skiing?
L:  [MN]  No.  We actu- -- we were, um -- my boyfriend's, uh, family lives there so we went over to have Thanksgiving, but I took a week off and, um, we kind of just drove around.  We went over to the coast and we dropped into California a little.  
R:  Oh.
L:  And then we went back up the coast.  [MN]  So it was nice.
R:  Oh, yeah, it's a nice country out there.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I like that -- we -- we  worked in the Mount Hood area for about a year.
L:  Oh.  It's a ski resort.
R:  Yeah.  Well, we -- we worked in the camp.  We managed campgrounds for the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the National Forest up there.  But it was right near that ski -- that ski thing up there on the hill.  Uh.
L:  Are -- have you always been from Wisconsin?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, you don't -- I'm -- I'm doing the whole -- I didn't -- I don't hear your accent very -- a lot.
R:  Well, uh, we -- I grew up in -- in, uh, Central Wisconsin but we left [MN] in -- when I was in the Service in fifty six and, basically, we've been out of state for -- [MN] let's say out of -- uh, we've been in state, maybe, five to ten years, in that period of time.  We'd come in for a while and then leave.  But we've been all over this United States.
L:  Huh.
R:  We go --
L:  I would love to do that.
R:  Yeah, we lived in Arkansas for a while.  We lived in ca- -- Oregon for a while.  We lived down in Illinois for a while.  We lived in Minnesota for a while.  We lived up in Alaska for a while and ...
L:  What part of Alaska?
R:  Uh, we worked out of Anchorage.
L:  Oh.  I, um, went up there a couple of years ago.  Um, and I worked out of Cordova. 
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  In a -- in a cannery.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay, [MN] the fish canneries.
L:  Yep.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I thought --
R:  Now --
L:  I thought I was going to make a lot of money and go to college but ...
R:  Oh, it d- -- it never works that way, does it?  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  And I -- I found out I was pregnant when I was up there.
R:  Oh no.  Oh no. 
L:  So I came home.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  But, yeah, so I didn't go to college --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but I'm doing a job that I really like, so ...
R:  Well, that's great.  That's a good deal.  Yeah, we spent -- I -- I work for, uh, air -- uh FA as an air traffic controller and we spent our four years in Anchorage at -- in a center out there.
L:  Oh.  
R:  And, uh --
L:  That'd be --
R:  -- we got to know the country pretty good.  That was back in the si- -- early sixties, so ...
L:  Huh.
R:  It was right after it had become a state.
L:  Wow.  I didn't realise it was only that long ago that it became a state.
R:  I think it was nineteen fifty nine [LAUGH] when they -- 
L:  Huh.
R:  Yeah.  And then Hawaii, I think, was right after that.  Yeah, --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it was kind -- it was interesting back then.  And then, of course, we left in sixty six, and come back down to Chicago and worked -- finished up down there.  But, anyway, uh, then -- then the oil thing hit up there and everything changed.
L:  Right.
R:  But -- pardon?
L:  I -- yes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  What?  I missed something.
L:  Oh.  No, I -- you said that you had worked up there and I said, "Oh".  I didn't --
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, I said something.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  Yeah, it was interesting.  But I been retired now for twenty years and we were just doing campground work and fooling around.
L:  I can't wait until retirement. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm -- I'm twenty three.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, you'll get --
L:  So.
R:  -- there.  It took a while.
L:  Some day.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know.
L:  But, yeah.  Oh.  Oh, I don't know, I like living here.  I've +never really lived anywhere and I don't -- I haven't travelled a lot.
R:  Oh, [MN] -- 
L:  But ...
R:  Did you grow up right there in Idaho?
L:  I did.  
R:  Oh.
L:  I've been -- I was born about seventy miles south of where I live now.  
R:  Oh.
L:  And -- but I -- then we moved up here, because my dad does construction and my mom, um, she works for the fire department.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So they moved up here and, um, I had to follow because I was in sixth grade and I've been --
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- right here.  I tried to move away to Alaska and I came right home.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [MN]
L:  But ...
R:  That's too bad that it --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- didn't work out.  Yeah.  I -- I've read about that.  [MN]  Even -- even when I was up there, I remember young people used to come up and work on board ship.  But that's hard -- very hard work and I -- the Cordova with the cannery, but there's another cannery down at Bristol Bay, I think it is.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, that's tough work.  [LAUGH]
L: It -- it wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for those long hours.
R:  Yeah?
L:  And, um, I was pregnant and I had no clue so ...
R:  Yeah, that -- that really --
L:  Um.
R:  -- makes it hard for you.
L:  They couldn't believe that I worked there as long as I did.  They were like -- and it didn't bug me.
R:  Oh.
L:  Like, as far as pregnancies go.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think I had a pretty easy one.
R:  Oh.
L:  But, um, but, uh, the doctors were just like, "Oh my God.  You're -- you're still doing this?  This is- -- this isn't right".  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So -- [MN] 'cause you work eight to twenty hours a day and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's prob- probably not the healthiest thing in the world.
R:  No, I wouldn't say so.  
L: But ...
R:  But, you know -- and what -- [MN] as long as you were in good health and strong, so I guess you were okay.
L:  Well, I was on some type of birth control.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That, um, [MN] I didn't -- I didn't have periods or anything, so I didn't find out I was pregnant until six months, when I found -- when I -- because I didn't gain any weight until like, I was seven months pregnant.
R:  I'll be darned.
L:  And ...
R:  It must a -- it must a grew also fast, then, huh?
L:  It -- and it did.  It was amazing how it just, like, popped out.  [LAUGH]  Fat tummy.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  But it w- -- I don't know, it was probably better that way because I don't know how I would've reacted for nine months of pregnancy.  It was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- better that I had three.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, usually --
L:  But ...
R:  -- well, it's not really nine, but [MN] six months when you start getting sick and all that stuff, and ...
L:  Exactly.  And I never got sick and I, um, worked at a gym, um , before I left for Alaska, so I ...
R:  Oh, you were in good shape.
L:  Yeah, I was.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I kept thinking, "I'm gaining weight but I don't think it's muscle".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But it wasn't enough to even think twice about anything, so ...
R:  I'll be darned.  Yeah.
L:  It was -- well, it was an experience.
R:  Yeah, I would say so, yeah.  Hey, I --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I, uh -- we got a -- a thing on the internet, they're called the Coolworks.  I don't know if --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you ever heard of it.  And, we --
L:  No.
R:  Well, anyway, it -- it's -- they -- they have jobs all over the United States and all over the place.  Anyway, they advertised, uh, Princess, uh, Tour Lines --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and Grey Lines.  And we put in for a job last year with the Grey Lines.  I wanted to drive, um, a bus up there in Fairbanks, in one of the places.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Anyway, they waited too long.  It was like, in +February before they called me but by that time we already had a job but they -- they wanted -- uh, wondered if I wanted to go up to Fairbanks and drive the bus for them.  They paid, at that time, nine bucks an hour and then all the stuff come with it, but ...
L:  Huh.
R:  -- it was too late.
L:  Wow.
R:  But we've trying just --
L:  See --
R:  -- keep ahead.
L:  I would -- I would definitely love to travel.  Um, and I'm sure, as my daughter gets a little older, I will travel more.  It's just kinda hard to have her stuck in re- -- all the time in the car.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well. 
L:  And ...
R:  Yeah, your turn will come.
L:  Yeah, definitely.  But ...
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I would -- I would love to go around and see places.
R:  Uh-huh.  Do -- have you called in to this company at all?  They -- they said you could call two or three times.
L:  I haven't.  Uh-uh.
R:  Oh, I thought may- -- well, this -- this is --
L:  I didn't --
R:  -- the first -- [MN] this is our first then, okay.
L:  Well, I se- -- it said, um -- I signed up yesterday and it said that it would be seventy two hours before anything happened.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, so, when I -- I was picking up my daughter from bay- day care when it rang in.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I was like, "Oh my gosh.  Wow.  
R:  Oh.
L:  Okay, I gotta go".  [LAUGH]
R:  I'll be darned.  Yeah, 'cause they -- well they didn't tell me it was seventy two hours.  You know, I just signed in.  I couldn't -- I couldn't get my stupid Visa through that paycheck thing so I went the other way.  But any way --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- uh, and I said, "Well".
L:  Yeah.
R:  I thought it'd probably be two or three months before that happened.
L:  Huh.
R:  But, anyway ...
L:  Yeah, I -- I didn't even [MN] -- I didn't put in a Visa or anything.
R:  Oh.  How did you, oh --
L:  I -- I --
R:  Did you pay by cheque or what?
L:  I went, um, I don't know how they
