R:  Hi, my name's Tiffany.
L:  Hi, Tiffany, my name is Evelyn.
R:  Hi, Evelyn.  Well, um, I guess, uh, this is about Iraq and our problems with Iraq.  Um, I feel that we need to, um, go over to Iraq and, um, no only, um, take all their chemical and nuclear weapons, I feel we should disarm the entire place.  I think every civilian --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- should be armless.
L:  I agree totally.  Um, I feel that there's a lot that needs to be done in the United States and we're over there and spending a lot of our -- our money that we can be using right here in the United States and helping a lot of people.  Um, as far as, uh, disarming, I agree totally because if there are no guns, um, and there is no chemicals over there, then it's a lot less that we have to worry about and hopefully there won't be another war.
R:  Do you feel, um, that these have to, uh -- wars have helped anything?
L:  Do I feel the war has helped anything?  Um, for the Iraqi people, yes, I do, completely.  Um, the leader that they had over there was absolutely, uh, one of the most destructive people, um, mind and body, that I've ever, ever heard of [MN].  Um --
R:  But you don't feel that we should have let them, um, deal with it themselves if they had such a problem?  I mean, now they hate us because we went in there and took him --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- away.  Now they've got --
L:  Um --
R:  -- two people to hate.
L:  Well, I don't feel that they hate all of us.  Uh, I don't feel all of the people hate us.  Just a select few of 'em in the leadership.  Um, because the people themselves, the citizens, they just admire the United States.  In fact, they want to join the army of the United States.
R:  Huh.
L:  Um, uh, I -- I agree that, um, as far as them taking care of themselves, no.  They -- they'd never be able to take care of themselves.
R:  So, do you feel the UN should step in and propose and -- and create some type of government for Iraq?
L:  I believe, uh, that should be done because I don't think that they can do it themselves.  No.
R:  Instead of letting them elect their own people and getting in the same boat --
L:  Um --
R:  -- and getting someone worse than Saddam Hussein?
L:  I think that they'll probably elect their own.  Um, let's just hope that it's not anywhere near the -- the type of people that they had put into, uh, leadership beforehand.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And a lot of them were related, you know, I mean, he had his -- he had two sons in there.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  And, uh, they definitely were not any better than he was.  In fact they -- they really, um -- like, they were hungry for torture.  I mean --
R:  Do you think that we should continue, um, you know, bombing Iraq and -- and -- and trying to find, uh, Saddam Hussein and -- and not stop until we do?
L:  I -- I think he's fled.  I -- just my --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- opinion, I think he's fled.
R:  So, okay, we -- we --
L:  I don't think he's there any more, so ...
R:  Osama and Saddam are just running around and we've created two wars, killed off hundreds of thousands of people, destroyed no telling what and we didn't get the people out of power.  They can go and start up whenever they feel like it, somewhere else.
L:  Um, I don't think that they would because I don't think the people would let 'em.
R:  Huh.
L:  Um, but I -- I do feel that he's fled because if not then I think we would know b- -- you know, by now if he was -- where he -- where he was killed, definitely.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  And, uh, the leadership as well.
R:  So, what do you think that, um, we should do, um, as far as w- we're standing right now with our position?
L:  Uh, just rebuild the government.
R:  So, continue on what they're doing with their rebuilding tactics and, um, continue searching for, um, these weapons that don't exist.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There's a lot [MN] -- there's a lot underground, there's a lot in houses, i- in -- I mean, in the walls of, uh, houses that have been deserted they've found -- oh, god, what did they find inside the house?  Wasn't it like five hundred thousand dollars -- I mean, five hundred -- six hundred and some odd million dollars in the wall of a house there, uh, the leader used?
R:  Wow.
L:  So, yeah.  All in cash.
R:  That's amazing.
L:  Yeah.  It really is.
R:  So, um, do you think that we should continue with our military ef- efforts and, um, continue, um, fighting, um, the rebels and, um, continue what we're doing as far as, um, trying to restore peace?
L:  I think that's exhausted now.
R:  So you think --
L:  No.  I think --
R:  -- we're beyond that?
L:  I think -- yeah, I believe so.
R:  Huh.
L:  I believe it's peace now.  I -- I mean, they're gonna, you know, find some here and there, you know, that are still going to side with, uh, uh, uh, Saddam Hussein but other than that, no.  I think it's just about exhausted, the whole war.
R:  Huh.
L:  Um --
R:  Are you happy with the outcome?
L:  Yes and no.  I mean, it cost a lot of money for the --
R:  See, I'm not happy --
L:  -- United States.
R:  -- at all with it.  I feel we've wasted our time.  We've wasted our money.  We've killed people, um, and I feel that they've --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- tried to brainwash us into believing that we're doing something right.
L:  Really?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  And what do you think about all the women and the way they were tortured over there?
R:  I think that they're going to get somebody else in power over there that's going to do the same thing because they've been letting it happen all these years.  They're not going to stop.  You know, I mean -- I mean, looking at Kuwait, I mean, the women could uncover their faces and they chose to cover them up because they'd been covered for so long.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, um, you know, as soon as Saddam got out of power, they bashed their heads with rocks and, you know, walked around covered in blood.  Saddam Hussein wouldn't allow that, I wonder why, you know.  It's like those people over there are crazy.  They're like savages.
L:  They bashed whose heads in rocks?
R:  They bashed their own heads with rocks and walked around covered in blood, you know.
L:  Oh, my god.  I -- yeah, I didn't know that.
R:  I mean, there was little ten year old boys covered in blood with big gashes in their heads.
L:  Man.
R:  And, you know, they're like, "Oh, Saddam wouldn't allow this".  It's like, "I wonder why?"
L:  I know, they had rape rooms and -- and all kinds of things going on over there.
R:  Yeah, and, you know, but the thing is that they've allowed it for so long, us stepping in or whatever is not going to make it end, I don't believe.
L:  No.  Well, maybe --
R:  I believe that the --
L:  -- you're right.
R:  That the next person that comes in is going to be like, "Yeah, well".  I mean that's like a normal every day thing getting raped and killed.  You know, over there it's like part of life.
L:  I know that if a woman is raped or was raped over there then the brother, uh, was the one that had to kill her.
R:  God.
L:  So that she wouldn't shame the family.
R:  God.
L:  Because they always blamed it on the -- the woman being raped.
R:  Uh.
L:  And they also when they're -- I believe when they're babies, uh, the women are babies, they cut the clitorises --
R:  Ugh.
L:  -- so that they won't grow up enjoying, uh, pleasure from sex.
R:  Uh.
L:  So that -- so that they, you know, won't, um, uh, go find love elsewhere other than your, uh, partner.
R:  So, are we, um -- are they still practicing that now that, uh --
L:  Um --
R:  -- Saddam's out of power?
L:  -- I hope not.  I hope not.  I hope that that's -- you know, that stopped that.  I'm hoping [MN].
R:  So, do you think then that basically, um, that we should continue with our efforts now trying just to rebuild Iraq and not concentrate so heavily then on the arms issue?  Do you feel --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- that we pretty much have found everything and they really didn't have as much as we thought they did?
L:  That's what I hope.  That's what I think.  Yes.
R:  You don't think Saddam's hiding out somewhere with his thirty two --
L:  Um,
R:  bombs --
L:  I -- I --
R:  -- ready to aim 'em at us?
L:  I don't know.  I really don't know.  I don't know if he's fled the country or if he's still -- if he's, you know, hiding underground somewhere and, um --
R:  I think when we least --
L:  -- with all the weapons.
R:  -- expect it we're in trouble.
L:  Really?
R:  [MN]
L:  And then you think they're going to come out from hiding and ...?
R:  Yeah.  He's probably got a secret little army hidden somewhere, you know, wherever he's --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- at they're just protecting him.  That's what they need to concentrate on finding, I think.  I think they shouldn't stop until they find Saddam Hussein because once he's dead and gone and they see his body then they will finally feel that something has been accomplished.
L:  Well, see that's the thing.  I think they should find the body.  I mean, as you say, you know, they haven't found it and they should keep going.  However, I mean, they're pretty sure that they got him.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  But there'd be some remains.
L:  There should be something for DNA testing.
R:  I mean, look at Osama.  We did all that with Afghanistan and Osama is still running around.  We don't even -- you never even hear --
L:  I know.
R:  -- about him any more.  What if that's going to happen with Saddam Hussein too?
L:  I know.
R:  You know, we're just going to forget about him and destroy our country and --
L:  There should be something found somewhere from that building that they bombed and they're pretty sure they got, uh, him and, um, his sons and, um, you know, they should find something from one of 'em.
R:  I mean, there's no proof that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- we even basically went over there to go get somebody and we never even got that person and -- and we destroyed everything and now what?
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  They were not the objective.
L:  Not to mention how much, you know, it cost.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Cost the United States, uh, billions.
R:  [NOISE] And they're deploying more troops over all the time.  I mean, it's costing us money still every day.
L:  Mhm.  And where I live here -- I live in Tampa, Florida --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:   -- and right near the air force base and, I mean, I -- I see yellow ribbons everywhere.
R:  What are the yellow ribbons for?
L:  Uh, for the family members, you know, the husbands, the sons.
R:  Oh, god.  Really?
L:  Oh, y- -- oh, yes.  One of, um -- one of the high schools down here in fact they had a big funeral service for 'em, all the students, because it was, uh, one of the honor students.
