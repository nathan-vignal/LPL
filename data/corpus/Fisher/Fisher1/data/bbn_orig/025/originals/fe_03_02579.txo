L:  I'm Cara.
R:  Hi.
L:  [MN]
R:  I'm Paula.
L:  Hi, nice to meet you.
R:  Leah?
L:  I'm Cara.
R:  Okay.  I'm sorry.  Uh, did you understand what our topic was to be about today?
L:  Yeah.  I think they asked, uh, what we think about what's going on in Iraq and what -- what we think should be done or how involved we think the US should be.
R:  The only thing I got was something about arms maybe and --
L:  Oh, really.
R:  -- and so I really wasn't sure on the -- on the total topic but anyway Iraq is a good subject right now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How do you feel about the war?
L:  Oh, dear.  I don't know, it seems really abstract to me because I don't see any of it going on so it's kind of hard -- hard to formulate an opinion about it.  What do you think?
R:  You mean because you're in the US?
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, I don't see the sh- -- soldiers.  I don't see --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the whole issue.  So --
R:  I'm in Oklahoma.  Where are you?
L:  I'm in Massachussetts.
R:  Okay. [COUGH] Well, I know when ninety -- nine one one happened --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- uh, it made me more aware of how people in other countries live on a day to day basis.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, like in -- in Israel where they have bombings, uh, it's an every day occurrence --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I thought, "Golly.  How do those people live like that every day?"
L:  Right.
R:  But I don't know that, um -- it -- it really opened a lot of eyes I think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We -- we're so fortunate in our country.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We've always been blessed to live in peace and freedom and -- but I don't know on the arms.  Do you think they will find, uh -- what are your feelings on their finding any weapons of -- of --
L:  Well, I'm not really sure but I can't help but wonder why, um -- why we're so opposed to killing here but, um, as -- as I've been hearing on the news, um, what's going on in Iraq is murder of innocent civilians also so it seems like they pick and choose and decide what -- what we should, you know, protect, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, it's more the president that we're supposed to support than what we believe our country stands for --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- sometimes, you know.
R:  Do you think we should not have went to war at all?
L:  Um, you see, that's -- because that's what they said before which is -- it's hard for me to know because I really don't -- I'm not, you know, involved in the real stuff of what's going on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so it's kinda like my opinion isn't based on anything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- substantial, you know.
R:  Well, you can look at both sides of the issue and see pros and cons --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, on both sides, when you listen to -- to all the details on the news reports.
L:  Right.
R:  And of course no one ever likes to see innocent people hurt.  I mean, that goes against everything that anybody stands for, I think that --
L:  Yes.
R:  Any -- anybody that's decent.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But no one wants that but that's the sad thing about in -- in war not only are innocent people hurt and killed but our own people are also hurt and killed so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's a sacrifice we have to pay --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for -- for freedom.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It -- it's hard.
L:  It seems so barbaric to go in though and be violent when our whole point is to not be violent.  You know, our -- the whole problem is that we think the issue of our being violent, I mean, it -- attacking people in the same way that you feel they're attacking -- attacking you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just elicits more violence from those people, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It would be nice if we could live in a world where everyone was at peace --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and got along and loved each other but, you know what, it's -- it's -- it's -- this is the real world --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that we're in.  It's not a -- it's not heaven.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I think we're always going to have that.  I mean, that's just part of life.  We have to accept that bad things are going to happen and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we have to do the best we can do with it.
L:  I guess it's also sort of shaded over by, um, other motives for the administration to go in besides finding weapons like the oil --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and it makes you wonder because his father also, uh, invaded Iraq, um, back in the early nineties so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it sort of makes the connection in your mind about ulterior motives.
R:  Well, you may have those thoughts and -- and I don't know that's -- I had thoughts about whether we should even go into it or not at the beginning --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but the way it's been handled, I have great respect for the way they took so much care in trying to avoid hitting -- you know, when they were just bombing where they thought the -- the main, uh, part of his army was --
L:  Right.  I mean --
R:  -- and tried to avoid the civilian population.
L:  Yes.
R:  And they could do that and that was amazing and I really admired that.
L:  Yeah.  I mean --
R:  So --
L:  -- they could definitely be more violent than they are which is -- which is good that they're not --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- being violent.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I try to look at the good that's going to come out of it.  It -- the people over there now seem to be -- the majority of them seem to be happy and ready for a change and peace --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so we have to focus on that, I think, you know, what -- what they want.
L:  That's true.  See, I mean, it's not that -- it's not as though we're really going to change what -- what the administration has decided so you might as well be optimistic about it.
R:  Mhm.  We might as well.  And I think good will come out of it.
L:  Mm.
R:  Just pray and give it to God and he will take care of it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, [SIGH] I don't know.  Uh, I just hope those people have a better life than they've had.  It seems like they have been so downtrodden and -- and with little hope and little chance and I know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- their own people have come over here to learn and now maybe they will take that back and, you know, like the doctors here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I've seen so many of them that are here.
L:  Mm.
R:  And maybe they will go back now and -- and help build their land and --
L:  Mm.
R:  I don't know. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just want the country to -- to be a happy free country.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- would like for us all to live in peace.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Do you think that might ever happen? [SIGH]
L:  Um, I don't know.  It seems like throughout history we've never really had --
R:  Never --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- really, have we?
L:  Right.  Even if there's a time of peace, it's like a cycle.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and war inevitably comes.  It's like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- human nature, you know.
R:  You know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I thought after our last major war that we would never again see --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a war --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because of the nuclear possiblity.
L:  Right.
R:  And I thought, "Well, there will never be another war again".
L:  Right.  Because as soon as you bring up conflict like that there's -- you always run the risk.
R:  Mhm.  So, now we have to worry about, um, North Korea --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And what they --
L:  Right.
R:  -- might do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with their weapons and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know, but, anyway, well [SIGH] you bring up something now.
L:  [MN] Um --
R:  Thi -- this is fun --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for me.  What about you?
L:  Yeah, this is the second time I've called so --
R:  Mine too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's my second one.  This one's a little bit harder.
L:  Yeah.  Yesterday's was about, um, what was it?  Reality T- TV so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Um --
R:  Which -- but, uh, I don't know, this -- this seems to touch the hearts of people deeper.
L:  Right.
R:  So, [COUGH] did you watch any of President Bush last night on TV?
L:  No, I didn't.  My parents did but I -- I didn't.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Did you watch it?
R:  I watched parts of it and I thought it was really -- well, I thought he presented himself well.
L:  What did he out- -- what was his main point?
R:  Just the parts that got, uh, just about the war and about the freedom for the Iraqi people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And where we're going from here hopefully and --
L:  Right.
R:  That's what we all want is peace.  You know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I think everyone has to want that.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So ... but -- well, what do you do in your --
L:  Um, I'm actually a student.
R:  That's what I thought.  That --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you probably were.  So, you're not in school right now?
L:  I -- I -- yeah, I am at school right now.
R:  Oh, are you?
L:  Yeah.  I'm in college though, so ...
R:  Uh-huh.  I mean at this moment.
L:  Yeah, I'm in my dorm room.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.  Okay.  Well ...
L:  So, you live in Oklahoma, you said?
R:  I'm in Oklahoma, uh-huh.  I grew up in Texas but my granddaughters are in Oklahoma.
L:  Ah.
R:  So I moved here a few years ago to be closer to them.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  Yeah.  It's nice.  But they're growing up.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And --
L:  Well, at least you're there to see it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's true.  But what's your weather like there right now?
L:  Right now it's pouring rain actually.
R:  Really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Bummer.
L:  Is it sunny down there?
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's nice.
R:  And it's gorgeous, beautiful, perfect.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Couldn't ask for it to be b- -- any better. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I like sun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm a sunshine person.
L:  That's nice.
R:  And it's shining really bright today and very pretty.
L:  Yeah.  It was earlier but ...
R:  Yeah.  In fact I'm looking out on my balcony right now and -- I'm upstairs in a condo.
L:  Mm.
R:  And the big trees overhang my balcony and it -- it -- it's like I'm in a tree house.
L:  Huh.
R:  And I have flowers out on my balcony and the birds are coming to my bird feeder.  It's just really pretty and peaceful and calm.
L:  Yeah.  It sounds nice.
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  Is it usually warm down there?  Does it --
R:  Uh, pretty much.
L:  Mm.
R:  Our summers are kinda miserable.
L:  Mm.  Really hot.
R:  Very -- very hot and in Oklahoma very humid.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And in West Texas where I'm from it was dry.
L:  Oh, yeah.  That can make all the difference.
R:  Uh-huh.  You could keep a hairstyle.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] In Oklahoma, forget it.
L:  Right.
R:  Just forget it.  It melts.  So, well, we're not talking about Iraq.
L:  Yes, that's true. [LAUGH]
R:  So --
