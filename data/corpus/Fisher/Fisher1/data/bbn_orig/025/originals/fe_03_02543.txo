R:  Hi.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  [NOISE] Hello. [NOISE]
R:  Hi.  My name is Betsy.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, hi.
R:  I'm sorry?  What's your name?
L:  [NOISE] Ah, this is Joshua.
R:  Hi, Joshua.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Do you wanna go first, or do you want me to go first?
L:  [NOISE] Ah -- [NOISE] ah, you can go first.
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, do you watch any of the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- reality shows?
L:  Um, I don't really, no. [NOISE]
R:  I don't really either.  I don't have that much time.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  In the past I have occasionally --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.  
R:  -- had them on in the 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- background, like ah, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- oh gosh, I guess --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, Geraldo something.  But, they're a little frightening. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know why they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so popular.
L:  They, ah [NOISE] -- I don't know.
R:  It's a lit- -- it's a little --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- scary.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You have, like, um, these really th- -- they bring out --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the most --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- bizarre --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people.  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the most bizarre problems.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And -- like, my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- husband's brother is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sleeping with my cousin's sister, and I don't like it.  And then people just get crazy and then they're fighting with each other, and it's really scary. [NOISE] 
L:  Whoa. [NOISE]  I don't -- I don't really watch it much 'cause I don't -- ah, I don't really -- my TV doesn't really work, [NOISE] so -- I don't really have time to watch TV, so --
R:  Ah, I don't have time to watch TV either.  This is, like, a couple of years ago.  Ah, I --.
L:  [NOISE] Oh yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I mostly --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- work.  But, um, those --
L:  Oh yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  They're a little scary.  Why do you think they're popular?  Why do you think people li- -- do you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- know anyone that watches 'em?
L:  Yeah.  I guess it's just, ah, 'cause it's -- like, reality is, um, what, ah, people like to see.  I don't know. [SIGH]
R:  I don't know.  
L:  Hm.
R:  Part of me thinks that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for some people they watch it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause it makes them feel better.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like, let's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- say they have whatever problems -- I don't know -- let's say they're --
L:  Yeah.  That they don't have problems that are as bad.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  It's, like "Oh gee --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- I only have, you know, cancer". [LAUGH]  But --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  See, I'm in good shape.  My husband's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, you know -- my husband's brother's sister isn't sleeping with my Grandma's father's wife, you know. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  That's like those talk shows.
R:  Yeah.  No, it's always something weird, but -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I think maybe they -- they put on these weird situations and -- and people -- I don't know -- it's almost like a -- I've -- I've never been a soap opera watcher, but I think maybe that's the reason that some people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like op- -- soap operas.  It's the same thing.  It's -- it's, you know, these fantasies, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's, like, the opposite.  But, it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's, like, the opposite.  Where --
L:  They wanna be like that.
R:  -- a soap opera's a fantasy where somebody wants -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to be like it.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  But, the reality show --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- almost the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- opposite, where you're, like, "Oh boy, you know, my life ain't so bad".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "It's, ah --"
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Because they're not, ah -- things are not so tough.
L:  Yeah.  Think so.  I agree with them.
R:  I don't know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, then --
L:  So --
R:  -- like, would -- would something like, ah, Oprah be considered a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- reality show?  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Or, are they only talking about, like --
L:  Um, I don't know.  I think that's more, like, legitimate maybe.  More like, it's a talk show, like not so trashy maybe.
R:  Yeah.  I don't think that's -- I don't know.  I can't even -- I'm trying to think of the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- different --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But then, what about -- would, like, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- those -- there's all those, like, court shows --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on, like, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Actually I didn't even --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- speaking it now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I didn't even get to watch it.  There was a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, Sixty Minutes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- too, which --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I guess is on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Wednesday nights, which --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, once again --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I never get --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to watch either.  I saw that it was gonna be on and then, um, I had --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to watch some --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- baseball --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I had to go to work, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but, they had that, um, Judge Judy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was supposed to be there -- Sheindlin -- who -- ah, she has another one, where [NOISE] she does a -- a reality, like, court show, where she's a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like the, ah -- ah -- ah, not a fake judge, but I guess they have a -- you know, people, um, go there to resolve whatever kind of -- same thing, like, weird problems.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Like -- and, um --
L:  Yeah.  I think --
R:  Don't -- no -- no -- say.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I think that's part of, like -- 'cause that's -- there -- there have been so many more, you know, court shows.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, with the reality shows, it's probably the same thing -- on the same kind of line --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as that.
R:  I mean, I don't even know.  I know there's -- I know there's several, um, [NOISE] with, um -- like, once or twice I've caught them, like, late at night when I actually do look at TV for, like, five minutes.  But, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's the same thing.  They have, like, really weird --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- really weird, um, cases.  What did they have?  It would've --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- been a couple a months where it was s- somebody had, um -- [LIPSMACK] like, a -- a stepfather --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- had bought a horse or somet- -- ah -- ah -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I -- and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then, they went --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- into bankruptcy, and then they tried to claim the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- horse from the little -- his --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- son.  And then the ex wife was, like "You can't do this.  This isn't right.  It's not --"
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  "-- part of the --" -- and they 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- were having this whole thing on the -- on the -- the, um -- [LIPSMACK] on the show.  And then there was another one.  It must've been the same show --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause I never --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- get to watch --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- this -- where it was somebody was -- this was even more bizarre.  They had a, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Somebody's father, I guess, had a -- a drug and alcohol problem.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And the son, like, let him borrow some money.  And then he took it and, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- spent it all --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on drugs.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And he -- no!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He spent it all -- he bought, like, all this marijuana.  He bought all this pot.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  And then he was gonna sell it.  And then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And then he -- and then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the judge was, like, "Do you realise what you're saying in court?"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "Like, you could be hauled in right now. Like, that's illegal".  And the guy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- was, like, "Ah".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And she's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- like, "Are you --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- drunk now?" and he's --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --like, "Yes, Judge, I am".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  This is, like, a shitty show.
L:  Oh, my God. [NOISE]
R:  This is, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the one --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, um --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I don't think real courts [NOISE] work like that. [LAUGH] 
R:  No.  But, it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, I guess it's interesting.  You just think, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "Holy cow, wow". That's like --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- that, like, that poor guy, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- lent his --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- father the money and then his father, like did this --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- whole scam --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where he trying to, like -- I guess he was bagging it and was planning on, like, selling it.  And to -- to -- to get more money to, like, buy alcohol or whatever his --
L:  Oh my --
R:  -- his thing was.
L:  -- gosh.
R:  It was, like, this bizarre thing.  And then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]
L:  [MN]
R:  -- neither one of them.  And then how he -- I don't even -- this was a couple of months ago.  This was the only one that -- that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I've seen --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in recent time.  But, ah, [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I --
L:  Hm.  Well --
R:  I -- I don't know.  But, obviously they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they keep --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- coming on because I remember --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- years ago it was just that Judge Judy.  And then there's all these --
L:  Yeah, now --
R:  -- different ones.
L:  -- there's tonnes.  There's, like, Judge Joe Brown [NOISE], and -- I don't even know.
R:  Judge Joe Brown?  That's a good -- there's one -- there's another one.
L:  Yeah.  Um, [LIPSMACK] yeah.  But, other than that -- else -- but yeah, I think it'll probably -- like, it can't go on.  Like, it'll probably stop sometime. [NOISE]
R:  Well, it's like -- yeah, 'cause you think, like, you have that Survivor.  Now, I never --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I never really -- I saw, like, one or two.  My sister was all into it.  She just, like -- 
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  I'm, like, "How do you have time to be wat-" -- I don't even know what night it was on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I don't --
L:  I don't know.
R:  I don't have time.  And, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, people -- people get into it.  I don't know whether it just [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I almost think it --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- just takes you out of your real --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- life, and you can focus on --
L:  [NOISE] You can see how other people act in real -- in reality situations.  And maybe you compare --
R:  Yeah, but are --
L:  -- to --
R:  -- those really --
L:  -- you self.
R:  -- reality situations though?
L:  Yeah.  They're probably not -- probably influenced by the camera, of course.  But --
R:  I don't know.  Because then I think too, like, that Survivor show --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, everyone on that island --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- they're all -- like, they had nothing to eat but, like, bugs or -- I mean, whatever. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] I guess they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- had, like, ten different ones.  But, they had --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, bugs and raw fish and all this really nasty stuff.  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- everyone still looked really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- good.  I'm, like -- I don't know.
L:  Oh.
R:  I mean, I -- I think I look pretty good, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think after that much time, like, I don't think I'd be looking so good.  Like --
L:  So, you think they put, like, make up on them and stuff? 
R:  I don't know.  I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they don't pick -- in, like, that case -- that show, like it -- like a Geraldo or something -- oh, it's real people all right.  They're real scary people, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  Then you think, like, that Survivor.  Like, does everyone really look that -- you know, would everyone really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you or me, or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, somebody else really look that good after that many weeks just eating some bugs and no --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- having no soap to even wash.  And, like, you can't wash your hair.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And is this, like --
L:  Yeah, I don't think so, and fair enough.
R:  [LAUGH] But, um --
L:  See, that's kind of unrealistic. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I know, but they did.  They still looked, like, really pretty good.  So, I don't know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that they have the average person.  And -- and either --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- way, they're not the average person.  It's either somebody that's --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  They're usually good looking people or --
R:  Right.
L:   -- something like that.
R:  But then, on the Geraldo end it's, you know, somebody that's, like -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- has like a really sad life and -- 
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- and, you know, not necessarily more attractive or less attractive, but just, you know, people in really, like, sad situations.  Whether they chose it sometimes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or whether --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, they -- I don't know -- whether they just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, you just have bad situations.
L:  Yeah.
