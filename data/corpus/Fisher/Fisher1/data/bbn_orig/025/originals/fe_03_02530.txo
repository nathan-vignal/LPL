R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  My name's Catherine[?].  How are you?
R:  Good.  And you?
L:  Hi.  Fine.  What's your name?
R:  Desiree[?].
L:  Desiree, hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Were you watching the President just now?
R:  Oh, no.  I completely forgot about that. [SIGH]  I was watching Jenny -- Jamie Kennedy Experiment.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  Which is I guess kind of reality show, right?
L:  Yeah, really. [LAUGH] 
R:  Kind of. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Do you watch any of the reality, ah, shows on TV?
R:  [LIPSMACK] A few of them.  I do enjoy American Idol, and I watched a couple of The Bachelors, [LIPSMACK] but that's about it right now.
L:  I've never seen any of them.  I was hoping that you could tell me about them.
R:  Okay.  Um, American Idol is my favorite.  [LIPSMACK] I even went to their concert last year.  But, ah, what it is -- I mean, I'm sure you heard about it.  Have you, or no?
L:  Um, I -- I've heard about it.
R:  Okay
L:  I think -- here's all I know.  It's, like, a whole bunch of people are contestants, and then there's some very critical people and some nice people that say you win or lose.  But that's all I know.
R:  Basically, yes.  They compete every week by singing a song and America votes.
L:  And --
R:  And whoever gets the most votes continue on to the next week.
L:  Is -- so is it just singing?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  So, like, if you're a comedian or if you dance or something like that, forget it.
R:  Right.
L:  That doesn't count?  Okay.
R:  Right.  Star Search would be more your thing. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.
R:  And that came back on.  Star Search is back.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh my God.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And then, like, shows like The Bachelor, you know, that's find your love, and -- I don't think ever works, but [NOISE] --
L:  I just don't understand why so many of these reality based shows are so popular right now.  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like, maybe because they're cheap for the TV show people to put, ah, at -- in terms of production costs.  I don't know. [LAUGH] 
R:  That could be.  I never even thought of it that way. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think, um, [NOISE] because -- in my case, I enjoy it because it's real people.  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's not, you know, people who grew up in acting school, and, you know, whose mommy and daddy are famous.  It's just your everyday regular Joe.  So, I think that's why I enjoy it.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  And do like to, like, root for someone on American Idol, like, that you like and think, "You know, I really hope that he or she will win"?
R:  Yes, definitely. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, cool.  Who --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is -- is that show in right now -- that I could watch it, ah, or has it ended?
R:  No, it's only on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
L:  But, I mean, it's still on TV -- the series?
R:  Oh, yes -- yes.  I'm sorry.
L:  Oh -- and who do you like?
R:  I like -- ah, my favorite is a girl by the name of Kimberly Lock. [NOISE] 
L:  And what --
R:  She's one --
L:  -- kind of --
R:  -- the contestants. [NOISE] 
L:  Do they make you sing, um, their song, or do you get to sing whatever you want?
R:  Well, they have a theme.  Like, ah, this week one of the topics was sixties.  They had to pick any song from the sixties and sing it.  So, they give you a theme and then you can pick whatever.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And could you go and say, "I wanna sing something, like, opera", or would they just laugh you out of there?
R:  They'd probably laugh you out of there --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- 'cause they're looking for a pop star.
L:  Oh, okay.  Ah, I get it.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  And I also watched Joe Millionaire, and I liked that a lot.
L:  [MN]
R:  That's pretty interesting.
L:  Did -- was he, like, um, nice?  I mean, some of the previews I saw for it, I couldn't tell if he was kind of lifeless, or if he was just, you know, a sweet guy.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I didn't -- I didn't get a sense of what kind of guy he was.
R:  [SIGH] How can I explain it?  In my -- what I think he was -- was, ah -- he didn't seem too intelligent. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  I didn't wanna say it and wanna, like --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- skew your answer, but he seemed as dumb as a box of lint.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.
R:  I agree. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] That's -- it's so mean of me to say that.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But maybe he has a heart of gold.  I don't know. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  So, tell me more about him.
R:  Um, [NOISE] ah, it's been so long since I've watched an episode.  But, ah, he just [NOISE] was your whatever -- you know, easy going -- what ever happens happens --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- type of guy.  Didn't seem intelligent at all.  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it seems like once the show ended he, ah, got a lot of publicity.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He's done a lot of TV shows, and this and that, and -- but, the girl that he picked, which was actually from a nearby town from where I am, [NOISE] they didn't last.
L:  Where -- where are --
R:  It ended.
L:  -- you from?
R:  I'm from New Jersey.
L:  Oh God.  I've never been there.  I've heard that, you know, people --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- tease it, but it's called the garden state and it's supposed to be really pretty.
R:  I think so.  I mean, in parts.  We don't have mountains really, so it's not pretty that way.  But the -- our shores are awesome.
L:  Oh, I -- I had no idea that you didn't have mountains.
R:  No. [LIPSMACK]  I think --
L:  I --
R:  -- a little bit, but not really.
L:  See, I didn't know that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I had no idea.  I -- I grew up in Florida, and it's all so flat -- flat -- flat -- flat -- flat.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, yeah.
R: [LAUGH]
L:  But, in Joe Millionaire's show, um, when he -- you know, all the women initially were competing for him --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, was it obvious that the women were, um, you know, "Hey, I'm just in this for the money and, you know, to heck with the guy.  I could care less"?  Or did some of the -- the women like him, at all?
R:  I think a couple of -- a few may have liked him, +especially one, the one he wound up picking. [NOISE]  But the others -- 
L:  Oh, that's sweet.
R:  Most of them I do believe was just in it for the money, [NOISE] --
L:  Gold diggers.
R:  -- thinking he was rich.  And then at the end, he w- -- turned out not to be rich.  But, they gave the couple a million dollars anyway to split between the two, [NOISE] 
L:  Ooh!
R:  So, it was a little twist at the end.
L:  Ooh!
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  Got it!  Oh, I didn't -- I didn't realise that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, I see.  Ahah -- aha- -- that's mean.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, some of them were nice.  Like, I've never seen Survivor.  I've never seen Big Brother, or any of them, so I don't know what they're about.  But, I watch the, ah, love ones [LAUGH] and American Idol.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, sure.  I -- and it -- you know, it's just kind of fun, I guess, to see, you know, how other real people live instead of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, I don't know how old you are, but do you remember Dynasty?
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, just -- that was just so ridiculous.  
R:  Right.
L:  You know, so over the top.  You know, like -- like, you know, people are gonna walk around million dollar homes and [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- designer clothes all day long. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's what's good about reality.  It's just whatever.  Everything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- goes and they're natural, normal people.
L:  Yeah.  Um, did you watch any of the Extreme Makeover TV shows?
R:  Ah, yes -- yes.  I did --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- watch that too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Watched it last night.  And, um, I was actually tempted to, um, apply for it --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- which is absolutely crazy.  But I didn't, 'cause I have a phone and I couldn't be sexy[?] without 'em. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, have you watched those, or no?
L:  I watched that last night.
R:  Yep.
L:  Sure did.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yep.  And I just thought how much it would hurt to go through, um, surgery.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And how brave those people were.  And I -- I couldn't tell if they said, um, you know, "Oh, I'd do it again.  You know, the suffering was worth it".  I wasn't sure if they just said that because they were so grateful to have received all those services for free, or if they really meant it.  Because, it looked like the s- -- the recuperation was awful.
R:  It did, didn't it?
L:  Oh God.  I don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- think I'd wanna do that.
R:  Yeah.  That's the only -- that's another thing that turned me off [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah. I mean --
R:   -- the whole --
L:  I -- I had a nose job when I was in my early twenties.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Most of it was cosmetic.  You know, I wanted a nice nose.  But, the other part was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I was told that I could breathe more easily and that my allergies would be, um, less awful.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And th- that's true.  But, um, hey, it hurts like hell.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  And for a year afterwards, if anyone pushed my nose --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- up towards my, um -- like, in towards my eyes -- like, if I got bumped when I was kissing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- my boyfriend, it still hurt.
R:  Ooh.
L:  It still hurt.  So painful -- oh by God -- hurt.
R:  Ooh.
L:  I'll never go back for anything.  Plastic surgery?  Forget it.  That's it, I'm done.  I don't care if I look like an old hag. --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ever.  I'm never, ever, ever going back.  It hurts so much.
R:  Oh, wow.  
L:  So --
R:  I didn't realise that.
L:  So, when they're saying, "Oh, yeah.  I'd do it again", I'm thinking, "You liar".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It hurt.
R:  Like you said, it must be the free services and everything they received in it.  Or they got paid to say it. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Remember the guy, um, like, when he's getting his dentistry free teeth whitening?  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And he -- he says -- um, Doctor Dorphin[?] says, you know, "What did you think?  Did you like it?" and he goes, "Well, yeah, it's pretty good".  I'm thinking, "You're getting this for free, and that's as enthusiastic as you can get?"
R:  Right.
L:  Did you think he was not being very grateful?
R:  I did -- I did.  And he seemed -- he didn't seem too happy, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  It -- it's hard to explain, but I know what you mean.
L:  I just thought they should've said to him privately, "Okay, when the camera's on be more bubbly, be more --"
R:  Mm.
L:  "-- enthusiastic, and be more grateful".
R:  Right.  I don't know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- what he was thinking. [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  No idea.
L:  [LAUGH] And didn't you think the woman should've gotten more -- more of the nose taken off?
R:  Um, at the end, honestly the only thing I could see was her eye makeup.  I thought it looked horrible. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  That was too much.  That was --
R:  That's all I was --
L:  -- so over the top.
R:  -- focusing on, honestly.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] I just --
L:  Yeah.  I --
R:  -- couldn't get over that.  That -- it didn't look good at all.
L:  No, it didn't.
R:  She looked older.
L:  Yeah.  It made her look older, and it -- um, I mean, she didn't look like a prostitute, but it was just, like, "Oh please, come on.  Nobody in real life looks like that".
R:  Mhm.  My --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- boyfriend said that she --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- did look like a prostitute with [LAUGH] -- he just said that. 
L:  Oh, thank you -- thank you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, thank you.  Yeah, it just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I thought they'd give her a fabulous hairstyle, and instead -- okay you --
