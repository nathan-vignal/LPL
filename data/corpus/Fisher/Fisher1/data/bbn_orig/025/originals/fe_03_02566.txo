L:  Oh, hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, yeah.  Hi, my name's, uh, Ken, Kenny. [MN]
R:  Yes.  My name's Danny.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, what -- what are you supposed to do?  We're just supposed to talk, right, about that?
R:  I -- I believe so.
L:  I -- this is the first one of these that I'm doing so I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- have the least amount of, uh, knowing what we're supposed to do.  Just talk about the subject, right?
R:  Yeah.  I think so because that's -- it's my first one as well.
L:  Oh, it's your first also.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  I think this is pretty new to ev- -- a lot of people.
L:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um, all right.
R:  But what was the subject?
L:  Oh, well, what -- what one should do about Iraq and, uh, first she had mentioned that it had something to do with the arms inspection but I guess -- I guess in general, Iraq in general.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes, it had --
L:  So, that's certainly a -- a subject of interest to me.  I -- I follow the -- I follow, uh, all kinds of things about the world very, uh, -- very closely actually.  I'm quite --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I'm quite upset about what's going on so I, um, really followed it.  I don't feel there's much I can do myself but, uh --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  I thought -- I think the little person is really not consulted really very much about these things [LAUGH] except for the --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- peop- -- what?  Yeah.  Go on.
R:  No.  I -- hello.  Oh, no, no.  I was just listening to you.
L:  Yeah.  No.  I just -- I just don't think the little person this far is consulted [MN].  We lack, uh, any kind of, uh, influence, I think.  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah [MN].  So -- so, you -- you think the, um -- uh, it was -- it was a good thing or it was -- so, do you think it was a bad thing, the war?
L:  Oh, I think the war is definitely a bad thing 'cause they didn't tell you the real reason, uh, for the war.
R:  Right.
L:  I just don't think that we're being told what's really going on although -- although people have a pretty good indication of what's going on.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, but they're not really being told that.  Th- they're being told, "Oh, it's only to, uh, you know, to get rid of this, uh, bad guy and to make sure he doesn't have any, uh, weapons or for this and that" uh, which I -- you know, those things might have happened in the course of what they wanted to do which I believe was just they wanted to control.  They just wanted to take control of that area of the world.
R:  Right.
L:  Which, uh, yeah.
R:  Right.  There's --
L:  I think that was -- yeah.  Go on.
R:  Yeah.  It -- I believe it had a lot to do with, um -- with power.  Uh, you know, power money.
L:  Mhm.
R:  There's a lot of, you know, who -- who wants to own the oil, the rights to the oil and, uh --
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  -- that type of thing.
L:  That's right.  Yeah.  I'm afraid that's really what it is and, uh, whether it produces some good things along the way that might have happened but, uh, although -- although the jury's out on that yet also, we don't know yet.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They -- they certainly don't have democracy there yet.  We'll see what happens.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  No.  I -- I, uh -- it seems like -- it seems like it was some sort of a war game [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You know, uh, um, you know, for the wealthy people.  For the wealthy, they're just playing a little game there.
L:  Isn't that -- isn't that true.  Yeah.  And they use the people who -- you know the people who sign up for our armed service, our people who, uh, you know, they're mainly the poor people and who --
R:  Right.
L:  -- couldn't get a- another job and they figured, oh, that maybe they'd get an education this way but of course their main idea is to kill people.  That's what -- and now --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they have to do that and -- and be killed of course.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And, uh, it's -- it's such a tragedy.  It's just -- it's just horrible and --
R:  It is.
L:  Yeah.  And it --
R:  How do you feel, um -- so, y- you -- how did you feel about, um -- or how do you feel about what our -- how our president stands -- how he handled the situation?
L:  Well, I mean, I think that he's -- I mean, he is just -- I think that it's the people he brings with him that they're really in control.  I mean, he's -- he's doing what the very large corporations want him to do [COUGH] --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- which is expand power, you know, of course the oil.  Obviously we know about the oil but there's Bechtel.  They're in -- they're in it for a lot of money too.
R:  Right.
L:  The construction, the reconstruction.  They're all making a lot of money from it.  Of course, the people who gave all the weapons, uh, military industrial complex, which President Eisenhower already warned us about that, they're totally --
R:  But it --
L:  -- in control now.  Yeah.
R:  That's true.  Okay.  Yeah.  I -- I didn't quite look at it that way but, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think these -- these big corporations are really, uh -- I mean, I hear the most amazing quotes from -- from people as far back as President Lincoln already --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- was warning -- did you know that Lincoln warned against the corporations.  He said, "The corporations are going to be the downfall of the United States".
R:  Right.
L:  Because they started to get a lot of power during the Civil War period and he warned about that already.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] Yeah.  Hm.
R:  [LAUGH] So, there -- there was a lot of insight to that way -- from way back. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  So, you know, I don't know.  We're seeing, uh, some -- I'm -- I'm very troubled by today.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know what's -- what's going to happen.
R:  Oh, okay.  So, you feel like, um, the president really is not the influential -- like, everybody -- you know, you hear a lot of, uh, comments regarding the president, uh, but you -- you believe that he's more like a puppet on a string to the corporations?
L:  Yeah.  Oh, definitely.  And all -- all the people with him.  I mean, they're all --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just so happened.  It's kind of an unfortunate thing.  But they've all take control now.  They're all, um -- they're all there.  They're all -- the whole government practically, including Congress, where they're all -- Congress agrees with them.  And -- and I'm afraid even the democrats sort of agree with the republicans.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] Yeah.  It's very bad because they don't, you know [LAUGH] -- I mean, I [SIGH] -- I live in New York City and we're -- we're a number one terrorist target here and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- he -- he's increasing the amount of, uh, people who might wanna do something against the US, you know.  All right, he's saying that he's -- huh, the [MN] -- he's not really -- he wasn't able to -- to really find, um, any of the people who really might, uh, be -- be a head of some of these terrorist groups.  He wasn't able to do that and he's going after -- I -- in my opinion Iraq had nothing to do with anything.  I mean, the guy was not a nice guy, Saddam Hussein, but he had nothing whatsoever to do with any of these terrorist people.
R:  Oh, no.  No.
L:  And -- and now they haven't found any of those weapons of, uh, this and that mass destruction.  They haven't found that.
R:  Right.
L:  And I don't trust 'em now if they come up with something.  I have a feeling --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they're going to plant them now at this point.
R:  So, who do you think -- who do you think is, uh, involved with the terrorists?  What do you -- [MN]
L:  Well, I think they were a bunch of, uh, you know, gangs of, uh -- having nothing to do with a government -- if anything they had to do with Saudi Arabia.  I don't know, but I mean, they were gangs who were, you know, just did that.
R:  Right.
L:  But we know there were something like fifty people involved, nineteen of who were on those planes, you know, and I mean, they're -- they're trying to come up with -- they're just full of revenge and, all right, I understand they feel terrible that this thing happened, um, but they're just going after targets like Afghanistan, these targets that are like, you know, just an excuse, like, you know, to take control.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, take away our liberties too, by the way, here at home.  I think they -- they want a permanent war footing because if they have permanent war that means the, uh, people may go out of money in the defence, uh, department.  That's what they want.  They -- they use that as an excuse.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's too bad.
R:  [MN]
L:  It's -- it's -- it's terrible.  But, uh, I don't know.
R:  [MN] Could be a private gang.  I mean, nothing to do with the government itself.
L:  Uh, which w- where?
R:  From Ir- -- you know, from, uh, the Middle East.  It could be something that's totally not -- non governmental.  It could be just, uh --
L:  Yeah.  These religious, uh, fanatics, you know.  They --
R:  Right.
L:  They use, uh -- the problem is, you see, they would get nowhere if the US would have a light footprint on the world, like if they -- you know, if they'd hold back their corporations from just taking so much control all over the world, they'd hold back.  Then if these fanatics came around and looked for support, and they can't do anything without support, they wouldn't find support if -- if the US was well liked around the world, but they're making themselves so hated, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that fanatics can find a lot of recruits, you know.  It's -- or they can find a support system.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's -- it's very -- very unfortunate, I think.  I think they're just dead wrong, meaning Bush and his people.  They're just -- I know -- I have a feeling that they might have attempted to just show the US as being like a crazy maniac out of control to try to scare people so they don't do anything.
R:  Right.
L:  That might be behind their thinking.  I just think they're wrong.  I think it's gonna backfire.  I don't know.  I --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- hope it doesn't but I think it is.
R:  Right.  They --
L:  'Cause nobody likes a bully, you know.  And the US --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- is being a bully.  Uh, I don't know.  Might be wrong.  All right, they say, "Oh, they respect us.  They might hear[?] us but they respect us".  Well, I'm not so sure.  I mean -- i- if they -- if they happen to be wrong, well, here -- here, we in New York are going to be blown up so I don't wanna -- I don't wanna risk that so --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I don't blame you.  I don't blame you at all.  I know it's -- it's a very scary, um --
