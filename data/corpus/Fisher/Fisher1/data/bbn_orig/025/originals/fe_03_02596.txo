L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  My name is Jill.
R:  Hi, Jill, I'm Sarah.
L:  Hi. [COUGH]
R:  How you doing? [LAUGH]
L:  Good.  How are you?  I've never done this before. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, neither have I.  It sounds, I don't know, interesting.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  But, yeah.  Okay, so I didn't entirely hear the question.  Did it -- we're supposed to just talk about arms in Iraq?
L:  It said --
R:  Disarming?
L:  I believe the question said --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- "What do you think, if anything, should the US do about disarming Iraq?"
R:  [NOISE] Disarming Iraq?  Right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay.  All righty, do you wanna start or [LAUGH] [inaudible]?
L:  Well, go ahead. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, um, well, I don't think we should've been there in the first place.  Um, I don't think they were any or near as much of a threat as places like North Korea are.  Um, [LIPSMACK] and we probably should have tried to disarm them first before we even went somewhere where we can't even really find anything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] [inaudible] but that's me.  I know it's a bit inflammatory. [LAUGH] I don't know.  What do you think?
L:  Well, I -- you know, I mean, I don't think that war is ever a good thing.  I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  It -- sometimes it's necessary, but it's never good.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, I do think that Saddam was a very bad person.
R:  I agree.  I -- I absolutely agree.
L:  But I also think that I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, North Korea probably is also a -- a big threat to the United States --
R:  I mean, yes.
L:  -- because they probably do have nuclear weapons.
R:  Yeah.  Well, we know they do.  I mean --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- they've -- they've started [LAUGH] -- they've started a reactor. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, they've started the process.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, whether we ever will be able to find out that they actually have assembled weapons --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, is another thing.  [SIGH] You know, I don't -- I think all in all the, um, I don't know ...
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I just -- I -- I don't even know if there are any in Iraq honestly. [LAUGH] I'm really starting to doubt it.
L:  Well, you know --
R:  But --
L:  -- they found some -- some questionable stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they've -- yet they have not -- they --
R:  Wasn't it, like, pesticides?
L:  -- they've yet to find -- I'm sorry?
R:  I don't know.  [LAUGH] It was like pesticides or something like that, I don't know.
L:  Well, I think it was, like, mustard gas.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Agents that, you know -- and that -- that is bad stuff.  I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  But, you know, and some have compared Saddam to Hitler, which, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  I- in ess-
R:  Huh. [NOISE]
L:  In essence, he -- he was, you know, a dictator and like I said, it's -- it's probably a good thing that he's no longer in power.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But whether they were really the biggest threat for -- for the United States to be addressing at the time --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think remains to be seen.
R:  Definitely.  And I -- yeah, but I -- I just -- I think there's a lot of propaganda involved, too, as there is with any -- any kind of military action.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know.  I don't -- I don't feel like we're getting the full story.  I think it's definitely been very obscured.
L:  There -- well --
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah, there's -- and, you know, maybe there are reasons that we don't get the full story, I don't know.
R:  Right.  'Cause I mean, like, looking at other international news sources, they -- they provide a much different type of coverage.
L:  Right.
R:  Like, say, British news, for instance, is --
L:  Right, and I have read --
R:  -- far more critical.
L:  I have read some reports from British news [SIGH] online before.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I -- you know, I'm f- -- a little -- familiar with, you know, the other side of things, the way that [SIGH] -- that other countries are, [SIGH] you know, responding and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what they're saying about it and everything.  But [SIGH] I don't know, I guess all in all what it boils down to is that he was given a deadline and he didn't, you know -- I guess --
R:  Yeah.
L:  At that point, for us to back down it would have been ... I don't know.
R:  Right.  I just --
L:  You know, kind of --
R:  I don't -- I -- I didn't -- I didn't see that he wasn't -- I mean, I -- I understand that there's a fine line between full cooperation and not, [LAUGH] you know, not cooperating --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- but seeming to comply.  I -- I don't know.  I don't think that was investigated far enough, and I really think we messed up by not going with world opinion, uh, that we needed more time to really look and see if he was indeed lying because the ultimatum we gave him was just to leave.
L:  Right.
R:  And that's -- that's a tough ultimatum.  I mean, who's gonna really do that?  It was kind of a declaration of war.
L:  Right, and, you know --
R:  So.
L:  I mean, from what -- from all reports it looks like that's what happened anyway.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- no- nobody has ever confirmed whether he was actually alive or dead, just that he is --
R:  Right.
L:  -- out of power, so, you know, it's --
R:  Exactly.
L:  It's kinda -- where are you calling from, by the way?
R:  [NOISE] Pardon me? [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Yes, I was just asking where you're from?
R:  Oh, I'm -- I'm actually -- I'm from California, but I live in New York City.
L:  Oh, are -- do you really?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I'm from Texas.  I'm from Texas, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Right, interesting, yeah.  I -- I thought so.  I was -- I was sensing the -- the drawl. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, but, you know --
L:  And, you know --
R:  -- it's interesting --
L:  Geo- --
R:  -- int- --
L:  George Bush was our governor before he was our president, and as a -- as our governor he did a good job.  But, you know --
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  And I know that his approval rating has dropped some in the past few months, but I don't know.  All in all --
R:  Yeah, I'm just --
L:  You know ...
R:  -- definitely not a fan myself. [LAUGH]
L:  Are you not?
R:  No.  Yeah, but you probably picked up on that, you know.
L:  Well, yeah, but you -- you know.
R:  I think it's --
L:  I'm partial because I'm from Texas, you know.
R:  Right, yeah, and that's --
L:  And --
R:  -- you know, that's understandable.
L:  It just --
R:  But I -- [SIGH] I have -- I have big problems with him --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  I really do.  Just, yeah, I've -- yeah, I'm -- I'm kind of -- it -- it's really kind of making me feel kind of unpatriotic even that -- that he's in -- in power and [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, it's -- it's been -- it's -- it's frustrating to me 'cause I -- I feel like he hasn't listened to people as much as he should have and he took actions that were very detrimental to our -- our place in the world.  I mean, I -- I -- I think other -- other countries aren't gonna wanna be friends with us any more, as infantile as that sounds, but he's -- you know, he's really, really killed some of our relationships with other countries, which is really unfortunate because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's the way we need to go and we're not the only people on the planet. [LAUGH] You know, there's --
L:  And I really hope that that's not the case.  I mean, when --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when it all boils down because, you know, when other countries are in trouble, we always go to their aid, you know.
R:  Well, sometimes, though, not -- just not always. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I don't -- I just mean throughout history.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not --
R:  Right.
L:  -- particularly, you know, in any partic- -- just, you know, throughout history, we have always been some -- a country that other countries have turned to [SIGH] for support during times of trouble.
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  And I just -- you know, I hope that after everything is over, other countries can look past everything that's happened, you know, and --
R:  I fully agree.
L:  And --
R:  I really, really do. [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  And view, you know -- and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, you know, put everything in perspective, I guess. [COUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I -- I hope -- I hope this doesn't hurt us as much as it -- as it could stand to and -- oh, and -- and aside from that, I -- I think it's pretty appalling the state of our country [LAUGH] and that we're going off and spending billions of dollars.  'Cause I'm a teacher and it's -- it's -- it's awful.  I mean, all the first year teachers in California have been laid off because of budget problems and the -- the state of schools next year is gonna be just [NOISE] awful, awful, really bad.  And, you know, we're spending money in Iraq and not in schools. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  And see I don't --
R:  That's just really hard for me to deal with.
L:  Texas has not been hit with any of that --
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  So, I'm not -- but I know Oklahoma has and my sister is a teacher in Oklahoma.
R:  Right.
L:  And they have suffered some budget cuts and are having to look at starting school later in the year because it's so hot here.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It'll save so much money on air conditioning, you know, and things of that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- losing their -- well, I know Oklahoma fired all of their janitors.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the teachers are now gonna be responsible for keeping their own rooms clean.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, you know, I am familiar a little bit.  Texas has not so much had anything --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- along those lines to happen.
R:  No, yeah, it's -- it's -- California is just being devastated right now with -- with the cuts.  It's really incredible.  And, uh, actually same thing in New York City.
L:  Right.
R:  New York City is -- the budget here is just -- it's incredible, so many people are being laid off all the time in -- in public service and it just really saddens me to see all these people who are trying to do things to improve our quality of life and, you know, they're -- they're being laid off. [LAUGH] And that's -- that's sad, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because that's -- that's not -- that's not -- that's not the point of this country.  The point of this country is to, you know, to kind of everybody gets to do their thing, everyone can find employment --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the government helps us out instead of hurts us, and we divert our attentions inward --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- rather than, you know, going out and dealing with problems that really aren't ours to deal with. [LIPSMACK] Um, err, well, they are, they are in the sense that we are the most powerful country in the world --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and we should be -- we should be looking -- looking at what's going on, certainly, and being part of the diplomatic process, but not necessarily -- not -- not going to war like that when the rest of the world isn't with us, when we have -- when we have such problems at home.
L:  Right.  And, you know --
R:  So.
L:  I think -- I don't know, somehow in my opinion --
