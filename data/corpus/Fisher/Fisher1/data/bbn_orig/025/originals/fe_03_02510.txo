R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, this is Jonathan.  How are you?
L:  Just fine.  Hi, how are you?  I'm Tessie.
R:  Hi, Tessie.  Uh, what do you think about reality TV?
L:  Um, I probably watch more of them than I'm supposed to.  [LAUGH]
R:  And which ones in particular?
L:  Oh, my gosh.  Um.  [LIPSMACK] Survivor, American Idol, [SIGH] Big Brother, uh, The Bachelor shows.  
R:  And why do you choose those rather than the traditional fiction based television?
L:  Because it seems -- [MN] it's [MN] -- I guess it's just watching real people.  Real life.  And --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's -- it's interesting to see what goes on with real people rather than just what somebody --
R:  Just actors.
L:  -- wrote some time.
R:  Just something scripted?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you -- do you feel that this is all spontaneous?  That it isn't scripted in any way?
L:  Oh, some of it I feel is definitely scripted.  Especially shows like Survivor.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, some of the things just appear to be very scripted.  
R:  And how does that make you feel?  Do you think that there's something less authentic?  Is there something more deceptive about that?
L:  No, I think it's --
R:  The illusion of reality?
L:  It probably makes for a better -- a better -- better television show.  
R:  Okay.
L:  To have a portion of it structured and -- and -- and possibly script- -- uh, script- -- uh, scripted.  But at least if it's structured, you know, somebody's watching out to see that the viewers are actually going to get something out of it that they're looking for.
R:  And it -- it -- there seem to be character types in each of these shows, the -- the  same way that you would find in a -- a traditional drama --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or situation --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- comedy.
L:  Mhm.  That all, --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I suppose, has to do with the casting people.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, so, you know, somebody definitely knows what -- what people are wanting to watch.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  And, well, I guess it was the Real World on MTV that started a lot of these.  It seems like.
L:  Real World.  Road Rules.  Yeah, those are -- I know they're a couple of shows I -- I don't watch consistently but, um, you know, I -- I have seen those.  Um, even the shows like, uh --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- Trading Spaces and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- While You Were Out.  You know, the -- the other shows that are using real people doing, you know, basically non scripted things but, um, that to me is a type of reality show too.
R:  Do you think that there's some sort of [MN] -- is -- is -- is there a pleasure to be [MN] derived, especially in uncomfortable situations, when people get -- I know on some of these shows the people get humiliated in front of the entire country.
L:  Um.
R:  I think on The Bachelor that might have happened a couple of times.
L:  Yeah, and I don't know that there's pleasure that comes out of it but it's certainly real life.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean it's something that they don't necessarily write into, you know, a show like Friends or something like that.  We know all of that is, you know, put together to -- to follow a storyline.  
R:  Right.
L:  But, I mean, [MN] on the reality show, on The Bachelor, that's what the whole season is leading up to, is that one particular, you know, is he or isn't he?  You know, which one is he going to pick?
R:  Right.
L:  And they keep us hanging on every week with it.  [LAUGH]
R:  So the emotions are real --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the people are experiencing?
L:  Right.  It -- it seems like it.
R:  Yeah.  Now, what about -- has -- have you cut back on the other types of television that you watch now because you're watching all -- so much reality based TV?
L:  Um, [SIGH] I would say yes.  And probably the area that has been cut back is sitcoms.
R:  Okay.  So, you --
L:  Because the dramas are s- -- I'm still probably watching the same number of drama shows.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but it's sitcoms that I've cut back on.
R:  Uh, that's interesting.  I'm sure that the sitcom writers are probably not too happy about that.
L:  Probably not.  [LAUGH] 
R:  However it seems to be -- it seems to be a trend though.  I think that's -- so it's probably true.
L:  Yeah, but it's kind of hard to do a real -- well and I guess they have 'em, reality shows like ER and, you know, The Practice.  Things like that.  There's always Court TV and --
R:  Right.
L:  And Trauma Room and things like that.  But they don't have a storyline so ...
R:  Right.
L:  Whereas the reality shows that are on right now do tend to have some sort of a -- a continuation from week to week.
R:  Do -- do you --
L:  So ...
R:  -- ever feel -- yeah -- do you ever feel like you're, on -- on the reality shows, it's -- it's -- there's something -- some -- [MN] almost a little bit voyeuristic about it.  I mean, it's like peeping through the keyhole at somebody on those things.
L:  Um, originally --
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- when --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- Big Brother came on.  Yes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's definitely how it felt.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, now I think that they structure their day in such a way that it doesn't feel that way anymore.  
R:  So you're just, kind of, along with them.  You're one of the -- you're just another set of eyes rather than somebody who's watching without people knowing that you're watching.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Yeah.  So there's something more participatory in this than [MN] there would be in -- in --in a sitcom, definitely.
L:  Well, yes.  Especially when [MN] the majority of the reality shows now days seems like that they want the public to call in to vote on this or that.  
R:  Right.
L:  So, you know, the people definitely know that they're being watched.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, they're playing it -- as the shows are progressing they're playing more to the camera.
R:  Right.
L:  Rather than, you know, just sitting around doing nothing, like the first season of all these things did.
R:  Right.  Because it seems to me [MN] it -- it seems to me [MN] that a lot of these people they, uh -- they -- they go into this with their eyes open certainly, but it seems like they're trying to leverage it into a career.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They think, well, when the shows end they end up on, you know, on Entertainment Tonight or they end up on the Tonight Show or the David Letterman Show or ...
L:  Right.  That's -- they're all trying to get back on television for something.
R:  Right.  They're trying to use it as a -- as a [MN] leaping, uh, stepping stone to some kind of a film career or acting, whatever it is.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Entertainment.  Yeah.
L:  And honestly I haven't seen, to my recollection, any of them do anything past their, you know, their second fifteen minutes.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, you know, they're on their show and then they may do a -- a talk show circuit or something like that.  But then they're done.  
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  I haven't seen anybody do anything else.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  I -- I remember that there was that one girl from the original Survivor -- I think Colleen is -- is the one.  She made -- she was in that -- a movie.  But that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- didn't -- you know, she didn't.
L:  Lucky Break.
R:  She disappeared after that.  Yeah.
L:  And it was an awful movie.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I guess that's the -- the idea that they have, a lot of them.  They go in thinking they're going to be able to -- to use it to leapfrog to something else.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Now, which -- which one would you say is your favorite of all of them?
L:  Um, Survivor.
R:  Survivor is?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's been what?  It's in the third or fourth season now?
L:  It's five or six, actually.
R:  Is it that many now?  Wow.  I didn't even realise.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Now, how 'bout the American Idol?  The only one that I really watch is American Idol.
L:  Mhm.  I'm very much into that one right now.
R:  Yeah.  That -- that one I -- I'm surprised that I have -- I didn't watch it last year but somehow I got -- I -- I -- I turned it on this year and it is.  It's very addictive.
L:  Last year I came into it, um, when there were probably five people left.  And this year I started out with the auditions.
R:  Right.
L:  So, you know, that was a different perspective too, to see how they pick the people to -- to be put on to these shows.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, so that was interesting.
R:  It seems like the odd -- yeah.
L:  To watch it from the beginning up to now.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Which, you know, there's what?  Four of them left now.
R:  Right.  Who did they get rid of last night?  I didn't even -- I didn't get to see that.
L:  Uh, Trenice.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It was actually between Trenice and Reuben --
R:  Mm.  
L:  -- last night.
R:  Wow.  
L:  And Josh Grayson just kind of skated by.  So ...
R:  Mm.  Yeah, it's --
L:  Which is interesting.  [LAUGH]
R:  It is.  It's -- I mean, I think of lot of that is [MN] the -- the fact that he's been able to linger is because there's a patriotism right now and the fact that he's a marine, I would say.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know that he's necessarily as talented as -- as some of the -- I don't think he would've made the cut if he weren't a marine.
L:  [MN] I don't either.  I -- I -- I definitely don't.
R:  And he played that up.
L:  And I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we'll probably start seeing a lot more of those type of people cast on these shows.  
R:  Right.
L:  Because, I mean, it's definitely a -- a draw, you know, for viewers to watch something like that.  The timing for him was perfect.  
R:  Sure.  Sure.
L:  So, you know, I think that they will start looking [SIGH] at the casting a little -- a little --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- more closely and tr- -- you know, trying to put people on there that other people are interested in and, you know, what's going on in the time.
R:  Sure.  Yeah.  They want to make it possible.  Now how 'bout when that -- that one, what was his name?  Corey.  He got dismissed because he had beaten his sister up or ...?
L:  Because he [LAUGH] -- he had a criminal --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, something show up on his -- on his past and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- they just kicked him off in [LAUGH] the middle of the show.
R:  And the other -- I think there was another one of them, the earlier people, who was dismissed because she had a background.  She was in vide- -- um, internet --
L:  Frenchie is --
R:  -- porn or something.
L:  Right.  And she's actually gone on to talk shows and she was on Jenny Jones and --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- stuff like that.  And, you know, I mean she's had her fifteen minutes, even though she didn't get to be on the show.
R:  Right.  She found a way to get the attention.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN]
L:  Mhm.
R:  [COUGH]  [LIPSMACK] Huh.
L:  So, I -- it's definitely about the -- the attention.  Um ...
R:  Now, do you ever feel guilty, uh [MN] because it seems like there's nothing really enriching about it.  I -- you know, uh, it seems like it's almost -- it's -- do you feel as if it's junk food?
L:  It -- definitely -- it is definitely the junk food of television.  Um, because there is absolutely zero educational value.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, nothing redeeming about the shows at all.  
R:  Right.
L:  There's nothing that we learn from it.  There's nothing, you know, that you can walk away as a better person for having watched it.  
R:  Right.
L:  But it is entertaining.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  And -- and that's I guess, at -- at the end of the day, what people want is -- they -- I guess they -- they get their mental stimulation --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- another place.
L:  Yeah.  [MN]  You know, th- -- we've all -- we've got the Discovery Channel for all of the other.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  But when it comes
