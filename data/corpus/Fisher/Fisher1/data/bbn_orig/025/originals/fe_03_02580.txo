L:  Hello, I'm Mia.
R:  Hi, this is Lisa.
L:  Hello.
R:  [COUGH] Hi.
L:  Uh, well, we got quite a topic 'cause --
R:  Y- yeah.  I- it's very timely for sure and to be honest I'm not as politically minded [LAUGH] so, um --
L:  Well, it seemed kinda like a point. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  At this point because we already did it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  We -- we took care of it.  It's kinda, "Okay.  Now what?" you know.
L:  Yeah.  It's gonna be a tough one.
R:  [COUGH] Um, we -- yeah, we -- we -- we definitely, um, brought down the Hussein regime and now, I guess, we just have to install a new government [LAUGH] or help --
L:  I guess.
R:  -- build a democracy there but ...
L:  Or something.
R:  Yeah.  Who knows how that's gonna go.  I -- I don't really know what to expect.  Sometimes -- I don't know, seems like when you replace a leader, later on the replacement becomes just kind of --
L:  Worse than --
R:  -- not so great also.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, over time, you know.
L:  No.  That's -- that's happened a lot.
R:  [COUGH] Yeah.
L:  So, in history, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That the cure is worse than the disease.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  I mean, it seems like it's so tough over there now 'cause it's so chaotic.
R:  Definitely.  Definitely so.  I can't imagine just what -- what the citizens are feeling and going through.  It's gotta be -- although [COUGH] they've been liberated it's gotta be somewhat traumatic because the whole way of life that you've known all of a sudden -- I mean, even if it's bad, you're like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- used to it and you just know how to work with it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but then somebody comes along and kinda changes everything and gives you all these freedoms but you don't really know exactly -- you know, I -- I think just it's a massive change and I think some of them might be having a, you know, kind of a difficult time of figuring out --
L:  I think so.
R:  -- what's going on and [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- maybe even having some fears that, you know, somehow Saddam Hussein will retaliate against the people or whatever --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for -- you know, the ones who cheered when, you know, they brought a statue down and whatnot.  I don't know.  I mean, I just can't imagine being in those two --
L:  I know.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Well, actually I saw one thing on TV one thing about a -- a family that Iraq have, um -- the husband and wife are both doctors.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They had worked for the government and they don't know when they're ever gonna get paid again.  They --
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  -- lost their home and they have [inaudible] --
R:  Oh, that's right.
L:  -- their little two year old.  They have to live with their parents again.
R:  Oh.
L:  And they just don't know what's going on.
R:  Oh, my gosh.  I didn't think about that.  That's terrible.
L:  I know --
R:  But you're right that all the government employees, it's like, well --
L:  Yeah.  Where [MN] --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Where's their, you know, pay check gonna come from?
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Which is awful.
R:  Oh, my gosh and they -- you know, I mean, not only for themselves but I'm sure they have families to feed and ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  I didn't even -- that didn't even occur to me.  That's terrible.
L:  Yeah.  That -- that --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- was almost the worst part because it's like, well, if you were living in a slum it's probably going to be the same but if you were just having kind of a reasonably normal life, you know, as a professional or something --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you probably worked for the government 'cause there's not a lot I -- I wouldn't think, private enterprise over there.
R:  Probably not, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think everything's probably pretty much, um, politically controlled [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, so, you know --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I hope that they get something in place for those people to be able to go work and whatnot.
R:  Oh, my gosh.  I just can't imagine.  I wonder how many people would want -- would -- would wanna like emigrate somewhere else, you know what I mean, just --
L:  I was wondering that too because I'm wondering are we gonna get a lot of Iraqi refugees moving to America?
R:  Yeah, see, I don't -- yeah --
L:  After this.
R:  -- I wonder about that too --
L:  'Cause if you --
R:  -- because --
L:  -- think about it, like, you've got a lot of Vietnamese, you know, immigrants coming here after the Vietnam War.  At least --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- where I live, in the part of the country where I live there's a lot of -- of Vietnamese.
R:  Yeah.  You're absolutely right.  They did and -- and that does make me wonder because again it goes back to, you know, well, either a -- maybe some of the people [NOISE] who actually, you know, kinda followed Saddam Hussein because he was their leader and -- and really came to believe in him [MN] might be disgruntled and leave but then also the people who just fear what's next.  You know, "My -- my land is in an uproar.  Everything I've known has just gone tipsy +turvy and even though --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- it may be ben- -- everybody feels it's gonna be beneficial for us, I'm scared and I need to get the hell out of Iraq" you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I know.
R:  I mean --
L:  I know.
R:  [COUGH] I just --
L:  Or to see an opportunity because, like, you know, who wouldn't want to live in America.  And it just wasn't an option, I wouldn't think, for Iraqis to -- to emigrate here pretty much before because I don't suppose they would let them out.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.  That's true --
L:  I mean, I think they're --
R:  -- this may really open up --
L:  [several inaudible words] defector.
R:  -- the floodgates, especially, um, because it's -- you know, we're still seen as the land of -- of capital and commercial opportunity and so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if they just really wanna go make a living and have their religious freedoms and -- and this is -- this is the place to be, you know.
L:  I know.  I would definitely want --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- to. [MN]
R:  Yeah.  If I didn't live here --
L:  [inaudible] an issue.
R:  -- I would probably be trying to get here. [MN]
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  [COUGH] With the exception of maybe like Sweden because they might be just about as good but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in a different way but, uh --
L:  But, I mean, I -- I think like -- I wonder what -- if you have an easier time emigrating to America because -- if your country's been in a war with us?
R:  Yeah, I don't know.  I wonder.  That's a good -- that's a good question.  I don't know if --
L:  Because it's easier.
R:  -- IMF would be more flexible --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, with -- with, um, you know, incoming -- incoming citizens than they would normally if we hadn't just been a -- you know, that's a really good -- that's a really good point.  Gosh.
L:  I wondered about that.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  That would be interesting to research though to find out.  Like, you know, I don't know if I'd look it up on the web or something but that is a really good question and do they -- and have they always had flexi programs like that where they're kind of like a little more lenient and open armed to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to refugees than to just general [COUGH] immigrants or, you know, do they put special programs in place for those particular groups at the time that they know that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, people are gonna be coming? [COUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  People are gonna be fleeing their -- their homeland [NOISE] so that's a really good point.
L:  Yeah.  I wondered about that.
R:  I just don't know. [NOISE] I kinda -- I -- I just --you know, I just feel for -- for those people because [SIGH] like I said, I know -- I know it's a good thing for them but it's such a huge change that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's just gotta be -- they've gotta be kind of shocked and stuff and --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- [COUGH] to be handed all this freedom after they've been like under the thumb for so long it's just gotta be kinda like, "Well, now what do I do?" [LAUGH]
L:  I know.
R:  Like, "What's the first thing I should do?  You know --"
L:  I know.
R:  -- besides after we celebrate in the streets, now what?  How do I get on with my life from here?" you know --"
L:  I know.
R:  -- for those that are trying to decide whether to stay or leave Iraq or for those that -- that just know that they wanna stay but just don't know what to do with themselves now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [COUGH] [NOISE]
L:  I know.
R:  So, that's -- that's really, uh --
L:  Really tough.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  But I guess like time heals all wounds eventually, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and they will get -- regain some kind of stability after a while --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's hard to go through those type of periods where things really aren't stable.  I mean, like --
R:  Hopefully --
L:  -- I don't know how you live your daily life under those circumstances.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, I just can't imagine.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I suppose after -- as time goes by you get used to anything or if that's the -- like the way it's always been --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- your whole life, you know, if it's somebody was, you know, just kinda born and grew up and is -- is sort of a young adult --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, through Saddam H- Hussein's reg- --
L:  Right.
R:  -- regime then, I mean, that's -- that's just the way you've always known it and you've never really known it any other way --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you didn't -- I mean you pro- probably could dream of different possibilities or hear of stories of different ways but, yeah, I mean, it's just like, "Well [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's always been this way, now what?"  You know, "Or I can't wait to do this or --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's always just [COUGH] -- I wondered about the oil control though too.  It kind of -- like I said, I think [COUGH] somebody having that much -- that much control over [COUGH] a product that is so globally needed especially by us, the big dogs over here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [COUGH] I just don't know -- even if we install like our favorite pick for, you know, the -- the Iraqi leader, the new Iraqi president --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even though we say it's gonna be an election or whatever --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or if we just kind of -- suppose, well, if our government just hangs back a little bit and sees what the people do --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as far as picking someone [COUGH].  I mean, I just -- I just don't know that, you know, in -- in ten or fifteen years that we're not gonna have some guy going up, going, "I control the oil" you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just, you know -- just, you know, because absolute power just makes you go crazy and if you --
L:  For sure.
R:  -- have that much control over something that other people want so badly, sure, you're just gonna start going a little muddy and want --
L:  I know.
R:  -- 'em to play -- let's play this power game and that power game and --
L:  I know.
R:  [COUGH] So, I just --
L:  Well, it's -- it's real weird to have so much of that resource just concentrated in one particular area of the world.
R:  I think that's not a good thing. [LAUGH]
L:  That's an unstable one too.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know.  That's why I definitely --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you know, when I eventually hopefully would buy another car I'd definitely get one of those hybrids so that just to use a little bit less, you know.
R:  Oh, I think those are cool, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I feel like --
R:  Yeah, I've seen the new Honda one and I -- I really like that.  I think that's pretty cool.
L:  Yeah.  It's just not safe to be so --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- dependent on something that we don't control really. [LAUGH]
R:  See, I think I've always thought that was so goofy too.  I mean, there's just not -- I mean, we've already milked all the oil out of our country or the -- the majority of it, which I guess --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is -- I assume is why we started, you know, importing it so many years ago 'cause, you know, they've taken as much as they can out of Alaska --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and -- and out of the, you know, the, uh -- the southern continent in the US and it's like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- well, there isn't a whole lot there.  We've kind of tapped all that.  We're gonna have to get it imported and it seems like the Middle East is the only place.
L:  Well, yeah, I mean --
R:  Nobody else seems to have it, [MN] like you said.
L:  It's weird.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I know there's some in Russia because I, uh -- I -- I don't know who they're selling -- they -- they -- they need it for themselves or something because it's a big country, Russia.
R:  That's true.  They are.
L:  So, they don't import so much.
R:  They are pretty large.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wonder.  Yeah.  It's just -- it seems like we should or could have by now tried to find another way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So that we weren't quite so dependent.  I mean, I don't think we'll ever be able to eliminate --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- some --
L:  Probably not.
R:  -- dependency on the Middle East for oil.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I think we need to find other ways to supplement that. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I don't know if it's through, you know, manufacturing process if we can, you know -- or alternative -- alternative energy, alternative --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- fuels, um, or like you said, you know, maybe finding another region of the world who has a good oil supply and saying --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- "Let's -- let's make a deal.  If you've got a little to spare, we'll get some barrels from ya" and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [COUGH] So, I just --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- yeah, I don't think it's a good idea that we -- we are so desperate for them and, like you said, it's such an un- -- even -- even a fight from Iraq is just such a -- a place of unr- --
