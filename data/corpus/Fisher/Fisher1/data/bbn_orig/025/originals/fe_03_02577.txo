R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Sharon.
L:  I'm Denise.
R:  How are you today?
L:  I'm just fine.  How are you doing?
R:  I'm good.
L:  Good.
R:  So, this is my first time doing this so ...
L:  I did it yesterday.  Yesterday was my first so --
R:  Oh, really.  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But this is kind of an old topic, don't you think?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What we should do about Iraq. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's touchy.  It really is.
L:  It's kinda like we have already done something, haven't we? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  How do you feel about what we've done?
R:  Well, you know, I'm torn.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I understand -- I'm glad I'm not the president and having to make these decisions.  But part of me feels you can't go into another country and tell them how to run their country because we don't like it.
L:  Right.
R:  And the other part of me says we're protecting ourselves.  We're being proactive.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, so --
L:  That's --
R:  -- hopefully nothing will happen to us.
L:  Right.  Right.  Well, the [SIGH] -- um, kinda have the feelings that you have.  I don't feel like we should just go into another country but with the things that's been going on in Iraq for more than a decade, um, you know, [MN] it goes back to World War One and World War Two.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, the Germanys and the n- -- you know the Germans and --
R:  And Hitler.
L:  -- the Nazis and so forth.  You know, what do you do?  Do you let this tyrant continue to run the country and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and kill people and have these mass murders and stuff, you know?  I can't see being able, you know, to allow that to happen when --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so many of the Iraqi people it appears wanted us there.  You know --
R:  Yes.  A lot --
L:  -- I know you see --
R:  It seemed that way too to me.
L:  Mhm.  You see a lot, especially now on TV, about the, um, y- -- mostly Iraqis who are protesting the -- the military being there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but -- but from what I gather from the news agencies it -- it's a small majority so they're just --
R:  Right.
L:  That's really what they're focusing on and making it really, you know, look worse than it is but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, judging from the number of Iraqi people who have, uh, seeked asylum in this country --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, over the past decade, I mean, they're -- they're in the millions [MN] so --
R:  Wow. [LAUGH]
L:  -- that tells me that -- you know, that they fled Saddam Hussein and his regime --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and to hear 'em --
R:  And his --
L:  -- talk and they did a lot of interviews with a bunch of 'em, some of the news media did, especially Fox News.  I don't know if you watched any of it?
R:  No.
L:  Um, they told their stories about things that he had done and the people he had killed that -- that we related to them and some of that type stuff so it's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- really, really, really sad, I mean, what he has done.  Uh, in that instance I feel we should h- -- do something because if they were in a position where they could not help themselves then --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, someone needs to help them and it's clear that, you know, o- --all of the --
R:  People can --
L:  -- Arab countries --
R:  People can come to the United States because we stand for freedom.
L:  Right.  And we are the biggest superpower, you know.
R:  That's -- yes.
L:  Um, at [MN] the -- all of the states over in the Middle East, all the countries, rather, uh, they're [SIGH] -- there are so many terrorists that's running rampant --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that it seems --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to be that, you know, they're not going to help -- I mean, they're just -- i- it's practically been proven that he was, uh -- Saddam Hussein was, um, connected with a lot of the terrorist groups.
R:  Sure.
L:  But I -- I feel he was a terrorist himself.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, in his own country, so I really was behind the president and the troops and I'm like you I -- I'm glad I wasn't the one to have to make the decision and so forth.
R:  I couldn't.
L:  I -- i- if I was put in that position, I would have made the same decision the president did.
R:  I think I would also.
L:  Um, i- -- ju- -- you know, judging from all he had done, plus the weapons of mass destruction, I feel that they're -- they are there or have been there and there probably are still some more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  In fact, I have a feeling -- I feel like maybe the US has found some, you know.  They've tested --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a lot.  And I feel like they have found some.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That they are not --
R:  Well, they did talk about, you know, evidence of some things being there --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of weapons of mass destruction.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, the products to be making them.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But if they did find them I think they're going to use the media to their own advantage to tell us what we should know.
L:  Right.  But i- in the same token I feel like they're not telling us all yet because, um, they want to continue to search the rest of the country --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- for them, you know --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- and they may have pressure not to and -- the same reason the president did not declare victory last night in his speech.  Did you watch his speech?
R:  No.
L:  He didn't declare victory simply because by way of the Geneva Convention, if he had declared vi- uh, victory, then we would no longer would have been able to search for Saddam or any of his people.
R:  Oh.
L:  We would not have been able to search for weapons of mass destruction and we would have had to release all the prisoners of war.
R:  Right.
L:  So, he's not going to declare a victory, of course.
R:  I did not know that.
L:  That's what --
R:  That little --
L:  -- they said last night.
R:  -- technicality.
L:  Uh-huh.  That was interesting to me.  Um --
R:  Wow.
L:  And that's why we're not gonna be claiming victory until we're com- completely finished in Iraq.  He just simply said that the war part phase of it, we -- we were victorious --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but we were not finished.  You know, there was a lot still left to be done so --
R:  You know, I wonder when are they going to call it being finished?  When are they going to be satisfied?
L:  I feel like once they find -- myself, once they find all the weapons of mass destruction and have gone over the country with a fine toothed comb, which is what they're doing now, city to city, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Th- -- a lo- -- [SIGH] from what I hear a lot of 'em have been buried so they may not ever find all of 'em but once --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they feel satisfied that they have found the ones that they can find that are there, even if we don't find Saddam Hussein or proof that he's dead or anything, I feel like they might declare it a victory.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, they've released thousands -- already released thousands of prisoners of war that they had captured.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, already.  I know I saw after -- you know, after we stopped bombing and stuff, I saw one day where they released four hundred and another day where they released over seven hundred.  So --
R:  You know, I heard the stories of, uh, some of the -- the Iraqi soldiers just -- they saw the armed forces soldiers and just gave up right there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, they didn't even support the -- Iraq right then, you know.
L:  Right.  Right.  Lots of 'em --
R:  You know, "We're doing this --"
L:  -- turned tail and run.
R:  -- because -- we're doing this because Saddam says so but now you're here and I can --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I can, uh, you know, put forth my own opinion and, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  "-- be a free person" so to say.
L:  Absolutely, yeah, that i- -- th- -- in fact, uh, did you watch any of the war, at all?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I watched Fox News religiously --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- day and night if I could.  I don't work so I had it on all day long and would watch --
R:  I had --
L:  -- specially the --
R:  -- to be careful with the --
L:  -- embedded reporters.
R:  -- timing --
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  I had to be careful with the timing because our kids are eleven and nine.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  And they can see certain things.  My daughter's in sixth grade and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- her teacher wants her to watch some of it but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- some of it's too much, I think.  If it's hard --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for me to handle it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- she shouldn't so ...
L:  Yeah.  I have a twelve year old and --
R:  Okay, so --
L:  -- she didn't watch a whole lot of it.  She -- she usually watches her own thing in her room.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- and, of course, my husband's not that interested in, uh, the de- detail by detail of the end of the war.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I mean, he wanted to know what was going on but to sit and watch it he didn't care a whole lot about it.  But I watched it a lot during the day and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, at night, late after -- we would go to bed, uh, I'd sit up till like midnight and watch it, you know --
R:  Really?
L:  -- see what the rest -- see -- see what's happened from the time I quit watching it about three, four in the afternoon till --
R:  Right.
L:  -- till, you know, time to go to bed.
R:  Well, you know, for the -- like, the first week and a half, two weeks, I was doing that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then it seemed to be very repetitive and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I said, "Okay, when something big happens my husband's gonna know --"
L:  Right.
R:  -- and he's gonna tell me and then we'll have the TV on --
L:  Right.
R:  "-- about it".
L:  Right.  Right.  Right.  But, you know, they, um, in -- during the couple of weeks th- --of the major --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- war, there was, um -- they found lots of uniforms and weapons just abandoned where the guys --
R:  Really?
L:  -- had just taken their uniforms off and -- and disappeared into the crowd, back to their family, the republican guard and so forth.
R:  Wow.
L:  They found thousands and thousands of those so, uh, that goes to what you were saying about, you know, them abandoning their positions.
R:  Right.
L:  A lot of 'em did.
R:  Because it was a forced position.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, a lot of 'em, uh -- the media says that a lot of 'em that was in his army was forced to be there --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- even his upper people but his -- his head people he -- Saddam Hussein had killed like their parents or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- their children or something to force 'em to be in the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in their army and threatened to kill someone else in their family if they didn't, you know, that type --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- thing.  So, um, it's just been really interesting --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what's happened over there since, you know, we did start the war.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  But I -- I really am glad that we've done it and that it's over because I was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- very, very nervous about --
R:  Me too.
L:  -- going in with all the weapons of mass destruction and how many of our soldiers would be killed and so forth.
R:  Yeah, but it's i- -- all in all it's war.
L:  Right.
R:  People are gonna get hurt.
L:  Right.
R:  As tragic as it is, it's war and that's just something that has --
