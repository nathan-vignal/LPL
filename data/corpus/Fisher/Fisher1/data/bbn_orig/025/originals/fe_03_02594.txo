L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  Good, thanks. [NOISE] Um, so the -- what's our topic?  Ar- disarming Iraq?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] Kind of challenging.
L:  Kind of a heated one there. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know.  I was thinking, "Oh, goodie.  Should I pass?  Should I talk?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What the heck.  So --
L:  I know.  Yesterday's was so easy, reality TV. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yesterday's was easy.  Yesterday was, um, how our -- why do I think the [SIGH] -- the TV -- the Survivor kind of shows or reality TV was --
L:  Right.
R:  Anyway, [LIPSMACK] so we have to tackle the Iraq issue.
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, no, I don't think it's any of our business [LAUGH] to be in Iraq.
L:  Neither do I.  It's --
R:  Um, I -- I think that -- I think that it is important --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that -- that the world be safe --
L:  Right.
R:  But I think that -- that America is creating a lot of people hating us.
L:  Right.
R:  Because we're always butting into everybody's business.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  Like the uninvited mother in law or something like that.
L:  Yeah.  That's --
R:  Is that what you think?
L:  Yeah, that is pretty true.  Um, I've spent a lot of time overseas, like, even before this, long before September eleven, and a lot of the reaction to people that I worked with really is just very negative about Americans even going back then, and this is from our allies, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just because they think we're too cocky and too confident and, you know, going into places where we have no business and stuff like that.  So, I mean, I -- I kind of really fear for our opinion on the world stage at this point because I think that, you know, people are gonna be gunning to get us.
R:  Yeah.
L:  At the same time, the whole Iraq thing just makes me really uncomfortable because we went in there when we shouldn't have, we -- granted we did kick out Saddam Hussein, which was good, but we could have done that ten years ago.  We've known about him for a long [LAUGH] time.
R:  Yeah, and -- and I -- going on two years later, where's Osama?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You couldn't even find him --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but you're gonna just go bomb -- you know, a lot of people died.  A lot of people died.
L:  I -- I know.  I know.
R:  They're not showing us that and a lot of people died and whoopee, we got Saddam.  We -- actually we don't.  Where is he?
L:  Right.
R:  You know, he's probably took off, um --
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know if he took off just before or -- or right before they got there or a long time before --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and was controlling from an offsite location, but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I -- I don't trust the -- the secret service.
L:  No.
R:  Um, you know, who -- intelligence?
L:  No.
R:  I don't know what intelligence means, but it's not know where people are when they are where.
L:  Yeah, I -- I know.  There's a lot of stuff that they keep from us and I -- they say it's in the, you know, the interests of national security and stuff like that, but at the same time it kind of gives them a license to just do whatever the hell they want, you know, and I don't necessarily agree with that either.
R:  Which is unfortunately what's happening.  Locally, um, locally, you know, in our own nation --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we're giving up a lot of civil rights.
L:  Oh, I know, I know.
R:  You know, oh, you wanna -- you wanna tap my phone?  Sure, why not?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, because we wanna make sure we keep the scary people away.  Yeah, right.
L:  Right, I know.  And it's like if you're on the internet or something and people can read your email, and it's like, well, you know, it's the Freedom of Information Act blah blah blah, and it's like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well, no, it's not.  I have a right to privacy. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know.  Privacy is gone as far as -- I mean, even when this -- when this particular call came in specifically --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm thinking, "Oh, yeah, right".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "I'm gonna discuss this [LAUGH] on a cell phone".
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  But --
L:  It's -- yeah, it's true, but --
R:  But then again, you want -- if anybody wants to listen, hello, we don't like it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know.  That's true.
R:  You know.
L:  I'm worried, too, about the whole restructuring -- structuring of Iraq after this 'cause I think it's gonna be a huge, huge, huge financial burden for our country that we just can't even afford right now.
R:  Yeah, um, I don't know what type of work you do, but I've seen a serious slowdown in -- in the industry where I work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I work in construction.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And we're -- we're a small company that we've been doing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, millions --
L:  Right.
R:  -- dollars of work and suddenly we're down to, like, three construction projects.
L:  Right.
R:  Because locally I think people are worried.
L:  Oh --
R:  Am I gonna -- why do I wanna spend this money if I need to protect my family in a year from now?
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  I'm gonna have to feed them if we -- if some -- if we get attacked later on, I need to have money in the bank to feed my family 'cause the government's not gonna step in and bring food.
L:  Right.  No, it's true.  It's true, 'cause I work in retail and it's, you know, it's the same thing.  I'm on commission sales and I'm not making any money because people just aren't shopping, you know, [LAUGH] nobody wants to buy anything.
R:  Yeah, people are scared.  People, you know -- I think, um, not that I'm stashing the money in the mattress or anything, but I'm not spending at every whim like I'm accustomed to.
L:  You -- right, 'cause you don't know when it's gonna be coming in again.  Well, that's at least the feeling I have, you're not earning and it's kinda like --
R:  Right, you don't know.  You don't know what's coming up in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a year from now.
L:  Yeah.  So ...
R:  [SIGH] I, um, I was looking at -- at apartments and -- and there's just all kinds of different, um, different areas that have been affected.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I don't know if it's still because of the Iraq thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I -- I'm not sure what -- you know, what all is -- that brings it into the mix that's causing such a slowdown.
L:  I -- yeah, I don't know.  I mean, because economists predicted, like, a slowdown before September eleventh even hit, and I don't know if that, you know, really catalyzed things and just kind of drove everything to a halt or what, but it's -- it's really weird.  I mean, I don't know, I hope it picks up --
R:  Yeah, the market was -- the market was already on a -- on a down -- down curve, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but it just seems -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know if the -- I don't think that, like, going into Iraq, I don't think we should have been so quick to go.
L:  Oh, no, absolutely not.  I mean --
R:  Um --
L:  -- we didn't exhaust --
R:  The inspections and all of that stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't know.  At -- see, why are we inspecting Iraq looking for something we can't find and China's going, "Hello, yes, we're working on nuclear weapons".
L:  [LAUGH] It's true, it's true.
R:  It's like, excuse me, there's a serious danger, like, right here.
L:  I know.
R:  It's true, it's present, it exists.
L:  I know.
R:  They're aware of it.  They're telling us, "Yeah, we got 'em, so what?"
L:  Yeah.  That's --
R:  And we're going, "Well, wait a minute.  We can't spend any time on you right now 'cause we gotta go to Iraq and look for the shit we can't find".
L:  Well, the thing is, it was more of a personal vendetta with George Bush than it was, like, anything else.  There wasn't --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- a lot of dip- -- like, that's my opinion, at least.  It seems like he wanted to go in to prove to his father that he can do it, you know.
R:  I know.
L:  And it's just like --
R:  Jay Leno had a ball with that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  I can remem- --
R:  Father's Day --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- he was doing, "I don't know if I should buy my dad a tie rack or attack Iraq".
L:  [LAUGH] It's true, though.
R:  "Tie rack?  Attack Iraq?  Tie rack?  Attack Iraq?  I think I'll attack Iraq". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it was like, oh, my God, don't do this based on a -- you know, on a personal vendetta --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like you said, you know.  Don't -- don't go out there just to make daddy happy 'cause he didn't finish the job he should have done ten years ago.
L:  Right, yeah.  I -- yeah, I don't -- the whole thing is just so wrong on so many levels.  It's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's frightening.  But, yeah, I'm really worried, too, that if, um, we go in there and try to restructure Iraq like we did with Japan, it's gonna turn into one of those situations where, like, we're like, "Okay, you cannot have a military, but we'll pay for all of your defense and we'll pay for all of your this and we'll pay for all of your that".
R:  Yeah.  And where's that money coming from?
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, and --
R:  It's like Bush is saying, "I'm gonna drop taxes for you American citizens".
L:  Yeah.
R:  How do you drop taxes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and spend a whole lot of money in other countries?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't.  And, uh --
R:  I mean, how much -- how much money did they give Turkey --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just to allow them to use a little bit of space there?
L:  I know.  I know.
R:  It was -- it was not cheap, you know, and --
L:  And we've already just, you know, um, relieved the debts of a couple of poor countries and so they don't have to pay us back.
R:  Right.
L:  Which, I mean, I understand that, but we still need that money, too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, it's all fair and good but --
R:  And, "Oh, we'll just erase this".
L:  Yes. [NOISE]
R:  And then they go, "Well, why is corporate America such -- in such a shambles?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, look at the -- look at the example you're setting.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, you're just dismissing -- countries owe you money and you're just gonna write it off.
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  No big deal, you know, we won't go --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- after you because you helped us here and there.
L:  I know.  It's a --
R:  I don't know, maybe it -- maybe I'm --
L:  They could do that to my credit cards.  I mean, I'd be happy. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah, I got a couple of account numbers I wanna add to that list while you're wiping things out.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, but ...
R:  But, uh, I don't know where the, um -- maybe I'm just not political enough or maybe I am. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What's your education?
L:  Um, I've got a BA in art history and a minor in Asian studies, so --
R:  Cool.  Where are you from?
L:  I'm originally from the East Coast but I live in LA right now.
R:  LA?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.  I'm in Florida.
L:  Oh, awesome, very nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I love Florida.
R:  Yeah, I, um, um, I have an AA in bus- business administration.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I'm, like, my first semester into, [NOISE] uh, the university going for my --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  -- going for my bachelors.
L:  Very good for you.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  What are you planning to study?
R:  Uh, accounting.  I wanna be an accountant.
L:  Oh, cool, very cool.
R:  That's why I, you know, I say, you know, you've -- you've got accounting, uh -- I -- I guess that's why I got, um, voicey about that is because you've got, like, accounting firms and this Anderson --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- was quite a -- you know, quite a shock.--
L:  Right.
R:  -- that they were just looking the other way in all of this.  But then you look at the government.
L:  Right.
R:  If the government is willing to offset --
