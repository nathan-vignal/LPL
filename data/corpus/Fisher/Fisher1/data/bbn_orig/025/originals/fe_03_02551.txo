L:  Hi there.  My name's Ken.  Who's this?
R:  Hi, Ken. I'm Denise.
L:  Denise?  All right.  Where are you from?
R:  I'm in Denver now, but originally from Kan City.  What about you?
L:  King City, California?
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah -- no, I'm from Ca- Camario.  But, I mean, when you said King City, I didn't know if you Camario or -- or California or not.
R:  Oh no, I meant Kan City.  I'm sorry.
L:  Oh, Kansas City.
R:  That's that dialect they're trying to pick up on.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, ah, yeah.  You're the first person I've talked to outside of California.  Usually I get somebody nearby, for some reason.
R:  Oh yeah?  Because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of the time zones probably, yeah.
L:  Oh yeah, maybe that's why.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  So, that's interesting. Ah, the topic is reality TV.  Ah, and I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- guess --
R:  So, which ones do you watch, or like?
L:  [LAUGH] To the o- -- I only watch Survivor.  And I've watched every one, except the one in Australia.  For some reason I missed that one.  And I'm s- -- I sort of like it.  But I don't like any of the others.  I don't like The, ah, Bachelor, or any of those other ones -- the dating type ones.
R:  I --
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  I don't like any of 'em, except --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- Big Brother.
L:  Big Brother?  Interesting?
R:  Yeah, Big --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Big Brother is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my big thing because I'm the mother figure.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I -- you know, I've had so many kids in and out of our house that Big Brother is good for me.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  So, I even ra- --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- ran a Big Brother chat board, um, when Big Brother was going on.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, um --
L:  That's interesting.
R:  But the other reality shows --
L:  Mm.
R:  But, see, I'm -- I'm not man enough for, like, the Amazon or --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or all of that.  I -- I, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm just not, you know, a -- a tough enough person to do that.
L:  Yeah.  And I enjoy it not so much for the personalities, or the clashes of personalities, but I'd -- really like the scenery, and -- and I like the -- the physical aspect of that.  Seeing how people cope in that --
R:  That's --
L:  -- kind of --
R:  -- interest- --
L:  -- an environment.  That's -- that's --
R:  That's --
L:  -- why I --
R:  -- interes- --
L:  -- like it.  That's why I didn't like Big Brother, because it was too much of just the personalities and --
R:  Well, and see --
L:  -- that didn't --
R:  -- that's interesting --
L:  -- interest me.
R:  -- because --
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  -- wh- when I have watched, um, Amazon --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that -- that's one of the reasons I watched it, was for the scenery and that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the wide open spaces, because --
L:  You --
R:  -- now --
L:  -- mean Survivor, yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because now that -- now that I'm getting older --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if I were going to do one, it would not be Big Brother.  Um, it would be one of the Amazon type things because I would love to see the -- the different environments.
L:  Oh, so you gonna apply, you think?
R:  Oh no -- no.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They wouldn't accept me.  I have a DUI, so they would never accept me.
L:  You think so?
R:  [MN]
L:  Ooh, I don't know.
R:  But -- no.
L:  People have had worse than that banana.
R:  Well, I know.  But -- but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- see, 'cause they -- they've gotten beat up so much because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, the first few rounds of every reality show --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they had, like, a slasher and a rapist, and --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- a DUI, and all that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I couldn't even begin to apply for one of those shows 'cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I would be up front with them, but I figure being up front with them, they wouldn't accept me.
L:  Probably not.  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.    
R:  So -- but then, they get these people that slip through [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [LAUGH] that -- that bring 'em up in the headlines.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Well, I thought about applying, but I don't -- I -- I doubt that I will.  However, if I ever did -- what gets me -- I think the first thing I would do is learn how to fish.  I can't believe all these people go out there and they don't have the -- a clue on how to fish.  And, you know -- and -- and most of the s- -- ah, the areas that they're in that's the way they're gonna survive, as far as getting food 
R:  Well -- but, remember when you do apply -- okay?  Remember --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- when you do apply that some of the older people like us --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- who have -- who have applied --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, that's what the younger people have against them.  So --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- if you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- know how to do that, that's great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, don't -- don't shine off to them.
L:  No -- no.  But, I mean, before I went there I think I would try to learn some survival skills.
R:  Well, I would hope --
L:  These people --
R:  -- that everybody --
L:  -- seem to have none.
R:  -- anybody that applied --
L:  They don't prepare.
R:  -- should have those skills.
L:  Yeah.  But, you see -- people couldn't make a fire, they can't fish, they can't build shelter.  It, like, "God, what are they thinking?"  You know?
R:  Well, they're in midtown Manhattan, so what are they --
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  -- gonna do? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  So, um, that -- that's the only one though that you -- you liked, was Big Brother?
R:  No, it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the only one I liked.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's the only one I related to at the time.
L:  I see.
R:  You know?  And now I'm thoroughly -- well, not thoroughly -- you know, you always feel responsible for your kids.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, they're getting at that point in their college education that I can start thinking about myself.  You know, because they're getting good scholarships and they're getting internships --
L:  Are they all --
R:  -- and -- 
L:  -- in college now?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  The final one started in January, so [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I've got one at UCLA, and another one going there next, ah, fall.  So --
R:  Really?  I have --
L:  -- we'll have a --
R:  -- two at UC- --
L:  -- empty nest here.  Yeah.
R:  I have two at UCI.
L:  Oh, yeah -- yeah.
R:  So -- so, I'm -- I'm finally just kind of, like, "Okay, let's get her through the dorms and it's gonna be all right". [LAUGH]  
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] So, you know, then -- once that's taken care of, then I figure -- then, you know, they feel they have, ah, responsibility in their education, you know.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  So, that'll help --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- me a lot.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, and you have more time to watch reality shows, right?
R:  Well no, I -- you know, I have -- I have my recorder, so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You know, I always have that available.  And I'm --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on the internet twenty four seven basically.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  But I'm amazed so many people watch the -- again, going back to the dating ones and stuff --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- me, that is so fabricated.  And, you know, the girls, the guys, they don't have any --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- intent to do anything long term.  It's just to be glorified, or to make a name for themselves, or just to be -- put themselves in the public's eye or something, you know.  But, I just can't believe people get so wrapped up in that stuff.
R:  You're talking, like, the Joe Millionaire thing?
L:  The which one?
R:  That Joe Millionaire or whatever --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- it is.
L:  -- that one.  Or The Bachelor, or the series --
R:  And see, that's the ones that kind of frighten me --
L:  -- where the --
R:  -- because --
L:  -- inlaws, or whatever that one is, or something.  I mean, they're crazy.
R:  Yeah.  Meet The Parents.
L:  Mhm, yeah, Meet The Parents.
R:  That's getting a little, um, "Come on!" 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Again, it's just all put on for the camera, you know.  It's just, ah -- 
R:  Well, it has to be, I would --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- think.
L:  Right.  Soon as the -- the cameras rolling, you know, they're gonna act a certain way, and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.  People wanna --
R:  So --
L:  -- put themselves on display like that -- oh okay, I guess, but I'm not gonna watch it.
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  Doesn't --
R:  -- I'm not --
L:  -- interest me.
R:  -- gonna put my kids through it, and I'm not gonna --
L:  No.
R:  -- be a part of it.
L:  No.  Yeah.
R:  So -- but I think that's great for them if that's what they wanna do -- go ahead on. 
L:  I did that --
R:  But --
L:  -- actually, I did that once, but my wife will probably say, you know, "You'll never do it again".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  We were --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we were on, ah, Sixty Minutes -- not Sixty Minutes -- ah, Forty Eight Hours.  They followed us when we went to Las Vegas about eight -- nine years ago.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  Yeah.  We were, like, the first five minutes of the show was -- the whole thing was on gambling, you know.  And I --
R:  Oh, God.  Did that suck?
L:  Yeah.  Well, they -- the way they edit things, you know, it kind of makes you look bad.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  And they said it was gonna be a soft piece, and they were just gonna show a family in Las Vegas.  And then -- then they interviewed me and they started asking me all these really hard questions about why you're bringing you --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- children --
R:  -- no.
L:  -- here and stuff.  So, they really put me on the spot, but --
R:  And your kids were there?
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  It was a whole thing.  They --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- followed us around.
R:  -- that sucks.  Those assholes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] That sucks.
L:  [MN] Yeah -- yeah.  But it came out all right, I guess, you know.  But I just, in a way, wasn't prepared for her questioning and, again, they --
R:  No, and --
L:  -- can --
R:  -- say things that --
L:  -- make the edit -- 
R:  -- slip on you.
L:  Yeah.  They -- that's exactly what happened.  Yeah, and -- and then the editing, you know, they can also change things any way they want.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Make it look --
R:  They put --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, here, there and everywhere.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  So --
R:  Well, I'm sorry --
L:  -- that was --
R:  -- to hear --
L:  -- my only --
R:  -- that.
L:  I'd -- I'd forgotten that.  But that was -- that is reality TV in a way too.  And it's interesting to watch, you know, how they do it and how they follow you around, and how they have the -- you know, a whole crew with the camera and the mike, and the, ah, reporter, and her producer, all following you.  And, you know, it's -- it's, ah, a set up in a way.  And a lot of it, of course, never gets on the air too.  They -- they record so much of it --
R:  Oh yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  They --
R:  Like, ni- -- 
L:  They followed --
R:  What is --
L:  -- us for --
R:  -- it?
L:  -- hours.
R:  Ninety percent?
L:  Yeah.  They followed us for hours and -- and they only put on about five minutes of it.  So, yeah, that's why I say they can make, you know -- make you look any way they want you --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- to.
R:  -- exactly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Well, it looks like we're -- we're pretty close to ten minutes.  I been watching the clock here.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I wonder if they're ever gonna listen, or what they were trying to do with all this, or why they're doing this study.
R:  Um --
L:  Seems like an expensive --
R:  From what I understand, they're -- they're --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- to create some new dolls that'll have, um, voices that will all pretty much match any American, um, dialect. 
L:  You're kidding me?  That's what this is about?
R:  Yeah, ba- --
L:  'Cause it's a university.  That's why I don't understand.
R:  Well, they take our voices and they study it. 
L:  Mm.
R:  And then they --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- merge it all, and then they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- create dialects that are understandable across the board.
L:  Oh, okay, I guess. [LAUGH] 
R:  So -- which is okay with me.
L:  Yeah --
