L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  I'm --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- Regan. [MN]
R:  I'm Tom.
L:  Hi.  Well, this is my first call so ...
R:  Me too.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] Well --
R:  This is kinda strange.
L:  -- I don't know what we're su- -- what?
R:  Different, huh?
L:  Yeah, it is ten bucks a call so ...
R:  Yeah.  So ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, so what's the topic?  Should arms -- uh, disarmament be important in Iraq?
L:  Yeah.  Well, do you want to go --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- first or ...?
R:  Why don't you go first?
L:  Um, well, I don't know.  I don't really agree with the war.  I don't think it should be our biggest concern.  I think we should deal with our problems rather than spending the money everywhere else but we do need to help out [NOISE] the people that -- in Iraq -- the Iraqis, I guess.  So, it's kind of a catch twenty two.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I guess there's a lot of issues there but I guess that what they're asking about is should arm -- uh, disarmament be a big issue --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for us?
L:  Okay.
R:  I mean, aren't they already disarmed?
L:  Yeah.  That's what I was wondering.  They're disarmed. [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Aren't they [inaudible] already?  How can they -- how can you disarm 'em?
L:  What?
R:  How can you disarm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- them if they're already beat in there?  Their military's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in a shambles and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hm.
L:  Well, maybe this is a question from like a few weeks ago that hasn't been changed, or something too.
R:  Well, maybe we could just approach it like if the war had never -- if the war --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- hadn't started.
L:  Uh-huh.  Okay.
R:  Well, what do you think about that?
L:  Mm.  Well, the think is they never actually found anything there, did they?  So, I didn't think -- in the beginning I thought if they found something, yeah, and they gotta go look but they never actually found anything and then again of course Iraq's going to have all these bombs and stuff if they know we're gonna try and come kill 'em all.
R:  [MN]
L:  I mean, were they supposed to go, "Oh, okay, well, we're not gonna make any bombs".  So, I kinda don't agree with it.
R:  Yeah, I didn't think that they should go in there and take away their weapons.  It just seems that's --
L:  Of course every cou- --
R:  -- not our business.
L:  Yeah.  Every country wants to have weapons. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  And everyone should have weapons.  How can you --
L:  Mhm.  We have like -- in America we have like eight hundred -- my friend works on nuclear [NOISE].  And he's like on nuclear attack and we have like over eight hundred nukes sitting around and we're not supposed to have 'em.
R:  Why not?
L:  Oh, well, we're not supposed to have that many 'cause after, um, whatever UN agreement everyone was supposed to disarm, I think, we're not supposed to have 'em sitting there and then we don't -- I f- -- I don't know what it -- I don't know the whole thing but it's after some agreement we made to just like get rid of a bunch of 'em and we got rid --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of some but then we hid a bunch that we had.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And at this point it's kind of like, "Whatever.  We know everyone does so no one cares".
R:  Right.
L:  But technically we weren't supposed to have all those. [NOISE]  So, if we're gonna -- but, I mean, we should keep 'em in case someone tries to attack us.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So [LAUGH] --
R:  Hm.
L:  But I --
R:  So, is this --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- study to -- to see our linguistic patterns or something like that?
L:  I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then there's different phones so I was wondering if it's -- if we talk differently on a speaker phone or, you know, compared to a regular phone.
R:  I bet they track like the vocabulary and who speaks for how long and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that sort of thing and put it -- or write it all down.  Doesn't matter what you talk about.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  It doesn't [LAUGH] -- [NOISE] where do you live?
R:  I live in California.  Los Angeles.
L:  Oh, do you.  Is this the California -- I'm in California too.
R:  Huh.  Cool.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, you gotta kid back there.
L:  Yeah.  I'm feeding him.  He's six months.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  That's a handful.
L:  Yeah.  It's a good --
R:  What --
L:  -- age.  He's getting -- he's a lot more independent [NOISE] and stuff.
R:  That's great.  It's so exciting to seem them growing up like that.
L:  Yeah.  He's growing fast.
R:  I got a lot of brothers and sisters so --
L:  Do you?  How old are you?
R:  I'm, uh, forty two.
L:  Are you? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  So, we just had a family reunion in New Orleans and there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was a bunch of smaller kids there.
L:  [NOISE] Really?
R:  And they are just so cute.
L:  Yeah.  This is my first so ...
R:  Really?
L:  Yes.
R:  How do you like being a mom?
L:  [NOISE] I like it. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  It's [NOISE] good.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's a lot of work.
R:  Yeah.  I would think.
L:  Especially he was very, very colicky and screamed a whole lot in the beginning.
R:  Hm.
L:  So that was quite fun. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Now he's eating peas.
R:  Hm.
L:  So [NOISE] [LAUGH] I don't know what else we're supposed to talk about.
R:  I guess it doesn't really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- matter, you know.  Oh --
L:  Yeah.  Are you from New Orleans?  Is that where --
R:  My mom is.  Came from St Louis.
L:  Really?
R:  We kind of grew up in St Louis.
L:  Did you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm out here trying to get in the movie industry.
L:  Are ya?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Cool.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Going back to Iraq for a second --
L:  [NOISE] Okay.  Sorry, is he too loud?
R:  Oh, no, no, no.
L:  Okay.
R:  I'll take [inaudible]
L:  Well, you start with Iraq.  What do --
R:  I always -- I thought that they were -- there's, uh, other countries that are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in violation of UN initiatives or --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  And they -- they're not ge- getting come down on.  I think it's like they just wanted to click a policeman who --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they have different things they can charge you with if they wanna like hassle you, you know.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  I thought that was just the situation they wanted to just get down on Iraq for some reason.
L:  [NOISE] You know, in [MN] [NOISE] -- yeah, and it -- it just kind of seems like, you know, we should worry about our own problems and I understand wanting to get Saddam and it just seemed like Bush is finishing up what his dad did and it didn't [NOISE] seem really like we should [NOISE] risk the lives of our own people for this and just like -- it's more like, "Yeah, we're big and powerful so we're gonna kick all your butts, just --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- because we can and to show off".
R:  Yeah.  That's what I thought too.
L:  And if -- I mean, if the UN and everyone else is against us we should kinda not go against them.  We should use that support because we're not gonna be a superpower for ever.
R:  Yeah.  I totally agree with that.
L:  No country is.
R:  Yeah.  That was --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the big mistake I thought is -- it's -- it's o- other countries go in and just kinda beat up on these other countries but when the whole -- when the UN is against it I don't think we should have gone in there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That was a big mistake.  Like, didn't they go into Panama and, uh, depose Noriega?
L:  I think so.
R:  Back in the eighties.
L:  Yeah.
R:  At some point.  They just went in there and just attacked him and just took all of his -- kill all of his soldiers and put him out of power just like that.
L:  Yeah, and just -- it's just -- we just do these things because we can, not because it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the right thing to do or whatever and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, they're better off without Saddam and without that whole regime but, then again, now no one has any water or power and then --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's our power companies, our water companies, our clean up companies going in there so we're making money for our country which is kinda -- it makes us look bad.  We're like, "Look what we did.  We saved all these people and now all our companies are going to get millions of dollars from fixing 'em up".
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  So, it makes us look really, really self serving.
R:  I mean, we might have gotten Saddam out of there but now that there's so much bad will in -- over the whole world against the United States.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think we're just gonna pay the price for that eventually.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  We're better off being friendly.  And then things like where France is against us so like we're not calling fries French fries any more.  That's just stupid.
R:  That's just so dumb.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's just -- you know what I mean, to me it's like a kind of a mob mentality.
L:  Mhm.
R:  After a certain point, whoever's kind of shouting loudest and the simplest idea people just go along with it.  And if --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you disagree then you're like a problem and a troublemaker.
L:  That's true.
R:  And they should be able to disagree with what we wanna do and not have --
L:  Well, that's what our whole country's based on is like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a freedom of speech and having your opinions and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then we're like -- and the whole thing if you're not with us and you're against us, well, so what if you're against us.  It's your right.
R:  That's right.
L:  And it's like an American to have your own opinions.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  It's really sad.  Do you like Bush at all?
L:  No.
R:  Did you vote for him?
L:  Um, yeah, but I was --
R:  [MN] Ooh.
L:  -- like nineteen -- well, it was that or -- and at the time -- I don't know why I really did but --
R:  Yeah.  I didn't --
L:  I don't know.  I'm looking at -- I mean, I'm not republican and I'm not -- but I'm not real liberal either and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was just like he seemed lesser of the two evils at the time --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the other guy, which had Blake Anders- --
R:  Gore.
L:  Yeah, Gore.  [inaudible] he just seemed so stupid to me.  He just seemed like a Bill Clinton --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- where he could -- he just didn't know what he was doing.  But then Bush, Bush has never left the country --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- in like his life he's never gone anywhere outside the US which that's a --
R:  For real?
L:  Yeah.  And I lived in Europe for a year and that really changes things a lot and gives you a whole new perspective --
R:  Agree.
L:  -- on the world and it's just like never having done that now it kinda makes me think, you know, g- -- the guy's kinda closed in.  I -- I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  I think he's a -- he's just a stupid man.  That's all there is to it. [SIGH]
L:  Mhm.  He won't get reelected though.
R:  I hope not.  But look how popular he is for this --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- whole thing.
L:  Well, war, presidents always get popular whenever there's a war.
R:  Hey, well that's how people get elected though too.
L:  That's true.
R:  It's just a -- the majority of people out there that are not too -- not looking into it and they're not interested in democracy and those kind of things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They will vote for him. [SIGH] Just hope he's -- who -- who can the democrats put up against him though, do you know what I mean?
L:  That's true.  Yeah, there really ... Who'd they have -- like, they were talking -- I was watching something where they were talking about like possible candidates.  I can't remember but no one was -- it was all people you've never really heard of, never did much.
R:  Hm.
L:  At least, you know, Bush has done something maybe good or bad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But people know him, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, like, you know, if you look at a ballot and you don't know who the other guy is, really never heard much about him and you -- you know and you think Bush is okay.
R:  So, do you think he was okay though?
L:  But -- not really, no.  I don't like -- well, the war thing -- and -- and if you look at the promises he made and everything he said and what he actually did like they contradict each other.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I was watching -- it was something on Comedy Central or one of those shows, and they had --
R:  [LAUGH] Comedy Central!
L:  Well, they had Bush.  They had him --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- when he was running and everything he was saying and it was like Bush against Bush and it was pre-elected Bush and elected Bush and the things --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- he's saying were total opposite.  He could like fight against himself with the comments he was making.
R:  Hm.
L:  And it was real weird to watch it because it was totally him going like, "I would not do this" and then him, "We're gonna do this".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Once he got elected he just completely changed everything he said and --
R:  Don't they always do that though?
L:  Mm.  Yeah.  I don't know.
R:  I think that's -- once they get into office and they have all these advisers that have been in Washington a long time and they tell 'em all these things and they realize how far off they were.  Before they get to --
