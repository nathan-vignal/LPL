R:  Oh, so am I?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Where abouts?
L:  Uh, Manhattan, Mid Town.
R:  Sorry?
L:  Manhattan.
R:  Okay.  Same here. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] Where -- where are you at?  In Mid Town?
R:  No.  Morningside Heights.
L:  Where?
R:  Morningside Heights.
L:  Lincoln Heights.  Yeah.  I know where.  I'm in Mid Town. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah.  I'm near Lakes and Center[?]. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I used to live like five blocks away from there.
L:  Right.  Yes.  It's a cool area.  You're right on a mix.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  You work there or you live there?
L:  I live here.
R:  Cool [LAUGH].  How did you hear of this thing?
L:  What?
R:  How did you hear of this thing?
L:  You didn't hear anything?
R:  No.  How did you hear of the study?
L:  Oh, you know what, man, I -- I grabbed a, um, um, [inaudible] out of the mail box the other day.
R:  Oh, I see.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I hear ya.
L:  And it was on the second page.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  And my curiosity killed me.
R:  I see.  Cool.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay.  So, we have to talk about Iraq, I guess.
L:  All right.
R:  What's your take on it?
L:  Well, I think -- I think that, um, yeah, it i- -- it i- -- it's important for the United States to unarm 'em but that's only because of what -- what happened, you know.
R:  What happened?
L:  You know, we went over there and, you know, we had war over there.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And now, you know, I don't -- I don't think this is the end.
R:  Mhm.  Do --
L:  I think --
R:  -- you think there should have been a war in the first place?
L:  N- -- uh, no.
R:  No.  Me neither.
L:  No.  Uh, you kn- -- you know, my thing is, man, I'm -- I'm trying to figure out until -- just because the United States is so powerful, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Who are they to say what any other country's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not supposed to have or have.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  You know what I mean?  They -- ain't nobody telling 'em what to have.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The United States do what they wanna do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, uh, you know, nothing against my country or anything but, you know, power is power though. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I hear ya.  [NOISE] I don't -- I don't think they should be responsible for disarming to be completely honest.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think, uh, in order for it to be fair and also for it to be, um, I guess, reliable in the eyes of the international community --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it should be run by a -- a multi lateral organisation.
L:  Why -- yeah.  And then --
R:  You know.
L:  And then when they try to put our own officials in there.
R:  Sorry?
L:  They try and, um, um, put our own people in there to run a country.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's fucked up. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't think -- I don't think that's going to go over too well.
R:  No.  No kidding.  No kidding.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah [MN].
R:  But, uh, who knows.  Yeah.  I actually saw y- -- um, I was reading -- I saw a picture of, um -- remember the, um -- the statue that came down?
L:  Oh --
R:  Right?  You remember the -- they filmed it and everything.  It was all over the news.  You know, they pulled the Saddam statue down a few weeks ago.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  Right.  I -- and, um, I was reading -- I saw a photo of the square --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but taken from very high up --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in the sky as opposed to right close to the statue.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And basically there was no one there. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm not kidding.  Basically [LAUGH] --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- it was a bunch of -- it was a -- it was a small number of, uh, dissenting Iraqis at the time --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and all the cameras were zoomed in on them. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  So, I don't know how much -- I mean, it's impossible to tell at this point whether the Iraqis didn't want us there in the first place.
L:  Well -- well, some of them, see, I -- he was doing some bad things to his peo- -- to his people.
R:  I agree.  I agree.  He was doing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- horrible stuff.  But the -- I mean, I don't -- it's not clear whether they hate Saddam more than they hate us or vice versa.
L:  Right.  Right.  Y- --
R:  And I don't think anybody can tell at this point.  I mean, the media's obviously been lying to us.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  So, that's not a reliable source.
L:  [COUGH] Right.
R:  So, the next thing to do is to go and ask the Iraqis but obviously we can't do that either since we're not --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's kinda hard to know what to think.
L:  Yeah.  And would -- do you know what man?  You know, just like a lot of people live here in fear are now worried about, you know, chemical warfare and all that type of stuff, man?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know, man, the -- you know, the best -- I'm not even going to stress myself with it, man.  I'm just going to do everything I've been doing before the war and --
R:  Yeah.  No kidding.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Otherwise they've won.
L:  Right.  Right.  Exactly, man.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Cool.
L:  People are scared, man.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  People are scared and -- and our government's taking advantage of that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Don't you agree?
L:  What do you think of the president?
R:  Well, I don't know.  You should be asking me what I think of his advisors. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  But, well, I don't know.  He never -- he never -- he's --'cause he's worse than his father.
R:  Sorry?
L:  He's worse than his father.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Bush.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess maybe, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  I don't know what to think.  I think I underestimated him though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He definitely is smarter a politician than I thought he was.
L:  Oh, he knows what he wants to do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He knows what he's doing.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And even -- he -- he -- he handles his business.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] He knows how to change that and then the [inaudible] he says, "Oh, look.  This is what we're gonna do".
R:  Yeah.
L:  Blah, blah.
R:  Yeah.  No kidding.
L:  No Marxist type of -- of -- of -- of president --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- he's a fundamentalist, what he wants.
L:  [inaudible], you know.
R:  Yeah.  Are you religious?
L:  Um, I -- I follow -- I -- I'm Muslim.
R:  You're Muslim.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.  But --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm -- well, you know what they say, it's no different but I'm American Muslim.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] You know, um, I -- I believe in the teachings of the Koran.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And -- and nothing else.  I -- I -- you know what I mean?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  As far as -- far as the other Muslims are concerned, you understand what I'm saying?
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I hear you.
L:  You ever read the Koran?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Actually, I have.
L:  And --
R:  Yeah.  And I -- it's been completely misunderstood here, I think.
L:  Well -- oh, okay.  Great.  So --
R:  Would you agree?  I mean, I read -- I read all the sections that had to do with Jihad --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it has absolutely nothing to do with Fox -- with what Fox News is telling us it is. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, no.  Just like we haven't -- the -- the, um -- the -- the Muslims doing the suicide and all that stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's not -- it's not -- especially the women.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You hear about the woman, the pregnant woman?
R:  Mhm.
L:  That -- that got out of the car and started [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And she's not going -- she's not going to the afterlife.
R:  No.  No kidding.
L:  'Cause she's -- not --
R:  It's a fundamentalist interpretation.
L:  Right.  Right.  And it's been twisted.
R:  Yeah.  Absolutely.  And of course that's what they show us when -- on the media.  They tell us, "Okay, this is what -- this is what, you know, Muslims are like" you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "They're bloody.  They wanna kill themselves in suicide bombs.  Why? Because the Koran tells them to".
L:  Right.  A- and --
R:  But obviously the people who are saying that have never read the Koran.
L:  Right.  Well --
R:  I mean, if anything, the Jihad is a wonderful thing, in my opinion.  It's -- I understood it kind of as a -- a personal struggle --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to become a better individual.  I don't know if I'm --
L:  Right.
R:  -- misinterpreting.  I mean, I'm technically Jewish so I may not [LAUGH] -- you know, I may be reading --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it completely wrong.
L:  Oh --
R:  But I kind of thought as -- as just a, you know, a means for self perfection --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that was --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- not necessarily violent.  It was --
L:  Right.  And --
R:  -- really --
L:  And -- and I'm not -- you see a -- a true Muslim as opposed to the -- the, um -- as opposed to, um -- what's the word I'm looking for?  B- before the situation gets to go out of hand we've gotta diffuse it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  By all means necessary and then if you can't diffuse it, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but you're not supposed to draw first blood.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  Know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH] And -- and as for me I'm, hey, you know -- I could walk away without -- without raising my hands or anything like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because I just put it in God's hands.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen.
R:  Yeah.  I hear you.
L:  N- no matter what.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I don't know.  You know --
R:  Yeah [inaudible].
L:  I wasn't born Muslim though.
R:  Really.
L:  No, I wasn't.
R:  Hm.  Where were you born?
L:  I was born in Phil- -- Pennsylvania.  Well, in Philly but I lived in Pen- Pennsylvania.
R:  I see.  Cool.
L:  Yeah.  I been in New York eleven years.
R:  Nice.  Nice.
L:  I'm ready to get out of here [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Really?  Why?
L:  Well, I'm -- I'm forty two years old, you see what I'm saying?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, uh, you know, I can deal with the riffraff but remember I grew up in the suburbs.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I'm -- I'm used to having more of a peace of mind and like risking -- I can't live in Mr Rogers' type of neighborhood, you know.
R:  [LAUGH] I hear you. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible], you know, I miss -- I miss cutting grass.  I miss all that stuff, man.
R:  Yeah.  I hear ya.
L:  I used to hate cutting grass, man. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] When your dad made you do it [LAUGH] on the weekend.
L:  Oh, man, [MN] -- and we used to have a garden in the yard and I used to hate this thing.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And believe it or not man I miss all that stuff 'cause we gr- -- man, I used to go out in the gar- -- go out in the garden and get tomatoes and all that stuff.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, man.  Jesus!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] and I used to g- go out -- go to sleep out in the -- we could go to sleep with our doors open at night, man.
R:  Yeah.  I know.  Can't do that.
L:  No.
R:  Although you should, um -- you should go to City Island.
L:  City Island?
R:  Yeah.  They leave their --
L:  It's --
R:  -- doors unlocked there.
L:  It -- it's so expensive there though.
R:  Oh, really.  I have a friend who's living there and she's cheap.
L:  How much -- what do they pay her, like?
R:  Way less than Manhattan, I'll tell you that.
L:  Yeah, but where I live it is expensive but my wife's been here all her life.
R:  Oh, I see.  So, she's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- got like a low rent controlled apartment or something?
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  I get ya.  Is she ready to move out too?
L:  Huh?
R:  Is she ready to move out too?
L:  Well, eventually, yeah.  We -- we -- we -- we're working on trying to get out of here by -- by, um, two thousand and five.
R:  Yeah.  I hear ya.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where are you planning on --
L:  Each year -- each year we put a year off.  Two thousand and four goes to two thousand and five.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I hear ya.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you know where you wanna go?
L:  Huh?
R:  Do you know where you wanna go?
L:  Uh, we -- we're moving towards -- we're thinking about Rhode Island.
