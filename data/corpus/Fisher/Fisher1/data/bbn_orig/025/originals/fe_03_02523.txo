L:  Hello.
R:  Hey.
L:  Hi.  My name is --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- Monica.
R:  Hi, I'm Marcos.  Um, well, [MN] watch a little bit of American Idol.
L:  Okay.  
R:  Yeah.  I think it's [several inaudible words] just so interesting.  I like the singing right, but I like to see who's going to win.
L:  Right.  Well I don't watch any of those shows.  [LAUGH]
R:  You don't watch any of those shows?
L:  I don't watch any of 'em, no.  I just hear -- hear abo- -- hear about 'em word of mouth.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm not sure, you know, where they are or what they do.  I've seen one, and I forget the name of the program, but it's where they eat bugs and different [LAUGH] stuff like that.
R:  Oh, Fear Factor.
L:  Fear Factor, that's the one.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I watched that maybe once and -- and I didn't care for it at all.
R:  They're [several inaudible words] unrealistic.  I mean I -- I watched, um, [inaudible] people who, sort of, know about that and know about communications and about casting [several inaudible words].
L:  Right.
R:  [several inaudible words] realities sometimes involved in a reality show.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  What happens are you really in a situation where you have to eat bugs?  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, yeah, really.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I guess if you know the right kind of bugs to eat, but, no.  I mean, just for somebody to give you something and not really tell you what it is until after you've eaten it.  [LAUGH]  I couldn't go for that.
R:  Well, I'm sure -- I'm sure they're -- they're safe to eat, you know.
L:  [MN]  Well, I hope so.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I'm sure they're pretty safe to eat.
L:  Right.  'Cause once I saw something -- I think it was, oh man, I think it was like the, um, sex organ of a pig or something like that.  It was -- it wasn't good.  But the person ate it.
R:  I know they have to eat, like, tongue and they -- they did have some stuff on MTV that was like more of a contest.
L:  Right.
R:  They had to make, like, margaritas out of, um, bull testicles and stuff --
L:  Okay.
R: -- like that.  Yeah.  
L:  Right.  Well, that's -- that's not my thing.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]  It's -- it's pretty gross.
L:  Right.  Right.  
R:  Um.  Survivor, I think, [several inaudible words] Survivor.  I think Survivor was -- the first one was interesting.  Just because it was the first one of it's kind.
L:  Right.  Right.  I kind of --
R:  You know.
L:  -- kept up with it a little bit but not much.
R:  I think I tuned in once.  And I -- actually -- actually more on a website than [inaudible] actually watching the show.
L:  Okay.  Okay.
R:  Because, um, there was a -- a link with my email or something, like the banner.
L:  Right.  Right. 
R:  So I took a look at it.
L:  Okay.
R:  But [MN] some reality shows I think are interesting.  [COUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm trying -- like, uh, they mention, uh, Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire.  That was kind of interesting.  But I --
R:  The first one, right?
L:  Right.  
R:  The first --
L:  The very --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- first one.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  With, uh, I think her name was Darva Conya[?] or something like that.  And --
R:  She got married and then, like, divorced him, didn't she?
L:  Right.  Within a week or something.  Yeah, that was pretty interesting.  I kind of watched that one.
R:  Well, not many have, uh, more like production ones.  [inaudible].
L:  Like what?  I'm sorry I can't hear you.
R:  Uh, can you hold [MN] -- hold on a second?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE]  Um.  It's, uh, what was I saying?  Oh, the ones they have now.
L:  Right.
R:  Are more about dating than about, like --
L:  Right.  Joe Millionaire --
R:  Like Who Wants --
L:  -- or something.  
R:  Like they have The Bachelor and they have Joe Millionaire.  
L:  Right.  
R:  It's not so much at the end of the show somebody gets married.
L:  Right.
R:  I think -- I think with the first one they really -- they really, uh, just turned off about that, you know.
L:  Okay.  Well, let me ask you, um, what about the show -- I think it's a new show called Cheaters where they catch people cheating on their spouses or girlfriends or boyfriends.
R:  Oh, that's like -- that's like Cops, right?
L:  Right.
R:  They take out private investigators and then they go find the unfaithful people.
L:  Right.  Have you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- watched that at all?
R:  [MN]  Yeah, I've seen -- I've seen a couple of episodes of that but I didn't watch the -- I used to watch Blind Date, kind of, frequently.
L:  Okay.
R:  'Cause -- and I loved it when the dates went terrible.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause then they would make fun of it so [several inaudible words].
L:  Right.  Right.  And then --
R:  But the Cheaters wasn't funny at all.
L:  Right.  Well, I -- I never watched that [LAUGH] either but I've seen it.  That -- now that would be something that I might be interested in but I never really watched it and then --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- uh, there's another one I wanted to ask you about.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I think it's called the Real World, like, on MTV.
R:  Real World and they have Road Rules.  They have -- they have lots of variety to that.
L:  Right.  Now, I don't really get into any of those either but do you, or have you watched any of those series?
R:  Yes.  Yeah.  I think -- I think the one I watched most was Road Rules Australia.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, the one that -- it was really fun about Road Rules Australia.  But no I saw -- I try to see the other ones once in a while.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But that's -- the last one that, um, Real World Las Vegas.  There was, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  There was a lot of -- they slept with each other a lot.
L:  Oh.
R:  More than -- more than -- more than in any other one of the series.  [MN]
L:  Okay.
R:  They were a little extreme and loose with each other.  
L:  Right.
R:  But, uh, that's probably not, um, yeah, that wasn't my favorite reality show.
L:  Right.  Okay.  Yeah, 'cause I mean I -- I know about 'em but I don't really watch 'em because I'm more of a -- I like TV land.  [LAUGH]  You know I like to watch the old shows like Andy Griffiths and Leave it to Beaver and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Do you like any of the --
L:  Not reality.
R:  -- new dramas, like --
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Do you like any dra- -- the new dramas, like CSI or something like that?
L:  I haven't watched any of those but usually, like, the Law and Order type shows I am more interested in.  I found though that they have gotten more graphic.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  And I -- and I'm not -- I don't really care for that too much.
R:  [NOISE]  
L:  There's --
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  -- enough of that already on the news.  
R:  Yeah, I know.  I think ever since The Shield, 'cause The Shield is really -- is a really violent show.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's a new show.  It's on -- it's on cable.
L:  Right.  Right.  I've seen that one.
R:  Yeah.  Which is -- which is a good show but it --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- is much more graphic.
L:  Right.  And like, uh, the Special Victims Unit.  Law and Order Special Victims Unit.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That was a little -- a little more graphic.
R:  And that -- that -- that one's [several inaudible words] in the titles to --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- get to you 'cause Special Victims is like -- it's the children and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- mothers and all of those things that really -- that really, like, pull at your heart strings, you know.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So ...  But, uh, yeah, uh, now there's this new show called Reality TV Wrap Up which is really -- I didn't like it.  It's um, it's actually -- it goes -- there's so many reality TV shows.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They made a rea- -- they made a show that comments --
L:  On --
R:  -- on the --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- happenings.
L:  Right.
R:  Of -- of the week's, um reality TV shows.  Kind of like Soap Opera Digest [several inaudible words].
L:  Right.  Right.  
R:  [NOISE]  They were supposed --
L:  Like ETV news or something?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I think --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I might watch something like that just to get a gist of everything that has gone on.  
R:  Yeah.  And -- the -- really there's so much variety now.
L:  There sure is. 
R:  There's, uh, there's, like, an American Idol country version on USA where it's --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- Nashville, or something there.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've heard of that one. 
R:  Uh.
L:  So ...  Hey, when did you sign up for this study?
R:  Today.
L:  Yeah, me too.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was really surprised at the University of Pennsylvania.  [LAUGH]
R:  I didn't put -- I didn't give them my social security number.  I didn't feel comfortable doing +that.
L:  Well, I did but I mean --
R:  You know, I was referred to it through a friend, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Who works -- who works at UPenn.  It's a UPenn study, right?
L:  Right.  Well I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- was referred to it, I'm not sure if this person goes to UPenn or not or, you know, is affiliated with it.  But somehow she got a hold of this study and so she just passed it on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, so I said --
R: [MN]
L:  -- you know ten bucks to talk for ten minutes.  That's not bad.  [LAUGH]:
R:  No, that's not bad.  I know.  I was -- I was thinking, mm, if I could sit there with the PIN number and I could make, uh, six phone calls an hour, that's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- sixty dollars an hour.  That's --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- that's a really --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's wonderful.  
L:  Yeah, it is.  It's pretty neat.  
R:  You'd, uh --
L:  So, what was your name?
R:  Marcos.  And you're Monica, right?
L:  Right, I'm Monica.  
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Well, it's nice to meet you too.  I don't suppose we'll talk to each other again. They'll probably link you up with a lot of different people.  
R:  Probably.  Probably we won't talk to each other again.
L:  Right.
R:  I think it's about talking to strangers.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  
L:  It's kind of different.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it is different.  I just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just hope I get some -- you know, we get nice people like you --
L:  Right.  Well, I hope --
R:  -- on the phone.
L:  -- I get nice people like you.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Uh --
L:  Yeah, well I heard you speak in a -- a -- a foreign language.  Is that your family or roommate or ...?
R:  Spanish.
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  I was speaking Spanish.
L:  Right.
R:  With my -- with my boyfriend.  [inaudible] my boyfriend.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Okay.  
R:  So ...  In Miami.
L:  In Miami.  I'm in --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- Ohio.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah, [inaudible], Ohio.
R:  [several inaudible words].  That's neat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's not that much else to say about reality TV shows.
L:  No, I don't think so.  [LAUGH]  'Cause I'm not really into what -- you've seen some of it, you know, more than I have.  
R: [NOISE]  Yeah, I -- I actually really come back [several inaudible words]
