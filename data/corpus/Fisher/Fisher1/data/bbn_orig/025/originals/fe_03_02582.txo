L:  Yes, hello.  This is Michael.
R:  Hello, this is Anna.
L:  Hey, Anna.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  Okay.  You wanna begin?
R:  What was the topic again 'cause it -- it didn't quite -- I didn't quite get it?
L:  About whether we should, uh, disarm -- uh, pay great attention to disarming, uh, Iraq and send in, um, uh, inspectors.
R:  Oh, right.  Right.  Okay.  I got it.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, good question.  I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I'm -- I'm pretty much pro, uh, getting in there and, uh, a- at least utilizing our diplomatic abilities in -- in disarming, uh, Iraq if it's at all possible.  At least sending the inspectors back.
R:  Yeah.  That -- the inspector part sounds good.
L:  Yeah, 'cause it -- it would be UN endorsed, although I'm not a big fan of the UN but at least it -- it brings, uh, this, uh, uh, united coalition together and it probably, to some degree I would expect, uh, probably, uh, aggravates[?] the needs of, uh, France and Russia, as if we really care, but still at the same time, you know, it's -- as a -- as a universal body I think we have to --
R:  Mm.
L: -- go to that.  And we still haven't -- you know, as you know, we still haven't found -- found any indication that, uh, Saddam Hussein has had weapons of, again, mass destruction.
R:  This is true.  This is too true.
L:  Yeah.  There's been --
R:  And then you've gotta wonder about everything else too.
L:  Well, that's the question, you know.  I -- I think that one of the problems that we've -- we've had to deal with is how much have we been led down a -- a rosey path here?
R:  [LAUGH] That's a good one.
L:  Because we were led down the same path in Afghanistan and, uh -- and now Afghanistan has their own rule and once again they have the -- the child labor is starting up again --
R:  Oh, lord.
L:  -- women are not, uh, once again allowed in schools.  Women once again are being oppressed in Afghanistan after all that bombing, after all that freedom, there are major regressions taking place in Afghanistan so what was -- what was all --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- why did we lose boys and girls over there?  What was the purpose of this?
R:  Mm. [NOISE]
L:  So, I question that this is going to happen in Iraq and now we've got all the Shiites immolating themselves and flagellating themselves and wanting their own government and, uh, w- what were we there for?  It's never been really made clear other than looking for weapons of mass destruction and if there aren't any what was our president --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- thinking?
R:  What was he thinking?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I have a feeling and almost everybody obviously feels this way -- many people, I should say, feel this way, unless you're really pro right, that he was, um -- he was trying to prove a fact that he was a better man than his dad.  Well, um, I don't know whether that's been proven or not but in the meantime I do think, at least to -- to stick with the topic, I -- I do think we should be going in and I do think we should be working with the UN in trying to find out, uh, if indeed, uh, they do have weapons of mass destruction and this should be a long, ongoing process, as long as we're there.
R:  Yeah.  Th- yeah.  I agree with that.
L:  You know --
R:  Totally.
L:  And I think it should be -- and I think it should be as filmed and as media, um, promulgated as -- as we have the war because behind everybody's back I got the creepy, sneaking suspicion they're gonna plant weapons of mass destruction and say, "Well, see.  They were here".
R:  [LAUGH] Well, if you ever noticed, main stream TV doesn't show all the stuff that, like, oh, Hispanic TV does and, like, um, BBC does 'cause BBC and Hispanic television, the Spanish networks, don't censor and they'll show the training camps and the kids chanting anti war, um -- anti USA stuff and all -- it's just crazy.  I've seen some of the uncut videos.
L:  Oh, I agree with you.  Uh, I -- I watch KCRW which of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- course is, uh, public service --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and they cover both sides --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- actually.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] And then --
L:  I mean, you can see --
R:  -- there's the religious aspect which I don't even wanna get into [MN].
L:  Oh, yeah.  It's -- it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, we don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's -- one side of me says, "Gee, I'm glad we feed those people" and the other side of me says, "Well, now that --
R:  Well, not --
L:  -- they're free --
R:  -- not --
L:  "-- why, you know --"
R:  -- their religion.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's what all the evangelists are coming out and saying that it's, you know, "This is it.  Look out.  Here we go.  We're headed for Armageddon".
L:  That's right.  Yeah.  There's that.  There's also that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, it's -- listen --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we go back for years.  I think it's Nostradamus --
R:  [NOISE] Shh.
L:  -- at the early, uh, thirteenth, fourteenth century --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- said something to the effect that, uh, our problems are going to come from the, uh -- from the mid east.
R:  The east.  From the mid east.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  From the mid east, so --
R:  And that Ch- -- and that they're gonna get together with China and with Korea and just gang up on Israel and basically blow everything up.
L:  Probably, and very much destroy the one democratic nation in the midst of all that -- uh, all the, uh, uh, uh, the theism that's going on.  It's really interesting.  You've got -- you're surrounded by these enormous fundamentalists but at the same time, I'm surprised that -- that we haven't, uh, uh, obviously --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- opposed Syria on some level because most of the people -- see, it was so interesting with, uh, I think it was eleven out of the fifteen -- I don't have --
R:  You know what's really scary and -- and I -- I was -- I was taken aback for a second because it happens to be part of my nationality is Damascus and Syria and when the evangelists came out and said this it -- it just stopped me cold.  He said, "It's in the Old Testament that --"
L:  That --
R:  "-- um, Damascus will become a pile of rubble".
L:  Really.
R:  And I just sat there and I was like, "What? [LAUGH] What do you mean, it's gonna become a pile of rubble?  I don't like --"
L:  Under w- --
R:  "-- the sound of that".
L:  Under what circumstances would it become a pile of rubble?
R:  It's Old Testament scripture.
L:  I see.  I see.
R:  It's like in --
L:  Well ...
R:  Ezekiel or Daniel or one of those.
L:  Well, the only problem and I must be honest with you, since I'm -- I'm -- although religious up to a point --
R:  And he said that is the only prophecy that has not yet been fulfilled.
L:  [MN] Oh, now, where's that said?
R:  [NOISE] All the other --
L:  Where's that written?
R:  -- ones have been fulfilled except for that one.
L:  I wanna know what those other prophecies are because I'm not up on that.
R:  Oh.
L:  That's not an area of expertise.
R:  Na- -- uh, Israel being a nation.
L:  Right.
R:  Planes, trains and automobiles.  The fact that we have nuclear technology.  All that's been fulfilled.
L:  Yeah.  And -- and the next one is Damascus will be ruined?
R:  And the one is -- the big one that has not yet been fulfilled is Damascus will become a rubble.
L:  Now, Damascus is in Syria?
R:  I think so, if I remember my geography coll- -- uh, correctly.
L:  So, if Damascus is in Syria and Syria will be rubble, who will turn Syria into rubble?
R:  I have no clue.  It doesn't go -- go into that.  You know, this is all, um, what is the word?  This is all -- how do you say?  What is that word I'm thinking of?
L:  Conjecture?
R:  [SIGH] Um, imagery, I guess is the word.
L:  Imagery.  Does it say anything about the television show Friends being picked up next year?
R:  [LAUGH] No, no, no.
L:  It's not.  Okay.  All right.  Just -- just because I cover some territory there.  Um, that's really interesting.  Well, I certainly hope that's not the case, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but certainly here to see any -- any nation, uh, go under entirely because I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- always feel that it's not the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people that it's the -- it's the powers that be, the executive powers --
R:  How long? [NOISE] Mm.  Oh, sorry about that.  Go ahead. [NOISE]
L:  That's -- I always think it's the executive powers that need to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to be swept away.  Not the people themselves.
R:  [NOISE] Shh.  Shh.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry again.
L:  What you got there?  What you got? [MN] You got two conversations going.  I always think it's the executive powers that need to be swept away, not the people.  The people often are -- are just --
R:  Right.
L:  -- sort of puppets to the executive power.
R:  Well, the one main thing out of both evangelists that I've been watching is that, you know, it's not the earth that will perish away.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause it's world everlasting. [NOISE]
L:  Then, what --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- will perish?  Just Damascus?
R:  [NOISE] Um, well, Syria will be- -- I'm sorry.  Damascus will become a rubble.
L:  Right.
R:  The church will be raptured in the twinkling of an eye and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then we're in for seven years of hell and damnation, excuse my French.
L:  Hell and damnation.  I've gotta feeling we're already there.
R:  Seven years' worth.
L:  Seven years' worth.  Well --
R:  Because a great dictator will arise out of all this conflict and will sign a seven year peace treaty with Israel which he'll break, like, two and a half years into it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Setting everything into motion.
L:  Interesting.
R:  The seven vials[?], the seven seals, the -- the seven plagues, the whole -- the whole bit.
L:  Do we know when this is gonna happen?
R:  [NOISE] It cannot happen, and every evangelist has said this, before Christ raptures the church.
L:  Well, you see, I'm sixty five.  I hope to heck I'm not around.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I hope to heck it -- maybe -- I hope -- listen, if it happens I hope I'm so gaga I won't know what's happening.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, it -- they said it'll happen -- happen in the twinkling of an eye.  You won't even know.  Y- you know, one second you're here and the next second you're not or you've been left behind.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm not sure I wanna be left behind --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in those circumstances.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, you know, I guess, you know --
R:  But religious overtones aside [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  [NOISE] I don't know if it's good, bad, indifferent. [SIGH] [NOISE]
L:  Now, you're -- you're --
R:  We cannot deny what happened on nine one one but [NOISE], you know, you gotta look at it from both sides of the [NOISE] -- of the --
L:  Of the coin, yeah.
R:  -- of the coin.
L:  Yeah.  Well, see about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- eleven -- eleven or twelve --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of those men that conspired against, uh, the United -- uh, the -- the, uh -- in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- nine one one were from Syria.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it's interesting that he went after Saddam Hussein instead of going after the Syrians.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's interesting.
R:  And where is [NOISE] Osama Bin Laden?
