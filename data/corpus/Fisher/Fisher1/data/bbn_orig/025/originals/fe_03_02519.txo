R:  Hi, this is Martha.
L:  Hi.
R:  Who are you?
L:  Oh, my name is Veronica.
R:  Veronica?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  Do you watch any of those reality shows?
L:  Actually I don't, so it's a little bit difficult for me to have a conversation [LAUGH] about it.
R:  Oh, well.  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, but, um, I only heard about them and, um, you know, I know that they're very popular so, um, [LIPSMACK] -- but I think, um, yeah, I -- to be honest I don't watch television at all.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, what about you?
R:  Um.  [LIPSMACK]  I watched, uh, [MN] Joe Millionaire.  I liked that one.  [MN]  And I watched, um, some of the Survivor, you know.  But -- I watched it, like, one season but I didn't watch -- watch it --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- anymore.  
L:  What do you like about them?
R:  Well, you know, mostly how, uh, how they -- they react in situations.
L:  But do you think that, um -- yeah, I don't know.  Um, I guess, uh, television is not something I can talk about too much.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's a time waster.  
L:  Huh?
R:  It's a time waster.
L:  Yeah.  Uh --
R:  Where -- where are you from?
L:  I'm from Russia.
R:  Oh, Russia.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, right.  I'm in --
L:  But I live, uh, in -- in San Francisco.
R:  Oh, you live in San Francisco, okay.
L:  Yeah.  Where do you live?
R:  Ohio.
L:  Oh, okay.  How did you find out about this fisher thing?
R:  On the internet.
L:  Oh.  So you -- you probably spend +some amount of time there?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I watch it a little and listen to the war more than any- anything else on TV, but it's about over now.  I used to put it on and -- while I was on the computer.  
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, I didn't -- you said you watch what?
R:  The war.
L:  Oh. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know if it's really over.  I think there's, uh, more to come.
R:  Well, that's possible too.
L:  Yeah, I am, um, I sl- -- lived in Israel for about a year and, uh, [LIPSMACK] um, these kind of wars they don't end with the, you know, just military being there.
R:  Mhm.  That's true.
L:  [MN]  Unfortunately.  Yeah, I -- I would say that, uh, [MN] the first concerns in my mind -- the first one is war.  The second one is economies.  I don't even know.  Maybe the first one is economy and the first one is the war.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  How did you find out about this?
L:  Um, a friend of mine from, uh, New York send me an email.  Um, I'm, um, [LIPSMACK] um -- I'm [MN] making documentary film and, um, this, uh, person is also in film, so she just send it to all film people.  
R:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  Um, [MN] maybe we get connected [MN] another time.  I wish, you know -- is there something you want to say about those reality television shows.  I would -- I'd be happy to listen but I just have no idea.
R:  You just don't watch them.  [NOISE]  [LAUGH] 
L:  I just don't watch them because, uh, I think, you know, I saw one and, uh, it was about teenagers and I find it so, I don't know, far removed from reality that, uh, you know, it's all so staged.  I don't know any teenagers like this myself.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I figured that, um, [LIPSMACK] um, that's all I need to know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, we have to talk for ten minutes.
L:  Oh, we do?  [LAUGH]  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, um, we can talk about, uh, your life?
R:  My life?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Well, uh, yeah, that's reality.  [LAUGH]  Well, I've been divorced for a long time and, um, I live by myself now and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  My son just went to Texas.  He met a girl on the internet and they liked each other so that's where he is and ...
L:  Oh, very cool.
R:  And I have a nice big house and a great big yard to take care of and ... [LAUGH] Keeps me busy.
L:  Yeah, sounds like, uh, very busy.  Are you in, uh, Ohio, where?
R:  Youngstown. 
L:  I don't know where -- I don't where it is.
R:  Uh, it's south of Cleveland.
L:  Oh, okay.  I have some family, actually, in Cleveland.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Strangely enough, yeah.  And, um, oh -- [MN] I'm trying to guess, uh, by the sound of your voice about your age, but it's a little hard.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Okay.  
L:  [LAUGH] What -- what sort of, uh, things you do on the internet?
R:  What's that?
L:  What kind of things do you do on the internet?
R:  On the internet?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, my sister and I, uh, joined some programs.  We made some money and we lost some money.  [LAUGH]  [MN]
L:  What type of programs?
R:  Um.  There's one called GMT.  Get Moving Today.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, you, uh, like, buy a product and -- it's like an auto respond.  It's really, you know --
L:  You buy a product and then what?
R:  And -- and then, uh, you start getting money.
L:  Oh, that's not a bad program.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's cycles like, you know, every so many weeks and ...
L:  But, um, I don't understand.  The -- the company pays you for what?
R:  Um.  Well they take your money and invest it.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, uh, when it -- I don't know, it's kind of hard to explain.
L:  But did it -- was it, uh, worth it?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah?
R:  I've got, uh, eleven hundred dollars back already.
L:  That's not bad at all.
R:  Just since, uh, like, November.
L:  That's great.  
R:  Cost me, uh --
L:  And what did you have to -- what did you have to do for this?
R:  Pay six hundred [LAUGH] dollars.
L:  [MN]  I see.  But is it a little bit like a pyramid scheme?
R:  No.  No.  This is not.  
L:  No?
R:  No, this is legit.  
L:  Oh.
