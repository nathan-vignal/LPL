L:  Hi there.  This is Celeste.
R:  Hi, my name is Donna.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I am from California.  Where are you from?
L:  I'm from upstate New York.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Yeah.  [MN]
R:  That's great.  
L:  All over the place.
R:  Yes.  Um ...
L:  So, do you watch the reality shows?
R:  You know the only one I watched was The Bachelorette.  How 'bout you?
L:  The only one that I watched was the first original Survivor. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, really?  And how -- what did you think of that?
L:  I really, kind of, got interested in the first one, but then after that when they came on with a second one, it was like, "Okay, I saw the first one.  It -- I'm not interested anymore".  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the other ones I just don't really -- I haven't gotten into.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  How 'bout -- how 'bout you?
R:  Well, I watched the first, um, program of Survivor and I couldn't stomach the bugs.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  When they -- when they started to eat bugs I said, "this is not for me". 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And so I didn't turn it on again.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  That's funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, see, that's what gets me about some of them.  Uh, its going into shock TV now as opposed to, I think, what the reality shows are.  They're no longer about real people.  It's just to shock the audience, and I think half the people that, um, try out for these shows are wannabe movie stars anyway.
R:  Mm.  And some of them are.  I mean, they -- you know as they, uh, I agree with you in the, uh, that -- just to get reactions from, uh, the people, but I am one that, um, as a rea- -- to live -- to watch someone in a -- in a reality situation.  It -- it -- it doesn't interest me and -- and I guess the reason that The Bachelorette interests me was the hype from the promotions.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And -- but the Survivor, um, [LIPSMACK] I could not get into even though I -- I heard, you know, that -- that there was hype.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] so it is something that I, um, I -- I've just -- even -- the movie stars that have reality shows, I -- I can't -- it does not interest me.
L:  I can't get into those either.  The -- I -- to my mind it's not reality because if you were to put a camera in my house for twenty fours --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you would be pretty bored.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  And I think that they're just manufacturing a lot of it and they're making money.  There's a -- there's an advertiser and they're making money.
R:  Mhm.  Now, I must admit, in the evenings when I am surfing through the channels and, um, I can't recall her name now but she has -- Anna Nicole.  
L:  Oh yes.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]  You know, and -- and I will briefly watch that and shake my head and go [LAUGH], "Go on" you know, because, uh, it -- it seems like -- to me that might --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- may be reality for her but how many, celebrities even, I mean, that's not reality TV.
L:  Right.  Uh, I think that you probably do the same thing that I'm doing.  You -- as you say, you're surfing, something catches your eye.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then it goes from -- from what you [MN] -- what was interesting to the ridiculous.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Or, I think, the, um, [SIGH] oh, the Ozzy, um [LIPSMACK].
R:  The Osbourne's?
L:  Osbourne.  Sometimes I've watched that until it's so much bleeping out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that it's like [LAUGH] you're missing half the sentence because everything is bleeped out.
R:  Mhm.  You're right and I -- I did not -- I don't believe I -- I even saw any of that.  I -- it was very sad, her situation, and I u- understand that the show, you know, when she did, uh, get the cancer that they did not -- I --I don't know if -- if they continued the reality show during that period or not?
L:  They did.  Because they were sometime -- they were -- uh, People magazine, I think, showed -- or some place I was reading -- that she was actually being, uh, somebody was following her while she was in the doctor's office going through some of the therapies and -- and that type of thing.
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  But she's being paid millions to do this?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Not even thousands, millions.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  I guess people will do anything for money.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  That's what it boils down to.
R:  That's true.  And I, um, I -- I don't recall any other reality shows that I have even, um, observed.  I'm, um, trying to think through some of them.  It's either --
L:  Well, I think the original one -- didn't it originally start with MTV?  Wasn't --
R:  That's true.
L:  And --
R:  I remember that now.
L:  And [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I'm just trying to think.  I guess they had a group of people that either lived together or ...
R:  Oh, was it the Big Brother?  Was that one of them?
L:  That -- no, I mean the one on MTV.  How -- I think how the reality started was with MTV where --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- they had people living together and then, yes, you're right, there was a Big -- Big Brother one.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, that wasn't MTV, that was a regular station.
R:  Now I believe that show originated in Britain.  Did it not?
L:  Yes.  Yes.  Uh ...
R:  And I know it was quite popular there.
L:  Who Wants to be a Millionaire, I believe, uh, originated --
R:  Right.
L:  -- over there also.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I -- the -- the reality shows did they -- I -- I think they did originate from Britain and then we -- then they came over here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, and they are proving to be quite popular.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  And, um, so [MN] um, I was -- [MN] I'm interested to know in, um, is it The Bachelorette?  That's what I watched, was The Bachelorette.  The -- not The Bachelor, it was the Bachelorette with the -- I think that was Tristan and Ryan.  Is that right?  Do you remember?
L:  See, I don't -- I don't think I followed that one at all.
R:  And I know that they were, um -- and I just watched it, like, the -- when she was down to the last two.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, to see who she would choose.  And [MN] there, for a while, I guess they were, uh, planning a marriage and so forth but then I -- I just read where they had broken up but that's -- you know, I -- again [SIGH] that -- um, my husband [MN] would not watch anything like that with me. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  That's why you have two TVs.
R:  That's right.  [LAUGH]  I think he was working that night [LAUGH] and so ...
L:  What do you know -- if -- if -- when you're surfing what do you normally watch?  What are you looking for?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  What -- what's your favorite channel?  That type of thing.
R:  Well, you know, I [MN] -- i- in the evenings I, um, I guess my -- I watch Bill O'Riley.  It -- that gives me, um ... uh -- but that's not re- -- but that's not reality TV.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, oh, Everybody Loves Raymond, of course, is my -- is my all time favorite.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  The sitcom.  But as far as reality TV, I, um, and -- and [MN] -- what -- what I watch for is I'm surfing, it just depends on, uh, I -- I -- I like good wholesome entertainment.
L:  Okay.  See what normally -- I usually head right for the sci-fi channel.
R:  Do you really?
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  Yes.  And then I start --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as you say, surfing and then I'll get to the reality [MN] and it -- it doesn't keep my attention, and after a couple of seconds I'm on to another channel --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like -- like looking for something.  And I agree with you.  Everybody r- -- Loves Raymond.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  To me that's -- I consider that a reality show because that sure does mimic life.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, this is true.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's true.  And I -- and I do like it entertaining and, uh, and like -- and it does [MN] sometimes I like a tear jerker if it's, um, you know, a good movie.  Um, but I, um, [LIPSMACK] I also like something that I can learn from.  There are times that, um, I'd like to walk away and -- and just really think about what I've watched.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and reflect on it.  And think, "What have I learned from this?"
L:  You mean like the Discovery Channel and, uh, The Travel Channel --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that type of thing?
R:  Tru- -- that's right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So it's, um -- I -- I think I go in moods, you know, it's the --
L:  I was just gonna say that.  I -- it -- it all depends upon my -- my mood and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- one night I'll be watching this and the next night, you know, something else.  And, uh, the one show that I really hate is the Iron Chef.
R:  Oh, yes.  
L:  And --
R:  I don't watch that.
L:  I don't know what that is classified because that is -- to me it's not a cooking show, it's not [LAUGH] ...
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know what that one is.
R:  Now, I must admit I do get hooked on home and garden television.  And, uh, ideas to -- to decorate the house and, um, and -- and some of the cooking shows as well.
L:  Okay.  Now, is Trading Spaces considered a reality show?  I guess it would be.
R:  Well, you know, that was -- that's true.  
L:  Because I l- -- I enjoy that one.
R:  Uh-huh.  And While You Were Out.
