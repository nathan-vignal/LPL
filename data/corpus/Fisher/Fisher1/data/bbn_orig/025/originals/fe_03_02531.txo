R:  Hi.  I'm Sam.
L:  Hi.  Well hi, Sam.  I'm Nina.  I'm in Brooklyn, New York.  Where are you from?
R:  Brooklyn, New York.
L:  Oh --oh, we're neighbors.  Okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- ah, I live in Brighton Beach.
R:  Um, I live Mill Basin right now.
L:  In where?
R:  Mill Basin.
L:  Is it --
R:  It -- [LAUGH] it's by Kings Plaza.
L:  Mill Basin?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that must be near Kings Plaza?
R:  Yeah.
L:  How nice.
R:  Mm.
L:  That's a beau- -- I tell you, that's a beautiful area, Mill Basin.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.
L:  It's like a little bit of Long Island, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you watch reality TV show?
R:  Ah, no I don't.  I never really -- I'm not a big TV watcher actually.  But no, definitely not reality TV.
L:  Well, I tell you, reality, um, TV -- it's funny they have that name because it really is the furthest thing from reality.  People are put in situations kind of -- for example, I'm not a, ah -- a fanatic.
R:  Right.
L:  But, especially -- I prefer surfing the Internet over TV any time.
R:  Right.
L:  But I will tell you that the, um, Survivors is basically, um -- I forgot how many people are put on there, but I think this -- assuming it's a small group of people, approximately an equal number of men and women.  And they go -- they're put on a deserted island.  And, um, what happens is -- hello?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, you're still there.  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm sorry.  They're put in -- on a deserted island.  And what happens is that the, ah, conditions are very primitive.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, there's snakes, and there's lizards, and it can be scorching sun or -- or, like, torrential downpour.  And, um, [COUGH] then at a certain period of time, they have to vote who they want off.
R:  Okay.
L:  And in the last program it was really, really interesting because -- and remember I -- most of the time I don't watch TV.  I don't even like soap operas.
R:  Right.
L:  But, it tells you about human nature.  I had no idea who was going to be voted off.  And I'll tell you who was voted off.  Nobody famous -- these are ordinary people.  But, the --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- reason is interesting.  The reason is the one who won, who was not -- who -- the last one there, who was never voted off --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- was the one that got the food supply.
R:  Oh.
L:  Now, he didn't work for the program, he was a regular person.  But what he did was he went the extra mile.  He went into the ocean.  He went fishing.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Whereas the other people would just wait for the, um -- would just wait for, um, the, ah -- the -- the people --
R:  The ration?
L:  -- that ran the TV program did ship them food once a week.
R:  Right.
L:  But if you didn't like the food or if it ran out, then you're stuck.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, they -- now, the one that won would not only [LAUGH] -- not only did he -- was he responsible for their survival, ah, more than anyone else, but he was gay.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I don't know what implication that is, but the other people are straight and he was gay.
R:  Right.
L:  It shows that when push comes to shove how everybody's equal.
R:  Right.
L:  Well, what do you, um -- do you ever watch any TV at all?  Like, a documentary?
R:  Um, well, honestly the only programming that I do watch on TV is, um, children's, because I write children's books for a living.  So --
L:  Oh, how wonderful.  I love reading.  That was always my favorite subject in -- in school.
R:  My --
L:  How wonderful.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  When you -- when you write children's books, um, do you also do the artwork, or is there an artist?
R:  Well, I -- sometimes I outsource illustrators, sometimes I'll do it myself. A lot of times the publishing company will match.  So, um, I mean, because I am published I don't have much, ah, input besides, um, you know, what I write.  But when I do, like, my own projects either I'll do it myself or I'll find somebody online -- bring some sort portfolio work or --
L:  You know, I've -- I've always [COUGH] wanted to write.  And I -- I just have one question, which you probably can answer 'cause you've done it already.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The fact is when you write your first book -- no matter what the subject is, but you write your first book -- how do you get it published if you're unknown?
R:  Well, [LAUGH] it's a lot of hard work.  I, ah -- you know, I've been pitching.  I -- I have one book published through a major publishing company, Penguin.  And I've been, um, pitching right now to Scholastic.  And I don't --
L:  Oh, how wonderful.  Did you have to pay for the publishing because -- because you were unknown?  
R:  No.  Well, that's a Vanity Publishing Press --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I don't recommend doing it because you don't get the exposure that you probably deserve.  Ah, basically you just need to keep going.  And I mean, my first book that was published --
L:  How did you -- how did you get Pen- -- did you need an agent to get Penguin interested in you?
R:  Well, I fell into, like, the lap of luck because a boy that I'd gone to school with begin -- began a job as a publish- -- as an illustrator for Penguin.  So, he -- he kind of pushed my book through for me.  You really need to know people.  I mean, do -- you have to do, like, networking or stuff like that, but it's really hard.  It really is.  It's [LAUGH] -- it makes me very sad every day when I have to troop out into the city and -- and sell myself basically.  But, you do what you gotta do to make a living.
L:  But, you've been able to do it without an agent?
R:  Yeah.  I don't have an agent.  And I'm -- I'm twenty one years old and I've been publishing since I was sixteen.  I've never had an --
L:  Oh my God.
R:  Yeah.  So [LAUGH] --
L:  That's -- I think that is --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- really commendable.  You know, I'm -- I'm kind of old fashioned.  I -- I -- I'm -- I'm insecure without a regular paycheck, so I work for civil service.
R:  Right.
L:  But, you know how lucky I am?  I'm not a city worker anymore.  You must've read in the papers what they're doing to city workers.
R:  Well, my father's a city worker, so don't say anything bad.
L:  Well, I used to work for the Police Department as an office worker, but in --
R:  Right.
L:  -- nineteen ninety I changed to the Courts.  The Courts used to be, um, city, now they're state.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I'm a state worker.
R:  Right.
L:  But if I didn't get out I probably would've been laid off.  Is your dad still working?
R:  My dad's a Deputy Commissioner.
L:  He's what?
R:  A Deputy Commissioner --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- of New York, ah, for welfare fraud investigations.
L:  Well, I bet he should be the very last one to go because they desperately need him.
R:  Right.
L:  You know what I do?  I, um -- I'm a Court Assistant in Brooklyn Criminal Court.
R:  Oh, really?  Maybe you can get me out of jury duty. [LAUGH] 
L:  Actually, you wanna know the truth?  That's a special division and that -- and you really have to know someone to work in that division.  It's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- supposed to be, um, the elite. [NOISE] [LIPSMACK]  Ah, what I do is -- I do the, um -- I -- have you ever been on jury duty?
R:  I just got, ah -- I have -- I had to postpone.  I got summoned for the Grand Jury, so I have to serve.  But, I have -- I'm gonna do it in the summer.
L:  Well, I think, you know, you'll get treated very well, 'cause I was on jury duty myself, before I worked for the Courts -- just an ordinary person.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Many times -- I can't promise you, but ninety nine percent of the times you get an extended lunch, and you get paid for that.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, and you -- then they finally let you go home early.  [SIGH] Um, I think if you don't get chosen I believe, if they still do it this way -- 'cause I'm talking about over thirteen years ago -- I believe that they don't keep you more than three to five days.
R:  Well, [MN] the Grand Jury is -- it's mandatory for everybody to serve for two weeks straight.  And if you don't get picked the first time you're called in, then you have to keep going back until you serve.  So --
L:  See, I don't have experience with Grand Juries, so you're telling me something I didn't know.  
R:  Right.
L:  I was just going by -- by Criminal Court.
R:  Right.  No, it's -- it's completely different.  I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I thought that would just have no problem with it, telling them I'm a student.  But, apparently there's no getting out of this.
L:  Oh, no. 
R:  So --
L:  They like students 'cause I met student on the, ah -- when -- when I, ah, was on jury, they -- as far as -- I don't know about getting picked for a ju- -- for actual, ah -- the actual trials, but I can tell you they -- they have no problem with serving people who were students.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  [LAUGH] And -- and I tell you the -- the defense likes it because they think -- see, they make -- the problem is they stereotype.  And the stereotype students in one lump as liberal.
R:  Right.  As liberal, yeah.
L:  I don't think it's necessarily true.
R:  Well, I mean, if you're talking about the nineteen sixties then maybe that would be true.  But --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't [LAUGH] -- I don't think so now.  I mean, I consider myself extremely leftist, but I have plenty of people in my classes that are conservative --
L:  Good.
R:  -- more than I could ever say my grandparents are.  So --
L:  Hm.
R:  Yeah.  I think the times have changed. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I think you're right also.  In fact, I -- I was very surprised when I saw a newspaper article two weeks ago that -- it wasn't -- it was not in this state.  I forgot which state it was, but it was in America that a particular college campus was in support of the troops.
R:  Really?
L:  And I nearly had a heart attack, 'cause I'm in support of the troops too.  And I said, "My God.  You know, usually college students always feel --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- the opposite of how the government feels -- usually".
R:  Well, I can tell you something very amusing that, um, on my college campus we had, um, an apathy protest, which sounds absolutely ridiculous.  But, basically they were marching around screaming, like, "What do we want?  Anything.  When --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- do we want it?"  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "Anytime".  Because, I mean, I -- I can speak, you know.  I'm --I'm gonna be a graduating senior, and really don't think that there is many sent- -- I mean, I go to a local school, but I don't really think that kids my age are getting riled up about politics anymore.  And -- and I say that, and I keep my eye, you know, open.  I near as[?] constantly tuned into what's going on, but I don't that it's such an issue anymore to people my age.
L:  I think you're right.  In fact, I'm fifty one years old and I agree with you, because -- I'm not just saying it to agree.  But, ah, let's face it, in the daily life of a typical American, if there is such a thing, politics doesn't really affect us like they do in third world countries.
R:  No, because --
L:  But --
R:  -- you can -- you can do whatever you want to. 
L:  Exactly.
R:  You can do your daily thing and nothing's really gonna affect you, unless there's bombs flying over your head, which isn't really gonna happen in America.
L:  [LAUGH] You know -- but, um, come to think about it, what your, um -- I'm glad that your father has a very secure job really.  And, ah, with the Courts they -- they can very -- they have in the past laid off -- in the early nineties they have laid off state Court workers.  
R:  Right.
L:  But, it was a kind of a thing where they were laid off for two or three months.  However, even though they weren't getting paid, their health insurance continued, which is very --
R:  Well, that's --
L:  -- important.
R:  -- good.  Yeah.
L:  So, in a way that's like a salary, I mean if you have to go to a doctor. [LAUGH]  You know?
R:  Right.
L:  But, they were -- they were taken back after --
R:  I --
L:  -- three months.
R:  I lost my job after September eleventh, and I haven't had good luck with a job ever since.  Like, right now I'm collecting unemployment because -- 
L:  That's not an author, is it?  Writing books, you're talking about?
R:  No -- no.  Writing -- that's not my pr- -- I mean, I would love for that be my profession.  But, I -- I was doing clerical work, you know.
L:  Oh -- oh.
R:  I'm a college student.  I need to --
L:  Was it in the --
R:  -- pay bills.
L:  -- World Trade --
