R:  Hi, there.  Uh, my name's Tim.
L:  Oh, hi, my name is Stephanie.
R:  Stephanie, how you doing?
L:  Hi, good.  How are you?
R:  Good, good.  So --
L:  Um, I'm really not gonna be great at talking about this topic.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I'll -- I'll do the best I can. [LAUGH]
R:  That's all right. [LAUGH] Well, it's -- I think they must have made up that question before, uh, before the war because it seems like a little bit --
L:  Yeah.
R:  What, if anything, should we do about Iraq [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is a little bit, uh -- it's happened.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- honestly, I was -- I was really following it in the -- in the beginning --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I mean, I haven't personally really heard as much -- many, like, updates and stuff on what -- I don't really know --
R:  You mean since the war started or ...?
L:  Huh?
R:  You mean since the war started or ...?
L:  Yeah.  I don't really know, like, what the current updates are. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I -- oh, I mean, yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  All I know is that there -- we're there and we're -- we're looking. [LAUGH]
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from, uh -- I'm in Long Beach, California.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  How 'bout yourself?
L:  Um, Los Angeles.
R:  All right.
L:  California, yeah.
R:  I -- I wonder if they did that on purpose?  That's interesting.
L:  Um, I've done this before.  I got somebody in another state, so who knows?
R:  Oh, okay.  So, I guess --
L:  This -- I guess this is random, but [LAUGH] ...
R:  Can I -- can I ask you if -- just as a -- were you for the war or against it or ...?
L:  Um, I -- I -- I, uh -- I --
R:  I mean, I'm not -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You can answer however you want.  I'm never going to meet you [inaudible].
L:  I -- no, I know.  I mean, I'd rather, uh, let -- have there be peace, of course.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But also I -- I feel that whatever needs to get done in order to get things, like, okay --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- needs to be done as well, you know.  What about you? [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I mean, I -- I was -- I was against it.  I -- I marched in the -- in the streets and stuff.
L:  Oh, you -- oh, you did?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Really?
R:  It was great, actually.  It was a really good experience.
L:  Oh.
R:  I mean, it's a little weird now, you know.  It's like [LAUGH] not only did the war not get stopped, it -- it seemed like the war went pretty well for -- for Bush anyway, so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hm.
R:  Anyway, I don't -- they -- they still haven't found any -- any weapons, though, which is sort of interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Kinda sort of waiting to see what'll happen with that because I mean, I don't know.  I wonder if anyone will care if -- you know, if they look for six months and never find anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If -- if people will report it or if, I don't know, if it'll reflect badly on Bush.
L:  Yeah.  I mean --
R:  What do you -- I mean, what do you think?
L:  I, um ... I don't really know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I just -- I'm not -- like, I don't really -- honestly, like, I don't really follow this kind of stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I mean, I did when it -- when, you know, because I know it's, like, really important of what's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of what's going on.  So, I did at the time and in the beginning and I just -- I -- I still can't believe that, like, Saddam Hussein has, like, stunt people or not stunt doubles, [LIPSMACK] regular doubles, like.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  That's funny.
L:  That's really interesting.  I mean ...
R:  Yeah, I think -- yeah, I mean, I actually just thought it's very funny.  Like, cl- -- someone had made this -- like, uh, turned the -- that Eminem song, the -- the real slim shady, into the real Saddam.  Will the real Saddam please stand up?  And they had a -- oh, it was funny.
L:  Oh, they -- I haven't heard that.
R:  They had a little bouncing head doing the karaoke thing.
L:  Oh.
R:  Which is the real Sa- --
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, I think -- I mean, I don't know.  It -- it's gonna become like -- like Osama, you know, another kind of boogey man --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that no one knows where he is and --
L:  Yeah.  I just -- it's just amazing that they seem to get so close but they can't actually capture them.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know?  But then, I mean, I know that even if they do capture them, there's still -- there's that, like, other crazy guy in North Korea or whatever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And there's -- there still could be, you know, new people, you know, that -- that are -- can be just as crazy even if they do capture them --
R:  Yeah, certainly.
L:  --I guess, you know, so who knows?  Um ... but ...
R:  I don't know.  Do -- I mean, do you think -- I -- I -- I've just been like -- I feel like they're just going about it all in the wrong way, you know.  It's like th- --
L:  What do you -- what do you think that, like, they should be doing or ...?
R:  I -- I mean, well, like, I -- I don't know.  Did you hear this -- that Bush made this big speech last night?
L:  No.
R:  Like, saying that the war was over pretty much.  I mean, he doesn't say it was over, but he said that, you know, victory has been secured and so --
L:  Oh, oh.
R:  And, I mean, essentially, but he also kind of like just said that, like, the war on terrorism is not over and -- and, you know, like anything could happen, you know.  We might have to go to war a- again and again and the war has started but, you know, it's like he kind of declared war on -- on [LAUGH] you know, the rest of the world that doesn't agree with us, kind of thing.  It was like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- very, very scary. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I don't know.  I just -- I -- I just think that that's like -- like, I'm sure there's gonna be, you know, an Iraqi, like, suicide attack on Americans before the end of the year.  Like, I'm sure.  It's like --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they -- they -- they're already -- they're already -- like, they're still shooting people in Iraq --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, civilians and stuff.  I mean, it's just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's pretty bad.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  I -- you know, I don't really -- I -- my dad's, uh, really into this --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- this type of stuff and he -- he is for the war actually.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, because he says, "Well, what -- you know, they don't care when they come over here and they do stuff like what's happened, you know, in -- uh, in New York".
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you know, if -- if -- if we need to do some things to get them to realize that we're serious and we're not just gonna be like cowards and not do anything --
R:  But --
L:  -- and just let them do whatever they want --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- here --
R:  I guess what -- the -- the main, like, sort of thing I -- I mean, what -- what do they mean by "them", you know?  It's like I -- I feel like everyone associates this Iraq thing with -- with nine eleven --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But -- but I mean, there were no Iraqis involved, you know.
L:  Y- yeah, it's --
R:  I mean, I think what people are -- I mean, I -- not to, like, say your bad -- your dad's a bad guy --
L:  That's -- that's all right.
R:  -- 'cause Bush does the exact same thing.  But, like, I think when people say "them" or, like, you know, that Iraq is about nine eleven, they're just talking about Arabs, and I can't -- I can't see that as anything but racism, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, I -- I'm not -- I -- that -- that's just like my interpretation of it but --
L:  No, that's okay.  That's okay.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I -- like, you know --
L:  I think my dad just means, like, in general with anybody who does --
R:  Like, anyone in the world?
L:  -- things to us, yeah.
R:  But -- but Iraq never did anything to us, you know.
L:  I don't know if there was some -- something else that had -- that had happened where there was some other -- like, another war or something like that.  I don't remember what --
R:  I mean, there was the first Gulf War, but that was again, like, us attacking them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I just -- I -- I think that that -- like, what really pissed me off about the whole thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- was that it felt like to me that Bush was, like, lying to people again and again.  Like, really serious lies --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about, like, what Iraq had as far as, like, weapons.
L:  Really?
R:  And that -- yeah.
R:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, they -- I mean, because they kept saying -- like, they brought up -- they kept bringing things to the UN that, like, proved to be forgeries.  Like, they -- they brought this, um, document that -- that they'd intercepted from Nigeria --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that said that Iraq was working on nuclear weapons.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they gave it to the UN and, like, within two hours the UN had, like, proved it was a forgery.
L:  Mhm.
R:  There was another -- there was another thing where they, um [LIPSMACK] -- what was it?  They found a -- oh, yeah, they -- they published this thing, like, proving all these chemicals weapons Iraq had that turned out to be this, like, fifteen year old, like, college term paper that someone had written.
L:  Oh.
R:  They just, like, plagiarized it.
L:  Oh.
R:  This is -- and this is, like, our government, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I -- I was, like, pissed off about that.  And then -- and then they kept saying, like, that Saddam was tied to Al Qaeda and it was just not true.  Like --
L:  Oh.
R:  Like Al Qaeda kept saying -- like, Al Qaeda, like, hates Saddam.  Like, they're -- they're, like, totally different, like, um, [LIPSMACK] kind of views of things 'cause Saddam was totally, like, secular, like not -- not relig- --
L:  You do know a lot more about all this stuff than I do. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I've been -- I've been, like, kind of a news addict for the last, like, year or so.
L:  Oh, you -- uh, how -- how old are you, if you don't mind my asking?
R:  Uh, twenty six.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  Uh, I'm twenty three.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Kind of -- are you in college?
L:  Um, no.
R:  Okay.
L:  No.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  I don't --
R:  I don't know.  I've -- I just -- and this is, like, you know, my hobby [LAUGH] really.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Not a hobby, it's a duty as a citizen, I guess.
L:  Yeah.  I know.  I mean, once -- once in a while, I mean, I will tune into the news, but I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  News, for me, it just, like, so -- it makes me paranoid.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, my dad, though, he --
R:  Oh, it's really -- the more you read the more kind of crazy it makes you, I think, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  My dad, though, I mean, I know if there's important -- my dad he watches, he's excited about the news, like, every night.  "Gotta watch the ten o'clock news.  Gotta watch the eleven o'clock news".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And he'll watch the news and, you know, but I don't know.
R:  That -- that's actually something that's -- I mean, I -- I was, like, so angry with all this, you know, it s- seemed like ever -- there are these, like, basic untruths to me.  I don't know.  It just seemed like there are these really, like, untrue things that kept happening, so I was like, "Why aren't people -- why -- why are people continually convinced by this?"  And I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't have a television.  I went -- I went to, like, visit my sister at one point and we watched a lot of TV and I think it really is like the -- the big media companies just were, like, pushing it, you know.  Every time they thought they'd found a weapon of mass destruction, like, during the war --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they'd, like -- there'd be this huge news story, da da da --
L:  It --
R:  What are these things?
L:  Right.
R:  Every time -- like, within a day they'd -- they'd find out it was wrong.  It was, like, Aspirin or something like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But they wouldn't report that.  So, it's like, I -- I mean --
L:  Oh.
R:  I mean, I think that -- don't you think that's kind of like biased?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I know --
L:  I -- I agree.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, a lot of, you know -- I don't know.  I mean, I think that's -- I mean, most of the people in this country supported the war and I -- that's -- I kinda think that's why.  It's just they've -- they haven't gotten really accurate information.
L:  Yeah.  You're prob- --
R:  I don't know.
L:  I -- I think you're right.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think if more people could know a lot -- a lot of these things that, yeah, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] But --
R:  [SIGH] Who knows?  Well, we'll see what happens next, I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's gonna be interesting, uh, interesting year probably --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Till the next elections.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know.  I bet -- I mean, I -- I -- I hope, like, things work out for the Iraqis, you know what I mean?  S- Saddam was definitely, like, a bad dude, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, yeah, hopefully they'll be better off just having had a few thousand of their people killed and, uh, uh, however many Sam- Saddam would have killed and -- [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.  Mhm.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you vote?  Are you gonna vote in the next election?
L:  Oh, I'm not a registered voter.
R:  Oh, you should register, by God.
L:  Uh, yeah.
R:  You should register.
L:  Yeah.  I -- what are -- what -- what are you as a registered voter?
R:  I mean, I -- I'm, you know, I -- I, like, voted green in the last election, but I'm not --
L:  Oh.
R:  I just think -- I think we need more people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, involved.
L:  No, I know I should register.  I know.  I know I should.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, not -- not, you know, like, I'm not telling you [LAUGH] you should vote one or the other, but it's just like [SIGH] I don't know.  It seems like it just --
