R:  Hi, this is Marlin Martinez.
L:  Hi, this is Wanda Banks.
R:  Okay, um, so what do you think about this whole, uh, Iraq disarming situation?
L:  Oh, my, oh, my. [LAUGH] I really -- I think they should be disarmed.
R:  [MN] Yeah. Um, [LIPSMACK] I think so, too, because as long as they're armed and as long as their government is corrupt and as long as they keep doing the things they do, they are a threat not just to us, but their surrounding countries. [MN]
L:  Yes, and it saddens me all the boys and girls -- of the boys that died over there.  I call them boys. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Do you have any, uh, any family in the military?
L:  No, my husband retired from the military. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  And so, I know, and my godson is right there. [LAUGH]
R:  Really?  Well, I'm -- I'm in my twenties so, uh, the army recruiters just kept calling me and calling me [LAUGH] all the time because they need people over there. [SIGH] But, uh, I'm too busy with school, so just didn't wanna go.
L:  You going to college?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I did many, many years ago, Penn State. [NOISE]
R:  Really?  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Cool.
L:  Yeah.  And I just -- I don't know.  They -- it just -- they -- I think they should be disarmed and get -- and just bring peace to this world.  This worries me.  I was concerned that they were gonna call my husband back.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I was a mess. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they didn't [NOISE].  I'm glad it's over, but they need to disarm them.  And the other day, the grenade they threw to the soldiers and eight soldiers that live by Fort Bragg, they got hurt.
R:  Wow.
L:  They think it was -- it was children --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- over there in Iraq that threw the grenade.  And, uh, eight soldiers got hurt.  Uh, it -- it's just awful.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Do you think, uh, Saddam Hussein will be found?
L:  He's hiding somewhere.  I --
R:  That's what I believe so, too.
L:  He's not dead.  He had his plan already and he did all those recordings early.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, he's got a way of manipulating -- he's got a history of manipulating people and the media and I'm sure he's still doing it now. [MN] Um, you know, by way of, uh, hiding his identity or, you know, or his whereabouts.
L:  Yeah, he's very charming with the media.  He did great with Dan Rather and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- made people believe that he was wow, this is a good guy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But the things you hear he has done and the things they have in film, it's just devastating.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It just -- oh, it's horrible.  I want them to get rid of all the arms and bring all the soldiers home.
R:  Mm.
L:  Home.  I was in the air force ROTC a long time ago and I just gave the money back and didn't join because I just [MN] don't like it.  Instead, I'm -- became a stay at home mother. [SIGH]
R:  Hm.
L:  Let's see.  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from LA, Los Angeles.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I'm gonna figure Martinez, LA or -- or Texas. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Where are you calling me from?
L:  Uh, North Carolina.
R:  North Carolina.
L:  But I have an accent.  You probably said, "Ooh, that accent". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm originally from Puerto Rico.
R:  Puerto Rico, right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah, I've been in LA many times.
R:  Yeah, do you like it up -- do you like it down here?
L:  It's okay. [LAUGH]
R:  It's okay. [LAUGH]
L:  There are too many people. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it -- it is very crowded and the traffic is the worst.
L:  Yeah, I used to go over there when I was in college all the time because I do have family that live in Palmdale and Little Rock and that area, but no more.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No, they're still there but I don't -- I don't go.  Anyhow, let's go back to the subject, which is the arms. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, I --
R:  Is this your --
L:  They need to --
R:  Is this your --
L:  Yes?
R:  Is this your first call or your second call or ...?
L:  Uh, my third call.
R:  Really?  Yes --
L:  My friends got me into this. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I had a friend get me into this, too. [LAUGH]
L:  She said, "You need to do it.  It's only ten bucks.  It's ten bucks for ten minutes".  I said, "Okay".
R:  Yeah, that's pretty good. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Yes.  Yes, indeed.  Uh, disarming, disarming.  Yeah, they need to get rid of everything and they -- they need to -- they need to inspect all those caves that they have not done so because they're paranoid that they have m- -- might have mines and all of those things.  Did you know that?
R:  Right. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, it -- it's just horrible.
R:  Huh.
L:  They showed the hospital on TV with little kids playing outside and getting hurt because the mines.  And not the mines that the, uh, uh, US put down, these are the ones the Iraqis have put down before the Gulf War.
R:  Right.
L:  And now the kids are playing in that area, they're getting hurt.  Oh, it's devastating seeing that.  Let's see, what else? [LAUGH] [PAUSE] Hello?
R:  Yes, I'm still here.
L:  Mr. Martinez? [LAUGH]
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Are you taking any classes regarding to politics or war or history or anything like that?
R:  Um, yeah, in college I did take my core classes, but we never really even went into, you know, all the deep end, you know, discussing topics like this.  Um, just basically general stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, but I, [LIPSMACK] um, yeah, I am against dis- disarming, uh, any foreign nation that is a -- a threat to the United States.
L:  Right.
R:  It doesn't matter who or where they're from.  It doesn't matter.  As long as it -- it's a threat, you know, it should be, you know, eradicated.
L:  Yeah, the problem is is they start but they never finish.
R:  Right.
L:  They need to finish the job and get rid of all the weapons of -- I don't know if they have mass destruction because I haven't seen any at all, so I have no idea if they have any or anything like that because I have not seen any evidence on TV, but that's all.  I only watch the news once a day but --
R:  Well, I'm -- I'm a big conspiracy theorist [LAUGH] and I believe that the media is, uh, is really just telling us one thing when the truth is another thing.  Do you -- you -- what do you think about that?
L:  Uh, well, what I like is they're having the media with the troops in Iraq.  Why?  Because they will now say it immediately, "Oh, this was a friendly fire".  They would have said, "Oh, we don't know yet".  The government will cover it up.
R:  Right.
L:  But having the media there, that made a difference of us knowing the facts in that situation.  But otherwise, no, the media, they -- they say what they wanna say and they -- I don't know, the way they describe the news, it's so ... oh, so much jolly[?] --
R:  It -- it -- it's mis- --
L:  -- instead of just say give me the facts.  Misleading, you're correct.
R:  It's misleading, right.
L:  Uh, just give me the facts and that's all I need to know.  But they start speculating and, no, I don't like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I like to know the facts and that's it.
R:  Yeah, 'cause it's -- it's in the best interests of the media to project the vision that the United States is winning the war, you know what I mean, that we're -- we're doing our job, we're winning this war, and we're gonna bring the boys back home, you know.  That's -- that's the image they have to project, um, on -- on TV, on the news or whatever.  You know, they -- they don't show you, you know, the babies being killed.  They don't show you, you know, the hospitals being burned.  They don't show you all the -- all the bad things that happen, you know?  Only visions of, you know, of soldiers winning the war and, you know, etcetera, stuff like that.  That's what I think.
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  You know, they're not -- they're not gi- -- they're not giving us the whole truth because it does -- does not benefit us.  It doesn't -- doesn't benefit the American public.
L:  Yeah, but after Vietnam, you don't remember that, you probably weren't even born. [LAUGH]
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  That's all they were showing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That they were showing only the sad things, and we know the soldiers doing their job and it was a war that was never finished.
R:  Right.
L:  But that's another --
R:  That's another issue. [LAUGH]
L:  That's another issue.  I don't wanna get into it because it annoys me.  My husband was there, too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, man.
L:  So, all on the Gulf War and all of that, so it -- it's just horrible.
R:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] Hm. [NOISE]
L:  On a Friday and you're home and you're young?  Oh, my goodness gracious.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I, uh --
R:  But --
L:  Yes?
R:  It -- it's only three thirty here.
L:  Oh, that's right, that's right.  I forgot, three hours --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- difference, yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  Couple more hours. [LAUGH]
R:  Couple more hours, yeah, hit the nightlife. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I did that, but I still have little kids 'cause I waited.
R:  Hm.
L:  But my son, my son loves to talk about the war and politics and, uh, foreign policy issues.  And he's young but he loves -- he -- he absolutely loves that.
R:  Hm.
L:  And he reads about it and it's very interesting, and I said, "Son, enough discussion.  We are home, we're happy, so let it be".
R:  Great.
L:  But we also have to think about all those parents right now that are worried sick about their children being there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Doesn't matter how old --
