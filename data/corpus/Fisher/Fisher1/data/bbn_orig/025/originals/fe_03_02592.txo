R:  Hi.  My name's Zoe.
L:  Hi.  I'm sorry, what's your name?
R:  Zoe.
L:  [NOISE] Kerry?
R:  Zoe.  Z.O.E. [MN]
L:  Zoe, life.
R:  Yeah.  What's your name?
L:  Vivica[?].  Sorry, also means life.
R:  Oh, that's cool. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, yeah, no, you're my -- the second Zoe I t- -- I've talked to today.  I just couldn't hear you.  My phone [inaudible] --
R:  Oh.
L:  Um [NOISE] so, uh, I guess this is my first call --
R:  [MN] Yeah, this one's my second one so --
L:  Okay.  Well, it's my second but my boyfriend took the first one but he just talked about, um, things that irritate him in the street so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, I don't -- let's see.  What should the US -- what do you think the US should do about Iraq?
R:  Um, well, personally I don't think they really should have gone in to begin with for the war.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think that at the time being, I mean, there's other issues that they should have taken care of like North Korea and things and there's much bigger threats to the US than Iraq which really hadn't done anything that I can see that, I mean, is really outstanding --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to the US directly that would make them go in and do the war.
L:  No.  In fact, I -- we were just talking today about -- somebody just asked us today -- a friend of mine who's I think from Australia and he said, "What happened in that whole Afghanistan thing?  I thought you guys were --"
R:  [MN]
L:  "-- pissed off with Afghanistan".  And we all went --
R:  Exactly.
L:  "Um, oh, I guess we got distracted because it was harder to make up little slogans about Afghanistan and they didn't rhyme so maybe --"
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  "-- um, we decided to go for Iraq instead but, um, we're not really sure what they -- what they did or why".
R:  Yeah.
L:  My other line's ringing but I'm not gonna get it.  It's on my cellphone 'cause I can't do that.
R:  All right.
L:  So, that's okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, is that you? [NOISE] [SIGH] I thought it was him just trying to piss me off.
R:  All right.
L:  Uh, sorry.  Okay.
R:  Um, well, let me see --
L:  Yeah, so, I am not a big -- I mean, I guess I'm not as completely isolationist as I used to be in the sense that I do think there are things that countries can do either that threaten the US or that are bad in and of themselves --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like the tortures in -- in Burundi or the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia that like might be a legitimate reason for us to get involved but, um, I didn't know of anything like that happening in Iraq and, um, having one attack on our country which was not sent by --
R:  Not even directly related --
L:  -- the government --
R:  -- to --
L:  -- of Iraq.
R:  It's not even --
L:  Sorry?
R: -- like related to Saddam Hussein directly though.  That, I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  The things have nothing in common.  It's just -- it's ridiculous, in my opinion, yeah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that we even went in the first place but I guess they did and technically the people are free for [LAUGH] now.  I mean who knows how many of Saddam's lea- leaders are still around and everything, and his followers.  I mean, you're gonna have to deal with that in years to come.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And from what I know the US doesn't plan on sticking around very long.  You know, help support, you know, what's going on.  Maybe in a couple of years or two but it's gonna take a lot longer than that to make sure everything's okay.
L:  I mean, yeah.  If -- if [NOISE] -- you have to build a government [NOISE] and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's a challenge and, um, some of our ideas of what that are might not be necessarily what other people want.  It's not really up to us to impose it on them.
R:  Yeah.  I'm curious on what they -- what's gonna happen.  Like if the UN's going to restrict the, uh, United States at all since UN didn't give, um, permission or anything for going in on the war with it like that.  I mean, the laws are built that way for the little people.  And once the big man goes out and, you know, goes against it then what's gonna happen sort of thing? [LAUGH]
L:  It probably -- yeah, I don't know what'll happen.  The U- -- I think the UN is -- like, my sort of vague impression is that the UN is better than the US at the, um, aftermath building and helping out and providing aid and that the US will probably just go straight for another war somewhere else.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, like attacking Syria or, um -- yeah, I don't know what happened with Afghanistan and Osama Bin Laden.  That's all been kind of like forgotten.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and then they didn't even find any chemical weapons.  I mean, this whole thing was about how we were trying to find they were breaking treaties and building chemical weapons and there's been no evidence of that whatsoever so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, again it's like this big distraction where, um, the whole thing turns out to have been misguided. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um ... yeah. [MN]
R:  Yeah. [MN] I remember earlier before they actually went into the war though, they had, um, all those pictures and everything and proof of them building, you know, like the bomb areas and the missile launchers and everything.  Those pictures could have been of anything.  They could have been a Walmart built in, you know, like Oklahoma or something, you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, it's just --
L:  Yeah, I don't actually know like what chemical weapon plants look like.
R:  Yeah. [MN]
L:  'Cause I've never really been in one myself.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  It just -- [SIGH] it's just so ridiculous [MN] talking about the whole war thing.  I mean, I -- yeah, I -- I've learned quite a bit about it.  I mean, I've participated in all kinds of peace rallies and marches and things and -- where I'm from.
L:  Where are you?
R:  I'm in Seattle.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  Where are you?
L:  I'm in New York.
R:  Oh. [MN] The last person I talked to was in New York also.
L:  Huh.
R:  But, um, yeah, I -- so, I -- I mean, I learned quite a bit about it which was pretty good.  Um, kinda forget -- forgetting what I was going at.
L:  Oh, sorry.
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hm.  Hm. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I haven't been as -- I've been in kind of a media vacuum.  I just -- I was, um -- I was away from home for a few months and in some other places like the last place I was I -- I didn't have any TV and -- but even when I'm home I just don't really follow very well and I don't follow anything.  Like, I have sort of ideas but I don't stay up to date.  Like, I m- missed a plane 'cause I didn't know it was daylight savings time and I'm just kind of in my own world a lot --
R:  Mhm. [MN]
L:  Um, but it's like I check in and then -- I check in and then it's like, oh, well, Bush is saying that there's a threat and that if you don't disclose a chemical weapon, you know, and then the next thing it's like, "Well that didn't happen" It's like it just keeps never falling -- never happening, what he's saying.  And my mum goes to lots of the peace rallies and I found it very -- a lot of people I know do -- I found it very discouraging that Bush said that he didn't believe in liste- -- that it would be irresponsible for him to listen to what the people wanted because the people don't know what's best for them.
R:  Yeah.  I agree.  I thought that was ridiculous.  What's best for democracy is [MN] -- what the people aren't voting for and it's -- yeah.  Mm.
L:  Yeah, I think that should, you know, pretty much be up to us.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and that he's supposed to represent what we want and he's clearly not doing that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but [NOISE] I don't know.  I mean, it's true that I don't follow [NOISE] -- I'm not as informed, I hope, as [NOISE] the president.  I mean, I hope he knows [NOISE] more but, um, he hasn't put a very good [NOISE] argument forward [NOISE] for what he's doing yet [NOISE] so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  So [NOISE] I don't know. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't -- yeah, mm.  I wonder if there's any -- like, going to be any, uh, smaller attacks or anything on -- on America --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with things like anthrax or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- small things going round --
L:  SARS. [NOISE]
R:  -- that -- that way.
L:  Um, I don't know [NOISE].  I do think -- I don't think that the measures that, um, the US is taking to stop terrorism are really [NOISE] remotely relevant to what would happen.  Like I think that stuff on [NOISE] airplanes is ridiculous and not helpful. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [NOISE] but I don't think that [NOISE], um -- but I do think we do a lot of things that piss people off and that that would [NOISE] be a more likely target and it also seems to me like, um -- here, you -- you pick one. [NOISE] Um, um, it seems that -- I lost my train of thought too.
R:  [MN]
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah, that people who are like, "Well, you know, now just because we're going to war maybe there'll be another terrorist attack" [NOISE] and I'm going, "Well, I don't really understand [NOISE] what the difference between --" [NOISE] this one?  Okay, thanks -- [NOISE] "I don't really understand what the difference between our bombing [NOISE] them being a war and [NOISE] their bombing us being [NOISE] terrorism is". [NOISE] Like --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- it seems like -- it seems like it's okay as long as it's [NOISE] not on our -- you can come in here and let him lie down.  Um, as long as it's -- as long as it's not in America.  Then if it's in America then it's, uh, terrorism.
R:  Exactly.  What did poor innocent America do to get that? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Mm.  Especially considering like -- [MN] I know the naval base like are right -- it's over from where I live, um, there -- oh, there's so many bombs and things there.  I mean, there's probably more just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in that one spot than the rest of the world has planted everywhere else.  It's -- it's just ridiculous.  And the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- amounts of anthrax we have and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just the amount of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- chemical warfare --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that we could cause on the whole world i- it's just -- it's chaos.
L:  Wow! [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know.  I -- I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- curious like if anything's gonna happen in the future --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like what day exactly the end of the world is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- gonna come down to.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, who's gonna fire off what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- first.  If somebody fires off some huge chemical warfare --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's probably just gonna spread to the rest of the world and allies will go in with one another and maybe that'll --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- be it.
L:  Well,
R:  I don't know if -- I don't know if anyone's that crazy that would want --
L:  I don't know.  I mean, I was more worried about that in the seventies when everybody talked about nuclear warfare and it was the superpowers in the US and Russia at the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- time and those were like big weapons with big fall out.  I mean, chemical warfare is sort of the opposite --
