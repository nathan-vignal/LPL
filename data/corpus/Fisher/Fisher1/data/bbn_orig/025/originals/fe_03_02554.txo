L:  Hello.
R:  Ah, hello.  My name is Tim.
L:  Ah, my name is Richard.  I'm calling from Seattle.
R:  Seattle, Washington?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm down in, um, California, by San Francisco.
L:  Oh, cool. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, it took me a while to get on, so I was kind of -- I wasn't r- ready.  But, I -- I heard what it was -- reality shows? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Their question is, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- which ones do you watch, if any?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Why do watch 'em?  And why do you think they are so popular?  I'm sorry, I forgot your name again.  Richard?
L:  Richard.
R:  Richard, from Seattle.
L:  From Seattle, yes.  Um, [SIGH] I don't watch them very often.  I have friends that watch them.  I think they're dumb and unhealthy and, um, appeal to the basis of, ah -- the basest instincts of human beings. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I have friends who love 'em and watch 'em faithfully.  I mean, like Joe Millionaire to name one, and Survivor.  I've watched those a couple of times.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I just, you know -- and they seem to be -- like, the participants are definitely people who don't suffer from self esteem -- low self esteem, I don't think.  They wouldn't need their fifteen minutes of fame this way. [NOISE]  So, I'm just very down on reality type shows. [NOISE]
R:  Um, me personally, I've --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and this it to be this honest, I've never seen one.  You know, I -- I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- hear people talk about 'em.
L:  Yeah.
R:  First of all, I don't watch mu- -- very much television all at.  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, I've never seen one.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I guess at times I've kind of -- just pure -- pure curiosity type thing, like, "Wow, what's --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- all the hubbub about?  Maybe I'd better --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- watch one, just to see what everybody's talking about". 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I do have --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- a lot of frien- -- my girlfriend likes 'em.  My --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- girlfriend likes Survivor.
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, she kind of watches it with her girlfriends.  And --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they all kind of talk about it --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and kind of gossip.  And they -- "Oh, you know, this person's nice. They should keep him.  This person's horrible.  Let's get rid of her.  Or ..."  You know, stuff like that.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Let me -- let me ask you this -- um, you know the concept of, like, a guilty pleasure?  It's like one of those things you're kind of, ah -- kind of [MN] ashamed slashed embarassed to admit that you like.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Did -- was there any sense of that when you watched these shows?  Or was there anything redeeming about it at all?  Or was it just completely one hundred percent garbage, in your opinion?
L:  Well, [NOISE] I don't have a -- just from the first time I saw Survivor and Joe Millionaire, [NOISE] um, I didn't like 'em.  But, obviously I'm in the minority, because they're on because millions of people watch them and like them.  And I think the friends that I have that watch them faithfully have kind of boring lives.
R:  Mm.
L:  And so, I think for them that's kind of living life vicariously.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, through other people's adventures, and other people's excitement, [NOISE] which is valid.  You know, there's a place, um -- it's just, um, watching women who, ah, if this -- if everybody knew this guy were truly a construction worker and made two thousand a month, they wouldn't give him the time of day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's just [SIGH] sad to, you know -- to see [NOISE] how we -- what we admire, you know.  We admire, ah, youth, and we admire perfect bodies, and we admire, um, perfect people.  And I just think it's a -- a sad comment.  Um, my goal is to be a psychologist, so maybe I -- I -- I look more deeply into it than I should.
R:  Mm, no -- no -- no.  Ah -- ah, I don't think y- -- I mean, each person sees it their own way.
L:  Right -- right.
R:  Um, so you think it's this kind of vicarious aspect that makes it -- the shows are -- [MN] we can't dispute it, they're popular.  They are very popular.  
L:  They're --
R:  Do --
L:  -- very popular.
R:  -- you think it's because of this -- this vicarious aspect?
L:  Well, I think with my friend, it's certainly like it -- it -- it's [NOISE] -- it's the vicariousness, because, you know, they have average lives, and have average, ah -- average jobs.  And instead of appreciating what they do have, it's just that -- vicariously enjoying somebody else's excitement and somebody else's fabulous life.  And I suppose, you know, every -- many women dream of having a Joe Millionaire fiance.  I just think it -- it -- it -- I mean, um, you're -- you're right.  [MN] It's on because everybody watches it, but I'm one of the few that doesn't like it. [NOISE]
R:  Um, I once heard they were [MN] -- it was -- I don't know -- like, on a Sixty Minutes type thing, or Twenty Twenty --
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  And the subject was soap operas, not reality TV. 
L:  Okay.
R:  And they were actually talking to people who live -- they were, like, college grad students.  And the college grad student -- yes -- said, "Yeah, I admit I watch General Hospital" or what is it -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I don't know those -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- those shows were called.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the person said to her, "You know, you're -- you're an intelligent young lady, w- why do you watch General Hospital?"  And she said -- and I thought it was a pretty good answer -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  She said, "I have problems in my life --"
L:  Ha.
R:  "-- but then when I see these problems that they have on General Hospital, my problems just become --"
L:  [SIGH]
R:  "-- like, minuscule and -- and, you know --"
L:  [SIGH]
R:  "-- it gives me -- it puts everything into --"
L:  [SIGH]
R:  "-- perspective".  Of course, she's comparing herself to a fantasy -- to a made up thing.
L:  Right.
R:  And --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I think --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- that's kind of why I think, like, a Survivor type show is -- is -- is popular.  I mean, here's somebody's who's worried about their credit card bill and --
L:  Right.
L:  -- then, you know, they can kind of escape that by watching, you know, people having to eat salamanders, or whatever they do on that show.
L:  Right.
R:  Makes their own life -- their own life's problems seem very small and minute and insignificant.
L:  [NOISE] You know -- and of course, we're all drawn to instant gratification.  And, you know, um, you eat all of these termites in fifteen seconds and you win fifty thousand dollars.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know?  And I think there's something to that. [NOISE]  And I think most of us -- most people are average and have average lives.  But, instead of [NOISE] appreciating, ah, what's remarkable in our own lives, you know, we dream of having the perfect [NOISE] woman, or the Joe Millionaire [NOISE] boyfriend.  And, you know, I think that's just human nature [NOISE] to envy what we don't have and don't appreciate what we -- what we do have. [NOISE]  Um, and it --
R:  You know --
L:  I'm sorry, go ahead.
R:  I -- I was just saying you brought up a new aspect that I hadn't thought of about.  You know, before when they talked about reality TV they were -- I had thought Joe Millionaire, I th- -- I had thought Survivor.  But, then there are those show, like Fear Factor, where they do make you eat, like, termites or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- bugs.
L:  Right -- right.
R: You think people get -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- get off on seeing other people going through this kind of m- misery, like ...?
L:  [SIGH] Well --
R:  You think that could contribute to their popularity?  Oh, I mean, "Ugh, look what that person has to do"?
L:  I mean, I've se- -- ah, some of those disgusting things.  Well, again, I think it's, you know, "Look at this person.  They only have to eat, um, as many salamanders as they can and, ah, in thirty seconds they'll have fifty thousand dollars". [NOISE]  I think it's [NOISE] imme- immediate gratification, you know.  And it's easy entertainment.  You know, you've been -- you've been working at, um, KFC all day, you know, as a meat wrapper.  And then yo come home and here are these [NOISE] fantasy lives.  But, they're, you know -- they're interesting and -- and people are becoming wealthy.  And people are marrying [NOISE] handsome millionaires.  And I just think it's -- it's escape to, you know -- it's escape to -- to, um, get away from ones -- the averageness -- the monotony in one's life, which we all have to deal with monotony in our own way.  And I prefer, you know, reading books and meeting interesting people and, ah, other people -- like most of my friends -- enjoy watching all of these TV shows. [NOISE]  And then --
R:  But --
L:  -- they have things to talk about, and they talk about it among their friends. [NOISE]
R:  Here -- here's a -- another thing that I just thought of.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Um, this was several ye- -- probably three years ago, I was talking to this, ah, friend.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And this friend had lived in Japan.
L:  Okay. 
R:  And he described a show on Japanese TV, which was just like Fear Factor, where they make people do all sorts of, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, lie in a pit of snakes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] And I thought, "My God, what are the Japanese people thinking?" you know.  That would never make it here in the US --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and lo and behold, three years later it is.  But, my point being --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if the show really originated in Japan, and I don't have any reason to doubt my friend was telling me the truth.
L:  Right.
R:  It's not just an American --
L:  Good point.
R:  -- phenomenon.  It's --
L:  Good point, yeah.
R:  -- ah, at least in Japan too.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]  That's a good point.  Well, and -- and, again, you know, that's the Japanese culture where having to fit in and having, you know, to [NOISE] -- I just -- just from a limited [NOISE] knowledge I have of that culture -- [MN] a couple of friends -- and, um [NOISE] I just think [NOISE] [SIGH] -- just to remove ourselves from our own lives that we might not think are very exciting.  You know, 'cause you go to the same job every day and you --
R:  Mhm.
