L:  Hi, my name is Pamela.
R:  Hi, this is Sandra.
L:  Okay.  Are we recording now?
R:  I guess so.
L:  Okay.  I don't know much about it.  I mean, I've tried to look on the internet and see what it's all about.  I mean, I hardly read the newspapers.  I don't have time.
R:  [MN] Do you listen to anything o- on TV?
L:  No.
R:  At first I couldn't understand they -- what they were saying.
L:  Okay.  The question --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- was: what if anything do you both think the US should do about Iraq?
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Do you think that disarming Iraq should be a major priority for the US?
R:  Mhm.
L:  All --
R:  Well --
L:  -- I had was that the US -- I know they have a firm policy against trading with Iraq, that the US does -- however, they trade with Baghdad through the United Nations.  It's called the Oil for Food program.
R:  Right and that's where people are getting ripped off --
L:  Right.  And --
R:  -- by the regime.
L:  -- the -- it said on the internet what I was reading that they believe that even Iraq sees Saddam Hussein as a threat to the Middle East because a lot of countries don't wanna trade with them.
R:  Oh, I -- I can understand that [LAUGH].  He was a thief.  But, uh, my thing about it is, if we want these people to be able to sustain themselves, they've gotta do something --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know.  And, uh, as long as we --we're there, I mean, everybody there is armed.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  Almost every household has guns and --
L:  Guns.
R:  -- weapons.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I think there should be a general disarmament.  Not just the, uh, you know, the BAATH party and, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the -- the regime.  But, uh, what's left of 'em, I just feel that, you know, the households shouldn't have all those guns.  They've gotta do something about that but I feel that the people that are gonna be running the country should be in charge of doing that.  I'm just afraid that the new people are gonna do the same thing because that's the only way they -- they know.
L:  How to live, yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's scary.
L:  That's true.
R:  And, uh, I mean, these problems the US is having over there right now with, you know, shooting innocent people --
L:  Yes.
R:  Is because they're being shot at from --
L:  First.
R:  -- where innocent people are at.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, they've gotta shoot back, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or just stand there like sitting ducks.
L:  Oh, my god.
R:  Yeah.  So, I mean, I -- they really have to do a disarmament program or what -- do it while they're there.  I mean, they can't do it after they've gone.
L:  Well, it says they're returning, um, inspectors to look for more weapons that they may have hidden and --
R:  Oh, y- -- they're finding those weapons all over --
L:  And they keep finding more and more and more.
R:  Yeah.  And the thing is even after disarmament, e- even, you know, after we leave --
L:  There's probably more that we didn't find.
R:  I'm worried about children finding 'em.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  And, you know, playing with 'em and --
L:  Right.
R:  Or, you know, like they talk about the mines, the -- the land mines all over the place.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, I know there's another country that has them all over the place where kids are always getting hurt, you know.  I think it's from World War Two.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it scares me.  I mean, I would love to see them become a democracy there.
L:  Right.
R:  And -- but, you know, the country is only as good as the leaders that they, you know, elected, as far as I'm concerned.  Uh, I -- I -- you know, it's up to the people.  Do they want disarmament?
L:  Right.  I don't know.
R:  But there is -- they've lived in such fear for so long they probably don't.
L:  Maybe they don't.  No.
R:  You know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, I -- I feel it should be up to the -- their own country.  I mean, I'm concerned for our -- our boys and -- and girls over there.
L:  Yeah, that they come back.
R:  Yeah.  So, I'd like to see it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but after they're gone who knows what's going to happen and that's scary.
L:  I have no -- I have no idea what they're doing [LAUGH], okay.
R:  Well, who -- you know, who really does?
L:  Right.  I don't think they post everything in the paper.
R:  Of course not.
L:  No.
R:  And I don't think they should 'cause when they [NOISE] do, they're telling them as well.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They aren't just telling the Americans.  They're [NOISE] telling -- telling the protestors and, you know, the bad guys.
L:  Right.
R:  So, and -- not everybody over there is pro USA yet.
L:  Yes.
R:  But I think in years to come they'll look back and see that we've -- you know, we did the best we could.
L:  True.
R:  With -- you know, that is a highly unusual country --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, as far as, uh, the way it's been run for twenty five years.
L:  Yes.
R:  And the way the people have lived.
L:  I never knew they would give oil for food.  That was like something new.
R:  Oh, yeah.  And the thing is where was all of it going?  It was going to the regime.
L:  Yes.
R:  And that is so sad that, uh, they took so much from their own people.
L:  Right.
R:  Well, we're supposed to be talking about disarmament. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh [MN].
R:  I get carried away.
L:  Well, I don't --
R:  Where are you li- -- where do you live?
L:  I'm in New York, Queens.
R:  I'm in California.  Boy, we're stretched out.
L:  Yeah.  I've spoke to a lot of different people on this.
R:  Yeah, it's great.  Yeah, originally --
L:  But some -- the last topic I spoke to was easier but than this is. [MN]
R:  Yeah.  Me too.  I talked -- the last person I talked to was in Hawaii.  That was super.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I love Hawaii.
L:  Oh. [MN]  Well, I think they should make disarming a priority though because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you don't want the little kids to find it and everything when you leave.
R:  Right.  Definitely.  And -- and like I said we want our men and women to come back.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  They're only going to be a lot safer with a lot less people armed over there because you get, you know, some fanatic in with a group of innocent people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- start shooting at, you know -- at us and we shoot back and all they see is that innocent people have gotten shot.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they -- they have always hidden behind innocent people and that's how they play the game, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  They -- they'll -- they'll establish themselves in schools and any place else they can 'cause they figure we aren't gonna shoot and that's always been our -- you know, our way of doing things.  We don't wanna hurt them.
L:  Right.
R:  But I -- I'm glad in a sense that they are shooting back.
L:  Yeah, they should.
R:  You know.  That's why -- I mean, they've just gotta go through buildings and homes and everything and still you're not gonna find them all but, gosh, you're gonna make a good start.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and you can't tell them you're gonna start doing this.  You've just gotta do it.  Widespread, quickly.
L:  Okay.
R:  You know, and it bothers me that they've brought people home, you know, ships home and stuff.  I think they should be there longer.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  As we're -- as we're leaving --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they're feeling braver.
L:  Well, since they were looking back on how they, um -- they provided i- in the -- in the past what they did with the, um -- they said that Iraq never fully complied with their earlier resolutions of security council, that --
R:  Oh, never.
L:  -- they never ignored them.
R:  They've laughed -- I mean, he laughed at us.  He -- he made fun of us.
L:  Right.
R:  Because of, you know [NOISE] the, uh -- the uh -- oh, what do you call it?  The inspectors.
L:  Right.  They probably were paid off. [MN]
R:  He was on --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He'd pushes us far and -- you know, as far as he could and then he'd say, "Okay, you can do this" and they'd go along with it.
L:  But I still say they have to go on site and look.
R:  Yeah.
L:  To see.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Instead of --
R:  And, you know --
L:  -- relying on somebody else.
R:  Can you imagine the State of New York or the State of California wanting to hide something --
L:  Right.
R:  -- no matter how large it was that we would never find it?
L:  Right.  That's true.
R:  You know, and so I -- you know, I still believe they've had all that stuff.  They've hidden it or sent it to another country or whatever.
L:  Well, it said in the article I was reading that, um, you could use like say a facility that was making vaccines could be converted temporarily to do the biological weapons.
R:  That's right.
L:  I --
R:  And one of the --
L:  It's very strange.
R:  Yeah, one of the guys that they caught, uh, stated that they were either destroyed or hidden, just days before --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we got there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then another one will say, "Oh, we never had 'em". [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, because he didn't want to admit his part in it.
L:  That's true.
R:  So -- anyways --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how long are we supposed to talk.  I forgot.
L:  Ten minutes and then they're gonna --
R:  Oh.
L:  They're gonna come on and tell us when it's, uh --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- over.
R:  I can't remember.  It's been a while since I've done one.
L:  I -- I try to do one every day [LAUGH].
R:  [COUGH] Oh, really, I -- you know, I -- I didn't read mine -- you see the first time I did it -- well, I -- the only time I've done this, they, um -- uh, what do you call it?  They -- they told you you would receive a call and the phone rang here.
L:  Right.  But they said -- like, he called.  I was sleeping.  Um, I told him that 'cause he says, "It's not been twenty four hours" but he says, "Try calling in anyway".
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I said that, um, okay, and I called in.  She said, "If it doesn't work then all you gotta --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do is, um, you know, wait twenty four hours and then you can make -- then [inaudible] --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  "-- make the phone call".
R:  'Cause I got an email, finally, and I -- I didn't read it that close.  I just read the first part where it said about checks were slow, you know, getting out.
L:   [MN] What did she tell me?  Uh, two months after the third call you're supposed to get a check.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That you complete.
R:  Anyway, so then, uh, I didn't read any further after that. [LAUGH]
L:  No.  That's all I found out.
R:  Yeah.  And then when I'm --
L:  I mean, while I'm talking to you, I'm looking on the internet for some information but they really -- I mean, like I tell you, I don't -- I'm not into this stuff. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I -- I have been listening to it all -- well, Fox News channel I really -- I really like it.
L:  My father gets into it.  I don't --
R:  I used to listen to CNN but I found it too prejudicial, their --
L:  Right.
R:  -- views, you know.
L:  It's saying that here that, uh -- it says Ir- --
