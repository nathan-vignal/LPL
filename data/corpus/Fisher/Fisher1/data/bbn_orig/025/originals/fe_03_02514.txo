L:  Hello, my name's Casey.
R:  Hi, my name's Stephanie.  How are you?
L:  I'm all right, but I --.
R:  Good.
L:  -- I don't watch any television.
R:  Oh.  Then this is going to be quite an interesting conversation.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, I have -- I have heard of, uh, Survivor though.  I -- I don't know anything about it.  Do you?
R:  Um, I was actually watching it right when I decided to call.  [LAUGH]  So, to me, uh, this is a very interesting topic because my friend -- I mean we don't sit around watching TV all day but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's the one time during the week when we all, kind of, gather and cook dinner.
L:  I've -- I've heard other people say that.
R:  Yeah.  Like, gather, cook dinner, drink wine and, like, just enjoy each other's company.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and I don't know what it is but people get so addicted to reality TV and we all just like-- we're like, "Oh, it's -- tonight's The Bachelor.  Everyone we're meeting at this person's house" and, like, tons of people come.  It's kind of a social event now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, I don't know.  I know a lot of people around the country that have -- you know, have, like, Survivor parties or--
L:  Well, what do they do exactly on the show?
R:  Um, well with Survivor, it's like a bunch of different people.  [LIPSMACK]  Um, like, I don't know.  It starts off with, like, twenty five people and they're in different groups and they all have to, like, basically, like live in the wild.  Um, and they make alliances with other people.  Um --
L:  Wh- what do you mean the wild?
R:  Like, right now, they're in -- where are they?  They're in, like, the middle of Thailand or something.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, so, like, they have to, you know, find their own food, cook their own food.  They live like --
L:  So, you're talking away from [MN] -- away from city?  Away from other people?
R:   Yeah, they're not near anyone.  I mean, they're like in the middle of a jungle or something.
L:  And these are -- these are all like American people.  People who aren't used to being there, right?
R:  Yes, exactly.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, and they -- they -- like the show doesn't give them any food at all so, like, right now they've been on the show for, like, twenty six days --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so they're very, like, emaciated because they hardly get to eat and -- I mean, basically, who can survive the longest in the wilderness, and who can make the most alliances so that people, like, keep them on the show.  'Cause what happens is every show they end up kicking someone off and, like, usually people get kicked off because they're, like, a threat to other people, i.e. 'cause at the end the person wins like a million dollars or something.
L:  What, uh -- okay, I -- I d- -- I don't exactly follow.  What do you mean a -- a threat?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, okay --
L:  They -- they're -- 'cause they compete?
R:  So -- yeah, basically.  Everyone wants to be, like, the last person, the survivor.  Because --
L:  How -- how do they decided who -- who gets -- who leaves?
R:  Well, that's the point.  Like, if you make alliances and, like, become friends with certain people.  Like everyone starts to have, like, kind of, clicks or clans.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then if they decide they don't like one person, people kind of, like, determine that and they kick that person off.
L:  So you -- so they vote amongst themselves?
R:  Amongst themselves, yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So that's --
L:  And so -- so your own teammates decide if you have to leave or not?
R:  Yeah, exactly.  So, I don't know, that's Survivor.  But I don't -- I actually don't really watch this show that much.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I, um, I watch The [LAUGH] Bachelor.
L:  What is -- what is that one?
R:  Have you heard of that?
L:  No, I haven't heard anything about that one.
R:  [MN]  Just out of curiosity, why -- you don't watch TV because ...?
L:  Uh, just never got in the habit.
R:  Never watched it, ever?
L:  No, never.
R:  So, like with the whole war going on you didn't watch TV at all?
L:  No.  I get all my information off a --
R:  Off the web?
L:  CNN dot com.
R:  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Um, well, The Bachelor, it's really, really stupid.  I mean -- and the other thing is, this, like, all these shows speak to pretty educated people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I don't know, it j- -- it just like strikes a chord of interest.  But, anyhow, The Bachelor is, like, starts out with like twenty seven girls and one guy.  And usually it's a really famous wealthy man.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And he basically narrows down, like, through weeks and weeks, um, like down to f- -- he's down to four women now.  And then [MN] like next week he'll narrow it to three, two and then, finally one.  And like the last one, supposedly, he'll propose to her or they'll get enga- -- whatever, you know, they'll start dating or something.  So that's the major show -- reality show right now, among women.
L:  Uh, [MN] I -- I don't -- does that really work?  Uh, have they ever been through a season and the people got married or ...?
R:  Um, well, two of them they actually did ask the other to, like, marry them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they split up.  Um, but the -- just the past season the two people are still together.  
L:  Mm.
R:  And this one, um, I don't know.  I was reading on the internet today that, like, the guy -- we don't know who he picks yet but he said that the girl that he picked, uh --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- they're together still, so ...  Yeah.  That's about it.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I like the sounds of being -- being in the jungle better.  It sounds kind of -- the other one sounds pretty girly.
R:  Yeah, I mean a lot of the -- a lot of guys actually watch it to see the girls.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, the wilderness one -- Survivor is definitely, like, more rugged and whatever, but I think there's, like, more drama associated with The Bachelor.
L:  What do they eat on Survivor?
R:  Um, they eat -- they kill, like, wild stuff and then they get, like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a porridge of, uh, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Why are you laughing?
L:  Those crows.  They show 'em eating it?
R:  Yeah, it's pretty nasty.  And then they give them like a cup of rice a week, or something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then, um, sometimes in, like, the events they have to do.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, they, like, once were eating like [MN] disgusting things like, um, what do they call it.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Centipedes and live bugs --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and all this nasty stuff.
L:  [MN]
R:  And like some people were like throwing up on TV and all that stuff.
L:  Have you -- have you ever heard of any of the Japanese reality shows?
R:  No -- oh, like Iron Chef?
L:  Well, ye- -- the Japanese do all kinds of, uh, weird -- weird competition.  Like game shows where they're -- they're mean to the contestants when they don't, uh, when they get questions wrong or do something wrong.
R:  Oh, really.  No.  Tell me about that.
L:  Well, I -- I -- I've seen clips of it and I've -- I've -- I've heard people talking about them but th- -- you know, I haven't -- haven't seen too many myself.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I -- I heard that -- that Japan is the country that originated the -- the punishment deemed game shows.  
R:  Really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, I'd never heard of that.  Like the only, like, real live show that I know of is Iron Chef.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you know that show?
L:  I -- I've seen -- I've -- I've seen that. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've seen an episode of that.
R:  It's pretty funny but ...  I -- I haven't really watched any of those.  Like, I thought the main thing with the Japanese was, like, their, um, cartoons and stuff that became really popular here.
L:  And that's made a lot of money in this country.
R:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK]  Um, oh there's a presidential address to make.  Okay.  Anyhow, um, I don't really know what else to say about reality TV because you don't really watch it.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  So [LIPSMACK] uh, what else can I tell you?
L:  Well, I guess -- I guess the war would be reality TV.
R:  I mean, the war is just [MN]
L:  That's the real deal.
R:  Yeah, but I -- I -- oh, you know what I was watching this morning on the news --
L:  What?
R:  -- when I was getting ready for work?  They were saying there's this guy, um, he's the mayor of Redondo Beach, California.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And he went on, um, a reality show called Blind Date.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Have you heard of that?
L:  I can imagine what it would be.  No, I haven't.
R:  Okay, so Blind Date, basically, is like literally it's a blind date --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they film it. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay?  So he went on Blind Date and he also went on, like, this other show, another dating show. And the newscaster was like, "Don't you think this is going to hurt your political reputation?  Um, why would you go on a reality show?"  And he's like, "Well the funny thing is, reality shows are not really reality, it's all staged, blah, blah, blah".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And all of us think that it's real, but I think --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they totally stage everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So he -- that was just interesting 'cause, like, I don't know, everyone assumes that everything that happens on these shows is like real life drama.  And he was claiming they, like, tell you what to say sometimes and act.  Or they just kind of, like, change the camera to make things look dramatic when they're not.
L:  He must be a really good sport to even think about doing something like that if he's in politics.
R:  I don't know why he did it, to be honest.  [LAUGH]  Like, I don't know.  And he was like, "Well my constituents in California, you know, are liberal and --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- they think it's funny".  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So ...  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK]  Um, I don't know what else to say.  
L:  [MN]  Are -- are -- are they going to be televising Bush's, uh, he's -- he's on the aircraft carrier, last I heard.
R:  Is that where he is?
L:  Yeah.  He was going -- going to talk to some troops that were coming home.
R:  Yeah.  Channel sev- -- well, I don't know where you're at so, but, um, it's live from nine to nine thirty, tonight.
L:  Yeah.  I-- I --
R:  Did you even own a TV?
L:  Yeah, but it's -- it's not hooked up.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  So if you were [MN] want to watch the presidential address would you --
L:  I would just download the movie clip and watch it on my computer.
R:  Uh-huh.  Shit, my phone.
L:  But it's -- it's rare that I do that.  I just -- I -- I just -- would just as soon read everything.
R:  [MN]  
L:  And I have been following the war, you know.  I d- -- I don't -- I -- I really didn't know what to think.  I didn't -- when -- when I heard that the -- the Iraqi people were fighting back, I thought, you know, maybe we were doing the wrong thing, but now it -- it seems that, you know, some of them are -- are -- are pleased that we went over there.
R:  Mhm.  I mean, I guess you could argue that the war was reality TV on, because I think a lot of it was propaganda tha they were showing on TV for us, and you know.  So, if you -- if the argument is reality TV is just a crock anyways then, I don't know, maybe the stuff they were showing on TV was too.
L:  I -- I -- I don't know.  I feel like -- I feel like the reporters didn't really get to say a whole lot or -- or do a whole lot.
