R:  Hi.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  I'm Mike Zimmer.
L:  My name's Carolyn Dagger[?].
R:  Hi, Carolyn.  How are you?
L:  Good -- good.  Where are you located at?
R:  I'm in Maryland.
L:  Oh, I'm in Minnesota.
R:  Wow, I used --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to live in -- I used to live in Fargo.
L:  Oh, I went to school in Fargo.
R:  Is that right.
L:  Yes, at NDSU.
R:  Well, my dad was, ah, with the Department of Agriculture, and their location was right there on NDSU campus.
L:  Oh yes, uh-huh.
R:  So --
L:  Did he work with extension, or ...?
R:  He was in agricultural research.  He worked in, ah, oil seed varieties of sunflower.
L:  Oh yes, uh-huh.  They did a lot of work when I was there on sunflowers and, um, food and, um, those kind of things that -- when I was in college.  Yes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, what do --
L:  What kind of work d- --
R:  I'm --
L:  Go --
R:  -- an attorney.
L:  -- ahead. [PAUSE]  Oh, okay.
R:  That's what I do.  I'm an attorney.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm a dietitian.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, ah, have done that for many years.
R:  Good.  Well, what do --
L:  Is this your first -- is this your first phone call?
R:  Yes.
L:  Mine too.
R:  Oh, okay.  Good.
L:  Good -- good.
R:  So, what do you think about this Iraq situation?
L:  Well, I'm glad it's over with.  And I didn't know anybody that got killed.
R: Uh-huh.
L:  And I think, ah, it was -- it was something that had to be done.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  What was your feeling on it?
R:  Ah, I agree with everything you just said.  Ah --
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  Yeah, I think it was justifying.  Ah --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I would -- would -- I -- the main problem I saw there is too much danger of, ah, um, weapons of mass destruction getting in the hands of terrorists.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I thought there was too big a risk of that happening.  And the -- the president had to make -- take this, um, st- -- you know, they -- they weren't going to, ah, change or get rid of their weapons, so that was the only way to deal with them --
L:  Right.
R:  -- this time -- take them out.
L:  Do you think it'll filter over into North Korea?
R:  In -- in what sense?  I don't follow you.
L:  Um, do you think that there'll be, um, war there?
R:  No.  Nobody wants to -- war in Korea.  It would be a devastating situation to have war in Korea.
L:  Uh-huh.  Okay.
R:  The Korean -- North Koreans have a huge army.  They have, ah, a very high preponderance of heavy artillery that is directly within range of Seoul, Korea.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, on the other hand, they don't really wanna fight us because they know if they were in a war with us their regime would come to an end.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, everybody has an incentive not to have a war in Korean Peninsula.
L:  Yeah, that's what I -- my feeling is too.  Yeah.  Do you think that, ah, oil will start coming to America now that it's pumping?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, we -- we were never really much of a supply of oil from Iraq.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, in our country a lot of our oil comes from, ah, Venezuela.  Ah, that's been a problem.  The --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- Venezuelan oil has been, um, interrupted.  Um --
L:  What is the price of gas in Maryland right now?
R:  It's about a dollar fifty five for regular.
L:  Okay.
R:  And about --
L:  Here it's, ah, like, a buck forty nine.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, um, comparable.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  It's just --
R:  Yeah, I -- I think the, ah, Iraqi oil, ah, will be on the market soon, which I think will help, ah, prices go down.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ah, I don't think that had anything to do with the policy of going to war there.  If it was about oil then what United States should have done is to just make a deal with Saddam Hussain and buy -- and buy -- and get their oil out there.
L:  Uh-huh -- uh-huh.  Do you think he's still alive?
R:  Hard to say.  I think there's a pretty good likelihood that he's not.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, that's -- that's, you know -- I don't think anybody knows right now.
L:  Okay -- okay.  That must have been close to ten -- did you hear that buzzer?
R:  No, I was --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- something.
L:  Maybe it's my phone. [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- I did hear something kind of interrupt.
L:  Yes -- yes.
R: Ah --
L:  When you, um -- what is -- how does the -- like, you're out on the east coast there, near Washington.  Um, how does it play across on the press, this whole thing with Bush and -- and the war and how it was handled?
R:  I think most people are supportive of the president --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah, it's -- his war policies. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, there were some protests out here -- anti war protesters, but not very many.
L:  Uh-huh, okay.
R:  How -- how about in your area?
L:  Um, there was just a few and it was usually during, um, rush hour, above the, ah, bridge -- overpasses over the highway --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and that.  And then some school kids got into it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But otherwise, that was about it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We have a big eco- -- um, state of Minnesota, um, government is short on money.  That's the biggest iss- -- biggest issue.
R:  I think just about every state is having a budget problem.  Maryland --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- has a tremendous budget problem.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ah --
L:  Well, we had Jesse Ventura as governor and he didn't do anything.
R:  No?
L:  So, now it's all caught up.
R:  I remember when Jesse was elected governor.  I'm -- I'm -- I like professional wrestling --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so that was very exciting when he was elected governor.
L:  Well, he's quite a character.
R:  Yeah, he's amazing.
L:  Yes -- yes. [PAUSE]
R:  Yeah, we had a, ah -- first Republican governor elected in Maryland in thirty six years last --
L:  Is that --
R:  -- year.
L:  -- the one who ran against, um, Kathleen Kennedy?
R:  Yeah.  Her name's Kathleen Kennedy Townsend.
L:  Oh, that's right -- that's right.
R:  Her married -- her maiden name would -- would have been Kennedy.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, he defeated -- he defeated the Kennedy.
L:  Yeah.  Or, I th- -- I -- I think it was that -- wasn't your state ready for a change?
R:  The, ah, um, prior governor was very, very unpopular.
L:  Oh.
R:  He was just -- he just, ah -- [MN] he was very heavy handed.  Ah, liked to play a kind of revenge, old style, gotcha politics.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, ah, that hurt --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ah, Townsend.  Ah, you know, she got tarred with all the negative --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- aspects of --
L: Uh-huh.
R:  -- of the incumbent, but couldn't take any credit for any of the positive aspects.  So --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that, ah -- that really hurt her.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, that's too bad.  Yeah.  But, ah, [PAUSE] do you think the economy will get better now since the war has changed things?
R:  Ah, I hope so.  It's hard to --
L:  Me too.
R:  -- I mean, there's just so many factors that go into the economy it's had to say.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um --
L:  Do you think people are feeling more positive about the economy?
R:  I've heard some reports on the news that, ah, consumer confidence, um, figures are higher.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But -- but you never know exactly what they base those kinds of things on, so I take it with a little bit of skepticism.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Did you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- see the President yesterday?
L:  No, but I heard a little bit this morning on the radio.  I was working late last night and needed a quiet house, so --
R:  It was, ah, quite a tranquil atmosphere just, um -- just made for television kind of event.
L:  [LAUGH] It was one of those -- um, the -- the -- the ship -- the people on the ship really seemed excited.
R:  Yeah, his audience was very enthusiastic.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, that's when you should make it a speech, is when you're in -- in good favor.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's called riding the wave -- crest of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the wave --
L:  Yes.
R:   -- which is smart.
L:  Mhm.  Good -- good politics.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R: Do you have any other, ah, thoughts on the Iraq situation?
L:  Um, it would be interesting to see some of those palaces that they were talking about -- inside 'em.
R:  I think a lot of them have bomb holes in their roofs.
L:  Yeah, that's true -- that's true.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And they found all that money in those closets.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, ah, no it, um -- are you using AT&T?  Is that your wireless service?
R:  Um, for my cellphone?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  I use, um, Singular.
L:  Oh, 'cause I think that's what they're testing, is -- um, how did you find out this?
R:  My wife got an email about it.
L:  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Well, that's how mine was too, so --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  And, ah, it, ah -- it's a interesting topic though about the Iraq.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, that's a war that's been going on for centuries and it -- it'll be interesting to see if -- what happens in the Middle East all together.
R:  Yes. [MN]  Our president's just released his Road Map for Peace.  I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, it -- [MN] it'd be nice if some point that were worked out, but there's been war going on in the Middle East for centuries.  I don't know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- if it's realistic to --
