R:  Hi.
L:  Hello, my name is Anne.  Hello?
R:  Hello.  Hi.  This is Patty.
L:  Hi, Patty.  How are you?
R:  I'm okay.  
L:  Oh, that's good.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, where are you?  I'm in New York.
R:  Uh, me?  I'm in Philadelphia.
L:  Oh.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's close enough.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's pretty cool.
L:  Yeah.  They said the topic is, "Do you watch reality TV?" right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you?
R:  I l- -- I watch Real TV.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  I watch as many as I can.
R:  As possible.  Yeah.
L:  Name it and I watch it.  I'm always --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- just scrambling through.  Uh, you know, the first one I come across I just get stuck on it.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Up to last night I watched, uh, the making of, uh, Diva.  You know.
R:  Diva.  Oh, man, I have watched that a little while ago.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I watched that a little while ago.  That was real funny.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That was funny 'cause, you know, some of the women can't sing but, you know, that -- that they'll be like -- they'll let 'em go anyway because they're divas, you know.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There was attitude, you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  And they'll just [LAUGH] -- and they'll just, like, say anything, you know, that -- that tell 'em how they feel about they just sang, you know.
L:  Right.  Even last night --
R:  And I'll be like, "Oh my God."
L:  -- I watched the one for Philadelphia.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I thought that one very amusing.  Patty Labelle was, uh, the guest judge.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And it was very, very amusing because all these girls, you know, acting as if they were hot and happening, you know.
R:  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, and so they get all the -- they get all the -- hello?
L:  Yes, I'm still here.
R:  They -- they -- they get all the makeup and they get made over and they look different.
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yes.
R:  It was -- it was one about the, yeah, I think, yeah.
L:  But like you said, they really cannot sing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They just have attitude, you know.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  They [MN] --
R:  They just got attitude.
L:  Right.
R:  They get to judge the people.
L:  Yeah.  But what I find is that television has been drifting towards that now.  You know?
R:  Mhm. 
L:  More reality based television.  I think because it is not only cheaper --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- because remember you'd have -- they'd have to pay all these high priced -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stars, you know.  
R:  Nobody wants to pay high prices.
L:  Ah, that's it.  So, --
R:  You know.
L:  -- you know for them, it's -- it's like paying Mexican workers.
R:  [LAUGH]  Pesos.
L:  [MN]. Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, right.  You know, it's like dime a dozen.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They get anybody off the streets and just --
R:  [MN] [LAUGH]  And they just --
L:  Well, it's good --
R:  -- get them and set 'em up.  
L:  Right.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Right.  But then again it's good for -- for the ordinary civilian because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, at least it gives them a chance at stardom.  You know what.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  A lot of them, they enjoy --
R:  And they don't give a lot of people chances either.  
L:  That's right.  That's right.  
R:  And, um ...
L:  And what I find is that they've been releasing a whole batch of stars, you know.  Like --
R:  Oh my God.
L:  Even like American Idol.  
R:  [MN]  Oh, American Idol.  Yeah, I watch that.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  I watch that.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I watch that.  Yeah.
L:  And Joe Millionaire.
R:  [MN] 
L:  And The Bachelor.
R:  [MN]  Stop it.
L:  Yes.  Yeah.  It's very --
R:  But like the Bernie Mac show.  I watch that.
L:  Yeah.  Right.  Very, very --
R:  [LAUGH]  He's a funny dad.  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]  Yeah, it's funny.
R:  I mean, how real can you get? 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Like -- like Good Times.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Remember Good Times?
L:  Uh-huh, yes.  Yes.  Yes.  From way back, right?
R:  Yeah.  And Different Strokes, yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What is interesting, I love them.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I really, really love them because, you know -- but even like this one, uh, there's a summer one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That comes on -- it comes on say between July and it ends, like, in September.
R:  [MN]  Yeah.  If f- -- I -- I fo- -- uh.
L:  It's a group of people that living under one roof for, like, two to three months.
R:  Oh, see that -- that hasn't even been on in a while.  
L:  Right, yeah --
R:  That has not been on in a while. 
L:  -- it comes on only in the summer time.  Only the summer time it comes on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  This would be the, I think, the third or fourth one.  I think the fourth one.
R:  The fourth one, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's about the fourth because the last one, I think, uh, was, uh, Manual Lewis and all them in the house.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, man.  
L:  Yeah.  But it's fun.  And like I say, it gives the ordinary person --
R:  Just like soap opera.
L:  -- a chance at the -- yeah.  
R:  Soap operas are reality shows.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, but --
R:  Oh my God.  
L:  But, I like the idea, though.  I really like the concept of reality TV.
R:  The idea's fine, it gives people -- it gives people something else to laugh at --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- besides, you know, troublemakers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.
L:  And it adds to our imagination and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it -- it --
R:  And personality too.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  And I [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it just makes you wonder what is going to happen next.  You know.
R:  Oh my God.
L:  It's -- it's not -- it's very unpredictable so it adds to the intensity.
R:  And sometimes you can figure it out.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It adds to the intensity --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and the excitement. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It makes you wonder what next is going to be happening or who next is going to be kicked off the show or --
R:  Oh, That Seventies Show.
L:  -- what is going to be happening, when, where, why and how, you know. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it's pretty interesting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Pretty interesting.  And I really, really like the concept.  I know they're going to be having a channel where they cater to just strictly reality TV, you know that, right?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I had heard about that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Heard about that.
L:  Yeah.  It should be -- that channel should be on by, well this is May.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think by the end of May, going on to June, there'll be a new channel. 
R:  A new channel?
L:  That makes it -- uh-huh.  That makes -- that -- that makes reality TV available twenty four hours per day.
R:  Oh, man.  That'll be great.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  That -- that'll be great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That'll be great.
L:  It's going to be getting a lot of +advertisements, meaning --
R:  A lot.
L:  -- that they really shouldn't be running out of money to keep it on, you know.
R:  Oh, man.  'Cause you -- just some reality television shows don't last long if they're like too good --
L:  That's true.
R:  You know.
L:  That's true.
R:  As you can't like be too good, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If you're too real they're gonna cut you off.
L:  Absolutely.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's true.  Because even all these talk shows that are, like, dime a dozen.  You see them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on today and within a couple of months they're off.  I remember the [several inaudible words] show.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean that lady is so good.  She can really motivate her listeners and her audience and, so on, but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I remember I was like a part of her audience at one stage.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And I kept [MN] --
R:  That was cool.
L:  Yeah, it was -- it was okay.  You know, I was just being like an extra and they told me that.
R:  Mm.
L:  Well, then I was to ask some relevant questions.  They put me in the front row.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And say, just ask some questions but everytime I attended, which was like once per week during her tenure I kept saying, "This show is not going to last".
R:  [MN].  Yeah.
L:  It was just too -- too --
R:  You are --
L:  -- clear cut and predictable.
R:  Oh my God.  We sitting in front of the television, like, "Oh my God" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- this is not going to last at all.
L:  Yeah.  And you see --
R:  I'll give it about two weeks.  [LAUGH]
L:  Believe you me.  As you see them you can tell.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Even the Connie Chung Show.  All right --
R:  Oh my God.
L:  -- she comes on CNN.  And just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yesterday I realised that she was off.  I hadn't seen her in a little while but then I, you know, I had said it was because of the war.  You know.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then last night I heard it and, um, the recently canceled Connie Chung Show.  And I said --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- "Oh my God".  
R:  And you know she's married to Maurie[?]?
L:  Right.  And he has his own talk show.
R:  Oh, man.
L:  I was on that --
R:  Yeah, I watch that too.
L:  [inaudible] Show too.  His show is good.
R:  [LAUGH]  His show --
L:  His show --
R:  -- makes me cry.  
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, because he's always featuring freaks of nature and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- some absurd topics.  What he's --
R:  Some people --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  Some people that don't know that they're going to be this way when they're born, you know.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Um, I -- I [MN] I cry because of the fact, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.  But you can --
R:  So he's a -- he's a good show.
L:  -- still say that --
R:  He gets high ratings.
L:  Right.  But you can [MN] -- that too can be classified as reality TV because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know when the guests go on, although they are being given leave, you know, like they're being given, um, an order in which questions will be asked --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and how they should answer.
R:  Okay, I never -- I never knew that.
L:  Yeah.  They are.  In most situations.  But what happen is that they are allowed to be flexible, because sometimes they even show them cue cards and say st- --
R:  Just like they have to talk about a certain thing?
L:  Right.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Right.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  But sometimes they're allowed to be improvisational, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So I would put that, uh -- I really classify that as reality TV too, because sometimes when you watch them you realise whatever they're saying is what they really want to say, you know.
R:  Yeah and sometimes whatever -- it's not everything on, uh, reality television that you agree with --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but sometimes you agree with it to the fullest extent, too.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.
R:  You'd be like, "Oh my God, it hap- happened -- that -- that happened to somebody I know before" or --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- even thinking that. 
L:  Ab- --
R:  You know, like, "Oh my God.  I'm seeing it".  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm seeing it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Absolutely.  But one -- one thing I've, uh, been observing too is that on these reality [MN] TV shows, they make the people look so beautiful.  You know what I mean?
R:  [MN]  
L:  You know.  To me they really look like stars.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Although they're just, you know, doing their little fifteen minute stint.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They look beautiful.
R:  Like Joe Millionaire.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he didn't really have any money.  And now he has life[?] -- 
L:  I'll tell you ...
R:  -- from the guy who has no money.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh my God.  I'm telling you.  But they really do make these people look beautiful.
R:  Mm.
L:  Like, they look like stars, you know.
R:  I know.
L:  Even The Bachelor and The Bachelorette.  
R:  Mm.
L:  I've been watching those on [inaudible].  Who'd believe that these people are scraped up off the streets?  You know.  Or who'd believe that they really audition for these kind of parts, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  It's good though.  It's really -- I love the concept.  I really l- --
R:  Yeah.  That's brilliant, eh?
L:  And I'm happy that they chose this topic because I really had a lot to talk about it.  'Cause I'm a TV freak.
R:  And I'm, yeah -- and I know a lot of people -- yeah, I do watch some.  I know people that don't even watch it and when I'm, like, talking about reality shows they'd be like, "I don't want to hear it".  I'm all like, "Oh man, you need to get in hip with it".
L:  [MN]  [LAUGH] 
R:  Because it's a lot of stuff, you know, that you need to listen to and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- learn, you know.  Some people --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- don't know for what.
L:  Right.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's true and they don't know when they might be into that position, too.
R:  Uh [MN]  Mhm.
L:  Or when they might see somebody that they --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- identify on TV.
R:  Everything is not what it seems on reality TV.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Absolutely.  But at school, the schools, television --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is taking a new twist and I like the +spontaneity of it all.  You know.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  It's very, very --
R:  It's a little spontaneous.  Spontaneous is good.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's really good.  Really good.  Because even as I'm talking to you now, I'm watching TV.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh man.  
L:  Yeah, I like --
R:  Oh man.
L:  -- to multitask.  You know, 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I like to do many things at the same time.
R:  Yeah, like --
L:  Or as I get --
R:  -- six things at once.  You'll be like, "Oh, I can't".
L:  So help me God, I'm cooking, watching TV --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- talking to you.  I have a magazine right in front of me.  
R:  Oh, yeah, that's the shot.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah, that way I --
R:  That way you don't get you so too bored.
L:  I'm telling you, I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- would never, ever get bored.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess one day I'll be on reality TV too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to show people how to multitask, eh?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah.  You got to be +ingenuity[?].
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  In these times, oh my God, anything to make a -- a quick buck or two, you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- be yourself. 
R:  It's all about the dollar for real.
L:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  
R:  All about the dollar.  They say do- -- money can't buy you love but it can buy you a lot of good --
L:  Other things.
R:  -- nice things.
L:  Things that can bring you love, right?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  What do you do?
R:  Me?
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  I, um, I work for this carriage company down center city.
L:  Oh.  
R:  Um, Philadelphia Seventy Six Trolley and Carriage Company.
L:  Oh.  Oh, that's interesting.  So you work nine to five?  Or you just work part time.
R:  Well, with the horses, I work with horses and carriage and buggies. 
L:  Oh, good.
R:  You know the ch- -- type of chivalry type of thing.
L:  Right.
R:  [inaudible] people have historic tours around Philadelphia, old Philadelphia.
L:  Oh.  That must be interesting.  I mean, you see a lot of people everyday.
R:  I see a lot of people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We even stay out when it's raining, you know.  And I'd be feeling sorry for the horses.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They'd be like the horses can't feel it.  It's
