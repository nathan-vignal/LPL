L:  Hi, I'm Andre Seros[?].
R:  Hi.  I'm Danielle.
L:  [NOISE] Hi, Danielle.  [LAUGH]
R:  How are you?
L:  [NOISE] All right.  N- --
R:  What did it say the topic was again?
L:  I think it wanted to know, uh -- it sounded like it said to me, um, what we thought --
R:  Something --
L:  If anything --
R:  -- about Iraq, right?
L:  Yeah.  What, if anything, we sh -- thought should be done about disarming Iraq or --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- done about Iraq.
R:  Yeah.  I -- are you real into the whole thing that's g- -- the whole war that's going on?
L:  Well, I -- I only -- because my best friend's brother's over there.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And so I -- I do keep tabs on him.
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  Um --
R:  But, like, do you watch the news like a lot because my husband's constantly putting the news --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- on all -- every time I turn around he's flipped the channel and put the news on, all the time.  So --
L:  Yeah.  My hus- -- my husband has a tendency to do that also.  I try to not do it during the day because we have a two and a half year old --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And frankly some of the things that they're showing on the news is just --
R:  I know.
L:  -- too graphic.
R:  I couldn't believe the things that they -- they were showing on the TV.  I mean --
L:  He's -- he's a very sensitive little child.  I mean, he wasn't even a year old when the terrorists attacked --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the Trade Centres and he said -- and he was crying on my lap.  He couldn't understand why --
R:  Really?
L:  -- mommy was upset.
R:  Right.  Right.  But you were crying, probably --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, he was crying.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, and when he sees somebody on TV crying now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he'll be like, "Mommy, they boo boo" and, you know, crying and stuff --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- because they're crying.
R:  Right.
L:  And so I try not to have it on TV because those people are very expressive of their feelings. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know, they seem to either love you or hate you over there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Those are my [LAUGH] concerns.  There's no -- no [inaudible].
R:  Right.  Yeah, I -- I mean, on the topic I [MN] -- I really don't even know.  I mean, I --I watch a little bit but I'm not really deep into -- I mean, I -- I wanna know like [NOISE] the important things that are going on but I think they talk so much about it it's hard to filter out what you really need to know or w- -- or what's just talk, you know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  But, um, in -- in --
L:  I mean --
R:  Go ahead.
L:  One of the main --
R:  I'm sorry.
L:  Go ahead.
R:  Oh, in terms of -- of, you know, disarming Iraq, I -- I mean, first they have to, you know, get all the head guys.  But it looks like they're doing that, you know, little by little they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- getting, you know, the -- the head guys and, you know, I -- I guess the president said yesterday --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when he talked on the news --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that [NOISE], um -- I guess he was saying, like, [NOISE] combat is over pretty much --
L:  Right.
R:  But --
L:  The major combat.
R:  Yeah.  So, I mean, I don't know -- I -- I know he was -- my husband is real good at like reading in between the lines and -- and listening --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because a lot of what he said I didn't really understand because, I mean, I don't -- he's more like in the analysis part of it so he's real good at listening to what the president's saying and then he tells me in layman's terms [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  But he was saying -- he was saying, you know, basically that Syria's next and then Iran --
L:  I --
R:  -- I guess, is what my husband was telling me it sounds like he's saying, you know.
L:  Well -- and -- and I agree with your husband totally because, uh, Syria has stepped in and become very aggressive against the United States.
R:  Right.
L:  With their positions with Iraq --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that one of the major reasons why we went into Iraq was because they supposedly had weapons of mass destruction.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And a -- a lot of the countries are saying, "Well, you haven't found those weapons of mass destruction".  Now, well, I think that we have found a lot of, uh, smoking guns.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  I mean, why did their training bunkers have to have all this protective equipment against chemical warfare --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if they weren't practicing --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  -- at a -- chemical warfare and they did find a place that had chemical --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- residue on, um, shells, bomb shells --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but they didn't find any that were still loaded.
R:  Yeah.  Huh.
L:  So, I --
R:  I don't know. [SIGH] It's --
L:  I honestly think that we -- that we need to do as much as we can but we're --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  It -- they were just saying on the news yesterday that -- or day before, one of the two -- that they would go to protect the military installation that they had found that was Iraq's and try to get it -- that bunker empty but they would leave with some of the materials and by the time that they would get back it had already been emptied and looted by the people that lived in that area.
R:  Right, yes.  Yeah, they're -- I mean --
L:  So, it's going to be really, you know, a difficult thing --
R:  Yeah, I don't --
L:  -- to try to --
R:  -- think they're as --
L:  -- get it done.
R:  -- dumb as some people think they are.  I think, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they definitely -- they're more, um, primitive than us, I guess, in -- in the way they live and stuff but they're -- they're fighting to the death so, you know, if they're fighting to the death, they're -- they're different than us because they're willing to sacrifice everything.  You know, they're just fighting, fighting, fighting, you know.  They -- they don't -- they don't live like we live.  They don't think like we think.  You know, they're -- the -- the soldiers over there, their soldiers are just so barbaric, you know, the way --
L:  Well --
R:  -- they fight.
L:  -- they think that if they get killed during war for a Shiite that they're going to be ensured a place in --
R:  Right.
L:  -- heaven [inaudible], you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they think they're doing a good thing.  They think they're going to have what -- what would they sing?  Virgins, when they [LAUGH] -- when they go, when they -- when they die --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- wherever they are they're gonna have virgins and, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's gonna be a party, you know, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's crazy.  It's -- it's definitely crazy.  I mean, I was glad to hear though that, I guess, a lot of people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- are gonna be going home that -- that made me happy to hear because, you know, [NOISE] all these families that -- what -- what did he say?  I think he said a hundred babies were born since this --
L:  Well, just on --
R:  -- happened.
L:  -- that one ship.  Just on the Abraham Lincoln.
R:  Oh, just on --
L:  The aircraft carrier.
R:  -- that one ship?
L:  There was a hundred and fifty --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- men that became fathers.
R:  [NOISE] Wow! I thought he --
L:  B- --
R:  -- meant, like, more -- more than just that one ship.  Wow!
L:  No that was just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on that one aircraft carrier --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- that came in.  It reached port today.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] I can't imagine what it would be like to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have a child born and not get to see 'em.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, [NOISE] that -- so, that -- that really, you know, made me happy and I know, you know -- I -- I don't have anyone in the military but [NOISE], uh, I can't even imagine, you know, having to leave and know your wife's about to have a baby [LAUGH], you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That would be horrible.  But ...
L:  You can see that that would be one of the reasons also why somebody would want to go and fight this war if they perceived that it was a real threat to their children's future.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Definitely.  I --
L:  I mean, un- until September eleventh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- happened nobody ever thought any more about us being attacked here on that level.
R:  Right.  Right.  Yeah.
L:  And I know I didn't and I was a fire fighter.
R:  Really?
L:  EMT[?].
R:  Oh, wow!  How long do you do that?
L:  Eighteen years.
R:  Wow!
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow!  And you said you have a two year old and that the --
L:  I have a two year old now.  Yeah.
R:  Is -- is that your only child?
L:  He's my only child.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  God blessed us with him, uh, ten days before our --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- fifteenth wedding anniversary.
R:  Wow!
L:  And so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- after I had him, about three months after I had him, I, uh, retired from the fire department.
R:  Mm.
L:  And this -- and --
R:  And you've been home with him ever since?
L:  Yeah, basically.  I'm running a home business now.
R:  Oh, okay.  That's cool.
L:  Which is where the phone ca- -- where the -- this call caught me.  I'm actually sitting in my car pulled up to a business. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  And I -- well, yeah, I'm not supposed to be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there till five thirty anyway so, yeah, I can do this. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] What -- what part of the country are you in?
L:  Um, in Kansas.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Florida.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  I'm in --
L:  Great.
R:  -- Florida so ... it's really hot over here. [LAUGH] It's --
L:  Oh, it's --
R:  -- just beginning May and I -- I can't take it.  I mean, I've lived here --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- over ten years but I'm originally from New York and I don't think I'll ever, um, be used to, you know, the constant hot all the time, year round.  It's --
L:  Yeah, I don't --
R:  -- a bit much.
L:  -- know how the older people move --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, they move there.  I'm like, "Why?"
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I was there in August one time.
R:  Right.
L:  And we were camping down along the, uh, rural islands there off the gulf.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I was just totally miserable.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's horrible.
L:  Please take me back to Kansas --
R:  It's --
L:  -- where we think we have humility. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I mean, at least --
