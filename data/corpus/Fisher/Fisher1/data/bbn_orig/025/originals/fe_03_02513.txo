R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  [LAUGH]  I'm Teresa.
L:  Hi, Teresa.  I'm Martha and I'm in Florida.
R:  Oh, hi, Martha.  I'm in Tennessee.  I'm in Nashville.
L:  Uh-huh.  Been there.
R:  Oh, you have?
L:  Yeah, just for visits.  Not ever --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- lived there.
R:  Well, good.  So, reality shows?  
L:  Yeah, do you watch 'em?
R:  Not really.
L:  Not really.  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you?
L:  No.  
R:  I --
L:  No.
R:  -- think they're very tacky.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think they're incredibly tacky and when I look at that I'm -- I'm hoping that people in other countries don't look at that and think that that's what the average American person [LAUGH] is like because it's so embarrassing and so horrible.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Um.
L:  Yeah, I feel like I get enough reality from watching the news.
R:  Isn't that the truth?
L:  If I watch TV we -- we watch a lot of sports, um, some of the how to shows, [inaudible] a home repair, cooking, things --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- like that.  
R:  Do you watch a lot of PBS?
L:  Uh, I really like the History Channel.
R:  Oh, yeah, that's good.  
L:  We have cable and there are just so many good choices.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know [LAUGH], um, I did have cable but I just bought a house so I'm like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- kind of cutting corners until -- my house was renovated but, you know, all the little cutesy things you want to do to personalize it.
L:  Yeah, like furniture.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you know, like paint the walls, maybe, put down different flooring and stuff.  
L:  Mm.
R:  So, I'm kind of, like, not doing the cable thing right now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I end up watching a whole lot of PBS. [MN]
L:  Yes.  Yes.  That's great.  
R:  Now, I have to say with the reality thing, Joe Millionaire?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I watched it a couple of times only because I could have the girls over and we could heckle it.
L:  Yes.
R:  But even then it was just so bad.  
L:  And The Bachelorette.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, and isn't there another one like that now?
R:  Yeah, I mean there's a million of them, I guess.
L:  And there's one with Monica Lewinsky?
R:  Oh, what is that?  You know.
L:  Monica Lewinsky is on some kind of a show, and there's this girl and she's going to pick from these six bachelors that all have masks.
R:  Oh -- oh the ones that have masks on?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, Mr. Personality.  
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  I've seen ads for it.  It's so pathetic.  Well, they were trying to do one up around here in Kentucky.  The Real Hillbillies.  Have you heard about that?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mm.
L:  Oh -- oh, like, the Beverley Hillbillies --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but real people?
R:  But -- yeah, they were going to go to this small town and pick this small family.
L:  Mm.
R:  And kind of, like, live with them for a while so other people could make fun of them and mock them.
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  Basically.
L:  -- not nice.
R:  No, you know.  And everybody has different values based on, you know, if they're in a big town, small town, what region and -- and they just people on there for the sake of, you know, other people's amusement.  It's just --
L:  Yeah, I was born and raised --
R:  -- pretty cruel.
L:  -- in Louisville. 
R:  Oh, were you, really?
L:  Yeah, and -- and, you know, if my gra- -- my grandparents didn't have an opportunity to go to college, and if you get two or three generations of that in a row then you're grammar isn't the best.  But that doesn't make you any less of a person.
R:  No, it absolutely does not.
L:  No.
R:  You know, I -- I grew up in South Chicago.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, and one of my parents graduated high school, the other didn't.  And most of my family, you know, they didn't go to college.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I -- I would be appalled if somebody filmed my family just so they can --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- laugh at 'em.  You know.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  And what -- what you say is so true.  That, you know, that's not the qual- -- you know, things like kindness and --
L:  Mm.  Mhm.
R:  -- compa- -- those -- those are what make a person. 
L:  Now they -- they call this reality TV and I'm not sure that's -- that's so real.  You know, you look at some of those shows that they have --
R:  You know you got a point.  That's not reality.  
L:  No.
R:  They call it that.
L:  Yes.
R:  The only reality show that I can actually stomach is, because I don't have cable I have to watch [LAUGH] various things, is Fox has one for children where -- where they're on the island and they have to compete in different little things --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- for their group to stay.  But it -- it -- they're educational things.  You know.
L:  Mm.  My grandchildren are too young for that right now, but ...
R:  Yeah.  This -- this is more for like nine or ten year olds, I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Maybe, like, up to thirteen.  But they all have to do different little challenges and they're usually -- they're athletic or based on, you know, like educational things.  Now that I think is okay.
L:  Well, then you can see that what one person is strong in one time they may be weak in something else.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, but that's not as- -- you know [MN] -- reality TV, it builds no sense of community.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean it's not anybody helping raise the village, helping raise a child, kind of a thing.  They're all vicious to each other.
R:  Well, yeah, that's [MN] the one thing that I noticed with those shows even though I don't really watch 'em but, you know, people at work talk about 'em or whatever.  It's usually the worst individuals who win.  Those with the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- least morals and values.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And are the most vindictive or manipulative or lie or whatever.  And I'm like, "Now, what does that accomplish?"
L:  Mhm.  And we --
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- want to raise a whole generation who thinks that competitiveness is -- is a -- a real plus.
R:  Yeah.  You know, it -- it does worry me about -- about kids and the things they see and with games and everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It doesn't really teach a lot of the values.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN]  I was raised in a pretty traditional family, you know, and things like lying and cheating and being mean wasn't tolerated.
L:  No, much less praised.
R:  Yeah.  Mm.
L:  Nope.
R:  Do you have kids?
L:  Yes.  Uh, I have a -- a --
R:  Oh yeah, you said you did.
L:  -- son and a daughter, and my grandchildren are two and one month.
R:  Oh, how cute.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So they're not really TV age yet?
L:  No. 
R:  Yeah, I don't have any kids.  I'm -- I'm thirty five.  You know, so I'm -- pretty much will talk to my girlfriends and -- and we're like, "Oh, this is so bad".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- I don't --
L:  Yeah, but that's fun.  I could see you all gathered round Joe Millionaire, you know, with the chips and the colas, and the --
R:  Yeah, we -- w- --
L:  -- whatevers.
R:  We did that a couple of nights.  And then it was just, like, "Oh, this is bad.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's so mean".  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But we did it for laughs a couple of times.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Got together and had our snacks and --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- huddled around the TV and we were just like, "All these people are unbelievable".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then you wonder how much is scripted too.
L:  Yeah, and -- and then you keep finding out things after each show.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, that they -- well they really didn't film that live there.  They really flew 'em over here and then flew 'em back and ...
R:  Or, they really didn't do this for a living.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or they're really married.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or [LAUGH], you know and it was just like, "Oh man, that's so bad".
L:  You know, and who's being manipulated then?  Are the viewers the ones that are really getting the short sh- -- short shaft, as it were?
R:  Yeah.  You know, and then you see some of the people who are on the show and afterwards they're like -- they feel manipulated.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  And it's like, well, why not question why they want to be -- why they want as much attention to be on national TV, you know.  It's like, "Well, what did you expect?"
L:  Yeah.  Would you try out for Survivor or ...?
R:  Me!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Never.  Or -- or the Fear Factor thing where they have people trying to --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  --like, eat nasty stuff.  I'm just like, "Now who would do that?"
L:  And, you know, jump out of perfectly good airplanes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Um, I go to this nail salon that's owned by a Vietnamese family, you know, and most of the immigrants, or whatever, work really hard to, you know, try to make a living.  And they happened to have the TV show on Fear Factor and I asked them, I was like, "What do you think of that?" and they just laughed and shook their heads.  And I was like "Would you do any of that if it were a whole lot of money?" and they were like, "No, of course not".
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and they just thought it -- it was bizarre.  And I'm like, you know, maybe Americans are as greedy as we all think we are.  [LAUGH]  I don't know.  That's so bad.
L:  Yeah, and some of these families that are immigrating in look at our families and they feel that they have a stronger sense of family than we do.
R:  Isn't that true? 
L:  [LIPSMACK]  
R:  What --
L:  And isn't that sad?
R:  What part of, um, Florida are you in?
L:  Uh, Melbourne.  It's on the east coast.
R:  On the east coast?
L:  Kind of south east of Orlando.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not too far from Cape Canaveral, where all the rockets go up.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, like we have a large hispanic population here and, you know, they all tend to live with their grandparents --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or whatever.  And, you know, they wouldn't put their grandparents in a nursing home.
L:  No.
R:  You know, it's just not their culture.  They don't think that way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, it's kind of refreshing to see people who actually spend a lot of time with their family and, you know, that's more the focus.  They don't drop their kids at day care [LAUGH] you know.
L:  No.  [LAUGH]
R:  Or [LAUGH] whatever.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it -- it really can be a little discouraging.
L:  But I think some of the respect for the elderly --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is really great and, of course, these reality TV shows have none of that sort of thing.
R:  Well, no.  There -- there's no substance or quality or -- or ethics.
L:  It's every person for themselves.
R:  Yeah.  I know, like PBS did a reality show where they had, um, a family go back in time and live like you would've lived if you were in the, like, mid eighteen hundreds.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I caught a couple episodes of that where they actually had to chop wood and not have electricity and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, wash their hair with -- with, like, bar soap and --
L:  Lice soap, yeah.
R:  You know, and -- and they went into it thinking, "Oh, this is going to be so fun and rustic".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And after three days they were like, "You want me to eat what?"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You [LAUGH] know. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And it -- I don't know.
L:  [MN]
R:  It really made you appreciate the things you take for granted.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, the luxuries that -- that -- you know, running water and things we deal with everyday that we don't really appreciate as much as, you know, we would if we went through something like that.
L:  And I think that's good for kids to see.
R:  Yeah, I think so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- too.  Like, as a kid I always went camping.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and things like that I think it's -- it's really healthy for kids.  To be in the outdoors, learn about nature.  Get away from the TV and the games and
