R:  Hi.  This is Anita.
L:  Hi.  It's Stormy.
R:  Hi.  How are you?
L:  I'm well.  How are you?
R:  Good -- good.  Is this your first time participating?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, okay.  It's my first time as well.  And, um, I guess our topic is reality -- the -- the reality shows.
L:  Yes.
R:  Do you, um -- do you get a chance to watch those?
L:  Not at all.  I've seen Survivor once.
R:  Okay. [NOISE]  Oh, this is gonna be very interesting because I haven't seen [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Very, very interesting.  So, we just have to keep the call going. [LAUGH] 
L:  So, you haven't seen reality TV at all?  
R:  No.
L:  Okay.
R:  Because -- and I may, um --
L:  We haven't.  
R:  -- kind of --
L:  So, next --
R:  -- make this --
L:  subject. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- a little -- let's -- let's make this a little long here [LAUGH] -- because, um, for some reason I've gotten out of the habit of watching television.  Um, I love movies.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I might rent a lot of movies, um, and, ah, you know -- or if a movie comes on TV I'll watch it, but, ah, I leave all the TV shows up to my children.  And I know they keep up with the reality TV, 'cause I hear them always making comments about it.  And so, um, people at work -- you know how that is.  People at work they get together and start, um, talking about the TV shows.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I can't really comment [LAUGH] --
L:  Okay.
L:  -- because, um -- it's like, "No, I haven't seen it -- I haven't seen it".  But, you know, time is so short, you know.
L:  Yes.
R:  And, um, so what I spend a lot of time -- probably a little bit too much time -- doing is on, um -- I'm on the computer.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, um -- but, I'm not just looking for anything.  I, um, have one email address where I have, um, just different businesses coming to me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and that's how I found out this one.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, what I do is, you know, I'll, um -- and I have six children -- so, um, once I get them situated, and I think I pretty much got 'em situated 'cause we all went out shopping tonight.  But, um, once I get them situated I'll get on the computer for about an hour or two.  And I will look, you know -- check out different businesses.  And so, like I said, um, that's how I found out about this one.
L:  Okay.  So --
R:  So -- so, you tell me a little bit about [LAUGH] --
L:  Next --
R:  You know, you did see one.  You saw one episode.
L:  I've seen Survivor.  I don't know if I've seen the entire episode.  I doubt it.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Um, I just -- I -- I -- I'm -- I guess the next topic within this is why do we feel that people watch reality TV?
R:  Okay.
L:  And so, I guess it's a form of escape for people.  I think that it's a form of escape who watch TV in general, but I think as far a reality TV goes, it's -- it's -- you're watching someone who's actually, um -- you know, real life person, um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- doing something -- some sort of, I guess, challenge.
R:  Right.
L:  Rea- -- Survivor's a challenge --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to do something or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or survive on an island or something.
R:  Mhm.  [MN] 
L:  Doing something that everyday people can do.
R:  Right.  And another thing I think that's really interesting is that it's real time.
L:  Yes.
R:  And, um, it's like it's not, you know, taped ahea- -- well, it could be taped ahead of time, I'm not sure.  But, it's --
L:  You think --
R:  -- not --
L:  -- they're taped ahead?
R:  -- acted out.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's, like, "Okay, what's gonna happen?"  You know? [LAUGH]  And I think, you know, that is -- that has a lot a -- to do with it.
L:  So, you think people are looking for suspense when they're watching it?
R:  Yeah -- yeah.  And it's like it's not acted out, so it's, like, "Okay, what's gonna happen next?"  And they're just, you know, thinking and hoping and, ah, p- probably wishing that, you know, something out of the ordinary happens.
L:  Okay.
R:  You know?  And, ah, I -- you know, it's -- it's a form of entertainment, of course, just like, you know, all the rest of it.  But then, I think this one is a little bit more intriguing, um, because y- you just don't know what's gonna happen. [NOISE] 
L:  Okay.  I just -- I just -- I -- from what I could --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- see of Survivor -- and, um, I've seen -- I guess I saw the last piece of The Bachelor --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which is a reality show.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Um, I was over at a friend's house.  They were all kind of watching --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the end of it.  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they were very caught up in the whole reality of it, and yelling and screaming at the --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- TV set.  And -- and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "Don't chose this, and do that, and do that".  And I just --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- thought it was -- you know, "This is somebody else, it's not you".
R:  Right.
L:  "Why are you so involved?"
R:  Right.
L:  "Don't you have other things to keep you busy?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I -- I usually have other things to keep me busy.  Um --
R:  Right.
L:  And I -- I do watch TV.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm not gonna say that I'm a huge fan of TV, but I watch TV.  But I don't watch reality TV because I think there's enough going on in the world that's real.
R:  Right -- right -- right.
L:  There's enough that you see every day that's -- that's so real, especially with, um, you know, the reporting and things up close and in your face.  There's enough reality --
R:  Right.
L:  -- on day to day life and --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- just getting through that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- other than watching other people who aren't like you and I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- getting through a show.  It -- it's --
R:  Yeah,
L:  Um, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- whatsoever.
R:  I don't know.  I -- I guess I think it's, um, just really intriguing to some people.  You know, and there's, like "Oh my God, I gotta get home.  N- -- you know, to watch this" and they make sure they watch it.  Some people, if they miss it, they tape it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, to make sure they don't miss anything.  But it's almost like a soap opera.
L:  Well, yes.
R:  Almost.  You know, you --
L:  Almost, in a sense --
R:  -- wanna --
L:  -- but it is real. [LAUGH]  So, I mean, with -- if --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's a soap opera --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know it's a complete fantasy.  And, you know, you've got the drama, you've got the music, you've got -- 
R:  Right.
L:  You can sort of +predict on soap operas what's going on, but with reality TV I -- I would presume that, they feel like it's very unpredictable.
R:  Yeah.  But I feel like it's more like a soap opera in that, you know, you're caught up in it.  Um, when you're -- when -- after the show is over you gotta call -- you know, "Girl, did you see that?"  Or, it's the topic at work every day, "Okay, what happened?  I missed, you know, Survivor last night.  What happened?"  You know?  And in that respect I think it's like a soap opera, [LAUGH] you know?  'Cause I'm sure a lot of people discuss it.
L:  Oh, a lot of people do discuss it.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [MN] Well, I have a female -- all female office, so --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- they're -- they're constantly discussing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- different reality shows that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- happen.  And I -- in a -- in a way I feel left out.  In a way I just kind of listen to them go and forth, and the banter that goes back and forth.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And at some points I think it's absolutely ridiculous.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] You know, I saw that last night and it wasn't reality TV.
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  So, it's, ah -- I -- I guess it's a cop- -- a common ground for a lot of people as well.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know if people have gotten together before on other TV shows --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and -- and talked basically about what happened, other than soap operas.
R:  Right
L:  But, I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- guess reality TV has something for everyone.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's more like common ground --
R:  Mhm -- Mhm.
L:  -- which is very interesting.
R:  Right -- right.  So -- I don't know.  Um, it makes me even just want to look at an episode, just so -- you know, 'cause -- you know, they picked this topic for some reason.  So, it makes me wanna even just look an episode to just see what's going on.
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  You know? [LAUGH]  
L:  That's more peer pressure. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You know?  But, it's not something, you know, that I think I would get hooked up in.  You know, I'd just -- all my time is, you know -- I have to weigh things out here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But -- but, I think another reason why, um, I don't watch TV like I should -- it's because I don't know how to get away from it.  You know, you watch these shows and then the next one come on, and then the next one come on.  And before I know it, I'm up at one or two o'clock in the morning --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- 'cause it's, like, "Oh my God, this -- the previews look so good I just gotta watch it".
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it's like, um, I'm just undisciplined in that area, so it's, like, "Okay, it's better for me just to stay away for right now", you know.
L:  Well, wh- when you say that the previews look so good then you obviously have an interest in watching what's going on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  So, they --
R:  Yeah, I do.
L:  It -- it would hook you if it -- if -- if you --
R:  Oh -- oh, no doubt -- no doubt. [LAUGH]  It's not that I don't have it; it just is that I don't know how to control it -- [LAUGH] control it.  And -- and I just -- like I say, I find myself -- I'm [inaudible] show after show, after show, after show, for hours, 'cause you really can do it for hours.
L:  Okay.
R:  Become a TV junkie.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, [LIPSMACK] that's um -- for me it's better right now to kind of spend my time a little wisely elsewhere.  Um, but I'm sure I'll get back to it, and I'll probably get sucked right back into the same thing.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Well --
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  If they -- if they -- if they do something that's probably very intriguing to me, or within my field -- I did watch, and it -- I -- I would presume its PBS's version of reality TV.  They --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- have a show on called, um, Manor -- The Manor House --
R:  Oh, okay,
L:  -- or Manor House, um --
R:  Mhm -- mhm. 
L:  -- for the last three evenings.  And that's was intriguing.  It -- because it was -- they took several people, and they took them back into the eighteenth century --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and put them in this manor house in England.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And they had to live as if they were in Edwardian times, with, um, oh, coal in the st- --
