L:  Hi, I'm Crystal.
R:  Hi, Crystal.  My name's Rob.
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH] 
R:  How you doing?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  This is very bizarre.  It's the first time I've done this.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  W- where are you on the phone from?
L:  I'm from Phoenix.
R:  Ah.  I'm in --
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  -- Seattle.
L:  Oh, Seattle.  Okay.
R:  But I used to live in Tucson.
L:  Oh, did you?
R:  Loved it.  Lived there for three years.
L:  Cool.  Yeah, it's beautiful down there.
R:  So do you watch Who wants to be a Millionaire or -- or Who wants to marry a Millionaire, and all the rest of this stuff?
L:  Um, let's see.  I watch American Idol.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, that's probably the only reality show that I really watch.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  I don't watch any of them.
L:  None of them?
R:  I can't stand them.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's cool.  In fact, this morning I was watching, either The Today Show or Good Morning America, one of the morning news shows. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they're constantly interviewing, you know, losers from Survivor or losers from American Idol or winners from The Bachelor and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's just -- the whole -- the whole trend with The Bachelor and -- and The Bachelorette really, to me, is -- I mean, I might have sampled it for thirty seconds.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I just went, "I'm not watching this".  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  Yeah.  I even sampled that new one, um, Mr Personality?
R:  Oh, with Monica Lewinsky?
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Because, um, it was on the same channel as the show I was watching before that, so I didn't turn it right --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- away and it was terrible.  It was the worse thing I've ever seen on TV.
R:  Yeah, I -- I actually slipped over --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I think, while whatever I was watching was in commercial.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And saw, uh, same thing, maybe thirty seconds.  And I went, "Nope, not worth my time".
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, they're really bad.  Um [LIPSMACK] but they're so much a huge part of the culture now.  Like you said, they're always on TV.  People at work are always talking about 'em.
R:  Yes.
L:  And so I'm kind of out of the loop.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I j- -- I -- I used to work in broadcasting and I just --
L:  Oh, did you?
R:  -- find [MN] television news now just -- it's [MN] infotainment.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and to call some of these things reality.  You know the whole Joe Millionaire thing which was a put up job, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I never watched that but you couldn't -- you couldn't get away from references to it on -- on, you know, talk shows or other things, and I try and limit my TV watching to news programs and sports and a couple of series.  Like tonight, ER is on. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I will watch ER.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, to me it -- it -- it, you know, it's cheaper for them to do these programs than -- than a sitcom or an hour long drama, which is the most expensive thing to produce.
L:  Well, yeah.  And they don't have to pay established actors.
R:  Exactly.
L:  So ...  And I think it's a lot of people who are really in it to break into show business.
R:  I agree.
L:  So ...
R:  And I gather this summer there are going to be a bunch more of them.
L:  That's what I've heard and they're actually, now on cable, gonna have a -- a reality TV channel.
R:  Oh, I saw that.
L:  Did you?  [LAUGH] 
R:  I saw that news clip.
L:  [MN]
R:  I went, "That's just -- that's -- that's beyond the pale".  Of course, you know, when they announced that there was going to be the game show channel --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I didn't think that would ever fly and the cartoon network and ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  I actually, occasionally, watch the cartoon network!  [LAUGH]
L:  So do I.  Yeah.
R:  I'm in my forties.  I don't know how old you are but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- now and then when Huckleberry Hound is on and I haven't seen it since I was eight years old --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's pretty entertaining.
L:  Yeah.  Actually they have some weird ones.  The newer cartoons are just -- they're kinda out there.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, I don't know.  It's kinda crazy.
R:  The -- the other thing about these so called, I mean to -- to call it reality program just -- it's -- it's wrong to me to begin with.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But, uh, but when, um, when the game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire was such a big success, and I think it was the same --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- summer that Survivor first came on.  I think that's the first one.
L:  I think so, yeah.
R:  Did you watch that, the original Survivor much?
L:  I -- I didn't.  No, and I found it very, like, um, I think I saw the very end of it, maybe the last show, because some of my friends were hooked on it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, no, I never -- I've never watched a whole season of Survivor, so ...
R:  Yeah.  And I didn't think that that would be such a success, 'cause that was very much a summer replacement kind of thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause, you know, it was a -- a condensed single shot kind of feeling.  But they've had, what, four spin offs since and I -- I, same thing, I don't watch them.  It's -- it's people, like you said, who are lusting after a career in TV or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- wanna be famous for fifteen minutes.
L:  Yeah.  And it's definitely not going to end.  I mean, like, I watch The Real World, I think, um --
R:  On MTV?
L:  [MN]  Yeah, a -- a few times, I was never one of those people that watched every episode of the season, but I'd seen a few of them, and I didn't think that that would last either and I think there's been, like, twenty of them.
R:  Yeah.  They -- they did it in Seattle here some years back.  
L:  Oh, yeah, I remember that.
R:  And, uh, I didn't have -- uh, in fact this -- this baseball season is the first baseball -- se- -- I'm a baseball fan.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  First season I've had cable since nineteen ninety.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  I -- I purposely went -- when I moved to Seattle in ninety four, cable was so expensive I just refused to buy it.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So I relied on over the air TV.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So anything -- I was out of the loop on, uh, all of MTV and -- and Comedy Central.  I mean, uh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the South Park phenomenon.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And, uh, when The Real World, a new one would come up, it got a lot of discussion and publicity here in Seattle when they were filming it here.  
L:  I bet.
R:  And I was completely oblivious because I didn't have cable.  And --
L:  I know.
R:  [LAUGH] And so I didn't --
L:  It's tough.
R:  -- watch it.
L:  Yeah, even now all of my friends have, um, the pay channel, HBO and everything, and there's so many shows on those channels that are so huge.
R:  Yeah and, see, I have cable but I don't get H. -- I don't use the pay channels so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I'm out on the s- -- with the Sopranos.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And Six Feet Under, which I gather are very entertaining programs.  [MN]
L:  That's what I've heard.  Yeah.  I haven't seen them though.
R:  Yeah, and what's -- what's the one about gay, uh, gay people, uh, Queer as Folk.
L:  Oh.  Yeah, exactly.
R:  And that got some good press.  I've never seen it.
L:  I haven't seen any of them either.  
R:  I guess you --
L:  I know they have 'em on video and everything now.  They're at the video store.
R:  Unbelievable.
L:  Huge.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  When I was in -- I lived in Florida for a little while and we didn't -- I didn't have cable there for a year.  And my husband's a big sports fan too, so he was kind of dying.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know, you learn to live without it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  He said if I could just have ESPN --
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, that's --
L:  -- and nothing else.
R:  -- what I always said, "If I could just have ESPN and CNN".
L:  Yeah.
R:  But after the experience of the war, I have no [LAUGH] no great love for CNN.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, and -- and I have somewhat limited cable so -- so one of the nice things I have is, um, Canadian Broadcasting Company.
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  So, I got to watch their coverage of the war more, and on Canadian TV they don't have any so called reality shows.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they do have some great new satire programs.  There's --
L:  Oh, do they?
R:  -- one called The Royal Canadian Air Farce.
L:  Oh, how funny.
R:  Which is all about current affairs.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And the other one, which is my favorite show on television, it's called This Hour Has Twenty Two Minutes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's -- it's -- there used to be a show from Britain.  You're probably too young to remember called That was the Week that Was.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they tried to do in syndication in this country, maybe, twenty years ago and it failed.  And it was just -- it was sort of -- sort of what Saturday Night Live does with their weekend update news segment.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I love that.
R:  And -- right.  And that's kind of what This Hour Has Twenty Two Minutes is.  It's a half an hour --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- show.  And it's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a fake newscast.
L:  Oh, funny.
R:  But it's based on the current events and a lot of it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- deals with America and the war.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, in the last month.  If -- if you, um -- if you scoop, uh, I mean, surf the internet --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you can pick it up on, uh, [LIPSMACK] they have replays of it on.  It's -- it's just W.W.W. dot twenty two minutes dot com --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- or it might be dot C.A. because it's Canada.
L:  Is twenty two spelled out or is it just ...
R:  Twenty two with the two digits. 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  Um, W. -- or the other thing is if you go to W.W.W. dot CBC --
L:   Uh-huh.
R:  -- dot C.A. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then you can link to Twenty Two Minutes.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It's -- it's very, very entertaining.  And -- and --
L:  Yeah, I'll have to check that out.
R:  For -- for people who can't get CBC over -- I wish that cable companies, you know, like it was very interesting to watch Al Jazeera, when they carry it on the CSPAN or they carry it on CNN --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for brief times. Where, CSPAN did a lot of during the war, a lot of other countries' news coverage.  They had --
L:  Mhm.
R:  --  the BBC news.  They had, um, the Lebanese [LAUGH] news channel.  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  To see the point of view.  They carried Cana- -- um, Canadian but also, uh, Chinese.  They carried the Chinese TV news.
L:  Oh, I never saw that.  See I watch BBC news, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- quite a bit.  And they did that as well.  On BBC they would show Al Jazeera and Jordanian news but --
R:  Other countries, yeah.
L:  -- I never saw anything from China.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's really fascinating --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- to get, you know, their perspective and a -- and a different point of view.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think the whole reality TV thing on American network television is just -- it's just junk.  It's not even -- I'm amazed the ratings it gets.  It proves that people will be entertained --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- by anything. 
L:  I know.  And -- well, in -- I guess that reality TV channel, they're gonna have a lot from Britain.  I guess Britain started it.  
R:  Yeah.  Well, I think, American Idol was originally a British show.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and the Who Wants to be a Millionaire game show was originally a British show.
L:  Yeah, they were saying that we think we invent everything but a lot of [MN] our ideas come from English --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- TV. 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  So ...
R:  And I guess -- I guess the reality thing has been somewhat big in Japan to just like --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Game shows have always been huge in Japan and they're very evil.  I mean, they do -- they do cruel things to people.
L:  Really?
R:  And, uh, uh, I've never seen any but the few things I've read about it, they're -- they're --
L:  They have shows like that on MTV, I think.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Where they, kind of, do that.  They -- they do mean things to people.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Kind of, play pranks on 'em and --
R:  These prank jokes, yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I'd be interested to see if the [SIGH] ones in England are a lot different than our reality TV shows.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I if I ever get to England I'll be sure to -- to -- to watch that but, unlike --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- most of my friends who spent last summer in Europe, I've yet to go.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  
R:  Never been overseas.  Been to Mexico a lot.  In fact, when I lived in Tucson we went down all the time. 
L:  Oh, yeah, I bet.
R:  And I've been to Cana
