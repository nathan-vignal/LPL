R:  Hi, I'm Melanie.
L:  Hi, I'm Heidi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Okay, so what's the question [NOISE]?
L:  It's something about Iraq [LAUGH].  I didn't really hear the question very clearly. [MN]
R:  I think it was about what -- what should the -- what should the [NOISE] US do about disarming Iraq [LAUGH].  Um --
L:  Well [LAUGH] --
R:  Okay, well, you know, I'm not a huge political [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  Me either but it seems like, you know, they've already gone in there [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  They -- they --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- have gone in there and -- and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they --
L:  It seems like Iran -- I mean, Iraq is disarmed, kinda [LAUGH], you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's a matter of like how long they plan to stay in the country, I think is more --
R:  Yeah.  And --
L:  -- of a --
R:  -- I guess they're still looking though, aren't they?  For --
L:  For like, uh, the chemical weapons.  Yes.  They haven't found those, at least as far as I've heard.  I would imagine that would be a major headline if it was found [LAUGH] so --
R:  They basically haven't found any of the stuff that they went in there looking for, right?
L:  Yeah.  And, you know, that kinda makes you wonder, doesn't it? [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] It does make you wonder.  Did you see, um, Colin Powell's address that --
L:  Yeah, that they definitely had a -- you know when he addressed the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- UN, I saw that, like, in the morning and it was, you know, the -- when he went to the UN and they -- he showed all the evidence and they were, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so sure that he had -- uh, that they had it but wouldn't it have been easier --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to find if they're so sure that he -- they had it.  That's kinda what I think. [MN]
R:  Well, you would think.  You would think.  It did [NOISE] -- it -- I thought it was [NOISE] pretty convincing, his argument [NOISE].
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  So did I at the time.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But --
R:  At the time and now you wonder, "Well, what's going on?"  So, I don't know what -- what the US should do.  I mean, because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm with you.  I think that the US is --
L:  Because it plainly seems like they don't want us there [LAUGH].  I mean --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know and all the stuff they're showing on television, that's all I have to go by.  I don't know anybody that's over there but it seems like, you know, they're just kind of like, "Go away".  [LAUGH] Like, you know, well, maybe, you know, we haven't fou- -- maybe we haven't given it -- had enough time to find things either, I don't know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, you know, it's only been what?  A month.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Two months maybe since the whole thing started.
L:  Well, probably like four or five weeks actually but, yeah, we went on vacation about this time last month so [MN] --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  And that's when it all started so, yeah, you know, maybe --
R:  So, maybe it just hasn't been enough time.  Maybe they just need to keep looking, 'cause I don't know, I mean, Colin Powell was saying that, um, that, you know, all this stuff had been scraped off the ground for, you know, chemical plants or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- chemical -- that there is stuff that had been scraped off the ground [NOISE] and -- and it had been just scraped really deep and that was why they couldn't find anything originally [NOISE] something.  Did you ever hear that?
L:  Yeah.  And I'd also heard that, like, even, like, when they sent UN weapons and [inaudible] in there the first time, you know, that it -- and they did destroy weapons, you know, in, like, what?  Ninety -- after the ninety one [inaudible] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- whatever year that was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that like [NOISE] [inaudible] I don't know, like ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, how long -- you know, I guess we're all being a little bit impatient [LAUGH] too in a way, expecting all this --
R:  Yeah, I mean, it's only been a month. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so --um, but I don't know I'm just really concerned because like they don't seriously want us there and, you know ...
R:  Well that's true but I'm -- I mean, think about if -- if you were an Iraqi --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- and there are all these military people from another country coming in and they're all armed and they're, you know, all over -- they're visible in the streets and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- all that.  I don't think I would like it either [NOISE].
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I guess, that's what I, you know -- no, I --
R:  I --
L:  -- wouldn't like that.  I know I wouldn't but, uh [LAUGH], so ...
R:  But, you know, they also -- it's so hard to tell, you know, from what the media shows us, you know, can you really trust the media.  It's so hard to tell because we --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I mean, that's kind of a point.  You hear, like, a thirty second flip about something and then it's, like --
R:  [NOISE] I know and --
L:  -- "Well, what's the story about really?" you know.
R:  Right.  And they're all trying to advance their own agenda anyway. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, some -- I think some media person somewhere has got some opinion that he thinks is right, or she or whatever --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- thinks is right and that's what they're going to promote.
L:  Yeah.  It could be.
R:  But, I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I -- well, yeah, I mean, we're not over there.  I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] Y- you hear [NOISE] some of them say that, um -- that the Iraqis are happy to have us there and then some of them are saying, "Oh, well, no, they don't want us over there".
L:  What's the majority though of the people?  That's what's hard to find out.  So ...
R:  Exactly.  Not being --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- over there.  What is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the majority?  There's no way you can really know. [NOISE]
L:  So, um, let's see, what else?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know, you know, and then like, you know, what happened to Saddam Hussein?  Where did he go? [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  Wasn't that kinda -- I mean, he's been overthrown but like can somebody -- can't somebody who's been overthrown come back into power too if they aren't able to locate them.  Is he alive or dead?
R:  That's -- that whole thing is just --
L:  Is he another --
R:  -- really weird.  I mean, they thought -- they thought [NOISE] they got him twice, right? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  They thought like they [inaudible], you know, that first night that they [inaudible], "Yeah, we think we might have got him but we're not sure".  I mean, it is hard to tell because, like, again, you're back to what you hear on the news [LAUGH], you know.  They say that he moves round and all types of things like that but --
R:  Exactly.  And, you know, I don't know.  I'm -- I'm not, um -- I -- I just wonder, you know, how much is -- is our government trying to hide from us too [NOISE], you know?
L:  Well, yeah, you know, I kinda, like, wondered that.  Like, why don't they want UN -- why don't they want, like, the UN inspectors to go back in?  I mean, okay, they shouldn't have anybody hindering them now, you know because there's --
R:  Right.  Or, you know, maybe they really do --
L:  And, like, our government said, "No, we don't want 'em to go in".  It kinda leaves us to look like, maybe, you know, working on the wrong thing [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  And then again, you know, maybe they really do know where Saddam Hussein is.
L:  Well, that could be [LAUGH].
R:  I mean, uh, well, I don't know, you know, maybe he's --
L:  I mean, there was a lot of talk that like he has the possibility to go to another country and -- with an exile.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  You know, I can't see somebody that power hungry, like, doing that for a long t- -- as a long term thing [MN], you know.
R:  Yeah.  But his family lives in Paris, don't they?
L:  I don't know.
R:  I think his --
L:  I don't know --
R:  His whole family, I think -- I mean, his wife and -- and children, um, I think they all live in Paris.
L:  Oh, wow.  I --
R:  And have for, like, fifteen years or something.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, they don't even live in Iraq.
L:  Well, some of his children did 'cause weren't some of those sons, like, those --
R:  Oh, yeah [NOISE], the sons.  I think maybe it was the daughters or s- -- I don't know [NOISE], some of his family.
L:  Maybe they were smart, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Go to Paris.  It's better like that [inaudible] [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I don't know.  You know ... yeah --
R:  But maybe --
L:  I mean -- I -- I guess, I don't know.  I don't know what their plan is, like, okay, it is, like, you know, they want to set up a new government and that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, are they going to go with what the Iraqi people want or are they going to go with what we want and think --
R:  Right.  Are they --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- trying to set up a democracy?
L:  Yeah.  You know, um, sometimes you only get what you want with that.  But then ...
R:  And --
L:  Who knows?
R:  -- you know, of course, we think democracy is great and all of that being in this country but -- but what is it that they want?  Obviously they don't want a dictatorship, I wouldn't think [LAUGH].
L:  No, you wouldn't think so.  They just lived through one.  They didn't seem too happy with it.  I mean, you know, they did knock down the statues and all that stuff.  That's usually a good sign that they -- they don't like the person that [inaudible] before but --
R:  Yeah.  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  At least --
L:  They can easily --
R:  Yeah, you would think but maybe they -- I don't know, there -- I haven't been able to watch the news lately but isn't there one person who they're thinking maybe would -- would be, um, a good [NOISE] candidate for [NOISE] leading the country?
L:  There's somebody that we have, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- picked out that, you know, I forget what his name was, last time anyway, because [inaudible] work.
R:  What -- what was that?
L:  They have like -- we have a person that they've kinda picked out but then I don't think that, like, the Iraqis wanted to [inaudible] --
R:  Oh, well, that's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- going to make a difference. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  You know, they're kinda like stuck, you know, "What do we do?"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, and how long do they end up staying there to stabilize [NOISE] things, you know? [NOISE] I mean, six months.
R:  I hope it's not very long because --
L:  Ten years, you know.  Yeah.  You know, [NOISE] that wasn't like the point.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  We're not there to run their country.  We're there to get --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- things going in --
R:  Right.
L:  -- right [inaudible] way.
R:  And they don't want -- they don't want us there and I'm sure --
