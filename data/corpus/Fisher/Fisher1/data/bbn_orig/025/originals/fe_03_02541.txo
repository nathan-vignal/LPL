R:  Natalie.
L:  Ah, hi.  Ah, my name's Heather.
R:  Hello.
L:  How's -- how's it going?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine. [SIGH]
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I'm calling from Santa Barbara.
R:  Wow.  You're way on the other side of the cont- -- ah, country.
L:  Where are you calling from?
R:  Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Pittsburgh -- Pittsburgh, PA.
L:  So, what do you think of, ah, reality television?
R:  I don't wa- -- I watch a lot of reality TV.  I like, like, um, [COUGH] -- I don't watch Survivor -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause I'm tired of it, [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I don't watch that one too much either.
R:  I don't watch it a lot, but, um, I watch a lot of, um, like, American Idol.
L:  Uh-huh.   
R:  Stuff like that -- American Idol and Joe Millionaire.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  I like shows like that.  I just -- I think they're neat 'cause, like, anybody can go on there.  You or I could go on there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, like, um, play -- you know, play their game, or -- most of them are game shows --
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  --'cause they win money. [LAUGH]
L:  I watch, um, Fear Factor.
R:  Yeah.  I watch that one too.  And I watch that one about the parents -- Meet The Parents.
L:  Yeah.  I watch that too.
R:  That's one of my favorite ones.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Are you near?  Like, do you go to, like, any shows?  'Cause you're in California.
L:  Well, I've been trying to get my, um, fiance to go on Fear Factor with me.
R:  Really?
L:  Do, like, the couples Fear Factor.  I thought --
R:  I haven't watched --
L:  -- that --
R:  -- it.  
L:  -- would be fun.
R:  I didn't know they had one for --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- couples.  I --
L:  I thought that'd be a little less scary, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you go on as a couple.  But, I don't know.  He doesn't really want to do it. [LAUGH]  
R:  Doesn't he?  He probably don't wanna go on TV. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  It would be a little embarassing, I guess too, to have, like, times where you have to eat ting, you know, that --
R:  I know -- eat bugs.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I watched it when they had on, like, the, um, celebrities.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, different --
L:  I've -- 
R:  -- celebrities.
L:  -- seen some of those.
R:  And they put them in this, like, enclosed, like, cage or something glass.
L:  Like, they had to stick their head in this --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- thing and --
R:  All those bees.
L:  -- it's got bugs in it.
R:  Yeah.  Did you see that?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was, like, "Oh my gosh.  I don't think I could last, like, a second in there".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, they have --
L:  Well, you have to think that you could win fifty thousand dollars, so --
R:  Yeah.  They won -- they -- ah, a lot 'em won money and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, they gave it to charity.  You know, they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just --
L:  Yeah.  That's true.
R:  -- did it for their charity.  But they make a lot of money anyway, so --
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] But I watch that.  I watch a lot of those shows.  I -- I don't like Survivor any more 'cause I think it's getting too old.
L:  Yeah.  Well, they're on, like, their -- their forth mission or whatever now, I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they all get so kind of mean too, I think.
R:  Yeah.  They're acting kind of petty about stuff.
L:  Like --
R:  [MN] Well, I've -- I always watched Real World too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The Real World.
L:  I watch that.
R:  I watch it.  I don't watch it anymore, but I watched it, like, when it first came out.  I really enjoyed it.
L:  I think that's kind of where it started to get, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- popular.
R:  That's -- 
L:  MTV started --
R:  -- I think -- 
L:  -- it all.
R:  -- it -- it came, like, a big fad.
L:  Oh.
R:  Now it's, like, everybody.  And they have, like, a reality -- and they're coming out with new ones, like, all the time.  I read about them in Entertainment Weekly.
L:  What do you think of that -- um, that spring break movie that they made?
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Do you think --
R:  I heard --
L:  -- that'll be --
R:  -- about --
L:  -- popular?
R:  -- and I heard it was dumb.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I heard about it on [MN] E Entertainment, [LIPSMACK] the E channel.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  [LIPSMACK] On there, so -- and the people said that they saw it for free, 'cause I guess -- so they can, like -- for marketing reasons I guess.  And they said that they would never pay a penny for it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I think there's a difference between, like, you can watch it on television and paying, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- eight bucks to go watch.
R:  Yeah.  I just think it's kind of -- gonna be a big flop.  It's gonna be, like, one of those movies that's probably in the movie theater for maybe for two weeks and then it's [LAUGH] -- it's gone. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [MN] 
R:  [LAUGH] But, it's -- I think I -- I -- I don't -- I probably would just rent it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That'd be one of the ones I would rent.  But, I -- I enjoy some of it.  I watch American Idol, ah, because I -- it's not really reality, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's funny.  Do you watch that?
L:  I watch that a little bit.
R:  I just watch it at the beginning 'cause Simon's so rude to all the [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  I feel sorry for them though, you know.
R:  I do too.  He's ru- --
L:  They're out there singing their hearts out and --
R:  Yeah.  He's really mean to those people.  And then, in order to get to him -- I read this in a magazine -- you have to, like, go through all these interviews to get on the TV.  You have to go through other people.
L:  Yeah.  Huh.
R:  You have to sing to other people, so they might have stunk, like, to -- I mean, they might have stunk to -- like, whenever they got to, like, the TV part --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, they might've -- they might've been really good, like, before they --
L:  Yeah.  I imagine that some people have stage fright, you know?  They could be really good singers, but then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they just get too nervous.
R:  I have stage fright. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah?  Are you a singer?
R:  Yeah.  No, I don't sing.  I tried out for a couple of, like, plays and stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when I was in high school, and when I was in college.  And then I just, mm -- I just -- fed up.  I never got the part.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I said, " [inaudible] with that.  I'm not --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- gonna take no more chances".  I'm just gonna -- I'm just gonna, um, do other things. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I do -- I do like other stuff, and there's all been a lot of things.
L:  Well, have you ever thought about going on one of the shows?
R:  You now what?  I tried out for of them.  I tried out for, um -- [PAUSE] um, which one came to our thing -- Blind Date. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] They came to wh- -- the, um -- did you ever watch Blind Date?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- they came to, um, the place by our -- where I work at -- at this little bar.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  I always think about trying.  I just went for the heck of it.  I thought, "Oh, I'm just gonna go".  And there -- there was so many people there.
L:  Wow.
R:  And they only chose, like -- I think -- I live in Pittsburgh, PA --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's not big, but -- it's, like, not regarded as a big city.
L:  Really?  I always thought it was a big city.
R:  Did you?
L:  No, it's not, huh?
R:  I mean, but they always, like, say Pittsburgh's a bad city 'cause it gets a bad rap.
L:  Oh.
R:  So they, like, -- they, like, said they, um, don't -- when the game shows come and pick people --'cause I go -- I went a couple a times to, like -- I went for The Weakest Link.  I -- I tried out for that.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  Yeah.  And --
L:  You must be pretty good with trivia and stuff.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I was pretty good, but they ask you a lot of questions, like, they --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- ask you all kinds of stuff before th- take you in.  And you have to, like answer all these questions right, and then you have to go and -- they only pick, like, two people from the whole area.
L:  Oh -- oh.
R:  And then they fly you -- [LIPSMACK] fly you to California.  But, like, they pick, like, only two people and you have to answer everything, like, perfectly.  And I think the guy that answered the questions the -- the perfect -- he was a doctor.
L:  Oh.
R:  And he said, "Oh I should be up at the hospital, but I decided to come down here and, you know, try for The Weakest Link, and I left and everybody was so mad". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And we were, like, "You should get out there and just do your doctoring", 'cause he was smart, you know -- a doctor.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, [LIPSMACK] it was fun.  It was go- -- you know, it's a neat experience.  But, for The Bachelorette they -- I mean, not The Bachelorette, the, um -- The Bachelor, that came too. 
L:  Really?
R:  The Bachelor -- The Bachelor --
L:  None of these places come to my area.  I'm s- -- I'm sure they go to LA a lot, but --
R:  Really?  They don't?
L:  -- they don't come out --
R:  Are you near --
L:  -- to Santa Barbara.
R:  -- near there?
L:  I'm, like, an hour a half.
R:  Really?
L:  So, maybe they figure that you -- you should just --
R:  My cousin --
L:  -- drive to LA.
R:  -- lives -- my cousin always told me Santa Barbara's beautiful.
L:  It's really nice weather.
R:  Is it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, we're getting that weather now -- we've just had beautiful weather.
L:  That's cool.
R:  But, um, my cousin -- actually she lives in Long Beach.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, I go -- oh, she's, like, "Oh, you know" -- I wanna go out and visit her and she's, like, "Oh, you know, California's beautiful when" -- I went out there a while ago, to San Francisco.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And that's the fartherest -- and it was cold.
L:  Oh.
R:  I wasn't prepared for it.  I, like, brought all these sh- shirts -- shorts.  I was, like, "Oh, it's California.  It's gonna be hot" and I guess San Francisco's, like sixty. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It's weird.  Like, it can get cold.  Never, like, very cold, but sometimes we'll have, like, really sunny days, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in the middle of January and February.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, we do have days like that.
R:  They do.  They have a couple of days, but it's, like -- [LIPSMACK] the people at the hotel are, like, "Oh, it's all cold out here", you know.  
L:  San Francisco's cooler though.
R:  Yeah.  I think that's 'cause it's, like, north.
L:  It's the --
R:  Northern.
L:  -- northern California, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause I actually just yest- -- two days ago I talked to somebody from Seattle on this phone project.
L:  Yeah?
R:  And she was, like, "Oh, it's cold up here.  It's raining".
L:  Oh, yeah.  Seattle's always raining.
R:  Yeah.  She says --
L:  That what I hear.
R:  -- it's raining, but she likes it.  She says, "I love it here.  I wouldn't move for anything".
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  I'm talking to people.  I talked to another guy in California [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- on this phone thing project.  I saw it on the internet.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  Did you see it on the internet?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And thought, "Oh, that'd be neat".
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like, I look on the internet for surveys and stuff.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  Do you?
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I think it's a good way to make some extra money.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's my little secret. [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I, like, go on there and look and see what they have and --
