L:  Hi, my name's Ricardo.
R:  Hi, I'm Sandy Greenall.  How are you?
L:  Hi, Sandy.  Uh, okay, so, the topic was, uh -- what was the topic, uh, something about Iraq?
R:  Yeah.  To -- should, uh, we disa- disarm Iraq?
L:  Yeah.  Well, so, what do you think about that?
R:  I think we should
L:  You think we shou- -- we should?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You think that, uh, the cause is worthwhile and, uh, you know, the -- the bloodshed and all that?
R:  Pardon?
L:  I said do you think the cause is worthwhile considering, you know, the, uh -- Saddam Hussein dies [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  What do you think?
L:  Uh, some way -- yeah.  Some ways I think it was.  I mean, uh, Saddam had to go, you know.
R:  Yeah.  He does.
L:  But, yeah, he had to go but, uh, the response we're getting from, uh -- w- what do you call 'em?  The, uh -- the, uh -- the Shiite Muslims or whatever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, the response we're getting from them, you know, they're like -- it's really negative.  I guess, maybe after -- after they can settle down, they get the electricity and everything getting going, well, maybe they change -- you know, they change --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- their heart.  But right now what's confusing going on they're kind of like, I think, unthankful.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.  All the time.
L:  And then they're firing on the troops and, um, you know --
R:  Yeah.  Saddam --
L:  -- troops are firing --
R:  -- uses all the --
L:  -- back.
R:  -- people for shields.  Yeah.
L:  And it just makes -- it makes the whole situation worse, you know.
R:  Yeah.  It does.
L:  Yeah.  Because those troops over there they -- they just came off fighting mode and now they're peace keepers.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's kind -- that's kinda hard to -- to turn and switch like that, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  As soon as they see a gun, you know, they're ready to -- like, they're still revved up.  They're ready to start shooting back.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  People die for like -- they might -- they might shoot at soldiers and then they'll go into -- th- they'll go into the crowd.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's -- it's real wacky over there.  It's real wacky.
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Yeah.  But they should be, uh -- they should be a little bit more thankful.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  'Cause the stuff they're doing in this last month they haven't been able to do, like -- I don't know.  Guess what?  How many years, uh --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- thirty something years.
R:  Yeah.  A long time.
L:  Yeah.  They haven't been able to protest.  They haven't been able to, uh, do the -- go to the mosque like they did.
R:  Oh, I know it.
L:  The pilgrimage they did where they beat theirself up and everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And when they would do all that stuff and they should be more thankful, I think.
R:  Yeah.  So if we're help building Iraq -- rebuilding it.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And spread -- I hope this government they put in I hope it's, uh -- it's a multi government where everybody's, uh, you know, on -- on trial and people are included, you know.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.
L:  Yeah.  So, um, so, it won't be too much -- it wo- -- it won't be like Iran.  I mean, um, Afghanistan.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, 'cause that's a mess now too.
R:  Oh, yeah.  It is.
L:  Yeah.  The United States gotta really, uh -- sort of world that, you know, they could get this together.
R:  Yeah.  You gotta take care of Afghanistan and Iraq at the same time. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  More so -- more so Iraq now because everybody's focusing on that, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  More so there.
R:  Of course there is talk that, uh, Saddam and, uh, Bin Laden are in on this together so it makes you kinda wonder.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what they say but, uh, they didn't -- they didn't get along at all.  You know, they -- I -- uh, the way they thought.  B- Bin Laden's more like, uh, what people call a good Muslim.
R:  Oh.
L:  Because, uh, he -- he follows -- what I mean by good Muslim is he follows, uh -- he follows all the things that Islam -- his interpretation is Islam's supposed to stay whereas Saddam was like, you know, he'd do what he'd wanna do.  You know, he didn't really -- wasn't practicing.
R:  Right.
L:  And like -- and he was a dictator and Bin Laden, like -- like him doing that so I -- I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Maybe some of his, uh -- his partners were like secret -- you know, secret chums with Bin Laden but I don't think, uh, he was, but, uh --
R:  Maybe.  I guess we'll never know.
L:  Yeah.  We'll never know, you know,
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then -- and then -- we don't know if he's alive or dead.  If they ever catch him then maybe he'll -- he'll --
R:  I -- I think Saddam's alive.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause he's a tricky guy.  He's tricky.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All those tunnels and stuff going on over there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Well, what do you think about all that money they found over there?  Stacks of, uh -- billions of dollars of American currency.  What do you think about that?
R:  I didn't hear about that.
L:  Oh, no?
R:  No.
L:  Like -- like, some of those [COUGH] -- the houses that the soldiers went into they found like, uh -- one house they found like, um, uh, so many million stacks --
R:  Oh.  Wow.
L:  -- stacks of -- of American currency.  You know.
R:  Wow.
L:  And like -- and like s- -- uh, a couple of soldiers had, uh, put some up for themselves [LAUGH].  But they had to -- they had to turn it in or something.  Somebody -- somebody told on 'em and they had to turn it in.
R:  Probably.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  The f- -- the first one when they robbed the bank they found, uh, I think it was like three million in American currency.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And that's -- when that bank got robbed and then after they were searching -- you know, house to house, looking for different things and they came up with all that money.  It was -- it was up in the millions too.
R:  Wow.
L:  Sixty something million or might have been more than that.  Yeah.  I guess -- I guess, um, they -- they had stashed it so they could go back and get it, you know, when they thought everything was clear.  They probably didn't think it was going to last as long.  You know, with Baath Party.  What's the name of them?  The B.A.A.T.H.  Saddam's party.
R:  Uh, I don't know what it's called.
L:  Yeah.  The Ba -- Baath.  Baath -- Baath Party.  They've been running Iraq for long.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  They found all that money, you know.  And then that was -- I think -- I think, uh, the United States should have like, uh -- shouldn't have let that -- that, uh, uh, -- that museum stuff get away.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause that's -- that's really, uh -- they had some good stuff, good old stuff there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  It's gonna be hard getting that stuff back.  Yeah.  Well, um, I -- I just hope as time goes on, you know, and they get the government settled in and they get the electricity and -- and the water and everything gets situated, uh, maybe they'll change -- change their heart.  But right now they -- they like, "Uh, the United States are nothing.  You know, we still don't have electricity" you know.  Everybody's going through it.
R:  Oh, I know it.
L:  Yeah.  I just hope everything gets better.
R:  I just hope, uh, you know, now that -- well, Bush said the major part of the war is over with so maybe --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- maybe once we get the worst of it over with and get Iraq rebuilt, you know, maybe they can go back to live normal lives and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- eat and get their necessities and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Get the oil turned back on so they can g- get it back together, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Then maybe things will change but right now those -- those, uh -- those guys are not thankful at all, you know.
R:  No.  I know it.
L:  Then they got [COUGH] -- they got the religious, uh, leaders trying to -- trying to get back in there and, you know, first thing their -- th- their sermons is about anti American, you know, rhetoric, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, that's why they've got to make their move real quick so th- -- so those guys won't get power.  Then it really will be like Afghanistan.  When you put that -- you know, how -- you know, how they think, like the Islamic people think, they -- they -- they wo- -- they go -- they wanna go by their laws.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I know.
L:  They want everybody to go by their -- you know, the Koran laws or whatever.
R:  Do you think we'll ever find him?
L:  Uh, uh, who Saddam?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think eventually they will, you know, 'cause these guys are starting to turn up.  You know, all his buddies.  And, um, I mean, where could he go?  He's so well known.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  He's so well known. [MN]
R:  He's got so many hiding places, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Eventually I think they'll get him.  Eventually.
R:  Hope so.
L:  Yeah.  You know, him and his two sons, they were terrible.  I read a -- I read a book, uh, about his life.  What was that book, man?  This guy who wrote it.  Uh, Saddam -- oh, I think it was Saddam Terror.  Terror.  Something like that.  A big red star on the cover.  Uh, Terror.  Rule of Terror.  Something like that.  Saddam, Rule of Terror.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And they had like -- you know, how -- they had pictures of him when he was a little boy and how he started and how he got into power and when he -- when he --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- tried to assassinate the King -- the King of Iraq and he went to Egypt and, you know, it had his whole life story in there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  He was something else.
R:  I guess.
L:  Yeah.  He was a mess.  Yeah, but I just hope that, uh, it all gets together and, you know, the United States prove that they can get a democracy over there, you know.  I- it would be a reflection on the other countries too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Rather than dictators.  They don't want the Islamic rule.  That's why he kept -- he kept all that stuff down, you know.
R:  Well, you know, if we did get Saddam there's going to be other people that's gonna follow right in his footsteps.
L:  Well, you gotta to have somebody that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that -- it kind of reminds me of -- it kind of reminds me of li- -- I mean, um -- what --what's those Russian guys name, uh, with the moustache that was ruling Russia.
R:  Oh, I know who you mean.  But I can't think of his name.
L:  He -- he looked like -- he looked like him too, uh, Stalin.  Was it Stalin?  Stalin.  Yeah.  He kinda like, uh, molds himself af- after -- after that guy, you know, the statues all over the place and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The moustache, you know, the way he -- the way he ruled things it's like -- like -- like he studied, uh -- he studied that guy well.  Stalin.  Yeah.  That was his name.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Joseph Stalin.  Something like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. [MN] So, this is a pretty good thing, this, uh, talking on the phone, huh?
R:  Yeah.  It is.
L:  Ten minutes.  Yeah.  I read it in the paper and I said, "Let me, uh -- let me see what this is about".  You know, little ten dollars for ten minutes. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I -- I filled it out [inaudible] and I thought, "This -- this looks pretty cool".
L:  Oh, you got it out the papers too?  I got it out the --
R:  Pardon?
L:  I got it out, uh, one of those city papers.
R:  Oh.  No.  I just filled mine right over the internet.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I just sold my, uh -- my old computer and I'm planning to get a new one soon.
R:  Cool.
L:  It was a big -- it was a big bulky computer.
R:  I need to get a new one here pretty soon but I can't afford one right now.
