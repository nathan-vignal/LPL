L:  Hi, I'm Tiffany.
R:  Hi, I'm Marnie.
L:  Um, well, I guess we're supposed to discuss about what the US is going to do, uh, about Iraq.
R:  Right.
L:  So, you can start [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.  Let's see, um, I think that the US needs to h- -- we need to have some kind of hand in there because they haven't -- I -- from my feeling from watching the news is that they -- the Iraqis from being under Saddam Hussein for so long the only thing they know is to do what he says and if we don't -- if we or the British or any other country don't step in and, like, try to help him along in a more peaceful or a democracy, whatever direction, then they're just going to keep going like, you know, a hamster in a wheel.  It just keeps going and doing what they've been taught.
L:  Okay.  So, do you think that, um, Ir- -- people that are in Iraq should be allowed to, um, continue having, um, weapons of mass destruction, um, once, uh, they get a new government established?
R:  Um, I don't think they do for a number of years until, um, we know that we can trust them more.
L:  I agree.  Um, I -- I feel that they should go in and I think that they should do a type of martial law and since we have so many problems with the people opposing what we're trying to do over there, um, and Americans are getting killed over there I think they should take away all of the guns, get someone from the UN in there to run Iraq and, um, make some type of government control so they don't have all those problems and so much looting and beating and fighting and -- you know, and everything over what we've ha- -- what we've had, uh, happen over there.
R:  Right.  I agree.
L:  And they shouldn't have arms.  They, you know, shouldn't be allowed to have arms.  Um, I feel that -- that we need to be running things over there. [MN]
R:  Right.  We just have to be careful about we're not seen, even though we're probably already seen as -- just like this anyway, like a -- like a colonial imperial power like we don't -- we shouldn't be seen like that 'cause we're not trying to like annex it, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But y- -- we need to have a presence but not seem like we're taking over, you know.
L:  Because apparently we must be a major threat if people are -- you know, are still shooting the Americans --
R:  Well, they don't like --
L:  -- and doing all of that.
R:  -- westerners.  That's the problem.  They don't like -- they don't like the west.
L:  So, is there not anybody in the UN, um, that they could get over there that Iraq would, um, feel less threatened by?  Maybe they should do that.
R:  Well, the problem is like other countries that would be potential allies for us are so embedded in the oil trade with Iraq and the other, um, Arab countries that they're afraid to do anything because they'd lose their lucrative oil deals.  That's -- that's why France and all those other countries in Europe didn't get involved.
L:  Why can't we just take everybody i- in Iraq, move 'em to Iran and Syria and Turkey and we'll just keep Iraq as our --
R:  [MN] 'Cause -- yeah.
L:  -- you know, the -- the United Nations oil.
R:  Yeah.  Well, the problem is --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if you put them all in those countries -- there's already plenty of terrorist camps and anti west sentiments in those countries, you know, and it's scary enough.  I mean, I spent a year living in Jerusalem in Israel and it was pretty scary with -- you know, with what's going on because they see there's a lot of Americans, a lot of foreigners, you know, and they -- any -- anything western they just don't like and it's not just Iraq, it's all the A- Arabic countries.
L:  So, do you feel then that Iraq should be disarmed for a number of years?
R:  Absolutely until the new government is shown to prove itself to be trustworthy.
L:  And who do you think should be in charge of, uh, this new government?
R:  I have no idea [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Somebody [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I couldn't tell you who to put in charge but somebody else [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  So, we should go in there and we should basically remove all of the rest of their weapons.
R:  Right.
L:  And what should we do with them?
R:  Um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- give them to our allies.
L:  So, we -- we should give 'em away to other people?
R:  Or just --
L:  -- that don't have as -- like, maybe like the Afghanis we took all their planes and bombed everything that --
R:  Well, I don't think we should --
L:  -- we should give them some?
R:  -- give them to Afghanistan but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] But give 'em to people that -- that we know are our allies or we should just destroy them or keep 'em for ourselves [MN].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  Or maybe even divided to the United Nations and we all take a little bit.
R:  Yeah.  But that's still, I think, you know, a little dangerous --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to -- to say, "Hey, Lebanon, have some guns.  You can point them, you know, at America --"
L:  So, do you --
R:  "-- take some more hostages".
L:  -- feel that what we've done, uh, so far as right or wrong?  Are you for what they've done, um, in Iraq?
R:  I'm a little bit -- I -- I'm kind of seeing it on like both sides of the issue.
L:  Are you number five on a scale of one to ten, ten being for the war and one being against the war?
R:  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm around in the middle.
L:  That's where I'm at too.  I see reason but I don't know if it's -- it's the paparazzi and the propaganda in America that's making me see the other side.  I was anti it for so long.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] But I do feel the arms problem is a major issue.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but then again I feel that they don't have what, uh, they said that they had, you know, I mean, w- why we went over there in the first place.  They never found all these chemical weapons and things that, you know --
R:  Right.  But they were a perceived -- perceived threat, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And also George Bush had to finish what his daddy started so that -- that's the other issue, you know.
L:  Well, we still have Osama running around.  We still have Saddam Hussein running around.
R:  Right.
L:  Now, what have these two wars accomplished?
R:  Yeah.   They just kinda put us --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- over there and made most of the world hate us.  I think that's what it accomplished [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Hm.  So [MN] --
R:  It's like a never ending cycle.  Like, even if, like, we get some kind of stability there some other dictator's going to rise up and --
L:  That's the way --
R:  -- start something.
L:  -- I feel.
R:  That's like -- there's such turmoil in that part of the world because they're caught between their culture and the rest of the world's culture.  Like, they're totally caught between being -- you know, being Muslims and trying to fit in with the west and that's the problem.
L:  Yeah.  Hm.  So, what -- what -- what are we supposed to do?  I mean, shall we continue what we're doing?  Um, do you feel that that's the right thing that we're doing now, just trying to kind of rebuild Iraq and just keep -- make sure that people aren't destroying it or, um, should we go over there and, like I said, go take all of the guns and all the weapons from all the civilians, um, you know, so that there can't be running around playing terrorists or looting or stealing or killing?
R:  Right.  Both of those ideas, you know, sound pretty decent but they'll alw- -- even if we take stuff away, they'll -- they could always, you know, get stuff from a neighboring country.  There's always contraband and stuff going on.
L:  Yes.  So, basically you're saying that if we disarm Iraq there really is --
R:  They're just going to --
L:  -- no good --
R:  -- replenish themselves.
L:  -- because they'll get more guns.
R:  Right.
L:  And more, um, arms.
R:  Right.  It's a never ending vicious cycle.  That's the problem [MN].
L:  So you think we're wasting our time?
R:  Um, I don't think we're wasting our time --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because as stuff comes in, you know, we're taking it away or however it's going to work, as we find things and take it away, so they maybe will get some new stuff and hopefully we'll find it again.
L:  So they can't get a surplus.
R:  Right.  So they can only hopefully get the bare minimum, hopefully.  You know, and if we keep finding it and taking it out maybe eventually, you know, kind of like, "Pavlov the Dog, look at the picture".
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  Hm.
R:  But who knows.  It's -- it's just really scary and, you know, it's just culture clash, that's the problem.
L:  Do you feel that if we disarmed Iraq that it would end terrorism?
R:  Uh, no [MN].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Not at all [MN].
L:  Um, what do you feel that they, uh, think we're going to accomplish if we, uh -- what -- what do you think they're trying to disarm?  I mean, do you th- -- they're just trying to take the weapons of mass destruction?
R:  I think so.  Anything that could do, like --
L:  Chemicals?
R:  Chemicals, anything that could harm, like -- destroy the land and lots of people, you know.  Like, chemical weapons, they're pretty scary [MN].
L:  So, you don't feel Iraqis have a cause in resisting and, um, you don't feel that they have a reason to fight for what they believe in?
R:  Well, I think what they're -- like the -- not like the government people but like the every day civilians.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, they're angry because I think they -- they feel that their culture is being taken over and they're -- you know, and they don't want their children to be killed, you know, so, like, every day Iraqis, like, I think they're angry because they see us coming in and like trying to take over but then there's the government people that they themselves want to take over the world or -- or take over -- or demolish capitalism in the west -- in the west so I think we have to be more sympathetic to the civilians than to the government people.
L:  So, what do you think the US should do about it [MN]?
R:  Like, show the civilians that we're r- -- that we're willing to, like, help rebuild their city like you mentioned before.
L:  But aren't we doing that and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- aren't they still like trying to kill our marines and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- fight us?
R:  Yeah.  Because --
L:  So, what can we do?
R:  -- they see us as intruders.  That's the problem.
L:  What can we do to make 'em, um, let us disarm peacefully?
R:  I don't know.  Maybe -- I don't -- maybe we could get like if there is Ir- -- like, there are plenty, like, you know, Iraqis living in America maybe we could have some of them be like spokespeople and be like, "It's okay.  We're trying to help you.  Look, we live here.  We're fine" you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, "Let the Americans help you".  That -- that way they have something to identify with, not, like, you know, people, different culture, different colors coming in and saying, "Hey, do what we say".  That way --
L:  All of the --
R:  -- it's someone just like them.
L:  -- Iraqis I've met are for the war.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, then, never mind. [MN]
L:  All the ones that -- I mean, here in America are for the war --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that we're doing -- that Americans are trying to help.
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  You know, I mean, like the guys at seven eleven, you know what I mean?
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're -- they're totally for it.  You know, they think that, uh, we should definitely stop whatever's going on over there.
R:  Because they probably left -- left the -- left Iraq to come here so they could live a normal life because Hussein was like te- --
