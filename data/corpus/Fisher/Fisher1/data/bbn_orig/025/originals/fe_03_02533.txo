L:  Hello.
R:  Hello -- hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  How's it going?
L:  Good.  How are you?  I'm Annie.
R:  [LAUGH] Hi.  I'm Alison.
L:  Um, so reality TV? [LAUGH] 
R:  So, reality TV?  Do you watch it?
L:  Ah, yeah I do watch it.  I watch a lot of it, and it's kind of sick. [LAUGH] 
R:  Really? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  Okay.
L:  What about you?
R:  Well that's a good match up because I don't -- I don't watch too much of it myself. [LAUGH] 
L:  No? [LAUGH] 
R:  No.  Um --
L:  I don't see why.
R:  I don't even know that it's necessarily I have watched.  I guess I've caught little parts of it before, but nothing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't think I've ever watched a full -- no, I have.  I've watched that one where the people go on the cruise together.
L:  Oh, really?  I don't think I saw that one.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, I -- I do watch a lot of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette.  And I watched Joe Millionaire, when Joe Millionaire was on.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah. I think it's kind of cool [NOISE] because -- it's funny 'cause, I mean, it's kind of like real life, but it --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- it's on TV.  And, I mean, it's other people's lives, and why do we care?  But everyone just seems to be so addicted to it, like --
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  It's funny, like.  Do you -- you -- you don't watch, um, Sorority Life and Fraternity Life?
R:  No, I don't. I -- like, I don't get that many TV channels at my house --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, really?
R:  -- 'cause we don't have cable.  But I've caught little parts of it.  I can't -- I mean, when it fir- -- when reality TV first started out -- when do you think it started?  Maybe like two years ago or something it started getting really --
L:  Um, I think it started with, like, Survivor.
R:  Yeah, I think it started with Survivor too.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]  Um --
R:  But, when was that?
L:  Um, that was something like three or four years ago.
R:  That started, and also what was that other one -- like, Big Brother or something?
L:  Big Brother.
R:  Or --
L:  And then -- and then, um, Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire?
R:  But, you know what I think actually was probably the one that started all of it, was the Real World.  Right?
L:  Oh, yeah.  The Real World.  Obviously that's, like, the fir- -- the Real World is really old.
R:  Yeah -- yeah -- yeah -- yeah -- yeah.
L:  They were the first ones.  Those are my favorite. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Like, I don't even think of those as reality TV any more, 'cause they've been around for, like, ten years. [LAUGH]
R:  I've watched a couple of them.  I -- I guess, like, the part -- part of it that doesn't keep my attention is that it seems very contrived.  You know, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  They try and elicit certain reactions from people, just so to make it entertaining.
L:  Exactly.  And you know what -- it's funny.  'Cause with the Real World they definitely do that.  Like, the Real World -- like, some of the cast came to my school, and they were --
R:  Really?
L:  -- just talking about their show and how that, ah, they -- like, they would show someone crying, but it wouldn't be about the topic they were discussing.  It was about something completely different.  So, they --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- kind of, like, fabricate a lot of it.  Like, a lot of it --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- like, they kind of make it seem worse than it actually is.  But, I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- think with, like, the -- The Bachelorette and, like, The Bachelor and, like, all those shows are kind of more, like -- they're real.  Like, you can't really fake that.  So, I don't know.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.
L:  I don't know.  I always find myself watching that and, like, Sorority Life and Fraternity Life.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know --
R:  It kind of weirds me out, but if it's on I would definitely watch it.  But, I saw this commercial for this one that really, really unnerved me, where -- I don't know if you've seen it, but it's basically -- this guy is set up with a bunch of different women to go on different dates, and they're trying to make him fall in love with them.  And he thinks that the premise of the show is to find true love, but the real reason is that the winner gets, like, a million dollars or something like that.
L:  Oh.  I think I did hear something about.  I had an -- I don't know if it's on yet.  I haven't seen it.
R:  Ah, but this poor guy thinks that these women are trying to sell --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- themselves to him because they -- they wanna find true love, and really they just want money.  It's so horrible. 
L:  Yeah.  That's exactly how, like, Joe Millionaire was.  That I loved the show.  Even though I could not stand --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- Joe Millionaire, I just wanted to see these -- I just wanted to see these girls and how they reacted.  And, like, the one girl -- I remember with the last two girls -- the -- the one that won actually was the one that was more, like, "I never grew up with money", and it wasn't, like, a big deal for her.  But, the other girl was all, like, disappointed when, like -- if she didn't win because she wanted the money, and that's all she was about.  It was so funny.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] It's so great. [LAUGH] 
R:  But -- yeah.  I mean, I guess there's -- when -- when that -- it said that the topic was reality TV, I was kind of, like, "Oh, I don't know that much about it, but I'll -- I'll try".  You know?  And then --
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  -- my -- my first gut reaction was, "Oh, something about it just bothers me".  I think it's kind of gross.  But then, you know, like, as we're talking about it I'm thinking, "If it was on in front of me right now I'd probably be all over all".  And I told --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how I watched the cruise show.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it was so bad and so stupid, but I could not stop watching it.
L:  I know.  It's so funny.  Um, ah, what was the other show?  Oh -- oh, the worst one of all, which, like, really made me angry was, um -- what was it?  Like, who has the best body or something like -- oh, I forget what the name of it was.  But, like, they would get up -- these people would get up on stage and they would have these judges, like, judge they way they looked and, like, pick out every little thing that was wrong with them.  And honestly, there's nothing wrong with these people.  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, who's to say that they're ugly when -- you know what I mean?  Like --
R:  It's horrible.
L:  -- who are they to -- it's so horrible.  Like, that made me so angry.  And there's, like --
R:  They're like --
L:  -- another [LAUGH] -- there's another one.  Like, All American Girl.  Like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- who's to say that this person's gonna be the all American girl?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, what exactly does that mean? [LAUGH] 
R:  Totally.  Exactly.  Like, what -- what -- what do you think were -- like, traits or values did they pick out that would be, like, all American?
L:  I don't know.  Like, they all wear red, white and blue on the show. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It looked ridiculous. [LAUGH]  Like, was that --
R:  I suppose the other one that they're doing -- like, America's Most Talented Kid, and it just makes me feel like, "Oh my God!  What are you doing to these kids?"  So sad.
L:  Yeah.  You can't -- you can't possible say it's America's most talented kid when there's, like, a million kids in this country, and you haven't looked at 'em all.  So [LAUGH] -- I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's -- it's ridiculous.
R:  But, I -- I just think it's, like, sad the way that they're conditioning them already, like, to get -- you know, like, most of 'em are gonna get shot down obviously, because who's gonna --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- be America's -- you know, they're probably -- there's probably so many of them are shot down even before the show even started, and -- I don't know -- it's so sad.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  And I think, like, a majority of the TV is reality TV now.  Like, I --
R:  Yeah, it really is.
L:  I [inaudible] think of shows of the type like Friends, that I watch, that isn't, like, reality TV.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I used to hate it.  And, like, this is so stupid, but I -- I -- that's all I watch.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's all I watch. [LAUGH] 
R:  So, why do you think --
L:  I don't know why.
R:  So, why do you think it's so popular?
L:  I don't know -- I don't know.  I think it's -- it's because a lot of people probably can relate to things on the Real World.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they see that other people go through them, and they're, like, "All right.  That's kind of cool".  You know what I mean?   But, I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- think it's 'cause it's a real life situation people are more interested, like, rather than, like, TV shows that don't really -- that aren't real.  Like, people are just, like "Well, that's -- that's never gonna happen".  But, you see these things happen on the Real World and Road Rules and all those shows.
R:  Except that --
L:  So --
R:  -- like you said, like, they try -- I guess, like sitcoms, like, recreate real life situations and kind of magnify them to make them more funny or more dramatic --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- or whatever.
L:  Definitely.
R:  And then reality TV tries to make it more, like, "Okay, this is really more like real life".  But just like you said, how they show that they're -- would get filmed when they're crying about something else, you know, and then --
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  -- they pop it in, like -- 
L:  But -- but -- yeah, but you would never know that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- unless, like, they didn't tell me that.  You know what I mean?
R:  Right -- right.
L:  So, like [LAUGH] -- make people think that it's real and they're, like, "Oh my gosh.  They're going through all this stuff".  And -- and I don't know -- I think it's -- it's crazy.  And that new movie, um -- that Cancun movie?
R:  I don't know.  What is it?
L:  It -- it's, um -- it's made by the producers of Re- -- ah, Real World.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Um, it's -- I think it's called Real Cancun or something, where they pick, like, ten --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- kids to go to Cancun.  And they, like, videotaped everything.  
R:  Oh my God.
L:  And they, like, just made it into a movie.  Apparently it, like, flopped, because like -- like, it just seemed so stupid.  Like, you could turn the TV on and watch the same thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- oh, man.  I was talking to my roommate about it, and I was, like, "You know what?  We should've totally done that".  I would've gone and sat on the beach and [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So funny.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I guess, like, maybe reality TV has the same kind of, like, pull as like when people -- you know, it's, like, maybe for Friends for example or whatever, you watch them on TV and you have a -- you generate an idea of what you think they're -- they're really like in life, you know? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because you see them so much and you feel acquainted with them.  But, then, like if you hear some sort of, like, tabloid thing, or you want to read People magazine or whatever, you can find out what they're really like or whatever.  And how --
L:  Exactly.
R:  It, like -- people on TV are, like, you know -- you suppose in reality TV they're not acting.  They're just really, like, being themselves.  Although I don't think they're really being themselves -- they have a camera following them around.  I mean --
L:  Yeah, exactly.  
R:  -- at some point --
L:  Who --
R:  -- they get comfortable with it, but I'm sure they tell them, like, "Okay, now we're gonna set up this scene.  How do you feel about it?"  You know, like, "Okay, we want to you to be upset", or you know, like, "That's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- not gonna be amusing for people to see, so you have to get -- really have a dramatic cry right now" or something.
L:  Exactly -- exactly.  I think that, like -- okay, I'm sure it's not completely real because people totally change in front of a camera.  Like, who wouldn't?  You're gonna --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- be on --
R:  Of course.
L:  -- national TV.  Like, why would you act like all you want is money from somebody?  Or why would you act like an idiot?  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, people, I think, do change a lot when, like, the camera's turned on.  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I don't think, like, most of the people that watch TV realize that.  Like, that it's not all real probably.  It's like a lot of it's more fabricated, but using, like, real footage and real --
R:  Right.
L:  -- people crying.  You know what I mean?  So --
R:  Right -- right.
L:  I don't know.  I -- I think it's crazy.  And I don't know why it's so popular.  I just -- it -- everybody watches it.  And it -- it's gotten way out of hand with all, like, the, um -- the -- what's it called?  The All American Girl and, like, The World's whatever -- Most Talented Kid.  Like, that's crazy. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah -- yeah.  I don't know.  Is t- -- yeah, I think it has a feeling of being unnerved by it, but knowing full well that I would watch every second of it if it was in front of me. [LAUGH] 
L:  I know -- I know.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  And it's so weird. Like, I hate it.  Like, I hate a lot of it, but I just watch it because it's so funny.  I like to see how real people, like, act on TV.  I don't know.  'Cause if you don't really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, we never saw that ten years ago.  Like, we were, like "What?"
R:  Right -- right.
L:  "What's that?"  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  "What's that like?"
R:  And then Real World -- like, as soon as the Real World was invented it was, like, super popular.  I know people who are always asking, "Oh, did you ever see the Real World when they're in such and such location?  It was, like, Real World seventy five".  And I was, like, "I don't know". [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I know -- I know.  It's crazy.
R:  And the people on it become, like, stars, you know?  "Oh, I saw that person from Real World" or, "It was filmed here" or whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's weird.
L:  It's so weird 'cause it -- they're just real people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that -- that were on TV.  And people are, like, "Oh, these people were on TV.  They're famous". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's just --
R:  Do we --
L:  -- real life. 
R:  [MN] What were -- what were the questions we were supposed to answer exactly?  Like --
L:  Um, I think it was --
R:  -- do you watch it?  And why is it popular?
L:  Oh yeah.  Do we watch it?  Why is it popular?  And, um, ah, [MN] just what sho- --
