R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um, I'm Stephanie from --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
L:  Hi, Stephanie, I'm Diane from Texas [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, okay, Diane --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you're the second Texas person I've talked to in this thing [MN] that's so funny.
L:  Oh, that's funny.  I talked to a Florida --
R:  Did ya?
L:  -- person the other day. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I had a -- yeah, I had a seventy nine year old man from Plano.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  So, you talked to a man.  See, I was wondering --
R:  Yes, I did.
L:  -- if you would -- if they'd put me and women together, like, uh --
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  And he -- he knew everything about reality TV, it was funny.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I couldn't believe it [MN].
L:  I know.  I like the reality TV one, that's fun.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When they were saying Iraq, I was like, "Oh, no". [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  I said, "Oh, I don't know what to say".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But [LAUGH] yeah --
L:  Well, hm, let me see. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I know, well --
L:  What's your -- what's your view on that?
R:  [MN] I feel that, um, [MN] -- I'm just -- I feel like we're doing what we can, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Everything we can, I think we've done our best, you know, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know if we're going to find the smoking guns but, you know --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I -- I wonder.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  So, but -- I -- I -- as far as imposing democracy on them I don't know if we can do that.  I mean, I'm wondering if they can accept it.
L:  Uh, I'm wondering the same thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm watching and they're -- they just don't seem to be, I don't know, acting the way, uh, [MN] I think -- I don't know.  They're just acting strange over there and I don't know what's the --
R:  Yeah.  I don't know if you can change a whole culture and, uh --
L:  I know.  I know.
R:  Um --
L:  I mean, I know they're probably glad Saddam's gone and everything but I just don't --
R:  Yeah.  I --and I really wish they would start talking too so we would [MN] hear --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- hear a little more, you know, about so people would get behind u- -- so that, you know, it -- it would look -- so, I think it should embarrass the Arab world a little bit and I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- think they need that shame a little bit --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- more too and --
L:  I mean --
R:  So --
L:  I'm gla- -- I mean, I'm glad we went over there.  I think we needed --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to because, you know, I -- I think they were somewhat behind terrorism and --
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  -- I think they needed to be taken out, you know, that --
R:  Well, and I think that -- I think that helped towards the terrorism because did -- did you hear yesterday they said it's the lowest point of terrorism since, like, nineteen sixty five or something?
L:  Wow.
R:  That's what they said and so I think this show of force is helpful, i- if just for a psychological standpoint.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know --
L:  Yeah, I agree.
R:  -- in that neck of the woods.  And plus finding all that money, I'm wondering if some of that was terrorist -- terrorism supporting, you know.
L:  I don't know.  Oh, no.
R:  So -- 'cause they -- they found millions and millions of dollars.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  In -- in, um, a kennel or something.  I don't know.  I forget where it was.  But they just -- and it -- I don't know if they've determined yet whether or not it's -- it's, uh, phoney money or -- but it's US dollars.
L:  [MN]
R:  You know.
L:  Well, I'll bet.  I didn't know that.
R:  Yeah.  So th- -- I think they won't -- what's the word I want?  Um, when you -- when you make phoney mon- -- counterfeit, you know, I don't know if they --
L:  Counterfeit. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] I don't know why that word --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- escapes me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So --
L:  It might be.  I wouldn't put it past them. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Yeah.  I know, so I don't know what they're going to do with it.  I -- I -- you know, if it's real, I guess then they're going to try and do some humanitarian things with it for the Iraqi people.
L:  Well --
R:  -- which I think is --
L:  -- they should.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um --
L:  I mean, I'm -- I don't know, I was kinda -- I hated that we had to go to war but, I mean, you know, it was something that I think we had to do and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I think our president pretty much knew -- I mean, you know, they know more than we do so, you know, it's not something --
R:  Yeah, I felt like I had to put --
L:  -- I don't think he --
R:  -- my trust in him and I was kinda glad that, you know, it was him I suppose as opposed to some o- other leaders I -- I guess, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  Um --
L:  -- you know, you think about the past, nothing's been done anyway so it's like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, I hated that it had to follow him to do it but, you know, you go- -- you gotta do what you have to do and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we didn't know what -- all that was going on behind the scenes and, you know, just as regular -- the public, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Right.  You know --
L:  But --
R:  -- and -- and, you know, you want it to be a deterrent --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to other -- you know, 'cause -- now, you do see people starting to be a little less cocky, the other countries, I notice too, you know.
L:  Oh, boy, yeah.  Now.
R:  Yeah.  And sometimes it takes that, it seems like.
L:  I know.  And that irritated me so much that they just wouldn't stand behind us but it's like, "Well, okay -- [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  "-- if you wanna ..." [LAUGH]
R:  Now they're crying. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  I don't know if they're p- pa- --
L:  [MN] Yeah.  Now they're crying [MN] --
R:  You know, I don't know if -- if Fr- France is paying -- paying it's dues or not, you know --
L:  Oh.
R: -- s- sanction wi- -- well, not sanction wise but economically, you know.
L:  Mm.
R:  But I -- I heard it -- I heard they were hurting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, i- initially they said, "Oh, this isn't gonna be -- this will be a drop in the bucket, you know.  Individual people not buying" but now -- but I feel sorry for the companies that aren't French and they sound French and they're getting slammed too, you know.
L:  Oh, I know.  I thought, "Oh, oh".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  A- and see the other day on our news they were trying to tell us which ones were French and which ones were --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, you know, not or the ones that were -- I don't know, they were trying to explain and they were like, "Don't --" because a lot of their stuff's made in -- in -- even in America --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.  And I thought, "Well, I don't know which one".  I hadn't boycotted anybody but --
R:  Uh-huh.  Well I don't --
L:  -- I know a lot of people have.
R:  -- drink -- I don't particular care for French wine anyway so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't -- it didn't do anything to me but now when I see it I just wrinkle up my nose --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know. [LAUGH] It's like, "Huh, see it's on sale, ha ha", you know.
L:  I know.  It's like, "Mm.  Sorry".
R:  [LAUGH] I figure it's on sale because it's not moving.
L:  Well, that -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think they'll realise that they probably, you know, made a big mistake but I just -- I don't know.  I'm kinda glad it's getting over with but, um, then --
R:  Oh, me too.
L:  -- in anoth- another sense I'm wondering if it is over. [MN]
R:  I know.  I know.
L:  Because the people are acting so strange.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  You know, I don't know if Saddam -- I don't know if he's gone or if he's ...
R:  I know, I felt -- you know, and I w- wonder if we should just do what they say and get out like they ask, you know.
L:  [MN]
R:  But then it'll probably be another public relations nightmare.
L:  Well, you don't want to fight if he's not -- if he's not there -- if we get out, um, you think he'll just come back, I mean ...
R:  I don't know.  I think people will kill him first, don't you?
L:  I -- well, I don't --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- know.
R:  [MN]
L:  I mean, if they were so scared, I mean, when he was there, I guess -- I mean, you would think they would but I just -- I don't know.  I guess they just do not understand freedom at all.
R:  I know.  And, you know, that's --
L:  I mean, I feel sorry for 'em.
R:  That is sad.
L:  I know --
R:  Very sad.
L:  'Cause I know they were excited when it happened but now they're all upset because we're over there and it's like, "We're not trying to make you America [LAUGH] --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- I mean, we're just [MN] trying to help you".
R:  But that is a dirty word to a lot of these countries who've --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- had power mongers.
L:  I know.  I know.
R:  I mean, just like, uh, term limits is in this country [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I hate to say it but it's like the ones who are powerful they don't want to give that up, you know.
L:  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  No.
R:  Oh, so 
L:  I understand.  I mean, I know they have some major issues but it's -- you know, we're just -- I would think we're just trying to help 'em but I don't know maybe --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, like I said, I'm not real big into politics. [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I try to keep ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I just try to know what's going on a little bit [LAUGH].
R:  Well, yeah.  And I -- this one's a toughy, I think, too because it's -- it's really -- it's almost unprecedented in a way, you know.
L:  I know, I know.  I mean, I was surprised how short lived it was.
R:  Oh, my god --
L:  I mean, they really --
R:  -- thank god because I have a friend whose sister's in there but they had her signed up for two year's worth.
L:  Oh, phew.
R:  You know, when she first went to Iraq they said, "Oh, your term of, you know, deployment is two years" so I thought maybe they just did that to get it over with right away as far as to make them prepare for the worst and then send 'em home in a -- in six months if they can.  That's what I kinda thought maybe they were doing it for, you know.
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  I don't know but they -- they held her almost to the end of the war and then they took -- and then she went into, uh, Kuwait.
L:  [MN]
R:  But they had -- they first took her over in Turkey and then that was -- you know, that didn't -- that fell through --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because Turkey had to -- you know, stupid.
L:  Oh, well, yeah.
R:  You know, so --
L:  [MN]
R:  [MN] But I hear she's --
L:  I know. [MN] They're really showing their -- showing their colors [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.  I'm going to learn more, I guess, when they get home -- when she gets home because I don't know anything about what's happening with her right now, you know.
L:  Oh, now, that would be interesting to talk to somebody that was really over there.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, a- and her sister's my age.  She's forty so basically -- oh, I hate to think I had to pack up and go somewhere at that age, you know what I mean.
L:  Oh, man.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, my -- my cousin is in the army and he didn't have to go.  He ended up staying here doing a job here but, I mean, I was scared to death for him but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I know he would have loved to have been over there probably in the midst of it but --
R:  Really.
L:  I don't know, I -- see, that amazes me.  I guess if y- --
R:  My husband was gl- -- was mad that he wasn't old enough.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That he was too old --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to go.  I said, "I'm glad you're too old, you fool" [LAUGH].
L:  I know [inaudible] [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Oh --
L:  I think my husband's glad he is like, "Oh, yeah --"
R:  [MN]
L:  "-- I -- I could still get called up for a draft but --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, I was like, "Oh.  I don't know about that" but --
R:  Oh, yeah.  I -- yeah.
L:  Mm. [MN]
R:  When you think about it that way too that would -- it's actually scary.
L:  I don't know.  I just -- I just hope that there's --
R:  An end to it.
L:  Hope they get changed over there.  I mean, just in a better way I --
R:  I just --
L:  And everything gets -- I saw yesterday that, um, some of the electricity they got back on and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I -- I guess, I don't know, the water's not getting -- that's --
R:  Um --
L:  -- getting worse and --
R:  I think if you give 'em better quality of life they will decide that they might want to, um, you know, stick with that, you know.
L:  Mm.
R:  Stick with democracy.  It -- it -- you get a better quality of life, that's what I'm hoping.
L:  Well, who did they decide to put in as -- 'cause are they going to have to elect a president or what?
R:  I don't know what they're going to do?  Yeah, that -- that I don't know yet.
L:  See, I'm just [MN] -- that's interesting because I know I keep seeing all these different people coming up and acting like they're the leader, I don't know.  I mean, I'm trying to understand it.
R:  Yeah, I saw a mayor or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] I --
L:  I'm going, "What?  Um, what you trying to do?"  I mean, I don't really understand.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't -- I don't understand really what is going on over there at all now.  I mean, I -- I can't make hide nor hairs of what in the world they're doing.
R:  Yeah.  I'm hoping that--
L:  [MN] I mean, it's -- it's [MN] you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it's better when it was all on the TV and showing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you every second.
R:  Yeah.  Then they were telling you seri- --
