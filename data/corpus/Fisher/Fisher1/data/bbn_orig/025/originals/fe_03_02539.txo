L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  My name's Lori.
L:  Lori, this is Eli.  I'm in Nashville, Tennessee.
R:  Oh, I'm in Dallas, Texas.
L:  Dallas?  My --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- goodness.  So we're talking about really -- reality shows?
R:  Yeah.  I hate to admit it, but I watch them, even though I say they're stupid.
L:  [MN] Do you watch them?
R:  One in a while.  I mean, I'm not hooked -- like, I have to watch every single show.  I mean, sometimes you see the preview -- and to be quite honest sometimes I watch it 'cause the people are so dumb.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] It's just --
L:  I don't --
R:  -- interesting.
L:  -- watch them at all.  I think --
R:  Did you ever -- huh?
L:  -- they're idiotic. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, and that's why they're so funny.  They're so dumb.
L:  Well --
R:  It's like a Jim Carrey movie.  It's so dumb you gotta see it.
L:  [LAUGH] But, what -- what the networks -- they get high ratings 'cause a lot of people watch 'em.  And one --
R:  I --
L:  -- of the reasons they like to run those things -- they cost them very little.  They don't have to pay for script.  They don't have to pay for orchestras.  They don't have to pay for stars.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, ah, when they get high ratings they charge a lot for the commercials.  And, ah, it -- it's most amazing to me that, ah, people -- of course, most TV stinks.  I like to watch PBS, and then I watch certain shows, like, ah, CSI and, ah, let's see -- ah, I used to love Providence, which they took off.  But, ah, which ones do you, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- play -- do you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- watch --
R:  Um --
L:  -- that -- that you think is half decent?
R:  When I had cable I watched, um, Real World just for a while.  I'd never follow them.  Like, I can't tell you who the people are on there, or what they did last week, or this week.  If it's -- like, if I'm flipping the channel and it's there [NOISE] -- but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, I seen, [NOISE] um, Mr Personality.
L:  Yes.
R:  'Cause that's just so weird.  Um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, who -- what's that, Bachelor and Bachelorette.
L:  Bachelor, yes.
R:  I've never followed the whole thing, so when they say so and so won, I'm, like, "Who?"
L:  Oh boy.
R:  I'm like, "It's just stupid" because I think it's so funny how somebody would do something like that.
L:  But, do you like to watch it?
R:  [MN] Well, I never watch the whole show I don't think 'cause I just look at it and I'm, like, "Why in the world are people going on national TV, like, I guess acting weird or desperate thinking they're gonna be famous for what -- fifteen minutes?"  You know?     
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's what it is and they -- I suppose they get paid, you know.
R:  Sometimes they get, like, endorsements or something.  You hear of 'em from ones[?] and I -- I just [NOISE] -- I think it's embarassing to them, I guess.  It's kind of -- it's kind of mean to say, but it's kind of funny to watch people embarrass themselves, I guess.
L:  Yeah.  They're -- but, they're making fun of people.
R:  Yeah, but it's -- oh, that one I loved was Joe Millionaire. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I thought, "Oh, how they just lied for that".  I said, "That's kind of --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know how -- payback, I guess, or the effect of TV.  It's just kind of interesting.
L:  Oh, he -- ah, I mean, that was a terrible show.  I -- I didn't watch it.  I saw him on The View.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, he was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a guest.  And, um, of course the girl that -- he picked her or she picked him, I don't know which one it was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, never ended up with him.
R:  Yeah. You ever notice that none of 'em do?  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, none of 'em ever got married.  None of 'em really end up.  It's just, "Oh, I wanna be on TV for a while".
L:  That's right.  It's a --
R:  "Let me -- let me con myself into thinking this is real".
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know?  It's like, "This is real love" or "This is that".  It's like, [NOISE] "No, you just wanted, you know, a little publicity".
L:  But -- so, what do you do?
R:  Ah, well, I kind of do programming and computers and stuff.
L:  You -- you're a programmer for people?
R:  Yeah.  So, it's kind of -- it's kind of interesting, you know, the -- since I don't get a lot of people interaction, I guess that's one of the reasons I watch those shows. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, yeah, so you can learn --
R:  [NOISE] 'Cause I'm in front of the computer a lot.  So I'm, like, "Hey, let me just" -- kind of is a temporary distraction for people or something.
L:  Yeah, because I used to be in broadcasting.  Ah, I --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- was disc jerky-- jockey. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And -- and that was interesting.  Oh, I've done a lot of things.  But, this is, ah -- these shows just br- bring a lot of ratings to the show and they make a lot of money.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But eventually they'll die.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They were --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just, ah --
R:  I -- I mean, I keep saying that, but then, like, something interesting comes along.  And that's kind of the thrill.  It's like, they keep topping themselves when you think they can't.
L:  Well, the last, ah, thing I heard is they're gonna have a channel with only reality shows.
R:  Oh, I know.  Can you believe there's a market for that?
L:  Well, they're gonna replay the old ones, plus they're gonna have their own.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I don't understand that.  I mean, I can't, ah -- you know, I -- I don't have a -- [SIGH] I get bored easily, unless it's interesting.  You see, PBS and then of course, ah, some of the Discovery Channel is good.  And you know I --
R:  Yeah.  PBS kind of has, like, things where they show the animals in their natural habitat.  That --   
L:  Oh, that -- that's good.
R:  That's kind of reality.  I mean, that's not rehearsed.
L:  But it's different.  That is, ah --
R:  Educational?
L:  Yeah, that's educational.  And you can learn about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- various species and, you know -- it's just nice.  So, you married?
R:  [NOISE] Huh?
L:  Married?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And what does you hubby do?  
R:  He's a programmer also.
L:  Oh, you're both programmers.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm here on the computer.  We had to get another one 'cause, ah, one that was five years old --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was getting a little cranky.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And we got a Windows XP.  I suppose you have that, don't you?
R:  [NOISE] Ah, well, I don't particularly like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- XP Pro, nor the two thousand.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They're still kind of buggy.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's just Microsoft's way of getting more money.
L:  So, what do you --
R:  So, that --
L:  -- what do you have?
R:  [NOISE] Ah, I actually program in Unix and Linux.
L:  Oh, Linux.
R:  I mean, I can get around --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Microsoft Office and Microsoft Works.  I know the coding --
L:  So, there's -- 
R:  -- for stuff --
L:  I see.
R:  -- like that.
L:  But, we started with Windows ninety eight and, ah, then it finally went kaput, you know.  So --
R:  Well now, talking of computers, you ever see that Big Brother show?
L:  No.
R:  You can actually watch some of that on your computer.
L:  Um, how do you do that?
R:  Like, live.  It's, ah -- you go into Real Player or whatever that was.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's, like, reality TV show.  I just --
L:  But, what do you, ah --
R:  -- thought about that when you mentioned computers.
L:  What do you, ah, pick up?  I mean, what is the, ah --
R:  It's kind of like watching the actual TV show. Like, the TV show kind of cuts it and splices it and edits it -- I guess the word I'm looking for -- to show you what's on TV in a half an hour.
L:  What is the --
R:  So --
L:  -- website?
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Is it an ABC show?  If it's an ABC or CBS show it's usually on the front page and it says, "Click here to view Big Brother".
L:  Oh, so you just dial ABC dot com?
R:  Yeah.  Or it could be CBS.  I'm not sure.
L:  Oh.
R:  And it -- it's just kind of, like, charging people to watch, you know -- it's the same thing -- reality TV show -- but it's everything.  It's not cut up, it's not spliced, or anything.
L:  Is it --
R:  and I thought --
L:  -- strictly, ah, on the computer?
R:  Yeah, for that one -- for twenty four hour access.
L:  Let me hit -- I'm -- I've got Hot Sheet here.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know if it's actually on, like, now.
L:  And I got ABC -- I hit.
R:  That's something I guess I'm interested in[?] like -- like, I guess [MN] y- y- you think they can't top themselves 'cause the last thing they did was so dumb.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You think people are gonna say, "This is so stupid.  I'm tired of this", and then they top themselves with something.
L:  So, the real reason you watch these is more for laughs?
R:  Yeah.  It's almost like a comedy show --
L:  [NOISE] Because? 
R:   -- 'cause, I mean, I'm -- I'm amazed that anybody would wanna do that.  I'm, like "What is going through your mind?"
L:  Well, they -- ah, they probably pay them, you know, ah --
R:  Yeah.  Well, at least they get endorsements or something.  
L:  Let's see now.
R:  Like, some --
L:  I'm looking --
R:  -- of 'em get --
L:  -- here --
R:  -- Nike or a movie.
L:  -- on the ABC thing -- virtual control.
R:  If it's not on, it might say something like, "Coming" and "Next month" or whatever's -- I'm not sure when it is.  If they --
L:  Oh, it's --
R:  They don't --
L:  -- not on all the time?
R:  Um, well, no.  It's kind of like a season, like every -- I think Big Brother's is every three months or something.  Or, I -- I don't know when their schedule is, it's weird.  So, I mean, the deal with Big Brother is they don't overkill it, I guess.
L:  Now, this --
R: Like, it's not all the time. Like, you didn't even know what it was, as opposed to some, like, "Oh well, this show's on.  I see it every single day, every single preview".  Big Brother's a little bit more -- I don't think --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they do a lot of marketing with that.  It's -- I think that --
L:  But, meanwhile, what we're doing is very interesting.  I spoke to some guy from Los Angles --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- last night.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know?  And tonight you're at Dallas.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then, ah, who knows what tomorrow will bring. [LAUGH]  It's very --
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- interesting.
R:  It's just -- it is.  The topics and stuff like that.  I mean, sometimes I'm, like, "Oh, okay.  That's an interesting topic".  Kind of throws you for a loop or something.
L:  Yeah.  They come up.  Like, last night we were talking about, ah, overeating or drinking, or what's worse.  And he thought, ah, overeating is worse.  Of course I thought that, ah, the worse is drinking, 'cause you can kill yourself and other people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But these reality shows -- like I say, it is so cheap to put 'em on the air that -- and they make a lot of money.  See, they -- they get paid, as you know, in TV and radio by ratings.  If they have a --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- high rating they charge more, and if the rating's down -- 
R:  Yeah, for the commercials and stuff.
L:   -- they charge -- yeah.  So, that's why they, ah -- they do this.
R:  And it's definitely like they don't have a shortage of people who wanna do it.  You know, it's not hard --
L:  Oh, man. 
R:  -- for them to find somebody.
L:  They have a thing -- I had an ad here in the paper, ah, "Models wanted.  Actors".  I'm seventy two.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I answered that -- just see what's going on.  And there's somebody in, ah -- down in, ah, Florida answered.  They made a -- a appointment for me here in Nashville.  And th- this is a scam.  They make you pay for pictures --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and they say they'll try and get you jobs.  'Cause I told 'em -- I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- said, "I have no talent really.  I'm just a ordinary--".  "Oh, that's okay.  It could -- do it anyway".  Stupid.  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  That's strange.
L:  Well, th- -- well, they have a lot of scams.  'Cause a lot of kids --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, you know, they, um, want --
