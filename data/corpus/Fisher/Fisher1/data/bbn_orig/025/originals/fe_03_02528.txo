R:  Hi, I'm Lasette[?].
L:  Hi, Lasette.  I'm Penny.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Well, this is a fun topic.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, it is.  
R:  Um, because see actually, uh, Wednesdays, uh, [MN] a few friends [MN], uh, and I get together to watch, um, The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So we have a lot of fun poking fun at it and ...
L:  So --
R:  I think it's something that we've kind of made it, uh, like a -- a fun night out with the girls.
L:  Oh, that's a great idea.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So you use it for your entertainment?
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  I --
R:  Yeah, I [MN] --
L:  I haven't seen that one.  I -- I did see, uh, the millionaire, just a -- a brief -- just episodes of it.  Not all of it.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, didn't care for that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at all.
R:  I thought, um, wait -- I know there's been two millionaire ones.  There's -- [MN] not the one -- the most recent one, right?
L:  Yeah, there was one prior to that.  I think that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the guy had -- was a bigamist or some- -- I don't remember --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- what it was.  
R:  Then all these lies came out later and ...
L:  Yeah, and he --
R:  And ...
L:  He wasn't a -- a very good person, I guess.  
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, and that -- well, th- the funny thing is I don't take 'em seriously 'cause --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I figure this stuff's not -- I mean, [MN] seriously anyone's going to [MN] stay together.  That would be quite a surprise because they're meeting under not realistic circumstances.
L:  Well, basic- -- you know, there's -- it seems like, uh, uh, TV now, I'll -- I'll see a lot of this, uh, reality.  It seems to be coming more and more popular.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, I -- I don't watch a lot of it.  I just hear about it or [COUGH] might have caught pieces of it when it first began and that.  That would be about it for me but ...
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- like, I only watched a little bit of that too, and I just thought it was everyone kind of, you know, trying to see how they can get back at someone else.  Um, just seeing people at their worse, you know, 'cause they're trying to --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- win.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know and I -- I, you know, what I wonder is, people that are doing this reality TV, They're being seen by millions and millions of people and I'm sure a lot of people know them, and can you imagine putting that, you know, [MN] that face in front of everybody. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I man, [LAUGH] yeah.  What kind of person is that anyway?
R:  Well, I know and most of us -- I -- I talk about this at work too somet- -- every once in a while and they're like, "Yeah, who's going to really think they're going to find the man or the woman or --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- dreams on TV?" you know.  And it's like, well I think they're probably [MN] -- some of these people, not all I got to admit from what I've seen.  Some --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- obviously are doing it for that publicity and, you know, getting all that attention.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, I think people watch it just to kind of feel like they think they're -- like everything -- those popular, like Jerry Springer, or anything else.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  It's so's if you're -- +you have a secret into someone's life and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, or seeing what people -- how people react in different situations --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- without, supposedly, being, you know, censored or, you know ...
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Do you think they're the -- the average American that are doing that though?
R:  Uh, mm, it depends I guess on the show 'cause I mean, especially, like, [LIPSMACK] they're -- you know, like The Bachelor and I think the millionaire shows, so they're going to try to find, you know, the upper class or middle -- well not upperness, I mean, but middle class America.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that's -- that's who watches it.  I was joking with, um, one of the girls saying, "Yeah, they should do one for the African Americans.  They should do one for the Hispanics.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So then -- while I -- I -- I know the Spanish station --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause I'm Hispanic.  They -- they've done some of the reality shows already --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- too, so ...
L:  Oh.
R:  It's -- yeah, they've crossed over there too.  Just --
L:  I didn't know that.
R:  -- with -- mhm.  They've done, like, a Survivor version and they've done, um, what is it?  Big Brother version.
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  And something similar to, um -- not the same, they kind of change a little bit.  Some of them, like -- similar to, um, American Idol.  Um ...
L:  Mm.
R:  Kind of a [MN] -- combination American Idol with, oh, what is it?  Uh, [MN] um, Big Brother, kind of, scenario.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But it's the same -- it's the same thing.  They put the pretty girl showing off [inaudible] nothing changes in TV.  I mean, that's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Sex still is the main sell I think.
L:  Yeah or violence.
R:  You know, and all that.  Or -- yeah.  Well, 'cause the violence would be or the extreme, like the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  There's one, Fear Factor.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  I've watched that.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I -- I --
R:  I got to admit I watched it a few times, too and then [MN] --
L:  Yes, I have too.  It's kind of interesting --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just to see how far they'll go.
R:  Yeah.  And, I mean, these aren't -- obviously they're picking people that will be able to -- are -- you know, they're kind of very competitive and they'll try --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- anything.  So, from -- you can tell by the way they picked them out.  Because if I'd be out it'd be like, "Uh".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  You know --
R:  I'm out of there.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the, um, very first Survivor show that they -- the -- they were having, uh, -- they had a newspaper ad out and -- and, uh, my mother sent me an application and you had to make your own video and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But, um, I had halfway thought about it [MN].  At the time I just thought, "Well, that'd be kind of interesting" but then they were saying there was rats on the [LAUGH] island and all these different creatures and I -- I decided, you know, what I don't want to do that.  But it was interesting.  I did actually think about it and I do have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- still have the application that ...
R:  Well, that's -- yeah.  I've known people that have, uh, also wanted to do that -- do the video 'cause they're kind of +adventuresome kind of people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, I mean, I don't know, I think it's -- it's got it's good and it's bad, I think, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You can't take it too seriously and obviously it's kind of -- it -- I think it's just a sign of what our society is about, the American society is.  You know, being --
L:  I think so, too.
R:  -- famous [inaudible] is the thing and now any -- anyone can possibly become famous.
L:  That's right.
R:  And in different ways, you know, and you just find your niche.  Which one do you think you might be able to get on and if you really want that?  
L:  Yes if --
R:  Um --
L:  -- that is your niche.  
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  And there's some people out there it is.  But I -- I mean I like the, um, The Bachelor 'cause I'm single.  It just kind of -- that's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- our little thing.  [LAUGH]  And we just kind of --
L:  I haven't seen that.  I -- I don't even know what that's about.
R:  [SIGH]  It's, uh --
L:  It's -- it's a lot of bachelors or ...?
R:  Uh, well, actually right now it's one bachelor and, like, it starts with twenty five girls.
L:  Oh.
R:  And then he starts eliminating and at the end --
L:  Oh.
R:  You know.
L:  Oh, sort of like the, uh, guy that got marr- -- or wanted to get married.
R:  Yeah, same idea but it's not so cheesy.  It's a little bit -- well, there's always gonna be, what do you call it?  Like cat fighting and stuff --
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- that goes on.
L:  Sure. 
R:  A little bit, but, um, they don't focus on -- on -- they try to make it nice and not, um, dirty and risque, like, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think that show --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I watched a couple of times.  They were --
L:  Yes.
R:  I think they brought in the -- the ex-boyfriends and said all this stuff about the --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- girls.
L:  Yes.
R:  I thought that was just low. 
L:  I did too.  I -- I -- I -- I felt a little bit of that and I --
R:  That's like a Jerry Springer version.
L:  That turned me off.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah,  I -- I --
R:  See that -- yeah, that's like a Jerry Springer and then, um, Bachelor is like an Oprah version of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, that show.  
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, it's like, uh --
R:  A little bit more classy.
L:  More like The Enquirer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Almost.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That, uh, some of the reality shows remind me of that --  
R:  Yeah, but I --
L:  -- a bit more.
R:  -- think The Bachelor tries not to be that way.  Oprah's like --
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, that's good.
R:  If you want to compare it to that, I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's not a hundred percent because there's still stuff that kind of goes on, but, um -- and then you also want -- hear later that the way they cut things, you know, [MN] you may be make people look worse than they are.  The way --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- they edit, you know.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  So, you're not getting a clean picture sometimes and --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- about what it really is going in.
L:  Oh, that's interesting.  What nights is that on?
R:  Uh, it's Wednesday nights.
L:  Wednesday night.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'll have to just take a look 'cause I -- I -- I haven't seen that one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I like to just take a look to see when somebody says something about it at least I --
R:  Have an idea --
L:  And say, "Oh yes".
R:  -- what they're -- have an idea and just kind of know what --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're talking about.  But, um ...  Yeah.
L:  Course then I'll know what you do for entertainment.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, The Bachelorette, that one was the opposite and that was fun.  'Cause it was twenty five guys and one girl.
L:  Oh, geez.
R:  Yeah, and we thought -- I -- I don't know.  There was different opinions.  It was fun 'cause you could get to see twenty five cute guys but, you know ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  And say, "Ooh, which one do you like better and ...?"  Um, so ...
L:  Do you ever watch that [inaudible] Date.
R:  [MN] Uh, I think I heard about that.  Uh.
L:  It's -- it's usually one guy or one girl and they're given, um, four or five people that they go out with and they -- they just, um, they just eliminate 'em through the evening.
R:  Huh.
L:  'Til they get down to the one.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  That's -- that's --
R:  Same idea, kinda.
L:  Yeah, it's kind of interesting.  Or Blind Date.  I don't know if it's called Blind Date where they set 'em up with somebody that -- that they, um, both of them send in their profiles and they set 'em up.  Those are pretty wild.  I've watched that.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.  I -- I mean, there's more reality shows than we even [MN] --
L:  You know, there is.
R:  I mean, I can't even imagine now.
L:  You know, I didn't realise [MN] -- I did not realise how many, uh, reality shows there are 'til I'm talking to you.  You know.
R:  Well, and then think about -- there's another one that I -- I realised it was reality after a while but I never thought of [several inaudible words] having reality show.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  It has, you know -- well, of course, they all are 'cause they're trying to fix someone's house and you kind of get to know the people and all that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So that's [inaudible] 'cause you kind of get to see different -- go into someone's house and, you know, help them fix it.  And then there's one that's kind of a dating thing too.
L:  Sure, I've seen that. 
R:  Have you seen the dating one?
L:  No.  No.
R:  Where there's two, I think like either two girls or two guy -- it changes.  And then they -- oh, they go into these -- these bachelor's pads and then one girl decides whose pads going to be, um, fixed up.
L:  Oh.
R:  And then they kind of have a date.  I mean, it's real casual.  It's not real, you know --
L:  That sounds kind of interesting.  That'd be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- different, wouldn't it?
R:  Yeah, it's kind of fun.  It's not real serious.  
L:  Yeah.  I'd -- I -- I think I'd prefer that other
