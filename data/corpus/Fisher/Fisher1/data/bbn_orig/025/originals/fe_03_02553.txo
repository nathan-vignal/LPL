R:  Hello.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi  -- hi.  We must --
L:  All kinds of automated systems there. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] No kidding.
L:  It's amazing I got a human being.  It, like, "Oh my God".  Normally when I call they say, "We can't find anybody for you now".
R:  Is this the fir- --oh, well, I should introduce mysel- -- my name is Pam.  And --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- I'm in --
L:  -- I'm Jacqui[?].
R:  -- Calif- --
L:  Hi. [LAUGH] 
R:  Hi, Jacqui. [LAUGH]
L:  This is only, like, the second time that I've done this, so --
R:  Well, this is my first. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  Oh, cool.
R:  Yeah.  It --
L:  Well, I guess what we're supposed -- well, I know that the other that I had was, um -- my first one was -- it was about current events, like war and stuff like that, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we kind of discussed that.  And it was, like, "Okay", you know.  It was her first turn, and mine too, so it was kind of crazy.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, um -- no, I guess they want us to talk about reality TV.  So, I do watch Survivor. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh yes.  Me too.  Did you watch it tonight?
L:  Yes I did.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I caught the last half of it.  I was, like, "Oh God".  I was trying to get home.  I had my little guy -- I -- he's four, and I had him out.  And I --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- was, like, "Oh, we gotta get home".  I said, "They're gonna get President Bush on -- it's gonna screw up the TV tonight". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, yeah, it was pretty good.  That was a throw off, Christie getting voted off.
R:  Oh God, no kidding.  
L:  Wasn't --
R:  Oh, I --
L:  -- that --
R:  -- felt so --
L:  -- bad?
R:  -- bad for her.  At -- and at the end, I loved what she said about, "I'm gonna get those two evil stepsisters".
L:  Yes -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes.  I was really shocked at -- at the way it's -- that it threw itself.  I mean, I never really get involved in, like, soap operas and all the rest it.
R:  Yeah?
L:  And I catch maybe, like, talk shows and stuff -- um, I watch, um -- what's the other one?  Fear Factor.
R:  Oh boy.
L:  That one's kind of grotty[?].  If you have ever watched anything -- they eat bugs and nasty body parts of animals.  And they had somebody, um -- some guys and some girls milking goats with their mouths the other day.
R:  Oh my --
L:  It was --
R:  Lord.
L:  -- very unique.  I was, like, "Okay". [LAUGH] 
R:  You know --
L:  But I never watch, like, The Bachelor, and Bachelorette, and stuff like that 'cause I figured, "Okay, they've got money".  I'll stay away from that, you know.
R:  I know.  You know, I don't find -- and I'm not drawn to watch those either.  Survivor's the only that I watch.  And just 'cause I -- you know, I -- I got started with, like, su- six -- whenever it started -- you know, six --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- seasons ago, and --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, I think -- 'cause --
L:  I didn't really --
R:  -- interesting --
L:  -- watch the first one. I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I didn't really pay that much attention to it, you know, but I watched a couple pieces of it.  But this one I've -- I don't know -- I'm drawn to it.  I don't know why, but -- I wonder who's next.
R:  I kn- -- I know.  I really wonder whether Rob is gonna make it to the end. [LAUGH] 
L:  Big Butch will probably be next, because he's the only one who said that he was gonna stick with the alliance.  I'll be so surprised --
R:  Oh God.
L:  -- if he makes it 'cause he -- he doesn't fight with anybody.  He's always so passive.  And I'm -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- waiting to see if he makes it.
R:  He's just like -- he's flown under the radar for too long.  You know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're gonna get him.
L:  And everybody else voted --
R:  But --
L:  -- I was so sho- -- surprised to see, like, Rob voting against Christie, and --
R:  I know.
L:  -- what's the restaurant guy?  Him too.
R:  Oh yeah.  Alex, or --
L:  He -- Alex.  He was voting against --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- her.  I was, like, "What is wrong with you?"
R:  I don't know.
L:  You got those other two crazy broads running around going [LAUGH] nuts.
R:  Oh, good Lord, tearing their clothes off.  I like, "Oh --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- [LAUGH] put 'em away"  No one --"
L:  It's gonna be interesting to see who makes it to the end.  It really is.  But, otherwise --
R:  Well, see --
L:  -- that's --
R: -- I think --
L:  -- about the only show that I -- I really watch.  I mean, besides --
R:  Do you --
L:  -- Fear Factor, and I've only caught that off and on.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's just kind of -- it's kind of cool to, like, these skinny people having to do these stunts and they're winded, so I don't feel so bad. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm about thirty --
R:  I think you're --
L:  -- pounds overweight, so I don't feel so bad then doing my yoga, you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] you're -- I mean, it's, like -- which is just a much nicer thing to do really --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- yoga.  Much more pleasant.
L:  Yeah.  It's like I don't have to eat goat parts or -- or what is it?  Oh, they were eating something --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- oh, balut eggs -- those eggs --
R:  Oh God.
L:  -- that are buried, like in --
R:  Why do you think --
L:  -- the dirt.
R:  -- people wanna see that?  Like -- like, what is that -- I don't have the --
L:  Money.
R:  -- stomach strong enough to watch the Fear Factor.  But why do you think -- I mean, like, you watch Fear Factor.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What is it that draws -- draws you to watch shows -- ah, shows?
L:  I think the challenge -- to see what people's fears are, for me, because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's -- it's like -- for me, it's like, um -- being, like, trapped underwater or something is, like, a fear for --
R:  Oh God.
L:  -- me.  And it's kind of, like -- seeing what kind of stunts they make these people do, or how crazy people will go.    
R:  Exactly.
L:  I mean, it's, like, "Okay, fine".  I mean, I've seen some weird stuff in my time.  I used to be a police officer, and I was a vet tech.  And I've seen some weird stuff from dead bodies, all the way into maggots --
R:  How [MN] --
L:  -- on animals.  And they actually had somebody eating cheese that had maggots in it.
R:  [SIGH] Oh man.
L:  And I looked --
R:  I don't --
L:  -- at --
R:  -- know.
L:  -- that and I had to leave the room.  I was, like, "That's it.  I'm turning it off".  I have to leave the room.  I didn't even wanna -- and -- and my husband's over there turning it on.  He goes, "Come here, look at this".  I'm, like, "No".
R:  Is it --
L:  I said --
R:  "-- like, "No --"
L:  "I'm sorry, I --"
R:  "-- don't need to see that"?
L:  "-- draw the line when it comes down to maggots and stuff like that".  I mean, I don't care if --
R:  I know.
L:  -- somebody wants to eat a grasshopper or an ant.  Far be it from me -- for them to be organic.  You know, that's fine for me.  But, they actually had them eating some rotten cheese with maggots in it.  And I said, "Oh, I can't watch this anymore".
R:  Oh my God.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That -- 
L:  I like --
R:  Oh God --
L:  -- to see what --
R:  I'd be ill.
L:  -- these people will try.  I mean, it's amazing what people will do.  I mean, here we're doing --
R:  I --
L:  -- surveys, and they're, like, doing all these weird --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- weird survivalist stunts, you know.
R:  I was gonna say, I think ours are -- like, what'd be our way of doing of -- of surviving, I think is -- it's a lot more pleasant. [LAUGH] 
L:  It is -- it is.  It's a --
R:  I mean, I can watch people on Survivor and admire them for what they do, but I -- in a way I guess it's sort of that voyeur factor there.  I know I -- I -- I could never do that.  I couldn't.
L:  I'd be out there scoping all the animals, saying, "Come home with me, come home".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My husband goes, "Well look, you'd go there, and you'd bring home a python and, you know, a boa" and -- 'cause we have animals and everything.  And, you know, I watch, like, um, the -- well, I don't know if it's considered reality TV, but I watch, like, the Animal Planet.  And I watch, um, like, Geoff Horwin[?] and stuff like that. But, I guess that's not really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- reality TV.  'Cause I just wanna see what's going on, like, with exotic pets and all the rest of it.  But -- or, um, what's the other one?  Ah, Animal Cops.  That's --
R:  Animal --
L:  -- kind --
R:  Cops --
L:  -- of cool --
R:  -- would be one.
L:  -- to see cops going out there rescuing animals.  It started out in New York, and now Detroit.  And Detroit's got a really bad problem with over- -- ah, overpopulation of animals.  And --
R:  Oh boy.
L:  -- they show -- the cops go out and actually cite people for doing stupid things to their animals, which is --
R:  You see --
L:  -- kind of cool.
R:  -- that kind of a reality show -- like, that and, like, Cops -- you know, something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that really seems like real reality.  I like -- I like shows like that because it's co- -- it's close enough to regular life.
L:  Oh yeah.  
R:  Now, when --
L:  -- Now -- 'cause --
R:  -- I see --
L:  -- like, with Cops -- 
R:  -- people, like, the --
L:  -- when we drove --
R:  -- The Bachelorette -- 
L:  -- through Tampa, I --
R:  -- and --
L:  -- saw -- I saw Tampa on TV, on Cops.
R:  Yeah?
L:  We drove through Tampa, and I went, "Holy God, everybody lock the doors.  It's just like on TV".  So --
R:  [LAUGH] I know.
L:  Yeah.  Cops is kind of -- I like Cops because, I mean, it reminds me of my days when I used to chase the bad guys.  And I always sit there and, like, "Watch him -- watch him.  He's gonna run".  And my husband's, like, "You're not on the job anymore".  It's, like, "He's gonna run". [LAUGH] 
R:  And you're, like, "I can see it in his eyes". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.  Now, that's not bad.  I -- I don't know.  I think Fear Factor's gone a little -- I think they've gone a little too far.  I don't mind seeing people do things from heights, and I don't mind --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- seeing people do some funky things.  But some of that stuff that they're doing is really -- it's gross.
R:  It's just over the top.
L:  They had them --
R:  And I -- 
L:  -- picking --
R:  You know when they --
L:  -- up dead rats with their mouths.
R:  Oh.
L:  And mouth full of worms.
R:  You know, I --
L:  And, I --
R:  -- I think --
L:  -- got a four year old.
R:  -- that these reality shows are really pushing themselves.  Like, I think they're burning themselves out, because --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- they're getting so extreme that people, like, "Oh good Lord, this is another -- some crazy show" --
L:  Well, look at that theatrical one.  That guy --
R:  I know.
L:  "-- lied.  He lied about who he was.  It's, like, "Are you so stupid?  Did --"
R:  I --
L:  "-- you need rating that bad?" [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I know -- I know.  That's it.  It's getting pathetic.  You know, it's, like, it gives an excuse for thinking up -- of more -- rather than thinking up more intelligent programming or being more crea- -- just trying to -- they're beating the formula to death. [LAUGH] 
L:  Did you hear they're gonna make -- they're talking about making a cable station where it's reality TV twenty four seven?
R:  Oh, give me a break. [LAUGH] 
L:  I heard it on either the radio or I gu- -- it had to be on the radio.
R:  Oh. But they --
L:  That they were saying they were gonna make reality TV one -- like a game show thing of twenty four seven.  I was, like, "Okay, that's gonna" -- they burn out real quick.
R:  But, you know what though?  That is a great idea because then it'll draw all those shows off the other cha- -- off --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- the other networks, and then you've only [LAUGH] --
L:  That is good.  I didn't think --
R:  -- got one place --
L:  -- of it that way.
R:  -- to get it. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Open it up for some other programming, like CSI, and all that other good stuff.  Or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- any -- anything.  I mean, I -- if --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And my little guy, who's four, wants to watch Fear Factor.  He's, like, "Mom, can we watch that?  I like to hear people scream".  It's, like, "No.  You -- you know, you're, like, getting into this --"
R:  Oh God.
L:  "-- Charles Manson thing", you know.  And he thinks it's funny because, you know, when his -- when Jim is home -- or, like, we watch -- we used to watch wrestling because some friends of ours were, ah, professional wrestlers.  So, we used to watch it when he was real, real little.  Well, we don't let --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- him watch it at all.  And he wants to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- know why he can't watch it, because Uncle So and So's on TV.  And it's, like, "No" --
R:  Oh boy.
L:  -- because I know that that's really -- sometimes they really get hurt.  And they do cut --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- themselves, and they do stupid things.  But, yeah -- I mean, it -- it's weird how different categories fall in -- I wonder if news is considered reality TV?
R:  Boy, sometimes it's too much.  I was just saying -- I was getting my hair cut yesterday, and we were having this whole discussion, and everyone -- with Saddam, most -- most of them don't wanna watch the news, because it's so upsetting -- depressing that they just wanna shut it out of their lives, unless it's something that they really, really need to know about.  You know, like an epidemic -- like SARS, or something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like that, or --
L:  Yeah.  Well, we're in Chicago here, and -- and tonight they had six people get shot by an AK47 in Maywood.  And --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- that's --
R:  -- God.
L:  -- just about ten minutes down the road from me, because I'm on the outskirts of Chicago.  And I go to school right on the verge of Maywood, which is over in Rivergrove.  And I'm, like, "Oh, that's nice".
R:  Oh my God.
L:  Lots of --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- gang activity --
R:  -- terrifying.
L:  -- and stuff like that.  I mean, I don't know what area you're from, but --
R:  I'm -- I'm in San Francisco.
L:  Oh, it's beautiful out there.
R:  Yeah.  I like it -- I like Chicago too.  I've --
L:  I'll switch.
R:  -- been there.  It's like --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- Chicago is fun.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I think they should make something about reality TV for, like, out on the west coast.  I would gladly go.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't think I would eat the maggots and stuff like that, but I think I would really go.  It's, like, "You wanna swim a whale?  Okay, I'll go".  You know, what the hell.
R:  [LAUGH] Well see, there you go.  That's the kind of reality TV they should have --
