L:  [NOISE] Hello, are you there?
R:  Hi.  Yeah.  My name's Tiffany Ellis.
L:  Hi.  How are you?
R:  I'm good [MN].
L:  Okay.  All right.  So, my name's Jake.  Uh --
R:  Oh, hi, Jake.
L:  All right.  Well, I don't know -- have you done one of these before?
R:  No.  I've never done this before.
L:  Okay, right.  Well, me neither.  So, uh, you know, I don't know.
R:  Arms control --
L:  What do you think of, uh --
R:  -- in Iraq.
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  Okay.  Um, well, I think that, um, basically that we, uh, are not doing anything to help, uh, you know, control anything in Iraq now where they're killing everyone.  Um, I'm totally confused with the whole deal.  I don't think they even had any arms.  I think they were -- the government was full of shit.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [NOISE] Um, yeah, well, I don't know I -- I mean, I think they might have had some stuff but I -- I don't think it's any more secure now than it was before.  That much I would agree with you with.  But, um, I don't know, I guess the other part of it is what they should be doing now or something like that [NOISE].
R:  Um, what they --
L:  Uh, well, uh --
R:  -- should be doing now?
L:  Yeah, I mean, I don't know.  What do you think about that?
R:  Um, well, the way I -- what they should be doing now, um, I guess, is I think that they should --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- go in and do like a martial law type of thing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and remove all --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of the guns because they don't know who is fighting and who isn't fighting right now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in Iraq.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's not helping, killing off, you know, the people that live there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's what they're doing right now is they're killing people, um, in Iraq, you know, that are protesting the Americans being there.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know --
L:  Well, I don't know -- so, if they do martial law -- I'm going to be devil's advocate for a minute -- if they do martial -- martial law wouldn't that -- I mean, do you think that might, uh, make people even more upset about the US being there and everything?
R:  Well, I don't know.  I mean, it seems -- I mean, th- they're -- they're killing the Iraqis, you know, on a daily basis that are protesting anyway.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I mean [LAUGH] -- you know, I mean, at least there wouldn't be people getting killed, you know.  I mean, at least there'd be some type of form of rules.  Um, but I don't think that the Iraqis should have arms at all.  I think that we should completely take over, uh, the country.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know --
L:  Okay.  Right.
R:  -- until they can get it together and we can get Saddam Hussein out of order.
L:  Right, [NOISE] yeah, I know.  I -- I remember before Bush said he -- he wasn't gonna -- you know, like during his, um, campaign and everything he said he wasn't gonna get involved in like rebuilding countries and, uh, doing all this stuff but now he's in there and it's like he's facing exactly what he said he was -- wasn't going to get involved with and, you know, he's trying to have it both ways as far as like he doesn't want to get involved but then he -- he, you know, creates some huge situation he has to do something.  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Um, mm.
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  [LAUGH] Let's see.
L:  Well, I don't know.  Okay.  Right.  So, they're there.  So, you think they should, uh ...
R:  If we're going to do something or--
L:  When you say martial --
R:  -- we're gonna be there --
L:  -- law --
R:  -- let's do something and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, I mean, let's go over there and let's take all the arms, you know, and then see what they're gonna do.  Then there's not gonna be a threat.  There's not gonna be a -- you know, any problem --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And who cares if they protest against Americans because they can't kill the Americans.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I mean, isn't -- I mean, why -- why we allow protesting in our country -- I mean, why is it such a big deal to go off and kill them over there for doing the same thing.  You know, for equal rights.
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  I mean, they feel invaded but, you know, I think that we should take the rest of their shit. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Let's take it all.  We've taken everything else.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I guess you could say also that like people in other countries might get, um, upset by what's going on in Iraq.
R:  I -- I think so.
L:  You know what I mean, so --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  So, like -- I guess what I'm saying, even if you are successful in like shutting down Iraqis totally, like, if you're too severe about it, you know what I mean, like, then you just get people in -- in neighboring countries more upset whereas if you try and be -- you know what I mean, like, a little more -- a little --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- softer about it or whatever --
R:  Well --
L:  -- maybe they won't get --
R:  -- they did that with Afghanistan, you know, and now they're doing it with Iraq and, you know, they never got Osama and they don't have, uh, what's his name, Saddam Hussein and that was the whole point of all these wars.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, what did we accomplish except killing people and destroying things and more money out of our budget?
L:  Yeah.  And, you know, I mean, do you feel like we're any safer from terrorism here, I mean --
R:  No.  I feel --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we're worse fixed.
L:  I don't see why you would -- yeah.  Right.  We probably are worse.  Where do you live, anyway?
R:  Studio City, California.
L:  Studio City.  Okay.  Right.  I know where that is.  Um, yeah, so, you know, you live some place where there's some threat of terrorism or whatever, I don't know.
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  Doesn't feel any safer, uh ...
R:  I don't feel safer but, you know, um --
L:  Right.
R:  But I guess we're supposed to stick on this arms thing, um [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, yeah.  Right.  Okay.  So, um --
R:  Or we don't get paid.
L:  Well, jeez, I don't know.  I mean, arms inspection, you know, I think I heard some kind of controversy about, um, the UN wanted to go back in there at this point and, like, you know, send those inspectors back in so they can try and come up with -- to basically see if Iraq had any nuclear weapons or whatever it was.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, I --
R:  They've never even found anything that I'm aware of.  I mean, they -- they keep on saying, you know, hoping, you know, to make us like feel okay with the wars thing, "We found things" but they haven't found anything.
L:  Right.  Well, so --
R:  And that was the whole deal of us being there is they thought they were going to blow us up.
L:  Right.  I mean, so do you think the UN should, uh, do those inspections.
R:  I think the UN should go in and take --
L:  Or do you think like --
R:  -- everything.  I don't think they should have --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- a gun.  I don't think --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they should have anything --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at all unless they have a police force that is ran by the UN to stop looting and all of that.
L:  Right.  But should the UN do it or should the -- or can we, the US, just --
R:  I think the US needs --
L:  -- do it, take care of it?
R:  -- to get out of it.
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  And I think we should stay united and the UN should be handling everything.  I don't think -- I think the US way stepped over the line.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh --
R:  Completely.
L:  Yeah.  You know, I -- I agree with you.  I think --
R:  I don't feel we had a right.
L:  I don't feel -- I don't -- sorry.  Oh, you don't think we had a right.  Is that what you said?
R:  Uh-uh.  I mean, you know, those people, as soon as Saddam Hussein got out of power they bashed their heads with rocks, you know, I mean, "Oh, Saddam wouldn't allow --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- that".  I wonder why.  You know, they -- they covered themselves with blood and bashed little babies and boys' heads with rocks, you know, I mean, come on.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They're disturbed.  They shouldn't --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- have guns and they shouldn't have chemical weapons if they're that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- crazy.  I mean, they're like, you know, brutal.  Savage. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, you know, [NOISE] I don't know about that but ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, we had -- it's not like we're so great with our [NOISE] weapons.  I mean, we -- we feel free to use our weapons whenever we want, right, so --
R:  Yeah.  That is true.  But, you know, what they're doing is they're -- they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, they're not doing the right thing.  They think they're doing the right thing but they aren't.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So, they shouldn't be allowed to have control to use things of mass destruction.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, if they're going to be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- doing the wrong thing with them.  They're not using --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it as protection.
L:  Right.
R:  They're using it as a threat.
L:  So, what?  You'd trust the UN to do all that stuff or ...?
R:  Well, yeah, because the UN is --
L:  Arms inspection and everything.
R:  -- all of our nations combined.
L:  Right.
R:  The UN --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- didn't even support half the stuff that we did.  We went against them, after all the years --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of getting it.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  [LAUGH] But the Iraq arms deal, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, you know, they've been saying they're going --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to disarm for so long and, um, I don't see anything happening, you know.  I mean, I don't even think they really have all those arms.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I mean, I think they had some stuff that they weren't supposed to have but I don't think it was like really as severe as -- as what the US government was trying to tell everyone.  You know what I mean?  Like, I think they -- they had a couple of little things or whatever but it wasn't like -- you know, it's not like they found nuclear bombs or anything like that.  That was my understanding anyway.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's -- that was -- that was what they were trying to make us believe when they went over there.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Like that there was even worse than nuclear.  It was like, you know, um --
L:  Yeah.  Right.  Chemical weapons or whatever.
R:  But I don't think chemical --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- weapons should be allowed anywhere.  I think the UN should completely make everybody destroy every bit of chemical warfare that there is in the world.
L:  Right.
R:  Not only in Iraq.  I don't think chemical --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, we have enough things with all the disease --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and stuff.  I mean, how do we know SARS isn't a chemical weapon?
L:  Right.  No --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we don't.
R:  You know, so, I mean, I -- I think that they -- you know, they need --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to concentrate more on the chemical than the arms.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because the chemical thing seems to be what they have knowledge in.
L:  Yeah, you know, I don't see them doing that though because then the US has to give up its stuff.  That's the problem with any of this, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's all like the US wants everyone else to [NOISE] give up all their weapons but [NOISE] it comes --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- to the US giving up their weapons, all of a sudden it's like it's ...
R:  Yeah.  That is -- that is for sure true.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Mm.
L:  So, um, I don't know what else is there to say about arms inspections?
R:  I don't either.  Um, I think that, uh -- that, um --
L:  Right.  Okay.  So, you know what, for your, uh -- let me ask you something.  I asked this to a couple of my friends like [NOISE] on a one to ten scale if you -- if --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, you're being totally anti war would be, like, a one or whatever --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- being totally pro war would be a ten, how would you, uh [NOISE] place yourself on that scale?
R:  Five.
L:  Really.  Okay.  It sounded to me --
R:  I'm not for the war and I'm not really against the war I see that it was somewhat necessary but I believe that it's propaganda.  I believe that, you know, this whole deal with the arms thing is propaganda --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's just another way to kind of put us in a recession and, um, create havoc. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, wait, why would they wanna put every --
R:  They want something always going on.  They want us to focus --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- on something all the time --
