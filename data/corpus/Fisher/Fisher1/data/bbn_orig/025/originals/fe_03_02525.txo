R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  How's it going?  This is Val[?].
L:  Hi, uh, my name's Linda.
R:  [MN]  Okay.  This is very interesting.
L:  It is.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]  This is kind of weird.
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  You know what?  I was actually on the other line when it first came so I missed, like, the first instructions but we just talk about this topic right?
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  Okay, well, I guess, I'll say I'm not a fan of reality TV at all.  
L:  I --
R:  Um, go ahead.
L:  Go ahead, sorry.
R:  [LAUGH]  No, go ahead.
L:  I don't watch it either.  
R:  Really?
L:  It's -- I -- I watched a little of the first Survivor but [MN] it just doesn't interest me.  I don't know.
R:  Yeah, me neither.  I think, um, first of all, I think it's gotten totally out of hand.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like it [MN] was [MN] -- it was, I guess, Real World, MTV, whatever, that started as some -- one thing.  No, actually you know when it first started I did watch it, um, for a second, because you know it was new and it was interesting, whatever.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and it was somewhat real, not even that real, but that's the whole thing about them, is that they're not really that -- it's -- [MN] to me you've -- you've captured, like, point five percent of America.  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  They -- and they pick and choose who gets on -- I think they manipulate who wins too.
R:  Totally.
L:  You know.  
R:  Totally.  And that's just these people and they have like, I don't know, not the people that I'm around, they're number one goal in life is not money and sex, you know.  And --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- that's the only kind of people they portray.  Everybody's out to like get each other.  Everybody's out to, like, do each other and, like, kill each other for money, and it's just kind of crazy.  Like th- they really ruin people [LAUGH] like that.
L:  Yeah.  And I think the new ones with, uh, [MN] Married by America and Joe -- that's kind --
R:  Oh my God, that's gross.
L:  -- of -- that's dangerous.  
R:  Yeah. Wait.  No, which one, which one?
L:  Um, Married --
R:  Married --
L:  -- by a Millionaire and Joe --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  It's [LAUGH] -- the whole concept of commitment goes right [LAUGH] out the window, you know.
R:  [inaudible] totally.
L:  So, yeah, I agree.  I watched Big Brother, the first one.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I liked that but then after that even that got really cheesy.
R:  Right.  I think I watched Survivor, like, once but then it's like one, either it's all being set up and people are just, whatever, getting paid like they're doing a script or whatever.
L:  Right.
R:  And if that's the case then that's really sad.  And if it's not the case then that's still really sad [LAUGH] because if really -- I mean, if you're willing to, like, have your life taped to, like, go on some TV show and, like, just act like an asshole.  I don't know.  That's kind of [LIPSMACK] sad.  And then if you're willing to get married off --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or, you know, [MN] -- you know, which one is it where it's, um, one guy and he gets to eliminate -- like he gets, like, ten girls and then slow- -- or I guess they do a [several inaudible words] but he just gets to eliminate them -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they compete for him and, like, they tell ea- -- on each other some -- something.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  
R:  No, and --
L:  I know and, you know, [MN] all the girls that they pick for all of these shows have the perfect bodies.  It perpetuates --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that myth that we all have to look a certain way.
R:  Exactly.
L:  In [MN] --
R:  And that we all sounded like -- and the majority of them -- yeah, it's also interesting because the majority of them are white women.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, white men.  I don't know it's just this image of, like, the average and this is what people think.  This is what people do.  This is how they are and that -- that these women that -- that in reality all these, like, women are, like, willing to just, like, throw out, like, female bonds just for a man.  You know.  And just --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- drool after him like that.  Like, just -- like he's some big huge prize and not even good look- -- I don't know [LAUGH] it's just crazy.
L:  Well, in the one he -- they told 'em -- they lied.  They told all the girls that he had all this money.  
R:  Yeah, what was that --
L:  I can't remember which one it was.  But --
R:  It's -- I think it was Joe Millionaire.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he ended up being like a construction worker or something.
L:  Yeah.  [COUGH]
R:  Was that -- but was that like -- was that part of the TV show that they find out they lied or was that, like, news coverage later on that he lied or ...?
L:  No.  They said in the commercials all the way in the beginning that they -- that it was [MN] all a farce.  That he was a -- a construction worker.
R:  Oh.  
L:  But the girls --
R:  Whoa.
L:  -- didn't know it.  
R:  Oh, I did not know that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That is crazy.  
L:  To me that's like fraud, right off the top, you know.
R:  Yeah, basically.  Basically.
L:  But it was funny the girls' reaction, how it varied from girl to girl as far as, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  What -- what they thought about that.  If they were in it for the money or ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I don't know.
R:  I don't know.  And I [inaudible] swear there was one -- I may have just imagined this, okay, where literally they try to hurt each other.  Like, it's like this mystery and one person's going to -- I didn't --
L:  Yeah, I think I remember --
R:  I didn't understand it.  Do you know what I'm talking about 'cause you can't kill -- I mean you can't kill people on -- I mean you can't do it, but yet the way the commercial was setting it up was like, one person's out to get everybody but can they get them first, and literally people are like screaming, like, there's, like, blood in the commercials.  It's out of control.  And I was just, like, you know what, this is like an American sickness right here.  Like, it's not funny.  You know what I mean.  
L:  Ex- -- [MN] absolutely, yes.
R:  Like there's all these great topics in the world.  There's all this stuff happening.  There's all these important things that we could talk about.  All these productive ways that we can use TV, yet we're using it to watch each other, like, go to the bathroom, go to a nightclub, have a petty argument.  Like that's -- and then -- and people get off watching this stuff --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as if nothing's going on in the world, you know.
L:  I know and see who can be eliminated.  That's [several inaudible words].
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  I -- I very seldom watch network TV.  Usually it's History or Discovery Channel or one of the news channels or ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Very, very seldom do I watch network TV anymore.
R:  No, it's -- yeah, now it's -- it's just at its worst.  I feel you 'cause I, um, [LIPSMACK] I'm a first year law student and I'm broke.  Partially why I'm doing this.  [LAUGH]
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  You know and so I don't even have a TV actually.  Ha.
L:  Oh.  
R:  So, [MN] my God, when I'm over at somebody's house, or whatever, I just, like, I smell that stuff and I just turn it off.  I really can't stand it, like -- it's just not that interesting.  It's really not.  After a while it's really predictable and it's all the same story, different twist, you know.  Like --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- Survivor and then Survivor on a Boat and then Survivor on a Raft.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  
L:  Exactly.  You know.  Then the -- [MN] there was this one a friend of mine watches.  Where they set 'em up on dates, Blind Date.
R:  Oh no.
L:  And they, like, totally --
R:  [several inaudible words]. 
L:  -- mismatch 'em.  But, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they'll put a businessman with some girl from the village with tattoos --
R:  Oh [MN]
L:  -- and nose rings and ...  You know, how embarrassing.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yuk.  
L:  It's just really bad taste, you know.
R:  Yeah, basically.  [MN]
L:  So, yeah, I don't -- I -- I don't -- when I heard the topic I was -- I was -- went, "Oh no" 'cause I don't watch --
R:  You know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I tell you.  Are you a student?
L:  [MN]  No.  No.
R:  Okay.
L:  No, I'm paying for a wedding, that's why I'm doing this.  [LAUGH]
R:  Nice.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
R:  Oh my gosh.  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  So where do you live?
R:  I live in Queens.  I just moved out to New York from California.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm upstate, near Buffalo.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I've been to the city once.  It's beautiful.
R:  Nice.
L:  But you probably get --
R:  It's [inaudible] -- it's really cold.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  No, I -- as far as reality TV goes I just -- it's just not -- I have so much more I can do with my time, you know.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  
L:  And we have betw- -- my fiance and I have, um, a seven- seventeen year old.  Two seventeen year olds and a sixteen year old.  We just had birthdays.  
R:  Right.
L:  So, they keep me busy, you know.  And I --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- don't necessarily want them watching that stuff either.
R:  Yeah, do they watch it?
L:  No.  No.
R:  No.
L:  They're -- they're not big TV watchers.
R:  That's --
L:  So ...
R:  That's great, actually.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  That's cool.  Yeah, I don't know, I'm trying to think of another one that I watched.  I honestly -- Real World if I had to pick -- if I had to watch one.  
L:  [MN]  Yeah.
R:  I guess, because it was, at that time, it just -- it was the least exaggerated.  I think they -- as pathetic as it kind of was already, like, they started with -- they had some kind of mission that they did or something like that.  They all like, one was a doctor, one was, you know what I mean?
L:  Right.  
R:  They weren't just people -- I mean, just whatever random people -- it was like very, whatever, exotified[?], kind of, jobs or -- you know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  They were just --
L:  Right.
R: -- kind of, sort of, normal people who -- I mean, I -- I know -- I know people that, you know tried out for that, like, in our university auditions, or whatever.  Like, they would come to universities and people would just do it just to, like, make some money, get famo- -- whatever.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah I remember, like, the first one.  It was that guy who had Aids, Pedro.  And then he actually died, like, during or, like, after the TV show.  I don't know, there was something more real about it.  There was something more, you know, we're going to use this space to, like, talk about real issues or something.  Something that takes thought.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  And brain cells. 
L:  Right.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] and then, yeah, people hooked up or whatever, but for the most part it was kind of regular.  I mean, it's funny 'cause at the time I -- I didn't think so, but now comparing it to all these random other things I feel like, okay, maybe that was actually great.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.  I know.
R:  And like Road Rules was one and they, you know, actually had, like, missions and tried to figure stuff out or whatever.  You know.
L:  Yeah.  Anymore it's just how -- how -- what can we think of.  How can we get the shock factor --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- elevated?  You know, and ...
R:  But it's weird to me that people still fall for it 'cause it's --
L:  I know.
R:  -- so old now.  It's so, like, okay, I'm gonna
