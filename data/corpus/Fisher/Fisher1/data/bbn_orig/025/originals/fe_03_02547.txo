L:  Hi.  I'm --
R:  Hi.  My name --
L:  Morgan.
R:  -- is -- I'm Joan de Leon[?].
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  So, [COUGH] we're supposed to talk about, ah, reality TV.  Do you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ever watch that stuff?
R:  Ah, sometimes.
L:  Uh-huh.   I -- I -- I --I think I have to confess I've --I've watched it, um, for, I think, about fifteen minutes.  I -- I, ah, watched Joe Millionaire near the end because I wondered what all the stuff was about.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.  I've -- I've not watched it, you know, that much.  I've watched it a few times myself, but -- so, did you like it?
L:  Um, it was pretty ridiculous.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I [LAUGH] -- I mean, um, [LIPSMACK] -- I mean, a -- it was really more that I was just --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that I was curious about what, ah, everybody was into.  Ah, but, um, ah, oh, I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I must have watched some years ago some -- some MTV thing too.  One of those --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- houses where they invite a bunch of people and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they're supposed to live there.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]  
L:  So, um, I don't know.  It's -- it's, ah -- I guess it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- interesting as a sociological phenomenon, but, ah, I didn't find it all that entertaining.  It's -- it's not really reality, that's the thing.  It's -- it's, ah -- it's, um, artificial situations, artificial scenarios, you know, kind of like this phone call.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's -- that -- that's true.  Yeah, that's -- it's kind of a little hard to kind of, you know -- like you said, it's really artificial, so ...
L:  And, ah, they -- since -- once -- once you get into it being artificial, you'd like it if there -- there was a -- if there were better writers.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.
L:  Ah --
R:  That's true.
L:  But, on the other hand, I'm speaking out of complete ignorance --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause I've only watched fifteen minutes of one, so -- what -- what have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you watched?
R:  Um -- um, just a second. [NOISE] [PAUSE] [NOISE]  Just a second. [NOISE] [PAUSE] [NOISE]  You need to stay away from me. [NOISE] [PAUSE] No, 'cause I'm paid for -- [NOISE] [PAUSE] Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, I was just asking, ah, what, ah, reality shows you've watched.
R:  Um, jeeze, [NOISE] I haven't really watched any reality shows lately.  I don't really watch too much TV.  I'm always, you know, watching my kids and stuff, so [NOISE] I don't really [NOISE] watch TV [NOISE] that much.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Well, what -- what reality --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- shows have you ever watched?
R:  Um, [NOISE] let's see. [PAUSE] [NOISE] [PAUSE] Ah, just Survivor and [NOISE] I saw that Joe Millionaire, but that's all. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  I'm gonna kick --
L:  So --
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] 
L:  Um, did you find them entertaining, or ...?
R:  [NOISE] So [NOISE] -- 
L:  Hello?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I'm here.
L:  Yeah.  I was saying did you --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- find them entertaining at all, or ...?
R:  [LAUGH] Um, ah [NOISE] kind of.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  [NOISE] But, I mean, [NOISE] [PAUSE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, the millionaire one, I don't actually know if I would go on national TV and -- I don't know. [PAUSE]   To find somebody I mean.  Hey [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  That seems a little odd, doesn't it?
R:  But, I mean, hey, everybody has their own, you know -- so [PAUSE] -- 
L:  Yeah.  I gu- -- a- actually I -- as I said, I watched, I think, the, ah -- the -- was it the second to last show?  Or maybe I watched a little of the last show.  And I guess there was supposed to be this -- this big shocker.  And, um --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Um, I think --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:   Well, I assumed --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the big shocker was gonna be is that even though the whole thing was supposed to be the he wasn't rich --  
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- ah, that actually somehow he would be.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  And I guess that's more or less what happened.  They gave him a bunch of money or --
R:  Yeah -- yeah.  Yeah, that was -- yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He wasn't rich in the first place, but yeah -- so, yeah.
L:  After a while.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- figure that even if he wasn't, ah --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- rich, they could -- I mean, he could --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- write a book about it, or he could have somebody else write a book and he could put his name --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on it.
R:  That's true.  Yeah, that true. [NOISE]
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE] So -- [NOISE] but, like you said, everybody has their own, you know thing, so --
L:  Right -- right.
R:  But, [NOISE] --
L:  Mm.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah. I -- I, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  When I was growing up I remember there was a --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- show -- wasn't a reality show, but it was a show in which, ah -- ah, it was based --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- around somebody getting a million dollars.  Somebody would --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  It w- -- it was called The Millionaire, right?
R:  Oh, yeah -- yeah.
L:  And somebody, ah -- ah, would --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- come to the door and have a cheque for a million dollars.  And they'd go, "Ha ha, big --"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  "-- joke".  And -- and, ah, then there would really be a --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- million dollars.  And then it would change their lives in some way, or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it wouldn't change their lives.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  And, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that seemed like a much more interesting concept. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  In fact, if they really did that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah, I think that would, ah -- that might be more interesting too, rather than bringing a bunch of people together under some -- some, ah, phoney pretense or some -- some funny --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- scenario.  Just actually go and give somebody a million dollars, and then --
R:  A- -- yeah, true.
L:  -- [LAUGH] and then -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] and then tune in on them later.
R:  Yeah.  Um, there was another one I watched, um, about where they brought, like -- what was it -- five or six couples onto an island.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they split 'em up for, like -- what -- a week.  And I can't remember what that one was -- [NOISE] h- -- Temptation Island. [NOISE]  Yeah, that one I watched.  I watched that one, like, every time it was on. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah?
R:  I just -- yeah.  That just came to me.  But yeah, I watched that one.  Thought it was pretty interesting, you know.  But, [LAUGH] --
L:  So, did they get tempted?
R:  [LAUGH] Um, did they get tempted?  Oh yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  Yeah -- yeah.  Pretty interesting. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But yeah, you know, temptation -- yeah -- so [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But yeah -- so -- and then, you know, after they'd get tempted they'd have a little regret, so hey, you know.
L:  And it was all on camera?
R:  But -- yeah, pretty much, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, [NOISE] -- and I will have to admit I did watch that one religiously every time it came on. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  [NOISE] So, yeah.  But --
L:  You were just kind of curious about what they were gonna do next, right?
R:  Well, yeah -- yeah. [NOISE]  But, you know, people can always say they're happy, but hey, there's always something [NOISE] gonna tempt 'em to, you know, do otherwise.  So, yeah. [NOISE]  Pretty interesting --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to actually see if somebody would actually, you know -- if they're, like, so much in love -- [NOISE] or, you know, if they're going to, you know, actually risk, you know, what they have with that other person, you know, to be with somebody else just for, you know, a few hours or one night or whatever, you know.  So, yeah.
L:  But I guess what I find odd about that is not that people would sometimes be tempted --
R:  [COUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  -- but that they'd be tempted while they were on camera, being watched by millions of people.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] Yeah, that too.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't -- I don't really know if I would actually, you know, be -- you know, be tempted if -- okay, as on camera as I would off camera, you --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- know.  Um, I really --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- you know, wouldn't want all that on camera.  You know, everybody watching it, you know, millions of people.  So, hey [LAUGH] -- but -- so ...
L:  Yeah.  So, that's -- that is what sort of seemed odd --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about 'em to me.
R:  Yeah, pretty much.
L:  Yeah.  I heard --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about these things.  I just -- I never really had the time to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to watch -- ah, time to watch that much anyway.
R:  [NOISE]  Well, [MN] --
L:  And if I do, I tend to watch movies.  But --
R:  Yeah.  Well, like I said, I -- you know, I have my kids, you know, and I really don't watch that much TV, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  When I was younger I used to watch a lot, but not anymore, so, you know [NOISE] --
L:  Do n- -- your kids watch TV?
R:  Um, yeah. [NOISE]  Yeah, they watch TV. [NOISE]  Yeah, cartoons, um, you know, anything -- sit in front of the TV.
L:  They're little ones?
R:  But, yeah -- excuse me?
L:  They're little ones?  Ah --
R:  Um, yeah.  I have a little one, yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  She's three and a half.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  So, she watches a lot of cartoons, yeah.
L:  Probably, ah, too little to get into Temptation Island --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- and stuff like that.
R:  -- pretty much.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  True.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But -- so [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But [NOISE] --
L:  So, um, if you were, ah -- if you were gonna do -- um, invent, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a reality show, what do you think you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you'd invent?
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Um --
