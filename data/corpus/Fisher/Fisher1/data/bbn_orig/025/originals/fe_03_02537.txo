R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  My name is Tracey.  I'm from St Louis, and I'm thirty two. [NOISE]
L:  I'm Jennifer, from Milwaukee.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.  Um, I do watch Fear Factor.  I used to watch Survivor.  I don't watch that any more.  I watched the first episode.  I watch The Osbournes --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- if I can catch it.  I never watched those, um, people who get married after, you know, so many weeks.  I've never watched any --
L:  Oh, Married --
R: -- of those.
L:  -- By America.  Oh, all right, yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't watch --
R:  Or even The Bachelorette, or --
L:  Yeah.  I don't watch any of those reality shows.  I think they're silly. [NOISE] 
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, see, I think that they are so, um -- well, like the show -- like, Fear Factor, I think that it's, ah, really interesting and funny.  Me and my boyfriend sit here and watch it, like --
L:  Well, 'cause none of those -- they're supposed to be reality shows, but none of the people on them seem like real people to me.
R:  I agree.  They seem, um, like they want to be on TV.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's all a --
R:  They look like models.
L:  It's the new kind of audition for people wanting to be models and actors and actresses. [LAUGH] 
R:  I do agree with that.  I wholeheartedly agree with that.  A lot of 'em, +especially the women, um, they all look like they've had breast implants.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're very thin, tall --
L:  Primped -- primped to their life for this chance.
R:  Yeah, this once in a lifetime chance to be on TV.  I agree with that, but I'm -- I don't know.  I watch a lot of TV, so, um, shows like, ah -- you've never watched Survivor?
L:  No.
R:  'Cause that's a big, big -- ah, people are hooked on that.  And I was hooked on it that very first season. [SIGH]  But, I don't know.  It's so bizarre to play a game to win a million dollars, and to out in this jungle in --
L:  Yeah.  Some of the things they have to do -- I'm, like, "Nah, couldn't make me do that". 
R:  Yeah.  I don't think so either.  Like, especially, like, on Fear Factor they have to, um, eat something every episode.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  They have to eat something very crazy.
L:  Yeah.  They --
R:  Um --
L:  My -- ah, my boyfriend was watching it once and -- and I heard him from the other room.  Something like cow intestines or something.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  They have to eat -- I know -- ah, I think last week they had to eat these huge snails.  And I mean these things were huge.  They were, like, five inches long and, like, two inches wide.  It was pretty disgusting.  But, I don't know -- some people do anything for a quick fifty thousand dollars.  I guess --
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  -- it's very easy money.  And I guess it's very tempting for people who, you know, have, I don't know, twenty thousand dollars worth of student debts.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause a lot of these kids are -- they're young.  You can tell they're, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, twenty two, twenty three tops.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- but, they all look like they're from California.
L:  Yeah.  And they also -- they must have enough money to take off of work that much to do -- or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do that.
R:  Yeah.  +Especially like the survivors.  They're gone for a while.  I mean, you know, they're in Taiw- Taiwan, Australia.  You know, they're out of the country.  None of that takes place in the United States.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So yeah, you have to take off for a month.
L:  And that one, um -- oh, The Bachelor.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The one that's going, there's a girl from our area that's on it and my -- my little niece went to school with her.  And --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- [LAUGH] she's got a boyfriend.
R:  Oh wow.  Oh.
L:  You know?  And it's, like "Okay.  So, yeah, this is real TV".  And she said, "You know, this girl has primped all her life. And her family have taught her, you know, how to do this stuff".  That this was her way of getting +exposure.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.  Yeah.  I -- I -- I -- I'd believe that 'cause it -- I don't know.  And -- and -- and now we've been saturated with the whole reality, reality, reality.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then, now they've come out with this whole, um, reality me- -- ah, it's a movie that I think MTV is doing.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Um --
L:  Well, that's where it all started.  With -- when MTV and those five people living in the house or something.
R:  Right.  The Real World.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  I used to watch those too.  I don't watch 'em any more 'cause they -- we have totally been saturated with it.  It's, like, "Okay, enough already".
L:  Mhm.
R:  What else can they come up with for, you know, strangers to meet each other and win something -- win some -- some money?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I've never watched, um -- [LIPSMACK] I'm not a big, um, American Idol fan.  I mean, that's kind of --
L:  No.
R:  That's a reality.  And now they've got all these knock off shows to that, you know, promoting people with all this talent.
L: Mhm.
R:  Even though I do think that a lot of talent goes unnoticed, um, it's just -- it's too much.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's so much. Ugh. I -- I can -- I mean, every time you turn on the TV -- my mother was hooked on that, um -- the Joe Millionaire, 'cause he was the first of that little --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that was a silly one.
R:  Yeah, I know.  But, I never watched that one.  I never watched that, but my mother loved it.  She couldn't wait to the, you know, end and find out who he had -- who he had picked, and what they were gonna say after they found out that he wasn't really a millionaire.
L:  Yeah.  And, gee, hm, I don't think those people are together now. [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, exactly.  Yeah, I don't -- I -- I'm -- none of it works out.  What was the one -- I think it was, like, the very first one where they got married on TV and come to find out --
L:  Oh, with Darva Conger?  Um, Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire?
R:  Okay, that was it.  Okay, yeah.  That -- you know, they didn't -- did they even ever get married? [LAUGH] 
L:  Ye- --
R:  Did they actually get married, and then it w- -- it was annulled, like, the same week?
L:  [MN] Yeah, I think so.
R:  Yeah.  So, I don't -- I mean, I -- I -- I [NOISE] don't know how realistic it is to get married to someone that you don't even know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I do like the, um -- I do like the more, ah, adventurous ones where they're -- they have to do stuff to -- to win the money.  And I never was a big fan of, ah, Big Brother.  I used to watch that every once in a while -- where they were all, like, in a house.  I guess that one --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- was more like the MTV one.
L:  Oh yeah.  And there was that one too about a race.  They'd race around the world.
R:  Oh yeah.  I used to like that one -- I used to like that one.  Yeah, they would race all over the world.  It would be, like, couples, you know, brother and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- sister or, you know, husband and wife.  Yeah, I used to like that one.  And I never g- --understood the, um -- there was one, The Mole.  I never quite understood that 'cause I could never follow it.  That had --
L:  Yeah.  I didn't -- I didn't know much about that one.
R:  Yeah, I didn't either.  That -- there was -- that was --
L:  Other than was the mole, like a tattletale or something?
R:  Yeah.  But, I couldn't get -- I don't know if they were trying to out who the mole was, or -- I -- I never got that one.  But I -- I don't know.  I watch TV probably way too much than I should. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah.  I wa- -- I watch TV, and I watch, like -- like, you know, CSI and stuff like that.
R:  Uh-huh. [LIPSMACK]  I'm a big, ah, talk show person, so --
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  -- I think that that's why I like the reality stuff.  I'm a big, like, Jerry Springer fan.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, I know.  Isn't that horrible?  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm so horrible.  Ah, so I watch a lot of the talk shows, the Divorce Courts --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- 'cause that's all, you know, what I like.  The -- like, Judge Joe Brown, and Judge Judy.  Those are all, you know, real people to me.  So, I'm kind of caught up in that whole reality thing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, it has been, ah --
L:  That at least has more --
R:  It has been saturated.
L:  -- more real people in it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  That are, you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- know, actually normal body weight. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I agree.  I agree wholeheartedly.  Me and my boyfriend watch Jerry Springer every night.  It comes on at midnight.  And, um -- 'cause we both work in the restaurant industry, so we're late, you know -- we're out late and, um, [LIPSMACK] -- I -- I watch it.  And we think it's so scripted.
L:  Oh, it is.
R:  We -- yeah.  So, you know, I mean, although it is real people, they've been so scripted, because it is a show, you know?  I think that they've -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  I mean, it's so scripted now.  We -- when they ring the bell we know they're gonna fight.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  When they do something we know one girl's gonna lift up her shirt.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, yeah, it's totally scripted.  [LIPSMACK] And then, I don't know -- but, you said you don't watch Fear Factor.  But there's, like, a part on Fear Factor where they're all kind of giving testimonials.  And when they're giving this testimonial they're all, like, ah, walking towards the new, um, project or whatever they're gonna have to fulfill to try to get their fifty thousand dollars.  And they almost do it, like, the, um -- wh- what I remember Charlie's Angels used to be like.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  They'd be, like, walking down a street, and it's -- it's so Hollywood.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, it's so Hollywood.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, ah, I mean, it -- it's funny to me.  But, it -- I guess it sells, so --
L:  It -- it must.
R:  -- they keep --
L: [LAUGH]
R:  -- giving us more and more and more and more.
L:  Well, I think people got a little tired of what the TV was, and then the first reality show came in, and boom, that was different.  So, everybody watched it.
R:  Right.
L:  And then they just flooded it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And people will get sick of it and will look for something else.
R:  Yeah, they do that a lot.  As soon as, ah, one thing hits they just -- God, they, you know, go, go, go, and then it'll die off.  But, it's been a few years now that the whole reality thing has been going on.  But, it actually -- it seemed like MTV started it with, ah -- with The Real World.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, real TV didn't pick up on it for, like, years.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then finally someone did a reality, you know, regular TV show.  And now they're doing the reality movie, which is something about Cancun.
L:  Ha.
R:  The Real Cancun.
L:  Hm.
R:  And they -- it ca- -- I was listening to the radio the other day, and I guess it debuted one Friday, either this past --
