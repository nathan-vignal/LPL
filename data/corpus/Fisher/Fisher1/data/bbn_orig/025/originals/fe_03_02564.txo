R:  Hi.  This is Val.
L:  Hi, this is Dan.
R:  Hi, Dan.  It's nice to meet you.
L:  You too.  I think that the -- the topic's a little dated, don't you?
R:  Uh, yeah.  Kind of. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think they're already in the process of doing some -- some things, aren't they?  I haven't listened to the news lately so I'm not real sure.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I mean, I think there's -- they're now looking for the weapons that they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- originally thought they would have before the war, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, I don't think there's really an issue of disarming them anymore.
R:  Right.  Um, the topic was: what should the US do about Iraq?  Is that what we're supposed to be talking about?  I mean, that -- that's what she said, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  And what sh- -- what should the US do to --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- disarm Iraq?
R:  Yeah.  Well, I don't think we have to d- -- I don't think the United States has to do anything to disarm them.
L:  Not any more. [LAUGH]
R:  No.  I think -- well, I think it's important that they, um, find everything so that everybody can be comfortable and be -- be, uh, safe in Iraq, I think is a -- is an issue.
L:  Yeah.  I think, well, right now it's a question of discovering these weapons, if they still exist.  Um, have they been moved to another country or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- are they being hidden some place?  And I think sooner or later that the, uh -- some of these top level Iraqi officials that they've captured will make deals and -- and some of these, uh, chemical and biological weapons will turn up eventually.
R:  Eventually.  Yeah.  I think so too.  I just wonder, um, like you said whether they've gone out of the country or what they -- the one thing that I wonder is -- [COUGH] excuse me.  I'm sorry -- is that, um, where I would be concerned about it is somebody else knowing where they're at and taking up, um, control of the country again and causing the people more problems again.
L:  Yeah.  That's why I think it's important although they -- you know, they -- there's a lot of, um, sentiment there for, uh, United States to leave, um, I don't think we can do that until we're sure of where these weapons are and that, uh, none of these outside, uh, radical groups will come in there and try to do what happened in Iran.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  And that -- that's really tough because I know some people, um, over there especially are worried that the United States is just gonna take over and they're not gonna have any freedom with United States taking over but I don't think that's the -- what the issue is with what they wanna do.
L:  No.  Not at all. I mean, we -- we certainly don't wanna occupy that country.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I think it would be in our interests to -- to have a, uh, healthy democracy over there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Since all the, uh -- all the, um, Arab countries and, uh -- and Iran, I don't think there's one democracy over there.  Israel seems to be the only democracy in the Middle East.
R:  Yeah.  They all have, um, [MN] -- they either have horrible people ruling them or they have, um, kings.
L:  Kings.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, i- it seems ironic they're worried about the United States coming in there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, that their -- that their rights are gonna be abridged.  What rights did they have under Saddam Hussein?
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  They didn't have any.  They couldn't even --
L:  They had a right to support --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- him. That was it.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And they did a good job of it I -- from what I can -- from what I can gather from the bits and pieces that I've heard, they -- they were really forced into doing that and doing a good job of it.
L:  I -- I was surprised that people that were -- you know, there's always been -- there's always -- there always has been and always will be anti war sentiment in this country and I'll -- you know, I don't have any quarrel with that.  But I was surprised that people, even after some of the abuses came to light, continued to say, you know, "We have no right to be there".  I mean, did they really want us to leave that country and let a guy like Saddam, who's been there for twenty five years tormenting those poor people, to stay in power?  Uh, it didn't make sense to me.
R:  Um, I think that a lot of it had to do with selfishness on people's parts because they wanna know what is it -- what it -- how's it gonna affect us?  How's it gonna affect me living here in the United States?  What am I gonna have to lose to do it?  And I think that is a lot of what a lot of people think is what is it going to do to us --
L:  Well, I mean --
R:  -- individually?  Me, individually
L:  -- and then you get into the whole debate of whether or not you think that what we did over there is -- will ultimately help us to avoid these, uh -- you know, ha- -- avoid more terrorism.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And people said, "Well, you'll go over there and, you know, that'll -- that'll breed more terrorism" and the other point of view was, "No, this will -- you go into a big country like that and, if you take it over as we did in three weeks, some of these terrorists will think twice about, and more importantly some of the other countries over there may think twice about harboring and supporting these people".
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I just -- I -- it -- it's surprising to me there are a lot -- it's seems to me a lot of people in this country forgot about nine eleven.
R:  Yeah.  Maybe so.  Maybe so.  I -- I don't really, um, know that much about it unfortunately as far as -- I know there were a lot of anti war demonstrations and things like that but I really don't listen to the news a lot.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that is a -- that is a problem that I have that in -- in being connected with the things that are going on but maybe there's a lot of people that don't think that the idea of going into that -- going into Iraq was to take care of terrorism.
L:  Oh, yeah, well --
R:  It was more to take care of this.
L:  You hear a lot about people thinking we were going in there to, uh, take their oil.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, a- as one -- one commentator said, if we wanted their oil, it would be a lot cheaper and easier to just buy it from them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, 'cause we -- we could have been such a big consumer that we would probably have gotten a very good price.
R:  Yeah.  Huh.  Yeah.  I -- I -- I just think that there's a lot of underlying things that people think are going on in there, they're thinking that everybody's lying to them.  I mean, even the people in Iraq now they think that the United States is lying to them.
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  That they're --
L:  Well, you know, we --
R:  -- gonna take over and they're not gonna have any freedom.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And -- and it's really tough and then -- and then things like I just -- I just briefly -- I didn't even read it but I saw where there was a de- -- some kind of demonstration yesterday.
L:  Mhm.  Over there.
R:  Or maybe the day after or the day before.  I don't remember.  And some civilians were killed.
L:  Yes.
R:  And they're probably saying, "See.  This is what the United States is gonna do".  But, yeah, you have -- they have to understand the way that the soldiers feel.  What if that demonstration had turned into something that would have been an attack on them?
L:  Well, what -- I mean, that's -- the -- the news people that were there said that they -- they actually witnessed, uh, the bullet holes from the p- -- some of the people in the crowd shooting at the troops.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and these are the -- I guess the average people in the crowd c- -- sort of were protesting --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but then you always have this group of radicals, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that it's pretty easy to sneak into the middle of a crowd and open fire.
R:  And unfortunately the -- the innocent people that are just there trying to let off steam, so to speak, are the ones that end up getting killed.
L:  Yeah.  I'm sure that's what happens.
R:  Rather than the radical people ge- getting killed.
L:  Yeah.  They probably got away with their weapons and, uh, you know, some of these other people were the ones who paid the price.
R:  I think that -- I've -- I think the United States is going about it the right way though.  I heard something that they said they have to get their basic needs taken care of.  Now, they have to get their electric turned on, their water turned on and all their basic needs met.
L:  Yeah.  I --
R:  You know, their food and water, clothing, shelter, all of those things, and then work on having the other things, step by step, going.  So, I think if they just don't, um -- what do I wanna say?  Push it too fast.  If they're -- if they're patient.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I think that most of the people over there are -- they're so happy to be -- to be rid of that oppressive government --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that they will give us the benefit of the doubt but there's always gonna be that radical element that just says, "Well, you know, you're -- you're coming in here to colonize our country and --"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  "-- you know, we don't want any, uh, non -- non Muslims in here and --"
R:  Right.
L:  But I -- I don't think they will be the majority.  I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, at this point.
R:  I don't -- I don't think so either.  It doesn't seem like it and once everything calms down a little bit more and people start to realize that they're getting benefits. Even thought they're free --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they don't really think they're getting any benefits from it.  And when they --
L:  Yeah.  I -- I'm -- that's surprising to me because particularly you hear that they had a, uh, oppressed majority that were being oppressed by a minority.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, it seems to me like, after all, Hussein took power in nineteen seventy nine so that's twenty four years, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, [LAUGH] you would think that the twenty four years would be enough for them so say, "Look, you know, anything's be- -- preferable to him".
R:  But, you know what, it -- it sounds really strange but I had -- it's the same -- it's almost the same experience I -- I had in my life. I married a man that had three children.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And his wife was abusive.  His -- his -- um, she died but she was very abusive and when those children had a stable life with a mother and a father, when we got married, they all rebelled against a, quote, unquote, normal life.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes.  They didn't like it.  And the doctors all said that the reason why they didn't like it was because they weren't used to it and they didn't feel secure in it.  They felt secure in that oppressed -- you know, if they -- I mean, even -- if they ma- -- if they had an accident where they spilled milk and, uh, this is a true experience, the one girl spilled milk on the floor and I walked into the kitchen and she's standing there in a daze.  I mean, she was just like shocked.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  She didn't know what to do.  And I'm like, "You need to pick up the bottle of milk".  She was clear across the kitchen and she's like, "You're not going to hit me?"
L:  Hm.
R:  I'm like, "No.  Why would I do that?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "You spilled milk on the floor.  Let's just clean it up".  She goes, "Well, my mum would -- my mum would have beat me".
