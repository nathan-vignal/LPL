L:  Hi.  This is Sherrie.  How are you?
R:  Hi.  I'm Eric.
L:  Hi, Eric.  I didn't quite hear what the topic was.  I thought it was arms inspections in Iraq when I initially called.  Did you?
R:  Um, I think that, um -- I think what they just said was -- is it Iraq -- have you done this before?
L:  Um, I've done one other call before.
R:  Okay.  This is my first time.  I think they said, "What is the US's po- -- how do you feel about the US's policy in Iraq?  What do you think our involvement should be?"
L:  After --
R:  That's sort of heavy.
L:  After we just bombed the country?
R:  Yeah.  It's --
L:  Well, we --
R:  -- a little --
L:  -- got a pol- --
R:  -- late now.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think -- I think they're a little bit behind.  Hm, what is our policy?  Hm.
R:  Our policy is we just decided we were going in there and bombing the shit out of it.   
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- um, and we're gonna build it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and George Bush is gonna give to Dick Cheney's management company --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- to --
L:  -- +Halliburton.  Isn't that cool --
R:  -- to -- to do -- to --
L:  -- to have a billion --
R:  -- do all the --
L:  -- dollars?
R:  -- rebuilding.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, therefore, we're gonna run the oil --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- make money on the rebuilding --
L:  Mm -- mm -- mm.
R:   -- and we're -- and -- and of us -- well, I don't know -- where do you live?
L:  Oh, well -- me?
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  I live in northeast, by, um, Washington DC.
R:  Yeah, okay.
L:  So, I'm a --
R:  I'm a New York boy.  Actually my mother's family's from Washington.
L:  Yeah.  So, our world -- we know as North East -- is a little jaded.
R:  I guess we are.
L:  But, when this comes to this -- I spoke to another southern lady about the Iraq conflict and they have a total -- totally different view.  And I'm very patriotic.  I love my country.  But I think we did the wrong thing here.  I think we needed to go there, but we went for the wrong reasons.
R:  Right.  I --
L:  And, um --
R:  It -- it -- we didn't need to necessarily get there right now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, it -- it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- probably something that was gonna be necessary.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, you know --
L:  And -- and --
R:  -- we went.  And so, we did it, and it -- it was very quick --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which is good.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was still a lot of money.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And --
L:  See, I don't know what our policy -- I didn't mean to cut you off -- what our policy's gonna be 'cause they haven't found any mass -- weapons of mass destruction.
R:  Well, guess --
L:  That's just --
R:  -- what?
L:  -- crazy.
R:  If -- if they weren't there when -- when -- when we -- when we got there, they're there by now.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's -- so, I'm very jaded about the whole thing.
L:  Mhm.  So, you know, most people are taking this -- how do we, um, say -- I don't know -- conspiracy theory.  There really wasn't any to begin with.  I didn't really believe he -- he had 'em.  I don't think they that -- a sophisticated country as, ah, say Korea, who we really should be worried about --
R:  Well, it --
L:  -- 'cause I think they may sneak in the back door on us.
R:  Well, they definitely -- they have weapons already.  And, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I read, like, intrigue novels and stuff like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that's, you know -- that's --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, that's definitely the red threat.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  And guess what?  Those people have been marching every day since they were two years old.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're ready. [LAUGH] 
L:  So, you know, I just think -- getting back to the country that they really have a mess.  'Cause you know what's happening now?  The Shiite Muslims and those religious Kurds -- and everybody's -- and the, um -- the-- the Turks and the Kurds are all gonna be fighting over Iraq as well.  They want a democratic society, democratic freedom -- how these people gonna vote to pick who -- who -- -- who's gonna run their country?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Then we have some man here -- it was our ambassador to Iraq -- who went back and think he's now the mayor of Iraq.  But, he's gonna be Iraq's next president.  He's the one that gave us all the insider information, ah, how our troops should come in, and how we really should get rid of Saddam Hussein, and -- and craziness.  So, you know, I don't -- I don't -- I don't think we have ah, um, a policy yet.  I haven't heard it -- haven't read it.  And I don't really know what our policy is -- is to --
R:  It's gonna be difficult.  It's a very difficult area.  I mean -- but, in terms of the history of the world, that's what -- you know, that's what really happens.  People fight about religion and war.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's not really --
L:  That's true --
R:  -- relig- -- ah, religion and land.
L:  Mhm.  Religion and land, there you go.
R:  That it.  That's -- I mean, if you really -- that's all that has ever happened all --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the time, and it -- and it's still going on.  And I guess now we fight about oil.
L:  But, like, yeah, my guess -- but, is -- was it our battle to fight?  They would talk about his atrocities and I look at -- you know, they were comparing him to, like, Idi Amin -- this was Saddam Hussein -- and all those people.  But, far as, like, the -- you know, people being murdered and mass graves.  Nobody gone over to Africa.  They been -- those Hutus are -- they're chopping off people's arms, and -- +atrocities that, you know, the people in the Sudan over there are, you know, are, um --
R:  Yeah.  That -- the --
L:  -- going through.
R:  -- tribal warfare.  I mean, I --
L:  If you wanted to help a country [LAUGH] ...
R:  I guess it's just not so sophisticated.  And once -- once they -- once they came across the ocean and put up -- put up the bomb or blew up the planes, that was when --
L:  They --
R:  -- you know, their shit was done, which is okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I believe in that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm -- I'm not mad about George Bush about that.
L:  No.
R:  He was, like, "No, this shit isn't gonna go", which is okay by me.
L:  No -- no -- no.  I'm just saying --
R:  But, um --
L:  I understand.
R:  -- it's a lot of money, and it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a lot of spending.  And, um, fortunately we didn't have too many American deaths, but --
L:  I know.
R:  Which is not to say -- because I believe --
L:  But, they were --
R:  -- people are --
L:   -- saying --
R:  -- people.
L:  -- one is too many.
R:  And they don't even say how many Iraqis died -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- which --
L:  No.
R:  -- is terrible.  You know, they just don't count --
L:  I do.
R:  -- which is terrible.
L:  I'd agree with you.
R:  It is the killing of the brown people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which is always -- we're always expendable, whether it be the American Indians or whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They just don't care.  But --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  It's a very sad situation.
L:  Oh, I -- I think they should just get out as soon as possible, and let the UN, Red Cross, whoever supplies humanitarian aid, to rebuild their country.  But, you know, it's a lot of money over there.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think once they found all that stores of money, or whatever Saddam was hiding, I don't think we should have to be giving them that much aid.  You know --
R:  You --
L:  -- a lot of those people were poor and desperate 'cause Saddam didn't like that group.  He didn't like the Shiites, or the Ku- -- Shiites, so he cut off their, you know, electricity.  They didn't have access to jobs.  And they were routinely, you know, brutalized.
R:  Yeah.  He was a dictator --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and he took all the money for himself.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, he was like everybody else -- has to fight in the street.  I'm at home drinking cognac.
L:  And there you go. [LAUGH]  
R:  Which is not that different from how we -- other -- how America is.  I mean, we're very, very lucky.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, let's face it, the top does take -- make sure they take theirs.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's funny how that's coming out now, but everybody's -- that -- I always knew, but I don't know why everyone else didn't know.  But, however, we're seeing how much thievery and stuff is really --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- going on.
L:  -- I know.  I was talking to journalists [inaudible] and I'm thinking[?], like, "You know, that's really --" but, ah, you know, these people, like -- and how much did they say?  They said four billion in cash -- in American dollars?
R:  Oh, that they found?
L:  Yeah, they found.  Billion.  Not a million -- billion.
R:  Oh my God.
L:  And they were saying, "Well, we -- you know, if -- if -- if the money isn't counterfeit" -- this is what they'd written in the paper -- "Then the money belongs to the Iraqi people".
R:  Right.  But the Iraqi people need to pay us back and start rebuilding their own society --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- and --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- using their oil reserves.
L:  If they find that.  And I'm, like, "Who -- who you gonna turn that much money over to, over there?"
R:  I know.  I felt funny about the b- -- um, the soldiers who found it, 'cause they -- at first they were heros one day.  Then of course, you know, three people had to take some money.
L:  Yeah, true.
R:  But, I don't know.  I don't -- I don't know what I'd have done if I had found boxes and boxes of money.
L:  You know something?  I didn't know that was artwork.  I just --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- found it. You got a picture of Saddam --
R:  I'd have been heading over the border to Turkey.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  I'd have been running myself.  I'd have just been AWOL.  It would've been too bad.  I feel bad about it, but I'm -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It'd have been hard, I must admit.
L:  Oh, God, yeah.  And they say, "Well, you know" -- 
R:  I wonder about that sometimes.  You know, what -- what would you do if you just found a bag of money?
L:  Oh well -- untouched?  Yeah, I don't know.  If I saw it drop out some old lady's pocketbook I'd give it back to her.
R:  Yeah, that -- yeah, see, it just depends.  That's -- that's good.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, just wait it out. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  Sometimes good guys don't -- don't finish first.  They finish last.  And it --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- might be more trouble than it's worth.  You know, I always have that nightmare scenario -- I find it and give it to 'em and they think I stole it to begin with, and I was just trying to do the right thing.
R:  Right.
L:  And so [LAUGH] --
R:  Is -- that -- that's terrible.  That's true, nice guys don't always finish first.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  A lot of times they don't.
L:  Oh, I'm a bit of a pessimist, so [LAUGH] --
R:  So, I don't know what we're gonna do in Iraq these days.  See, it's terrible what they let happen to the art museum.  I'm very upset about --
L:  Yes, absolutely.  Not just -- you know, when they looted, um -- I love museums and things, you know.  That kind of hurt, you know, because that is the cradle of, you know, civilization.
R:  It is.
L:  That stuff -- man, that's going back BC, not AD.  
R:  Right.
L:  You know, you're talking about before Christ, and they looted it.  But then, it was a heartwarming story where some of the Iraqis, you know, bought stuff back, you --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- know.
R:  -- did they?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, I didn't hear that.
L:  But --
R:  That's --
L:  -- yeah --
R:  -- good though --
L:  Some people --
R:  -- 'cause I figure --
L:  -- they -- they bought --
R:  -- except --
L:  -- it back.
R:  -- that what goes into private collections --
L:  Mhm.  Oh, but the rest of it is on the black market for sure.
R:  Yeah, but it -- but, so, I mean, that's -- that's something we should just pay for and get it back.
L:  Mm.
R:  That's -- that's helping the economy.  It --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is gonna be a black market economy -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to a certain extent.
L:  Well, I hope it boosts ours 'cause this gas is still hovering around two dollars a gallon.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I --
R:  I live in New York City, so --
L:  Yeah.  I know [LAUGH] --
R:  -- so I'm not on the gas thing, but I guess a lot of other people are --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- very upset.
L:  We got a good mass +transport.  You know, I'm depending on my vehicle.  I was in LA, um, [COUGH] like, a month or so ago and was, like, two oh nine.
R:  Oh my God.
L:  And I was going, like, "I thought DC was high".  You know, it was one --
R:  But, then --
L:  It's one eighty five down here now.
R:  But then, what's funny is you think about it, gas is still cheaper than a gallon of milk.
L:  The -- the -- look at it.
R:  That's how --
L:  Like, 'cause the --
R:  -- you know, you -- 
L:  -- average gallon --
R:  -- have to --
L:  -- is dear, you --
R:  -- put it --
L:  -- know.
R:  -- in perspective.  So, you know we've really been terror- -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, we've really terrorizing [LAUGH] the world for a long time probably over --
L:  Yeah, I know.  I just never understood that concept of war boosts the economy.  Every time we're in a recession, you know, you have a war and it boosts the economy.  I'm saying -- well, they've had more people unemployed with this administration's term than they did with the last, so --
R:  Yeah.  It's --
L:  And I'm --
R:  -- unusual --
L:  -- gonna --
R:  -- because, um --
L:  -- say people need some jobs.
R:  -- I guess we didn't do any -- we didn't do -- I don't know -- the war didn't last enough -- enough -- long enough.  Or we didn't do enough building.  You know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- aerospace --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're not building aeroplanes and stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  I -- so -- I -- it -- it didn't --
L:  So, a --
R:  -- boost it --
L:  -- two --
R:  -- in the --
L:  -- week war.
R:  -- way that it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- used to do.
L:  What does that cost?  You know, it says boosting the economy -- I don't say, "Hm, we're in a war, I'm gonna go out and buy me a SUV this week".  I just don't see it. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't see the concept.  I'm holding on to every dollar. 
R:  I guess what -- well, the concept is usually they -- we go into military production.  And then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you have so many people who were in the workforce, who leave the workforce 'cause they're in the military.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that creates jobs.  Is that what's supposed to happen?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  'Cause I didn't -- I don't really --
L:  Yeah, I guess it --
R:  -- get it --
L:  -- was --
R:  -- either, but --
L:  -- Lockheed Martin and +Halliburton that really, [LAUGH] you know, ah, were, um -- profits went up.  But, you know, you just -- I just -- I haven't seen it.  I haven't seen that trickle down.  They need to do something here.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I think --
R:  I don't know. 
L:  -- a recession --
R:  We, as -- 
L:  -- over here --
R:  Bush has a problem with the economy.  I don't know what he's gonna do.  I don't -- 'cause New York is just ready to go crazy.  They're laying off people today.
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  And, um, it gets -- you know, when the city gets nas- nasty --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and --
L:  Well, I --
R:  -- dirty, it --
L:  How -- how --
R:  -- gets nasty and dirty --
L:  How well --
R:  -- quick.
