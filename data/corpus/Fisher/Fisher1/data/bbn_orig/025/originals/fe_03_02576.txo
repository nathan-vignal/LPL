L:  Hello.  This is --
R:  Hello.
L:  Yeah.  Uh, my name is Nancy.
R:  My name is Cammy.  This is my first call so I'm not exactly sure how this is gonna go. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, uh, we're both new.  This is my first one also. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no. [LAUGH]
L:  So, I guess we'll both, uh, wing. [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, they -- we're supposed to talk about the disarming of Iraq and what we think about that.
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I, um, well, um, I'm -- I'm for it.
L:  Well, I am too.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH] So we won't have a fight so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- maybe [LAUGH] -- I don't know if we're supposed to argue or not but it's kinda hard when we're both on the same side.  I mean --
R:  Right.  Right.  I -- I think it's a very important thing.  I'm -- definitely I'm very supportive of it.
L:  I am too.  I figure it -- we went this far.  We've lost this many lives, you know, let's don't quit like we did before.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  And, uh, I wish, you know, they would find, uh, more of the weapons and stuff but I guess maybe he was smarter than we thought and hid 'em a little better than we thought.
R:  Yeah.  Or, like they had said, um, des- -- maybe destroyed them or -- or sent them somewhere else.
L:  I seriously would doubt he would destroy 'em.  You know, from what I've heard on the news and everything, I was more inclined to think maybe they're hid -- you know, really buried deep or they're  -- hopefully not but he may have sent 'em to another country.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, how they're talking kinda Syria might be harboring them and stuff.  I'm hoping they ain't got the weapons.
L:  It's a strong possiblity but, you know, I -- didn't feel like sometime on the media that we don't always see or hear all that's going on and sometimes I think that's better. [MN]
R:  [MN] Right.  Right.
L:  Because, you know, in this -- sometimes they put too much out.
R:  Yeah.  That -- that's definitely true.
L:  And, you know, I'd rather not know than have too much on the news than have our boys in danger.
R:  Right, I'm -- as far as putting out too much, I'm -- I'm -- like, during the whole war thing, I was l- -- I was like, "Well, what if they're watching?  They're gonna see this.  They're gonna know where they're at" and all this.
L:  Right.  And they're supposed to be here in this country, some of 'em.
R:  [MN] Yeah.  Definitely.
L:  And, I mean, they can watch television.  They've got a telephone. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know.
R:  Right.  Might not be easy to get a hold of their -- their people over there but I'm sure they can do it if they need to.
L:  Well, I'm -- I mean, if they went to all the trouble they have I'm sure they've thought of things that we never would think of.  I hope our government is thinking of things we don't because if you're like me you're not trained in this sort of espionage and the --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- all that stuff [LAUGH].  I mean, Get Smart is about as far as I know from watching [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And let's hope they're not using that technology. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  Or maybe you're not old enough to remember Get Smart from television?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I -- I remember Maxwell Smart. [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, that was -- no, if they had an agent like him sometimes, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He was a little clumsy and crazy.
L:  But he was just stupid enough to pull it off. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  That's the thing though, right?
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Sometimes, you know, uh, the smartest people play dumb.
R:  Yeah.  That's defini- -- oh, yeah.  That is definitely true.
L:  And, you know, that is better than some of these that try to act like they know it all. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, uh, I would like, you know, a little more information when they do find something, you know, a little more detail in something that we could understand a little better.
R:  Right.  Yes, I do agree with that.
L:  But I don't know how, you know, basically they're gonna dig 'em out but that is --
R:  Well, I remember hearing, um, also that they -- they had found like a bunch of guns and stuff like that in, like, carnivals and stuff so, I mean, schools, hospitals, so, I mean, you're right on they could just be somewhere just plain like out in the desert or something, buried where no one would ever think of looking for something.
L:  Well, you know, the easiest way to hide something is to put it in plain sight.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] That's what --
R:  There you go.  Definitely.
L:  So, I mean, they might just be actually looking over it or some- --
R:  That's an idea.  Right.
L:  You know, it could be so plain nobody's ever thought there to look but to me to put it in the school to put the children in jeopardy is terrible.
R:  Yes.  Exactly.
L:  And in the hospitals, you know, that would be the worst fear in the world to think, you know, "I've got a loved one in the hospital and they might bomb it" but ...
R:  Right.  Or there's a bunch of chemical weapons in there and, you know, accidents happen.
L:  Right.  But those people, to be honest, don't seem like to their government they were that important.
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  And that's sad.
R:  Definitely.  Which is why we went over there and took care of the business we needed to and which is why I totally agree with that.
L:  I do too.  They --
R:  I think they maybe need to take a metal detector or some kind of sonar equipment or something and -- and just -- I mean, go looking in lakes or even -- I mean, you know, you never know their minds where -- how they can hide things.  Put it in a big old bubble under the lake or something.
L:  Well, they're supposed to have bunkers there so I think, you know, they should maybe be digging them out but they -- like I said, I expect there's a lot going on we don't know.
R:  Right.  Right.  Things they're just letting the media know to let us know but just giving them certain things and not saying everything.
L:  Well, like I said, you know, uh, like, oh, I guess -- got his name on the end of my tongue -- that, uh, reporter they kicked out, you know.
R:  Oh, Geraldo Rivera.
L:  Yeah.  That's him.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I do like to hear him but, you know, uh, I guess he was giving too much information.
R:  Yeah.  Draw on maps and everything on the floor.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I didn't get to see it though.  I mean, I heard about it and I've seen little previews of it but I was like I never actually watched his broadcast because I was watching, um, um, MSNBC and he was for the Fox Network.
L:  Well, I --
R:  And after that I turned over trying to catch a glimpse, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- like, "Well, I just want to see one of his reports". [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you're like me.  I'm always on the wrong channel at the wrong time. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  That is -- that's definitely me.
L:  Uh, but we can't get Fox.  I'm in the country so we're out --
R:  Oh, I'm in the country too.
L:  Oh, you do. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, maybe that's reason they matched us; two rural people. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, uh, out here, you know, we don't have satellite and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And so, you know, our -- it's limited. [LAUGH] But, uh, you can still catch enough on the news and a lot on the internet.
R:  Oh, yeah.  The internet definitely.  Actually I never -- I mean, I, you know, watch some of the things on just like on, you know, the AOL just, you know, right there what they had but I never went into it.  I al- -- I -- I stayed glued pretty much to the TV when it first happened.  I couldn't get away from the TV.
L:  Oh, yes.  I was, you know, there wanting to see how they did, uh, get everything out but, uh, after a while, you know, uh, every time they did anything you kinda got burned out on that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  After -- yeah, after so much into it, yeah, but I just -- I mean, it -- it was weird.  I guess because it was the first, I mean, time it's ever been televised so much like that but, I mean, I never really -- I mean, I watched war movies and stuff like that but never really been into it but I found myself amazed just, "Why am I watching this so much like that?"
L:  Well, you know, Vietnam was on but I was too young.  I never paid that much attention, to be honest.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You may be younger [LAUGH] but, you know, they did have some about the Vietnam War.  They would show the boys being carried out and everything.
R:  Only I -- what I saw of that was ever on movies.  I never -- I mean, I was -- I was alive during then, I think.  Sixty nine. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  You were there but you would have been too little --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- if you were born in sixty nine. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, you know, it was just kinda different.  I was -- uh, saw it in high school.  So you saw it in high school but still never paid that much attention.  You know, small town USA and -- where it went on, you know, for eleven years.
R:  Right.
L:  And so we just growed up, uh, thinking everybody naturally went to the army and -- so, I'm glad that part's over with.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, you know, I think that was a -- where, uh, like, Colin Powell was scared of going over there or he's either extra smart to make it sound that way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because that lasted so long and I'm thankful that we've got, you know, out and starting to disarm the --
