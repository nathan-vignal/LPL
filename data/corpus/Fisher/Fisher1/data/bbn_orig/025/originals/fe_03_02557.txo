R:  Hi.  My name is May.
L:  Hi.  I'm Betty.  How you doing?
R:  Fine, Betty.  How are you?
L:  Okay.  I'm in Maryland.  Where are you?
R:  I'm in South Carolina.
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  How's it going over there?
L:  Oh, it's going good.  We're right here outside of DC.
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  And we're retired military, so the things in Iraq we -- we agree with +wholeheartedly, ah, with --
R:  You know what?
L:  -- the government.
R:  [LAUGH] I'm so glad.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 'Cause I didn't know, you know.  And I said, "Oh gosh, I don't know what to say", because I don't wanna start, like, a fight with anybody.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  But I agree too.
L:  My husband was over there in the first campaign.  And we should've gone in and completed the job --
R:  I absolutely --
L:  -- in the first place.
R:  -- totally agree.  And I'm not a real aggressive type person --
L:  Right.
R:  -- either, you know.
L:  I know.  We weren't either.  We really were not.  And we just thank God that we've got young men and women that's willing to go out there and fight for freedom.
R:  I abso- -- I -- I can't agree with you more.  I mean, it actually makes me kind of teary just talking --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- about it.  It really does.
L:  I -- I love my country.
R:  So do I.
L:  I'm -- I'm -- I'm one of the most patriotic souls you're gonna see in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- this world.
R:  Mhm.
L:  God has been too good to us.  This country has come a long way, so you should know we're gonna wanna fight for freedom for someone.
R:  I -- I -- I can't agree more.  Um, I -- I -- I -- especially -- I mean, well, I've always felt that way.  I felt that way during Desert Storm too --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- you know.
L:  Right.
R:  So -- and I was just sorry that -- the -- it -- the whole thing -- I -- you know, I hated to say I wished that we could've gone in there and just done away with, ah --
L:  Saddam --
R:  -- with Saddam Hussein right then and there, you know, because I -- I don't normally wish death on anyone.
L:  Correct.
R:  You know?
L:  Correct.
R:  So, I feel bad even saying it, but --
L:  It -- it's something that needed to be done before it got worse.
R:  Exactly.  I -- I totally agree.  And I -- and I really wonder if Bush is gonna pay the price for it in the end, like his father did.
L:  Um --
R:  You know?
L:  He's a hero right now.
R:  In my mind he is.
L:  I didn't vote for him, but --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- he's my president.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And I follow him. [LAUGH]  I tell you, I -- I -- the leadership of my country is not what I want it to be, but I tell you, it's not the worst thing out there.
R:  A- absolutely not.  And -- and one of the -- I think one of the things that represents that very well is the whole, um, election process.
L:  Thank you.
R:  Where a lot of people were laughing at us and saying, "Well, this is ridiculous".  
L:  [MN] Oh.
R:  I'm saying to them, "Yeah, well, in your country if that had happened, they would've said, 'Tough luck, this is your president and like it or lump it'".
L:  Th- this is what you're stuck with.
R:  Exactly.  And yeah, we went through the months and months of the voting and the courts and the systems and everything.  To me, it was fascinating, and I thought, "This is our country".  This shows you that it matters --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if we vote and -- and we actually do have a say.
L:  You're right, that, ah, actually what we said mattered.  And it went to the highest courts in the land.
R:  Exactly.  And I thought it was a beautiful way to represent our country.  I did.  I mean, I don't care if people were laughing.  I thought it was awesome.
L:  I --
R:  I really did.
L:  I -- I'd do it again in a heartbeat.
R:  I would too.  I'm glad that I was alive to see that happen.
L:  I know.
R:  I really was.  I --
L:  Democracy --
R:  -- thought --
L:  -- at work.
R:  -- it was fascinating.  Ah, exactly.
L:  That's what -- what it was.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my husband even called to see if he can go back on active duty --.
R:  No kidding?
L:  -- when all of this happened.  And once you're retired they will not put you back on active roles.  That's the only sad thing about it.
R:  How did you feel about that?  I mean, if they had said yes, what would you have felt about that?
L:  Oh, we were ready to go in -- in a heartbeat.  Um, I'm -- I'm a government worker myself and I'm retired.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  And I would've come back on the role, as a social worker.  I di- -- I support my country.
R:  Wow.  That's -- that's really something.
L:  Um, we called -- it was so funny -- when nine eleven happened.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, we called and said -- to see if they would let people in on active service.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they said they had been flooded with more retirees and disabilities -- people wanting to come back in fight for the service, and we've had to tell 'em no.
R:  Wow.
L:  Isn't --
R:  Isn't that something?
L:  I mean, they were receiving so many new recruits that they had to -- they were overwhelmed with all the, um, people trying to volunteer to go in.
R:  Yeah.
L:  People care about their country.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And, you know, I happened to be up in Canada when nine eleven happened.  I was up there for a couple of years on business.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And I've never felt -- you -- you get up there in Canada for a while and you kind of forget, because it's so similar to the United States, you --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- know.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, it's not you look around -- it looks all that different or anything.  Everybody speaks English --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- and, you know, you --
L:  Right.
R:  -- get used to it.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And, ah, when it happened thought -- the day that it happened, I felt -- ah, I'd never felt so far from home as I did that day.  I was so down and crying.  And --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I can't tell you how uplifting it was the way the Canadians reacted to the whole thing.  I mean, it was like -- I felt like I was surrounded by friends.
L:  Every country did.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, they -- they felt so -- you know, they felt a kindrence[?] to America.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  As -- as much as they argue about Americans, the -- that kindrence came back.
R:  Uh- -- oh absolutely.
L:  You know --
R:  It was -- it was -- it was very heart warming.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It really was.  It made me feel good.
L:  I know it made me feel excellent, and I thank God for it every day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, the warmth that people made -- can -- can bring to you.  I really do.
R:  I do too.  And I -- ah, I was a little distressed when there were -- I mean, I guess I expected, you know, war protests and such things, having lived through the whole Vietnam thing.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  You know?  Um, but, I -- I was still disheartened when -- when I -- when I was reading about the objections and the -- and I -- and -- and I don't know if you watched the Academy Awards, but the -- the one guy that made the speech and said that it --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- was --
L:  Oh God.
R:  Did that just make you wanna throw something at your TV screen?
L:  [LAUGH] No, I wanted a AK47, okay.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I wanted the real thing.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I really did.
R:  [LAUGH] That's good.
L:  He was in my sights. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  One of those bombs I paid for --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- drop it on him.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm not gonna lie to you.
R: [LAUGH] 
L:  You don't dare say that.  I don't care -- that -- and -- and it's something about the military, and they'll tell you that.  We don't agree -- um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we don't wanna go to war.
R:  Mhm.  Oh, sure.
L:  But we follow the orders given to us.
R:  Right.  I know.  And that -- and that's a beautiful thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It really is.  I mean, I don't think anybody wants to go to war.
L:  They don't.
R:  But, if it -- if it's for a reason that -- especially a reason that you believe in, and if you're for your country -- um, I mean, I -- God bless the people that will do that, you know.  I [COUGH] --
L:  I remember my, um -- my first tour in the military.  Um, I was pregnant and I got out, had the baby, and went back in three months later.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  And remarried because I divorced with the first one.  And it's -- my baby was three months old -- she was born in September, and October I got orders for Korea.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  And we couldn't take the children with us.  And that was the hardest thing I had to do.  But, I said, "I swore an oath to my country that I would defend my country", and I left my children with my mother.
R:  No fooling?   What year was this?
L:  This was in nineteen eight three -- um, excuse me, nineteen eighty.
R:  Nineteen eighty?
L:  We went from, um, nineteen eighty to eighty one.
R:  Oh.
L:  And then we came back.  And then we got orders for Germany in eighty six.  We packed up the house -- sold the house in April.  My father da- -- died in May.
R:  Oh.
L:  Left my mother a widower.  I still packed up my house and left with my husband, over to Germany.  And he went to Desert Storm from there.
R:  Good heavens.
L:  And I was very -- and that was a quick war.  They -- they went over there.  I mean, the government supported us so much while we were over there.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  We were [SIGH] -- we -- we were living in the Germany economy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but on mil- -- ah, military installations.  They sent stuff in, they guarded us twenty four hours a day.  They did some of everything.  While we were there, we had another pregnancy and lost the child -- the baby died.
R:  I'm sorry.
L:  They flew us back.  Escorted -- the baby's body had to be escorted twenty four hours until he was in the ground.
R:  Oh my gosh.
L:  They paid for everything. You would never think that a child of service mother would be paid for.  You always knew a service mother was to be taken care of.
R:  Yes.
L:  We had no costs -- nothing.  We have a great government.  People -- you -- I don't know if you have any military experience --
R:  No, I --
L:  -- but --
R:  -- have none, but --
L:  -- you don't -- you don't know what they're doing for us.  We -- we make low salaries, but it -- we don't care.
R:  You know what?  Don't you -- I -- I -- listening to you -- and I'm so happy to hear that, because, ah, you know, if anybody deserves it, the military does.  I wish that the -- the general public was more aware of things like that.
L:  I mean, my country is so good to me.  Um, you won't ever hear me say something wrong about it.  I'll pick up a gun today --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and fight.  And just about every American will say that.  And I -- these kids today, all they want from the military is a -- a paycheck.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  It hurt my heart.  'Cause believe it or not, you know where I'm headed?  My --
R:  Where's that?
L:  -- daughter is in Kansas -- stationed at Fort Riley, Kansas.  She's stationed, um, active duty.
R:  Your daughter is? 
L:  Right.  Her husband -- both of them were active duty.
R:  Good heavens.
L:  They went to Kuwait.
R:  Uh-huh.   
L:  They came back.  They had a baby.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  He got out of the service, and he won't go back in because they're at war. [PAUSE]  So, they called last night -- they've been having domestic problems, and --
R:  Oh, I'm sorry.
L:  -- they have a baby.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  And I -- I -- I've had the baby -- the baby's six months old.  I've had the baby three months of the baby's life, right?
R:  Right.
L:  The MPs -- I just called. The MPs are there.  They've just took custody of the child.  I've gotta fly out -- like, as soon as we hang up the phone I'm --
R:  No --
L:  -- heading --
R:  -- kidding?
L:  -- to the airport.
R:  Oh.
L:  But, you know, my government has stepped in -- the military have stepped in and said, "We will have custody of this child for you when you fly in, and give you this baby".
R:  Oh. [MN] I have to tell you -- well, you're a wonderful grandmother too.
L:  Well, I've been blessed.  God is good.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He's good to all of us.  I'm -- I'm not the most devoutful[?] Christian -- I could be better.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, th- --
