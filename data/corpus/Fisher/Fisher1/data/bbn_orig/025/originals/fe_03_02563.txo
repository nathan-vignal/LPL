L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Dianne.
R:  Hi, I'm Dawn.
L:  Hi.  How ya doing, Dawn?
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I had a little bit of trouble hearing what the topic was.
R:  Yeah.  Me as well.  Um, it's regarding Iraq, uh, whether we feel -- you know, what is our opinion, uh, whether they should arm them or whether they should, um -- how should they go about handling the war with Iraq.
L:  Uh-huh.  Okay.  I have some certain thoughts.  What are your feelings?
R:  Um, I'm not really sure how I feel because I know that, like, weapons, uh -- you know, the use of weapons just escalates problems.
L:  That's -- that's true too.
R:  You know, but then with some people it's like you have to treat them the way they act.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And -- and they haven't been acting towards, uh, the US very nicely.
L:  No, they haven't.  It's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- kind of a double blade sword there, that's for sure.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  [COUGH] I think we do need to arm their military.  I mean, once everything's re- reformed.  And -- and their police -- the policing.
R:  Yes.  Definitely.  I mean, I think -- I mean, I don't know, do you feel that the president is doing his -- and the mayor is doing this -- his part?  Like, I s- -- I somewhat feel that, uh, they're siding with, uh, Iraq too much.  Like, they're favor -- I feel they're favor- -- uh, that the president is favoring Iraq and he's not doing what he can to, uh, protect us.
L:  Um, it's -- they picked such a tough subject.  This is my first call and they probably picked a tough subject 'cause I've got a brother in special forces that's over there.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, um, you know, I really think that --
R:  Are you --
L:  I think for the media --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's -- it's probably put out there to look that way.  I m- -- I -- I really don't know.
R:  Are you from New York?
L:  No.  I'm not.  I'm from North Carolina.
R:  Oh, okay.  Because I -- I'm in New York, yeah.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, I mean, I don't know, like if your president -- because I know we -- oh, no, well, yeah, we have the same president and the same mayor.  You know, so I mean it's a -- so, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I think it --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- lies -- the problem really lies with, you know, the type of security and the type of actions that, uh, they're going to take.  You know, that plays a part for all of us.
L:  Exactly.  But I do think it's going to be years in the making.
R:  Oh really.
L:  I just don't think it's something they're going to be able to go in and bing, bang, bomb, it's done in a month.
R:  Wow.
L:  I think it's gonna be years of rebuilding, years of -- of retraining because these people were in the thought process of hate and they were geared that way and they lived that way and if they didn't they were -- they were killed.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I think it's going to take years of commitment by the United States and -- and other, um, top countries to go in there and really make a difference because I feel --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- if we don't do something to change the way that they've lived and the only message that they know that things are not going to improve whatsoever for them.  I mean, we can go in and rebuild all we want but unless -- unless we give them the ability and the knowledge and the example of how to run a country, how to live in non hate and acceptance I think -- I just think it's all gonna be for naught because my personal feeling is that whether they get Saddam Hussein or Bin Laden or whoever in any of these --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- other countries, it's really not going to matter because they are merely the way -- I figure it is a cancer and it's a malignancy and just by removing that one growth it is still already spread.
R:  Right.  Because they have other people that are under them.
L:  Exactly.  So, we have to treat the entire --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- population in order to ever -- ever change anything and I just don't think that's going to be an overnight process.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, like, what was it?  About a month or two ago when we had such scares that they could bomb us that, you know, we cou- -- we were under, uh, terroris- -- we were going to be terrorized.  I mean, we would never know when or how.  I mean, you know, imagine just like walking down the street one day and, like, fainting and never waking up, you know, but -- you know, they're putting poisonous gases in the air, or, you know, whether they're just gonna blow us up at any given moment.
L:  Exactly.  But this is w- --
R:  I mean, that's --
L:  It's hard for us to understand living in a free society what the people of these other countries --
R:  Mm.
L:  This is the way they live all the time.  This is all they know.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  I mean, it's not -- I mean, if I saw a tank driving down my street, I would just, like, panic.  But these people are used to seeing this.  I mean, they go to sleep at night hearing bombs and it's -- and it's long before we came in, you know, as in the United States, and, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the coalition.  It's just that, these people, this is what they know and I think we just really have to try to change their thinking process to -- that this is not acceptable and then who's to say, I mean, you know, they -- I -- I wonder, are we any better than they are, trying to force our beliefs on them?  I don't know.  But, I mean, you know, it's -- d- during the fall of, uh, Russia there, many people, many civilians, they -- they died because they didn't know how to defend themselves and -- and they doofed[?] themselves due to the fact that the government had always taken care of them.  Maybe the government took care of them poorly.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  But the fact remains that they were taken care of and so when they were left to make their own living and supply their own rent and their own medicines, many of them just couldn't survive it.  So, we've got a lot of work ahead of us.  You know, we -- we bit off a big piece here but I think in order to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ensure our safety it was something that had to be done.  I mean, I'm in -- I'm in an agreement that it had to be done.  I wish it --
R:  Right.
L:  I just wish it hadn't had to have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- been done.
R:  But you know what the thing is, I mean, in this place another big part, uh, we never went over there just like, uh -- how do we say, um, just -- um, oh, what am I looking for?  Just bombing their country.  You know, I mean, just blowing up a plane, hijacking a plane.  I mean, we never did any [inaudible] or U- Uni- United States people never did anything like that to them.  I mean, why -- you know, why in the world, you know, would they take it upon themselves to, like, you know, hijack a plane and, like, kill thousands and thou- -- innocent thou- -- thousands of innocent people.
L:  Because these people are bred in hate.
R:  Oh, God.
L:  I mean, this is all they know.  I mean, they don't have CNN and they don't have -- they got the Iraqi TV which they're listening to what they are being told which is what the government wants them to hear and they're brought up from a very young age to hate, hate, hate and, I mean, they live in such poverty that, you know, someone tells them, "Well, you go ahead and hijack this plane and I'll make sure that your family gets ten thousand dollars"  Well, they're so --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  They're so desperate that they go ahead and they do these things and there's no telling that there's any follow up that what has been promised them obviously is going to happen --
R:  Mhm.
L:  The reason for all these suicides --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- folks and stuff, you know, what would possess a person to arm themselves with a bomb and -- and walk into a group of people.  I mean, it's just the mindset.  I mean, they killed people that the kids -- they went to, um, the homes to recruit young men into the military after the conflict started and if they refused to go they killed one of their siblings.
R:  Mm.
L:  And -- and they would continue to do it till --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they went so these people had no choice.  They -- they know no other way.
R:  Hm.
L:  It meant -- I -- I don't know.  I -- we've got a lot of work not only rebuilding the -- the country and the physical structures but we've got to try and get to the people and I think the older they are the more difficult it's gonna be because their minds are made up it's 'cause -- it's all they know.  You know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the old -- the old adage, "We -- we live what we learn".  This is what they've learned.  So, we have a big job ahead of us but I -- I did think I heard on the question something about arming them and I do think that we --
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, they do need to be -- they need to be able to be self protected.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, our military, our law enforcement agencies all have weapons.  I'm not saying that we should go into every household and say, "Here.  Here's a grenade".  But I think for them to live --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in a dem- democratic, they've got to be able to have the same choices than any other democracy has that if they -- they want, they can have.  You know what I'm saying?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know.  I -- I don't -- I just don't think it's -- and from talking to, like I said, my brother, I just don't think this is going to be a short -- short term goal.  This is -- this is going to be a very long process.
R:  Yeah.  Either that or, you know, many people are gonna --
