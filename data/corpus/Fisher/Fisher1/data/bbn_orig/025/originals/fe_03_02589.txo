R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is Stacey.
L:  I'm Christine.
R:  Hi, Christine.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Um, I am actually from DC.
R:  Oh, you are?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  Are you --
L:  And where are you --
R:  -- a republican or democrat?
L:  Um, I'm a republican.
R:  Oh, you are?  I'm democrat. [LAUGH]
L:  You are?  This is --
R:  Yes [LAUGH]
L:  -- going to be an interesting conversation. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] This should be a very good conversation.
L:  And where are you calling from?
R:  New Jersey.
L:  Oh, okay.  Not too far away.
R:  I, uh -- well, actually I've lived in like twelve states.  My father was in construction.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, I'm in --
R:  And --
L:  -- the military so I've lived --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- quite a number of places.
R:  You know, we were called construction brats 'cause we had to go where the work was.
L:  Right.
R:  So, what do you think?
L:  Um, well [LAUGH] being in the military, um, I pretty much go where I'm told and -- and do what I'm told in -- in --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a sense.  Um, you know, and -- and the commander in chief has said that that's what we're gonna do so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's what we're gonna do.
R:  Well, the -- the thing that bothers me was the reason that he went against the UN was because he swore up and down that there was weapons of mass destruction.  Well, now all of a sudden his tone has changed and it's like, well, the original reason he went in there was to free the Iraqi people from the Saddam Hussein regime and to me to switch after the fact because they can't find weapons of mass destruction doesn't make it okay.  You know what I'm saying?
L:  I don't -- I don't think that he's -- I don't think that he's completely switched.  I mean, he's -- he definitely has said, you know, "We've done a great thing" but we're still --
R:  Have we?
L:  You know, there's -- I think we have.
R:  If it means -- if it means that our own country might economically suffer, have we done a good thing?  If the people over there turn against America and eventually become like a Taliban, have we really --
L:  You know, I --
R:  -- done a good thing?
L:  -- honestly think the people -- the -- the people over there in general the -- the bulk of the people have been amazingly receptive to servicemen.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  I can -- I see that point but then there's also the people there that are saying, "Get out.  Go home, already" you know.  "Y- you --"
L:  Well, you --
R:  "-- did what you came here and said you were gonna do, which was get rid of Saddam --"
L:  And you know --
R:  "So, now --"
L:  -- what?
R:  "-- leave --"
L:  We're packing --
R:  "-- let us take --"
L:  -- up and we were -- did you --
R:  "-- care of matters".
L:  Did you watch yesterday?  We are leaving.  We are leaving but the president gave a speech a- aboard a naval ship that he's --
R:  I did watch it, yes.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah --
R:  I watched it.
L:  So, we are leaving.  We're -- you know, we -- this is --
R:  Y- --
L:  This is thicker than --
R:  The majority.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  The majority's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- leaving but --
L:  Right.  But w- --
R:  -- there is going to be --
L:  -- you know, we're still in Bosnia --
R:  -- people there.
L:  -- that Clinton -- Clinton put us in Bosnia and there's no reason for us to be there because the minute you -- you know, basically I'm -- I'm tired.  I'm tired of pack your bags and go and, um --
R:  You may pack your bags and had to leave again.
L:  Right, you know, and that it --
R:  It's as simple as that.
L: -- and you get home for a little while.
R:  It's as simple as that because I think with the success that he had in Iran he may go elsewhere.  Syria.  I -- I meant --
L:  But I -- I understand --
R:  -- Iraq.  He may go to Syria.  He may go to Iran.  We may have another Vietnam.
L:  You know --
R:  In -- in North Korea.
L:  I -- I don't think that.  I don't think that but the other thing is is that we're spread too thin because Clinton told us that we were supposed to -- that he was gonna pull us out of Bosnia and we're still sending troops over there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, we're getting spread too thin and I'm --
R:  And Bush --
L:  -- tired.
R:  -- when he was campaigning on the trail said, "Bring our troops home".
L:  I understand that.
R:  We don't -- we are not the police of the world but now he's become the head chief police of the whole world.
L:  You know --
R:  You know, like, what he says --
L:  It's my job to support him and -- and I will honestly do that and I --
R:  I understand that because --
L:  And I'm not gonna --
R:  -- you are in the --
L:  -- say that --
R:  -- military.
L:  -- I'm not tired of -- of it, uh, and that --
R:  I -- I've been trying --
L:  -- we need to take --
R:  -- to encourage my son to go in the military for the simple fact of the benefits that they have.
L:  Right.
R:  You know what I'm saying?  I'm --
L:  Right.
R:  This is not -- this is -- this is a thing against Bush.  This is not against our military; has nothing to do with our military.  Our military does what our commander in chief does tell them to do.  That's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- their job.
L:  Right.
R:  That's your job to do that.  You know, it's not your job to question but being that I'm not in the military --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's my job is to question him.
L:  Right.
R:  And I think --
L:  No.  And I --
R:  -- that there aren't --
L:  -- agree with that.
R:  -- enough people -- there aren't enough people questioning him.
L:  Well, you know, here's the thing --
R:  I took a survey --
L:  -- there are too many people questioning him in such a way that it brings, um -- let's say it's such negativity, uh, you know, people who are, you know, lying down in the streets, um, and blocking traffic and -- and such extremists and they're bringing attention to themselves.  They're people who are questioning it based on its --
R:  Okay, let's put it to you --
L:  -- face value.  It's --
R:  -- this way.  Um, you know, that -- that's one of our freedoms.  That's our right.  People have the right to do that.  If they're fool enough to lay down and block traffic and get run over, shame on them.  That's the way I look at it.  That's one of our freedoms.
L:  You know what, though?  One of our other freedoms -- what I -- you know, what I really like -- I actually had heard this on a -- on, um, a radio talk show hear in DC and somebody made the comment that freedom of speech is that you have the freedom to speak your mind but I have the freedom to not listen.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  So, um --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know, the freedom of your speech when it --
R:  My husband's --
L:  -- infringes on --
R:  -- republican, you can --
L:  -- my --
R:  -- imagine. [LAUGH]
L:  What's that?
R:  My husband's republican.
L:  Oh.  Oh, god.
R:  He grew up republican.  His -- his whole line of family since they moved here in eighteen fifty four.  All --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- republicans down the line and --
L:  And he marries a democrat? [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Right.  And I am.  I'm a true democrat and I took a poll on, uh, the computer the other day and they asked questions: are you democrat?  Yes.  Are you extreme democrat; democrat; sort of dem- -- and I put extreme democrat --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I am, you know?
L:  Right.
L:  And then they also asked: do you support the war in Iraq, under, you know, like certain types of conditions?  Do you support Bush?  Do you support our -- our troops but disagree with Bush?  That's what I put.
L:  Right.
R:  I support our troops a hundred percent.  They're doing their --
L:  Right.  You know, because --
R:  -- job.
L:  -- as far as I'm concerned the minute that any American soldier put his foot on the ground in Iraq that was when disagreements stop.  You -- you have to support your troops, period.
R:  Right.
L:  We're there.
R:  Did you just recently get back or were you -- did you go there?
L:  Um, I was not in Iraq.  I was in Saudi.
R:  Where?
L:  Saudi.  Saudi Arabia.
R:  Oh, you were in Saudi Arabia.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, um, yeah. [LAUGH] So, you know, um, it's a little personal, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I've got sand on my boots, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, uh -- so, like I said, the minute that we put -- the minute that we put our feet on the soil --
R:  Well, we did go in there for a reason and that was because Bush told us that this was a coun- country that threatened us with weapons of mass destru- destruction --
L:  But, if you've --
R:  Now --
L:  -- known [inaudible] --
R:  -- we were -- they were never a threat --
L:  -- for the Taliban.
R:  -- to us and we had no right to preempt a war against them.  Now India may preempt a war against Pakistan because if America can do it -- if America can do it, if President Bush can do it, then other countries can too.  This is setting a very dangerous precedent.  If we can go against --
L:  Well, you know what they set --
R:  the UN --
L:  -- dangerous precedent --
R:  -- then other countries --
L:  -- when they put --
R:  -- can.
L:  -- two planes into the two towers.
R:  Excuse me?
L:  They put -- they put a very dangerous precedent when they flew two planes into our towers.
R:  Who's they?  Not Iraq.  The Taliban did that.
L:  They have -- they have ties with --
R:  The Taliban is --
L:  -- Taliban.  They've linked them -- because they've linked Saddam Hussein -- who do you think was the money behind it?
R:  The Taliban --
L:  They --
R:  -- have cells all over the world not just -- there -- there's --
L:  Right, but who do you think --
R:  There's no --
L:  -- is funding --
R:  They have found one --
L:  -- Osama Bin Laden.
R:  -- one small group of people who were from the Taliban in Iraq.  And I read the paper and on the computer -- I read the paper every day and they found one small cell of about six men who were with the Taliban, okay?
L:  And they've also linked money --
R:  The Taliban is --
L:  -- money from Saddam --
R:  -- originated in --
L:  -- to Osama.
R:  -- Afghanistan and they're all Saudi Arabians.  They're not Iraqis.  They're not Iranians, Syrians, Indians, Pakistanis.  They are ninety nine percent Saudi Arabia.  Why did we go attack a country who had absolutely nothing to do with nine eleven?
L:  Because Saddam has been giving them money and the small cell are the people that have been running the country.  We're not fighting the war against the Iraqi people --
R:  Well, I w- --
L:  -- we're fighting the war --
R:  I won't believe that --
L:  -- against the --
R:  -- until I see --
L:  -- people in power.
R:  -- some proof that Saddam was giving them money.  Saddam --
L:  They found it.
R:  -- was giving himself money.  You see his six palaces along the Tigris River.  You know, he was giving himself the money.  He wasn't giving it anybody else, believe me.  If he was he would have given it to the poor people in his own country.
L:  Are you kidding me?  He is the one that's imprisoning the poor people in his own country.
R:  He's --
L:  He is the one --
R:  -- oppressing them.
L:  -- that's been throwing the children in jail.
R:  He's oppressing them and he's also -- because he is --
L:  So, he certainly wouldn't be giving --
R:  -- a dictator.
L:  -- his money to them.
R:  If they say something that he doesn't like he'll have them killed.  There's no doubt about that.  I'm not --
L:  But there's no reason why --
R:  -- saying that's --
L:  -- he'd be giving them any money.  He's not.
R:  I'm not saying that --
L:  He's giving them to --
R:  -- what he was doing was right.  I'm just saying what we did was --
