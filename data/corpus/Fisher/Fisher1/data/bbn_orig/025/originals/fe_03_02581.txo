R:  Uh, hi, I'm Veronica.
L:  Veronica.
R:  Hello.
L:  Lake?  No.  This is Eli.  I'm in Nashville, Tennessee.
R:  Okay.  I'm all the way in Philadelphia.
L:  You're in Philly?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I used to go to Philly when I was a kid and go to German Town.
R:  Oh.
L:  Of course it's changed, I'm sure, a lot.
R:  Not German Town so much.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They've been trying to keep that historically accurate and kind of the same.
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, we're supposed to talk about Iraq?
R:  Right.  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] it sounds like we can just generally talk about what we think should be done at this point about the whole issue.
L:  [MN] Well --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- what I think they should do actually --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is to, uh, try and set up a democratic government that is secular.  In other words, in Iran, as you know, uh, the clerics run the country according to what their interpretation of the Koran is --
R:  Right.
L:  -- which is terrible.  And if they allow that to happen then they'll be in the same fix as they were before because they're nearly like dictators.
R:  Right.  Um, the problem with trying to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do that is that it might not be successful because it's hard to go half way across the earth to people living an entirely different culture and tell them to change their culture.  It's like even though we know it's going to run better our way, um, they're in a part of the world --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where everybody does it a totally --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- different way for thousands of years and it's hard for --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, they're not gonna accept someone else coming over and saying, "Hey, you know, now we're the boss of you and we say you should do it this way".  Um, I think it's gonna be very hard.
L:  [NOISE] It is gonna be very hard but from what I've read and the internet and the news, the president is adamant that he's gonna have a democratic government that's gonna be secular and Iran used to be, you know, before the shah of Iran went out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they're gonna do it one way or the other --
R:  Well [MN] --
L:  -- but it's gonna be troublesome of course because we're gonna be in there for years.
R:  See, do you feel that it's the job of the U- -- the US to go all over the world and do this or would you --
L:  No.
R:  -- rather see someone else do it.
L:  No, it isn't.  And, uh, but since we're in there and we started this we may as well finish it because if we leave and they don't have a democratic government it's gonna be autocratic and there are gonna be dictators but they're --
R:  Right.
L:  -- gonna be clerics clothing instead of army uniforms.
R:  Yeah.  At this point now that -- now that we're in there, we really have an obligation to try to, you know, help the people as much as possible to get everything straightened out.  We can't just like leave them at this point.  It's n- -- you know --
L:  No.
R:  -- we have to try to --
L:  And I don't think we should go everywhere and -- and straighten out because Syria is nearly as bad as Iraq --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- although Syria, if you don't get into politics, they leave you alone.  But they are harboring Islamic jihad and, uh, all these people that are fighting and in -- in Palestine in Israel.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, they've gotta get rid of those people bef- -- because otherwise this Israeli thing will never -- never be solved.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I'm not sure it ever will be solved anyway.  You know, I think it's one of those things that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're never gon- -- they're -- they're just generations of people who are raising their kids to never be happy with the -- like, to just the hate the other people and it's -- you know, the government can try to force them to change or might set up some kind of detente or something but I think there -- there's just like a cultural hatred in there that I don't know if -- if it'll ever go away.  It's like trying to solve the racial problem in the US or something.  There's always gonna be people who they just have, like, a hatred that you can't destroy.
L:  Well, the, uh -- you see, when the shah was there, you know, uh, when he took over, they were free.  They did what they wanted and -- you know, until the clerics got in there and threw him out because they felt that they are too westernized --
R:  Yeah.
L:  In I- -- in Iraq, uh, all the money will go to the clerics and -- and if you do something wrong, if you shoplift, they'll cut your arm off.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, it's -- it's a culture that we don't have to allow but, like I said, we've lost some people in there and we're gonna lose more and we can't just leave until it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- becomes a -- a secular democracy.  And they'll run it themselves.  You know, they're --
R:  Yeah.  Hopefully.
L:  But it's, uh -- who -- I -- I'm not smart enough to understand how to do it but they're gonna do it, I'll tell ya.  Because as long as Bush is in power he's gonna do that.
R:  Well, do the people -- like, say you're just an average Iraqi person on the street and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, you hated the dictatorship but you're very religious, um, and then they come along and they say, "Okay, now the -- the government is going to be totally secular" and, um, I wonder if even the people who are reasonable and -- and don- -- didn't like the dictatorship if they're gonna have, uh, worries about doing something that might make them feel like they're rejecting the religion or something.
L:  Well, th- they can be taught.  You see, the religious people can have their thing.  You know, they -- they can do whatever they want and everybody can have freedom of religion.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, there they find bibles.  You know, they used to shoot people for having the Old and New Testament.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, we can't have that, um, because if -- if we're not successful there and I figure it's gonna take ten years.  I may not be here by then.
R:  Yeah. [MN]
L:  Uh, but, uh, Syria is, uh, as bad a problem in a way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Although the people are free there and, uh, as long as you don't get political they leave you alone.
R:  Well, what do you --
L:  But if you --
R:  So, do you think that -- okay, so if you feel that this is a good mission for us to have or whatever, do you think we should go to Africa where those people are --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- like, killing each other all the time and --
L:  No.  No.  Because, uh, of course, Africa is a whole different game but I don't think we should go anywhere and change people.
R:  Okay.
L:  But if we don't like what they do then we don't have to trade with them.
R:  Right.
L:  And, uh, you know we don't have to do anything for 'em.
R:  Right.
L:  But, uh, you know, there's a lot of political pressure and, uh, trade barriers that we can put up, uh, where people will go to more friendly but -- but, like I say, there's -- I think there's forty wars going on in the world.
R:  Wow.
L:  And unfortunately all of them are Muslim inspired.  Not Muslim but fanatic Muslims --
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  -- who have taken their religion and made something different from it.  It isn't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the true Muslim religion those fanatics are doing.
R:  Right.
L:  Like the Taliban, he was -- you know, he was gonna do Osama Bin Laden, and Afghanistan was gonna do everything according to what he felt the religion said.
R:  Right.
L:  Which means women are nothing.
R:  Right.
L:  And they stay inside, can't work, can't teach, can't do anything.
R:  Right.
L:  And the men are the bosses and they can have two, three, four wives.
R:  Right.
L:  So, this -- there's a lot of brilliant people in the Middle East in the -- in the Muslim world.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they can't do much because, uh, it's against their culture.
R:  Right.
L:  But in Iran if you look back when the shah was there, see, the women were doctors and lawyers and --
R:  Oh, yeah, it was a normal --
L:  -- engineers --
R:  -- practically a normal type country.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  It was nearly normal unless you did something that he didn't like.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He'd kill ya.
R:  Right.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  You know [LAUGH].  So, it was a friendly, uh, dictatorship, I suppose.
R:  Mm.
L:  But, uh, women were nothing in -- in the Arab world, even in the free Arab world.
R:  Right.
L:  They're -- they're nothing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But if you look in the Middle East, the only democracy is Israel.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they wanna destroy them.
R:  Right.
L:  And the Syrians are -- are -- have training camps for Hezbollah and everything there and the -- it's crazy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't understand the, uh -- the -- and sending their own children as suicide bombers.
R:  Right.  See, that's -- that's why I think this is all gonna be so hard is because it's like they're -- they're so, so different from us that, you know --
L:  Fanatics.
R:  Yeah.  You know, it's hard to go in there and just say -- or to try to reason with them or do what we would normally do with other people because they're -- it's like they're from another planet, almost.  They're so, so different.  Their whole way of thinking is different.
L:  But, still, a lot of, uh, surveys that are made under cover and some Arabs that were over there, most people aren't fanatic.  It's just some.
R:  Right.
L:  But, uh, just like Hitler started and he took over the whole thing.
R:  Yeah.  See --
L:  And they -- that's the same with them and you're afraid of saying anything 'cause they'll kill ya.
R:  Right.
L:  So, uh, I don't know, what it is but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know who Veronica Lake was?
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  That's -- I see plenty of -- seen -- seen movies with her.  I was actually named after a nun named Veronica but I certainly know who Veronica Lake was.
L:  Wow.  After a nun.
R:  Did you know that -- here's something, did you know?  Did you know that she and, um, Alan Ladd were actually very small.  They were about, like, five foot n- nothing hardly.
L:  I know he was very small.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I remember that I read something where they had to build a trench --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.
L:  What do you do?
R:  Oh, I'm -- I guess the -- the easiest thing to describe is to say that I'm a teacher.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  I work in education.  What do you do?  Are you retired or are you still working?
L:  I'm retired.  I was a consultant, a business, uh, professional management consultant --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- for many years and I'm retired and then just fooling around, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, see, that's -- I -- I would love to like be -- they give us a topic we're supposed to talk about but I've met people -- I just want to talk to the people about stuff, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  It's -- it's kind of a shame.
L:  Well, we do.
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] sneak some other conversation in there.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I talk about the subject and then I talk about the people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, it's, uh, unusual.  I -- I saw an ad in the paper on this.  I said, "What is this?  Ten dollars?"
