R:  Jenny from New York.
L:  Denise from Pittsburgh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
R:  Is this your first time doing this?
L:  Yeah, it is.  I got it from a friend.  I was like, "Oh this is pretty cool".  [LAUGH] 
R:  This is my second time.  I hope I get paid for the first time because I -- I kind of just got logged off the first time for whatever reason.
L:  Oh, no.  Oh that's bad.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  So, do you watch real life, um -- reality shows?
L:  Um, [MN] you know what, I --I do watch some of them.  I got hooked into the, um, The Bachelor, like, last fall and I watch the Real World a lot, but now --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I won't -- I don't [LAUGH] so and --
R:  I like the Real World too.
L:  Yeah, it was good.  I don't [LAUGH] I [several inaudible words].
R:  The -- the first one was really good.  And, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the -- the one in Las Vegas was a lot of fun too.
L:  Yeah, it was, 'cause I -- I've been to Vegas.
R:  I would love to be on a show like that.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have you ever tried out for anything like that or ...?
R:  Actually, you're going to think this is funny.  I actually have an interview on Tuesday to try out for Blind Date and Fifth -- [inaudible] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- Fifth Wheel.  
L:  Get out.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  That's [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, I -- I just want to -- just to do it for fun, you know.  Just to see what it's all about.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um --
L:  Oh, that's neat.
R:  -- I actually used to work at CBS, um, and that -- they were in the talks of doing Survivor and, uh, Big Brother.  Big Brother I don't think is -- is that good but for --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Survivor, I love to watch the last show.  Because I think that's the most intense.
L:  Okay, you --
R:  I don't like to -- yeah, I don't like to watch the ones where you have to, like, you know --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- see who's going to be eliminated.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I want to know who's the winner.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Um, my brother was hooked on Joe Millionaire actually.
L:  [MN]  [LAUGH]  Yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I never -- one -- one of my friends watched that and I'm like I just -- I was like, "Oh, it's just so shady" because it's making fun of all these females --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean who thought about -- like --
R:  I know.
L:  -- get a bunch of guys on there and make them look like fools.  [MN]  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  Like that show, like, The Bachelor and The Bachelorette.  Do you watch --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that too?
L:  Well, no -- see I watch the, um, I did watch The Bachelor last year and I watched The Bachelorette with that girl Trista, but now the new one, I just -- I've had enough.  I don't want to watch it anymore.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause you just get sucked in after a while and I'm like, "I'm not even going to watch it" so ...
R:  So why do you think they do so well, um, reality shows?
L:  I guess because people's real life suck and they just, uh, [LAUGH] you know --
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  I don't know [several inaudible words] see how [several inaudible words] stuff [LAUGH] at times and --
R:  I think it's --
L:  Or see if it's better.
R:  -- interesting.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think it's very interesting because I guess people are always interested in other people's lives.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they get to just step --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- away from their own life and just be --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- someone elses life and I guess, you know, it gets too like comment on someone elses life.  But it is interesting, you know.  Like, um, I actually want to be in Real World but, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't think they'd pick me.  I send in a tape or something but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Did you ever send in a tape?
L:  No.  You know, act- -- well, now, I'm actually -- I'm twenty seven so I'm too -- I think you have to be, like, under twenty four now or some- --
R:  I know.  You have to be like twelve.  You know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I mean they're all like twenty, twenty one and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm just like, okay.  But it's -- I don't know.  I know I sound young but, um --
R:  You do.
L:  -- which is [inaudible].  I know.  Everybody thinks --
R:  I was about to say that.
L:  I know, I sound -- I look young which is really good for when I'm forty I'm sure, so ...
R:  Yes, --
L:  But ... [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that is good.  Well lucky --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you.
L:  I know, yeah.  So [LAUGH] 
R:  So, um --
L:  But --
R:  Do your friends watch, um, reality shows?
L:  Um, yeah.  See that -- that's how I got hooked into The Bachelor because my, um, my co-worker -- we [MN] work in a real small office and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- me and her, we just talked about it, like, everyday and, you know, then when The Bachelorette came out we -- at -- at the beginning we loved it and then after a while we were just like we hated her 'cause, you know, we're like, "Oh you gotta pick this one" and then we're like, "Oh, she's so bitchy anyway" and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know.  And now I guess they're the only ones that are going to really get married, I think, so, um ...
R:  The worse thing is Joe Millionaire.  Can you imagine these girls thinking they're going to marry some millionaire?  But you know what I've noticed about these -- uh, these like singles reality shows where they end up marrying?  I think that's part of the publicity because they end up not working out.  Did you notice, like, every person that ends up getting hitched or, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- end up saying they're going to be together end up breaking it off anyway.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You know what I mean.
L:  [MN]
R:  I mean, it's guess because maybe where they live or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, the show's over so the cameras are- aren't around anymore so the real them really show through --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know.  Because I think when you have a camera in front of you, even though you try to act like yourself you just end up acting a little different.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Um, I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the Anna Nicole Smith Show is, um, really funny.  I like watching --
L:  Do you watch that, really?
R:  -- that.  She's c- -- she's crazy.  
L:  Oh God.
R:  What is she on?  
L:  [LAUGH]  I don't know.
R:  Seriously.  I mean she must be on every medication in the book and --
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  -- I love it how she's so, like, doesn't care.  
L:  I --
R:  She'll just go on national television on --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- whatever -- on whatever medication she's on.  She's crazy and that's why it's fun to watch.  And The Osbournes are fun to watch too.
L:  Oh, ye- yeah, The Osbournes.  I like that.  Yeah.
R:  Do you know that one --
L:  A lot of --
R:  -- uh, Amy, one of the dau- daughters actually doesn't want to be shown --
L:  [MN]  Yeah.
R:  -- for whatever reason.  I think she should because it's good crap.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Exactly.  I know, they're just --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- they're hilarious.  
R:  Yeah.  I like, I mean, I don't know what it is about reality television.  I guess it's just -- it's just funny, you know.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You get to -- you just -- you get to be a voyeur and you get to look into someone elses life, you know, but ...
L:  Exactly.
R:  I don't know how comfortable I really would be if -- if there was a camera in my face twenty four seven.  I'm sure I'd be annoyed.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  After a while.
L:  After a while it was just like, "Oh".  Yeah, I'm sure that -- I don't know, that's -- I guess -- 'cause even, um, [MN] I don't know, the Real World you always -- whenever they do the editing they -- they make it [MN] --
R:  Exactly.
L:  They edit it like it's so -- it -- it makes it look one way to be, actually, a totally different way, you know.
R:  I wanted to ask you.  Did you hear about the last one in Las Vegas where, um, two people move in together?  Did you hear about that?  [MN]
L:  Oh, the, um, um, wh- -- yeah, Arelon[?] and Elton, at the end.
R:  Did they really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  I -- I read that somewhere.  That they actually -- yeah, they moved in together and they're still together as far as I know.
R:  In New York or ...
L:  Um, no -- I thought it --
R:  But she was --
L:  -- was out on the west coast, but I wasn't sure.
R:  But she -- she lived in New York, unless she decided to move to the west coast.
L:  Okay, I think it was on --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- the west coast.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, I read --
R:  That's interesting.
L:  -- that in a magazine.  [LAUGH]
R:  Because I didn't get to read -- I didn't get to see the, um, reunion, so I was a little upset by that.
L:  Oh, yeah.  It was --
R:  Did you see that?
L:  Yeah, it was good.  Treselle[?] wasn't there for some reason.  I don't know why.  
R:  Oh.
L:  But all the other ones were there and then they were asking about, like, Stephen and Treselle and he's like [MN] -- he's like, "Yeah, we're --".  They live near each other now and they are like -- he's, like, they're best friends and they don't hook up at all anymore but they're really good friends.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, how come they end up -- ended up living near each other?  How did that work out?
L:  Because I -- I think they all were -- like him and, um, Frank and Treselle all went to [MN], um, [LIPSMACK] where they went -- they went to college out in the same area.  I think somewhere out in L.A. or something.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And they all, like, him and Frank and Stephen were roommates, and Treselle lived up the street or something from them so ...
R:  Oh, interesting, because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- did you watch, um, Punked where she was punked.  [MN] You know --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  You know the Ashton -- yeah, oh let me tell you about it.
L:  Yeah [MN].  I love Punked.  We just watched that the other night.  It was so good.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, but did you see the one with Treselle?  
L:  No, I didn't.  I missed that one.
R:  Oh, let me tell you what happened.
L:  Oh my God.
R:  It -- it -- this is the thing that happened to one of the, um, [LIPSMACK] Backstreet Boys.  I don't know his name.  I think his name's Kevin.  You know the dark haired one with the goatee?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah. 
R:  He's the serious one.  What happened --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- was, um, they were going to the MTV studios but they kept -- the, uh, whatever -- the, um, [LIPSMACK] detector kept going off and so they were, like, take your pants off --
L:  Oh my God.
R:  -- to -- to -- to Kevin, or whatever his name is.  And, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- he was like, what's going on?  Like he was really pissed.  And with Treselle they were -- the guy pulled -- pulled her over and she -- he was like, "Can I get your number?  You know, I can let you through".  She's like, "I'm not giving you my number".  It was so --
L:  Oh my [MN]  [LAUGH]
R:  -- funny.  Yeah.  I -- I --
L:  Oh, that's hilar- --
R:  -- love that show.  
L:  Oh, that is funny.
R:  I guess that's also a reality show too.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  'Cause it's like, you know -- you know, behind the scenes, like hiding somewhere but it's -- it's funny.  I mean -- 
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  -- it's -- it's profitable.  It's -- it's good money.
L:  Yeah, that's [MN] 
R:  You know.  But ...
L:  That's probably the main thing about reality shows is they're -- they are profitable so that's why they're still around.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I mean, I -- it's so weird because, um, I think Survivor, how it started, they got there -- that from, um, that idea from Europe, I think.  I think Europe --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- started it off with all of this.  And -- oh, actually talking about, uh, Real World.  Do you know the guy that started Real World?  He put out a movie, um, a --
L:  [MN]  Who Er- --
R:  -- reality --
L:  Oh, E- Eric?
R:  They, um, like, uh, spring break one.  I don't know if you've heard --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- about it.
L:  Real Cancun.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
R:  I wonder if that's good.  I don't know if it is but, you know --
L:  I don't know, I've never -- yeah, I've -- I've heard of it.  It looks funny.  
R:  Yeah, it's based on the same idea I think, so ...
L:  Oh, okay.  [several inaudible words] 
R:  But I'll probably wait until it comes on video.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's a good idea.  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't think I'll -- I don't think I'll spend -- I don't know how much it costs, like, to see a movie in Pittsburgh but it costs --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- ten dollars and [MN] that's pretty pricey, I think.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well here most of them are like seven fifty, eight dollars.  But we have, like, VIP theaters that are -- that are thirteen fifty.
R:  Wow.  What -- what's the VIP theater?  That's interesting.
L:  The VIP is like -- it's like, uh, leather seats with, um, it's really nice.  Like there's a lot of -- and there's like tons of room.  It's almost like -- you can, like, lay if you wanted.  [LAUGH]  It's just like real comfortable.  It's --
R:  Wow, that's like a bed, you could take a nap.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If you want.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Pretty much.  It's at a Lowes theater and there's -- there's -- I think there's some of those in New York but, um, they have VIP seating and then you get like some money off of, like, a meal if you want to eat in their restaurant and stuff too.  With your --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- thirteen fifty tick- -- so, it's not too [MN] --
R:  See that's the cool thing about these, um, phone calls.  I learn a lot.  I talked to this woman about, uh, the topic was food. 
L:  Okay.
R:  And she was -- uh, she's from, uh, North Carolina.  She was just telling me about some restaurants and what they're known for [several inaudible words].  I say, yes, I have to go there.  I definitely have to stop by some of those restaurants.  I wrote it --
L:  Yeah, that should be [LAUGH] --
R:  -- down somewhere.  I don't know what I wrote but [LIPSMACK] -- so, um --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- what else about reality shows did they ask?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, let's see.  If you had to be on one, which one would you -- which one would you be on?
L:  Which one?  Hm.  Oh my God.  I don't know.  I was actually -- because they -- the people came here for The Bachelor and Bachelorette, um --
R:  Oh, did they really?
L:  -- a couple -- yeah, a couple of weeks ago.  And I was, like, laughing at them because I was actually dating someone at the time.  "Like, we should both go on" and, of course, we just broke up so I -- really --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- should've went on it [LAUGH] but ...
R:  Yeah, it would've been fun.
L:  But --
R:  You know, I --
L:  I know.  I know [MN] --
R:  Like I have an interview on Tuesday --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- but I am seeing someone, but he doesn't know about it but --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- [LAUGH] who cares.  You know --
L:  Oh my God.
R:  -- I just wanted to do it just for the hell of it, you know.
L:  Yeah, because the Blind Date was here too.  I
