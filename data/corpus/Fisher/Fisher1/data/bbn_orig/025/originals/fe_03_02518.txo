L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Eileen.
L:  Hi, I'm Jennifer.  How you doing?
R:  Good.
L:  Good.  Where you calling from tonight?
R:  Um, upper Michi- Michigan and Hilton[?] or, um, the upper peninsula in Michigan.
L:  Oh, cool.  All right.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I'm in New York City.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, I'm not from here but that's where I am.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, [MN] is this your first time calling?
R:  This is actually my second time.
L:  Me too.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Cool.
R:  And this is more of an interesting topic than the last one so ...
L:  Wh- what was your last one?
R:  Um, if schools benefit, or if computers in the schools benefit children.  Um, so ...
L:  Oh.
R:  It was more of a hard topic.  This isn't.
L:  Gotcha.  Well, this is kind of a fun one.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's -- it's kind of crazy 'cause I don't actually have a TV.  [LAUGH]
R:  Holy.
L:  But I --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I mean, I have [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I have seen, um, I -- I have watched, like, um, [LIPSMACK] I've seen Survivor a few times.  
R:  Okay.
L:  And I've watched like -- doe- does Who Wants to be a Millionaire count as reality TV?
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I'm not sure, I've seen that show --
R:  I don't even know --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  -- what counts anymore.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]  
R:  I think everything [LAUGH] these days.
L:  I know.  It's so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I can't really figure out why it's so popular because if --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we -- if the idea of reality is TV, is to just show real people doing [MN] just being who they are, I don't see why the --
R:  I know.
L:  I mean I admit that it's interesting but I can't figure out why it's so interesting to people.
R:  Well, I think the whole point of TV was for people to, like, get out of their lives and get into somebody else's life and not have to worry about the day to day things, and all these reality shows are just everything people do every day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um ... [SIGH]
L:  I -- I guess it's the idea that -- I mean like, say, a sitcom kind of does that but you know those people are acting.
R:  Right.
L:  But I guess in a reality TV you know that they're [MN] I -- I guess there's more appealing that they're not acting, they're just responding how any -- how -- how they might respond themselves or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I don't know.  But, I mean, I admit, like, I've -- I've turned on Survivor at a friend's house and just, like, sort of been glued to the TV --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] like the whole time.  Like I just find myself like, "Wow".  You know, team psychology and everything.  It's so weird.
R:  Well, the first Surv- Survivor I watched, because it was, you know, really big and I was there, you know, at the very last one wondering who was going to win.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But after two, three and four and -- I mean, I -- I think the only reality show that I have watched lately for some strange reason is --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- The Bachelor this time.  And I didn't watch it last time but I just think the -- the -- the guy who does The Bachelor this time is just so intriguing.
L:  Really?
R:  And it's just interesting 'cause he's a millionaire and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, you -- you wonder if, you know, these women, they're all fighting over him and is it really because of him or, I mean, come on, he's got millions and millions of dollars.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So.
L:  It -- it's interesting because when I sign on to, uh, AOL in the mornings there's always a big headline, like who got --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- voted off --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] or something.  I'm like, "Who are these people?" but ...  It's -- they -- they seem just on first glance like normal, nice people and -- but I can't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I kind of wonder what, at least, type of person would subject themselves to --
R:  I know.
L:  -- this.  So that's -- that's the thing that kind of irks me because it's sort of like -- they obviously know they're just going to meet some guy that they've never known and then like in a few weeks they could [several inaudible words] be married to the guy.
R:  I know.
L:  Like who would want to do that?
R:  Well, um, um, gosh, the one where, um, America married those -- that couple.
L:  Yeah, that was [LAUGH] unreal.
R:  I mean --
L:  That was crazy.
R:  I just -- I [MN] -- the way I feel about it, is it's like, I mean, and this is just my opinion, it's like the sanctity of everything that is sacred to, like, marriages and couples --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and families is just being thrown out there 'cause now, I mean, [MN] who cares?  I mean, now, you know, anybody can get married and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- anybody can do anything and, you know, what are they going to do next?  Uh, they keep trying to top themselves --
L:  Yeah and I mean it seems --
R:  -- in reality.
L:  It -- it seems like the government or the -- whoever's in charge has relieved itself of --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- of -- of ever -- I mean, they -- they no longer have the right to complain about the high divorce rates.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because they're supporting -- I mean, who -- whoever --
R:  I know.
L:  -- is in charge of supporting the idea that it's so casual you don't even have to choose --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- the person and it's -- I mean, it's not like in, say, some other cultures have like your family chooses someone for you.  Okay, it's like --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- at least it's partly meaningful.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's not to you personally but, like, that I would choose someone for, like, you to marry [LAUGH] I mean --
R:  Well --
L:  -- like that's crazy.
R:  Well, in everything, I mean, and you think what, you know, they've done the marriage, they've done the what?  Small town where you're pretending like somebody's going to get murdered.
L:  [MN]  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's done.  You know, all these things.  And what are they going to do next --
L:  Good question.
R:  -- to top themselves?  I mean --
L:  Like where they can go?  I mean --
R:  Yeah.  Public executions or --
L:  Cruise ships.  Yeah.
R:  I mean, you never -- it's getting scary.
L:  It'll -- it'll pro- -- like, I can imagine maybe, um, like having a show where people get to act out, like not only their dream job but something that's kind of, like, weird and gross that you wouldn't want to do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like someone who had to go be like a, you know, a -- a rat exterminator in --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- New York City and see if they can handle it for twenty four hours.  I just mean like something that would -- because it's either got to get scarier or grosser --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or something.  Because that's what people love.
R:  Yep.
L:  And sadly --
R:  And they're not going to watch it otherwise.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it can't get like just for people or -- [MN] act, like, acting really normally, which is just what life is like.  You come home and you do the dishes and you're -- you know, it's -- it's, I don't know, it's weird.  
R:  I mean, you have to be scared when, like, the number one reality show, The Osbournes, is like everybody's favorite show and everybody's like, "Oh, they're -- they're such a wonderful family --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- and ...  I mean, I just -- I think they get along so well".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's like, "Oh my gosh" [LAUGH]  What happened?
L:  Like, what planet are you on?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean if that was -- even just a couple of years ago people would just be freaking out, and now it's just normal.  You know.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, hey, that's just a normal family just doing their thing and ...  I mean, it's just gotten so crazy, but I'm just really afraid though what they're going to come up with next 'cause they keep trying to outdo themselves.
L:  Maybe they'll have to go backwards.  Like, remember that movie that was called, like, Pleasantville.  Like it was in black and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- white, or something.  Like, they'll have to be just so, like, sort of, nineteen sixties, like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like nuclear families.  Moms in the kitchen with the apron and [MN] --
R:  That would be nice.
L:  Like Dad comes home and "Hello, dear", you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And they're going to have to just kill themselves.  I mean, it would never work but, who knows.  I'm just trying to be optimistic, I guess.
R:  I mean they either -- do they either have to go backwards or they're, you know.  I'm thinking [MN] -- I'm thinking the next thing they're going to do is like public executions or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  I mean, it's just going to get really bad and people are just going to think, "Oh, you know.  No biggie".
L:  Yeah, 'cause the current thing is people, I mean -- actually my friend dated the producer of Survivor.
R:  Really?
L:  Um, what's his name?  Mark something.  I don't know.  Doesn't matter.  But the point is that it, you know, I -- I [MN] seriously question, and partly because of what she said, the actual validity of who gets chosen, say to be a survivor and who gets, sort of, [LIPSMACK] -- I mean, it's a little bit like fixed, slightly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because you have to have people with certain personalities and, like, [MN] -- I remember there was this one guy that was extremely lazy.  He never did --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- anything.  He [MN] -- he was just kind of an asshole to everybody.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I couldn't believe that he wasn't getting voted off.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it was just like [MN] -- I kept saying. "This is ridiculous".  I mean he was -- I can't remember the guy's name either.  He was clearly putting down people every [several inaudible words].  I could not figure out why the guy made it to the end of the show.  But, it's like they needed somebody like that in there to make it interesting.
R:  +Yeah.
L:  And I -- I mean, it -- it could've been true but my kind of a gut feeling is the producers were like, "Look that guy needs to stay in so don't be --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- voting that guy off".  I don't know.  [LIPSMACK]  But, um, [SIGH] so I don't believe -- planned, uh -- I haven't had TV for, like, six years.
R:  Really?
L:  I'm not going to get one but --
R:  That's a good thing though.  I'm thinking --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, I have three kids and sometimes I think, you know, should we get rid of it 'cause it's just getting worse and worse?
L:  I mean, the thing is, it's not like there's not good stuff on.  Well, I mean, if you look at the [MN] animal channel or the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [inaudible].  But the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- problem is that it's just plainly addicting.  I mean, how many other things in your life could you do for, like, three hours at a time and not notice the time go by but TV.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, there's things that I love but that I wouldn't do them for three hours a day but TV, "Oh, I'll just like watch anything".
R:  +Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, the -- the problem is when I go to a friend's house that has TV, or whatever, I find myself just really wanting [LAUGH] to watch TV.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like I've [MN] definitely [inaudible] something.
R:  Well, um, I mean, they're trying to -- so hard to, you know, hook people in that.  It's like almost -- it seems like almost every show on TV seems to be almost the same.
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH]  
R:  I mean --
L:  It's true, they're running out of ideas.
R:  -- you can turn the channel and [LAUGH] there it is.  It's the same thing.
L:  [MN]  [LAUGH]  I know.  
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just -- I don't watch -- I don't watch it much and definitely I don't watch the reality.  I mean the gross stuff I can't handle, like --
L:  Oh, yeah, Fear Factor I've seen.
R:  Fear Factor, yeah.
L:  I can't stand it when they have to eat something really --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- gross.  That just --
R:  And I can't be- --
L:  -- makes me want to vomit.
R:  -- you know, how much do they get?  A thousand dollars, no I'm sorry.
L:  It's -- it's -- it's ten thousand bucks but --
R:  Oh, ten thousand but still ...
L:  -- you know, ten thousand bucks these days.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.
R:  I wouldn't --
L:  I mean, like --
R:  I -- there's -- I would not do it.
L:  I mean, I would do the scary stuff like doing some type
